B0052UZIFA|5.0|Having played other tower defense games, and hearing strong positive feedback from friends who've played &#34;Plants vs. Zombies&#34;, I thought I'd give it a try myself.<br /><br />It's a very fun game to play, and is challenging - I had a devil of a time beating some of the levels.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is the best Grisham book in years!  It had me from the very beginning.  I couldn't put it down. When was the last time you could say that about a Grisham book?
B000002KGT|5.0|The CD is in excellent condition - better than I expected.  And, this is one of my favorite Fleetwood Mac CDs, with great songs.<br /><br />I highly recommend both the seller and this specific Fleetwood Mac CD.<br /><br />Thanks.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|Why does every app need to data mine my (and my contacts) phone?<br />Such an awful trend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|If you didn't particularly like temple run like me it is still a great buy<br />It's fun and has great graphics you'll live it!
B0088W7VNG|4.0|Looks great on a fast connection but if you already have the Blu-Rays that would be the best viewing possible.
B0087EACJK|4.0|fun game so far, but I have to turn the sound off every time I restart it, whichis very annoying.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I enjoy this game. kit has some problems but I can work around them. still have fun playing it to waste time.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Well acted, but is it an acurate insight into Lincoln or just the writers idea of what he may have been like?  If you accept this as a fictional account, then it is just fine.  If you take it litterally then you missed the boat.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is an addiction!  Actors are well cast, settings are real.  A great way to spend time while we wait for spring.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Stories about your family are almost either cliche or surreal. Sedaris writes about both, but leaves his reader enthralled the entire time.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this program ,You must also get the other seasons...I wish it could go on and on!!! Love it!
B00BI73CVI|3.0|This type of movie is not for me, the story is like an opera show and it put me to sleep at times.  My wife liked it but not me.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is addicting and VERY fun.  It keeps you going with the upgrades you can buy to enhance the game play.  I downloaded for the phone, and kindle so my roomate and I don't fight over who can play.  :)
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Nothing has change in politics, the movie put me in a curious mood as to why it is that way.  It is so difficult to make decisions without others involved.  Life if is a game of influencing others to get things done.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Another action packed Bond film that keeps your attention. Even the movie emphasizes that Bond is getting up their in years for the kind of work he does.....but of course he completes his assignments!!
B0027Z2T8C|5.0|The fight scenes are funny, original, and well executed. This will always be one of my favorite movies because of the mix of two great genres.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Three words.....Daniel Day-Lewis.  He IS Lincoln and once again proves he is one of the very best actors of all time. All others in their supporting roles were also very good. Although it's a good history telling movie I don't think most kids under 13 would stay focused on the complicated subject matter, plus the battlefield scenes are pretty gruesome. I highly recommend this movie!
B00BEIN9VO|4.0|I think this album is a natural progression and maturation from his last two. I like that Justin has taken some chances, the styling is spot-on (from the videos to the album art), and it still feels very much like a JT album. For me the highlights are \\"Pusher Love Girl,\\" \\"Tunnel Vision,\\" \\"Mirrors,\\" and \\"Blue Ocean Floor.\\" He's one of the most naturally gifted and forward-thinking pop stars we have. It's definitely not a 5-star album, though, as some of his lyrics can be pretty clunky.<br /><br />For those of us who purchased the vinyl, I'm a little baffled--the website for the coupon to download the MP3 files results in an internal server error. It does provide an email address for a system administrator, and I have tried emailing several times ... the inbox is full and no messages are being received.<br /><br />I bought the vinyl because I really love the sound quality, but obviously it's much easier to listen to MP3s on the go than it is vinyl, so I probably would not have purchased it in this format if I knew this was going to be the case. Has anyone else had problems with this?
0375413405|5.0|My fiance and I love to cook with Julia. She makes French cooking less intimidating and a lot of fun.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great story.. Would make a fantastic movie. The story starts pretty slow and a lot of calculation and numbers astronauts need to know. Makes the story a bit hard to read but over all it get pretty intense a good read
0956010903|5.0|Worth every penny to a collector like me! Something I will always treasure and read to my children some day.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game is the best I have found yet so watch out everyone it is addictive.  Hope you enjoy it
B00003CXPD|5.0|Definitely a feel good movie, once you get through all the sadness and turmoil. Love watching the struggle Billy goes through.
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|Argo, boring, didn't get all the hype, very great true story, but kind of a slow boring movie, except for the beginning and the end, but you know what happens.
B00942G4UA|5.0|This document lifted the veil from my eyes.<br /> Shocking and very real.  It's unbelievable  what really happens behind close doors.
0316227706|5.0|A well photographed book of dogs having fun underwater.  I took it to my vet's office and it got great reviews.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|I love it! Love love love it! It holds my kindle beautifully. It holds my kindle safely and comfortably for reading. Protects nicely. I'm happy very happy
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Most people don't like when bands go &#34;mainstream&#34; but I think it can be a great opportunity to them. OneRepublic really did change their sound in this album, and it is great! Somehow they move on to a new, fresh sound so it doesn't seem like you're just listening to a re-release of Waking Up, and yet if you pay attention, you can still hear some great moments that remind you of their old days. There are very few albums that I would rate as 5 stars and this is one of them, a must buy!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Voxel Invaders is a fun fast paced game for all ages.  grab the power ups and shoot for hours.  cllassic one player shooter game.
B0071FBARY|4.0|To be honest, The Fray didn't really move on with this album. It's sounds very similar to their previous stuff and I feel like there's a missed opportunity here. This being said, after a few days of trying it out I have found songs that I can get into, but I'm waiting for them to break the mold that they've set for themselves. If you like The Fray already, buy it for sure; it's a great album but not revolutionary.
B00178JDCK|5.0|I've found Behringer products to be consistently good values for the price, and this sweet little unit is no exception.  I wanted a basic reverb box for some recording applications, but I got a whole lot more.  Make no mistake, this is not a total effects box, but it sure offers a greater variety of sounds than I expected.  I spent the better part of an afternoon just playing and experimenting. I've tried it with instruments and miked vocals, and am very pleased with the results.<br /><br />As for durability, the RV600 appears to be well constructed...I use it as an outboard to my console, so I haven't and probably won't use it as a foot pedal...but I'm guessing it will hold up well, providing you don't stomp on it.<br /><br />As a retired audo producer with 37 years experience, I've worked with a lot of gadgets, and this one has certainly been satisfactory so far!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm an avid reader and I have really enjoyed myself reading this trilogy. I love the descriptions, I'd love to see the movie!!
B004RKXNDU|5.0|The beginning of duplicity and tension at The Circus.  Not to mention infighting, banishment and politics at its worst. Characters everywhere, and all worthy of the reader's attention
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead is the best show on television. Period. AMC has really boiled down what it could be like when man has society pulled out from under him. It makes you think, how close are our primal instincts to the surface?
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I really like this because it gives me instructions on how-to use the free ebooks.  I used to go to the library all the time because I can't afford to purchase a lot of books.  With this application, I can have several books on my Kindle without worrying about due dates and trips to the library.
B007PKOKTK|4.0|This is a funny, imaginative family film for an Easter weekend, or any weekend!  We enjoyed it very much and now we know why chicks don't bring Easter baskets.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Usually, I don't care for mysteries or &#34;lawyer&#34; books, but tried this one after reading multiple ads for it.  I was not disappointed - very enthralling,
B008FPOIT6|5.0|The story has a broad appeal and begs the answer to life's most important questions!  Men and women alike will be quickly absorbed in the story and the thought provoking issues explored from various angles.  Great book to take on a plane or enjoy by the pool this spring!
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|The story starts very slowly, and the plot intracies get a bit confusing. It is not a book you cant put down. I read a chapter or two and would go back to TV.
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|My children love this movie and it so cute and funny.  I recommend this movie to anyone with children.. Gives hours of entertainment to the entire family.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|This REALLY IS a good show, music, production value,  everything.  But be clear that IT IS NOT PHANTOM OF THE OPERA!!!!!
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This was a great movie, my whole family enjoyed it, especially my children.  its cute and funny and i would recommend it to anyone with children.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Really good recommended it to friends i really enjoyed it still playing it i think everyone should play it get it
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|This movie is great, it is very interesting and such a great movie.  My family enjoyed this movie very much.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I'm not gonna go into detail cause it would spoil the fun. Its a must see. Anyone who gives it a bad review is not worthy of being a human being.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|While the movie was funny, the streaming experience was horrible...very choppy.  Streamed it 3 times over 24 hours, same result every time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very addicting and I love playing it every night before I go to bed. Subway surfers is a good game to play to waste time whether you are waiting for a ride after school or if you are waiting for your favorite tv show to come on. In my opinion you should get this game whether it is for your kids or just for yourself.<br /><br />SUBWAY SURFERS #1 FAN
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An excellent story and clear and unfiltered insight into the war on terror, firsthand from a man on the front line.
B0053TMP24|4.0|The book was good but the first was better. I think that Rick Riordan could have done better. He is still my favorite author.
B0018RFLQ2|4.0|Fine acting all around.  The boy is marvelous, too.  Good plot, heartwarming with a good message.  Another oldy but goodie.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I used previously and old version, and it was good, but this last version it's very good and easy to use.
B005HEFB6M|4.0|Just enough cheezy to be good.  Likeable characters, and maybe the Vulcan will grow on me someday, but I swear, I think she might break out a pole and start pole dancing any minute!
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This is a good price for the Blu-ray.  We love the BBC Sherlock and find the series superior to any other Sherlock movies/series.
B002XXNSF6|3.0|Maybe I could listen to Shakespeare talk this much, but pleaseeeee!  There are moments, but not enough to entertain this gal!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love it. It keeps me interested. And can't wait until the next episode.  Great cast and beautiful setting.  Ok
B000I5SY5U|4.0|Liza is marvelous like her mother, Judy Garland.  The acting is superb and Joey Grey is amazing. An oldy but goody.
B00BYOEZTI|2.0|The Hobbit is like watching Gandhi of Middle Earth. The difference being, of course, that after you finally make it to the end of the boring and rambling story you realize there are still two more movies to go.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Different in a good way.  Enjoyed the plot and the kids were great in their roles.  Just enough silly to be entertaining.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|It's amazing what they have done with this game!!! Lots of levels and fun enough for me and my kids bought all the extra levels and they were so worth every penny!
B005COO1X6|3.0|Love Stephen King...I did not expect the story to end so abruptly...Sorry, but I have to say I was disappointed.
B005K17RU0|3.0|I used to use this app all the time on my kindle fire. I loved adding in zip codes of my family members and being quickly able to check the weather in their city.  Now since this app. was updated a few weeks ago it is a pain to use. Takes a long time to load and gives too much info.
B003B02O14|5.0|Grisham has a way of holding my attention.  I thoroughly enjoy his writing.  Always interesting characters and a very intriguing plot.
0762777931|5.0|This has been quite an eye opening book, as to what we are doing to our bodies in this world of so many sugars & chemicals!
B009PXNFQE|5.0|So good to be true! The new musics are amazing! The hole CD works well and the lyrics do the same...
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This has to be one of the best RPG games that I have played in a long, long time.  Keep up the good work.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|Great book, really enjoyed it, but, when do we find out what happened?<br />Cheers,<br />John S Mc Fall MBE, PMG.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|As I remembered it from childhood and very close to the movie as well (or actually the movie is very close to it)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I found this book and decided to read it due it's high ratings and wasn't disappointed. It's an easy and captivating read. The author keeps you guessing at every turn. It was suspenseful and highly addictive. The ending was good and you certainly can't beat the price! I would've paid more to read such a good book. I would love to see this made into a movie!
0143122916|5.0|What a marvelous book (and a quick book to read).  I think we should all be aware of human right's violations and the atrocities occuring in North Korea.
B0009VSB06|3.0|The Ace 150 is okay but the setting are very sensitive. All of the sounds seem to be fairly the same and the sensors are sensitive and beeps on most anything. Enjoying the digging with my son though.
0765325950|3.0|Without giving away spoilers, I found this final book to be somewhat disappointing.  In terms of pacing, it is essentially flat-out battle for most of the pagecount.  Whereas this may seem appropriate for the final book in a 14-volume story, remember that very few readers will be coming straight from reading the previous 13, so any previous emotional buildup will likely have had years to simmer down. Strategic pacing could have brought great contrast to this final novel...but sadly, a missed opportunity.<br /><br />Authors could be excused for the substantial plot holes if it hadn't taken so many thousands of pages to build to this point.  A 14-book series is an implicit promise to readers: \\"stick with me through the whole story, and I'll deliver an epic ride\\".  Entire subplots were ignored, or tied off with superficial treatment.  This series started slowly, got in some really excellent scenes, whimpered for a few thousand pages, ramped back up when Sanderson took over, and ultimately ended in a predictable and underwhelming conclusion.<br /><br />I really enjoyed a number of previous WoT novels, but this one was disappointing.  There was a distinct lack of satisfying \\"convergence\\" at the end of what should have been a truly epic story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|tons of fun. I think it is challenging but not too difficult. it is great mindless fun to pass the time.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Lincoln, the movie was simply just an ok movie.....................a tad boring, not what I expected. I thought it would have been more interesting, maybe just too many politics.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very well-written and entertaining story. I now think about flowers differently! the characters are believable and complex. It is one of those novels where you are sad to see it end as you care so much about the characters
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I originally got the Battery HD app for my first generation Kindle Fire and I now use it on Kindle Fire HD. The battery is very helpful in letting you know how much activity is left.  I have had no problems with the app either freezing the Kindle or interfering with other apps.  If you want to have more information about your battery, I recommend getting this app.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great suspense, but I was disappointed to learn that many things in the movie did not really happen. So, just keep in mind that it is loosely based on a true story.
B003B96AOW|4.0|Beautiful figure comes with intricate detail and removable swords, guns and sais but legs are a but floppy so cannot stand in diorama that well. Overall worth it though.
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|It works perfectly right out o the box in my dell xps 12 USB 3.0 (windows 8). The driver can be downloaded easily from the web.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This second book of the Crossfire trilogy is as engaging as the first. The plot is intriguing and leaves one yearning to know more. Again, the characters jump off the page, and the storyline is riveting, and the sexual content is sizzling. Look forward to book three. Love Sylvia Day's writing.
0345522478|4.0|I was in the mood for a light hearted read Hounded fit the bill. It was fast-paced and action packed. While I didn't feel the story or characters necessarily drew me in, it was a fun read. It had me laughing out loud at parts. An interesting take on Druids, wolves, vampires, fae and gods/goddesses. I will definitely read more of this series.
B00846REIS|5.0|The characters were well developed, the storyline complex enough to be interesting, very good dialogue, and very hot sexual content. Leaves one wanting to know more of these characters to learn if they have been able to solve their respective problems.<br />A very good read.
0307341577|5.0|This is the first book from Flynn that I have read. I did not want to put this book down. Read through it in about a day.It is not a book for the lighthearted. It is pretty dark, disturbing, even depressing and Flynn does a great job of writing that. The mystery aspect of the book was done very well. There were times I thought I would figure something out and then there was more information that just didn't fit what I thought. Flynn just sucked me in from the beginning.The book didn't necessarily have me locking all my doors and windows, but it did make me think wow what goes on in this authors head?
B007ZXK08C|4.0|An intense and frightening insight into the mind of a woman scorned. The story will grip you until the very last page.
B00BHU261S|4.0|I liked this movie because it showed the inside story of the movie making of Psycho.  I also was amazed at the role his wife played in his creative works--she should have had billing as well.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game I especially love how it goes to different place  LOVE IT SOOOO MUCH hope u love it to
B000ICXQXI|4.0|I watched this movie many years ago and had forgotten most of it.  I wanted to watch it again and compare my impressions now with those then.  I found that the horrible parts I remembered weren't so horrible now.  Perhaps I am jaded to violence.
0316187216|5.0|I \\"read\\" the audiobook from Audible. It blew me away. I like all of Abercrombie's books, yet I'm tempted to say this is the best one yet (maybe tied with The Heroes). There is no single wasted word. The characters are vivid, the story riveting from beginning to end. The character's fates are masterfully intertwined in remarkable ways. The story is set in the same world as Abercrombie's previous books, and some old characters return. There is tragedy, comedy, and farce. While knowing Abercrombie's earlier books is not strictly necessary for enjoying this one, it seems recommendable to read them first.<br /><br />The speaker Steven Pacey does an incredible job lending a unique and memorable voice to every main character, of which there are many.<br /><br />I'm fairly sure this is one of the few books I will read a second time.
B00BF123WG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and liked the acting.  The woman who was Maya was really an amazing person and I enjoyed learning more about her.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love the game...wish you didn't have to use money to purchase anything.  Should be part of prizes...Love the over all affects...the options.  Wish you could choose your friends.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|This is a beautiful love story. A little disappointed with the ending but still loved it. Make sure you keep some Kleenex nearby. You'll need em!
B0033RT7RE|1.0|I love scary movie but this one was slow and boring. Not scary at all.  The dialog was quite corny.
B002RVCD0U|5.0|Sci-fi is my favorite and I love Terminator anything.  This was really really good and would love to see more. I did not think Sarah Connor series was very good storylines but this movie was great. Also having Christian Bale in anything is always a plus!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Was just as impressed with the second game as I was with the first! A little harder to figure out, but over all its good!!
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Being from the area, Santa Cruz, I know the real story, good and bad.  The movie is inspirational, motivating and just a good family story.  Locals all know the place and it's always fun to see a movie which actually shows the real places. Can't say all the houses are on those roads though....<br />It's a good treatment to a sad but uplifting story.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|I bought this for 2 sets of grandchildren.  LOVED the movie when I watched it !!!!! THE ONLY movie my 2yr old granddaughter will sit down and watch !!!!!  It s sooooooooooooo cute I may buy it for Grandmas house....
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|What a great story line.  I thought at first it would be too violent but often the violence is treated like a Hitchcock method - you did not actually 'see' what you thought you saw.  Vikings are by historic account, a violent culture and of course for the times, violence was common.  But how the characters evolve, change and you begin hoping for the characters before you realize, hey that's not right', Looking forward to all the rest.
B00BWGISB4|5.0|I love the new cd! It is one of the best i have heard in a while! Cant get enough!
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Somehow, m,ovies like this don't seem to catch on as well as they should. The video sell more than the movie. I really liked this and would love to see more in this series.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This game is a waste! I thought that it would be fun cause my friend has this app and it was so fun! But this game is not for any kindle! First of all....it does t even repeat what I say! And when I try to do an action I apparently have to pay for more features! This game better on any smart/ touch phone but not good on the kindle.....but it also good on the I pads and the Samsung tablets... really on Any tablets with a microphone! So that's my opinion agree or not... I will not change it!<br />  -KAILEE
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|A M A Z I N G!!!!!!!! I have watched this production over and over. It really is the next best thing to the original stage show.
B00BHU9BV6|5.0|Loved Tolstoy's story.  Worried over another Hollywood version, especially with Keira Knightly.  She just didn't fit the person I had in my head that was Anna.  But I was stunned - this movie is gorgeous, intelligent and artistic.  Let go of Tolstoy and just enjoy this movie.  Every actor is perfectly cast.  The script maintains the feeling behind the book, without sticking absolutely to the story Tolstoy wrote.  It was beautiful.  Also - would Hollywood please pay attention to Ruth Wilson.  She is fabulous.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Almost 4 hours of movie and 30 minutes of plot. That about sums it up.  Do you know how many of the dwarves I can name? None, because there's no character development at all. I can name Bilbo, Golumn and Gandalf, that's it. The rest of the cast might as well be a team of extras that could litterally be replaced with other extras half way through the film and I wouldn't be the wiser, nor would the story suffer for it.<br /><br />Here's the movie in a nut shell: Shire - Walking - CGI - golumn - more CGI - the end.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|This game is a challenge... nothing's worse than a game that's too easy.  But it's not so difficult that I that playing it either.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|This album has a similar flavor to Snakes and Arrows. If you like how Rush's style has evolved, then check it out. Their rock style accompanied by stringed instruments is worth a listen.
B009AMANH4|5.0|What is there to say except - this is a great movie. I've read the book Team of Rivals which was used to create the movie. I highly recommend both.
1409303187|5.0|My daughter who's 2 1/2, loves peppa pig, and we love these books, They are very tiny, but perfect for toddler size books, they look just like the cartoon, great little short stories. We've been reading these every night before bed, we read through the whole 'little library' about 3 times. So they are a really quick read but my daughter loves them.
B005LAIII0|5.0|This was a very exciting and thought provoking movie, we have watched it three times and see something a little different each time.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this gave I can't stop playing it on my time off. Love it I wish I knew another game I could play that I will enjoy just as much
1451696191|3.0|This small novel is composed of letters written by 15-year-old Charlie to a friend he does not name.  It covers his freshman year of high school.  Charlie is the youngest of three children, his oldest brother is in his first year at Penn State playing football and his sister is a high school senior.  The letters start with the suicide of his best friend and how he tries to deal with that as he begins high school.  His best friends there are the seniors.  Brother and sister, Patrick and Sam.  Patrick's boyfriend, Brad, secretly gay due to being the quarterback of the football team, Mary Elizabeth, a girl who thinks she loves him.  His English teacher starts giving him books to read and the asks him to write an essay about each one.  Charlie states that most of the time the best book he ever read was the last one he read.<br /><br /> Charlie's sexuality is somewhat blurred.  He thinks he loves Mary Elizabeth and they engage in kissing, but stop when Charlie feels it becomes too intimate.  Yet we don't get a picture that Charlie is gay.  In fact Charlie's sexuality is never revealed during the novel, perhaps during the remaining years of high school he will find out who he is.<br /><br /> His friend Sam, in her last conversation with him before she leaves for college, tells Charlie that he has to reveal himself.  She tells him he tries not to offend, but he never says what he wants from other people.  She wonders if he thinks he is not good enough to be loved.<br /><br /> The suicide of Michael and later the death of his Aunt Helen, who helped take care of him and his brother and sister play in the background.  Charlie participates in activities, but only with the over students and some adults.  Even Mary Elizabeth, his supposed girl friend, is a senior.  And at the end of the book, Charlie finds himself alone.<br /><br /> The Catcher is the Rye is one of the books his teacher Bill gives him and, of course, Chbosky's book about teen-age angst would help us recall Holden Caulfield.  And Charlie is full of troubles.<br /><br /> These troubles become the contents of the letters he write to the unknown \\"friend.\\"  technique takes some fortitude on the reader to continue.  Fortunately it is a short book, so one was able to read the story, develop some empathy for the characters and nod in acknowledgment that the adolescent world is full of sex, both fantasy and \\"real\\" as well as drugs, tobacco, and booze.<br /><br /> If one has not burned oneself out on these stories, this is an effective one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Game Is Very Fun For My Kids.  They Love Playing It.  My Favorite Character Is The Ninja.  My Sons Favourite Is The King . MyOldest Daughter's. Favorite. Is Roberto. And My Middle Child (Second Daughter) Likes Tammy.  We All Have A Blast Seeing Who Can Get Tgd Most Coins. Every Run.  I Recommend This.
B00123G5UI|5.0|The Head On The Door (Deluxe) is the 6th studio album from The Cure and is a mix of new wave, alternative rock and goth rock. My favorite tracks are In Between Days and Close to Me. This deluxe compilation has been compiled by Robert Smith and the second CD contains RS home demo's, studio demo's and live bootlegs. The booklet contains all the lyrics, photographs from the time of the recording along with well-written music notes. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B00683JK9K|3.0|This game helps time go by and is very relaxing. I just wish there were better choices of pictures. Try and see if you could take some of the pics on Pinterest and make puzzles out of them. That would be awesome!
B000059QYB|4.0|Billy Idol - Greatest Hits is a greatest hits compilation that includes many gems and some that should not have been included. Dancing With Myself, White Wedding and Flesh for Fantasy are amazing. I did not like his rendition of L.A. Woman, and the cover of Don't You Forget About Me was painful. Still a very good compilation that could have been a tad better. Recommended. 4/5.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This game is so addicting. The only con I have is that it's very difficult to collect the gems & coins to advance.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|First of all imagine that Abraham Lincoln is a fictional character this will put you in the right frame of mind for a decent attempt at a vampire movie set during civil war times in the USA. Part dark comedy, part horror and a dab of love story. Overall not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|A perfect way to review old songs with new arrangementes!!!<br />Besides a voice, always, perfect.<br />Some songs are really funny, like Perfidia and Malafemmina.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use this app every day. However, I thought it was a much more user friendly app prior to the update. I love that it continuously updates the weather so it delivers accurate information. I'd recommend this app. I use this app over the weather on the local news. It does what it advertises.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I jalisa truly love this game and I think it is totally awesome and I wish I made this game so I can be like a gazillionaire.
B00AKEMHCA|3.0|Yo I cant give it a rate because I cant download it. I bought it I just cant install it. WHAT DO I DO?
B0052UYJDC|5.0|If you have stuff...you need to read this book!<br />I love becoming a minimalist and this book is a step by step guide to doing so.<br />Easy to read and follow. Keeps you wanting to purge more!
B00BF11STU|4.0|I watched this with my 18 year old son.  We then had a discussion about the use of torture by governments, ours and others, which I am sure we would have never had without watching this movie.  War is evil and war is hell.  As for the movie, it was entertaining and largely believable.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|Story of the Life of Pi is a devastatingly, creative narrative;  thoroughly enjoyed his method of storytelling and his brilliant use of language.<br /><br />Certainly opened my mind to another view of captured dependent wild animals living in limited defined enclosures in  zoos; which mirrors the story of the animals (human and otherwise) who were enclosed in a life boat on a vast ocean trapped in a horrifying trauma of survival.  For the suffering young Pi a human feat of intense practicality and celebration of Life during the throes of great personal loss.<br /><br />It's as much a spiritual quest for meaning as it is an engagement of complex polemics of various choices, painfully opposing paths we travel simultaneously ......questions where reality and fantasy/fiction can become blurred.<br /><br />In  the Author's notes there is a curious sentence.... \\"I have a story that will make you believe in God\\"....mmmmm?<br /><br />And toward the end it asks \\"......which story do you prefer ? .......with animals or...... without ....?<br />An answer is given.....and then \\"....so it goes with God.\\"<br /><br />Once there was a philosophically inclined psychology professor who told his students. \\"if we lived in reality 24 hrs a day, we would choose to die !\\"  Yann Martel brings us to that very brink.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I don't have words to tell howmuch i love this game, just remind me the old times....<br />Just love and when i start to paly i can't stop.
1780721676|1.0|Absolutely unusable, uninspiring, impossible to do. Very unpleasant premise, lousy recipes. Altogether a waste of time to pursue this diet.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Enough of the Gov. and the prison,they need to move on,looks like they are digging in and the Gov. will be back
0307346617|5.0|I was never a fan of the horror genre until I read \\"The Passage\\" by Justin Cronin. That book was a revelation. I read the second title in the trilogy, \\"The Twelve\\" and also liked it.<br />\\"World War Z\\"... well, I hesitated a long time until I decided to try it. Oh boy! Am I glad I did! Because I really, really liked it! I listened to the abridged audiobook (since I couldn't find an unabridged version) and I can only imagine how much better and fuller the whole version must be.<br /><br />Whoever came up with the concept of abridged books should be shot. What an asinine idea! Would anyone watch an abridged one-hour version of \\"Star War\\" instead of the full movie? Well, same with books!<br /><br />But I must say that even the abridged version was pretty fantastic. Each interview was narrated by a different person and everyone did a wonderful job. Every single narrator felt so convincing, I loved it!<br /><br />Sometimes, as with \\"The Dog Stars\\" by Peter Heller, audiobooks are far superior to the printed word. The emotion that passes through a human voice gives substance to a story that might otherwise fall flat. That has been my experience as I listen to dozens of audiobooks each month.<br /><br />While I don't particularly care for zombies and certainly never watch horror movies, I thoroughly enjoyed the story depicted in \\"World War Z\\". Quite original actually. Well, at least for me.<br />I wonder how the upcoming movie will translate.<br />Definitely recommended.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|Very good for a remake.Finding a invading enemy seemed to be a problem.The remake only loosely followers the original. En eztra raid or two would of helped.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Very well written book. Stays with you while you're reading it, and after.  Opens your eyes and makes you think. And grateful.
B00BYOEMTQ|3.0|The acting was great. Along with the camera shots. Camera angles and lighting really made the scales. Another impression would be, that the director could not control how gritty the environment was, resulting in a loss of realism. For the money I should of seen the whole book on screen.
B00BF11STU|4.0|Raw emotion with good action.  Knowing some special ops people they nailed it. Realistic and straight forward.  Gives a glimpse into the real intel world as well.
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|Someone else must of did the ending on this one. The quality came across to inconstantly. Iam still in favor of another .
B004UG7RQ0|3.0|I bought this adapter to run a Samsung Galaxy S3 on my bike through the iHome Cycler, instead of an iPod. When connected the sound comes through the iHome but I've lost the functionality of the handle bar remote control. So now I cannot advance through songs or adjust volume controls through the controller, which leads me mount my phone on the handle bars instead of stashing it in a bag. Looking for a bicycle mount for a GS3? Good luck.<br />I gave it three stars because it's halfway there. I have sound, but lost functionality of the device.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Initial trailers, Got me there. Lost interest for the most part. It still has some moments. The ending helped pull it off.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I liked this story very much. It shows that this one was 'simmering' for a while, because it is very developed. Not too much gore, not too explicit, but just right.  For me, this approach fit well with the content of the story. I would have liked just a bit more about the mechanics of everything, but perhaps this is better--that wasn't the story focus anyway.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I loved it! The graphics are beautiful! The whole story is evocative of a faraway fairyland! It keeps you on your toes!
B0096HL33G|1.0|The movie offered nothing new.  Story was depressing.  I watched the movie because I'm a fan of Rachel Weisz but there was nothing in the movie to hold my interest.
0385349947|1.0|This book is supposedly written as a means to encourage girls to grow up to be women who want to lead things...and is based on the premise that if only our society invested more energy in convincing girls to go against what for many are their natural inclinations, all would be right with the world.  Regardless of whether you agree with the premise or not, the fact is that this book is poorly written, poorly argued, illogical, full of thinly veiled misandry, appeals to emotion, and seems to completely fail to realize the irony in proclaiming that women are just as good as men...if only society will brainwash them into acting like men.  If you already believe strongly that women ought to run the planet, then you probably will overlook all of this.  But if you are generally unbiased and simply want to pick this book up to see what all the fuss is about...beware, you will wish you hadn't. Not even John Stewart tonight could conceal his revulsion in having to listen to this harpy for less than 10 minutes.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a book that totally puts you through every emotion possible!! You are at you highest high and your lowest low all within the same book!! It will build your heart up, break it to pieces and the put it all back together again!! Wonderfully written! I have read it three times now and I cannot put it down each time!! Buy this book...you will not be disappointed!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Excellent book for those that have been deployed, or know or have been apart of the military life. Thank you Mr. Kyle for all you have done!
B009LMBVTW|3.0|This is a review of the Keyhole CD release KHCD9001 Nov. 2012 of The Velvet Underground/La Cave 1968 \\"Problems In Urban Living.\\" This recording has been in the bootleg and trading circles for about 15 years; it was first released under the present title by Scorpio Gold Standard Records SCD-1, 1996. It's great to see it here more or less available commercially. The sound quality is fair, which is to say it's not very good, but it's not poor. It's a historic date for the VU, it's the first gig Doug Yule played with them. If you've already heard [[ASIN:B000001FOD Velvet Underground Live 1969 volume 1]], [[ASIN:B000001FOE Live 2]], [[ASIN:B000WS8AUC The Velvet Underground Bootleg Series Volume 1: The Quine Tapes]], and [[ASIN:B00124JDHY Live At Max's Kansas City (Deluxe Edition) (US Release)]],you already know how this is going to sound. If you're a VU fan who hasn't purchased this as a vinyl or CD bootleg, get it NOW, you won't regret it.
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|I would use this as often as I can live the news articles an  the fact I can underground different sources.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down.  I  thought it was amazing the way it grabbed me and took me on a emotional journey.  It was tense and interesting at the same time.
0307730697|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in long time.  I found it both inspiring and stimulating.  This book takes you through the life of a true American hero.  Adam Brown overcame more adversity than most can even imagine.  He not only met the challenges but triumphed over them to become one of the elite of America’s elite warriors.  Knowing the history behind the men who insisted this story be told and the sacrifices they made to share it with the author prior to their last deployment emphasizes the strength of character Adam Brown exhibited.  I have recommended this book to my children and co-workers.  This is truly must read!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I kept hearing about Downton Abbey and decided to give it a look see. I started with Season I and worked my way through Season II. Streaming from Amazon was great - no commercials!
B00866JL96|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this movie, but I did and ended up buying it and now my daughter and her college buddies have it and won't return it. So, I guess I will have to buy my own copy...? Very sweet, romantic, and a little cheesy. Nice make-out scene. Good humor too.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Everyone knows by now about the Facebook app and how you don't get the full site but easily can if u sign in the main acct and not the app. I would recommend the app to all social network nuts who can't seem to stay off of Facebook. I on the other hand can live without it.
B00004WG2F|5.0|I mean &#34;Tristan&#34; says the little &#34;half-gofer&#34; girl in the movie. Funny. I said the same thing about him almost 20 years ago when I first saw this film. I love the scenery, the actors (Pitt and Hopkins are my faves), the script, and the music. I really would have waited for ol' crazy Tristan to calm the bear inside of him. Ha! Brad Pitt is finer than a mofo okay. Romantic and tragic movie. I am sure everyone and their literal momma named their daughter or son Tristan after this movie. lol Good lord! I have a lot of favorite scenes, but nothing really makes me cheer like the scene when he returns home in the suit with his long flowing locks. Woo hoo! Tristan...
B00BF11STU|3.0|The depiction of the background story and the narrative showing the complexity of the discovery and final resolution of UBL was well done, comprehensive and interesting.  The obligatory F-bombs in the dialogue during the later conflict portion of the screenplay as it headed toward the climax detracted from my overall appreciation of this work.  Viewing more than once is truly an individual choice.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|This was a really good movie based upon a true story and I love Brad Pitt in it. I am glad to make this a part of my collection of movies.
B001NLKT60|5.0|It was a little hard getting past the background in the first book (Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) but once I did I could put this series down. I loved the way it was written even though you can tell it was translated. The characters are very relatable! Loved it!!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Chris Hemsowrth is a handsome, rising star obviously. I did not expect to like it, but I liked him as Thor, I loved his love interest and her humor, and thank you for having Anthony Hopkins in this movie and Idris Elba. What? It is almost too much to handle!  Great actors throughout. I must thank the directors for the scene where Chris Hemsworth was shirtless. Yes, lawwd! Great movie. Glad to add it to my collection of movies.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|Kindle fire hd. Won't download the rest of the game when I open the app. Freezes at 61185 kb every time. Fix please!!!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|great entertainment. denzel at his best. If you are a fan of his you''ll love this one. the beginning is riveting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|An entertaining and interesting glimpse into a totally different world.  Wish there were more episodes. Looking forward to season 4.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a great hidden object game! Most others are delayed or too easy. This is overall a good game.
B00BJENK62|3.0|First, I have to say that I love my Kindle Fire and I love Lonely Planet.  But this is a case of two great tastes that DON'T taste great together.  The book is wonderful but I can't use it easily on my Kindle.  The maps are completely useless (yes, they tell you that you can get the maps on PDF from the website, for free, but that is inconvenient.  Also, it's a fine idea to have activated links, so you can click through the links to the museums, hotels, etc., but it is NOT a good idea to have so many hyperlinks within the book itself.  You cannot see more than one thing in the same city easily.  I had to go to a bookstore and buy a paper copy because I just couldn't work with the Kindle version.<br /><br />Second, I am satisfied, though not thrilled, with the contents of the book.  Korea is a major tourist destination and there are literally thousands of hotels and restaurants, museums and attractions to choose from.  This book includes a helpful map of Seoul and information on many important sites, but there are so many more which could/should be included.  The guidebook for Korea should be bigger overall.  In the paper edition, the blue writing is sometimes difficult to use, but the maps are helpful (not just Seoul, all over Korea) and I'm easily able to find my way around with the help of this book.<br /><br />If not for the problem with the Kindle Edition, I would probably have rated this book a 4.  I still recommend it for anyone, but it's best to be careful about which edition you choose.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Received perfectly and on time. The item looks beautiful and as is shown in the foto.  I will buy again from this merchant.
B001CL4N68|5.0|One of the best albums of all time. NAS is definitely one of the top MC's of our time. AWESOME!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Received perfectly and on time. `The music is excellent, his voice is very soft and the vocalization is amassing.  I recommend it
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I'm astonished by the negative reviews that have been posted here.<br /><br />Every one of the 17 songs are pure Dido, which means they are perfect. Are they different from her previous three CDs? Yes, of course! I suspect that if they weren't, reviewers would be complaining - \\"same old thing.\\" I'm not all that partial to Rap music but the minimal bit in one song works for me. After all, Dido caught the attention of the world by Eminem using a refrain from her song \\"Thank You\\" in his Rap tune, \\"Stan.\\"<br /><br />I loved \\"No Angel.\\" I loved \\"Life For Rent.\\" I loved \\"Safe Trip Home.\\" I love \\"Girl Who Got Away.\\" Each of her CDs are a reflection of her life experience and I've related to each one. Her life is not static and her songs reflect this.<br /><br />Dido is one of only two artists whose music I buy without ever hearing any of the songs beforehand. Tina Dico is the other one. I have never been disappointed.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this CD in February and the minute I received it, I put it in my CD player and played it continually for two days, dancing around the house. I love dancing to Dido's music. I just imported the CD into my iTunes and synced it to my iPod so I can take it with me wherever I go.<br /><br />This is a solid 5-star CD and I love it!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I loved the musical, but the raw, human adaptation for film is a fresh take on a story and soundtrack that are already so powerful.  In my opinion, this should have won best picture.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book the story was well written throughout and trilogy (I saw the movie version but I prefer the book)  - also, the trilogy had a perfect ending!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Well I wanted to watch house of Anubis at 7:00 so I set it at 6:45 and on the loudest sound but It didn't wake me or sister up and I'm a light sleeper my is kinda a light sleeper .
0062101897|5.0|As a film student I find this book amazing and insightful! I loved reading about how they filmed the entire series!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is really good the county you run in changes every month or so I'm addicted and my brother is always asking to play. GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|A little slow, confusing in the beginning.  Guess I outgrew this type of romance. More for teenagers because it was so predictable.
B008JFUPK8|1.0|we've been disappointed for choosing Henry Cavil instead of Tom Welling , he did a really great job in smallville and 10 years of experience and he has alot of fans all around the world whats happening here ! henry has only one success on his movie immortal and tom welling has 10 success on his 10 seasons of superman series , anw its too late for discuss this subject
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Easy read.  Character development is shallow and the growth of them is typical.  Nothing new here.  If you are looking for something fun and brainless, as I sometimes am, this is a it.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is addictive love this game four stars in my opinion. I would give it five if  u could earn more then just one gold bar for each level.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Like it in B&W or like it in color, your choice. But with this set you get the choice. This movie is an annual event every Christmas at our house. If there is anyone out there that has never seen this movie -- shame on you! This is what all family movies should be like. Always makes me feel like a million bucks. What a classic!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|FABULOUS!!! A must read. Totally riveting from first page to last. I loved the characters who were beautifully developed this was a sad story but wonderfully told and completely realistic. One of the best books I have read this year. You might need a box of kleenex nearby though.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I got these for a great price. If you are a Star Trek fan from the original series, you will love these. Although they were marked as used when I opened the package two of the three were still in the original plastic. The 1st season package had the plastic removed but was in perfect (mint) condition. I am really happy with this purchase.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If Victorian chick flicks are your cup of tea then this is a good one. These stupid reviews have a minimum word requirement so this content was added.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Been a Trekkie all my life. Great to see them again. And so easy! Great on an HD TV. Thanks
B004KBSQBA|5.0|This is classic Simon. For anyone who likes Paul Simon, this album is a must for the collection. Diamonds on the Soles of her Shoes, Myth of Fingerprints, and Call Me Al are a tour d force of a driving beat and sharp lyrics, and Graceland is a soft and beautifully written ode to family ties. Amazon's version has three bonus cuts.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Decent, but I hope the graphics get better with future versions.  But maybe the graphics are intentionally primitive to keep the game easily portable across platforms.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Thinking, Fast and Slow, in my opinion, will last for awhile. It is not like current books whose notions and conclusions are temporary. It is written a little more scientific than typical modern books that explain interesting topics to the masses. This book covers interesting topics such as how we take risk, how we understand and conclude things, why we choose what we choose, that luck is also a factor and how our instinct in many cases is worthless. After reading, I truly felt that we are more automatic than we think. As a salesman, I implement many of the conclusions this book offers. It helped me truly understand why a person would choose my product over others. The book is written decently though the flow is not always easy to follow. However, I still think it is a mandatory read and a true eye opener.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game! Love that you can play forever and don't run out of time or lives or have to wait around for your friends to send you things.  Love the missions!
B0080MJYR0|5.0|Sexy movie which was i think kind of ground breaking for it s odd theme at the time, or at least that is my memory. The anti Vietnam war woman that posed on a North Vietnamese anti aircraft weapon and Women's rights activist would probably like a do over on this part of her career with Husband director Roger Vadim but at that time I couldn't help but like her beautiful figure and quirky humour of the film
0345525558|4.0|great condition. book is sad, see my review. wonder why people continue to be so destructive. but well written, I couldn't put it down. thank you sak 66 and the lore re flowers is great. sak66
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I can't believe there is anyone left on the planet who hasn't seen this show. It is incredible. And there is something in it for everyone. I have forced my DVDs upon people who don't even like science fiction, and even they end up loving this show.  Genius storytelling, great acting, just the right balance of comedy and drama. Think cowboys in space don't make sense? Think again - this is probably the most realistic sci fi / futuristic show you will ever see.  Do yourself a favor and watch this. Or don't - because if you do, you will be terribly sad that it was limited to one very short season.
B008133MDK|5.0|Killer ending. I can't wait for season three. The storytelling is really well done and the acting is really well done.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A definite page turner ... Could not put it down!!  Not a typical Stephen King so even if you are not a King fan you will love this book.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|I understand the comments criticizing this for being impervious to the suffering of the locals, although there are some attempts at conveying the magnitude of the disaster for the people actually living where the tsunami hit.<br />But the movie is still a success, efficient and almost thrilling in its tale of a miraculous survival. The actors do a great job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome!!!! I love playing it it's really fun. Thank you for the making the awesomest game ever
B000FBJHZS|4.0|Dan Brown does his usual great job of developing characters and plot.  This is a fun read that contains enough scientific explanations to make the major event believable.  Gets a little too close to sci-fi at the boat episode, but still fun to read.  Thanks for some great entertainment, Dan.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the best of the 3 books. I loved how everything came together & the intrigue throughout kept me wanting more !!
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I enjoyed the book- good read- light and dark all at the same time! Much like the cable series.<br />M
B00B7G3Y4U|2.0|After 3 of these, it's easy to know what is coming next, and that it is building up to a big finish. Only this time, it seems like they ran out of creativity for the big finish. I won't spoil it, but will only say &#34;Seriously!?&#34;<br /><br />Up until the finish though, the suspense is decent. The use of the XBox Kinect was clever. But you find yourself disappointed that once again there are a couple people who see everything, and a couple people who don't believe them, even when it's right in front of them. &#34;A knife just fell from the ceiling? Meh, I think I'll just go back to bed.&#34;
B001EBV0MG|5.0|I have watched this movie many times since my Dad told me to watch it years ago. There are many classic lines and great filming especially for its time.
B005LAIHR2|2.0|Hm, I'm not really sure what to think. I was a teenager in the 80s (graduated in 1987 in Northern California) and this didn't quite catch the mood, fashions, hair, songs, well hell, nearly everything about this was all wrong...Tom Cruise (often very funny in this role), Alec Baldwin and Paul Giacomo are OK, given what material they're working with.  Russell Brand irritates the hell out of me -there was an annoying monkey in the movie that was equally bad to have to sit through. With Brand, the camera stays on him as though everything he does is so precious (and it's not).<br /><br />I liked the Tower Records scenes...wow that brought back memories!!!<br /><br />Julianne Hough is ultra-cute but damn, her voice...so squeaky -grated on my nerves after the first scene -her singing is awful too. The role that she has relies on showing off her body and less on what she has to bring to the character of Sherrie.  She and \\"Drew\\" are really awful, there's ZERO chemistry between these two.<br /><br />Mary J Blige shouldn't have been in here. I like the story line, the transition from rock into pop and the music industry. But the movie just doesn't work. Catherine Zeta-Jones is OK too.<br /><br />This movie is just corny. Oh, and I'm no prude, but the exaggerated tongue-kissing is actually really gross...LOL<br /><br />The end credits are kind of cool, there's a drawing done of the main characters (and the monkey).
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Good to read literature from a bygone era, and experience how people thought and acted. I can recommend this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I really do love it and have gotten so many good ideas from it.  My granddaughter said you have to have this on your computer and of course, being a bit older I thought this was just for younger people but much to my surprise I found a million things I was interested in.
B000MV9026|3.0|The first part of the movie (read that, the first hour) was an adorable movie. The hero comes of age and wins the girl, they get together, and are happy, and it could have ended right there as a complete story.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Like many others, Grisham is my favorite pop author.  He makes his characters and stories come alive. This book had great character development and some good twists, but did not have the dynamic plot I am used to.  Sorry, John.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Done with elegance and style. These two women show great chemistry together. A movie you will cherish and never forget.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Interesting stories but the photography and staging were my favorite parts, especially on HD large screen TV.  Will watch the next season.
B000MGATTE|5.0|I loved it.  Couldn't  wait to read it at the end of my workday.  Well written,I could visualize the scenes as I read the pages. I loved the wording like &#34;bool&#34;,&#34;SOWISA&#34;,&#34;Boo'ya Moon&#34;.  The book was captivating!
B003CYKCHW|5.0|arrived very carefully packed and seemed pretty exciting. it was for my boyfriend and he loved it! hes planning to buy RAT 9 now
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This app is one of my all time tabs.  Never boring always a challenge without any stress. What's not to like?
B00740FMTS|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone interested in reading about the Bioshock universe.  You will learn about the birth of Rapture and of its down falls.  I read this book after playing the video game.  Upon completing the book it has made me want to play the original game over again, to relive and revisit Rapture and its characters.  This was a really good book to read, clearing up many of my unanswered questions while playing the game.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I'm now hooked on this story...  Started to watch after everybody was saying how much they enjoyed this - they were right!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie is not funny at all, it is extremely tasteless to say the least. It is a wast of your money. I gave it one star because I could not give it 0.
0316226424|4.0|Wonderful book, great seller.  Had a small problem with the type of book we were interested in, but no problem in getting things corrected. Very good store to do business with. We do addition business with them in the future.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|When friends told us about watching Downton Abbey it just didn't initially sound like a program we would want to spend this much time watching.  We finally caught the first episode and were caught up in its spell.<br /><br />It is so well written and acted.  Since we did not start with the beginning we have now worked our way through sesion 1 and 2 and will start 3 next week.<br /><br />Don't miss it.
B003NFM3JU|1.0|It is most likely made from a 2D film so the 3D effect is weak.<br /><br />The film does not present Christmas as a happy thing to children. They won't view Christmas as a happy event after viewing the film. Not recommended for small children.<br /><br />It is an &#34;aduldlized&#34; children film.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Great viewing over and over again. The season opener kept me in suspense. Shiva and Abby's search for meaning impressive.
B00821OX98|5.0|GREAT story. If man was to face an alien attack we would defiantly need help to get over it. Extraterrestrial attacking earth our resources has to be their only goal and recruiting the natives of the planet they're raiding. To continue their journey they'll need a way to refuel their resources. That is if we are attacked by aliens from another world and they desire our resources.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Fun, and involved, it takes time and patience if you don't want to pay for stars, oil, etc. Overall good game for free, I recommend if you like command and conquer type games.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|First: I like long books with interesting themes.  I enjoyed getting to know the characters of the previous books (even though I had to refer to a cheat sheet at times to keep them all straight).  BUT:  This book was a nightmare of fog and misdirection.  The introduction of new characters scattered my focus on the plot...oh, that's right, the plot was somewhere in the fog.  I wanted to scream &#34;HODOR&#34; at times.  Will there be some sort of last book that will finally make sense of it all?  One can hope.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|They could really make a great movie out of this book! Couldn't see the photos very well in the kindle edition though.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|The game is cool but when I play it glitches non stop. That is why I gave the 4 stars.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game it's hard some time but l like the challenge.<br />So time I have to play 10 times before I win but when I do it's great.<br /><br />S
B00004VVND|4.0|This has always been kind of a favorite sci-fi thriller at our house and although the acting isn't really top shelf, the storyline makes up for that in our opinion. I think it holds up fairly well to the test of time and is still enjoyable to view now and then.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Even with a no talent only has work in Hollywood cause his father is who is he is hack like Roman Coppola sharing the screenwriting credit, Wes Anderson pulled off a great film. Ed Norton and Bruce Willis have solid performances and it has all the Catcher in the Rye'sque feel of Anderson's other films.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|The concept of the game is great, but it hardly ever saves the game where you leave off and I've not seen an option to manually save it.
B000H5TVJY|1.0|Was very disappointed to discover that the above DVD was not region compatible so therefore I can not watch it
B003O86FMW|5.0|Twists and turns as I never expected! I am not going to be able to wait to read book 3!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed this Grisham book.  I was very excited by his first body of works, but he started giving the plots a twist I wasn't into.  This book rates among The Firm & A Time to Kill.
B000FC0ZAI|1.0|So I bought this thinking it was the novel the movie was based on.  Similar title.  Sort of like how Tom Clancy stole the title of my 1998 book, \\"THREAT VECTOR.\\"  I gave it a chance, but it was awful.  As Publisher's Weekly said, \\"unlikely adventures.\\"  Unlikely, indeed.  The author takes forever to get to the point, and when he does, it's an anticlimax.  If you love stories that dilly-dally and go nowhere, great, this is for you.  As for me, I like a book that has something to say and a cool way to say it.  Hemingway this guy ain't.<br /><br />Michael DiMercurio<br />Author of \\"EMERGENCY DEEP\\" and other awesome novels<br />michael.dimercurio@gmail.com
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Liked it! The level of drama was a bit much for me but my husband and children seemed to like it a lot.
B000JBWWQ0|3.0|IF....you've read the book series, this movie is just a quick overview.  There is so much left out from the books as far as explaining why things are happening.  I understand that the movie can't devote all the time required and therefore rated this as I did.<br /><br />If you have NOT read the books, this could be a much more favorable experience and might even influence you to begin reading it.<br />I'm glad I have it to play and renew thoughts about the book periodically.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is beast and if you like this game you are awesome all it needs is more updates quick
B004SH40BQ|4.0|This product delivers great sound, is easy to use, and sturdy, but the audio quality will eventually start to lessen over time. So use it wisely. If you can stand to wear headphones, do it. Use this thing when you really need it and it will last a long time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever! I love this game it's awesome except for the part when I'm ran over by a train.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know the all the unique characters, following their struggles and fierce commitment to their families and community. The beautiful scenery and authentic costumes were a visual treat.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|we love this game, it's fun to build your points and beable to buy different things in the game. it is really challenging not to die and have to start over. it gives you goals so you can move up in the game. i play it all the time and my 4 year old grandson really likes it, he's better than i am.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This definitely explains the process step by step. This will make setting up easier, and getting your book ready for Kindle simpler.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|In each and everyone of us there is a God &#34;hole&#34;. This movie/shows the movement of God in our spirit and how even the most lowly and base person can find Him by being in the presence of those who have found their Creator and follow in His Way. Redemption, forgiveness, mercy and salvation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead keeps you on the edge of your seat, never know what's gonna happen, really a great show to watch
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|I need to watch this movie annually at the least. It stops me in my tracks and asks the big questions of what am I, who am I, and why am I here. The Truth is not something; It is Someone. That Someone is Jesus Christ.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ok so it's Awesome but it won't let me log in help me log in someone the (:  and I love playing with my brother I love it I need to know the password
B004AHNIGM|5.0|This guy has got better with age.  Great album, up there with Dr Johns 'Loaded' as one of the albums of the year.
140053271X|5.0|The Nook simple touch e-book does all it purports.  I had a few difficult moments trying to download some books.  I am not that computer savvy yet but I managed. I viewed a how-to video to find out about other functions of the book.  I am still learning. Nook could provide some sort of introductory leaflet describing how to access the e-book's different functions. I look the book and enjoy reading while waiting at the Doctor's office, etc.
B007N85ZXY|3.0|Young Neil exercising his fertile imagination once more.  Interesting work that doesn't quite reach greatness, but certainly worth a listen.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great for anyone who wants to go on Facebook on the go. You can chat with your friends and say what your thinking.
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|A solid album from the grand master of modern American poetic rock.  Not quite to the standard of some recent works but a must have for any fan.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Great game I recommend it to anyone great to pass the time with and is super fun I love it
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Amazing example of his body of work.  Tracks that didn't make one of his finest albums, and how they have stood the test of time.  Some interesting original versions of tracks the were reworked on later albums.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Anyone who enjoys chess would like this app I enjoy how you can change the difficulty and I can play with another person.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What a great action/love story. I was hoping the whole time Katniss and Peeta would end up together. What great stories.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It is so fun, I love to play it to pass time. It is a great time killer I would definitely recommend it
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great App love then big buttons, so easy to use and easy to read with great big buttons and display :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love how there are many different setting in the game and how you can buy fifteenth people and that's what I like about this gamr
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have been watching Game of thrones on HBO. I was surprised to see the show is closely following the book. Can't wait to start the 2nd book.
0143119680|5.0|Really enjoyed this book - excellently written and quite clever; a fun read.  Sort of a cross between Harry Potter and Twilght in it's \\"other-worldliness\\".  As soon as I finished it, I passed it on to other family members and then promply downloaded the 2nd book.  Speaking of which, being about half way through \\"Shadow of Night\\", I'm not as thrilled with it as \\"A Discovery of Witches\\". While I enjoy the historical details, I feel she's put too much focus on that and not enough on progression of the plot.  But still enjoying it, and will read the 3rd when published.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the greatest shows I've ever seen. Great characters and great storylines all tied in tj historical events in the early 20th century.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a huge fan of the comic book, and am eager to pick up the next issue.  That being said Walking Dead TV show is an amazing departure from the comic book.  Using some of the same characters but either expanding and/or contracting their stories is being down beautifully.  That addition of other characters not seen in the book could've been a major risk, but they are also so well written you can't imagine the story developing without them.<br /><br />Keeps you on your toes with each new episode, this is an excellent addition into Television history.
B0064QNS62|2.0|Ummm... REALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!????<br />WHAT IN GODS NAME IS THIS LITTLE P.O.S.???<br /><br />Retro, yea ok!!! I can see how you could call this &quot;Retro&quot;.If this is what the developer is calling his game &quot;Retro&quot;, then I would hate to have seen &quot;Marv The Miner 1&quot;!!! That is probably even worse than this P.O.S.!!!
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I presume the author is quite young. Characters and situations are very predictable and poorly developed. Outcomes of critical events resolve themselves as hoped, but the reader is left with lingering doubts as to how it happened and why. Unique talents and strengths are manifest and then not re-used or developed. There is no gradual strengthening of the characters. The geographic setting lacks any type of realism or understanding of space and time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just turn on the light, get a drink, and have your page turning hand locked and loaded.  The book will do the rest.  Like most Grisham novels, there is a smoothness and pace that makes reading his books an effortless experience.  I had the flu when I read this and it helped get me through the ordeal.  Highly recommended
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't know what to expect but wound up loving this book.  During the Easter holidays, while having lots of house guests, I would wait for everyone to retire and then hide out in the bathroom reading a few more chapters.  I did not find the characters particularly likeable but the author has created a very cleverly thought out and unusual piece of work for we readers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end of each chapter pulls you into the beginning of the next. Awesome read! Couldn't put it down! 5 stars
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game is okay. I play it to kill time. I am only reviewing this game so I will not be prompted to review the game anymore.
B0013FBS20|5.0|Will smith is my favourite actor and this is one of his best films i've seen (with I, Robot).<br />5 stars are the right vote for this film which i found really interesting.<br />Cant wait for the sequel or prequel I Am Legend 2!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House was WONDERFUL.  I loved following the story lines of so many characters.  I was really able to connect to all of them and I really had a hard time putting the book down. I just wanted to keep reading to the end and find out what happened to each and every character.  If you liked the kind of character development in the popular Downton Abbey you will love this.  Completely different era but the same fantastic interweaving of the lives of all the characters.  Read and Enjoy!
B008NEMN0K|5.0|One of the greatest films i've seen in my life. Maybe the best Will Smith's film he has done till now.<br />Let's hope for a sequel too!<br />Buy it and you won't regret it
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|My ancestors were from Scandinavia.  I know the history, and the research put into the characters, their culture, government, language and names are very accurate.  As an archeologist I know that we have a lot of material culture excavated from many Viking sites.  The boats depicted on the show depict  what we have found...we've reconstructed whole boats!  Their technology in boat making was amazing.  Their understanding of things that were valuable to them is found in burial sites, and depicted in this series. Even the haircuts are accurate.<br />I also like a mult-level charcter, such as the main character.  You are in love with his family, yet hate his barbarism. You cheer for them, yet you pity their victims  for their flagrant disregard for those they raided, raped and pillaged. (sort of like Lestat in Interview with a vampire...but at least that character did not CHOOSE to be what he is, so you pity him)<br />Yet, you admire the main character's drive and creativity to find a new way to sail west, when everyone said no lands lay there. The ancient navigation system is so simple, yet blew my mind.<br />I love the captured priest character, and cant wait to see how his role within the Viking village develops.<br />This is a good series because it tells a good STORY.  I'm an author too, so I know the elements of good story telling, and this is it.<br />I'd like to see better character development because I still struggle with hating the characters they are trying to make me love, because of their barbarism.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|A cussing, lying, conniving, profane politician; who often tries to be witty with homespun tales-but lacks the practical wisdom to chose appropriate times or tasteful anecdotes.  This is the Spielberg \\"Lincoln\\"; who looks so much like. . ..well, just like us today.  But since that was obviously Spielberg's intention, along with trying to make an oblique comparison between his beloved \\"B.A.\\" and 'Lincoln\\"- who, according to Spielberg, was also a deal making, power grabbing, constitution breaking criminal; he handily succeeded in wrenching truth from the hands of History and bending the sacred metal into a form that could be pleasing and appealing to a \\"modern\\" audience with similar values as those portrayed in his version of the times.  But I for one, was not looking for such a treatment of the man, nor the times.  I wasn't anticipating a general ignoring or manipulation of facts by a purposeful highlighting of that which would tend to demean and by an obscuring of that which would obviously ignoble the men and the times.  It wasn't only Lincoln who suffered in this history revision; but also poor senator Thaddeus Stevens.  Made out to be a self serving, fornicator; who crawls into his bed at night with his unmarried African American partner.  Never-mind that there is ZERO internal evidence that such a relationship existed; but OUR dirty, dingy hypocritical minds cannot imagine a time of self restraint, dignity and honor when Greatness could not only be celebrated, but could be FOUND.  About the only historical accuracy that I saw, outside of the overall timeline of events, was the fact that the Democrats were on the wrong side of morality and justice then. . .just like today.  But this fact is wonderfully minimized by the soiling of the sterling champion of the Right and all on the \\"right\\"; thus making the bigoted Dems. not look quite so bad as their actions and policies have most often been.  It was to our Country's great benefit, that Lincoln was NOT the man thatSpielberg makes him out to be.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I am so addicted to this game! Excellent graphics, excellent sound. Great missions, Fun and opportunities to earn boost cash.Fun. That's all I can say...
1416955070|5.0|Very exciting read. In my opinion it is much better than Harry potter but that's just me. It's more mature than hayrides potter and is written in a better style. But again that's just an opinion. It is a great story and very unique and creative. I have read all of Clare's mortal instruments series and they are all terrific reads! Give it a read, you won't be disappointed! :)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|However, now I know why. It is a well written tale of a woman who takes her own life back. This show pulls no punches. You will not understand what she is doing in her personal life. It will make you cringe. However, she learns she, too has a skill, and it is twice that of any lawyer in her circle - woman or man. It builds her confidence, and allows her to make changes in her own life. This was not watched on the tv in my home. In my new home I know why. Intelligent, couragous women. Strong male rolls also, show that power can indeed corrupt. I am only in the first season. Realistic dialogue and powerful roles for both women and men. True melodrama with light as well as dark moments.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Given the poor quality of a few of the other recent get-togethers I was naturally skeptical. Seeing some of Page's poor quality guitar work, I always have it in the back of my mind that, yeah it's over, he can't do it anymore, \\"can he pull this off\\"?  I am greatly surprised at the quality of this show on every level. They look great, sound great and are quite obviously loving it, and you will too. I put the DVD into my laptop, put on some good quality headfones and let er rip. The deep booming bass played by JPJ is fantastic. This guy is a master musician. Robert looks great, and still hits the notes he needs to. Some of Page's guitar sounds seem to get lost, and some of his playing can't be heard, for whatever reason, it gets muddied over. But he too is hitting the notes, he looks great as well. The show as a whole is totally well done, the fans go nuts. The stage looks cool modern, the lights and video are all there. However I was sorely underwhelmed with the end guitar solo on Stairway, a mere shadow of the Song Remains the Same version-which is the gold standard. Oh well, can't have everything. Page's great \\"Zoso\\" amp clearly visible for the guitar freaks out there. Jason Bonham handles the task well, but I do have to say that I personally don't feel he's really any better than any other rock drummer. Professional yes, good enough to play with Zep yes, and really really neat that he's there to stand in for dad. But that's where the resemblance ends. Jason said in a radio interview 2 years ago that \\"if I sound like my dad it's because he taught me\\". I just don't hear it. Don't look for it, it's not there. He does a great job but I just can't even hear any influence at all. That aside, he does belong.....fantastic concert, I was shockingly surprised at the energy, the tightness and the great attitudes of the guys.....highly highly recommend!
B005Q1W10A|1.0|I gave all three of these dvd's for my out of town daughter for her birthday and while watching the 2nd season, she got to disk three and it was broken. Very disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super game. It is an outstanding trainish game. Rio was the best trip so far! Never delete this app! Greatest app in the world!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I never realized what a Great Human being President Lincoln was, until I saw this Movie! Against all odds,he stood for what he believed in. A great example for all of us! This is I think One of the Best movies. I have seen many movies, countless, and I would definitely say that this was one of the best!  I did not know much about President Lincoln, and I used to wonder what it was about him that people so adored. Now I understand, totally!  I just fell in Love with president Lincoln. God Almighty and exalted, must Love him greatly! He so stood by his Principles!
B00BF11STU|4.0|The movie starts off with a good bit of torture, so if you are very sensitive I wouldn't recommend watching the first twenty minutes.  I would have liked a bit more excitement, but it is based on a true story, so having the main character coax out Bin Ladin's location would have been a bit ridiculous.  The opening scene with the 911 calls from the twin towers got me choked up and took me back to where I was when they were hit.  Overall I would recommend watching it.  If nothing else, it is a reminder of what happened over the course of a decade and the long drug out fight for information that was being fought by usually nameless persons.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I NEVER thought I would like a show with Zombies!!!!  I resisted watching it - but on a snowy day, started to watch in and could not stop!!<br />The third season is even better than the first two!!  Its like potato chips - you can not stop at ONE!!!
0425264351|5.0|Great book!! I love Child's writing style and the character of Jack Reacher. As the story went along, I found myself on edge just waiting....I would tell you more, like what I was waiting for...but if I did, it would spoil the book. Just know that there are some great twists in the book and it does end well. Now to locate the second Reacher book. =)
B002SAS26E|5.0|This is a really fun game to play, especially if you have a non-gamer wife who you are trying to convert... okay, maybe impossible to convert, but at least get to play with you on a regular basis. Will recommend to anyone!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I try to read all of the books going to the big screen.  This book was good but not super.  If you like YA fantasy/paranormal then I would definitely recommend it.
B005H9B44A|4.0|Good action and story! A good watch! Will watch again.  Streaming online worked great. Will use this feature again as well.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|if you like the weird and strange than this show and walter are for you.hope the rest of the seasons don't dissapoint
B009FB3XTA|5.0|This movies was so good I watched it over n over a few times. They really hit it off with this last movie for sure. If u haven't seen it yet get it ASAP.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I do not know why I am obsessed with wipes containers. It's a sickness, I know. Anyhow, I scoured the internet to find the perfect wipes container because I was sure that it was out there...and this one, though riddled with problems, is the closest that I have come to the perfect wipes container.<br /><br />The pros:<br /><br />1) I love the design. It looks modern, contemporary and cute.<br /><br />2) The strap it contains to hang it on your stroller is awesome! It prevents me from having to dig for wipes in the bottom of my diaper bag constantly when I just need to quickly grab a wipe to clean the baby's hands.<br /><br />3) This case holds a lot of wipes, is made of strong, thick plastic and is easy to clean. I hate the thin and poorly made travel Huggies wipes cases that I have used before, which are made from flimsy cheap plastic because you can barely fit any wipes in them. In contrast, the Skip Hop wipes container allows you to store a good amount of wipes in it and its plastic case is very sturdy.<br /><br />The cons:<br /><br />1) The red button that closes the Skip Hop wipes container is CONSTANTLY popping off! And as soon as it pops off the baby will inevitably grab the red button and throw it in a fountain or in some bushes or in some other crazy location which means that I have to hunt around for 10 minutes to find that button.<br /><br />2) When it does stay on, the red button sticks and is hard to slide from open to closed, and vice versa. So, when you are sitting there trying to change the wiggling baby with one hand and trying to open or close this wipes container with the other hand, you can just forget about it. There is no easily accessing the wipes in this container without tugging on the container and causing the red button to pop off into oblivion!<br /><br />3) Wipes tend to dry out if left in this case. The red button closure doesn't seem to seal the wipes in the case in an airtight fashion so if you leave the wipes in the case, you can go to grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe. Not fun!<br /><br />My message to Skip Hop is this: Listen, this could be a GREAT case. You just have to work on increasing the functionality of that troublesome red button and you will have an almost perfect product.<br /><br />To those considering buying this case, call me crazy, but I would still definitely buy it again! Even with some quirks, it is still the best case out there in my opinion. No other case is as stylish as the Skip Hop case, or holds as many wipes with the added bonus of clipping onto the stroller like the Skip Hop case. I just recommend being vigilant about making sure to not lose the red closing button and I recommend adding a bit of extra water to your wipes if you leave them in the case for several days as they may dry out a bit. Follow those tips and voila, you have a fabulous wipes case.o grab them a week later during a messy diaper change and be stuck with a bone dry wipe.

B0089LOKHG|2.0|I completly enjoyed the first two in this series, and was EAGERLY awaiting the last in the series. I can remember parts of the first two that I read long ago, but after finishing this one, not much sticks out in my mind. Not nearly enough tension between the men competing for Lena. It was kind of a sideline, even after the last book ends with a real cliff hanger concerning one of them. I was very dissapointed to say the least. I at first was going to rate a 3 star, but the more I thought about it, the more I remembered how good the first two were, the madder I got at the drivel we had put out for us in this one. I know the author has talent, and there was plenty to go on from the end of the second book, so why why why gives us this? Why not wait til you wrote it right?  This seems rushed to just get the proceeds from the sales of this one and just getting rid of Lena, Alex and everyone else. I am sorry that I waited anxiously for this one. What a waste of time and talent. Yuck!
0446615641|4.0|I really enjoy the Camel Club (even though I am reading backwards as started with #4 Divine Justice). Olive Stone (Carr) is quite the character and is unstoppable! Annabelle (another Camel Club) is also involved in this thriller by David Baldacci. I look forward to reading the other books in the series! (the audio is fabulous, the sound effects and the narrator is one of my favorites!
B009GEDP26|5.0|I hope Castle continues for another 5 years. GREAT show.  I love the writing.  The actors are fantastic together.  Great chemistry
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I never heard of this show but decided to watch it because it was classified as sci-fi.  The show is really good.
B0074VA2T2|3.0|We were really excited to get this app, the concept is good but there was so much more that could have been done to make it more interesting. It asks the child to tap the foods to 'eat' them for the caterpillar. DD3 was frustrated because she wanted to 'feed them to the caterpillar' and have him eat them like in the book. It is also fairly repetitive. The illustrations are just as amazing as the original story and for this reason it gets three 1/2 stars
B005NPCUC8|5.0|This album is timeless and the remaster makes it sound better than ever.  If you only have one Pink Floyd album in your collection, this is the one you should have.  Simply EXCELLENT!
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I purchased this item to go along with my Synology Diskstation 1812+, installed without any hiccups and has been not caused me any issues.
1400052181|5.0|Great book and well worth any amount of money you might pay for it.  I was amazed by the amount of investigating done by the author and fascinated by her journey with the Lacks family.  It will change the way you view your own body and any rights you may feel entitled to with it.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|somewhat like the matrix  and the story line was good  ilove christan slater he is a wonderful actor the action sceens were fantastic ithink any time you try to supress people there will always be turmoil and reprecussions .especially when you have members of the family your spouse and children living and fear of each other there could be only one out come chaos and rebellion i think any one who like movies will like movies will enjoy this if they like action this is a must see movie. eddietootoojr

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this season/series.  I would recommend it to my friends--In fact, I have recommended it to my friends.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|what do i have to say about a movie that clearly did what it promised.  it again brought back the best action stars and paired them with guys that should had been 10 years ago!  you get it all from the 80's straight to the in your face of now!
B005H9B44A|4.0|good full of action ya da ya da lots of words to review for main stream movie like I said good
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved Downton Abbey! The characters were well-developed and beautifully costumed.  The storyline was interesting and details of the era just amazing.  There was just enough humor to break the tension, and just the right amount of historical fact to make it realistic.  The acting was superb.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|I enjoy almost any and all shows centering on dance and this one did not disappoint.<br />So You Think You Can Dance star dancers Twitch and Kathryn McCormick, along with Mia Michaels are in it.  Need I say more?:)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a fun game that tests your reflexes and reaction times. I have found this game very addictive, and my kids love it to.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Boring and long ......the style is ..too much of his boring info alternated with her boring info,,<br />I can' finish it! I have read nine hundred page novels with out wanting to put them<br />down, I don't want to pick this one up. To  enjoy a book , you have to care what happens<br />to the characters and I don't care!!!!!!!!<br /><br />  Cheryl Myers
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is great for calculating my answers when I check my homework.<br /><br />It's also fun to just type random math problem.
B005VPRG10|5.0|My 10 year old son loves all the Star Wars Legos.  He says they're fun to put together and they look so realistic!
B0017VG69U|5.0|Loved it!  View it every chance I get!  Miss  &#34;Bones&#34; and &#34;Scotty&#34; more each year. Love to watch Shatner in his prime.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I received my CD well before expected date.  I listened to all the songs this morning.  This man has an incredible voice, loved all the songs.  Two of the songs actually brought me to tears, Anema E Core and La Vie En Rose, they were so special.  I did not understand a word he sang, except, I think it was two of them in English.  I purchased for Perfidia and loved them all.
B008476HBM|5.0|I must admit I was bored with the first half of the book. As the necessity of groundwork became apparent in the second half, I began to appreciate all of it. A most enjoyable read, I recommend it vigorously.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|does a nice job check it out every time i fire up.  alarms are good to alert you to yoour predetermined level
B007BVOEPI|2.0|Why do they take a great fantasy story and turn it into a sleazy hollywood event!?  I won't be watching this series.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I read the books and have seen all the movies, great stuff.  I was so involved, I was counting down the days until the final movie.  I am now having withdrawal from no Twilight!
1612183956|1.0|I obviously missed something.  The book had a great premise, look for missing agent, weird things happen if he gets too close to the truth.  There were a lot if ways this could have gone and the author picked the most unbelievable one possible.  I love XFiles, but this was one of the worst books I have ever read.  Don't waste your time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and had a hard time putting it down.  Am looking forward to reading the last book in the series.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Zero Dark Thirty is a well acted, filmed, directed and edited film.  The pacing is excellent and the story is told without over dramatization.  Jessica Chastain and a fine cast of supporting actors deliver dialogue in a good script that in itself is worthy of kudos.  There are no wasted words and no 'filler' moments in the film.  Even though we know how the story ends your interest is kept at a high level via this tight film that has no frills, bells or whistles to get in the way of a super tale.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Although I could see the ending coming, it was still somewhat surprising. The only weak spot was that I never really understood the motives behind Jacob's actions.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Book three was entirely superfluous.  It added llittle to the story that could have and should have been no later than book two.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Only had these a few hours and I LOVE them. The entire music spectrum is CLEAN. There are no exaggerations on lows, middle and high end. Everything is alive sounding. I'm 61 years young, and I'm turned off by the exaggerated bass I hear everywhere today. Music has a wonderful spectrum to be heard, not drowned out by exaggerated lows or highs. These headphones will deliver this quality. Go for it!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Very durable Motherboard. Looks great. Has awesome specs. It does the job and at a great price.<br />Running an fx-8350, Gigabyte 7950 3gb Graphics, 32gb Corsair Ram 1600mhz, 120 SSD samsung 840, AX850 PSU, Coolermaster v6 gt, highest temp using prime 95 @4.2 ghz 47 Celcius.

B009FZFONO|5.0|This series just keeps getting better as seasons go on.<br /><br />Great character development, and lots of action. They've found the perfect mix for a hit.
B009FZFONO|3.0|Decent but dragged on. GOV should have been dead 3 shows ago and moved on to the next subject. Not happy with the season finally.
B002U5HKZ6|1.0|I loved this novel. India is brought to life through well developed setting and by characters who will stay with the reader for a long time.
B001NKI60W|5.0|All time favorite flick to lift mood to happy smiles!!  This cancer/leukemia patient can always rely on &#34;Mamma Mia&#34; to lift me back to positive outlook and improve smiles.  Chair dances improve to improv dancing :8-))
B009G3T01M|5.0|As a person who's near to middle-aged, I relish the fact that I can enjoy  rap and excellent music.  Not only is the music original, but the message is good as well. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis make you want more-can't wait for the next recording. In the meantime I'll contemplate wearing your grand dad's clothes....
B009LMTDL0|5.0|On a rare personal day, I caught Ms. Sandberg on some ABC talk show, was mesmerized and downloaded while she was still on.  I've just finished, and the book truly opened my eyes to how I've held myself back all these years in so many ways.  I resonated with so much of the content, and was especially intrigued by the &#34;Howard/Heidi&#34; experiment and how pervasive gender stereotypes and biased thinking continue to be some of the greatest challenges women of all ages continue to face while seeking equality as a human being-whatever choices we, as men or women, make that are counter to expected norms.  No one would ever call this a self help book, but I consider it such as it has inspired me to examine my career and to say, &#34;hey, I can do so much more than I've ever given myself credit for!&#34;  I've already recommended it to my book club, the women I work with, and a handful of friends, and to anyone who dreams of a future where opportunities abound regardless of gender, in both career and family.  Also well written, chock full of recent research and factual evidence to back central themes. Well worth the time!
6303011012|5.0|I loved the music. I got elementary children to be interested in music with this vhs. The instruments were discussed and found this to be a great way for exposure.
B002RT2BXQ|2.0|I watched this movie solely to get some idea of the story before I began to read the book.  I wasn't expecting much and I got even less.  As is typical of movies from this era, the acting was about as subtle as a kick to the crotch, the music was too loud and too dramatic, everyone smoked, the dialog was given as robotically as possible.  I will say that the treatment was quite good in that the story did flow nicely.  Using the same script in a modern update would be quite nice.  Unless you intend to read the book, or this is assigned as homework, I wouldn't bother watching it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best way to chill down after a hard days work.  Too bad series three came out all at one time.  Now, I guess we have to wait a much longer time for series four.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|I thought about writing a full fledged review. But I decided to keep it short and to the point. I don't even know what to say about this album. This is something else entirely. I'm trying NOT to listen to it 24 hours a day for fear of spoiling the awesomeness. This is something metalcore has been waiting for, for a long time. Don't get me wrong, I love Howard Jones and I await more music from him, but this is Killswitch Engage, this is what they were meant to be.
0446693804|5.0|This is a beautifully written love story. I couldn't put it down and read it one day. You laugh and then you cry. Very touching!!!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|Great book. The movie followed closely, but of course the book was better. Can't wait to start the next book.
B000NY12LO|4.0|This was really a very sad story to read. I found it to be very upsetting. Who would ever think it would happen again....here in Newtown, CT.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A page turner like Unbroken. A very human perspective of the German soldier and civilian suffering at the hands of their lunatic leaders. The brotherhood of these two supposed enemies is a testament to all that's good in man.
B0087EACJK|4.0|I got the game for free and I'm glad I did. I never tried the first one, but now that I've played this one I want to try the first. There are good puzzles that are neither too easy nor too hard. I'm not overly coordinated, but I can play this game without frustration. Lots of fun hours in here.
B008OOYALE|3.0|It's not as fun as Dragonvale&trade;. Basically the same just not that fun. Maybe they should upgrade it. It cost a lot to buy everything.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I do like these books. I bought it because of the insanely low price and I want to take my family to see the second movie when it comes out but I want to read the book first. Good story line. Good for adults and kids alike.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love this game. It is really fun. Even better yet, it's free! If you like the angry birds trilogy, you'd love this game. Rovio has made yet another great app.
0399156577|5.0|This was a great book.  I bought it because I read every book that I can find that is written by Nora Roberts.  She is a great author.  I love her books.  You always learn something besides having the enjoyment of reading a wonderful story.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Takes forever to install, then a while to load to be able to actually play the game. Then, it goes nowhere.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I love this series so much more than the others in this genre. It's always sad when a series you love ends but it's a beautiful tale of how life could be with out love.
B009KEN87O|5.0|The developers did a great job keeping the arcade feel while using modern technologies. It runs great with great gameplay
B009GEDP26|5.0|If you are watching Season 5, then you already love Castle and this one is another great season of entertainment.  Good fun for all.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I was afraid this was going to be a stupid movie, but I have added it to my favorites list of Disney movies. It had a little more singing than I like, but the funny parts made up for it! LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE!! I even made my husband sit and watch it and he hates cartoons, well most of them. He laughed at this move, so  it is definitely going to become a permanent movie in my collection!
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is one of my favorite actors and Lincoln is one of my favorite Historic figures. I am baffled they could have put the two together and come up with such a mediocre movie.  Day-Lewis acting is great, but the movie is full of so many historical mistakes and omissions it was painful for me to watch.  I pity the PC 20 year old thinking they learned something about Lincoln and the era when they watch this poor excuse for a historical movie.
B009E3EY38|5.0|What can I say/  This was a great DVD that captured the essence of the concert, the rehersal sessions.  I have always considered Zep as the greatest band of all time.  I feel sorry for the younger crowd that did not grow up in the late sixties when they hit the scene.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Beautifully written story. There's mystery, love, romance, pain, fear and suspense. The end was perfect and Joann was a very sweet friend. I was crying a the end at the beauty of the all relationships that had developed. You have to read the book to find out. ;-)
B002PNDEXK|5.0|If you haven't seen THIS version of a Jane Austen novel, you're missing something.  Director Ang Lee beautifully captures the era; his visual concept is perfect.  There isn't a word out of place in Emma Thompson's brilliant script.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Great story!  Great family movie!  We laughed so hard.  This gives Shrek a run for his money.  Our family loved this movie.  One you won't mind seeing over and over...
B002XXNSF6|5.0|I've always loved this movie - and it's still sweet after all these years.  Highly recommend for a quiet evening by the fire.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for my Adult daughter. She loves to collect certain Barbies and this was one of them. Great price and packaged very well! Thank you so much, she LOVED IT!!!!
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I've never owned this concert, so I was excited by the new release having always heard that it was great.  The sound and picture quality are excellent for a 1988 recording, and the set list is incredible.  I've never heard anything live from Iron Maiden that didn't sound fantastic, so it's not much of a surprise, but I'm glad they decided to re-release it in CD and DVD formats.  If you're a Maiden fanatic, you couldn't be disappointed with the quality, and if you're a casual fan, it's a near-perfect documentation of their music up through Seventh Son, with songs from almost every album (sadly, nothing from Powerslave).  The songs are performed in typically entrancing fashion, and the ecstatic crowd provides a compelling backdrop to Maiden's world-class music.<br /><br />Advantages to the DVD include seeing the massive, vintage stage set; watching the intensity and antics of live Maiden (i.e., Bruce running around singing with Dave Murray hoisted on his shoulders playing guitar); and the two documentaries and five music videos on the second disc.  As an added bonus for people who already owned the older version, this includes three encore songs that have never been released; Run to the Hills, Running Free, and Sanctuary.  Also cool is that the inlay booklet folds out into a large poster, with the new artwork covering one entire side. The other side is a giant collage of various Maiden live shots and artwork.<br /><br />Performed nearly 25 years ago, this show displays Maiden at the height of their prowess, though I honestly don't think they've lost a step in all those years.  Their last live release, En Vivo!, which focused on their most recent album, was stunning it its own right, but if you love classic Maiden (and who doesn't?), this DVD provides 18 tracks of pure bliss.  Any fan of legendary heavy metal should not be disappointed.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Great movie!  Great DVD!  Quick service.  Easter was coming and I was able to share this with my grandchildren.  It really got us ready for our Easter celebration.
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was very fascinating and educational.<br />Rebecca Skloot wrote an amazing tale.<br />Kudos to Deborah Lacks for not letting her mother's legacy go in vain.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I'm pretty impressed with the book as a whole would recommend as a good quick read. Gets you really thinking about what one person can do to change the world.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I love this movie.  It has a major twist at the end & a fair amount of action, but it is Tyler Durden's outlook on life & quotes that really make this movie.  A great watch.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|The order came as promised and in good condition.  There was one little &#34;glitch&#34; in one of the DVDs, had to fast forward through it, it was on Season 3 DVD.
B0002J4ZWS|5.0|This is a great movie about friendship and overcoming adversity.  Very heart warming & inspirational. I would definitely recommend it if you haven't seen it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|It is such a smart, witty, dramatic show. The characters are very addictive, and the plot always seems to being thick and changing.
B002ZG997C|4.0|I really like this movie.  The setting is interesting, as I like post-apocalypic themed things, and there is a big plot twist at the end that surprised me.  Give it a look if you like action movies.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Strangle birds...ha ha...fun game and it provides challenges so you have to work to master each level.<br />The sounds are amusing.
B000ZN8036|5.0|This is a really good, thought provoking movie.  It really makes me think about what is important in life.  He definitely took his perspective to the extreme, but it is a life-changing movie for me.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This movie is about only one mere segment of Lincoln's life and times,including his stay in the White House. It is only about his desire to abolish slavery--no--not really. Instead, it is about his use of our constitution to end the war between the states. This movie was not painted with a broad brush. It is too bad that Gore Vidal's great book entitled Lincoln wasn't used as a reference. Perhaps if the title was something less than &#34;LINCOLN&#34;, I  could  give it a four or five star rating based on the acting ability of the leads. However, it appears to be just another raciest flick aimed at the white race. And that is too bad. Gore Vidal's book gives Lincoln character, it's too bad that this movie portrays him as a despot.
B006LSZECO|5.0|what a fabulous book. Loved it, one of my favorites ever. Very clever conciet, and actually terrifying! But at the same time, a good, but cynical look at relationships- how they start, and where they end.  The book is obviously showing extremes, but basic reality of relationships is there. A very young person has alot of illusions, but an oldster, here, can say that alot of the illusions have gone by the way side. Great book on all levels.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|I just received this set today. I have to say that this must be the very best deal out there, for buying music.<br /><br />I have no choice but to give this set 5 stars for the deal this is. This is every studio album except for their latest, in a compact and very tidy package. I see people saying that it doesn't have the live discs or non lp cuts, etc, etc......but, wow, it's their first six and best studio lps for less than 5 bucks a disc!<br /><br />These sound great! If you don't have them or want to upgrade like I did, you cannot lose here. Buy it!

B0050DIWFC|3.0|I thought it was a bit slow and didn't think the ending was developed.  I would not recommend the book.
0596522347|4.0|Nancy Duarte is known for helping high tech firms like Adobe, Cisco, and Google craft their image. She also gained attention by working on Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth.  Slide:ology is a combination of the words slide (as in PowerPoint slide) and ideology, which is an apt description for the book.  Although there are specific prescriptions for making successful presentations, the book does a better job at presenting Nancy Duarte's ideology (although I would use the word methodology) for crafting presentations. If you feel totally lost when you first open Microsoft PowerPoint (or any presentation tool - the book is tool agnostic) or if you feel totally defeated after giving an underwhelming presentation, you'll find this book tremendously helpful. It beautifully covers the entire lifecycle from imagination to creation to presentation.<br /><br />Based on the rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to experience a presentation epiphany. Although I found some new tips, much of the advice is presented in the books I already own by Garr Reynolds, author of [[ASIN:0321811984 Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery (2nd Edition) (Voices That Matter)]] and [[ASIN:0321704452 The Naked Presenter: Delivering Powerful Presentations With or Without Slides (Voices That Matter)]]. Slide:ology is beautiful and inspirational. But in times when I wanted Nancy Duarte's own book to go deeper, she provided reading recommendations for still more books instead.<br /><br />Still, it's useful to have a few of these guides on your bookshelf and to review them while in the midst of creating your latest presentation.  Many times, we reach immediately for Microsoft PowerPoint or Apple Keynote instead of practicing slide:ology. If your bookshelf is light on presentation design books, this book will definitely be a big help. But if you already own a few books on presentation design- like me- you'll turn the last page still hoping for more. Perhaps I'll find more as I read [[ASIN:0470632011 Resonate: Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences]], her second book.l find more as I read [[ASIN:0470632011 Resonate: Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences]], her second book.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The book is good but I don't think it deserves to be on the New York Times bestseller list for as many weeks as it has.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Didn't see the movie but loved the book.  Enjoyed the Philadelphia, South Jersey setting, being from there. Now they want 3 more words.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very very interesting, brings  a logical explanation to NDE's. It helps in understanding the spiritual identities we have and the tie we have to family members
1476712042|4.0|I liked this book. I really did. However, I have some problems with the story. While the story was not your typical love story, I feel like the author (Jamie McGuire) tried to make it more atypical than it already was. Normally, when you love someone who loves you back, you try to be together. Abby, the main character spent months pushing Travis, the love of her life, away when she had no reason to. That confused me. I love the beginning of the book and the way it ended, but I got bored in the middle. I literally started skipping around and looking for something exciting. The story was good, the execution of it was a little sloppy. I loved Travis and Abby, I just didn't love them all of the time. I recommend it still though.
B009GEFXLC|4.0|I really, really like that you've finally gotten them into a relationship..it took long enough that's for sure!!  Only problem now is that their relationship isn't very dynamic, just sort of mediocre.  But still better than having both Kate and Castle playing the field!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|i love this show! it has drama, politics, sex, violence, espionage, power, games, beasts (dragons of course!)!!!!! everything you could want in a show you can find it here!
B00A757EFW|3.0|I like it, it's just I'm not that good at it, it's a hard game. If you like PAC-MAN it's a good buy for you.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|this show is great!! acapella takes real talent and you can see that throughout this show. this is definitely a must see!
B006LSZECO|3.0|mildly entertaining, dragged on and on. Don't understand why other's rate so highly. The story was unbelievable and dragged. Parts were okay but I wouldn't rate higher than a 3 star.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|i'm not a huge fan of Matt Damon... the Bourne series was tolerable, but now that Jeremy Renner is the star this movie is incredible!!
B003TSEEDY|2.0|I can't imagine that a movie was made from this book. It was mildly entertaining at times and boring at other times.
0307943232|5.0|I listen while driving to and from work, etc. John Grisham, well, What can I say ??....He's such a talent. Can't wait for the next good listen !!
B0074VA2T2|3.0|My 4year old loves to eat fruit and he loved the book so I figured it was a win win situation . It kept his attention for about 5 minutes. It was good but it could've been better. Still he did have fun while it kept his interest.
B000WQWPJQ|5.0|Get it!...Blu-Ray lives up to it name and standard and if you really like this film you'll appreciate even more, worth the purchase!!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|IF YOU ENJOYED THE MOVIE YOU WILL ENJOY LISTENING TO THIS, THE CAST OF THE MOVIE DOES A GREAT JOB.
B007NR9WBG|5.0|if you are a fan of Douglas Trumbull then of course you'll get this on Blu-Ray why because you'll know that the VHS and the DVD versions of this film were poor quality blurred image no resolution to speak of with colour that looked like you were watching an NTSC program through a fish tank!....This Blu-Ray pretty much fixes all that up, and on the big screen it shines beautifully well especially the opening titles, the best beginning of a film I've ever seen...the Trumbull trade mark!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Update -11-27-13 - better have time on your hands.  Very hard to get all the items.  The fun is playing and trading.  Some items cannot be obtained without winning.

B00BHMEALA|3.0|It was okay...I expected more becaise of all of the awards it won.. Not as much excitement as I thought. Just my thoughts
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I just loved this book and the second one and I am hoping that the third one in the series comes out in May, as promised.  It's a very quirky, funny, clever, romantic story about two &#34;average&#34; people who go on a search for a very important book.  I don't want to spoil the story except that they have unusual powers for two &#34;average&#34; people.  There are relatives, castles, interesting creatures, and travels to many parts of the world as we know it and don't know it.  No spoilers here, sorry.  I've recommended it to several people and a few just can't put it down until each book is finished, and then they read them again.
B000031EGV|5.0|Every time Jumanji would come on T.V. I found that I would watch it, so it came to me, why not see if I could buy it.  And to my delight I found that it was not only available but I was able to buy it for a very low price.  Thank you Amazon.com
087349976X|4.0|This is a nice design book - some were a little too contemporary for my taste but I did learn from some of their techniques.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Every time Ever After would come on T.V. I found that I would watch it.  Also Drew Berrymore  is one of my favorite people . So once again I thought, why not see if I could buy it through Amazon.com, and to my delight I found that it was not only available but I was able to buy it for a very low price.  Thank you Amazon.com
B00364K6YW|5.0|How can you not love this classic story? It truly is the best love story written! If you have not seen this, just get it!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|music is bluesy, as one would expect from Boz; liked all of the tracks. Favorites were Rainy Night in Georgia and Love on a Two Way Street.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I'm sure its a great game...just not what I thought. I'm too old for this sort of game. Not the games fault.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this games. It's really fun to play when you have nothing to do all day. It's really good game to have one my kindle.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I watched the first 2 seasons of the show and decided to start reading while I wait for the 3 rd season. This book is so similar to the show its amazing and it really helps you to understand anything you may not have understood.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read, and i have read hundreds of great books and bestsellers, includimg The inheritance Cycle, The Chronicles of Vladimr Tod, Divergent, Insurgent, Rangers Apprentice books 1 through 10, the Maze Runner Trilogy, Maximum ride series, the Hunger Games Trilogy, A Child Called &#34;It&#34;, artemis fowl series, and many, many, many, many more.  It is a action-packed, humourous adventure that brings percy and his friends into the depths of hell itself.  readers of all ages are destined to get hooked in percy's amazing greek roller coaster ride that is the lightning theif.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Diamond´s ideas on the history of the world are very intriguing. While the book becomes somewhat redundant as he applies his premises to different parts of the world, the repetition does drive home the ideas. Worth plowing through. Also worth reading a current edition of the book for his chapter about responses from readers working in international economics and the business world and the application of his ideas in those arenas.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|THE AMAZON TRACK-LISTING IS INCORRECT (but it works in our favor).<br />The cd contains 14 tracks, not 12. The 13 and 14 tracks are remixes of For Now I Am Winter by Nilsfrahm and Kiasomos. This is part of the US only release.<br /><br />Olafur is an amazing artist. For me, this is his best overall album yet. Sometimes on previous CDs the violin in the background could get irritating on the ears after a while; it came off as rough and over-powering. 'For Now I Am Winter' sounds smoother. His sound has developed and this album represents a bigger departure from his old music. I could see long time fans adoring this while attracting new fans. I would highly recommend this album to other people.<br />The vocals were an excellent new addition to the songs. In most music today, the vocals are the main focus of the song with a heavy bass backing it up. That is not the case here; the vocals are another instrument. The songs seem to be more complex than his previous music. It's really subtle and how different sounds flow in to each other is amazingly done. The whole album is a work of art. The songs flow smoothly from one track to the next. There is no long annoying gap in between tracks, which really works for this album. It is the perfect CD to play without constantly skipping or repeating song to set a certain tone. I could easily sit and listen to this album in one sitting, or I could use it as background music while studying. It is a very versatile album. 'For Now I Am Winter' has a long musical shelf-life. It won't be easily dated or restricted to a certain group of listeners. I can see people buying this album 20 years from now.<br /><br />The only con for this album is the packaging. The work put in to this album is evident in every little detail, which makes it all the more disappointing that the actual CD case feels cheap. Olafur was extremely active in getting fans to participate in creating the album. The art in the booklet is fan-submitted and those who pre-ordered have their name in the linger notes. This makes it difficult for me to understand why he chose the case he did. It is a paper-trifold case. In the left pocket is the booklet. The booklet fits the theme of the music well, but isn't much to write about. The middle and right pockets contain details about the musicians and credits. The right pocket contains the CD. The CD itself was hard to get out and yet the case stills managed to feel unprotective. In comparison, David Bowie's new album 'The Next Day' is also a paper trifold, but feels much nicer. It has a plastic spot to 'pop' the CD in. This makes the case more sturdy. 'For Now I Am Winter' has a squished appearance from the side. I am attaching two pictures for comparison. I would repurchase the album again, especially since the price difference between the mp3 album and the physical copy is only $1.50. However, I did feel that it was worth noting.<br /><br />I feel bad for writing nearly as much about the packaging as I did about this musical masterpiece. On that note, congratulations Olafur for making this. It is truly a gift to be able to listen to it.
B008XK69S6|4.0|Finally an application that is creative and intelligent on its interface, bringing the touch experience to a higher level.<br />Highly recommended. Though I  am not sure about  the advantages of registering and paying. I have done that and see no clear benefit.
0977326403|5.0|\\"The moment you think of yourself as great, your slide toward mediocrity will have begun\\" says Jim Collins in this easy-to-read 35-page booklet. Your team will appreciate his insights on how a nonprofit or church measures results.<br /><br />\\"All data is flawed,\\" writes Collins. \\"It doesn't really matter whether you can quantify your results. What matters is that you rigorously assemble evidence--quantitative or qualitative--to track your progress.\\"<br /><br />Leverage this booklet to help your team understand the difference between greatness and \\"business-like.\\" After you read it, ask your nonprofit board and senior team to address these questions:<br />1. Where are we on a scale of \\"mediocre\\" to \\"great?\\"<br />2. How rigorously do we assemble evidence to document our results?<br />3. What assignment should we make today as a result of this discussion?<br /><br />I urge my nonprofit clients to always appoint one semi-cynic in every meeting (board meeting or staff meeting) who will frequently (but graciously) shout out, \\"How do we know that? What research have we done to affirm that assumption about our...people/donors/volunteers/clients/customers, etc.\\" Try it!
B0074VA2T2|4.0|This ap held her interest longer than most that I have downloaded for her. She loved the eating the items, and tried to eat them all at the same time. What surprised me was that this practice did not make the ap freeze up or become glitchy which is a major plus.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|This series is about what would you become if everything went to hell. Your loved ones either killed or turning into soulless killers. Would you be heroic or would you become a survivalist only concerned with your own survival at the expense of anyone that you encountered.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a clever sci-fi book, it continually surprises with ingenious solutions to seemingly impossible situations. While the science seems credible, it is missing a mention of so many practical problems that it becomes a little frustrating. For example, loss of muscle mass in a low gravity environment. Radiation. Psychology is ignored...the hero is way too calm and equitable to be realistic. Characterisation is shallow, although I welcomed the female characters. Overall, a good read. Kudos to the author.
B004VFMCWE|5.0|Live by the rules of society, and society along with the Political Correct police will push you over the edge.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Loved this app. It was way more fluid and speedy than the stock keyboard. Best android keyboard for the price
B00BBRR21Q|5.0|LIVE AT THE MOORE IS WORTH THE PRICE ALONE! Great album awesome sound quality and great live show from Mad Season
B000JML90Y|4.0|This book is a great read, it could be considered boring to some people but not if you are into science and evolution.
B0015DWLD0|3.0|Looked forward to reading this book.  The first part got my attention and was very amusing. But after that I found myself just wanting to get to the end.  Perhaps I'm just not a fan of one narrator.  This was a book club read and not a big hit. Keep in mind I do enjoy books about India, have read quite a few.  Much preferred The Namesake.  Again, perhaps it was the writing style, not my cup of tea.
B004GYY714|2.0|could not find KFUO THUS ITS OF NO USE TO ME so I probably will not use it very much if at all or not very much any way what do you think
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I started watching this series as a recommendation from a friend. It was not something I would have normally watched on my own. I found it interesting and entertaining from the first show on. The filming was beautiful. The characters were full of life. I liked how it showed two simultaneous lives between the servants of the grand home, as well as the nobles. The grandmother could often be I expectantly and subtlety funny. Not to mention you felt like you were right in the middle of history. It was just overall well done!
B005544V6A|5.0|This is the only show that I have ever spent money to watch. After the first episode I became an overnight addict. Mike makes the show, but Harvey's character is in another level, the type of lawyer you want to be in real life. Has an amazing storyline, always leaving you wanting more. And if you like beautiful women, this show has them. Can't wait for S3
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator with big numbers and easy to use. Wonderful for everyday use.  Perfect addition to my kindle fire anytime I need to calculate something.
B001NHNG64|4.0|As a second Jack Reacher read in the saga I found this book moved a little more smoothly than the first.  The details did not slow the story.  I look forward to the 3rd book in the collection.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|A great sexy read. Similar to 50 shades of great but with a better writing style. I loved it!  X
B0029LCJJS|4.0|It was very interesting.  Kept me watching, and will probably watch again.  The acting was good,  I have recommended it to my friends.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|When I saw a link to this on face book, I feel in love with it and had to have it. I was not disappointed. Love it.
1451627289|5.0|I am a confessed King addict, and could not put this one down. Another enthralling effort by this master story teller.
B0019WQIPE|5.0|One of my favorite movies and I was very happy to find it in Spanish.  Love to share with my students.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The plot within the plot, layer upon layer of secret government Black ops groups is a little stale at this point, however the action doesn't disapoint.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Started watching from review from friend. Now I'm hooked too!  Can't wait to start the next season! Really keeps my attention.
B005MHI0QM|5.0|Been to the annex but never knew the full story. It is inspiring and a truly incredible work by such a young woman.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|Boy! was i surprised! It was the most overrated movie I've seen in many years. I actually fell asleep during it. Too much CGI and symbolism. very predictable too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids and I love surfin'! Great game and they keep it interesting. Keep up the good work. Love how they add new things each month.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is my favorite game on the kindle fire. Me and my brother play it all the time. The only thing that is missing is multiplayer. if vector unit Inc made a sequel of this with multiplayer then that would definetly be a game I would pay for.
B00A6SZS2Q|5.0|My daughter has been listening to this CD for weeks and absolutely loves it.  Not my kind of music but if she is happy, I am happy.  Thanks Amazon.
B00006JIA4|5.0|This was a gift for my birthday, and what can I say, Queen is the best!  After the Beatles, heh, heh
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Part treatise on kinesiology, part history of evolutionary biology, and part joyful paean to endurance running, this book was a thoroughly enjoyable experience for this uninformed reader.  The author moves you along at alternating shotgun speed switching to fascinating side trips to the Kalahari desert and Leadville, Colorado. Strap on some inexpensive thin soled shoes and run along side. You'll love it!
0486282112|5.0|Mary Shelley's &#34;Frankenstein&#34; is fine example of romanticism. I believe that's why the book starts off with correspondence. The letters set up the mood in the beginning of how the book will end. But it is not disappointing; Quite the contrary. Once oriented to the mood and tenor that the book will have, it becomes rather exciting. Frankenstein plays a sort of cat and mouse with his creator. And when he talks in the book, there is a real development in a deep reverberating tenor. It's a short piece and very entertaining. A great addition to any library.
B008PZZV8S|5.0|This movie is addictive! I actually went out and bought it after watching it. Best matt damen movie ever I saw.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|I thought it might be fun when I looked at the details and saw that it was FREE!  HA!  and I repeat, HA!  You will quickly find it isn't FREE if  you play a min or two
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is just great. I'd forgotten how much I loved playing Solitaire as a kid. I like the hints when I need them.
B0058VW36U|4.0|My kids, 3 and 7 like to play this game.  Of course, the older one<br />can actually play it better, but even my 3 year old gets the concept<br />and asks for help in playing.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This Minecraft version is awesome. I have a few notes that people or editors may want to know about, though.<br /><br />First of all, this game has Creative mode and Survival mode just like the PC version. Survival has zombies, creepers, etc. Creative is peaceful and awesome except that there is no night, so you can't use your bed(s). Also, there is the &quot;end of the world&quot;. This means that, (if you go far enough in one direction) you will eventually come to a blank blue side &quot;wall&quot;.<br /><br />Other than these little complaints, this Minecraft is awesome and as epic as the PC version we all know. Some people  may complain that $7 is a little too expensive for an app, but if you download this game, you will see that it is totally worth it. Hope you like thos version of 'Craft.
B007U2ABXM|4.0|As always, Patti Smith pushes the boundaries with this album.  And, as always for me with her albums, some tracks that I play again and again, and others that I want to skip.  The first track is like a small play, tuneful also; the title piece, on the other hand, has the insistent lyrics and repetitive noise that are hard (for me) to listen to.  Liked the contextual information and the printed lyrics that the booklet provided.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I just started with season 3, and was really glad to find 1&2 available.  We have really enjoyed it, and are looking foreward to season 4, when it is available.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I enjoyed this miniseries. It was lovable, fun to watch and I thought that Garai did a wonderful job as Emma.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was one of the few people who have never watched the Good Wife so figured I'd catch the pilot to see what it's all about.  Now I'm hooked -- have my favorite episodes and am halfway into Season 2.  Am trying not to rush through all the seasons because I want to savor each story.  Thank you Amazon Prime for allowing me to enjoy this series at long last!
B0089LOKHG|4.0|As someone who loved both the first two books in the series and read all of the extra short stories, I think that the finale is a must read. The only down side is there is no epilogue or feeling of closure that normally accompanies the last book in a series. I finished the book asking questions, wishing for more, upset that I did not get the answers I sought. I understand the authors reason for this, but am torn at the same time.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Can't believe I watched this, let alone loved it!!!  The story line was a complete turn-off for me until I watched the first 10 minutes and was hooked!!  Ethan Hawk and Helen Hunt are perfect in their roles.  Can't imagine the fortitude it must have taken to bring this story to the screen but I, for one, really appreciate the dedication.  Just give it 10 minutes -- you won't be sorry...
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This was a very cute movie using different animals of the desert to portray the characters.  Easy to follow story line once Rango is left in the desert.  Good lessons to learn too!<br /><br />Quite enjoyable!
0312427999|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift to someone else. I think it should be required reading at every high school & college in the country. The only problem with that is our children will suddenly realize what a bunch of crapballs our politicians ans intelligence agencies are. Then what?
1856697525|5.0|Big heavy designer. I love it. (and all the other words needed to finish out my review of this book.)
1409303187|5.0|My granddaughter loves this little set of books.  It's always one of the things she'll pick up first when she's at my house.
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|To me this is the best depiction of Christ Crucifixion. The only bad thing is it is sub titled, because they are speaking in Aramaic. But I absolutely love this movie, and be ready to cry because you just can't help your self.
B005E89X7E|5.0|The whole warrior series were absolutely intriguing and interesting , I could not put the books down and do hope there will be more coming in this series, for anybody interested in History a must!
B004AO4FJ4|5.0|The Doctor Who show is really very exceptional for all ages, and for anyone to watch. There are some aspects of it that could potentially scare some people; however, they aren't really a problem in most cases. Really, if something scares you, you can look online for some sort of crossover that fans have made and really start to laugh about it. Give it a shot, and start at this season of Doctor Who (Do not start at the original series.... watch those after you have finished all of the current/modern series)!
B007SGM084|5.0|It was a wonderful book and i enjoyed all 3 tremendiously. I cabnt say enough how down to earth it really was and this does still exsist.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book was amazing. I know understand a lot more death. Thank you so much for helping us to. Loved it
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|So many tragedies start with recreational alcohol. A sad story that should give a thoughtful person pause when reaching for that 2nd glass of wine, 6th beer or first Martini.<br /><br />Thank God I missed this one!
159420411X|4.0|Approachable book that does a great job grounding the reader in the reality of projections and predictions.  Silver uses a wide variety of contexts: weather, poker, baseball, politics, earthquakes, the markets...Combine the information on economists and politicians and it should be no surprise that government economic policy has been a failure, especially in the rapidly changing 21st century.  How can traditional, Keynesian targeted investments be effective when the best economists in the world have legitimate disagreements on describing what actually happened over the last year, let alone projecting where things are going in the future?  Add that to what comes across (and what I perceive as accurate)as the general cluelessness of the politicians charged with 'managing' the macroeconomy and you have a very strong case for 19th century small government.  Despite what Paul Krugman says, if the government takes billions or trillions from the economy and then tries to strategically spend it somewhere else, it can be an enormous drag on employment, incomes, growth and cause much pain, suffering, and poverty in the economy as we are seeing today.<br /><br />Many of the chapters portend hopeful futures in improving our ability to predict and prepare.  But when it comes to the economy, there is no inkling of hope that things will get better in terms of prediction and I contend that with the fast pace and massive growth in the generation of information, predictions will likely get worse.  Silver's description makes that case but he fails to extend it to its natural conclusion.  In a fast moving, complex economic system, the best government macro-economic policy is one characterized by stability and a small government footprint.
B004BSFC46|3.0|It looks cute on my son's hand but it does not solve the purpose.  The rattle sound is very feeble.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I watched this late at night ... something to go to sleep by.  Nope ... watched the whole thing and was entertained.  A pleasant surprise.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I dig it. Might I suggest the two suit option, as one suit is too easy. I play this all the time.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I don't spend a lot of time watching movies but found this one to be very much worth seeing.  Loved the way it recognized the role of the guy that initially didn't want to take the risk but later played such a key role in the outcome.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this story because it kept me unsure of the ending which was very unexpected.  Good book for those who like mystery and romance.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The only thing bad about this old man's writing style is that he kills the very people he makes you love.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a very sweet love story with lots of drama with it.  It is hard to put it down.
B003TH14H4|4.0|I love Castle,he keeps things interesting! I can relate to Kate on a personal level.even though her tragedy is just a T.V. show,mine is real.My mother was murdered when I was  eight years old.The man that did served just a few years and he has been free toi walk the streets for 30 years,while I have PTSD.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I started reading the the first book in the series, right after seeing the movie, and the book and movie were virtually identical, in the first part of the book, so I put it down to read later. Well, it's later now, and I went back and finished the first book, and immediately ordered books 2 and 3. Glad I did. The characters were well written, the story interesting with unexpected twists and turns. But ultimately, it was all about the inner conflicts of the characters, and the psychology of Revolution. Highly Recommended.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I love the show,its very emotional.sad and yet they are survivors.I could not imagine how they must feel.It would have to be terrible to go through what they have been through.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I like the play of one brother off the other and the different themes of each episode. Both actors have grown more confident in their roles which make the series that much more interesting.
B002N2SYAG|4.0|I enjoy this show,esp.the ones with the Gravedigger.The show is very unique,always has things interesting.I like the chemistry between Bones and Booth.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|It's been over a decade since I've last watched this show, and re-watching it has been a lot of fun. I forgot how much I truly loved the characters and plots of the shows.
068485743X|4.0|Very easy  to read. Good practice at end of each chapter. Can easily skim what doesn't apply to your writing
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I really enjoy  this link, I love reading the conversations of others that work in my field, and I also learn alot. Thanks
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I loved this episode of the walking dead, i was kind of hopeing to finally see the govenors head get blown off by one of the people at the prison but sadly, no. Alas poor andrea, i never once thought that she was going to die because she is such a strong woman. Adrea, you will always be missed by all but never forgotten, but at least you get to see your sister again in heaven.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|you should get it right now it is so awesome I have been playing this game sense ever YOU NEED THIS GAME
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The walking dead is good entertainment. You just never know what the next installment will bring. It keeps me guessing, and eager to see the next one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire:<br />I liked that they tricked Katniss and Peeta them and gave you hints but you don't realize it until the end.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The third season was awesome and I thoroughly enjoyed watching. The Walking Dead had been an addiction for my significant other and I. I love watching them come out every Sunday. Thank you for bringing the series to Amazon.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The first version had a lot of bugs but the upgrade is great. No more major bugs play is much better<br />Would recommend for anyone to play
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is great. If you haven't bought it yet please do you won't regret it. This is a nice and fun game for all ages.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It was recommend by my daughters, and I found it an interesting story line and a surprising ending. Well done.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 8 daughter loves this app.  You can groom the horses and train them.  I would recommend this app to other people.  It's cute.
0817439390|5.0|...it does exactly what everyone says- it gives you a clear, no frills approach to learn just what exactly those functions on your camera can do!  It hand-holds you into stepping into the P and A modes, and even into full Manual.  Great photos allow you to easily see the effects that you can have on the photographs you take.  An easy read that will quickly expand your knowledge, no matter if you're using a DSLR, CSC, or advanced point and shoot.  Highly recommended.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I think this book may be particularly appealing to teenagers.  I like the letter style of the book and the stream of conscious details in the writing. A good quick read that keeps you turning the pages.
B007N6NGYG|3.0|I have not figured out how to play this. I will have another look at it. It looks fun! Yeah!
B007NWCZR4|5.0|First, I recommned &#34;Format&#34; most to PSB fans who don't have the desire or funds to buy all the PSB singles that are released in order to hear the B-sides.  Secondly, even for the Pet Heads who buy all the singles, Format is great because the B-sides are organized in somewhat chronological order and flow nicely for listening.<br /><br />As far as the music itself, where PSB is concerned, either you like them or you hate them.  PSB fans will not be won or lost over this CD set.  This set is highly unique not filled with remixes or songs that are slight variations on those previously released.<br /><br />These B-sides are more experimental and less commercial than primary CD tracks, and some of the songs on here sound a tad unpolished or have lyrics dealing with unusual topics.  Of course this is one reason to love the PSB!!  Other songs on here are party awesome and rival or surpass songs that have been put on their regular albums.<br /><br />Definitely 5 Stars for anyone who likes the PSB!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My now 4 year old twin daughters were preemies.  They were each given a Wubbanub in the NICU.  Fast forward to 2013 and I have a new nephew born 11 weeks premature.  I just ordered him the monkey. The best thing about these are that babies, especially preemies, is that they can guide the pacifier much easier on their own, honing their hand/eye coordination.<br /><br />The big downside is that they pacifier can not be removed from the stuffed animal.  I found a couple work around's for that when my girls started crawling and got it dirty.  One is put it in the dishwasher, but the animal tends to come out still damp.  The other was just toss it in the washer with my kids clothing.  When it was all washed and dried, I simple boiled some water and sterilized the pacifier.<br /><br />My girls no longer use the pacifier, of course, but they still have them and their baby dolls \\"use\\" them now.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|The Bloomberg app is complete: it has news, charts, all markets, all investment products, and it can be personalized to track your own portfolio. Navigation is simple and clear. This is how all apps should be!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|loose yourself in this fantasy read. I hated having to put it down and get on with the daily routine of life. Can't wait for The Winds of Water to hit the shelves. A wonderful, wonderful read.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Iron Maiden has always been good about putting out concert videos to please their fans, and this DVD release of \\"Maiden England\\" has been highly anticipated.  I remember this video not being a favorite of mine, after being a huge fan of the \\"Live After Death\\" concert video, the style of this video had bothered me with its editing and the band playing against a white background.  Plus, I was not a huge \\"Seventh Son\\" fan compared to previous albums; after watching the \\"history\\" documentary and learning that they could have made a concert video for the \\"Somewhere in Time\\" tour with its spectacular stage set-up and solid setlist was another kick in the pants.  They really missed out on that one and they know it, but it's too late.  Ok, so after many years of not seeing this video and being in the pit for last year's \\"Maiden England\\" tour which I really enjoyed, I still feel the same about most of the video.  Editing - I don't know why you would ever break away from a guitarist while he is in the middle of a solo to flash to Steve, Nicko, or Bruce messing around.  It's their moment - so give it to them.  I've always been a believer that the singer should exit the stage and/or fall into the background while the solos are going on; Bruce does not always like to do that.  While the picture has supposedly been improved, watching an old concert, which was probably filmed on video tape, and now put on a DVD, still looks pretty bad on an HD television, especially the faraway shots.  I enjoyed seeing live versions of \\"Still Life\\" and \\"Infinite Dreams\\" again, the latter being strangely absent during the modern \\"Maiden England\\" tour.  The oddballs in the setlist are \\"Die with your boots on\\" and \\"Killers\\", two songs that should have stayed within the tour for that respective album only.  Seeing the recent tour helped me enjoy the song \\"Seventh Son\\" more, so watching this video reminded me how cool it is to see performed live.  I appreciate the encores being added and this version of \\"Running Free\\" is the most intense one I have seen or heard.  Overall, it was good to see this performance again, flaws and all, especially with the classic line-up.<br /><br />The second disc is full of some pretty cool extras.  I have enjoyed the \\"History of Iron Maiden\\" segments, but this one added a lot of distracting and quite frankly annoying visual effects that were completely unnecessary for a documentary and took away from the content of the interviews.  Then they leave you hanging with Adrian Smith beginning to explain why he had decided to leave the band after the tour.  As I mentioned earlier, it sucks to know that they could have made a \\"Somewhere in Time\\" concert video and the manager ruled against it; I think that would have been a true classic.  I agree with other reviewers that they should have included what they did shoot on the disc.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching \\"12 Wasted Years\\" again.  I bought that on VHS when it first came out and watched and enjoyed it many times back in the day.  Although a lot of the concert footage has been included in the \\"Early Days\\" DVD,  that was all fans had to go on back in the day.  The documentary looked like I was watching a VHS tape on an HD TV, but it was still cool to see again.  I still want to know who Bruce is yelling at when they show the footage from Dortmund while playing \\"Iron Maiden\\".  I'm glad Maiden included this classic on this release.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended for the true fan.  For the price you pay, there is a lot of stuff included and they even turned the insert into a poster.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I found the book quite boring, at least the in first half. The story is stretched out far to thin.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|I have no idea how many times I have listened to this soundtrack.  It is on regular rotation in my car.
B0012X6FR6|5.0|1959 recording remastered for great sound quality with the original classic music that makes Bill Evans a Jazz icon.  Highly recommended for any jazz / music lover.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|The characters are fun, music by Abba wonderful.  A movie I have watched over and over.  Loved the soundtrack so much, I bought it also.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'M A HUGE KING FAN SO WAS EXCITED GOING INTO THE BOOK, BUT WAS HESISTANT SINCE I'M NOT REALLY INTO POLITICS.<br />HOWEVER, IT WAS A GREAT READ, EXCELLENT STORY LINE AND REALLY ORIGINAL.  WAS SAD TO SEE THE BOOK END :(
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Loved the actors especially Eli Wallach.  The multiple stories lines were well integrated to make the movie move along to its conclusion.
B004XGN8W4|5.0|This thing is awesome! Suitcase with built in TV to play on our favorite systems!?!? Sign me up!<br /><br />I gotta be honest I waited until the inevitable price drop and well I got it once it got to a price I felt comfortable paying for it.<br /><br />No regrets! It fits all my PS3's (I have the fat, slim and super slim) very well.<br /><br />The TV is an awesome 15&#34; that looks and sounds great<br /><br />The suitcase itself feels very sturdy and looks the items inside securely<br /><br />Definitely recommend it to those wanting to game on the go with the big boy consoles
B0053YGYO4|4.0|This album has a bit of electronica, but the songs are well arranged and still have some great beats.  Im not a fan of all the songs, but the really good ones make up for the others.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I love this book.  It was relevant to every woman and man irregardless of their financial situation. Solutions are offered that come from within every individual.  She presents a refreshing look at how we all can actively participate in making this a world a better world for our children and their childre.  Ms. Sandberg is inciteful and backs up all statements with research and statistics to prove her point.  It is also personal allowing the reader to identify with her struggles and reflect on how her experiences can help direct us to have mroe power over our own future both in the workplace and at home.
B0074MZSWW|4.0|I love the powerful vocals on Alabama Shakes singer!  The music is rock and roll with a lot of soul!<br />Its Awsome!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent and absorbing series.  The characters are what makes the whole series works.  Keep it coming.
B005URRCUY|5.0|El Camino is a great follow up to Brothers!  It is just amazing.  Great riffs, great rock songs, just an amazing, awsome, rock album!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I really liked this movie......maybe better than the earlier Bourne movies. It had a lot of good action, plus the story was good. It really isn't a prequel, but more about a side story that was happening at the same time as the other events were taking place during the other Bourne movies.
B007DIQC90|5.0|All the songs are great in this album!  They sound a bit like mumford & sons, but having male and female vocals make them even greater and gives them more flexibility with their song arrangements.
B009MO57H6|4.0|I liked this movie but wish it would have taken the story farther than it did. Seemed to rehash stuff that it didn't need too.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|WOW is all I can say!  This is one of the best rock albums ive hear in a long time!!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I love this show but I am Norwegian and have cousins living in Norway. One question I have is they don't mention iolite being use as a compass and the Vikings did use iolite too. Never heard of the sun stone so that was interesting. I love the 2 main characters. Ragnar is awesome and the relationship he has with this wife and the circumstances surrounding their marriage or hand fasting is probably very accurate. That was the way of it then.
B008G59IBI|3.0|I bought all three Green Day albums as soon as they came out, Uno, Dos, Tre with the fear that they would all sound alike and that fear came out to be true.  I like the Green Day sound, but too much Green Day in 6 months means that no one album (or song for that matter) is standing out.  If you like Green Day pop punk buy the album, but it all pretty much sounds the same!
B006LSZECO|4.0|An intriguing and bizarre storyline.  The obsession and psychosis of the main characters was beyond belief!<br />A quick read once you get past the first 2 or 3 chapters.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|My first time listening to the Lumineers!  Loved all the songs on this album, specially Ho Hey, Big Parade and Flowers in Your Hair (even though they cut it a bit short!).  Recommend it to buy!
B007JNWQZS|4.0|We could only watch one of them, will check kb2 at a later date. The first was very heavy, lots of action, blood and kinda funny at the same time. Delivery was fast and easy, thanks for that! Love the blu-ray, you really can see the difference
B004GUSG4M|4.0|What I liked the most was that it kept my interest up.  This truly would have been a difficult book to write, having to remember to forget.  Suspenseful with a believable story line and characters.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I loved this book - the writing was so good.  Humor was thrown in throughout and I found myself laughing out loud at times.  The story was just wonderful.
B0051XQI84|2.0|No subtitles / closed captioning for the rental as is available for other digital purchases and rentals. -- Difficult for the hard of hearing!<br /><br />Weird licensing issues: we wanted to buy rather than rent, but we were informed that the license rights change later this summer. Essentially it said that either download to a compatible device by X date or lose access. It wasn't clear if this meant that the movie was tied to the specific device at that point--do you lose it altogether if the device breaks or you have to reinstall your OS? Such issues make me less confident in other Amazon video purchases in the future.<br /><br />FWIW, the video quality was great, and actual movie (independent of the format) was fantastic.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|You will love this story from Nicholas Sparks - his work is always enjoyable and a winner.  Truly a winner
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is the best game ever your trying to escape from something and you tap the screen and you go up try to stay away from the zappers  bullet things and the lazer things try to get the gears it gives you a robot of some kind. I love this app I'm 13 and a girl ps this is for girls and boys
0590259385|5.0|This book has become a favorite of my 2-year-old granddaughter.  The drawings are charming and the rhymes delightful.  I love reading it as much as my granddaughter loves having it read to her!
0425252868|5.0|As a person who can never follow war movies, I LOVED this book. As I read, I learned about the personal character of the men involved, but also about the war in general. I gained a perspective that made so much sense and explained how the terrible atrocities involved in that war could happen, and did happen. I cried, more than once, while reading, which was particularly difficult, because I read it out loud to my husband as we drove while on vacation. I read it out loud in case I had questions for him about some of the war tactics and terminology. But I didn't need his help because the story does not assume that you are already knowledgeable about the war. He loved the story as much as I did. So, if you saw a man and a woman driving on I-95, crying, it could have been us!
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Cogent analysis of human labor versus the rapidly expanding technologies that replace mid-level workers.  Rational, well-reasoned, succinct.  A very quick but very important read.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I need not say more! Amazing books - all 3 of them :). Ian Somerhalder was born for this role!!
0684171600|5.0|Delivery on time, packaging adequate, a good price, a classic novel, impeccable art. I would caution anyone who's looking to buy this to be very careful looking thru the listings from various sellers. Not all are hardback or with illustrations by N.C. Wyeth, which is what I'm reviewing. Caveat emptor, Jim boy.
B0087EACJK|5.0|I use to play this game on a website and loved it then. I like it even more on the phone and tablet.
B0075PZ2ZG|5.0|I love these guy's and this album is when they were still a little scream o but all and all it's awesome!!
B004UID2LC|2.0|very limited capbility; not intuitive to use.  not sure why it's necessary.  I downloaded due to the Flash download not working on my Kindle.  One of many issues with the Kindle.  Would not recommend ap or Kindle.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very good very interesting  serious and funny at same time. Good writing keeps you interested.  Good story line very good characters you can relate to
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I read this before the movie and was slightly dissapointed in the movie because the writing/story was SO MUCH better in the book. :) If you've seen the movie you can still read because there ARE differences :)
B009LDXQGW|4.0|very goog album for a nice price!!!i hope &#34;The Weekend&#34; will be reconize for her song style..!it's a good artist for now and the futur
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very much like &#34;mario&#34;, games travels left to right, breaking blocks, stomping bad guys, shooting them with pine cones. CUTE! Cute story. My 4 and 8 year old (and ME at 33) LOVE IT!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|&#34;I Can't Wait&#34; for the next season!!! My wife and I are addicted. We just wish the episodes were on the same day they were on AMC.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|If you can NOT wait until October for more walking dead, then return to where it all started and read the comics! They are different,so you won't be bored and &#34;know it all&#34; before reading! :)
B008LUEEVW|5.0|Pink no doubt writes her music from the heart!  This album rocks and everyone can relate to this album<br />at some point in a relationship, male or female!!  Love the bonus tracks included too...
B005LAIISA|5.0|Great kids movie and adults, speedy deliveyr, packed perfect, Great family movie for all. I would recommend for all ages!!
B00846F1YW|5.0|Having fun going from building to building following the story line finding hidden objects. Surprise puzzles keep it interesting. Great adventure.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Nice, high quality game with good storyline. I like the music and atmosphere. Lots of places to explore, plus bonus content. This is one of the best hidden object/ adventure games I've played, I will play it again and again.
0553801473|5.0|I have loved all of this series of books, mostly because they are so very well written.  It seems that many authors either do not proof read their books, or they don't care about mistakes in the printing, but finding a mistake in one of George R.R. Martin's books is rare indeed.  I hope he keeps writing, as I have a new favorite author.
B005UDD1R6|5.0|We love to cruise. Many times ships don't have anything decent to watch on TV at night before bed except the news or maybe a movie that you have to catch at the right time to see if from the beginning. I can load movies on my tablet for him to watch while I read. This works perfectly for that purpose. It is easy to use. Actually this is the only thing I use it for. Haven't used it enough to play with the other features. I downloaded it for movies, that is what I use it for, and hubby is happy camper.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Will all the negative vibes prior to its release, I was prepared not to like it.  However, the use of the extra material in the mythology was well woven into the story and did not detract from it.  Peter Jackson has another hit on his hands.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|If I were a kid, this would be tons of fun. But, since I'm past Medicare age, it's a little too fast for me. I was hoping it would be something on the order of Be jeweled, but it isn't anything at all like it.  I've slowed down quite a bit in my old age so I'll leave this game to the little whippersnappers. :)
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan is the most versatile vocalist ever...I just love her voice, which has more colors than any I have ever heard.  She can belt it out or sing it softly and still hit me with emotions I haven't experienced with other singers.  This is true beauty of communication at its best.  Keep on going, Susan!
B0049YH0GA|1.0|I agree with the previous review that there is something seriously wrong with the vinyl reissue by MFSL.  I concur that the CD version of this album is fabulous, and as a vinylphile I was very excited to get this on LP.  Clearly there is a significant drop off in the recording/sound level starting with the second song on side 2, and it goes far beyond what is acceptable for analog playback.  Also, the song \\"Whiteworld\\" on CD has been one of my reference songs for the dynamics of its percussion, but no matter how high I turn the volume up on this vinyl version, the very low recording level makes it impossible to enjoy.  Clearly this vinyl pressing is seriously flawed and not up to Mobile Fidelity's or anybody's standards. MFSL needs to admit the mistake, recall the album, and replace them with properly mastered LPs.  This fabulous music by Patricia Barber deserves a great audiophile vinyl pressing, but unfortunately the usually dependable Mobile Fidelity managed to mess this one up.
B007XAYKX8|5.0|OK, I'm a big fan of MotoGP, so some lack of objectivity.  But, a wonderful documentary about the racing, the racers.  Welll-written narrative & who doesn't like hearing Ewan MacGregor's reading it?  Movie edited well, flowing narrative.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I saw movie and read both killing Lincoln and blood on the moon. Found this to be informative and interesting. Found myself reading in small blocks due to the historical components. Great book on leadership
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I give this game a 5. But please lower the prices&hellip;im sick of evolving my dinosaur and getting only experience when I do the research for the evolution. If you have to pay 10000 coins for an evolution the least it can do is not give you experience points all the time. still a 5 for everything else:)
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game,makes you keep your mind and eyes continuing to expand, always looking for patterns of three or more. You do run out of stars fast, but is a quick game to play each day
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Extremely graphic rape scenes but all in all a good movie. I liked how the girl after being brutalized kicked some sleezeball ass!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Awesome filled with adventure. Buck is a husky that goes on a lot of travels. I would definitely recommend this awesome book.
B00005J6UP|5.0|Love this movie from my past! One of the best 90's movies and brings back lots of memories from my childhood!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Movie will make even the toughest viewer tear up. Such a touching story about love and dedication. Every dog lover will enjoy this movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|Technically speaking, this was a wonderfully done tv program, and there was nothing wrong with the &#34;product&#34; but seriously, why can't TV shows be somewhat happy? Why do you need to kill off so many characters?
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Great Movie! Love every minute of it. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. Visually stunning and sounded great! I would recommend it to anyone.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I loved 1, 2 &amp; 3 but this Hungry Shark is better than ever. Really good graphics and better fun!!!!! xP
B002RI99HI|1.0|It is chapters taken out of LIttle Women. You are wasting your money if you buy it. It does not state in product info that all they did was take a section of the original book and make it separate. Real ripoff
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|It is a fantastic series that seems to show the Vikings in a real light instead of all the pomp and circumstance as how they are usually portraid.
B0082SU98U|5.0|A classic for all ages. To think it is free for your kindle. And worth downloading even if you don't read it right away.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series is outstanding!!!  I usually hate zombie movies, but this series actually has a great story despite the blood and guts of the zombies.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Loved it! We are going to tour the town the movie was filmed in this summer. There is a driving tour you can do in Greenwood, MS and many of the places in the movie are featured. I think you can even arrange for private tours through the Greenwood Tourism Board. I am from the south and still live there and this was pretty realistic from the clothes to the cars and music.
0316044695|5.0|Wow! This is the second time I have read this incredible true story! It is well written and flows like a fresh cold spring. I could hardly put it down. Anguish, incredible tales of friendship and bravery, and a refreshing perspective on the influence the liberal media today has affected and changed our military. Be prepared for an emotional experience. In my opinion this is a must-read for every adult in our nation.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Loved it! This is one I can watch again and again. You don't have to be a football fan to like this one!
B002QNTNL6|5.0|This movies plot is a little hard to digest at first since its far fetched but once you start to watch its a nice tale of Father and Daughter.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Its a good show if you like period dramas. I think it will appeal more to women than men in general. A fun journey into historical fiction.
B002NJWHHA|4.0|I enjoyed this one, it is the type of read where you can ignore the rest of the world for a while and get lost in the fantasy of the story.  The use of the different language, story language, stimulates some thought and provides in interesting diversion.  I will read the next one in the series.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am a very busy Mom of a 1 yr old little boy and 3 yr old little girl. I have to stay on task with work, family, church etc...I use it to remind my husband of his appointments as well lol. This really helps to organize and juggle my busy schedule. I would definitely recommend.
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|The digital restoration is perfect, bringing out the quality of the original film. It especially well shows the complex scenes and deep focus techniques which were groundbreaking in 1941. The restored soundtrack completely eliminates background hiss, and this adds impact.<br /><br />If you've never seen this movie, or not for a long time, this is the perfect version to get.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I got sucked into this trilogy right away. I finished the series in just a few days. The character development is great as we see the world through the main character's eyes. What left me a bit at odds with the trilogy is the progression of the storyline through the three books. The second book seemed like almost a repeat of the first, and yet the third book took on a completely different tone and approach from the first two. But I did enjoy this series.
B005COO1X6|4.0|This story is classic Stephen King, from the days of Christine and Cujo.  If you enjoyed these, you'll enjoy this little treat.
B007L96SI6|3.0|I expected more blues as I remember that is what she was so good at on American Idol.  Love her voice though
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great twists and turns.  Stohl and Garcia unite for an interesting journey tying the past history of their families with the Lena and Ethan's life in the present.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Nice version, one can play it relaxed or against the clock! The better you play it the more fun. Great for killing time, or simply for fun. I recommend this game highly.<br />Tomera
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is amazing, it is history, it really feels like I learn so much more every time I watch an episode. I highly rec this one for anyone who likes the British culture, and anyone who has a thing for history as I do. It's not boring in the least, in fact most of the time you forget that it takes place in the early 1900's during times of war and illness and the slow disappearance of social class. It's really a great one. I joined in recently, when S3 had already aired, and I can't really see myself paying 15 dollars for 9 episodes, but I am very close to caving in.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is so much fun.  I was just on a business trip and I did not miss a beet.
B0064MT1FI|5.0|Loved this movie . Had it on VHS but wanted it as a keepsake on dvd. Was very expensive at first but price went down and I nabbed it. Good quality. Quick sipping by Amzon Prime as usual
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Excellent game that easy is to play but not as easy to master. I love it!!! Great way to pass the time.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Of all the Blade movies I think this one was the best. Sequels are usually not better than the original but this was one of the exceptions. I wanted this for my collection. Excellent price ,good quality and audio and quick prime shipping
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This is a Good book if you like sci-fi, time travel books. Some of the words are difficult to read and understand.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|What happens when a clever lawyer who does not hesitate to get his hands dirty in the commerce of the judicial system encounters a situation when he must right a wrong once committed? The Lincoln Lawyer offers the expected plot twists and building tension but in how a seemingly amoral lawyer changes when he finds he must redeem himself.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I don't know what the point is for this game. I never seem to accomplish anything except more prizes and coins. There was no challenge here and although I  played for a few months,  I ended up deleting it because there was no end in sight and no real way to win.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I like this CD very much.  I was watching Nashville on TV and was happy to hear that they had made a CD.  I will recommend it to my friends.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|It's based upon a true story about a family who had the courage and love to stand against all kinds of social pressure and as a result made a difference in lives of many. Sandra Bullock is one of my favs; the other cast members were very good also.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|The first thing that needs to be addressed is that this is not a movie but a show.  I thought it was a movie when i rented it and was a bit disapointed.  The show was fabulous and the techniques were amazing.  I was so impressed by the quality of the acrabatics.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This series is absolutely amazing.  The acting and the story lines are awesome.  I was inbetween series and waiting for new ones to start and needed something else to sink my teeth in to.  This is it!  You'll love this high functioning, sociopathic Sherlock and the adorable Dr. Watson.
B008VVT51U|4.0|The movie is calm; no real highs or lows. The actors are going through a change in their lives and they do it in a run down hotel in India.  I find it funny the power movies have over us and the brainwashing that it tries to do.  In this movie they try to make you feel bad for homosexuals, make you feel unmarried sexual relationships are okay because of loneliness, and that marriages that are strained should just end.  They show the only married couple splitting and doing it as easy as &#34;turning left&#34;.  Besides this lack of morality I did enjoy the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The story is amazing!  Not only do you love the characters and are driven by their stories, the special effects are incredible.  You are transformed with this cast of people.  You cheer for them, grieve for them and at the end of the day you are left wanting more.  No character is safe.  That is what it would be like if we were actually in a zombie apocalypse.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Easy to use but with lots of customization options.<br /><br />The most recent update added several features that makes Feedly even easier and faster to use.
B00AWD4I6C|5.0|I love Resident Evil. One of my all time favorite sequels. I only rented this to show a friend, but I have seen this movie about 30 times.
B000XXGMRO|5.0|Me encantan son muy comoda fue la talla q solicite muy buenas duraderas y no me las quito nunca jajaja
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|I love the Matrix. This is the best movie ever made. It blows my mind how this movie could be real and we would never even know. Watch all of them!!!
B004X2M9VY|5.0|This round of Doctor Who with the Ponds has been great.<br />A lot of depth of characters and story development once you watch the entire series.<br />Highly recommend.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Because I could not play it..it kept telling  I couldn't sign in....you tell me what  wrong?<br />Would not accept my  email or pass word?????
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This is a cute, funny, feel good movie, highly enjoyed it. Would recommend it when you are stressed and just need a break.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish there were some more comparable books.  I really really liked the plot and character development, and the ending was suitable.  anyone have recommendations
B00BF11STU|4.0|Wow. Very interesting. I have often wondered what interrogations might be like. The characters were great. Lots of twists and having to pay attention to make sense, but it was good
B000OLROWC|1.0|I wasn't able to watch it. Apple and Amazon instant video don't  work together. I was very disappointed that the 2 giants do not have an agreement.<br />:(
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Had no idea what to expect but I loved this bizarre movie. Original story line. Kept my attention. Highly recommended
B00B5D2V7G|5.0|I really hope that they make Season 3 of American Horror Story...it is a great show with excellent writing, acting and story!  A++++
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I have been a huge fan of this series. Possibly they have beat all the bushes and just need to let this series go.  I have no clue what was spent on this last movie but I was way too much. It made no sense, it's story is starting to go I to circles and bored me terribly. I couldn't even finish the dang movie.  I had hoped the story would turn to the survival of the small cluster of people that had been found on the Arcadia...... Nope! Don't waste your money or time
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the kindle app, it's amazing! I can take my stories anywhere with me, what more could I ask for!
B002APU580|5.0|I am a die hard romantic. Love time pieces and history. Not many exchanges between Mr. Darcy and Liz but when there are they are good.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story and very well written. I had to dole it out so I wouldn't finish it too quickly. Highly recommended! Can't wait to see if there will be more....
B009HV2JT8|1.0|I had heard this was good.  I kept waiting till it got better and then the movie was over. Bored. Disappointed
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show!  Can't think of another show to compare it with.  Can't wait to see what happens next. Love the characters!
B000YH6YG8|4.0|Loved how this movie was so thought provoking. Breaks boundaries on stereotypes. Allows one to see why these things might occur.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|this is a movie that isvery  good forkids. Its nice to see movies like this. We do not have many movies we can watch as a family.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I was so glad I rented this. I had looked forward to its release and was terribly disappointed. I fell asleep and had to restart it four times.  It seemed to drag on and in my opinion there were way too many computer generated creatures. Made me sad to think it fell away from the LOTR series that I love so much. I won't watch it again
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Fits nicely in my kindle and is a very well built cord! Just the feel of it you can tell its a good product and its very sturdy so you don't need to worry about it breaking<br /><br />Over all there's nothing wrong with it! I would recommend this to anybody it worth the money!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is so much more than the zombies that non watchers focus on. Amazing series, Always different each season. This series makes me think through our human nature and all we have been taught that is good and right.  With the break down of society as we know it.  Humans become animalistic themselves just to survive. Kindness and helping a stranger are no longer even conceivable. To want to have children... No longer a acceptable. This series just amazes me and every season has gotten better.
B007HU4FJ8|5.0|I keep watching it over and over. It helps me have a better understanding of the bible. I feel closer to Jesus..
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I didn't know what to expect. This is not a remake of The old movie. I enjoyed the storyline and a glimpse at what a person might think our future looks like.
B006MPKE9O|4.0|I found this book made Barcelona come alive and was very well written. If I put it down for a couple of days it was a little hard to get back into. The readability factor that I yearn was not as prevalent as in others that I have read.<br />Fascinating premise to the book with some interesting sub plots.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|If you're a fan of the show you will probably like the books too.  They're surprisingly quite good for being a show promo with a secret author.  Whoever wrote them should have put their name on them! :)
0307352153|5.0|The book was lucid and thorough as well as well written. It seems to be an up to date review of present research.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|It's so hard to find good clean shows let alone with such excellent wr!!iting and acting. Enjoying every minute of this series!
0812550757|5.0|Interesting as a stand alone story. Also good as the sequel to Ender's Game but a completely different story and in a far off place. I enjoyed it very much.
B0041KVXLK|4.0|This was a remaster version and it sounds great. A 180g LP and double fold cover. It also had a booklet inside and some cut out things that came out when they first released the album back in the 60's. This is not a mono version, the stereo mix is quite apparent, but I like the old stereo mixes.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a nice app I like to bake so I need to how cake pops are going to come out in the boxes I buy so it's a really neat app
B0010X758Q|3.0|I love this album a lot. Im not sure if I just got a bad pressing or what because there was issues on the first play. Some indents and blemishes on the disc. It is also not a high quality thickness, the thinnest the can make a record actually. But I love owning a piece of music and I love the music on regardless.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I must say people compare this series with 50 shades (which I am obsessed with) but it's different, it's.... crossfire!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been using Evernote to share my articles and documents with my Kindle and PC, allowing me to access them anywhere at anytime.  Evernote is a versatile, cloud-like functional tool.
B005ERIRZE|1.0|Sorry this isn't a review of the book - the pricing is insulting and makes me want to avoid all Penguin books.  I really hope the publishers read this - there are several four letter words I have for them not fit to print.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|This is my husband's favorite movie, he watches it at least twice a week. He's watched it so much, I may need to order another one!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really wasted time and money on this.  I can't believe anyone thought this was a decent book.  The characters were ridiculous.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I Love playing subway surfers. I like how the background changes with the holidays. The whole family plays subway surfers, even dad.
B0045JYHQA|5.0|Pearl is the album that really put Janis over the top and brought her into mainstream music. This is Joplin at her finest with her signature gravel, bluesy based voice in songs, such as her classic hit Move Over. There are two versions of another classic Joplin song, Cry Baby, with her typical raspy wail. Also a hit for her on this album was the Kris Kristofferson penned song, Me and Bobby McGee. Her short, but sweet original song Mercedes Benz is a yearning for something she doesn't have in spite of the fact that she works so hard for her money. It's the kind of song that replays over and over in your mind. In fact, all the songs on the album do just that, a trip down memory lane when life appeared to be so carefree and full of youthful ventures. Pearl is a must have for blues fans and classic rock fans alike. It makes me think just about the heights Joplin may have soared to in the music world if we only didn't lose her at such a young age.
B001C34HUS|5.0|Easy words. Effective mind sets!<br />Very simple to understand. Great advice.<br />It's all about method and how to train your mind
B004132HZS|5.0|This is a superb rendition of the the legendary stories. It's a hit for a reason and the acting could not have been better. Benedict Cumberbatch as SHERLOCK was a match-made in heaven. His side-kick played by Martin Freeman compliments Cumberbacth's role perfectly. They could not have chosen a better pair. The mysteries and effects just make the entire series more enjoyable. Brilliant!
B002ZB26AO|4.0|I really liked the way this non-fiction book was written.  The author's following of several different characters and families brought it to life.  It was certainly thought provoking and brought some understanding of that very closed country.  However the book was written several years ago so I am not sure if things are still the same in North Korea.  If they are, it certainly makes one wonder how the current regime dares to militarily provoke the United States.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a can't miss series,  I read the books and don't have cable TV so  this is how I do HBO.  It just takes some patience waiting for the next season to show up.
1575666286|5.0|Got more than my monies worth. Recommend to any one who wants to be healthier.Using it to cure an autoimmune disease.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Interesting enough to keep me watching. It did not go the way I would have chosen, but I am not the writer.  A reasonably well acted series.  Darryl and Merle were good while they lasted. Rick was loosing me, and the damn Governor is still alive. I really wanted Michone to take his head.  Now they have taken in Woodbury refugees and they still don't have much in the way of groceries.  They'll have to range wider for the scrounging and who knows where that will lead?
044024238X|5.0|I love reading Sophie Kinsellas books and this one was excellent, i love the twists and turns in the story and it ended well. Recommended for any one to read.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love that you can obtain levels easily at first then they get harder as you go on.  I do wish they would let you know what the next shark is going to cost before you spend all your coins.  Keeps me entertained as much as Temple Run.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well I love this so, only thing, I have no idea how to update it for new themes. -_- Other than that is fun and addicting and highly recommended.
B002S0KB4K|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. In a fashion typical of Le<br />Carre, interesting and multidimensional characters are placed in<br />situations that become increasingly complex, thus facing choices<br />which drive the plot forward. It's not my all-time favorite Le<br />Carre novel. For example, I enjoyed \\"The Constant<br />Gardener\\", \\"Absolute Friends\\" and \\"The Mission Song\\" even more,<br />but it's very engaging.
0767812387|5.0|Didn't think i would like this movie as much but, its a really good movie. I would recommend this to the people who loves romance and salsa/tango dancing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Could not put it down . Most everyone I know has commented on the sexual content of this book, which was very intense but it really was the story line and character development that kept me interested . I found myself getting board with the sex scenes and would quickly skim thru just to get to the next part of the story . Hope the story continues in some way .
B003MC5N28|5.0|My English class is reading this book right now but, I wanted to read it for myself so I got it for my Kindle Touch. It was a bit pricey but it was totally worth it!!! This book makes you think and almost made me cry at the end. The end is a bit of a confusion though. But, this is an amazing science fiction/fantasy book and I really loved it. You should really get this book. I reccommend this to everyone. This book has love, feelings, and emotion as the main character, Jonas goes on a journey to give his people the feelings he feels and wants to give them, and to change something. You really should get this book! I'm 12 and I'm reading this stuff and it's great! But, I think some people exaggerate too much on the fact that there's some sexual content in there, as for me: I don't care. And it's just what we call a 'wet dream'. Calm down people, it's really not that big of a deal. (My only question: Does Jonas die or does he get to Elsewhere???) Again, LOVE THIS BOOK! Fans of Lois Lowry, like me, were BORN to read this!!!!
B00AFOS6QG|5.0|Incredibly good record. The sound is softer, sounds modern(in a good way), is different. All nine songs are excellent. \\"We no who u r\\", \\"Wide lovely eyes\\", \\"Water's edge\\" and \\"Mermaids\\" could crossover to normal folks. \\"Higgs boson blues\\" and \\"Push the sky away\\" are definitely for us. I have been listening to Nick Cave since almost the beginning and through ups and not so up times. This is the good stuff, it can be appreciated for a lot of people.<br /><br />*Expending some extra bucks in the Deluxe Edition is worthy just for the elegant booklet. I don't know about the DVD, don't have the patient to sit and watch.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this alarm app in my Kindle.  I have chosen bells to wake me up each morning and so far it has not failed.  it's easy to use and one can download tunes as well.  Great!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is a very well written book. I enjoyed the writer's style, which was so realistic and well written, without being overly descriptive. So well written that I could easily visualize every scene. The author leads you up to the each point in the plot. For anyone who enjoys well written prose and adventure.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I Love it can't wait for next season 2 to come out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :-) I watch this show twice now it never bourding.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|was easy to follow and entertaining<br />liked the suspense and the puzzle of the book<br />nice on the kindle thanks
B0060MYM7O|4.0|i like the blu ray version of this series. it is nice that a dvd version is included so i can watch it on my computer too.
B0095P31L6|4.0|The kids liked it, but the parents had more fun. The humor is very subtle at times and the story is geared more for adults. Well done!
1616550414|5.0|I absolutely love the art. there is a lot of conceptual art that is very intriguing, and the story is really put in to perspective here. The bonus content in the back is also wonderful!!! I definitely recommend this for any fans of The Legend of Zelda!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I saw this in the theater when it came out and wanted to see it again. I hope the sequel stands up to this one.
B008K93302|3.0|This was not a user friendly interface. But once you figure it out it serves it purpose.<br /><br />There are other players out there that are a little easier to use.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|It is a shame that the mighty Zep will not tour. They still are the best hard rock band ever!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I find it fun and helpful. I'm a big horse fan and I just love this app. It's perfect for me! :-)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Lots of fun! Good for all ages.  Not as mentally challenging as crossword puzzles but visually a really stimulating one.
B008M87GJK|5.0|BBC is a quality news outlet. The information is up to date and the reporting is very objective unlike many other news outlets.
B009S33I68|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read about Vietnam  Both 1-7 and 2-7 Cavalry battled a fierce enemy that threw everything they had at them. Our Vietnam veterans should be remembered as heroes they were also a great generation of warriors
B00992CF6W|5.0|Add updates like the pc version update this version when you update it but add all the stuff on pc version please
B000P5FH3K|4.0|I did not realize THE RAINMAKER was released a few weeks before the sensational [[ASIN:B004SIP7ZS Good Will Hunting]], which I assumed was Matt Damon's introduction to the movie-going public.  That was quite the surprise, but I digress.  Playing attorney Rudy Baylor, Damon is solid and believable as a naive, wet-behind-the-ears officer of the court willing to take on a formidable insurance company for refusing to cover the costs of a procedure that might have saved the life of a young man dying of leukemia.  Furthermore, Damon is aided by a crafty paralegal (Danny DeVito) not afraid to push the ethical envelope in order to gain an advantage over an opponent.  Add on top of that the rescue, and budding romance, of a young, physically abused wife (Claire Danes), and director Francis Ford Coppola's plate is full as he delivers his version of the John Grisham novel.<br /><br />Yet as the title to this review suggests, there are no eye-opening twists, or turns, or surprises in this courtroom thriller; furthermore, the insurance company's high-priced legal team is led by a smug, condescending attorney (Jon Voight is fantastic), and the trial is presided over by a conservative, defendant-loving judge (Dean Stockwell).  Predictably young Rudy is on over his head, he's thwarted at every attempt to introduce evidence or file for discovery or deliver a witness, and he encounters setback after setback.  Only after the testimony of a former insurance company employee, who was the actual claims handler (the beautiful Virginia Madsen), does the plaintiff's case gain momentum, culminating in a \\"Gotcha!\\" moment when the company's CEO (Roy Scheider) is put on the stand and asked to read from the corporate claims manual.  Again, as the viewer we readily know where this movie is going, and how it will end, yet it's still riveting and very much compelling.  THE RAIN MAKER is proof positive that a predictable courtroom thriller can be good, because it's a darn fine film in its own right.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|it's one of the funniest movies ever. just watch to see how ted is trying to get his master's attention by persuading him to forget  his girl friend. they all reconciled in the end anywhere. love it.
B0060FXBNM|4.0|It's a nice package, only thing I miss are the 2nd disc of extras of every movie, I thought it came with those.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Would recommend this movie. its one of the best movies I've ever watched. it was awesome how the guy and his Bengal tiger survived. a great one indeed.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Nice Package to really remember this great movies in Full HD, extras are very good! I truly Recomend this Bluray Pack
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Just read the second in the series about the Camel Club; &#34;The Collectors&#34;.  The different personalties and talents of the club members keep you guessing which way the tale's going.  Looking forward to the third in the series, &#34;Stone Cold.&#34;
0345531965|5.0|This was recommended by a friend and I was so excited to receive it. I bought this with four other items at the same time, and I was very happy to see this as the first item to come in the mail. Exactly what I ordered, and more than great delivery time. Thanks!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It's lame it was already on my kindle and it was useless<br />I think it was terrable and stupid thank you I'm sorry I made that up it was  quite helpful:):)
B0044XV3R8|3.0|First disc of two has a section that doesn't play, &#34;stutters, so to speak.&#34;  I didn't explore returning it for a replacement, my bad....
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I liked the story but yet it felt like something was missing.  It was enjoyable but it was not a 5.
0307950689|3.0|So, I read so many negative reviews of this book I thought I would write my own.  Although, this is not Dan Brown's best Novel; it is a FUN and EXCITING read.  The setting is Washington D.C. and our hero Robert Langdon gets stuck in another precarious position and has another adventure, this time through the familiar area of our Nation's Capital.  Does this book read like a movie script?  Yes.  Is this book fast paced and a page turner? Yes.  I am giving the book three stars because it does have points where I felt like I was reading a Deepak Chopra novel and it felt like Dan was trying to explain why he feels the way he feels about Religion through Robert and Katherine more than developing the characters and storyline.  I do find the way the book flows a complete 180 from where the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons flowed.  If you are expecting another one of those types of novels then this read is not for you.  If you are a Dan Brown fan and are looking for just a solid entertaining read, then by all means pick up this novel.
B00358ESI4|4.0|The movie portrayed the era I grew up in and I enjoyed some of those aspects.  While I  was in the military during this period I never went to Vietnam.  Many of my friends did and not all of them came back.  Consequently I have difficulties watching some of these movies, guilt I guess, seeing what my friends went through  I find this movie to be entertaining but disturbing.
0788859544|1.0|I purchased this for my daughter and it is totally bogus.  The movie cuts between scenes and has random chinese writing at the bottom of scenes.  Also, in the menu it plays itzy bitzy spider and no the real movie music.  Very disappointing.
B000G1ALRK|5.0|I love the selection of songs.  After purchasing Chief I knew I had to get this CD.  Turns out it is just as good.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|Fun game.  Challenging, but not too difficult.  Was able to complete the levels fairly quickly.  The game is Relaxing and addicting.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The main page displays temperature in big numbers for easy reading. Easy access to a raft of information such as wind speed, sunrise and sunset and dew point. Other saved locations can be accessed simply by sliding the screen to the left or right, very nice feature.
B00BJS7LHC|5.0|I loved this movie. I had to watch it twice. It is filled with love, action, friendship....just a really good must see movie.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|I ordered this with full understanding that the packaging and extras were \\"no frills\\". I simply wanted the remastered versions of these albums in my collection. I only had the 2-disc greatest hits (which has amazing sound quality). The first five albums did not disappoint. Then I listened to The Long Run. What happened here?? The volume level is way lower than the other albums. When comparing to Long Run songs included on the 2 disc greatest hits, there is no comparison. This collection is an easy 5 stars if it were not for this incredibly strange decision by Warner to not present all albums with the same remastering.<br /><br />1/26/14 Update....  Thanks to those who recommended contacting Rhino. While it took a while, I received a proper version of The Long Run in the mail yesterday. This product now gets a 5 Star review from me!!
B00BGICGJ8|5.0|This was way to funny. But there are lots of scene that I rather my kids not see. For adults or mature folks...this is a very funny movie... especially if you can relate to the whole spousal love hate relationship thing.
B000LMPE0S|3.0|Mr. Hackett's sixth venture into the realm of \\"solo artist\\" (Why, oh why couldn't he and his old band get along enough to prevent his departure?) clearly outdistances his previous release that was done in by awkwardly screechy vocals and programmed drums. Unfortunately, Hackett continues with his insistence on Highly Strung of singing a few numbers in the numbing upper registry used earlier. The lead-off song Camino Royale suffers because of it. His voice, though, is startlingly beautiful when he stays in the lower ranges. Thank goodness that Hackett went back to the full-band sound on this one. Highlights include India Rubber Man, Hackett to Pieces, and Give It Away, among others. Highly Strung is not among his best but definitely is a staple of any admirer's collection.
B001B6PBBK|1.0|I only watched this movie cause of Brittany Murphy playing a role in it. But it was not funny at all.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I really needed this dictionary it is simple to use the instruction for use the voice activation is nice when you never used one before. I really like this dictionary.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|This is not your classic Andrea Boccelli collection.It is a collection of love songs and classics meant more for easy listening.My wife and daughter liked it too-a must for those who appreciate good mood music
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Romance, suspense, war time drama, a little subtle comedy, beautiful people, and a reasonable price. What more can you ask for?
0345803493|4.0|this book had me wanting more. i enjoyed this book very much and told my friends about it,and looked forward to the next book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a typical Sparks novel. If you like Sparks, you will like this one. A simple love story with a little twist.
0345803507|3.0|it was just o.k. , i wish there had bend more to this book.  it was hard to read as well
B0064QNS62|1.0|this app is stupid. the controls are horrible, and the app is constantly crashing, kind of like all of the other free apps of the day. this app is so NOT worth it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Any woman needing to define purpose or looking for permission to be who they truly are will enjoy this book.  I do not agree with EVERY point she makes but the content of the book can be life changing for someone searching or themslves.
B00899F0G8|5.0|My teenager love this show. It's something new and exciting each episode.  My teenager own all the recent seasons. I like it because it's not the basic sex and foul language that most TV shows have  for adolescence
1439156816|4.0|A lot of reading, but by persisting, found there were many valuable pieces of information to apply to my own writing.
B000001Y16|5.0|If you are a fan of Rap, real rap, not that Lil Wayne, Baby and Gucci Mane crap, you know that this is real hip-hop.<br />Definitely one of the greatest artist of all time.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I have been looking for a app just like this. Fast and easy to use. Of all the notebooks I have tried this is the best. Works great on a kindle fire hd 8.9
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Not just a surfing movie, visually stunning .. Get caught up in the story .. Have tissues you will need them
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Best short story I have read in some time. Absolutely loved it. I'm going to try to find more books by this author.
B006LSZECO|4.0|How does one dream up such a story!?  I was a tiny bit disappointed in the ending.  It was not one I was expecting.  It is on the NY bestseller list and I understand why.  It was well written.
B003V5CFV8|3.0|This is an ok movie, but certainly not great.  I was drawn to watch it because the soundtrack is so terrific, but was disappointed.  The writers could have done so much more with the script, but just didn't deliver ~ unless random, unnecessary, out-of-character swearing was what they were attempting to showcase.  The excess of foul language really takes a lot away from this otherwise satisfactory movie, and the ending also seems a bit limp and &#34;meh&#34;.<br />If you are considering buying (or even renting) this movie, you'd probably do just as well to watch the song clips that contain those bits of the movie and the trailer on YouTube.  You won't be missing much and it's free.<br />It does have some amusing bits, but the excessive foul language, mediocre story line and over-done plain stupidity and unrealistic &#34;dumb racist southern&#34; slant far outweigh those.  The soundtrack, however, is absolutely beautiful.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|I was on a quest to see more Gerard Butler movies after seeing Olympus Has Fallen in the theater last week. A friend recommended this one. Very suspenseful. He and Jamie Fox were both.fantastic.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I found it interesting and well acted from the first episode till the last.  I plan to purchase season two.
B00190OHD6|5.0|I put off seeing this one because I thought it was going to be depressing but I was on a Gerard Butler kick so I took a chance. What a lovely love story. Upbeat and fun to watch. Couldn't wait for each letter to come. I was really glad I rented it.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Great product. I use Avast in my home computers. I would recommend this product to use for your mobile security.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I've had my case for approx. 2 months and am very pleased with it.  The strap holds the case securely closed.  Hands-free standing feature works well also.  Kindle seems well protected.  For the cost, I feel that this product was a very good purchase.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Great surfing movie and heartwarming family drama. Gerard Butler is excellent and actually learned to surf to do this movie.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Another great book in the sword of truth series.  Terry Goodkind is one of the best authors out there. I highly recommend this book.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Really enjoyed the book, a good read with unexpected turns. Will be looking for more Gillian Flynn books in future.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|Item arrived on time. The watch is good looking but was a little disappointed with the size of the watch, its kind a small on my wrist, My mistake I did not actually look in to detail regarding the size. Its has an automatic movement and was on sale. I am keeping it. No problem.<br />Actually it looked nice on my wife's wrist compared to mine
0345803485|5.0|Found it really interesting. I would recommend it to those who want to feel passion!!!! Book itself was in a great shape when I received it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put it down!!  Great read!  A good love story!  Can't wait for book two!  Best love story!  Laters baby!
B003J27WFW|5.0|This DVD is really great if you are a fan of the Greatest Rock and Roll Band in History. It covers much of their early history from the formation of the rock icon until they became a major force in rock and roll.<br /><br />There are several interesting interviews with band members. Additionally, you get a few snippets of the boys playing in high school gyms, etc and lots of excerpts from older songs and some videos.<br /><br />This is an opportunity to learn a lot about the band and the individual members, including what happened to the original drummer (that's right, it wasn't Neil).<br /><br />I have watched it several times and refuse to loan it. Great DVD!
B005K17RU0|3.0|Previous version was nice &amp; simple ... showed today's weather and you could select multiple days if you wanted.  Now you swipe sideways to view all the info and it includes all kinds of video links to unrelated info.  More is not always better.  Bleh....
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Got the movie and was a little concerned because the disk had dislodged itself. Everything was fine though and I love the movie!
0553386697|5.0|Great! It is as posted and is being used in the study it was ordered for. Thank you for the product.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|My family watched this movie since we were trying out streaming videos for the first time. It played very well and the picture was excellent, although the movie itself was odd. It had some very funny moments, but a lot of weird ones that made my husband and me wonder what the filmmakers were on when they made it. Overall, it's a typical kids' movie--good triumphs over evil, happy ending, etc. so it's pleasing in that respect.
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|Not as funny as expected, became rather dark and depressing! I get these are real life issues that we can probably all relate to...but I don't need a movie about it. With the genius that is Apatow and crew...it wasn't what I was hoping it would be! That said everyone involved is still &uuml;ber talented and did a wonderful job! Keep em coming
B003THJA1G|5.0|Combines suspense, drama, comedy, & romance in a family friendly format.  Characters show growth and substance & the actors have great chemistry together.  The references to cultural events and prior or existing media provide oportunities to stimulate your entertainment trivia knowledge.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As is expected the second of a trilogy is a stepping stone to the next installment. I shall be starting that immediately to get to the exciting conclusion. What a grand story!
B00992CF6W|5.0|6.99 is worth it by far. Very fun game love it totally what they say it is. I don't have a thing to complain about no glitches.
B005ONTD42|3.0|This is a fun toy that has no actual use other than as a toy, that is easily tired of.  Most of these are in the junk drawer, I'm sure.
B00BU2SIW4|4.0|Paraphrasing another review, even if they played bachata (I am exaggerating), I would buy their album. This is not the best album ever, but it is indeed Depeche Mode's sound. Play a song for thirty seconds, ignore David's voice, and you will never guess who the band is other than Depeche Mode. The only reason why I didn't give the album 5 stars is because I was expecting songs with a little more beat, rather than dark and obscure sounds. I love &#34;Heaven&#34; and &#34;Soothe My Soul&#34;, and the more I listen to the album, the more I like the rest of the songs. Listening to this album is like drinking a bottle of old fashioned Amarone without trying first a vibrant Californian Merlot. You just won't get it if you don't know the history of DM.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|We are just this week watching it through again. It NEEDS a sequel. I read somewhere that there was a movement to buy the rights and do just that. I certainly would buy it.
0618001905|4.0|King Leopold of Belgium wanted to have a colony like most other European countries had at the time.  He settled on what is now the Congo.  King Leopold's Ghost recounts the greed and savagery that fell on the natives of Africa during this time period.  This was the time of slave trading and massive killing in other parts of Africa as well.  The author does a good job of providing information on this time period in human history.  For the most part it isn't pretty.  Like the Holocaust of World War II, it is difficult to understand how humans could treat one another so poorly.  Yet it is a portion of our history, and King Leopold's Ghost tells it like it was.
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|I loved the movie so much that now I am looking forward to the second part of the movie next
0446580848|4.0|OK, if I thought he'd hit a home run, I would have ranked the book as 'I loved it.'  The Panther is entertaining, and John Corey is his usual sarcastic and amusing self.  The story line gets a bit far fetched by the end, with Corey and crew nearly escaping death just a few too many times.  He ultimately tracks down all of the bad guys, as usual.  It seemed to take a long time to get there.  I've read several DeMille books and enjoy his style.  The Panther was a fun read and not quite as enticing as most of the others, in my opinion.
1616550414|4.0|I am extremely happy with this book for many reasons. I've always been a fan of the Legend of Zelda series ever since I played A Link to the Past. This book is pretty much what any collector and Zelda fanatic must have. There is plenty of concept art and it's funny to see the many iterations of Ganondorf and Link. The hardcover is beautiful however my only gripe is there's the weird DarkHouse logo on the spine. It's just my opinion but it looks funny when you have such a decorated book and you have that icon just POPPING out there.<br /><br />I think my favorite part about this book is also my reason for giving 4 stars instead of 5; the history of Hyrule. Of course, the storyline is still tentative even to the creators of TLOZ, but they do a great job in laying out the stories and multiple timelines that occurred throughout the series. I just wish that they could have gone into even more depth in some of the stories for the games. Some of them felt very vague and short to me. I also wish there were more notes on the characters in the concept art. There are a few here and there but I know there was a lot more discussion than was put into the book.<br /><br />But don't let my pickyness stop you from picking this up. You don't have to be a dedicated gamer to buy this. Even if you've only played a few LOZ games, this is still a great book to pick up if you enjoy the series. Looks nice on the bookshelf or on the coffee table for looks. I've definitely had friends come by that were more than happy to flip through the pages and enjoy the art.

B005QUQP76|5.0|I have been using a trackball mouse for some time and wanted to switch to a more traditional mouse. This is the first mouse I tried. Turns out that it will be the only mouse I will need to try. It fits perfectly in my hand. Also the DPI settings are amazing.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|needed up ordering the 5in 1 but was a good case will buy it again still have it color style just what I was looking for
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It is a real page turner..  Unusual. Lots of twists.<br />Would recommend to all who like a mystery.  It is fast moving.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|This is the same old running game that you everywhere it just happens to be more colorful and higher rated because the graphics and character are for children. You will be pestered by adds every five seconds when you touch the upgrade or me screen in the game. The sound track is all right, but otherwise this game is really just bad. This game has you out running an inspector through a train yard rather than running from monkeys in a temple. Coins are incredibly hard to get... you can get like five hundred to a thousand per run, but even so the character sometimes cost hundreds of thousands of coins to get. So expect to be running over and over again through a colorful boring train yard. Other characters can only be unlocked by getting special items from a mysterious box which are rare and they only give one of the items required. Most of the character require you get their hundred to five hundred items to unlock them. Only get this game if you are desperate to find an app on a boring weakens otherwise there are MUCH MUCH better games out there than this one you just have to look for them. This is only my opinion. Have fun searching for apps if you take my advice and don't fall in with the thousands of others who downloaded this disappointing game.
1451695187|5.0|Much has been written about the near death experience [NDE] and many noted medical professionals have tried to explain the &#34;unexplainable&#34; event termed death of the physical body/brain and the survival of the consciousness that lives in it. Dr Alexander makes a 'bulletproof' case for the immortality of the soul as he writes about his own incredible journey outside of his body including his being pronounced brain dead [flat lined] for days by the medical profession and his shocking return to perfect health. A must read for those who are serious about exploring this subject. It really invites you to reconsider who you think you are if you are a fence sitter.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Truly. Amazing. I was laughing one minute then crying the next. I felt connected to hazel grace and Augustus. John Green, you. Did. Amazing.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Loved it from start to finish.  Great inspriring story of survival and spritual discovery.  Recommended for everyone but some of the discriptions can be very intense and graphic.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I usually enjoy true stories about WWII and this is no exception.  It is unusual to read the details of both sides of the battles.  The personal details of WWII stories are disappearing as veterans fade away.  Hope the remaining  witnesses to history record their memories before it is too late.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I am taken by mans courage in war and the sheer terror they encountered. I find it ironic that men on both sides were Christian, both praying to god to save them as the try to kill the other. I wonder where God was in this situation. Excellent book. My hat is off to men of honor who fulfilled their duty in an exercise that is, quiet frankly shameful, that of war. Good read.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Just when you think you know all the answers, the plot thickens. That's why you can't put Gone Girl down. Very interesting, keeps you thinking, and on the edge of your seat. Great book!
B004UPANGM|3.0|It's ok for an 80's movie.  Special FX were a bit cheesy but again its an 80's movie not a high end Wes Craven movie.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|All of the actors in this show are fantastic. I've never seen a show that I&#34;m cringing one moment, laughing the next and in deep thought as the credits scroll by.<br /><br />My favorite show.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I could not stop reading,  My Granddaughter loved them and wanted me to read them, I am so glad she did.
0061950726|5.0|On first glance, a book about an old woman who rode the orphan train and had a series of difficult home experiences, and a 17-year-old foster kid who's been from home to home, might not seem like a heartwarming thing to read. However, this was one of the most surprising and enjoyable novels I've read so far this year.<br /><br />The topic is fascinating. I had never heard of the orphan train, and to read about the sheer number of kids who were taken from urban centers like New York, and brought into the heartland to be adopted out to anyone needing a farm hand or help around the house - well, it was staggering. The author combined a lot of historical details with her characters so we developed not only a basic understanding of this ongoing event in history, but a great deal of empathy for the orphans who had little choice but to go.<br /><br />When I loved best about this book is the way the author obviously wanted us to like her main characters. It reminded me of authors like Maeve Binchy, who go out of their way to make sure the reader is actually enjoying him or herself. Many authors seem to take a perverse pleasure in giving us unlikable or difficult characters who can be hard to relate to, but from the very first pages I wanted both Molly and Vivian to become friends and to feel happy and fulfilled in their lives.<br /><br />Overall, I'd highly recommend this book if you're looking for something with enough depth to keep you interested, yet enough good feelings to make it an enjoyable and inspiring read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I thought that this game was very fun. It was a brilliant game with new updates always being made and a competitive side as you can challenge Facebook friends
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This series showcases some very well-written and believable characters. A joy to watch, with beautiful scenery, well-honed scripts, and talented actors combined.
B009FZFONO|3.0|This season started off amazing and very intense but then it kind of just drug for the rest of the season.  Its almost as if the writers hit the peak of this season too early. However I did like this season but in comparison to the previous seasons, I consider this one the worst. The Character development came to a stand still and introduction of new characters seemed pointless for about 90% of the new characters.  If you are already  a fan of the show I would recommend watching it. If not, watch season 1 and 2 first and then watch this season.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm always a big fan of dystopian future novels that bring something new to the genre. Probably one of the best things in Wool is the character set. The author does a great job of building up real believable characters who have lives that you believe and trust inside the system they live in. Additionally the pacing of the book is excellent. You feel the need to keep \\"turning the pages\\" (in quotes as I read it as an ebook).<br /><br />Feels like a throwback to the days of Phillip K. Dick and Asimov. Highly recommended.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the third book in the series of the Game Of Thrones. As like the last two, I have it 5 stars. This one has more twist in it and I was completely surprised by the ending. Very hard to put down. My only complaint is that a few of the chapters seemed only to serve th  purpose if filling space. We don't need to know anything more about Davos, yet he is a character that has one of the most time in the book. Yet, that is my only complaint. Masterfully written.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I didn't like it as much as book 1 and 2.  I think it gets kind of slow in the middle.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|The Blu-Ray copy of Schindler's List is impeccable to say the least. The entire movie is contained on one disc and the detail definitely shines through. The only downside would be that the special features are imported from the previous release onto a lone dvd disc in standard definition.<br /><br />Video - 5/5<br />Audio - 5/5<br />Features 3/5<br /><br />Overall 4.5/5.

B003WKOU0G|5.0|I use this video with my Marriage and Family class along with a study guide I developed.  It gives them the opportunity to simply observe 4 babies around the world.  Two in Industrilized countries and 2 in developing nations.  It shows differences in contrasting the 4 cultures but it also shows similiarities.  There is no dialogue to sway your thoughts or judgmental narration.  You as the observer simply have the pleasure of watching, observing and drawing your own conclusions.<br /><br />Great study of babies from zero years old to 2 years old.  If nothing else it does the mind, body and soul good just to take some time to look at these four babies:  Watching them grow, laugh, coo, build relationships with both parents and siblings as well as household pets.  For the audience it relieves tension and gives hope in the future generation for tomorrow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i couldn't put it down! i was on a countdown ever since they announced that it was going to be a movie. This book is my favorite in the trilogy. I am currently on a countdown until Catching Fire comes out..... 7 months and 18 days..... and counting
0465068367|5.0|I'm not a historian, bust simply someone who was curious about World War II having begun on 1931 rather than 1939 or 41 as textbooks often state. I have deep admiration for Chang, for having the courage to write this. If you're on the fence about buying it you should research where Chang is now and how she got there. She is a clear, vivid writer, who understands shock value and uses it in this book, making it a quick and astonishing read. Given all the facts she's brought to life, facts that may have otherwise gone unheard, makes it well worth the price.

1595828753|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of ATLA and I regularly re-watch the episodes. I still laugh at the same jokes and get teary-eyed at the same points. I ordered these books because I want ATLA to have real following and not be forgotten for its greatness. The series was INCREDIBLE.<br /><br />I was hoping these graphic novels would be no different. But I find myself rather agreeing with all of the low rated reviewers. At first read through I found myself laughing with delight esp in Part II. Personally, Zuko is my favorite character so its good to see him too. But there are many issues.  I don't like Kori. I don't like that the storyline is not very strong now super convincing. If Ozai was banished why would he be accessible and still in the Fire Nation? And there is a lot of switching between the various mini stories which don't add to the development of our beloved characters. While I found the little pieces about the lilily livers--students fun loving and cute, it doesn't add to the larger story and themes of Avatar but rather take away. ATLA was so great because the same chacters kept showing up throughout the series, even silly ones like Cabbage Guy or Foaming Mouth Person... so why bring new ones in when there is already a plethora. Additionally the books are too quick. There is much that happens between ATLA and Kora and and I thi k it would totally have been possible to utilize these books as a way to provide that explanation, which perhaps more will be said in Part III which I haven't gotten through yet.<br /><br />Last thing, I feel that even though there are still gaps and when you really thi k about it disappointment, surface-wise a great read, beautiful artistry and skill, and still the same fun spirit is contained within these pages. For me its worth the 7 bucks.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was wonderful.........it had a real story and some really good twists and turns that I didn't figure out, I was actually surprised, and that is really something given the number of books that I read. Well done!

B004A94FE4|3.0|I bought these to improve circulation after running, to expedite recovery time, but they didn't offer much compression like many other recovery pants or tights do.<br /><br />I am 5'10&#34;, but have pretty long legs, probably the legs of someone like 6'2&#34;-6'4&#34;, and I found these tights to be still too short.  you could stretch them out to reach your ankles, but then you get a saggy crotch area that causes resistance when you move around, also, the different material that is meant to support your knee doesn't line up well, so it defeats the purpose of even having these.<br /><br />I ended up returning them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action packed, and a great love story :) Who couldn't ask for more? Would recommend for anyone and a quick and easy read.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Works great but glitchy at times and hard to select thing on touch screen doesn't react very good. Over all its great.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|THis is an excellent depiction of living life with Alzheimers disease and the progression inside the head of a very knowledgeable professor who was aware of the changes she was experiencing. It brought me to tears as I have a close family member who is currently living with some of the same challenges. A must read for those who have an interest in understanding this devastating diagnosis.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|One of the many remarkable things about \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\" is the fact that the album is not thematic at all, but a collection of singles recorded between March of 1966 and June 1967. You wouldn't think such a monumental work could be improved, but the addition of five previously unreleased tracks make this a must buy, even for those of us who have been enjoying the original for so many years.<br /><br />\\"Bad Sign\\" has been critiqued and reviewed thousands of times, but now that these tracks are remastered they are worth revisiting. The title song is a text book example of modern Soul Blues. According to co-writer Booker T, Jones, the song was written especially with King in mind. Booker and the MGs-keyboardist Jones, guitarist Steve Cropper, bass player Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn and drummer Al Jackson, along with the Memphis Horns drive the song with Albert's guitar soaring above everyone. The alternate take<br />is just as muscular as the original. On this track, Albert sings \\"I can't write\\" rather than \\"I can't read\\" in the second verse. He lets out a quiet \\"ow!\\" as if he was aware of the error. Intentional or not, it gives the track a certain charm.<br /><br />The Ivory Joe Hunter classic \\"I Almost Lost My Mind\\" was one of the first blues ballads to feature flute, courtesy of Joe Arnold. Trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love join Arnold to support Albert's impassioned vocals. The minor key \\"As The Years Go Passing By\\" is famous for inspiring the seven note intro to \\"Layla\\"; on this remastered cut Booker's piano is front and center. \\"The Very Thought of You\\" is also brighter than the original release- Cropper's rhythm guitar and the piano are heard to greater advantage, and you have to love to hear Albert stretch out the ending of the tune with his crooning \\"My-y-y-y love\\".<br /><br />The alternate take of \\"Crosscut Saw\\" is a bit longer with an added verse. Dunn's bass is much more prominent on this track, and the alternate takes of \\"The Hunter\\" and \\"Personal Manager\\" are close to the originals, although \\"Personal Manager\\" (take 15!) has a slightly altered horn arrangement.<br /><br />The untitled instrumental is the kind of number musicians play to warm up. King picks some quick notes punctuated by the horn section, while Jackson pushes everyone in an atypical, aggressive style. This track reminds me of an instrumental B.B. King  would cut more than thirty years later, \\"If That Ain't It I Quit\\".<br /><br />I'll admit it- I'm often a sucker for these \\"extra tracks. newly remastered\\" projects. Columbia did a great job with the 50th anniversary of \\"Kind of Blue\\", and Stax has already re-released Albert's \\"I'll Play The Blues For You\\". \\"Bad Sign\\"is equal to those  reissues. Bill Dahl has contributed extensive liner notes, and the original notes are included, along with those from a 2002 reissue. With five never before released tracks and a fine remastering by Joe Tarantino, this may be the reissue of the year.Personal Manager\\" are close to the originals, although \\"Personal Manager\\" (take 15!) has a slightly altered horn arrangement.<br /><br />The untitled instrumental is the kind of number musicians play to warm up.

B008M7BQHE|5.0|I loved this series, wish it wouldn't have ended!  Unlike some other popular series which drag on and on, this show always has some problem that is solved in each episode so that you feel a sense of closure yet there is still anticipation because it leaves something unsolved as well!
B003B02O7I|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is different and a bit strange in some ways with some very interesting twist.  The ending was a bit of a fairy tale but i really liked it.
B00AF6MF9I|1.0|The game is decent. Don't like how if you click on something to buy and you don't have the resources it automatically pops up the screen where you can buy them. Had a clash with customer service when i accidentally spent some of my hard earned medallions due to this feature, and they basically said, tough, be more careful. Fair enough. No more Gameloft games for this customer.

B007HU4FJ8|4.0|Every Christian out there should watch this movie during Holy Week.  There were several scenes in the movie that I would deem to be  “Gratuitous” violence scene such as the scene when the Roman Solders turned the cross upside down in order to bend the nail back into the wood.  However, there is no denying the fact that it is the violence of the crucifixion that gives this film its spiritual gravitas.  Remember, Jesus did go through this for us.

B00B2QA646|1.0|i BOUGHT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ACTORS IN IT. I WAS EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN THE MOVIE. WAS MORE OF A MUSICAL THAT SWITCHED BE SCENES OR HAD TO MUCH DELETED TO FOLLOW. AT ONE POINT SHE IS TALKING TO HER LOVER AT A BALL WALKS THROUGH A SET OF DOORS AND SHE IS IN HER AND HER HUSBANDS BEDROOM. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED
B008602KQI|1.0|Gee, where do I start?<br /><br />I understand the story came from a popular book (which I did not read) and many reviewers here were disappointed in that the film lacked key plot lines and story points from the novel, so I'll limit my comments strictly to the movie as shown.<br /><br />First and foremost, the premise was poorly defined and seemed far from being believable. The hunting scenes reflected very one-dimensional writing lacking in tension (once again, maybe the book was much better). The whole thing was predictable, plodding and simplistic.  What's up with this so-called \\"forest\\"? It sure looked like an artificial world under a dome, did anyone catch that?  You know, kinda like the Truman Show.  And what were these monster-dog things and that instant fire storm? This stuff was apparently generated on-demand from this master control room (also another Truman Show rip-off). The scene with the evil dog-wolf things indicated these creatures were somehow generated on-demand like something from Star Trek's Voyager's Holo-deck (poor CGI, by the way). Were they supposed to be \\"natural\\" animals released into the environment from holding pens?<br /><br />The second problem was the ending: what happened, did they run out of money and just stop filming in the middle of the final scene?  Geez, you had all this big build-up and for what?  We saw scenes of District 11 rioting, what became of that (I suspect the book probably had much more detail)?  There was a hint of some sort of social uprising but no follow through.  Supposedly, they've been doing \\"Hunger Games\\" for 74 years yet no one decided to show any resistance until NOW?!!<br /><br />If this were intended as some low-budget sci-fi B-movie, I'd give it a charitable 3-star rating, but Hollywood and the elitist arts & entertainment media cabal all went ga-ga over this -- they hyped it up as the-must-see-film of the year.  Glad I didn't pay nine bucks to see this at a theater.<br /><br />I can't understand why ANYONE would give this thing a 5-star rating; in fact, I challenge any 5-star reviewer to explain the premise behind this film!
B009EEFTMC|3.0|THIS IS A GOOD GAME TO KEEP YOUR MIND WORKING. I NEVER GET BORED PLAYING THIS GAME. I AM ALWAYS TRYING TO BEAT MY LAST RECORD.
B0064QNS62|4.0|The graphics for Marv are very crisp on my Kindle Fire.  In the description the game is described as retro.  It is similar to a Mario Brothers style adventure.  You find jewels and tools that you collect to help you defeat monsters and clear the levels.  The game is fairly intuitive and the levels get more challenging as you go up. This game is a cute little fantasy action adventure and I am looking forward to exploring all of the levels. I also thought the teleporter was cute.  You can tell that a lot of thought went into development because of the great details!<br /><br />Update<br /><br />Some of the other reviewers are mentioning slow response time on the controls.  I thought the responsiveness of the controls compared favorably to the1980's stlye game playing and thought that was the point.  If you want a game with the smooth and seamless controls more common today then this game will probably annoy you.  While playing I discovered that you could learn repetative motions that assisted you in overcoming obstacles.  This reminded me a lot of earlier generations of games when the controllers did not always do exactly what I wanted them to do but I was always able to figure out an alternative method to clear the level.<br /><br />What bothed me as I explored the game in more depth however was that it was sometimes difficult to understand what would cause your character to die.  Using fire as an example sometimes I thought Marv was standing in the fire but he lived and other times I felt he was safe but he got torched.  Speaking of torches the ones on the walls have flames but those flames do not effect Marv.  For these reasons I am removing a star from the original rating.  But I still like the game a lot and think that it is superior to most of the apps on the market today.  :)
B003M6EAXM|5.0|I never saw this series while it orginally aired. I watched the pilot and was &#34;hooked&#34;. It is very interesting and holds your interest every second. I watched this on Amazon Prime and saw all eight seasons in a two week time period. I ended up watching 192 shows and was sad when it ended. Hope there is a real &#34; Jack Bauer&#34; out there watching over us all.
006224454X|5.0|This was so different from any other mystery/suspense I've read. It's been a long time since I've read a book that I could not put down until I finished it - and now that I have, I am actually hesitant to start a new book because I'm still basking in the aterglow of this one! I hope to see more from this author soon!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|So many movie adaptations of great Broadway musicals range from very good (Chicago) to truly dreadful (Man of La Mancha). Les Miserables is destined to become the benchmark by which future movie musical adaptations are judged. The script does justice to the original Broadway production, and the performances are generally outstanding, with Russell Crowe being the sole exception. He's not horrible, just not up to the level of Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway, who are superb. Hathaway's Fantine is heartbreaking, and Jackman's Jean Valjean is extraordinary. He portrays all of the qualities of a complex man who journeys from the bitterness of a brutally treated convict to the peacefulness of a man who has found redemption. His vocal range is amazing and his acting is strong, yet wonderfully nuanced. The supporting actors are all good, and it was nice to see Colm Wilkinson (Broadway's original Valjean) as the Bishop who claims Jean's soul for God. That the actors sang live, not taped and synced, makes this movie even more remarkable. Don't miss this outstanding movie.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very well written book and keeps the reader wanting to finish all of the stories at once.  I stayed up several nights very late, it was that good!  Would make a good movie
1439107955|5.0|Kept me wanting to read more.<br />I learned much about the early history of oncology that I did not know before.<br />Recommend this book to all doctors who work with cancer patients.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I know this is a love it or hate it movie and I loved it. The storyline and message is wonderful, you never see the twists coming, and the characters are fun even if a couple can get on people's nerves also got to love the cameo's and nostaliga feel. I say watch it and form your own opinion.
B008M7JODC|5.0|Great show for my boyfriend and I to watch. I love the criminal justice part and my boyfriend loves the science aspect. Great characters dialogue and storylines. I would watch it every day if I had the time!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I loved the movie because it had some of my favorite icons in it and the story was a wonderful one. Definitely recommend it to anyone who is thinking of seeing it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. It will be fun to see who was chosen to play the characters in the book. Especially Jo.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|One of my favorite of Pixar's [almost completely good] run. I recommend this movie thoroughly, especially if the person who buys it has children.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|It came very quickly, and it was an incredible story.  I highly recommend this purchase, as you'll want to watch it over and over again.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|A great continuing season for a great series. I love all of the characters and enjoy seeing their growth and relationships.
0812973992|4.0|As someone originally from NYC, I'm shocked and a bit embarrassed that I'd never heard of the famous 1974 Philippe Petit walk between the unfinished World Trade Center towers before reading this book. The event itself, around which the action of the book indirectly revolves, fascinated me as I read, and for this I'm indebted to Colum McCann.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the story and McCann's depiction of The Big Apple during a difficult time in its history. The characters were interesting and engaging and the way in which most of them were connected, with and without regard to the Petit walk, came together very naturally and effectively.<br /><br />I would've given this book 5 stars if not for two small complaints:<br /><br />1) Two of the middle chapters, in my opinion, could've been omitted. One follows a teenage photographer as he attempts to time shots of underground graffiti while riding the subway, the other a group of west coast kids who learn of Petit's walk when they randomly call pay phones near the WTC. I think McCann included the former to further show what life was like at the time for low income NYC teens, and the latter to highlight the lack of technology at the time, the relative slowness with which information spread compared to today's world? But I think the book would've been better without these chapters, cleaner, because these characters stood alone, whereas the others were connected somehow in addition to everyone's connection with Petit's walk.<br /><br />2) Perhaps if I were reading this book for the first time in, say, 2025, I would like the part where McCann fast forwards to 2006. But reading it in 2011 like I did, I found myself wishing he'd just left all of the action in 1974.<br /><br />A final note: reading McCann's description of the Petit walk itself, I felt as if I were standing on the edge of one of the towers myself, afraid I might fall. Masterful is the word that comes to mind when I think of the way those parts are written.
B008602KQI|1.0|I know I am jaded, but this movie is awful by anyone's standards.  The rave reviews cause me to question people's motives and agenda, or limited attention span.  The largest missing piece here is any semblance whatsoever of a plot.  I spent the entire movie trying to figure out why teenagers were running around in the woods killing each other as entertainment for both the freaks with bad hair in the movie as well as the actual audience.  Something about being \\"tributes\\" and saving society at-large.  Whatever.<br /><br />This is not Tolkien, nor Fleming, nor even J. K. Rowling.  And it certainly isn't Heinlein, Serling, Sagan or Bradbury.  This is a boring, boring movie.  My advice is to skip it.
B004EWEX9Y|3.0|This product didn't do all that we thought it would.  You aren't able to view pictures on your TV from your ipod.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|After all, a songwriter.  Far too modest about his guitar skills, of which there are many examples here, Stephen Stills wrote over 20 classic songs, and they are not necessarily the ones you are thinking of.  They are here.  Disc 2 has an astounding sequence of ten songs, likely placed in the order by Mr. Nash, which runs from \\"The Treasure\\" to \\"Change Partners\\", most from the Manassas period, which are as beautiful as anything written in the era.  Manassas was overlooked, as was much Stills work in the 1970s.  Not hard to understand, as there was a creative burst during the time he was competing with.  This astounding set corrects the mistake.  An essential purchase.  Bonus includes a photo or two by Sir Paul's wife Linda, which show the young man as a heart throb too!

B009S33I68|4.0|The narrative was so detailed (read long) that I tended to overload and needed a break before resuming. In fiction, this would be a serious flaw, but this is not fiction, and perhaps the detail was necessary to properly convey the full horror of the events and the impact they had on so many lives.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Tese are really nice little sharpeners,  They are quick to edge and take no room.  I found myself purchasing 3 extra for the vehicles.  The carbon side polishes sharp blades well.  I'll take another in the future.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Adding some last bits to my SHTF bag and this was a great little (no pun intended) find.  Assuming my knives will get a bit more use if bad things happen, i wanted a light portable method of keeping them sharp.  this little gem was just the ticket.<br /><br />Got it the day after I ordered it.. already have a razor edge on my gerber and about to see how it works on a larger blade when the Cold Steel Tanto I ordered shows up tomorrow.<br /><br />See nothing about this item that I'd change.. it's simple, solid and most important,  it works.. 5/5
B004LWZWGA|4.0|good movie shipped quick.  Good seller .  This was a controversial movie due to the opening day in Colorado.  I actually liked the last Batman better, but many say this is the better.  It has a really good plot and the characters do their persons well.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|While we enjoyed the part of the movie we were able to watch, the overall experience was very disappointing. We only got to watch approximately half of the movie.  Then, the server stopped streaming.  We know its not our equipment or internet service, because it has all been upgraded to much higher speed and we have ZERO problems streaming from Netflix.  I guess we'll have to wait to watch this entire movie from another streaming service.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Great read, I hope to get the sequel soon, its been a pleasure to read this author, I highly recommend him.
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|I saw this book mentioned on a TV Show and I guess I was hoping it would be easier to get into.  I love to read inspirational books but this one didn't do it for me
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|Great read, I hope to get the sequel soon, its been a pleasure to read this author, I highly recommend him.
0810993139|5.0|My son loves this series of books, and at age 6 reads a whole book of this collection in just 2 days! These books have given me a few extra hours of peace and quiet....which is priceless in my book. This is the first book of the series, I read it before my son did, and I don't know who loves it more, him or I. Great price too, cheapest I found in stores was $10.49. These books are a treasure!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|With nothing outstanding on TV I always turn to the BBC programs.  I missed most of this on the TV so now I am watching every season on my Kindle.  Cannot wait for Season 4.<br /><br />Carolyn Rivera
0525478817|5.0|I'm a 15 year old girl who loves reading a lot and this book is one of the few books I have read that tought me a lesson. I, once again learned that I have to be thanful for what God has given to me. But that's the only lesson I learned, John Green tought me a lot of lessons in this book. But the most important one is that some infinities are bigger than others. I cannot think of any other way that anyone could have described this sentence to make it sound as beautiful as the one he has written. At the end of this book, I cried. I was full on bawling my eyes out. That's how good this book is. I promise you, unless you have a heart of stone, you will love this book.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|ending was too convenient.  I loved the book until then.  The format was very interesting.  Flash forward dialogue was very suspenseful.
159514188X|5.0|I'm a 15 year old girl and I absolutely loved this book. Not just because it was written full of rich details and had a different style than any books I have ever read before, but because it shows how people don't realize that everything they do, and say to someone else affects their whole life. Nobody these days in my age care about geniality ..In fact a lot of people just care about sex, drugs, and popularity. That is not life. That is physical sensations that you're doing to fill that empitiness in you. That's not how that space is suppose to be filled. It's suppose to be filled with love, faith and joy. Do read this book people, it might teach you a couple of lessons about life.
B00067IT4G|1.0|I bought DVD hoping to watch it but when I got it in I tried watching it and found out it's a Region 2 disc and I live in the USA which is region 1. No where in the write up of the product did I see where it says this. So buyer beware and make sure what region you live in before buying this.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Was so thrilled to see this game.  Just like the old space invaders.  Can not thank you enough for this
B0068THAGY|4.0|At first, I thought that the title referred to a bunch of superheroes. When I realized that Spielberg was involved with this movie, I decided it was worth watching. I was right.<br /><br />This is a great story, told from the perspective of some creative youngster. I got the feeling that Steven Spielberg was one of them...the eager producer of horror film that got caught up in something much bigger.<br /><br />I won't spoil that story by giving you all the details. Just enjoy the ride.
B0087EACJK|3.0|I enjoyed this first few stages of this game (but ignored the time part as the game was more fun for m without trying to hit a time goal). Unfortunately, I had trouble with the tapping; sometimes it worked and sometimes i found myself hitting the tablet hard with no result. I'll delete this game from my Nexus
B009JBZH54|5.0|Exactly as the description online you get alll 3 movies. Good quality looking box set. It was everything I expected it to be.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This game can be totally personalized.  You can play at your speed and try to improve or play at their speed and be challenged in many ways.  I really do like it!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As with the other books before this one it just pulls you in and won't let you go.  1000 pages of fast reading.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I have not enjoyed a movie this much since Despicable Me.  This movie is creative, imaginative and funny.  Sit down and watch this movie you will not be disappointed.
0553801473|5.0|Pretty heavy to tote around but couldn't wait for the long delayed paper back edition to arrive 6 months from now
0061122416|5.0|I recommend this book to any and every one.  It is an amazing book and so inspiring and enlightening.  I can read it over and over again.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|We don't subscribe to a tv service so have no other way to view this series. Superb all around and great to watch without the hassle of commercials.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the show. Creatively done with an excellent cast. I am looking forward to watching the next seasons worth of shows.
B008OOYALE|4.0|fun.cute graphics.  takes time to build up enough money.  you could easily spend money on gold if you are not patient.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Needed a calculator on my phone. This one had the most stars and it was free.  It does what I need it to do.
145210655X|5.0|This book makes me smile. I really enjoyed it and so do the kids, I already pre ordered the leah book!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great twisted thrills!! Lang is stellar and the rest of the cast is equal to her work. I love it!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|You have to summon your allies at certain times and also think whether or not you need a charm<br />Do get the game. Also may I suggest that you get minecraft and samurai vs zombies defense part two
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|This book is a typical Nicholas Sparks book.  Boy meets girl, boy has difficulty, then all is well.  Too mushy, you always know ahead of time what comes next.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|A delightful tale of Bibliophile intrigue, stumbled on mystery, 21st Century contemporary electronics and fun characters of real depth.<br />  For all of us who still are yearning for the ancient bookstore and all it used to hold this is a book that will keep you turning the pages hour after hour.  This was a 2 day read for me and the time between the reading sessions had my mind probing and guessing where the story was going to turn next.<br />  This is not a book for the weak of mind or rigid of imagination.<br />  I am already looking for more books and stories by this talented author.
B00B935SUY|5.0|This documentary was a pleasure to watch not only because of the all the nostalgia of the 60's and 70's but for all the in depth information concerning the old school recording machine and studio and all the people involved.If you are a fan of music and local history you will love this!
B003F5WOEC|5.0|best overall black keys album. I really appreciate the soul and r&b layered in the songs. Delicious. Buying the album with new is the way to go. I have seen these used without the cd for 20.00.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've seen the first movie but fell in love with the book's. It is truly something I enjoyed relaxing to. I will be reading all again very soon.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|I loved the entire Maggie Newberry Mystery series. I especially enjoyed the French aspect, it was vividly described and I could see the sights and smell the smells. I recommend not only this book, but the entire series.
B009K86D86|5.0|If you pay attention, you'll see how corrupt our government is, and the lack of concern for the American public's health. The atrocities that these corporations inflict on the livestock that we eat is criminal.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great for kids when bored.sort of like playing temple fun but more fun ! I would recommend this game to a friend.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|It's a good app that I like. It tells you the weather,you can set alarms,and  you can upgrade it.<br />Cal
B0052FYPJK|5.0|Hes the most remarkable human being with a mind with knowledge unparalleled. It is modern day poetry that is understandble with explanation for everything he explains. this is a must have book for anyone.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is an exceptional series and seeing all 3 seasons together was a treat. I'll definitely be ordering season 4 as soon as it becomes available.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I'm. OCD and I love how orgnized  it is.  best jigsaw on android for sure. :)<br /><br />  so I'm new to my kindle. but I think this 20 word minimum is kind of silly...
B00BWJARHO|1.0|Bad cinematography , too much CG animation, rewriting critical points of sub-stories and splitting a great short story (18 small chapters) into more than one movie. Horrible train-wreck.
B009K6DKTS|5.0|Plenty of challenging ideas. One of the factors that, in my opinion, makes this book really interesting is the evidence that sound knowledge derives from the mixture of different disciplines. Sound ideas very often derive from connecting the dots.<br /><br />You do not necessary need to agree with all Taleb's proposals but no doubt all of them are provocative triggering further reflections.<br /><br />In a world packed with conventional wisdom I think that we lack this sort of provocative thinkers. Thanks Nassim.
B004GYY714|4.0|..I really enjoy the vast selection of programs and stations.  Reception is also good.  I have recommended to at least 15 other persons.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|Disappointing ending, not enough development of events or characters.  Nice story, likeable characters, events just seemed to be left incomplete.
B00498YZH8|4.0|Egaging story, excellently portrayed by a cast who, across the board, were superb at making their roles credible.  Very good camera work that puts the viewer right smack into the backwoods setting of this movie.  J Lawrence reveals her knack for being thoroughly believable when placed in a role of someone on the fringe of humanity.  Enjoy!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Dr. Who has been around for 50 years & the BBC production has been a wonderful addition to the legend of the Doctor.  Season 4 is, unfortunately, the last for David Tennant.  His portrayal of the Doctor is multi-faceted, providing us with the opportunity to become addicted to his very interesting character.  The story lines in this season were well written & cast, providing interesting aliens, danger, special effects & adventure.  I have watched the entire BBC series & would not hesitate to recommend Season 4 as one of my favorites.  Don't forget to watch the David Tennant Specials following this season for the full story of this Doctor's regeneration into Season 5.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Hey, I bought two books from Amazon on the Vikings after I saw it.  Can't wait for more installments of the Vikings.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My friend told me about this app, and I didn't think much of it but I was so thrilled when I got it. It has the Bible in several different versions,plus dramatic readings to help keep you involved. Not only that but you can set up devotional plans to read everyday. I love it
B0087JTAKW|2.0|This book is a waste of time, no pun intended. While it's told nicely, there's really nothing that engaging or surprising about it. All the plot points can basically seen miles away, and the message is shoved in your face every page. This book plays out like a lifetime movie, and that sucks because the concept behind the story has potential to raise more thought provoking questions about time, but it ultimately falls short and makes you feel like an idiot for sticking through to the end.
B004W10S9G|4.0|This is a movie I like to watch every Easter.  I was delighted to find it free on Amazon Prime.  The film is a little dated, but still a good story and a classic.
B0087EACJK|5.0|That generally means fun and is one is no exception. It is a unique puzzle game, with 3 screens you can position to your best advantage. The only down side is that you can only move when one screen is available, so you have to keep switching back and forth. I think they probably did it that way on purpose.
B0049VZ222|5.0|Awesome show, I am hooked.  Can't wait for each episode to air.  All the characters are key to the show!
1878424114|5.0|I've never read anything that puts reality in such clear terms. I used to regret a lot of the decisions I made in the past, but after reading this book, I realize I am right where I want to be, perfectly positioned to achieve my intents and desires. I've always been on my way, I just didn't realize it until now, and that's half the fun, knowing you haven't made any mistakes and cannot fail.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this for my four year old son to watch with me.  Although maybe a little out of his age range, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Very clever plot and an imaginative universe were created.
B0064MGU98|5.0|It was the first I had ever paid any attention to the show. I absolutly love the cast, looking forward to Season 4
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|Falls in line with the book and theme of the movies.  Felt like I never left Middle Earth.  Love me some hobbits.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely loved reading this. Couldn't put it down! I read the whole trilogy in about 4 days. It's beautiful, tragic, intense, and it will steal your attention.
B000ICXQXI|4.0|Classic Hitcock...a must see for those who are into American cinematic horror.  This is the film that started the genre.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|If there were a six star rating I'd give it to Castle.  It's as interesting and amusing as Bones, not an easy thing to accomplish.  I hope I am writing a rave review about Castle again next year!  And the year after...
0634086782|4.0|ordered this product a few days ago, and just received it, on time and in great condition (despite a few creases and dents from shipping). I cannot comment on the content, but skimming through it i did notice how organized the material is presented. too happy with the delivery time and too excited to learn from the book that i didn't want to wait until after i read the book to leave a review. If anything arises that may leave me wishing to add or dock a star on this review, hopefully, i will get a chance to take that into consideration and revise the rating.<br /><br />Anyway have fun to all those who decide to learn from this book!<br /><br />ps. did look through it for a bit. it's a great book that lives up to its name, the \\"encyclopedia\\" of Jazz Theory. great for reference and clarification, not great for an in-depth read. nonetheless, it has a lot of great information. just too dense and quick paced, just like how an encyclopedia is supposed to be.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book so much, everyone deals with life a different way. Mental illness is just another hurdle to life. This book talks about how we all need people to help us in order to move through life and enjoy it.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|This game WAS a lot of fun but now isn't. It takes forever  to load a game (sometimes never does), the tutorial wasn't very helpful, and it locked me out of the game all of a sudden and won't let me play it again. Sucks overall, needs a lot of improvement.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A good book that I'd quality read. A book to be proud of. Thrilling and very well written about seal team 6'
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved all of these books.Especialy &#34;Catching Fire.What I didnt like was the (final) end.It was good,but I found it made little sense.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|so amazon wants to give me a free 5 gigs of storage, SURE!! I will take it and nobody will find my porn....just kidding,,,, no I wasn't ;)
B001ANSSDC|2.0|I guess I thought this book would be better due to it being made into a movie. I felt it was poorly written.
B001OKGX92|5.0|this movie was made when movies were not all about special effects  and film trickery. They were all about real life action, that could happen anywhere at anytime. all car guys should watch the old low budget car flicks of yesteryear. I feel they make us appreciate the newer films that much more. As long as there is cars and action they are all cool.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham was at his best with this mystery...and it was a mystery the way he finally tied all the characters in...for a rather surprising end.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|The book was ok. The ending was awful, was a let down to realize I had read the entire thing and it was a dull dull ending.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Recommend this book to other military wives and members of the military current and past. The language was on the vulgar side at times and did not add to the details of what was being written. An excellent account of the numerous places where the wars were/are fought that was not always in the media.
B0064QNS62|4.0|Let me begin by saying that there is a free version of this App, so you can take it for a test drive before actually buying this game.<br /><br />Keep in mind that this is a \\"retro\\" game similar to such 80's games as \\"Donkey Kong.\\"  That being said, the controls are similarly clunky and sometimes difficult to use. The frustration level can be high, so prepare to exercise some patience. If you were/are good at platform games, you will breeze through levels (maybe too easily, to the point of making this game too unchallenging).<br /><br />Yes, the game is repetitive (just like 80's platform games). The objective is simple:  Walk over all the platforms while avoiding pit falls along the way. Directions for play can be found by tapping \\"Help\\" in main menu. Everything is pretty straightforward. There are also in-game tips to guide you along.<br /><br />For me, this game is just \\"ok,\\" but then I was never too wild about these types of games in the first place.  While sometimes easy, the repetitive aspects of these types of games can be maddening.<br /><br />One thing I would like is to start where you left off if you die (rather than at the beginning of level). This would alleviate some of the repetition issues I have.<br /><br />If 80's games were your thing, then this game is for you. The nostalgia factor is high. If you are too young to remember these games, try the free version first to get a feel for the game. You might end up liking it! (Kindle Fire HD - 4 stars for nostalgic authenticity)
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I love this story.  Claire Danes' acting is superb. It helps me better understand autism and what families affected by autism go thru.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|Acting superb, sets very realistic, smooth transitions between scenes. CGI great. Overall watching season three episodes made me want to be there in the stories.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This white noise app is awesome if you are having trouble going to sleep. It is a ton of fun creating a horribly annoying harmony of mass chaos to annoy your friends also. I've already drove a dozen people crazy. All in all, a great app!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Wow where to begin,what a very inspiring story.. I cried I laughed,Will and Lake were great together,so many obstacles to overcome and through it all they fought for each other... Loved it!

B009O07NMA|5.0|This is album is amazing. I listen to it everyday. Florida Georgia Line has such talent! I suggest that you buy this album :)
B00CDT41RY|3.0|First, I am a white male from Texas. I am literally 60 miles from where J. Fox grew up (Terrell, Texas). I personally disliked the repeated use of racial explicitives; however, I assume it was par for the coarse in that era. Aside from that, it was funny and action packed. It's worth renting.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and the graphics are great. Perfect for any horse lover looking for a fun game
B00005UKKF|5.0|NOTHING LIKE LAS VEGAS WITH A LOT OF SPEARS IN IT....U GOTTA LOVE THIS POP QUEEN SINGER I DO =)

B009KEN87O|5.0|I've been playing for the past half hour.Great fun, nice variety, excellent control of the home shooter. Looking forward to playing more.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Simplicity is never outdated.  This watch does just what it is meant to do, nothing fancy or over grown on steroids to the point of looking ridicoulous.  And it is automatic.....perfect.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Love this product it brilliant all of it just make it more exciting and more harder because for my daughter it's to easy
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The first book in the Trilogy was intriguing and well-worth reading.  The remaining two were a bore and did little to further the story other than to bathe the reader in gore and an inane plot.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|A great sequel to the original. Still has in game purchasing, which I won't use, but its not obtrusive. Pigs.
B008CPRLP2|5.0|One of the best products ever created. I have used it for years on my computer and it is a necessary program.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|On the surface, this book is about overcoming what the author describes as &#34;resistance&#34;, and harnessing your creative potential. People experience resistance through procrastination, rationalization, denial, etc. Pressfield's thesis seems to be that we all experience some level of resistance, and we must first acknowledge it, then overcome it to be successful in any endeavor.<br /><br />However, the deeper meaning that I took from the book has little to do with creative energy. My interpretation of it was that we all have dreams, however big, that we're not pursuing because of our self imposed resistance. We're either to busy trying to impress the people around us, or too afraid to fail. Either way, we're doing a great disservice to ourselves, and society in general by not pursuing our dreams.<br /><br />The author lost me a little bit when he continually referred to god and angels as the source of creativity. It seems a little rude to credit a higher power with every single artistic masterpiece ever created. Surely people like Beethoven, Da Vinci, and Jimi Hendrix deserve credit for their own artistic styles and pieces of work.
B008602KQI|5.0|one of three best books i have read, with the other two being the sequels. fast read. great adventure. thought provoking
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another good book by Michael Connelly. As usual his books end but make you want more. What will happen next?
B008K8VDPU|4.0|fun game but hard to play with the keys being too small for my wide fingers. I still play it, i am just not very good at it.
B004132HZS|5.0|This modern take on Sherlock Holmes has catapulted Benedict Cumberbatch to stardom, and rightfully so. His frenetic Sherlock is perfectly balanced by Martin Freeman's John Watson. Freeman's expressive face makes it very clear what it is like to live with someone who sees everything about you in an instant as Sherlock does.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I've had this game since November and i've enjoyed it since. Love it.. my only wish is that if only i can play or check on it even when i dont have internet service..
B0043ZDFEQ|4.0|Some of these songs I didn't even realize I knew, until I was listening to them, and they had been buried in my subconscious.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|I am a So You Think You Can Dance fanatic so this movie is right up my alley. Several of the dancers are from the show as well as choreographers. I appreciate all forms of dancing and love that many are incorporated into this film. The acting isn't the greatest but I didn't care because the dancing rocked!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game, I spend hours on end playing it. Best app I ever downloaded for my kindle. It feels good being the shark for once.
B000YJ6736|1.0|The most ridiculous book.  Not only was it boring to read but the whole premise - based in 60s when people were in such a hurry to get married just so that they could have sex - was outdated.  If you are in your 60s or older, you may be able to appreciate this book a little more than I did.  But honestly, I got my money back.  That's how bad I thought it was.
B00AEFY0F2|4.0|We watched this with the family - I had forgotten about some of the sexual references and innuendo.  PG-13<br /><br />But a great movie!
B0039LAPWK|1.0|I ordered this movie through Movie Mars and was VERY DISAPPOINTED when my Blu ray player could not play it because it is a REGION B disc.<br /><br />Basically, what this means is that the movie will not play in North America. Why would they sell a Region B disc in North America? That's what I would like to know.<br /><br />I returned it and was given my money back minus shipping, but I'm still very frustrated about this because I'm a huge David Lynch fan and have yet to see the film.
B0060FXBNM|4.0|I am a big fan of this series and having them in a set, makes them easier to locate when I want to pop one in and get the popcorn ready.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|wow this app is amazing total amaze! you shoud really buy it the cool thing about it is you can see the weather all around the world like Cincinnati ohio
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I really liked the product and it came as described. It also came a lot more quickly then I thought!
B00AGKHALQ|5.0|if your a long time rammstein fan or a new one this a great DVD to own. In my opinion Rammstein has some of the best videos in metal history. They actually put a huge effort into their videos. To have all them in one collection, plus the making of them is pretty awesome. A must buy for any Rammstein fan.
0062238868|5.0|This book was Awsome. Cover to cover thrilling details of the most lethal sniper in history. Its great to read of the true American heros!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I love the characters on this show. The episodes never fail to make me laugh. I hope there are many more seasons to come.
0439023483|5.0|Its an easy read that keeps you wanting not to put it down. Enjoyed it so much,bought book 2 and 3. again great books.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I should have read this 50 years ago!  And I should have read it out loud to my 3 daughters when they were in their teens.  Yes, it's an &#34;old&#34;  book but it is ageless..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The graphics are interesting, the most humorous aspect is day dreaming. While on the train, bus or leisure their is always another person playing against you.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|a 10 it truely deserved to be in the awards show. we are glad it won the recognition it deserved.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|My husband and I were excited to see this when it came out. First 5 minutes were so crude. Not funny and it continued for the next ten minutes. There was. No need to it. We both disliked it and would not recommend it to anyone. Awful movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|great family movie. fun ny. ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Considering how complex the Flash browser version of this game is, the translation here is pretty amazing.  Leave the birds and play with monkeys.
1401322786|4.0|This was a Christmas gift.<br /><br />Heard about it on TV and gave to my BFF.....she loved it!<br /><br />It's on my table to start next.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's a challenge, but not too difficult and a fun way to pass time--and the eagle is great when stumped.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|All levels of challenges.<br />Though this is 1st time I've been REQUIRED to meet a word count QUOTA for a review.  Strange ideas the 20somethings in charge of 'Reviews' come up with.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm absolutely addicted to this show...I'm a huge zombie fan and this show has perfect parts zombie Gore and drama.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|Classic Monty Python.  Requirement for any fan.  Now I don't have to keep track of where the DVD went.  It looks great on my HD tv and I didn't need a blu ray player
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Years ago I had what I now know was a Near Death Experience.  This is an excellent book for learning about the subject at a high level.  It is also encouraging and enlightening.
B005PTYP70|5.0|The Mission:  Impossible - Extreme Trilogy is a good addition to our movie collection.  The acting and the action are all very good.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I bought this for my 11 yr old daughter. She loves it! We watch it together and we always get a laugh out of it. Good family movie. I recommend to anyone who wants to sit back with the kids and watch a &#34;classic&#34; and have a few laughs.
0061122416|5.0|I remember when a friend of mine suggested that I read this book. It has literally changed my life. The journey always leads you to find out who you are and in the end you find that your treasure was right before your eyes. Love. Love. Love my top favourite!
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|Amanda is set up for marriage by her Mother with a good  looking guy who can provide for her but she is in love with another guy (who isn't very goodlooking). The whole town is scared of a werewolf that comes around and kills people at random,...so they think. The town calls on a lunatic to come and kill the werewolf. The lunatic finds out that the wolf wants to take Amanda away with it and Amanda can talk to it so he uses her for bait. Although I like how the story all came together with her dad, I would have liked to see her actually become a wolf and have a family. Without spoiling the whole movie and telling who the wolf is I can say it was an alright movie but I did not like the ending.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I love this show, it is so well written and thought provoking, keep giving us more prime choices like this one!
B006OFN0SE|4.0|This is more like a documentary. It is a very good movie. Leonardo is a great actor. Edgar had great tactics to use on the government to keep them on their toes. People say he was sneaky, but the truth is they probably wished they had come up with those tactics first. He did his job at any cost. I don't know if it was a personal dig throwing in that he was gay, but now a days, being gay is not an insult. No matter his personal life, the guy had a great mind. This movie mixes his personal life and his professional career. I liked it and I would recommend it.
0670019933|5.0|As with On the Road, Kerouac wrote The Dharma Bums in a white heat, typing it on a roll of paper so that he wouldn't have to stop when he came to the end of a page. He called his method \\"spontaneous prose\\" - a beauteous mix of troubadour poetics, lapsed Catholicism, jazz, highways, and freight trains. Other writers, Truman Capote among them, thought that it was more stream than consciousness. \\"He is not a writer,\\" Capote opined, \\"he's a typewriter.\\"<br /><br />  For a generation of young people disaffected by the materialism of the 1950s, Kerouac's style of prose dovetailed perfectly with the rhythms of truck-stop diners, roadside vistas, and bottles of wine. His road novels were a call to adventure and thousands followed him to Denver, to New York City, to California, to Mexico and back with a sleeping bag, a change of clothes, and a few books of poetry and philosophy.<br /><br />  Although The Dharma Bums is set in the San Francisco area, most of the allusions in the novel point to Japan. In addition to the Buddhist title, there are references to R. H. Blyth's four-volume work on haiku, D. T. Suzuki, Okakura Tenshin's The Book of Tea, and the rock garden of Roanji. Never heard of these? Find out, the novel seems to be saying. No time? Buy some. Get yourself a gig with the Forest Service so that you can sit on a mountaintop and write haiku (Kerouac called his \\"Desolation Pops\\"). Or better yet, go to Japan like Japhy Ryder.<br /><br />  All of Kerouac's novels are autobiographical and most of the characters in his works are drawn from actual people. While the narrator of The Dharma Bums is one of Kerouac's many alter egos named Ray Smith, the hero of the book is Japhy Ryder, a nom de clef for the poet, translator, and environmental activist Gary Snyder. Japhy has come down from the mountains of Washington State where he worked as a lookout for the Forest Service to study Oriental languages in Berkeley. He is about to go to Kyoto to enter a Zen monastery, but before he does, there's time enough to tutor Smith (and the rest of us) about the meaning of Zen and the wonders of Japan.<br /><br />  According to Alan Watts, Kerouac got the Zen part only partly right. In an essay entitled \\"Beat Zen, Square Zen and Zen\\" that was later published as a book by City Lights in 1959, Watts wrote that there were two strands of Zen \\"schools\\" in the West, \\"Beat Zen\\" and \\"Square Zen.\\" \\"Beat Zen,\\" Watts writes, \\"is a complex phenomenon. It ranges from a use of Zen for justifying sheer caprice in art, literature, and life to a very forceful social criticism . . . such as one may find in the poetry of Ginsberg, Whalen and Snyder, and rather unevenly, in Kerouac, who is always a shade too self-conscious, too subjective, and too strident to have the flavor of Zen.\\" Kerouac, Watts continues, \\"confuses `anything goes' at the existential level with `anything goes' on the artistic and social levels.\\"<br /><br />  Watts characterizes \\"Square Zen\\" as the \\"Zen of established tradition in Japan with its clearly defined hierarchy, its rigid discipline, and its specific tests of satori. More particularly, it is the kind of Zen adopted by Westerners studying in Japan, who will before long be bringing it back home.\\"<br /><br />  What, then, is Zen? Zen is.<br /><br />  The problem for a Westerner is that two words alone are not going to be enough to explain the sublime. We need narrative and lots of it. And that is where Kerouac comes in. Kerouac wrote hundreds of thousands of words; and like a kid shooting baskets in the driveway, he missed a fair amount of the time. But he thought that if he just kept reading and writing and traveling, he would be able to distill what he'd recorded in his journals into works of literature.<br /><br />  Though the Beat Zen in The Dharma Bums may be sugarcoated, Kerouac got the narrative right. The Dharma Bums is a story of time and place, of Kerouac, Snyder, Ginsberg, Whalen, Rexroth, and McClure in San Francisco when North Beach and Berkeley and Marin County were the center of the world and Japan and the Cascade Mountains were on the horizon. And if the novel teaches us anything, it is that all you have to do to change what is in the center and what is on the horizon is to move.h and Berkeley and Marin County were the center of the world and Japan and the Cascade Mountains were on the horizon.

B009K0P10K|4.0|this series is so cheesy. The acting is sub-par and the plots are bizarre, But for some insane reason, I'm hooked.
B00BI73CVI|2.0|Depressing...plus I didn't realize that like an opera, they sing the dialogue..no, no, no! Great makeup.  Very realistic looking poor people.  Great special effects.
B00BF11STU|5.0|Kathryn Bigelow is turning out into one of the most remarkable directors of the current era. She has a knack for telling the Iraq and Afghanistan war stories better than anyone out there. Jessica Chastain just blows one off with her tremendous performance. A must see for all Americans, and even non-Americans. It is important to state to the world that if you do bad things to the United States, we'll eventually find you and justice will be delivered at the barrel of an assault weapon, looking into the eyes of a U.S. Special Forces dude as your last memory on earth.
B005K17RU0|3.0|While the new version has much more info I found the old version much easier to navigate in.  Given a choice I would stick with the old one.
1451695195|5.0|This was a fascinating book. One realizes it's not fabrication because of the<br />importance of the man who wrote it...his credentials make this an important<br />read.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|They were really grasping for lines. The only funny part was the edited clip at the end of the movie with Melissa McCarthy.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I absolutely love this book!!! I finally have an understanding of what my husband wants!!! Thank you so much for writing this book!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really like this game, however. I've had to reinstall it three times because it keeps locking up on me. when it's working it's a good, fun game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I LOVE this show!  It's unlike anything else on TV right now and I'm HOOKED!  It's very interesting, a point of view I've never seen before.
B004IPPINW|4.0|It was a very unusual story from what I'm use to. Moved quickly and was always engrossing. A new insight in to the mind of a<br />non-american
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Thought provoking and at times profound.  Excellent writing and creativity.  Extremely entertaining.  Well done with excellent acting.  Look forward to season 4.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows on tv that I have seen in a long time. I watched a couple of shows, and now I am hooked!
1594745692|5.0|These are tarot cards, not a book but they are really funny but graphic - they're zombies.
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Fantastic performances by Liza and Michael York and a stunning performance by the amazing Joel Grey! A flash back to a time that would change history forever. A great look at a difficult time that is more than war!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is the first time I've viewed tv shows using your website. I was very impressed. It was great quality and easy to use. I will use this service again in the future. Thanks you!
B0064QNS62|4.0|In Marv The Miner 2, you are tasked with... Walking on platforms! In that, the goal of each level is to walk across every piece of platforms in said level.<br /><br />There are obstacles, such as enemies, falling platforms and switch puzzles, but you're always given what you need to succeed.<br /><br />The game is well- designed, with good graphics and sound. Conceptually, it's not the most original idea, but the game has a lot of charm.<br /><br />The controls aren't great, though. They're clunky and a little slow. Its a rather easy game, though and 90% of the difficulty comes from the aforementioned poor controls, which can be frustrating at times. It loses a star for that.<br /><br />While somewhat unrewarding, this is a solid platformer and worthy of being the FAOTD.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|This was a gift for someone who requested the set and she has enjoyed it quite a lot.  I would recommend this for anyone who<br />loved the program.
B007EPESOS|4.0|Hitchens is great to read. He is such an articulate contrarian that he inspires one to read him even if one does not agree with his position. This book is an eye opener :-)
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This has been my daily keyboard since it was the 'free app of the day' over a year ago. I must say, it's come a long way. Every update seems to make this app better. I recommend this keyboard to any one who wants a Swype-like keyboard or a great prediction keyboard. :)
B0064MPXFA|5.0|If you like drama/comedy, this series is perfect for you. Although be prepared for some adult situations and some rather cruel legal concepts. Lawyers will lie, cheat and misrepresent at every step of the way. Even when the client is in the wrong, the lawyers are usually even more wrong.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I just loved it as I do most things he sings. It's been a while since he put out something new. I still like the classics the best.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I thought this movie was very interesting and well done.  It touched on a part of his presidency that I knew little about.  I do think they skipped some vital information at the end, and had I not read books on Lincoln before hand, I am unsure if the ending would have made sense to me.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me guessing and eventually you made your own conclusion.  I decided at the end that they deserved each other
B005K17RU0|3.0|I enjoyed it until the recent update. All I wanted was that warning list saying what the day would hold in store for me, such as the arthritis warning, so I know when my knees are going to fall off. Now it is just the same as every thing else.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|I downloaded the same film twice to my Kindle and jumped on a flight.  Was unable to watch it on both occasions. First time the fim wouldn't load, second time I had a message saying my time with the film had expired, but I hadn't even started seeing it.<br />On the first occasion I called Amazon to complain and received a refund, second time around I was so pissed I didn't even bother trying to get a refund.<br />If someone at Amazon decides to read this review and give me back my money, great... if not, I can live with it.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This is a wonderful read. The story line may seem predictable but the actual telling of the characters lives and daily travails will keep you reading just to see where this goes. I loved it and will read more of JoJo Moyes books in the future.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|love this story, excellent for adults strong themes for the young adult set. finished it in two days, very quick read
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|What's not to love? If you are a fan of the show this is a must have. Even if you don't watch the show you can appreciate the &#34;Soft Nashville Sound.&#34; Can't wait for Volume 2 to be available.
B00129XQ2W|5.0|i love Beethoven symphony No 9 and this edition is the best~~~In my opinion, it is really worth to collect~
0545101425|5.0|I love when a series has a great flow and movement in the smaller stories leading up to the major storyline.  Get the other two audio cds for book 1 and 2 and have a wonderful drive to and from work each day.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you liked Fifty Shades series, you'll love this! Similar writing style but different enough story line. It completely pulls you in, and you can't put it down!
0545101417|5.0|i listened to this while going back and forth to work.  It is a great second novel and having it audio means that I do not have to flip radio channels finding the next song i like during the entire drive.
B0036UW09U|3.0|This remake of the story of two singers who paths cross as one is becoming a star and the other is on the downfall is an adequate depiction.  After all,who sings as well as Streisand in her gorgeous funky clothes?  And, who plays gravel-voiced bad boy rock star better than Kristofferson?  The emotional appeal seemed less than earlier versions for those who have seen more than this one, but will satisfy those new to the story.
B007VUCAVO|3.0|Does not save much, if any at all, on your battery life as I had expected  I would not waste my money on it!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love this series!  So pleased this is included in Amazon Prime.  It is service like this that makes Amazon Prime such a good value.
B00BF123WG|4.0|A little too graphic in the beginning but sure caught my interest mid way when the link to UBL was found
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is fun and well worth your time.  I recommend it to anyone that likes the game. A lot of fun.
1616550414|4.0|It is a must-have for Zelda fanatics! I liked how they tell about the characters and story settings. Buy it!
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|Robert Mason brought a part of my Vietnam experience back to me while I was reading &#34;Chickenhawk.&#34; Although I was not a pilot the author reminded me of what is was like to be riding in the back of the helicopter preparing for CA (combat assault). The thrill, the excitement, the exhilaration the dread and the fear are all captured  magnificently by Mason. He relates his story about the daily life of helicopter pilots during the Vietnam conflict with passion and emotion. He has style that enables the reader to almost see and feel what his words are relating. &#34;Chickenhawk&#34; is a book that is hard to put down.
0756655307|5.0|This book provided me with full insight into the awesome Marvel heroes and villains. I am glad I bought it!
0062238868|5.0|I am enjoying this book it the kind I like but maybe not for everyone I will admit to that.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|If you have never heard this compilation, all I can say is I'm sorry, and it's past time to rectify that. This is one of the primo musical works of the progressive rock era; sophisticated, complex, intriguing, musically beautiful and deep. Anyone who even pretends to have an actual interest in music has to consume this album... Pink Floyd punched a hole through the stratosphere with this work. It's not normal, not typical, not usual, not mundane. It's everything you would want to discover. Listen on decent musical equipment, turn off your phone, lock the door and put a note on it (&#34;Plague... Go Away&#34;), tell anyone who is in the house with you you'll bean them if they talk or otherwise interfere (they should be listening anyway), because this is one musical experience you shouldn't allow interruptions or distractions to sully. Highly recommended? Are you KIDDING? Not enough stars up there to even TRY and tell you.
0307951529|5.0|The book is very familiar.  I believe timing was right for me to read this.  I'm in the process of launching my own business and this book was invaluable.  If you are looking to start a company online or off, read this book.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Really fun fantasy, extremely high production values, good acting, fascinating characters and a plot of devious delightfulness that comes at you from several directions at once. Generally speaking, I despise television; this is that very rare exception. Well worth the time.
B000FA675C|2.0|I began reading this because it was free and a friend suggested it.  I will not finish the book because details that could make the story interesting are written on a very basic level.  Most of the twists in the story are easy to predict, while obvious details that should present a problem are overlooked.  For example:  Langdon and Neveu commandeer an armored truck and drive it to a friend's house.  Neither of them considered that there might be a homing device on the truck.  Another example:  Neveu tells Langdon he must call the U.S. Embassy for a message.  A police investigator, Fache, allows Langdon to use his phone.  Neveu, a police officer herself, never even considers that Fache now has a record of the number Langdon called.  Neveu set up the message to avoid telling Langdon he is in danger while they were in Fache's presence.  How did this book ever get to be so popular and how did Dan Brown come to be considered a respected author?
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Like the rest of the known world, I watched the first season of &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; when it premiered a few years back.  It was pretty good, not great, and at the time I was not familiar with the comics at all (excuse me, I mean  &#34;graphic novels!&#34;).  I missed the entire second season due to the conflict between DISH network and AMC when AMC was dropped. I caught up on the second season on Netflix when it started streaming it (sorry Amazon).  I really liked the second season.  I understand the criticism about staying on the farm for so long, but the characters were developed there (you know, they actually spoke to each other).  When I watched season 3, it made me realized how good some of the characters they've killed off were (especially Shane, who actually behaved like most people would during a zombie breakout. . .slightly unhinged and overly protective and suspicious. . .I can see Carl developing a lot of Shane's attitudes about trusting people and his 'kill or be killed mentality')  I could also see Hershel's behavior thinking he could rehabilitate the zombies reflecting what some people would actually think today (Zombies need rights, too!)<br /><br />I started reading the graphic novels during the season 3 break.  The Governor in the novel was a little too over the top, but that's what made him awesome.  I was surprised how briefly they (1) stayed at the farm in the novel and (2) how quickly the conflict between Woodbury and the prison was settled (what happens in two issues of the comic stretches out for an entire season on television).  I suppose they are worried they will catch up and pass the comic if they stick to the comic's timeline).  Needless to say, there are lot of head-scratching decisions going on in season 3 (which is puzzling because they have such strong source material to draw from).  Herschel is virtually non-existent in the second half of season 3, bringing Merle back was a distraction at best, and having Tyrese go to Woodbury(which completely contradicts his character from the novels) doesn't make a lot of sense either.  It's kind of funny that Rick is always thinking about the &#34;group&#34; and when he summons everyone together for a meeting you've got maybe 5 people there.<br /><br />The Governor was never fully developed and a lot has been said about his assault on the prison and his retreat, so I will not elaborate on it here.  AMC needs to pony up the cash to get these guys out of the prison and on the road.  The way they left it in the show, the Governor is gone, Woodbury not a threat, and they could virtually stay in the prison forever.  They have basically said the threat is no longer from the Walkers (as they casually stroll around and hack and slash about twenty at a time) but other people.  This is the arc the comic has been taking in the later volumes, and I think it's a good way for the show to go.  Otherwise the prison is going to be lot like Hershel's farm only minus interesting characters.<br /><br />BTW, most of the characters are Georgia natives.  Why did they not know a prison was there?  I think most people in most states generally know where their bigger prisons are (not little county jails, but actual prisons with walls and fences and towers).  It took them all winter to find it?  And why do the people in Woodbury not know it is there? (when they are virtually walking to it and back almost every show).<br /><br />Just some thoughts.  I would give the first half of the season four stars, and the second half three.  So, average out to three and a half (not bad, but could be better).<br /><br />We need more Morgan!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Yes, this game makes me angry.  Altough I found it fun at first, it got more challenging and to the point where I felt like it was totally impossible to progress any farther.  A bit frustrating.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|I loved this as a kid - thought it was fun. Got this for my kids. They loved it. I am totally reliving my childhood.
0385338910|4.0|A great novel.  Well written with great character development.  A wonderful story that combines sadness, humor and the human condition.  Classic Jonathon Tropper. Read it now!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book was my first introduction to Doris Kearns Goodwin, not having read any of her work before, and I am impressed with her writing.  She really gives a good profile of each subject, the living conditions at the time and what life was like.  It's amusing to see how similar the political maneuverings were at the time to those we read about in present day - the only difference is they weren't as vicious and self-serving then as they are now.  My reading opportunity is only in the evening and &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; is one book that I look forward to at the end of my day.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Decent YA type romance.  The character development is ok, but the plot has some unbelievable elements.  THis one was just OK for me.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|An excellent story. So much reality in teenagers and parental ideas. A love story and yet so tragic.  I kept trying to guess the<br />ending. Couldn't put it down.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like this weather app.! I get so much information at my fingertips without having to do much &#34;searching&#34;. Once I open the application I am presented with an easily understandable overall view of what is happening weather-wise. It is easy to read, understand, and access.
B000TRZ28E|5.0|While no R.E.M. album will compare to Reckoning ever, in my humble opinion anyway, Document is probably my second favorite.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|This copy of the original is as good as I can remember it to be. It would be nice if it were on a larger screen  ;)
B005IT0V8O|5.0|This belongs on every writer's bookshelf, electronic or otherwise.  Read it through to make writing more concise and elegant. Imagine what it could do for Tweets!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Great movie to watch. One of those \\"Castaway/I Am Legend\\" type solo movies. He pulls it off. Would wAtch again and again.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great shows.  Im a big fan,  And the story keeps getting better.<br /><br />It's great owning the show to watch when your ready. and to re watch when you need a supernatural fix.
B00BI745AA|4.0|Never liked musicals while growing up (except for Sound of Music & Fiddler on the Roof) but this one was well worth watching.  My significant other is Korean so it help to use subtitles since occasionally the English accents were a little thick and even I had a hard time understanding some characters.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Brilliant and tasteful. Unpredictable. Action packed, thrilling and sad. There are stories of leadership, ethics, relationships and survival. My favorite show of all time.
B00007LTIA|2.0|No issue with music<br />Problem was with the CD.<br />Bad copy would play in any of my home or car equipment.<br />Seller to return w no problem. Just disappointed.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|This is one of those games that you can't put down until your thumbs hurt.  It reminds me a lot of the old arcade game Time Pilot, enhanced with some physics (stalling, acceleration when diving, etc).  Overall, it's a great game, but I only gave it 4 stars due to the limited re-playability (you can redo levels with new planes, but no new challenges).
B0049J2BSM|5.0|I thought this was a sweet movie. I loved the characters and the voices behind them, were so matched. The idea behind this is so genius, and the end, was truly a happy end. It kept my attention while my two year old played ! i would recommend to adults and kids- Maybe not 2 year olds, mine didn't particularly care for it, but im sure at some point he will, when we have the nothing is in your closet talk for the fortieth time.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love them all. I have all five of the games. i have them all in the HD version. I hope they come out with an HD version of Angry Birds Seasons
B007LB2B3K|5.0|Volbeat is rare to disappoint.  Great vocals, great sounds.  Definitely worth the purchase and I look forward to future albums
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love all the Angry Birds games. i have all of them in HD on my kindle Fire HD. My grandson loves them too.
