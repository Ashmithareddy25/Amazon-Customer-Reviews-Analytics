B000BNI90O|5.0|my wife is a big fan of the movie. this music is right from the movie. It is not music inspired from the movie like some of those disapointing cd i have atained in the past. it's right from the movie so if you watch the movie you have heard the music before. I don't like the wall art that media player wants you to look at as the music plays but in a cd player it sounds great. It is exactly what you would expect.
0967175429|5.0|I had previously purchased Vianna's book \\"Go Up & Seek God\\".  I had difficulty with the technique because visualization doesn't come easy for me - I am more of a \\"feeler\\".  Plus, the word \\"God\\" was a barrier for me.  However, I loved the possibilities of the technique enough to purchase this book.  In this book, she seems to have expanded her concept of the source of creation and healing which is very appealing to me.  I also appreciated her emphasis on self-help.  She doesn't seem to have any of that 'guru' mentality.  To me, the most important feature of her growth and expanded vision is her use of muscle testing to discover weird beliefs that are stuck in your energy field!  That alone was worth the price of the book.  I even bought a copy for a friend.  There are many other ideas she explores in a very 'non-creepy' way such as mysterious implants, spirits, indigo children, etc.  This book and the book \\"The Parallel Universe of Self\\" will change how you view life and its possibilities.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|Checking out this album on Amazon, I noticed that the online-retailer mega-giant recommended that this debut went \\"better together\\" with the latest My Morning Jacket release. I couldn't say it came as a surprise; critics everywhere have been bandying about Fleet Foxes as the latest MMJ southern-fried rock outfit, and the Internet hype machine long ago praised them as the next big thing.<br /><br />After one listen to Fleet Foxes, it's hard not to make the obvious connections between this five-piece from Seattle and that five-piece from Kentucky that has distinguished itself from the rest of indie rock with its focus on Americana and country-rock. Hell, Fleet Foxes' singer, Robin Pecknold, sounds so eerily like My Morning Jacket's Jim James that I was hard-pressed to believe this wasn't a MMJ side-project at first listen. Pecknold even has the carefully unwashed, longhaired mane down pat.<br /><br />Despite the initial similarities, however, Fleet Foxes does manage to move out from the looming shadow of their more famous indie rock brethren, shying away from the experimentalism that has defined MMJ for the past few years and focusing more on the folksy, Appalachian rock of the It Still Moves era.<br /><br />Fleet Foxes takes more from the backcountry, lumberjacking side of their home state than the more modern, grunge-inflected era. Their songs sound like they should be piping lazily out the door of some lonely cottage high in the mountains rather than the windows of some hipster's Prius. \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\" wanders along on a gentle acoustic guitar line and Pecknold's powerful voice singing about \\"where the birds wait / and the tall grasses wave.\\" This is pure American-bred rock `n roll at its finest, calling to mind not just bands like My Morning Jacket and Wilco but also old standard-bearers like Woody Guthrie.<br /><br />The music is appropriately pastoral and driving at different times, ranging from \\"Sun It Rises\\" dreamy harmonizing and plucked guitar to the rollicking drums and triumphant chorus on \\"Ragged Wood.\\" Pecknold is clearly the star here, his confident voice anchoring each song with presence and the ability to teleport the listener straight into the wild settings of the band's tunes.<br /><br />Perhaps the best aspect of the album is Fleet Foxes' unerring ability to craft incredibly resilient, catchy melodies one after the other. This isn't a country-rock band that lets it all out in a raging storm of guitar heroics; instrumental breaks in general are kept to a minimum. Fleet Foxes know how to craft a tune. The harmonizing between the piano and Pecknold on \\"He Doesn't Know Why,\\" the `60s sing-a-along of \\"White Winter Hymnal,\\" nearly every song has a melody that is immediately pleasing to the ear.<br /><br />If there's anything to be held against this album, it's the unfortunate tendency for the album to blend together near the halfway mark. Pecknold may have a distinctive voice, but he sounds pretty much the same on every song. Lyrically the album is fairly vanilla, sticking to simple tried-and-true themes like love, the beauty of the country life, and solitude. While the music is unfailingly strong, the lack of any major stylistic differences between any two songs makes some confusion as to which is which unavoidable.<br /><br />For a debut by a band that was practically unknown a year ago, however, Fleet Foxes is a fantastic piece of work. Fleet Foxes has the potential to be one of America's great musical poets, and their first release should firmly cement their place as not just another My Morning Jacket clone.iumphant chorus on \\"Ragged Wood.\\" Pecknold is clearly the star here, his confident voice anchoring each song with presence and the ability to teleport the listener straight into the wild settings of the band's tunes.

You relate what you are trying to remember to something in the real world or between objects if you are trying to memorize a list. Helpful, yes, but I felt as though some chapters could have been much shorter or thrown out altogether with this concept running throughout the first 90 pages.
B000BVQ9JO|3.0|First Impressions of Earth is the sound of a band trying to grow. After the Strokes 2003 release Room on Fire was critically slammed for simply retreading the ground covered by their debut album, the band spent two years focusing on making a record that would sound, well, different. Whether this was necessary or not is debatable; Room on Fire was a perfectly fine sophomore effort by a band that was overly hyped to begin with, and if you're dating Drew Barrymore and being hailed as messiahs of Rock, why change?<br /><br />The Strokes' attempt to throw some new musical tricks into their tried-and-true style garners them mixed results. Some songs on First Impressions of Earth sound genuinely fresh and interesting, while one can hear in others the almost palpable strain of a band forcing itself to grow.<br /><br />When you first start up the disc, the most noticeable difference from previous Strokes offerings is the vocal mix; singer Julian Casablancas' lyrics are actually intelligible, and his voice is surprisingly audible above the standard-Strokes droning bass and sharp guitars.<br /><br />The album starts up with promise; opener \\"You Only Live Once\\" is vintage Strokes, with a dance-able beat and urgent, staccato guitar bursts framing Casablanca's narrative. The next song, single \\"Juicebox\\" revolves around a ridiculous James Bond-esque bass line and sounds unlike anything else on the album. Why they chose this for airplay is beyond me, as it is possibly the most divisive song on the record.<br /><br />The next two songs \\"Heart In A Cage\\" and \\"Razorblade\\" are excellent tunes, benefiting from Casablanca's clearer singing and the melodic guitar playing. On the latter song Casablancas sings \\"Oh no, my feelings are more important than yours / oh, drop dead, I don't care, I won't worry / let it go.\\"<br /><br />This self-centered musing encapsulates the main lyrical theme of First Impressions of Earth; Casablancas is world-weary and incredibly cynical. His one-dimensional lyrics can sometimes become grating, as on \\"On The Other Side,\\" where he whines \\"I hate them all, I hate them all / I hate myself / for hating them.\\"<br /><br />This album is ambitious, to be sure; its nearly twice as long as Is This It and Room on Fire, and the musical chances the band takes far outstrip the simple yet effective formula of those two releases. Songs like \\"Electricityscape,\\" with its cascades of drum rolls and funky guitar lines show the Strokes growing up and trying out some new ideas.<br /><br />But, as with all ambitious musical projects, there are some failures. On \\"Evening Sun,\\" they take a stab at a slow (for them, at least) song, with a jittery cymbal rhythm anchoring the song. Here, Casablanca's voice is actually a detriment to the song; his voice is not particularly great, and when he shifts into screaming mode, its positively painful without an interesting beat to mask it.<br /><br />\\"Ask Me Anything\\" is the most obvious sign of the Strokes trying to do something new, and not a good one. The song uses a single instrument, an increasingly annoying synthesizer, and has Casablancas singing \\"I've got nothing to say.\\" Indeed. It almost screams, \\"Look! We can do a slow, arty song too!\\" Unfortunately, it's just boring.<br /><br />Ironically, the best song on the album, closer \\"Red Light,\\" most resembles tracks off the previous Strokes albums. Overall, First Impressions of Earth is neither an unequivocal success nor a complete failure. It offers a definite new sound, a refreshing change from their previous albums, but some missteps along the way as the band tries desperately to please its critics. Songs like \\"You Only Live Once\\" prove that the Strokes can still be original and relevant without compromising their unique sound. Hopefully their next album will be more of the good kind of growth, instead of sounding forced and self-conscious.as on \\"On The Other Side,\\" where he whines \\"I hate them all, I hate them all / I hate myself / for hating them.\\"    This album is ambitious, to be sure; its nearly twice as long as Is This It and Room on Fire, and the musical chances the band takes far outstrip the simple yet effective formula of those two releases.

B000WCBMA8|4.0|Remember mainstream rock radio in 2001? Bands that were about as groundbreaking as a Nickelodeon cartoon held the top positions, such artistic visionaries as Creed, Puddle of Mudd, Lifehouse, and the last gasp of nu-metal, Linkin' Park.<br /><br />Then something strange happened. Something fresh started popping up on the radio, heralded by a number of plural-noun bands such as the Strokes and the White Stripes, something the music press dubbed the \\"garage-rock revival.\\"<br /><br />At the forefront of this new rock was Sweden's The Hives, bursting out of the frozen north in matching black-and-white suits and ties and ridiculous stage names. Singer \\"Howlin'\\" Pelle Almqvist made the band's live shows legendary with his crowd-surfing antics, and the band's breakthrough, Your New Favourite Band, gave them major-label backing.<br /><br />Two albums later and six years later, The Hives return to the States with The Black and White Album, a record that maintains the raucous punk spirit of their earlier albums while showing a novel musical direction that saves the album from repeating the trends of its predecessors.<br /><br />Opener and first single \\"Tick Tick Boom\\" opens with a distinctive pulsating guitar line and Almqvist's trademark yell, a typical Hives song opening up what at first seems to be a typical Hives album. Complete with back-and-forth backup shouts and a fist-pumping chorus, the track is intensely enjoyable, but it is nothing a Hives fan wouldn't expect.<br /><br />The album starts to veer off into uncharted territory around the Pharrell Williams-produced \\"Well Allright!,\\" a bouncy, swing-flavored rave-up that manages to sound fresh without completely redefining the band's sound.<br /><br />\\"A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors\\" is perhaps the oddest addition to the Hives discography, an instrumental interlude halfway through the album solely featuring a drum machine and what sounds like a B-horror movie `50s soundtrack. Although initially interesting, it fails to evolve much beyond a creepy melody.<br /><br />The album ends with the one-two punch of \\"Puppet On A String\\" and \\"Bigger Hole To Fill,\\" both typing up the record's creative loose ends. \\"Puppet On A String,\\" currently being featured on the Cartoon Network, utilizes only piano and handclaps and Almqvist's nonsensical lyrics (\\"got your education from just hanging around / you got your brain from a hole in the ground\\") to solidify the Hives' acceptance of experimentation.<br /><br />\\"Bigger Hole to Fill\\" ends the collection on a triumphant note, producing yet another catchy chorus anchored by a jagged guitar line and a simple rock beat and serving to assure the listener that the Hives won't be abandoning their trademark sound anytime soon.<br /><br />While The Black and White Album proves that sometimes some adventurous tinkering produces some intriguing new possibilities, it also affirms that if it isn't broken, it doesn't have to be fixed.The album ends with the one-two punch of \\"Puppet On A String\\" and \\"Bigger Hole To Fill,\\" both typing up the record's creative loose ends. \\"Puppet On A String,\\" currently being featured on the Cartoon Network, utilizes only piano and handclaps and Almqvist's nonsensical lyrics (\\"got your education from just hanging around / you got your brain from a hole in the ground\\") to solidify the Hives' acceptance of experimentation.     \\"Bigger Hole to Fill\\" ends the collection on a triumphant note, producing yet another catchy chorus anchored by a jagged guitar line and a simple rock beat and serving to assure the listener that the Hives won't be abandoning their trademark sound anytime soon.

B000Q67DEO|4.0|For all their CBGB punk and new wave credentials and their embracing of all contemporary New York culture, be it art or disco, on record Blondie were a surprisingly commercial enterprise, thanks in part to the production of Mike Chapman, and their love of sixties pop (Ellie Greenwich is a guest singer on the album).<br /><br />Eat To The Beat was their fourth album and yielded four hit singles: Dreaming, Union City Blue (in the UK), The Hardest Part (in the US) and Atomic. Another three (Sound-A-Sleep, Living In The Real World, Die Young Stay Pretty) were B-sides. Atomic reached number one in the UK, and Dreaming was number two. Eat To The Beat was also a number one album (Top Twenty in the US), and additionally featured great songs like Accidents Will Happen and the title track, so that it almost plays like a Greatest Hits album.<br /><br />The upbeat, inspired playing of the band and the warmth and character of Deborah Harry's voice keep these songs as fresh today as when they were baked.<br /><br />Innovatively, Blondie also prepared videos for each of the twelve songs and released the album in various video formats including VHS and Betamax. Long deleted, it is now a joy to find them included in superior DVD format on the accompanying disc in this package. How would anyone not want these?

It's mindless fun, and it's got alot of really good songs on it.

This album is a must, I love every song!!
0618918248|4.0|This book, written mostly for agnostics, easily achieved bestseller status stemming from Dawkins's great initial success with \\"The Selfish Gene\\" and his subsequent anointment as the leading intellectual in Great Britain. It is one of the many popular books on atheism now appearing as stalking horses for the coming intellectual revolution outlined more fully in \\"The Scientific Worldview\\" ([...] He reiterates, in a generally personable way, all the arguments for and against god. He goes on to calculate that there is a 99% chance that there is no god, but like most systems philosophers, doesn't blink in the face of claims that the universe exploded out of nothing.<br />Unfortunately, Dawkins misses the boat entirely in claiming that religion is a secondary, coincidental, vestigial by-product of evolution. In my opinion, its ubiquity and close association with political organization and warfare makes religion one of the most important products of evolution. Besides having an albeit bogus answer for our existence, its primary purpose is to instill and enforce loyalty. This is why logic is secondary in the minds of theists. Absurdities within a religion are accepted as a matter of course through religious \\"education\\" of the most gullible members of society. The religions of other tribes are considered even more absurd. One takes a big chance leaving the safety of the tribe in an attempt to join some other tribe that may not be accepting of outsiders and their strange beliefs. To belong to no tribe at all verges on suicide. Often, it seems that the more absurd the belief, the stronger the loyalty. Loyalty obviously is necessary for defense against other groups that may forcefully attempt to take scarce resources for themselves. Thus, warfare, religion, and nationalism go hand-in-hand. Globalization at first intensifies the contacts that initially produce economic competition and war, with cooperation and peace eventually being the long-awaited result.

B000MZHW40|4.0|This film is part-story and part-sermon, and the sermon is better than the story. Some parts are exclusively sermon such as the screen messages at the beginning and the end or the moralistic pontifications of the committee that deliberates on the diamond trade. In terms of length, most of the film consists of the story of a young soldier of fortune turned diamond smuggler, but the basic moral has been enunciated so clearly at the start that nothing in the tale of Danny Solomon and Maddy can be understood as independent of it, and that is all to the good.<br /><br />Far and away the best things are the horrific sequences of civil war in Sierra Leone, and I have not yet seen a TV documentary on this topic that equals them for sheer impact. The scene where the captives' hands are lopped off spares us the ultimate in realism thank goodness, but nobody is likely to have forgotten it even two hours later when we are told that this barbarity was first introduced into Africa by King Leopold's colonial regime in the Belgian Congo. The sequences featuring the abduction and drilling of the boy revolutionaries have a chilling quality to them that probably comes mainly from a sense that this is how it happened in reality, and I wonder what it was that makes the acting so good in these ghastly vignettes, on the part of the youngsters as well as of the adults. Having encountered nothing that equals this film as a visual reconstruction of the civil war in Sierra Leone my mind reverted to the brief but indelible account of the matter given by Col Tim Collins in his memoir Rules of Engagement. This is of course a factual record, and what sticks in the reader's memory is the surrealistic irrationality of it all, with the insurgents drunk or stoned. In the film the revolutionary commander is at least rational, so for all the power of the enactment it seems that we are again being spared the ultimate worst.<br /><br />According to the film, the war is about the wealth from diamonds, one rider on the general theorem that wars in Africa are about the ownership of the national resources of each locality. The `blood' theme is symbolised by the pink colour of the giant diamond at the centre of the story, and also by the pale blood of the goat into whose back some smuggled diamonds have been sewn in an early incident, but of course this is only an artistic embellishment to the literal scenes of blood. An action-story is stitched on to the basic backdrop, and in some ways it is a good one. Where the film seems a bit uncertain of itself is to what extent this is a `straight' action yarn and to what extent a parable.<br /><br />The early episodes featuring Di Caprio and the other principals are not good at all. They are rather old-fashioned 50's-style stuff, very `acted' with stilted one-liners. Di Caprio does his best with encounters in which he sees off a crazed revolutionary and later some border guards with some dreary tough-guy posturing, seemingly able to command any situation by sheer personal presence and interminable repetitions of `huh?' Bogey might have carried it off, but not Di Caprio, and we could at least have done with some memorable phrases, of which I heard none. Things improve gradually, and although the dialogue between Leonardo and Jennifer Connelly is very average it at least makes a bit of a human being, as opposed to a B-movie stiff, out of Danny. The sermon element actually helps, with both of them recounting the grisly experiences of their parents in their respective previous conflicts. The actor who brings the story aspect of the film to life is neither of these but Djimon Hounsou as Solomon, and progressively Di Caprio seems to catch acting off him. In the end I carried away the feeling that Di Caprio represented the story element and Hounsou the `moral' element, the paradox of this being that Hounsou was far more dramatic and convincing. Indeed, in a film whose strength lies basically in its documentary and realistic dimension,the most devastating shot, for me, was of Solomon's bestial roar of rage as he deals out death with his shovel.<br /><br />The ending is a bit of a tear-jerker, but in fact I did not mind that since the film as a whole is a slightly uneasy mixture of different elements - it might as well end this way as any other way. Danny's fate left my eyes dry, Solomon ends up as the hero and rightly so. It all comes back to the diamond trade and the human beings (for want of a better expression) who operate it. One touch that I welcomed near the end was the brief cameo part for Michael Sheen doing his Tony Blair voice as a diamond dealer, and I wonder which film came first, this one or The Queen. The world of the diamond merchants does not interact much with the hell that their trade creates in Africa. Sierra Leone was at `peace' the last I heard, but we know better by now than to rely on that for long. There are currently storms on the world financial scene, and when those occur the best place to find stability is in, say, gold, or, indeed, diamonds.shot, for me, was of Solomon's bestial roar of rage as he deals out death with his shovel.

But maybe, just maybe, it won't be so bad in this one...maybe I'll understand it this time...maybe I won't be so annoyed thinking \\"you knew it was going to happen and there you go reading anyway!\\"  All I know is I want to go out like Enzo, and in a way, I was cheering him on.<br /><br />I don't know how fast I read this book, but it's one of those books I FLEW through--could not put it down.  I laughed out loud, got angry, laughed some more, weepy, more angry, and ecstatic as I ventured thru the book...the dog's narration is fantastic!  Garth Stein has Enzo, human interactions (good and bad), and Formula 1 racing so perfectly braided...it all seems so current and relevant, almost looking into the lives of people you know.  It's a beautiful, wonderful, amazing story--I can't wait to read it again.  If you asked my 'inner dog' what it thought of the book, I'd bark twice!

Yes, Nostradamus is decidedly different from almost anything they have done in the past, but they did just as great a job on this as they have on the greatest of their classic albums. It is a masterful accomplishment of an original metal god. Nostradamus needs to be listened to with an OPEN mind, not an expectation of the same ol', same ol'.
0061122416|5.0|I love this guy Coelho. He does an incredible job of making complicated concepts of spirituality and mysticism more understandable. Or at least makes you think about these deeper. There is a lot of symbolism and philosophy in this book. One subject that is hidden in the text is the (reference to) the Sufi concept of ONENESS of BEING or \\"Wahdat-ul-Wujood\\". Some sort of Pantheistic view you can say. One can read poet Rumi to see the same tale written 700 years ago. Another subject that is very well given to the reader is a sense of interfaith/intercultural dialog, that we are all going to live on the same planet and we better learn how to treat each other well... But you have to explore the book for yourself. And make sure your spirit is that of Santiago, the shepherd boy, who can be like the winds!

B001EOOQEM|5.0|Black Sabbath's ninth album Heaven and Hell was released in April of 1980.<br />After the failure of 1978's Never Say Die and being upstaged by Van Halen on its accompanying tour, Black Sabbath made some major changes.<br />First, legendary metal singer Ozzy Osbourne was fired from the band and Ozzy would start a solo career, but what would bass player Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward and guitarist Tony Iommi do to replace Ozzy. Simple. Hire (the late) Ronnie James Dio, whom was previously the lead singer for the blues rock outfit Elf and former Deep Purple member Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow (recording the classic Rainbow Rising).<br />Second, the band got a new producer out of Martin Birch (famous for work with Deep Purple, Rainbow and subsequently Iron Maiden). Would Black Sabbath succeed without Ozzy? Read on and find out (as I did in October of 1993 when I first heard the album and got subsequently on CD that November).<br />The killer hard rocker \\"Neon Knights\\" opens the album and shows Dio was more than a capable singer to replace Ozzy. Next is \\"Children Of The Sea\\" which starts out as an acoustic ballad-type song before we rock out in a slower tempo. Next is \\"Lady Evil\\" which is an awesome song despite the fact musically in some parts it was reminiscent to Cliff Richard's 1976 hit \\"Devil Woman\\" (namely in the riff that follows the middle guitar solo). The album's first side ends with the strongest track on the album which is Heaven and Hell's title track. Tony Iommi is metal's greatest guitar god, and he's demonstrated it tons of times both before and after the release of this album, but this shows why he is known as one of metal's greatest . The opening solo to this track is the best damn guitar playing he has EVER done. Combine that with some priceless vocals from Dio, and you know very well you've got a masterpiece on your hands.<br />The album's second half starts with the rocking \\"Wishing Well\\". We follow with another classic \\"Die Young\\". The track starts off with a great Geoff Nicholls synthesizer fanfare with killer Iommi guitar solos intro before going into a great fast rocker. Dio's lyrics are amazing and among the best lyrics of all time. Dio and Iommi were on fire on this track. The rocker \\"Walk Away\\" is next and is a great song with a killer riff. We close the album with the classic \\"Lonely Is the Word\\". The song has a superb vocal delivery from Dio and Iommi's guitar solos (especially at the end) are AMAZING!<br />Heaven and Hell is a SUPERB SABBATH album and was also the album that brought them back to the American Top 30 for the first time in FIVE YEARS and also rewarded Sabbath with its first US million selling album.<br />Heaven and Hell is a masterpiece and 30 years later, it still rocks! Especially the 2008 remaster released by Rhino.<br />Recommended!eat Geoff Nicholls synthesizer fanfare with killer Iommi guitar solos intro before going into a great fast rocker.

0061537934|5.0|is my best description for Garth Stein's newest novel.  Enzo is a beautiful, insightful, cunning and caring creature/man. Being a dog lover, and having just lost mine of 14 years, this canine-narrated story of hope and love and triumph and was written with nothing short of integrity. The humorous writing provided a light hearted thread throughout the book.  It's an easy and delightful read....get it!!!
B000002LUB|5.0|Black Sabbath's 17th album Dehumanizer was released in June of 1992.<br />The album saw lone original member guitarist Tony Iommi reunite with co-founder and bass player Geezer Butler (who last played with Sabbath on 1983's Born Again album and subsequent tour then left) plus the return of the legendary lead singer from 1979-82 Ronnie James Dio (who left during the mixing sessions of 1982's Live Evil for a successful solo career) and Mob Rules-era drummer Vinny Appice (who came in at the last minute after Cozy Powell got injured in a horseback riding accident).<br />With the 1981/82 lineup intact, Sabbath went into Rockfield Studios in Wales with legendary rock producer Mack (famous for his work with ELO/Queen/Billy Squier) to create their best and heaviest album since Born Again as I found out when I first heard this disc in December of 1992 at the behest of my best friend Dennis.<br />We begin with the killer \\"Computer God\\" which is a scary and amazing opening! Iommi and Butler's riff and breathtaking vocals from Dio and killer drumming from Appice dominates. This rocker is slow and brooding  and have switching tempos for track, expecially the finale which included two blazing Iommi solos which are some of his best ever. \\"After All (The Dead)\\" is next and has a haunting intro which leads into a heavy riff and classic vocals from Dio. Next is the great fast diatribe on televangelists called \\"TV Crimes\\" which has some of Dio's best vocals on the album and great riffs from Butler and Iommi. This was the single from the album with a classic video. The slow paced but brutally killer \\"Letters From Earth\\" follows and is an amazing dark song. The first half concluded with \\"Master of Insanity\\" which is my favorite on the album! Great bass intro and Butler and Iommi hadn't run out of riffs  and this is one of their best riffs ever and Dio's vocals rock.<br />\\"Time Machine\\" kicks off the album's second half and was another great track. This fast paced rocker rocks. \\"Sins of the Father\\" follows and sounds like a solo Dio track but still a great track. \\"Too Late\\" follows and was not a remake of the 1979 Journey track but a great melodic song with Dio's voice dominating. It starts soft but changes into a heavy rocker with hard powerful vocals and a pounding rhythm section. \\"I\\" follows and is not a remake of the KISS track from 1981 but a straight ahead heavy rocker. Dio's lyrics and vocals are at there best on this song. Iommi and Butler supply a killer riff and Appice's drums sounds like cannons being fired. The original cassette and Dehumanizer issues outside the US and Canada ended with \\"Buried Alive\\" which is a heavy dark song with superb lyrics and vocals by Ronnie. A good solo by Iommi once again. The US issue ends with another version of Time Machine which was the mix issued for the Wayne's World movie released earlier in 1992 but still a great track.<br />Dehumanizer did hit the US Top 50 but sadly fell from view as grunge and hip hop fluff ruled the charts. Sales aside, this album rocks but sadly, Sabbath and Dio and Appice would split again after this until 2006.<br />Recommended!follows and sounds like a solo Dio track but still a great track. \\"Too Late\\" follows and was not a remake of the 1979 Journey track but a great melodic song with Dio's voice dominating.

B000NA77YO|5.0|Black Sabbath's April, 2007 release which was a retrospective The Dio Years is an excellent overview to the Ronnie James Dio era in Black Sabbath.<br />Alot of fairweather Sabbath fans think Black Sabbath began and ended with Ozzy Osbourne from 1970-78 but they are WRONG! The band fired Ozzy in 1979 because his behavior was erratic and out of control because of drug and alcohol use. Then the surviving members which were guitarist Tony Iommi, bass player Terry Butler (nicknamed Geezer) and drummer Bill Ward recruited one-time Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio and all forged ahead.<br />The first album with Dio which was 1980's classic comeback Heaven and Hell is represented by pretty much the entire album. The choices from here are superb and they are \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Lady Evil\\", the classic title cut, the great \\"Die Young\\" and the classic closer \\"Lonely Is The Word\\".<br />1981's classic Mob Rules, which saw Ward exit and Vinny Appice fill in the vacated drum stool, is represented by its title track, the killer opener \\"Turn Up The Night\\", the superb \\"Voodoo\\" and one of my favorites \\"Falling Off The Edge Of The World\\". I know that \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\" was omitted but CDs can only store up to 80 minutes.<br />The 1982 live album Live Evil is represented by the stellar \\"Children Of The Sea\\".<br />1992's superb reunion album Dehumanizer is represented by the superb \\"After All (The Dead)\\", the excellent \\"TV Crimes\\" and \\"I\\". I wish \\"Computer God\\" was here but then again it would have been a 2-CD set.<br />The reason to acquire this set (in addition for the remastering) is for the THREE NEW SONGS which are \\"The Devil Cried\\", \\"Shadow Of The Wind\\" and \\"Ear In The Wall\\". Dio still has it vocally wise (whilst Ozzy is now a caricature of himself sounding like a dying seal). Iommi and Butler and Appice still play well.<br />This collection is the cream of the crop of the Dio era in Sabbath unless you want the new Rules of Hell box set.<br />RECOMMENDED!
B00005JPY0|5.0|Let me state catagorically, this is a great movie!!  Though it clocks in at two and half hours, it never lags, the pacing is perfect.  Much has been made of Ledgers take on the iconic Joker and he does not dissappoint.  When I heard a couple of years ago that he was Nolan's choice for the joker, I was like..\\"What the f?!!\\", Heath Ledger!!!, but he really infuses the character a sinister darkness.  At first, I was not crazy about his grunge look, with the greasy hair and smeared makeup, but as the movie progressed, the look was perfect.  The one on ones between the Joker and Bale's pent up Batman, really made the movie for me, the way the Joker taunts him and makes him look at his own demons is just great acting on Ledgers part.  Maggie Gyllenhaul is a real upgrade from the limited Holmes and Aaron Ekhart is perfect as Harvey Dent, with his chisled features and Redford hair, he cuts the perfect white knight image, though I was surprised at his look as he becomes Two-Face, it was unnerving, but really not as scary as it should have been.  Frankly, the only thing negative i can say about this film, is that with all the millions spent, couldnt they have come up with a hospital that didnt look like a regional medical center in some little backwater, it looked nothing like what a big city hospital looks like, I was shocked at the cheapness of the scenes there, it was incongruent with the rest of the movie, it was like an alien from another much cheaper B movie.  Overall, great movie, the best Batman movie by far...and Batman Begin was very good so that's saying a lot.  Highly recommended, there is no way you'll be disappointed if your into Batman or this genre.
B001EOOQF6|5.0|Black Sabbath's tenth album Mob Rules was released in late October of 1981 (in time for Christmas shopping here in the US).<br />Many fans of Black Sabbath must have thought that Ozzy Osbourne's firing from the band would have ruined Black Sabbath but the acquisition of (the late great) Ronnie James Dio was equipped with a great singer who gave Sabbath its heaviest album in years with 1980s Heaven and Hell.<br />After the success of Heaven and Hell, drummer Bill Ward left the band due to drug, alcohol and family problems leaving bass player Geezer Butler and guitarist Tony Iommi as the only two original Sabbath members left. Bill Ward was replaced by new drummer Vinnie Appice (younger brother of the legendary Carmine Appice of Vanilla Fudge, Beck Bogart and Appice, Rod Stewart and Cactus fame) and by default Sabbath was now an Anglo-American band (Dio and Appice being from the States while Iommi and Butler are Brits).<br />Returning, aside Dio, was producer Martin Birch and the band recorded its second effort with Dio. Is Mob Rules as good as its predecessor, read on and find out (as I did back in December of 1993 when I got the cassette and subsequently CD).<br />We open with the killer rocker \\"Turn Up The Night\\" which is an awesome rocker although some whine it is an inferior Neon Knights remake, I say no way! We follow with another excellent rocker present is \\"Voodoo\\", on which Iommi shells out some damn fine riffs. Next is the nearly EIGHT minute masterpiece, which is also this album's best track, \\"The Sign Of The Southern Cross\\". The track starts out acoustic before we rock out and Dio's lyrics are stellar. We segue into the instrumental \\"E5150\\" which was written for the movie Heavy Metal (released earlier that July) and is a great sort of intro to the first half of the album's closer which is the awesome title track. It's one of its best tracks of all of the album's nine tracks, in fact The Mob Rules' title cut was recorded for the movie Heavy Metal in July of 1981.<br />Mob Rules' second half starts with the rocker \\"Country Girl\\" which rocks. Dio's vocals are excellent and Iommi's riff and solos rock as well. Next is the rocker \\"Slipping Away\\" which has a superb Dio vocal plus messieurs Appice, Iommi and Butler each get to solo on the song's middle section. Next is another classic \\"Falling Off the Edge of the World\\" which is one of Sabbath's best songs ever! The opening to this song is incredible which is slow and lumbering and before long we speed things fast into a killer rocker. Dio's vocal performance is one of his best and his lyrics are among the best ever. The closing \\"Over and Over\\" is another classic. It's a slow dark doomy number with unbelievable vocals by Dio. Iommi's riff and solos are top notch as well.<br />The Mob Rules album was yet another US Top 30 album for the band and also achieving Gold status and is just as good if not better than Heaven and Hell, as this 2008 remaster by Rhino attests. Then another remaster was released in 2010 by Universal in Europe with the Live at Hammersmith 1981/82 CD that was available in a limited run in 2007.<br />Recommended!1981.<br />Mob Rules' second half starts with the rocker \\"Country Girl\\" which rocks.

0060763892|5.0|James Rollins had me hanging on every word with the Judas Strain. There were three very different, very exciting stories that tied into one by the end of the book. All the characters were likable and smart. It's filled with movie blockbuster action and pacing but none of it distracts you from the story. I highly recommend you give The Judas Strain a try.

B000F7OPCC|5.0|I know that the third installment in the \\"Indiana Jones\\" series is either loved or hated, but to me it's all in how you look at third films in any trilogy. For the most part, they are almost always more light hearted and comedic. It's like a wink to the audience, saying \\"we're still making these films\\"!!?? It's a solid action/adventure film in the tradition these film were created for in the first place, with great performances by all!<br /><br />I haven't seen the newest \\"Indiana Jones\\" film yet, but now that I have revisited the trilogy I'm ready to see it! I'm reviewing this film from the original box set which has a good disc of extras and the DVD transfers look very good! I rate this installment 4 1/2 stars.

B0015D3Z4O|5.0|HARD CANDY is madonna's last album with warner brothers...it's been 25 years since her 1982 debut single \\"everybody\\" and now she's still the reigning queen of pop, the world's best selling female artist of all time, and an icon of her generation!<br /><br />what makes this madonna album simply her most amazing album is that she came back to her roots: dance music - with some twists!<br /><br />CANDY SHOP - reminiscent of \\"where's the party\\" if you could notice their similarty.  the opening song for this album simply wants its listeners to get up and dance! a mixed bag of the sound of the 80's, the technology of the 90's and the blending of music of the new millennium!  with its simple (but naughty double entrede lyrics!) madonna invites everyone to her candy shop where everything is sticky and sweet!<br /><br />GIVE IT 2 ME - one of the best tracks in the album.  this time madonna asks her fans to give it to her - as she wants to break records, get arrested, or be undressed - whichever you want!  in a sudden twist of fate, this somehow became the new lead single of hard candy! not bad. this only means that madonna was able to follow-up \\"4-minutes\\" with another strong single.  the remixes of this song proves how good this song is!<br /><br />4 MINUTES - the first collaboration with timbaland and timberlake. this song made the fans thought that madonna will be sporting a \\"new hip hop sound.\\"  although 4 minutes is a good track, it was earlier thought of to isolate the vintage madonna sound from the queen of pop. luckily, the rest of the album is still madonna!  however, the remixes of this song really rocks and brought out its inner beauty! congrats to justin timberlake and timbaland!  just one of the many great collaboration of madonna and justin and timbaland.<br /><br />HEARTBEAT - one of the best tracks.  this song just brings back the madonna of the 80's. except for the new beats, this is definitely vintage!  this track seemed to belong between the LIKE A VIRGIN and TRUE BLUE era...i could not wait how the remixers would re-do this track.<br /><br />MILES AWAY - a ballad that seems to belong to the \\"ray of light\\" album.  this is another great track. the other great ballad in this album is \\"devil wouldn't recognize you.\\"  this song used acoustic guitars, techno beats and an ending similar to an earlier great track (easy ride from \\"american life\\") wherein a ballad goes techno or remixed towards the end! this is another great song and rumored to be the third single.<br /><br />SHE'S NOT ME - a funny but nevertheless great track.  once again, madonna lashed out at \\"wannabes\\" and \\"mistresses\\" and \\"copycats\\" who wanted to copy her.  nice guitar rifts that seem to belong to the \\"chic\\" era.  definitely a hard disco track reminiscent of the late 70's and early 80's - where madonna first came! one of two 6-minute tracks (the other is incredible) that is really a bonus for fans since madonna doesnt record songs that long nowadays! (is this dedicated to mariah?)  the simple use of bass and percussion is simply amazing. i only wish that it remained like that until the end. the ending (somehow fastened the speed of the song) seemed inappropriate.<br /><br />INCREDIBLE - another great track with a few seconds of intro. it's just hard to classify if its a dance track, since there are many stops, but one of its good parts is the voice loops which is seldom done nowadays. another seemingly \\"lost in the 80's\\" track.  the lyrics - \\"sex is incredible\\" - brought back \\"erotica\\" memories in a nice way.  this fun track clocked at around 6+minutes, but you wont realize it's over till it's over. this track is...incredible!!! however, i still wished that it remained to the groove it started with...<br /><br />BEAT GOES ON - my favorite track! i fell in love with this song the moment i heard the 30-second sample at amazon.com!!! a disco-inspired madonna track with great rappings from kanye west! she tried not to be repetitive in the refrain as madonnaplaced some variations and new arrangements and placed some \\"echo effects\\" which is also no longer common today. the best track of the album!!! cant wait for the remixes of this single!<br /><br />DANCE 2NIGHT - another excellent track! this song has very good basslines and guitar rifts. propbably belonged to the early 80's! the second best track in the \\"hard candy\\" album.  in the league of \\"come one let's party songs\\" such as holiday, into the groove and vogue! a great track with justin, you can actually listen to this and lucky star and you wont notice their 25-year difference. nice bass, nice lead guitars, nice lyrics, and great vocals.<br /><br />SPANISH LESSON - not a bad track, but seemed misplaced in the entire album.  madonna's humor is clearly present in this track.  she tries to be funny here but some fans did not get it! once again, madonna used acoustic guitars and her love for spanish words (just like in la isla bonita and what it feels like for a girl).<br /><br />DEVIL WOULDNT RECOGNIZE YOU - despite being a ballad, this is a great track that belongs to this album. it rivals \\"miles away\\" from being the best ballad track in the HARD CANDY album.  the sonic effects and vocal loops in the end was simply great! it's like listening to a remix/edit version! kinda remind me of \\"easy ride\\" from american life album.<br /><br />VOICES - a great song to close the album, although the track seems<br />to belong from the \\"ray of light\\" album again. it is akin to \\"power of goodbye.\\"  she asks her fans on who is the master and who is the slave...nice vocals from justin...however, the bass seems louder here unlike the rest of the tracks. it has a very dramatic ending, with the instrumentation used such as piano, violins and drums.<br /><br />despite all the write-ups and bad reviews, HARD CANDY is a better album than \\"music\\" and \\"american life\\" but without saying that the last two are not great.  i could even say that it even surpassed 2005's euro-disco smash \\"confessions on a dancefloor\\" as the songs in HARD CANDY are more ear-friendly and groove-ready! the advantage of \\"confessions\\" is that it sounded more coherent than \\"candy\\" but nonetheless, this album will be able tog enerate more hit singles! this is the sequel to the 80's madonna -  a persona we fans have been missing for a long time...<br /><br />get the album and complete madonna's final journey with warner brothers...<br /><br />long live the queen!<br /><br />(you may get the \\"extended edition\\" of HARD CANDY from madonnastore.com. for all the extended version of all album tracks!)ts\\" which is also no longer common today. the best track of the album!!! cant wait for the remixes of this single!

B0010VD7EO|5.0|I have MGMT's real first album, the one you could only buy over the internet or at their shows.  I've been listening to it religiously for a couple of years, all seven songs.  I'm glad to see that Time to Pretend and Kids made it to this album.  But what happened to my favorites, Boogie Down and Destrokk?  Either way, it's fantastic to see these guys get broader distribution.  I'm outside of their generation, having grown up with 80's alternative bands influenced by VU (okay, and listening to a lot VU and other 70's psych bands along the way), and these guys have sure got talent.  It's refreshing to see in today's music.  For a treat, go to youtube and search both Boogie Down and Destrokk.  \\"High fi fellas and low fi chicks\\"  brilliant.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Throne of Blood is a study of a warlord (played by Toshiro Mifune) led by fate in form of a prophesy, straight to his doom. Is it the prophesy or the characters lack of trust in each other that leads them to their doom? The film has a supernatural element: a spirit who, early in the movie, utters a prophesy. This is not a realistic movie depicting 16th century  Japan, but rather a dark fairy tale. The acting and the stage sets are terrific, and the film can easily be watched again.<br />This DVD is up to Criterions usual standards. The picture is awesome (I watched it on a projector) with sharp details of armor pieces and foggy landscapes rendered beautiful. Especially for a movie 47 years old. Also there are two different subtitles, the new one is considered more difficult. I watched it with the new one and while some sentences seemed a little strange, there are no difficulties understanding what is going on.
B00008MLSH|5.0|Gorgeous. Sexy. Pop-star charisma. And the voice of an angel...a strong one. This album was her debut seven years ago; she's done a bit of developing since then, and would now be well classified as a lyric soprano.<br /><br />My favorites here were the excerpts from \\"Lucia\\" and \\"Manon\\", as well as \\"Musetta's Waltz\\". The Mozart really didn't fit. \\"Traviata\\" is her forte; ditto \\"La Boheme\\" [either soprano part]. I hope she stays away from some of the heavier stuff...Desdemona, Leonore [both], Norma. [Sleep well, Rosa; you're safe].<br /><br />Anna is an opera singer with rock-star looks and drawing power...she was a work in progress seven years ago, and, really, still is. Grab this [and her duet disc with Villazon], and see what the fuss is about.

B000BB14YY|5.0|Ran is my favourite Kurosawa film. And thankfully Criterion have made an edition with good transfer and tons of extras. The film is so rich, both visually pleasing and with a moral dimension. Here we follow an elder succesful warrior and clan-leader on a path where he is confronted with dark karma created by his earlier cruel deeds, and the deceitfulness of his nearest allies. The tranquil old age he seeks seems impossible because of the greed and brutality among allies and family members, the same greed and brutality that he himself used to get to the top!
B001ACY8D2|4.0|For a guy who is notorious for his lack of attention to lyrical substance, Sigur Ros has always been a welcome listen for me.  When the soaring, melismatic vocals of J&oacute;nsi Birgisson float by you in Icelandic (or in the band's own language hybrid, Hopelandic), being able to invest 100% of my attention in the massive instrumental soundscapes feels like indulgence at its most satisfying.  \\"Glosoli\\" from 2005's \\"Takk\\" and \\"Popplagið\\" from 2002's \\"()\\" represent this idea quite clearly, and give the uninformed listener plenty of indications as to why words such as \\"winter\\", \\"stratospheric\\", and \\"grandeur\\" seem to appear in most critical reviews of the band.<br /><br />For those who may not find the shoegazing tempos of \\"()\\" as a comfy entry point to a catalogue that is well deserving of all the hype it has received, check out \\"Með Suð I Eyrum Við Spilum Endalaust.\\"  The songs, with their shorter lengths, slightly less unpredictable structures, and more intimate production, suggest all the benchmarks of pop songwriting.  Yes, the lyrics are still in Icelandic, sans the closer, but so much of the ethereal sparkle has been stripped away from these tunes that for once, the band seems be wholeheartedly inviting you into their warm little circle instead of tempting you with entry into a sonic vortex.<br /><br />Opening track \\"Gobbledigook\\" is a energetic way to kick things off, as tribal percussion, acoustic guitar, and background vocals intertwine to create hemiolas that sound as if they were pulled from the Steve Reich school of composition.  And like everything else Sigur Ros does, it works.  \\"Inn&iacute; M&eacute;r Syngur Vitleysingur\\" prominently features horns and mallet percussion that began to surface on \\"Takk\\" three years ago.  There is no doubt that they greatly contribute to the organic direction many listeners hear the band taking.  If you want to find a tune on here that will send you checking your thesaurus for adjectives like \\"hypnotic\\", try \\"Festival\\".  The centerpiece of the album, it is the longest track and features all of the hallmarks of the band before they dug into conventional song formats: a slow build that begins with only vocals and keyboard, followed by orchestral crescendos, propulsive drumming, and life affirming cadences that pack an emotional wallop set on leaving you breathless.  And no surprise here: it works.<br /><br />This is not the titanic post-rock that we have come to expect from Sigur Ros these past 8 years.  Often speculated to be one-trick ponies hiding behind all of the reverb and delay, \\"Með Suð I Eyrum Við Spilum Endalaust\\" proves that that the has been able to retain the most familar elements of their signature sound while still embarking across new and perhaps more inviting musical terrain.  If you're not convinced that this is just happy quartet of musicians wanting to make quality pop music, take a look at the album cover....it makes a pretty convincing case.it is the longest track and features all of the hallmarks of the band before they dug into conventional song formats: a slow build that begins with only vocals and keyboard, followed by orchestral crescendos, propulsive drumming, and life affirming cadences that pack an emotional wallop set on leaving you breathless.

B0017XFBMG|5.0|What an age we're living in ; at $13 per disc of the gritty elegance that is the Pogues this set cannot be beat . Full resonant sound, great remastering and also has an annotated booklet of 50 odd pages including photos. The 6 live tracks from a show in Glasgow at the height of their powers are a special treat. If you are a fan (or if you just like full blooded music) you must have it - hell, buy several and distribute some as Christmas presents,

0743487486|3.0|I like Kohn's challenge to critically examine our parenting practices, keeping in mind our ultimate goals for our children.  He makes strong points emphasizing the importance of considering the consequences of our parenting choices, whether they are ostensibly positive, such as praise, or intentionally negative, such as punishment.  However, I found myself anxious to get through all the theory to the practical application.  My anticipation was never quite quenched by the implementation ideas offered.  I found most of them to be lacking in substance and fraught with caveats.  I felt that Kohn was often shrugging his shoulders, implying that this is the way things need to be done, even if compliance never happens and the parents' needs are not met.  I have taken Kohn's basic premise--that children have a fundamental right to unconditional love--and tried to extend it beyond words to more carefully considered action.  I am using more descriptive, rather than evaluative, language when commenting on my three-year-old son's activities, and I have moved away from contingency management discipline, which had lost both its effectiveness and its peacefulness.  Still, there are times when compliance is necessary, and I believe that I have rights and needs in the parent-child relationship, too.  I frequently find it necessary to impose potential consequences, which Kohn would characterize as threats.  When my son resists my requests to stop throwing balls at me while I am working on the computer because it disturbs me, I ultimately resort to saying, \\"If you want to stay in here with me, you must stop throwing that ball now.  Otherwise, you will lose the ball, and you will have to leave the room.\\"  I struggle with guilt about saying that after reading Kohn's strong admonitions against threats, consequences and love withdrawal, but the reality is that I am responsible for finding a way to make living with my son tolerable, even enjoyable, for both of us.  I am keeping my long-term goals for him in mind, but I am functioning in the present, and I believe that I have a right to live without walking on eggshells to protect my son's fragile psyche at all costs.
B000YAA68C|4.0|P.S.: I Love You is a good love story. I know, it's a chick flick. Well, it's a chick flick that has something to offer guys. Gerard Butler (300) is not exactly your soap-opera-idol type, nor is Hilary Swank (Million Dollar Baby). It's an interesting match, and makes for enjoyable interaction, both playful and feisty. Oh, did I mention that one of the couple dies in the first act?<br /><br />Hold on. I didn't just ruin the movie for you. That's the main point: Gerry (Gerard Butler) is dying, so he clandestinely writes a stack of letters to his wife, Holly, each ending with, \\"P.S.: I love you.\\" Then he has someone send them to her one-at-a-time over the course of a year. The letters guide Holly into a new life. And they provide writer-director Richard LaGravenese (Freedom Writers, Horse Whisperer) with a vehicle for doing a ton of flashbacks between Gerry and Holly. It's quite effective.<br /><br />This is a comedy, and it is very funny. For the most part, Gerry's the funny man and Holly's the straight person. Gerry's a sly Irishman that knows how to wheedle; and Holly's a determined career woman that doesn't have a clue what she wants. As a matter of fact, Gerry asks her point-blank: \\"What do you want?\\" It is a poignant question that permeates the film. As Gerry holds his discontented wife in his arms, he says, \\" I know what I want, 'cause I'm holding it in my hands. Do you?\\" She doesn't. And it takes Gerry's death for her to figure that out.<br /><br />Using post mortem love letters to reveal Gerry and Holly's relationship is quite clever. It is fun getting to know this off-the-wall couple: Gerry, an Irish musician, who is the life of the party and brings humor even to his own death; and Holly, the cautious and pensive artist, questioning everything and offering pithy observations. We see that they love each other very much; but, like many of us, Holly doesn't appreciate what she has until he's gone. Fortunately, she gets a second chance with Gerry's letters; and, predictably, over the course of the film, Holly realizes what she is missing and what she now wants.<br /><br />The journey that Holly takes is painful for her, but fun for us. Most women will find it difficult to hold back the tears. But woven throughout are funny, even hilarious, moments, especially because of Holly's two wacky friends, played by Lisa Kudrow (Friends) and Gina Gershon (Rescue Me). Also, Harry Connick, Jr. plays an utter dork - but a philosophical one; Kathy Bates is Holly's practical mother - but a kind-hearted one; and Jeffrey Dean Morgan becomes Holly's new love interest - all entertaining performances.<br /><br />Obviously, this isn't the first time the subject of what women want has been breached. Back in 2000, a film by that title, starring Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt, made a half-hearted though entertaining effort at answering that question. Advertising creative Mel Gibson miraculously acquires the ability to read women's minds, which leads him to believe he now knows what they want, and can turn that knowledge to his advantage. However, he is mistaken because - as Holly points out to Harry Connick's character in P.S.: I Love You - even women themselves don't know what they want. So, even if men could read their minds - as many women seem to think we should - that still wouldn't help. No, like women's handbags of generations past, women's minds will always and forever remain mysteries, and rightly so; until God chooses to reveal them, which, I predict, will leave a lot of guys with perplexing looks on their faces and uttering, \\"You've got to be kidding.\\" I'm sure I will be one of them.<br /><br />Gerard Butler and Hilary Swank are wonderful in P.S.: I Love You. Butler, who typically switches between action hero (300, Beowulf And Grendel, Tomb Raider: Cradle Of Life) and romantic lead (Phantom Of The Opera, Dear Frankie), has his best romantic role to date in this film. This is also the first time since Phantom that he has been able to show offhis musical abilities. And, even though he's from Scotland, he is really Irish, so he has that going for him as well. But, don't expect him to have those abs from 300 - they are long gone.<br /><br />Swank is a two-time Academy Award-Winning Best Actress: Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby (2004). She loves the outdoors (sky diving, river rafting and skiing), which makes her perfect for the scenes in Ireland - a very outdoorsy country and my favorite part of the movie, especially her scenes with Gerry. Swank is honey and vinegar personified - exactly what the good-natured Gerry needs and, between the two of them, the right chemistry for this romantic comedy.<br /><br />If someone were to ask me, \\"What do women want,\\" I would say, \\"I know what they need: a good pair of practical shoes. What they probably want is the most impractical, outrageous pair of designer shoes out there.\\" I would have said that before watching P.S.: I Love You. Now that I've seen it, it is extremely interesting to me that shoes do play an important role in this film, and in Holly's figuring out what she wants. If women ever did discover the joys and comforts of practical footwear, there would be a revolution. Suddenly, they would know exactly what they wanted, and there would no longer be a need for Hollywood, New York or Paris. I don't think that's going to happen in my lifetime.<br /><br />Waitsel Smithrom Scotland, he is really Irish, so he has that going for him as well.

0743270754|5.0|Saying great things about a great man like Lincoln reminds me of my favorite Christmas song: \\"And though it's been said many times, many ways...\\".  But this book is a gem.  It really shows us what a genius Lincoln was and gives us so much insight on him and his cabinet at the same time.  She describes people and personalities until you find yourself in the room with them.  Like the great Ken Burns, she is delivering these people to us-- not through a 'this happened and then this happened' manner-- but via \\"emotional archaeology\\".  The ending-- although I know it well-- still made me choke up with anxiety and sadness; emotions that only a great writer like her can evoke.  And while you cover all the great events, I LOVE YOUR DETAILS Mrs Goodwin.  For example: Seward oddly noticed that his assassin was a \\"fine looking man\\" dressed in \\"handsome cloth\\".  That sort of minutiae--- to a veteran of textbook history like myself-- is such gold.  Doris Kearns Goodwin, I fell in love with you when I first saw you talking about George Washington's ill-fitting teeth, then again as you chronicled your youth as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan... and now, after this work, I find myself falling once again.  Like I said, you are a rare treasure.
B0000019PA|5.0|By the time I was appreciating music as a young man stumbling onto records, one group I would grow to love was already over - and I was crushed to learn online that there would probably never be a chance for me to see the group perform the songs live.  I remember fervently trying to make up for that by searching for hours for Neutral Milk Hotel rarities and demos, an act I normally just don't do - even for bands I really enjoy.  I searched for photographs and interviews with Jeff Mangum, wondering where this mysterious, power-voiced balladeer disappeared to.     And I am still reasonably sure that the allure is more than just the mystery, or whatever it was about losing Cobain that made everyone think Nirvana was so great.  Even now, after listening to this record for years and years, I'm still floored by the lyrics and delivery, the sheer, brute force and clarity of the communication.  I don't think I'll ever shake the eerie feeling of barely-perceived magnitude - of utter awe- I got when I heard the songs on Areoplane at 15 or 16.  It makes me utterly uncomfortable to have such a strong one-way avenue of communication from such an enigmatic, commanding figure.  When I put the records on now, it's like he just walks into the room, sits you down, and says listen to me.  Don't move.  Don't speak.  Don't breathe until I'm finished, and everything will make sense.

0345457692|4.0|Morgan writes with real verve and creates a richly detailed and morally complex world, much like Raymond Chandler, to whom the novel is obviously indebted. Another obvious comparison would be William Gibson, who put these elements (noir detection and sci-fi) together first, but Morgan is actually a much more skilled writer than he. All in all an impressive and engrossing work. My only problem was philosophical in nature: the idea that our \\"pure mind\\" can be extracted from our bodies and \\"re-sleeved\\" in another body is actually fairly old-fashioned in its dualism. Whatever consciousness is, it is clearly embodied, and to think of it as existing apart from our bodies perpetuates a time-worn fallacy.

B000NA2BEU|3.0|I loved this show when it came out. I thought it was really different and the players were deep and you loved getting to know them. We were led on a journey to find out what made them tick. In season three the characters changed in ways that were not very flattering or developed. I am not sure if it was the change of network or a downward spiral in writing, but the third season left behind reason and never looked back. I spent most of season three wanting to put Veronica on \\"time out\\" and shaking my head at Logan. These characters deserved more. Like any good show you have to ride the wave to the end and there were some really good moments, but the writers lost touch with what made us fall in love with these people and introduced new people not worth knowing. If you get this season on sale it is worth buying!
B000IOM1YG|5.0|I was tempted to call this their most underrated, but despite \\"Tales'\\" standing among APP fans, I still think that \\"honor\\" (?) goes to \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\".  I think because APP's albums after \\"Tales\\" were all on the Arista label (here in the US anyway), \\"Tales\\" got swept under the rug for many years, especially since its original version wasn't available (aside from MFSL) until just recently.    But hey!!  This is supposed to be a review of \\"Pyramid\\"!  Sorry, just needed to get that disclaimer out there before moving on.      \\"Pyramid\\" came out between \\"I Robot\\" (with a top 40 single in \\"I Wouldn't Want To Be Like You\\", and the instrumental title track which many people know and don't realize it) and \\"Eve\\" (Top 40: \\"Damned If I Do\\").    So this one didn't have any \\"hits\\".  This is a great album and if you're an APP fan, this remaster is a must if only for the better sound quality.  This is a vast improvement on prior editions of this CD.  The bonus material is what it's supposed to be, maybe not essential, but a glimpse into some of the blueprint versions of what ultimately was put out on the final release.  Worth having if you're a fan.    The Project did enjoy some hit singles in the late 70s and early 80s, but I think most of their real fans appreciate the albums.  Don't let this one get away.  The three instrumentals are amazing, and all the other songs are beyond worthwhile.  The opening three (especially \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again\\") are all classic Parsons.
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Stephen Schwartz is nothing if not predictable.  His Broadway scores follow a formula:  a slam-bang opening number, a solo number (sort of an \\"I want...\\" type of song) that serves to reveal the hidden fears, hopes and dreams of the show's deceptively complex protagonist, and at least one song that defines the show's message -- almost an anthem of sorts.  This formula served Mr. Schwartz well in the 1970's, when he penned the scores of the Broadway hits \\"Godspell\\" and \\"Pippin,\\" before taking a hiatus from stage composing to make a go of the more challenging genre of motion pictures.  With \\"Wicked,\\" Stephen Schwartz has turned in a predictable, but supremely enjoyable, and -- for lack of better word -- approachable musical score that does everything it shoud do:  explores and exposes what makes the characters tick, moves the story along, and ultimately leaves the audience with something to remember -- a tune to hum on the way out of the theater, or even a turn of phrase to internalize and repeat later on.    \\"Wicked\\" is by no means great theater.  Stephen Schwartz's work will never be comparable to even the most mundane works by Sondheim, or the better works of Lloyd Webber.  But it's fun theater -- easily assimilated, easily appreciated, and easily remembered.  He may follow a formula, but at least he has the good sense to follow one that works.    In many ways, \\"Wicked\\" represented a return to the traditional book musical, i.e., a musical with a spoken script as well as songs.  This was an all but dying artform when the show opened in 2003, as audiences had come to expect the near operatic structures of shows like \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" and \\"Miss Saigon.\\"  Most surely, as much of \\"Wicked's\\" story is told by the spoken dialogue as by the songs.  Maybe more.      Perhaps that is why the producers of the Original Broadway Cast CD were careful to eliminate passages of dialogue that were in the midst of songs, and rearranged and re-edited most of the numbers to effect astreamlined, purely musical experience that stands separate from the show upon which it is based.      Much like many of the original Broadway cast recordings of the Columbia hey-day in the 1950's and 1960's, this is no audio rendering of the stage show.  It is an entirely distinct piece of work that stands on its own feet.  One needn't have seen \\"Wicked\\" on stage to enjoy this CD; all that's needed is an ear for infectious tunes and lyrics that make some bold statements without ever becoming preachy.    Some have hypothesized that the pre-record editing of the \\"Wicked\\" score was an intentional effort to preserve the surpise aspects of the storyline for those who hadn't yet seen the show.  This theory is partially supported by the fact that the CD jacket does not contain a synopsis.  Yet, this seems unlikely, as almost everyone at all familiar with the show knows it as a prequel to \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" and we ALL know how that turns out.  Safer to say that the CD was carefully crafted to avoid dialogue or musical passages that would only serve to confuse listeners that had not seen the play; better to clear the way for unadulterated appreciation of the songs -- beautifully rendered by skilled vocalists and an expert orchestral back-up.    Leading ladies Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel give powerhouse readings of some very challenging material.  Ms. Chenoweth's pristine coloratura is given its best showing to date in a performance that is as near perfection as any human voice can get.  Even the most discriminating listener would be hard-pressed to find even one off-key note emanating from her vocal cords.  Her superb comic timing -- no secret to Broadway audiences since her performance as Sally in the 1999 revival of \\"You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown\\" -- is on fine display.      Equally impressive is Idina Menzel, whose dusky mezzo soprano fleshes out a complex character without ever descending into overacting or camp.  Whether crooning the show's romantic ballad \\"As Long As You're Mine,\\" or belting the finale of \\"Defying Gravity\\" to the second balcony, Ms. Menzel displays an astounding control of material that would reduce less adept singers to shrieking histronics.  Surpassing mere singing, she injects her songs with pathos and true humanity.  It may be a performance with \\"Tony Award\\" written all over it, but it works -- and it works well.      The entire CD is well-mixed, with an appropriate balance of voice and orchestra that sometimes eluded the sound engineers at the cavernous Gershwin Theater, where \\"Wicked\\" makes its Broadway home.  For the most part, the deletions of material that is not purely musical are appropriate and well-chosen.  One might carp about a few editions here and there (Madame Morrible's missing speech to the people of Oz condemning Elphaba as wicked at the beginning of \\"Defying Gravity,\\" or the absence of Elphaba's defiant cry of \\"It's me-e-e-e-e!\\")  But these can only be minor flies in an otherwise expertly-formulated ointment.    \\"Wicked\\" may not be the greatest show ever written; it didn't break new ground or make theater history in the eyes of drama scholars (as did shows like \\"Oklahoma\\" or \\"Sweeney Todd\\").  But it stands as a splendidly enjoyable and memorable work, whether seen in its entirety in a stage production or listened to on this delightful CD.

B000002VFW|5.0|HOTTTTTTTT album!! A brilliant debut album from a brilliant artist. A landmark for it's time with Lisa's sexy, passionate vocals (mistaken for a black singer), lush orchestration, catchy ++ lyrics/hooks and perfect combination of dance/house/pop/soul beats. Every song is amazing and could have been a hit but my favorites are of course, \\"All Around The World\\" (huge worldwide #1 hit), \\"This Is The Right Time\\" (club smash produced by Coldcut), \\"You Can't Deny It\\" (her second U.S. #1 on the R&B charts), \\"Sincerity\\"(so smooth), \\"When Are You Coming Back\\" (melancholic, slow burning groove), \\"Love In Me\\" (another great dance floor number). Many of the tracks on AFFECTION were remixed by such hot DJ pioneers as Yvonne Turner, Shep Pettibone, DJ Mark the 45 King and Gail \\"Sky\\" King. Still makes an impact to this day, I first heard this album as a teenager and IT CHANGED MY LIFE!! Lisa's sound ushered in a whole dimension of sound for me in the 90's and I still play it to this day!! Ultra necessary for your collection!!
B00003CXB4|2.0|I'd like to say the the price wasn't too cheap, because at $23.00, I could have bought this movie new.  I figured I haven't had a bad experience in the 2 years I've been purchasing items from Amazon, so I'd buy it anyway.  The delivery time was excellent, the case was neat and the disk was spotless...perhaps too clean.  It is a copied movie onto a DVD from a pack of DVDs done up with a Label Maker.  The movied started skipping as Simba went to sing \\"I Just Can't Wait To Be King\\", and then totally stopped playing!  Since it was being played at a sleepover, I had to keep trying 'cause the children were totally looking forward to it.  I eventually had to turn it off since it wouldn't fastforward, turn it back on and from the menu, skip a chapter then slowly rewind as close to Simba's song as possible so they could finish watching it...then it did just about the same thing at the hyena/Scar's song \\"Be Prepared\\".  Disappointing, but didn't want to go through possibly more hassle with trying to return it to the sender.

1932100660|5.0|Wow, how refreshing to find an author who is a genuine authority, who supports his conclusions with fact and who lacks the bias that drives many writers on this subject to deceive and mislead, most doctors to remain ignorant of and uninterested in the relationship between health and nutrition and most of the food industry and medical profession too busy making money to care.  This book deals with science, not politics.  I read it five weeks ago and was so motivated by it I altered my diet to whole foods only.  My blood pressure has improved from borderline hypertensive to 106/67 and I feel trimmer and fitter already.  I've purchased the book for my children so they have some basis for questioning conventional advice on this important subject.

B00005JPS8|4.0|If you can ignore the product placement.<br /><br />An excellent rendition of a comicbook with a surprisingly good performance by Robert Downey Jr.  Gwyneth Paltrow was, of course, superlative, and Jeff Bridges was unexpectedly good as a villain.  It would be easy to wax poetical about sins and redemption, friendships, betrayal, a man unable to cope with a good woman and drowning his sorrows with less worthy ones, etc, but I'll leave that for the freshman English students.<br /><br />It was a rollicking good action flick.  Flying armor suits, bad guys you can really hate, cliff-hanging escapes from life threatening situations,a good guy who becomes more loveable than he starts out, chases, shoot-outs, a sidekick with more style than brains (what one would expect from a fighter-jock) and a beautiful love interest.  Yup, blocks are all checked.  All of this executed very competently, and well acted.<br /><br />If only they had been a little more discrete with product placement.  The Bulgari watch was very emblematic of this.  Like the watch, the movie had an excellent mechanism in terms of plot and production values.  Like the watch, the brand names were more than a little bit over-done.<br /><br />Still, the movie was very enjoyable.<br /><br />E.M. Van Court
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I will go out of my way to avoid \\"action\\" movies,I just think they're mostly boring, and I don't buy them for myself.  So you know what I mean when I say that this film joins a very slender category in my DVD collection.  Yes, it's an action movie but don't hold that against it.  It's an absolute marvel of images of western civilization ( Don't tell that to the \\"action\\" movie junkies, just let them enjoy it. ) and if you think you just saw a reference to paintings of the the adoration of the Christ child you're right.  I won't give away any more of what's going on but my respect for Alfonso Cuaron went sky high with this movie.
0440238153|2.0|In his third volume of \\"His Dark Materials\\" Philip Pullman brings his epic to a world shattering climax.  The Specters are wreaking havoc not just in the world of Ci'gazze, but also now in other worlds.  The Church, to prevent another Fall of humanity, hatches a diabolical and misguided plot to prevent it.  Lord Asriel's forces are gathered and the Angels of the resistance and those of The Authority gather from the far reaches of Creation for a battle that will affect everything and everyone.  Add into that a scientist who will lead the two most crucial people, who unknown to almost everyone else will decide the fate of God and man, into a new era.<br /><br />Lyra and Will race through this story at break neck speed their audacity, tenacity, love for each other, and their faith are inspiring.  In the tale-spinning department \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" does not disappoint.  I stayed up way to late reading this to find out what would happen next.  However, I was as disturbed by the implications for Pullman's depiction of God as I was entertained by his characters.  Like \\"the Chronicles of Narnia\\", \\"His Dark Materials\\" teaches a world-view lesson.  Pullman's world has no definite Creator that the characters can identify, and paints Yahweh (the God of Christianity and Judaism) as an angelic usurper much like Satan.  This is a quote from Pullman's website, \\"Question:  His Dark Materials seems to be against organised religion. Do you believe in God?  Answer:  I don't know whether there's a God or not. Nobody does, no matter what they say. I think it's perfectly possible to explain how the universe came about without bringing God into it, but I don't know everything, and there may well be a God somewhere, hiding away.<br />Actually, if he is keeping out of sight, it's because he's ashamed of his followers and all the cruelty and ignorance they're responsible for promoting in his name. If I were him, I'd want nothing to do with them.\\"  This book, unlike the other two in the series, is not subtle in promoting a mystical agnostic world-view.  For example, a main character who sums up much of the story says, \\"The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\"<br /><br />Mr. Pullman is entitled to his point of view, and he has a point.  People who call themselves Christians have done some heinous things in the name of God and Christ.  The questions he brings up in his books are valid questions that need to be addressed by those who have faith in Jesus.  However, parents need to know the message promoted by this story b/c book one is so wonderful, book two keeps you interested and reveals a bit about the underlying assumptions behind this work of fiction, and book three reveals what Mr. Pullman wanted to say all along; Christianity is false and a mistake.<br /><br />So, because I have a strong love for Jesus and His Church I am sad to say I do not recommend this book to any but the most discerning and mature of readers; which is not the audience marketers aim at when selling this book.btle in promoting a mystical agnostic world-view.

0743289692|5.0|This book is about the life of Ayaan.  It begins in Somalia where Ayaan is born.  She is brought up in a Muslim family.  Her mother wants to lead a very strict Muslim life, her father is a bit more relaxed but still obeys the Muslim rule.<br /><br />Her father is a member of a political movement that is working against the president of Somalia, Siad Barre.  As a result, the family had to move around a lot to be safe.  First Saudi Arabia, where they were exposed to the very strict rules of Islam.  Woman were totally covered and could not leave the house without a male family member.  After Saudi, they moved to Ethiopia and then on to Kenya.  Ayaan tried to live as a devote Muslim but she was disillusioned with the violence, the intolerance and the treatment of women.<br /><br />When she was in her early 20's, her father arranged a marriage for her with a Muslim who was living in Canada.  Ayaan was sent to Germany to await her VISA.  While she was there and was exposed to Western culture, she made the quick decision to go to Holland and apply for refugee status and hide from her family.  Eventually the family found her but she refused to leave Holland and divorced her husband.<br /><br />Ayaan went to school in Holland and earned her degree in political science.  She becomes politically active in Holland and is elected as a member of Parliament.  She becomes an atheist and is very open about Islam and begins to speak and write about it's deception.  The overall theme of this book is, there is no line drawn between moderate and extreme Islam.  It is all the same. As a result of her openness, she has received many death threats and must live her life hidden from those that have sentenced her to death.<br /><br />Some interesting and very eye opening quotes in this book about Islam. \\"Every society that is still in the rigid grip of Islam oppresses women and also lags behind in development.  Most of these societies are poor; many are full of conflict and war.  Societies that respect the rights of women and their freedom are wealthy and peaceful.\\" ....the Quran is an act of man, not of God.  We should be free to interpret it; we should be permitted to apply it to the modern era in a different way, instead of performing painful contortions to try to recreate the circumstances of a horrible distant past.\\"  In Saudi Arabia, every breath, every step we took, was infused with concepts of purity or sinning, and with fear.  Wishful thinking about the peaceful tolerance of Islam cannot interpret away this reality: hands are still cut off, women still toned and enslaved, just as the Prophet Muhammad decided centuries ago.\\" \\" Life is better in Europe than it is in the Muslim world because human relations are better, and one reason human relations are better is that in the West, life on earth is valued in the here and now, and individuals enjoy rights and freedoms that are recognized and protected by the state.  To accept subordination and abuse because Allah willed it----that, for me, would be self hatred.\\"  As a member of Parliament, Ayaan proposed dramatically reducing unemployment benefits and abolishing the minimum wage.  \\"From my experience as a translator with welfare cases, I knew that easy access to generous unemployment benefits leads to a poverty trap:  people in Holland often make more money from welfare than they would in actual jobs.\\"<br /><br />Ayaan is my new hero.  Her bravery and openness in her speech about Islam is truly amazing and sets an example.  Our society needs to listen carefully to Ayaan and stop being afraid of being viewed as racist as they dare to scrutinize this backward culture.of women and their freedom are wealthy and peaceful.\\" ....the Quran is an act of man, not of God.

0064431789|4.0|This one is a classic, of course. Chances are that you remember it from your own childhood, what more is there to say?    My nieces love this one. It's not too wordy, so it's great for very little children and for those nights where you really want everybody in bed five minutes ago! But the words that are there are perfectly selected, nothing is missing. Lyrical is the word I'd use.     And the story about Max having his time-out and repenting (or, for that matter, his mother changing her mind about her over-reaction) is one that most children can relate to, I think.
B0012Q732O|3.0|People seem to get worked up about these things.  This film is OK - there is action, pretty good characters, and a reasonably coherent story.  I could watch it and do something else at the same time, kind of relaxing background entertainment.  That's what it is.<br /><br />Now if you get into questions of accuracy, it is only marginally better than its reference predecessor, One Million Years BC.  The saber tooths are too big and smart as are the monstrously huge predatory birds.  Then there are the (proto?) Egyptians, who are 7000 years too early.  But do we need to quibble?  This is basic junk, however fun it is while I fill out my tax forms.<br /><br />Recommended within these limits.
032147404X|5.0|Love this book ...................Lots of great information within!!  Great price and great service...........Thanks Amazon!
0061537934|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  Has the reader laughing and crying all within the same cover.  I'd recommend it.
B000Q8QH0I|5.0|Prior to making this film noir classic in the tradition of \\"Chinatown\\", Curtis Hanson made 2 films which helped along with this film to elevate him to the A-list of directors--\\"The River Wild\\" & \\"The Bedroom Window\\" (a film noir in the tradition of Hitchcock).  With the success of this film (several Oscar nominations with a win for Kim Basinger and Best Picture/Director nod), Hanson went on to make the under-rated \\"Wonder Boys\\", \\"8 Mile\\" w/Enimen and the chick flick \\"In Her Shoes\\".  But none matched the success of this classic film noir based on a James Ellroy novel. Why?  For one thing he had a fool-proof cast with veterans, Kevin Spacey, Danny Devito & James Cromwell matched with the 2 new Australian newcomers, Russell Crowe & Guy Pearce in their first all-American roles. Also Kim Basinger delivered a poignant Oscar winning performance as Hollywood prostitute who is redemned by her relationship with Crowe's character, Bud White.  Another plus is the sharp dialogue courtesy of Ellroy and the great score by Jerry Goldsmith.  If you liked \\"Chinatown\\"(which Goldsmith also contributed a memorable score) then you'll like this one.  Devotees of the book may balk at the happy ending of the film versus the book but perhaps that would've lessen the films chance for box off success--who knows. If it where not for the movie about that big boat that sank, this film would've copped the Best Picture Oscar!!  I can't wait for the Blu-ray release of this classic!!
140130916X|5.0|This book came in perfect condition, and came sooner than expected! I was very happy with this product.
B00000JZC4|4.0|There are some good songs on this CD and some what I would call \\"fluff\\".  Take a Picture is probably the weakest of songs on the CD and I know that will be an unpopular stance, but it is definitely not representative of the entire album.  For me the song that stands out the most is Skinny.  It has the soft intro and verses that lead into a rocking chorus.  This song, and many of the others are equal too or better than Hey Man Nice Shot, which should be expected of a follow-up album if the band has talent.  I enjoy this album immensely.
B000022TSW|5.0|I just watched this movie again tonight....and I'm happy to say that it really holds up well! The satire is right on and repeated viewings allow me to see new nuances and jokes that I missed earlier. This is always the sign of a classic movie! Sure the language is pretty foul...but that's the whole point, you uncle f****eer!
1592289444|4.0|Well, the story itself may be untrue, and come to a point where it's even farcical in what it tries to put over on readers (seeing a pair of menacing yetis in the Himalayas while crossing the mountains in winter with all of rusty wire and animal dung as provisions). But! This is a moot point, because as a tale, it's first-rate. If you can allow the fraud (and there's no real reason to get upset about it), there are large rewards to be had from The Long Walk. The story of the trek to freedom is incredible and very compelling, page b' page. The prose isn't the best, but it serves its singular point well in keeping the action moving and gripping. It's entirely designed in this way, to be a terrific story, and true or not, it only assists itself with all its narrative tendencies.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|After the events of \\"Superman\\", a missle in space accidently unleashes three deadly kryptonian criminals named Non, Zod and Ursa (Jack O'Holloran, Terrence Stamp and Sarah Douglas) out of their phantom-zone prison as they head to Earth. Lois Lane (Margot Kidder) believes that Clark Kent is Superman and would do anything even if it's dangerous to Clark to prove he is Superman, later on he does reveal his secret to Lois and wants to marry her. He gives up his powers to become a mortal man, unfortunately criminal mastermind Lex Luthr (Gene Hackman) has escaped from prison to join forces with the deadly trio to take over the world, now Clark must try to get his powers back to save humanity.<br /><br />This version definitely blows Richard Lester's version out of the water! This movie was originally filmed back to back with \\"Superman\\", Richard Donner was the true director behind it. Unfortunately the studios felt like they needed to rewrite some scenes and sequences with Richard Lester taking Donner's place as he was fired. I love how after years of fan requests and rumors, Warner Brothers finally had the guts to receive Donner's brilliant version back as the way it was meant to be seen with never before seen footage, alternate opening and ending credits with Donner's name, newly enhanced visual effects, and lost footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El. If your a fan of comic book movies and superhero flicks, then i suggest you seek out this version cause it's worth the wait and find.<br /><br />This DVD has excellent picture and sound quality to a remarkable director's cut with some good extras like audio commentary, a featurette on the history of the film's troubled production, and deleted scenes. A Must have for Superman fans and comic book fans alike!
B000001GBJ|5.0|I bought this cd because my yoga teacher uses the piece entitled \\"Pastorate\\" for when we do the 1/2 Sun salute; it is such a peaceful piece of music, uplifting and kind.  In fact, I play the cd each morning and evening: morning, to wake up gently; evening, to go to back to sleep peacefully.
B0018AK9RK|4.0|I will start off by saying this is a<br />very good release just short of<br />being a great CD, but kudos to the<br />Priest for an ambitious effort. I<br />think the best way to appreciate<br />this is in the headphone mix,<br />(preferrably at night) not really a<br />car CD. Listen to all the subtle<br />nuances that you miss in regular<br />stereo play. Very dense with great instrumentation. This CD unfolds<br />like a great drama. I think the<br />performances are stellar even<br />though it doesn't have a ton of<br />uptempo tracks it still rocks with<br />the slow-mid tempos. The concept,<br />melodies,and lyrics are very well<br />written. The light passages give<br />this CD balance. I think some of<br />the Priest fans that didn't like<br />it may have different expectations<br />and probaby would like it if another<br />band name were on it. It really<br />stands apart from everyone<br />else in its vision and is great<br />in that respect. Unfolds like a<br />great rock opera and will be<br />amazing live. Give the Judas<br />Priest the respect of several<br />listens, it becomes infections.<br />The best conceptual CD since<br />Operation Mindcrime.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|Batman directed by Tim Burton is a cool and classic action adventure. Jack Nicholson is perfectly cast as the Joker, his laugh is wickedly memorable. Kim Basinger is great as well, too bad she's always being typecast. I love Michael Keaton as Batman, he's funny, suspicious, and fits the role to a T. Buy this 1989 blockbuster today!
B0017KP93U|4.0|Radiohead's album \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" are among my all-time favourite albums, and as I have never actually owned any of the albums personally, I thought this two CDs compilation could be a good way to get to appreciate some of the later tracks more. When \\"Kid A\\" was released in 2000 was very disappointed, and more or less lost interest in the band. I still don't understand how both \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\" can be assessed in line with \\"The Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\".<br /><br />CD one is really sheer pleasure; very nice to hear the songs in a different running order. \\"Creep\\" and \\"There There\\" blend nicely with the great songs from my two favourite albums.<br /><br />CD two is a different story with more focus on the later  albums, and at the end of the day I realise that I probably  should have bought the original albums instead, after all.<br /><br />Another disappointment was that my favourite non-album track \\"How Can You Be Sure\\" was not included on the the compilation - in fact CD 2 would have been a real treat if more of the finest B-sides were included<br /><br />For casual fans of the melodic side of Radiohead, the single-CD version of the compilation is still very recommendable.
B00180R06I|5.0|Just when I think Criterion has forgotten us fans of horror & sci-fi, here they come with this incredible deluxe treatment of one of the all-time greats.  Carl Dreyer's VAMPYR may have been overshadowed by Murnau's NOSFERATU and Tod Browning's DRACULA (and rightfully so, in many ways), but it's still one of the greatest examples of film-as-nightmare ever made.<br /><br />For those who may have missed it, VAMPYR loosely (VERY loosely...more on that in a minute) adapts the Victorian-era horror tale \\"Carmilla,\\" which featured a pair of scheming female vampires.  But the film only uses bits of the novella to flesh-out its nightmare vision.  The film's minimal plot concerns a man, Alan Gray, who is studying the occult.  In a village outside of Paris, he stumbles upon a mystery steeped in the supernatural.  A host of increasingly bizarre images assail Gray (and the viewer), culminating in one of the most memorable nightmare sequences ever put on film.<br /><br />VAMPYR, especially for the first-time viewer, can be a difficult film to embrace.  Dialogue is kept to a minimum, and when it does occur, is often puzzling.  The narrative is disjointed, resulting in sometimes abrupt cuts and images which don't seem to fit.  Most disconcerting is a shot of a gravedigger which has been reversed, or the shadow of a solider which seeks to rejoin its host.  All these scenes and many more give the film its nightmare logic, which is all the more memorable for what it DOESN'T show.<br /><br />For all their technical wizardry, I've almost always found Criterion Collection discs left me wanting more in the way of supplemental materials.  Well, with VAMPYR. . .all is forgiven!  Disc 2 offers a fascinating \\"visual essay\\" which recounts director Carl Dreyer's influences that helped shaped the film.  There's also a 1966 documentary on Dreyer himself, covering his first silent films up to his final effort in 1964.  There's some great archival footage of Francois Truffaut and others offering their insight into the director and his films.  Back on Disc 1, you'll find a rather droll audio commentary by British film scholar Tony Rayns.  While his observations do occasionally help make some of Dreyer's creative intentions more clear, Rayns spends too much time engaged in idle speculation over such trivia as the proper pronunciation of \\"Carmilla\\" author Sheridan Le Fanu's name.<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough, VAMPYR also includes a nice full-sized book that contains not only the original screenplay, but the entire text of \\"Carmilla.\\"  Reading them back-to-back, one can easily see how Dreyer was influenced but not really guided by the original story.  Lastly, a booklet includes additional essays about the film and its resoration.<br /><br />Simply put, anyone interested in classic horror, or the history of early sound films MUST have this terrific set in their collection.  Criterion is to be commended for pulling out all the stops and crafting what I'm sure will prove to be a treasured archive of an often-overlooked piece of film history.ir insight into the director and his films.

1585673927|5.0|Wodehouse is perhaps the best antidote I know for depression.  His novels are literally unreal, for Bertie inhabits a world of leisure, servants, and privilege, an Edenic world where even the threat of pain, suffering, and mortality have no place, and Jeeves is always there as a deus ex machina.  But ultimately we return to Wodehouse (again and again!) because of the language--quite simply, the man cannot write a bad sentence.
B0018OAPAW|3.0|But this CD is a little too serious and ...well...calm for my taste.  \\"Stuff is messed up\\" is classic fun Offspring and most songs are pretty good but I can't say any of them have really stuck with me yet.
140130916X|1.0|The author is clearly writing beyond her scope of life experience or research.  The supposed 30-year-old main character is pathetic and unsympathetic, even considering the circumstances of plot.    A knack for the visual is apparent, which probably translates well on film, but the excessively true-to-life dialog includes much pointless small talk that does nothing to further the story.    I had high hopes for the concept, but it's mired in superfluous fluff.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|This CD was recommended to me by a friend into the U.K. music scene and I have no doubt American music lovers will embrace this songstress if they have any sense at all. Adele's precise, yet rough-edged voice is what makes the songs come to life. In particular, her cover of \\"Make you feel my love\\" is gorgeous and \\"Chasing Pavements\\" showcases her unique sound to a tee. The CD as a whole is timeless. I'd definitely recommend trying to snag the limited edition that includes another disc with live versions of songs.
B0013K8IFU|5.0|I'd heard nothing but good things about this Aphex Twin album, and it met all expectations. The songs are faultness, brilliantly made, and highly inspirational. For example, \\"Tha\\" is a lengthy song with little changes, but it never ceases to be interesting and relaxing. \\"Xtal\\" is one of the greatest pieces of music i've EVER heard...it just makes me so happy. There couldn't possibly be any improvements to this album because it's perfect. Everyone should own this, and noone has a good excuse not to. Put this at the top of your list of \\"things to buy\\"!
9686769013|1.0|Very... but very bad edition... if this books costs me 1 cent I would feel swindled.<br />Don't get me wrong, this Hermann Hesse book is good, the bad here is the edition. I think I'll use this for my BBQ.<br /><br />Update: Curious to see how those 5 stats reviews doesn't show the users purchased the book. They are paid reviews for sure.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|Having not seen this movie for a number of years it was refreshing to find that it still packs a punch.  Gary Oldman in one of his better roles as the 'baddie' and an excellant performance by Natalie Portman.  The opening 'Hit' where Leon imerges from, and then disappers into the showdows is still to be surpassed.  Well worth a look - if you can find it!!
0743243153|5.0|I'm not one of those people who stalk the aisles of the self help section at all.  But when someone lent me this book seven years ago, it was a turning point in my life.  I've since bought my own copy of all three books in the series and have found it necessary to go back and read them from time to time (especially the first and third books).    When I first started reading this book I couldn't fathom that the brand of spirituality that Peck offers was even possible.  I had discarded all spirituality since childhood because I had learned early on about the hoorors of religion.  More than anything, this book spurred me to start along the path to discovering my own sense of spirituality and my own life philosophy.  It also helped me to think in more complex terms and beocme more comfortable with ambiguity and contradiction...reality essentially.      This book should make you uncomfortable when you read it for the first time.  You have to be uncomfortable to evolve.  I am grateful for having come across it at a relatively young age because my life has been better for having read it.
B001B71NOI|4.0|4.5 Stars<br /><br />For the first fifteen years of NIN's inception, fans would have to wait patiently, five or six years to hear new music. It was just a fact of life that it took forever for Trent Reznor to record and release a new album...in the past few years; however, the opposite is now true.<br /><br />Including Saul William's \\"The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of Niggy Tardust!\\" (which Reznor helped write and produce) and \\"Year Zero Remixed,\\" (both 2007) Nine Inch Nails new album \\"The Slip\\" (2008) is the sixth album Trent Reznor has released in the past three years. Sobriety and (as of last year) being free of a major label have certainly been agreeable to Mr. Reznor.<br /><br />\\"The Slip\\" (Halo 27) is not what one might have expected after the grand, dysphoric \\"Year Zero\\" with its' Public Enemy beats and songs concerning what a hell the United States will look like in 15 years. \\"The Slip,\\" by contrast is probably the earthiest, rawest, most spontaneous album Reznor has released. Since only a few weeks were spent writing and a few more spent recording this album, one can see why. Luckily, however, the album manages not to sound rushed or sloppy. It seems that Reznor got the ball rolling, went with it, and didn't over think anything. Guitarist Robin Finck, keyboardist Alessandro Cortini and drummer Josh Freese also made contributions to the album.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Year Zero,\\" no time is spent contemplating the state of the world. This probably works for the best, as two albums in a short period of time concerning how bad things could get in the U.S. might be overkill. Rather, like most NIN albums, \\"The Slip\\" is personally reflective--although at 43, Reznor's lyrics seem to be a little more refined.<br /><br />As the album begins, one is lured into a false sense of calmness with the short, low-key opening \\"999,999\\" before being thrust into the pounding \\"1,000,000.\\" Noisy, loud and intense, this track makes for an ideal opener. The momentum doesn't let up with the equally forceful \\"Letting You,\\" whose sort of peculiar, off-key chorus is where its strength lies.<br /><br />\\"Discipline,\\" the album's first single, might at first seem like a rehash of \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" (from \\"With Teeth\\") but after a few listens it is clear that this song is superior. The groove here is just undeniable. \\"I need your discipline, I need your help...you know once I start I cannot help myself\\" Reznor proclaims, possibly fearful that he might one day fall off the wagon--or otherwise lose control.<br /><br />The almost claustrophobic \\"Echoplex,\\" another outstanding song, has a sort of hypnotic feel. Laid-back, this song kind of grabs hold of you without you even noticing. The somewhat disparaging \\"Head Down\\" is a little reminiscent of the bizarre (yet awesome) \\"Vessel\\" from \\"Year Zero.\\" The melodic chorus kind of comes as a surprise.<br /><br />Maybe one of Reznor's most heart-felt songs, \\"Lights in the Sky\\" is the album's strongest gem. Stripped down, this piano composition is deeply melancholy--although Reznor isn't bemoaning himself--rather this song seems to be directed at someone whom he cares deeply about, stating:<br /><br />Watching you drown<br />I'll follow you down<br />And I am here right beside you<br />The lights in the sky<br />Have finally arrived<br />I am staying right beside you<br /><br />The rest of the album is mostly all instrumental work. Following \\"Lights in the Sky\\" we are led to \\"Corona Radiata.\\" Over seven minutes in length and minimalistic, one might think it would get a bit monotonous--but it never does, staying intriguing until the very end. The subtle, haunting guitar work leaves a lasting impression. A little noisier and a little more intense \\"The Four of us are Dying\\" is no less memorable.<br /><br />Reznor seems to say that he's about to lose it in the hectic closing \\"Demon Seed.\\" This one may take a few listens to really get into--but it's definitely very cool and a good way to conclude the album.<br /><br/>The accompanying DVD featuring the band rehearsing \\"1,000,000,\\" \\"Letting You,\\" \\"Discipline,\\" \\"Echoplex\\" and \\"Head Down\\" is very cool and will definitely be of interest to fans of the album.oplex\\" and \\"Head Down\\" is very cool and will definitely be of interest to fans of the album.
B000002HIK|4.0|After hearing a lot about Aphex Twin and doing a bit of research, i went out and bought this album fairly cheap. I got home, and the first track \\"Acrid Avid Jam Shred\\" comes on with subtle distortion and a drum beat. After a minute or so, the synths kick in and i immediately see what i'm in for; much to my approval.    The album consists of repeatative hardcore breakbeats, accompanied by some calming chords and melodies occasionaly, and like out of nowhere these breakbeats start getting fiddled around with. To be honest, i wasn't sure what i was meant to make of it at first. I kept expecting more sounds to kick in over the beats, but they didn't...and after a while i realized i like it this way.     The album doesn't at all sound the same though...if you're not convinced yet, then do realize there are some very mellow composed songs on here (which fit in well) and nearly sums up Aphex Twin's capability to create a huge range of very different sounding songs.    For a newcomer to Aphex Twin (or perhaps this type of genre even), get this first and see what you think.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|The story starts with Jason Statham running a auto sales and service business. He obviously owes money since two goons show up and start taking crow bars to cars. It doesn't take much convincing from an old girlfriend that he should get in on a bank heist she is planning. We know going into that one of the robbers has a hidden agenda for one of the safety deposit boxes, but the twists and turns thrown in along the preparation and robbery of the bank create some unforseen tension even after the job.<br /><br />Afterall several of the boxes contained damning material for criminals and high government officials alike. Statham and the rest the cast do a fine job of keeping your interest in the characters and what happens to them. Good acting with a taut story makes \\"The Bank Job\\" work.This movie is based on a true story and so it makes it even more interesting to note the shake-up it causes in the police department, MI-5, and the government. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch \\"The Italian Job\\", \\"Snatch\\" and \\"Inside Man\\". - C. Luster
B00006J9OT|5.0|This has to be the very best concert Diana has done.  All of the music is absolutly great!
0765348276|5.0|I was very pleased to find this well written and well thought out book! It was, as several other reviewers pointed out, very reminiscent of Heinlein's writing style and plot lines but is good enough to put Scalzi firmly in my list of favorite authors.<br /><br />No spoilers or plot reviews from me on this book (others have already covered these in-depth), but I will say that the story flowed very smoothly and kept me engaged the whole way through.<br /><br />One word of caution, this book does contain \\"Adult\\" themes (sex, death, war, etc) handled in a casual manner. Not for the very young (R).<br /><br />If you like the \\"classic\\" feel Sci-Fi, this one is recommended for you!<br /><br />CFH
B0010358CG|5.0|I purchased this blu-ray a while ago and never watched it till last weekend. And I have to say I am really impressed. The quality is amazing and in FullHD it is a real eyecatch. That is what High Definition stands for.     I enjoyed watching this flick. But as I am not that huge anime expert / fan I cannot tell you if this fits in the Appleseed Universe.     I do not regret buying this disc. But I think rental would have done it as well.....

B001CXW8CW|5.0|the movie was amazing ive seen it twice on the big screen cant wait to see it on blu-ray
0790731894|4.0|This is a very ironic movie, it came out only 5 years before the 9/11 attacks. its plot is very similar in a way to what happened on that day, or what could have been done to prevent the incident. Sure enough the movie is fiction, most of what is seen would work up to a certain point. Either way the movie is a great effort at demonstrating what could be done in a time of crisis.<br /><br />A commercial airline is taken over by Islamic extremist; the main terrorist is Nagi Hassan, at first it seem that his demands is that the U.S. must release a man named Jaffa or they will suffer the consequences. But an analyst named Dr. Grant (Kurt Russell) believes different, his belief is that Hassan doesn't really want Jaffa's release; instead Grant believes the plane is carrying DZ-5 (an extremely dangerous explosive) and that he will detonate the plane killing millions of Americans.<br /><br />Grant, Colonel Travis (Steven Seagal) and a group of trained soldiers are planning now to take control of the plane with a special stealth plane that can attach to its commercial airliner. At first when I heard there plan it didn't feel realistic, but they do it just right, making it quite believable.<br /><br />For Seagal fans like me, let me tell you that this is not a Seagal movie. This is a Kurt Russell movie. Seagal is in the movie for tops 20 minutes. It seems that Seagal had some issues with the producers and his role was minimized. Funny though you can tell in some instances that Seagal doesn't want to be in it; he does give a good supporting role but we have seen better. Anyhow the movie is fantastic, a bit dated in some areas, but overall good. The major problem I have is with the DVD, it's horrible, the picture quality is crappy; Warner needs to re-release this remastered<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 4 OUT OF 5
B0012909NQ|5.0|I have been looking around for this DVD for few weeks, but I found it's overpriced at most websites or unavailable. After some investigating, I found that its some kind of Wal-Mart exclusive and the sites and stores offering it, like here and Best Buy are offering the product through back channels at an inflated price. So today I took a road trip top Wally World and picked up a copy for the regular price about twenty clams. Now on to the content, packaging and concert itself.<br /><br />Very nice special 3 set DVD with a beautiful photo book and one of the DVD's is a documentary. I have to say Genesis always had great packaging for their products. This package screams quality. So I figured the concert sounds and camera work would be quality also. I was not disappointed; the sound track had DTS,DD 5.1 as well as 2.0 and has selection of languages. The set list is impressive, if missing some of the older stuff they shy away from. Every track has an icon that comes up at the start of it, which allows you to access extra content. Great sound, very clear DTS is the best track if you have a Theater that can accommodate it. The others tracks are fine though. The camera work is perfect and shows all players evenly. Genesis is in top form for this show, Phil sounds still young and hits all the notes well. Everyone else is spot on. I have to admit to being a Peter Gabriel snob. I found PG era to be amazing, even so I was impressed here. This is modern era Genesis at it's best, even all these years later.<br /><br />Any Genesis fan should pick this set up, its well worth it, if you can find it at the normal price. I'm glad I made the trip to get it. I know you will be too. I won't bore you with the set list you can just look  up here or elsewhere. I will say if your a Genesis fan at all this might be the last great DVD they release. Don't miss it.
B0013J9KOO|4.0|Hellboy is at it again, saving humankind from supernatural threats that only a handful have even heard of. This time, it starts with an ancient truce between the mundane and magical worlds. We mortals seem to have memories as short as our lives, and have violated the truce. The rulers of the faerie see honor in holding up their end of the pact, no matter what. Others in that land want back what was once theirs ...<br /><br />The effect-meisters have risen to a very high level in this one, populating the world next to ours with a spectacular assortment of beings and a rats' nest of medieval alleyways for them to live in. A few things lack explanation - do most marketplaces have a working ore-crusher conveniently installed in the wall? No matter, it looks good, and comic books (even on the big screen) are at least as much about looks as story and characters.<br /><br />Which is good. Some of the dialog remains a bit comic-booky, rattled bureaucratic functionaries lack depth, and the love interest[s] suit the fanboy generation better than more grownup tastes. The humorous moments save these flaws from becoming ponderous, though. BTW, Liz (hot babe that she is) springs some great sequel-bait on us at the end. So, on the whole, HB2 comes across as what it is: a comic book movie, not the finest of its genre, but a well-done piece of summer entertainment.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release
B000UBMWG4|5.0|It was for me absolutely fantastic to see again this classic with the visual enhancements of Blu-ray. The 5 disc edition really gives a definitive dimension of this mark in cinema history. The futuristic dark environment of this great movie with the superb Vangelis music and the quality of a 1080p image give the fans no chance but to buy this edition.    Pedro Maia

B0015519VS|4.0|Usher becomes the victim of his own success on this album. If Jaheim or Raheem DeVaughn or Dwele had released the exact same album, it would have been a classic, but not for Usher. Instead, he comes off as a former superstar, trendsetter who's gone soft. This, for me, is not a bad thing because I can relate to this Usher better having been married 2yrs ago myself.<br /><br />Songs like \\"Appetite\\", \\"Before I Met You\\" & \\"Here I Stand\\" are real/relevant to me and they stand out as my favourites. The 1st single \\"Love In This Club\\" and its remix are also brilliant but unfortunately also misleading as they do not define what the rest of the album is about. Other tracks that play on the sex theme like \\"Trading Places\\" & \\"This Ain't Sex\\" fall flat.<br /><br />Unfortunately for Usher is the fact since he's been gone the R&B scene has evolved. An evolution lead by the European sounds of StarGate & the Jodeci'esque sounds of Tricky & The Dream. Acts like Ne-Yo, J-Holiday, Chris Brown etc. have had a few years doing it so it does not sound fresh when Usher tries it on. \\"What's You Name\\" with Will.I.Am for example is excellent but it sounds like every other song on Ne-Yo's last album. Similarly, the power ballad and 2nd single \\"Moving Mountains\\" may be on class of its own lyrically but the overall package sounds generic.<br /><br />Usher does redeem himself on the all too short intro and interlude tracks. These are beautiful tracks that really put his pipes on display, the extra slow \\"Love you Gently\\" is another beautiful addition. But I suppose people aren't ready to hear Usher on slow jams and that explains the reception that this album has had.<br /><br />I applaud Usher for taking a stand on this album, even if the rest of the world may choose not to stand with him

1401216676|4.0|There are far too many people out there clamoring about this book.  Why?  Because there is a new Batman film in theaters.  Admittingly, this is one of the Joker's finest moments, albeit darkest.  And yes, it is one of the greatest Batman books ever.<br /><br />That being said, it is very short.  The story itself is only 46 pages.  The extras aren't really that good.  I liked Brian Bolland's re-coloring of his Batman: Black and White piece, but otherwise, they are pretty corny.  Not enough to buy the hardcover.  The re-coloring of the story itself is nice and gives it a cleaner, more up-to-date look, but the original coloring gave it more of a gritty feeling.<br /><br />This is one of the best Batman books, and definitely is The Joker's finest moment.  It is Joker at his darkly funniest, and most malicious.  Perhaps short of killing Jason Todd, this is the sickest the Joker has ever been.  The origin story pushes the point of the \\"One bad day\\" that the Joker is trying to convey.  Not totally necessary, but cool.<br /><br />Alan Moore's weakest work, but it is Alan Moore, who is greater than any other writer in his sleep.  You really cannot go wrong.  This book is a must for any Batman fan, and for a easy look at the mentality of the Joker, pick it up.
0887306667|3.0|Reading the 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing is a lot like eating a Twinkie. It's light and yummy, with no pesky nutrition to slow you down. An enjoyable and easy read, but not much substance. There are some principles presented here that are indeed central to the field of marketing - the Law of the Mind and the Law of Resources to name two. And you wouldn't want to be the marketer who hasn't read Ries and Trout. But this is just a taste of marketing. You'll need to read more to get a full meal.
B000XG5J0M|5.0|The narrator, John Lee is superb - I know I wouldn't enjoy it as much reading it - the dialects make the story come alive, I wish it would last forever!  It really is worth every penny, a little more than a dollar an hour to be so splendidly entertained!
B000LPQ6DE|2.0|Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books, one I still read regularly.  After having seen the Timothy Dalton version and finding myself frustrated (and laughing) at how melodramatically he plays the part of Rochester, I set out to find a better version.  I thought I had found it in this one.  Everyone seemed to love it.  After having struggled through it, I can tell you that there is not some creative license, there is A LOT of creative license.  As for the \\"heaving bodices\\" promised on the DVD art, the only bodice heaving was mine as I shouted out my frustration yet again at the screen.      What I can say nice about this film is that I loved the choice of performers.  I felt that I could really see Rochester and Jane (and Georgie, Lucy in the Chronicles of Narnia) did great!  I also loved to see some of the scenes/characters the Dalton version took out put back in.    What I did not like about this film:    1.  The pacing.  I didn't mind the rush through Jane's childhood and Lowood experience because it gave us enough to understand.  But later, they left themselves entirely too little room to properly finish the story (about an hour from the time she leaves Thornfield to the end of the story).      2.  Rewrites of what, to me, are pivotal scenes and I mean complete rewrites.  Not even trying to be faithful to the original story.  Sorry folks, but Rochester never once steps foot into Jane's room.  Ugh!!  And that wasn't the only important scene they mucked up.    3.  Language.  Frankly, there was no reason they had to rewrite pretty much every line of dialogue from the book.  And they did.  There was exactly 1 line that I caught verbatim in the movie.  Oh, they got bits and pieces put in, but the line would invariably start or end wrong.  The language was also modernized and so lost a lot of its lyrical, almost poetic quality, especially Rochester's lines.    4.  Civility.  I hate to say it, but a great deal of the terse characterization was lost in translation.  Rochester isn't nearly as dictatorial and fierce.  Blanche is actually polite to Jane.  What?!  This is the 1800s, not exactly an egalitarian society here, folks.      As a movie, it isn't bad.  If I had never read the book, I probably would have enjoyed it more.  Unfortunately, they changed a lot and then added insult to injury by changing inconsequential things which made no difference to the plotline, for example St. John goes to India in the book but Africa in the movie.  I fail to understand why such a detail just had to be changed.      In the end, it was just too much change.  I couldn't enjoy it despite the addition (missing in the Dalton version) of several scenes that I felt were important.
0060751967|4.0|Wow!  Just yesterday I posted a review of \\"High Stakes\\" a tale of a human girl who meets and falls in love with a rich vampire.  Although the story claimed to be laugh out loud funny, it wasn't.  Imagine my delight when I dove straight into \\"How to Marry A Millionaire Vampire\\" to find out it had a similar plot with a much better drawn plot and characters. I thought for sure that this was going to be another vampire chick lit story but it was so much more!  Shanna is a dentist in the Witness Protection Program after testifying in court against Russian mob members who have killed her friend.  They are still after her and during an attack on her dental clinic, Roman shows up and rescues her.  Roman is a weathly scientist vampire.  He has formulated and produced a synthetic blood that has saved millions of human lives.  During a recent product 'testing' he lost one of his fangs.  If he doesn't want to be permanently lopsided, he must convice his dentist on the lam to fix his tooth.  This story has so much adventure that it is hard for me to classify it simply as a Paranormal Romance.  The romance, while definitely there, supplements rather than overwhelms this story.  There are several sex scenes and actually that was a scene or two more than I need in my books, but I really feel like I witnessed the love grown between the two characters. (Another point seriously lacking in the previous book I mentioned).  One thing that seems to make or break a book for me is the cast of supporting characters.  I adored most of these characters.  Roman's cast of security guards, the Highlanders are an absolute delight.  They brought humor to the story as well as a special sensitivity.  Roman's harem was another fun side bar to the story, and brought out a lot of Shanna's insecurities.  This book is certainly not laughable chick lit, but I admit to one scene in particular that did have me actually laugh out loud!  Only because a five for me is AMAZING do I give this book a super well deserved four.  This little gem is better than similar series such as the before mentioned \\"Vegas Vampires\\" and Lyndsay Sand's Argeneau vampire romances. I can't believe I almost missed this one, I had it on my wish list for ages before I stumbled upon a copy and picked it up.  I encourage you not to wait as long as I did.  This is a seriously fun winner.served four.  This little gem is better than similar series such as the before mentioned \\"Vegas Vampires\\" and Lyndsay Sand's Argeneau vampire romances.

B0017I1FP8|5.0|The list of adjectives could go on and on to describe this movie score. The Joker's theme is haunting and disturbing, yet very interesting and complex. (It seems strange to call it complex because of the famous 2-note motif, but in reality, the track \\"Why so Serious\\" requires many listens to fully grasp it.) Highly recommended!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|At first it was strange to get accustomed to the \\"new\\" cold play, but after a few listens, it is there best work yet.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|As with Batman Begins, if you're looking for something reminiscent of Danny Elfman's Batman suite, this is not the score for you. If, however, you appreciated Howard's and Zimmer's first collaboration, this will absolutely not disappoint. I *love* this soundtrack. The themes are darker, more intricate, and like the movie, much more intense. It fits the mood of the film perfectly. And the Joker suite truly is one of the most creative character themes out there. There could be no better music for Nolan's reinvented Batman franchise. Highly recommended.
0792163710|5.0|This is a believable, exciting story. The scenery is beautiful and the movie is just well-done all the way around. Alan Ladd, Jack Palance, Ben Johnson and the rest are outstanding. A gunslinger who is trying to make a new start in life thinks he's escaping to a peaceful area. Then he discovers that conflict is there too. He does his best to avoid involvement, but realizes that he is the only one who can defend the defenseless. He eventually embraces his role as a sheepdog of sorts and goes to battle the wolves. American Indians are only mentioned in passing when a character brags about a Cheyenne arrowhead that's still stuck in his shoulder from when he was one of the first settlers in the territory. I highly recommend.
B0018RBN8C|3.0|I must admit I had never heard of Duffy until I saw the album art for Rockferry on the iTunes Store. I thought, \\"Wow, she looks kinda pretty,\\" and decided to at least listen to some 30-second previews. I guess basing whether I will give an artist a shot based on their looks makes me shallow, but in this case it worked. I could tell instantly that Duffy can sing, and can sing quite well. I purchased the album, and while it's not going to be something I listen to a whole lot, Duffy is a great singer, and I'm sure it will get some playing on my iPod. I usually listen to The Strokes, The White Stripes, Vampire Weekend, and Daft Punk. I think the fact that I don't really like this genre, but I like this album, is impressive. Duff's talent makes this album worth buying, no matter what your usual musical tastes are.
B0007ZEBI0|5.0|Let me start by saying that this album is one of my favorite albums of all time (even though I'm biased because almost all Porcupine Tree albums are my favorites).  It has perfect flow from start to finish, easily going between heavy and soft--many times within the same song.  The music  is hard to describe as they contain influences of a number of different bands, including: Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, Talk Talk, Opeth, etc.. all culminating into a unique sound of their own.    The surround mix is incredible and it even won an award for best surround mix of 2005.  The sonic clarity over cd is also impressive.  Separation between channels is very good but also very well connected as instruments flow between different speakers to very good effect--take the title track Deadwing's soft interlude with it's circling delayed guitar for example, or even the \\"dancing\\" maracas in Arriving Somewhere but not Here.  The soundstage is very open and containing space instead of feeling flat and constrained.  Overall, everything to do with the sound is very very good.    If you have a surround sound setup at least capable of DTS, and especially if you have DVD-Audio capabilities, then you should already own this along with their album In Absentia.  Great albums for showing off your surround.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Amazing production that gets the history right.  Acting, costumes, scenery, extras are all terrific.  I enjoyed the extra about the making of the series and the interview with John McCulloch.  The ability to watch each episode on successive nights was great.  Glad I bought it.
B001AW9DKK|2.0|Been here done this 10000 times before.  I love CSNY and would rate them now as I have for the past 25+ years as one of my three favorite bands of all time (along with Zep and Floyd).  Their studio and live (officially released and otherwise) albums of the late 60's to the mid 70's were outstanding and relevent and creative.  But lets face it folks, since the LONG awaited reunion album American Dream came out, CSNY have been nothing short of a disappointment.  They as a group (Neil's music as a solo artist is still listenable to this day) should for the good of mankind, disperse and never come back again.  The last listenable album that CSN/CSNY produced was Daylight Again, since then the horse has been so beaten to death that theres nothing left to club but dust!  Come on guys, I hope you don't actually need the money that bad.  I mean, how many versions of Teach Your Children does humanity actually require?  For that matter, how many greatest hits albums can one band release?  What does CSN/Y have now, 5 greatest hits albums/complilations/box sets?  Please stop already, your embarrissing yourselves, boring the heck out of us and relentlessly tarnishing your once Godlike stature.  Enough is enough.
B00005JPY0|5.0|If there's one movie that will make you cry, laugh, have you on the edge of the seat, and disturb you, it is The Dark Knight. The movie definitely had LOTS of action as well as great drama. And I've seen ALL Batman movies, but this surpasses all the other Batman movies in every aspect. I won't go into any plot details, because the plot is a big part of the movie, but I'll say this: Ledger's performance is fantastic, the best performance I've ever seen in a movie. This is one I can see multiple times. Although it is rated PG here, this is definitely NOT for kids here. Some scenes are very dark, and some are very disturbing, but that's a good thing. All in all, The Dark Knight is a dark and melancholy masterpiece filled with action and great acting too.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|In defense of the TV show, Miami Vice was cutting edge in the time period that it came out in. Even though it might be considered corny by today's standards, it was a good show. Miami Vice the movie is not good movie at all. Michael Mann's Heat is one of my favorite flicks of the past and Collateral turned out to be one of 2005's best surprises but here he falls flat. Miami Vice looks good visually but the movie moves at an old man's pace. It never goes beyond the tale of two cops Crockett(Colin Farrell) and Tubbs(Jamie Foxx) who go deep undercover to bust a drug ring. Crockett gets into an uninteresting relationship with Gong Li's character(whose name I forgot) and ends up getting them into trouble with the buyer. YAWN. There is no chemistry between Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell's character and they both look bored out of their skulls. Not only is there no chemistry between Jamie and Colin, there is also no chemistry between Gong Li's character(whose accent makes it hard to understand her) and Colin Farrell's character. They not only have a bland relationship with each other but they have the most boring sex you will ever see on screen. Hell, Morticia and Gomez of the Addams Family have more chemistry than these two. Both Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell deliver their lines in a deep voice that makes them sound as ridiculous as a teenage guy trying to impress a girl by talking in a deep tone plus did I mention that is almost no action in this movie. This movie is billed as an action flick but action rarely happens. Most of the time Miami Vice the movie is a dull drama with limited action sequences. In short if you're a fan of the TV show the movie is named after you wont like this one. At least Miami Vice was exciting. This movie is about as dull as wheat bread.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This is a heartfelt love story with good music, amazing scenery in Ireland and Gerard Butler, Harry Connick, Jr., and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. This movie has pretty much everything a girl (at least this girl) could want.  The friendships between the women are realistic - they get mad at each other and then work it out.  The parent/child relationships are complicated - also realistic.  I highly recommend this movie.

B00104QSOM|5.0|This is, hands down, without a doubt, one of the strangest damn movies I have ever seen. Unsettling and weird and wonderful and fantastic.    The plot is simple: a man, Daniel Plainview, steamrollers over everyone and everything in his path in order to get oil, and thereby, money and power. There's a great many comparisons that can be made between this character and Charles Foster Kane (and if you haven't seen [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], do so), the primary difference being that Kane at least was somewhat likable. The best you can say for Plainview is that he is, at times, pitiable.    Mostly the movie is a character study, pitting Plainview against a young preacher, Eli Sunday. His church is called The Church of the Third Revelation, which if you're a smart-a$$ like me tells you everything you need to know about who he is and what he does. Suffice to say that in modern times he'd have big hair, a bad suit and the ability to cry/plead for money on cue whenever a TV camera is on him.    It's very hard to describe this movie beyond what I've said, at least as far as the plot goes. The cinematography is mind-blowing and the music is... well, effective. There's a weird sound that plays over the soundtrack from time to time. It sounds rather like an air-raide siren if you only played out the first note of it and then didn't stop.    It is one of the most memorable and effective films I've ever seen. It's very hard to watch at times, but entirely worth it, if for no other reason than Daniel Day-Lewis' performance.    One last note: whomever thought this was a good idea for DVD packaging needs to be smacked, cause it totally isn't. Green, yes, but very stupid. Some sort of plastic to at least hold the discs in place would've been nice, but, oh, well.
B0010X745K|3.0|Not the best movie.  Could have been a little shorter, and has a disturbing ending that is not for the weak or sensitive.  Not actually too bad otherwise, but the ending is still bothering me the next day...
B00140PK6O|5.0|The BBC has truly outdone itself with the wonderful production of \\"Cranford\\".  The triumverate of Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, and Imelda Staunton makes the series a sheer force of cinematic strength.  All three of these leading lights prove incandescent, but their luminous brilliance does not vie for favor--rather, each actress perfectly coplements the other.    Nor is the skill limited to this trio.  The supporting cast is also well-matched, with legends Michael Gambon and Francesca Annis lending their assistance, as well as Simon Woods (whom I recognized from \\"Rome\\"), the lovely Lesley Manville (\\"The Cazalets\\", \\"North & South\\"--the 2nd being another Mrs. Gaskell adaptation), and the darling Claudie Blakely (\\"Gosford Park\\", as well as 2005's \\"Pride & Prejudice\\"), to name but a few.    Purists may squirm that this film is not a verbatim reproduction of Elizabeth Gaskell's novel of the same name, but incorporates much of that book's plotline while adding in those of two other books by her, namely, \\"Mr. Harrison's Confessions\\" and \\"My Lady Ludlow\\".  I found the result to be thoroughly enjoyable.    Cranford's society is dominated by a cadre of thoroughly proper ladies, domineered by the righteous Miss Deborah Jenkyns (Atkins).  Her sister, Miss Mathilda (popularly known as Matty) Jenkyns, is softer-hearted; while Deborah is generally unyielding and stern, her sense of compassion and duty does ingratiate her character to the audience eventually.  Miss Pole (Staunton) is easily the grande-dame of the village's gossip circuit and her near-hysterical antics in making certain she is \\"THE FIRST\\" to pass along juicy tidbits makes for several laugh-out-loud incidents.      While often light-hearted and amusing, \\"Cranford\\" does address more sobering issues, such as the rigorous class structure's inherent refusal to allow a person to better himself.  This is best played out by Lady Ludlow's (Annis) disgust at learning her head clerk, Mr. Carter, has taught young Harry Gregson (the son of a local squatter/poacher) to read and write.  Literacy, according to Lady Ludlow, is a privilege solely reserved for the upper classes; if the lower orders were to attain it, they would not remember their place.      The imminent arrival of the railway in Cranford is another focal point of the storyline.  The majority of the village's citizenry loathe the idea and are terrified of the great changes it will surely herald for them all.  Romances, demises, losses of fortune, family squabbles, the bleaching of lace collars, and the manner in which to consume an orange with the greatest degree of propriety [quite seriously--and the results are most amusing!]:  \\"Cranford\\" affords all this and much more, and will assuredly leave the viewer with gleeful smile and a full heart.
B000URDEB0|5.0|People should just get over the fact that they fired Tarja and move on. They didn't want another operatic singer and I respect that. Olzon has an excellent voice and I love what she's done on \\"Dark Passion Play\\". Nightwish are in fine form here. Every song is an experience and Olzon draws me in with every one. I love this album and I'm sure if people get past the \\"she'll never be Tarja\\" complex then they'd enjoy the album a whole lot more. I love Tarja's voice as much as the next Nightwish fan but accept that it's a new time for the band. If you just don't like what the bend has done here that's fine but this brilliance shouldn't be denied because of  an affinity for Tarja. This album gets the full 5 stars from me.
B00000JXVK|3.0|I found this movie/documentary to be rather sophmoric and goofy, but worth watching anyway. Some motorcycle magazine editors feel they have to mention this, \\"EPIC\\", tale in their respective publications every month, raving about how wonderful it is and how much it influenced their lives. I just don't see it. I grew up in the 60\\"s and 70\\"s and have been riding motorcycles for 39 years. I certainly didn't need Bruce Brown to tell me to.
1577314808|1.0|Don't know what Oprah is thinking about the ability of the author's words to inspire. I found it practically unreadable but laced here and there with some truthful generalities. I'd say Eckhardt Tolle has found a self-help formula that chooses gibbberish words from columns A and B that sells books. I purchased the book to take on  a trip.  Unable to stay with it, I even tried moving forward and finally gave up.
B0010358CG|3.0|I second many of the reviews here in recommending the high definition version of the film.  The visuals are simply amazing.  The detail is crisp, and the animation is fluid.  Out of all the high definition films I've seen this one impressed me the most with its visual clarity.    The story content of the film is disappointing when compared to the first film or the graphic novels.  The story, while more complex than the previous movie, is poorly paced and far too predictable.  The plot seems to be more of an excuse to string together the fantasticly over-the-top John Woo action scenes.      Perhaps my expectations were too high.  Based on Masemune Shirow's other works, such as Ghost in the Shell and the earlier Appleseed stories, I expected a much deeper and well organized story.      This is a fantastic film to demonstrate the power of HD, but don't expect a huge emotional payoff when the story's over.
B00005JKCH|5.0|Tobey McGuire stars as an ordinary Peter Parker who happens to be a high school nerd. He also happens to have a major crush on a classmate Mary Jane. One day on a field trip his class goes to a laboratory with genetic engineered \\"superspiders\\". As he's taking photographs of Mary Jane a \\"superspider\\" slides down the ceiling and bites Peter. He starts to feel sick and then goes to sleep. He doesn't wake up the same man he was when he fell asleep. From then on he becomes Spider-Man. The web-slinging life saving Spider-Man. Unfortunately, as always, there's a villain in town. There's where the Green Goblin comes in. Then Spiderman has to fight a battle between good and evil.    I have never seen any of the Spider-Man comics. In fact, I'm not even a big fan of the cartoons. However, after just seeing the first movie, I wanted more and more of Spiderman. The Spiderman costume for is classic. His abilities are even better:clinging to walls, spraying webs of string from his hand, better jumping capabilities, more strength, faster reflexes, and the special Spidey Sense--which allows Peter to forsee things that are coming at him or coming for him.     All of the scenes take place in New York City. During the film, there's a lot of good animation. Spider-Man swinging from building to building requires effects. I was very impressed with all of the effects. If you have seen the comics or just want to tryout a superhero film, I recommend Spider-Man.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|If you are a fan of System of a Down, you know what kind of music they churn out. If not, they are often considered alternative. Today that word could mean anything. There is a mix of metal, screamo, and twisted lyrics that create their music. Most of the time, this works very well.    This CD features a lot of anti-war music. They do it in a way that's just not talking bad about the United States though, they do it through decent music. Not all the songs are anti-war though. So if you are looking for just some good music without the message, it has that as well.    The CD however featured far too many filler songs. Some songs like B.Y.O.B. and Sad Statue were great, while other songs just seemed like something they threw in to fill up space. I would suggest listening to [[ASIN:B000021YQV Toxicity]] or [[ASIN:B000BM6AVA Hypnotize]] if you want a more complete System of a Down experience.
B000MRAAJW|3.0|I purchased this product thinking it would work with our HDTV not knowing I needed a HD DVD, and that it is not compatible with BlueRay either.  Probably my fault, but very disappointed.
0930289234|5.0|This book is amazing.  I cannot see why it is not more popular.  I hope the movie is great.
B00006IU73|5.0|At the time this was released (2002), my general impression of In Absentia was that it was pretty heavy, but not overwhelmingly so.  What I like the most about this album (and band for that matter) is the emotional sophistication of the music - in combination with their solid musicianship it makes for a very rich listening experience.<br /><br />Musically, the band is very tight and the trademark Porcupine Tree blend of haunting and sad minor chords, fine vocals, atmospheric synthesizer parts and heaviness works very well.  I especially liked the fact that they had moved on from the slightly lighter and \\"poppier\\" sound of Lightbulb Sun (2000) - In Absentia is a very dark album overall.  Although all of the tracks are very enjoyable, my favorite is the sad piece entitled Heart Attack in a Layby.<br /><br />With respect to instrumentation, I enjoy the synthesizer textures that Richard uses - they are mainly used to simulate strings and are used as a sustained backdrop rather than a melody line.  The mellotron (samples?) are also quite nice. Steve's guitar textures/timbres include delicate acoustic sections, clean tones on an electric, and a thunderous, \\"crunchy\\" tone on the electric.  Overall, the contrast of the light and the heavy is quite nice and was a hallmark of the best progressive rock from the 1970s.  It is also worth noting that In Absentia features new drummer Gavin Harrison for the first time on a PT studio album - I find his overall technical approach to be very similar to the previous drummer (that is a good thing by the way).<br /><br />This is a great album by a very interesting post-progressive band that continues to create exciting music. For those folks interested in the bands earlier, more ambient works, excellent examples include The Sky Moves Sideways (1995) and Signify (1996).
B000B2YQX4|4.0|'Playing the Angel' is a welcome return by Depeche Mode. The songwriting and direction is stronger than it has been in quite a few years. Dave Gahan's contributions with his co-writing partners are definitely highlights. The relevance of DM today cannot be compared with their cutting edge existence in the 80s including Violator. Many younger artists have taken the band's baton and run with it creating such a plethora of imitators, so you can be forgiven if DM today sounds like \\"we've heard it all before\\". But these guys have been such electronic-pop warriors, expanding the appeal of the genre for close to 30 years.     This album adds to their initial vision begun decades back. I believe 'Playing the Angel' is superb. It cannot resemble earlier masterpieces without Alan Wilder, but it certainly has brought the band back into being a significant unit again. 'The Darkest Star' is my personal fave, 'Lilian' is a gorgeous slice of Depeche Mode '80s version, upgraded. Try it!
B000WIHSD2|5.0|This album is mixed so nicely, giving it a real old-school rock sound, and the LP definitely brings that out.<br /><br />Plus, there's a bonus song not included on the CD.
B000OCY7JE|5.0|Susan Bier's film \\"After the Wedding\\" is the first of her work I've seen.  It is breathtaking.  I'm so glad it was nominated for an Oscar, although I wonder why a flock of other international nominations did not also occur.  Mads Mikkelsen who gained recognition as the villain in the James Bond film [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale (2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]], does a good job with a tightly controlled performance as Jacob Peterson.  Peterson works in an orphanage in India and then must fly back to his home country of Denmark to seek funds.  Mikkelsen's good looks and powerful spats with Helene show him to be an actor with depth and range.  Rolf Lassgard's Jorgan is well played with a powerful scene toward the end of the film.  Jogan's wife Helene is played by Sidse Babette Knudsen who does an excellent job, making believable the woman in this situation.  Christian Tafdrup plays Christian, the groom at the wedding.  His good looks make him a good choice; and he shows his colors early on, which rapidly flare into his newlywed estrangement.  Stine Fischer Christensen plays Anna, the daughter who must adjust to several paternal adjustments as well as a marital one.  Neeral Mulchandani is charming as Pamrod who has been raised by Jacob in India.  The film sparkles, constantly moving and developing the story until it reaches its conclusion.  We have a sense of where life will go for all of the characters.  I found this a breathtaking family drama, well worth seeking.  Bravo!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I have long been an Adams fan since watching the PBS series The Adams Chronicles in the 70's. The books by Joseph Ellis (Founding Brothers, Passionate Sage, American Sphinx, and At the Creation) served to further deepen my esteem and appreciation for our second President, warts and all.  The HBO mini-series John Adams is an outstanding portrayal and interpretation of David McCullough novel, bring John, his wife Abigail, and the times in which they lived and struggled vividly to life.
B00139XZF4|4.0|Despite some of the whining from those who really must have a hard time deciding what a good movie consists of, this is a damn good movie.  It has good acting, quickening plot, tons of action and top notch CGI. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief, just like any other fantasy epic, but once you do you are treated to a very intricate story with subtle, thought provoking undertones that carry the author's intentions admirably to the screen.   So, if you want to rub your nose in the stupid, violence for violence sake crap that dominates the industry and wins awards because those who vote are sadly as dumb as those who pay money to watch, then go sit in front of \\"no country for old men\\".  If, however, you would care to exercise your mind and delight your eyes and ears then get this movie, relax, and watch an excellent adventure.
B00004W510|5.0|This one is my favorite of all their earlier albums. They were totally different as a live act. I was fortunate enough to see them in their Prime in the early Seventies. I really don't care about the arguments whether Big Pink was better. Just enjoy them both.  My favorite bit of trivia about the Brown Album. Someone else mentioned this in another review. It was recorded in Hollywood, CA in Sammy Davis JR's pool house. I can just picture Sammy Tap Dancin' to Rag Mama Rag.
B000I5XOVE|3.0|First of all, I love this movie. The first two Leathal Weapon movies are so good. It is so much fun to watch the two very different main characters work together. The movie is a bit dated, but not much, and it is wonderful to see it again, I haven't seen it in over 15 years.  Now for the Blu-ray itself. I can't say that I am impressed at all. If I was to rate just the picture I would give it two stars. I use a 40' Sony KDL-40W2000, a Denon AVR-2803 and a PS3, such equipment isn't exactly high end. There are very clear evidence of the picture being encoded in 1080i (interlaced) and not progressive. There are so many times that I can clearly see empty line in between the lines in the picture. An example is the scene in the grocery store when Riggs meets miss van den Haas and they are standing at each end of the fruit stand. I could very clearly see lines in the price tags. Another example is the end credits sequence where the letters were very edgy. There are so many other example of this.   The sound, though, is quite good, for a late 80s movie. I thought, though, that the sound on the first Leathal Weapon on Blu-ray was a tad better.   So despite of the picture I will keep it, since I don't have it in any other format. But if you have the movie on DVD I would wait and hope for a better version to come out on Blu-ray.
0634049011|5.0|This book is, as the title suggests, a workbook. You study, complete excersizes, practice. It connects bits of theory and helps you understand how all the elements of the fretboard work together, from tuning to scales to complicated chords. This book teaches what I have been trying to learn for ages- how to \\"navigate\\" the fretboard. Because of this book, I can identify any note on the fretboard, or create scales up and down the neck without getting lost (which is the key to soloing). If you follow the instructions and use this book the way it's intended, you will actually understand music theory on the guitar in a very practical way. I cannot overstate the importance of the knowledge this book will help you gain. You will have plenty of \\"AHA!\\" moments when you work on some excersizes and then realize how vital the knowledge is that you just gained. This book is superb and will improve your playing and understanding, guaranteed!
1592289444|5.0|This book has been thoroughly reviewed on Amazon already.  I add this review in the hopes on contributing something to the discussion.    This is the story of Slavomir Rawicz, a Polish cadet who was arrested by the Soviets on false charges and sentenced to prison in Siberia for 25 years, and of his amazing escape south, across 4,000 miles past Lake Baikal, through Mongolia, across the Gobi Desert, over the Himalayas, and finally into British India.  The book is engaging, extremely well-written, heart-breaking and inspiring.      The problem is that it may not be true.  I agree with other commenters that the book loses all of its value as an inspirational story if it was fabricated.  My five-star review assumes that it is true.    Critics of the book can rely on two types of evidence: internal and external.  (I reject objections that such a journey is impossible.  Modern adventurers have retraced Rawicz' steps; granted, they were much better equipped, but they also weren't fleeing for their lives).    The external evidence shows that Rawicz was released from prison and sent back to Poland; that the British (probably) have no record of Rawicz or his companions arriving from the Tibetan plateau; that no one has ever located or identified his companions.  The first objection can be met by pointing out that the Soviet Cheka was not necessarily above forging documents, especially if necessary to avoid a humiliating admission that seven prisoners escaped.  The second objection is undermined by the history of the book's criticisms -- for years, people pointed out that the Soviets had no record of Rawicz' imprisonment at all.  The discovery of his papers is a dramatic illustration that the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.      The final point is simply a mystery.  One would expect that Rawicz's companions would try to contact him after the book was published.  But that assumes his companions survived long enough to do so -- they arrived in India in 1942, and the book was not published until 1956.  It is possible they died, or returned to their homes in communist countries and never saw the book, or were imprisoned again.  Of course, all we can do is speculate.      For me, the more interesting question concerns the internal evidence.  Is Rawicz' description of a Soviet prison camp consistent with actual practice?  When Rawicz crossed the border into Mongolia, he described a series of signs marking the border -- is his description accurate?  He describes the clothing, houses and certain material culture in Mongolia, China and Tibet -- is it consistent with local practice at that time?    Adventurer Peter Fleming supposedly challenged the internal evidence as unrealistic shortly after the book was published, but I have not found a copy of Fleming's specific charges, so I cannot evaluate them.  In addition, according to a wikipedia article on Rawicz, Fleming supposedly discovered military records that contradicted Rawicz' claims.  One must wonder why Fleming would bother with such external evidence if he thought the case against the internal evidence was so clear.
B000VNMS4W|5.0|Juan Luis Guerra is steadily earning recognition as a major artist who transcends the meringue and salsa music he plays so well and creates universally beautiful and joyful music for a world audience. This collection of his love songs is a great introduction to his work. These are artfully written songs with profound lyrics, and you can dance to most of them. What else can you say? For one thing,he writes about deep, spiritual love, not just sex, and he doesn't seem to have a sour note or mean bone in his body. For English speakers, this is also a good way to improve your Spanish and learn some colorful Dominican terms for birds, voodo charms, herbs, tropical trees and other lovely things.
B000SZLSB2|4.0|First time listener of James Blunt and I loved this CD (but I love Britpop).  Very catchy tunes, fun and good from one track to the next.  I am tempted but buy his previous release.    Best Tracks are: \\"1973\\", \\"Same Mistake\\", \\"Carry You Home\\" and \\"Annie\\".    I'm very happy with this purchase and look forward to his next offering.
B0019EXZYE|4.0|Among other features, the disc includes a mini-documentary, \\"The Baker Street Bank Raid\\", on the real life bank robbery.  The documentary includes photos and audio (in the movie the crooks end up having their radio transmissions recorded by a ham radio operator) from the actual bank robbery.  It's fascinating to see and hear details of the actual robbery in relation to the movie.  A great movie with great special features makes this a Blu-Ray worth owning.
B000024KBA|5.0|i first bought this on cassette back in the nineties when i was getting introduced to some of pink floyd's pre darkside of the moon material. i actually like this better than quite a few floyd discs. it has a lot of great songs, \\"no good trying\\", \\"octopus\\", \\"long gone\\", \\"love you\\", \\"dark globe\\", \\"here i go\\" , \\"terrapin\\", \\"late night\\". 'madcap' is also better than the subsequent barrett albums that were released (1970's barrett album and the rarities collection from '88 opel)
0321356683|5.0|You may think you don't need any books after you've learned a language.  Usually, that is true - but this book is one of the few that will benefit even experienced programmers.  It provides usage guidelines that go well beyond style or obvious things and will help you build systems that are flexible, maintainable, and perform well.  The second edition is updated for Java 6 so you get advice on the best practices for using generics, enums, and annotations.  This is a great either as a refresher course or to learn new things for anyone who wants to be a great Java programmer.
1594489505|4.0|I found it to be a heartbreaking book - an eye opening book as well.  The fact that the book is set in recent years made it more heartbreaking as well as realistic.  It was hard for me to read the parts where Rasheed abused the women.  It angered me greatly.<br /><br />I think the book was quite stark and harsh - yet honest.  I'm glad I read it.  We, here in the US, know nothing of the sort of things portrayed in the book and it was hard to put myself in that place.  It also made me think of my freedom and how there is no one to control me, no one to tell me I must cover myself in a burqua.  I find it unimaginable to have to live that way.<br /><br />I didn't close the book with a \\"feel-good\\" air.  I closed the book and sighed.  I think many would benefit from reading the book - it lets you know that there is very much more to this world than yourself and that you should count your blessings every day.  It also lets you know that your life can change in an instant and that the world you think you should have isn't necessarily the world you'll get.<br /><br />-Gatlianne
B000KFCJAY|1.0|simple to use,but it does not work.After your first try seems like its working,but once you release the trigger ,the suction that brings the sand to the tip of the gun ,will suck water back and get mixed with the sand,this in turn will make the sand pack ,and make it solid ,plugging the hose and you will not get any more sand to come thru.Cleaning the whole thing its a pain,and the next time it will do the same.Good idea but should have been troubleshooted before it was put on the market.Dont waste your money this item doesn't work.
B000002J1L|5.0|Nursery Cryme is admittedly not on the level of the following albums Foxtrot and Selling England by the Pound, yet I have found that over the decades that I listen to It as much as those that followed. I find that its rawness holds an attraction to me that makes me appreciate it as much as later albums. Hackett and Collins are terrific additions (even though I am a big fan of Ant). I think too many reviewers feel that they can't give this 5 stars because other albums by Genesis are better. But then when I find myself giving 5 stars to Pink Floyd, Porcupine Tree, VDGG or Anthony Phillips.... hmm... I begin to understand how truly awesome Genesis is and particularly this album. So yes, 5 stars! If you like prog, you will love this album - over and over.
B00001ZSVG|3.0|This is one of the first ever live recordings of Fleetwood Mac, back when they were mainly the blues, along with Cream, Alexis Korner, early Black Sabbath, and John Mayall (Mac is basically a Bluesbreakers spinoff). It was a different animal from the lineup you can now hear on the oldies station. This album is mainly blues covers, including one of Elmore James, an early influence on Peter Green. Some of these were never done in the studio by the band, so this is one for the hardcore fans.<br />The sound quality is not all that great, like the others said, but this was forty years ago, and they also probably didn't have a large budget for what would be hi-tech for that day. Maybe this was recorded for release but maybe Blue Horizon didn't think they were ready for their own live release (though they shared a couple with other blues acts).<br />This album has been reissued a number of times, with different covers and names, and is usually a budget item like this. This is more of a gray area release. It's not a bootleg, yet it's apparently not an official release either approved by the band.
0452289963|5.0|I avoided reading this book at first, thinking it would just be more of the same, on the heels of The Power of Now. Then clients in my therapy practice started quoting it. Eckhart's talk about the ego seems to help men, in particular, to find a language that is comfortable for them in grappling with life issues. Then the book was handed to me by a friend who was passing them out at a birthday dinner. I really loved reading it. I enjoyed reading a few pages a day, and letting it sink in. It has been critiqued as a repackaging of ancient wisdom which we've all heard already from other sources. I agree with that idea to a point. Another perspective I have is that it is ancient wisdom in a fresh package. It was quite a joy to read. It is a true gift, and I am glad that Oprah is promoting it.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Loads of great action and a few very nifty special effects.<br />*Cinematography is as good as the previous film, if not better.  It's definately darker and more dramatic.<br />*Production quality is still great, and introduces a number of great new gadgets, vehicles, costumes, and settings to the saga.<br />*Storyline, although more complex, is great.  Expect good amounts of drama, action, a bit of romance, and a bit of comedy.<br />*Characters are great.  The genesis for both the Catwoman and Penguin are very dramatic, and they grow into very interesting enemies.  Good acting all around.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Still a bit goofy; possibly goofier than the last film (but still enjoyable).<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Heightened violence and some innuendo makes it a little inappropriate for young kids (rated PG-13).<br /><br />For the longest time, this was my favorite Batman film (until \\"Batman Begins\\" and the \\"Dark Knight\\" came out).  It still appeals to me, for it is very intense, emotionally dramatic, and has some great action in it.  The acting is great, and the characters are quite memorable.  It's definately worthwhile for all Batman fans, or superhero fans in general.<br /><br />The one-disc version had okay video and sound quality and no special features.  The two-disc version has good quality, and includes some featurettes and music videos.
1582701709|5.0|Loved this book...  great life examples.  Teaches you how to view life in an optimistic way and in turn get the things you really want.  I highly recommend.
B00005JPY0|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent action scenes.  Much bigger and more impressive than the previous film \\"Batman Begins.\\"<br />*Still an excellent filming style.<br />*Production design is excellent still (the BatPod was cool).<br />*Storyline is extremely intense! From start to finish, it's one big thing after another.  A vast number of twists and turns puts the audience on a truly turbulent emotional roller-coaster ride (it's almost too cruel!).<br />*Characters continue to shine with complexity.  The film explores more intruiging issues with Batman's character.  As you've probably already heard, the Joker was downright awesome; he ranged from being funny to dramatic, but was always sadistic and wicked.  Harvey Dent (Two-Face) was a good serious character too.<br />*Good music (but not as memorable as the last film).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Sorry for the spoilers, but the ending is quite bleak.  Rachel is dead, Batman becomes public enemy number one, Lucious Fox resigns...(but this could all be a good set-up for another movie).<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Much more violent than ever before.  It's more intense this way, but also much bleaker.<br />*Choppy filming/editing still makes the fight scenes a little hard to see (but it's stylish and intense, too).<br />*The storyline doesn't deal with any megalomaniac plots like all of the other Batman films (like in the last film, where the bad guys wanted to make everybody crazy and let the city destroy itself); this one is almost entirely about city politics and rampant crime/terrorism.  It's more believable and interesting this way, but I kind of miss the old-fashioned schemes.<br /><br />It's darker, bigger, more intense, more exciting, and more ambitious than \\"Batman Begins.\\" It almost outdoes itself (and some people think it has).  But it still retains the same style and characterizations of the previous film, and therefore, is still a deep, complex, moving film.  The only big weakness is simply that it is a little too bleak (especially with its ending).  But it is still high-quality storytelling.  Everybody who enjoyed the last film (and Batman fans in general) should enjoy this one too.it is still high-quality storytelling.  Everybody who enjoyed the last film (and Batman fans in general) should enjoy this one too.
B000286RNY|4.0|Saw part of this on TV, and wanted to watch the other half. The special FX are corny as all get out, but that makes it funnier. It's a typical HEA storyline, but a good one  worth watching at least once or twice.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Some good action scenes, especially at the end.<br />*Very solid cinematography.  Seems very fresh and original.  Quite a few strong images.<br />*Pretty dark and moody, but not overwhelmingly so.<br />*Production design is completely awesome.  Gotham City is very imaginatively designed.  The Batmobile is still probably the best in this film.  The Batwing is cool.  There are loads of nifty gadgets, cool costumes, and good sets.<br />*Storyline is not too bad.  Lots of memorable scenes.  Has a good amount of drama, romance, action, and snippets of comedy.<br />*Characters are good and well-acted.  Michael Keaton is cool.  Jack Nicholson makes a good, funny, somewhat menacing Joker.<br />*Music score is good, and there are a few good late 80s songs in there (lots of Prince!).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Seems a bit long or slow in the first hour or so.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*Some parts are a little goofy (but it's not too bad in this case).<br /><br />Even though the newer Batman films are stronger in a lot of ways, this version is still quite original and entertaining.  It has good characters, a pretty good story, and some excellent production designs throughout.  The ending has a lot of great action too.  Definately reccomended for anybody who is interested in comic-book heroes.<br /><br />The one-disc version has okay image and sound quality, and no special features.  The two-disc version has good quality and a number of featurettes.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This isn't so much a music CD as it is a Story told with music; so there is prose mixed in with verse. The album concept is different than anything I've heard before, but the music isn't so much, if that makes sense. Pray for me, Tomorrow, Girl with golden eyes, Life is Beautiful, and Courtesy Call are favorites of mine.

1400031354|5.0|This was the first book in this series that I have read.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The plot is exciting but relaxing to enjoy, and there are so many subplots that make it truly fun.  The gentle, eye-opening descriptions of a truer Africa were fascinating to me.  I heartily recommend this book!

B00005JPY0|5.0|Marvel has kept above DC in the movie department for years now, well, probably the comics too in the opinions of many, but as far as movies go, its tough to beat out Spiderman, X-Men and even the brilliant Iron Man and Hulk remake.  DC beat out all of those with Dark Knight, and easily I must add.  While Batman Begins was one of the best comic book films I had seen (though on par with some of the forementioned Marvel movies), this is easily the best.<br /><br />I had never gone into a movie with such high expectations, and that scared me.  I honestly went in thinking I was going to see one of the best films of my life (outside of the comic book movie realm), and I did not come out seeing the best film of my life, but yes, one of the best.  Was I even watching a comic book movie, cause it sure didn't feel like it. This film takes itself so seriously and does it so well.  I have never been in a 2-1/2 hour movie that was paced so well and just got better and more exciting as it went on.  No one could ever predict everything that was going to happen there were so many twists and surprises along the way.  The actors were impressive, some more than others, and the characters they represent are astonishing.  Of course we knew Heath Ledgers performance of the Joker was going to be Oscar worthy - and it is with ease.  But even Eric Roberts (a big time B-movie star) even pulled off some ok acting in this one.  I must say Christian Bale's performance was fine, but not show-stealing and was a little buried in the part, but only cause he had some great competition.<br /><br />Aside from Ledger's performance, the story might be the best thing going for this film.  It is very complex, and I'm just not sure I got it all in, definetly one of those movie I'd want to watch more than once to fit things together better each time.  Seriously though, the story and theme alone can compete with some of the best dramas out there.  In fact, I'd say there wasn't as much action as I expected but it was not missed and/or needed.  But speaking of action, it was done so well.  There is never an overabundance, only what is really necessary, yet at the same time it is huge.  This includes scenes with the Tumbler and Bat-Pod that I am referring to.  As far as fights go, there are a few and nothing flashy nor lengthy, but yet again, not really missed or needed.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Batman villains, of course you are in for a treat with the Joker played by Heath Ledger.  The current argument is \\"Is he better than Jack Nicholson's Joker?\\"  Honestly they are both quite different and really shouldn't be compared, but I do believe this Joker made a much much bigger impact in the film, not just because of great acting, but the kind of Joker he is and what he accomplishes.  But, if you thought Joker wasn't enough &lt;&lt;&lt;SPOILER BEGIN>>> Harvey \\"Two Face\\" Dent makes an appearance and gets more screen time as the villain than I expected.

I would certainly watch this one over and over again, and yes mainly to see and study Heath Ledger's excellent performance.  The world has truly lost a very blessed and gifted actor, and no doubt he needs to be recognized for a nomy.

B000TNF7OC|5.0|This is the first record that really showed the potential that UFO had and provided some of the classics that I still listen to today.  With Michael Schenker on lead guitar they can be truly awesome.  While their first few albums were OK they were much more progressive rock than the hard rock they are known for, and this is the first time you really see that.  Love this album!
B000XUHVY0|3.0|After Forever is another female fronted group, who joins the ranks of Nightwish, Epica, etc.    This is the first album I've listened to of theirs, and honestly, I was not all that impressed.  Nothing really blew me away.  However, there are some pros and cons, IMO about this album and group, in general.    The album starts off with a bang; the first 4 tracks are very, very solid.  Energize is a fun, hooky song, and honestly, probably the best song on the album.  Discord is good too, and I'm not a fan of growling, but he growls understandablely, not like Behomoth where you will need a lyrics sheet or a translator.    After the initial barrage of quality music and songs, I find the album lacking.  I hear alot of rehashed music, nothing new.  For instance, De-Energize has an opening that sounds like metallica's One, just not nearly as good.  A few songs I swear they were going to go into a storyteller mode and start talking about gnomes or dwarfs, heavy rhapsody influence in some of it.    The vocals are good, the women's voice can be very overpowering, especially through headphones, and the music itself is pushed back.  Whereas, nightwish, other the other hand, the vocals are more pushed back while the music seems to take center stage.    Overall though, for the 9 bucks I paid, is not terrible, but I would have expected more.  Nothing on this album really screams out at me.
0061537934|5.0|Okay, this may sound strange to those who have never had a close bond with a dog, but my dog, Bowie, who died in December 2007, led me to this book. I was searching for some kind of 'sign' from him to let me know he was 'okay' and that it really had been time to let him go (he was old and suffering from severe arthritis and hip dysplasia so he was put to sleep). I received a review about this book written by a book club I am part of. I was hesitant to read because I wasn't sure if I could 'handle' reading about a dog while grieving for one. First chapter is Enzo the dog trying to figure out how to let his owner know he's old, arthritic, and ready to die. Wow, what a healing I received from this book. The story goes through Enzo's life and that it was a happy one, but also of Enzo looking forward to death as the chance to 'race in the rain'. I firmly believe Bowie gave me the sign I was looking for but it doesn't mean I don't still miss him.
1434623246|5.0|When I started reading this work I found that it was very difficult to get through much at once.  The book is very dense and packed with insightful examples.<br /><br />However, Sapir illustrates points quite well.  In it he discusses phonetic theories, concepts of drift, syntax and word structure, how language and culture are related, and the like.  There are few more comprehensive introductions to the field today, and fewer introductions still which go into the level of depth that he does.  Highly recommended.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Viva La Vida grabs you from the opening chords. Chris Martin and company have outdone themselves. This group appeals to any age group (it knows no limits). As a child of the 60's, I love their way with lyrics and music. I am a Coldplay fan and really love this new CD.

B0012Q732O|3.0|This movie was pure nonthinking entertainment.  No PC-ness.  Just a movie.    I would watch this movie before I'd watch one that won an Academy Award.    If you liked the cheesey, old, black and white Tazan movies and are willing to check your brain at the door, this movie is for you.    If you expect nothing you will be pleasantly surprized.  The CG are very good and don't overwelm the plot.  The best CG scenes are in the trailer.  The trailer doesn't represent the actual (simple) plot.  All and all, is was good for a night of entertainment.  Don't invite your snooty, wine-drinking friends over to watch this movie.  Watch this movie with your 10 - 14 year old boys.  They will love it.    There were monsters and violence but no gore.    No sex, No nudity.  The plot was extremely simple.  But it's just entertainment.

0743298039|5.0|I'm not a hype reader, so I didn't pick up this book until May of 2008, long after it had been hyped and written about all over the web.  However I was drawn in by the subject matter (a booklover and writer who is asked to write the biography of a very well known and successful, yet mysteriously private, author).<br /><br />The style is gothic--similar to a Bronte novel, and so it reads as old-fashioned.  There is something of a ghost story, and there is a definitely a suspenseful unraveling of the facts.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.  It lives up to the hype.

But the best is having it wireless.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Batman is back. And so is director Christoperh Nolan who directed the amazing [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins]]. As someone who thoroughly enjoyed Nolan's previous Batman film, I felt confident he'd never be able to surpass it. I was horribly wrong.<br /><br />The dark sets. The amazing acting (with one exception). The wonderful dialogue. It was a sheer joy to watch. And the fact that it was 152 minutes long didn't bother me in the slightest. The action was practically nonstop with enough plot twists, explosions, and funny lines to make one cringe and laugh at the same time.<br /><br />The big question, though, on many people's minds (including my own before I watched it) was \\"Is Heath Ledger's performance that good or are the critics just being nice after Ledger's unfortunate death?\\" Hollywood has a history of doing stuff like this where they honor someone for an achievement that really wasn't deserved, but they felt sorry for the performer's family, etc. and decided to throw them a bone by overly-praising a performance or a life that wasn't particularly notable. I was concerned that this might be the case for Ledger's Joker. But my worries were immediately stripped away as soon as The Joker made his appearance. Creepy. Funny. Line delivery that'll blow your mind (\\"See, I'm not a monster...I'm just ahead of the curve.\\"). Ledger's performance put all others in his shadow (yes that includes Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Aaron Eckhart and Gary Oldman).<br /><br />Christian Bale ([[ASIN:B000XRO3MQ 3:10 to Yuma]]) has now become synonymous with what Batman means to movie-goers and comic book fans alike. He plays the cocky, rich, and uncompromising Bruce Wayne with the perfect amount of grace and toughness the role deserves. The only downside is his heavily whispered Batman voice that grates on the nerves after a short while.<br /><br />Michael Caine ([[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men]]) and Gary Oldman ([[ASIN:B000W7414C Harry Potter]]) reprise their roles and do so with the talent we've all come to expect from these two fine actors. Morgan Freeman ([[ASIN:B0010ZR160 Gone Baby Gone]]) returns as Lucius Fox, Batman's weapons designer and conscious. Although not particularly riveting, his performance did help move the plot along.<br /><br />An addition to the cast was introduced with the arrival of Harvey Dent/Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart, [[ASIN:B000JJ5G4W Conversations With Other Women]]). Exquisitely incorporated into the story, the uncovering of Two-Face's origins is masterfully pulled into the story and given ample screen time.<br /><br />The only less-than-stellar performance came from Maggie Gyllenhaal ([[ASIN:B000LXH0AE Stranger Than Fiction]]) who replaced Katie Holmes ([[ASIN:B0006GAOCW First Daughter]]) in the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's love interest. Although no fan of Katie Holmes, I found Gyllenhaal's performance to be relatively unmoving in comparison to the rest of the cast. That's probably not a knock against Gyllenhaal considering the entire production held some of the strongest roles I've seen this year. But no one came close to Ledger and his wonderful performance, least of all Gyllenhaal.<br /><br />If you're looking for the action film of the year with one of the best performances by an actor that is no longer with us, The Dark Knight is the ticket.

B00007KWHN|4.0|There is very little to complain about on Rhino's reissue of The Yes Album; the remastering is done well, and is nice and clear. However, I do have to fault Yes and Eddie Offord for fading out nearly every track on the album. Nothing sounds complete, and the epic nature of the songs demands resolution. A good buy, but get Keys To Ascension as well if you want to hear Starship Trooper as it was meant to be.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|As I watched THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM I kept thinking to myself, \\"Haven't I seen this before?\\" and then I realized I essentially had but it was done better in THE BOURNE SUPREMECY.  This film is passably entertaining with lots of action, okay acting, and a somewhat silly storyline with a lot of coincidence and far-fetched crap thrown in. What really ruined it for me is the ever pervading moving, hand-held, shaky camera technique. What is it with film-makers and their dependency on this gimmickery style? An action film should not have to rely on shaky camera and fast pans to create an illusion of action. The car chases in the first two films were far more exciting and innovative.  In the ULTIMATUM the car chases were marred by dizzying camera-work and editing that detracted greatly from the action. Perhaps the creators of these types of works are cutting corners on the budget by substituting real action with the illusion of action created by camera work. Or maybe they are just trying to be edgy. For goodness sake, film-makers--enough with the dizzying cinematography and let the edginess come from the story, the acting, and real stunts and action.
B00005JKJA|5.0|It's hard for me to explain how much of an impact this film had on me. It is one of the most dreamlike experiences that I have ever had in a theatre. The first two hours of the film seem to follow a narrative -- and then there are the last 40 minutes, which will just blow you away if you have never seen this film before. After repeated viewings, I think that I have my own interpretation. The beauty of this film is that you can attach your own ideas to it, thus involving you in what goes down on the screen. It's laced with both horror and mystery, and filled to the brim with dream logic.     Totally captivating and beautiful to look at, this is a true work of art. The best time to view this film would be late in the evening, with the curtains drawn, in the dark. It's frightening, to be sure, but entirely worth it!     For the parents out there, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under the age of 17. There are scenes of explicit sexuality throughout the film.     RECOMMENDED!
B00025ETIW|5.0|I heard The Black Parade for at least a year, always complaining extensively about it, then suddenly realized how great it was. It was sudden and completely unexpected. I guess I just had to get used to the very dark and somewhat violent lyrics. But I have to say, now My Chemical Romance is one of my favorite bands ever. I heard about Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and got it since I was such a great (if late) fan of the other CD. At first I wasn't that impressed. But by the second time over I heard it, I was already convinced it could compete with The Black Parade. However, I don't think I would recognize it immediately as My Chemical Romance as based on their other CD. For one thing, on average, it's a much heavier CD, (for example, here you don't have any songs like Cancer, with just piano, or Disenchanted, with soft guitar and a little drums). There's no piano here and all the songs are obviously love songs, which wasn't true for the other CD. The rather jazzy undertone from TBP is absent here. Besides, Gerard's voice is very different. At the beggining of Cementery Drive I thought it was a woman singing. And, well, not much in the matter of music, he looks completely different. All songs have more or less the same structure and if I have to point out a weak point is that the last thrird of every song is like they're just filling in some more time by repeating parts over again and adding some unnecesary instrumentations. Still, all the songs are excellent, although I don't particularly get the Interlude (although it's just 57 seconds). Also, I don't think sensitive people should read the lyrics, because they're a \\"little\\" violent.  All things considered, it's still the best sound I've heard in a long time, not since their other CD and Evanescence. I recommend it. They deserve every bit of their five stars.
6304712936|5.0|I recently watched AMADEUS for the second time and was amazed by what a perfect film it is.  Totally historically accurate to the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart?  No, but the script faithfully follows the basic facts of his life and death with a heavy dose of speculation.  Tom Hulce is simply wonderful as Mozart and he believably creates a vulgar, annoying (who can forget that awful laugh?)often socially clueless little man who still fulfills the meaning of his second name \\"Amadeus\\" in being beloved by God at least in terms of musical talent.  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as Austrian Emperor Joseph's, court composer, Salieri.  Salieri possessed social skills, musical talent and training, burning ambition and at least in the beginning piousness.  It seems plausible that Salieri's realization of himself as a mediocre composer compared to the musically great though often bizarre Mozart could have driven him to obsession and madness.  The costumes and interior furnishings in the film are beautiful and the Prague filming location which stands in for Vienna fully creates the atmosphere of an 18th century European city.  Though Hulce and Abraham are the obvious acting standouts the rest of the film is very well cast.  I'm no music scholar but Mozart's music which comprises the score seems to be perfectly presented.  And the scenes from his operas are so well recreated in the original 18th century manner that they alone are reason enough to watch the film.  Yet the rich universal themes are the biggest strengths of AMADEUS.  It is a movie that can be enjoyed by those who think they hate classical music or films with historical settings.
B00133KDM8|5.0|The best revenge is great songs and a great voice! Tarja takes her love of classical music and incorporates it seamlessly into a rock/metal album that is a great start for her solo career. All fans of Tarja's amazing voice should get this! It's hard to pick a favorite on this, I love I Walk Alone, My Little Phoenix, Die Alive, Damned and Divine and Ciaran's Well. However there are also some slower songs on here that people might gripe about: Lost Northern Star, The Reign, Boy and the Ghost, Sing for Me, Our Great Divide, Minor Heaven, and Calling Grace. But Tarja's voice is so hauntingly beautiful to me, brings tears to my eyes, and not just a studio creation: watch her youtube clips or the Nightwish DVDs! That's the type of singer I dig: one who can back it up live. For me she's the best living singer on the planet period! I did not like the NuNightwish album, but I loved My Winter Storm, Tarja really showed them!
0380807343|2.0|Flat, flat, flat.<br /><br />I chose Coraline as my first Neil Gaiman book ever. I expected much more than I received. Although I'm aware it's written for children, the whole thing was not at all magical or addicting or complex, I felt as though I read the entire story waiting for something to happen, and in the end, I was left unsatisfied.<br /><br />My biggest beef with Coraline is the lack of appeal of any of the characters. Coraline herself seems like she *could* be interesting (with her choices of green gloves, orange boots), but we're never given the chance to really get to know any in-depth traits about her. All the other characters--the weird neighbors, the other parents, the cat--come off as annoying and unfriendly. They're just so grossly underdeveloped.  The most potential was lost by the short addition of the three other children. It could've gone somewhere.  It never did.  I don't know those kids, because I was never properly introduced through characterization or plot development.  So in the end, I just didn't care.<br /><br />When a writer writes, he should have a reason for every line he includes, every character, every character trait, and every piece of dialogue.  This story left so much unexplained.  Too much of it was pointless. I found myself completely bored while reading it.  I even took a few-month break in the middle (and it's only a 100-something page book!) because I couldn't muster the desire to finish the thing.  I went back to it, though, and re-read it. When I was done, I was still totally unimpressed.<br /><br />As an appendix at the end of my copy of Coraline, Neil Gaiman in an interview said that at first, he expected the story to be 5-10 pages in length. I think that would've been a very sensible option.<br /><br />2 stars instead of 1 because of Coraline's vaguely charming dad, the only character who is remotely tolerable.
0060987464|5.0|I thought this book answered a lot of questions that I had always wanted to know about Marilyn Manson, and also Trent Reznor. I had always been curious about the relationship between Marilyn and Trent, and although he didn't go into a lot of detail about their personal relationship, the information that was given I was very thankful for, considering what a solitary person Trent is. I found comfort while reading this book, finding myself remembering moments from my childhood similar to his.  Growing up in a religious family, feeling brainwashed by your church, and then in your teens you begin to open your eyes and realize that there is more out there.  I grew up in a small town like Brian Warner (Marilyn Manson), and I also felt like I would never be able to get out of this hell-hole but this book has given me inspiration.  After seeing how many drugs he did, and considering how many drugs I do, it is very interesting to see that he still managed to do something amazing.  And as he said in a recent interview \\"It seems like once artists quit doing drugs, their music starts sucking.\\"  Which is a true statement in my eyes.  I think the hell that drugs bring into your life cause such an internal and external struggle that it gives you a million things to scream about, a million things to write about, and a million things to think about.  All these ideas while Manson was on drugs are what created \\"Antichrist Superstar.\\"  Without drugs, this album would not exist, Manson would not exist.  While I do not recommend drugs, I find it interesting reading about the personal hell that artists have gone through with drugs.  I wish Trent Reznor would write an autobiography and give the sort of view into his life as Marilyn Manson does with \\"The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.\\"  5 stars without a doubt, no matter how much you know about the Antichrist Superstar, I guarantee you will learn something you didn't know in this book.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Christopher Nolan's much-hyped follow-up to \\"Batman Begins,\\" \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a rousing, action-packed and emotionally exhilarating sequel, filled with twists and surprises that few will see coming.<br />The acting is fantastic. Once again, Christian Bale proves that he IS Batman, and gives him further emotional depth in this film. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Gary Oldman return from the first film, and give terrific performances as well.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal, who replaces Katie Holmes as Rachel, does a good job, though she tries too hard to be like Katie, and doesn't bring too much new to the table. Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Harvey Dent, and his transformation to Two-Face is handled perfectly. But the best performance in the movie is, you guessed it, Heath Ledger as the Joker. He brings a truly menacing, psychopathic presence to the character, bringing just the right amount of humor to make him fascinating. Ledger's performance is truly terrifying, showing the talent he truly had, and makes Jack Nicholson's Joker look like a stupid clown.<br />But, does all this mean that it's a better film that \\"Begins?\\" For me, it is a great sequel, but isn't as good as the previous entry. There are a few moments where the film tends to drag. They could have edited out an additional five to ten minutes without losing much. Also, I feel that Harvey Dent/Two-Face was a great character; there was no need to kill him off at the end. But these two drawbacks are minor, and the terrific writing and fantastic performances make up for it immensely. This is a fantastic sequel that Batman and comic-book aficionados will definitely enjoy!<br />Movie Grade: A
B0018AK9RA|1.0|It is rare that I will write a review of an album on Amazon because I tend to have pretty decent luck when making music purchases.  So when I found out that Judas Priest was putting out another new album that was a concept album, although skeptical, I was very excited none the less.  So much so, that I coughed up the money and got it the week that it came out instead of hemming and hawing and waiting to save money for it.    It took me almost a week an a half to get through this dribble.  The first disc is so unbearably boring and tiresome, that I would only recommend this as a \\"Having trouble sleeping?  Take a listen to this.\\" album.  The music is repetitive and droning, and Rob Halford's \\"singing\\" is atrocious.  The majority of the time he is grunting out one word at a time in a monotone single syllable reading.  The lyrics are good and there is so much promise if only he would pick up ANY sense of pace.  I know that this is a concept album, but is it still supposed to be a rock and roll album.  A song that should only be about three and a half minutes if it was sang instead of read to me like I was a two year old learning Dick and Jane, is drug out to an eight minute snore fest.    Disc two is slightly better, only because of the first three songs.  They are decent (not fantastic), but at least have some sense of rhythm and flow.  They had a great opportunity here because there are concept albums that work.  Take Queensryche's Operation Mindcrime (The first one, not the god-awful volume 2) or Gamma Ray's No World Order for examples.  Those are both fantastic albums because they work as an entire concept or as individual songs.  You can sing with them, you can listen to just one song and enjoy it by itself, and even better - you can stay awake while you listen to it!  Heck, even KISS' Music From The Elder is a masterpiece compared to this slop.    If you want good Judas Priest start with Sin After Sin or Defenders Of The Faith.  Both are different eras of Priest,but both work.  This does not.

1594489505|4.0|Khaled Hosseini's second novel proves that he is here to stay. I thought Suns was even better than Kite Runner. A Thousand Splendid Suns was a very well-written, engrossing, page turner which provides the reader a nice glimpse of the history and culture of Afganistan.  Overall, Hosseini has a big formula for both writing and reading success.    My problem with the Kite Runner was that I thought the first third of the novel was SUPERB and the last two-thirds were a let-down.  Here again, with A Thousand Splendid Suns, there is a split.  The first three-quarters, FANTASTIC, the last quarter, just so-so.  For me the book could have ended once Rasheed got his come-uppance.  That was all I was really waiting for.    The story revolves around the characters of two women:  Mariam and Laila, their childhoods and their ultimate and unlikely shared marriage to the bully Rasheed.  The women's characters, and the characters of the men they loved (Mariam's father and for Laila, Tariq) were very well-developed.  Husband, Rasheed's character, was not developed at all.  I guess it was no matter since we obviously were not supposed to like him anyway.  It was a story of lost and found love, fear, and the struggle for survival amid a war-torn, confusing society where it seems anything oppressive, goes.  My favorite part was the quiet but airtight bond that developed between Mariam and Laila in the face of calamity.
B00005JPY0|5.0|ill start off with the main reason 99% of us have had so much curiousity in this movie. Heath Ledger as the joker. and what can be said? the man was amazing. he is THE Joker. this role solidifies his stance as one of todays best young actors, if not the best. his death truly was a tragedy. when watching this movie, you may forget thats Heath Ledger behind all the make up, he is so into character its not even funny.<br /><br />Christain Bale, Morgan Freeman, and everyone else were as solid as possible. Maggie Gyllenhall was a massive improvement over Katie Holmes as well. If only Spider Man 3 could've followed this example in story telling. this movie managed to balance so many elements and still be completely tangable. you see it all, from a brief appearance of the scarecrow, to the perfectly maniacal Heath Ledger as the joker, even the downfall of Harvey Dent and some major surprises i shouldnt even mention.<br /><br />this is a whole new bat man, a much darker, down to earth series than we've seen before. well, as down to earth as a movie about a bat-suited anti-hero can be. it takes the darkness of Batman Begins to a new level. there is still a total lack of super powers for the villains, but they have their own means of trouble. The Joker can take batmans greatest power, Fear, which is crippling for most men, and laugh in his face.<br /><br />the acting, camera work, effects, and story are all beyond superb, and worthy of many viewings. ive already seen it twice since opening, and plan to at least once more.<br /><br />go see it now! i guarantee most of you will be back to see it again.
B000E41MRC|3.0|This film is about the Nuremberg rally in 1934 in which Hitler flies into town, the speeches, and the parades. It was produced FOR Hitler, so it's a propaganda film. It begins with Hitler flying in to an airport, and follows a motorcade lined with cheering, adoring Germans, as Hitler is driven to his hotel. In scene after scene, we see Hitler making speeches, reviewing the SA, the SS, field workers carrying shovels, Hitler's Youth Brigades, and torch light parades. The film is in B&W and has been restored. Video is quite good. Sound is OK.<br /><br />Since my initial review, I watched Lina being interviewed. She won an award for this film, but she regretted doing it. She was not political, she was an actress. Hitler implored her to do this film, and she did no others for the Nazi party.

B000WGWQG8|3.0|I read the book a few years before seeing the miniseries.  I was excited when they came out with the miniseries and was anxious to see it.  I was disappointed.  The interation between Adams and Jefferson who were good friends until their deaths was not there.  The story did not reveal that both Adams and Jefferson died on the same day -- the 4th of July.  It did not show that Adams' daughter had a mastectomy without anesthesia, and finally succumbed to breast cancer.  I just think for a miniseries, it could have been so much better.
0446402389|5.0|An astonising debut, as chilling as \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" or any other literary \\"horror\\" story I've ever read.  Its about 440 pages and I read it in 2 days since it kept pulling me along.  Brilliant, spine-tingling ...can't wait for his next-what a tough act to follow.
0743454529|3.0|Without being a spoiler (be careful reading these reviews, because I have to assume you'll find some), I have to say that this is the most betrayed by an  author that I've ever felt at the end of a novel that I was otherwise really enjoying.  This is my third Picoult book now, and I was thinking they were OK, but I wasn't seeing the hype my fellow mom friends were going on about.  As I got into My Sister's Keeper, I was totally getting it.<br /><br />I think that Jodi Picoult gets 5 stars (more if they were available) for her story IDEAS, 3-4 stars for her writing itself, and 1 star for her poorly developed romantic subplots (that's ok.. they aren't usually central to the book anyway.. I just wish she wouldn't bother!).  The situations she creates in her book are just fantastic and MSK may be the best one of all.  But after developing a gripping, and heartfelt storyline, boy does she just COP OUT at the end.  I have never wanted to literally THROW a book as much as I did at the end of this one.  And make no mistake, it's not the good kind of angry at the end of a book, where it's the circumstance and story that gets me mad... it's the author.  I went from just weeping through one scene to actually yelling out at my husband, are you KIDDING me?!?!  Then I had to go through the story for him because he thought I was having some kind of anyeurism, and he was equally annoyed.<br /><br />Picoult had an opportunity to take this story so many different ways that would have all been morally, emotionally and legally/medically interesting.  Instead boy did she drop the ball.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed this book, right up until the last 20 pages or so, I have to say that I just can't recommend it.  Save yourself the pain.  It's like the frog thing at the end of Magnolia...except that was not even so bad because the whole movie was awful.  This was great, right up until the end.
B000URDEB0|5.0|It's difficult for me to talk about Dark Passion Play without resorting to hyperbole. It already ranks among my favorite albums of all time. This is a bold statement, but this album contains some of the most amazing music I have ever heard. I consider it Nightwish's best album, of the ones that I've heard. Tuomas's compositions are complex and stunning. The combination of orchestra, metal guitars, keyboards and soaring voices are just stunning. Every song is just amazing. There are no weak spots even though the album is very long. The opener, The Poet and the Pendulum is a masterpiece in itself. The song wows for thirteen minutes. Each section of this epic song is wonderful and beautiful and memorable. The final song, Meadows of Heaven is among the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. It seems to get mixed reactions from reviewers on here, but I love it to an absurd degree. It reminds me of everything beautiful and worthwhile in life. Like the great Ghost Love Score on the [[ASIN:B0002ZYE1Y Once]] album, Meadows of Heaven is a song that nearly moves me to tears every time I heart it.     Those are the masterpieces, the first and last song (and one other). However, everything in between is stunning as well. Bye Bye Beautiful is a heartfelt ode to former singer, Tarja. Amaranth is probably the most pop-oriented, radio-friendly song on the album. Eva is a soaring ballad; a good showcase for singer Annette Olson. Sahara is one of the heavier tracks, but still very melodic and beautiful. Whoever Brings The Night is a great song which could have been a single (it might have been). The Islander is a terrific folk tune. A nice change of pace from the rest of the record. Last of the Wilds is another truly stunning tune. An instrumental with strong Celtic influences (fiddle and Uilleann pipes), it is a wonderful, wonderful piece of music.    Even though the album doesn't feature singer Tarja Turunen I believe it is the band's crowning achievement. I have tried to avoid theAnnette versus Tarja debate, I will just say that Annette is a wonderful singer with more conventional vocals than Tarja's operatic vocals. She does a great job. However, without Tarja in the group the vocals definitely take a backseat to the music. That's okay because the music is absolutely incredible. I think I've said enough. Any lover of symphonic metal or just music in general should hear this masterpiece.

0930289234|5.0|It is 1985, and the United States reigns supreme.  God is an American, manifested from a late-1950s nuclear accident and given the ominous nomenclature of \\"Dr. Manhattan.\\"  As the ultimate government employee he subsequently reshaped the world in his image.  Global warming and high gas prices are nowhere to be seen in a country where electric cars are alive and well.  Nixon is still president, Vietnam has become the 51st state, and the ambitions of the repeatedly humiliated Soviet Union have been frustrated for decades.  All of this is courtesy of an immanent god-being with a decidedly temporal appetite for the ladies.<br /><br />Other, more human heroes once roamed the streets, using flashy costumes and noble deeds to compensate for their lusts and weaknesses.  Some are retired, broken, or dead.  The rest are either outlaws or comfortably employed as government operatives.  One of the latter, a WWII-era extra-normal named \\"The Comedian,\\" is brutally murdered, thrown from the window of his high-rise bachelor pad.  Rorschach, a paranoid, anti-social younger mask hunted by the police for refusing to refrain from his illegal vigilante activities, is convinced that a conspiracy is afoot to eliminate his comrades.  He begins to investigate, and thus events are triggered that may culminate with either 9/11 times a thousand or worldwide nuclear holocaust.<br /><br />\\"Watchman\\" is touted as the greatest comic book maxi-series ever created.  By now that claim has become a clich&eacute;, but the title fits due to its enduring impact on comic books as a whole.  Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons flipped the bird to the Comics Code and dragged us into the era of dark and gritty comic book stories, elevating our expectations and souring us on cutesy Bat-Mites and boy-scout Supermen.  There's so much detail and depth in this epic that even two decades later I find fresh nuances after each re-read.  Threads of morality, philosophy, and theology are woven throughout \\"Watchmen.\\"  Does the end justify the means?  Are we all there is in the universe?  What would happen if God became man in the modern era and imposed his power on humanity?  These and other dilemmas are acted out by the protagonists in this masterful example of the comic book genre's acme.<br /><br />As Rorschach trolls the streets seeking the killer of heroes we see how profoundly sick society is underneath the pollution-free skies.  And when the living god removes himself from the equation, the doomsday clock slouches toward midnight as a vengeful Soviet Union, emboldened by his absence, storms into Afghanistan.  With time running out, we meet more heroes: the original Nite-Owl and his portly, middle-aged imitator; the mother and daughter Silk Spectres, both linked to the Comedian in disturbing ways; the brilliant and tormented Ozymandias; and Dr. Manhattan, whose increasing alienation from humanity may doom it to Armageddon.  Eventually the killer stands exposed, and as the remaining heroes discover, it ain't no Republic serial villain.<br /><br />The upcoming Watchmen movie has rekindled interest in this classic story, and like a number of fans I'm alternately jazzed and skeptical.  The trailer evokes Dave Gibbons' excellent artwork, and the Smashing Pumpkins' \\"The Beginning is the End is the Beginning\\" is the perfect background song.  But I dunno...the plethora of fast/slow motion shots reminiscent of the fantastical \\"300\\" make me nervous.  I think I'd prefer a \\"Dark Knight\\" treatment more grounded in reality.  Even so, I'm hoping for the best, because \\"Watchmen\\" deserves it.

0743289684|5.0|It was the first half of Ayaan Hirsi Ali's memoir that gave me new insight.  So many times I have seen the news about the terrible strife in Africa with one group slaughtering another - and it was inexplicable, completely beyond my understanding.  How were these people different from each other?  They spoke the same language, were of the same religion yet sometimes they would speak of the `others' as if they were hardly human.  At least now I understand what a clan is and how strong the memory of their ancestors is to them.  Rarely have I learned so much from one book.  I want to thank this remarkable woman for sharing her life with me.    And, of course, her amazing courage is an example to us all.

I'm pleased with the discs and glad to see the guys experimenting and doing what they want. That's right at the heart of metal, IMO.

THE SPIRIT OF LIFE, THANK YOU and AIN'T THAT A LOT OF LOVE are highlights.  I agree that the title makes it sound like it is a concept, themed set and it is not.  It is merely a great collection of songs and a must have for any Simply Red collection.  Don't overlook this one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This video is high intensity and provides a great workout.  I was so sore for the next day after completing the first workout.  There's 3 twenty minute routines to do and so far, i've done the first routine about 5 times.  It's that intense.  I'm probably ready to move up to the other two workouts now too.    Pros: a short, 20 minute kick butt routine that works every part of your body and incorporates strength training with cardio    Cons: there's a quick 3 or 4 minute intro that you can't fast forward through each time you turn on the DVD, but it's not that bad because I just leave it on and do other things during this segment.    All around, it's a really good workout video, especially for the price.

And he relates his academic training to his careers in chess and Ti Chi in an illuminating way.  The parallels between these seemingly unrelated disciplines are striking.  Josh's writing helps you understand how his learning process can be applied to many fields of study.<br /><br />This book is also very well written.

I loved the vivid descriptions of his chess and Ti Chi battles.<br /><br />After reading this book I look forward to hearing him speak someday.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of is that this book may not be very accessible to people who are not already \\"learners\\".  If you are not interested in learning and improving your ability to learn, this book may be inaccessible to you.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed learning and honing my personal learning process, so I absolutely loved this book.

0143038419|5.0|I found this book a wonderful read. Leaving herself open to the world, the author shares her journey to self-awareness.  She seeks something that some in this world will probably never understand for she has a desire to heal herself from within.  Through her search, she finds that the Divine has been living inside of her all the time, just waiting for her to find the \\"bliss\\" of connection.  As a pastor, this is a message that I would gladly share with the great majority of people who are hurting deep inside, those who don't know yet that if they reconnect with their Maker (whatever they call their Maker!) those hurts can be healed.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is a great actor and he turns in his usual powerful performance. Unfortunately, I wish he'd chosen a better vehicle for his talents. I very much enjoyed the detailed re-creation of a bygone era, but perhaps because it was based on a shallow novel of socialist agitprop, the story did nothing for me. There are no really major obstacles for the protagonist to overcome, just minor challenges. Why was Plainview such a heartless misanthrope? We have no idea. Why was the preacher boy such a raving lunatic? Beats me. Unfortunately, all this movie gives us are exaggerated stock characters from a socialist morality play.

B0013LPS7U|5.0|\\"Boy\\"  - A Historical Footnote to A Rock Classic<br /><br />  So many of rock's bands in the 70's and 80's had kick-butt debut albums, and U2 was certainly no exception.  Although \\"U2 3\\" is their first release (3 song EP), \\"Boy\\" introduced the world to the combination of post-punk and new wave that was to change the face of American and British music for the 80's and most of the 90's.  United States audiences half-way embraced United Kingdom new wave or punkmusic, but until U2 emerged with their unique sound, most of the US was totally ignorant of any music coming from Europe.  Their allegiances, in the late 70's and early 80's were still confined to the supergroups of Fleetwood Mac, Peter Frampton, the Eagles and Doobie Brothers.  It was ripe for a completely new genre to come and displace the formula-matic pop rock that had so dominated FM rock.<br /><br />  Credit FM radio's AOR (album-oriented-music) and College Radio for making the US aware of bands like U2.  I saw the first U2 tour in 1981- right when U2's second album came out \\"October.\\"  Back then, it was not unusual for three bands to play a concert, and fairly big acts, but the third act was usually a cutting edge band.  U2 was the 3rd billed band that night behind the J.Geils Band and Steve Miller.  Both of those bands were supposed to be two of the best live bands in the world, and damn if U2 didn't blow them both away!  Yup!  That's how hot they were right out of the gate.  I remember Bono jumping off 15 foot super stacked amplifiers, doing a tuck and roll, coming up precisely midstage, while all the while singing while doing these gymnastics.  I've seen hundreds of concerts (being an FM disc jockey) but had never, and still have never seen an act with more energy that Early U2.  That night, EVERYONE walked away stunned asking: \\"Who WAS that band?\\"  The local record stores quickly sold every U2 album in stock within the week.<br /><br />  So what was so unique about this debut that changed the face of rock and roll?  It married the Punk rock movement with the New Wave movement into a singular sound that was based on both primitive rhythms, and elaborate jangling guitar work.  It had a frantic pace that U2 never quit duplicated, so that makes \\"Boy\\" sort of the hard rockers favorite U2 albums.  They had flashes of it later on, but \\"October\\" and \\"Boy\\" had an intensity and compact sound that was later slowed down and more maturely attuned to.  It was enough to capture the US interest and provided the base clay that virtually all of the new wave bands of the 80's tried to emulate.  This was the album that did that:  roots rock of New Wave and Alternative music.  It took another three or four albums for U2 to completely break out, but after \\"War\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\", virtually all rock lovers knew who U2 was.<br /><br />  I think it is critical for rock fans to understand the context of WHY this album release was so important, so forgive me a bit if I didn't really review the new deluxe edition of `Boy\\".  That was not my intent with this writeup.  I am just trying to give you a bit of a background on the album itself.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my diatribe (LOL) and if you think this review was helpful,please check the box below<br /><br />Jeff Feezle of Macafeezmarried the Punk rock movement with the New Wave movement into a singular sound that was based on both primitive rhythms, and elaborate jangling guitar work.

This was the album that did that:  roots rock of New Wave and Alternative music.   It took another three or four albums for U2 to completely break out, but after \\"War\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\", virtually all rock lovers knew who U2 was.      I think it is critical for rock fans to understand the context of WHY this album release was so important, so forgive me a bit if I didn't really review the new deluxe edition of `Boy\\".  That was not my intent with this writeup.  I am just trying to give you a bit of a background on the album itself.

0393327655|3.0|To no one's surprise, Mr. Harris trashes religion and faith as effortlessly as a tornado renders a cow weightless.  \\"The End of Faith\\", however, comes across more as a divisive and apocalyptic rhetoric than anything else.    Mr. Harris implicates religious dogma for most of the death and destruction that has gripped this world in the past and the present, when in fact, 500 ng/dl of the hormone testosterone in the male anatomy is probably responsible for most of the ill effects in almost all societies, past and present.  As long as there is a propensity to compare penis size, and there are excesses to be had, there will be blood.  Granted, religion probably provides an extra kick to compel a nutjob to walk into a crowd and blow himself up.  But even if all religions of the world were to be eradicated, there are a plethora of other excuses to wreak havoc, e.g. tribalism, nationalism.    For there to be world peace, Islam must undergo a radical transformation, asserts Mr. Harris.  Yet, he almost completely ignores the West's meddling in the internal affairs of many Middle Eastern countries to suit their selfish needs.  If oil were a religion, then Mr. Harris' points would be valid. Good old fashioned greed, the almighty dollar, jealousy and humiliation are the true culprits of ill in that volatile region.    We've come a long way since the barbaric eras in our collective histories, and we still have a ways to go before civility is pervasive.  Islam and WMD will not spell the end of the world.  The end of faith is as illusive an idea as the paperless office. Faith will persevere, life will go on, and Mr. Harris will greatly benefit from a chill pill.

0061122416|4.0|If I had to pick up a book after reading Joseph Campbell's book, \\"The Power of Myth,\\" this book was definitely a good follow-up. While still entranced by Campbell's storytelling and passion for ancient myths, this book entranced me as well. I finished this book in a day (which is literally impossible for me these days), so it should tell you that this is a simple read.     This book was also lent to me by my dad who did not care for this book at all (he read this after finishing \\"Kiterunner\\" which he did enjoy), but he wanted me to read it. The story is beautiful, simple and short. I have not heard the hype of this book nor did I know what it was about.     The seemingly simple story of a shepherd leaving all he owns behind to explore the great world resounds with me. The idea of Soul of the World resounds with me also. Following your personal dream and living life to the fullest. These all are lessons that I keep forgetting in the normal day-to-day drudge of daily life. This is a simple story that keeps reminding the reader that there is more to life than just what is here in front of one's eyes. This is a story of listening to your heart and moving forward to find the dreams of youth again.     While this is not the best book I have ever read, it is a pretty good story that is pretty much duplicated by many other stories floating around. I almost gave it a three-star but decided it was good enough for a four-star simply because I enjoyed a pleasant afternoon of reading this book, which I rarely get these days.    7/25/08
B00140PK6O|5.0|Cranford is an 1840s rural English village where nothing ever really changes and everything obeys an archaic social code of social calling, gossip and mild xenophobia. Thrown into this heady mix of social convention and small-town principles are Mary Smith (Lisa Dillon), the young friend of the Jenkyns sisters (Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins) and Dr. Harrison (Simon Woods), protogeé of the more established and more conventional Dr. Morgan (John Bowe).    The cast list reads like a Who's Who and Who's Left of A-List British acting talent: in addition to the players already named above (all of them giving excellent performances),  we have Francesca Annis, Imelda Staunton, Philip Glenister, Deborah Findlay, Julia McKenzie, Michael Gambon, Julia Sawalha - the list goes on and on. I'll just say that the calibre of acting in \\"Cranford\\" represents some of the best work of all its principle actors, and make special mention of Judi Dench (the woman can do no wrong, it seems: her beautiful, heart-rending portrayal of Matty Jenkyns is engaging and extremely rewarding), Julia Sawalha (her Spinster-on-the-shelf is one of the series' high points) and Imelda Staunton and Julia McKenzie (roles to match that of Dench: we don;t see enough of either actress, though).    Production design and direction are every bit the equal of the eponymous Firth/Ehle \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" or the Gillian Anderson \\"Bleak House\\", and Sue Birtwhistle's witty, cleverly adapted script keeps everything moving forward at a gently progressive pace. It's unashamedly feel-good, but don't let the superficial triteness of parts of the plot put you off: \\"Cranford\\" contains a wealth of top-drawer acting talent and buckets enough of the feel-good factor, along with hefty dashes of black comedy and romantic drama, and makes the cheese factor a necessary and enjoyable facet of this wonderful series.    I can't tell you much more about \\"Cranford\\" without revealing plot spoilers, so I will not: but please don't take the shortness of this review as a reflection of the series' quality: \\"Cranford\\", everything about it and everyone in it, is absolutely excellent. If it has a flaw, it's that there's not enough of it to go round. You'll definitely be left wanting more, and in this case, that's a very, very good thing indeed.     Wholly recommended.
B00133KDM8|5.0|This album is amazing throughout. Tarja's voice is more upfront, and the song styles are way more varied than they ever were in Nightwish.<br />We have the rockers such as \\"Die Alive\\" and \\"Ciaran's well.\\"  We have more mid-tempo pop-ish items such as \\"Damned and Divine.\\"  And then we have two absolutely amazing and heart-wrenching ballads:  \\"The Reign\\" and \\"Our Great Divide.\\" The latter, especially, has almost made me weep. Call me whatever you want, but Tarja's voice in these two songs is as moving and emotionally powerful as it gets.<br /> If you are a Nightwish fan at all, and enjoy a damn good singer with the soaringest vocals around, look no further. This album delivers.
B00005JPY0|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is brilliant.     This is the Superhero flick evolved: once thirty minutes or so of screen time elapses the realisation suddenly dawns on you that this is A. not just another flashy movie full of staid dialogue and cheesy FX, and B. it's extremely enjoyable.    Christopher Nolan's tense, brooding follow-up to his own canonical \\"Batman Begins\\" hits home runs on almost all fronts, not least of which are the visuals: his bald-faced, unpretentious way of showcasing the blazing action set-pieces, or the more reigned-in scenes of human conflict, is excellent: there are no cheap camera tricks (or at least, no noticeable ones) here and Nolan manages to create a very real sense of Gotham-on-the-edge with his camera. The breathless excitement in the film's opening bank sequence sets the tone: without any help from fake-looking CGI we're thrown headlong and without explanation into the midst of a very tense and visually pleasing robbery set-piece. Happily, most of the rest of the movie follows suit.    Acting is top-drawer, Bale gives another fantastic performance as Bruce Wayne, and, while he still comes off slightly stiff as Batman, that's not really his fault: the voice manipulator makes him sound sort of like a broken Terminator. But that's a small quibble: Bale is a very great actor and does a very great job as Gotham's protector.     Gary Oldman, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman make for a skilled and hugely successful supporting team: their roles are small and somewhat perfunctory but the actors don't let them slide as such; rather, Commissioner Gordon,  Alfred Pennyworth and Lucius Fox turn out to be very memorable secondary characters from a fantastic movie, and without whom certainly \\"The Dark Knight\\" wouldn't have recaptured the same sense of fullness as \\"Batman Begins\\". Maggie Gyllenhaal is similarly memorable as assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes: her interrogation scene, as one example, shows Rachel as a powerful, intelligent, bright woman, and this provides a great counterpoint to Bale's Bruce Wayne. Aaron Eckhart is a truly great Harvey Dent, there's no sentimental or cloying \\"Good Guy\\" aspects to his thoroughly good-and-moral character - as a secondary villain in a movie whose cast roster is already overflowing Eckhart's talent means Harvey Dent is one of \\"The Dark Knight's\\" more memorable characters.    Joker is whole and satisfying and enthralling, and Ledger's performance should get him awards. I didn't once think of Heath Ledger when watching the Joker, and, considering the tragedy surrounding the actor, that's high praise indeed: Ledger's strength of performance lifts you out of reality and throws you into the madness that is Gotham City at his mercy. Without any nostalgia, without the media frenzy over his death, without any leniency or tendency towards misty rose-coloured glasses for the actor himself: he's incredible, and brilliant. These are words I do not use often when reviewing films :-)    Music is occasional and beautiful, James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer are to be congratulated on a fine and affecting score to match a fine and affecting movie. Nathan Crowley's production design continues a trend from \\"Batman Begins\\" - \\"The Dark Knight\\" looks mostly plausible and very real. Witness Joker's deeply unsettling look, the utilitarian realism of the new \\"Batcave\\", the way the Hong Kong setpiece borders on James Bond but never leaves us rolling our eyes for unbelievability.    So what's wrong with \\"The Dark Knight\\"?    Well, the story's a little confused towards the ending: there's two sets of story climax and only one of them really works, by the time Batman is dashing through a construction site the plot has, unfortunately, taken a back seat to the visuals, and this is out-of-character for the rest of the film. Still, this is one relatively short scene and doesn't ruin the overall movie at all. Also, we do not get enough of Two-Face - particularly since Aaron Eckhart's just so very good in the role- and this potentially excellent villain winds up as a sort-of afterthought.    Some major character-related events occur and we don't get to see much of how this affects the others: this is slightly unreal - and particularly so, since \\"Batman Begins\\" was in large part about dealing with interpersonal relationships and how they affect us. And there are one or two jarringly hi-tech bits of equipment that Batman uses which appear to be very out-of-place and scream \\"Merchandise! Merchandise!\\" at us.     But who cares? These bad points don't ruin the overall enjoyment and theme of \\"The Dark Knight\\" - not at all - and if they weren't present then \\"The Dark Knight\\" would be the all-time pinnacle of the Superhero movie. As is, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a truly brilliant experience - a movie for adults that just happens to have a Superhero theme running through it as opposed to a children's movie made to sell toys and videogames.    Get to the cinema! I can't recommend this one highly enough: definitely my best summer movie and one of the best I've seen all year. I cannot wait for the next instalment...
B000YI68EA|5.0|I bought this watch for my 17 year old stepdaughter.  She loves it and wears it everywhere.

0525950079|1.0|Last summer, I read Pillars of the Earth, and really enjoyed it.  World Without End was a dismal \\"sequel\\", full of undeveloped characters oozing modern angst.  As Ken Follet himself has admitted, the only cheerfully celibate character he has ever created is Prior Phillip, one of the main characters in Pillars of the Earth. The book is wonderful in how it chronicles the building of a cathedral, and the medieval mindset receives a measure of respect. It has quite a bit of sex in it, but the scenes are more linked to the human condition and don't have the smutty feel that the sex scenes in World Without End have.<br /><br />I recently finished World Without End. I should have just gone directly to the acknowledgment page, and, upon seeing the name of Erica Jong, saved myself hours of wasted time. World Without End is full of modern attitudes about many things, not just sex. The time period is the high middle ages, the location England, but the feeling this book evokes is that of the Borgia popes and decadent Renaissance Italy as chronicled by, say, a Dan Brown.  Religion is blamed for every evil imaginable. Forget the ample historical documentation of the Church as being the driving force behind cathedrals, universities and hospitals, forget about the many scientists, scholars and humanitarians affiliated with the Church throughout the milennia -- all you will be presented with in World Without End is narrowness, greed, illicit sex, murder, betrayal, hypocrisy, sexism and stupidity. Anything good that comes of religious life is due, not to the tenets of Christianity and the devotion of the followers of Christ, but to the inner strength of and resistance to Church teachings by the sympathetic characters. One of the most ridiculous situations is the lead female character seeking an herbal abortion from a wise woman healer (another sympathetic character) and then staggering off to the hospital run by the priory in order to abort and get cleaned up. And no, she was not raped or subjected to incest. You will find in this book that women who are raped and conceive as a result bring forth children who are a bad.  Revenge is the vehicle with which all loose ends are managed.  This book is utterly devoid of the action of grace on any character in the entire tome.<br /><br />I did read the entire book.

0452289963|2.0|In short: traditional Catholic spirituality rewritten in the current vocabulary. The evidence?<br />Eckhart Tolle (pg.225): (1) non-resistance (2) non-judgment, (3) non-attachment<br />Ignatian Banners of Christ (in the Spiritual Exercises) (1) vulnerability (2) humility (3) poverty<br />Or take Eckart's sense of Presence and the Now. Here's a quote from \\"The Sacrament of the Present Moment\\" by Jean Pierre Caussade, a humble eighteenth century priest<br />\\" And so we leave God to act in everything, reserving for ourselves only love and obedience to the present moment. For this is our eternal duty. This compelling love, steeped in silence, is required of every soul...Pure, simple and sure, it is a straight path along which souls walk with courage and faith, looking neither to the right nor to the left, unconcerned with everything else. \\"<br />Or page 78 in \\"A New Earth\\" \\"This is why we call it Presence. The ultimate purpose of human existence, which is to say, your purpose, is to bring that power into this world.\\" Isn't this a rephrasing of what it means to be in Christ? To be alive with the Holy Spirit in Christ? There are many such examples.<br />What is strange is Eckhart's explicit anti-Catholicism. On page 70, for example, he draws a parallel between the Catholic Church, in the first paragraph, and Pol Pot, in the second.  I didn't uncover any of his own opinions which seemed at odds with Catholic tradition, although there is much that is missing - and vital - a concern with social justice being chief here, or a respect for the discipline of communal life.<br />I would say that the Catholic antidote to the ego is living in a web of relationships which we call community, where we learn to respond to God's love in the present moment. Eckhart Tolle's antidote to ego seems to be rather more solitary and less loving.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Being a rock guitar freak of two decades' standing, it is with  acute embarrassment that I confess to only having heard this record right through for the first time in my 39th year.<br /><br />Clearly I went to the wrong school and hung out with the wrong, self conscious types, and stupidly we looked askance at this bogan rock. More fool us.<br /><br />What a remarkable, single minded, self-assured, exuberant record this is, and what a master stroke for a bunch of scot-inflected teenaged Aussies to have settled on such a perceptively observed formula and executed on it so flawlessly (and stuck with it for the thirty years since!). All of rock's evolved extravagant frippery is discarded or reduced down to its elements. The drums mark out a thumping 4/4 on-beat; stereo guitars crank out a primordial syncopated boogie. Bon Scott wails talentedly and indulgently - even cretinously, as the Amazon reviewer puts it - about rogering everything that moves and getting the clap.<br /><br />All of rock's anachronistic knowingness is jettisoned and in its place the sort of smutty wailings you'd expect from a bunch of teenage dirtbags. The result: a hilarious, ecstatic, and utterly irresistable rock record.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B000J233I0|4.0|While I agree with much that the Santa Fe listener says in his review, I think his verdict a little harsh. This set has a lot going for it: an all Italian cast; a superlative Di Luna, Azucena and Ferrando in Bastianini, Cossotto and Vinco respectively; probably the greatest Italian conductor of his generation, and a chance for Bergonzi fans to hear him tackle a role at the limit of his capability.<br /><br />It is true that Serafin is sometimes a little too relaxed; his \\"Squilli, echeggi la tromba\\" at the start of Part III is simply too slow and lacking in martial bravura but elsewhere he displays his mastery of the score and is always considerate of his singers. There is a problem with Stella's Leonora; it is most noticeable in her placid, careful opening aria, \\"Tacea la notte\\". She is \\"correct\\" in everything she does but hardly ever makes your pulse rush (as she can and does in her 1964 recording of \\"Andrea Chenier\\" with Corelli, for example). However, if you do not lose patience with her, she warms up considerably and by Part IV uses a combination of her gutsy lower register and floating top notes to make an excellent job of the \\"D'amor sull'ali rose\\" and the \\"Miserere\\".<br /><br />I do not think that Bergonzi sounds as if he is stretched beyond his limits in the \\"Di quella pira\\" - although I agree that he probably is stretched TO his limits. He manages plenty of squillo in his sound and of course phrases wonderfully. Corelli he ain't - but his is a successful way of doing Manrico, I think.<br /><br />Bastianini is wonderful, even if he could occasionally temper that big brazen sound and show a little more tenderness in phrases such as \\"O Leonora\\" in the \\"In braccio al mio rival\\". His \\"Il balen\\" is  truly beautiful; not a hint of the hoarseness which presaged the throat cancer which ended his career a mere three years later and his life two years after that at 44. His breath control and top G are astounding; the latter attacked cleanly and held effortlessly.<br /><br />Cossotto is in slightly fresher voice as Azucena than in the later celebrated Mehta recording; powerful and affecting; a wholly successful assumption of that demanding role from an artist at the top of her form.<br /><br />Finally, Vinco gives us the most vividly characterised and beautifully vocalised Ferrando on record.<br /><br />So a \\"near miss\\" is too unkind a verdict; Stella is by no means a disaster and there is much pleasure to be had from listening to this set. I would not say that the Callas or Bjorling sets are superior, as although Bjorling, like Bergonzi, sang Manrico frequently on stage to great acclaim, some might prefer a heftier tenor with more steel in his voice and a more assertive top C. The Mehta or the later Karajan probably still hold sway for most listeners - and then there is the live Karajan performance with Corelli, Price and Bastianini - or what about the old EMI studio recording with Corelli and Merrill, great Verdi singers both? We have an \\"embarras de richesses\\", thank goodness, to choose from - but I am still happy to make room on my shelves for this 1962 Serafin set.><br />Cossotto is in slightly fresher voice as Azucena than in the later celebrated Mehta recording; powerful and affecting; a wholly successful assumption of that demanding role from an artist at the top of her form.<br /><br />Finally, Vinco gives us the most vividly characterised and beautifully vocalised Ferrando on record.<br /><br />So a \\"near miss\\" is too unkind a verdict; Stella is by no means a disaster and there is much pleasure to be had from listening to this set.

0930289234|4.0|I read this series in 86-87 when it was first released. We waited rather impatiently for each new issue to arrive and weren't disappointed.<br /><br />Until the end.<br /><br />Not for one minute do I believe that Alan Moore didn't know that the ending was a rip-off of the Outer Limits episode.

0316010669|2.0|This book is full of promise and full of interesting stories. But ultimately, it doesn't even end up proving or disproving any of the ideas on its jacket.    Some people are good at trusting their instincts, and they end up right. Others are bad at trusting them. Other people's instincts themselves are untrustworthy. Other people don't trust their instincts. Some are right, some are wrong.    It's the equivalent of snob candy--it feels like an intellectual book, but it really doesn't say much of anything. It just makes you feel smart for a few minutes, if that.    I'd put money that no one will be talking about this book in two years. It's just the flavor of (last) month.
B000UBMWG4|2.0|Obviously, the movie's great.  Classic, and with five discs of material at this price, how can you go wrong?  However, my problem's not with the quality of the movie, the blue ray encoding, etc., but instead the delivered product.  After waiting a week due to backorder, I found a beat-up, dirty, puffy envelope in my mailbox.  Upon opening, I pulled out the movie I'd been eagerly anticipating.  Blue plastic chips spilled everywhere, the case shattered at every corner.  Packed in a puny bubble wrap envelope.  Amazon, you can do better than this.  What happened to all the comfortable, safe, brown boxes you used to send even the smallest products in???
1594489505|5.0|I read Kite Runner, which was so outstanding, I could barely put it down while reading.  I enjoyed reading Hosseini's work so much, I immediately went out and bought A Thousand SPlendid Suns.  From the first few sentences I was hooked!  Both Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, are so fantastic.  I do think that I did enjoy this book more than Kite Runner.  I stongly recommend both books to everyone out there.  Whether your into reading or not, you should pick up Housseini's books and see what a wonderful writer he is!  He truly captures your heart with each and every character in the book.  It makes it hard for you to choose which character's side you are on!      Keep on writing Khaled Hosseini!  I can't wait to read what's next...
B0007LHBZE|2.0|This movie stunk. Only got this movie because it was supposedly filmed in Lawerence, Kansas. Unfortunately, it was filmed way out in the boon-docks of Lawerence, and that was maybe the first 15 minutes. Was a somewhat confusing movie about Zombies in Utah or somewhere. Did not keep my attention for a movie just over an hour long. If you like old style horror movies, this may be for you.
B000K1P66W|5.0|Ruiz's book is fantastic; he adheres to to ACTUAL Toltec wisdom, WITHOUT the silly \\"interpretations\\" which so many \\"New Age\\" charlatans inject when writing about what they label \\"Toltec\\" wisdom.     Ruiz superbly explains the Toltec way in an extremely logical, simple, and intelligent way. These writing could be dubbed \\"Cliff notes for Castanada!\\" This book is a keeper, something to be read, comprehended, and read again. This is one of the very few books which has the intent AND ability to enable the readers to actualize their potential and transform their lives. This book is truly what the Toltec way is all about! This book is the real thing...  (Beware of the numerous authors who claimed to have \\"studied\\" with Ruiz; paying a tuition and studying something doesn't mean you are a successful student!)
B000002BHE|3.0|Falling Into You by Celine Dion was a good album for its time but now this cd is pretty much throwaway pop. Songs I do appreciate include: Because You Loved Me, River Deep Mountain High, Call the Man, All By Myself, It's All Coming Back to me Now, and the title-track. The rest of the songs are filler. I used to be a fan of Celine's but after Let's Talk About Love album I lost interest, my music taste changed after that. Romantic album but nothing spectacular.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Although it looks like a simple movie in the beginning, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a complex film that plays on the fear of anarchy.<br /><br />The movie opens with a bank heist. Each hoodlum with a clown face shoots the other until the Joker arrives to take his money for himself. However, the Joker is not interested in money. He is more interested in spreading fear and anarchy.<br /><br />Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, works with Police Lieutenant Gordon and District Attorney Harvey Dent. Although Harvey is dating Bruce's ex-girlfriend, Bruce is certain that Harvey would be the person to bring peace and justice to Gotham City.<br /><br />And for awhile, it seems that the three-man team took down the mob, which had connections with a Chinese businessman and some other Gotham gangs. However, the Joker plays a trump card--he kills the two people involved in the prosecution and gets close to killing Harvey.<br /><br />After the disaster, the Joker makes matters worse, with attempts to kill Gordon and Harvey. The Joker also plans other murders beforehand, revealing them in a ruthless interrogation scene. Batman is forced to make decisions to choose which person he needs to save, and even that decision may not be the right one.<br /><br />This is not an easy superhero film to watch. To give people a hint on the ending, let's just say that hearts will be shattered in many situations.<br /><br />Batman may be a hero, but he never does everything perfect. This is one of the few films that shows that a superhero is vulnerable, and he puts so many things at risk to do his job. Is it worth it for him to fight as a hero when he could lose everything? Who knows. But for whatever reason, he's still fighting. This is a postmodern masterpiece of a superhero movie that puts all other superheroes to shame.
B00177Y9ZM|1.0|I have three good word of advice: READ THE BOOK  The book was written in 1992, I first read it in 1994.  Since then I have re-read this book several times.  The book is rich with story, emotion and the details to breath life into the characters.     I really used to hope that someday this story could be turned into a movie.  Now I just wish they would re-title this movie because, unfortunatly, it is such a weak distortion of the book.    Please don't waste your time with the movie, just read the book.
0439806119|3.0|I thought the whole book was a good idea, being futuristic and all...very interesting to see one view of what the world could end up like.   The plot was pretty good, although I guessed a lot of it before it happened.  Throughout the whole book, it seemed like there was something missing and I just couldn't figure out what it was. But as I'm writing this review, I realize that the characters had no special attributes that set them apart. They were flat. Besides how Shay and Tally's views differed, they were all basically the same. They all talked the same and acted the same pretty much. I think it could've been a lot better if they each had their own individual qualities (Tally, Shay, David, Croy, Maddy, Az).  I also think it would've made the book a LOT more interesting if they talked more about how the world changed and why, and when they passed Rusty cities, it would've been cool if the author had David know what the cities were called. For example, the Rusty Ruins could have been a part of New York? That would've been really fascinating.  On the other hand, it was an alright book, and I suppose I'll read the rest of the series just to see what happens.
0786948523|4.0|One cannot review the new D&D Monster Manual in isolation from the other Core Rules books. The new system is a worthy successor to 3.5, but while it is in some ways even more consistently d20, it is also a dramatic break from 3.5 and you cannot take the monsters in this book to use in your 3.5 (or earlier) campaign.    What is interesting about the Monster Manual in particular is the variety of monsters available within a type. For example, there are 16 monsters listed under the heading of \\"Goblin.\\" Now this inclues Hobgoblins and Bugbears as well as Goblins, but that is still a lot of different monsters. This allows the DM to craft a rich set of encounters even for low level characters including brutes, soldiers, casters, minions, leaders and more. This is a far cry from entering a room with 5 Goblins and a Bugbear, all with the same basic role and style of attack.

B000U7169M|3.0|\\"The Reaping\\" is for the most part a good supernatural/horror film..... That is until the last 20 minutes of the storyline went completely haywire and the over-the-top special effects & the \\"End of Days\\" type theme killed the movie.    The Pros: Hilary Swank does a fine acting job in this film. I also liked the initial theme of \\"The Reaping\\", where Swank's character, Katherine Winter, is a LSU theology professor who goes around debunking so called \\"religious phenomenon\\" with her partner as there is usually a scientific explanation(s) for the religious phenomenon being reported..... Hence, Swank's character along with the help of her partner are then able to debunk the \\"religious phenomenon\\". Then Swank's character along with her partner are called to the small town of Haven to solve a lot of inexplicable \\"religious phenomenon\\" that have the townsfolk upset. Just when you think that Swank's character along that of her partner are going to be able to debunk these \\"religious phenomenon\\" with scientific evidence, the complete reverse happens and we find that the \\"religious phenomenon\\" can not be debunked with scientific evidence.    The Cons: The last 20 minutes of \\"The Reaping\\" was bad. As I mentioned above, the storyline goes haywire towards the end and the special effects were way too over-the-top.
B000LV63SQ|5.0|Very fine listening.  Some of Pete's best melodies, the kind you can't get out of your head for days.
B0012E6R3W|4.0|Very good production. You can hear everything very clearly and in its place with very clear and strong tones. Same for mixing. Everything is in balance.<br /><br />Most of the writing is done by Chuck and Eric. In terms of song writing quality, do not expect a new The Gathering though. Although it has been several years since their last offering, the song writing feels like they have rushed a little bit. This does not mean that the album is bad, but rather there are no surprises. The songs mostly start and finish in the same way. This is pure thrash metal.<br /><br />Vocals of Chuck are there, in a few songs growling still. It is at the top. Riffs are thrash riffs. A lot of fast riffs. Nearly no mid tempo stuff. Fast as hell. Thanx to Eric's capabilities. Solos. Well Alex is back so no worries here. Very technical. No disappointment...<br /><br />As for the drumming; I know that Paul Bostaph is one of the best drummers around the metal scene. He is very good in terms of technicality. But the way he fills the songs, he tries to do a lot of work so the songs may not flow sometimes. If you listened to Slayer after Dave Lombardo till their last LP you now what I mean. Same as Shovel Headed Kill Machine of Exodus. The problem is that he tries to show himself, and I think that does not work. So this is a problem in the running of the songs but anyway, this is Testament... How bad they can get?<br /><br />Give the LP sometime. It simply grows on you. The more I listen, the more it gets better.<br /><br />ps. There's a Euro-version of the LP that includes a DVD. I always buy these special editions but for this release it is not a must. Behind the scene footage (average), photos... Nothing special here.<br /><br />Hey, and buy it, do not download it. Let the guys sell records. They are not Justin or Madonna. They need to SELL records in order to survive...
006135323X|4.0|While it is comforting to know that so many decisions are made on from irrational bases, it is discomforting to be made quite so aware of it.  No, I take that back: it is quite reassuring to know that while the principles of logic have their place, people are influenced by other factors.<br /><br />Professor Ariely explains some of the factors that influence our decisionmaking: from the influence of emotions to the sometimes agonising choice between options; the pitfalls of procrastination and the lure of free offers.  And why is it that we are often perfectly willing to do something for nothing, but not if payment is involved?  From the discussion of the creation of a market for black pearls through discussion of types of dishonesty, Professor Ariely provides insights into human behaviour, in many cases backed by experiments that have tested his hypotheses.<br /><br />This book is primarily focussed on behavioural economics, but I would argue that it would be of interest to a far wider group of readers.  We are all decisionmakers and our decisions impact on others.  I believe that many of us with a specific interest in public policy or management, in marketing, or in human behaviour more generally would find value in reading this book.  While many of the concepts are profound, the subject matter is presented in a readable and entertaining way.<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0670020745|4.0|I read this book in one afternoon and found it to be full of great insights into the brain and how we have the power to direct its impact on the life we want whether we've suffered a stroke or not.  The final chapters on choosing to live \\"right brained\\" are especially enlightening, but if I were looking for a primer on stroke recovery, this is \\"Stroke Therapy Lite.\\"  Nonetheless, her suggestions on how to be when working with stroke victims are very perceptive and I trust many hospitals/recovery centers will be changing protocols in this area.  Jill, in being given a second chance to do life right is indeed \\"being the change she wishes to see in the world.\\" (Gandhi)  We could all take her insights to heart.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|The Complete Matrix Trilogy (HD-DVD) simply put.....is awesome!  From the wild, but intriguing storyline, to the special effects, it's non-stop action and fun.  For me, The Matrix is the next Star Wars!
0345495004|5.0|This is a wonderful work for a first novel.  The author follows the basic history of Frank Lloyd Wright's life using her enlightened imagination to fill in the gaps with stunning success. Her characters are very well drawn and the action flows.
B0016K40KY|5.0|There are actually 4 versions of this movie on DVD:    1. Bare bones single disc version (don't bother; I agree with reviewer)  2. 2-disc limited edition (which has lots of extras but the film quality is not the best of the versions out there) - 2001 release  3. 2-disc superbit edition (which doesn't have the extras but the film quality is superior to the limited edition) - 2003 release (out of print but can get on amazon marketplace or ebay)  4. 2-disc collector's edition (which has the extras and the superbit version of the film which is an excellent version also) - 2008 release    Hope that helps.   PS - I would only recommend #3 or #4 as the film quality is better on these version than #1 or #2.
0783219695|5.0|Having worked at and retired from the Kennedy Space Center, this film most definitely satisfied my personal and professional needs for truth, accuracy, and realism in its creation.  Ron Howard did a masterful job of directing, and there was an obvious quest for excellence by all who participated in all aspects producing this fine film.<br /><br />I will not retell the story here, as it has been well-covered by dozens of excellent reviews.  But from the perspective of someone who actually is a \\"rocket scientist,\\" I can assure you of its veracity, which was enhanced by some of the filming locations, and most prominently by the actors who were cast in the various important roles.  Tom Hanks was at his finest here - the perfect casting, if you will, As Jim Lovell.  But even Tom was slightly upstaged by Kathleen Quinlan, a much under-rated and perhaps under-appreciated actress.  Bill Paxton was outstanding, and Kevin Bacon's was low-key excellence.  But the show may have been stolen by Ed Harris, whose casting in the role of Gene Kranz was a directorial coup-d'etat, as both his appearance and performance were flawless!<br /><br />While there was not a true weak link in the entire film, its realism was enough to send chills down the spines of those of us who have functioned at KSC.  Yes, there were some creative shots in the film, such as Gary Senise driving his Corvette dangerously close to the launch pad, which was impossible, but such \\"creativity\\" was held to an absolute minimum.  The entire story is graphic proof that truth is often much more impactful than the finest fiction.  Absolutely a keeper!
1423101464|5.0|I bought the book for my 13 year old son - this is another series he has read and loves it.  Again the only issue is he reads them too quickly! You cannot go wrong if your looking for something that holds a 13 year old boys interest.
B00005Q4CS|3.0|This film reminds me of Gaspar Noe's Irreversible, in that it's initially an assault on the senses, and you feel as if you've seen great filmmaking because of it.  When I revisisted Irreversible recently, I found out I'd been had.  Noe's film is just an assault on the senses with nothing in its core.  Aronofsky's film, while nowhere as overly graphic, sadistic or disgusting as Irreversible, has this same quality.<br /><br />As many have said here, the main message here is a very simplistic one, DRUGS ARE BAD.  It's almost on the level of an after school special, and that's a shame, as Aronofsky has a very good visual and editing style, but after nearly 2 hours of it, it's overkill.  I felt totally numbed after seeing this film.  I sat in my car afterwards, and I couldn't move.  But aside from the pure visceral experience of the film (which feels like a drug, the drugs the movie is telling us not to use), there isn't much left there.  There's some depth in Ellen Burstyn's character (she gives a great performance), but I believe that has to do with the fact this is based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s book.  If there is any humanism in this film, it's derived from the novel, not Aronofsky, who is like a kid with his new toy.  The characters of Leto and Connelly are especially bad, especially Connelly.  She is supposed to be a junkie, but she looks way too beautiful to be one.  Overall, the film is worth watching at least once, but it's essentially a visceral assault on your senses and little else.<br /><br />A funny sidenote...Before this film screened (I saw it in a theater), the theater was playing The Wallflowers's album Breach, which is one of my favorite albums of theirs.  After I recovered from this assault, I kept thinking about how wonderful and tuneful those songs were, and I pretty much forgot about Aronofsky's film (until I wrote this review).  I bought Breach, and it's one of my favorite albums.  Thanks, Darren...
0307265730|3.0|Jhumpa's new collection is pleasant reading alright but lacks the spark that was felt in her \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\". She constantly speaks of the routine culture shocks and thereafters of the bengalis from west bengal who migrated to the West. But I must say that the greater diaspora of the majority muslim bengalis and their struggles are all too absent. Also the hard life that the non-previldged bengalis of both varieties faced in the foreign lands are not strongly reflected.
1400096936|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. A ton of action based on what you could see as reality. Did this kind of thing really go down to this extent? Don Winslow doesn't let you put this book down from page one. Highly recommended!!
B00005NWM3|4.0|This CD makes NICKELBACK famous - worldwide. And i can only agree with other customers. It's still the best! The Real Thing - because of tracks like \\"HOW YOU REMIND ME\\" and my all-time favourite \\"TOO BAD\\". It hits you like a hammer! That are burners! Because of that 4* - The rest is trash!    All other albums haven't got a soul - every single repeats itself. In a very few moments Chad can get a hit (for example only in corporation WITH SANTANA \\"INTO THE NIGHT\\" 2007). But that's it! I LIKE NICKELBACK VERY MUCH, but every artist had TOP CLASS times - now (in 2008) it's going down... Mainstream - making money as much as you can...    WHEN YOU LIKE NICKELBACK AT IT'S BEST - TAKE THIS ONE... (from 2001). This album contains the hot stuff.    PS: Nickelback is a very good live-band too! I can only say watch on YouTube NICKELBACK \\"TOO BAD\\" or \\"HOW YOU REMIND ME\\" LIVE AT >>ROCK AM RING<< 2004 - Eifel, Nuerburgring - (FESTIVAL IN GERMANY) and you know what i mean...
B000SFJWLU|5.0|I just attended the Mayhem Festival in KS with my 6yr old where we saw FFDP, Disturbed, and of course SLIPKNOT and let me tell you they all rock, plain and simple.  I tire of reading reviews that try to go into the lyrics or the musical arrangements of bands, I got it those who do such are prodigys (sarcasm).  I have listened to all forms of metal and music since I was a kid (I am now 36) and I always go back to metal as a favorite due to its energy and these guys have energy.  I am not looking to be inspired by their lyrics or have a musical epiphany.  I just like it for what it is and I dont think people who like it for whatever reason are stupid or devoid of musical taste.  Those who insult those who would like this genre of music are the ones I despise for they are truly the ones who would believe their opinions matter.  If one has such an aversion to this band and those who listen to drool; got an idea let us hear your band.  ENJOY THIS BAND FOR WHAT IT IS; JUST GOOD HARDCORE METAL:)
1402210795|4.0|Friday's Child is the perfect introduction to anyone who wants to give Heyer a try. Can a book just be too cute for words? Friday's Child is definitely a \\"cute\\" read with lovely characters and a story that had me laughing from beginning to end. There are no undercover spies or evil villains popping up to do the hero and heroine in. This is simply a story about a man who marries a childhood friend for convenience. The fun in reading is seeing him come to his senses as he falls in love with his precious wife.<br /><br />Lord Anthony Sheringham has decided it is time for him to marry and he believes he has found the right woman. Her name is Bella Milbourne and she has been nicknamed the Incomparable by the Ton. Sheringham, or Sherry, as his close friends call him, has known Bella since they were children. He loves her, or so he tricks himself into believing. If Bella marries him, he will come into his inheritance and out from under the thumb of his uncle who he can't stand. Bella holds Sherry in great affection but turns him down because she longs for another. Sherry's pride is hurt and promises to marry the first woman he sees, which happens to be a very young, penniless orphan, Hero Wantage.<br /><br />Hero is very starry eyed around Sherry, ever since they were children, and she thinks he is so very perfect. Sherry puffs up whenever he is around Hero because she praises his various virtues.<br /><br />When Hero tells Sherry she is about to be cast out from her aunt's house and must either become a governess or marry the horrid local curate, Sherry decides to save Hero and marry her himself! Sherry has always gotten along very well with Hero and will take care of her as long as she doesn't cling to him to him too much and allows him the same freedom he had when he was a bachelor. Sherry gives Hero a new nickname, of Kitten since she reminds him of one.<br /><br />Soon Sherry marries Hero. Sherry doesn't keep Hero hidden away, and even introduces her to his various other bachelor friends. Sherry's friends are a very friendly sort and they welcome Hero into their group with open arms. Things couldn't be better, until, Sherry bring Hero to London where she feels so out of place. And, because of that she makes some mistakes in society's eyes and tends to embarrass Sherry. (It doesn't help that she points out a past mistress of Sherry's to everyone) Plus, when Sherry's friend George, Lord Wrotham seems a bit too close for comfort with Hero, Sherry becomes jealous. He is not sure what to do with his Kitten who keeps finding herself in certain scrapes. Hero just wants to help George, who is in love with Bella, but Bella plays with his emotions. Soon there are rumors running all over the place about George and Hero, and Sherry is ready to duel his friend over Hero's affections.<br /><br />Friday's Child is a wonderful tale of regency England by master storyteller, Georgette Heyer. I could not stop laughing at the antics of Sherry and Hero as they try to come to terms as a new married couple. I found myself laughing too many times to count and I wanted to smack Sherry over the head because it took him forever to finally realize he loves Hero as a woman and not just his friend. Friday's Child is a lovely book with some slapstick comedy that would be wonderful to see on the big screen. If you are a fan of regencies with great comedy and endearing characters, Friday's Child is the book for you!<br /><br />Katiebabsriends are a very friendly sort and they welcome Hero into their group with open arms.

B000002KDG|5.0|If you like Neil, this is one of his best, hands down. Star Wars roadies, huge speaker setups, classic songs both acoustic and electric. Probably the pinnacle of Rock & Roll. Buy this immediately if your a Neil fan. 5 STARS!!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|CLOVERFIELD boasts a grade Z cast of unknown actors in an attempt, I expect, not only to save money but also to keep a low profile with the fanboy set, for it's not like photographers crowding around a Johnny Depp set, is it, there are almost 100 per cent nobodies in the cast.  Wonder if any of them will be able to get a job on the back of this film--I hope so, since no one is really bad, except for the jackass holding the camera, who proves that whatever Seth Rogen has, he's not sharing it with his peers. I looked up his name in the credits, says it's \\"T. J. Miller,\\" the sort of name female impersonators in the 50s used to go by to confuse nightclub patrons.  But he plays \\"Hud,\\" and otherwise steers clear of the androgynous spirit, always playing the big dumb guy so, he's consistent.  No one's superbad, ha ha, and a few of the actors actually rise to the challenge and give it a go.<br /><br />The best known actor, Mike Vogel, does a \\"Janet Leigh\\" here, which must have confounded all Vogel fans who paid good hard money to get into the theater!  How'd you like it if, when you paid $12 to see a Jim Carrey movie, and then you find out that after 15 minutes, Jim Carrey's off somewhere else doing another movie?  I'd be annoyed, but luckily for most of us that's around when we start getting glimpses of the hideous monster devouring Manhattan and the thrills and chills start exploding left and right!<br /><br />Vogel is great by the way, and I am sure he'll go on to better parts, hopefully longer ones too.  Maybe for his next movie he could come in for the last 20 minutes and people will be glad to see him--maybe a remake of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN sort of thing?
014303961X|1.0|I wasted my money and time on this book. It was a painful read. It was boring, dry and not very entertaining. How in the world did this book get turned into a movie. I hope the movie is a lot better than the book. I will find out.

This recording with some of his genius friends is a wonderful collection of Ray's songs but with a SACD twist.  SACD makes this just like you are sitting in a caf&eacute; listening to Ray and watch him move his head from side to side.  Showman?  He was among the top and it will take a whole lot to topple him.

B0000DJZ8R|5.0|I love this movie and have to admit I enjoy it more than the book.  The book is about too preachy for me, but the movie focuses on the story and clarifies it.  An amazing achievement for all involved and Henry Fonda probably had his greatest performance in this picture.  John Ford, Gregg Toland and others involved with this picture did a fine job.  Jane Darwell gives a wonderful performance as Ma Joad.  A classic.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought the blu-ray version, I'm running it on a Sharp blu-ray DVD player, and it's gorgeous. Exactly what I was expected. The narration is very well suited, the script is on, and the visuals are really compelling.<br /><br />What you get is a beautiful documentary, scenes, landscapes, a lot of animals, great to look at, very easy to watch. There's no plot. It doesn't grab you. It's not a suspense thriller. Just a tour of natural beauty on earth.<br /><br />That's what I wanted, that's what I got.

I have read several fanficition books, and this one is very good. It is an interesting version and has a bit of a twist. It is in a modern setting and it is truly easy to feel with the narrator and envision the settings. It is a fun and quick read!
B0013V33DG|5.0|This is an outstanding video of a wonderful production of this enjoyable opera. The concept is delightful and the performances are magnificent.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I do not know how I missed this movie, talk about flying in under the radar.  It is very well done with oustanding visuals and some great acting by Christian Bale.  For those that keep referring to this film as a Matrix rip off it needs to stop.  If everyone walking around in trench coats is considered Matrix like then there are quite a few movies to add to the list.      The story starts full speed with the movie that plagues the people of their emotions a brainwash if you will coupled with a drug taken periodically to tranquilize you emotions.  Then moves quickly to the task force that disposes of \\"sense offenders\\", basically people that have feeings.  The society the task force is trying to preserve is one of no emotion.  This no emotion society is supposed to be a cure for anger, hatred, grief, sadness, sorrow etc. all the thing that caused the WWIII that these people survived.  Through the processing(killing) of the sense offenders you get to see a very unique gun visual.  The technique is called \\"gun-kata\\" and it is a fighting style that maximizes movement and angles to interpret your assailants moves as well as giving optimum angle for your attack to inflict the most possible damage.  See it once and you will definitely think that is the coolest thing ever.  After the awe factor of \\"gun-kata\\" wears off our lead Bale forgets to take some of his tranquilizer and soon starts feeling emotion again.  He continues down this path of feeling and soon leads a revolution.  I won't throw in spoilers because I want everyone to see the film and find out the outcome.    Outstanding movie, perfect fit for Bale and full of action with a mind provoking story line as well.  Highly recommended for fans of darker sci fi settings and anyone who likes John Woo action films, because it is full of two pistol firing mayhem.  A must see for Bale fans he is phenomenal in this performance.
0756404746|5.0|I've been an avid fantasy reader for years and have often observed that even though personal tastes are completely subjective, there are a number of points that authors must hit/avoid in order create a truly magical masterpiece.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but in my opinion they are:    1. Magic must make sense - we all grew up fantasizing about mysteries and miracles, and although a lifetime of scientific education proved most of them impossible, fantasy books give us a much needed escape from reality and in most cases physics.  Nevertheless I am only willing to suspend my disbelief so much, so when a writer asserts that in his world some people can levitate without providing rationale for those abilities, I can only accept so much.  Even magic must have rules and authors have to follow them throughout the story.      2. Super Human With No Equal Syndrome - even Superman had kryptonite, but many authors forget that making their hero all powerful and invincible takes away layers of complexity. The same applies when heroes gain their abilities overnight without having to really work for it. After all natural talent can only give you so much.    3. Protagonist /Antagonist Complexity - I believe there are no truly evil people just as there are no truly saintly ones, therefore creating a completely immoral antagonist or virtuous protagonist can only come out fake. Many authors believe that by portraying their anti-hero as a baby-killing-world-destroying-money-grabbing degenerate overcompensates for glaring plot holes.  A person is molded from childhood by years of positive and negative reinforcements and the aftermath of those experiences is what we see before us in his adult version. So I find it unpleasant when the author expects us to blindly accept his vision for a character without providing any background or reason for such iniquity.    4. Balance between storytelling and other attributes - many authors believe that by either adding too much action or erotic (this is the new trend I've been noticing) scenes, they make their books edgy and entertaining. Wrong. I am not a fan of prolonged narratives and overly flowery speech, but reading page after page of filler material just can't pass for literature. When all these elements are combined properly - you get magic and the author's vision unravels before your eyes.      This is getting quite long so I guess I'll stop the count and move on to the actual review. The Name of the Wind is the first book in Patrick Rothfuss's first trilogy series. Through a series of events, a famous Chronicler stumbles upon an ordinary innkeeper whose life story has been told and retold, embellished and understated and who is believed to be long dead. His name, Kvothe, has been feared, admired and glorified by both high and mighty as well as lowly and poor. The Chronicler convinces Kvothe to tell the truth of his legendary exploits - the story that is to be completed in three days. In this part of the tale, Kvothe tells of his difficult childhood, the path that eventually lead him to the University. Kvothe is extraordinarily bright and determined with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and an ever present painful mystery surrounding his parents' murder. The interesting traits in Kvothe's character are that he is both audacious (sometimes bordering on aggressive) and at the same time incredibly generous and kind. The struggles he went through just to survive on the streets as a young child have made him suspicious and resilient without taking away his empathy and humility.  But at the University was where his real troubles finally began since Kvothe found himself playing in the wide sea full of dangerous predators rather then a small pond he was used to.     I think Patrick Rothfuss created a truly remarkable story. His writing style is very unique and he cleverly alternated between present-day and flashbacks into Kvothe's past. Kvothe is special but in no way omnipotent. His youth and inexperience show in his actions and behavior, but throughout the book you observe the progression of his character to eventually grow into the mythical man he has become. There is a good balance of tragedy, humor, romance and action to tantalize any taste. A highly recommended read.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|A secretary's allusion to McLuhan four years before the publication of UNDERSTANDING MEDIA has been cited as a rare anachronism in this meticulous reproduction of 1960.  Aside from one editing glitch (involving a woman's cigarette that is held upward then lapward then upward a number of times), my main \\"glitch watch\\" observation surrounds a home-movie camera that is treated like a videocamera:  lacking intense lights clamped to chairs for indoor shooting, lacking the need to hand-wind the film every few feet, or lacking the whir of a motor.      (It's also a kick to see Angel's karate-wheeling son emerge here as a lesser corporate demon.  Perhaps Season 3 can link up his character with his own long-lost brother, played by Wil Wheaton.)    This series's main competition for Emmy awards is the excellent DAMAGES.  But depraved nastiness is an easy staple for cable shows, while the intricacy of MAD MEN (without excessive, facile cussing and with a minimum of wish-fulfillment fantasy sequences) sets it apart from the conventions of even the best of television dramas.     The series is just about as fantastic as it lauds itself for being, on the commentaries.  Its creator \\"loves\\" everything, and other commentary participants slobber big wet kisses on each other--as has become a tradition in disk packages of this kind.  Clearly deserved for costuming and set design, also appropriate for writing and performances, yes; but pointing out parallel themes (a la THE WIRE) is a frequent achievement of greater value.    Some of the technical commentaries (notably on costuming, producing, editing, directing) are as good as any \\"field trip\\" classes I took in grad school, with production personnel at various Manhattan television stations.  Film teachers would do well to assign these commentaries at any level of \\"film production\\" instruction.    This, however, is countered by the endless redundancy of Elizabeth Moss who, as Peggy Olsen, does a good acting job but, on the commentaries,finds a dozen ways to repeat the same simplistic idea ... over and over and over and over throughout many, many episodes.  It's nice to have so many commentaries on the disks, but this actress's vacuous chatter is too often used as filler.  She is clearly the production's mascot, but her additions to commentaries for Season 2 should be edited judiciously.    Immediately after watching these 13 episodes about the ad industry in 1960, I viewed MADISON AVENUE (1962) with Dana Andrews as a somewhat older, less complicated clone of Dan Draper, a love interest named Peggy, a Joan-like secretary named Miss Olsen, the actor who later played Larry Tate from BEWITCHED here performing the role of a precursor of Tate, and even the line \\"You haven't thought this through.\\"  Hardcore MAD MEN addicts might enjoy this strangely uncynical addition to the PATTERNS, GRAY FLANNEL, EXECUTIVE SUITE, HOW TO SUCCEED, WALL STREET genre.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|It is so obvious that this miniseries is trying to portray John Adams (Paul Giamatti) in the best possible light, as if he's the most enlightened man in the movement for rule of law, racial equality, and political correctness. It completely downplays his viewpoints (and those of slave owner Thomas Jefferson, who built Monticello with slave labor) that would send any modern feminist or Marxist critic into a tizzy. Because this miniseries is so worried about offending people, it comes across as disingenuous, plodding, and inconsequential -- the perfect Sunday night soporific for HBO viewers who want to be lulled into complacent sleep before starting their harried work weeks. The relationship between John and Abigail Adams (Laura Linney) is passionless and arid, as if their marriage rested solely on chats about democratic ideals and legal principles. Ultimately, there is no insight on Adams as a person. We see each episode of his life, in dry serialistic form, but the series portrays him not as a man, but more as a historical ideal.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Be prepared--this is not your typical serial killer/forensic show.  Dexter is the new anti-hero--a serial killer who hunts other serial killers. As a little boy, Dexter's father identified his son's sociopathic symptoms and carefully trained the boy to channel his killing streak with a rigorous \\"code\\" that allows Dexter to kill only when the target is identified as a monster--a monster like him.<br /><br />Yet despite his grisly hobby, Dexter is oddly appealing. His avowed lack of feeling is contradicted by his actions to please and care for his family members. In flashbacks it is clear that his pragmatic father loved and accepted him. The storyline implies that this loving relationship was the factor that allowed Dexter to develop control of his vicious tendencies. Not only is he a model citizen, he is the perfect boyfriend--he does the dishes, packs the kids lunches and he takes out the \\"trash\\", which includes his girl-friend's stalker ex-husband.<br /><br />Dexter's day job is working with the police doing blood spatter analysis where he accepts his inappropriate colleague's quirks with a clueless civility. His blunt honesty and concrete thinking provide droll moments as normals struggle to fit Dexter's slightly off-key conversation into their idea of who he is.  It is particularly amusing when he blandly tolerates bawled insults from a perpetually enraged colleague. Dexter finds humanity puzzling and his interactions comically illustrate his observation that \\"normal people are so hostile.\\"<br /><br />Dexter's painstaking observance of his father's code provides a profile of his targets, killers so foul that the viewer is craving their elimination long before the cautious Dexter has completed a plan to eliminate the latest monster. The level of tension in each amusing yet suspenseful episode is expertly crafted.<br /><br />The psychological brilliance and complexity of the show is superior. It cleverly illustrates the eternal problems of dominance and violence and their effect on humanity. When Dexter conducts an inner dialog about not fitting in or not having as much fun as other people, the viewer can identify with him--most of us have felt similar insecurities. Ultimately Dexter becomes a very appealing character because not only do we identify with his alienation but his righteous, if illegal, execution of human monsters provides a primal sense of gratification.<br /><br />Each episode is well crafted and brilliantly enacted by the excellent cast. This is the first TV series that I have sat down and watched over and over again. I can't wait for the second season to come out on DVD!hen Dexter conducts an inner dialog about not fitting in or not having as much fun as other people, the viewer can identify with him--most of us have felt similar insecurities.

0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore turned the comic medium on its head with this series. The characters are human and the story really makes you think about balance in the universe between right and wrong. There is alot of symbolism and iconic references to the end of times as our masked heroes try to find out who is behind the impending war that threatens mankind. Believe the hype, the ending alone is worth the $20 you spend on the book. Brilliant.
B000W9EOEC|5.0|Homework, Human After All, and Discovery have all been great or at least mediocre by most peoples standards, but each has had problems. With Alive though, it makes everything song a little be of everything that everybody likes. Another great attribute to this album while you can just choose a song and just listen to that single one, it is so easy just get lost and go through the whole song because of the melting of one song into the another. The album essentially feels as if you are listing to song filled with everything. The album starts of with the simplicity of Robot Rock and just glides so effortlessly into Television Rules the Nation. After hitting up Cresendolls on the journey, you have been so sucked up into the music you have hit every hit they have ever had. What one realized after listening to this album is that there is only one way that Daft Punk could ever make there songs better, by taking two or three great songs and meshing them together into the awesomeness that is Alive!
B00005JPY0|5.0|When Batman Begins (2005) reenergized the franchise with its dark, brooding vision and Zen beginnings, it looked like the followup could be primed for even better results.  The higher expectations have not only been met, but are exceeded in The Dark Knight. Featuring a diabolical performance by the late Heath Ledger, this is a terrific film that takes the franchise to darker places, and it is a milestone in comic adaptations and certain to alter the course of such films in the future.      An elaborate bank heist is engineered by the ruthless Joker who is stealing from and toying with the mobsters of Gotham City.  Batman (Christian Bale), the caped crusader, watches over the city aiding police Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman).  Although Batman is an outcast in society, his true identity is billionaire Bruce Wayne, Gotham's revered benefactor.  A new `face' in the form of District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), has arrived to clean up crime.  Dent is a supremely confident, dynamic `white knight' who means business, and he is dating Wayne's former love, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal).  As Wayne Enterprise's Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) upgrades his armor and weaponry, Batman must confront the Joker, who consolidates his power and rule over Gotham's mobs and begins to target city officials including Dent for assassination.  When Dent sets himself as bait for The Joker, Batman must chase down and save the district attorney and Rachel from certain death.  Meanwhile, a new villain emerges from an unlikely source.  Racing against time, Batman is forced into a life and death choice, and he must decide if he should make a sacrifice that will forever change the course of Gotham's heroic avenger.     Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Momento) in arguably his most accomplished work, this mature, psychological movie takes its themes seriously and weaves subplots upon subplots.  For instance, how does a group of people respond when its morality and survival instincts are tested to the limit?  You may be surprised and thrilled by the answers. The plot twists are so numerous, you wonder, `am I really watching an action picture?' By the end, the franchise is launched into a new, uncertain direction.  Bravo to the filmmakers for not playing it safe.      Whenever Ledger is onscreen, he is simply terrific.  There is not one false note or boring moment as he lights up the screen. With his body language, every inflection and facial expression all working in concert to create a horrifying persona, he is so convincing, you cannot imagine that it is Heath Ledger. He is complemented, as are the other leads, with a well written script full of memorable lines.  This Joker is a far cry from previous incarnations (Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson) of the clown prince of crime.  When Wayne tries to fathom The Joker's motivations, Alfred counsels him and states, \\"Some men want to watch the world burn.\\" This Joker is grounded in real evil and is thus all the more menacing.  We get bits and pieces of Joker's sordid, traumatic past, which are totally credible in explaining his origins. Essentially an urban terrorist, he threatens the innocent and causes them to live in fear, and he kills with no remorse. There is no logic to his acts, and yet he is a brilliant, clever strategist.  Batman follows his own set of rules, but must he sink to Joker's level in order to combat him?      If The Joker is like the devil, then Batman is almost a Christ-like figure, one with self doubt and who is willing to protect the innocent even if it means taking on or absorbing the sins and pain of the world around him.  Christian Bale continues to impress by portraying dual characters (Bruce Wayne/Batman) effectively and playing off the likes of Freeman and Caine, who make the most of their supporting roles.  Eckhart is convincing as Dent, a role much more developed and utilized than in Batman Forever. Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes) does quite well as Wayne's former flame.  Oldman is very good as Gordon which is quite the change of pace from having previously played evil villains (JFK).  In fact, Oldman, Freeman, and Caine form the moral compass of the film.     With a talented cast bringing well rounded characters to the screen, Nolan keeps things grounded and never loses track of his story.  A Gotham car chase and Hong Kong escape are breathtaking sequences yet wholly believable.  You don't think of anything as computer generated or overdone, which is remarkable in this age of special effects. Are you listening Michael Bay (Armageddon, Con Air)?  There are several well composed shots that are iconic and haunting. The hardware is eye-catchy including the Batmobile and a scooter like none you've ever seen.  Pacing is methodical but it seems a bit choppy and jumpy by cramming in so much narrative material into a 2.5 hour running time.  The camerawork is at times quite fluid and dazzling by enhancing the mood or (in The Joker's case) madness.      There are a couple of moments that are a bit misleading or confusing such as an assassination attempt that may have claimed a key character's life.  And the villain's fate is sort of, how shall I put this, left hanging?  But these are tiny quibbles in a film vastly richer than any comic book adaptation (Spiderman 2 and Iron Man are in this elite company) to date.   Rated PG-13, this is essentially an R rated film in spirit and not for younger children.  It is creepy and sustains an overall dark, violent mood throughout.  Go see The Dark Knight for a multi-layered story that challenges and surprises. Go see the wonderful acting and writing led by maestro Nolan. But most of all go see a burst of genius that was Ledger's brilliant, last hurrah.

0446402389|5.0|CHILD 44 is based on the real-life Russian mass-murderer, Andrei Chikatilo, whose capture may have been hindered by the Soviet Union's portrayal of such crimes as being non-existent in the USSR.<br /><br />The protagonist of the novel is Leo Demidov who is an investigator for the MGB (the heir to the NKVD). It is his job to ferret out the traitors rampant in Soviet society, whether they're guilty or not. He is an extremely idealistic man and is willing to use torture for the overall good. But when he discovers that a veterinarian he has been hunting is guilty of nothing more than treating the dog of an official at the American embassy, he begins to have second thoughts. Then he is asked to investigate his wife.<br /><br />It takes a while for Smith to get to the child murders. He needs to show what conditions were like under Stalin, he needs to introduce the villain (not the serial killer), and he needs to show the murderer luring children into his spider web. Readers should pay close attention to the beginning as it will be important later in the book. You will need to read it over regardless but at least you'll know where to find the pertinent information.<br /><br />Smith employs various twists and turns, but I especially liked how he transitioned Demidov from MGB operative to lowly member of the militia who begins to investigate the child murders. It looks like Demidov will never succeed as every clue seems to turn into a dead end. Meanwhile a former colleague (the villain) is tracking him and his wife down. If he is discovered, they both will be summarily shot. There is also a love story of sorts. Demidov's wife, Raisa, never did love him. She married him because he was a MGB operative; she was afraid not to. So, as they search for the killer, they gradually begin to know each other as people. At one point she argues that a truck driver who is taking them to Rostov, a town they think may be the killer's home territory, should be killed to cover their trail. But it's a test. Raisa wants to know if Leo really has changed.<br /><br />Some may think the ending is a little bit convenient since it leaves room for a sequel, but if there is one, I'll be the first in line to buy it.ts to know if Leo really has changed.

1593352816|5.0|I have read the paperback several times and tried to enjoy the movies made from this story (without success).  My eyesight did not allow me to read paperbacks for many years, so I compromised by getting the MP-3 version and found it to be exactly to my liking.  The reader was well chosen and the whole thing came together really great on one single MP-3 disk.  Even though this is one of Dean Koontz's earlier stories, it was certainly well written with his usual excellence in character development.  His main characters were very sharp, but did slip up in taking a long time to communicate with yes/no answers.  This single point seemed to me a little out of character for them, but it did not distract from the story in the slightest.<br /><br />It would be great if they would print a hardback version.  I would buy it in a heartbeat just to have the enjoyment of reading it again for myself.  I just like the people in the book.  They are interesting without being overly heroic or dramatic  - mostly just people who anyone might know in any neighborhood.  Their interactions with one another make the book  - not the mean and horror segments.  The horror is there only to fulfill the story  - NOT to make the story.  The main characters do that very well.<br /><br />Of course, Dean Koont's storytelling is not for everyone; but, if you enjoy this type story, this is a really good one.

B001CDNL78|5.0|CSNY (as opposed to the more manageable CSN), while a great live band, has always had trouble getting it together in the studio.  Even the classic Deja Vu had problems with overproduction, and the two other studio albums with the full lineup were disappointments (though I feel that Looking Forward remains underrated).  The only official live album, Four Way Street, had its momements, but suffers from poor sound quality on the electric sides and lack of unity on the acoustic sides.  So...  is this, their second live album, the best CSNY album, as Neil Young says?  I say YES!  It's a real, unfixed live album that rocks and has plenty of energy, but the huge advancements in live sound and technology (plus the lack of drugs) make it a far better album than Four Way Street.  I would even put it again of the original Deja Vu.  If you ever loved the energy that the electric CSNY had with songs like Ohio and Woodstock (neither which made the cut here), then this is the album for you.  The passion and conviction of the mostly political material just make it more compelling.  Oh yeah, and if Neil Young had a right to sing Ohio in the early 70's, he certainly has a right to sing Shock and Awe now.  As an American living, working in Japan, with a Japanese family, do I have no right to comment on Japanese politics?  If you can't understand how ignorant this \\"you must be a citizen to have an opinion on the politics of the country you live in\\" is, then you need to open your eyes.  Besides, if you can't handle political music, you were never a true fan of these guys to begin with.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I'm usually not a big fan of gay movies, not b/c I'm straight b/c I'm not, but because of my experiences with gay movies in the past.  Most gay movies are stereotypical in some way or another. The usually tell story's about how LGBT people did, do or will behave.    This movie was quite different.  The movie actually had actors and actresses that could, um.....ACT! Straight or gay in real life is so unimportant especially when you can pull it off like these guys(and girls).  Shelter didn't just concentrate on another gay person coming out; but about everyone else in his life also.  Great movie!
0156034026|4.0|What I liked about this book goes beyond the concrete issues everyone seems to belabor, like the war and the stereotypes of America that Changez constantly refers to.  I love the book's (or Hamid's) ideas that transcend these, like the notion of nostalgia, or the analogy of a power having such force that we might, under its wings, turn against our roots.  Exeriences like these come in all shapes and levels of complexity, and many of us have had them, whether we know it or not.  I also found Hamid's style compelling (although the monologue sometimes felt like a cop-out; I've never been a fan of the second person narration, no matter who the 2nd person is, reader or otherwise). His directness reminded me of Coehlo's in The Alchemist, where the analysis is spelled out in such a way that the reader might not have to think; but, really, we DO think.  In fact, the spelling out provokes us to contemplate beyond the page or the story, to a more personal and richer analysis. Changez states clearly that Erica suffered from nostalgia and that he, too, suffers from the same affliction.  Juxtapose those feelings with his company's focus on fundamentals.  What a great discussion!  How does nostalgia inform our present condition?  How dangerous is it?  How healthy?  All sorts of provocative questions and discussions can derive from the simple foundation Hamid lays out for us.     Also, Changez's very sudden change of heart about America and about his homeland is revealed clearly and, for some readers, unrealistically.  Changez even comments on his surprise that it took so long for him to get to such a powerful point of perspective.  The story line takes us on that same long journey, and just as abruptly as he is, the reader is seized by this change of heart.  The mystification in which Changez was paralyzed was created by a greater force that, on realization, was suddenly so obvious to him.  It does not matter if his transformation (or change) is realistic or not - what matters iswhat we, as readers, do with it.    I am curious about a previous reviewer's comment that the story flows and is fun to read (I agree), but that the BOOK is not to be praised as much as the author.  I don't agree, but I see the point.  Some other, less sophisticated comments suggest that it was a wasteful read, especially after discovering Hamid's purpose for writing.  That's sad: good books and good readers need not have the author's personal history or intention in mind to fully embrace an opinion, an analysis, or a likeness of a story, even a National Bestseller.

B001C08RHA|5.0|Wow, what a ride! Iron Man is a blast from beginning to end. I'll give a brief plot description for anyone who is not familiar with the comic book:<br /><br />WARNING: SPOILERS<br />Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.)  is an American arms dealer who is fabulously wealthy and lives the high life. Girls, booze, parties, he does it all. Standing by his side and cleaning up his various messes is his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Whispering dark thoughts in his ear is his partner Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) who you know from the beginning is just not okay.<br /><br />Tony goes to Afghanistan to demonstrate Stark Industries' new weapon, the Jericho missile. His convoy is attacked, his American soldier escorts are killed, and he is seriously wounded by shrapnel from one of his very own bombs. He passes out and wakes up as a captive in a Taliban-like camp. His captors want him to make them a Jericho missile, and he is horrified to see that they have a huge stockpile of Stark weapons. How did they acquire them?<br /><br />With the help of surgeon & fellow captive Dr. Yinsen, Stark makes his first Iron Man suit instead of making the Jericho missile. Using the suit he escapes and creates a big scene that attracts the attention of the U.S. military. He is rescued by the Air Force and returns home. During Stark's escape, the first Iron Man suit is all but destroyed.<br /><br />Back in the States, Stark builds a sharp new Iron Man suit, and goes back to Afghanistan to rescue Dr. Yinsen's village from the terrorist group that had captured him. The military can't figure out what Stark is, so two F-22 Raptors are called to intercept him. He inadvertently damages one of the planes but saves the pilot. Stark then confesses to his Air Force buddy LC James Rhodes (Terence Howard) that he was the cause of the accident. In addition to playing with his new toy and messing with the military, Stark is also determined to find out why the \\"bad guys\\" have so many of his company's weapons.<br /><br />He unravels the mystery with the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries. His partner, Obadiah Stane is not pleased and comes up with a suit of his own; he becomes \\"Iron Monger.\\" You can guess what happens, but suffice it to say the final battle scene between them is everything it should be.<br /><br />My husband dragged me to see this movie, and I ended up absolutely loving it. Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as always; he is one of those actors that your eye is naturally drawn to while he's on screen. The rest of the cast is very good in support of him. The score is fantastic too (I have already downloaded both \\"Merchant of Death\\" and \\"Driving With the Top Down\\" into my iPod).<br /><br />Remember: Tony Stark is a grown-up superhero and this is a grown-up action movie. A good bit of it  takes place in a war zone, and there is plenty of violence and some torture. Of course it is necessary to the plot, but you should be aware that this may not be the best movie for small children.<br /><br />Bottom line: Iron Man is a blast of a movie that manages to touch on some real issues we are facing today, but never becomes preachy about it. LOTS of fun, a rollercoaster ride, a rocking action movie with a sense of humor. Loved it, and can't wait til the DVD is released!!h the help of Pepper Potts and decides he needs to change the mission of Stark Industries.

B00005JPY0|5.0|It's easy to imagine Batophiles, like myself, experiencing nirvana when watching \\"The Dark Knight:\\" director Christopher Nolan and his sibling writing partner Jonathon deftly weave in influences from Batman tales spun from the likes of Alan Moore, Frank Miller and the team Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale.  Tidbits from \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" \\"The Killing Joke\\" and \\"The Long Halloween\\" find their way into the narrative, and long-time fans can spend many early morning hours dissecting all the homages from past scribes of the caped crusader.  And it's that respect and admiration for the legacy of the Batman character that powers \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  No mere hodgepodge of all the material that predated it, this film instead draws strength from Batman's rich legacy, marshalling all the weight of nearly 80 years of literary gold (and not the previous movies in the fanchise, sans \\"Begins\\") to create a movie of undiluted power and astounding resonance.  It's all there: the Gotham mob seeking to maintain control on the city's infrastructure, a disease of corruption that infects into the police force, legal system and corporate boardrooms and that fearsome angel of vengeance known as Batman, who tirelessly protects the city from destroying itself.  34 year old Christian Bale, reprising his role as Batman, digs deeper than anyone has ever dared dreamed, finding the wounded soul of a traumatized boy who's stoically willing pay the cost to shoulder the stinking sins and nightmarish horrors of a city gone to hell; no matter how high the cost to himself.    But Batman's good intentions backfire.  At first, all seems well, as the mob is running scared from a police force led by the straight-backed Lt. Jim Gordon (a stupendous Gary Oldman, who makes virtue look cool) and a bull-dozing new DA named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart, given the trickiest role as a righteous man doomed to fall), flanked by Bruce Wayne's old flame Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gylennhall, replacing Katie Holmes).  The besieged mob, desperate, turns to the anti-batman, a gleefully anarchic and sadistic psychopath who sees pure moral and ethical chaos as the only true way to live.  Everything else is a sick joke.  In other words, they turned to the Joker.  As played by the late Heath Ledger, this Joker makes Jack Nicholson look tame, even cuddly.  He smears his face with moldy looking make-up, talks with a sneering croak, tells contradictory stories of how he got his ghastly facial scars and works hard to convince everyone that he a loose cannon reacting instead of planning in advance to events around him, all evidence to the contrary.  This isn't so much the anti-batman as the anti-christ manifested as a hysterically happy bringer of existential terrorism and destruction.  As for Ledger, in his last complete role, he turns a performance as the Joker that ranks with the finest performances, by anyone, anywhere, in history.    From there, \\"The Dark Knight\\" begins a crescendo of operatic intensity, masterfully orchestrated by Nolan, who here stakes a claim as the best director of his generation.  He chronicles a struggle not just for the turf of Gotham City but for its very soul, and you'll be riveted at the sheer amount of directorial skill Nolan amasses to accomplish this.  The Joker seeks to tear down all that Batman, Gordon, Dent and Bruce Wayne's parents have fought and died for.  Gotham and its knights of all shades are pushed to the limit, facing the prospect of compromising their own souls and ethics to stop the demonic jester from hell.  No character will emerge unscathed, some will perish and evil won't be defeated entirely.  It's a rousing, complex and emotionally draining ride.  But we wouldn't have Batman any other way.

This version is in the latter group.  It's AWFUL.  Sometimes you only get half a screen, other times the text is different sizes.  It has no table of contents for navigation.

B001BSQ8TW|5.0|Quite simply stated, this is the greatest example of propaganda in the history of film making.    Leni Riefenstahl's masterpiece, Triumph of the Will is a cinematic milestone.  Set aside your preconceptions, notions of political correctness, kick back with some nachos and enjoy the spectacle, pageantry, patriotism and just plain ole unmitigated evil of a bygone era. Yes, this is THE \\"documentary\\" of the events of the Sixth Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in 1934, featuring a cast of thousands, mind blowing special effects, and show stopping musical numbers, as well as (of course) Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels, Hess, Goering and assorted other Nazi superstars of the day.     Get caught up in the wackiness as Hitler and Goebbels lead the German people around like neutered sheep on Thorazine.  The brilliant camera work and editing, ratchet up the tension incrementally from the opening marches and speeches to the closing ones, creating a yearning and semi-religious awe for the realization of the full spectrum dominance of Nazi ideology.     The legendary cinematic genius Leni Riefenstahl creates in the viewer an irresistible excitement over the images of mindless obedience to patently psychotic leaders and vulgar nationalistic narcissism. But politics aside, one can't help but admire the energy and skill that went into this classic; the sweeping vision and the insight that are meant to lead the audience to an epiphany.  Triumph of the Will pays off in sheer entertainment value despite the cliff-hanger ending.

B0010YWZOY|1.0|After reading many many reviews, I purchased the unrated Korean version, thinking it would have less editing.  Totally the opposite.  I would have a hard time rating this \\"R\\".  It is more like \\"PG\\".  The only reason it wouldn't be \\"G\\" is that there was a tiny bit of blood and I think I saw three breasts.  Having seen the film in 1979 this version is a complete disappointment.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I hear this is the best selling CD in the world.  I'm a bit of a late-comer to the band, but I truly enjoy the music on this album.  It perhaps is not as edgy as some of their earlier releases, perhaps a little to pop for some of the more hard core music fans, but I found it to have just the right mix of both for my taste.  I don't buy much new music these days, tending to stick with my classic vinyl from the 60's, 70's and (some) 80's.  This is a welcome addition and breath of fresh air, plus it makes me feel like I am \\"somewhat\\" in touch with newer music.  I highly recommend it.
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|It's surprising that a band that makes millions in record sales using their own format would change their music due to a few critics' remarks. I have every Coldplay album and thought I would continue to buy each one until they stopped making music. Sara is probably very disappointed, she's the one I listened to Parachutes with in the office, when we both fell in love with Coldplay. Their next albums were amazing as well but what is this? Besides the instrument arrangements which are pretty decent, there is nothing else of substance in this album that even resembles the standard any of their old work. When I heard that Viva la Vida was their first single off that album, I should have known. It is a good song but ranks nowhere in the top 10 Coldplay songs. For them to lead an album with that song should have been a tell tale sign. This is the most regrettable $15 I have spent this year, my wife found the album in her car (where I tried to dump it), listened to it once and threw it back in my car that same day after work.
B00008DDSC|5.0|(SPOILER WARNING.)  There is no question that this is one of the oddest love stories I have ever seen.  A young woman, with a quirky beauty that reveals itself over the course of the film, evolves from a self-mutilating mental patient to a fully realized and loving wife.  It is an extraordinary transformation, told in the form of comedy, and the viewer can believe it.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful.  Spader is at his absolute best:  creepy, with bizarre tastes to say the least, yet full of need in a way that is understandable and increasingly vital.  From a rigid obsessive type, he becomes a man in search of love, even if it involves ropes and a saddle.  This is also Gyllenhaal's first starring role and she is magnificent.  The supporting characters from her hapless boy toy to her alcoholic father and co-dependant mother are also excellent.<br /><br />As many have noted, this film had to tread an extremely fine line.  One the one hand, there is no question that the couple is perverted.  They indulge in pain, humiliation, and bondage.  On the other hand, though so wounded and inhibited, they forge a true relationship.  Their journey is moving, at times titillating, and even fascinating.<br /><br />Warmly recommended.  The range of human behavior is forever unfathomable and unpredictable.  This film shows what a mystery life and the hope for love can be.

0385340567|3.0|Jack Reacher (or Lee Child) has kept me company much of the past two summers, catching up on all 11 books, and I eagerly awaited \\"Nothing to Lose.\\" This is my first real disappointment in the series for a number of reasons.  That recycling plant and the Despair populace were just too unbelievable. Are they born-again bombers? A lynch mob? Robots? For sure they were all stupid since the entire town couldn't hunt down Reacher (who was, to his credit, apparently driving an invisible black police car) and finish him off. Is it be possible a town like that could even exist in this century with one omnipotent master, a nearby military MP base, huge amounts of truck traffic, yet one two-lane road leading to Hope?  How many men can Reacher alone beat up in one fight? The second time he came into Despair, you'd think one of the guys would have just pulled a revolver, capped ol' Jack and hauled him into the desert. Sure that would end the series, a terrible thing to think about, but Reacher keeps putting himself in weird dire situations that have become pretty far-fetched.  Also, I'd like to think that Reacher would not have become a lover to a married woman, even given the situation. Friends and confidantes, yes, but I thought Reacher had more sense.  I also agree with an earlier reviewer about not needing to read Reacher's views on the current state of the military. I don't know many ex-military who would criticize like Reacher (or Child) did. I read for escape, not lectures.  Still and all, it was a Reacher book. Just not near the best in a series where the bar of good writing/reading has been set higher than most.

B00005JPY0|5.0|I don't want to spoil the plot of \\"The Dark Knight\\" for anyone, so I won't even bother trying to summarize it. I also don't want to rehash what everyone else has already said about this movie, so I'll just say that yes, it's very good, and it's definitely the best Batman movie ever made, at least so far. I'm giving this movie a five-star rating, but quite honestly, the last 45 minutes of the film were a bit disappointing.<br /><br />First of all, Heath Ledger steals the show in this movie. The late actor's performance as the Joker is disturbing, amusing, and completely riveting. Unfortunately, I don't think Ledger was given nearly enough screen time. There were so many other things going on in this movie, and so much time was devoted to Two-Face (Aaron Eckhart) that the Joker didn't get to hog the spotlight as much as he deserved to, in my opinion. Let me backtrack and say that all the Two-Face stuff is great, and Eckhart delivers a fantastic performance as well. However, it was just a little too much for one movie. The producers probably figured that Ledger would be around to play the Joker in future films, but sadly, that's not the case, and I don't think any actor will be able to fill Ledger's shoes in a future Batman film, so the Joker never reached his maximum potential. I think the Joker should have been the focus of the film, and we should have seen Harvey Dent turn into Two-Face at the end of \\"The Dark Knight\\" and then be the focus of the next Batman movie.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me about the movie was Batman's strange cell phone spy machine. All those weird holograms and the Caped Crusader's glowing blue eyes were kind of annoying and definitely unnecessary. Also, both Ledger and Christian Bale got carried away with their scary, muffled character voices. I couldn't decipher a few of the Joker's lines and about a fourth of what Batman said because it sounded like both men had cotton in their mouths. WTF? Finally, \\"The Dark Knight\\" was just too darn long. It could easily be about 40 minutes shorter without sacrificing the integrity of the story.<br /><br />All my griping aside, though, this was a very entertaining film. The performances were excellent all around, the stunts were incredible, and the Joker scared the crap out of me at one point and I yelled \\"S**T!\\" really loud in the theatre. (That alone is a testament to the effect this film had on me!) I also really enjoyed Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance as Rachel. She is a much, MUCH better actress than Katie Holmes (although I guess that really isn't saying much), who was the worst part of \\"Batman Begins,\\" so I'm glad that situation was rectified. (However, given what happens to Rachel in \\"The Dark Knight,\\" I almost wish Holmes had been in the movie so all that could have happened to her, ha ha!)<br /><br />Anyway, the bottom line is that, yes, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a really, REALLY good movie...maybe not QUITE as good as all these hyperactive moviegoers are making it out to be, but this is definitely a film you should see on the big screen.t could easily be about 40 minutes shorter without sacrificing the integrity of the story.

1582701709|4.0|In essence \\"The Secret\\" by Rhonda Byrne presents a powerful process that is easy for you to put into practice in order to feel better and create a more healthy & enjoyable life.    What I like most about this book is that there are many professional & knowledgeable contributors who provide valuable insight into important aspects of how to manifest prosperity in your life.      There are awesome potent quotes throughout the book, some of which I've listed below to give you an idea of the quality and integrity inherent in \\"The Secret\\"...    \\"Desire connects you with the thing desired and expectation draws it into your life.\\" Bob Proctor    \\"If it is a new thought to you that gratitude brings your whole mind into closer harmony witht the creative energies of the Universe, consider it well, and you will see that it is true.\\"  Wallace Wattles    \\"Everyone visualizes whether he knows it or not. Visualizing is the great secret of success.\\"  Genevieve Behrend    \\"Imagination is everything.  It is the preview of life's coming attractions.\\"  Albert Einstein    \\"Most of the leaders in the past missed the great part of The Secret, which is to empower and share with others. Dr. Denis Waitley    \\"Life can be absolutely phenomenal, and it should be, and it will be, when you start using The Secret.\\"  Bob Proctor    \\"The predominant thought or the mental attitude is the magnet, and the law is that like attracts like, consequently, the mental attitude will invariably attract such conditions as correspond to its nature.\\"  Charles Haanel    \\"The vibrations of mental forces are the finest and consequently the most powerful in existence.\\"  Charles Haanel    \\"The simplest way for me to look at the law of attraction is if I think of myself as a magnet, and I know that a magnet will attract to it.\\"  John Assaraf    \\"I've seen many miracles take place in people's lives.  Financial miracles, miracles of physical healing, mental healing, healing of relationships.\\"  Michael Bernard BeckwithI recommend the Secret as a most powerful & potent book to read.    Even better read along with \\"Nexus\\" by Deborah Morrison & Arvind Singh, a contemporary, new energy, spiritual novel about the intricacies of vivid & fascinating characters on their life transformational journeys.
B0012Q732O|5.0|I second what Patrick said. This movie was interesting and fun. It reminded me of the Pirates of the Caribbean movies in it's style. I came away glad that I had taken the time to watch it, and I hope that more people do!
B00001OH80|5.0|It's some of the most unique material in all of Bowie's catelogue. It's not \\"Ziggy\\", nor is it \\"Heathen,\\" but who cares? It's Bowie having fun, giving us great music. I'm so in love with his voice that just about anything he sings I'll enjoy, truth be told. But tracks on here, especially Neighborhood Threat and Tumble and Twirl, are really infectious and never really get stale because of their uniqueness. Why does everyone hate God Only Knows on the the album, by the way? Sure, maybe it's not the original. But why do you feel the need to compare disparate things? Bowie is a whole animal unto himself. Appreciate him for the true artist he is, and buy some of his music (rather than simply lazily downloading his past stuff illegally).   PS: the following album, \\"Never Let Me Down,\\" is also not so bad either, especially the very catchy title track. Quit hatin' on the master!!!
0060589469|1.0|I agree with many of the other one-star reviews, this is actually the worst book I have ever read, out of thousands read, in my entire life.  The worst book designation goes to Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance because it is extremely, extremely, over-rated.  I found it to be one of the most self-absorbed, self-pitying, whining complaints I had ever been exposed to - and I know about those, because I'm a former junior high school teacher.      Not only did it not contain any philosophical insights whatsoever, the book is just plain boring and badly written.  The only book I have ever thrown in the garbage can - it's just rubbish, and that's where it belongs.  I'm sure the author is a fine human being.  I just think he wrote a very, very, bad book.  Please don't waste your time on this book.

B00005JPY0|1.0|Action/superhero movies do not really need in depth reviews. They are escapist stuff and nothing more. Spend a pleasant two-hours and enjoy the fast action, one-dimensional characters and nervous editing. Full stop.  Well, not this caper! What kind of movie is this? Ambiguous on all accounts, never clear, always confusing. Let me summarize (and then forget it):  - Cop movie or superhero movie?  - (gothic) Gotham City or present day New-York?  - Batman: a possible character (in Gotham City) or an impossible one (in New-York)?  - The joker: a loonie or a man with a plan?  - The mob: for real or a bunch of idiots?  - Mr Lau: in or out?  - Harvey Dent: a talker or a do-er?  - Rachel: love interest or just a nice plant?  - Batman: brooding or manic depressive?  - The police force: corrupt or up to the action?  - The movie: one ending or many? Two movies in one or just too long?  - Wayne industries: for real or just cardboard?  - Lucius Fox: really there or forgotten to scrap?  - Two-face: yeech! or what-the-heck?  - The mayor: politician or puppet?  - Gordon: capable or parading?  - Overall: stupid movie or bad movie?
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|I love how this film is so deep and has layers that the audience needs to understand. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton did a fantastic job!
B000EGCITG|5.0|01. Stupid Girls- This song is very catchy and addicting. The lyrics include humor and sass which make the song an in-your-face anthem. The chorus is bouncy and fun to sing along to.    02. Who Knew- What an amazing song! This is one of my favorite songs ever created! The emotion in the delivery and the lyrics are powerful! This song takes me to another world.    03. Long Way To Happy- This song tells a dark story about sexual abuse, but the song itself is beautiful. The chorus is hard-hitting and full of a range of emotions. The song really strikes a chord with the listener. This is a true gem!    04. Nobody Knows- This song truly displays Pink's beautiful voice and range. This song is slower, but not boring by any means. Another beautiful song which many can probably relate to.    05. Dear Mr. President- This song is perfection. The lyrics, the emotion, the delivery, Pink's voice, and the message all combine to form a powerful, beautiful, amazing song. The chorus gives me chills and the portion of the song where Pink rants about true hard work is deep. This song is one that you will remember forever.    06. I'm Not Dead- I like the melody of the song and the way the lyrics are sung is unique and fun to sing along with. The song is fast-paced, but then the chorus surprises you with a slow-paced delivery.    07. 'Cuz I Can- This song is pure entertainment. This song is fun, addicting, and extremely catchy. The lyrics are put together in such a silly, unique fashion! This is one of the best songs on the album that will get stuck in your head.    08. Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)- Brilliant, brilliant song! This song is one of the most catchy on the album. The chorus is so fun and instantly hooks you in. I love this song insanely! The lyrics are so true, relate able, and really funny.    09. U + Ur Hand- This song is popular because it's catchy and an instant hit! It pushes the envelope with it's edgy message, but everyone will love this song because it's just too fun to pass up. The beats are insane, in a good way, and the lyrics are hilarious!    10. Runaway- Emotional, beautiful, and perfectly put together. The lyrics are powerful as it Pink's delivery, once again! This song doesn't standout against the others, but it's a wonderful song.    11. The One That Got Away- This song is a funny song, and it has a bit of a country vibe to it. It's really simple, which makes it enjoyable. Pink's voice sounds a bit different in this song, it's so soft and a bit more relaxed. This song is really fun and soothing.    12. I Got Money Now- This song is dark, but it is one of my favorites! It is so good! The lyrics are really meaningful and Pink's voice is deep and a bit more quiet on this song. This song is really chill, very soothing.    13. Conversations With My 13 Year Old Self- This song rocks! Everyone can relate to looking back on their childhood and wanting to comfort their little selves through tough times. This song truly hits home for me. This song is a big production of a song and it truly is beautiful and VERY emotional.    14. I Have Seen The Rain- This is a simple song, but beautiful and personal. I love it, and it's very soothing and relaxing. I almost tear up when I listen to this. This is a true beauty of a song.
0137549202|5.0|This is a comprehensive book on DSP. It is perhaps too much for a student approaching DSP for the first time but it is a very useful text for advanced students. It is also a good reference on the subject. Beginners would do well to go through the elementary book Signal Processing First by one of the authors Schafer before tackling this book.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|I listened to some excerpts on their Myspace, and at first wasn't so sure.  But this album is really, really good as a complete album.  Everyone says it sounds like MMJ, which is true only on the surface of the vocals.  The sound and feel to me are closer to Midlake or the Sadies or even Blindmelon, but better than those (and I like them quite a bit).  Haunting and folksy, the album moves perfectly from one song to the next and in reality I can't even pick out individual highlights, because I feel like there are no weak points on the album.  Great all the way through.

0316067601|3.0|The first  1/2 of the book is pretty much relegated to his upbringing in Texas and then pretty much the gruesome exercise regiment that the men have to go through. Lots of running, push-ups, etc. Over and Over again. Kind of overdone page after page. No real insight into special techniques on camoflage, swimming great lengths, demolition, stealthy assaults, etc. Just exercise after exercise. His respect for his officers and how soldier after soldier drop out due to the extreme training exercises. Nothing new here. Just getting to the 2nd half of the book about the SEALS going into the Mtns. of Afghanistan  to seek out the Taliban. I FULLY respect his SERVICE, TRAINING, DEDICATION to the SEALS and serving the U.S. of A. but I really wanted to read more of the in-depth training they get w/o revealing any security secrets. Re-con, demolition, etc. All I read was push-ups and running. Again, I have NOT read the 2nd half yet but, WHY are the SEALS in the mountains of Afghanistan and not the RANGERS or GREEN BERETS? I thought the SEALS focused primarily on underwater demolition and beach assaults? Again I respect his service and his sharing of his story. I REALLY blame his editor for allowing us to read about so many push-ups and running, and getting \\" wet and sandy\\"<br />There are several other books on the market just like this one. I am glad I bought the cheaper paperback.<br />P.S. Be WARNED :  He claimed to grow up in a Christian home but he runs God's name through the mud like there is NO tomorrow. Hope someone gets a chance to share Jesus with him before he REALLY faces Hell Week.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I actually hadn't heard of this show until I was looking at The Wire here on Amazon. Mad Men was linked from one of the pages so I read through the reviews. With so many positive, I decided to take a shot.    I was hooked after two episodes and watched the entire first season in about 10 days. The show revolves around advertising executives on Madison avenue in the 1960's. The characters are believable and well developed. The dialog is terrific. It is also interesting to see what things were like in the 1960's. For example, the execs all sexually harass their secretaries on a regular basis and it seems to be almost expected.    Watching this series I have found myself empathizing with many of the characters, which isn't a flattering statement.    I am very pleased that HBO are the not the only ones pulling their weight by coming out with good quality film on television ... down with network sitcoms!!!!
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|Halloween Goes Blu<br /><br />John Carpenter's \\"Halloween\\" was, is and will remain the best horror movie placed on film and now Michael Myers can murder in high definition blu-ray. This 1978 low budget movie couldn't afford hi tech effects, so Carpenter brilliantly manipulated the greatest fear of all fears, \\"the element of surprise.\\" I first saw this movie in the theater when released along with 4 other friends. 3 of those friends walked out they were so frightened, as did other movie goers. The remaining diehards like myself  who stayed, frequently jumped 2 inches out of seats as ear piercing screams filled the movie theater with a deep sense of dread, panic and terror. I have owned the movie on VHS, Laser Disc, DVD and now Blu-Ray, it is the only movie ever I felt so strongly about to own every format. Through the years I have talked with others who enjoy this movie and we discuss the small little errors that even John Carpenter himself has talked about. However, there is one huge error in this film that to this very day I can not find one other person who caught this major mistake. If I ever someday have the privilege to meet or talk with John Carpenter I would be most curious to ask if he himself knows of the mistake. Until such time I will go to the grave keeping this huge flaw a secret. Blu-Ray lovers, the HD format in \\"Halloween\\" does exactly what it should do, making it worth the upgrade from standard DVD. The HD visuals are awesome giving this 30 year old fearful tale a makeover fit for the walking dead. For the first time ever in all formats the enhanced HD sound track gets the surround sound almost right. The only recommendation while watching \\"Halloween\\" in blu-ray is during the beginning credits while Carpenter's spooky theme song is playing, adjust your home theater audio channels. You will find the blu-ray enhancements on the center speaker will require extreme find tuning to match the other speakers. Failure to adjust the center channel will easily throw off your complete sound separation experience. Other than that, take a seat all you good couch potatoes, relax, take your shoes off, don't fear the reaper, and enjoy \\"Halloween\\" renewed. Halloween gets a rating of, \\"7 Potato More\\".

1600241824|4.0|I always buy the audiobook versions of David Sedaris' books because he reads them himself, and listening to him read, with his dry wit and elfin voice, sometimes innocent and sometimes sly, is half the fun. When You Are Engulfed in Flames is in turn amusing, laugh-out-loud funny, and, occasionally, somber and serious. The title is a riff on his stay in Japan, an example of the broken English he constantly ran across. Sedaris is no snob making fun of the Japanese, however, for he tells us of his hopeless attempts to learn Japanese, being the worst student in the class, and being able to learn only the very simplest phrases. While most of the book is humorous, some of it is moving, and the tale of a trip to visit the memorial to victims of the atomic bomb blast is harrowing. A theme running through the book is Sedaris' attempt to quit smoking, and he relates this experience as only he can. This might not be the best book for first-time Sedaris readers/listeners, but established fans will enjoy it.
0156030209|2.0|The premise is interesting -- a man and a tiger aboard a small lifeboat. The novel, however, gets very tedious.  And the end with the insurance adjusters (who come across as Laurel & Hardy) was unbelievable. The book was entertaining at times, but not worth finishing.
B00169N0BK|5.0|An excellent device. Does excellent calibration in \\"Easy\\" mode. For a little more precision and options use \\"Advanced\\" mode. It is especially easy to match monitor to printer.
B000NDEZPA|5.0|The music is wonderful - I'm so happy I purchased it. I especially love the song \\"The Story\\" but for me all of the songs were worth the purchase. You know how sometimes you get a CD and really only like one or two songs? Well, not the case with this CD. Brandie Carlisle's voice is unique and interesting, she seems to sing from the heart and for sure speaks to my heart, and the music is catchy. I couldn't ask for more.
B000UR9QIK|4.0|Dawn of the Dead is one of my favorite horror films; in fact, I show it in my Horror Film class most semesters. This Blu-ray version looks and sounds great, with a casual but lively and informative audio commentary by Romero, Tom Savini, and Christine Romero (who I guess is George's ex-wife now, as he mentions his girlfriend on the commentary track for Diary of the Dead). This is all wonderful, and the only thing that keeps me from giving this edition 5 stars is the fact that only the U.S. theatrical version is included. I try to keep only one version of each movie I own, but I'm going to have to keep my regular DVD release of Dawn as well as the Blu-ray version because the regular DVD release includes the Cannes cut and the Argento cut along with the U.S. theatrical version. I realize that this is Romero's preferred version, but with such a landmark film, I want to own the alternative versions as well. If you're not interested in the variant versions, consider this a 5 star rating.
B0012Q732O|1.0|This movie is so bad it's painful. I cannot find a single redeeming feature in it except for the fact that at some point the stone-age characters and wooly mammoths did not suddenly break out into singing ABBA songs. 10,000 B.C. is a terrible, terrible movie. Don't waste your money.
B000V698DI|5.0|This is the best album by Nirvana. If you have not listened to the album, you are missing one of the greatest rock albums ever released. This review sounds like hyperbole, but it is not.
B0013FDM7E|2.0|Pretty good adaptation of the novel by Richard Matheson, modernized and great idea to set it in NYC.  And the creatures were great.  But then the ending came, and I wanted to .....Hollywood bs.  Stick to the novel for a change.
0452289963|1.0|Tolle is totally \\"egoic\\" to use his own word.  What a bumptious person he is.  I think I'm a pretty happy, well-adjusted person, so maybe I just don't have a big enough \\"pain-body\\" to get him.  I just don't see how an intelligent person with such good judgment as Oprah could be taken in by this!?!  I did not finish the book -- there are too many much better books out there to waste my time.
B0015D3Z4O|2.0|I have been a Madonna fan forever, but this album is bad, there are some exceptions, but most of the songs sounds like those side B songs that they used to put in those vinyl singles of yesterday.
0143036742|3.0|_A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian_ was recommended to me on the premise that an octagenarian Ukrainian immigrant marries a much younger, glamourous Ukrainian woman; hilarity ensues.  Is it a love match, or is the younger woman merely a gold-digger seeking citizenship and the \\"good life\\" in the West?  How the geriatric widower and his two well-meaning middle-aged daughters see the relationship tells much about their pasts: the time and circumstances in which they grew up and where they are at that particular moment in their lives.<br /><br />A good deal of the story plodded along - as a previous reviewer noted, it would have made a much better short story than a book - I became increasingly frustrated as the story developed, although this may have been intentional, Lewycka wanting me to empathize with the well-meaning (if exasperated) daughters.  The conclusion was rewarding, and I felt was the strongest writing of the book as well - Lewycka quite movingly shows the internal mechanisms that all families face: sibling rivalry, the struggles of caring for elderly parents, differences in  political and social outlook - with the additional burden of cultural differences between those born in Ukraine and those born in Britain.<br /><br />While some may apparently found it funny, I didn't think so; perhaps the relationships between characters and the events were a little too close to home for me to find any humor in them.  (Or maybe I don't have as good a sense of humor as I thought I did.)  A good diversionary read, but not a great book.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Priest fan since 82.  Like many people, the first two listens had me scratching my head. Then I got it. No doubt that Priest took a long time making this one. It's almost as if it is a soundtrack. Halford really stretches out on this one: a total powerhouse. Great lyrics too.    I am very glad they changed direction...very refreshing. Nostradamus is in a league of it's own. If you want more stripped down metal, their last one, Angel of Retribution was their best since Screaming For Vengeance.    I am hoping they play the album in it's entirety on their next full tour.
1594489505|5.0|I absolutely loved _The Kite Runner_, and therefore was hesitant to read _A Thousand Splendid Suns_, for fears of it falling short of the expectations I have for Hosseini.  I was so very wrong.  _A Thousand Splendid Suns_ is magnificent.  It is bitter-sweet, to be sure; as Hosseini writes towards the end of the novel, \\"Every Afghan story is marked by death and loss and unimaginable grief.\\"  Through the characters of Miriam and Laila we vicariously experience an Afghan story.  You will be moved.<br /><br />Admittedly the first third of the book is a challenge - readers first meet Mariam, a young Afghan girl who lives in the contryside.  Mariam's life is one of hardship, abuse and toil, with only fleeting moments of joy that are quickly destroyed.  Having introduced this character, Hosseini then seemilgly drops Mariam and introduces Laila, a Afghani girl who lives in Kabul - her childhood experiences are worlds away from Mariam's.  Be patient - the investment made in developing these characters is returned several times over as the stories of these two different women intertwine and unfold.<br /><br />As Afghanistan is first invaded by the Soviets, then plunged into civil war before the ascension of the Taliban, these two very different women find they have much in common: death, loss, grief - but also an astonishing capability to endure, survive and find solace and comfort in each other.  Hosseini does such a masterful job of developing these characters that, at times, it is difficult to go on reading, given the emotional attatchment you have to them.<br /><br />Life in Hosseini's Afghanistan is brutal, unjust and chaotic.  His characters, however, are beautiful.  I regret not reading it sooner.  Very highly recommended.
0307383415|3.0|In terms of insight to the man, it is a rather disappointing memoir. Not to take anything away from him though, as he does appear to be the real deal in US politics, since JFK.    I expected the book to be a revelation as to how he developed his character and ideas. To understand the  circumstances that had forged his personality. And I was let down. As it turns out the book is merely an account of his life-journey just before getting into Harvard. In the end, you get to see that his is an ordinary life, except maybe for the fact that he has an 'international' family background. Even that, does not explain the makings of the man.     So, if you're looking to understand what made Barack Obama into the phenom that he is today, this is not the book my friends.
006097625X|4.0|As previous reviewers have mentioned, Scott McCloud is passionate about comics; part of the purpose of writing the book, it seems is to justify the argument that comics are indeed art.  I found this a moot point, although his evidence was interesting.  Another reason behind the book, it seems, is to explain the message behind comics: the epistomological leaps we take when we read them, the artisitic decisions made when they are created, and the evolution the art form has taken.  This was not only the strongest and most interesting part of the book, but also much less preachy.<br /><br />I enjoy comics, from 19th century broadsheets to the Sunday funnies and the occasional graphic novel.  Until now, however, I never really thought about the conscientious decisions the artist makes between realism and meaning when drawing them.  Similarly, I had never critically thought about the fundamental differences between Asian (especially Manga) comics and Western comics.  McCloud has shed much light on these topics, and explains these differences and decisions clearly, without pretense.<br /><br />Avid readers of comics, aspiring comic artists and purists may find McCloud a bit pedantic - for the novice such as myself, I was fascinated, as a whole new world has been opened to me through his explaination.  Why the four stars then?  I took a star for his argument about comics as \\"art\\".  I suppose there are those who believe comics are not art (or are \\"low\\" art at the most); while I disagree with this (and side with McCloud), I thought the argument was out of place, and ultimately moot.  Still, a recommended read.
B000002LEU|4.0|A great CD that I got to replace the cassette tape.  The beginning of a great age in music.  New Order was more polished, but I think you can hear the raw, burgeoning talent that started here.  That's why I like this album, because you feel like you were there from the beginning.
0812565886|5.0|Persuasion is Jane Austen's last completed work before her death. It differs from her other more well known works such as Pride & Prejudice, and Emma. It focuses on a relationship who have a second chance to re-ignite true love but whether or not they will depends on so many things that make a good story and are still applicable today.<br />A crazy family, social expectations, unforgiveness, competing love interests, and a little bit of that classic Austen wit that bites in just the right places.<br />It's shorter than Austen's other works as well, and the plot less complicated and detailed than Pride & Prejudice and Mansfield Park.<br />If for no other reason than the famous \\"you pierce my soul\\" letter, this should be a must on everyone's read list.
B000002GB6|4.0|Great CD.  I bought it because I heard the title track on the radio recently and it reminded me of hearing it when I was kid.  I was happily suprised that the rest of the songs are good too.  \\"Maui Waui\\" makes you feel like grabbing an umbrella drink and heading to the beach, so watch out.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|For being period drama, this film adaptation more than any I've seen has something for everyone. The backdrop of worker reform the love story is set against brings so many things to the movie that make it hard to call North and South a love story.<br />North & South has something for everyone, rioting, suicide, murder mystery, worker unionizing and against all that, more marriage proposals and refusals, May-December romances, and some very funny comic relief in the character of Fanny Thornton.
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Off-the-wall parity of Mary Poppins. The kids are as good being bad as one could hope for. Emma Thompson plays the nanny with understated excellence. This is just a fun movie which will be enjoyed by all, but beware--it may very well give your younger kids some excellent ideas for misbehavior!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I own every Queens album except there sadly out of print debut, but this is quite easily the best I've heard. Lullibies almost scared me off with medicore lyrics, dull guitar, or just plain bad delivery on nearly half the songs. But this album has more vision than any record that they've spun out. The songs are interwieving and complex, as well as softer, well not betraying either the bands metal or punkish roots. The lyrics have a deegree of poetry often absent from previous songs the bands made. The dark, vaugely artificial atmosphere is incrediable and inspired. Nothing as good as No One Knows, but some of their best songs. I've collected well reviewed albums for a year, ranging from The beatles to Public Enemy to Miles Davis to Metalica to Bruce Springsteen to My Bloody Valentine to Marvin Gaye to Funkedelic to many more, and this is the first Queens album to really rank up with the classics, except perhaps Songs for the Death. Its at least as good as Sticky Fingers or The Bends. If you can't appreciate this as much as Lullibies at least than I must say your taste must be very narrow.
B001AHM2C6|5.0|I'll keep this short. If you liked the movie, you'll love the score. If you liked the Batman Begins score, this builds on themes from that, mixed with new themes from the Dark Knight, so truly it is a perfect sequel soundtrack. I can't wait to see what the do when the 3rd movie comes out. To reiterate, this soundtrack conveys the insanity, rage, sorrow, and intensity that the movie does. How anyone could enjoy this without a big grin again & again is a mystery. After all, why so serious?
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I can't understand a coldplay fan would give this album one star. This album is as solid as they come every song is unique and i love it. lover in japan  is a smash, 42 is hot, the intro is hot, all in all it the best album of the year. I probably listened to this album 100 time or so. Psychologist should use this album as an antidepressant. one
0385340567|1.0|I was a fan of Lee Child and have read and own all of his Reacher series of books (in signed 1st editions).  He has let his politics interfere with his story line.  Bad Luck and Trouble was the start of using his \\"fame\\" as a chance to let us know his politics.  In \\"Bad Luck....\\" it was his obvious support of PETA and his disdain of hunting.   I thought that kind of a sorry state for a character as rough and tumble as Reacher.     In Nothing To Lose, what was a good story line turns into a diatribe against the Iraq war and turns Reacher  from a man who served his country into a man supportive of deserters and the like.  Totally unnecessary except to allow Child, an immigrant to our nation, a chance  to show his political disdain for the country he chose to live in (I am not sure of his immigration status).      For me these last two outings into  his political beliefs ruin a good story and transform  a character from a truly good guy to an anti war, anti American Berkleyite.   \\"The last good war America fought ended in 1945\\" ....to paraphrase one line....well, the last good book Lee Child wrote was The Hard Way in 2006.       He may have \\"nothing to lose\\", but \\"bad luck and trouble\\" will follow him.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|The Good Things<br />*A good amount of action and special effects.<br />*Filming style is not bad.<br />*Some of the production design is nifty.  All of the costumes, props, and sets are highly detailed and have some interestingly ornate designs (albiet the Batmobile is ugly now!).  Gotham City seems much more futuristic, too.<br />*Despite the questionable acting quality, the characters are still not bad.  It is interesting how they tried to touch upon the central ideas of Batman a little stronger (the idea that Batman uses his own fear and projects it into his enemies).<br />*Some good lines (including a few that are unintentionally funny).<br />*The storyline is crazy but entertaining.<br />*Music score is okay, but the music soundtrack is excellent (good songs by U2, Seal, and many others).<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Substantially goofier (thanks a lot, Jim Carrey!).<br />*Despite the highly-detailed designs, many of the props and settings look kind of fake.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*The acting! Val Kilmer is bland as Batman.  Jim Carrey is a little too over-the-top.  Tommy Lee Jones is goofy.<br /><br />This sequel managed to increase the action and style, but at the cost of creditability.  Instead of being a good, serious, dark film, this is a goofy departure from the previous Tim Burton films.  It's generally okay and it entertains, but is certainly not the best.<br /><br />The one-disc version has okay video and sound quality.  The two-disc version has good quality and a bunch of featurettes (and possibly some music videos, but I don't remember right now).
0307265730|5.0|I'm not usually a fan of books of short stories.  But the reviews of this one brought me in, and I was not disappointed!  For one thing these stories have a strong theme, and in some cases the same characters across stories.  And for those who prefer full-length novels, that helps.  For another thing the stories \\"read long.\\"  By that I mean, most of the stories left me satisfied at the end, rather than feeling cheated out of a more in-depth development of character, a common effect of books of short stories I've read.  But no doubt most important is that this author writes so fantastically that she immediately pulls you in to the story line and characters.  This was the first book I've read by this author, but not the last!

0440241413|3.0|I was disappointed in this book, mostly because I could not connect to the main character.  Rebecca to me, is an unsympathic character.  She lies to everyone around her while getting further and further into debt. She does nothing to help her situation.  She tries, but then she goes right back to her old ways.  I just didn't see the point of the story-at the end she still does not seem to get it-very disappointing. I am a fan of Sophie Kinsella, but I think I will skip the Shopaholic series.
0962477060|5.0|I am very impressed with the content of Fretboard Logic. I am a beginner so actually playing the way presented seems overwhelming right now. I can make my hands stretch to barre with a lot of effort, but it will be a while before I can do it effortlessly. That's why I'd recommend this book for intermediate to advanced, someone who can put the information into practice right away. Beginners need to start with easier stuff. That said, it is a great resource to explain the logic of the fretboard that you may not find elsewhere.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Without this movie the world would be bereft of a glittering facet of brilliance unlike anything seen in ages. Never again will we have such acting by Ledger, the only actor to become the joker instead of to make the joker just a part of his own facet. If you grew up reading the comics, then you will understand what this picture means to the world of comic book movies. There will be a third,  but it will not glitter nearly so brightly with its menacing darkness.    The only flaw in this film is that it should truly have been rated R for graphic, and I do mean GRAPHIC violence.
B0011WMHRK|4.0|One complaint: \\"Aumgn,\\" though conceptually spiffy, is a pain to actually listen to. Nearly twenty minutes of directionless pounding redeemed only slightly by the somewhat directionful pounding that creeps up towards the end. If that hadn't taken up a whole side of vinyl, Tago Mago would've been an easy five stars. Still, not bad for what is basically a morphological Krautpunk sketchbook. The whole \\"rhythm as an end in itself\\" thing works better here than on most James Brown records, and the guitars are too cool to be real. Suzuki's \\"I'm having a seizure, but really, I'm fine\\" vocal style is the icing on a cake that's damn near perfect, with the exception of one tragically large slice.
B000001FBI|5.0|Sophomore studio effort from THE best hard rock/glam/metal band in history. Heavier than their first, S/T lp and featuring incredible solos courtesy of Ace Frehley, the dual-attack guitarwork is mesmerizing and almost all of the songs bring back deeply-rooted emotions that bring more than a tear to my eyes every time I listen to this; KISS was my introduction to rock 'n roll !!!. The only ¨ballad¨ here is ¨Going Blind¨ with a heavy, dirgey sound. The rest of the album is just blistering without resorting to lightning-speed tempos.<br /><br />Why I don't own the remastered reissue ? Because after all these years of listening to it on cassette first, on lp later on, I ended up with this first edition cd release. The overall sound is bright and sparkling, with razor-sharp guitars upfront in the mix, shouty chorus and an excellent mix. Drums and bass lack a tad of punch but a little eq correction deals with it impeccably. I love this sound. Remastering  doesn't always make justice to the original so I have not compared, but if I had to buy another copy (which I hope I won't have to) I'd give it a try. If you're on a tight bugdget, get this one for little money; it won't disappoint you.
0671027344|5.0|In short- this book is brilliant and it changed my life. I have read it about a dozen times (yes, literally) over the years.   I can't really tell you any more than the other reviews say.    The one negative thing I can say is that Charlie is unbelievably naive for a teenager.    Perks was a GREAT read, my favorite book of all time, and I am AMAZED that just a book can leave me with the feeling that I get from it.
B0017U7PT6|4.0|This movie is just one step up better than Mel Gibson's Apocalypto IMO, due to the fact that it seems more epic and less graphic and intense (read: depressing) The cinematography is brilliant, the script is moderately well written even with the many flaws and bloopers that come with a movie of this proportion it is a good watch. It looks fantastic in Blu-Ray, and that's the reason I got it. If you're someone looking to collect movies of this genre then get it, otherwise skip it for the DVD version or pick up Planet Earth on Blu-Ray.
0140042520|5.0|Now in 2008 I'm older then Kerouac ever became. But that's not important. When I first read the book I was nineteen, now I'm fifty nine.

The search for wisdom, love, poetry, nature , living a pure life is from all times: Han Shan, Garry Schnyder, Jack Keouac in his best periode, no alcohol, no paranoia.

Get it in BR or bust!
B000FIMHLC|5.0|Great Rock n Roll from a band I hadn't heard about until recently. Finding a decent cover of John Lee Hooker's \\"Boom Boom\\" had been a struggle until a friend recommended Dr. Feelgood's version. Like the entire album, it did not disappoint. I purchased the mono version because I did not want to shell out $20.00 for the remastered cd. Since records (yes VINYL) has always been the main choice personally, the sound was just fine. For one thing, this recording was done in the late 70's. Assuming audio technology was improved compared to the 50's and 60's, mono probably sounded better (my opinion) than it would in stereo.   This album will be timeless. It is straight-forward R n R with fairly good vocals and really good instrumentation. Well produced...Get it while you can...

B00006469V|4.0|When I first heard this recording when originally released I disliked it. Gottlob Frick seemed to be attempting marvelous things but was thwarted by Solti's slow tempi. Decades later, after a dozen or more of Levine's sluggish, spiritually sterile performances, as well as having studied voice and learned the opera as a singer, I have heard it again and revised my opinion.     Frick DOES attempt marvelous things, but is thwarted more by his advanced age and declining vocal estate than by Solti, although more sympathetic tempi might have helped him. Still, there is much insight and sensitivity in his singing. What one misses is the sheer vocal plush of Kurt Moll in any of his several recordings, or Hans Hotter's religious fervor. A pity Martti Talvela didn't record the opera; he made the spiritual almost tangible. For a better idea of what Frick might have done with this role, find the clips on YouTube of concert excerpts with Windgassen in Paris.    When Christa Ludwig opened in the Met's 1970 production she was hailed as the greatest Kundry of the century, and rightly so. Her singing is consistently gorgeous and her dramatic sense is keen and without exaggeration. This recording captures her in her prime. Whether she is better than Waltraud Meier or not is a matter of taste. Personally, I prefer Yvonne Minton's deep sense of siritual yearning, more palpable in spite of the slight sense of vocal strain at the top.    Rene Kollo has some interesting ideas about Parsifal, but was not in his best vocal health at the time. By concentrating on the lighter, more lyrical aspects of the part he avoided sounding too strained by the bigger moments. This however severely compromised his sense of involvement, which isn't really true. Listen to the change in Act III when he realizes what suffering his stupidity has caused. And the final scene has an ethereal quality second only to Jon Vickers.    Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau's Amfortas here is not one I care for. It was firmer of voice and character in Bayreuth. Here he makes Amfortas' profound physical and spiritual agony seem effete and maudlin. I greatly prefer the searing Thomas Stewart in Kna's sublime '64 Bayreuth swan song or van Dam's eloquent and profoundly compassionate tone painting.    Zoltan Kelemen's somewhat bleached tone might seem like a good idea in theory to express Klingsor's emasculated state, but I find the sound a bit unpleasant and the characterisation weak. Hans Hotter, a veteran of all the great Wagner baritone roles, including both Amfortas and Gurnemanz, sounds suitably aged and cavernous as Titurel. All the smaller parts are well served by the Wiener Staatsoper's stalwarts, and the flowermaidens are beautifully sung, headed by the ubiquitous Lucia Popp (Has anyone else recorded so many First Maidens?) and the very young Kiri te Kanawa.    Georg Solti does not really plumb the depths of this opera in the way I would like, but there is much extraordinary beauty in both the orchestra and the choral work, especially in the two Grail Temple scenes. There are two basic categories of Parsifal perfornmance: Brisker or Slower, and this falls about in the middle of the Slower group. There is much to admire here, particularly Christa Ludwig's only commercially available Kundry, but I  would not reccommend it as a first or only recording. Kubelik would be my first choice among the studio recordings, or perhaps Barenboim (which I have yet to hear all the way through, but  what I've heard I loved.) Among the live performance crop, and one from Bayreuth is a must, Knapperstbusch's '64 final performance, of this or anything else, is the ecstatic, rapturous close of his career, with a profoundly perceptive trio of male leads.

B000FFJYB6|5.0|My Dog Skip is a very poignant tale about the love of a dog and how it changes a boy's life.  Skip seems to effect everyone in a positive way and is loved by an entire town.  This movie is entertaining and enlightening at times, but is meant more for adults than children.  For a period piece set in the 1940's it is very accurate.  All the actors do a stellar job.  My Dog Skip is one of the best films I have ever seen and I am glad I purchased it.

1592402038|1.0|As the old saying goes, it's better to light a candle than curse the darkness.  A little cursing is actually OK, but all Lynne Truss does is sit on the ground and cuss, and she never does light any candles.  This book is just endless complaining; there is hardly any actual guidance on punctuation.  Moreover, even the American edition takes no notice of American usage, except to mention its existence in passing.  Truss's book deals exclusively with the British rules, which are rather different from ours, so the book is worthless for Americans.  Finally, she had the extremely poor taste to state that the worst thing (for her, apparently) about September 11 was the misuse of the word \\"enormity\\" in the media.  (Apart from the moral horror of such a statement, the media did in fact use the word correctly in that context, for once.)

B000EHQTZO|4.0|Perhaps no other film have entered the common conscience of people throughout the world as this classic sci-fi horror from 1933. At the time, things like computer animation were unheard of and now, when many of us have \\"been everywhere seen everything\\", it gets quite hard to imagine how amazed must have been the viewers who saw the unprecendented special effects. The filmmakers had to work with the big model of Kong and the final stages of the movie, when the ape is brought to present his powers in front of the sensation-hungry American public, will forever stay in the film books. The modernized tale about beauty and the beast boasts surprisingly crisp dialogues, haunting music and -- besides granting King Kong flashes of personality -- all too well captures the human sense of adventure and lust for power and glory. The crucial part of transporting Kong through half the world is missing from the story, however, is never shown, which may inspire fault-finders. Nevermind. Indeed, King Kong has been bettered in many technical aspects, however, its being first monster hit of a monster movie will never-ever be taken away. That's why it belongs to history books.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Peter Benchley's best selling novel comes to life in Jaws. The novel was based on the Jersey Shore shark attacks in 1916. Jaws helps to re-image what happened on the beaches. Basically all caos.    Are the waters safe? The answer to that question on Amity Island is NO. Martin Brody is convinced of that when Christine Watkins's torn up body washes ashore. To fix the problem he has to do one thing. Kill the Shark. Easier said than done. And, better yet, the beaches have to remain open for the Fourth of July celebration. In other words, Brody has to do something about it, and fast. Can he kill the maneating Great White Shark before it kills the people on the beach?    So continues Jaws. The whole idea of a shark rampaging public beaches and eating everybody it sees can get a little boring after a while. But the whole plot and storyline is very well laid out. I haven't read the book Jaws, but I'm guessing it's pretty similar to the movie.     The acting is really good in Jaws. Roy Scheider does a great job of portraying Martin Brody. Everyone else does a great job too. Also, the movie is pretty good for being filmed in 1975. But I must say that this movie does have blood and is probably not suitable for kids under 12-13. However, you can be the judge of that as the movie itself is only rated PG. Still just be cautious about that.    Now for the effects. I guess for a '75 film, they aren't that bad. But you can easily tell the shark is nowhere close to being realistic. It swims like a robot to me. You can be the judge on the shark. I guess you can give them a break for a '75 movie.     So the bottomline for Jaws is that it's a good movie. It's not a sci-fi movie either. So if you hate watching sci-fi movies, you're in luck. If you enjoy this movie, you're in for a lot more Jaws movies. There's actually 3 more Jaws movies. So I recommend Jaws to you!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Television at its finest.  The criticisms a minority have leveled here are without foundation.  Those who claim boredom with this series must suffer from attention-deficit disorder.  You can pick at nits if that is what makes you happy, but I would rather enjoy it.  Giamatti and Linney are perfectly cast in their title roles, and the technical work is of movie quality and unobtrusive.  David Morse's makeup scarily turned him into George Washington.  The political pull and tug between Jefferson and Hamilton was portrayed without bias.  In fact, I wanted to see more of it.  This series removed our Founding Fathers from the canvases of paintings and put flesh on them.  Great work, HBO!
0385340567|2.0|I would have given the book 4 or 5 stars, but the political overtones are not appreciated.    The storyline is solid and typical to earlier Reacher novels.  He stumbles into a situation and has to remedy a wrong caused by bullies of the innocent.  In this case it revolves around the town of Despair, Colorado, where he is unwelcomed and tries to understand the mysteries surrounding the town and its secrets (while of course leaving many to have to seek medical attention).    Where the book (and Reacher) go askew is when Reacher starts to develop political opinions.  Anti army, anti Whitehouse, anti VA.  A little bit of the author's political views being projected?  A word of advice to the author.  People who would enjoy this series are not the ones who would share his political views.  Unless Lee Child is aspiring to be a columnist for the New York Times, he should cut it out and let Reacher remain politically agnostic.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|I have read the amazing reviews for this show.  I saw all the Emmy nominations that it received.  This seemed like a definite winner to me.  I love quality dramas from television (Dexter, Damages, Friday Night Lights, etc) so I eagerly awaited watching this show.    I desperately wanted to like it, but I found it to be just ok.  The only characters that I was interested in were Peggy (played expertly by Elisabeth Moss) and also Pete (wonderfully played by Vincent Kartheiser).  Most of the other characters were boring to me.  Most of the storylines, although interesting, were far from compelling.  In fact, they became repetitive.      Sure, the show is very well acted.  It is also technically amazing, evoking the early 1960s in every scene.  I just wish the storylines had drawn me in a bit deeper.  I wanted to care, but I didn't.
0743290119|1.0|Gave up on book 210 pages in...nothing happens.  Yikes.  Just a lot of whining by girls with very little reason to whine.  Good God.  I was down on Everyone Worth Knowing as it seemed derivative but it was WAY better than this.  And while the title may have been explained later, didn't make much sense.  At all.  Just have nothing good to say about it.  Set pieces are dropped halfway through and a lot of the things this book treats as absolute truths (most notably Adriana's advice about men) may work on some men, but definitely not on others.  Just not very good - it's got as much weight as reality TV and moves at a slower pace.

0765357151|5.0|Robert Neville is he who strives for perfection, he whose goal is to soar among the stars with the angels on high; Neville is the man who, despite everything, has fallen into the eternal charnel pit of the soul. The bleakest and farthest regions of the dismal are his and his alone. How then did Neville come to this winter of discontent? How then did he, who sought the beautiful, become the ugly? His lustrous silver wings melted in the shining sun that he blindly mistook for redemption and when it was too late to save himself he fell like a beautiful yet poignantly destructive shooting star plummeting to earth in a ball of unquenchable fire.<br /><br />In the latter days of the latter years hidden in the home of his oblivion, he has come full circle pondering over the joys and the discontents of a \\"normal\\" life that like the best of fiction is so believable yet so totally alien. Yes, truly he is Icarus dying, the embodiment of dead hopes and dreams and the paragon of destruction. Yes, truly he is the aching longing that will never be fulfilled, the imagined sound of a loved one calling in the midst of a dream. He, and he alone, is the bright and shining hope that failed. He is alive in body only for the soul has fled. Is he any better than the living dead that haunt him so, the mythical vampires who, sadly, turned out to be so real? Those miserable souls of legend that were tortured into an eternity desiring to be with their brethren yet destroying all those who were near. In a dead and howling world, Neville is all that survives to remember what civilization was once like before the virus came, the mysterious virus that turned the world into a legend. In this sea of pain, Neville must make his way alone embracing the eternal solitude amongst the wailings of the damned, but the vampires have a little surprise for Neville that might just change everything. Fly Neville, fly on your beautiful wings and touch the sun before you fall to earth, incinerated and desolate. Goodbye Neville. . .<br /><br />I Am Legend is a poignant narrative conducted by the forlorn Neville, the only man left standing among the charred ruins of a formerly grand civilization . . . our civilization. All those that have gone before him have returned only they are not the same. They want blood for sustenance and in the deepest pits of the night they await Neville, their eternal hunger gnawing away at their humanity. And so, Neville's long journey through the bleak passages of the heart begins and we, the public of readers, join Neville wishing that we could reach out and grant him comfort because Neville's forced loneliness, his desire to see another human, his desire for his dead wife, is truly heart wrenching making the desolate, apocalyptic aura of the book come alive filling the reader's heart and soul with Neville's undying pain. Neville is a narrator that demands sympathy. The author's emulation of a classical, gothic horror style requires the audience to understand Neville's mental degeneration as he seeks solace in whisky and music as the damned howl outside his door. We love him because in him humanity is portrayed at both its best and its worst and his continual flashbacks remind the audience how temporarily life can be and how easily everything that is good, that is noble, can be suddenly ripped away from our grasp. While the tale echoes science fiction, the real story of one man's pining for a life that will never return is what makes the tragedy so forceful, and so believable. Yes Neville, we shed a tear for you because in your bleak existence we see our own moments of pain and loneliness and because of your humanity we are overcome with compassion.<br /><br />Likewise, the drama of the plot echoes Neville's degeneration as his slow, bleak days and lonely black nights plod by and he gives himself away to contemplation, flashbacks, and the false hope promised in the bottom of a bottle. However, everything is about to change as our hopeless hero isovercome with one life mission: he must finally understand the reason behind his enforced agony, he must understand the gruesome plague, he must teach himself the mysteries of medicine and perhaps, in his quest for knowledge, redemption from loneliness will be found. As Neville finally finds a mission in life, a reason to live again, the world starts to shift and his lonely days are suddenly interrupted by an enigmatic woman. What could this mean? Is it salvation, a mirage from a dying mind, or a sinister prelude? Neville cannot decided and so the plot spirals eternally downward, dragging Neville into a shocking climax where the truth of the legend is finally revealed, leaving the reader breathless and tearful. Yes Neville, we hear the pain in your grim requiem.<br /><br />Richard Matheson, the author, has a wonderfully poetic and metaphoric style that combine to bring Neville's bleak world into a shocking, surrealistic picture before the reader's mind. Originally penned in the 's, I Am Legend echoes the literary style of the classics allowing the readers to care deeply for Neville due to the concentration on characterization and the exquisitely beautiful manipulation of the English language. Matheson's eloquent, descriptive language and his evocation of emotion combine to entrance the reader.<br /><br />A note to those who have seen the movie:<br /><br />Although, I Am Legend: The Movie was \\"based\\" on this novel, the movie was not even remotely similar.

0307387178|5.0|Having loved the movie, and long put off reading the book (whose cover blurb sold me on it long before I knew of how well Krakauer wrote), I finally have read Into The Wild.    It is a life changing book, for me - a brilliant piece of work almost impossible to quantify for others, but I'll take a shot, briefly.    There are a lot of people (Alaskans, in particular) who resent the attention paid to Chris McCandless.  He is considered by some to be an arrogant, and ill-prepared elite who had no sense at all to attempt what he accomplished.  At the end of his great adventure he died, after all.  As if that fact lays bare the nature and heart of what McCandless accomplished on his personal journey.  The book spends a great deal of time addressing this attitude directly, and while everyone is all too aware of the errors and faults (some of which can be interpreted as arrogance, not using a map for instance), the author's impressions, research and conclusions tell a very different story.    This isn't about Alaska, or dying in Alaska.  It is about our culture's detachment from honest, obvious and impacting rights of passage and how this natural need is bound to cost us the lives of some of our young - the ones daring enough to try to live life according to their own beliefs, passions and need for honest, truthful self discovery.    I shouldn't say what it is about, really.  I've read many reviews and opinions wherein the writer gives their interpretation of 'what it is about' and accuse others of 'not getting it'.  That is one of the beauties of this book - it is necessarily going to carry a different message to many different people.      Parents may face the cold reality that they do not ultimately control their children when they mature - and that the grey line between childhood and adulthood necessitates some dangerous transitions, if it is to benefit the adult in the making.      Mortality isn't something many in the West are comfortable with - to have died (whateverquality of life proceeds it) is the ultimate failure to many people.  That this attitude prescribes a life of fear and limitation seems to escape most.  Chris lived more life than many such people, and did so in 1/4 the time.    I'm predictably rambling and being less coherent than I'd like, so I'll start to close with a quote from the book:    \\"It is hardly unusual for a young man to be drawn to a pursuit considered reckless by his elders; engaging in risky behavior is a rite of passage in our culture no less that in most others.  Danger always held a certain allure.  That , in large part, is why so many teenagers drive too fast and drink too much and take too many drugs, why it has always been so easy for nations to recruit young men to go to war.  It can be argued that youthful derring-do is in fact evolutionarily adaptive, a behavior encoded in our genes.  McCandless, in his fashion, merely took risk-taking to its logical extreme.\\"    I feel that McCandless ultimately gave us a worthy example mixed perfectly with a cautionary tale, and the jewels he unearthed through hard work most of us would never dream of attempting.   After all was said and done, he concluded \\"HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED\\", an intensely powerful conclusion for someone to attain after leaving everyone else behind.

B00008EY65|5.0|Films do not get any better than this extremely entertaining blockbuster on the fantastical level. You instantly tend to compare this movie with the likes of 'The Lord of the rings' trilogy, or the 'Jurrassic Park.' However, what makes Hellboy so special is its never-lose-appeal factor. Not for one instance in the theatre (not even during non-action sequences) do you get dettached from the theme, or the characters within the plot. Everything seems so relevant despite being an imagination from start to finish. Even when the movie ends it lives with you, and inspite of knowing that there is nothing common between you and the 'male in the red,' you can still identify with him. Guillermo Del Torro sure knows a lot more about movie-making than your average director in Hollywood. Don't miss this one. Own it.

OVERWORK BECOMES A CONCERN<br /><br />By Mabel-Stone Pebble<br />Associated Press<br /><br />BOISE - Metamorpho, the world class Seer, came to the Church of the Disenfranchised Majority yesterday evening. Even though he agreed to severely lower his usual fee, ticket sales were slow and only half of the church's capacity was met. As the lecture time approached, scalpers were drastically cutting their prices by fifty percent. But this was to no avail.<br />Despite this highly unusual set back, Metamorpho arrived by limosine. He was dressed, very stylishly, in his white linen seersucker outfit. He exited the limo with two new aquaintances from the Norwegian Women's Volleyball League. Puffing on a cigar, he nodded to the crowd of twenty cheering scalpers. Upon flicking an ash, a scalper was hit in the eye, prompting him to cut his ticket by seventy-five per cent.<br />Undaunted, Metamorpho, looking fit and cheery, entered the church and made his way to the podium. Smiling and waving, he then announced the topic for the evening's lecture. It was Stephen Stills first solo album called \\"Stephen Stills\\".<br />He reminded the crowd that Stephen was a vital member of Crosby, Stills and Nash (and sometimes Young). He then went on to say that even though most of the music on this selection had the musical stamp of this artist, his solo effort, although quite good, didn't have the magic of the harmonies of his famous group. But, Metamorpho also crowed, that many musical dignitaries contributed their talents to his effort.<br />Crosby and Nash were on quite a few songs. Add to the mix Cass Eliot and John Sebastian plus cameo guest lead guitar by Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton, and you wind up with serious and well produced effort.<br />Stills \\"Love the One You're With\\" sounds most like the music of his group and succeeds in being a radio staple until this day. Other stand-outs include \\"Do For the Others\\", a mostly acoustic moaning about a lost love (which he is master of), \\"Church\\", a piano infused soulful song along with a choir and the very interesting track of \\"Black Queen\\" whereby he gives us a bluesy acoustic while under the influence of tequila. This reporter thinks the state of the artist really gave this song something extra.<br />Half-way through the lecture though, Metamorpho looked very tired and weak and was slowly becoming a whiter shade of pale. Despite his lack of energy, he proceeded on telling us that there is much variety here. He said that all the songs run the range of acoustic, soul, gospel and jazz. This unique blend made this album a noble effort. He pointed out that Stephen was a multi-instrumentalist and that many of these songs offer his unique talents. At this point, we had to get Metamorpho some water because he looked alarmingly dehydrated. Being a true selfless Seer, he muddled onward with his talk. He doesn't want to disappoint his loving fans.<br />He concluded his lecture by advising us that, although the song topics offer nothing earth shattering, the production is well worth the hearing. Summing up his analysis, Metamorpho stated that he hears ethereal and raw elements within this work. Stills, the southwestern gentleman, had examined all types of music to give this gallant offering. And it shows.<br />The lecture concluded, Metamorpho and his lovely companions, made their  way through the cheering crowd back to their limo. This reporter got to him before he was whisked away and asked if he was feeling o.k.? \\"Oh, It's nothing really. Too much volleyball I suspect\\". And with that, he was gone.<br />I advise everyone in town to come out next time to catch his lecture. It is well worth your time and he is an excellent and insightful speaker, especially when he doesn't ask for contributions.<br /><br />Mabel-Stone Pebble

(Untitled)     Marilyn Manson's 1996 release titled \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" was a breath of fresh air for the metal community and was the album that put Marilyn Manson on the map.  \\"Antichrist superstar\\" was one of the albums that helped keep metal alive at the end of the grunge movement and the beginning of Nu-Metal but at that time Heavy Metal was beginning to get really cheezy with bands like Korn and Limp Bizkit emerging on the scene.  With \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" Marilyn Manson brought the evil back into Heavy Metal and at the same time became the the most controversial figure of the 1990's.  I believe that \\"Antichrist Superstar is one of the best albums in the 1990's and the album actually reached up to #3 in the top billboard charts.  This album is a must for any Manson fan and should not be passed up.  Out of all of Manson's albums this is still (and will always be) his crowning achievement.  I would recommend this album to any Heavy Metal fan and those who like dark horror-like music that would make your christian mother worry.    BUY THIS ALBUM!!...you won't regret it!!
6304936362|5.0|There seems to be some nashing of teeth about some of the historical accuracy, and it is duly noted artistic license was definately taken in this movie, but I'm glad they did it anyway because the end result is fantastic. What has been mentioned in these postings is the filmakers used the real deal planes as much as they could, and the sight and sound of these mighty giants is awesome. I think that years from now when these great machines are truely just things of the past, relegated to dusty museums, those who are curious will have movies such as this to see and hear these great aircraft as they lived and breathed. I remember a family friend who flew these planes in WWII who said once to come in for a landing was like \\" landing a bus \\". I also thought it was an exciting and heroic story that was a thrill to watch and made me ultimately feel good. This movie will make the peril and the thrill of flight over the European theatre in WWII very real, and very memorable. This film has a great cast of talented popular young actors and some decent veteran cameos in what is ultimately an exceptional period piece the neither preaches or glorifies the actions of war ,and is very highly recomended.
0789318121|3.0|The script accounts for 3/4s of this book.  The 1/4 of the book that's left has barely passable production art photos and interviews.  In other words this is mainly a script book which skimps out considerably on the \\"featured production art\\" it proudly advertises on the front cover.  This is a big disappointment compared to the book \\"The Art of Batman Begins\\" by Mark Cotta Vaz.  It should get a 2 rating if not for that fact that its about The Dark Knight.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|By reading the other reviews, I get the feeling that many of their authors are basing their reviews of their experiences in the theater.  I have seen this movie on the small-screen only, and will state that the hand-held camera point-of-view of this movie is not that bad when seen on a 21-inch screen.  You still all the important details of each scene, without getting sick in either the head or stomach.    Now to the story itself.  New York City is being wrecked by a 300-feet tall monster.  This creature has two short hind legs and two long front legs that also double as arms.  The creature's skin looks smooth and dark, and its head is long with teeth inside a horizontal mouth and what seems like two short horns; one beside each side of the mouth.  Overall, the monster has a general body outline of a stretched frog.   The monster does not breathe fire, or shoot anything out of any orifice, or fly.  But it does carry around multitudes of smaller creatures, each about the size of a large dog.  These smaller creatures look like gigantic locusts; they have skinny bodies with hard exoskeletons, six long jointed legs per body, and can crawl up walls and jump really high.  These smaller creatures are each armed with a long jaw full of sharp teeth, which they use to eat people.  At first, I thought they were offspring of the bigger monster, but then I watched the special features.  One of the special features basically explains that this 300-foot creature is an alien baby that crawled out of NYC harbor and into the city.  Like a human baby who has just come across a pen full of new toys, there is a lot of screaming, biting, kicking and knocking things over.  So with our baby monster; it knocks buildings over, bites people, and roars a lot.  The smaller dog-sized creatures are most likely parasites living on the skin of the bigger monster; like fleas on a dog.      Now to the positives and negatives.  Positives first.  The monster looks real and original.  The special effects are wonderful.  The smaller insect-like creatures are really scary.  And the cast is comprised of unknowns, which is original for action flick.  Now the negatives.  First off, the US military seem hopeless when attacking the monster.  They miss a lot.  A lot of missiles end up hitting buildings.  Even at point-blank range, many of the tanks miss the monster.  Second, the main group of characters actually head towards the monster to find a friend instead of away from it.  Why not go around it?  Third, the ending sucked.  Essentially, we the audience are watching a playback of someone's home recording of a monster attack, and when the recording stopped, the movie ended.  It would have been nice to include some sort of epilogue; was the monster killed?  Was there only one of them?      Some other features of this movie to know.  First of, there is no soundtrack, which I guess is appropriate given that this movie is basically one person's footage of a city's destruction.   Second, the movie's title, Cloverfield, is some codename given to the site of the monster attack by the US military.  Third, there are some bloody scenes, and the movie should be rated R, even though it is a PG-13.  And last, this is a short movie, under 1.5 hours in length.  Overall, its worth the time to watch it; though it is no monster classic like say King Kong or Godzilla.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|I've seen most of the Pixar films. Heck, I own most of them and have seen them several dozen times because, well, I'm a parent. If you're a parent too then you'll know what I'm talking about.    The Incredibles was the best Pixar film made thus far, in my opinion. It also my opinion that WALL-E is the worst so far from Pixar. The simple reason is that it is light on good story and heavy on pro-environmentalist messaging.    Yes, I know this bucks the PC trend of reviewers raving how great this movie is, but honestly, I was bored. My kids thought it was \\"okay.\\" After my kids saw The Incredibles they were bouncing off the walls and couldn't wait to own it. I don't think they have any interest in ever owning this movie.     The message of the movie is that your typical overweight hyper-consuming American is killing the earth. This is a futuristic tale of how said fatso yanks have killed said planet, and largely don't care because they're too busy floating around in hover chairs scarfing junk food and watching TV, kind of like a lot of people do now, except in space.    Oh yeah, and there's something about robots who have no identifiable reproductive organs who still want to get it on. Seriously, WALL-E must be into the whole dominatrix thing because Eve packs a heavy-duty laser cannon and ain't afraid to use it.    Now before all the tree huggers freak on me, I'm all for saving the earth. I am not a hyper-consumer and I often run to work instead of drive. When I do drive, it's a 1.6 liter Honda Civic. I think environmental stewardship is important, but I don't want to be guilt tripped into it at a kid's movie.    The Incredibles is everything that this movie was not. The Incredibles is a great tale of a super family who have some righteous butt-kicking adventures and it allows kids and parents alike to escape reality for a while, which is what family movies are supposed to do.    If I wanted to get bummed out about the state of our environment, I'd watch An Inconvenient Truth.     Pixar needs to stop with trying to insinuate their political agendas into its movies and get back to good old fashioned story telling.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is definitely one of the greatest movies in the world. Monty Python's comic genius shows with hilarious characters and always-quotable lines. It's one of those movies that needs to be watched more than once.    One of my favorite movies ever.    The scenes with cartoons give the movie a funnier effect.    Join the Python gang in a search for the Holy Grail!!
B0013A1T8I|5.0|I'm not going to go into detail here, there are plenty of other reviews that will give you a synopsis of the film.  Let me just say that out of nine movies I rented this week this one stood out like a shining star.  It's well done, enjoyable fantasy and I can't wait until the next installment.  It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|This is my favorite Pixar animated movie and I give it 4.5 stars.  I have watched this movie countless times, and I never get tired of it!  Maybe it's because the main attraction is *food* and I love food. =)<br /><br />Remy is a rat, but he's not your ordinary rat.  He has dreams bigger than slumming it in the gutters with his family, making do with scraps from the garbage bin.  His dreams encompass becoming a chef, and creating dishes that tantalize the taste buds.  He occupies his time watching a cooking show by famous Parisian chef Gusteau and learning the trade in the kitchen of an old cottage.  Unfortunately, being a rat, he is run off the property by the owner in a very funny scene (an old lady in hair curlers wielding a shotgun.LOL).  This sets in motion his journey to realize his dream of becoming a chef.<br /><br />Okay, you're probably wondering what is so great about a story in which the main character is a rat?!  I thought the same thing, and never did go see this movie when it was out in theatres.  Finally, on a whim I bought the DVD to watch and was pleasantly surprised by the humor and touching warmth of the story about, yes a rat!<br /><br />There were so many moments of humorous scenes, I think my favorite is Remy getting caught in the act of fixing a soup Linguini messed up, with Linguini standing there in astonishment as he watches a rat cooking.<br /><br />At its heart, it is about reaching for your dreams despite the odds and obstacles set in your path.  Despite the nay-sayers who say, \\"You can't do this!\\", which Remy encountered a few times from his family especially his father.  Determined, Remy ignored the \\"You can'ts\\" and the odds against him, and befriends a young man named Linguini and they partner up to create yummy dishes.  Although there are human characters in the movie, and one the klutzy boy Linguini, plays a main role, Remy is the star of the show.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with a Pixar movie, and despite my initial misgivings of a movie about a rat, I'm glad I caved in and bought it.  Like all the animated movies by Pixar I've seen, Ratatouille is wonderful and touching, an excellent movie.aved in and bought it.  Like all the animated movies by Pixar I've seen, Ratatouille is wonderful and touching, an excellent movie.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|This was one of the first ocean thrillers, and maybe the best.  When I saw this in the theaters, I thought some of the characters were stupid movie stereotypes.  Thirty years later, I realize these people really do exist out there in our world and it makes the movie even scarier.<br /><br />The DVD transfer is great, the sound even better.  The extras add to your enjoyment of the movie the next time; since you're buying this, I'm sure you plan to see the movie more than once.
1400079276|3.0|I made it to about 50 pages from the end, but there just wasn't enough to sustain my interest. For the last half of the book I found myself losing interest in the characters and their fates. This is the fifth book of Murakami's that I have read, and the first that I could not finish. Obviously he has the skill and creativity to engage a reader's interest, and I was fascinated by aspects of the story, such as \\"Johnny Walker\\" but towards the end I just didn't care.
0143036742|4.0|Between the usual solid review from Mr. Fleisig and the catchy title, the novel called out for a spin. Ms. Lewycka has made a fine contribution to the vast collection of Russian fiction, although of course \\"Russian\\" doesn't really apply here. The insights into the old days in the home country, the transition during the war, and views into the immigrant experience in England and life in recent Ukraine were welcome and usually interesting.     The author combined a decent amount of humor (amusing at times, occasionally funny) with what in reality is a serious theme. You can see her experience with the care of elderly in the family dynamics that drive the novel. Papa struggles with old age while being mentally alert enough for technical discussions and his book-within-a-book on tractors. His daughters in turn wrestle with how to handle Papa, compounded of course by the plan to marry the mismatched Valentina and the turmoil that inevitably follows.     Dysfunction takes over and there the novel had less appeal for me. Some of the action seemed too forced, or perhaps it's that I don't really like reading about major dysfunction and bad behavior and people doing stupid things. I preferred hearing more about the family's background and watching the younger daughter (and narrator and native English) learn more about the past, including that of the older sister, and for the two of them gradually to come to some accommodation.    A book-within-a-book can be a real dud, just as with a play-within-in-play. The essay on tractors worked better than one might expect, although I can understand if a reader finds it unattractive. Similarly, a reader with little interest in the former Soviet Union or its people will not appreciate one of the novel's strengths. Therefore, I  recommend this more for a specific audience and pass as an option for the general reader or a book club.
0618918248|5.0|I agree with Dr. Dawkins, from one of his interviews: his books are unlikely to cause anyone to lose their \\"faith\\" - if they're already invested (although he still had hope). He says that it's mainly for middle-of-the roaders (or something to that effect) -- those of us (especially in the U.S.) who didn't even know Atheism was an option. I've always been an Atheist (despite my Mom's best attempts), but didn't know what to call it - what do you call the absence of unrealistic belief? The words \\"sane\\" and \\"logical\\" come to mind for me - but not for most people. I had no idea there were so many others like me out there. Now I know. Thank you Dr. Dawkins, for letting us OUT!
0684857219|5.0|THE BEST BODYBUILDING BOOK EVER MADE. IF IT WERE A HOTEL IT WOULD BEAT THE 7 STAR HOTEL OF DUBAI!
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Without a doubt, one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I thought Blair Witch Project was bad.  Cloverfield makes Blair Witch look like a classic.  The Director of this movies should not be given any more movies to direct.  The actors should all report to the unemployment office and seek retraining in another field.  This qualifies for the biggest rasberry of all time.  I can't believe they charged money to see this movie.  I feel as though I have been robbed.  If this movie was a building it would be condemed; it's that bad.
0786891084|5.0|I read this after P.S. I love you.  I liked it even better which I didn't think was possible.  Yes the technology doesn't match the timeframe, but I thought that just hearing the two characters thoughts and short letters was cute.  I liked how life sort of came full circle.  Quick, light hearted read.  Perfect for that couple who had love at first sight, or wondering what-if over a high school romance.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|The unrated version of Beowulf is more graphic than the theatrical release but it is the same story. The artwork is astounding and it is easy to forgot that these are not live actors you are watching. The story is well done too. It might be a fun game though to count how many times the hero declares himself \\"Beowulf\\".
0007263082|5.0|I have read the book and have never seen the movie.  I don't want to because the book holds a pretty special place in my heart and I fear the movie will ruin it.  This book hit home from the moment I started for an entirely different reason then I have seen in the other reviews.  My fiance is in Iraq and as I read I realized that over the last year I have been basically dealing with his \\"death\\" in much the same ways as the main character.  I laughed, I cried, I promised to appreciate people more, I prayed, I just loved this book.
B00077F948|5.0|I heard this music on FM radio and enjoyed the soothing sounds so much that I ordered two of John William's CD's right away. He's an amazing and skilled classical guitarist. This CD is my favourite, but I also really love Places Between where Williams plays with John Etheridge, live in Dublin. It's great as background music for entertaining or just being inspired.
0743454537|2.0|I have heard so much about this author from friends, fellow teachers, my mother, etc.  This is the first one of her novels I have read.  I was hooked by page 2.  Thought this is amazing.  What a crazy idea, different format, can't wait to read more.  Then things went goofy.  Mom was talking in the past, now she's present tense, weird sub-plot of the attorney and his dog, does the brother have to be a pyro?!  It was all too much and became cliche and predictable down to the ridiculous ending.  A book made for Lifetime.  It was just plain stupid.  I hesitate to read any others by her.
075640407X|5.0|This is the second best fantasy novel I have read and I hold against the author only the one flaw that he held off publishing the rest of the work. I recommend to anyone that they read the book but that they not do so until the rest of the series is published unless they want to suffer a rather painful withdrawal. Besides a wealth of good characters Patrick created a wonderful world and has the admirable restraint to avoid monologues about it unlike other writers with too many Rs and leaves much open to the imagination and to later sequels. The one notable absence in this book is government. So far he has managed to almost completely ignore the leaders of the land in a way that I imagine must be intentional.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I had avoided seeing this movie for some time.  Although I love Pixar cartoons, this one just never did anything for me.<br /><br />Leave it to Pixar to surprise and delight.<br /><br />Having just turned 40 the movie resonated within me in a deeper way.<br /><br />Whether it was the fact that Radiator Springs had been seemingly left behind in the modern world, or the story of how Doc Hudson had grown old and forgetten, the theme of the passage of time really struck a chord.<br /><br />When lighting McQueen learns to forego winning in order to help the King finish the race, it is a moral and empathic moment for children of all ages.<br /><br />I don't collect DVD's personally, only for the kids, but this is one of the few that I might consider purchasing and stashing away to enjoy privately in a quiet moment.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Cheers!
B000Y1ZXUM|5.0|Wow.  Shakira rocks it in HD and she's never looked better.  It was worth the purchase just to see the \\"La Tortura\\" performance so crystal clear.  Amazing.  I was glad that many of the songs are the Spanish versions from \\"Fijacion Oral\\" Vol. 1\\" rather than the largely disappointing english tracks from \\"Oral Fixation: Vol. 2.\\"  A great buy for your Blu-ray collection.  Worth it at twice the price!
B000AM2L1O|5.0|She has the sweetest face and smells so good. I bought one for my (now) six-year-old when she 18 mos, and one for my two-year-old when she was born. They have both been cuddled, kissed, run through the dirt, accidentally drawn on with washable marker, dropped, thrown and washed and they are still as cute as ever. The beans in their bodies make them able to sit. My elder child's has seen some wear - her pinky finger has a hole in it from too much chewing and she's missing some eyelashes. For her sixth birthday she asked for another baby doll - just like hers only with a complete pinky finger and all her eyelashes! She informed me that she will still keep her original baby 'because she's special' but she really wanted another one that was whole. Neither of my girls will go anywhere overnight without their babies.     From a mom's POV, they're wonderful. They are adorable to look at, and weighted just right. Whey they do get drug through the dirt, or drawn on with washable marker, just slip them in a pillowcase and toss in the wash. I have even put them in the dryer. My only negative comment is that now the outfits that they come in are cheap. My youngest daughter's baby arrived in the outfit in the photo, and it's all pilled. My older daughter's first baby came in a beautiful cotton playsuit that has faded a bit, but is still soft and beautiful.     This is a wonderful gift for a mother-to-be as the comforting vanilla scent helps to calm the baby and as they get older, they will associate that smell with bedtime. As long as baby is around, bedtime is never a problem.
B000Q8QHK8|4.0|The listing for this product is WRONG!  For some reason, this is the R-RATED theatrical cut and not the UNRATED Director's Cut that appeared on DVD and VHS so many years ago.  All of the deleted scenes from the DC release are contained on this disc (only in 480p standard-def), but this IS NOT the definitive version of the film.  I'll have to buy this Blu-ray again when they release a DC version.  The packaging for this Blu-ray release is gorgeous.  It's like a hardcover book with the disc and several pages about the stars and the process of making the movie.  If you MUST watch NBK in HD right now, it'll do the trick (though much of the film was shot in 16mm and grainy video anyway)- and in a pretty package- but not without a sacrifice of 2 minutes of important scenes.  BUYER BEWARE!
B0017QQZOQ|5.0|This is a great new series.  I understand that the series may not be completely historically correct but it may get people interested enough to learn more about that time.  That is what it did for me.  Can't wait for season three.
B000UNYJXQ|4.0|Our health care system is broken, but what should we do?  Universal health care is NOT the answer.  Living on the Mexican border in an economically-depressed area, I have a unique perspective on this topic.  Many of our populace, both American citizens and those living here illegally, use the county (taxpayer-supported) hospital (Thomason) emergency room as a doctor's office.  Junior has a cough, or needs his vaccinations, the parents take the child to the emergency room at Thomason.  Why?  They don't have to pay, whereas they would at a doctor's office, which is where an ailment or need of this type should go.  So who ends up paying?  The citizens of my county.  Women ready to have a baby, or already in labor, cross the southern border and are taken to Thomason.  Another \\"anchor baby\\", and 30 non-citizen family members flock over, and who gets stuck supporting them, and paying the hospital bill?  The taxpaying citizens of my county.  We have people crossing over the border to use not only our county hospital, but to drain all manner of resources that they do not pay for.  Adding insult to injury is my own government.  The drug cartels in Juarez, Mexico have ramped up the violence (Juarez and Sinaloa cartels) over turf; the Mexican police are seriously outmanned and outgunned.  Mexican citizens injured in the weekend melees IN MEXICO are IMPORTED to our American hospital.  Who pays for their medical care, and their import to our hospital and back to the border?  The taxpayers of my county.  Even worse, when Mexican police are injured in these drug wars IN MEXICO, my government imports the problem--the injured police officials are brought over here to Thomason, AND the hospital goes into lockdown for over a week at a time.  Armed guards (sheriff's department being paid overtime), metal detectors, inconvenience to those legally and legitimately needing the services of the hospital, and fear instilled in everyone.  The cartels will stop at nothing to \\"get their man\\"; they have stormed hospitals in Juarez to kill the police being treated there, along with innocent bystanders.  It will only be a matter of time until this happens here, and it was MY GOVERNMENT who brought it to our doorstep.  Who pays for the importation, medical care, release to Mexico, and weeks of 24-hour armed security for these \\"wanted\\" individuals who are not only NOT citizens of my country, but were injured NOT in America?  The citizens of the county of El Paso, Texas.  The El Paso government fights Washington all the time for reimbursement; it may only a matter of time until all the citizens of America will be footing this bill.  What we have here in El Paso is universal health care at it's \\"finest\\": allowing people to use emergency facilities (when it is not an emergency) as a doctor's office to avoid paying for services, and bringing violence into my country (injured Mexican police officials to be followed by drug dealers out to kill them while in the hospital)--all of which I have NO say in, both in the activities and in paying for it.  Taxation without representation to pay for those who not only DON'T pay anything, but don't support it with taxes because they AREN'T CITIZENS.  Already this year (and it's only late July 2008) there have been 22 individuals to the tune of over $1,000,000 treated at Thomason due to the drug wars IN MEXICO (El Paso Times, July 25, 2008).  The Mexican government said they'd pay; so far we've seen only about $50,000, and nothing in recent memory.  (UPDATE:  As of today, August 29, 2008, we're up to 30 individuals at a cost to El Paso, Texas taxpayers of $2,000,000).<br /><br />Mexico is draining America in every way it can.  Both of our borders and coasts need to be sealed off in the name of national security, those here illegally need to be deported immediately without exception.  Once we have only those here who should be here can we start thinking, just thinking, about anything such as universal health care.  When we allowother countries to bleed us dry, there will be nothing left; how then can we take care of \\"our own\\", our own citizens and our great country?  We are allowing others to destroy our country, and our government willingly brings problems in from our \\"sister city\\" (Juarez, Mexico).  With \\"relatives\\" like this, it is time we disowned them for our own good.  Seal the borders and coasts; whatever problems another country has are THEIR problems, let them deal with, and pay for, it.<br /><br />Please do not be fooled by \\"one of the safest cities\\" designation in regard to El Paso, Texas.  It is not.  The taxes are high, and going higher all the time; we have to deal with Mexico's problems--both the issues and the financial aspects; and we have to deal with our own government willingly bringing the violence across the border for us not only to deal with, but to pay for.  Universal health care when you have a huge number of non-taxpaying citizens (a large number of whom are here illegally), a tremendous number of non-citizens coming over expressly for the \\"free\\" (to them) health care, people who clog hospital emergency rooms with non emergencies so they can get out of paying at a doctors office (and thereby tying up the ER and hospital personnel, keeping them from properly and timely addressing true emergencies), and your own government bringing in non-citizen problems that not only cost US money but add inconvenience to and instill fear in our citizens and invite violence to cross the border...no thanks.<br /><br />Until we get a handle on things, both on screening who is \\"entitled\\" to the services of OUR country, and on our citizens actions as a whole, things will never get better, only worse.  Having a multitude of children when you can't even afford to raise one child is irresponsible.  Who ends up paying for that person's CHOICES?  Those who demonstrate and exercise responsibility and sound judgement. Who uses the services of entities funded by the taxpayers?  Those who pay the least in taxes, if anything at all, whether citizens or not.  Come to Thomason and see what I mean.  You'll have parents who can afford lots of tattoos, cigarettes, mountains of \\"bling\\" (or a few very expensive pieces).  Follow them to Wal-Mart.  They pay with the Lone Star card (food stamps), then load their bags and bags of chips and cases of soda and beer and cartons of cigarettes in their late-model cars for a trip down the road to the liquor store for the \\"hard stuff\\".  If they can afford tattoos, cigarettes, jewelry, beer by the case (literally), hard liquor, and a tricked-out late-model car, they can certainly afford health care.  They have LOTS of kids because they don't have to \\"pay for\\" them, or anything related to their care.  These same kids eat free breakfast and lunch in the public schools, and never come with supplies; the parents expect the school to provide EVERYTHING.

0307387178|2.0|The book as a work of literature is okay.  I guess.  It seems to meander about looking for something to say.  In addition, I don't trust Krakauer as a chronicler, as it is my understanding that he played fast and loose with the facts in both \\"Into Thin Air\\" (to the fury of some of those who were there) and \\"Under the Banner of Heaven.\\"  My biggest problem with the book is that I found Chris McCandless to be a juvenile fool.  Despite his alleged superior intellect, he behaved and wrote like a 14-year-old.  I really see no reason for glorifying this idiot.  His demise was nature's way of purifying the gene pool of a little lunacy.
0618918248|4.0|Lots of confirmation on the kaleidoscope of topics in this area.  This is a tough read in \\"England English\\" but a strong testament to Dawkins experience, knowledge and intelligence all brought to bear in this Atheist Owners Manual.
B000063DS1|5.0|Here's my story.  I'm about 10 years too young to have caught The Band in their heyday.  Here comes the 21st century.  Teenagers.  Video games.  PS3. Bluray.  I got The Last Waltz movie as a freebie.  It sat in the cabinet for about 6 months.  Eventually, I put it in the player . . . Honest to God this has got to be the best film and album of all time.  Unbelievable.  I'm floored.  Buy this album without hesitation and throw everything else out.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is essential Led Zeppelin.  One of the most influential rock albums of all times, period.  Long before Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel came onto world beat, Page and Plant were incorporating musical elements from north Africa and Asia -- which they experienced for the first time following Led Zeppelin's first tour of these locations.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I am so glad I decided to take heed to all the 5 star ratings for this film I had never even heard of before and go ahead and rent it. This was a truly fantastic action movie. Bale is a very good actor and I like the projects he selects. I wish this film had gotten more notice. I would like to see more films like this come out, action sci-fi with a message about humanity. Don't dumb it down, producers. This is the way to go, if only it can be better promoted so people find out just how great such movies really are.
B0016NF06O|4.0|This CD is really very interesting, the way it blends country and jazz.  There are a couple of standards on here that Nelson has been known to perform often (Georgia on My Mind, Stadust), and a couple of Nelson's country compositions (Rainy Day Blues, Night Life), some Jimmy Reed, some Merle Travis, some Clarence Williams.  In fact, you've heard all of these songs (if you're not a teenager still).  However, you've NEVER heard these songs performed like this before, I guarantee it.  The more I listen to this, the more it grows on me.  Marsalis proves once again he is the best in the business to be able to pull this off.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Whenever I listen to the soundtrack it puts a smile on my face! Brings back memories from the movie, and Meryl and Amanda have really good voices. I just wish that the song Chiquitita was on the soundtrack. I highly recommend buying this soundtrack.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|Not Good ! very disappointing. The blokes have had a hard time following up since Painkiller !!! Not only is this boring, it is double boring ! Two CDS !!!!!!!!   They are still good as a live act though !  Blue Cheer and Vanilla Fudge rule !
B00028HBKC|5.0|Read the Bible if you want to know more  about Jesus. And it is good for you if  you do.
B00001OH80|2.0|Ooh, now this is quite bad. Let's Dance was mediocre on a whole, but sometimes it was really good. This doesn't even have that much going for it. It's one of the most insipid albums I've ever heard. And the weird thing about it is that it's strangely listenable. Well, other than those two craptacular covers (an overproduced '80s version of \\"God Only Knows,\\" which is a terrible version of a fantastic song; Leiber and Stroller's well-known \\"I Keep Forgettin,'\\" that's apparently supposed to be a classic or something - Bowie tries to be Elvis, and comes up way short). There's nothing particularly abrasive about it. It's just wretchedly, abysmally boring. It's genre experimentation horribly bungled. Some of it is mood music gone horribly wrong. Look at \\"Loving the Alien,\\" which runs out of ideas after two minutes but still slogs on for seven. And reggae music gone horribly wrong, too: check out the title track (with Tina Turner sounding really, really bad on backing vocals, and again co-written by Iggy Pop), and the Iggy Pop cover \\"Don't Look Down.\\" This, friends, is conclusive proof why Bowie never, ever tried to play reggae during his salad days. And, in some cases, synth-rock gone horribly wrong, as if that term wasn't redundant in the first place. As an example, there's another gourd-awful tune penned with help from the Igster, \\"Neighborhood Threat,\\" with the amazingly inept attempt at self-censorship \\"everyone wants to kiss your trash.\\" I don't know squat about Iggy's solo career (though I love the Stooges), but I think he's capable of a lot more than \\"Don't Look Down,\\" \\"Tonight,\\" and \\"Neighborhood Threat.\\" This is the guy who wrote \\"China Girl,\\" after all. That song rules! But `Neighborhood Threat\\" does not. It overdoes chorus-happy guitar and synthesizers. The one song I do enjoy out of this entire collection is \\"Blue Jean,\\" which is neither mood music, nor reggae, nor an inept cover, nor rock. It's a fun, bouncy retro pop song is what it is. Naturally, it was a pretty sizable hit, breaking the Top Ten. And it's so good I have to wonder if it perhaps fell on this album by accident. I mean, look how much better it is than its comrades-in-arms! It's definitely classic Bowie. Sadly, he takes a similar approach to the mildly funky \\"Tumble and Twirl,\\" and comes up with a fairly bad song, even if I don't hate it the way most the rest of the population does. I'm not exactly defending it as buried treasure, but it sounds great next to his version of \\"God Only Knows.\\" And, come on, the horns are kind of fun. But the album closes on an awful note with \\"Dancing with the Big Boys,\\" an attempted fusion of dance-pop and '80s rock. I give the album a bit of credit for being experimental, but it just doesn't work. Sorry.retty sizable hit, breaking the Top Ten.

B00005JPY0|1.0|well, i'm about to commit blasphemy and type out an unfavourable review of the new chris nolan BATMAN film.<br /><br />remember when superhero movies used to be uplifting? when they used to restore your faith in humanity or the evolution of mankind and in the protector-warrior-nurturer spirit?<br /><br />well say goodbye to those days my friends, cause there's a new \\"super\\" hero in town.<br /><br />apparently, it isn't \\"cool\\" to have good values anymore, or faith in yourself and others. nor is it cool to NOT have a film that could also double for a well-shot BULGARI jewels, CARTIER watch, or LAMBROUGHINI ad.<br /><br />slick, overly art directed, tedious, macabre, disturbing, and soulless is the new way to go.<br /><br />the only people who i believe would enjoy this film are those who are already  struggling with a lot of repressed anger, about-to-boil-over violence, and intense self-hatred and depression b/c that is mostly what we see displayed onscreen. there is a scene of torture, and that comes from a \\"good\\" guy. (somewhere the evil emperor from Star Wars is cackling hysterically, this person really \\"lets his hatred flow...\\") in most incidences, if at first you don't get what you want, beat the s__t out of somebody until you do. some hero. what a guy. there's never any compromise or ingenuity displayed. but i guess that's asking way too much. and it cuts down on the cool scenes of psychological torture gambits --the ideas of which are stolen from SAW and SEVEN.<br /><br />i don't get it. perhaps most people just like being told what they will enjoy. the message from the media is overwhelming: you WILL LIKE the new batman movie--EVERYBODY ELSE DOES!! (and this is a message  from a society that kept \\"friends\\" on the air for almost a decade. i think i'll listen to my OWN OPINION, thank you)<br /><br />is there romance, you query? something for the ladies to break up the punch-a-thon?<br /><br />why? the D.A., lazily acted by maggie gyllenhall, she of the drew-barrymore-esque, flat-californian, squeaky speaking voice (who has done better work) inexplicably is drawn to a passion-free, sexless, humourless,  and doomed fatal attraction to the man in \\"bat...\\" despite a handsome,  SEEMINGLY moralistic  fellow lawyer, admirably  portrayed by Aaron Ekhart, constantly professing  his undying devotion to her. a couple of awkward, stilted \\"quicky\\" comic panel clutches are all we get.<br /><br />The message of this film, throughout, is that WE ARE ALL DOOMED. Human beings are selfish creatures, on the verge of annihilating each other at the slightest provocation.<br /><br />and fanboys, i ask you, when has BATMAN ever been endowed with the virtually SUPERHUMAN, bordering on completely unbelievable, powers and beyond-luxurious wealth displayed by the latest bruce wayne? i know batman is supposed to be rich and lonely, and have a nifty suit and car and all--but-- COME ON!! not to this degree. i kept waiting for the voice over... \\"when you drive the new honda 5000 crotch rocket extreme, let 'em TRY and catch you...\\"<br /><br />this bruce is a rakish cad, resplendent in his arrogance and emotional removal from his environment. hmmm. perhaps this was intentional? there is none of the charm we have seen exhibited by this character in the Burton films. i'll let the actor's recent arrest for assaulting his mother and sister speak for itself.<br /><br />there is also an overall ridiculously ostentatious, filthily  grotesque glorification of material desire and avarice--of greed and show-off-y displays of opulence given to mr bat that is unrivaled by even that of his most detestable  \\"enemies.\\"<br /><br />of course you make take your pick, either heavy metal industrial music  or saccharine, noodle-y, needle-y string arrangements accompanying the action  throughout, not a single recognizable (orchestral or pop) musical theme among them.<br /><br />where is the touch of levity? the connection with the common man? i felt like i was watching a hastily edited upscale perfume ad, but with bloodshed.<br /><br />and what's with the fluorescent, nearly empty \\"wayne industries\\" nether world? batman can't spring for Lucius to have a couch down there?  those multi million dollar  \\"development hangers\\" look like abandoned warehouses. not exactly the batcave.<br /><br />why all the dark blues, washed out grays, muddy browns, and shadowy  blacks? no joyful lighting at all... not even in the daylight scenes.  ok, we get it... THIS FILM IS DARK...HEY!! LITERALLY!! i will go further and say this film is almost  TOTALLY DEVOID of any type of joy whatsoever.<br /><br />again, bruce wayne is depicted as an emo-tortured, arrogant, selfish  cad. there is nothing inspiring or intriguing about him in the least. christian bale is sexy and \\"brooding\\" (or predominantly silent-- whatever you want to call it) and that's about it.<br /><br />the women in this movie, are, as usual, token appendages. chiefly used to motivate heroism by the men.<br /><br />do we even need to address the laughably broad  ethnic stereotypes encompassing  the various \\"mobs?\\" (who, alas, provide much of the minimal comic relief...though i assume not on purpose)<br /><br />i'm tired of people laying laudatory praise on this film. i found it horribly twisted and the meanest type of cynical, as well as manipulative and patronizing. note the swell of strings whenever someone begins their sappy odes to \\"the bat\\", trying to elevate him in monologue in ways the film could not do through actual cinematic depiction.<br /><br />after a reasonable \\"bait and switch\\" false first final ending, we are \\"treated\\" to about FOUR more--making the film unnecessarily long and i agree, turning the trajectory of the Harvey Dent character into a wasted arc. and an unbelievable one at that.<br /><br />and alas, as usual, following the standard action movie formula of: (and btw THIS IS AN ACTION MOVIE, FANBOYS AND GIRLS, A TYPICAL ACTION MOVIE--WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT--NOT AN EXPLORATION OF THE HUMAN SOUL--THE BATMAN SERIES-- NO MATTER HOW YOU DRESS IT UP, IS NEVER GONNA BE 2001 OR CITIZEN KANE)<br /><br />anyway, yes, the standard action movie formula of:<br /><br />1) lots of fights (mostly fist fights, choppily edited so it's difficult to tell what is happening)<br /><br />2) helicopters, unbelievable building scaling/dives off of buildings, car/bike chase  sequences, guns, knives, bombs, explosions, etc. etc.<br /><br />3) fancy cars go VROOM VROOM!!!<br /><br />4) fancy motorcycles go VROOM VROOM too!<br /><br />and (my favourite--almost always reserved for mostly the last half of these films):<br /><br />5) big stuff go ****BOOM!!!!****<br /><br />and then:<br /><br />6) really big stuff go ***BOOM***  ***BOOM*** some more!!!!!!!<br /><br />BLECH!<br /><br />the fact that this movie has, it seems, been so eagerly embraced the teeming masses has me  worried about the mindset  and pulse of american society.<br /><br />when we saw it, there was an uncomfortable silence in the theater as the film ended, then a tense, collective sense of disappointment and shell-shock. not a good feeling, nor a cathartic feeling, just a feeling of being spent, as if one had just been assaulted or taken in by a grifter. a feeling that something extremely negative had been endured and now, thank god, was over with.<br /><br />i think everyone who has praised this movie should give a big pat on the back to it's marketers, publicists,  and advertisers for a JOB WELL DONE. consider your brainwashing a success. feed us what we think we want to eat and we shall know no better.<br /><br />i do admire nolan's skillful direction, the way the complicated plot is allowed to unravel, and a few nice film \\"moments\\" that are tenderly depicted (a VERY few, mostly involving a hand gesture or a notecard, just something simple that was nicely framed which i did appreciate) and who can argue with Ledger's bravura Joker?<br /><br />but other than that?<br /><br />nothing really noteworthy or worthwhile here. i would skip this one. trust me, you'll feel better for it.:    1) lots of fights (mostly fist fights, choppily edited so it's difficult to tell what is happening)    2) helicopters, unbelievable building scaling/dives off of buildings, car/bike chase  sequences, guns, knives, bombs, explosions, etc. etc.    3) fancy cars go VROOM VROOM!!!    4) fancy motorcycles go VROOM VROOM too!    and (my favourite--almost always reserved for mostly the last half of these films):    5) big stuff go ****BOOM!!!!****    and then:    6) really big stuff go ***BOOM***  ***BOOM*** some more!!!!!!!

B000VWYJ86|4.0|Bourne is back for the third installment of the series. If you haven't seen the first two, they aren't necessary, but I would highly recommend them. In this episode, Bourne is more reflective as he tries to piece together his past. The reflection does not last long before chase scenes and fighting sets in. The story is good, as are the action sequences. I enjoyed it thoroughly.<br /><br />While the action genre is not my favorite, I do enjoy an occasional action show. And since my brother had a new surround sound stereo to go with his new big screen, it was an ideal time to enjoy. I think that if you view them in moderation, they are much better individually.
B0015435OI|5.0|only one thing to say remember to play this album as a 45  not a 33 sounds silly but thats how they set it up...
B00004TS0E|4.0|We watched this movie with the kids the other night and I was reminded how much I like it. It's a great feel-good movie for the holidays. I wouldn't recommend it for the kids though - it's too long and Santa really doesn't have his suit on for much of it. But if you have not seen this movie, it is worth a watch this holiday season.
B000VPUIA6|4.0|Earth to Amazon: most of the 'reviews' here pre-date the actual release of this edition. Some go back six years and more. Release date for this edition was \\"November 6, 2007\\".  Shall we 'review' the actual release, folks, with some commentary about the content, and maybe the extras?   Smile, it's the Beatles. And we'll never see their like again.
B00132D808|3.0|I originally wrote a semi-critical review of this album, because I was in such a shock at how it differed from the first album. I still say that it probably alienated younger fans (I'm 31, and maybe that's why I can try to be more objective about this) and that it's probably not wise for a band to completely change their style on a second album.    However, I have grown to love this album and I listen to it often. It really is a good show, even if it displays an utterly opposite mood from the fist album.    I originally said:    \\"Pretty.Odd. is musically a good album. All prejudices aside, there are some great songs on this CD. Panic! At the Disco maintains their awesome musical talent.    HOWEVER: THIS IS NOT PANIC! AT THE DISCO. WHAT IS THIS? IF I WANTED TO LISTEN TO MODEST MOUSE AND JIMMY EAT WORLD I WOULD DO JUST THAT. DO YOU FEEL ME?     WHAT HAPPENED? Fantastic musical feats aside, the style is totally different. The second album completely misses the energy and edge of A Fever You Can't Sweat Out.\\"

0743442539|5.0|Well if you never read a spy novel like myself then this would be a perfect entry point. First the positives the book was great because it was not so long the book was 224 pages so if you have a couple of hours to kill or on an airplane then this would be a perfect book to read and it was great because it dealt with the cold war era which is pretty interesting stuff.<br /><br />The negative would be is that it is an old book but a good book certain british lingo such as macintosh meaning raincoat is something we americans would not understand but overall it was a great book and the lingo was not too bad that it confused anyone that read it. I was hoping for a happier ending but I was bitterly disappointed with what did transpired at the end but the book did keep me interested so overall I was happy.

B000SCHBGQ|4.0|There are several typos in the kindle version (or wrong word choice). This wasn't nearly as annyoing as the author's need to repeat himself ie. I can't believe it was only yesterday... and (spoiler alert) the dumb codex prophecy being repeated so many times. I can remember two not so clever lines without hearing every character think them and then not have anything insightful to say.<br />OK Besides the above the book did set u a series while being somewhat conclusive in its own right. Though I downloaded this while planning to follow the series. All in all it is a pretty quick read, but I0m definitely a sucker for awakening type moment.
032147404X|4.0|bought this book as a gift for my sister as she just got a new dslr. She found very easy to read and quick to search for what questions she has. Great tips especially for starters. Great book to keep as a reference, good physical size too makes easy to carry around whilst still learning.
020161622X|2.0|The authors provide one with some good advice on topics that are often overlooked. There is a kind of gap that exists in the education of programmers. There are lots of academic texts and courses, and there are lots of \\"how to\\" texts and courses. There is not a lot of published works or courses in areas in between. This is actually where most the craft of programming takes place. Most of us who write software for a living have to glean the best practices of our craft from many different sources. The authors have hit the in between sweet spot.<br /><br />The area of the subject matter is pertinent and much of their advice is good. However, they don't back up a lot of what they say. I felt, like other reviewers, there were a lot of unsubstantiated platitudes.<br /><br />Another criticism I have is that their advice is very UNIX centric. The authors claim that their advice is platform neutral, but then constantly bash programming practices that evolved from the windows camp. Much of their advice tends to be more pertinent for those working in a UNIX environment. The bottom line is that a pragmatic programmer uses the best tool for the job. I didn't feel that the authors practiced what they preached.<br /><br />I believe that this book would be very good for younger people who are starting out in the trade, although many of the ideas are good to have continually reinforced. I think it would also be better suited to those who spend more of their time in the UNIX environs.<br /><br />Another author that concentrates on craft, but spends a little more time backing up his thoughts is Steve McConnell. But Despite my concerns, it is still a worthwhile read.

After bring unceremoniously dumped by live in boyfriend, Duncan, she is awash with misery.  After all, what is so bad about wanting to get married and start a family?

B0016HNOXQ|5.0|Okay, I pre-ordered this one and was going to review it almost instantly...  I'm so very glad I didn't.  At first, with the (Portugese?) opening and off-center bass, you realize that there's no way this is going to sound like their previous stuff (in ways both good and potentially bad), but go with it - the more attention you give it, the more you can hear.  The way certain songs don't seem to flow into the next one seems to be offset by the way other songs do - almost like a suite of sorts later in the album that seems almost perfectly suited for (no idea if I can say this on Amazon or not, but I'm copying this and re-pasting it just in case I get censored) as music for taking \\"medicine\\" to.<br /><br />Paying attention to the sounds pays off - I swear to (insert deity of choice here) that the first round of percussion on \\"Machine Gun\\" sounds in a way softer than the rest of it, on \\"Small\\", half of the keyboard (if that's what it is) strokes sound deliberately fudged, \\"The Rip\\" is, hands down, one of the most, if not the most beautiful song that they've ever done (I'd press \\"repeat\\" 2 or 3 times each time I played the CD when I first got it, and seems, as well, almost tailor-made for a KCRW late morning playlist) and, going back to \\"Machine Gun\\", the sounds at the end are bugging me because I can't figure out what obscure late 70's/early 80's movie they remind me of...  but in a good way - like there was this movie that I wrote off because I couldn't quite grasp all of the themes at the time I saw it.<br /><br />I guess that's probably the best analogy for the album in general as well - don't dismiss it and it will grow on you like most albums you end up never wanting to live without.<br /><br />But then, since both of my boom-generation parents like Portishead, it might be genetic as well.
1400079179|5.0|Loathed by elitist literary critics, wannabe highbrows and religious conservatives, The Da Vinci Code is by any measure a work of genius. To dismiss it as pop drivel is to overlook the fact that countless writers are striving to produce catchy pulp fiction that will propel them to stardom and riches - and few succeed. The book is riveting, fascinating, thought-provoking, surprising and a masterful work of entertaining fiction. If you feel above such light fare, fine, go read Dostoyevsky or James Joyce , but spare us your condescension. As for the religious opposition to the work, any book - in our postmodern day and age in which we are exposed to so many different realities - capable of stirring up so much passionate opposition and so much sincere interest in weighty topics like religion and philosophy and history, is frankly some kind of masterpiece.

B00005JLEU|4.0|I love Miyazaki films for their detailed and beautiful illustrations and their unique stories. This one is about a strong little girl who has to pass certain obstacles before she can save her parents. This is a good family movie and possesses an admirable moral: by being patient and quick when the circumstance calls for it, you will be able to hold on until you reach your goal. A rich and worthy animated film.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm one that quickly gets bored with workout DVD's.  I'd much rather be out doing something that working out to the TV.    I've gotta tell you, I love this workout.  I've been at it for about 4 weeks now and I'm finally just getting in good enough shape to make it through level 2 without feeling like I'm going to die.  I can tell a huge difference in my indurance, my strength, my weight, and my shape.      I've also been combining this with walking and a few other exercises here and there.  Mostly this and about 20 minutes of other activities a day.  I've been eating right, making sure I'm watching calories, fat, and carbs (I'm by no means an Adkin's dieter though).  So far, I've dropped 4.8 lbs since starting this workout dvd.  I've lost over an inch on my thighs, arms, and 2 inches on my waist.    I can't wait until I'm in good enough shape to say I made it to level 3!  Thanks, Jillian!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|With the death of vinyl and the advent of downloadable singles, it is a rare thing these days to listen to a real album, meaning a collection of songs that come together and tell a story.  I've never listened to much Coldplay but was intrigued by a few reviews of Viva la Vida, so I bought it.  The songs are melodically and instrumentally different, yet they somehow weave a cohesive sound and story. It is such a joy to listen to an album instead of a hit single or two surrounded by mediocrity.  Beautiful songs, lilting melodies, strong lyrics.
B0018SWA56|5.0|I loved Something Borrowed, but when I love Something Blue even more.  As I read the book, I got so caught up with the story and found myself saying \\"Oh my is this girl for real?\\".  I cried and laughed so many times.  I would definitely RAVE about this book to my friends.
0739365894|1.0|I guess it's time for Reacher to retire.  Bad Luck and Trouble was a disappointment.  This is a waste of time.  When I started fast forwarding on Disc One I knew there were serious problems with this book.  I quit halfway through Disc Two.      Reacher got stupid, thinking with a part of his body that does not include his brain.  I used to like Reacher because he was outside the routine testosterone nonsense that drives modern suspense novels.  Now Child has made him a boring, predictable male hero.  Yawn.    There is too much good stuff to read to waste time on this one.
0060989157|5.0|At least the title to this review sounds good. LOL<br /><br />Considering the book is over 400 pages long, I was surprised that I finished it in a day.  It is a very interesting novel although sometimes NOT well written, but then again some of Crue's songs were NOT well written either.  And yes this is coming from a long time fan of the band.<br /><br />I think what amazed me about this book was I finally figured out why I related to Motley Crue's music so well.  I lived a similar live story to Nikki, Vince, & Mick.  I went through alot of the same trials and faced many of the same demons these three members in particular faced.  And what I did not face in my life, I actually knew someone who sufered similar fates, that almost drove them over the edge.<br /><br />In retrospect to the book, I could mostly relate to Mick and his years of hidden back problems and pain. His condition is actually worse than the reason that I gave up playing guitar (Well not entirely).  THe swelling of the hands, stiffened fingers, and other problems makes playing guitar extremely hard, and for him to continue to play it so well, shows tat he truly wants to be remembered as a Guitar God.<br /><br />Other than similar fates i too went through (like Vinces loss of a young child)  the majority of what iread reminded me of friends I had when I was younger.  Nikki's story is mostly about his broken home, his drug addictions, and his marriages.  He reminds me of a lost soul that just needed to find a way of fitting in.<br /><br />Vince reminds me of former friends who are now members of either the Hell's Angels or Bandido Motorcycle gangs.  But the book laves you with the feeling he is NOT the angry grimy biker, but the one who joins just to see how much trouble he can get friends into.<br /><br />Tommy Lee; however, is the worst of the band. I really admired the guy until I read this novel.  After seeing Motley Crue quite a few times, I really thought Tommy was a thunder God.  However, after reading his story, I felt like he was more of the type of guy who would befriend you, then one night run out of the door with your wallet.  And although a lot of people give him grief over Pamela Anderson (or as Nikki calls her Yoko Ono), I feel for him on that aspect.  Pamela Anderson may be a blonde bombshell to some. But to me she reminds of a 2 bit prostitute (to keep it clean).  Afterall Pamela wrecked the careers of Scott Baio, Tommy Lee, and almost wreck Kid Rock's career.  I think she is the devil in disguise.  But then again that would not stop most guys from sleeping with her.<br /><br />Overall the book is great, but Not complete (as mentioned in the finale)<br />There a lot of stars mentioned in it (Like Mel Gibson, David Lee Roth, and a few others that are also either alcoholics, or drug addicts.) You will be surprised to here Dirt on several unsuspecting movie stars and rock stars who claim to have a squeaky clean image, but really do not.<br /><br />Well that is my quick review. and yes the book is worth everybit of the asking price.
B0017MO10U|4.0|The only thing that bothered me is that this already happened before. A few times in different ways. Several twists in the story keep you interested though. Can't wait for the blu-ray to come out so I can go buy it. Production and acting made it very believable. Just for that, I'm gonna go watch it again right now!
B001CXW8CW|5.0|I have NEVER really liked comic book movies....or batman movies for that matter....but my husband brought me along to view this movie...and I must admit it's amazing! The acting is super and it is actually a movie I will want to see again and again...I don't think I can wait until it's release on blu ray in december!
0446677450|5.0|This is not a get rich quick type book but it does help teach you ways to let your money work for you in simple terms. Things like why mutual funds are better than savings accounts, etc.  It goes back and forth from telling stories to giving advice which is a nice change from your standard boring money books.    Highly recommended.

B000002UA2|4.0|Sandwiched between two \\"core\\" Floyd albums (Meddle, Dark Side of the Moon), Obscured by Clouds is often overlooked by casual fans.  In reality, most fans of those two albums would enjoy this more-than-solid LP.    Stylistically, this album falls comfortably in the 1970-73 Floyd style.  The collaborative spirit that characterized Floyd in the late 60s and 70s is fully present, with the only exception being that the results are packaged into a relatively compact form (no songs over 6 minutes in length).    The songs with vocals are generally in a fairly straight-ahead rock style.  \\"What's Uh... the Deal\\" is really the highlight here, a beautiful  slightly folkish tune.  Gilmour's \\"Childhood's End\\" anticipates \\"Time\\" stylistically, while Waters's \\"Free Four\\" (an otherwise unremarkable tune) foreshadows his later interest in darker themes.  The two Rick Wright tunes are nice and pleasant if a little too soft-rockish for some fans.    The instrumentals are also relatively straightforward, with little of the experimentation present on A Saucerful of Secrets or Ummagumma.  \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" and \\"When You're In\\" were played together live and function as a fine intro.  \\"Mudmen\\" is also great - a combination of psychedelic keyboards with intense, wailing guitar solos.  (Clearly an antecedent for \\"Marooned\\", on The Division Bell.)    Many fans of Pink Floyd's most popular albums will find lots of material to enjoy here.  Recommended.

B000002U82|5.0|There are over a thousand reviews for this album and it's tough to find anything new to say about it.  It's a great album of enjoyable music, probably Pink Floyd's most well-rounded recording and one that has held up strongly over the past 35 years.  \\"Time\\", \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Us and Them\\", \\"The Great Gig\\" - these are all classics.  Perhaps the only real drawback is that we've all heard each a million times; they can't help being overplayed.    My only additional comment is that, despite being lumped in with other popular Pink Floyd albums of the mid- and late 1970s, it is stylistically more similar to the early 1970s albums Atom Heart Mother, Meddle and Obscured by Clouds.  The key difference from earlier albums is the presence of Roger Waters's dark, cynical lyrics (though the extreme bitterness of later efforts isn't here yet).  But the music, just as on those earlier albums, is a full collaboration between four band members - not the effort of one man, with a few companions filling in as session musicians.  That would change on subsequent albums, and in my opinion not for the better.
0143036742|1.0|I recently picked this book up used at my local library for $1. The cover burst advertised that it was nominated for a Man Booker Prize, and the back cover copy boasted that it was an international bestseller that was shortlisted for the Orange Prize.<br /><br />My thoughts on that after reading the book: WTF?<br /><br />The quick synopsis of the plot is this: Gold-digging Ukrainian immigrant hussy latches on to an elderly Ukrainian widower in England, marries him, and tries to take his money and his house. His two adult daughters (Vera and Nadezhda) try to prevent it from happening. And that's pretty much it. There is an attempt at incorporating many zany characters along the way, and we learn about Vera and Nadezhda's strained relationship, and their relationship with their kooky father. Oh, and every single character is disgusting and hate-able. I almost found myself rooting for the hussy.<br /><br />Man, this book needed an editor, or at least one more (ruthless) revision. But it was nominated for the Booker, so what the hell do I know? What I do know, though, is this manuscript as is would never have made it out alive if presented to my writer's group.<br /><br />For instance, the author doesn't seem to have much confidence in her own writing. Written in the first person of the Nadezhda character, the narrative is constantly interrupted by the character's explanation of things in parenthesis. Even during dialogue! And it is a constant interruption. More than a handful of times I just wanted to scream out, \\"Let the f-ing characters talk! Stop interrupting!\\"<br /><br />The other no-no that the author does is to somehow allow her lead first-person narrator to know what someone else is thinking. This is after the old man's young wife is treating him particularly bad:<br /><br />Maybe he would beat her if he could, but he cannot. For the first time he realises how helpless he is. His heart fills with despair.<br /><br />Oh really? How do you know this, Nadezhda? My writer's group would have taken me to task if I had presented them with this.<br /><br />As a writer, you are influenced by many authors and countless books. Sometimes you'll read something so good (think John Irving in his prime) that it inspires you, and shows you just how transcending the written word can be. Then you have a novel like this--which also influences you as a writer. By showing you what not to do.<br /><br />I need to read some Owen Meany now to cleanse myself. I feel so dirty.

B000024D4R|3.0|Animals was the first in a trilogy of Pink Floyd albums dominated by Roger Waters' lyrical and (eventually) musical ideas.  I am in a minority on this matter, but I think this domination of the band had a negative impact on the band's music and creativity.  While many Floyd fans - particularly those new to the band - will find Animals to be appealing, partly due to the fact that it has not suffered the radio overplay of Dark Side or The Wall - those who like the collaborative and more diverse nature of earlier Floyd albums may be disappointed.    Unlike The Wall and The Final Cut, which moved Floyd to a more radio-friendly, short song format, Animals sticks to the lengthy epics of early albums.  The instrumental sound of the music is quite similar to that on Wish You Were Here, and there are still quite a few lengthy instrumental passages.  But those passages tend to be fairly straightforward, with little of the spacy and abstract \\"head music\\" of Floyd's earlier work.  Gilmour's guitar playing dominates throughout; Rick Wright, aside from a very nice electric piano solo at the beginning, is limited to textural work.  \\"Dogs\\" is probably the best of the bunch - especially the first half - followed by \\"Sheep\\".  The two \\"Pigs on the Wing\\" bookends are actually quite lovely and tend to be overlooked.  And I've always found \\"Pigs\\" to be completely boring, just mainstream 70s rock dragged to an unnecessary length - but again, I'm in a minority here.    Waters's lyrics are the second key component here, and your assessment of the album will ultimately ride on how you feel about them.  I personally find the Animals theme to be uninteresting rather than clever.  It doesn't help that Waters's voice, occasionally effective but more often hectoring (it would get worse on later albums), ends up keeping the emotional range of the music very narrow.    Overall, not a bad listen - but Pink Floyd's preceding albums are generally better.
B000NA28I4|4.0|Going into this movie, I was expecting a mediocre and boring piece of film which would fall into the cracks of movies never to return again. Instead, it's like one of those strange 80's fantasy films which didn't fit into the whole feel of the day, but holds enough charm to one day become a backwoods classic. Think \\"Labyrinth\\" and other such movies. And contrary to the opinion of so many ravingly insane and stalker-like fans, this movie isn't half-bad.<br /><br />I don't know where all the \\"Star Wars\\" comparisons were coming from, except for that suspicious sunset scene. But anyways, this felt a lot like Lord of The Rings. And that's what this movie aspires to be, with the Peter Jackson like pans of the journey over breath-taking landscapes. Who know Hungry could look that good?<br /><br />So while this movie doesn't exactly do anything new, I didn't really expect it to be, when all fantasy works steal off each other anyway. This movie is a combination of those Tolkienesque quest epics, and those dragon movies which never seemed to strike a chord with audiences. See that's 90's dragon movie whose name I can't think of, and that Christian Bale evil dragon film which I kinda liked.<br /><br />Another bad point to this movie is just the poor choice of director and writer. If you're going to do a big movie like this, don't give it to a first-timer. And as for writer, let's just say it's fun to guess what the character is going to say, before they actually say it. Fun game.<br /><br />As for characters, Eragon is likeable, yet immature and stupid. Jeremy (love that name) Irons does the best with what he is given. And the girl, what can I say, she doesn't look half-bad. But here's a question while we're at it. Is all Elvish the same? Do Lord of The Rings Elves, and Eragon Elves speak the same language? And why do they sound so different from Santa Clause Elves?<br /><br />Anyways, the bad guys on the other hand, are pretty bad, mean, cardboard, evil, and you wish for them to go away, in a bad way. And those soldiers sure seem a lot like Orcs. Here's another question. Why did Rachel Weiz lose her English accent for her dragon role? I didn't even know it was her.<br /><br />But onto the good points. The action, while not original, is entertaining. The sword fights are cool, and the battles, while not exactly impressive, are interesting. The story, while not original, is interesting, and mostly keeps your attention. It also avoids the ugly fate of Golden Compass, by keeping down the confusing mythology. Although they could have cut down on the Elvish a little bit.<br /><br />But for the best part of the movie, let's give a round of applause for the director. Because I thank him for keeping the movie a little more than an hour and a half. Not 3 hours, not 2 hours. Just a nice little hour and a 38 minutes. But although this is a very nice running time, the director could have easily cut down many scenes to make this a true 1 hour and a 1/2.<br /><br />Overall, while not exactly original or brilliant, it's Lord of The Rings light. It keeps you interested throughout the whole movie, it has some cool sequences, and some characters are pretty likeable. And again, I like the running time. So don't listen to the crazed and mentally unstable fanatics of the much-overrated book, this movie could have been a whole lot worse.<br /><br />Real Score: 3.5diers sure seem a lot like Orcs.

0790749858|3.0|Why didn't they animate Michael Jordon? He's a block of wood.     Thank you.    Overall, I liked the movie, but the basketball star of the film was what dragged it down. A lot of people wanted this to be a big summer block buster, but it was dragged down by a man who thought he could do everything.    Too bad.
B0000UJDLM|2.0|I really like this movie, but was disappointed with the DVD. It claims a widescreen aspect ratio, but it is actually a 4:3 presentation with black bars at the top and bottom which simulates widescreen. My TV can compensate for this somewhat but the producers of the DVD really missed the mark.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I am a big fan of the books Eragon and Eldest...So when I first heard they were making a movie I was excited...Until I watched the movie...Not even close to the book...This was the worst cross over from book to movie ever...I did hear Peter Jackson is making Naomi Novik's book series Temeraire So let's hope it is much better then this crap they gave us...
B001AW9DKK|2.0|Im a big CSN&Y fan since the 60's but this is not CSN&Y it's Neil Young and his friends.  My political views are my own so I will only comment on the music.  All the new songs are Youngs and they are all anti-war songs and thats fine if you like that.  I love the actual music but the words sound child like to me.  Crosby and Nash's songs were great but where is Stills?  You only really hear him on \\"For What It's Worth\\"!<br />To me this is a Neil Young anti-war anti-Bush and his band (CSN) to help.  I'd love to hear a true CSN&Y concert with all 4 members as equal partners.  Old and new songs!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie makes you cry because it is so beautiful. Excellent acting by the animation & the voices. I shared this movie with my 1st granddaughter & am just waiting for my 2nd granddaughter to become old enough to appreciate it. Just lovely!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is amazingly intriguing. I went through the entire season in 3 sittings and was captivated by every episode. In this season, there are many flashbacks that reveal Dexter's childhood and how he managed to hide his dark character beneath a veneer of civility. I highly recommend this series for anyone who likes crime and silence of the lambs.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|This is an all time funny classic with an all star cast. It keeps you smiling the whole time!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The many big words I used in the title of this review aren't enough to describe how absolutley wonderful this show is.  I get frustrated trying to describe it, because I really can't.  But I'll try.  In a most literal sense, you do have to see it to believe it.      First off, I can't think of a single casting mistake in this series.  Everyone personifies their characters and they portray the life in the West Wing with precision that can be best described as genius.  I won't even try to list all of them, but I MUST mention the beloved, late John Spencer's last performance as the no-nonsense Chief of Staff Leo McGarry.  Once again, you must see him to believe him, but if this show was eligable for Oscars, he would win a Best Supporting Actor every year the show was running.    The script is brilliant.  Original writer Aaron Sorkin left after Season 4, but the great writing continued.  Each episode makes me: 1) Think about the current state of the government and what we could do to improve it, 2)Laugh out loud more than once, and 3) Move me and inspire me to a point that no other show/movie can.  While I watch these episodes they invoke every feeling in me, from laughter to sadness.      For all Republicans that won't watch the show because of the liberal position of Bartlett and his staff, I say this: I'm a Republican and I adore this show.  This whole matter can be summed up in a quote from director/producer Thomas Schelamme: \\"Democrats come up to me and say 'we love your politics and your show'.  Republicans come up to me and say 'we hate your politics, but we love your show anyway'.\\"    The score by Snuffy Walden is beautiful and memorable.  The supporting characters are well-drawn out and well-acted.  The show has many good messages as well; all of the characters love and care for each other, they are all patriots who sacrifice for the well-being of the country, and when they screw up, they apologize.    Some of the best episodes are:  Debate Camp  Galileo  Shibboleth  Pilot  Batlet's Third State of Union  Inauguration: Over There  In Excelsis Deo  Noel  Bartlet for America  Two Cathederals  Posse Comitatous  The Supremes  Full Disclosure    I'll stop writing now, as you've probably read enough.  I really can't begin to recommend this show enough.  Just borrow it, rent it, or even buy it.  Give it a chance, and you'll be amazed.  Trust me.
B000007T1M|4.0|In the age of the new millenium, there were many metal bands whose metal was extremely downcast and anarchistic, but very few of them really distinguished themselves. System of a Down was one band than set themselves apart from the crowd--they clearly had a political leftist fury, but they had a sense of humor too.<br /><br />\\"Sugar,\\" System of a Down's first single, was just plain weird. It alternates between a swing drum beat and a heavy guitar burst, and Serj is singing about oppression, but in quirky monologues about kicking his girl in the \\"Ooh! Baby! She's okay!\\" I have to admit that I really passed this single off as a cheesy 90s comedy song, but gradually I loved listening to them.<br /><br />System of a Down has a Middle Eastern-style to them as well, with very characteristic chord progressions. The guitarists were incredible for making heavy metal sound far different than it ever sounded.<br /><br />Whether Serj is yelping weird lyrics in \\"Ddevil\\" or screaming in \\"Suite-Pee,\\" he really showed that metal had so many dimensions. In \\"P.L.U.C.K.\\" Serj Tankian shows off his maddening anger at genocide, screaming \\"Die! Why?!? Walk Down! Walk Down!\\".<br /><br />And the drummer really knows how to set the band in different beat rhythms, sometimes playing in a seven beat rhythm, then switching back to four beats. He sure knows how to slide in those speedy drum rolls and offbeat rhythms.<br /><br />This debut shows that System of a Down clearly makes a half-anarchist, half-hilarious lineup of songs so entertaining. Clearly System of a Down is going to be remembered for being one the craziest, but most eclectic metal bands around.
B0002ZDVEU|5.0|XXXXX<br /><br />This movie is loosely based on the 1986 novel of the same name by Robert Ludlum (1927 to 2001).  The plot also incorporates aspects of the Bourne novel \\"The Bourne Legacy\\" (2004) written by Eric Van Lustbader (born: 1946).<br /><br />It is a sequel to 2002's \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (as is 2007's \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\").<br /><br />This movie continues the story of Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), an amnesiac and former CIA assassin, and his attempt to learn more of his past.  This time the CIA what's to bring him in.  Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), a CIA Deputy Director and Task Force Chief who is pursuing Bourne says this more forcefully:<br /><br />\\"We're going to find this son of a b**ch and take him down.  I'm not having Jason Bourne destroy any more of this agency.\\"<br /><br />Awesome fight scenes and breath-taking car chase scenes are two major highlights of this movie making it a state-of-the-art espionage thriller.  This movie is more dialogue driven compared to the first one making it for me, actually better than the first movie.<br /><br />Matt Damon as Jason Bourne effectively carries the entire movie.  Kudos should also go to Joan Allen as Director Pamela Landy for her intriguing performance.  I found the background music to be quite exhilarating.<br /><br />The various action scenes employ shaky camera work making them sometimes difficult to follow.  Some people may be put off by this but I found that this technique gave the movie a gritty, realistic, and edgy feel.<br /><br />Total box office for this movie was about two hundred and eighty-eight million, surpassing that brought in by \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (about two hundred and fourteen million).<br /><br />Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2004) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  There are many extras including an alternate ending.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie effectively continues the plight of a new action hero named Jason Bourne!!!<br /><br />(2004; 1 hr 40 min (excluding end credits), wide screen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXding end credits), wide screen;  24 scenes)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen Pletko, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX

B000J103PC|4.0|We all know the boss.  The man/woman who knows it all and tramples on everyone.  I've worked for her; you probably have too.<br />\\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" is the \\"simple\\" story of a young college graduate, Andy (Anne Hathaway), trying to find a job.  She looks at a fashion magazine, Runway, whose editor-in-chief, Miranda (Meryl Streep), is so harsh that girls who last one year as her assistant are granted \\"any job they set their heart on\\".  The problem?  Andy is so not into fashion, it's not funny.  And Miranda is, well...\\"difficult\\".<br />I was unsure if I would actually enjoy the film.  I had heard mixed reviews.  But after finally seeing it for myself, I realized that on the whole, I enjoyed it.  Anne Hathaway has the \\"My Fair Lady\\" role down-pat.  Emily Blunt is very appealing as Emily, the desperate assistant.  Even the actor who plays Nigel is charming.  But Meryl Streep as Miranda is the star of the show.  She steals the screen every time she appears, with enormous presence, a cool gaze, and her quiet, demanding voice.<br />The other characters are weak.  We as the audience are supposed to be rooting for Andy to spend more time with her friends, but when her boyfriend, Nate, acts like a baby when she has to work on his birthday, you can't help but dislike them (I mean, come on, how many adults REALLY celebrate their birthday on their actual birth date?).  When Nate says it would be better for her to be a pole stripper with integrity (what the...?!) than what she is, you want to kick him where the sun don't shine.<br />The plot is not complicated, well done, but the big \\"turning points\\" can be seen a mile away (such as Andy's conversion to fashion, her being chosen to go to Paris, and her eventual quitting).  The clothes are beautiful (well, some of them are odd, but that's coming from a Wal-Mart girl :) ), the pacing perfect, and the scenery (particularly Paris) beautiful.  There is some foul language, a scene where a woman gets hit by a car, some allusions to eating disorders, the overall impression that clothes size does matter (Andy ends the film as a \\"satisfied\\" size 4 after being a \\"fat\\" size 6) and some sexual situations, but nothing particularly glaring.<br />Overall, I liked the film.  It is a great story of a young woman trying to justify her job with her morals.  While I did not like how her friends (particularly her boyfriend) did not understand that sometimes you have to do things you don't like (aka your job) to pay the rent (and get the expensive purses that your friend rather enjoys) and that fun things will have to come later, it is a really good movie that showcases Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway's talents.<br /><br />NOTE (Sep. 10, 2009): Another irk I had with the movie was the terrible job interviews.  No one with half a brain will go into a job interview and admit that the only reason they are there is because it was their last resort.  I can pretty much tell you they will be leaving unemployed.  Secondly, people who are interviewing for jobs ought to check out the place they are interviewing.  That is just basic interviewing common sense.  Lastly, using slang like \\"screwing up\\" and admitting you made mistakes is, contrary to what the film shows, not going to endear you to your future employer.  Always use proper formal language and never try to sell yourself short.  You admit failures; you are basically saying that you aren't worth hiring.<br /><br />Brought to you by<br />*C.S.

B000ZOXDFA|4.0|Having enjoyed the first 'Elizabeth' so much, I was prepared to be disappointed in the second. It was reviewed as more concerned with costuming than acting. Call me crazy, I loved it. Cate Blanchett is a powerful Elizabeth. At no point did I feel the costumes outweighed the cast. While the first movie is still my favorite, I wouldn't have missed this.

B0019EXZY4|4.0|Jason Statham has become an action anti-hero icon. Beginning his film career with LOCK STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS, Statham continued on to film the TRANSPORTER films, CRANK and last year's WAR. The time has come for him to venture out of his pure action grind and head into the world of drama. He does so with the release this week of THE BANK JOB.<br /><br />THE BANK JOB is the true story of a group of low level criminals in 1971 London who are recruited to rob a bank's safe deposit boxes. Without being aware, the group is hired to do so by the British Secret Service.<br /><br />The Service' real reason for the heist is for these thieves to get a set of pictures showing Princess Margaret in an uncompromising position. Those photos belong to a black militant named Michael X (Peter De Jersey) and are his get out of jail free card when it comes to his trial. The pictures were stored there on the advice of London pornographer Lew Vogel. Unbeknownst to the Service, Vogel has his own valuable stored in the vault as well, a ledger that shows all of the payoffs to corrupt police in town.<br /><br />An ex-model named Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), caught smuggling drugs, is recruited by the Service to pull off the heist in turn for her freedom. and in turn for her freedom. Martine starts the ball rolling and the criminals she chooses are an odd mixture of friends led by Terry Leather (Statham), a crook trying to go straight with a car dealership but at the same time in debt to the wrong people. The score will net him enough money to pay them off and be free.<br /><br />The first part of the film details the group planning the robbery. It moves forward giving background on a multitude of players who all have something to hide and the evidence of it stored in the vault. From there we are transported to the actual heist which involves tunneling into the vault via an abandoned store two doors down.<br /><br />As they tunnel their way in, they use a lookout to make sure no police arrive to check things out. But this lookout and his walkie talkie are picked up by a ham radio operator who gets the police involved. The only problem is which bank is it being looted?<br /><br />The heist goes off without an arrest and the crooks head out to split the spoils of their deed. At the same time, a number of government officials (pictures of each at a local brothel part of the stolen property) get in on the case, the Service wants the pictures they started this whole thing for and Vogel wants his log book.<br /><br />Can Terry and the gang get away with this robbery, the biggest since the great train robbery with an estimated $3 million stolen? Or will they find themselves squeezed between the real crooks, the Secret Service and the corrupt police? You'll have to watch to find out.<br /><br />The entire cast does a fantastic job of not only settling into the skin of their characters but of playing the time period to perfection as well. Statham finally gets to show he has some acting chops which hopefully will lead to more roles like this one.<br /><br />Director Roger Donaldson (DANTES PEAK, COCKTAIL, NO WAY OUT) does the story justice as well, bringing it to life on the screen. In his hands what could have been a boring caper film is instead filled with rich characters and situations that leave your palms damp with anticipation and a caring for the people involved. Sure they're thieves but you hope they get away with it.<br /><br />Plenty of stories to go round, plenty of threads that are all tied up by films end and plenty of action for those who expect it. But in the end this movie gives more than mere action. It gives a true story a touch of heart.his lookout and his walkie talkie are picked up by a ham radio operator who gets the police involved.

0316010669|3.0|A fascinating book, but as others have pointed out too many of the ideas here rely on anecdotal information.  I got the feeling after a while that the author cherry-picked the stories he wanted to tell in order to bolster his thesis, and that another researcher could just as easily have formed a different thesis about decision making by selecting different stories.    Another thing about this book that struck me, as odd, was the author's obsession with a person's appearance, particularly whether the person was short or tall.  Some of the descriptions are as follows.  P22, 'he is short and very charming'  P49, `he is a small and irrepressible man'  P61, `a tall, striking woman'  P73, `his bigness of frame'  P87, `who is both on the short side - five foot nine - and black'  P99,  `is tall and lean with a gleaming bald dome'  P132, `is a tall man with a runner's slender build'  P148, `is very tall and strikingly handsome'  P190, `He was short and unassuming'  P197, `He was short and thick'  P202, `although he is of medium build, he seems much larger'  P251, `is tiny'    Seldom does the person's size matter to the thesis about decision making that the author presents.  Even in the last example where a woman musician is described as `tiny', Gladwell admits that her size ought not to determine whether she is hired to play the French horn.  Yet throughout the book he includes a person size as though it has some importance to his argument.  This just struck me as perverse, and I wondered at his 'decision' for including this mostly useless information.

B0015519VS|2.0|Here I Stand, Usher's first album since 2004's uber-hit Confessions, is your standard Usher disc. Ridiculously built lothario with velvet pipes sings about sex, declarations of love, sex, contemplations of love past, and, uh, more sex. There is one little thing, however, that quite effectively separates Here I Stand from Usher's earlier work: the ultimate bachelor is now the ultimate husband.<br /><br />It's a small distinction, as Usher still sings things like \\"you order Chinese food before you do me\\" and \\"I'm always on the top tonight I'm on the bottom / cuz we trading places,\\" but this is balanced with observations like \\"wash the car / I'm gonna walk the dog / take out the trash\\" on the same song (\\"Trading Places\\"). Usher's still down to get dirty, but it's a monogamous playground nowadays.<br /><br />While not necessarily a bad thing, it does tend to stunt the album's momentum with interludes like the embarrassingly sappy \\"Prayer For You [Interlude]\\" and the corny \\"Lifetime.\\" Usher's more standard bedroom songs aren't much better, with songs like the above \\"Trading Places\\" and \\"This Ain't Sex\\" sounding mechanical and uninspired at worst, mediocre R&B jams at best.<br /><br />The best and catchiest song on the record is the first single, \\"Love In This Club,\\" even though it does have Young Jeezy grunting \\"I'll set you free / sexily, mentally, emotionally.\\" Sexily? Really?<br /><br />Usher's voice is as strong and assured as ever, and his choice of guest artists is spotless. Jay-Z's cameo on \\"Best Thing\\" is particularly effective, breaking up the lover-boy monotony of the surrounding songs. The production is solid, but at a titanic eighteen songs and 74 minutes, the album could've used a more discerning editor to cut away some of the overblown ballads.<br /><br />It was inevitable that the follow-up to Confessions would fall under the shadow of its predecessor, even after four years, but Here I Stand's lack of distinctive hits and its unfortunate tendency to drag along makes it a step down for the king of male R&B. Marriage may be good for the man, but it sure makes for boring music.g of male R&B. Marriage may be good for the man, but it sure makes for boring music.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|On hot and sweltering days such as this, there is no greater feeling than cooling off for a moment. If all the playing in the heat that you do on a daily basis has you running ragged, perhaps it is about time that you Coldplay instead for a moment.<br /><br />Though each Coldplay album to date has had a respectable amount of fanfare and musical success and respect bestowed upon them, perhaps their newest album is set to be taken as the best musical album to date that will likely gain the same praise and admiration of Coldplay's other works.<br /><br />Formed in 1997, Coldplay has put out three previous albums before their newest release Viva La Vida. And while their music has always been nothing short of remarkable, it is on this album that Coldplay has been able to draw a line in the sand and separate their music from so many other mainstream bands that are out right now. The music on this album is fresh and invigorating and the album leaves the listener almost with a certain sense of musical awe once the entire album has been played through.<br /><br />Coldplay is comprised of Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman, Will Champion and Phil Harvey.<br /><br />One need not look any further than the track of Cemeteries of London to understand that the music on this album relies heavily upon not just dynamic instrumentation but also the always impressive vocals of Chris Martin. While their other albums have been able to highlight this important relationship well enough, it is on this album that the symbiosis between the vocals and the music is truly perfected.<br /><br />There are two major radio favorites off of this album and these two tracks follow one another on the album. Viva La Vida and Violet Hill certainly are the most played tracks on the radio but that is of no surprise since these two tracks truly accentuate the album's brilliance.<br /><br />Viva La Vida has a very catchy lyrical component to the track and there is an almost orchestral sound infused into the track that provides an unbelievably robust sound to the track. The song has a very broad base sound that certainly would appeal to many demographics which is proof positive as to why it can be heard on so many radio frequencies across the globe.<br /><br />Violet Hill on the other hand has probably garnered so much widespread radio time because it has an almost concert like feel to it. The instrumentation is a bit more dissonant yet maintains a powerful and heavy sound while the vocals range from very low points to much higher ranges throughout the track. This song is the quintessential concert style song as you can simply visualize the people at a Coldplay concert rocking out to this song when the band starts playing it.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />1. Life in Technicolor<br />2. Cemeteries of London<br />3. Lost!<br />4. 42<br />5. Lovers in Japan/ Reign of Love<br />6. Yes<br />7. Viva La Vida<br />8. Violet Hill<br />9. Strawberry Swing<br />10. Death and All His Friends<br /><br />There is nothing flashy about Viva La Vida, rather, the album is simply put more of Coldplay doing what they do best: putting out some pretty awesome music. The album accurately reflects the capabilities of this band that has seen an unbelievable amount of success in the just over ten years since their first album was released.<br /><br />But just as a wine grows finer with age, so does the quality of Coldplay's work. In no means is that a slant against the prior albums of the band. Rather, it is perhaps the best praise that could be given to the album Viva La Vida, an album that reaches new and higher levels of musical excellence not just for this band, but for music in general.<br /><br />Viva La Vida is on the Capital Records label and was produced by Brian Eno.<br /><br />For more information about Coldplay, check out their website at [...]t sound to the track.

B0013FDM7E|4.0|I don't over analyze movies, so I will keep this real short.<br /><br />I never read the book, but instantly picked up on the influence from the \\"Night/Day/Dawn of the Dead\\" movies.  In fact, that was basically what I expected to see: a remake of a \\"dead\\" movie with a bunch of flashy CGI effects and Will Smith one-liner quips.<br /><br />Surprisingly, not only were the flashy CGI effects included, but the movie actually did have quite a bit of substance to it.  The Fresh Prince also only had a few one-liners, less it would have spoiled the overall dark tone of the movie.<br /><br />Overall, it was enjoyable.  Just sit back, relax, and watch it.  Usually, I find Will Smith's movies enjoyable in a mindless sort of way, but he actually did strike a few chords of emotions in this movie.

B0002V7ODI|5.0|It's hard to be a freak, even when you have been brought to life by Rasputin, Hitler and a few other crazy humans. But even Satan can fall in love with another freak of his type and even Satan can be attached to the catholic professor who became his father, the one who provided him with candy and sweets, because Satan has a sweet tooth. Satan somewhere is slightly human and a tiny bit catholic. A cross may burn his palm but when it has been served to him for sixty years by a benevolent old man who he considers his father he may start to like it, to love him and then to hate those who are on the other side. Don't expect any kind of deep emotional feelings though but expect some beautiful special effects that look so realistic that they will make you thrill and shiver. And what's more they will be exotic and lead you to rainy New York City and snowy Moscow and underground everywhere, in the NYC subway or in some Russian cemetery. You will meet with dead people who are revived and then can lead you to the very center of hell, or with surgical fetishists who have recomposed their bodies bone by bone and muscle by muscle. But the most attractive element is in the use of fire, the fascination with fire and that has to do with the constant reference to the apocalypse, that of the Book of Revelation of course? Fire seen as the ultimate cleansing element that can bring the universe to its end or destroy up all evil from earth. The ambivalence of this fire is fairly surprising in many ways since most people are afraid of fire and here it is the ultimate redeeming element. It is true when you are surrounded by meters of snow and tons of ice you are grateful for one little small fire in the living room hearth. And be satisfied: the FBI director who is in charge will end up locked up underground to die peacefully, at least deep enough for no one to be pestered by his protest and yelling.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en YvelinesUniversity Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines

B000002OZY|4.0|In their late '60's - early '70's heyday, the Who were an incredible, transcendent band.  However, I can't help but feel that studio recordings failed to do justice to their intense, dynamic, and energetic sound (until \\"Who's Next,\\" that is).  In an old edition of the Rolling Stone Record Guide, John Swenson hit the nail on the head:  \\"The early Who albums present one of the most interesting problems posed in rock & roll history.  The band was considered at the time to be much better in live performance than on record...\\"  After listening to live renditions of \\"Tommy\\" (especially the great \\"Live at Leeds\\" deluxe edition), I can't agree more.      First of all, the studio \\"Tommy\\" feels padded, perhaps to extend it to double-record length.  There are a few forgettable songs (the sequence from \\"Sensation\\" to \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\\" comes to mind), a couple of head-scratchers (how does Sonny Boy Williamson's \\"Eyesight to the Blind\\" fit in?), and some songs (particularly \\"Underture\\") seem over-extended.  Second, the production, on the whole, is too tidy and rather flat:  we get little of Townshend's roaring electric guitar, and the band, in general, sounds too careful - like they're trying not to color outside the lines.  However, all of these flaws go out the window in the live performances from 1969/70.  The band trimmed some of the fat (cutting several numbers and shortening others), and, more important, they summoned up a monumental energy and collective spirit that made \\"Tommy\\" an overwhelming - and yes, cohesive - listening experience (something that, ironically, the studio record does not accomplish with total success).  After hearing and seeing scalding live versions of \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" (the Woodstock video footage is incredible), I actually have a hard time listening to the studio version.  The same applies to \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and \\"We're Not Gonna Take It.\\"  Live, as in so many of the band's peak performances, they throw caution to the wind and play on the brink of total implosion, led by Keith Moon's frantic drumming.        Okay, after all this complaining, why four stars?  To be honest, I considered \\"Tommy\\" an unquestioned five-star album until I heard these live renditions.  Over time, the studio album's flaws became more apparent to me.  However, there are some incredible songs here, and it really is the record that took The Who to the proverbial \\"next level.\\"  I actually prefer the studio version of \\"Christmas\\" to the live ones (which lack the excited, \\"chirping\\" background vocals).  \\"Cousin Kevin\\" is a great - though disturbing - John Entwistle song that was almost never performed live.  \\"Go to the Mirror!\\" and \\"Smash the Mirror\\" form a powerful central climax, with Daltrey's vocals working superbly.  In addition, I do enjoy many of the production touches only possible in the studio, such as Entwistle's horn overdubs and some of the background vocal \\"choir\\" effects.    In conclusion, I can't bring myself to give this record fewer than four stars, but if you haven't heard the \\"Leeds\\" version yet, please check it out.  I must warn you, though:  you'll never hear the studio version with the same ears again.
B000XV6VOK|5.0|The terms \\"bodice-ripper\\" and \\"melodrama\\" have been applied--pretty aptly--to this telling of Tudor history, but that's what makes it such great fun (aside from Cardinal Wolsey's suicide, which was ridiculous and insulting to viewers who possess even a modicum of knowledge about history).  Like others, I lament the fact that Natalie Dormer will not return next season (it's kinda hard to speak your lines when your head has been struck from your neck) but I don't think the plot moved too quickly.  Here's my concern: Showtime is notorious for axing series before they reach any type of satisfying conclusion.  I just hope we can make it through to wife VI before the plug on this wonderful drama is pulled.  Four more wives = four more seasons.  I have my fingers crossed that we'll make it.

0375842209|4.0|Although this book is quite lengthy (550 pages), it is a quick read. It is based on the life of a young girl who lives in Europe during WWII. It is often told from the perspective of death, which is an interesting way to not only write a fictional work, but to view one. There are some parts that are very heart-wrenching while others merely tell the story of a young girl growing up. I would recommend it.
0743455967|5.0|With nearly 600 reviews of this book there is very little need for any new reviews.  I mainly want to record my five-star vote for the excellence of this book.  I have to confess that I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King.  I read very little horror fiction and as a result have only read a couple of King's books.  Nonetheless, I have lately been toying with the idea of writing a fictional work of my own (all of my previous work, without exception, has been nonfiction, and within that virtually all academic).  I thought this would provide a good practical guide to someone like myself.  Regardless of one's opinion of King, he clearly has no trouble putting pen to paper.  I have to say that as a practical aid this book far surpassed what I was hoping for.<br /><br />The title is a slight misnomer.  King does not discuss writing in general, but very specifically narrative fiction.  He wants to help someone who wants to write a yarn.  His advice is perfect for someone like me, who wants to take a first stab at creating a new story.  I actually have a rough idea of what sitting down to write would be like and approximately what I need to do need.  If I actually write what I hope, this small book could play an important role in that.<br /><br />The book is, however, more than a writing guide.  As the title makes clear it is also a memoir of King's life as a writer.  It isn't a full-blown biography, but a record of what his life as a writer has been like.  But because King famously suffered a near fatal traffic accident while he was writing this, he lingers a bit longer on this than other parts of his life.  But, as Michael Scott might say, \\"It's all good.\\"  I enjoyed both the writing guide and the memoir.  I highly recommend both.<br /><br />Part of what led me to read this was reading King's columns in Entertainment Weekly.  I've been quite surprised to discover that I share more interests in books, TV, and music than I would have expected.  King is someone I think would be fun to argue with about all of these.

B000ZLFALS|5.0|I'm not a huge Beatles fan, but I like their music and this movie was recommended from a Pink Floyd board that I visit.  I wasn't sure what to expect as I was going into this movie.  But I liked the way that they used the Beatles songs.  I also liked the cinematography in this movie.    I liked the way that this movie portrayed the 60's.  And I was kind of surprised that it didn't show the protesters as being all lily white.    Anyways, good movie.
B0017R5UAA|1.0|They may be good musicians, and they may have a certain style, but I love alternative, 80's new wave, 90's grunge, 00's \\"alternative\\" (because this music and decade do not have a name)!  Fleet Foxes don't do anything for me at all, except make me wanna chew some 'baccy' and drink some \\"shine\\".  Far too folky and country for this rock 'n' roller!  If you love Deathcab and The Smiths (I love them both btw) and are turned off by Tool and Ministry (I love the too, btw), you will probably like this album.  I personally like music that has a much sharper, stainless steel edge.  This album is slow but happy, and comes across as wimpy, tame, and backward.  Thanks for the invitation, however, Amazon, I usually like your recommendations, but this was not one of them.    Oh, have any of you discovered the Dandy Warhols or Placebo?  Now, those are awesome alternative bands that never leave my cd player for long.
B00003CXPJ|3.0|The 2001 film ZOOLANDER is a comedy about two male models, the eminent Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) and the up-and-coming Hansel (Owen Wilson), who with the help of an investigative reporter (Christine Taylor) must thwart the plans of a megalomaniac fashion designer (Will Ferrell) to maintain third-world child sweatshop labour. Most of the humour in the film comes from Stiller's portrayal of Zoolander, a dimwitted manchild with a heart of gold, and the fact that the actor playing this male model isn't remotely glamourous. Myself, I really dig Hansel's character, the reincarnation of an Istanbul to Kathmandu trail hippie who resides in a festive warehouse flat with, among others, a Sherpa and a quartet of Finnish dwarves. The character is in some ways quite similar to that which Wilson played in THE ROYAL TENNENBAUMS, which appeared the same year. The supporting cast includes David Duchovny as a conspiracy theorist and Jerry Stiller as Zoolander's conflicted manager.<br /><br />What is really remarkable about the film, however, is the huge amount of cameos, with over 30 celebrities making brief appearances. Certainly the film will be thought-provoking for criticizing the rampant use of child sweatshop labor in the garment industry, while the Hollywood idols within it continue to support designer fashion.<br /><br />ZOOLANDER has entrenched itself into American culture, with quotations from the film popping up fairly often in the speech of my generation. While it is by no means a great work of art, it is sure to offer some laughs.
B0012909NQ|5.0|Although Genesis has been my all time favorite band by far since I first discovered them in the mid/late 70's, I only had the opportunity to see them live and in person twice, once in 1981 at Pittsburgh's Civic Arena, and later in 1992 at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.  Phil Collins broke from Mike Rutherford and Tony Banks (the only three surviving members of the original group) shortly after that 1992 tour, sadly.  Though Mike and Tony would put out one more album with Ray Wilson as lead singer under the name \\"Genesis\\" (\\"Calling All Stations\\" - see my review elsewhere here on Amazon), that whole gig never caught on with most fans and \\"Genesis\\" was shortly afterwards, officially, no more.  Until 15 years later, that is, when the guys finally got back together for their 2007 worldwide reunion tour.  It was a long wait, but I'm happy to report it was well worth it, as these aging dinosaurs of progressive/pop rock more than showed their many millions of fans around the globe that they still have that old Genesis magic.  And this three disc DVD set is simply stunning as a lasting document to their reunion and historic body of works, whether they ever tour again or put out (fingers crossed) any more new studio albums.<br /><br />As has been the case for more than two decades, Daryl Stuermer (guitars, bass guitars) and Chester Thompson (drums) remain part of the Genesis Live touring band, deservedly so after all of these years, and both add their usual proficient, professional aplomb and emotional expertise to the original trio's performances.  Now, in my mind, there have always been three different types of Genesis fans.  One, those who generally eschew the newer stuff (post-\\"Duke\\"), in favor of the older stuff (pre-\\"Abacab\\"), Two, those who loved the newer, shorter pop stuff more than the generally longer, progressive offerings, and Three, those who loved and have all along loved both.<br /><br />Let it be known, I fall into the last category, as I've personally been enchanted by and do still adore, almost everything this band has ever produced.  And while I might admit to more of a predilection for the older, on the whole, longer and more ethereal efforts, I strongly believe no true Genesis fan of whatever sort, will want to be without this enthralling triple disc DVD set.  For they bring effective, equal command, strength, effort, powerful and unassailable impressions and interpretations to every single old/new, shorter/longer song on this breathtaking endeavor.  And to those who pretty much dismiss the post-\\"Peter Gabriel\\" or post-\\"Duke\\" more pop-oriented efforts, I would just point to later, just as strong progressive masterpieces such as \\"Domino\\" (arguably my favorite Genesis song), \\"Home By the Sea,\\" and \\"Fading Lights\\" (played over the end credits), among several others.<br /><br />The packaging and artwork in this DVD set is excellent, as is the picture quality and stereo sound and channel separation prominence (the latter quite astounding, especially with a good speaker system and/or a good set of headphones).  The three DVD's are all easy to navigate, and provide the viewer with effortless choice selections, which adds to the value of repeated and future enjoyment.  And finally, captions are available in several different languages, including Japanese!<br /><br />Disc One contents include Duke's Intro, Turn It On Again, No Son Of Mine, Land Of Confusion, In The Cage (including excerpts from Cinema Show and Duke's Travels), Afterglow, Hold On My Heart, Home By The Sea, Follow You Follow Me, Firth of Fifth (excerpt), and I Know What I Like.<br /><br />Disc Two contents include Mama, Ripples, Throwing It All Away, Domino, Conversations With 2 Stools (drum duo with Chester and Phil), Los Endos, Tonight Tonight Tonight (excerpt), Invisible Touch, I Can't Dance, and Carpet Crawlers.<br /><br />Each track has its' own extras, available at the beginning of each song by pressing enter/ok/select on your DVD remote when a small \\"Duke\\" symbol appears or via the disc's main menu.  There are, in fact, tons of fascinating and sometimes very funny extras and behind-the-scenes surprises throughout.<br /><br />Finally, Disc Three contains a very informative and entertaining documentary called \\"Come Rain Or Shine\\" which chronicles in detail, the meticulous planning and preparations which led to the actual tour, various particulars of which began to take shape six months before the very first show.<br /><br />Genesis has always been a one of a kind band, as has their superlative staging, lighting, and background effects, but they really outdid even themselves for this free concert before over half a million appreciative fans of all ages.  Performing in front of the most colossal and most incredible and visually dazzling, choreographed CGI and other special effects setup I've ever seen, I doubt this aspect of the show will ever be surpassed.  But that's only the beginning, because the excellent camerawork and editing, great song choice selections (I especially enjoyed the inclusion of music from \\"Duke,\\" my favorite Genesis album), and audience interactions, add even more to each tune.  Phil Collins jumps around a lot less here than in his more youthful days, but his voice is still magnificent, as are his drumming and clowning skills.  Tony Banks remains the best keyboards player I've ever heard, and Daryl's soaring, solo guitar riffs in many pieces are nothing short of awe-inspiring.<br /><br />Overall, I have nothing whatsoever negative to say about this DVD set.  I was filled with ecstasy and tingles up my spine in so many instances, while other times the power and inherent messages within various pieces touched me deep within my heart and soul, as only Genesis music has ever been able to accomplish.  And finally, songs such as \\"Afterglow,\\" \\"Carpet Crawlers,\\" and \\"Ripples\\" brought tears (of joy) to my eyes as they always have, and always will.<br /><br />I've purchased many items from Amazon over the years, but this is without a doubt, the most satisfying, exceeding all of my expectations.

067182449X|4.0|If you're reading this sentence, I wager you've already read the book and are here because you want to see what other people think of it.<br /><br />Well, I'll TELL you what I think: it is a must-read, and bless you for having read it...especially if you did so without being coerced. You already know that Anne Frank was a bright girl...but still a pretty typical teenager, despite being placed in very atypical circumstances.<br /><br />You are as amazed as I am that eight people lived in close quarters for TWO years without (a) going completely ape-poop, or (b) killing one another. It's a testament to the Jewish capacity for sticking together...eight gentiles would not have lasted six months.<br /><br />Like me, you are pretty confident that Anne was indeed the primary author of the diary...but perhaps you are also suspicious that Otto Frank may have had a larger role in its authorship than simply excising five pages which were embarrassing to him.<br /><br />However, that doesn't bother you overmuch. The book does a superlative job of conveying what it must have been like for those people in that secret annex. The boredom, claustrophobia, frustration, despair, all subsumed by the ever-present fear of being discovered by the Germans...and the knowledge of exactly what discovery would mean.<br /><br />Perhaps you forget what you already knew beforehand, and read the final few entries with rising hope, as the Allies invade Europe, and begin the process of liberation. It won't be long now, you think along with Anne.<br /><br />And then with a prosaic navel-gazing entry, it abruptly ends. The epilogue explains the aftermath...and you can't help but shake your head at the fact that the Franks were SO CLOSE to freedom, and were ratted out for TEN DOLLARS. Anne dies of typhus at Bergen-Belsen only one month before Hitler kills himself.<br /><br />One month away, you say to yourself. Christ.
B001437DMA|4.0|It isn't anything groundbreaking like \\"Surfing With the Alien,\\" but \\"Professor Satchafunkilus\\" is still a great buy.    Upon the first two listens, it's clear that this is indeed Satch doing just what he wants. He never seems to run out of ideas, resulting in the plethora of albums he's put out. Just like his other albums, this one has its moments of mystery, happiness, funk, and anything in between.    Diehard Satch fans won't be disappointed, but if you're looking for the album of the year, you'll be disappointed. Still, chalk one up for this virtuoso!
B001AOKA3W|5.0|Let me start off by saying do not let these bad reviews stop you from renting this movie.  Everyone complains that Hollywood puts out the same crap (I admit, I am one of them) and when a movie like this comes along it gets slammed.<br /><br />Yes, the Camera is unstable.....but it's a friggin handheld camera being filmed while people are constantly panicked and running around New York....WTF did you expect?<br /><br />This movie is not for everyone though, if you are into the usual Hollywood flicks like the good guy goes off into the sunset, senseless violence with easy to comprehend story lines, trust me, this movie is NOT for you.<br /><br />Stick to \\"shoot'em up\\" otherwise if you want an original move that keeps you guessing until the end and wanting more, this is for you.<br /><br />(Though you probably won't be guessing until the end since everyone knows what the movie is about and what happens).
0446677450|1.0|Having slogged through this book, I feel I must submit a review to counter all of the breathless fanatacism. I found this book, not through being on the Best Seller list, but through a libary search for books to teach financial literacy to kids.    I am sure that with more than 2000 previous reviews, I can't say much that hasn't already been posted. But I'll add to the voices encouraging anyone who finds himself enchanted by this book to do a little research on the author. It took me very little time surfing the internet to learn that the book is not a \\"true story\\" and that the author's credentials as a real estate investor as suspect. These two things alone undermine the credibility of the advice contained herein.    I will admit that the book does use plain language to explain a few basic financial concepts that many readers will be seeing for the first time. In fact, I am sure that the Best Seller status of this book is due to so many people reading a self-help book on money for the first (and likely the only) time. It is even possible that this book has caused many people to examine their spending habits a bit, so I won't begrudge that. But no one is going to become a real estate tycoon from reading this book because the author is incredibly vague about the specifics of wealth building and gives almost no information about other kinds of investments. He brags about being very lucky, but like all anecdotal stories of wealth building, it shows only one winner. There is no perspective on how many people end up losers doing the same things.    What really bothers me about this book is that the anti-intellectual tone will draw people in to the author's personality cult. Once enchanted, the reader will be tempted to go along with the idea that poor wage earners deserve their lot in life and can be unapologetically exploited by \\"smarter\\" people following the author's approach. What, I wonder, does Kiyosaki think would happen if everyone tried to get out of the \\"Rat Race\\" as a result of his vision? Don't the rich owe any kind of gratitude to the people who make their lifestyles possible?     I'm afraid this entire book comes off as a big rationalization for being (and wanting to be) rich, no matter who gets hurt. If you are willing to pay this man for his business advice (and products....sheesh!), then I'm afraid you are willingly becoming just another step on the ladder he is climbing. After all people wanting to get rich are okay to exploit, right?
B000MR9D5E|1.0|Specatacular views, but way too much footage of animals eating animals.  Every segment in the 5 disc collection keys into the fight for survival with preditors capturing and devouring their victims.      Whether slowly or quickly, this is bothersome.  I can not deny the reality and rules by which nature works, however, I was unprepared for the way BBC went there and stayed there time and time again.  Perhaps a better title for this series would be \\"Planet Preditor.\\"  I bought this in hopes of sharing with my children.  Now, I wish I hadn't purchased it.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|If I could give this coprolite of a film zero stars I would.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen and ever hope to see.  The fact that it could be rated so highly, here and on IMDB, indicates the abysmal emotional immaturity of film fans.      <spoiler alert>    1. No likable characters - which isn't to say the characters just sit there, no.  They scream off the screen with absolute annoyance.  I hated the characters 15 minutes into the film and wondered how they could possible be turned into something worth watching.  They weren't.  Androgynous boy-man has the voice of a whining buzz saw cutting through a series of jagged metal chalk boards.  Jennifer Connelly manages to disguise her attractiveness under a layer of creepout that was hard, physically hard, to keep eyeballs focused on.  And the Wayans brother is just annoying token-black-man, thrown in to give the Semitic/Anglo couple some \\"street cred\\".  Okay, not all characters in a movie need to be appealing.  But the kicker is, when you get to the end of the movie and you realize you are supposed to feel sorry for them...somehow.  Despite the fact that they never displayed an ounce of decency or humanity.  It's beyond comprehension how I could feel anything other than disgust for them all.  So maybe the mother character is sposta appeal?  As she descends into a diet pill frenzy that borders on the comic, and increasingly chews the scenery like a dog with an old bone, you can only hope the movie will end soon so you can begin the process of extracting her visage from your catalog of humanoid faces.    2. Displays all the writing and plotting skills of a privileged, protected college student trying to imagine what life on the edge is like.  It's truly laughable.  Truly cliched and trite and laughable.  Token-black ends up arrested by token-Southern-law-officer and sentenced to forced labor.  Semitic junky loses his arm - oh yes, in the South doctors will call the police before treating a case of gangrene - we're just that inhuman.  Creepy chick starts having sex for money and drugs, but we're sposta feel sorry for her cuz she doesn't enjoy it.  Mother goes into an irrecoverable spastic state from diet pills (DIET PILLS!) and has her brain fried with electroshock.  Yeah...that's a believable scenario.  Zathura is more believable.  Childish junk, this \\"plot\\".     3.  Purposeless student film devices.  The quick cutting, the meaningless split screens, the accelerated/decelerated time, the steady cams strapped to bodies - it all screams, \\"I am so creative, world look at my genius and despair.\\"  What's really lovable is the little montage that accompanies every heroin kick - gee, that never gets old.    4. Stereotypes - the lovable black heroin dealer, the horrible black sex fiend, the n-word using Southern law officers, the doting Jewish mother and her troop of aimless Jewish mother friends, the creepy bald successful guy.  Every character in this movie is a hack job pulled from the yellowed pages of some pulp novel found on a bus stop rack.      5. Laughable drug use - For junkies, these people have awfully fussy biological clocks.  They can go without for any length of time it takes to flesh out some worthless scene.  But then suddenly, they're willing to become sex slaves for a slight taste.  Whatever gets the director to the emotional non-moment he thinks will grab the ghoulies of pretentious film critics.  And then the mother on diet pills?  And she's so stupid she doesn't realize that taking several at a time is inadvisable?    6. Ridiculous plot devices - did I cover the hysterical creepy mental hospital where they go straight to the brain frying levels of ECT?  Why didn't the director just do the lobotomy routine from Cuckoo's Nest?  The drug shortage with a special Xmas delivery that means nobody in NYC can get heroin...yes, that's believable.  The man who can't take care of an infection on his arm until...it needs antibiotics?  No, that might be believable.  No, itmust be cut off.  Ridiculous!  And the Wayans character...he's operating with the Jewish guy, but he's also in the black mob and they are independent and have money but then don't and...was anybody allowed to review this?  Did nobody giving this drut 5 stars think this was a problem?  The mother with her TV addiction, who just happens to watch the same show ad nauseum?  Believable?  Or just meant to inflict despair?  I claim the latter.    Dear dawg, I could go on and on about how insanely bad this movie is, and how I hope the director gets put on the next one-way rocket trip to the Andromeda Galaxy...but what's really disturbing is the number of people who could swallow this razor blade and call it candy.

B000AJIF4E|4.0|Like most Sony speakers they are on the bright side. Most people know these for their forward sound. They are mid heavy which is useful for dialogue specific work such as production sound work for film.  They are rugged and will last for years. The velour ear pads are the weak point as everyone who has had these for any length of time will tell you. Mine are ragged and split open revealing the foam. I have had them for 8 years or so. I do not baby them at all and the coiled cable is perfect.<br /><br />They can be rough on the ears and if you have bigger ears they will crush them. It doesn't bother me so much because my ears are on the smaller side.<br /><br />I &#34;upgraded&#34; to the Beyerdynamic DT770 and while I love how comfortable they are compared to the Sony I do miss the form factor and coiled cable. The Beyerdynamics have a completely different sonic signature which is useful when comparing sources. The Sonys are easy to drive with just about any amp, be it an ipod or computer. If you buy a pair of MRD 7506s you come to know their sound. They are iconic for a reason. They are not the end of the line for audio fidelity but they have their place for a reason.<br /><br />They do benefit from using a nice headphone amp. I currently own a Samson 4 channel amp which is okay but it falls short when compared to the headphone amp in my Sound Devices 302 mixer.
0312427999|3.0|It's not at all novel to argue that the implementation of a wide-ranging system, capitalistic or otherwise, requires a terrible shock to the status quo, but Klein cheaply glows in this thesis merely because it's offered with a timely (and bloodlustful) partisan force. Yes, it's probably good to know a little about money-hungry CIA-backed coups throughout Latin America during the mid to late twentieth century, and yes, ideologues such as Milton Friedman are probably best left buried in our cultural rearview mirror, but don't let the failings of the current administration convince you that greater historical trends could have been any other way or that dramatic change will ever be comfortable.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|This biblical epic has Peter Ustinov giving the definitive performance of the emperor Nero, in spite of the motion picture code. But then, it seems they were always relaxing that motion picture code back in the 40's and 50's as long as it was for a biblical epic of some kind. In this case, you see - although from a distance - lions carrying the limbs of dismembered Christians upon which they are feeding, along with all of the other insinuations of decadence present under Nero. Robert Taylor, who was normally a rather wooden actor IMHO, did a very good job in this one as a Roman soldier entranced by a Christian girl. If you didn't know better you might think this film was the work of Cecil B. DeMille, but instead the director was Mervyn Le Roy. Le Roy directed some of Warners fast-paced urban early sound films including Alice White's musicals, Gold Diggers of Broadway, Cagney's \\"Hard to Handle\\", Edward G. Robinson's \\"Little Caesar\\", and \\"Three on a Match\\". He also directed one of Robert Taylor's other great performances in 1942's \\"Johnny Eager\\", unbelievably not yet on DVD. In other words, Le Roy directed many crowd-pleasers. This might explain why this film got seven or eight Oscar nominations, but none for the director himself. He just wasn't considered good enough by the Academy to be \\"in the club\\" in spite of this excellent individual achievement.<br /><br />Everyone knows the popular legend. Nero burns Rome to clear the way for the magnificent city he wants to build, but the peasants are revolting - literally. He then blames the odd and unpopular but quickly growing sect of the Christians for the burning, and begins feeding them to the lions for the amusement of the Romans. However, the Christians face death so bravely that Rome turns on Nero. Well, that's the movie.<br /><br />The facts are much more in argument. In an ancient city such as Rome, accidental fires that destroyed cities were common. In fact Nero did lead a massive relief effort after the fire, and fires just as large broke out in Rome after Nero's death. Some historians do have the Christians confessing to the crime. The fact is that the people did begin to circulate rumors that Nero was at fault, and he was responsible for blaming th Christians for the fire to save himself. He ordered to have them thrown to dogs, though, not lions, as in the film.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Bizarre and Brilliant! I love the way this movie plays with reality and imagination. The viewer is thrown into the world of a bi-polar, highly intelligent young man, Donnie Darko, who is sleepwalking his way toward disaster. There is a strange way to prevent all the tragedy and the 'way' is exposed after Donnie's near death experience awakens him to the possibility of portals and time travel. Will he go back through the portal to save lives, even though it may bring an end to his own life? I love tales that 'bend the brain', and this one sure works on the ole noodle.<br /><br />Chrissy K.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|What can you say about these guys. I'll admit it. The first listen threw me for a loop. I thought these guys had lost it. Now this is my favorite album. As far as good songwriters today, you cannot beat them. With all the crap that is popular today, and everybody trying to sound like everybody else to make a buck, BRMC shows their true colors here. Their live show is even better. I've seen them 3 times and the albums can't touch their live show. Listen to the 1st two records again and you can hear them evolving. There was no departure here, just refinement.
B0018O4YSQ|4.0|I noticed the 440+ reviews here are for the film - not the Blu so I at least wanted to answer some common questions about this cut.<br /><br />The director's cut is 111 minutes with the already mentioned changes listed here and everywhere - including the removal of the beginning narration, more character development scenes, etc. The transfer looks phenomenal (compared to how I saw it prior - even upscaled). I played the title on both a Panasonic plasma and a Bravia via a 80 GB PS3 and Sony BDP301. I paused the film in over 34 spots of action, dark contrasts, bright colorings and various hue changes. Virtually every frame looked excellent, especially the scenes with Jennifer Connelly singing; the majority of the colorings were in her scenes until those last beach sequences.<br /><br />The special features are the same between the DVD and Blu with the exception of one of the commentaries. The 7.1 DTS HD sound was enjoyable, even though two of the channels were primarily used in the large machine sequences only.<br /><br />A worthwhile Blu addition and I did not see too many failings in the grain reduction/transfer issues I had read about.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|What is director Paul Thomas Anderson saying with this film?  \\"There Will Be Blood\\" has been likened to \\"Citizen Kane\\" often enough that I initially wondered if the parodying of publishing magnate, Wm Randolph Hearst, in Kane had been revisited here in the form of TWBB's main character, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis), as an oil tycoon.  Already fierecely debated in this forum, I can only add that what I took away from this film are no more than (a) the battle to death of two men--a misanthrope obsessed with oil who clings to the maxim \\"trust no one,\\" and an equally ambitious and crafty bogus preacher, and (b) the corrosive effects and systemic rot of extreme ambition above all else, both in capitalistic and evangelical pursuits.<br /><br />(The story has been synopsized many times already so I'll just limit my post to my opinions of the film.)<br /><br /> (1)  Actors - Great performances by Daniel Day Lewis as lead and Paul Dano as Eli Sunday.  Lewis' portrayal of the megalomaniacal Plainview is outstanding--the avarice, the obsession, the greed all come across with ferociousness.  Dano is not to be upstaged as he portrays the histrionics of a bible-thumper, at times lucidly cunning and other times insanely possessed of the same evils he purports to banish.  The best scenes in this film are those with both as they humiliate each other at turns.<br /><br />(2)  Screenplay - Its story is mistakenly attributed to Upton Sinclair's \\"Oil!.\\"  TWBB was only inspired by it.  At first depicting the entrepreneurial spirit and guts of the early 1900s, it then focuses its lenses on the price that is inevitably paid along the way to a  success that's measured in money and power.  Plainview wants to build an oil empire; Sunday wants to build an evangelical empire.  Someone has to pay for all this empire-building.  Both destroy each other and themselves in the end.<br /><br />Of particular note is the screenwriter's (Anderson) ability to tell an incredible story within a believable context.  Plainview and Sunday are both bigger than life (they're meant to be), but at no time did I find it a stretch to believe that such characters would behave in the manner that they do.<br /><br />Much has been made of the ending when Plainview uses the analogy of a milkshake in taunting his foe, Sunday, with the fact that he already owns the underground riches (oil drainage, he says) of a tract Sunday is proposing to broker on Plainview's behalf, with monetary compensation of course: \\"I drink your milkshake.  I drink your water.  Everyday I drink the blood of the Lamb...\\"  Many thought it ridiculous and it has actually turned into a joke associated with the film.  Fact is, Anderson got the idea from a 1924 congressional hearing transcript (from the Teapot Dome Scandal, the contextual basis of Upton Sinclair's novel) where a senator describes oil drainage as:  \\"Sir, if you have a milkshake and I have a milkshake and my straw reaches across the room, I'll end up drinking your milkshake.\\"  It's meant simply to illustrate that Plainview's finger is in every oil pot and he knows it, and Sunday's religious fervor has, and always has been, useless in impeding Plainview.<br /><br />(3)  Editing - Regarded as an epic by some (drivel by others), the film is over 2 hours in length.  Its length does not bother me.  Insatiable ambition, greed, oil, faith, industry, murder, revenge, fraud--many themes incorporated into one big picture so, if it takes 2 ½ hours to effectively depict them, then that's what it takes.  In reviewing the scenes while fresh in my mind, I cannot think of any one scene that should have been cut.  Every single one, I believe, contributed to the understanding of the story and its main characters.<br /><br />(4)  Cinematography - The spectacle of oil rigs, derricks, gas explosions and such were unexpected.  (I mean, really, how exciting can an oil rig be?).  Shots of gushers, rigs aflame, mud, dirt, etc. were so artistically done that one can almost feel the slickness of the oil and the acrid smell as it burns, and heighten the dangers that surround such enterprises.  Wide panoramic shots of the rugged, dry land of Southern California were dazzling, its landscape broken by silhouettes of derricks and oil rigs, and once in a great while, swaths of brilliant blue water amidst the greys and black.  If there is an inconographic representation of California's oil boom, I'd have to say it would be this sort of shot.  Close-ups of the actors, filthy most times, unkempt, faces and limbs bronzed by outdoor labor, added to the realism.  Dirty fingernails, sweat pouring from their bodies, drenched in the oil that would make them rich, dust and mud beneath their feet--all were astoundingly photographed, down to the grease that rings their collars.  Technically, it's inarguably a superior film.<br /><br />It's a rough, rugged, hardscabble world here with characters that cannot or will not exorcise the malignancy that has taken root in themseleves.

B00000J7S8|5.0|CARLOS SANTANA is an excellent musician . THIS was the far better album of the year it lost to \\"SUPERSTITION\\" . the understated and incredibly tasteful guitarist RUSSELL MALONE . the miraculous arrangements of JOHNNY MANDEL . the sexiness and pitch perfect restraint of MS. KRALL'S vocal and piano contributions . LEWIS NASH or JEFF HAMILTON on drums . the song selection and programing of the material . the lifetime achievement award was SANTANA'S . the music is ours . the snapshot forever . the depth of this deep , sultry well will grow in stature . sans radio play . by word of mouth . just off the beaten path more traveled .
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Yes, this album is a shift toward a different sound, style, etc for Coldplay and yes, they do a great job at progressing forward. They still have that Coldplay quality of making the music and vocals seem suspended in air and time but they are trying out more morbid sounds, feelings, lyrics and different styles.     That said, as a whole, this album is a complete and flowing thought that finishes where it starts off literally.  Im sure that has to do with the whole cycle of life and death but you can make your own meanings out of the music. I hate to call it a concept album but its close to one because of its cohesiveness.    I am glad they are trying something different and that they pulled it off. XY was a good album but you could tell that the band was ready to move on past their familiar sound and style. This album is a must have...and its best heard if played from track start to end the first few times you listen. There are strong tracks but no one track is greater than the whole album, thus making this their best album.
1594489505|5.0|I read this book before I read his first book, The Kite Runner. This actually helped remove any expectation and made the Kite Runner seem more optimistic. I would recommend reading them out of order to anyone who hasn't read any of his books yet. This book presents a hard reality but offers a lot of insight, inspiration and education within its pages. I really enjoyed it and was sad to be done.
B000002J2D|5.0|This album is as Phill Collins puts it \\" the worst album they did \\" however i have to say this probably remains my favourite post gabriel genesis cd, ok alot of reviews pay too much attention to little quirks but this cd has some really beautiful songs superbly sung by phil although to be fair most couldnt be sung live due to the fact it relies heavily on multi tracking. That said, Burning Rope, Undertow and Snowbound are definate highlights, beg borrow or steal a copy you wont be disappointed!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO's production of \\"John Adams\\" is an epic telling of a complex and brilliant man--a much overshodowed founding father.  Paul Giamatti and Laua Linney are simply brilliant in their respective roles---as are Stephen Dillane (Thomas Jefferson), Tom Wilkinson (Ben Franklin) and David Morse (George Washington).  Authenticity permeates the entire production and you feel utterly transported--both in place and time.  The ugliness and hardship of colonial living is quite evident in the production---and the glossy romanticized vision of this era is effectively stripped away.  Additionaly, I found that the poignancy of Giamatti's and Linney's performances in conjunction with the brilliant film score nearly brought me to tears.    I find it so ironic that the father-son presidencies of the Bushes have been compared and contrasted with those of the Adams'----to even contemplate the presidency of our current FIRST IMBECILE in conjunction with the Adams' is almost too absurd to bear.

B0000640SA|5.0|I first saw this movie at the theater when it caem out back in 2001 and I was astounded by it's creativity, and I couldn't wait till it came available on video so that I could watch it as many times as I wanted, and believe me I've seen it a lot. But there were still some things that I just seemed to be missing, but now that I've got the DVD showing the movie in it's chronological order, it  now makes so much more sense to me. Ever since getting the new release I've researched the movie deeply and the amount of things that I've found that goes way past the end is staggering but interesting. If any one is interested in e-mailing me to further discuss this astounding movie, please feel free.
B000H6SXMY|2.0|The DVD's were not original....All original DVD's come in dual layer format(DVD9, 7-8 GB). These were single layer DVD's(around 4.35 GB)....Moreover, all DVD's had a melted glass like substance near the center, which I think was some sort of manufacturing defect. I suspected that these are not original, so returned the package.    The seller however was co-operative and made an immediate refund. Hence the 2nd star.    If you buy, do confirm that the DVD's are dual layer.    -Nikhil
B00005JPY0|5.0|We saw this last night and it was so awesome!  Better than all the batman movies before it.  The story line keeps you interested even though it's a two-and-a-half hour movie.  Special effects were amazing.  The actors were great, but Heath Ledger really shined the best.  He was incredible as The Joker and had he lived, he would have been one of the best actors of our time.  Go see this movie!
B000002MG1|5.0|The fact that U2's Bono called this 'the greatest country record never made' says enough.   This album is incredible.      Every song on the album is a stand-out.  The hits such as \\"Drive\\", \\"Everybody Hurts\\", and \\"Man on the Moon\\" speak for themselves.    The brilliant \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\", may seem a bit out of place.  Peter Buck says the following in the sleevenotes to The Best of REM: \\"We included this song on Automatic in order to break the prevailing mood of the album. Given that lyrically the record dealt with mortality, the passage of time, suicide and family, we felt that a light spot was needed. In retrospect, the consensus among the band is that this might be a little too lightweight.\\"    Although not a major hit, \\"Find the River\\" is incredibly moving and amongst their best (my personal \\"#1 REM track\\").  The extra piano crescendo at 3:24 is still my favorite REM moment.
B000AD1QGE|5.0|If you are interested in battleships, you need to get this video. It shows battleships in service, not just here in the U.S., but battleships from around the world. Some of the famous battleships include the North Carolina, battleships of the Iowa Class, german battleships, japanese, and others. I got interested in battleships a few years ago, and am always on the lookout for battleship videos/dvd's. This is always one of my favorites. Very informative, and filming is excellent. I give this one 5 stars. I very highly recommend it!
B001AW9DKK|2.0|The majority of the material on this is from Neils \\"Living With War\\" which although I agree with the ideology of the cd, it never made the cut the rawness was not there, the anger was not there, it was not like Neils \\"Rockin in The Free World\\" with all of the angst. This cd does not reflect CSNY it reflects Neils even if all of the band members agreed 100% with Neil, there are far to few CSNY songs. Or how about some of Stills,Nash or Crosbys solo songs . Sorry have to pass on this one of my all time favorite bands.
0446402389|5.0|Based loosely on the true story of Andrei Chikatili, Tim Rob Smith takes us through the iron curtain into post WW2 Stalinist Russia. Begining with an introduction to Leo and Andrei as children, the stage is set for a countrywide hunt for a merciless childkiller.<br /><br />Along the way, Leo, an MGB agent and nationalist icon, and his wife Raisa are tested to their very cores in matters of committment to each other and the State. Around each corner is a breath-stealing twist. Each chapter ends with a suspenseful revelation and doesn't fail to amaze when it picks up.<br /><br />There is sort of a love story swirling around in the background, however it is more of litmus test for true love. Boy doesn't chase girl, boy chases motive. Lives hang in the balance of motives in Child 44, and some lives don't hang on very long. The body count is high and methods of execution are thrilling.<br /><br />Child 44 is the story of suspicion. No one can be trusted; parents, children, siblings, employers, The State, even spouses. As the story unfolds, each character's credibility wanes as each one's genuine motive goes before the jury.<br /><br />Unpredictable, suspenseful and masterfully penned, Child 44 is a stunning debut from a gifted author.
B00004STPT|1.0|This is not a memorable score - But it does invoke this suberb films memories ( Rozsa - Diomkin - North - NOT! ~ What happened to melody?).  This DECCA CD is the bottom of the barrel - NO INFORMATION WHATSOEVER! No timings - No bios. -  Zimmer (we know) - But who is Lisa Gerrard? Does she not diserve a bio? - A CD DISGRACE!  If you liked the film, get it, it is not something that you will listen to often, but it does envoke the film. - This idiotic release is strictly to cash in on its popularity - DITO for \\"MORE MUSIC FROM GLADIATOR\\". Yahoos like this company are destroying the market for serious film score enthusiasts by such a shoddy release.
B000Y179KO|4.0|Its funny I was surfing thru the internet and discovered wow a new Eagles CD of completey unreleased brand new material.  I went to Amazon and saw the usual mixed bag of reviews and said to myself, let me borrow a copy from my library or somewhere to check it out for mysef.  To my surpise, this is a very consistent strong recording with a great mix of old, new, ballads, rockers, and many creative touches.  Heck the 10 minute plus title track really caught my ear from the spooky opening to the intriguing lyrics and the varied insturmental support especially Joe Walsh's solos.  Guilty of the Crime is another noteworthy tune which boogies nicely.<br /><br />There are a few slow songs which lose my attention but most of the material is comparible to their early days without duplicating those days.  Everyone can always grow a little and the Eagles certainly succede in that arena.  A solid 4-4 1/2 stars CD.
0920668372|1.0|This story is pretty much akin to what I imagine a convicted pedophile would come up with if they actually let one publish a children's book.<br /><br />Believe it or not, I GET IT ... the book is *meant* to be a sweet parable of the bond between parent and child.  Great.  The problem is, it fails.  Miserably.  The supposed \\"intention\\" of the book (and believe me, I have my doubts as to the REAL intention behind this story) does little to sweeten the seriously unsettling undertone here.  It reads way too much like a sugar-coated story of incest, and the absolute *nicest* thing I could say about the mother in the book is that she is dangerously unbalanced.<br /><br />I would never dream of reading this to my child, especially not as some kind of an example of \\"wonderful motherly love\\".  (More like \\"dangerous pathological obsession\\".)  I would never want any child -- no matter WHAT gender they were -- to think that the stalking behavior exhibited in this story is indicative of love.  The relationship between the mother and son here (and later, the son and his daughter) is a dangerously disturbed one, and there is simply no way around it.<br /><br />I was beyond disturbed and creeped out when I read this book and would have thrown it away immediately if not for the fact that it was a gift from my Mom when I was pregnant with my daughter.<br /><br />For the reviewer who commented that finding this book frightening means that it obviously \\"wasn't written for you\\" ... GOOD.  I'm glad that's true, because I would be scared to death to think that either of my parents felt that way about me.  (I do have to wonder about the author's relationship with HIS mother, though ...)

B000053VAZ|3.0|Benny (Aidan Quinn) & Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson) are brother and sister. Benny has been taking care of his mentally ill sister for quite some time, since they were orphaned. He keeps his own personal life on hold, since taking care of Joon complicates things so much. Benny has a hard time keeping housekeepers because of Joon's erratic behavior. Joon inevitably takes a disliking to them and drives them away. What was wrong with the latest?<br /><br />Joon: She was given to fits of semi-precious metaphors.<br />Benny: The woman is a housekeeper, Joon, not an English professor.<br /><br />Benny does have a group of buddies that get together and play poker. They make unusual bets, like for salad shooters, or soap on a rope--slightly used. Benny loses, and has to take in Sam (Johnny Depp), who has been staying with his cousin.<br /><br />Sam is very strange, illiterate, and obsessed with films. He is especially obsessed with silent films, like those of Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. He dresses like Buster Keaton, and performs perfect imitations of silent film comedy routines. He also memorizes lines from more recent films, like a slasher film about prom night, Prom Night Mutilator. He recognizes Ruthie (Julianne Moore), the waitress, as an actress from the film. She had gone to Hollywood, but now has given up on her career. A romance blooms between her and Benny, but Benny feels like he can't get involved because of Joon's mental illness. He doesn't notice another romance blooming right under his nose, between Sam and Joon.<br /><br />Benny & Joon is a cute little movie, but it doesn't really work. Johnny Depp does a surprisingly good job with the silent comedy routines, but that's not enough to carry the film. Perhaps if he was cast in a Buster Keaton biopic, like Robert Downey Jr. playing Charlie Chaplin, it might have worked. Or if the preposterous plot and strange character was juxtaposed with a dull suburban milieu, with tract homes that all look the same except for different shades of pastel, as in Edward Scissorhands, it would have worked. But Jeremiah S. Chechik is no Tim Burton, and his vision wasn't compelling enough for me to want to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />There were also some missed opportunities. William H. Macy played an agent who was going to audition Sam to put him on some kind of performing circuit. He never auditions, and nothing is made of this. Also, Macy could have provided a rival for Benny, then there could have been a little love triangle, generating a little more tension in their romance. I know that William H. Macy is hardly a threat, but that would have been all the more bitter for Benny if he lost out to him. The one small scene with Macy does have Ruthie making an unlikely appearance, and there is actually a little spark between them. I think that was supposed to be the idea, but it was dropped like a hot potato.<br /><br />I really like Julianne Moore, but she was never utilized to the fullest. She did the best she could with the material at hand. Given the right film she is a red-headed stick of dynamite.<br /><br />Depp is a very versatile actor, and he is always interesting, but that can't save the film. He did his own stunts, or comedy routines, like the dancing bread rolls gag from Charles Chaplin's The Gold Rush, or the hat trick from Harold Lloyd's Hey There! You might want to watch this film just to see him, but he is so much better in other vehicles, or at least the other vehicles are so much better...<br /><br />Mary Stuart Masterson does an adequate job of portraying mental illness, and also shows the creative and quirky side of her personality. She paints, and her own paintings were used in the film. She has all of the good lines:<br /><br />Joon: Some cultures are defined by their relationship to cheese.<br /><br />Joon: Having a Boo Radley moment, are we?<br /><br />Mary Stuart Masterson asked that the song \\"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles)\\" (by the Proclaimers) be usedin this film. There is a video of it tacked onto the end. I like those crazy Scottish twins, and their earnest hit single.

1604248572|3.0|I've read Hermann Hesse's Siddhartha every year in the month of my birth since 1978. Most of those years I read the 1951 New Directions edition. In recent years there have been a dozen other translations of this work, some good and some not as good. This particular translation doesn't tell us who the publisher is, who translated it, or anything else about the publications - take a hint. The problem with this translation is not necessary the translation, it read smoothly enough, however, there are somewhere around a dozen errors in tense, typos, wrong word (through vs. thorough) etc. throughout the text that are more than obvious. I would suggest that if this publisher does a second edition they might want to consider proofreading the text.<br /><br />I do recommend Hesse's Siddhartha HIGHLY. I would, however, suggest picking another publisher.

I also felt that some scenes were excruciatingly long and slow! I almost wanted to fast forward, which is never a good sign. This has got to be one of Cronenberg's worst films! Some viewers may like it more than I did, I will never sit through this a second time.

B000UAE7RW|5.0|This is a film you absolutely need to see at least twice. The first time through you'll be gasping for air, trying to keep up with the twists and turns in the plot. The second time through, you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. Those willing to view it again and again will find more and more to love in this amazingly dense but satisfying film. Jack Nicholson is perfect in the lead role, and the rest of the cast is equally at home in roles that flesh out this well woven tale. The look and feel of this film is fantastic.

B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Anyone with knowledge of Anne and Mary Boleyn and their relationships with Henry VIII will see that this is tabloid fiction, pure and simple. The timetables and events are total fabrications. Yes, Anne was alleged to have had relationships with her brother. But to see this depicted as fact in this movie? Well, just look at the costumes. I've seen better costumes on sale at the Halloween store. No one making this movie was interested in the facts.    Anne, Mary, Henry, Katherine, how could they not be rolling in their graves? The accounts are there. I'm sorry that some people will actually believe that this is the way that it was. Books. Go read some books. Books are good.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|The extreme accuracy of detail in depicting those years is impressive. Most interesting, however, is about content.  Discussing this Series with my wife, I absentmindedly said, about the character of Don Draper, played by Jon Hamm, \\"He's a good man.\\"  She said, \\"No he isn't!\\"  I then realized, and told my wife, \\"That's how he gets away with it!\\"  What does he get away with?  Well, everything.  He is such a good point man for the company the owner/boss does not care when the weasel tells the boss about his identity theft. A side issue there is, of course, the weasel, Pete, who has committed a Federal crime by opening mail that is not his, is so smart he is stupid.  Why? It's the same reason Draper willingly takes him into the boss's office to reveal the ID theft, realizing that Pete is not realizing that the real big killer info is that Draper is a Jew. Don might as well quickly take Pete up on his threat to go to the boss, rather than submit to blackmail, as soon as possible before Pete gets around to thinking about the real career killer, right? That is not in the show yet, but I bet it will be, eventually. (Wonder why Don got along so well with Rachel?) If Pete had deduced that, then Draper would never take him to the boss.  Telling the boss about an upsetting issue the boss would not care about is a whole lot different than the worst thing anyone, anywhere, even his wife could find out. Notice how Don did not hesitate taking Pete to the boss?  You wait.  At least that is what I would be writing into the scripts. With the archaic attitudes of that company's brass, about Jews, that info would have gotten Draper fired and blacklisted, which, of course, from our point of view now days is about as stupid as smoking all the time.  Thank heavens things have evolved!<br />Don's wife is played so well.  Don is so good at everything she is happy to be the zero she is. Constantly made aware of how lucky she is, she sits in agonizing unhappiness, the reason for which she cannot explain nor express even to herself. She is so unhappy.  They all are.  This show is so well done that it ranks right up there with the best of Shakespearian Tragedies. At every turn we are shown their pathetic, truly unhappy existence, all of them, all the time, no matter what any of them are endeavoring to accomplish, no matter what roles they play. It's genius!  It's one of the saddest stories ever produced in the entertainment world.explain nor express even to herself. She is so unhappy.  They all are.

B0012Q732O|3.0|It was a silly plot, following in the footsteps of other recent films and blended together, and I have a feeling mammoths didn't really react that way after seeing how elephants handle certain situations. I also believe they could have done more-if not better with it. So, it was easier to imagine it as a type of \\"alternate universe\\" movie and enjoy it in that aspect. However,the CGI creatures were cool and that was one of the reasons I bought the DVD.I just wish that they had seen better use.

1592402690|5.0|This is a great book and the best of a half-dozen or so books that I have read on The Beatles.  First, it answers convincingly some of the most basic questions about the group such as why they broke up, how they made music together, the personalities of each, etc.  Second, it is very frank in its assessments, both with praise and criticism--George Harrison receiving a fair amount of each.  Third it is very revealing about particular songs, specifically how they were made (in terms of effects desired and attained)and their evolution in the recording studio.  Finally, this book is well-written, not overly technical, relatively short at 300+ pages and a joy to read.
B000BNX3B4|2.0|Incredibly slow moving; I almost turned it off mid way. What I did like about it was the interaction Sarah had with her sisters and her father.  Other than that, it is low on plot and they could have finished the movie in about 45 minutes.  Great actors, poor movie.

B0000VAFO0|4.0|UNDERWORLD, a faced-paced, in your face, kick-a** monster movie, tries to answer that age old question.  Vampires and Lycans (werewolves) have been at war for untold centuries.  Very few even remember how the blood feud started.  But the crossing of a Vamp with a Lycan has always been forbidden.  Or has it?<br /><br />UNDERWORLD is action-packed from the get go; you jump right in and it never lets up.  Epic battles, high-speed chases, gun fights, impossible stunts, blood and gore (although less than you would think), and fantastic transformations keep you on the edge of your seat.  The directing/cinematography/editing are excellent, cutting away from anything truly disgusting before you really see it; leaving the rest to your vivid imagination.  The acting is impressive, with Kate Beckinsale, Scott Speedman, and Michael Sheen all giving scene-stealing performances.  The rest of the cast, including Bill Nighy, are equally good in there respective roles.  And let me just say, the costuming for UNDERWORLD is marvelous:  gorgeous dresses, fabulous leathers, skin-tight cat suits.  I'd like to go shopping were the Vamps do!<br /><br />UNDERWORLD includes all the universal Vampire and Werewolf lore - sunlight kills Vamps, silver kills Lycans, you become a Vampire or a Werewolf from a bite.  Not too many surprises in this area (although these precepts are taken to new heights), making it easier to keep up with the plot.  But added to the standard lore is the theory that there is a line of humans who carry a gene that enables them to survive a bite from BOTH a Vampire and a Lycanthrope.  And this is what the Lycans are looking for.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a fan of monster flicks, you will enjoy UNDERWORLD.  It makes for a great popcorn evening at home.  It is clearly too intense for the youngest members of the family, but tweens and up should be just fine.<br /><br />So, what DO you get, when you cross a Vampire with a Lycanthrope?  Apparently, something the Lycans want and the Vampires don't.  And something bigger and badder than both...something bigger and badder than both...
0743486285|4.0|I was not a fan of Motley Crue and knew very little about Nikki Sixx, so boy was I surprised by the life style these rock stars led.  The diary is a little repetitive since most of the book is Nikki obsessing about drugs, however, there are interesting tidbits thrown in here and there. I was a huge Prince fan so it was very interesting to read about Vanity and what a junkie she turned out to be.  It's also very cool how others (Tommy, Vince, Vanity & More) were allowed to contribute their impressions/memories etc. to the book.
0330449605|5.0|A four-year-old girl waits alone on a dock in Australia for parents who never come. Her only possession? A tiny white suitcase containing no information about who she is or how she came to be abandoned.<br /><br />Nell is a foundling, and what a rare foundling she is. A stow-away on an ocean liner, she refuses to tell even so much as her name.  Until in her 60s, over-protected by a loving foster father, she has no clue how she came to be alone on that dock. Hers is the mystery that unfolds in this long novel spanning more than a century, five generations, and two distant continents.<br /><br />Enthusiastic fans of Kate Morton's first novel, \\"The House at Riverton,\\" will thrill to her second, \\"The Forgotten Garden.\\"  Like her first, this is a novel whose female characters are finely and fully drawn, and whose males are wispy and insubstantial. How its women interact, how they love and hate one another, how their interplay moves through tragedy and redemption will provide hours of pleasure for her fans.<br /><br />Morton's excellent pacing creates a page-turner that is hard to put down, although its length might give pause to those who suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. Morton tells her story not only through the actions of her characters but also through fairy tales that work on several levels and provide clues to the mystery's final solution. Many readers will have guessed the solution long before the end of the book. Nevertheless, Morton maintains reader interest throughout.<br /><br />Overall, this is a highly satisfying read. It's fun to watch the author weave the lives of women into a rich tapestry of life and love, anger and betrayal. However, the novel is not without its weaknesses. First, as mentioned above, Morton's male characters are weak and insipid and never come to life. Second, the love interest at the end of the book does not mesh with the rest of the work. It is almost as though an editor said, \\"You'd better add a little love story here,\\" so Morton did.<br /><br />The book's flaws, while mildly unsettling, are not serious enough to spoil a great read. If you enjoy long stories about generations of women, you will love \\"The Forgotten Garden.\\"le mildly unsettling, are not serious enough to spoil a great read.

0679746323|5.0|This is my third biography off Mao this summer, following Lucian Pye's Mao: The Man in the Leader, and Li Zhisui's portrait of Mao based on his time as the Great Helmsman's personal physician.  And I'vee recently read Walter Laquer's Staklain: The Glasnost Revelations, and Dmitri Volkogonov's biography of Lenin using formerly secret Soviet archival materials.  This book is in their tradition of making available invaluable new findings that give new insights into their subject.    This book, based on interviews and research into state archives in China, Russia, and elsewhere, is very similar to the latter two.  Previously unavailable material is presented which places a new light on the subject.  Isn't this the kind of thing we look for in history?  The style may not be for everyone, but no one reads history for style, so such criticisms entirely miss the mark, and border on ad hominem arguments.    The funny thing is, some people feel compelled to advocate for Mao.  Who can imagine why?  Does Stalin still have his apologists, as he did in America in the 30s and later?  Does Kim Il Sung still have votaries?  Claiming that Mao unified China (and why is this good for the rest of the world?) as though this somehow justified the world's greatest starvation (the laughable Great Leap Forward) is fallacious.  So what romantic dreams continues to impel Mao's defenders?      This book gives great insight into Mao's background, his beginnings, his early manipulations of others, and his consistent (and quite imaginative!) scheming to get control of the party.  His ingenuity at destroying and controlling others is remarkable!  His provocations of Chiang kai-shek, trying to provoke civil war to compel Soviet assistance are quite creative as well.  Most interesting to me has been the deconstruction of the culture of Yenan, where Mao et al invented Chinese totalitarianism.    Tragically, he turned against everyone who was close to him, and inevitably, this led to his disgusting episodes of self-pity later in life.      Those who fault this book should go the historian's route, and look at the same evidence and draw their own conclusions from it. Mao's been dead for 30+ years.  Get over it, and get informed.   It would be good to see more biographies of Mao.  After all, there is a cottage industry on Hitler biographies, and Mao Tse-tung is a subject to (at a minimum) rival him in complexity and influence.
0385340567|2.0|I was very disappointed in Nothing to Lose after thoroughly enjoying all of Lee Child's previous books.   He is one of those authors that I run out to buy as soon as the hardcover comesout.   Next time I will wait for the reviews first.  If this was the first book I had read of his, I wouldn't read another but I am hoping this is just a fluke and the old Lee Child returns with his next book.

B00005JPY0|4.0|I saw The Dark Knight last Thursday. Whilst I personally prefer Batman Begins (as I found Bruce's back story to be excellent, though I did prefer the original title of Batman: Intimidation Game as I think `Batman Begins' is a bit poor and I'm a lifelong Bat-fan!), this is a worthy sequel and I was pleased to see Gordon get more screen time. The only thing that would have made it better for me, and I'm sure I'll be in the minority here, is that Katie Holmes wasn't in it. I'm not particularly a fan of Ms Holmes work (I did think she was unfairly slated in the first one though), however for continuity reasons I think that the Rachel/Bruce relationship and the arc for that character in this film was not as effective for me as a viewer because of perhaps consciously recognising this to be a different actress. This is not to say that Katie is better than Maggie; just that for continuity's sake it would have been better to have the character played by the SAME actress - had Maggie been in Batman Begins this wouldn't have been a problem. Given Bruce's emotional ties to Rachel established in `Begins', the chemistry just didn't seem there for me due to the jump in actress style.    Still, in context this was a minor concern. Ledger was very entertaining though I would have to give best actor award to joint recipients Gary Oldman and Aaron Eckhart. Did anyone else spot the Daredevil sonar technique being `borrowed'?! I still think that the fact that film was slated was down to people not liking Affleck moreso than the film itself, but then that'd be comments for another review...
B001437DMA|3.0|I was dissapointed with this disc.  After the great \\"Supper Collossal\\", I was really hoping for more great songs from the master.  This one had some great song ideas (Diddle-Y-A-Doo-Dat, Asik Veysel), but I thought that he never really develops the ideas beyond the basics.  It's like he went into the studio and just jammed, and didn't think too hard about the song structures.  While Satch is a great, great guitarist, his appeal to me has always been the songwriting.  This disc is definately weak in that area.
B00005YJMX|4.0|Viewers who pick up this film expecting a good old Hollywood vampire horror flick will be utterly disappointed, because Herzog's \\"Nosferatu\\" just isn't intended as a scary movie.  Herzog uses the Dracula legend, as did the expressionist film maker Murnau, as a vehicle for a film with a non-horror genred message.<br /><br />In the commentary accompanying the disk, Herzog says that he wants to establish continuity with the greatest period of German cinema, the expressionist era.  The themes that preoccupied the early expressionists (in addition to innovative cinematic technique) are the cultural ones explored here by Herzog:  the limits of human knowledge, the dark, wild side of humans, the arrogance of the Enlightenment, the loneliness of life, chaos, the certainty of death.  As poor Nosferatu says at one point in the film, \\"The absence of love is the most abject pain.\\"  Exploring claims like this, not scaring an audience with gore, is what Herzog is up to.<br /><br />The plague (la peste) plays a larger role in Herzog's version than in Murnau's.  Like Camus, perhaps Herzog wants to suggest the ubiquity of death and decay, and the different ways in which people respond to mortality.  Some, like Lucy (played by Isabelle Adjani, who wonderfully vamps and at times overacts to match the cinematic style of Greta Schroder in Murnau's 1922 \\"Nosferatu\\"), defy it with loving self-sacrifice.  Others, like van Helsing (played by Walter Landengast, who also features in Herzog's \\"Caspar Hauser\\"), deny it out of scientific hubris; others, like the anonymous people in the doomed town square who in Brueghel-like style make antic revel in the face of death, throw themselves into diversions.  But in the end, everyone shares the same fate, as Herzog suggests in that wonderful and terrifying scene in which columns of coffins, held aloft by an army of black-clothed undertakers, converge on the empty town square.  This scene, by the way, is as perfect a one as Herzog has ever choreographed.<br /><br />Herzog's film is loaded with irony, which is probably his way of saying that there are no happy endings to life.  Lucy sacrifices herself to slay Nosferatu (played by Kinski, who--thankfully--doesn't get a lot of screentime in the film), but the threat of death continues, because Jonathan (played by Bruno Ganz), emerges at film's end as one of the undead.  Van Helsing's arrogant refusal to admit that any corner of reality isn't absolutely open to scientific explanation is finally defeated by Lucy's example.  Liberating himself from his small scientific worldview, he quite heroically drives a stake through Nosferatu's heart--only to be arrested as a murderer.  The one guarantee in life is that there are no guarantees, and that life is painful.  In fact, as Herzog explains in the accompanying documentary, all his films are born from pain.<br /><br />One of Herzog's finest experiments in film.  My only regret is that apparently a great deal of the antic revels in the town square wound up on the cutting room floor (some of the deleted scenes are shown in the documentary).  They would've made Brueghel proud.film is loaded with irony, which is probably his way of saying that there are no happy endings to life.

0805209999|4.0|One morning Joseph K. is arrested. It is never made clear what the charges are, but K. always maintains his innocence, as he grapples with a bureaucracy that slowly strangles his career and consumes his life.<br />Franz Kafka's 'The Trial' was published posthumously shortly after his death. It was never completely finished and it was unclear how the chapters were to be ordered. It is no surprise then that the plot is somewhat episodic. I had expected the story to be a dystopian nightmare, instead it was blackly humourous as K. deals with the judicial bureaucracy and various absurd situations.<br />There are many themes and interpretations, but the most obvious (and to me the most relevant) is the power of government and bureaucracy to destroy lives, not through active malice but as an impersonal force like a car driving over a squirrel . Once K. has been arrested he can never be acquitted, he can only hope to delay  the final guilty verdict.<br />'The Trial' is a monumentally important work, that is more relevant than ever as government and its attendant bureaucracies have more impact on our lives with every passing year.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Cinematic interpretations of large historical books are, by necessity, forced to recreate only portions of the story. Having read the book I was naturally skeptical that the mini-series would be fluff. My concerns were unfounded.    John Adams tells the essence of the story with excellent story line selection, superb writing, and even better acting. I was thoroughly entertained and found it faithful to the book. Highly recommended.

B0010358CG|2.0|I was a little disappointed in the second appleseed movie.  The action was there, it just all felt re-hashed.  The finale was a total matrix rip off.  The action scenes were OK, it just wasn't as cutting edge as the first.  I was also surprised to see the Blue-ray only had a dolby digital sound track.  No new generation codec.  If you like anime, you'll probably enjoy it, if you don't, I wouldn't suggest this as your first view.  I would have been happy to have rented this one, not purchased.
B00158K0S8|5.0|Sure it may be a long movie, but it is one movie that will remain a favorite forever.  The intricate details of Patton's (portrayed by George C Scott) career are incredible to learn about, since Patton was one of our most heroic (and interesting) generals from World War II.  Furthermore, with the movie in Blu-Ray high definition, you couldn't ask for a more realistic viewing experience.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I am such a fan of ABBA, was at the Leicester Square premiere of the Mamma Mia! movie (where I got to see Benny & Bj&ouml;rn, as well as the stars of the movie), and only last weekend went to see the musical at the theater (thank you Meka!). It far exceeded my expectations, and everyone was singing along to the songs, especially at the finale.<br /><br />That is what this CD will have you doing, singing along in your best ABBA impersonation. First thing I noticed (I haven't seen the movie yet) was the omission of songs like \\"Knowing me, knowing you\\", \\"One of us\\", \\"Waterloo\\", \\"Chiquitita\\", \\"Under attack\\" (from the dream sequence), and \\"I do I do I do\\" (from the wedding scene).<br /><br />Every other song apears to be here, and I must say the movie actors do a very good job, Meryl Streep especially. Most of the songs stay faithful to the original arrangements (Benny & Bj&ouml;rn were on board to ensure that) but a few songs have some slight twists, like the very theatrical ending to \\"Dancing queen\\", the ballad treatment of \\"The winner takes it all\\" (fantastic performance by Meryl Streep during a showstopping scene with the beats kicking in at the last chorus), the delicate piano version of \\"Thank you for the music\\" (Amanda Seyfried in a winning performance), and the slight reworking lyrics of songs like \\"Our last summer\\" and \\"Lay all your love on me\\" to fit in with the story (as well as gender roles).<br /><br />Standout to me has got to be Pierce Brosnan's Sinatra-style crooning to a superb acoustic version of \\"When all is said and done\\". Amazingly, despite the songs having being written between 1974 and 1983, they fit into the story so well, you'd swear they were written with the play/movie in mind.<br /><br />Of course there's nothing quite like the originals, hence the 4 stars, but still this is a great album and I'm glad I got it. It brings back such wonderful memories of ABBA, as well as of the musical.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|The movie Black Hawk Down, which follows the Army Rangers and Delta Forces the Clinton Administration left in Mogadishu, Somalia, in the 1990s.  Based on true events, the movie retells the horrific events that led to the US military's most embarrassing and violent battle of that decade.  The film is incredible in every aspect, including the cast, the production, the realistic environments and the enthralling battles.  Everything looks spectacular in Blu-Ray high definition, especially the battles.  This movie is not only an incredible one to watch, but also is of important significance to the American people and ought to be watched.
0792839730|4.0|I watched this movie after watching Gallipoli last night.  Both pictures involve the stupidity of politics in fighting a war and not necessarily good military strategy and planning (think Iraq).  What seems to be missing here and was stated at the beginning of the field was the distrust between Patton and Montgomery.  Ike gave in to this operation not because he wanted it (he didn't) but because he was pressured from the higher echelon to placate Montgomery.  This was all Montgomery's botched idea (although no one seems to have questioned it and if they did they could only obey it).  In Gallipoli, after the massacre at Suvla Bay, Churchill quit the government.  It was a massive failure and a great massacre.  So, we haven't progressed one inch since these disasters.
0790729377|5.0|I continue to be impressed by young Brando.  I grew up hearing how much an acting genius Brando was in his hey day and I thought for the most part he was over-rated.  Course, I was coming from the angle of the older Brando.  Now after watching On the Waterfront and now Streetcar, I've been more than blown away.  Brando absolutely deserves his accolades.  In streetcar, he plays Stanley to the tee.  You don't catch him acting at all.  You whole heartedly believe him as this animal of a husband and you despise him for what he's doing to an obvious delusional woman.  I even feel for Stella being caught between two different people she loved.  I agree the material is stunning for its time and I continue to be impressed with Kazan's direction.  This movie deserved all its accolades.  If you haven't seen it, you're doing yourself a disserve.

B0013LPS8Y|3.0|Although Disc1 is certainly a sonic improvement over the rather muddy original CD release, it does up the loudness level a bit (A common effect on CD's in the last decade).  Some songs like \\"Surrender\\" are actually close to or are actually clipping in certain areas, which is a real shame. I'm also confused as to why the longer versions of \\"Seconds\\", \\"New Year's Day\\" and \\"Like a Song\\" weren't used in the re-mastering effort.<br /><br />But Disc2 is where my confusion really starts to sink in.  Many songs have been available as import CD Singles or B-sides and it's nice to have them all together on one CD.  And \\"Angels Too Tied To the Ground\\" is a new song for this very long U2 fan, so that was a very nice surprise.  However, they should have never added the newer New Year's Day mixes - they don't belong there!  If those were dropped, the CD would have been about 45 minutes long and they could have included other missing gems like the \\"Be There\\" demo plus the demos of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", \\"Like a Song\\", \\"Surrender\\" and \\"THBAO\\".<br /><br />6/2011 EDIT:  Since this first review, I've found more tools to access dynamic range (excellent tool called \\"Dynamic Range Meter\\").  I checked DISC1 of this re-master, and it received an overall score of \\"9\\" (fair).  The MSFL CD received a score of \\"11\\" (which is better).  This gels with what I saw with Audacity and also my own ears, back in 2008.

I believe it is Tolle's mission to reach out to those who may not be familiar with a simplier way of life.  It is a way to touch people's lives and show them a way to get out of the every day rat race and find a little peace from within.

B000ICLRIE|2.0|Kingdom of Boredom more like it.    Truly epic looking crusades flick has some eye popping battle scenes and looks gorgeous on Blu-Ray. Pity that it's such a colossal bore. Ridley Scott's a master artisan whose skills are fully on display in this sumptious production- but even he's struggling to haul a good movie out of a terribly wobbly script and fly weight leading man.    There's definately a lot of quality in this elephantine film, including the stellar supporting cast and terrific action scenes, but it doesn't come together with any narrative drive or vigour. And Bloom simply lacks any real screen prescence or charisma to be the hero of this-and he appears much too young to be credible. He'll have you pining for Russell Crowe and (if your a die hard movie buff) Arnold Schwarzenegger's famous unproduced movie about the Crusades that was going to be directed by Paul Vehoeven.

0783225725|5.0|'High Plains Drifter' is my very favourite Eastwood movie (and that's saying something). I especially like the dark humour and ambiguity, but in truth, there's not much I don't like.<br /><br />You just know something bad is gonna happen the moment you see him appearing through the desert heat-haze in the eerie title sequence, and by the time the film ends with the same shot in reverse (a la 'the Searchers'), something bad has!<br /><br />In between, we're treated to much violence, sexism, adultery, hypocrisy and general wretchedness from the Lago townsfolk - and they're supposed to be the victims!<br />These people are dire, far worse than the actual villains (who are gold-star nasty in a traditional sense); they stood and watched as their sheriff - the only honest character in the film - was whipped to death in the street.<br /><br />In essence, 'High Plains Drifter' is a cross between 'Witchfinder General,' 'High Noon' and 'the Omen' only with lashings more unpleasantness. The significant difference is that there's people to cheer for in those films - there's no-one here. Even the 'hero' appears a cruel, merciless killer, who is himself in no moral position to deliver salvation OR retribution to the cowering townsfolk.<br /><br />And who is he? The murdered sheriff's avenging kin? His ghost? The devil? The plot leads us up all the various avenues and alleyways but in the end it doesn't really matter. We're just glad that everyone who deserves retribution - gets it! The doing-good-via-bad clich&eacute; is hammered home, but again, we don't really care. We know right will out eventually, however perversely(and hopefully brutally!), because Eastwood's with the programme.<br /><br />Visually, the films superb. The town appears condensed, like a vacuum, especially when Eastwood demands it be painted red.<br />It's not the traditional homely Western hamlet which deserves to be defended by brave men for whom it's worthwhile giving their lives. It's a bleak, soul-less outpost, desperate and afraid of it's own shadowy secrets and the fact they're returning to haunt it when it thought they were buried with the sheriff.<br />Bruce Surtees camerawork effortlessly conveys this - and more (let's not give Eastwood ALL the credit). We get a very real sense of the artless, cuboid structures and the creepy inhabitants fully deserving each other.<br /><br />Performance-wise, Eastwood plays Eastwood (as he always does) with a twisted comic bravado (he knows he's distorting the western myth, by subverting the very iconography and legend that built it in the first place). He prowls the streets like Ann Coulter on the look-out for liberals; a cold glint as another low-life bites the dust.<br />Geoffrey Lewis is grotesquely brilliant as the drunken, heartless, leering chief villain, and the rare Verna Bloom is handsome and sassy as the rebellious wife of one of Lago's slimy conspirators.<br /><br />There's blood by the bucket, roaring gun-fights, an inevitable,(but well-staged) all consuming fire, seriously nasty whippings and there's even a squalid, squeaky-voiced dwarf who, along with some 'pesky injun savages', are the only people to benefit from the 'drifter's' brief tenure.<br /><br />'High Plains Drifter' is a delirious amalgam of all that's small and sleazy in our sugar-veneered world.

All the Hercule Poirot short stories by Agatha Christie in chronological order (note that the vast majority of the stories were first published in magazines so they don't necessarily agree with the order they were compiled in book form).  This contained a number of stories I had never read before, so I would say it's well worth the cost for any fan of the Belgian detective!

386521584X|5.0|In this new edition of THE AMERICANS, the publisher, Steidl seems to have taken every step necessary to maintain artistic integrity of Franks vision.  Even going as far as having Frank supervise the new printing of the photographs used in the book.  The paper used in the book is very high quality, perhaps even 'archival' grade. Of course, there is the Kerouac introduction that both rambles, amuses and enlightens. There is a small pamphlet included in the book briefly telling the background story of how this new edition came to life. While this pamphlet is basically an advertisement, it also  provides the passing fan of Robert Frank with a greater knowledge of what Frank has done over the course of his life by listing other books and movies that Stiedl will be publishing in the future. Thoughtfully, museum dates are also given for those interested enough to travel to D.C., SF or, NYC for the 50th anniversary celebration and exhibition of the book. From Steidl, this is a fine book; from Frank, a work of art; and a labor of love from all involved.
0385338082|4.0|A big fan of Shopaholic, I got this book the minute it was available in my library (I rarely buy books I'm not 100% sure I'll read again). Frankly, I expected a bit more.

As a whole, certainly not about to produce a series.

B0002ZEUJ0|4.0|This is a great album to pick up if you are just getting into Clapton, with staples like \\"Layla,\\" \\"Cocaine\\" and \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\" Doesn't have his later blues work, and lacks anything from the Cream era. Still, a very, very solid collection.

B000005IS1|5.0|This is the '90s CD reissue of this iconic band's 1969 debut on Elektra, with liner notes by the late Rob Tyner, the group's vocalist. Nobody, but nobody, rocked harder than the Five in the late '60s, and this album, recorded live on Halloween, 1968, at Detroit's Grande Ballroom, proves it. The group was actually politically active, too, which set it apart from, say, the West Coast psychedelic bands of the same period. \\"Come Together\\" is indescribably chaotic. These guys make fellow Detroiter Ted Nugent sound like Lawrence Welk. The group is long gone, having succumbed to the usual, but its name is still invoked with a certain amount of awe all these years later. This record demonstrates why.

B000002UAX|4.0|The Fab Four always respected their record-buying public, and adhered to their own standards as the flagship pop group of the era. Their quality control was tight.  They never released a live album, for example, because neither the quality of the performance nor the sound would have been up to snuff.  The \\"Let It Be\\" tapes sat on the shelf for months because the group weren't happy with them.  Parlophone, their U.K. label, didn't put out an entire album of material that had already been previously released until \\"A Collection of Beatles Oldies\\" came out in 1966, and the title of that record clearly indicated to buyers what they were getting.  Nevertheless, \\"The Beatles,\\" released in late 1968, clearly reveals a slip in quality from the top rung of the ladder.  Many listeners give this the usual 5-star Beatle album rating, but I don't.  Though high points abound (\\"Julia,\\" \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" \\"Blackbird,\\" \\"Helter Skelter,\\" et. al.), as the only double album the band released, it contains far too much half-baked screwing around in the studio. Paul McCartney's \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" (complete with bogus hillbilly accent) is one of his most overrated tunes, and no one can seriously argue that his \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\" is anything approaching a decent song.  For his part, John Lennon doesn't escape criticism, either; much of the record is taken up by his tape-recording experimentation (\\"Revolution 9\\"), which isn't songwriting, and really isn't that interesting, either, forty years later.  The White Album reflects the growing fragmentation of the group; by this time, the individual Beatles were writing and recording separately from the others.  Thus, the band's days were already numbered by the time this album came out.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I find this modern adaptation of Solaris better that the Tarkovsky version from 1971.   The Tarkovsky movie is great but its age really shows - can you take seriously astronauts in leather jackets, looking like early-stage alcoholics, and smoking cigarettes on a space station (so theatrical and 70s intellectual hip, though ;).   This new adaptation is engaging, hypnotic, moody, and intimate. [[ASIN:B00008IHLL The soundtrack]] greatly contributes to the mood too.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Even in its truncated U.S. version with its blurry cover shot, 1966's \\"Aftermath,\\" the first Stones album of all-original material, is indispensible.  The record is the dividing line between the group as scruffy young Brit blues-and-R&B cover artists, and what would  eventually become the most powerful and significant rock band in the world.  A large portion of the credit for this is due to Brian Jones, who is at his artistic peak here.  Jones' strength was his uncanny skill on all sorts of instruments besides guitar, and his marimba on \\"Under My Thumb,\\" and sitar on \\"Paint It, Black\\" give those two signature Stones tunes, in their original versions, their unique flavor.  The material (\\"Flight 505,\\" \\"Stupid Girl\\") was getting dark and misogynistic; it would get much, much darker in the next few years. The U.K. version (which this isn't, by the way) puts good songs like \\"Out of Time,\\" \\"What To Do,\\" and the single \\"Mother's Little Helper\\" (an anti-drug message from a band which later became synonymous with drug excess) in their proper context as far as the group's history is concerned.
0563524928|3.0|This just doesn't compare to his earlier two books, nor to his recent memoir.  I thought Kerry Shale did a poor job of narrating and finding Bryson's pace.

B000RJO578|2.0|The first 15 minutes are funny. It has quite a few tickling dialogues. The rest is more like any other regular action movie. I mean it contains lots of action, explosion and nonsense.    It's worth watching once.

B000K7VHQE|4.0|It contains good dark humour. It won't appeal to many people. Many scenes made me laugh and broke my heart at the same time. It's not suitable for children because of foul language, dirty jokes, and drug scenes.<br /><br />**** SPOILER. DO NOT READ THIS if you HAVE NOT WATCHED the MOVIE.<br /><br />For example, in the scene where the grandpa died in the hospital. The lady in charge of the corpse yelled at Greg Kinnear (the father) when he wanted to pospone the burial. She did not want to listen to his explanation why. It brillantly portraited how cruelly sometimes people treated each other. It moved me.<br /><br />The next scene is hilarious when it showed the family trying to sneak the corpse into their car to continue  their trip to California.<br /><br />The most moving scene was when Abigail walked to her brother who was extremely depressed and sitting on the ground. She then sat down beside him, saying nothing, just leanning on him.<br /><br />In the last scene, the director cleverly took aim at child-beauty-pageant industry. My stomach hurt when I saw kids from<br />5-7 years old in heavy makeup did their catwalk. Adults were exploiting kids for their profit and pleasure!<br /><br />Abigail Breslin was the best actress here. She's so cute, lovely, and innocently funny. She's naturally beautiful without any makeup. Yes, her dance was meant for adults. But in my opinion, it's acceptable and funny. Why was it okay for adults to exploit kids but it's not okay for kids to dance like adults?<br /><br />No wonder it got 2 Oscars in 2007. One was given to Michael Arndt for original screenplay. The other was given to Alan Arkin for best supporting actor.

0805047905|4.0|I read this to my hyper-active 3 year old daughter. The repetition of the rhythm helps calm her down before going to bed as if hypnotizing.

B000000WCX|4.0|David Bowie-Earthling ***1/2<br /><br />Is it worth owning? Well yes...but only for the simple fact that all Bowies work is worth owning. Bowie's willingness to try anything once is commendable, and his knack for creating new genres of music and latching on to new ones as they pop up is merritt worthy. Not when he tries to cram it all into one album, or even song as he does sometimes here on Earthling. While this album did bring a lot of what Prodigy and Nine Inch Nails did to the mainstream (mainly the latter) this was not his best attempt at industrial and trip-hop or house or whatever you want to call it. The bottom line is that almost everything on this album, he did better somewhere else. With a few exceptions of course.<br /><br />'Little Wonder' despite the repeat of the title over, and over again is a surprisingly great opener. The electro background makes for a great canvas for Bowies vocals. 'Looking For Satellites' works better than it should. The guitar work rivals that of Robert Fripps in the 1970's. The theme behind the lyrics is also one of his strongest. 'Battle For Britain' is brilliant, simply put. 'Im Afraid Of Americans' the big hit single is one of Bowies all time greats, no question about it. The same can be said for 'Dead Man Walking' which might be Bowies strongest release since 'Fashion.' The rest of the album however is below the radar so to speak. It is hardly listenable. And what works perfect on the rest of the albums fails on all the remaining tracks.<br /><br />Erathiling is not Bowies best album, and it isn't even in his top ten but it has enough not worthy tracks to make it worth owning. More than that I will go so far as to say two of his all time best songs can be found here making this release essential, minus it's low rating if you can believe it.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|This album is absolutely beautiful. I JUST got back from seeing them live in South Bend, IN. If you have a chance to see them live, DO IT! they are amazing performers and Brent Smith is a very intellectual and emotional performer. Shinedown, as well as their new cd 'The Sound of Madness', is truly amazing.
0521673763|4.0|The biochemical illustrations are excellent but the text is lacking in nuance.   (Maybe that book would require another thousand pages.)  The author, in my opinion, is far too keen on a strict medical model and acceptance of DSM IV TR \\"disorders\\" and outlier conditions as diseases for which there is a pill lying in wait.   The text glosses over these controversies the way that Powerpoint does at a pharma sponsored CME conference.       Nevertheless the chapter on antidepressant augmentation was excellent, though in practice I think it is foolish to use lithium for unipolar depression augmentation because it is the easiest drug to overdose on (and of course one of the big selling points of the SSRIs over TCAs to begin with was the safety factor in a suicide attempt.)   One treatment that I was not aware of, and I will definitely start using in refractory cases, is MTHF supplementation which appears very safe and effective.   I also learned quite a bit about alpha-2-delta ligands in the excellent chapter on ion channel blockers.    One chapter I had a lot of problems with was sleep disorders.  In my opinion, the author is too cavalier about using benzo hypnotics, despite the fact that most evidence based treatment guidelines (i.e ACOEM) specifically warn against this except as a very short-term solution.   I am disappointed that he failed to mention that these  a history of alcohol or drug dependence changes the whole treatment paradigm.   He seems enthusiastic about the \\"Z\\" hypnotics despite the scandalous promotion of Ambien as nonaddictive, a claim the manufacturer Aventis was forced to rescind.   Not to mention the literature on sleepwalking and sleep driving with this drug (the Patrick Kennedy incident may have been related to this).    I was also surprised to see Ambien CR (zolpidem CR) listed as a first line drug in the \\"hypnotic pharmacy\\" on page 849, under the premise of being nonaddictive.   I say, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me.   Inactual practice, the best move is to ditch all forms of Ambien, and go with Lunesta or even better yet, Rozerem, and only after trying a sedative antidepressant.    The avoidance of these issues was curious to me, because the author did not flinch from addressing the problems and controversies with antispsychotics in that excellent chapter.    I also believe that the TCAs were given too little attention for their effectiveness in pain syndromes.    The following complaint is mostly about DSM-IV-TR which is obviously not the author's fault, but I wish he hadn't gotten so drunk on Bob Spitzer's Kool-Aid.   Garbage in, garbage out, and if you are medicating a questionable diagnosis you will get questionable results or the condition will get better on its own, as it would have anyway.   Many would argue that the lowering of the bar for psychiatric diagnosis in DSM (i.e. autism, ADD, Major Depression, PTSD) has been a benefit as these conditions are now more reliably diagnosed and more people are getting help.   That may be true, but this has come at the expense of phenomenological validity.   If you and I have dysphoria and 4 other completely different symptoms, guess what, we have the same diagnosis, so what are we really dealing with?   If I \\"hear about\\" a tragic event and have some anxiety symptoms I can qualify for PTSD according to the DSM.   I guess Mohammed Atta caused mental disorder in 300 million Americans.   Does anyone believe that?   Thirty years ago, if someone told me their kid had ADD or autism, I knew exactly what to expect.   Today that child may be a moderately misbehaving child with poor social skills.   As Tony Soprano once sarcastically asked a school psychologist diagnosing ADD, \\"What constitutes a fidget?\\"     All of this inclusiveness, whether the motive is compassionate or monetary, creates enormous problems in psychopharmacological comparisons.   Older antidepressant and other psychopharm studies were done with severely ill patients with purepathology.   Today, the subjects may have a self-limited condition thanks to the changes in DSM.    The success numbers for most of the SSRI studies are as inflated as today's home run totals in baseball and cannot be compared to the data from 25-30 years ago on TCAs and MAOIs.    In other words, I don't buy a lot of the head to head comparisons and ratings in the text based on incomparable studies.   Data is emerging that these are actually much more efficacious than the SSRI's which the author considers (along with the majority of psychiatrists) to be first line treatment.    But let's be honest--the reason for this is defensive medicine, not because the new drugs are better.    In fact, every senior psychopharmacologist knows that short of ECT, nothing works for refractory cases like Parnate, which is hardly ever used anymore.   However, I do give the author of coming to the defense of MAOIs with some great illustrations about how the dietary problems with this group are completely overblown.         Despite these problems, I credit the author for a monumental undertaking.   Obviously anything this prolific and robust will contain material with which some practitioners disagree.   That would be no different if I had written it myself.    James O'Brien, M.D.
0143038419|1.0|If this book were fiction and entitled \\"A Narcissist Travels the World but Sees Only Herself\\" it might be interesting as irony.  As is, however, the combination of self-absorption and spiritual pretensions is intolerable.     Just about any religion has at least two components, an ethical component emphasizing how one should treat others and a spiritual component concerning one's relation to the deity.  Take the ethical component alone and you get secular humanism which some of us are actually quite fond of.  Take the yearning for spiritual solace alone and you get New Age.      When her sister tells her about a family struck with a double tragedy of cancer her Gilbertism is \\"Dear God, that family needs grace.\\" Her sister replies, \\"That family needs casseroles,\\" and organizes the neighborhood to bring dinner to the family. Gilbert - I do not know if my sister fully recognizes that this is grace.  But one has to wonder about Gilbert's idea of a spiritual grace that doesn't seem to involve empathetic awareness of others -- I don't think we are about to see Gilbert making any casseroles.    Having recently read Mark Salzman's \\"Iron and Silk\\" [[ASIN:0394755111 Iron and Silk]]about his year teaching in China and his long-time love of Chinese martial arts I couldn't help but contrast his self-deprecating tone and his awareness of another culture and of other people.  Salzman sees other's generosity where Gilbert only sees her own magnetic personality. Salzman portrays both how attractive and how alien another culture can be.  He sees other people where Gilbert sees only herself.  Salzman remains aware and responsive to how taxing to themselves and their family the generousity of people living in poverty can be - Gilbert remains oblivious.     In one vignette, Salzman describes how he draws a picture of a fishing boat and gives the picture to the owners of the boat. The fisherman then wants to give the boat to Salzman. Salzman recognizes that he must accept something and says that in his country the proper gift for something artistic is something else artistic and asks for and gets each member of the family to sing him a folk song.  It is not just that Gilbert lacks empathetic skill, but seems to be uninterested in feelings other than her own.
0312427999|5.0|For a long time I tried to understand what's going on in the world and two books made that very clear to me now. Naomi Klein with this book and John Perkins \\"Confessions of an Economic Hit Man.\\"  Since every country loves growth and China rate of growth is the highest in world history and from what is happening in what used to be called America under Bush fascism, then it follows rationally (not in philosophical sense) that if can't beat them join.

0521673763|5.0|Essential Pharmacology is comprehensive and most informative. Diagnostic subjects range from mood disorders to ADHD to Fibromyalgia. The text elucidates genetics and mechanism of action through the liberal use of cartoons which are for the most part illuminating but are at times trivial. My only complaint is the lack of information on eating disorders.  Which has more to do with the general ignorance of the subject vs. an editorial neglect.

1582701709|4.0|I do find it interesting that those who find the reviews \\"helpful\\" seem to lean toward the negative responses.  Those more positive responses about the book have little or no support for a helpful review.  A lot of negativity floating around out there.  Doesn't anyone find that \\"interesting\\"?  People have always accused me of wearing rose-colored glasses while riding my rainbow - but then again, good things always come my way while those who would ridicule me continue to spiral down in some sort of dramatic demise.  I'd rather wear my rose-colored glasses than hide behind dark sunglasses any day while complaining I can't see.  Make your on luck people.  Don't wait for it.  That's all this book is telling you.  That's what life is telling you.  Can you \\"wish away\\" bad things?  No.  But you can instill action.  Do something, instead of waiting for something to happen to you or FOR you.  Is that so wrong?  What's that old tried and true saying?  Oh yeah...God helps those who help themselves.  Do that one.  Or you can do the other old tried and true statement...Misery loves company.

6305161992|2.0|Showdown in Little Tokyo is one of those generic action movies from the early 90's that is so bad that's kind of enjoyable to watch as trashy entertainment.  What makes it even more enjoyable is the fact that it stars a young Brandon Lee as a wise-cracking cop who teams up with a tough guy cop (Dolph Lundgren) to take on a Yakuza drug boss (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa).  Showdown in Little Tokyo features atrocious (and occasionally funny) dialogue, tons of cliche story elements (the bad guy also killed Lundgren's parents when he was a child), sloppy editing, and a training montage to boot!  Tia Carrere has a thankless role as a damsel that gets wooed by Dolph, and the action and fight scenes are a mix of sloppily put together (the concluding fight during the parade) to well choreographed (most of Lee's sequences).  All in all, Showdown in Little Tokyo should be unbelievably bad, but it has a sense of charm about it's comic book-style mayhem, and seeing Brandon Lee work his magic (there just isn't enough of him here) is reason enough to see this flick.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|Coldplay is still, the most vital band relevant to the contemporary music scene.  They happen to be a bit better melodic, wordsmith, balladeers than most groups trying to pass as hip contemporary music makers.

B00000J631|5.0|I'm a long time fan of NOFX and any band that Fat Mike signs to his label \\"Fat Wreck Chords,\\" I always decide to give a chance. There's a lot of cool bands on here and a lot of fun songs. Some songs aren't so great and some songs are awesome. There's a lot of creativity within some of these songs (i.e. WIZO, NOMEANSNO, etc.) This isn't something that's gonna blow your mind as far as talent is concerned (except THE LIVING END song, that song is just insane!) Although a lot of these bands definitely are talented, they are all 30 seconds long give or take. I just think it's such an original idea that only someone like Fat Mike can think up and I think it's just dandy! The thing that makes this CD so great, and pardon me if I'm being redundant, is that it's just so damn fun to listen to! It's a CD you don't have to take so seriously, and a lot of the bands seemed to have figured it out, and you'll understand what I mean if you listen to some of the lyrics. This is what punk rock is all about in my opinion, not that punk bands should just write 30 second songs all the time, but about the feel, the message, and the deliberate \\"I don't give a f***\\" attitude that punk rock has always represented even in the evolution of the music itself. If you just want a fun CD to listen to, where no matter how short your attention span is, you can listen to every song individually, then this CD is definitely for you!

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is one of those rare shows that combines creative writing, strong acting, and great characters.  It may be the best tv show that I've seen in many years--aside from mini-serieses on PBS.  Dexter is wonderfully entertaining.
B0013LPS6Q|4.0|Before he became a globe-trotting messiah of egotistical goodwill in gigantically fashionable wrap-around shades, Bono was just  a wide-eyed Irish kid with an expressive voice and a mullet more impressive than Billy Ray Cyrus.  I mean, he had a LOT of hair--but so did Adam, Larry, and the Edge.  Collectively, they all were just another of many contenders: not for the mantle of arena rock superstars, but, more modestly, for the title of greatest post-punk/early college rock export from the British Isles.    As their opening statement, Boy is a pretty straightforward guitar rock album; angular and melodic in many parts, a bit dull and same-sounding in others.  An easy comparison to make is that this is to U2 as Pablo Honey would be to Radiohead over a decade later.  But if Radiohead boasted a downer anthem for slackers in \\"Creep\\", U2 offered pretty much the opposite: an upbeat anthem of hope to future do-gooders in the evergreen \\"I Will Follow\\".  This is still one of their greatest songs and, really, one of the greatest singles ever.  As the opening track, it casts a long shadow but one that is absolutely crucial as a statement of purpose, correctly announcing U2 as a band that is just a bit more ambitious, just a bit more socially conscious, just a bit bigger than their superficially similar left-of-the dial peers.  Put another way, the DNA for The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby is here, in small doses, ready to be transcribed, then translated in successive years.      The remastering on this disc might upset some audiophiles complaining that it is merely louder and with a reduced dynamic range compared to the original CD.  I have not done a side-by-side comparison, but to these ears the sound is full and clear and ultimately quite satisfying.  The deluxe 2-CD edition of this album is for rich collectors or obsessive completists only--these are the only early songs you really need.  The reasonably expansive booklet is a nice souvenir, but I sort of wish they would havewent for the abstract, Rorschach style cover used on the original domestic CD release instead of the vaguely pedophilic photograph resurrected from the original LP.  (In fact, I have a theory that the boy looks so angry on the War cover because he's still mad at his depiction on this album!)
B0002EXH54|4.0|I've had this album in one form or another since it came out in the 80's, so I've had plenty of time to listen to it, and I've come to this conclusion:    This is one of Megadeth's angriest and fastest albums, if Pantera defines heavy metal agression, Megadeth defines the heavy metal tantrum.  The riffs are complex, the beats are fast, and the songs are hard and angry.  Make no mistake though - this is a very technical group of songs played well by virtuoso musicians.      The writing isn't quite up to par with later work on \\"Rust in Peace\\" and \\"Symphony of Destruction\\" - there are no single songs that blow me away.  All of the songs follow a similar pattern of building up from a slow intro more often then not into a thrash metal grind-fest.  For that reason and others, many of the songs sound the same - which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Megadeth found something that worked and they went with it.  However, on later albums, Mustaine and his band branch out a bit more creating a more interesting result.    What you'll hear a lot more of on this album than others are thrash anthems, lots of grinding guitars, fast and nimble drumming, and a very angry Dave Mustaine.  The intensity of the songs are almost overwhelming.  This is the lineup of songs that would be the most likely of any in this groups catalog to whip mosh pits into a frenzy.      Right away, you can tell what the remastering is doing for this album.  Not to take away anything from Menza/Friedman on later albums, but I'm convinced Gar Samuelson and Chris Poland are the most definitive lineup Megadeth has had, if not the most talented - so it's kind of a shame they had to break with those guys. (Chris Poland does play on \\"The System has Failed\\" released almost 20 years later and shows he still has his chops).      Below is a track by track rating for people who are interested in that sort of thing.    My scale - not approved by anyone....  1 = So offensively awful, my cd player practically vomits it  2 =Bad enough to skip over  3 = Good filler - works in the right mix  4 = I'll put the CD in to listen to this track  5 = I'll pull the record out of it's sleeve and bust out the cleaning solution to listen to this track    Title/BPM/Key    1) Wake up Dead(4)/162/E - Mostly instrumental, a grinding testament to the musicianship in the lineup used on this recording.  The remaster gives the drums and the bass an emphasis that was sadly missing from the original, and the results rock!    2) The Conjuring(4)/??/E - Has a nice grinding jam in the break (interesting side-note, Mustaine - who is now a reborn christian - states that he wrote this song with a true intent during a brief period where he was trying his hand at black magic.  For this reason, he no longer plays this song live ([...]).    3) Peace Sells(4)/138/E - Starts with the famous bassline that MTV still uses in it's ads today.  Angry anti-establishment anthem.  Ends with one of the more memorable chants - \\"Peace Sells... But Who's Buying....\\". Use to get pumped up for whatever....    4) Devils Island(3)/180/ - A little dated and hampered by Mustaine's pre-recovery vocals (ie. basically shouting and roughly in tune in places).  Still has the grinding thrash guitars and some excellent drum-work.    5) Good Mourning/Black Friday(3)/186/E - Sort of a prog anthem.  Starts with a slow dirge and slowly gains intensity until it reaches a climax of rapid fire drum hits to chants of \\"Black Friday\\"    6) Bad Omen(3)/240/E - Contains possibly the most technically challenging opening on the album with Ellefson and Poland playing fast scales in unison.  The whole thing culminates in a super-fast grind in E with Poland basically running rough-shod over everything with his expert fretwork.    7) I Aint Superstitious(3)/156/F# - A 3/4 swing riff with the obligatory thrash break.    8) My Last Words(4)/270/D - I remember hearing this the year it came out on college radio (the only place you had a prayer of hearing this kind ofmusic back in those days), so for me, it's probably the most memorable song on the album, the remaster really gets rid of the muddiness in the guitar that hampered the original mix, and what a huge difference it makes!  Like other songs on the album, it starts with a slow guitar/bass duet, then morphs into a driving thrash beat that culminates into a call/response grind.    ==============================  The following bonus remixes were also included.  Each one is worthwhile to listen to a slightly different version of the song, but overall doesn't really add much to the record.  But - I'm never going to complain about getting more for my dollar, so with that said......    Seems like the approach taken on this remix songs was to maintain the gating etc on the drums, but beef up the low and high ends a bit.  I prefer the original remasters, but these are also ok.  ==============================  Wake up Dead  The Conjuring  Peace Sells  Good Mourning/Black Friday
B000S0GYRU|1.0|What are all these people talking about, this movie was not scary at  all!! As a matter a fact it was just down right boring.I was very dissapointed because I got this movie based on the reviews and it wasn't worth it. If you want a movie thats going to put you to sleep, get this.
B0014466LS|2.0|This is after the brilliant \\"Hysteria\\" Def Leppard's second best album by far and no mean feat considering the drummer only had one arm by this time and Steve Clark had just died! Almost every track is brilliant and the hit single \\"Let's Get Rocked\\" is actually one of the weaker tracks too!  It's frightening how much better it'll sound once they get around to remastering this thing.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is not one of those times. Given the very hefty price tag on this thing in order to justify upgrading from your existing copy, it has got to be a major improvement at least from the aesthetics of the cardboard sleeve and especially when it comes to sound quality. The cardboard sleeve is nothing to shout about given what is currently out there e.g. The Band, Hall & Oates etc that have been very well designed from thicker good quality cardboard which is so well assembled that you don't fear it coming apart when the glue wears out like it is here. In fact, when it comes to the mlps version of \\"The Band\\" the only way to describe it is as a brilliant work of art; you'll have to see it to know what I mean about someone having great pride in his work to come up with what I believe is still the very best mlps version of an album that is currently out there.<br /><br />The inclusion of the inner jacket replica and an insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese also isn't enough to justify a ridiculously expensive upgrade.  The biggest crime though is the SHM-CD sound quality which is really very poor. In fact, my existing old copy sounds even better! Listening to both, there is nothing to distinguish between the two except for the cardboard sleeve with the SHM-CD label on the front and the vastly different sound quality which is no better than the old copy. I'm disappointed to have waited so long and this is what they have come up with: poor mlps design and sound quality that is no improvement over my existing old copy. The only plus is that they have added two bonus tracks: \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" and \\"She's Too Tough\\" which is a nice touch.  I have placed SHM-CD orders for other albums that are due to reach me soon and I hope and pray that they are much, much better sounding versions than this one.<br /><br />Given the very high price on this baby for a version that is no improvement over the unremastered old cd that you already have, this is a rip off and a major waste of money in these uncertain economic times.<br /><br />Avoid with as wide a berth as possible!tracks: \\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" and \\"She's Too Tough\\" which is a nice touch.

B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay, probably known for its mellow tunes, is going revolutionary with its new album, \\"Viva La Vida\\".  Now, it is revolutionary for Coldplay as a music group but it is not revolutionary in the music world.  The band that comes to my mind is the Beatles in 1960s which was truly revolutionary.  In fact, one of the songs (\\"Violet Hill\\") from this album resonate a similar tune to a Beatles' song.<br /><br />The title song, \\"Viva La Vida\\", has some interesting lyrics about a once powerful ruler who abuses his power.  The people naturally rebel and there you have the theme of the song.  Some of the imagery in the lyrics is quite vivid and powerful in the lines below.<br /><br />People couldn't believe what I'd become<br />Revolutionaries wait<br />For my head on a silver plate<br />Just a puppet on a lonely string<br />Oh, who would ever wanna be king<br /><br />The last couple lines in the above verse are probably the most interesting of the entire song.  It makes reference to the façade of empowerment as just being a stage performance being judged by its people in the audience.  It's a bit conflicting to pity the ruler and also support the revolutionaries.  But, Chris Martin probably wanted to portray the leader as \\"one of us\\" who has the bad case of \\"egotism\\" from these lyrics below.<br /><br />I used to rule the world<br />Seas would rise when I gave the word<br />Now in the morning I sleep alone<br />Sweep the streets I used to own<br /><br />The rest of the album has some really cool songs.  In fact, the opening song (\\"Life in Technicolor\\") is mostly acoustical music.  The first time anyone hears this will shock almost everyone because you waiting for Martin to gently coo out the lyrics.  It's a big tease but the melody makes up for it.  As always, the music is lush with some interesting instruments like violins and harpsichord.  \\"Yes\\" has the best introduction with violins drawing you it and then disappearing.  Next, the harpsichord chimes to make for a delicious tune for your ears.  Other favorites are \\"Lovers in Japan\\" and \\"Violet Hill\\".  The music video just came out for \\"Violet Hill\\" which is as good as any other band video.  It's sad when you think about 80's videos being revolutionary with Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Peter Gabriel.  Oh well, this new Coldplay album is revolutionary in its own way.  It's a change in Coldplay's repertoire which is refreshing.\\"Violet Hill\\".  The music video just came out for \\"Violet Hill\\" which is as good as any other band video.

B00005R2IS|4.0|... and I don't just mean the Mad Max saga but the Mel Gibson story. I'd heard this movie got Mel Gibson noticed among the big players - seeing it today made me believe it.<br /><br />The movie begins with a car chase, with some really gutsy destruction sequences, somewhere amongst which, Gibson makes his entry as an \\"Interceptor\\", a cop from the near future - where this story is based - trying to make order in this \\"Anarchie\\" (no kidding! that's the name of the Ln mentioned in the first few shots of the film!). The government is pretty much non-existent in this futuristic flick, and gangs of roadies have taken up terrorizing and literally ruling the outlands.<br /><br />Max, along with his partner - Office Jim Goose, takes his work seriously, and intends to clean the scrounge of the town, before his partner becomes a casualty of the war. Max suddeny is afraid for his family, and realizes he's not ready to take this war to its bitter end, and decides to take a break from his cop-career.<br /><br />What follows is an eerie rendition, out on the Australian outback, of the origins of the character of Mad Max, before it got the adjective Mad; with some really slick editing and heart-pumping action. The chase sequences are simply great and the lack of dialogues makes it that much more watchable. Not much to speak - if you're into killing amd ambushing for a living.<br /><br />This movie is the first of the trilogy of Mad Max, and is a good one at that. You get to see where Gibson learnt the conviction and grittyness that has since marked so many of his roles, notably Lethal Weapon, Conspiracy Theory, and The Patriot.<br /><br />Must see - for Gibson and Mad Max fans!

B00001QGPR|4.0|An artistic comeback for Dave, who at the time hadn't made an honestly good album since the early '80s. With this album, Bowie both came to terms with being old and scored his best-produced album since Scary Monsters or so. The synthesizers here sound great! And the production stuff does, too! In fact, the production and arrangements are so good on several of these tracks that their lack of any hooks doesn't matter. For instance, \\"Something in the Air\\" doesn't have much by way of an interesting melody, but it has a lot by way of interesting \\"stuff.\\" Same deal with \\"Survive,\\" which hits a captivating climax and has a really pretty piano part.  \\"Thursday's Child\\" actually has a good melody in addition to interesting production, though. The arrangement on \\"If I'm Dreaming My Life,\\" a rare example of a good epic synth-rocker, is ace as well. The lyrics also much be mentioned, as most of them are quite introspective. It's Bowie taking a good, hard look at his life from the perspective of a weary old man, and discovering he doesn't like it. It's odd to think of an old David Bowie. After all, his most famous character died young, and after years of cocaine-fueled debauchery, it probably looked to many like David himself was going to follow the same path. But this rather morbid fixation especially comes into play on the excellent \\"trip-folk\\" of \\"Seven\\" - as in \\"I've got seven days to live my life and seven days to die.\\" I'd say it's easily the best song on this album, since once more it weds arranging and melodic skills in a way most of these other songs don't. The more \\"heavenly\\" material is fine - the grungy rockers, not so much. Be it the chugging \\"The Pretty Things are Going to Hell\\" or the overbearing \\"What's Really Happening,\\" they don't work. \\"New Angels of Promise\\" is a bit better than those, once more because of the trippy production, which also carries the transitional instrumental \\"Brilliant Adventure.\\" Since the songs themselves aren't Bowie's best, this is an example of an album I like because of the sound, the vibe, or whatever. It's good. And it was also his best album in several years at the time.xample of an album I like because of the sound, the vibe, or whatever. It's good.

B00011V8CW|2.0|Yeah, man. This is what I've always wanted. David Bowie combined with trip-hop, techno, and house music. Seriously, now this is a bit much even for me, a guy who loves experimentation and really appreciates Bowie's love of it. But did you know this album has more annoying keyboards on its first two tracks than the previous two albums had put together? Whatever entertainment I might've gotten out of \\"The Wedding,\\" \\"You've Been Around,\\" and \\"Night Flight\\" are violently sapped out by synthesizers and vocodors. And the house cover of \\"I Feel Free\\" is so wretched, it can't even win points for unintended laughs. It just blows, that's all. I'm not saying the album is fully hopeless, unlike the last two. I actually like a few of these songs! For instance, he does cool stuff with the synth-funk whateverness on the title track and \\"Jump They Say.\\" And the weird pseudo-instrumental \\"Pallas Athena\\" isn't too bad, I suppose. The muted trumpet does sound nice. And \\"Miracle Goodnight\\" is funky enough to be passable. But those are exceptions. The ballad \\"Don't Let Me Down and Down\\" lets one down and down, as much as I hate to sink to that level of bad punning - it's a terrible \\"atmospheric\\" track. And the rave-jazz thing becomes quite annoying by the time \\"Looking for Lester\\" comes around. I guess I should at least try to be happy because \\"I Know It's Gonna Happen Someday\\" is organic, but the sappy gospel chorus grates at my ears. And then \\"The Wedding Song\\" sends everybody involved home unhappy. It's pretty much useless to argue that yes, this is superior to its two predecessors. But it's still pretty bad. Thankfully, Bowie's comeback was on its way.

You certainly have plenty of acting talent.  It's too bad it was wasted on such  a vapid screenplay. And the sets are colorful. But that's about it! Watching this movie is about as exciting as watching planes land and take-off at an airport. Sure some people may find that exciting, but most people don't.<br /><br />If I had to sum up this film, I would say it lack's heart.  The writer's of the screenplay certainly went out of their way  NOT to do, or say, absolutely anything to offend anyone! This is the ultimate perfect film for small children. It's so plain vanilla, parents will have nothing to worry about! Unfortunately, for the rest of  us, it wasn't marketed as a children's only film!<br /><br />I don't expect a Jules Verne story to make sense - it's a delightful  fantasy.

I also recommend Veganomicon as a great overall vegan cookbook. Simple recipes in both, delivered with enthusiasm, fun and expertise.    Enjoy!!!  Perry Tow  Placerville, California
B0015YDK1Q|4.0|Yes, it's a great CD and DVD...and my expectations were fulfilled. I've seen Mana in concert twice and the DVD and music are great representations of the experience. Great delivery of the songs, too, and so it's well worth the money.    Didn't get five stars because, as another reviewer mentioned, just too much that's covered in En Vivo. And do we really need another live recording of \\"El Rey\\"? Yes, these are the songs you'd hear at the concert so I suppose that's the reason the selections were made, so I can cut the band some slack. Five stars would have been warranted if it had been double length with some more newer songs.
B00000K19E|2.0|I first saw this movie in the theater back in 1999. It had its moments, but not many. To start, the acting is terrible. Keanu Reeves has the emotive ability of a toaster, and Carrie Ann Moss is about as sympathetic as the ubiquitous sexy sidekick babe in a generic video game. Lawrence Fishburne comes off a bit better, but his dialogue is the most pretentious, ridiculous garbage I've ever heard. I imagine the characters in this film spend about six hours out of every day designing the leather bondage costumes they'll wear next time they're in the Matrix.    For the first half of the movie, it seems to be interested in questioning reality, which, as the title to my review suggests, was already done more topically in previous films. \\"The Matrix\\" is astounded by what it perceives as its own brilliance, but for those of us who have thought of its ideas before, there are few surprises. Some people I know were blown away when Neo discovers the truth behind his reality, but I was waiting for something interesting to happen.    \\"The Matrix\\" has been praised for its originality, but it suffers from two traditional and clichéd movie formulas. First, Neo is the Chosen One (notice that \\"neo\\" is an anagram of \\"one.\\" Was this supposed to be suspenseful?) who is destined to save the human race, bring balance to the Force, etc. He dies and comes back to life, like Jesus. Of course, to begin with he was just a pasty hacker in a crummy apartment and an anonymous office job, giving hope to all the spotty teenage geeks in the audience that they too might become the Messiah one day.    The second fault is the movie's reliance on action. Instead of coming up with interesting and exciting ways for two people to fight each other in virtual reality, Neo and Co. whip out their guns and start shooting. The techno music begins, and the audience is treated to several slow-motion kicks and scenes of people dodging bullets. I'm not sure how they manage all this, because nobody ever takes off their sunglasses to see properly. If the villains of the movie really were programs in the Matrix, shouldn't they be able to manipulate it without having to resort to kung fu?    Anyway, I didn't like this movie. \\"Dark City\\" is a better, more original version of the same premise, without the Chosen One nonsense or the martial arts.

0671646788|5.0|Rating self help/achievement books for me comes down to three critical factors; introducing new or profound principles, lasting affect, and quality of writing.  Few if any books rate high among all three, but those that come close are immensely valuable.<br /><br />The Magic of Thinking Big achieves high marks across all three of these elements as it illustrates the success mindset better than any book I have read, it resonates with me years after my initial reading due to an abundance of inspirational nuggets, and the writing style will leave any reader motivated and rightly confident.<br /><br />The Magic of Thinking Big focuses on the mindset required to become successful in any venture.  Acquiring the proper attitude and developing successful habits unquestionably represents the first and most critical step in any success.  Where many books on the topic offer nothing more than basic pep talks and \\"you can do it\\" attitudes, Schwartz does an admirable job presenting a logical account expressing why the use of fundamental motivation and action habits are based on a focused state of mind.<br /><br />Schwartz bestows a couple of my favorite quotes in this book as well:<br /><br />\\"Study the lives of successful people and you will discover this: all the excuses made by the mediocre fellow could be but aren't made by the successful person\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"A man is not doing much until the cause he works for possesses all there is of him\\".<br /><br />Both these quotes resonate with every successful person I have encountered and give a mere taste for the pages of valuable content in this book.  I recommend The Magic of Thinking Big as the initial book to anyone seeking to find success in any endeavor.

B000K15VSA|5.0|Reviewing this DVD set is simple. Basically, for someone who might at all wonder whether to buy it, it is a must-have. For anybody else, it won't mean anything and it is a waste of money.    Okay, so I am a Blade Runner fan. I love just about everything about this movie, and seeing it back when it came out was a formative experience for a young movie fan. Consequently, I won't even attempt to review the movie as such, since it wouldn't be very even-handed or rational anyway. Bascially, if you are already a Blade Runner fan, you know, and if not, I suppose all I can say is that I kinda recommend to watch it at least once.    So, now that we are among ourselves, what about this edition. Well, it's great, it's what fans have been waiting for, it's well-made, contains all the relevant editions of the movie that matter (including, of course, the \\"final\\" one), plus a few gimmicks that will only be appreciated by die hard fans. The quality of sound and video is what you would expect it to be, i.e. great.    Anyway, I suppose most Blade Runner fans already have ordered this and only casually peruse the reviews to see what others think about it. I think it's a worthy edition for the 25th anniversary. Great for fans, too much of a good thing (and way too gimmicky) for more casual viewers.
B0002O0CM0|2.0|Now is your chance to hear the Doors without that creative spark that made them conceptually and lyrically interesting if not great. Its evident from the git go that something is missing. Get Up And Dance from Full Circle for example is a generic rocker coupled with the bargain basement exhortations to \\"get up and dance\\" (the only lyrics I might add) It doesn't sound remotely like the Doors but more like a competent bar band playing at an amusement park. Hey kids its time to PARTY! Other lyrics are almost as bad. Verdillac has the lyric \\"get me some coffee from my favorite cup or I might have to conjure up spirits, spirits, sprits.\\" But at least Verdillac has a groove and some funky organ. And that pretty much exemplifies the major problem with these albums. Tho the instrumentation sometimes achieves a level commensurate with the Doors, the so so singing, just plain awful lyrics and the complete lack of concept drag the whole mess right down into a pool of lukewarm mediocre. Without Jim these guys become nothing more than competent musicians. They seem completely rudderless. The muse is gone. For the curious only.

I also found that I couldn't stop listening to \\"I Don't Love You\\", and \\"Cancer\\" moved me so much that I started crying. \\"This is How I Disappear\\" is also a great track.    All in all, I enjoy this album immensely and listen to it all of the time.

B00005JPY0|5.0|I went to see Dark Knight this afternoon and I was blown away. I think Heath Ledger would've liked to know that his last role was gonna be that of the legendary Joker. I mean, this is Batman's all time hardest enemy. He makes Stephen King's IT look like a simple mad dog. And the Two-Face they used in this movie....he was more real than in \\"Forever\\". Tommy Lee Jones was believable with his loud mouth and his action sequences, but Aaron Eckhart pulled off the insanity and angry bits very well.<br /><br />Rest in peace, Heath Ledger. You will be missed.

0156034565|5.0|\\"Salmon Fishing In The Yemen (SFIY)\\" is an unusually eye-catching title for a book. If your curiosity is piqued and you feel tempted to check it out, my advice is to go ahead and succumb unreservedly, especially if you enjoy English humour of the tongue-in-cheek variety for Paul Torday's debut novel is intelligent, funny and gloriously entertaining.     Presented as a tapestry of letters, emails, memos, diary entries, interviews, etc, SFIY satirizes, indeed lampoons the current state of English politics, exposing it as a non-stop circus stage managed by spin doctors out to ensure the popularity of the prime minister, regardless of the truth and whatever the cost.  There is undoubtedly an element of farce in a storyline such as this - the introduction of salmon fishing under the desert conditions of Yemen is as absurd as the title suggests - yet in his storytelling, Torday maintains as straight a face as he can manage without any serious lapses and that's strong testimony to his developing craft.     Poor Dr Alfred Jones - the man at the center of this ludicrous project - is as hapless as a scientist untutored in the ways of dirty politics is expected to be...but there's more. Not only is he kicked around like a football by David Sugden, his two-faced evil master and Peter Maxwell, the public relations chief from the PM's office, - Sugden is surely the face of the devil - he is the poodle of his wife, Mary, who must be the most dreadful, self righteous and self absorbed woman to walk the face of this earth. Her non-stop volley of sanctimonious diatribes against poor Alfred - mostly via email 'cos she sees him as an unreliable provider so needs to secure her own independence elsewhere by working her own career (are feminists supposed to be sympathetic ?) - makes one want to give her a mighty tight slap across the face but ironically also provide some of the most wince-inducingly funny lines in the novel.  The attempt at injecting a hint of romance in the story is nevertheless a little tentative and shaky. Harriet, Alfred's partner in the fishing project, is the potential love interest but when she dissolves into floods of tears once her boyfriend goes missing in action and never recovers from it, becomes a lost hope for Alfred. Elsewhere, as the fishing project escalates, the tide of memo, email and phone call exchanges between Maxwell and Sugden also gathers pace as the plot spins relentlessly towards its own inevitable tragic conclusion. It's like an episode from the \\"Yes Prime Minister\\" TV series but with real consequences.     SFIY is an impressive debut by the undoubtedly talented Torday.  He's since written another book which should be worth checking out on the strength of this highly enjoyable debut.
B0012Q732O|5.0|[[ASIN:B0012Q732O 10,000 B.C.]]  I got this for my nephew who just turned nine. He thought the movie was awesome I thought it was pretty good myself.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day Lewis) is a nearly emotionless man, a business first prospector and oil man who will do whatever it takes to be rich.  He comes off at times a bit possessed by the concerns and desires of becoming a filthy rich oil baron, at others a somewhat caring man, including his son H.W. Plainview in nearly all his business meetings and speeches with land-owners.<br /><br />A mysterious young boy comes to Plainview one day with tales of cheap oil land for sale in California.  He seems interested in a quick buck, but also willing to hand over the whereabouts of land that could provide Plainview untold riches.<br /><br />The small town Plainview was told about is Little Boston, and therein lives Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a very contradictory man.  Pious yet greedy, interested in the church's prosperity but also his own stardom, perhaps a televangelist before the advent of television, Eli yearns for the power that Daniel already has and demands from others.<br /><br />The movie does a great job of displaying the incredibly harsh, dangerous life of a miner at the turn of the last century.  In this trying environment, a man will do anything for what he covets.  The juxtaposition of two powerhouse characters, who seemingly share aspirations as well as vices, is destined from the very beginning to cause a clash of wills.  Once each character is made to publicly display their flaws - Daniel's failures as a father and Eli's blasphemous nature - there is no turning back.<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is a good movie, but it's not as great as it's made out to be.  It gained Hollywood's flavor of the month shortly after its release, and Daniel Day Lewis is the best of his career and deserving of every accolade, but it's far too slow in short spells for it to be a truly epic movie.
B0017MO10U|3.0|In Stargate Continuum, several actors from the past ten seasons of the show make an appearance, including the much anticipates Richard Dean Anderson guest spot. The movie does several things to separate itself from the the long running TV show such as adding a bit of spice to the language(there is some cursing) and give us a little bit more blood when it comes to the violence. Other than that, it really isn't that different from any 2-part or 3-part story arc from the episodes in the seasons. So essentially, instead of watching a movie, you are really watching a 3-part series finale without the restrictions put on it by a cable network for ratings purposes, which is actually kinda nice. The problem however, is that this story has been done before. If you have seen the SG-1 season finale of season 8, then you have seen this movie already, just with different characters in some spots. My problem with this movie is that it really isn't a movie it's just another episode, although I love the series, so of course it is fun to watch our favorite characters do what the do. But after awhile you begin to realize, as I have, that MGM has actually done nothing new with any of the Stargate franchises for about the last 3 years. The writers seem to suffer from \\"copy & paste\\" syndrome, or sheer exhaustion and can't give us anything new. It is hard, as a die-hard fan to notice this until you take the time to look back and see how you have gotten where you are. The perfect example of this? Star Wars Episode I. The first time I saw it after waiting in line for 36hrs I thought it was the best and coolest movie ever made. My anticipation of its release however, clouded my judgment. When I saw it the 3rd time I realized I hated Jar Jar Binks. I haven't watched that movie for almost 4 years now. I am fearful of the same happening with the Stargate SG-1 movies and the most recent season of Atlantis as well. I love watching and re-watching the first 8 seasons of SG-1 and first 3 of Atlantis but with these movies I don't think I will. They are enjoyable, but they have lost their magic and the awe that I felt at the end of seasons 6 and 7 when I though that SG was the best show on TV-and it was. But when You have a budget ten times greater than you did for the season finale of season 7, why can't you do more on screen? Many fans who are awaiting that ever elusive \\"epic space battle\\" will be disappointed because, despite the millions they spent on this film, it's not there. Like the title says, great quality with the sets, acting and effects, but there is nothing new. I guess the actors are getting paid too much now for the extra flair, but that's why I keep coming back, and that's why I will still buy this film, because I still have hope that the writers can give me not only a new and fresh story line, but something more grand and majestic than I've ever seen in outer space. (And with lots of explosions!)   Final thoughts:  Mildly Disappointed, yet entertained.   Grade: C+(I really hate to give this grade b/c I love SG-1 sooo much, but lets be real, it's just really not that great. Someone from Gateworld commented that this was the best story line ever for SG-1, but that makes me wonder if they ever watched any of the other time travel episodes. It's really NOT that different, if even at all. Unfortunately disappointed)
B000YMHOUS|4.0|Pleasantville is an underappreciated movie full of interesting, deep concepts hidden fairly well with subtle acting and introspective dialogue, and with not-so-subtle visual images.  In fact, the visual aspects of this movie, the blending of color with black-and-white, are incredible at times.  Seeing a black-and-white tree burst into flames is quite beautiful.  Seeing an entire town visually transform from stale black-and-white to vivid color is technically stunning.<br /><br />David (Tobey McGuire) is a modern, nerdy teenager who follows a `50s-esque show \\"Pleasanville\\", a sitcom of sorts with the shucks and darns expected during the nicest dinner at Mayberry.  It's a `50s utopia, where the men wear suits, work 9-to-5, and the women have dinner ready and ironing done promptly.  All of that changes when a TV repairman (Don Knotts) gives David a fanciful TV-remote that transports him and his sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) into the TV show.<br /><br />As a big fan of the show, David - who is now Bud - knows everything about the perfectly balanced town.  He believes in the town, and the harmonious nature with which everything works.  He knows the town is perfect, and the basketball team has never missed a shot (possibly the funniest part of the movie - SWISH! SWISH! SWISH!)  Jennifer - who is now Mary Sue - on the other hand, is a Pleasantville neophyte and none too happy about the step back in time.  In no time at all, Mary Sue has her legs wrapped around the town basketball stud Skip (Paul Walker) at Lover's Lane where she teaches him to double-dribble.  With Pandora's Box opened, the black-and-white town begins to show incredible changes: vivid colors appear out of nowhere.  With color representing change and maybe even improvement, it's up to Bud to not only maintain the status quo, but also to explain the rapid changes to the townsfolk as he tries to find a way home amidst the chaos.<br /><br />I could have done without the over-the-top racial connotation, with the town beginning a counter-rebellion against the \\"coloreds\\", and the infidelity angle was contradictory to the movie's actual message, but it's easily ignorable because of the superb acting and ground-breaking cinematography.

B0016LTNL4|2.0|This movie never failed to disappoint. It held quite a lot of promise, but little (no pun intended) of it came to fruition in this stretched almost comedy that deteriorates into a story of the effects of LSD on people's behavior. The rest of the story was not \\"traditional\\" British humor, because it would have been funny had it been so. This was predictable, sort of, in most every turn and the \\"surprise\\" guest and how it was played out was quite disappointing. The film tried and failed miserably to recreate the ambiance of \\"Four Weddings and a Funeral\\". The single funeral in the latter was better than the entirety of this film. Don't waste your time or money on this.

B0011N1WE8|5.0|This film is so enjoyable to watch. The story is of a girl who is born in a wealthy, famous family who has a curse on them that the first baby girl born will be born with a pig's nose. Christina Ricci plays Penelope, and her performance is flawless. Her character is someone you just root for the entire film, and it is so amazing that her will is so strong and her reactions to her deformity is so different than those of the people around her. I won't say more because I don't want to give too much away! But, I was not sure how I would like this movie, but I loved it. Its insipiring, and not only a fun film to watch, its also so beautiful. The art directing and the camera work are so gorgeous, and the movie has this fantasy/ fairy tale quality, while at the same time feeling modern and present-day. I would highly recommend this movie for its acting from Ricci, and Reece Witherspoon, and James McAvoy, the characters, moral, and sheer entertainment.

B00005JLWN|4.0|One of the previous reviewers wonders how this got by him (and by a lot of us).  Box Office Mojo says that the film's widest release was 301 theaters, and that it took in about $5.4 million world-wide, so it didn't get a lot of exposure.  I doubt that it returned the investiment either (though IMDB trivia says otherwise).<br /><br />This is a workmanlike film, with everybody involved giving it their best shot (with the exception of the music which sounds to me like bits left over from 1996's Broken Arrow).  The script is a genetic stew of chunks of The Matrix, 1984, Blade Runner, Fist of the North Star, and a parade of B and C films where the hero starts out as one of the trusted bad guys and gradually turns to the Resistance or the Revolution or a sexy Replicant, maybe.<br /><br />Apparently, World War III erupted early in the 21st century.  This film was released in February, 2003, according to IMDB, so I guess there's still time for things to happen in the early 21st century.  Think 'Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome' where the MC guy says '...killing got to warring, and that was almost the end of us all.'  In this world vision, negative emotion is deemed the plague that must be eliminated.  The survivors all take 'Prozium' which suppresses emtion both negative and positive.  As the man from Missouri said, 'That's a tough cob.'  Bale is John Preston,a Cleric, one of the quasi-religious police who ferret out and take down people who insist on having feelings, which seem to be associated with old paintings and rooms full of 20th century bric-a-brac.  His first partner (Sean Bean) goes over to the light side early on (think Agent D from 'Men in Black'), and Preston winds up with a new partner, the openly devious and suspicious Brandt (Taye Diggs).  Much action ensues, as Preston stops taking his Prozium (didn't Richard Corben do a graphic story where everyone took a brain pill and a bod pill?).<br /><br />If you're a devotee of these post-apocalytic action things, you will probably find this film interesting.  There are some well-stage fight scenes, particularly toward the end as Preston fights someone who has had the same training as himself.  Equilibrium is not going to make you forget The Matrix, though, certainly not the first of the trilogy (Matrix II and III are forgetable without any outside help).<br /><br />If you've read Robert Heinlein's \\"If This Goes On--\\" (aka Revolt in 2100), Equilibrium will seem very familiar to you.  Most of the forward momentum in this film is quite predictable, but I have to admit I wound up rooting for the 'sense offenders' rather than the anti-feeling Clerics (though the film cheats, allowing the supposed cold-natured anti-feelers to get happy, upset and even angry).<br /><br />Christian Bale and Taye Diggs are more than serviceable, and look for a nice performance by Angus MacFadyen (Robert the Bruce from Braveheart).  Plus, I'm still getting over Emily Watson's eyes!<br /><br />If it sounds like I'm trying to have it both ways, I am.

B000WZAE1I|5.0|... In a good way. Stardust is a brilliant movie that contains something for everyone. It is destined to be one of those movies, like The Iron Giant that does soooooo much better on DVD than in the theaters, due to a number of factors, not the least of which is poor marketing.     However, just like the Iron Giant - Stardust has, and will continue to, overcome it's poor showing at theaters and found its place on DVD.     What a film - Not often does a film genuine surprise me (mainly due to seeing and reading so many spoilers online and in magazines). All the cast members, from the leads down to the smallest parts, seem to having a great time with the material and take it seriously. I highly recommend it and know that it will be a movie that will be watched and talked about by many for years to come.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|This movie is a true masterpiece. I don't understand anyone that gives it less than 4 stars. I've watched this movie at least 6 times and I get something new out of it every single time. And, by the way, I usually hate watching any movie more than once. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are dynamite, as is the rest of the cast. Definitely one of the 10 best movies of all time.
B000006TRV|3.0|This was one of the first CDs I ever spoke, and as a teenager its anger and bitterness really spoke to me.  Now, looking back 15 years later, the music just doesn't resonate and some of it actually makes me cringe.  That's not to say you shouldn't pick it up - lots of people genuinely love this album - but that you should know what you are getting into.    In the case of The Wall, the tunes played on the radio are a fairly good representation of the album's best work.  \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\", \\"Hey You\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"The Happiest Days/Another Brick #2\\" are all enjoyable, if (to many radio listeners) played so frequently that they offer few surprises at this point.  There are a few gems hidden elsewhere - \\"Mother\\" may be the best song on the album, and \\"Nobody Home\\" is a very poignant Waters + piano + orchestra ballad.  \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" and the acoustic guitar sequence on \\"Is There Anybody Out There\\" are worth mentioning as well.    And then there are sides 2 and 4 of the original double album.  The album's key weakness is an excessive focus on lyrics over the music, and  the second half of each CD really showcase this problem.  The sequences from \\"Empty Spaces\\" to \\"Goodbye Cruel World\\" and \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" to \\"Outside the Wall\\" are, at best, boring and occasionally unlistenable.  There's a common argument from Waters critics that the songs cowritten with Gilmour are the best on the album, but that conveniently ignores the lame \\"Young Lust\\".  And \\"The Trial\\" - yikes - awful, awful, awful, even worse than \\"The Dogs of War\\".    The Wall remains enormously popular with many listeners - I think it is still Floyd's best seller after Dark Side of the Moon - and most people will enjoy it.  But it is flawed, and for those who prefer Pink Floyd's \\"head music\\" through 1975, a likely disappointment.

It has been a while since I read this book and yet much of it is fresh in my mind.  Not a beach read.  It's too deep.  A story like no other I have ever read.
B0010X745K|1.0|This movie was just a plain waste of time to watch.  Nothing scary and the ending was pitiful and totally lacked imagination.  Obviously this director has no theological knowledge and falls for the same old blah, blah, blah anti-Christian stereotypes that are so wearisome, as was evidenced by the lame character, Mrs. Carmody.  Shock value: zero, clever directing: non-existant, attempt to have a unique ending: a fizzle.  Save your money, pass on this one.  Wasn't even worth our free rental coupon!
B000VS6P9Q|4.0|i was disappointed by this after highly anticipating it. to me, sufjan never fails and was as good as expected. liked mira bilotte's song here, as well. i like many of the other artists here, but would rather listen to dylan doing dylan than most of them doing dylan. you can have my copy of the album if you want it.
B00005JPY0|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" Directed by Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />Gotham City; as per usual, things are looking pretty grim. Mob activity is at an all time high even with the work Batman has completed. There appears to be hope on the horizon however as the new D.A. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) is fearless in his pursuit of criminals everywhere and with the help of Batman has secured a witness that may break the crime ring in Gotham forever. Batman is so focused on breaking the ring that he almost overlooks a new criminal element. After all, it's only one man. However The Joker (Heath Ledger) quickly becomes a much greater concern than originally thought...<br /><br />I have to throw in with the masses on this one and say that \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a great movie. For those who weren't clued in by the title \\"The Dark Knight\\", this sequel is darker in both tone and look when compared to it's predecessor. This is a suitable environment however in which to introduce Batman's most notable nemesis the Joker.<br /><br />The Good: Great acting all around. It always seems that when a tragedy is the back-story for a movie that often times undue praise is heaped upon the victim of said tragedy. I have to say that isn't the case here. Heath Ledger left us with a masterful performance and I feel for any actor who attempts the role of the Joker in the future as he will have some big shoes to fill. Performances by Christian Bale and Aaron Eckhart shouldn't be over looked as both turned in great performances as well.<br /><br />The cinematography for this film worked for me. The darker edgier look echoed the darker themes of the movie. The special FX and action sequences were all up to par as was expected and we also get another new Bat-gadget to view.<br /><br />The Bad: The movie felt a hair long and with a running time of 152 minutes I guess that should be expected.<br /><br />Overall: Batman fans and non Batman fans alike should give this a watch. \\"The Dark Knight\\" is definitely with checking out.

0553582461|5.0|\\"Fool's Fate\\" by Robin Hobb.<br /><br />Spring has come to Buckkeep, which means the time is approaching for Prince Dutiful to start on the accepted challenge thrown down by the Narcheska Elliania. A long term peace between The Six Duchies and The Out islands hangs on the quest in which Prince Dutiful is to present the head of the Legendary Dragon Icefyre which is rumored to be frozen in a glacier on one of the Out Islands. FitzChilcalry as always, works tirelessly, unseen by most for the interest of the crown. Our reluctant hero FitzChilvary juggles too many tasks while tripping over stumbling blocks, many of which are self imposed, in both his profession and personal life as he attempts to help the Prince fulfill his mission...<br /><br />Robin Hobb has done it again! \\"Fool's Fate\\" is the culmination of two trilogies about FitzChivalry and for those who have been following along, all of your questions will be answered, well, almost all of them. This is probably one of the best out of all of the FitzChivalry books. For those who enjoy the story of Fitz and Hobb's writing style, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The Good: As with all of Hobb's books, her writing is what sells it. It isn't typically the story overall that sells a Hobb book; it is the way in which she tells it. All of the unanswered questions you had from the earlier books regarding storylines and characters that Fitz had relationships with, will for the most part be concluded in one way or another. The personal aspect that you feel about the Fitz character and his relationships with others is one of the aspects of his tale that is so intriguing to me and that we finally see how it all ends up is what put \\"Fool's Fate\\" at the top of the FitzChivalry books for me.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: If you are a Fan of Hobb or of the FitzChivalry tale then pick this up immediately!
0385340567|3.0|Former Army MP Jack Reacher has metaphorically traveled the road from hope to despair many times. In Colorado, while on his way to San Diego, Reacher has the opportunity to do it in a physical sense as he has found both towns and the 12 miles of road that separate the two. It is a straight two lane road running between the two towns that serves to separate two locations that could not be further apart in terms of style, pleasantness of the population, or anything. Hope's part of the highway consists of thick dark asphalt rolled smooth. Despair used hot tar and dumped grey gravel on it. Reacher plans walking to Despair, having a cup of coffee and then will be back on his way either by foot or by catching a ride if he can get lucky.<br /><br />He never intended to stay because he was just passing through and taking the shortest way between two points. Reacher would have left the folks of Despair alone if they had left him alone. They didn't. Four locals want him gone for no good reason that Reacher can understand. They make the mistake of messing with Reacher and suffer the painful consequences. Now they have given Reacher a reason to stick around and poke into their business until he finally exposes the secrets they have hidden for years.<br /><br />This latest installment, number twelve in a series that began with the incredible good \\"Killing Floor\\" is not Lee Child's best work. This novel, much like Reacher who is constantly walking back and forth between the two towns when he isn't romancing a local cop just a little, is a plodding read that goes the distance but nowhere fast. The Reacher character was substantially fleshed out sometime ago and as such there isn't anything new to discover and report. If anything, after recent events this is a Reacher that, while he says the right things about helping others and doing the right things when needed has a thicker distance to him now that wasn't present earlier in the series.<br /><br />Also apparent is a flatness to the writing.  Part of that is due to the described starkness of the landscape as well as the constant and detailed plodding trips between the two towns. This novel has a certain apocalyptic feel to it as the world in general compresses down to this small area of Colorado where information is scarce and the threats are huge and come in many forms. Despair is a company town and as such exists for one reason only much like the towns in novels of the future where genetic, biological, chemical, nuclear, or some other horror have laid waste to everything and nearly all of humanity. The landscape is harsh, the people unfriendly, and deep dark secrets exist that grow worse short chapter after short chapter.<br /><br />The flatness to the writing extends to the comments Reacher makes regarding the military and service. Even after Reacher lectures the reader on how the military knows in these times what the politicians are up to and believes that the politicians have broken the implied contract between the military and the people, there is a lack of passion in the arguments. Instead, this piece and several other commentaries along these lines in the latter pages of the novel are all without any passion or zest. These comments which don't have enough passion in them to be termed \\"rants\\" are completely out of character for Reacher and do not fit the actions of a character well known to readers. While cynicism in a character as he or she ages is nothing new, or in the author for that matter, one expects such situations to be explained and that is not done here. Instead, Reacher offers opinions flatly and with little emotion as if by saying these things it won't matter anyway because nothing will change. Implied is the question--why bother?<br /><br />Something quite a few readers may well ask themselves at the end of this one. It is a very long way to go for the final seventy pages or so that pound forward as only a Reacher book can and provide an enjoyable and suspenseful finishto the book. This isn't the best in the series by a long shot and has fundamental flaws for this reader. It is by that series standard, set long ago, that this novel falls a bit short. In a lesser writer, the work would be thought better by comparison. A weak Jack Reacher novel is better by a long shot than a lot of other books out there these days.<br /><br />Kevin R.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Truely the best show on TV.  You get to experience a trip back 48 years. A time where people still had fun, drinking at work, smoking all the time, dipping into the secretarial pool.  True quality in every detail from office settings, home furnishings, to clothing styles.  You can't be dissapointed with this show! The acting from all the cast is fantastic and I especially enjoy seeing the mighty attractive characters (Betty & Joan)!     The show can transport me back to a time in the country I never experienced but wish I did. It is a true pleasure to watch these characters portray real people from that time period. Those who didn't always take life so serious (some of them anyway), could laugh and not have to worry about offending someone, drink and smoke and no one tried to make them feel like a criminal.  Ahh, when a tv show can make you feel like you were there, that says it all.

B0013FU4SE|5.0|Sarah Waters has produced yet another Victorian adventure in creating \\"Fingersmith\\".<br /><br />Any explanation of the plot would betray some of the plot points and twists. I will stay away from spoiling the fun of reading through this exceptional novel.<br /><br />Sarah Waters has a talent for portraying many aspects of women in a way that brings them alive in her novels. Her characters are more than mere stereotypes. Some might describe them as \\"flawed.\\" Compared to T.V. heroines, perhaps they are flawed, however, a better way to describe her central characters is to say that they are multi-dimensional and believable. Many of the characters develope from backgrounds and circumstances to which all of us can relate and appreciate.<br /><br />After a few plot twists, Sarah Waters' heroine finds herself to be a talented \\"fingersmith\\". A fingersmith is a Victorian term for a \\"pick-pocket\\" or thief.<br /><br />From these common beginnings, much in the way of her first heroine in Tipping the Velvet: A Novel her \\"everywoman\\" heroine in \\"Fingersmith\\" encounters one adventure after another to find herself in a plot twist of intrigue involving another woman. Although this is not as as sensual as her first novel: Tipping the Velvet, \\"Fingersmith\\" provides a rich ambience of romance and tenderness between the women.<br /><br />The writing is superb, with concise but fluid descriptions of 19th. Century England, and, the personalities we've come to savor from Ms. Waters.<br /><br />DO see the BBC production of this engaging novel! Fingersmith
1594489505|4.0|I had a difficult time reading \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" because of the dull sense of horror I couldn't shake throughout the book.  Hosseini does a perfect job of putting the reader in the shoes of his characters, and in much of this novel that is an uncomfortable place to be.<br /><br />An incredible message of human perseverence under the most crushing and awful of conditions, I couldn't help but feel discouraged at the end of the novel.  Afghanistan again slipping into the tribal and religious war described in the book, while Americans sit safe at home without a clue as to what some people face on a daily basis.<br /><br />This is an excellent book for anyone who is interested in peeking into this far off land of Afghanistan, and the trials it has and continues to experience.  Well written, well paced, one can almost enjoy this book inspite of the horrors described on every page.
B00125WAWS|2.0|This was a beautifully filmed movie with a good message and great acting especially by those portraying the students. However, I have not been so disappointed in seeing a beautiful, meaningful movie lose credibility by underestimating its audience since watching Prairie Giant (The movie about the life of the founder of universal health care in Canada - Tommy Douglas.)      What I don't like to find out after watching such an emotionally gripping tale whose aim is to depict truth and fight injustice is that the filmmakers have been loose with the truth and have been unjust in their misappropriating credit to the wrong University.     Harvard never extended the Wiley Debate team an invitation to their University, instead it was the University of southern California. To me, finding this out after watching the movie spoilt the movie for me. To say a prestigious University extended a grace-filled invitation in order that a modern audience could see the mammoth achievement that the students from Wiley accomplished is an insult to the intelligence of the modern audience. If the filmmakers had wanted to show that debating U of SC was a fine achievement - they could have set the stage so that we would have understood the significance of that debate in that era and at the same time held true to history and gave the kudos the University that really made the step towards a more racially harmonious America.      The filmmakers should have cut all ties with reality and made this story a fictional morality tale - for then it truly would have been a masterpiece.

The story reads the same.  Like you can't put it down even though it is a lot of pages.  All the better, because it makes it last!  I enjoyed the descriptions of the food thay ate, the clothes they wore, living conditions etc, etc.    Now I am waiting for another sequel.  There is a lot of English history to write about.  Mr. Follett could really make it interesting.
0385340567|1.0|I've read and enjoyed every Jack Reacher novel, and wait expectantly for each new release.  Not anymore.  I felt this story was slapped together, and actually boring.  Far too much time was spent traveling back and forth between two fictional towns, the action was tiresome, and the characters seemed shallow.  Reacher took on his lawless revenge action with far too little reason, against characters I just couldnt care about.    Even if this hadn't turned into a sudden political twist for the character, with Reacher expressing heroic praise for Army deserters, this book left me feeling betrayed.  I tip my hat to a series that I enjoyed very much, but I don't expect ever to buy another.    So long Jack.
B000FBJHZS|1.0|This is book is a great example of how sometimes good writers are lost in the twists and turns of their own work. The book starts with a great promise, but ends rather anticlimactically. The main character Rachel seems quite confused as she, in the first 95% of the novel, is risks her life to get evidence of the truth and spends last 5% of the novel trying to hide the same evidence. She starts with philosophy of 'having no assumptions only evidence' but at the end accepts the innocence of one party without any proof. Even though most of the book is interesting the end is disappointing.
B0011WMHRK|5.0|Can, while not as bizarre as a few of their contemporaries, Faust comes to mind - put together some astonishingly good rock with their talented Japanese lyrical improviser Damo Suzuki.<br /><br />My favorite piece is \\"Oh Yeah\\" which opens with the sound of a thunderstorm, and the growing rhythm of the drums with organ overlay. The song is a rather long one, and goes through 3 shifts in sound, and subtle tensions. There's also a very fun video of it in YouTube replete with vaudeville style juggler.<br /><br />the later part of the album has some more of the throbbing \\"experimental\\" aspects to it, with delayed instruments, and heavily distorted vocal bits. IT's very hypnotic and for some may be a bit unnerving.<br /><br />Can and several of the other Krautrock bands were way ahead with their disassembly of pop-rock music, and merging it to free jazz improv. I don't know of anything else like them - their brand was special.

B0013POLS8|4.0|I have only watched a tiny bit of this Blu Ray.  So far, it has lived to its hype.  My wife have seen the entire thing and the reason why I didn't gave it a five star is I compared it to Celine Dion's A New Day Blu Ray.  This does not have the behind the scenes like Celine does.  Other than that, the concert is great (based from the bits and pieces of what I've seen).
B001AHM2C6|5.0|First off Hans Zimmers music is very easy to identify. His music is filled was darkness, passion and epicness unlike anything you have ever heard. The Dark Knight Limited Edition is a must own. Each track has it's own level of awesomeness and evokes alot of deep emotions while listening. My personal favorite is \\"Like a Dog Chasing Cars\\" hehe. That track will get you pumped up! Turn the bass up on that one and blast your stero. It's a rip roaring hardcore track that gives justice to a beloved legend we all know......Batman!    If your a Batman fan or a fan of Hans Zimmers work, don't miss this one.
B0013FBTHO|5.0|I bought this HD DVD version as I cannot wait for the Blu Ray version to arrive.  Watching this in hidef is definitely a must.  This has a great storyline.  Will Smith did a great job on this movie.  I highly recommend this to anyone, especially the hidef version.

0618918248|4.0|Richard Dawkin's latest book, \\"The GOD Delusion\\" is a must read for everyone. Theist or Atheist, believer or non-believer, Dawkin's has, for the first time, placed the complete set of arguments about the existence (or non-existence as he would prefer) of God, into a single place for easy reference during after dinner conversation. Not withstanding his relentless negative and somewhat emotional attacks on the believer, his arguments and counter arguments are well written and within easy grasp of all. If you can read this book and maintain your own level minded perspective you will be in strong possession of significant knowledge to either impress your dinner guests or perhaps upset them to the point of keeping them from ever coming to your house again -- if that is your wish. In the end, based on the comprehensive research he has provided, either perspective can still be argued, although he has clearly stated that he is trying to convert believers to his side -- but he has missed the best and perhaps newest argument due to a lack of evidence.<br /><br />Most of his arguments are old, 19th century as he has been accused, but never quite understood why. And most contemporary believers have reconciled their faith with the natural science of the day. However, he has one new intriguing thread with regard to the origin of religion and he pulls on it, but he freely admits it is arguably one of perhaps many threads that could have caused the human brain to develop religious beliefs as a bi-product of selecting for other things pertinent to survival, or whatever was deemed important during the selection process. And this thread bumps up against something far more important than religion -- It cries forth with the question of human consciousness and it's evolutionary development -- a.k.a. Julian Jaynes. Alas Dawkins never crosses fully into the pursuit of consciousness and it's potential origins leaving us to wonder if Jaynes was a genius or a quack -- I wonder why? If you prove consciousness is an illusion than absolutely you have proven there is no God. He has unfortunately shied away from this subject. It is the substance necessary to create not just artificial life but artificial intelligence. A subject he never addresses -- although he poignantly relays the tragic end to Alan Turing, the father of AI, for a completely different reason.<br /><br />More important to his writings, however, is his insistence that it is the believer who is suffering from a delusion, when it is just as clear that he suffers from some sort of emotional discontinuity, perhaps paranoia, that propels his own delusions about what is and what is not true religious faith. So here Dawkin's labors away, trifling with the Almighty, a personal God or natural selection -- no one should really care since both belief in the Almighty or the processes of natural selection are far stronger than Richard Dawkins. Regardless of what they may believe during the good times, during the dark of night, or on their death bed, does not change the fact that the universe is really really big, perhaps infinite, and he is far from unlocking its ultimate secrets -- something he freely admits in the end. The secrets that he hopes to find, keep slipping through his fingers as the universe keeps expanding and the smallest building blocks of matter keep turning back into something that he cannot quite grasp. Yet the curiosity of science propels him forward in his quest -- with such conviction to know or finally know, that there is no God. This is clearly a crusade of sorts for Dawkin's, yet he maintains that he is an atheist. Somewhere in Chapter 2 though he rates himself a level 6 agnostic -- allowing for a very very small possibility that there actually is a God. Or else he couldn't continue his quest, it wouldn't make logical sense. So he too, has a disconnect. By allowing himself a brief, if not unconsciously repressed uncertainty, about the meaning of life enables him to go on his atheistic crusade -- mimicking all of the same characteristics of religion that he so soundly criticizes. I find this ironic.<br /><br />Second, if social behavior including morals and values actually evolved as he suggests, including religion, then these things are hard wired into our physiology. They are firmware, not software, which makes them real. And no matter what delusion he thinks believers are suffering from -- he goes to quite some extent to explain why these actions are real and necessary -- believers, therefore, are not suffering from anything false. They do what they do because they are supposed to. They are behaving as their creator, designer, or natural selector would have them behave...hence reality, no matter whose side you are on. Again, ironic.<br /><br />Dawkins most significant contribution to society, though this particular book, however, has nothing at all to do with God or religion. It has to do with the abuse of young minds. His stance should be every parent's stance and the brainwashing of young minds in ways that would damage their mental develoment is indeed problematic. Religion, no religion, God, or no God, we do not have the right to lie to our children in ways that would torment or terrorize their thoughts. Particularly in ways that would fundamentally alter the way they brains are developing -- at least before the age of eight or nine. To do otherwise would be the same as altering their bodies physically for instance, the heinous binding of a young girl's feet in certain countries. Dawkin's carries this topic quite well -- but I'm not sure why it's in this particular book.-- mimicking all of the same characteristics of religion that he so soundly criticizes.

0393324818|5.0|The first time I read this book I couldn't put it down from start to finish -- it was the book on the business of baseball that I had been waiting for but it was written in a narrative that draws you in, first to Billy Beane, then to the Oakland A's, then to the plight of baseball today.<br /><br />In the years since I read this, many have cited Moneyball while building their franchises but have come to realize Beane is some sort of baseball divining rod.<br /><br />Brilliant book if you are at all interested in a unique way of looking at baseball -- and management -- you won't see either the same way ever again.

He says what everyone wishes they could say -- not a single filter -- and gets away with it.<br /><br />What you get in this memoir is a deep understanding of how to excel at your job -- be passionate about what you do, commit to what you do and then, simply, do it with conviction.<br /><br />Ramsay is to cooking what Tiger Woods is to golf -- a unique and talented guy who brings unbelievable attention from the non-culinary crowd to his business.

0385340567|1.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed the previous Jack Reacher books so it was with a combination of sadness, disappointment and even anger to read Nothing to Lose.  Rather than growing, the Reacher character seems to be devolving into an even more neanderthalish low-rent Travis McGee wandering the land and doing serious damn-damns on those who cross him.  Halfway through this book I realized that I no longer Liked the Jack Reacher character and couldn't care less how the book turned out.  The plot is seriously improbable and lacks only the main antagonist (the old right-wing business tycoon crossed with a End Times christian fundamentalist) hovering over our hero and guiding a laser between his legs.  The way this series is going, it won't be too many more books before Reacher takes on an even twelve, count 'em folks, UFC heavyweights and, of course, cleans their clocks big time.  Save your money but most importantly, save your time and pass this one by.  And besides, the comic book version is sure to be out any time.

0670018651|5.0|I expected a light, dumb read.  What I got was the most hilarious and thought-provoking book I've read in the last five years.  They explain the technicalities of the subject as directly and patiently as your favorite high school teacher, but the reviews are acidic and laugh-out-loud funny (My friends are sick to death of me calling them to read them passages.).  When you consider how intimately scent is linked to both attraction and memory, it's amazing that so little attention is paid to it.  It amazes me how little attention I'VE paid to it.  I bought this book less than two months ago and I've read it twice and refer to it almost daily.  I've read in a couple places that they might be starting a newsletter or magazine of some sort.  It would be a shame if they didn't.
0790731002|3.0|Batman Forever is the only Batman that Val Kilmer portrayed as the Dark Knight. He is pretty good but the director refused to work with him again because of his attitude? I think all actors have an attitude problem? Nicole Kidman plays the new vixen in Bruce Wayne's life, she's kinda wooden in this, these blonde bombshell roles don't fit her. Jim Carrey is a hoot as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones is surprisely entertaining as well. Good colorful film but the hyper style comedy is a little too much.

The extended version of \\"Out of time\\" and additional tracks \\"What to do\\" and \\"Take it or leave it\\" are worth the buy. This album demonstrates a transition of The Stones to a unique English style that infusses blues,folk,pop,progressive and dark themes, which paved the way for modern music.

While I was in college, I was always provided with very clean code bases to work with or analyze. I was in for a huge surprise when I entered the real world. The code I deal with every day at work is an extremely ugly mess. We have no automated tests. We are basically operating at CMMI level 0. There are no clear coding conventions of any kind. People just kind of band-aid things on top of other band-aids just to make the new changes work. We are basically in emergency mode every day because of all of the ugly side effects of global variables and functions. I was presented this book one day by my company news website. So I grabbed a copy and gave it a chance.    I was very satisfied with this book. I was expecting to start reading this and it would be like one of those GoF (Gang of Four) or Martin Fowler books that already assume that your code is already written fairly well in the first place. The reality is, like others have said here, is that most companies you will work for will just not have the prettiest code base in the world. The book's content is fabulous and I can see this being one of the key books on my desk every day. I absolutely love how pragmatic Michael Feathers is. I like how he continuously explains the concept that sometimes the code might look uglier or awkward in order to get it under test. I always thought the design pattern books were just a bit over the top. Michael is not like that. He provides examples you probably run into everyday and provides succinct steps for getting it under test.    The only gripe that I have with this book is the overwhelming amount of publishing errors throughout the book. Sometimes, a word is skipped in a sentence or the wrong word is obviously used. There was one point in the book I recall where it seemed like it was missing the ending of a sentence or something. I think if Michael ever wants another edition of this book then he ought to hire someone new that will catch all of these little glitches and correct them. They were a bit annoying at times. Also, like someone else said, it would've been nice to see some examples of really old code in COBOL or FORTRAN even.    Otherwise, it is easy to read this book and you'll get through it fairly quickly. There have been some technical books I have read where I just couldn't read it all the way through because of how utterly boring it was. Michael keeps you entertained with some rather interesting concepts and stories. I also like the way he formatted the book in general. I like how many of the chapters in the book are titled by some problem like \\"These API Calls Are Killing Me!\\" However, the last chapter called \\"Refactoring\\" was a bit vague and odd to me especially since all it discussed was his infamous \\"Extract Method\\" refactoring.    I really wish all of the developers on this team would read this book. They really need to. We need to stop this game of changing and guessing whether it worked. You just cannot do that with software unless it is very small. Any software engineer should have this book on their desk.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Not enough of this Show, not enough time to realize the show was even there and definitely Not Enough Advertising to let anyone know it existed...What is wrong with the \\"Powers That BE\\"? They will advertise a Crappy show to death, but a good show gets canceled before it gets noticed...that's just Wrong! Firefly and the follow-up Movie Serenity are AMAZING!!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what's next, who is the Blue Sun Corporation? What is the whole story with \\"Shepherd\\", who was he before? What happened to make him don a collar? How much can \\"River\\" really do? What's gonna happen with \\"Mal & Inara\\"? Will \\"Jayne\\" find a woman who becomes part of the crew? Will \\"Simon & Kaylee\\" have Kids? The possibilities are endless...Except for the \\"Idiots that Be\\" who thought it was a Smart thing to do when they canceled it. The deaths of \\"Wash & Shepherd\\" can be worked around, I mean look at \\"Dallas\\" or for that matter it could have been a story that anyone of the characters could have been telling someone. It could all be worked out!!! ANYWAY...my ramblings aside, it is a Fantastic Show that needs another chance...NOW! I am so glad I rented the DVD \\"Serenity\\" or I would never have gone searching for answers and then found \\"Firefly\\" - I Love This Show!!!
B0013D8LOK|2.0|I was quite surprised when I arrived at this website to review SWEENEY TODD and saw how many wonderful reviews have been garnered by the film.  Hence, the title above.<br /><br />The movie has been out for several months so much of Mr. Burton's distinctive style was expected. However, little was found to recommend it other than some of the performances of the supporting cast (bravo Misters Rickman and Cohen). The overall product did not work for me.  As a rule, I'm a huge fan of musicals--and, of course, Mr. Strondheim--but the action seemed largely contrived and one dimensional which made it difficult for me to care or relate to much of the storyline.  I'm usually a huge Johnny Depp fan--and I think he did about everything with the role that could be done--but his performance could not salvage the movie.  I felt Helena Bonham Carter, a superb actress, was miscast.<br /><br />The premise and dark theme of the production has never tempted me to see it on the stage.  This is not to say that I avoid any musical not possessing the MARY POPPINS \\"fluff factor\\".  However, at the risk of appearing anachronistic, I just didn't perceive much entertainment value--any more than I would Manson's life being put to music.

Juno is faced with the task of trying to decide whether to have an abortion or give her unborn child up for adoption. But ends up deciding to give up her baby for adoption and goes about finding the perfect parents to adopt her unborn child.    Juno Macguff isn't your average teenage beauty involved in sports, cheerleading & so on... She's into music and is funny in a dry/witty/dark humor kind of way.... Ellen Page plays the character perfectly and is in fact, the best actor in the movie! I think Ellen Page will remain on the acting scene for a long time with her talent.    Anyway, \\"Juno\\" is definitely a different sort of coming of age story and a good one at that.

0446677450|1.0|This book is very simplistic.  It would be like getting a book on how to become a brain surgeon that tells you to go to college and major in pre-med then go to medical school and then specialize in surgery.    It is not offensive but it is too lacking in real information to be helpful.  There are no secrets methods to get rich in this book.    I doubt that rich people are reading books on how to get rich.  I think they are busy doing what it takes to get rich.
B000DZIGDU|3.0|I rented this one last night, expecting a typical war story.  What I got was something else entirely.  This is the movie adaptation of the autobiographical book of the same name by Anthony Swofford about his experiences in the Marines during the first Gulf War.  As a former military guy myself from that era, I was initially drawn into the story because I could relate to Swofford's introduction into military life at boot camp.  It was a scene familiar to anyone with armed forces experience.  Unfortunately, the movie went downhill from there.<br /><br />As the story traces Swofford's short military career through his garrison time and into Desert Shield, there remains an aura of credibility, although frankly some of the behavior depicted by the servicemen began to stretch the limits of what was believable based on what I knew of military life.  As Desert Shield drags on for months, the focus shifts to the emotional and psychological toll of wartime inactivity, which admittedly is more pronounced among sex-starved young men who know nothing but loneliness and boredom.  Even so, these scenes become exaggerated and even caricatured by the onset of the Desert Storm phase.<br /><br />Finally, the theme moves on to the futility and senselessness of war from the perspective of the average grunt on the ground.  Again, there was some familiarity here for one who had lived through eight years of often nonsensical and contradictory military culture.  However, some of the Marines' responses simply didn't jive with the reality of their circumstances, or reflect fairly on the immense professionalism that characterizes the modern U.S. military, both now and during the early 90s when this story takes place.<br /><br />Oddly enough, for a \\"war movie\\" this had almost no violence in it whatsoever.  It is much more of a character study and a psychological inquiry into the nature of young men trained to fight and kill.  It renders an indictment of high-level military leadership which, while true, is also one-sided.  In short, this story offers up heavy doses of both reality and exaggeration, and it is up to the viewer to try to sort out which is which.  For people with military experience that shouldn't be too hard, but others will likely walk away with a distorted view of our armed forces.ed.

0143038419|5.0|[[ASIN:0615181619 Conquer My Heart]] Eat Pray Love meltdown for the wealthy<br />I admit this is an interesting book.  A wealthy woman who was the main support in a marriage decided she no longer wanted to be married.  Caught in between the lines were two primary reasons for the divorce decision.  She really did not want to be a mother.  She was tired of being the primary income.  As my own daughter put it, tired of being the cheerleader.<br />I feel empathy for the woman.  In this the current global society a woman choosing not to be a mother is nothing short of a death sentence.  Only one of a million doctors will agree to a tubal ligation for a married woman choosing not to have a child.  The only recourse is divorce and using divorce as an excuse for celibacy.  One could choose to be a nun, but I'm not so certain that celibacy is a real part of convents and or parishes.<br />The second reason, tired of being a cheerleader is another reason for society to rear its ugly head.  A punishment was swift and it was.  All of her wealth was taken away by the ex husband (male) and attorney, and judicial system.<br />I like this book because it actually shows the common belief that only men are raped and pillaged by the courts, but women are more brutalized by the court system.  Here is another sore spot with me that this book brought to the fore.  I read an article that men do not want to marry because they do not want children and they do not want the wife to take their income and wealth.  Here is the rub; this was acceptable reasoning for men not to marry.  Personally I believe that the man or woman that did not want children should be allowed to have medical procedures that would take care of the problem.  As for the woman taking wealth or in this case a man taking wealth, when are people going to understand that marriage is not about wealth?  Marriage is not even about selfish happiness.  Elizabeth Gilbert touched on this when finally; it does generally occur in most women eventually, that this love and lust courtship is the poorest foundation for a marital state.  When families were involved in the marital state of children the results were usually better.  I am not talking about a simple business agreement.  I am discussing an intricate study of finances, future finances, checks and balances with necessary requirements of both man and woman brought into the union, and study of astrological charts and tendencies.<br />I loved the ending.  Gilbert choose a man that had determined he no longer wanted children and wanted a woman that did not want children.  The lust between them was currently enough to unite in a relationship but not the legal binding of union.  Way to go and hearty hip hip hoorays!  I truly desire such a happy relationship and to hell with the scowls of society.<br />I did not get the eating in Italy part.  I lived in India some thirty years ago and it was near an ashram.  I understood the India and prayer part.  I understood the Bali love part.  She discovered that although society frowns on the no children and no cheerleader relationship she found and accepted it with a person in Bali.  I find it funny that in Bali where society is more rigid and frowning she realized the happiness she had set out to find.<br />Here is one glitch the reader should be aware of.  Although 99.9% of the world population suffers from meltdowns, only .1% can take off a year of their life and conduct a pilgrimage.  Gilbert's pilgrimage is only for the wealthy.  Gilbert's pilgrimage method is not for any of us.<br />The need for the pilgrimage is a part of 99.9% of us.  What we can learn from this book is that it does touch a lot of us.  I feel strongly that this book is a call for help in society.<br />We need to readdress marriage as a concept today.  Our society needs to accept that all of us do not need to be married.  We need to accept that some men and women do not want children and should be allowed to medically take care of reproduction without problem or condemnation.  These couples should be allowed to engage in relationships without constrictions of legality called marriage and without condemnation.  If a man or woman wants reproduction, let them seek out same minded people.  If an agreement of reproduction exists then further investigate the acceptability of finances, future, and wealth.<br />In conclusion, this is an interesting book.  It is a recommend read.  The book opens recognition when it touches the reader intimately.  The book definitely opens discussions on takes from the content in book clubs.condemnation.

B000W4KSVA|4.0|John Coltrane recorded a number of three-song records for Impulse around this time, so this set of eight ballads stands out.  The songs are pretty short, and the CD itself is less than 33 minutes long.  Coltrane recorded this with his classic quartet, and being ballad work, highlights McCoy Tyner.  The songs themselves are all pretty good -- the melodies get played fairly straight, then there's some soloing, and things wrap up pretty quickly.  Being John Coltrane, it's pretty good, but he doesn't sound like he's really going for it on this record.  Coltrane fans will want this, eventually, though you might want to get the more adventurous stuff first, depending on which side of John Coltrane is your favorite.

0679746323|4.0|Hitler, Stalin, Mao--of the three towering totalitarian dictators of the 20th century, Mao Tse Tung has always been considered the most benign. Darling of western leftists, Warholian pop icon, the \\"people's\\" chairman, Mao has long been a symbol for many who had absolutely no idea of the reality he represented.<br /><br />In *Mao: the Unknown Story,* authors Chang and Halliday seek to correct the misperception. They portray Mao as a cold, cruel, asocial nihilist who believed in nothing--nothing, that is, except for Mao. Communism was merely a vehicle to achieving the power and privilege that Mao sought in what he considered a strictly material existence--the point of which was to personally appropriate as much material as possible. \\"When a man is dead,\\" Mao reasoned, \\"what does he care about his reputation?\\"<br /><br />So he'd hardly care about the conclusions Chang and Halliday advance in this scathing biography. The authors seem determined to re-establish the balance thrown off by decades of ignorance, silence, and oppression--all of which have contributed to a pseudo-heroic view of Mao. Chang and Halliday's evident \\"agenda\\" unfortunately give their book a less than objective feel--as if they felt it necessary to pile upon Mao as much dirt as possible. Mao, in these authors view, does absolutely nothing right, or for any good reason, and is virtually void of any decent motivation whatsoever. Their account is a bit like watching a prosecuting attorney giving an entirely one-sided and negative interpretation to the evidence with the sole intention of convicting the accused. There's hardly any doubt that Mao is guilty--but one can't help but feel that he's got at least a few arguments to make in his defense.<br /><br />Mao's improbable rise to power makes for fascinating reading. He basically became a communist because as a young schoolteacher the Party would pay him a stipend to recruit members. Mao seems to have gone about this task a lot like an un-enterprising girl scout might sell cookies--by signing up members of his family to be communists but almost no one else! From there Mao rose through the ranks primarily by doing the opposite of whatever he was ordered or agreed previously to do. His favorite modus operandi seemed to be one of a number of variations of \\"I didn't get that memo.\\" Time and time again Mao claimed that messages were lost, orders were misunderstood, phone calls disconnected. He simply \\"disappeared\\" whenever it was convenient, and then popped up again after whatever self-serving antic had become a fait accompli.<br /><br />The famous Long March? -it was all a tragic sham, according to the authors, in which Mao led his followers on a wild goose chase like a crafty Moses who knew very well where he was supposed to be going but purposely took the longest most disastrous route possible to eliminate his competition and consolidate his own power. He was going to make sure that when he entered the Promised Land it would be as king. For Mao, 90% of the population was unnecessary, expendable, a point he made time and again when discussing the perfectly--in his view--option of all-out nuclear war.<br /><br />From Mao's birth to his wretched death of Lou Gehrig's disease, it's all here--the purges and great leaps, the civil wars and cultural wars, the super-secret nuclear weapons programs and politically-induced famines, the Nixon/Kissinger visits on-stage and behind-the-scenes--and all of it recounted in a briskly paced, mesmerizing, almost novelistic narrative.<br /><br />While it often seems one-sided and as if the authors, especially Ms. Chang, have a personal ax to grind with the chairman, *Mao* must nonetheless be considered essential reading at this point in understanding the rise and regime of Mao Tse Tung. Other more balanced books will probably pop up in its wake, but for now this one establishes an important and much-needed corrective to the popular view of a dictator all too often regarded as one of the champions of humanity's underdogs.
B000RZGIQ8|3.0|Recently released on Region A Blu-Ray, I watched this film again for the first time in several years.    Top Gun is not a movie that has aged well - particularly since release the novelty of seeing F14's in close combat and training exercises has been overtaken by flight sim games that let you do it yourself and the CNN/Discovery Channel imagery of real warfare in Desert Storm etc. Despite the premise that \\"Top Gun\\" teaches close air warfare, the real military doctrine is to avoid closing within gun range in the first place and rely on \\"Beyond Visual Range\\" methods to engage the enemy. If that fails, evade or retreat to save the plane (and pilot) to fight another day.     The plot and dialogue seems even more camp, cliched and dated than even just a few years ago, not surprising as they have been lampooned to death. Stand out cliche has got to be \\"Goose\\" - who really has disposable-comic-relief written on his forehead from the first scene.    I seriously doubt that any pilot with the attitude problem and disregard for orders that Maverick displays, would in reality be allowed anywhere near a Navy jet.    Focus on the flying scenes and make the tea when the cringeworthy romance interludes or oiled bare 'pecs are on. It's more camp than Priscilla, Queen of the Desert...    Three stars really for the cult classic status and the crystal clear Blu-Ray picture and sound but it's not hard to see why they never made a sequel. If you want a more realistic, down to earth story about naval aviation watch \\"Flight of the Intruder\\" - a much better movie.

6305308659|5.0|I can't believe I missed this classic.     Turning the overused and predictable time-travel concept on its head, Pleasantville aims extremely high, posing the mother of all existential questions - would we do it the same way if given a chance to re-write our own history? With the exception of some very leaden sixties revisionism, the answer is ingenious and thought provoking.    Living in the highly sexualized, single-parented miasma of pre-Y2K suburbia, teenagers David and Jennifer Wagner (Tobey Maguire & Reese Witherspoon) find themselves transported into a 1950's sitcom called Pleasantville that quickly becomes their black and white purgatory of Eisenhower-era rectitude.     The re-creation of Pleasantville in its original, sinless state is pitch perfect. Breakfast consists of waffles, pancakes and ham steaks slathered in butter and piled sky high with trans-fat be damned glee. The High School experience is completely asexual with the most pressing academic and social concerns being term papers mining the origins of the local fire house and who is getting \\"pinned\\" at the big dance. To complete the post card, the local barber dispenses platitudes, the basketball team always wins and the aforementioned firefighters do nothing but rescue cats in trees - all locked in a serene, soulless contentment.    In the middle of this sit-com stereotype come David and Jennifer (now Bud and Mary Sue) who in addition to finding a way out, have to cope with their on-screen parents, George and Betty (great performances by William H. Macy and Joan Allen) and their own personal awakening as they live within the suffocating sterility of their all-to-real, scripted surroundings.     Fed up with the cynicism of his life in the 1990s, Bud's original thought is to completely embrace the simplicity of the town and adapt his behavior to the morality and expecations as they currently exist. As a counterpoint, Mary Sue's vision is to bring the \\"enlightenment\\" of modern vice to Pleasantville at every opportunity - both siblings causing objects and characters to spontaneously transition from black and white to color as the revelations about the nature of themselves and their fictional society \\"corrupts\\" their friends and neighbors.    Despite their best (or worst intentions) the entire moral and social fabric of the town very quickly unravels creating \\"white\\"  versus \\"colored\\" anarchy that in very short order breeds a backlash of knee-jerk censorship, town-hall mobs, blacklisting, random book-burnings, adultery, attempted rape and just for good measure, the Suffragetting of \\"traditional\\" gender roles. The clear, underlying message being that whatever the fall-out or unintended consequences, Man's pursuit of knowledge should be secular, unerring and absolute - very directly taking to task what they perceive as the soft, conformist, underbelly of most organized religions.     For both good and bad, Pleasantville is the Book of Genesis as it might be told by Norman Lear or Bill Maher - Enlightement is both vaccine and contagion - all Nirvana is essentially a conservative falsehood with Original Sin denoting the rise of Man rather than his fall.    A very heady chaser to wash down your multiplex nachos - and the perfect date movie - if you happen to be dating Alanis Morissette.     That being said, my only substantial criticism of the film, as a film,  is that the avalanche of dysfunction that dominates the second half seemed far too neat and contrived in the service of the film's glaring progressive themes - and came very close to overwhelming the best efforts of a stellar, ensemble cast. However, even against this backdrop (and a few gaping plot holes) Pleasantville remains a very powerful, poignent and beautiful film especially given the bold aspirations of the premise.     As for the technicals, Pleasantville showcases some extraordinary sfx and cinematography, a brilliant score by Randy Newman and the return of the late, great Don Knotts to theatrical filmaking in a surprisingly robust role - nothing wrong with that.     While I am not sure if I would enjoy living in any version of Pleasantville - the town certainly makes a \\"swell\\" day trip - take it!
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Wow, pretty funny negative reviews.    The packaging was an attempt to be eco-friendly, and I for one liked it. The unnecessary packaging of most DVDs makes them look like, and take up the space of, books, and this is pretentious as well as being a waste of resources. Movies aren't as important as books.    The American west really was a Potemkin village and there were, details at eleven, very few houses especially in California where you could live rough most of the year, and most people didn't have enough money to buy a house. Then as now, as it turns out in the new Depression, most of us scratch to survive. Details at eleven.    People in America then as now really do say howdy and punch or shoot each other. Some do it with their fists some do it with a gun some do it with fine print. Details at eleven.    And we need only read, not only the book on which the film is based (by Upton Sinclair, who ran on a socialist platform for governor of California and was destroyed by a careful media campaign designed by the oil and railroad interests) but also Ida Tarbell's life of John D. Rockefeller to confirm that the early oil business was pretty rough.    Then as now. Then, oil men used force and fraud. Today they take over the US government and invade Iraq as it suits them.    The film, like Jack London, presents the reality as does Tarantino. But the filmgoer, in my view, has a choice. Precisely as he realizes that the choice is between kill or be killed in a Cain and Abel show, he can become Lilith or Obama and refuse the terms of the binarism, and high-tail it out of town on the next train.     At any price, precisely because THEN AS NOW there ain't no way to have any dignity let alone legal tender in this American dream we got going here.    \\"My days of forgettin' are over. My days of rememberin' are begun.\\"    And we tend to forget, owing to the last scene in the bowling alley, the key scene, the penultimate scene: the dumb Son walks away and becomes the Jack of Hearts,     \\"Maybe down in Mexico or a picture upon somebody's shelf.\\"

B00008DDSC|4.0|Like other reviewers, I rented \\"Secretary\\" because of Maggie Gyllenhaal, whose work over the years since 2003 meant that I had to go back and see \\"Secretary,\\" knowing she probably bungee-jumped head first into this dangerous role.<br /><br />I'm going to comment on the lasting impressions for me, not in order of importance:<br /><br />I was thrilled by the brilliant moments when the characters (he and she) reached out to, and came to understand each other.  The world is a cold and lonely place for human beings because we all need affection and companionship.  But for many reasons, it is terribly difficult to find and connect with soul mates, let alone like minds.<br /><br />I loved the scene when he explains why he thinks she is cutting herself and tells her she doesn't need to do it anymore.  At that moment, if only for a moment, she finally got the understanding and affection she desperately needed and deserved.  And although it didn't occur as suddenly, she definitely came to understand him and what he needed.<br /><br />\\"Secretary\\" delivers the goods for those viewers with mostly prurient interests.  However, I thought the displays of physical intimacy between these two people who come to care for each other, unencumbered by what is generally accepted by society, was gracefully done. No, I don't mean the spanking or humiliation.  I mean, for example, the scenes of tenderness, like the one near the end when he worships every inch of her body (particularly one very special inch).<br /><br />I enjoyed the tension and near anguish portrayed by the actors as they approached terrifying moments requiring all their courage.  Breaking through barriers, taking risks, and experimenting is scary.  I saw these two characters battle through walls of anonymity and loneliness to make a connection with each other.<br /><br />Many narrow lines are walked in this movie.  The most important and dangerous of these lines, of course, was knowing when risky behaviors like these are selfless, tender examples of lovemaking, and when they are selfish, cruel exploitation.  In \\"Secretary,\\" we are given many clues about it being the former, rather than the latter.  But do we really always know?  Of course not.  Did the characters always know?<br /><br />I would have awarded five stars had the character development for the male lead been anywhere near what it was for her.  And I would have liked more balance between the two of them, in terms of giving and taking.  Its easier to see how the subservient role is giving to the dominant role than it is the other way around.  And there were moments when I laughed, but whenever I did, I felt I wasn't being honest to the drama.they are selfish, cruel exploitation.

0393061310|5.0|Diamond explores the link between geography, and the way that societies develop, on a grand scale over thousands of years. It's the ultimate history book, in which world events shrink to localised inevitabilities in the grand scheme of things. It's a study that relates to history in the same way that \\"climate\\" relates to \\"weather\\".   Most illuminating and thoroughly researched are the relationships between the available species of plant and animal available to early farmers, and the development of farming and with it \\"civilization\\". One uses the word with caution given the extensive discourse that Diamond has upon the subject. Of similar interest is the way that linguistics are used to underpin and cross-reference archealogical data concerning the movement and development of peoples on a global geographical scale.     The thing that really brings the book to life is the personal passion of Diamond himself. He has worked at close quarters with \\"primitive\\" peoples - a word whose use he would object to - and he is at pains to debunk the notion of one society being in some way genetically superior to another. He mixes research data with personal anecdotes and experiences in a way that illuminates and illustrates what he is saying, without losing the scientific objectivity of his principal vantage point.     The book is well-written, has a clear structure and flows well. At certain points it can be a little laboured, some commonsense points being explained over several pages, but this usually happens when he is tackling some commonly held misperception. He uses the question of a New Guinea friend, basically \\"why do some societies do better than others\\" as opening background, though as an attention-grabber it seemed a little weak and as a \\"red thread\\" came over as slightly contrived. The book really gets into its stride in about the second or third chapter. However, this is a very minor criticism of a work of masterly proportions and execution.     I would thoroughly recommend this book. If nothing else, the reader will be able to watch television documentaries about far-flung places and spot the triteness and popular inexactitude of some of the commentary. However, in terms of driving a stake into the ground, and saying \\"this is where we come from\\" and why, this is the defining work, and well deserving it is of its Pulitzer Prize status.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|i read a **** star by film critic Roger Ebert about this film around the time of its' release . i'm sorry to state that i don't agree with Roger nearly as much as i used to . here i'm very much in agreement . today i was lucky enough to get a copy of the film at a very modest price . i had forgotten about this superb picture in the time between seeing it from the FLIX and now . i can't even begin to imagine what you'll think of it ? i think it's a rare treat . P.S. Roger , big love and hang in there my favorite film critic . it's nice to hear your voice again . all the best to you and Chaz .

B0000X61UU|4.0|This is an excellent workout video. What I like best is that it targets the entire body. You're just not focusing on one area. However, I do think that she moves from one area into the other too quickly. She doesn't give you enough time to get ready.This can problem can be fixed by using your pause button on the video player.
B00003CXCT|5.0|Look i just wanted to rate this product.  it was great.  i shouldn't have waited so long to buy it but then i had the VHS version till about a few months ago.  the DVD set has an awesome bonus disc that contains a documentary about the struggles George Lucas had just making star wars happen.  Theres only one difference i noticed in the film between the VHS version and the DVD versions and thats Hayden Christensen,  His inclusion does make sense i suppose but it still feels out of place.  the rest is gold.
0312305060|5.0|I loved this book. Thoroughly and completely, I loved this book. I am shocked that there are 48 people who gave this book a rating of 1 star. I have never read Virginia Woolf's, Mrs. Dalloway, and I probably won't. But this fact did not take away any enjoyment or appreciation I felt for this book. To each their own, I suppose.  From the first paragraph I was hooked. The words are beautiful and profound. I was amazed how Michael Cunningham could create such real and vivid characters, with such insightful, intuitive thoughts and observations. In reading over the thoughts of each character there were times I thought, \\"I've felt this way.\\" or \\"I have thought that myself,\\" and often I was amazed that such thoughts were so well articulated and richly described. The words flow beautifully from page to page and I love the way the storylines come together. When I was down to the final 10 or so pages, I was both excited to keep going and sad that the pages flew by so quickly and the story would soon end. Nevertheless, I appreciate how the author tied up loose ends instead of dropping the reader off at the curb.  I completely understand why this book won a Pulitzer prize.  If you are looking for a though provoking, honest account of life, it's beauty and blunders, then this is a book worth reading.
1843106698|5.0|Tony Atwood has again managed to provide us with keen insight as to the individuality of the individuals with AS.  He has wonderful vignettes and on children and adults with AS as they struggle with language, emotions, social interactions, and day to day functioning.  He has quotes from individuals with AS as they describe both adult issues and memories from their childhoods.  This gives unique insights into why we see certain behaviors and what causes the need for the behaviors.<br /><br />He doesn't stop there, however. He provides many good ideas for interventions and strategies to help children become more aware of and in control of their environment and their emotions.  I particularly liked the scales of justice activity to help children learn the differences in levels of guilt or culpability in an adverse situation.<br /><br />I feel that any professional who works with children and adults with AS should read this book and keep it available for referral whenever one of their students/patients/clients are struggling.
B0013J30W2|4.0|Finally a thriller that has thrills, superb visual effects, and A-list stars (Morgan Freeman, James McAvoy, and Angelina Jolie - all three are  great in this), a plotline that makes sense! The protagonist, Wesley Gibson, is played by a very buff and deliciously handsome James McAvoy, an account loser whose life is completely nonexistent - he doesn't even come up in a Google search! When The Fraternity, a group of trained assassins comes calling he realizes that big guns, big sums of money, and tight-skin leather jackets also have their price. A very clever, well-done shoot-them-up film that's a great popcorn fare and is enjoyable to watch.
080701429X|5.0|Beautifully written. Easy to comprehend. A very meaningful book. The Doctor presents a good mix of his psychological thesis balanced with very moving and sometimes heart chilling personal accounts and testimonials. Written to inspire the best in anyone, it will definitely open the readers mind to all types of new ways of thinking about and looking at the world and especially at mankind.  It contains the formula for a great personal philosophy. I would recommend this book to anyone, but particularly those who have been affected by trauma and or suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  I have yet to come across a book as inspirational.  It is one of my favorites and I have given it as a gift to many whom I love. 5 Stars!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Upon listening to this album, I instantly fell in love with it.  A wonderfully composed and arranged work by Pat Metheny Group, along with some other excellent musicians.  It does have a slight reminiscence of Offramp, but like all Pat Metheny Group/Pat Metheny albums, each is unique and superb, and I've never heard an album I didn't like immensely.  Some favorites are PMH (the white album), American Garage, Watercolors, Offramp, Bright Size Life, Secret Story, New Chautauqua, etc.  PMG is still my favorite jazz trio, after seeing them for the first time at the Paolo Soleri Amphitheater in Santa Fe, New Mexico back in the summer of '81, and thanks Marghreta C. and Oona B. for taking me to the PMG concert for my birthday.  I've been \\"hooked\\" on the PMG ever since.
B000000ORE|5.0|1989-90, I was in my last two years of college. My friends and I were big Tesla fans even before this album came out, but this album really solidified it for us. We were gargantuan Tesla fans after that. We would come back from the bars and crank this album as loud as humanly possible. We called them \\"Tesla fits\\". It was great fun and would not have been the same if this album hadn't existed. It really defined a brief period in my life when beer and loud rock & roll was all I really needed. I've moved on considerably since then, but still enjoy pulling the album now and again and remembering those good times as I am right now!
B0019FOC5E|2.0|The positive reviews for this soundtrack and movie are stunning to me.  Did we all watch and hear the same movie/soundtrack?  Never having seen the broadway musical, could something have been lost in translation from the stage to the big screen?  I am a huge ABBA fan and I found the movie adaptation and the singing frightfully painful.  It was horrendous actually.  The cast butchered just about every ABBA song they sang.  The only song that was done well was Thank You for the Music sung by Amanda Seyfried which was part of the end credits.  Just about every cast member in the screen version of Mama Mia I liked, but how these people thought they could sing is totally beyond me!  All the cast did was jump up and down and yell.  ABBA never did that.  I left the theatre with a headache and I'm not a musical novice, either.
0553582038|5.0|all the reviews calling this book unnecessary and boring are understandable.  however, this book did an amazing job of continuing to build an already amazing world.  the detail in this book is almost too much to digest and nearly impossible to do so without a goodly amount of effort.  yet when one does take the time to process all the intricate goings on in the seven kingdoms the payoff is huge.  this easily rivals tolkiens world in terms of complexity and believability.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|My one criticism of this series was the fact that as a history teacher, I realized many people would be unable to keep up with the fast paced story.  They would not understand what was going on.  Even remembering the characters would be daunting. The DVD does a great thing by adding the historical onscreen commentary as an option while viewing.  Many nuances that would otherwise be lost in making sense of John Adams life and the time period are captured.  It gives the series a depth it was lacking.
0321544080|3.0|The book has won more praise from photographers of all ilk than just about any other book ever, though as I discovered $55 later, Joe McNally's blue-collar celebrity and incredible photographic versatility don't guarantee that everything he publishes is as cool as he is. The party line is that the book \\"has one foot on the coffee table and one in the classroom,\\" which amounts to two few feet, as I see it; each image is paired with a very soft technical explication that merely suggests that McNally is, in fact, alive (and proud of what he's done while alive). Sure, the novice with little imagination may feel treated to privileged perspective thumbing through the candied panoply of McNally's greatest hits, but unless you're at ground zero with this novice, this book will not elevate your craft at all (even though Joe is cool).

B001ACY8D2|4.0|I've been a Sigur Ros fan for quite some time, since 1999 when I first heard Agaetis Byrun. Since then, I've collected anything and everything that was released by the band and was lucky enough to see them live when they kicked off the US leg of the Takk tour here in Hawaii. Simply an amazing band with such a unique and beautiful sound, their music, so atmospheric and layered with emotions.<br /><br />\\"Med Sud I Eyrum Spilum Endalaust\\", the band's 4th full length release (5th if you count Von) had my expectations high. After my first listen, I was a bit disappointed. The band's sound seemed to be a lot more stripped down, not this vast sonic landscape the band so easily painted in the past. I read some of the early reviews and one common theme to most of them was to take more time listening to the album, so that's exactly what I did. So now, it's 1 month later, and I will have to agree that the songs grew on me the more time I gave it, but, still not to the level of the 3 previous albums.<br /><br />The general vein running through the album is that it's much more upbeat and pop sounding...only as much as a band like Sigur Ros could sound \\"pop\\" that is. The opening track, \\"Gobbledigook\\", was just a total departure from anything they've done, fast, with an almost tribal beat, that actually felt monotonous and light to me. The 2nd track \\"Inni Mer Syngur Vitleysingur\\" was another fast-tempo song, upbeat with a strong percussive movement throughout but as with the first track, it felt like there was no real substance to it. These 2 tracks were probably my least favorite on the album. The other song that I was disappointed in is track 7, \\"Ara Batur\\". A slower, near 9 minute track that for the most part is beautiful with just Jonsi's great voice backed by a piano and later building with some strings. Towards the last 2 minutes of the track though, it crescendos into a full orchestra that just sounds too syrupy, too over dramatic, like the score to a love-saturated B-Movie and is just too over the top for me.<br /><br />There are many great tracks on this album though, \\"Festival\\", the longest track at 9:24 is definitely the anchor of the album. It wanders effortlessly with Jonsi's falsetto voice and slowly builds to a swirling climax, to finally end in near silence with just some quiet whistling...brilliant. The following track, \\"Sud I Eyrum\\" is another upbeat and playful sounding track that ends with a great distortion that sounds incredible through headphones. Another track worth mentioning is track 8, \\"Illgresi\\", which is probably the most stripped down of all the songs. It features just Jonsi on acoustic guitar with a few moments of strings. Very folk sounding and soothing. Track 9, \\"Fljotavik\\" yet another slower track that has a nice flow to it which builds to an upbeat, happy ending. And the final track, \\"All Alright\\" is very subdued and slow moving. Jonsi actually sings in English and in a quiet, intimate voice. With some very touching lyrics;<br />\\"I'm sitting with you / Sitting in silence / Let's sing into the years, like one / Singing in tune, together / A psalm for no one / Let's sing in tune / But now it's home\\",<br />it's a perfect ending to the album.<br /><br />Like the cover with the nude figures running accross a deserted road, the songs on this album are stripped down and happily running forward. For me, \\"Med Sud I Eyrum Spilum Endalaust\\" is much more structured than prior albums for sure, and with a more structured production, some of the songs do seem to lose some of that indescribable \\"essence\\" that had grabbed me in previous releases.<br />I really struggled with what to rate this album. I bounced back and forth between 3 and 4 stars but ultimately decided it was closer to 4 than 3. I do think fans that already know the band and new fans alike, will still find this album enjoyable and worth adding to their collection.over the top for me.

B000002MIF|4.0|who or what are the smiths? an idiosyncratic, pop rock band from england. there will never be another band like them. just one of those bands whose sound is extremely hard to get right. one could go on endlessly about this band and its inscrutable leader and genius guitar playing. however, the smiths are really for people who enjoy good rock music. if you put aside all of the baggage and controversy over sexuality or the politics of morrissey, you will be doing yourself a favor. i was never a big smiths fan, but this album should turn the ears of critics because it is simply good rocknroll. it is not depressing in terms of its musical merits, because the rythm section plus mr. Marrs seem to gurantee that your toes are tapping.   hatful is distinctively lo-fi. it's a bare bones recording that leaves it all up to th band's musicianship which never misses a step. it actually makes for a very punky sound which is great, as it brings out the sounds of the band's influences.   musicians would be hard pressed to find a tighter ryhthm section in rock. unfortunately, these things get overlooked with some of the hoopla surrouding morrissey.   whatever you do, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. morrissey's lyrics can get a little heavy and english, but again the guy can just flat out sing. there's a lot of sinatra in there.
B0013FBS20|3.0|Great, sharp clear on blu-ray. In all of New York it seems only one real human is left alive after a deadly virus. Very lucky the last man standing is a scientist seeking a cure to transform zombies back into humans. The end result is \\"I Am Legend.\\" Will Smith has the ability to capture your interest in a move from the get go every time, making him a legend. He accomplishes this task once again in \\"I Am Legend.\\" The true legend be told is this movie is a remake of a 1971 B Movie called \\"The Omega Man,\\" starring Charlton Heston which in return is based on a 1954 novel called, (yep you guessed it) \\"I Am Legend.\\" Now we have gone full circle, \\"I Am Legend\\" 2007 is a dizzy display of so much CGI (Computer Generated Imagery) the film at times seems at best, very good cartoon animation. I'm the first one to agree that CGI special effect have added a great deal to the industry where before only hand made models with extreme limitation existed but CGI has some ways to go to prefect the technology. Some CGI turns out very well as Steven Spielberg's \\"Jurassic Park,\\" or \\"I Robot\\" another Will Smith film but the CGI in \\"I Am Legend\\" is an over done potato, sorry to say. Even so, Smith comes through again making this film worth a view but overall \\"I Am Legend\\" is \\"The Omega Man,\\" on CGI Steroids  Couch Potato Review 3 potato 4

0143038419|5.0|I would only like to offer a short comment here, as I am only partway through the India section of this book.  I like it.  So far, Gilbert's truthfulness about her life - including divorce, depression, and disconnection - has been refreshing.  Of course, I could change my mind, but so far so good.    For those of you that criticize her choice to not be a wife anymore or a mother, citing her life \\"was not so bad\\", recall where she intentionally chose to not divulge details out of respect.  I think in any relationship there are far too many nuances internal to the partnership most are not privy to.  You don't know what was really going on, so stop judging.  Her decision was obviously difficult.  How many of you are just unconsciously jealous, wishing that you could stop living the life you are expected to live?    For those of you that are whining about the \\"self-absorbed\\" and \\"selfish\\" focus of the book, did you not actually understand what this trip was about?  IT WAS ALL ABOUT HER.  If you want a book that is written as a bland travel narrative, or for you, write it yourself.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Lets face it, I, Robot the Asimov text would not make a great film, even if it were a great book. This attempts to sew the ideas in that book into an all encompassing package.    On the whole, it succeeds. It is not perfect, but stands ahead of most of the superhero movies of the last 15 years and is up there among the better movies of the action genre. And Will Smith makes a good transition from comic to serious role.

0307265730|4.0|Unaccustomed Earth by Jhumpa Lahiri: Jhumpa Lahiri, Pulitzer Prize winning author of Interpreter of Maladies, and author of The Namesake, returns after five years with Unaccustomed Earth, a collection of eight stories that are longer than short stories but not quite novella length. It's split into two parts. The first consists of five individual stories, while the second part consists of the last three tales, each involving the same two characters, Hema and Kaushik.    The first story, \\"Unaccustomed Earth,\\" involves a family who recently moved to Seattle. After the death of Ruma's mother, she is left feeling guilty over the decision of whether or not to invite her aging Baba (father), to live with them. Not sure how to handle this, she invites him to stay with her for a week. Over the course of their time together, father and daughter rekindle their relationship, while secrets are revealed about their separate lives. Baba also meets and falls in love with Ruma's son Akash, looking after him, teaching him some Bengali, and treating him like a grandfather should - giving him more respect and attention than he has ever given Ruma. At the end of the week, Baba goes back home to his secret girlfriend and life of travel, leaving Ruma unsure, and the reader wanting more. \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" sets the tone for the book, which offers stories of lives with problems and decisions and changes that affect all the characters. But it is those of Indian descent who have to deal with how much of their original culture they hold on to in their American lives.    \\"A Choice of Accommodations\\" is an interesting story about an interracial couple who are having problems with their marriage. During a weekend attending a friend's wedding, they rediscover their love and respect for each other. The most compelling story of the collection is \\"Nobody's Business,\\" involving a young Indian girl, Sangeeta, who is involved with an Egyptian man, but continuously has suitors calling her with the hopeof a meeting and eventual marriage. What makes the story interesting is that it is told from the perspective of the roommate, Paul, who has a crush on Sang, and finds himself unavoidably involved in her romantic and personal life while trying to complete his doctorate. While at first the story seems to go in an obvious direction, it eventually moves off on a new tangent as things change in Sang's relationship and she ends up moving back to England, with Paul having to deal with the leftover pieces.    Lahiri continues to do what she does best, creating strong, unique characters who stay with readers after the story is over. Sadly, Lahiri fails to take risks with her writing, always portraying Indian characters who - like herself - come from an affluent, upper class upbringing, in most cases in New York or New England. Perhaps in her next work, Lahiri will branch out from her write what you know world and venture into new territory. Nevertheless, Unaccustomed Earth is a fascinating collection of stories involving Indian characters struggling with issues involved in being American, but at the same time keeping their original heritage and culture alive.

0156034026|5.0|It's only 184 pages and a fast read.  But don't let the size of this book fool you.  It has a tremendous emotional wallop.  It pulled me in, turned me inside out and then slammed me down again.  It's rare for a book to do that to me.<br /><br />A bearded Pakistani man, Changez, sits down in a caf&eacute; next to an American in Lahore, Pakistan and begins a monologue that lasts throughout the entire book.  He speaks about the food and the sights of the city in between telling his tale of his own life in America.  Changez was privileged.  He graduated from Princeton and then was hired by a prestigious financial consulting firm. He meets an American girl and falls in love.  She still longs for a dead boyfriend and we soon see that nostalgia turning into mental instability.  Changez is nostalgic too.  He misses his homeland and is lives through a tangle of complex emotions when the World Trade Center is attacked on 9/11. His view of his privileged American life starts to change.<br /><br />The writer is skilled.  The voice of Changez is steady and strong.  In between telling his life story, there is a meal being served and there will be a sudden switch in the narrative from his life story as he directs his conversation to the American about the meal for a few sentences.  Then he will get back to his story, and, even though his words are always sugar coated polite phrases, at times there is an undercurrent of menace which builds slowly to the conclusion.<br /><br />I must admit that couldn't stand the tension and read the last page early in my reading but it still didn't stop me from keeping my eyes glued to the fast turning pages with my heart racing.<br /><br />This book is an exceptional piece of writing.  Highly recommended.
B0009A40ES|5.0|Not only was the quality of a used DVD excellent (unnoticable!), the movie itself is one of my top five of all time.  It's so humourously evil in the same sense as Fargo, where what's going on in the scene makes you squirm and chuckle deviously at the same time.  For those with a warped sense of humour or even those who just enjoy an amazing movie with superb acting, I recommend this!
0439882826|5.0|STAR WARS: A POP-UP GUIDE TO THE GALAXY BY MATTHEW REINHART: In celebration of the 30th anniversary since the release of Star Wars, along with The Star Wars Vault, there is this true gem for all fans alike: Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy. You may be turned away by the term \\"pop-up,\\" thinking it something that applies only to children's books and to be ignored, and I would tend to agree with you, except in this case! The Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy is the only pop-up book you will need to and ever want to own.    The thick but light book is divided into six double-spread pages. It does not tell the chronological story of Star Wars from episodes I-VI, but is instead more like a report from someone who traveled to this galaxy, far, far away, and came back to tell of what he or she saw and learned there. The copy on each page is detailed and complex. This is not for anyone (if there is anyone) who has yet to see Star Wars, for prior understanding is required, since on each page facts, stats, and details are thrown at you along with incredible colorful pictures that pop-out before your very eyes and almost become real.    To say there is just something for everyone would be like saying the Millennium Falcon could \\"probably\\" make the Kessel Run in maybe 12 parsecs. The most impressive tableau is the pop-up of a large Mos Eisley spaceport where our heroes Luke and Obi-Wan first met Han and Chewie. Organized in wonderfully complex 3D fashion, we see the familiar scene with different groups of people and lots of familiar faces, who are all explained. But whether you're hoping some of the lesser known bounty hunters, like IG-88 and Bossk get mentioned; or whether Jabba the Hutt's Desert Skiff can hover up to 50 meters and travel up to 250 kilometers per hour; or whether they remembered to mention the formidable but often forgotten Wedge Antilles; rest assured they are all recorded here.    And if that isn't enough for you, why then you can turn to the last page where you will be greeted by Lord Darth Vader coming out at you with the scarred old man's face beneath. After recovering from that, you turn to the fold-out panels either side of the black helmet which discuss Anakin Skywalker who became Darth Vader on the left and Luke Skywalker on the right. The key here is to open both at the same time, as each character pops out in miniature, each holding their familiar lightsabers which actually light up red and green.

0091857023|5.0|This book was recommended to me 2 weeks after the birth of my first child. I was a mess and didn't know how to understand my new baby. I read it during my down time (nursing) and was able to make a whole lot of sense of this new little one, and what I needed to do to regain my sanity. I wish I'd read it before he was born. I learned how to understand his cues, how to put him on a regular schedule, and how to plan time for myself so I could feel like a normal person again. I get this book for all of my friends/family who are expecting.
B000E1MTZE|5.0|Did you go to a movie theater to see any of these movies? Did you like them? Do you have a good home theater set up with an HD DVD player? If so then you will want to see these in 1080p. I realy liked the second one \\"Reloaded\\".
386521584X|5.0|Looking at this again after many years ( I first came across it about 25 years ago) the images are as poignant as  ever. This is truly a great book of photographs and is perhaps the best photojournalist's collection ever published. The new edition has all the gravity and attention to detail that the work deserves.

0307277453|3.0|Neil Shubin is a professor and associate dean at the University of Chicago.  Also a paleontologist, Shubin made headlines around the world in April 2006 when he discovered the \\"missing link\\" in the world of fish with Tiktaalik, a fish with many features like that of tetrapods or four-legged animals.  When asked to teach a human anatomy course, Shubin discovered that a lot of the structures and evolutionary processes of the human body could be better explained through the evolution of fish anatomy.  Thus was born Your Inner Fish: A Journey Into the 3.5 Billion-Year History of the Human Body.    Shubin breaks everything down into its fundamental parts, with specific chapters on genes, teeth, scents, ears, and sight.  He traces the evolutionary history of the important organs of the body, tracing their development over the millions of years through fish and other animals.  It is a fascinating study into how the evolutionary marvel of the incredibly complex human body came to be; how organs, tissues, and vessels changed and improved through a process of natural selection to become the most beneficial.  The result is a never-stopping fast-running factory house with over a million continuous processes that is taken for granted by most of the world's population.    Shubin writes in a simple and easy style that makes it accessible to any reader, no matter their scientific knowledge or background.  Filled with pictures and tables and graphs illustrating the facts, Your Inner Fish is an interesting read into our evolutionary history as seen through the developing bodies of the animal kingdom.

0060557818|1.0|The short of it: creative but,<br />1. storyline is lame<br />2. characters are cardboard cut-outs without a hint of personality.<br /><br />eeek. I loved Stardust. It was such a witty and pleasant fairy-tale. I heard wonderful things about Sandman. I expected an interesting story. In all honestly- it was boring. There was no real point to the story. There is creativity and great ideas, but there is no substance. It is almost like the book is a dumping ground for wonderful ideas, but the chord that ties them together is painfully weak.<br />The plot, or the reason behind the situation turns out to be so simple, that from the moment the character in question (the one causing the problems) comes in, I figured it out. I told myself: \\"no, that can't be it, that is too simple. Don't worry, it will pick up. Keep reading\\".<br />The ending is painfully anti-climatic. The characters hired to be bad, are bad, and then are hired not to be bad and then are hired to be bad again- it was silly. SMALL SPOLER WARNING: in the beginning he wants her dead, but at the same time he needed her- then why was he ordering her death??? That was never cleared up. Also, Richard's ordeal? That was it?LAME!!<br /><br />The place is dirty and ugly and yes, like an Alice in Wonderland adventure... but without emotion and with characters who utterly lack personality and who are painfully boring. I just never cared for ANY of them, blaaah :P.
B0013527I4|5.0|It's a pleasure to have the third season of The Muppet Show on DVD in my collection!! From the country sounds of Loretta Lynn and Roger Miller to the hard rock of Alice Cooper to the easy stylings of Helen Reddy you are sure to be entertained.This collection is truly an all star one and quite delightful too!I especially enjoyed the commercials included in this volume. Now I am anxiously awaiting Volume 4. I have a sneaky feeling it will be Gonzo's face on the cover!
0452289963|4.0|In this book Tolle presents his conception of ideas that have been espoused for thousands of years, and which aim to elevate Man's purpose and nature beyond the material world. As is true for all books of this kind,it suffers from the inherent contradictions and ambiguity which arises from trying to describe the ineffable. Yet for the right person this book can be invaluable.    While Tolle's ideas maybe considered a form of Buddhism,  he seems to use more examples from the teachings of Jesus, though his interpretation is more in line with Gnosticism than orthodox Roman Catholicism. As he unfolds his beliefs, which center on the evolution of our Consciousness, I found myself seeing Jesus' actions and words in a new, empowering way, as the deadweight of classical conceptions gave way to a feeling of exhilaration and transcendence.     As is true of any book which deals with this subject matter, if you are open and seeking a spirituality which the secular, material world so glaringly lacks, than this book may well resonate with you, and maybe even change your life. However, a rational secularist will find it so much New Age bunk.As Tolle explains, he is not seeking to convert people but rather to help those who are ready for enlightenment. If this is you, this book can be a treasure you will cherish for a long time.
0307346617|1.0|Alright. So there was a lot of hub bub hoopla about this novel. Firstly, its a fantastic idea. Fictional recounting of experiences during the Zombie War taken down by someone hired/appointed by a global council of sorts. The book begins out well, the accounts of survivors and the roles and experiences they have. But...then I noticed I wasn't enjoying the quality of the writing. It wasn't very inspired or vivid. Sure, I could picture what was happening, but a lot of it came from my own imagination. No beautiful phrases, unsettling images, etc. And on top of this it becomes so repetative. Somebody struggling with surviving the war, over and over and over.    I gave it one star because I just was not interested at all in finishing this book and moved on.
B0010358CG|4.0|Technically this is surely state of the art CGI for Animation today. Only final Fantasy seems to be more advanced for me.    Story and characters are ok.     Only the fact that it is the obvious bad guy theme at the end gives the 4 star rating - a more intelligent plot for the bad guy and it would hav ended um with five...
B0013LKZWS|5.0|I bought this CD because I heard the sound byte on the Rhapsody commercial and it was really catchy.  I figured it would be one of those CDs with one or two good songs that never gets listened to.  I love EVERY single song on this CD.  Sara has such a beautiful voice and the tunes are catchy and great to just get in your car and drive.    Can't wait to hear more from her!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the best mini-series ever made. period.  I am very happy with my purchase and with the quickness in which I received my purchase.  Excellent seller.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|Radiohead is my favorite band...not the best way to start out a review, I know, because you're thinking most likely it's going to be horribly biased....BUT....I'm a really big fan of music.  I eat, sleep, drink, breathe it and this by definition is what I'm looking for in an album.  I got it for like $1 digitally, then bought it when it came out.  Listen to the whole thing from start to finish on a regular basis and you will be a better person...I promise.  :)  But, for real, good job Thom & the boys.  See you at Lollapalooza next weekend...I can't wait!!!!!
B000ZHXUG4|5.0|I thought The History of Violence was as good as it gets for Viggo Mortensen, but this was truly an Oscar Worthy performance. The story and characters are fresh and original, no copies here, and although Naomi Watt's character seemed a tad naive, she still was convincing and endearing. This was a seriously suspenseful movie with excellent characters for you to love and hate.
0694003611|2.0|I got the book for my 4 yr old and 2 yr old - but neither of them like it much. My husband and I don't like reading it either, and here's why:<br /><br />The text is quite disjoint, like bits and pieces of other fairy tales and nursery rhymes put together. It seems like the author has just put down random things together - there's no rhyme (literally!) or reason for any of the pages. It does not flow lyrically.<br /><br />The only interesting aspect is the black and white illustrations on some of the pages. This offers a striking contrast to the color illustrations. However, the whole book has not been put together well, and the quality of illustrations is just so-so. So the impact of the b&w is also pointless.<br /><br />Compared to other wonderful books like the \\"Hungry Caterpillar\\" or \\"Ten Little Lady Bugs\\" or \\"The Firefly's First Flight\\" which we all really love, this book definitely is not worth having in the childrens' bookshelf.<br /><br />I seem to be among the minority in disliking this book on Amazon - perhaps I am not seeing something that others are.. But hey! this is truly my opinion!
B000002UHG|3.0|Richard Wright is best known as the original keyboard player for Pink Floyd.  He was a member of the band up through \\"The Wall\\" album and then re-joined for \\"Momentary Lapse Of Reason\\" back in the 90's.  Before Roger Waters took over most of the songwriting in the band, Richard used to write quite a bit and also sing lead on some of Floyd's stuff.  He was never a flashy keyboard player, but his style was an essential part of what Pink Floyd was all about.  I have Wright's first solo album \\"Wet Dream\\" on vinyl and have always liked it, so I was interested to hear what he had come up with for this one as well.  \\"Broken China\\" is a concept album about his soon to be wife's struggle with clinical depression.  The music, for the most part, is very mellow with the exception of the rocker \\"Along The Shoreline\\" which is one of the best tracks on the disc.  About half the album is instrumental and features Wright's moody layered keyboards.  Wright's vocals are hit and miss.  He never had a great voice to begin with and he has lost some of his range over the years.  On some of the tracks his voice really fits the material, but on others he appears to be straining a bit.  Sinead O'Connor lends guest vocals to two of the albums best songs \\"Rail\\" and the finale \\"Breakthrough\\" both very nice pieces of music.  This album came and went fairly quickly without getting a lot of notice or any airplay.  I think Pink Floyd fans will have varying degrees of enjoyment from this.  I really like about half of it, but find some of the material a bit on the dull side.
0061122416|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" by Paulo Coelho is an eloquently written & magical story, compelling, & with wisdom about following your heart.    The plot line is psychologically intense & portrays a dramatic journey;  the quest to fulfill your destiny/Life Legend.  Universal wisdom abounds with a radiant array of fascinating & colourful characters!    Here's a few quotes from Paulo Coelho's \\"The Alchemist\\" for some insight into the essence of the book:    1.  \\"It's a force that appears to be negative, but actually shows you how to realize you Personal Legend.  It prepares your spirit and your will, because there is one great truth on this planet: whoever you are, or whatever it is that you do, when you really want something, it's because that desire originated in the soul of the universe.  It's your mission on earth.\\"    2.  \\"Don't forget that everything you deal with is only one thing and nothing else.  And don't forget the language of omens.  And, above all, don't forget to follow you Personal Legend through to its conclusion.\\"    3.  \\"If I can learn to understand this language without words, I can learn to understand the world.    4.  \\"In alchemy, it's called the Soul of the World.  When you want something with all your heart, that's when you are closest to the Soul of the world.  It's always a positive force.\\"    5.  \\"All things are the manifestation of one thing only.\\"    \\"The Alchemist\\" is a life-enchanting book, and most highly recommended!      Even better when read together with a recent, contemporary New Energy novel \\"Nexus\\" by Morrison & Singh; a soul-stirring, heart-centered, spiritual adventure story about  enlightened transformation!    [[ASIN:0978107004 Nexus: A Neo Novel]]
B00125WAWS|5.0|Although a simple good feeling ending that seems a little too long, it is an excellent movie and a good history lesson.
032147404X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book for all the great info and tips. I like the way it was broken down for each topic covered and lots of great images for examples. The author does have quite a sense of humor, but I rather enjoyed it and it kept things interesting without being to over the top. A lot of great topics covered from recommended equipment such as filters, tripods, printers & and even paper. Great recommendations on website and couple of tips for adobe. Also recommendations of creative approaches to taking photos and not just explaining settings to use on the camera fir certain situations. Must have for any owner of a DSLR.
B000002J1C|4.0|For Yes's 3rd album the first in a series of many significant personnel changes would take place.  Out was original guitarist Peter Banks and in would be a man who would win many guitarist of the year honors through the 70s and 80's, virtuoso Steve Howe.  The Yes album would produce several all time band classics four of which are still often played on tour and classic rock radio to this day.  \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", \\"I've Seen All Good People\\", \\"Perpetual Change\\", and the often used concert grand finale \\"Starship Trooper\\" have all been staples of the band's live show for years.  \\"All Good People\\" even made it into the top 40 on radio.  This is probably what most people consider the first classic Yes album and it really has stood up well.  The remastered version sounds great too.  My one critism is that I liked the live version of some of these songs better than the studio versions on this disc.  Live, \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" served as a backdrop for a lengthy guitar workout from Steve Howe that is much rawer than found here.  The same can be said of \\"Starship Trooper\\" that on stage became a bombastic closing number with curtain drawing guitar and keyboard solos (especially after Rick Wakeman came on board) that would just smoke in concert.  It pretty much became the band's \\"Free Bird\\".  In the studio I find Steve Howe's guitar to be......well.....just too clean and almost jazzy at times.  This would be something I would find mildly annoying throughout Yes's career from Howe in particular.  Anyway, overall this is a good album and still considered a classic by most people.
0307455378|3.0|Very similar and very different from La Sombra del Viento. The romantic location is the same, but where the other book was a gothic mystery, fundamentally rational and with a coherent and satisfying solution, this is a totally irrational story, a fantasy book. Good in its own way, but a deception nonetheless.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is a great workout, and I am still on level 1.  Want to work up to level 3 w/n a month.  The workouts focus on cardio, strength, and abs so you can get a full body workout in a short amount of time.  I highly recommend this video.
B000096IBI|5.0|This is the best film of Chaplin's that I watch many times over.  You can't get any better than this.   Love the button scene and the dept. store skating.  Fantastic!
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This movie is a must-see, if you were a fan of the series \\"Firefly\\".  I highly recommend the movie to fill in many gaps that were left when Firefly was cancelled.
0385340567|1.0|Having very much enjoyed the majority of Child's novels about a truly fascinating character, I couldn't imagine reading a Reacher novel that would bore me.    I was wrong. The plot of Nothing to Lose is thin and meandering, lacking the usual driving force of Child's earlier books. But the worst is the transparent political posturing of the author and his left-leaning nonsense, and the attempt to have us believe Reacher would say these things.     It's been a great ride with Reacher, and I'll pick up the next book, but if it's anything like this one . . . I fear it may be the last Reacher novel I'll be reading.

1400082773|5.0|Interesting perspective. I enjoyed reading this book while on vacation this summer. It gave me a lot of insight into what kind of person Barack Obama is and where he came from. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the man who will be our next president of the United States.
B000N3ST3Y|4.0|Genesis' first proper greatest hits album entitled Turn it On Again - The Hits was released in October of 1999.<br />The disc 18 songs and is close to 70 plus minutes of classic Genesis material.<br />It also contains a 12-page booklet with a cool looking collage as well as the song titles and writing credits, what songs came from which albums, pictures of the album covers and thank you's.<br />The tracks on the collection has four tracks from the 1991 US Top 5 album We Can't Dance (No Son of Mine (edited), I Can't Dance, Jesus He Knows Me, Hold on My Heart which were all the big hits from the album). Then we have five tracks from 1986's Top 3 album Invisible Touch (the album's chart-topping title cut, Throwing It All Away, Tonight Tonight Tonight(edited), Land of Confusion and In Too Deep all of which were singles). Then there are two tracks from the 1983 Top 10 self-titled effort a/k/a The Shapes Album (the atmospheric \\"Mama\\" (here in edited single form) and the US Top 10 hit \\"That's All\\").<br />We then have one track from the first Genesis album to reach the US Top 10 called Abacab (its title cut). 1980's Duke is represented by \\"Turn it On Again\\" and the US Top 20 hit \\"Misunderstanding\\". The band's first US Gold selling Top 20 album, 1978's And Then There Were Three is represented by \\"Follow You Follow Me\\". Only one Peter Gabriel era track is here and it's from 1973's Selling England by the Pound is represented by \\"I Know What I Like\\". We close things with the track \\"Congo\\" from the band's poorly received 1997 album Calling All Stations (which featured Ray wilson in Phil Collins' microphone stand). The disc ends with the 1999 re-recording of the 1974 album The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway's classic cut \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" dubbed \\"Carpet Crawlers 99\\" and is a nice, unique re-recording of the classic Lamb Lies Down album track.<br />The compilation reached #56 on the US charts but did go Gold as its sales were consistent over time.<br />Until 2005, this was the only Genesis compilation out there and was only a single disc then came The Platinum Collection (which is now out of print in the US so try and find it) and this compilation's expanded re-release in 2007 as Turn it On Again The Hits (2007 Tour Edition) which trumps the 1999 single disc version.tion out there and was only a single disc then came The Platinum Collection (which is now out of print in the US so try and find it) and this compilation's expanded re-release in 2007 as Turn it On Again The Hits (2007 Tour Edition) which trumps the 1999 single disc version.
B000RZIGZ4|5.0|I am personally rating Top Gun HD as a must have. If you watched it many years ago like I did then you were watching it in a state that gave it no just dues.     The sound track in HD is wonderful, and the details in the picture gave me chills! I recommend this classic to anyone who in joys this film, but have not gotten to the point of true HD.     It is worth you money!
B001ANE3EA|4.0|I listen to a lot of different kinds of music, and what most would consider to be \\"Pop\\" isn't exactly on the top of my list. This album is an exception. With funky grooves, soulful synths, and catchy lyrics, there aren't a lot of bad spots in this album. I'm a sucker for bonus material, so i snagged the deluxe edition at Wal-Mart, and wasn't disappointed with the concert footage included. Good stuff.
0060920084|4.0|This is my first Bill Bryson book, so I can't compare this book to his others.  But I can say that I really enjoyed the sarcastic humor at the expense of middle America.  Many authors try and fail to bring the same amount of wit to their books as Bill Bryson.<br /><br />Bryson's journey took place in 1988, which makes the book a little dated.  But you have to wonder how much less fun the trip would be with a cell phone, email, GPS and Yelp.  It's a little depressing to read about how much had changed in this country in 1988, and realize that was 20 years ago.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|I am reviewing the new collector's edition DVD for this film. The film itself is a true classic and still holds up beautifully. Jack Lemmon is in fine form as well as the entire cast. The print looks great on this edition and there are a couple of very good extras. One about Jack Lemmon and another about the film itself. The film won the Academy Award  for 'Best Picture ' in 1960 and if you haven't seen it, maybe it's time you did. A rare insightful film that manages to balance comedy and drama to perfection.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I recently attended an Emmylou Harris concert. She sang several tracks from this album. I liked them so much I immediately ordered this CD, and am very pleased that I did so. Emmylou's voice is as wonderful as ever. The entire CD is great, but I especially enjoyed \\"Sailing Round the Room.\\"
B00005JKG9|4.0|This is film is really hard to rate as I loved the cast and performances, but it's story of ruthless salespeople had me cringing in disgust! Pacino and Lemmon stand out in this insightful film of the pressures of salesmanship and what lengths these parasites will go through to close the deal. This film has a ridiculous amount of profanity, so if that bothers you....don't watch this movie! I usually don't mention anything about profanity, but even I found this excessive. It's a very good movie, but because of my total loathing of these people I will never watch it again!

B00006GFAB|5.0|This is one of the most amazing collections of songs I've ever had the pleasure of listening to. I highly reccomend it to all music fans, KISS fan or not. I give this CD a 10/10. Truly a great collection.
0743298039|4.0|I am a fan of the Bronte sisters and Rebecca and this book is in the same style/genre and captures your attention with mystery and intrigue. It is easy to read, compelling, and touching as I found myself bonding with the characters. Although it does pull at the heartstrings it leaves you with a sense of understanding and appreciation. It is a really good book.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Keira Knightly's interpretation of Elizabeth Bennet was ridiculous.  She made Lizzy out to be sort of a snot.  Elizabeth would never have disrespected her mother the way Knightly's version did in this movie.  It was not true to the book, to the character, or to the period.  Perhaps it was bad directing & not completely the actress's fault but that totally ruined the movie, for me.
0345495004|4.0|A haunting and beautifully written book about the doomed love affair between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney. Although I had a difficult time relating to Mamah Cheney's decision to leave her children to pursue a life with Frank Lloyd Wright, in the end I had a great deal of pity for her. I felt that the author did a poor job in her portrayal of Catherine Wright, who comes across as a pathetic nincompoop, rather than a mistreated and abandoned wife. Also, Mamah Cheney's sudden realization towards the end of the book that her lover was a colossal egoist and a liar seems a bit far-fetched, as a woman of her intelligence and insight would surely have realized the character of the man with whom she was living after learning that he had left his wife with a $900 grocery bill (a not insignificant sum in those days) in order to flee to Europe with her. However, the novel continues to haunt me days after I finished it, and it has left me with a curiosity to learn more about the two central characters.
B000YAA68C|4.0|Without any kind of interesting beginning, there follows an abounding increase of hilarious comedy! Their give-and-take marriage of nine years, could have been much more successful for Holly and Geery. After their numerous battles and continual make-ups, I became caught-up in a greatly improved story-plot.     My favorite personality was Holly played by Hilary Swank! Quite a uniquely romantic role after The Million Dollar Baby.  As this story developed, I became more enamored by Kathy Bates as Mother and the bar-tender William played by Harry Connick,Jr. After Geery's hysterical Memorial Service, the movie evolved into one great, compelling, fascinating Romantic Comedy!        The next uniquely interesting character was the Irishman, William! When Geery's carefully planned letters came to Holly, one was a suggested trip for her to travel to Ireland. There she came upon the deceased's former friend from childhood, William. Those letters continued for the first year's absence of her Beloved. Her three close girl friends insisted she was overdue for another sexually stimulating experience! For me it was a close tie between the romantic escapade and the beauty of the Irish country side.       All-in-all this was the most compelling, entertaining, and fascinating romantic comedy yet for me. I recommend this fascinating comedy. Retired Chaplain Fred W. Hood

B0016A2FFG|5.0|It is hard to believe that the Al Green of 1969 is the same Al Green forty years later on this CD.  I mean, the voice, the tone, the moan, the music --- IT'S THE SAME GOOD STUFF!  John Legend, Corine Bailey Rae, Quest Love and the other Roots personnel clearly know how to compliment a living legend and no doubt, they all studied Willie Mitchell and the Memphis sound.  And what can we say about Anthony Hamilton.  I have always said that this guy is a \\"throw back\\" soul singer, cut from the same cloth as Eddie Floyd, Johnny Taylor, Otis Redding, and of course, Al Green.  I play this CD at home, in the car, and at the office.  It's top quality singing, song writing, and most of all, LOVE SONGS!  Of course, buy this CD and enjoy it with your lady!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Dance party people, alert. Goldfrapp's latest release may not be on your playlist. If you've got the patience, and if you liked her earlier material, still give this a listen.     It's fitting that Alison Goldfrapp looks like a grown-up Goldilocks. Her latest, Seventh Tree, evokes images of riding through a forest, in the middle of a kind of offbeat fairy tale. Though not as energetic or glamorous as recent releases, this album seems to be a return to her debut Felt Mountain. Beautifully arranged, Seventh Tree offers plenty of sensual, soothing songs, both contemplative and healing.     \\"Little Bird,\\" the second track, is practically symphonic. The way the music sways and builds until it's all around you, with Alison's angelic voice, backed by drums and atmospherics, is absolutely blissful. \\"Happiness,\\" is like a tiny, cheerful circus with its playful rhythm and catchy introduction. \\"Road to Somewhere\\" gently pulsates and guides the soul. \\"Cologne Cerrone Houdini\\" is sultry but sophisticated.     Seventh Tree brings us into the summer soothing and gently edging the soul forward.    --Christine Thelen    See more music reviews at [...]
B000GLKLCK|5.0|In the world of classical music, Mozart's 27 piano concertos stand among the greatest pinnacle works for the genre. Among the legenday recordings, Murray Perahia's are considered by many professionals and amatuers alike to be among the finest readings. Sets like this are a superb investment for a lifetime of enjoyment and marvel.     While most are familiar with the \\"Great Piano Concertos\\" that Mozart largely wrote towards the end of his Vienna heydays, I was surprised at how delectable the early concertos were even though they are less complex compositions than the later masterpieces.     Perahia and the English Chamber Orchestra bring out the galante charm of these pieces. In the famous c-minor and d-minor works, there are certainly more \\"ominous and thundering\\" recordings - Malcom Bilson and the English Baroque Solists come to mind - but Perahia and the ECO bring a consistent lithe and fluid progression to each piece. It is magnificant music on all levels.     The sound quality is quite good with the piano sounding exceptionally sparkling and pefectly balanced. The orchestra was recorded a bit on the restrained side which was fine with me as I prefer concertos that have less dynamic range. It is good but just shy of the brilliance and clarity of the best modern DDD recordings. But, the piano is wonderfully recorded and can be heard in great detail - especially vital for students.     This is a landmark CD set of timeless music that is a fine investment in the musical history of the western world. Is it \\"the best?\\" Who knows as there is really no such measure in music.... Compositions - 5 stars; Performance 5 stars; Sound quality - 4.5 stars.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|There's a reason why Lindsey Lohan is puckering up for Samantha Ronson and it isn't just because girls are cheaper to shop for. With a beat that sticks for hours at a time, it's no wonder girls just wanna have fun. Katy Perry, the 23-year-old daughter of ministers, is celebrating girl power with her debut album, One of the Boys.     \\"I hope you hang yourself with your H&M scarf, while jacking off, listening to Mozart,\\" croons Perry in \\"Ur So Gay,\\" a hip pop dance off to her metrosexual ex. \\"Hot n Cold\\" has an infectious hook, where Perry sweetly claims that her man's ways are a case of \\"love bipolar.\\" \\"If You Can Afford Me\\" should have been a fist-pumping melody for today's material girls, but instead is an acoustic track with pseudo-punk influences. Although One of the Boys isn't a bold, rebellious album, if it's good enough for Madonna, then it may just be good enough for us.    --Stephanie Nolasco    See more music reviews at [...]
B0019IB26I|4.0|I'll get straight to the point. First the negative:     The majority of the performances are terrific, but there are a couple of disappointments. One is including the Free Falling cover, while excluding one of the best (in my opinion) of Mayer's acoustic songs - 3X5. By comparison, the Petty cover is flat and drains the energy out of the short set.    The second irritation I had is with the 3+ minute interlude within Bold As Love. Talking of this nature is ok during the first time or two through the cd, but quickly becomes a source of dread after extended plays. It isn't as bothersome on the DVD, because there are visual distractions. This isn't the case with a cd.    Now the positive:    Except for the interlude, the JM3 set was on fire! I've repeatedly listened to this section and by far, it's my favorite segment of the show.    This isn't a poor album by any means, I just think it could've gone from very good to great, with just a few little tweaks. Continuum will be a very difficult cd to surpass, but this live performance is worth a listen.
0385340567|1.0|I was frustrated by Bad Luck and Trouble but Nothing to Lose takes Reacher to the bottom of my Favorite Series Character list.<br />First of all, I got tired. All that walking roundtrip between towns in the middle of the night! And for what? The plot makes little sense and provides no real urgency. Reacher comes across as petty and mean spirited, certainly not the tough, stoic lead character of Child's first few novels. If anything, Nothing to Lose has a comic book quality to it that disrespects what Child has created in the past.<br />It appears to me this is yet another example of an author writing furiously to comply with a publisher's contract that demands a new novel every seven months.
B00004THAY|4.0|This is the third modern Clapton cd I purchased within a short time. I particularly love the first five tracks on this disc, with the opening title track, Key to the Highway and Three O' Clock Blues being my favorites. The rest of the cd isn't bad, but for me, the first half of the disc is so strong, that I rarely make it to the end. That's the biggest problem I have with this cd and it's really not a problem at all.
0060245867|4.0|And it's still a favorite around here two years later!    It amazes me that this book is almost as old as I am, is of course considered a very popular classic, and yet - I never read it until I was an adult!    Given its age, I'm sure everybody *else* here knows the plot, but just in case, this is a book about a (very logical, I'm sure) series of misadventures that happens after you give something to a mouse. Every request leads to another thing, and another, and another, until the poor boy in the story falls dead asleep.    This book is too cute, and it's funny, too, in a way that both adults and kids will appreciate.    Plus, it's short, which is great for those \\"Oh dear, go to BED already!\\" kind of nights!
B000I5X81A|5.0|This cd is in the laid-back style of JJ Cale. At first, it seemed almost too uneventfull, but with repeated listenings, I've come to appreciate its subtlety more and more.     If you happen to be preparing for an MMA fight, this isn't likely to be your choice for training music. If, on the other hand, you want to get into a mellow mood and smell the flowers for a while, Road to Escondido will take you there in a flash.     I hope there will be a follow-up from these two terrific musicians.
B0018AK9RA|1.0|As Priest fan I was really dissapointed with the Ripper albums. I never expected to be dissapointed with a Halford album. What happened...? and why was that album recorded!? It is so bad. There is absolutely no music in it. The Angel.. was not a masterpeace but really enjoyable and very much Priest signiture. But that.....It is not the shalow lirics I never cared about that it is simply a bad music. I do hope this is not the end!
B000059R8Y|5.0|Unlike the rest of the universe, I'm not a big fan of the majority of Clapton's older Yardbirds/Cream/D&D material. Personally, I enjoy Clapton's more laid back and bluesy modern style. Unplugged and From the Cradle were the first non-compilation cds I'd ever purchased.    Since it's available for barely more than shipping cost, I figured I'd take a chance on Reptile, and it surpassed my hopes. The guitar playing on this disc (Clapton isn't the only performer here) is - to my ears - spectacular. Also, many different musical styles are covered, but not in a tacky way. All efforts here are respectable.    In the end, soothing, yet powerful guitar tone is the primary reason I'm so high on this cd.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Of the 2 war films that Clint Eastwood directed, \\"Flags of our Fathers\\" and \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", the latter film can qualify as Clint's masterpiece. With restraint and sensitivity, Eastwood has shown us how really futile war is and the sacrifices of the ordinary foot soldier, whether they be Japanese or American.  In some quarters, many critics felt Clint should've taken Best Picture and Best Director but the Academy did finally give an long over-due Oscar to Martin Scorsese for \\"The Departed\\".  But who's to say which is the better--like apples and oranges, these 2 films achieved their goals brilliantly. But getting back to \\"Letters\\", special mention should be given to the performances here given by Ken Watanabe as the commander and Kazunari Ninomiya as cook turned soldier. Their performances lend a special poignancy to this film as well as the other performers in this film.  The battle scenes are just as powerful as those in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" though one should remember that Spielberg was one of the producer of this film as well.  In HD DVD, these scenes are brilliantly delinerated.  Highly recommeded.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I became a real fan of John Mayer's after the Continuum cd, which is still my favorite album of the last five years. I saw him in concert last year, and he was spectacular. Each time I hear Mayer on guitar, I'd swear that he visited the Crossroads since the last time I heard him; he just gets better and better.    I enjoyed this concert, and for those who've never seen Mayer live, this will be a suitable substitute. In my opinion, some of the material doesn't convert well to cd listening, but the DVD is excellent and worth the money.
6305313687|3.0|I really don't know what to tell you except I bought this show for a friend. She said it is about a guy that goes to prison and turns his life around. When I seen it it didn't seem like my kind of movie so I didn't watch it. She liked it thru. You might need to go off other reviews b/c I can't give a true review since I never seen it.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|Great movie. Good action and great plot.  Not quite used to seeing Danny Glover play the bad guy, but he did and excellent job.  Even the women I know that have seen this say it is a great thriller and keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Dale Morse<br />Fort Worth, Texas
B00005N6KG|5.0|Good product - I've used it before - delivered on time at a competitive cost
B000M341QE|3.0|Two scenes in the movie that make this not worth watching for me.  The first one is when all the troopers are celebrating at the station and the secretary or whatever she was brings Matt Damon that coffee mug with wine and he thanks her for it, and then she looks at him and the camera focuses directly on her and she says,\\"No, thank you.\\"  WTF!!!!  Corn.   The second scene is when they are having the funeral for the troopers and they give them the old twenty-one gun salute.  They cut to a group of cops around Matt Damon and when one of the shots rings out from the rifle detail, the whole group flinches.  These are people that knew a shot was coming and they still jumped like they had no idea.  Small things like that generally can ruin a movie for me and this was no exception.  Leo can also ruin a movie as well so you throw him and Baldwin in the mix and it's a all out crapfest.  Save your two and half hours you are going to waste watching this movie and read a book or head to the gym or something.
B00005V9IK|1.0|Anything below 90 IQ and you'll have no idea about what I'm talking about. People say that with movies like this you have to leave your brain at the door, the problem is, they don't tell you just how much you have to leave behind. Well....With this movie, the only way you can accept it, is to bring 10% of your brain. Any logical aspect of your mind will be thoroughly insulted with the whole concept and the lame a** storyline with an unbelievably predictable plot.     In this movie, the director and writers are saying \\"Your so stupid, that we can feed you any crap and bull and you'll take it like a fish\\". And by looking at the reviews here, it certainly seems to be just that. Here is SOME of my list of amazingly craptastical issues I personally had with the movie. Lest I had accidentally brought 15% of my brain had been a mortal life changing mistake.     (Wife/Tunnel/Fireball) Wife in car sees fireball coming at her, has time to get out of car, run long ways down tunnel, find a door in tunnel, try to open door but locked, kick door down and get in all while the exploding blast took 5 min to get to here, but it didn't end there. When she got in the door she realized her dog was missing. Still fireball blasting in her direction had time to call her dog. Dog responds and starts running in her direction and jumping just in time to miss the fire blasting behind him.     (Wife/Husband/Desert) Husband wandering aimlessly in desert just happens to run into his wife who happens to be caravaning with America finest trailer trash park.     (Amazing Virus compatibility) Mac is a great computer, but it's amazing just how the aliens had the same operating system as we do that we could download a virus to their computer. AMAZING!     (Trailer trash F-14 pilots) All our skilled highly trained F-14 pilots are all dead, but the planes somehow all survived.   \\"Any of you trailer trash have flight experience?\\"     (Highly Skilled Alien Pilots out piloted by trailer trash pilots) I havenothing more to say on this one.     I honestly looked forward to this movie and am more than willing to leave my brain at the door, but there are some movies, as such, that is so horribly written and insults your intelligence so bad, that even when leaving your brain behind that you just can't get by how dumb they think you are.     On another note, I'd like to accredit the people who had done the special effects. Where the people who had put months into perfecting the explosions and overall graphics of the movie, the screenwriter had only spent a half day on writing his quality script. It's sad to see so much hard work done, only to be insulted by a half as* job of writing. My review may not be the popular one, but I'll be damned before I ever suck up to this crap.
0553277472|5.0|Despite the high brow reviews by self proclaiming philosophers and intellectuals who think this is a book about philosophy, it is not. It is also not a \\"how to\\" manual on maintaining a motorcycles.<br />This is a book about overcoming intellectualism and becoming whole. If you are contemplating reading this book please disregard the reviewers who flex their imaginary philosophical and intellectual muscle and just read it. Yes, there will be parts that seem to endlessly pursue some thought or idea but by the end of this book you will be very glad and satisfied you read it.<br />...of course if you have ever ridden a motorcycle, experienced the landscapes temperature changes, sounds and elements and/or struggled with and beat mental illness this book will take on a special dimension.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|The power that emanates from this soundtrack is incredible!  The driving theme that plays whenever Batman is onscreen is amazing.  I love the theme they gave him.  And the Joker's theme is just creepy.  Very fitting for Heath Ledger's performance.  Two-Face's theme is the most interesting by far because it's almost sweet in it's inevitable tragedy.  There are some themes carried over from Batman Begins so if you don't own that one, this one will definitely give you the best of both movies.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|While their last album came up a little short, QOTSA are back on track with this latest album. \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" is the pound for pound juggernaut on here leading in to the whacky arithmetic glam rock of \\"I'm Designer\\", were Josh Homme plays the part of a pretentious Gen-X cad over a squacking Gang of Four guitar. But the strongest, most solid song is \\"3's & 7's\\" an arena ready radio anthem right out of the nineties. Still, the best band of this decade.
B00005AG7K|1.0|Unfortunately both DVDs I received from Amazon of this movie had problems with sound at the end. Check yours! When they go into the tent, and George sings and plays, the words don't keep the same time as his mouth. And during the last song the Beatles sing,(coming downstairs in tuxes, etc.), you cannot hear the singing.  Otherwise, I love this movie, because it's the Beatles. These are just bad copies. I hope Amazon gets some new ones.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|this movie really was made for the big screen. i saw it in imax which was the very first real hollywood movie i had ever seen on the imax screen. they gave us these necklace speed racer passes, and i sat down and watched one of the most enjoyable movies i have ever seen in a movie theater. i assumed this had a lot to do with the fact that it was on the imax screen. then, i watched kung fu panda on the imax, which was good but did not impress me as much as speed did. then even more recently i saw dark knight in the imax. its a fantastic movie, but made my friend sick, and was overwhelming on such a large screen. speed racer remains the greatest imax experience of my life, and has left me with a great desire to obtain this dvd. movies these days are so similar in the ways they are made, and yet speed racer shows us filming of a 1960's cartoon put into real time and it shines like an idea being born. soo, o not to mention christina richi has never really looked hotter... very cute. i dont really call it cartoon-y. to me its greatly artistic, and unique. very very unique. this is going to be the most under rated movie of the year and i think its because people saw it as a kids movie. really enjoyable for anyone. and i am serious, anyone
B00009W0U4|5.0|I'm still not sure what this movie did to me, or how I feel about it. All I know is that 1 minute after it had finished, I said, \\"this was one crazy intense flick\\". 10 minutes after it had finished, I was still sitting in front of my TV, just staring at the blank screen. 20 minutes after it had finished, I was crying. The movie is not easy to watch, not only because of the subject matter. The first 15 minutes or so might even make you feel tempted to turn it off because of the nauseating camera work (it did that to me). Bear with it! Soon enough you'll realize that the jarring filming does not last long, and has a purpose. This is not just a movie, it's a heart-rending experience. This is an example of a film done not for shock value (even though it is shocking indeed), but in order to tell a story and deliver a statement. I would highly recommend this, but if you can't stomach extremely graphic, realistically filmed scenes of violence and rape, then you should probably think twice before seeing it.
B000BTC5LW|2.0|Forgive me...and forgive me David Gilmour. For years he is my hero (speaking as a fellow guitar player) but the audio and video quality is quite bad. I know they had issues with transferring to DVD and I am heart broken.   I purchased 2 copies of this concert, excited because I had waited so long to compliment my sister's and my VHS version, and am now too embarrased to send my sister her copy. I am returning both to Amazon and hope they compensate adequately since one copy is opened.  Video quality is quite bad, and much of the concert is so blown out with bright white light, that zero detail is retained, (for a good part of the concert!) compared to VHS version. Audio quality will make even the best speakers sound tinny or rumble from bass.  David is my hero and I know he was reluctant (and worked hard) to make this on DVD, but I will stick with my VHS version. It is like night and day, quality-wise) by comparison.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|People have told me for so long to check this show out, so I finally caved in. All I can say is, I can't believe this show got canned! It's truly one of the best sci-fi shows ever created, and it manages to be such without over-costumed and over-madeup characters, monsters, or eye-popping effects. I was hooked from the first episode. Tight cast, great premise, competent writing, wonderful atmosphere. The chemistry between these actors is amazing. It's a shame a gem like this gets pulled off the air after only one year while complete trash stays on for season after season. If you like great, intelligent sci-fi, treat yourself to this, you won't be disappointed! Oh, and for all those who complain about them \\"swearing in Mandarin 'cause it's cool\\"... They don't do it 'cause it's cool, they do it because it makes sense. Read up on some history. People assimilated into another culture are bound to adopt said culture and its language. After years (decades? centuries?) of Chinese-American alliance, why wouldn't these people be fluent in Chinese? DUH.
B001608QVS|5.0|Great job Warner Bros. Home Video,this is a Blu Ray/Dirty Harry fans dream come true,great visuals,sound and extras of the highest Blu Ray quality,the set's a little high on the price tag but if you're a Dirty Harry fan than it's worth it,and the price will likely drop in the future as Blu Ray gets more popular!!! Like I said before,a stellar Blu Ray box set!!! Recommended!!! A+
B000068IEU|1.0|...Because it's hard to believe that the same man who brought us Nightmare on Elm Street would produce such absolute trash. Reminiscent in subject and feel to \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\", this movie, unfortunately, has neither the depth nor the horror of this aforementioned classic. I didn't find the violence to be all that graphic. It's not directly shown, but rather very strongly implied. The criminals are impossible to take seriously. The only thing criminal about them is their sheer stupidity. The acting is sickeningly bad. I don't know what the actresses' blank expressions are meant to convey (shock, perhaps?), but they fail miserably. What really put me off about this movie wasn't the bad acting or the lame script. It was how its overall mood jumped, in a rather bizarre and completely incomprehensible way, from twisted sadism to lighthearted humor. For example, the two cops looking for the crooks are used as comic relief throughout the entire film. My only question is, WHY? Was Wes Craven not sure whether to make a dark comedy or a horror/thriller? Moot point, I'd say, because it works as neither.
0525950079|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book!  If you like historical fiction this is a perfect book for you.
B00003CWPL|2.0|Not an easy movie to review. There's definitely symbolism here and, as most other Lynch films, it makes sense, even if only on some deeply subconscious level. Was it an interesting ride? Yes. But did I enjoy it? No. I didn't enjoy it not because I didn't \\"get it\\". I didn't enjoy it for the same reason I wouldn't enjoy looking at a car crash, or at a dead body in the morgue. Yes, I may stop and stare, just like scores of others, gripped by morbid fascination and compelled by my illogical, contradictory human nature. But I would not enjoy it. Some may say that movies this dark and disturbing are not to be enjoyed - and I will respectfully disagree. Shindler's List wasn't enjoyable to watch either; the enjoyment came not from the visual, but from the emotional fullfilment that the film brings the viewer. If you want a more relevant comparison, I would say see \\"City of Lost Children\\" - while it's also Bizarre with a capital B, there are nevertheless an original and imaginative plot, a rich world, and intriguing characters. There was none of the above in Eraserhead - at least, not in the traditional sense. If you want to see social commentary, deeper underlying meaning, and/or startling revelations, you probably will. But it's more possible that you'll see Eraserhead as nothing more than a collection of bizzare, disturbing, ugly images and sounds compiled to confuse and perturb the viewer. You might peruse the Internet to find frame by frame \\"guides\\" to this film - and that, to me, is an indication that no matter how original, Eraserhead is not true art. Hide it away and bring it back out a couple hundred years from now, and no one is going to understand it. True art does not need manuals or explanations, it speaks for itself. It survives the test of time. Eraserhead is not art; it is more like a nightmare - you know it's trying to tell you something, but you don't understand a thing, and you can't wait for it to end.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|The casting brilliant, the costuming obviously done in conjunction with the BBC, even the cinematography was superb, but it had NOTHING to do with Philipa Gregory's rather brilliant novelization of the most scintilating period of English history.    I bought the film knowing that it would be at best a watered down version of the book, time constraints, ad nauseum, but I had hoped it would at least be coherant. It isn't.    If one approaches the movie, forgetting that these people actually lived and changed the course of the Catholic Church in England, for a romantic escape, you should be well pleased. If you ARE familiar with the actual events; do NOT do this to yourself. An absolute waste.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I disagree with whoever said that this is for those who were born before 1955. I was born in the 70s, but I have been a Beatle fan since I was 12, and could easily relate to the film. That said... I don't know what other people's problem with Across The Universe is. \\"There's little plot\\", say some - it's a MUSICAL! I'm yet to see a musical that's heavier on the plot than it is on the music. And here, the lack of a deep plot and complicated character development is compensated aplenty by gorgeous visuals and great music. Normally I'm not a fan of \\"style over substance\\", but I can't deny that this was positively the most delightful movie experience I've had in a while. Yes, the film has problems. Poor editing being the worst. You could easily cut out at least two long scenes, namely the \\"Dr. Robert\\" and the \\"Mr. Kite\\" ones. Even though Bono was surprisingly good as Dr. Robert, those scenes and characters did absolutely nothing to advance the story, and felt like an all-too-long acid trip (not that I know what that feels like, but one can speculate). I would have loved to see those scenes replaced with something more relevant, which would have been easy to do, given the wealth of amazing songs at their disposal. But overall, this is a touching and beautiful film, at times bizarre, other times sad, and so sweet towards the end that it might give you cavities. Definitely unique, and definitely worth seeing.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I purchased two arms for a dual monitor setup.  Setting up was not that difficult and adjustment options are pretty impressive.  The only problem I encountered was with using one of the hex wrenches to loosen and tighten the joints.  One literally snapped under the pressure, so be careful with the included tools which seem to be of much lower quality than the arms.  Both arms work very well for adjusting height, position, and rotating the monitors between landscape and portrait modes.
0895260131|5.0|Let me add my voice in support of all of the others who have given this book 5 stars. The message of this book is very much non-PC and one we would rather not hear but for those of us who espouse Western values such as democracy and equality of rights for every human being this book is a necessary read. The strength of the book is its documentation.  All of the books assertions about Islam are well supported with references to the Koran and other Islamic sources. It should be required reading for every American, especially our elected leaders and members of the press. There is a lot of information packed in this book and I could only take in a chapter or two at a time in order to assimilate the main concepts. Some may find the section on the Crusades slow going. My advice is to persevere. It is well worth it. Many will not like the message but rather than attack Mr. Spencer, please point out where exactly he has gotten it wrong. It doesnt appear that he has. He has made a compelling case.    This book is a great first step in understanding the forces that seek to destroy the US and subvert western ideals. I look forward to reading other books by Mr. Spencer and authors such as Andrew Bostom, Wallid Pharis, Bat Ye'or, and Ibn Warriq to name a few. Mr. Spencer is a true patriot in writing this book. His website Jihadwatch.org is one of several that is an excellent site for rational analysis of the current threat to the west.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay stretches themselves a little bit in this one, with some different instrumentation than they've used in the past. Bringing in Brian Eno as producer definitely added an unusual and welcome flavor to this project. While in my opinion \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" still remains their best album to date, \\"Viva La Vida\\" slips effortlessly into the second place slot. It's livelier than \\"X&Y\\". Coldplay delivers the goods with another collection of gorgeous anthems and breathtaking ballads.

B0002Z9HT8|4.0|Those of us who didn't have MTV in 1985 really did get the Royal Shaft (...plus those of us working that afternoon received an additional shaft of a lesser degree).  Years were spent trying to cobble together something this comprehensive from friends' collections.<br /><br />While there is no denying the heartfelt intent and the wonderful quality of this package, there is a part of me absolutely furious at the exclusion of some songs.  The Plant/Page/Jones performance was a subject of much media discussion, and while the guys felt their showing was below their standards, they made a generous donation to the Band Aid Trust.  Fair enough.  Having actual VHS of that performace and comparing it with Knebworth 1990 and the Atlantic Records Anniversary performance, I disagree personally but can understand their point. My issue is that I've got VHS of Ultravox performing \\"One Small Day\\" and I don't see anything there making it subpar compared to the included performances on \\"Vienna\\" and \\"Dancing with Tears in my Eyes.\\"  On the other hand, only after getting this set did I see Judas Priest's performance (yes, yes, there's Youtube but 55\\" vs. a tiny window on the monitor...) and there was an obvious feedback issue during \\"Living After Midnight,\\" yet it's included!<br /><br />In a way, I see Live Aid as probably the zenith of Live Rock Music, before technology made electronic aids and digital backing a real issue, and before light shows and effects were so meticulously programmed that it limited space within the songs to improvise.  And the entire event was available to watch!  There were no \\"passengers\\" on this gig.  Some better than others, but everyone out there from Bryan Ferry to Bryan Adams had to pull it off, live, in a neutral venue with minimal prep and for the most part nailed it.<br /><br />Even if there are \\"warts\\", the feedback in the Judas Priest set, a little clumsiness with the camera guy onstage trying to capture Freddie during Queen's set, it's how it happened; and to include these bits, and exclude \\"Drive\\" from the Cars, with minimal flaws, or Black Sabbath other than Paranoid, just flat-out baffles me.<br /><br />So while what I've got is certainly of impeccable quality-- far beyond my own dubbed and redubbed VHS dating back 20 years. Having Queen's legendary set alone on DVD is probably worth the price alone.  I'm just really peeved that after laying down my money I still can't watch Black Sabbath's full set on my own TV. With the space available on DVD, would it really have made that much difference to cram a little more in, or maybe add another disk or two if that's what it took?bits, and exclude \\"Drive\\" from the Cars, with minimal flaws, or Black Sabbath other than Paranoid, just flat-out baffles me.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|If you are sick to death of \\"Whinehouse\\" and her crack-smoke halo, then move over to Duffy. There is nothing here to disappoint, not the music or the message. How can one so young cast such a spell? Plaintive and soulful, Duffy has a unique sound- and she vocalizes experiences we have all had to deal with. \\"Stepping Stone\\" is by far the best piece, although most will recognize \\"Mercy\\" from the air-play. My only complaint- \\"Ready for the Floor\\" is not in the mix. Check YouTube for videos to get the real flavor of the Duffy experience.

0553381687|4.0|Well, I'll tell you. There's nothing like reading this series to really make you greatful to live in a republic, or just about anything other than an oppressive, authoritarian land where one person runs the whole show. Yeesh!<br /><br />This book is the start of what is technically a fantasy series. It draws heavily off real history (most notably the War of the Roses), and actually contains surprisingly few fantasy elements, at least at first.<br /><br />The characters (all twelve million of them), are generally well-drawn, and there are certainly those I like spending time with and those I don't. The setting is fairly imaginative, if somewhat iffy (I really, really get annoyed at fantasy realms where they have institutions that date back thousands upon thousands of years, but in all that time the surrounding cultures and technologies haven't changed one bit).<br /><br />The writting, as I've come to expect from other Martin works, like the Wild Cards series, is fast-paced and interesting, with plenty of political intregue, plotting and scheming as well as lots of blood and gore.<br /><br />But, boy, I'll tell you. By the end of the book I was thinking \\"To blazes with all these kings and their game of thrones. Where's a good ole fashioned peasant uprising when we really need one?\\"<br /><br />Still, vastly entertaining and worth reading!
B00000295A|4.0|The first release of a band that currently doesn't sound like it used to on this album, circa 1993, which makes it a cool retrospective like looking at an old photograph. Probably this album has the real essence of what Jamiroquai was when the band disguised as eco-terrorists rather than trying hard to sound like Stevie Wonder remixed.<br /><br />Good one and, maybe, even better than some of their subsequent releases.<br /><br />DON'T expect mainstream songs or big dancing-floor hits!!! However, very good music is granted indeed except for one or two experimental songs...<br /><br />Recommended for those trying to keep appart from the mainstream, but not yet on the alternative side.

0312427999|1.0|Naomi Klein's \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" is about as enlightening as Rush Limbaugh's \\"See I Told You So\\" or Ann Coulter's \\"If Democrats...\\".  Mrs. Klein is a self-identified \\"democratic socialist,\\" and this book is filled with truthiness from that perspective.  In Mrs. Klein's myopic world view, Nobel-prize winning economist Milton Friedman is somehow an insidious character plotting the manipulation of third-world inhabitants.  Unfortunately for Mrs. Klein, readers of Friedman know that he in fact embraced charity for third-world countries and demonstrated a concern for the inhabitants of those nations.  Let's remember that Pinochet went to Friedman, and not the other way around.  Pinochet was a ruthless dictator, even if he was an economic liberator.  Friedman posited that, in order for real freedom to occur, economic freedom was a necessary condition, but he also stated social freedom was logically the other condition for true freedom.  In this way, Klein demagogues a very easily demogoguable situation with regard to Peru.     Third-world inhabitants have always been subjected to statist economies, and countries that have liberalized their economies are no longer in third-world conditions (case in point: Hong Kong). Mrs. Klein seems to imagine a distinction between her view of statism and other dictators' views. Unfortunately, none of these statist philosophies has helped the world's poorest.  Statism has always had the same face, as has true liberalism (libertarianism, in the US today).     Mrs. Klein is also a protectionist, who stridently opposes globalization.  Once again, unfortunately for Mrs. Klein's case, no rational economist (excepting Marxist-Leninists) today believes protectionism works.  Economists are in unison in embracing globalization as the panacea for world poverty.  More government is certainly not the answer.

0312305060|5.0|I am the last person I know to have read THE HOURS. I admit I delayed for mostly wrong reasons, put off by the success of the popular movie, and then by hearing that is was a reworking of one of my favorite books, [[ASIN:0151009988 MRS. DALLOWAY]] by Virginia Woolf. I still haven't seen the movie, but within the first few chapters of the book, I realized that this was far from being a mere spin-off. Michael Cunningham seems virtually to channel Virginia Woolf, not only capturing her style and sensibility, but revisiting her deepest concerns to show their relevance to the setting and mores of our own day.<br /><br />I cannot imagine how it would be to come to THE HOURS without having read MRS. DALLOWAY first. The distinctive structure of that book -- an hour-by-hour account of a single day in the life of a woman as she prepares to give a party in the evening -- is copied in each of the three interleaved stories that make up Cunningham's novel: Virginia Woolf herself, living near London in 1923, beginning work on MRS. DALLOWAY; Laura Brown, a young wife and mother in 1949 Los Angeles, preparing for her husband's birthday dinner, reading the Woolf novel, and beginning to question her life; and Clarissa Vaughan, in New York City at the end of the century, preparing for a party in honor of an old friend who once nicknamed her \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" The three stories move forward together, hour by hour, paralleling the progress of the book, and linked to one another by a series of references (such as the yellow roses that crop up in all three stories) that give a little lift of recognition each time they occur. But there is nothing systematic about this; the action seems natural, not preordained. When Virginia thinks about the novel, for example, she at first plans something rather different from the book she finally wrote; we see her ideas for the book changing over the course of the day, in response to her emotional reactions to its small events. So when even the model is fluid, the stories that are patterned after it can be fluid too.<br /><br />And then there is the style. When writing about Virginia or Laura, Cunningham uses a straightforward modern style, but he writes of Clarissa uncannily like Woolf might have done, had she been living in New York in the nineteen-nineties. For example, as she sets out: \\"The vestibule door opens onto a June morning so fine and scrubbed Clarissa pauses at the threshold as she would at the edge of a pool, watching the turquoise water lapping at the tiles, the liquid nets of sun wavering in the blue depths.\\" A little overwrought, perhaps? But read on: \\"New York in its racket and stern brown decrepitude, its bottomless decline, always produces a few summer mornings like this.\\" That is New York all right, not a translated Bloomsbury. It is quite amazing how beautifully Cunningham balances the reflective mental imagery that is the hallmark of Woolf's style with a practical sense of urban life as it is lived today, with its share of street people, oddballs, AIDS, and four-letter words.<br /><br />Yet structure and style alone do not make a novel; Cunningham uses his three stories (which ultimately interconnect, though in a slightly artificial way) to develop themes that are also central in Woolf's own work. Most obviously, there is the role of women. All three, at some point in the day, question what they are doing, and attempt small escapes that may be harbingers of something larger. This is clearest in the story of Laura Brown, who apparently lives the American dream, so her growing unease raises questions by coming from left field. Virginia's end by suicide is prefigured in a prologue, and Clarissa, by contrast, seems already to have made her break for independence, living openly as a lesbian and having a child by a donor. Woolf touched lightly on gay themes in MRS. DALLOWAY and elsewhere, but Cunningham develops these a lot more explicitly, enabling him to examine many more shades of the sexual spectrum than his model, but always honestly and often with a touch to stop the heart.<br /><br />But the quality that Cunningham captures best, I think, is the very essence of MRS. DALLOWAY:  the sense of looking back at the past from middle age. The third Clarissa chapter (pages 89-98 in the paperback) is a perfect distillation of the bittersweet scent of past loss intruding on present contentment. Perhaps if I put together a few sentences from the end of that chapter, I can have Michael Cunningham say it better than I can: \\"She could, she thinks, have entered another world. She could have had a life as pleasant and dangerous as literature itself. Or then again maybe not, Clarissa tells herself. Venture too far for love, and you renounce citizenship in the country you've made for yourself. You end up just sailing from port to port. Still, there is this sense of missed opportunity. Maybe there is nothing, ever, that can equal the recollection of having been young together. Maybe it's as simple as that.\\" And then the very last lines of the chapter: \\"There is still that singular perfection, and it's perfect in part because it seemed, at the time, so clearly to promise more. Now she knows: that was the moment, right then. There has been no other.\\" But Clarissa, nonetheless, is content.lways honestly and often with a touch to stop the heart.

B00005JPS8|5.0|Whereas I did read the occasional IronMan comic and Avengers mag all the time, I wasn't sure what to expect on the screen.  With so many comic book superhero films, you don't know which era the producers will choose over the other.  Beings as many artists have penned Iron man over the years.  I think the writers did a good job of taking the best of IM and play a bit with his origin, but it worked mostly.  It wasn't predictable in that he had to perfect his suit and test it, all the time thinking he was sure of himself, and there lies the comedy of the repeated failed attempts before he came close to perfecting the flying/weapons aspects.<br />I was never bored watching it in the theater, and when it was over wanted to see it again!<br />I look forward to it's dvd release and any morsel of extras it comes with!

The remastering is okay making the sound quality on this mlps version of the album pretty good.<br /><br />Given the hefty price tag on this baby in order to justify upgrading from your existing copy, it has got to be a major improvement at least from the aesthetics of the cardboard sleeve and the sound quality.  Fortunately, the cardboard sleeve is very well designed and assembled with thicker good quality cardboard which is so well assembled that you don't fear it coming apart when the glue wears out.  Also included is an insert with all the lyrics in both Japanese and English and 4 bonus tracks: \\"Money Changes Everything\\" (live), \\"She Bop\\" (live), \\"All Through the Night\\" (live) and \\"Money Changes Everything\\" (Summer Sonic '07).<br /><br />The remastered sound quality although not the greatest that I've heard is still pretty good, the excellent mlps design and assembly and Cyndi's best overall consistently good content over the space of an album make this a worthy addition to any music fan's sonic library.<br /><br />Recommended!

B00005JPY0|5.0|Three years ago, director Christopher Nolan (\\"The Prestige\\") successfully resurrected the `Batman' franchise after its unfortunate demise at the hands of Joel Schumacher (\\"Batman Forever\\" & \\"Batman & Robin\\"). Nolan's vision for Gotham City's dark hero was grounded in a more realistic world than the previous four movies had been, gone was the camp and unnecessary nipples on the batsuit from Schumacher's version, and in was an authentic, true to the comic book interpretation of the brooding hero, complete with darker villains, much more realistic weapons and gadgets, and some of the best acting and storytelling of any of the Bat's incarnations this side of its comic book origins. After \\"Batman Begins\\" sustained a solid run at the box office and on DVD, fans eagerly awaited to see just what this new franchise would do with the story that was setup in the final moments of `Begins' when Lt. Gordon showed Batman the Joker card. Now, here we are in 2008, and the anxiously anticipated sequel has been released and let me tell you \\"The Dark Knight\\" definitely delivers, successfully building upon the outstanding groundwork that had been laid by \\"Batman Begins\\" and going beyond my own, and many others, expectations to create an awesome experience at the movies.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" picks up sometime after the events depicted in the previous film, as Batman (Christian Bale) is continuing his crusade to take back Gotham City from the evil, corrupt men that have held sway over it for so long. Assisting Batman in his fight for justice are his trusted allies Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman), his former love and Assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhall), his butler Alfred (Michael Caine), his tech supplier Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), and a newly appointed District Attorney named Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart). With as much help and support as Batman is getting in his quest, it would seem that victory over the forces of darkness may actually be possible; however, a new evil is emerging in the form of the maniacal Joker (Heath Ledger). A twisted man with the simplest of intentions, to plunge Gotham City into complete and utter chaos, and God be with anyone that gets in his way. As this new threat tests the limits of not only Batman, but the very citizens of Gotham City, it seems that perhaps evil may finally have the last laugh.    Wow. \\"The Dark Knight\\" is one of the best comic book inspired movies ever put in front of a camera; in fact calling it a comic book movie is almost inaccurate as this movie has more in common with a crime thriller than your standard comic book film. Sure, the movie features characters that are somewhat larger than life, and the main character dresses himself up in a batsuit; but the storytelling is done in such a realistic fashion that it allows the movie to transcend the barriers that typically surround the traditional comic book movie. Gaining respect and acclaim from critics all throughout Hollywood, a new concept for most comic book inspired creations, \\"The Dark Knight\\" may possibly be the first of its kind to be viewed more as a respected mainstream action/drama than just another comic book movie.    The screenplay for \\"The Dark Knight\\" as crafted by director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan, based on a story by Christopher and David S. Goyer (writer of the `Blade' franchise), is an excellent follow-up to the terrific work this team of talented individuals had done with \\"Batman Begins\\". The story is so full of intensity, twists and turns, and a hefty dose of the unexpected, that you really need to see the movie more than once in order to fully appreciate all of the various elements that comprise this entertaining slice of pop culture. The story for \\"Batman Begins\\" was focused primarily on the origin of Batman and his initial appearances in Gotham City, with \\"The Dark Knight\\" the story focuses much more on the escalation of evil around the city that has been inadvertently caused by Batman's continuing quest for justice. This shift in focus allows the movie to become much darker than the previous one, and more of a character study as each of the characters, primarily the hero, are forced to take a good look at themselves and what his or her actions may be having on the increased problems plaguing the city, and whether their contributions are worth the price or not.    The talented cast assembled for this movie is such an incredible ensemble of Hollywood's A-list that it's amazing the story was capable of giving the appropriate amount of attention to them all without some getting lost in the shuffle. Christian Bale delivers what is easily the best portrayal of the duality of Bruce Wayne/Batman, expertly playing the opposing nature the character has with his playboy lifestyle as Bruce Wayne, compared to the intensity and violence that consumes his life as the Batman. Matching wits with Batman this time around is the maniacal Joker, played to cackling perfection by the late Heath Ledger (\\"A Knight's Tale\\"). Heath's performance as the Joker is by far the definitive version of the character outside of the comic books, making all others that have played him pale in comparison. From every facial tick, to the trademark laugh, to his odd pattern of speech, everything about this character is spot on; and Heath has masterfully created one of the most iconic villainous performances in modern cinema, that it may even rival Anthony Hopkin's chilling creation of Hannibal Lecter in \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\". Supporting the two lead actors, if you can truly call them that, as the story gives equal time to almost every one of the primary characters, are returning cast members Gary Oldman, who gets to do so much more with Jim Gordon than he was able to in \\"Batman Begins\\", Michael Caine (\\"Secondhand Lions\\") as trusted butler Alfred, who provides the unwavering support that Batman needs in his continuing war on crime, and Morgan Freeman returning as Lucius Fox, the man that provides all the necessary technology that Batman needs to take back the streets of Gotham City. Joining the series for the first time is actor Aaron Eckhart (\\"No Reservations\\") as Harvey Dent, a man who has a thirst for justice almost as intense as Batman's, although his methods are more by the book than the Bat's; and actress Maggie Gyllenhall (\\"World Trade Center\\") replacing Katie Holmes as Rachel Dawes, a former love of Bruce Wayne's and assistant D.A. to Harvey Dent. This time Rachel is given much more screen time, and a more fleshed out story than she previously had in \\"Batman Begins\\", which is probably a testament to Maggie Gyllenhall being a somewhat better actress than Katie Holmes, not to mention she doesn't come with the baggage that is Tom Cruise.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is, as I said earlier, one of the best comic book adaptations, if not the best (in my opinion), and may also be viewed as more of a crime thriller than a comic book movie. Comprised of intense storytelling (much more so than any of its predecessors), excellent acting, white knuckle action sequences, and numerous twists, turns, and surprises that will leave you begging for more as the credits begin to roll.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B0001NBMEE|3.0|Robert Wagner's performance in this story is very weak and forced, one could even say \\"sappy.\\"  This could have been a classic movie, but there's a reason you probably didn't know a movie version of this classic story existed--there are very poor elements to this movie.  James Mason is strong as usual, but Janet Leigh's performance is also weaker than any film I've ever seen her in.  The cinematography is good.  I can only guess that it must have been a poor directing job to get such contrived performances from two of the main actors.  If you like well acted classic movies, you'll probably be disappointed in this one.  I was.

B00005JPY0|4.0|\\"The Dark Knight\\" is an ambitious film, but it promises more than it delivers. The fault is not in the two main characters: the Joker is very well acted by Heath Ledger; Bale is his usual very convincing self. Maggie Gyllenhaal, however, is wretched, leaving most men in the audience baffled about why either Wayne or Dent care anything for her. The characterization coasts off what Katie Holmes accomplished in \\"Batman Begins\\" -- which tells you just how useless Gyllenhaal was. The plot gives us a good connection between Joker and Dent/TwoFace, though almost to the end I thought they were just setting us up for Batman movie #3 by introducing Two-Face. (Two-Face is a villain in the Batman universe almost as established the the Joker.)    The writers just weren't up to the storyline. For example, the Joker convinces Batman (etc.) that he couldn't have planned the warehouse explosions because he doesn't \\"plan\\" anything. But we've seen all along that that isn't true, as have BM and Gordon: almost everything the Joker does is planned. The two ferries gambit is just weak and sentimental. It could have been a mini-movie on the Lifetime Channel. Besides, the \\"underneath it all everyone is a beast\\" plotline/ perspective/ motivation was already used in \\"Batman Begins.\\" It doesn't work for every Bat-Villian to be trying to reveal how beastial people really are; in fact, it lessens the contrast between the Joker and everybody else. In any case, Batman does not go \\"dark,\\" he just gets a reputation for being lawless (a plotline that has shown up in the comics.) Finally, when Rachel Dawes gets blown up you just feel that Maggie Gyllenhaal deserved it. There are a number of \\"Oh wow\\" scenes using technology that could have - and may have -- appeared in the old James Bond movies. The fight scenes are not well staged or photographed. In short, the writers could not tell a dark story and they failed the concept. A much better example of a story about a crimefighter (a cop) who tries to stop a serial killer by getting into his head, and the effects of that on the cop, is \\"Man Hunter.\\" Where is Frank Miller when you need him?    The one interesting development is Batman's discovery that he is not a \\"hero\\" as DA Dent was. Dent was to be emulated; Batman, we are shown very clearly, is not. The conclusion that Batman is not a hero - first offered by Alfred and then accepted by Wayne - ranks with Katie Holmes' statement at the end of \\"... Begins\\": Bruce Wayne is the mask, not Batman.

B000EHSVQ4|2.0|My husband and I only watched an hour of \\"Kingdom of Heaven,\\" because we could not see or hear it.  Possibly the dvd was defective, because the scenes were so dark, they were hard to see, and the volume was so low, we couldn't hear it.  I'm sure the story is marvelous, but I'll never know for sure.
B000NQR7NO|4.0|The Arctic Monkeys delivered an audacious and brash debut, actually bearing up to their hype when [[ASIN:B000BTDMDC Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not]] hit American shores. It was low-fi teenage rock and sounded it, but the sheer manic thrill carried the album. But now that they are stars, that low-key charm is was what many were looking for in the follow-up.<br /><br />\\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" is basically, a more mature version of the debut, produced more cleanly, with stronger recording skills and a better budget, by a band that is road-tested and better because of it. \\"Brainstorm\\" is the kind of jagged guitar pop-rock that you would expect, and sounds as good as anything on the debut. The almost funky \\"Fluorescent Adolescent,\\" about a former party girl who is dealing with growing up. The album zips by at a breath-taking 37 minutes, fast enough that the generally repetitive nature of the remaining songs might not wear you down.<br /><br />The songs are still rocking and will get you pumped. Just that, strung together, the effect can become tiring. Arctic Monkeys can blast out zingers like \\"Old Yellow Brick\\" and \\"505,\\" but there isn't any sign of artistic progress here. I'd even go as far as to say that \\"Favourite Worst Nightmare\\" could even be a better album than the debut in terms of consistently and craft, but misses the thrill of discovery and the adrenal rush of kids discovering rock. Like sophomore efforts from [[ASIN:B000B0WODA Franz Ferdinand]] or [[ASIN:B000V7KLQ0 The Vines]], they may find themselves melting away from the spotlight sooner than they deserve to.

B00007LTIL|5.0|The Grateful Dead were a band in transition at the beginning of the 1970's. The San Francisco dream was pretty much dead and over with. The Summer of Love had spun into Altamont. The bikers the Dead had fashioned themselves after had turned a Stones concert into the close of an era. When the Dead released [[ASIN:B00007LTIK Workingman's Dead]], it was a tighter album compositional than the earlier albums, and showed the band's (particularly Jerry Garcia) love for roots and bluegress. Gone were the psychedelic jams, in were discipline and a subdued recognitiion of how much was different. \\"Workingman's Dead\\" was a great album by a band that struggled to translate their ideas to tape.<br /><br />But the follow-up, released the same year, was a masterstroke. Opening with Phil Lesh (and longtime Dead-writer Robert Hunter's) composition \\"Box of Rain\\" and closing with a statement of purpose \\"Truckin',\\" this was the Grateful Dead saying goodbye to California and hello to American Roots music. Augmenting the band with members of [[ASIN:B00000257Z The New Riders of the Purple Sage]], \\"American Beauty\\" features nary a Garcia guitar lead, but plenty of his Pedal Steel. It also contains two more Dead classics, Gracia's philosophical \\"Ripple\\" and Bob Weir's \\"Sugar Magnolia.\\"<br /><br />It's not just for those classic songs that \\"American Beauty: became a classic, but for the fact that The Dead were folding all sorts of styles into the mix. There's gospel, harmonies they'd picked up from their friends [[ASIN:B000002J0P Crosby, Stills & Nash]], David Grisman's mandolins, and the immortal line \\"What a long strange trip it's been.\\" It helped to make the album a mixed metaphor: the trip was far from over, yet the path from 1967's [[ASIN:B00007LTIG Grateful Dead]] to now was indeed wide ranging. If one looks closely at the etched glass of the cover art, you can read it both as \\"American Beauty\\" or \\"American Reality.\\"  The Dead had arrived at a crossroads, and as Garcia sang on \\"Ripple\\":<br /><br />\\"If my words did glow with the gold of sunshine<br />And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,<br />Would you hear my voice come through the music,<br />Would you hold it near as it were your own?\\"<br /><br />The band made it plain on \\"Workingman's Dead\\" and \\"American Beauty.\\" They'd left the 60's behind, even if the spirit would stay with them in a beautiful reality. The music would never be as spaced as side long blues-workouts of Chuck Berry, but from this moment on, they were masters of their own reality.did glow with the gold of sunshine  And my tunes were played on the harp unstrung,  Would you hear my voice come through the music,  Would you hold it near as it were your own?\\"    The band made it plain on \\"Workingman's Dead\\" and \\"American Beauty.\\" They'd left the 60's behind, even if the spirit would stay with them in a beautiful reality.

0385340567|2.0|I LOVE the Reacher books and have read them all. This one was very disappointing. Half the book just seems to be Jack traveling back and forth between Hope and Despair. Too much politics and not enough action.  The ending seemed forced.....you finally get to the last page and you say, \\"that's it?\\"    Also...in the other books Jack is always described as being a huge man. In this book he's the same size or smaller than the bad guys.

Not only will she be forced to move to the House of Night to start her Vampyre training, but she will also have to go through the change. The only other option to going through the change is to die.<br /><br />Her new life at The House of Night is different and strange... even for a Vampyre. Her Mark is completely filled in, while a normal fledgling's Mark is usually not so obvious and bright.<br /><br />This novel completely captivated me. From the very beginning, I could not put it down. It was interesting and sexy and intriguing and mysterious... the perfect vampyre novel. I could not put this book down, and I can honestly say that I cannot wait to read the second and third... this is a must-read for everyone!
0930289234|5.0|It's always dangerous to speak in absolutes, but, in my opinion, Watchmen (by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons) is the greatest graphic novel ever.  I don't think I'm alone in this.  Besides the fact that it won the Hugo Award, it has also made a number of top 100 (or whatever number) lists for Best Novel.  In other words, Watchmen is good enough to actually be in the same class as all-text books.<br /><br />In a way, Watchmen is a superhero story, but that is actually only superficially true.  Particularly, only one character has superpowers; the rest are merely people that dress in costumes and fight crimes.  In the Watchmen world, most of these heroes have been retired, though a few remain active.  In particular,  the amoral Comedian continues to do covert operations for the government and the god-like Dr. Manhattan acts as a major deterrent to nuclear war (the story takes place in the mid-1980's, in which the Cold War is close to turning hot and Richard Nixon is still president).  Although only the Comedian and Dr. Manhattan are government-sanctioned, there is also Rorschach, a half-crazed vigilante who has no qualms about killing those who need killing.  In full retirement are the gadget-using Nite Owl, the beautiful Silk Spectre (Dr. Manhattan's lover) and the genius, Ozymandias.<br /><br />The story begins with the Comedian's murder.  Rorschach - who is probably the closest Watchmen has to a main character - begins to suspect a conspiracy to take out other masked men (and women), especially when Dr. Manhattan is forced into exile.  There is indeed something going on, and the majority of the book deals with finding out who is responsible and what he or she is trying to accomplish.<br /><br />In one paragraph, that is the plot, but the narrative is far more complex than can be described in an Amazon review.  There are lots of subplots (even a comic book story within the story involving pirates) and non-linear storytelling that goes back into the past to explain theorigins of most of the heroes.  The characters are also complex (far more than most superheroes at the time this was written):  many have big problems and few are truly heroic.  In addition, of the twelve chapters, the first eleven all have supplemental materials such as fictional book or magazine excerpts that give extra insight into this world.<br /><br />Although these are not familiar superheroes, they are based on certain characters from Charlton Comics and later moved to the DC Universe (it should be noted that this is a DC book).  For example, Rorschach is based on the Question,  Nite Owl on the Blue Beetle and Dr. Manhattan on Captain Atom.  And despite the fact that many superhero stories of its era were child-friendly, Watchmen is not: besides its subject matter, it's complex narrative style may be off-putting to younger readers.<br /><br />But for adults, this book is a real treat that can be enjoyed multiple times.  In fact, every time you read Watchmen, you will get more out of it; the story has that much depth.  Watchmen is not only the graphic novel at its peak, it is novel writing at its best as well.
B000YABYLA|4.0|JUNO<br /><br />I always seem to catch movies after they are done being super popular -- but this movie always will be popular, as it is well done and very good.  Loved the acting.  Ellen Page was super; she is cute, and her character was funny, quirky, and different.  She knew she was different and it didn't bother her.<br /><br />The acting of Allison Janney and J. K. Simmons as Juno's parents was superb.  They were also funny, supportive, and when told Juno is pregnant, they were really calm!!!  Too calm?  Had my young daughter come to me and told me she was pregnant, I would not have handled it as calmly and well as the MacGuff's did.  Perhaps they are better people than I am?  Anyway, I would have totally supported my daughter and been there for her every step of the way -- however, I KNOW I would have totally freaked out when told the news.  Maybe that is just me --<br /><br />What I didn't enjoy about the movie was how Juno -- at first -- seemed uneffected by being pregnant.  How she referred to the baby as IT -- how she seemed to have no restrictions in her young life.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie was how, after a while, Juno wanted to find the PERFECT and RIGHT family for her baby.  I liked how Juno could not get an abortion.  I liked how her family stood by her and were there for her.  I liked that Juno cried after she gave birth and gave the baby up.<br /><br />I would think this movie does not sensationalize getting pregnant young.  I think this movie was entertaining and full of good points; showing young girls that being pregnant and having a child is a huge commitment; one they need to be ready for.  Juno did show this and was also entertaining and had some good family values.  Being there for each other is so important, right?<br /><br />I would recommend JUNO and am glad that I FINALLY sat down and watched it!  Ellen Page is one good actress and I hope we see more of her.<br /><br />Thank you!<br />Pam
B000NVIGC0|2.0|After watching the documentary 'I Am Trying To Break Your Heart', I realize why Wilco cut ties with Jay Bennett. But I miss Jay. He was a vital part of Being There, Summerteeth, and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. While Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett didn't always see eye to eye, their power struggle resulted in great music...especially on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.<br />Historically speaking, turmoil and conflict has produced memorable music.<br /><br />'Sky Blue Sky' is a continuation of the decline of Wilco. It's not a horrible album, but it's not a gem by any means. I cannot think of a single song that is particularly noteworthy. Honestly, can you think of any song on this album that can be compared to the greatness of 'Via Chicago', 'Sunken Treasure', 'Ashes of American Flags', or 'Shot In The Arm'? Name one. Just one.<br /><br />If you study Wilco's entire catalogue of music, you will(or should) notice the lack of originality and creativity on the non-Jay Bennett albums. His production skills are also GREATLY missed. He was as important, if not more important than the founder of Wilco, Jeff Tweedy.<br /><br />I'm extremely thankful that Wilco still does fantastic shows, but I think Jeff needs to make a phone call. ASAP.

B00005JPY0|5.0|The Dark Knight is EASILY the best movie of the year and is the best superhero movie ever done (without a serious 2nd choice even worthy of consideration).  This is a very deep, very dark, psychologically disturbing nightmare transferred to film.  Heath Ledger's maniacal performance as the Joker is chilling.<br /><br />The closest film I can compare The Dark Knight to is A Clockwork Orange, except with a more structured plot.  There is a feel of anarchy for the sake of anarchy in the tactics of the Joker, so it reminds one of that earlier classic, but the difference is that while the Joker is clearly insane and full of love for chaos, he's also the smartest character in the film, and nothing happens from beginning to end that deviates from his carefully planned script.  That's the profound irony of the Joker.  And that's the most disturbing part of all.<br /><br />Fair warning.  DON'T let kids under 13 see this movie unless they are VERY emotionally mature.  This is the kind of mature, psychological horror that makes it to film once in a generation, and it will leave scars on the psyche of the impressionable (as allegedly, it may have done to the late Heath Ledger himself).
B000VBP382|5.0|I have seen this movie on the \\"OXYGEN\\" channel for weeks and finally broke down and bought it.  Yes there are some things that were not in the movie that were in the book, Yes there were some things in the movie that were not in the book. However the story does go on and not skipping a beat of action.  Since buying the movie I have watched it about 10 times in a month.<br />  The scenery is beatiful and so are some of the houses.<br />  I can not tell what part of the movie was the best or which I loved more, cause I loved the whole movie.  Some people said they did not like the movie, but they named Kiera as the reason they did not like it. She was the whole movie cause she played Lizzy, I wonder if they just don't like her?  For I have seen most of her movies and they were all good.  She played the part well and brought out the real Lizzy.<br />  I would recomend this movie to other Jane Austen fans and have already and will continue to recomend this for a while.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|Face it; there isn't going to be a return to the days of British Steel.  That being said, for those of us over 40 who've been listening to Judas Priest since the 70's (except for those non-Halford years), you want to the band to do something new and/or daring rather than try to relive the days of long ago.  This is a good hard rockin' album (not perfect) and the changes in tone and tempo allow it to be an enjoyable listen that can take you through different paces rather than a non-stop speed metal onslaught.  Priest has no business trying to be like the latest psuedo-metal bands of today.  That's mostly hard, fast, unintelligible screaming for the sake of screaming with no purpose other than to be noise (remember...over 40 here.)  Priest makes sense out of metal, much like Sabbath and Iron Maiden.  This is the type of record that makes them rise above the wanna-be-s.
B000GPI2EK|5.0|This is easily the most interesting hard rock release I have heard in the last two years. Along with Down, this band is truly carrying the flag for all the metalheads who aren't totally fascinated by ultra-fast playing and vomit vocals. Each track takes them in a new direction, so predictable they are most definitely not. From the amazing opening track, these dudes play the hell out of it and there's so much going on it stays interesting after several dozen plays. The vocals are a superb fit with the music. As a former fan of Today is the Day, I was pleased to discover they share some personnel with that outfit. The awesome cover art is just the cherry on the cake.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Simply put, if there is any single Blu Ray series you should own after purchasing your first Blu Ray DVD player, this is the series.  Incredible quality, incredible footage.    The only minor gripe, is the Blu Ray DVD version of the series differs from the standard and HD DVD versions of the series as it does not come with the behind-the-scenes footage of how the series was shot.  Having said this, I would not let this small issue prevent you from buying this outstanding series.

B00122M2QU|4.0|The golden days of Sepultura had been long gone, and no matter what former frontman Max Cavalera did, Soulfly could never fill the void.  Now, Max has re-united with his brother and Sepultura drummer Igor to produce Cavalera Conspiracy's \\"Inflikted\\"; an album that isn't perfect, but harkens back to the glory days of Sepultura more so than anything you'll currently hear.  Standout tracks include the opening title track, \\"Sanctuary\\", \\"Terrorize\\", \\"Ultra-Violent\\", and the closing \\"Must Kill\\" display some screeching guitar work and Igor's machine gun drumming, and will be pure, beautiful music to any Sepultura fan's ears.  It's loud, fast, and often brutal enough to make any metal fan smile with glee, and is a step in the right direction for Max Cavalera, and possibly a Sepultura reunion.  Well, maybe not, but a guy can dream right?  All in all, if Soulfly was never your thing and you've been yearning for classic Sepultura, pick up \\"Inflikted\\"; you'll be glad you did.

B000AMU0XA|5.0|Some people judged the album and artist on the basis that the band members were gay... almost obnoxiously so for some.  Even though I disagree totally with the lifestyle and political views, I have to admit that Holly was a pure down and out brilliant musical genius.  He and his band members were also brilliant and extremely talented musicians... virtuosos all!  I danced to \\"Relax\\" in San Diego in the 80's at a big dance club called Confetti's. On a friday night I was with my wife on the dance floor, when as soon as the opening notes to Relax began playing, the drink servers went into a coreographed dance routine on the multi level dance floor and stairs.  The crowd went wild and joined them.  It was an event to be experienced!!!  Holly's music makes you live to dance!

B0000026CM|5.0|1988 was the year that vetran rock band Toto released their seventh album aptly named \\"The Seventh One\\". It was their first album not to feature keyboardist Steve Porcaro as a band member (although he did play on it) and was their last with lead singer Joseph Williams. It was also the final Toto album to yield any successful hits.<br />Musicially, \\"The Seventh One\\" was Toto's most progressive album to date. While it does have its share of pop-rock moments, elements of the '80s progressive rock sound heard in band's like Asia and Yes's 90125-era dominate this album. This makes for one of Toto's most adventerous albums to date without sounding too over the top or bombastic.<br />While previous Toto albums featured various members besides the lead singer taking the lead as vocalist, \\"The Seventh One\\" is pretty much Joseph Williams' show singing lead on all but two tracks - \\"Anna\\" and \\"These Chains\\" which are excellent ballads sung by guitarist Steve Lukather. Keyboardist David Paich is also heard singing on the epic closer \\"Home Of The Brave\\" which is otherwise dominated by Williams.<br />Standout tracks on the album are the three tracks mentioned above as well as the driving rocker \\"Only The Children\\", the Carribean-flavored \\"Mushanga\\" and the power-pop of the album's two hit singles \\"Stop Loving You\\" and \\"Pamela\\" which bears a strong resemblance to the band's all-time classic hit \\"Rosanna\\".<br />For many, \\"The Seventh One\\" marked the end of an era for Toto. It was their last album of the '80s as well as their next-to-last album with drummer Jeff Porcaro (who would pass away in 1992). It was also their last album with a bona fide front man (not counting the four tracks with Joesph Williams' replacement Jean-Michel Byron on the 1990 compilation \\"Past To Present\\") until original lead singer Bobby Kimball returned to the band in 1998.<br />Despite whether this was Toto's last great album or not (I personally think the latter), \\"The Seventh One\\" contains some of Toto's strongest music and is loaded with the band's continued strive for musical excellence. It is definitely excellence that dominates this album in every track from the arrangements to the musicianship and the production itself.<br />Seven definitely proved to be a winning number for Toto with this album.loaded with the band's continued strive for musical excellence.

B0001PBYRW|5.0|Sarah Waters has produced yet another Victorian adventure in creating  \\"Fingersmith\\".<br /><br />Any explanation of the plot would betray some of the plot points and twists.  I will stay away from spoiling the fun of reading through this exceptional novel.<br /><br />Sarah Waters has a talent for portraying many aspects of women in a way that brings them alive in her novels.  Her characters are more than mere stereotypes.  Some might describe them as \\"flawed.\\"  Compared to T.V. heroines, perhaps they are flawed, however, a better way to describe her central characters is to say that they are multi-dimensional and believable.  Many of the characters develope from backgrounds and circumstances to which all of us can relate and appreciate.<br /><br />After a few plot twists, Sarah Waters' heroine finds herself to be a talented \\"fingersmith\\".  A fingersmith is a Victorian term for a \\"pick-pocket\\" or thief.<br /><br />From these common beginnings, much in the way of her first heroine in [[ASIN:1573227889 Tipping the Velvet: A Novel]] her \\"everywoman\\" heroine in \\"Fingersmith\\" encounters one adventure after another to find herself in a plot twist of intrigue involving another woman.  Although this is not as as sensual as her first novel: [[ASIN:B00011Y1QC Tipping the Velvet]], \\"Fingersmith\\" provides a rich ambience of romance and tenderness between the women.<br /><br />The writing is superb, with concise but fluid descriptions of 19th.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Well, I'm skeptical as to whether anyone will even read this review, since amazon.com is being inundated with other reviewers' comments.  But something I have not yet seen on any review (either in the media or on amazon) is how this movie really is more of a theme-driven story, than a typical superhero flick.  Most (all?) other superhero movies are plot-driven -- i.e., their main purpose is to tell the story of a person who dresses up like a superhero to fight evil.  Any themes that exist in these other movies (e.g., X-Men's appeal to equality among all different types of people; Spider-Man 2's suggestion that we have a responsibility to use our talents wisely, for the greater good) are secondary to the plot itself.  The movies, at their root, are about superheroes fighting super villains.    Not so with Dark Knight.  This one seems to be more about the universal existence of evil, chaos, and violence in the real world; and the proximity with which each of us stands to these vices.  It only uses comic book characters to tell the tale.  As such, Dark Knight is a step above pretty much every other superhero/comc book flick that I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot), and aspires to the level of a \\"fine film,\\" not just a summer popcorn diversion.    The Joker is a living embodiment of all that is twisted or evil in the world; he represents any act of crime or violence that is done anywhere, on screen or in the real world.  Batman, Harvey Dent, and Jim Gordon are the characters who show how sometimes it is necessary to descend into the craziness and corruption that is the Joker, even in order to fight it. (Hence Batman's violence on the criminal element, Harvey Dent's penchant, even before his transformation into Two-Face, for intimidating suspects, and Gordon's appeal to a known vigilante in his pursuit of crime lords.)    Maybe I'm over-analyzing the movie, but this take explains the absence of any clear storyline; basically, it is two-and-a-half hours of good guys fighting bad guys.  This take also make sense of what otherwise would be some glaring plot holes -- for instance, why does the Joker never give a clear origin story?  (because he represents any criminal with any origin.)  How does he escape from a building full of people after taking them all hostage? (because some criminals are able to get away, even in public settings.)  How does Joker attract any followers, when he kills everyone who works for him? (because some mafia dons and agents of corruption do attract a loyal following.)  How, when he is the most hunted criminal in Gotham, does he purchase explosives and then wire an entire hospital to explode and collapse without ever being caught? (because real-life criminals sometimes do these kinds of acts, as shown most tragically in the World Trade Center attacks of 9/11).  What is the Joker's motivation?  (He is simply an agent of chaos, representing any evil or chaos that anyone might be guilty of, so he never tells why he acts so insane.)  Why is he never actually shown to be caught in the very end?  (It is implied that he is taken into custody, but never shown, because the evil impulse in the world can never be \\"caught\\" by apprehending a single criminal.)  Why does the camera angle in the end keep showing him as right-side-up when he is really hanging upside-down? (because as an agent of chaos his role is to turn the world upside-down and make what is wrong seem right.)    Even with all this deeply-laden symbolism, the movie still would be somewhat difficult to endure (especially at 2-and-a-half hours) if there were no \\"hook\\" to hang it all on.  Enter Heath Ledger.  I went into the theater wondering if all the hype surrounding his performance was setting me up for expectations that could only end in disappointment.  It did not.  Basically, all the accolades that have been heaped on his portrayal of the Joker are well-deserved.  He is simply amazing as a primal, insane, terrifying villain who at any moment could do anything at all.  I really liked Jack Nicholson's 1989 performance, and I'm not sure it was \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" -- but it certainly was different.  If you have only seen Nicholson, you have not seen an equally-definitive look at the Joker.    To top it all off, Christopher Nolan pulls off such an amazing look at the real world, and the human psyche, and the evil which is such a temptation to us all, in a way that absolutely nails the characterization of all the principal figures.  Batman, Bruce Wayne, the Joker, Harvey Dent/Two Face, and James Gordon all seem like they are lifted right off the comic page and transplanted onto the screen.  I am astounded that a movie about superheroes had this much depth and real-life significance, and was still such a joy to watch.    I'm not sure if this was the most entertaining comic book movie I've ever seen, but it certainly was the most complex and finely crafted.  Both the way the themes play out on the big screen, and the performance of Heath Ledger, continued to resonate in my memory well after I'd seen it.  This movie is simply amazing -- don't miss it.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Received this last Christmas, and watch parts of it at least once a month.  Spectacular footage and commmentary, though I prefer the BBC narrator to S. Weaver.  I read one of the 1-star reviews..Yes, as a part of nature, animals chase and kill other animals.  No big deal.  I would say that \\"violence\\" takes up about 2% of the entire series.<br />I learned a lot and would give this as a gift to anyone who has just bought a Blu-Ray player because this series is visually stunning!

0679731725|4.0|Kazuo Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki in 1954 and moved to Britain at the age of five. He was awarded the OBE in 1995 and the Chevalier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in 1998. \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is his fourth novel, was first published in 1989 and won that year's Booker Prize.     Opening in July 1956, the story is told by Mr Stevens - a butler approaching the end of his career. He has been based at Darlington Hall for many years and, for most of his time there, had served Lord Darlington. While the outside world has changed dramatically since Stevens started out as a butler, the changes within the walls are proving a little more difficult for him. Following the death of Lord Darlington a few years previously, the stately home is now in the hands of an American called Farraday. Unsurprisingly, Farraday is a great deal less formal than Lord Darlington and Stevens isn't quite sure how to relate to his new boss. Furthermore, when once there were twenty-eight members of staff at Darlington Hall, there are now only four. Sections of the house have now been put 'under wraps' - effectively closed down - with fairly radical alterations to what would have been each person's 'traditional' responsibilities. Stevens has become rather worried when some small errors creep into his own work - these, he feels, stem from the slightly flawed staff plan he developed.     Stevens is taken by surprise when his new employer suggests he takes some time off and borrows the car - to the point he, initially, doesn't take the suggestion seriously. However, he starts to change his mind when he receives a letter from Miss Kenton, Darlington Hall's former housekeeper - the first time in seven years he'd heard from her. Technically, Miss Kenton has been Mrs Benn since she left Darlington Hall in 1936 - though it seems, her marriage has recently ended. In her letter she spoke of her time at the Hall as the happiest period in her life and, reading between the lines, Stevens believes she maybe willing to return as a member of staff - an appointment, he believes, that would iron out the kinks in his staff plan. Accordingly, having organised a meeting with his former colleague, Stevens takes a road trip to the West Country. \\"The Remains of the Day\\" follows Stevens on his trip and, as he looks forward to his meeting with Miss Kenton, he looks back on their shared times together at Darlington Hall.     Stevens proves to be a very stiff, formal, nearly snobbish character - one who has become quite obsessed with 'dignity'. He (rather ridiculously) believes that only the English are capable of 'emotional restraint' required to being butlers - though, as time goes on, it becomes clear that Stevens' emotional restraint has cost him more than he cares to admit. His memories of Miss Kenton tend to focus on professional matters, and - while it began and ended a little badly - for many years, it seems they had got on quite well. Stevens' memories, of course, only tell half of that story. Lord Darlington, naturally, also features strongly in his memories. Stevens had been blindly loyal to Lord Darlington - under no circumstances would he disagree ever disagree with his lordship's decisions, publicly or privately. Darlington had fought in the First World War, though - being an honourable gentleman - believed the Treaty of Versailles was excessively harsh on the German people. He had become an important figure in the period between the wars - and, having played host to many influential people during this time, had even tried to shape Britain's foreign policy towards Germany. Unsurprisingly, his reputation has been in tatters since the Second World War. Stevens still feels Lord Darlington was a well-meaning man, though perhaps misguided - though still denies having worked for him several times during the book.     Ishiguro's books are definitely better than most you'll find on the bookshelves, and many people seem to rate this as his best to date. Personally, I thinkhe's done better - particularly with \\"When We Were Orphans\\" and \\"Never Let Me Go\\". However, \\"The Remains of the Day\\" is certainly a worth reading and, despite Stevens' stiffness, it was hard not to feel sorry for him come the end of the book.
B0016IV2G6|3.0|When i first heard about Mr.Kiske's plan to re-record & release this,i wasnt quite sure what to think.  Im really more into his new style,so why would i want to hear him do this \\"helloween unplugged\\" thingy.Its really more about the compositions and not the sounds.I generally think if a song is good it will be good,no matter if its played electric or acoustic..Anway..  The first 3 songs starts off pretty good,but i wish they wouldnt put those trumpet parts in \\"We Got The Right\\"..It doesnt do the song any good and it would be much better off with out it..I also feel that these songs are not really stripped down enough..Please slow down...These songs dont need all those riffs..  Track 4 is my all time favorite helloween song and i wasnt sure what to think before i heard it..I generally dont like remakes of already favorites of mine.If its already perfect,why change it?  But after giving it a spin..Oh boy..Major disappointment..  Why?!?!Kiske?Why?    I wish i never heard this.It makes me sad.All the emotional aspects put into the original are gone.The vocals sounds forced and its like the song is played faster as well?Arg..This is not good Mister.. :(    Your turn - is really nice in the verses,the pre-chorus is not,mainly because of the harmony vocals but also because of the lack of power of the band.It actually sound a bit boring..  But the great chorus makes up for it.:)  Some parts of the solo are weak too..But the last part of the song,from the part \\"The world is crying..\\" it all sounds nice again.    Kids Of A Century - WOW!This starts off really interesting,on this one Kiske has actually manage to create music of out this rather noisy classic.Also,the way this has been arranged proves that not every note has to be picked like the original to sound good.Like the intro section.Just a few powerful strums are enough.I wish they could have done that on the first 3 tracks as well,as they sound a bit fast and forced..Anyway,back to the song again.Its not the most interesting solo i have heard but the instrumental section is still good. :)  Kiske comes back in again,with powerful vocals.This will be one of my favorites from this album..    In The Night - Is another song that sounds a lot better now than on the original cd,it was never a favorite of mine and even if this is better i dont think this re-arrangement will change anything,but the guitar solo is good. :)    Going Home - Has been turned into a serious rocker.Really cool stuff.The way it kicks off and then slows down and builds up again.Really great!More please.:) The instrumental section is very nice as well,but why all the shredding? Sounds like yngwie was there..I think it would sound better without it.Anyway..Overall great work!    A little time - Not much to say here,its not really my cup of coffee..    When The Sinner - Yes,this is good!Very cool sounds used and the playing and production here is really nice as well.The bass in the verse,super cool!!!Awesome performance by Kiske and his band.     The new song is a really nice composition and its well preformed.The  instrumental sections are really beautiful and heart touching.:)    Its really hard for me to rate this album,since im really a big fan.  People should really not compare this to the original helloween albums,but i can understand those who will,since some of these songs really are \\"classics\\" from the 80's..We cant really expect people to just forget about them and those times..Its a good album but some of the songs  sounded a bit forced,meaning that some of them are played too fast,it also sound like they didnt really enjoy remaking them all..  Its like giving Wagner a ukulele and tell him to preform music from The Ring..     After listening to \\"Longing\\" I really wanted to give this album 1 star.But after giving the rest of the songs a few spins i changed my mind.If this song had been left out i would give it 4 stars..But,its possible to skip it using the remote.I think there is something good here for both new and old fans.Im not sure if i would give it a 4 because im a \\"fan\\"..I wish i could give it 5,but i landed on a 3 and i think 3 is fair..
B0011UF79C|5.0|This movie will have you on the edge of your seat, its got suspense, sci fi, with a touch of brave new world. this is not far fetched sci fi at all. this is more or less within our reach now. this movie packs in a powerful life lessons that science cannot always predict everything and that anything is possible.
0143038419|5.0|I think a lot of people missed the point and putting it down before finishing it?  What a loss that would be.  I did not see this as a travel log in the least bit.  I loved her humor how she grapples with her mind and trying to concentrate because Lord knows, I am in the same boat when it comes to focusing and letting all the negative energy out of my head.  After all, my brain isn't a condo and I'm not renting out space to anyone.    I loved how she described her little Ashram buddy only 18 years old.      I probably could have done with out some of the descriptions when it comes to self-satisfying herself, but I don't think it is a big deal in the book and certainly taught me more about looking outside of myself and into myself - as my troubles are minimal compared to some of the people she experienced life with.    It truly is it's title and the fact she separated each stage - well, all the better.  So many wonderful little bits and pieces of life.  Good for her.     Liz, you done good.
141694740X|1.0|A friend purchased this book for me, and the first few chapters were ok.  Yes as ladies we need to stop making excuses and pick up the signs, if a guy isn't into us.  However, I stopped reading after chapter 4, I thought ok, myabe 5 will be better, but then I read the title, and  then the title of chapter six.  Chapter four's title is that he's just not that into you if he isn't haveing sex with you.  Well, let me tell you right here.  If he's the kind of guy I would be interested in, we wouldn't be having sex.  I'm, waiting for marriage, so it wouldn't happen.  Chpater 5 is that he's just not that into you if he's having sex with someone else.  Again, if he's having sex with anyone, he's not waiting for marriage and he isn't the kind of guy I would want any way.  Theses two chapters were followed by He's just not into you if he only wants to see you when he's drunk.... ok seriously.  This book has nothing to do with my lifestyle, nor is it applicable to the kind of guys I would date.  So if you are a Christian or if you are simply waiting for marriage, this is most definitely NOT the book for you!

B001B71NOI|5.0|Reznor has been quite a busy man these past few years. Long gone are the days where fans would have to wait 4 or 5 years for a new album to come out. There is so much NIN news going on right now..it's really great to be a fan.     In 2007, it started with the apocalyptic alternate reality game. Dozens of websites popped up relating to this futuristic mythology of the world. This eventually led to the release Year Zero. A truly great masterpiece composed Reznor. The album featured lyric themes never heard in the NIN world before and sounds that you would never think be considered music. This electronic masterpiece was one of the most creative and noisy albums of 2007.    A few months go by and BAM! Ghosts I-IV was released. \\"A soundtrack for daydreams\\" Reznor describes. He's definitely right. This is the most experimental and \\"out there\\" NIN has ever gotten. From beautiful piano pieces, to trippy guitars, and video game-esque beats, this album was amazing. It still managed to keep that classic NIN sound we all love.    Just when it couldn't get any better, another album comes along. Best of all, it's for free. THE SLIP.    When I first listened to The Slip, I was honestly disappointed. It felt generic and boring, the songs were badly recorded, and there was so much noise you could hardly tell was Trent was singing. I disregarded it for a few weeks before listening to it again.    As I started listening to it more. I began to realize how great it really was. The Slip is so much different from other NIN albums, yet somehow the it goes back to their roots of The Downward Spiral and The Fragile.     The first thing I noticed is the recording of the album. I found it to be sloppy and muffled at first, but now I think that's one of the things that make the album awesome. All the songs sound a like a garage band recording. This makes the music sound raw and in your face. It sounds like the band is playing right next to you. The most notable use of the recording quality I'mtalking about is on \\"Head Down\\".    The flow of the album is superb. There's so much variety in the styles of  the songs, but Reznor (of course) finds a way to make them all flow together. The album feels like one giant song split up into different parts (like a Pink Floyd song).    The albums starts off with 999,999 (Instrumental). The song starts out slow but slowly progresses, adding more and more layers of sounds and noises. Although it's an instrumental song, it eventually builds up with Trent's muffled and chaotic voice, ending with \\"How did I slip into this?-\\".    1,000,000 kicks off with hard beating drums and typical NIN synth riffs. This song is a classic NIN rocker. Very \\"With-Teethy\\". It leads straight into..     Letting You. This song starts out with a complex and fast drum beat before being overtaken by some very noisy bass and synth. There's definitely some Year Zero-esque lyrics here. It ends with an intense bang.    Discipline is the next song. Dark disco is the best way to describe it. It's catchy, dance-able, and full of NIN goodness. Be sure to watch to the \\"music video\\" ;).    Echoplex. This song is very dark, yet fragile. The chorus is really melodic. The ending of the song has a lot of build up and instrumental goodness.    Head Down is the next song. The best song off the album in my opinion. The song starts of very heavy and angry before going to into the epic and beautiful chorus. The end of the song gets intense and chaotic before calming down to a slow and ambient synth. This leads into..    Lights in the Sky. This is the \\"piano\\" song off the album. It really is just Trent and a piano. The lyrics are extremely well written and gives the album a turning point in atmosphere. It flows very well into..    Corono Radiata (Instrumental). This song starts out with 5 minutes of serene ambiance. By the end it quickly turns into a dark and surreal soundscape. A great instrumental.    The Four of Us Our Dying (Instrumental). The dark and surreal ambiance of CR continues with this song, adding more sounds and noises. Pairs really nicely with CR.    Demon Seed. This is a really original NIN song. I really haven't heard anything like it. I can't really describe it well either. You'll just have to listen to it yourself =D. It's a great closing song though.    Overall, The Slip is a really great album. It has a wide variety of songs that go together really well. It will definitely grow on you, so please give it some time. Highly recommended as a first NIN album to listen to. It covers all the areas of NIN, as well as covering some new ones.    Key tracks: 1000000, Echoplex, Head Down, Lights in the Sky, The Four of Us Our Dying, Demon Seed.
B001453LX8|2.0|SO, So, so, I heard an interview with Ms. Badu about this album where she said it was her \\"magnum opus\\". This self-aggrandizing statement made me think that either her ego expands past her brain and into her afro or that the album was in fact really awesome. The one and only other album I have of hers is Baduism and that is a sweet mix of music that I thoroughly enjoy getting down to. SO, So, so, I chose to go with my latter thought and buy the album.<br /><br />SO, So, so, I completely regret my decision. SO, So, so, I completely regret my decision. SO, So, so, I completely regret my decision. SO, So, so, are you wondering why I am obnoxiously repeating myself over and over and over again saying the exact same thing? SO, So, so, are you wishing that you hadn't endeavored to read this review because it's annoying and repetitive?<br /><br />As I listened to this album where Erykah Badu thinks up a line of lyric that she thinks is amazing (and it's not) and then just repeats the same line throughout the song changing only the inflection (if you're lucky), I wondered why she was torturing her listeners with chinese water drip style singing and I wished I hadn't wasted my money on this \\"magnum crapfest\\".<br /><br />It's boring, repetitive, and has all these voice clips that are really distracting.<br /><br />DON'T BOTHER. Don't Bother. don't bother....*fades out*
B00005JPY0|5.0|...that hasn't already been said, but I won't back down from the challenge.<br /><br />I saw it last Sunday. It's breaking box-office records. It is THE summertime smash everyone thought it would be. Which is interesting considering how thoroughly in love with the dark it is.<br /><br />If you told me ten years ago that teen heart throb Heath Ledger would play the Joker and in doing so haunt me with that performance for the rest of my life, I would say that you were on LSD.<br /><br />I guess the word that keeps coming up for me is...haunting. There are so many ghosts surrounding this movie all due to Heath Ledger's untimely passing. I hate to say it, but the fact that Ledger died shortly after making this movie adds something to it. Ledger's Joker is Sid Vicious meets Euronymous. Rather than linger, he explodes, and while you know by film's end that The Joker is still alive, there's still a finality to it all. Who else could play The Joker now? Who else could trump Ledger's anarchist take on this character? Ledger, I believe took The Joker to his grave with him.<br /><br />Insanity is another word that easily comes to mind. What takes someone over the edge? What keeps someone from falling into that abyss? Christian Bale's leading role in American Psycho is recalled here somewhat. You see the duality between Bruce Wayne and Batman as much as you do the two Patrick Batemans. Aristocrat and Demon, except in The Dark Knight, that Demon is pushed into being a force of right in what is in many ways a Hell On Earth (Gotham City) with the leash of conscience holding him from the brink.<br /><br />The twisted Joker/Batman comedian/straight man relationship is also sweepingly explored here. You are left with the impression that all involved in making this film were inspired by modern tales such as Moore and Bolland's classic Batman graphic novel The Killing Joke, in which all buffoonery is further extinguished when it comes to The Joker, and the somewhat perverse relationship between villian and hero is examined. Your laughter is a nervous one, because you just don't know what act of swift, shocking, violent cunning awaits you. The Dark Knight thusly becomes as much a horror or psychological thriller as it is a heroic fantasy swathed in dusk, both figurative and literal. More than ever in any media aside from the comic book realm, we are shown how heroes and villians define each other. Who defines you? Who is your opposite number? What do you stand for, and who stands against that? Do we need enemies? Do we need them in order to show us who we are and what we need to be and do? Or are we not all that different than our foes? What keeps Batman, and all decent men and women from succumbing to The Joker's manic nihilism?<br /><br />As far as the film itself, there were a few things I didn't like. For example...<br /><br />*Some of the fight scenes are disappointing and hard to follow and the makers could and should have taken some lessons from the comics in that area.<br /><br />*As brilliant as Ledger's Joker is, I kept hoping for an even more maniacal performance. A really sinister laugh, REALLY depraved, would have sent the film deeper into the netherworld. I was almost redirecting Ledger in my head at times as I felt that he may have been ever so slightly holding back. I wanted to see that punk/black metalist inside of The Joker just scream and let it all out. Again Ledger's performance is frighteningly sublime, but I kept wanting Alice Cooper on heroin, and we almost got that. It was far different than Jack Nicholson's equally good gentleman Joker from nearly 20 years ago, and I wanted to see that kind of reinvention, but in my opinion, there was something very minute even unnameable missing. Spasticity perhaps? Would that have been too over the top? Had Heath Ledger survived, would his Joker still torment our imagination? Would he still be that bogeyman?<br /><br />*While Ledger's performance, and it could just be me, seemed just atouch restrained, I did feel that at certain points Christian Bale tried too hard to be demonic, his growl even making me wince here and there because it seemed forced. As a long time follower of the Batman mythos, I am aware of how Bruce Wayne alters his voice when in the cape and cowl. However, and again it was just in certain spots, and I can see where Bale was coming from in his portrayal and what discomforts he had to endure, but I felt that he overacted. Some of his lines as Batman sounded as if they were voiced by a pro wrestler.<br /><br />*The Batman headgear wasn't totally to my liking. The hood was too round I thought. When you see Batman up close, he looks slightly silly to my eyes. I also think the eyes should have been covered by clear lenses as they are in the comics. I didn't like seeing the black makeup around the eye.<br /><br />*It may seem like a logical extension, but I really don't like seeing a gliding Batman. It's too obvious.<br /><br />*Do we need another dead female love interest?<br /><br />*I'm not totally sure I liked the makeup running off of the Joker like it did. I prefer the chemically defaced Joker, although I did like that his origin was kept ambiguous and rooted in a brutal, abusive reality.<br /><br />But I nitpick. Is it the purist in me complaining?<br /><br />All of the performances range from good to absolutely superb and Ledger's and Bale's tiny missteps (Is it just me?) are made up for through their respective skills and conviction. The script, the direction, the cinematography, and the special effects all conspire to captivate the viewer with a gloomy, occult grandeur.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is about a lunatic who wallows in and embraces his psychosis and the Grim Hunter who desperately tries not to fall off of the cliff himself while in pursuit. It's about one man who has nothing to lose versus one who has lost everything, gotten it all back, and doesn't want to lose it again; one man who doesn't care at all versus one man who almost cares too much, who carries the weight of his own swarthy, nearly irredeemable world upon his armoured shoulders.<br /><br />Evil vs. Good, Chaos vs. Order, Sanity vs. Madness, it's all here in spades and is what makes The Dark Knight such a magnificent cinematic feast.<br /><br />Thank you Heath. You have given us a career finale that I doubt will ever be rivaled. Thank you for this last gift, one that will continue to haunt us all for generations.le tried too hard to be demonic, his growl even making me wince here and there because it seemed forced.

The good thing though is that it was really gripping more often then not; nice amounts of action, a little blood here and there, and silly college-aged kids dying left and right.<br /><br />It's been over a year since I watched this last and I honestly found myself being pulled in almost like it was my first time viewing it!<br /><br />3.9 stars.
0143038419|5.0|I picked up Eat, Pray, Love in an airport over a year ago. I have been reading it off and on since then and still have not finished it. I am thoroughly enjoying this book. Perhaps the reviewers who left a 1 or 2 star rating read it in one day. Eat, Pray, Love is not to be wolfed down, but chewed slowly. I have found my own spiritual journey through reading this one. Enjoy!
6305692572|5.0|I use this movie as a homework project for my college Abnormal Psychology students to help them learn how to diagnose alcholism (by documenting the symptoms protrayed) and see its devastating effects on people which it demonstrates with remarkable clarity and sobering impact. It also gives a decent glimpse into where the disorder comes from (eiology) and its treatment, but not near as clearly.      Of course, I love Meg Ryan in any movie, but here she plays her part well, as does Andy Garcia who shows both the healthy side of love and its unhealthy side when it rears its head as codependent enabling. Yes, such spouses are to be commended for \\"hanging in there\\" no matter what, but love alone is simply not enough.  For you also have to deal with conflict to have a successful marriage.  So the only area that I would have changed would be to show how Alice's (Meg's) new assertiveness can come together with their love to resolve their issues, and for Michael (Andy) to be able to love her while accepting her new strength without needing to always rescue and do things for her.      But in contrast to so many other movies who show everything magically coming together within one therapy session or \\"aha\\" insight, \\"When A Man\\" avoids the usual Hollywood fantasy to show a more realistic picture. For real change does take time and working through so very much.  So all in all, this is an excellent, superb movie even if you don't have to write a case report on a mental disorder.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|This box is great! All 5 versions of the movie, many many great features, excellent. But pay attention, 3 discs are blu-rays (with the movie versions) and 2 discs are common dvds (with features), be beware. But all great, all very well done! There's no features for Vangelis or his soundtrack. The test for actress hole Pris and Rachel, no contains the Sean Young or Daryl Hanna tests (they says that tests are lost) but only test for Nina Axelrod and the other actress (i don't remember the name) who'd be Pris. There are 2 alternate endings, 1 alternate opening and almost 45 minutes of alternate or deleting scenes. And many other incredible features. I'm so happy, there are subtitles in portuguese (for Blu-ray edition only)!<br />Highly recomended.
0452289963|5.0|The most valuable book I've ever read. If you are truly open and ready, this book will help guide you toward a better life. It doesn't matter what religion you practice, this book will help you find true spiritually in your life - a place of real peace.  He doesn't try to steer you away from any beliefs you may have.  In fact, he quotes many different religions and actually states that when you become \\"present in life\\" you become closer to God.  This book will help you learn how to accept and be happy with your life - as it is now.  I will read this book more than once.  It's deep.  It's amazing.
B0000C6K09|5.0|For those of us that have collected soundtracks for many years and specially John Williams' music, it might seem a little redundant to buy this four disc compliation of his music that has every single track that  I am sure every collector owns at least once.<br />However once you start listening to the pieces you start to notice the little differences in their performance from the original versions.<br />There are subtle changes in rythm and tempo and even different instruments play certain parts.<br />These nuances make this redition of Willams' music a most enjoyable one.
B000002UJQ|2.0|after reading so much about how this was a new \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" I finally bought it. I know Dark Side of the Moon, Dark Side of the Moon is a friend of mine... trust me, OK computer is no Dark Side. There isn't a single memorable song on this sleepy bore. There is more memorable music in Time's guitar solo than this whole cd. The band sounds like they're on thorazine as they slip through one echo drenched yawner after another. that echo stuff gets old as it is listening to U2...why build a whole career out of copying it? wildly over-rated by those who haven't heard stuff from the 60s and 70s. Pop music's standards have seriously slipped and people who regard this aural sedative as a \\"classic\\" record are proof.
B00197U0DU|4.0|This is NOT a review of this Varese-Fontana re-issue.<br /><br />How frustrating.  As the previous 2 reviewers have clearly pointed out, this release has been RE-released ad nauseum.  You can probably find 10 different versions on CD, and maybe DOUBLE that on vinyl.  I have at least 3 myself.<br /><br />What I can't figure out is why Varese-Fontana didn't see fit to release a definitive 2-disc STEREO/MONO set?  I'm very familiar with this album, it's actually a pretty pleasant collection of recordings (despite the fact that some of the band members were NOT happy with the strings added to the tracks).  But I would find it interesting to hear the mono mixes, some of which (I've heard, anyway) are very different to the stereo mixes.  Perhaps the mono mixes might have more balls, as mono mixes often do, something some of these tracks could possibly benefit from.  And the usual \\"extra tracks\\" could certainly be appended to the appropriate disc, making this a definitive release of their debut.  If they put that out, I'd be one of the first in line to buy it.  Even if this was just a single disc release of the MONO mix, that'd STILL be better than the same ol' stereo mix, which is prevalent.<br /><br />Too bad they blew it again.  Maybe, after the 3rd and final Gabriel-era box set (1970-1975) is released this fall (which will NOT contain this album, since Genesis do not have the rights to it), then just MAYBE it'll be done right.  Let's hope so.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of Jillian but I have changed my opinon since starting this workout.  I have been working out regularly and most DVD's don't quite do it for me but this one does.  It's great.  I like it because it is basic moves and works the whole body.  No dancy stuff, just a great workout.  I always workout with a heart rate monitor and during this video I keep it at my aerobic level.  Before this video I thought that I needed to work out for an hour.  When I do this video I feel like I have accomplished a lot in the 20 minutes and if I have time I'll do more like her cardio kickbox video, which I also enjoy.

B0018QCXH8|4.0|There Will Be Blood is a fantastic movie featuring one excellent performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  The rest of the cast performs admirably.  Daniel Plainview is an oilman, taking his son around the country to make a bit of money.  Plainview's story is clearly the focus of the movie, and while it may take some patience, it is worth the ride.      The Blu-Ray is a mixed bag; the transfer of the movie itself is excellent, but the extras are simply not there.  There's an old film on oil that was produced by the US government, there's a 15-minute slideshow/comparison to shots in the movie, and there are a small handful of deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes are the most interesting extras, and they are all worth it.  There's an especially nice end to the second one in which Plainview expresses his opinion of Eli, the preacher.      If extras are your thing, you may want to wait to see if they ever release a special edition.  If you just want a beautiful version of the film, pick it up.
B00000255F|5.0|Rarely do heavily hyped artistic endeavors come even remotely close to living up to the expectations. Born to Run is as notable an exception as you'll ever encounter. After an ordinary debut and an extraordinary but under-appreciated sophomore effort Springsteen released Born at the end of the 1975 summer. While The Wild, the Innocent... sounded as if it had been hastily put together Columbia, Bruce and the E Street Band pulled out all of the stops on the new recording. The result is a sonic blast never before heard. It is over the top in the manner of Phil Spector and it works.<br /><br />Lyrically Born continues Springsteen's string of personal Jersey stories of love, regret, violence, street life and heartache. Musically he leaves behind most of the R & B, jazz and Latino influences and turns to straight ahead rock and roll. Whereas the previous records sounded somewhat muddy this one is crisp and clear with Springsteen's self-assured vocals leaping out at the listener over layers of well-defined instrumentation.  Again, as with The Wild, one strong song is followed by another - there are no let downs.<br /><br />For me Springsteen is just one of the dozens of great artists who I have admired over the course of my rock and roll life. I am not what you would call a great fan. Van is the man. Bruce is just a man! However, whenever I listen to this cd I cannot help but be amazed and energized. It truly is a landmark in the history of American popular music. Five stars aren't enough. There should be a super category for the likes of Pepper, What's Goin' On, Nevermind, Pet Sounds and the other really important records. I need an asterisk.
0670020745|5.0|This book was very good at explaining the authors experience in having and recovering from a stroke. Her insights were useful in helping me understand my own thinking, particularly with respect to spiritual experiences I have had. My childhood friend is currently in the hospital with a stroke, and I think this book may be useful to his daughter as he recovers.
B000002513|5.0|Born to Run brought Springsteen to America's attention and earned him the Time and Newsweek covers. However, the real break out was this cd some two years earlier. It has always been my favourite and remains so today. Musically it is all over the map. There is no escaping Dylan's influence - but it is Dylan with R & B, jazz and Latino flavorings and with a New Jersey accent. Any fan who started his Bruce experience with either of the Borns would be surprised, to say the least, by the accordion on Asbury Park (Sandy), the soulful Butterfield Blues Band opening of Kitty's Back followed by the jazzy Van Morrisonesque vocals and the Jimmy Smith organ stylings of David L. Sancious. Although the record is musically extremely diverse the lyrics provide the consistency required to make this a great piece of music. To me The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle plays like a collection of autobiographical stories relating to Springsteen's Jersey life all those years ago. Moreover, it sounds like Bruce and the boys just got together one night and laid down these tracks. Now, the sound quality is admittedly less than ideal. I don't care. I first listened to the vinyl on an old, cheap stereo with a couple of pathetically small and inefficient speakers. Although this recording may be far from audiophile quality it certainly sounds better to me than it did as an LP, an 8-track or a cassette!<br /><br />There isn't a weak track on this cd. As I listen to each song I think to myself \\"man this is a great tune - the best one\\" and then the next song begins and I think \\"wow, this is a really great song\\". The bottom line is that this is a terrific cd. All Springsteen fans, even the casual ones, should have it.
B0016HNOXQ|5.0|You ever find those albums by artists you respect that prove to you they're geniuses at work?  Those albums that, while you're listening, stop you from doing, or even thinking about, anything else?  This is that album.  It's haunting, arresting, at times beautiful, other times creepy, and ALWAYS courageously out there.  This album has balls.  You'd think, after 12 years, they'd just get back together and do something for the money, and I'm so pleased to share that this is not the case.      To put it simply, if you liked Portishead back then, and you feel that your musical taste was somewhat effected by their previous work, you will love this evolution.  'Dummy' and 'Portishead' are timeless in their own right, and 'Third' just takes it leaps and bounds further.      Jeez, I usually have SOMEthing bad to say about new music these days, but not here.  This is why I felt the need to review this one, because if I could influence just one more person to buy it and experience it, then I've done my part as a big music nerd/junkie. :)  ENJOY!

B00006399Z|4.0|My brother had this on vinyl; I had it on 8-track.  One difference between them was that the vinyl started right on the downbeat of \\"Medicated Goo\\", while the tape had crowd noise and an announcement: \\"We'd like to say good evening, and welcome to the canteen.\\"  Can someone tell me if this intro in on the CD?

0312427999|5.0|Naomi Klein amazingly does it again with another well-researched provocative book. This book has an incredibly wide audience, since the lay audience will read, as will academice ones. I have assigned it as a possible book for the theoretical book assessment assignment in the American Poltiics courses I teach.<br /><br />That said, Klein's book is filled with vast amounts of research footnotes and internal notes. Her basic thesis is that the shock doctrine in concert with disaster capitalism helps a small percentage of people and hurts most. That is, war profiteering and disaster profiteering has run amok in such a way that should scare us or at the very least wake us up.<br /><br />Klein offers example after example in the Americas, South East Asia, and the Middle East. We shouldn't be suprised that so many American companies seem to get fat off the misery of economic and environmental disasters in other countries. Even if only 50% of what Klein explains is true--this book is a wake up call to the reader.<br /><br />At times the book might read as repetitive, yet if you look at the chapter heading you realize that this is just another sad case study outlining another example of how the shock doctrine has been used against another country.<br /><br />The Chicago Boys and their vision have been good to the elite and money making, but have devastated so many millions. This is a must-read for anyone interested in Economics, History, Politics, and Social issues.

B00000FD76|5.0|If you don't own this Classic for your collection,you are missing out!  This was one of the Greats! Director George Stevens' legendary rendition of the archetypal Western myth earned 6 Academy Award nominations and made Shane on of the timeless classics of American cinema!  Who would ever forget the ending with Brandon De Wilde yelling \\"Shane, Shane\\"!!  I loved this one!
B00005K3NY|4.0|This 1981 film by David Cronenberg is absolutely mind blowing, you have to see it to know what I'm talking about.<br /><br />This movie is about people with telekinetic powers that are viewed by society as \\"freaks\\" but a potential power source by one company, Consec.  These \\"freaks\\" are called scanners and have the ability to get into your mind and \\"scan\\" it. Scanners can use their ability for bad or good but sometimes have a hard time to control their ability. Dr. Ruth, a \\"psycho-pharmacist\\" who heads a research team for Consec (played by Patrick McGoohan)aids scanners with their abilities. Dr. Ruth tries to help one lone scanner Cameron Vale (artist Stephen Lack) to use his powers in a more positive way. Another scanner Darryl Revok uses his powers in evil ways and tries to convert Vale.  This is where the action begins.<br /><br />This little gem is listed as a horror film, but I found it more sci-fi than anything else.  It may be dated with the clothing worn and is a low budget film, but do not let this stop you, for it is one good movie!  It is definitely one for lovers of sci-fi, thrillers or horror not to miss.<br /><br />I bought this when Amazon had a terrific deal on DVDs and I sure got my money's worth!  Sometimes low budget films can pack a punch and this one does it, don't miss Scanners...
0670020745|5.0|This is the most amazing account of a person overcoming the severe effects of a stroke.  Jill Bolte Taylor gives, in very graphic detail, her experience of a left-brain stroke.  She gives the reader the ability to understand the different types of stroke and how they affect the stroke patient.  This will be a classic!
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Holy ****, finaly it comes!  Before I was wondering why warner choose HDDVD while not released this great trilogy on Bluray, I assure more people share the same notion as I do, but in the end, the format war was over, now the warner eventually planning to released this on Bluray, and wat's more is they also adding exciting 1080P Animatrix, that's really so gorgeous, I just can't help wait to see it! In a word, a Must have for all fans of Sci-Fi!
0743486285|5.0|I remember watching Nikki back when the Censored VHS came out...I thought he was just too cool!  Once you start reading this book, you just cant put it down.  That is at least if you can deal with the material.  It is dark and sad mostly and I said to myself more than a couple of times while flipping a page...\\"Nikki, what the hell were you thinking\\".  There are a couple of really funny parts by Nikki (maybe they werent funny, but I thought they were).  I found myself wanting to party real hard while reading it so I could be one with the author.  Not meaning I wanted to stick a needle in my arm, but just have another beer...or two (okay, I took a swig of GG from the freezer once or twice also!).  Anyway, some of Nikki's criticism of other people is sophistocated and humerous.  He is like a magnet for people...even though he wasnt very nice to anyone and didnt want to be around them \\"sometimes/often\\".  When you got it, you got it, and he had it...even though he was too cooked up to know, or maybe he did and it was all part of his allure.  I remember seeing The Crue twice on the Girls tour when Guns opened for them and both shows were legendary.  I remember that Red Stage and that silver Metal cube that Tommy's kit spun around on like it was yesterday.  I also remember putting the cassette for Girls Girls Girls in the player with my brother and then after we saw the video, we were looking for tour dates!!!  Reading in the book about the day that Nikki got back from shooting that was so cool!      Anyway, I would have liked more material about the music and some \\"substance\\" that had to do with the girls (other than Evangelist Vanity), writing material, the band, private conversations...but there is some of that in there, and the main focus I understand is to stay on track with his addiction and the diaries he kept about it (and to its credit, it is an intimate look inside of what was going on in Nikki's mind...I liked this very much about the book and maybe it is what kept me churning thru the pages).  In this, the book was true and very good.  When you read, \\"Whitesnake is finishing up, gotta go get ready to get on stage\\", you just want to read more about what was going on...I found myself saying \\"no, dont stop writing...tell me more about that experience\\" on several occasions.      This was the best time to be a rock star, the best band to be a rock star in, and what a way to be a rock star!!  With all of this comes some baggage, and I read all about it and more that was to come in Nikki's life, and it was totally worth reading.  He was very honest about it all.  I respect Nikki for his ability to deal with all he had to deal with and come out of it the best he could considering what an addict he was.  After it all, even today, he has managed to be successful and to make money for him and for others and this book is included with that...and like his music, he did a first rate job!  You gotta respect that!  I have always been a fan of Nikki Sixx and Motley Crue.  I am glad I was able to read The Heroin Diaries...it was almost never written...twice.  I am proud to be a Motley Crue fan and have always been, since opening the cover to Shout at the Devel in High School with some classmates!!!  CRUE!! CRUE!! CRUE!!!!
