B005K0HDGE|5.0|While I am only half way through this book, I love it! Stephen King never disappoints. It is thrilling and keeps your interest
B008VPC9WS|2.0|I am quite frustrated because the book has no audio for listening.  All the while I thought that the icon with play button in the sample \\"Look Inside book\\" is real.  It is fake.  I actually have the hardcover book already and unfortunately lost the CD.  This is why I bought a new one from kindle this time.  If I could just return this one I would.  Too late.  I don't think this is fair for customers expecting a an audio with the displayed icon.  Thanks anyway.  This is a warning for all who wants to buy this.  There is no audio available for listening practice.
0515153656|5.0|It does an excellent job of being an easy to read way to pass the time.  It's not great literature, but it smoothly puts you into the mind of someone many men would like to imagine themselves being.  Reacher is a trained killer, instantly in charge of virtually any situation.  The author lets us experience his thought process as he leads us through the mystery, dispatching bad guys at every turn.<br /><br />I understand why fans of the book were a not dismayed at Tom Cruise playing him in the recent movie, although I would say that with Reacher, his danger lies in his mental abilities and willingness to act, not any particular physical characteristic.  Sure, being a big man doesn't hurt, but a &#34;Reacher&#34; of any size is a formidable weapon and I imagine an actor of Cruise's fierceness and temperament was able to pull it off.  I will have to check out the movie to see for myself, I guess.<br /><br />Overall it is highly recommended, and I will definitely pick up another &#34;Reacher&#34; story next time I am at the airport or train station.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I am not the typical audience for this type of show, but boy I was blown away. Some of the finest cinematography I have ever seen in a TV drama mixed with a deeply moving story of adolescence. Definitely one of the top ten shows of all time. The early 90s were another Golden Era for TV...
B009PNQUXO|3.0|some videos that I download aren't compatible with my kindle and it freezes or it doesn't show the entire video
B001992NUQ|5.0|Entranced by the first special DVD edition in 2000.  13 years later (!) watching it again makes me realize how ahead of its time it is. I still think this is Fincher's crowning achievement and Brad Pitt's finest performance. 1999 was truly a exciting time for the film medium
B000002GB9|5.0|Had this album many years ago.  Glad to have it once again in my collection.  relived a bit of the 80's, and I loved it
B002UXRGM0|5.0|It was hard to imagine a better series than Planet Earth, but Life in many ways meets that challenge. Must own!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have played a lot of bingo games and this one is by far my favorite. Would recommend this highly!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I am a fan of Nicholas Sparks books.  I have liked all of the movies so far, LOVED The Notebook as well as Safe Haven.  I still believe in most cases the books are better than the movies but even though I enjoyed reading Safe Haven, I found the movie a bit better because (I don't want to give anything away but..)of some of the subplots were more exciting in the movie...must watch~
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|I love Gustavo's work. The soundtrack was beautifully created and it also has an emotional impact to it. The score can vary between happy and sad, but the instruments used really helped create the tone.
B00DU74U74|1.0|If you want to be bored for 90 minutes, I would highly recommend this movie.  It is a silly premise, silly movie.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like it; it is direct & easy;if I were to improve it I would  get more detail; ie data of  possibility of  rain; & the  humidity &  dew point when I go into forcast. But for a quick & reliable source of weather prediction--very good.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Well how far can you duplicate a comic book? the may good actors were not as convincing as when they have done in their individual movies. Was good but I thought story line could have a bit better in the writing .
B005LAII44|5.0|Great action film.  It will go in my collection with the other action films.  My grandsons love all of them.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Hugh  Jackman really can portray a charterer in any setting! The actor playing the son really makes it worth while as he really puts forth the charter playing off of Hugh's actions. Story line is different and is good well written!
B008JFUO36|5.0|This was a good movie.  It is a sci-fi movie.  I will need to watch it again.  But I enjoyed it.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|here is an actor than can do anything........he is so convincing that the character is real........I think he had fun on this one.....would recommend to anyone to add to their collection!
B00C70FGIM|5.0|Excellent listen and very progressive and lots of atmosphere. Id definitely recommend this to both fans and potential fans of the band.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|This was very well written and Chris Ryan is the best actor suited for this role.....he is so diverse in his acting..hoping to se more of him in  many other thrilling roles.
B0013ND30W|5.0|We love it... My daughter has been waiting for this movie... So glad I was able to find it here and at a great price...
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Taylor Kitsch is up and coming actor just wish he would make more action  ovies at least hope they are offering to him......he is great in this movie as he was in John Carter which is fantastic!
B00992CF6W|2.0|this game is wrong because you can not get gold armor and iron armor! also you can put stuff in creative mod!
B0092G1O8A|5.0|Really liked the story line as well as the actors chosen for this movie they really came across as the characters should hven been played...I would recommend to anyone...can't wait for another to come out!
B004LP3AYI|5.0|i could not put it down!!!!!!! the action was heart stopping, fast, unrelenting! I've got to go, the third book is calling my name!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Out together very well! Easy transitions through time/ space. I couldn't put it down. I lived all the twists and turns.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am on my second reading and is like the first time reading, you learned a lot. Great book!! Recommended

B000089RVR|5.0|I want to order from overstocks more often... tell me what to do to save on shipping if i order a few cd's at a time. or other incentive that fits my music taste/<br />thankyou.  I would like to hear some feedback on this one .<br /><br />;john
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love this series. Can't wait for season 4. Love the interplay between the nobility and the servants who usually lovingly care for them.
B001QJUX24|5.0|This is our favorite John Wayne film.  All the favorite actors used by John Ford (the director).  Truly a classic western with a good plot, plenty of humor, great characters and great acting by John Wayne.  Our kids never get sick of this movie.  My husband grew up watching it, and he has passed his love for this movie on to the next generation!  I believe this was John Wayne's favorite of the movies he made as well.  A great John Ford/John Wayne picture.  Add it to your family's collection!
B009J2VQSK|5.0|I absolutely love the movie \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" and all the music on the soundtrack.  As soon as I was finished watching the movie, I ordered the album.  The music fits the scenes and characters so well, and a lot of it is very familiar to me.<br /><br />Now that I have the soundtrack, I would like to have a copy of the movie.  I definitely recommend this CD after watching the movie.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Played ICO for 15-20 mins. Rubbish.<br />Shadow of the Colossus: A solid game were you play as a wanderer and travel through a mysterious land fighting nothing but colossi.<br />Excellent cinematics, scenery, game-play action. Sadly, an extremely annoying camera.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very entertaining Ill recommend to friends and family. Great for those long waiting room visits... hope that it gets harder as I go up in levels.
B00D739JE0|5.0|Megadeth has gotten too many bad reviews on Super Collider.Every song is very creative,and the guitar rifs are very diverse and sound like classic Megadeth.I don't know why Super Collider only has 4 stars,because every song is well produced,and the lyrics are very creative and are very personal.Dave Mustaine deserves a lot of credit for Super Collider.I see nothing wrong with this album.This is a really hard rocking melodic masterpiece that really beats a lot of the modern heavy metal bands out there today.Dave Mustaine may not have the best voice,but the band manages to play around his voice.The bands sounds very much in tune on Super Collider.Plus the deluxe edition comes with 3 bonus songs.The last song is a live version of Countdown to Extinction,which is pretty good.The 12th and 13th songs are just songs that the band didn't add to the standard release of Super Collider.Also,you get a 3d cover that is very cool and very creative.All the songs are well produced,and the melodies are amazing.The guitar solos are very creative and epic.I was very impressed with Super Collider,and it was well worth paying 16 dollars for at best buy.You really are getting your moneys worth.Im just glad that Megadeth still is around.They still sound just as good as they did when they first started.So,without a doubt,one of my favorite Megadeth albums.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|why ?<br />this film was recorded in 3D! (not  converted from 2D)<br />I was lucky to see this one at out local theater and was very impressed with the special effects<br />ok, the plot could of been better, but I thought this was a pretty good popcorn movie!<br />I also really liked &#34;Avatar&#34; for the same reason (filmed on 3D, and my favorite 3D movie)<br />ooh, I was rely mad when New Line Home Video released this movie with the old red and blue 3d glasses!<br /><br />it was like saying here's a good reason to hate 3D!<br />but I waited it out and bought the &#34;real 3D&#34; version and love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game . If you have ever played temple run or subway surfers (and liked it you'll love this) it is kinda like this but with minions. It's a game that I would recommend.I love it .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definite  must read for all my friends. Refreshing to see something so well written and appealing. Can't wait for the next one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it would read it again one of the most exhilarating book ever can't wait to read the third part!
B000X418UO|4.0|I do have this film on Standard Def but this will not necessarily be a side  by side comparison.  Never the less, I have seen the film often enough to recall the SD quality.  Enough has been said about the plot, acting, cast and other summaries so I will simply focus on the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray.<br /><br />VIDEO...<br />  This is definitely an older, albeit no less exciting, popcorn movie but doesn't really look like one.  The film has legs, and even more important, the quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray leaves little to be desired. Despite the relatively low Mbps rate which averaged in the low 20's, there is no appreciable grain to crawl and annoy you.  The contrast throughout the film really was excellent and it brought along with it natural and true to  life skin tones.  Color grading throughout the film tended to be on the soft side as there appeared to be no artificial popping of colors.  At no time did I see any artifacts or aliasing in the film and no stair stepping either in the wide angle shots.  The video resolution rates a full 5 stars.<br /><br />AUDIO...<br />  Using an uncompressed Dolby PCM 5.1 codec, as this film does, will always produce a more transparent audio field.  While your LFE channel gets and excellent workout with realistic bass tones, your surrounds are not left out either.  There is plenty of front to rear, rear to front panning which places you in the middle of the action.  However, despite the directional use of the front and rear audio stages, the actual audio mix could have been improved as it frequently sounded to my ears as a mash up of all the audio channels rather than discreet one surround foley fx from speaker panning to speaker.  Unfortunately, audio often gets the short stick in the editing suite and the same issue was there for the Standard Definition version.  That said, it is still an improvement over the previous lossy audio found on the SD DVDs.<br /><br />Extras..<br />  The same extras that were included on the SD DVD as well as a couple more that were just ok.  Far too many previews of other films make you pay for advertisements rather than donating that disc space to an improved video transfer with a higher Mbps rate and thus even greater video and audio improvement.  Great cast in this film.<br /><br />All my reviews focus on the quality of the Blu Ray transfer and I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.<br />Thanks for reading.xtras that were included on the SD DVD as well as a couple more that were just ok.

B009PHRIEA|5.0|Cobham is one of the greatest drummers in this form, and this is a great collection of his early work. The cardboard facsimile sleeves are short on details, since they just reproduce the front and back covers, but info can be found on line. Great price for all this music.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great story!! It's hard to put this book down. Can't wait to read the last book, but sad it's only a trilogy. I think I'll read more of Suzanne Collins's books when I finish the last book!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Since I knew this was a best seller, I expected to be drawn in right away. This wasn't the case. The first few pages didn't hook me; in fact I had to reread those pages then move forward. And when I did, I couldn't put the book down. Gillian Flynn did an excellent job getting into the minds of the characters and the pacing was perfect.<br /><br />This is definitely a book I'd read again. Even though I know the outcome, I'm sure I missed small nuances in the storyline.
B009X01C64|5.0|This case has everything I was looking for. Nice leather case, sturdy shell and swivels. Holds Kindle Fire HD perfectly! Worth it for me to pay a little more to get it all.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great app for keeping notes synced between all your devices. I've yet to explore it thoroughly but I love what I've seen so far.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show and can't wait for season 4. I can't believe that one of my favorite characters was killed in season 3. This show is never boring.
0385751532|5.0|This is probably not realistic, but it sure makes you think about the golden rule---&#34;Do unto others. . .&#34; The Nazis certainly did not do this and were so righteous about their beliefs at the time. My book club read this and had an in-depth discussion about it. I also watched the movie.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|Its finally here for the kindle but why not free? im not going to buy this, i love it but no.
0399255370|5.0|Not familiar w Drew Daywalt at all, but we are HUUUUGEE Oliver Jeffers fans!!!! This story was written in almost exactly his style! My 4 year old and I LOVE this BOOK!!! Even my 80 year old Grandmother is in love with it!! It is the most brilliant concept of a book. Very well written and illustrated. Love, love love this book. Can't recommend it enough!!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Wonderful plot... It's hard to to believe the plot and the story unfolds rather dramatically .... Must read... For a Grisham fan of course the storyline is as fascinating as ever ....
B006FLGBGA|5.0|It's a great movie.  I would recommend it to anyone, however it could be scary for small children.  It's still good though.
B002OKO1GI|2.0|I thought it would be at least slap-stick funny but it just wasn't. Beethoven gets yelled at a lot and almost killed by a mean veterinarian.  My kids didn't even like it and were upset when Beethoven got into so much trouble and was almost killed by the vet. Not funny or entertaining at all.

0812993357|5.0|I have always loved Grace Coddington's work. Whether you are familiar with her or not, you must read this book.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This was an amazing journey. really lovely well written emotional book. would happily look for this author again.very enjoyable. m.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game its so fun. Ill play it all day. Its so awsome.<br />Is it in the app store for iphones?
0440246318|5.0|This was a real page turner....Jack Reacher at his best....smart & witty!  Lee Child provided a great story line with lots of action.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Its an awesome game, so quit complaining about the version. If it had everything, it would make the tablet break. So just enjoy the app<br /><br />-C
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I like this game a lot.  There is only 7 levels on this one but they need to work on adding more levels.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|i liked it, but the slipcover was a little worn on the top part of the slipcover, but overall it was great
B004UID2LC|4.0|very good program, easy to save videos for traveling. I would recommend this app.<br />Very user friendly and easy to use
B003KGBISY|5.0|This movie is truly the best and will go down as the film that started the action genre for the modern times.
B0082Z447U|4.0|A little predictable but well developed characters and quite intriguing. The method of social communication and customs of the time when it was written was charmingly presented.
B00EQ27RMM|4.0|The picture and audio quality are great in this UK release. This version of Nosferatu comes loaded with bonus material. The two audio commentaries extend the life of this great silent film because you can watch it without missing anything.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read from Colleen Hoover for 2013. It's such a twist and I love it. The emotional roller coaster you experience while reading this book is beyond amazing. I couldn't put it down I've read this book in a matter of 2 days. I would recommend it in a heart beat.
B008HK3XYK|3.0|Nice sturdy cover. Protects Kindle well. One minor beef: You need to leave the cover open when charging the Kindle.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Tons of features, karaoke mode, commentaries - awesome!! This is the best Blu Ray version yet, the UK version is different from the US version- its fun to watch and spot the differences!
1401207529|5.0|This is an elite comic book best of the best. Frank miller is a genius, master of his craft. Good stuff
B00005JO5L|4.0|Cruising was a good movie and very suspenseful. I enjoyed it immensely, seeing it for the first time since I saw it in a theater years ago.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I enjoy this game, even though I'm not very good at it.<br /><br />The app needs some minor work.  It is stable on the Kindle Fire, which puts this in the top 25% or so of game apps.  However, the UI is difficult to deal with.  Some of the buttons are half hidden by the Fire menu bar.  Everything is very, very small.  You can expand the view of the tiles, but it snaps back to the smallest size as soon as anything happens in the game.<br /><br />I also haven't figured out how to be anything other than \\"player 1\\".<br /><br />That said, the AI is good.  I've won one game out of four, which is about average for me IRL.  So no complaints there.<br /><br />It's well worth the price of the app.  I enjoy playing.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-17<br />The app has been updated and is significantly improved. The graphics are better, the opponents seem to be a little tougher, and it seems to work more smoothly on the Fire.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Read the book. Do everything Pam says. Then read it again and do everything again!  She's giving you the secret of life here people. Fun read, easy language. She tickles your gut and challenges you to put the law of attraction to work. This will be in my library for years to come as a great reference. Highly recommended. - Michael Samuels. Author of Just Ask the Universe and The Universe-ity.
B00AQMQBKK|2.0|I enjoy the game (having played it IRL).  This app is OK, but it crashes more often than I would like.  And crash invariable causes the kindle Fire to completely lock up as well.<br /><br />It is also difficult to figure out where everything goes (saving dice, using tools and spells and such).  The background, while very thematic, is very cluttered.<br /><br />Once we get a few updates that fix the crashes, then this will be a great game.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|While I am loving the novel, I am finding the print on the Kindle edition to be very small.  I wish I had bought the printed book.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Awesome! It was a very surprising season to watch. It has a shocking ending. It makes you want to find out what happens in the next season.
B00821PCJS|5.0|This is not a show that gives you all the answers up front.  You learn as the characters learn.  Good entertainment.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Always a wonderful read! - who could feel &#34;down&#34; after reading this book???!!!! Try it for yourself and you'll see.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Have a problem  keeping the characters apart.  But I have not finished the book yet.  Doubt if I will change my mind at completion.
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|Addicting series!  I can't wait to watch each week.  If I miss a week and my cable DVR is acting up, I can purchase the episode I missed on Amazon.  Wish it were included in Prime!
B003VANOFY|5.0|This headset is great, blocks out a lot of sound, being my wife, while delivering superb sound, being my games. Range is about 10m, through walls, although sometimes it will cut out unexpected while sitting right in front of the receiver. The buttons can be programmed, so to use them as your PTT button, and can talk while cooking your bacon and eggs in the other room.
0563486430|4.0|I really enjoyed this story, I wish it would have been an episode because it was very fitting for the series.<br /><br />The characters were in character for the most part, only a few times did their actions seem odd.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I love the way the modern day music was incorporated into the movie. The cast was a group of phenomenal actors and actresses
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|The kids and I love to play this game. It helps them problem solve and identify patterns. Sometime we have trouble putting  the game down!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|The first book was a guilty pleasure... by this point in the series I am guilty of wasting my time!  The relationship has gotten even more controlling and the sex scenes are much less sexy.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I enjoy this app. ive had no issues with it. I spend a lot of time playing and is my favorite pass time.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app has tons of great add-ons for pictures. It even comes with instruction links! It has a nice variety of clip art, frames, grids, fonts, so much more. I tried a bunch of other free apps and this is by far the best. They didn't require a home page or extremely intrusive permissions.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It was all that I wished for, and more. All the characters, good, evil and everything in between, got to play out their full potential. Magnificent is the word that comes to mind. A very well performed work by Brandon Sanderson concluded The Wheel of Time series.<br /><br />In fact, I was so impressed that I wrote a longer review (or maybe one should say Tribute ;-) here: http://goo.gl/8gp8Em
B000JMKQX0|4.0|First time I read a zombie book. Very enjoyable and fun to read. Read like a real story it was very difficult to put this book down
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm usually go for the MP3 versions recently but it was cheaper to pick up this CD at 3.99 with autorip. I'm new to Muse, really discovering my enjoyment for them since hearing Uprising. But come to find I actually know some of the songs on Absolution. Great album!
B00BKELJZ0|5.0|Another outstanding album, powerful music, virtuoso performance by all of the members of the trio. It was a very special concert in Boston Scullers Club! Thank you once again, Hiromi!
B005LAIGPU|3.0|Thought the trailer looked decent and some were calling for a sequel, so decided to check it out. The movie was ok I suppose. I have a feeling its going to be collecting a lot of dust on my shelf as I don't see much re-watching. But 8.99 for this combo was a decent deal.
B002JXK5VU|4.0|It's defiantly a show for people who enjoy Sifi type things. So if you enjoy that stuff it's defiantly for you.
B003U9TDII|5.0|Loved the movie.... loved the music. A must have for Zimmer fans. Notice its usually $5 monthly deal, so suggest waiting for that if your considering picking it up.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|they did it again. Great sound with a totally different feel than any of their other albums. Been listening to it non stop!
B000R3NNDQ|5.0|This book is easy to read. You identify right away with the characters, makes you laugh and best of all, makes complete sense out of sometimes overwhelming changes.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|nightmare is a very special album. every single song has a different feel and sound to it. i love that they can rock hard yet have some slower more mellow songs on there as well.
B009NNMBCA|5.0|I cried through the entire movie. I am a huge directioner so that is probably why. My best friend bawled during the priview. This is the best movie I have ever seen and if you don't think so, then you are probably a carrot.
B00122HT04|5.0|i love this band and i love this album, I will buy anything they put out! you will enjoy! :)
B0044C3RB4|5.0|I have enjoyed all five seasons. Interesting characters, story lines and the casting was simply terrific. I wish I could see them all again for the first time!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|A lot of people are saying this show got silly but I really like it. It has captain hook and mulan in it which most people see that as a story instead of a fairytale but I love the way it's intertwined. It's not as good as season one but still worth the watch to me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing. It is better than the first one. It has great cliffhangers that will have you needing more. I can't wait to start the next book!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Me and my husband started watching this series on Netflix and had to see the last season before the new one in October. Hands down the best show I have ever watched!!
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game doesn't end. It is awesomely fast paced and tense. Upgrading keeps the game going andmore excitimg. Just watch out for those UFOs!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Love this game EXCEPT it freezes after a few puzzles. Fix the freezing up &amp; will be my favourite app ever!!!!
B000641D2Y|5.0|This movie is great! The first two home alone movies are classics. In my opinion this one is better than the first one. My daughter loved this movie when she was little and still does. So buy it cause its a good movie plus its got a good cast Macauley Culkin (Home Alone 1,The Good Son, My Girl, Richie Rich) Joe Pesci (Home Alone 1,Lethal Weapon 1 2 3 & 4) Daniel Stern (Home Alone 1,Little Monsters) Tim Curry (Stephen King's IT,The Rocky Horror Picture Show) and many more. This film is excellent and is a great Christmas/children's film. if you buy it you wont regret it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Like game but need more coins because hard to get shadow items. The more rooms you get up to requires a lot more playing and you get frustrated trying to get the earned items.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Thought I'd throw in a review since I thought this was underrated. The game is quite simple, use tennis balls to take out enemies to save the city from the evil corporation. You're just knocking them down no deaths or gore. Some fun levels where you have to use the terrain even in early levels. I'll probably play some more of this little game.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|In really like this app! It is fun and easy to use. I recommend this app to everyone!!!! It has some fun brain teasters too
B005HSG3U6|4.0|My grand-daughter likes to play her &#34;Dora&#34; and &#34;Umi Zoomi&#34; word, and number games on my kindle.  I didn't have a stand for it and we were constantly trying to put something heavy behind it so it would stand up for her.  This little case/stand is perfect.  I always have it with me and just change out the cases when she is wanting to play her games.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is a perfect weather app for anyone who just wants to be able to quickly check the forecast with or w.o all the details. You can put your zip in and it gives u a very accurate report.
159463176X|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was well written and just as thought provoking as his previous books. I would recommend it to a friend.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Been a fan for a long time. This work was a disappointment! Slow, overwritten dialogue, weak character development made me feel like I was reading the work of a \\"lazy\\" author looking to make a fast buck from his minions.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a fun game that ranges from very easy to semi difficult. I enjoy playing it with my kids, they never want to stop.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i purchased Chromecast from BestBuy where it had 3 months of Netflix offer and quick delivery.<br /><br />first impression after using Chromecast for 2 days has been extremely positive.  though my TV Panasonic VIERA TC-L47E50 has both netflix and youtube i went with chromecast since browsing YouTube using TV remote was not so good, alternate option of pairing my smartphone with youtube/TV did helped but again not as convenient as Chromecast which was breezing fast and super easy.<br /><br />chromecast worked perfectly fine with my Panasonic VIERA TC-L47E50 and i did not had to connect to external power source as the USB port in TV itself worked.<br /><br />tested Chrome browser casting over wifi and i was able to play a full length movie from internet without any lag or sound issue.  since long i was exploring option to mirror my laptop output to TV and now i am very happy that chromecast did this for me with just 35$.<br /><br />i have already recommended several of my friend about chomecast and i am very sure none of them will be disappointed with there chromecast purchase.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Tom cruise always plays great role in anything he does. Great story line and acting. Really keeps you guessing what is going on but clearly explains it by the end.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Great CD! Love all the tracks. I was surprised at how much I have played this since receiving. Thank you
B00BF11STU|5.0|Navy Seals are the best! And this movie is pretty accurate for what they have to go through! Great job Shipmates!
B0055D3EFU|5.0|Great Horror movie, is scary and I can't wait for see the sequel. The actors were very good and I liked a lot.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Awesome movie for adults and teens. good plot and story line. Matthew rarely does a bad movie. Hope you like to watch it.
0140177396|4.0|The book's quality was fine.  It did come with a 50 cent price tag that looked like it came from a garage sale.  There was also a child made bookmark inside the book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This is a great story told from the point of view of Pat who is an emotionally damaged man recently released from a neural health facility. Pat 's story tells how he goes from the lowest point in his life of losing his wife and trying to get her back by changing everything that he did wrong in the relationship with a positive outlook on life to becoming a better man. In the process he meets another emotionally damaged person named Tiffany who helps him move on.<br /><br />This book was funny and unique. I could not put it down. If you are looking for a story that will tug on your heartstrings and leaving you feeling better then I suggest this book.
0143116177|4.0|I am not a business person nor a financier , so sometimes the explanations become confusing for my more simple brain. But the history and information are truly fascinating.  It amazes me that the history of finance is overlooked in a general liberal arts college education. Every person who is curious about how money works or how the world of finance &#34;goes around&#34; should read this. Ferguson is quite amazing in his breadth of knowledge.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|OMG....I AM SO ADDICTED TO THIS GAME ALREADY. I JUST DOWNLOADED IT TODAY FOR FREE. I LOVE THE CATOONISH LOOK TO IT AND BEST OF ALL I GET TO KNOCK PPL OUT WITH TENNIS BALLS. THIS IS A BRILLIANT GAME NOT BORING AT ALL IN MY BOOK. I LOVE,LOVE,LOVE IT. THANKS FOR MAKING SUCH A FUN GAME.
B0075MFS9Y|3.0|Saw these folks on The Colbert Show and thought I'd give them support.  However, there was only one or two catchy tunes so gave the disc away.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Works on both my HTC Desire and my Asus tablet. Great fun and a great time killer. Well worth a play.
B000M4RG42|4.0|Would recommend this to any and all service personnel who served in the conflict of Iwo Jima, Our citizens of today are unaware of the sacrifices of our servicemen during this conflict.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|After using the basic keyboard for so long its nice to have an actual smart keyboard on my phone. Yes it can be frustrating at times but its far superior to the stock keyboard.<br />Only downside is it can be slow to delete or enter words at times. But the upsides to the app outweigh any downside.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I love this book! Very addicting! It was a great book just a little to short for me. But it's pretty deep for 7th grade and up
B00008EY9G|5.0|Plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout the movie.  What a great cast as well.  There should be more thriller/mystery movies like this created.
0812983459|5.0|Harold Frye needs to be inspired; he's retired, stuck in a rut, and obviously bored out of his mind. Therefore the letter from his old colleague and friend Queenie letting him know that she's on her deathbed comes at the perfect time. He ends up deciding a walk, or pilgrimage, across England will help her get better.<br /><br />5 Stars:<br />- Harold's quest is endearing; there's nothing realistic about saving someone from cancer by walking 600+ miles, but the fact that he's experimenting with his faith and the universe in such a naive, sincere way makes you love him.<br />- As someone who has never been to England I enjoyed the sort of off the beaten path tour I was given of it.<br />- On one level the novel is so very simple; it's about a walk and a man who wants to help someone. Yet as you read you learn that it's about so much more. The walk is more than just saving Queenie, it's a catalyst for Harold to save himself. It forces him to relive painful memories of the past dealing with his wife Maureen and his son, who he had had a rough relationship with.<br />- I'm usually pretty cynical, but I loved the kindness exhibited by strangers for Harold over and over and over again throughout the novel. He's never mugged or beat, but instead given food and places to rest, despite the shaggy appearance he ends up taking on.<br />- The ending
B00BEXB18M|4.0|If you are a Megadeth fan,this will be a treat!Good songs ,good solos!<br />Solid!! do not listen to the negative reviews!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Although this book by is almost 600 pages,and a tad tedious at times, the book thief has a great plot and sends a good message tithe reader. But don't read if you don't like sad endings!!
B008N5UX9M|4.0|Only if you really know Steve Harris can you really appreciate this record.<br />Iron Maiden fans will notice a couple of songs sounding like they came out of the Maiden archives.Other tunes on this album are good as well.and The singer is brilliant in his clarity,positive and really shines.There are some great harmonies<br />.Be warned there are a couple of coming of age 80's  metal songs borderlining on the &#34;we are young&#34;-.a smidge.<br />Anyway a good record for fans of &#34;Records&#34;
B007DA2FHG|5.0|I loved War Horse and I give this movie a &#34;5&#34;.  I had originally seen a War Horse Broad Way Show in New York City and absolutely loved it and then decided to buy this movie. I definitely recommend this.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|You don't need to be Biblical scholar or know the Bible back to front to follow what Aslan is saying. It presents an interesting view of Jesus, and while it might be arguable, it makes stupid people very, very angry, which is a great thing.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is excellent. I plan to read them all. It has something in it for everyone.  If you loved the Twilight Series yoi will like this too.
B001DELWZY|5.0|Angela is wonderful when she sings Amami Alfredo I put it on repeat.La Traviata is my favorite opera.The first act is fascinating.Ramon does a very good lover and Adiu to the pasatto is great.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli music is just fantastic. He makes you feel you are in the moment with him wherever he is at in the world. Great music and a lovely gift to have and to give anyone you love.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Just started playing and love it already. It is so much fun to play all the puzzles and collect the collections ^^
B006LSZECO|5.0|Once the big reveal happened - I couldn't<br /> put it down.  Such solid characters that I thought were well-developed and realistic.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a really fun game. I youse to be board all the time but when this game came out I was playing it all day
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|This sorta reminds me of stupid zombies only u kill clowns, which hey, clowns are creepy. Good therapy for those who have a phobia ,  and its free.
B005HS00XW|2.0|Unproper DVD format, can not be played on my device. Perhaps multi format should be purchased. Unfortunatelly I did not know it and expect the format being ok to play.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game,  I just wish that you could buy stuff with either the gems or coins because some of us don't have a lot of money to buy gems.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Unless you want to spend money and lose it overnight don't buy. The graphics has very good quality. You need to work on upgrades that is brought to your attention. You are only allowed 101 allies but of those you can only visit half of them. When you are attacked you can battle them but you can not invade them. Too many issues very slow to respond and fix the problems.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is so fun when I first got the game I spent an hour trying to pass the first half of the game
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome I LOVE PEETA so much that I had a massive fit when Latinas said she would rather run away with Gale read the next book ITS MY FAVORITE
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I truelly.like this game and I hope they have more games. And if you haven't played this game yet give it a try its really good and it puts your skills to the test
B004SKHJF2|4.0|seems to be more stable and faster than the older Shazam app ..  since I got this as the Free app of the day on Amazon it was the right price..
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|As always, you can't beat a British drama series!  The acting is extremely well done, but in a low-key manner that makes it authentic. The scene when the family discovered their son was dead was incredibly well acted...leaving me with goosebumps!  The helplessness felt by the parents, sister and grandmother was in no doubt and the viewer was carried away with them in their pain.<br /><br />The scenery is beautiful, while adding more mystery to the story-line.  I look forward to watching more of this series over the next few days. Wonderful production!
B00BEIYMTW|1.0|By far the worst animated film to come out of Disney in years. I literally could not bare to watch the entire film. -4/10
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|The official Blu-ray has seven mini-featurettes. If this seems like it is a half-assed release, it's because Paramount has divvied up all the other features, including the commentary tracks with the cast and director J.J. Abrams, and several additional featurettes.  The list of missing content on the U.S. wide-release Blu-ray (which is what is being sold on Amazon) includes 5 more featurettes (The Journey Continues... Again, Rebuilding the Enterprise, Full of Wrath, Kirk & Spock and Visual Preferences), plus the commentary with J.J. Abrams and the crew and a theatrical trailer.  The featurettes and trailer are likely what's on the Bonus Discs at Target and Best Buy and the CinemaNow downloads (Best Buy U.S. appears to have its content via CinemaNow download while the same content is on a Bonus Disc in Canada), and the commentary is obviously with iTunes. All this means, if you buy the \\"normal version\\" here on Amazon, you're getting less than half the special features created for the home video release, and if you want all of them you're going to need to purchase at least three separate versions.  Shame on you, Paramount.  I loved the movie when I saw it, but this review is specifically about this product and its release practices.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|Not a film for adult women. Tedious, w/o wit, compassion, or intelligence. Y'all can do better than this, can't you?
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very entertaining with a fantastic  view into the law and politics.  The characters portrayed are realistic in their roles -- no saints and no devils.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|IEnjoyed the game it keeps your brain working to find the clues some were a bit harder than others but your able to figure them out. I had fun.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I am a teacher and I look up things all the time.  There is not one time that Google hasn't been helpful, no matter what I was looking up or trying to find.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This s game amazing but it's really easy. Would like it to be a little harder than it is now.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|You'll love the main characters --- a funny, touching, unlikely romance which pulls you in many directions all the way to the end!
B008JFUN6E|3.0|While I by no means disliked Elysium, I also can't say that anything about it stood out to me either. Matt Damon did a decent enough job, but I just couldn't invest quite enough in his character to really care either. But to be perfectly honest, I also wasn't watching this movie hoping for the next great dramatic acting performances, I was watching it because I wanted to see a badass sci-fi/action flick, and for the most part Elysium delivered on that level.<br /><br />At least in my opinion Elysium is more of a Redbox movie than it is one that you'd need to own a copy of.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I loved this story -- I'll recommend it to my students.  Great example of how one teen responds to a difficult home situation and unyielding pressure to fit in at school.
B000F8O4E0|5.0|I bought this, initially, because I wanted the piece &#34;Fire on Hight&#34;, but found that the rest of the collection is pretty spectacular too.  I have a bunch of other ELO albums but they were missing key pieces that this album covered.<br />Wonderfully written, peirformed, mastered, and produced. This is truly a gem.
B000002AGM|5.0|Miles Davis and Gil Evans, the master orchestrator who did more for Miles than Miles did for himself. What a combo!
B000002B30|4.0|I'm kind of a late coming fan o The Boss, my listening to and for him started i the late '70s, and while I have quite a few of his albums, this one gives  all of the essential pieces for most of his first 20 or 30 years.  Of course, there are always going to be some titles that may be special to us as individuals that don't get included in collections like these.  But all in all, this is a really tough act to beat.
B005HSL626|1.0|Way to many pop-up ads and you really don't get the whole game :( Would probably different if you purchased the game .
B008XNZMOU|4.0|In general, I liked the album, it was well performed and produced.  I guess my only suggestion would be for Taylor to move beyond writing about former boyfriends.  Once or twice was okay, but now it's losing it's charm.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I lived through Cream, and witness the the sea-change with the first EC solo album that was almost as controversial for Clapton fans as Dylan's going electric (for his acoustic protest/social justice-song fans). Since \\"The Glory Days On High\\" with Cream Eric has been all over the place musically speaking...some of it to my liking and some not so much. But this is, to keep it short, of little redeeming musical value. And anyone who thinks otherwise...well maybe I can unload my dad's old 'Tiki Bar' Reel to Reel(mercifully short fad in the mid sixties) album collection on you.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|You think it is easy but it is not. Somewhat difficult. Play and see. Love the characters and the music.
B00COCY67A|2.0|Well I guess we really ARE scratching the bottom of the barrel...<br />There is not ONE take on those THREE CD's that has never been unreleased.. They are ALL available on the 3 FTD CD's: \\"Good Times\\", \\"Raised on Rock\\" and \\"Promised Land\\".<br />NOT ONE single, solitary track that was unavailable before.<br />Two possible reasons: 1- They have NONE anymore, so they just re-release and re-package the same old stuff.<br />or 2- They didn't care about us, fans, who want unreleased material.... (They'll get us later with another \\"new\\" album with all the missing takes... IF there are any.<br />It's a shame that they take the fans and collectors for fools for wanting to buy the same thing again.<br />Unfortunately, they know that the fans WILL do it... Because they have been doing it for 50 years.<br />The ghost of Tom Parker is still working his mojo there...<br />How sad and pathetic.<br />Come on Ernst, you can do better than that...<br />Or, do YOU have anything else?<br /><br />Just tell us that you have nothing new and close the books, man.<br />However the guy knows the fans are gullible and will buy anything Elvis IF it has ONE new unpublished picture in the booklet of the boxset.<br />What a shame.<br /><br />I asked in a couple of forum if there was anything new on this set.. now that I have seen the track list and checked it myself against those 3 FTD albums, the answer is clear<br />I will save my money for other things...<br />I shall not buy any new repackaged, re-released, re-chewed old material again.<br /><br />I love FTD CD's and hope they keep coming... as long as they got something new.. and don't let the bootleggers come up with an unreleased show in 1975 called: \\"Elvis Presley - The Creeping Crud Express\\"<br />How can they even let THAT be released?<br /><br />I will only supposed that behind all those bootleggers, there must be some Scandinavian guy, whose name we shall not mention, providing them with the goodies, at a high cost and percentage of the sales... so they always make money.<br />Should I call him Colonel Ernst Parker?
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I LIKE THE MOVIE.<br />ITS ANOTHER GREAT HIGH SCHOOL MOVIE<br />IF YOU CALL IT.<br />A HIGH SCHOOL MOVIE.<br />TWILIGHT AND HER FRIENDS WAS GREAT.<br />EVEN A NEW VILLIAN OR A NEW FRIEND.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Title says all.<br />Amazing book series if you like dark fantasy. Kept me reading all the way through, from start to finish.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who love the Kite Runner and any of his other novels. They are correct historically, culturally, and Now! He is a gift to us spoiled Americans!
B006AZZPCM|2.0|don't get me wrong I love having my own personal videos on the go without wifi but it gets on my nerves a lot because it doesn't always right away and sometimes I have t shut my kindle down and reboot it and then sometimes it still wouldn't work even when I shut my kindle down the first time not to mention that I can't get certain videos I want because they are taken down or the owner of the video hasn't made it available for download. it also takes up too much space on my kindle and limits my storage gb. but most times it's okay
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I would highly recommend this to later teens-and their parents, too. A good read;thought provoking, but actually realistic in today's world.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink music rocks I love her music she never gets old. I love the cd bring out more music g
B00992CF6W|5.0|I enjoy Minecraft but ever since the update I can't join my friends game when were on the same WiFi. Please fix this problem.
B007V4QLY2|5.0|Love pink love all her music she always been out there and not let anyone get her down and that why I love pink keep making music
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I love this app!  Some of the best authors on a free download!  How can it get any better than that!
B00BBXTSB2|5.0|For Katy Perry sharing her up and downs on this film and they way she fight and never gave up this is a truly great one to watch. I love Katy
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the best app any book lover could ask for!  I could not believe the quality of books that are available to me.  Did I mention a lot of them are FREE!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Funhouse love all the songs that pink does she rocks keep up making all the music you can got to love her
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy playing the game. I just wish that it was easier to earn diamonds. Over all it is fun and entertaining.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|Well for Starters I love the vampires diaries and I can't wait to pick up season four. I love the this tv show it has everything in it that you would what to watch.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Great mix of tunes, well sung and arranged.Can't ask for much more than that (as long as you like pop music)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Played it on PC, loved it there, love it on my android, great fun and engaging gameplay. Get it now!
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|Bottom line is this is one of the greatest movies of all time. If u don't know it, u should. Definetly don't watch 2 or 3 unless u are a hardcore fan but this is a stand alone classic, and one of the greatest stories ever told, to say anything else would give it away.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Having never played this game before, didn't know what to expect, but its gameplay is nice ( reminds me a bit of earlier puzzle games ) and the graphics are colourful
B009LQKHIO|3.0|If you are looking for a good solid romance read, this one works.  It is predictable in a romance novel fashion but an enjoyable and easy read.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Played many versions of the same gameplay, always fun and addicting. My daughter loves it, and it is a classic.
B0053ZOQMK|3.0|It's a kid's movie for adults, but it wasn't clever or smart enough to keep my attention.  Not the best of it's kind.
B00EV4F5TC|4.0|I went with my wife and saw \\"Lee Daniels The Butler\\" today. I was apathetic at first, but the movie was powerful and well thought out. It is nice to see how the characters portrayed average people with a dilemma - do you try to keep what you have, or do you fight for more, or more importantly, what is right?<br /><br />I found myself empathizing with both the father and the son, as both did what they thought was right. The script was somewhat predictable, as all turned out well in the end. Forest Whitaker did a superb job. I liked Oprah's character and thought she did well in that role. I don't want to go into the plot, as I don't want to spoil it for you.<br /><br />One thing I really liked about the movie is that it didn't keep flashing forward and back. I hated \\"J. Edgar\\" and \\"The Iron Lady\\" because both movies started in the present and kept flashing back, then forward. This movie starts at the beginning and goes straight through.<br /><br />My only problem occurred when I got home and did some cursory research. I thought the movie was about the life of the real White House butler, Eugene Allen. Apparently, this movie is a screenplay which bears very little resemblance to the real-life Mr Allen. I was somewhat disappointed.<br /><br />Still, I liked the movie. I suppose it had some similarity to \\"The Help\\". Others compare it to Forest Gump. It lasts about 2 hours.
B002GNDXY4|5.0|Enjoyable show that is surprisingly well-written and cast.  We're ordering all 10 seasons.  Interesting script and back-story on 'Superman' + they gave a 'nod' and included Christopher Reeve as a guest star in several shows prior to his passing.  They also had Dean Cain as a guest star.  Enjoyable for the whole family, including the grown-ups
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Had to read it after watching the first season on Netflix. It's not like the series but probably more truthful and honest. I'm not quite done with it but I think that Piper learned a lot from her year in prison. I recommend it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|It is a bluntly written book.  No extra words, just the ones needed to portray the scene.  I consider him a good writer.
B0012CH350|5.0|I'm very satisfied with this purchase. It fits<br />my 18&#34; Kettle perfectly and is made of a reasonably durable material which is suitable for indoor storage. For true weatherproof protection (outdoor) a thicker non-porous material would be more suitable.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Wuthering Heights is one of my all-time favourite novels and this version with Juliette Binoche and Ralph Feinnes is by far my favourite. If you've never seen or read Wuthering Heights, a &#34;Bronte Fan Must&#34;, the tortured romance is best played out by these two exceptional actors.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Love this case.  Very nice quality and looks more expensive than it was.  Actually bought 2.  Be warned, Orange is very bright.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|You have to get this no paying will cash in this game .it's a good game.you create your own village
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting book and confirms a lot of what I have always believed.  The only distraction that I found was all the medical findings, etc.
B00C2FFJFM|4.0|My daughter is a huge fan of Demi Lovato, and so in the vein of introducing her to other artists that she can listen to that are in her wheelhouse, I decided to get her a copy of `Stars Dance'.  Yeah, this is far more `adult oriented' than Demi's latest and so there are a few tracks here that are off limits to my six year-old.  That said, there is something hugely enjoyable about what Gomez offers up to the masses on her latest album.<br /><br />I've never really listened much to Selena Gomez before this album.  I know of her personal life because it is all over the media, and I know of her acting talents because I've seen some of her films (she was remarkable in `Spring Breakers', so I'm anticipating great things from her in that department), but overall I haven't been all that interested in her.  I have to admit; `Come and Get It' is a lot of fun and certainly gets the blood flowing in a way that makes me want to dance, so I was intrigued.  Honestly, it was hearing `Slow Down' the other day on the radio that hooked me though.  The track was pitch perfect.  It was slinky and sexy and beat heavy and felt relevant to what is in the now.<br /><br />I was expecting more from this album overall.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with her vocal abilities.  She isn't in the same league as someone like Demi Lovato (drawing from her comparisons here), but she has as much or even more ability as some of her other peers, like Miley Cyrus.  My disappointment has more to do with the uneven nature of the songs themselves.  The opening track, `Birthday', is a great example of what I mean.  The songs beat shifts are so frequent and so abrasive that the song winds up lacking any real flow, and dance songs NEED to have flow.  `B.E.A.T.' is another track that lacks that effortless fluidity needed to make it feel like a worthy dance track.  It comes off as an experimental track TRYING to pass off as a dance track.<br /><br />Still, `Come and Get It', `Slow Dance', `Stars Dance' and `Save the Day' are pretty impressive tracks, and the closing `Love Will Remember' shows that Gomez can clean up nice.<br /><br />She's a woman now, as is evident in her film and song choices.  The innuendo is prevalent here, especially on songs like `Slow Dance' and `Undercover', but it's nothing to be ashamed of.  The album is short and sweet, but it needed some adjustments to be something truly substantial.  I'll keep it circulating the CD player despite my reservations though, and it's an album I have no shame in recommending.ave the Day' are pretty impressive tracks, and the closing `Love Will Remember' shows that Gomez can clean up nice.<br /><br />She's a woman now, as is evident in her film and song choices.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I love the all of the cut the ropes games. The om noms in this game are so adorable! It's fun, addicting and a good way to pass time. It's a good problem solving game, to get your brain going in the morning.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A great way to spend an evening.  Hard to beat. A lot of fun trying.  This is absolutely wonderful to play.
B0055QYKQO|1.0|the 3rd revision of this motherboard has defective VRMs. This causes CPUs to throttle under stress-- it would throttle my 8350 down to 3.4Ghz on stock settings. absolute garbage. gigabyte is usually great and this is just an accident on their part. check out a gigabyte 970a-ud3 for a better experience.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book was terrific.  I had trouble putting it down and finished it too quickly.  Since it's part of a trilogy, I look forward to reading the next one.
1416955070|1.0|I haven't read the book but it has been sitting on my amazon wishlist for a while now. After seeing the movie I decided that that book is not for me. I reaks of Twilight and steals ideas from other stories. If you like Harry Potter, Doctor Who, Starwars, Greek Mythology (Clash of the Titans, Percy Jackson books)  then you'll like something in this book. Whatever happened to being original?!?!? This author just threw together a bunch of epic moments from other stories and put it into one. I had high hopes for this seeing as the cast was decent and the special effect were great. I am thankful that I didn't waste my time reading it.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|I actually avoided this film because of the low ratings - I really ought to know better! Now that I have seen it, I'm pretty sure the low ratings came from all the Horrible Bosses out there (I worked for one of them!). With that said, humor is crude (four letter words, alludes to kinky sex) but no nudity. If you're thinking of renting but hesitant because of the low ratings (and not offended by four-letter-words) - take a chance. It's silly, fun, and hilarious! :)
B008X9Z4I8|5.0|This was a needed item-it keeps my Kindle clean, I can charge it in the case, and most importantly, I dropped my Kindle in the case, and it protected it!
0345452577|1.0|Ridiculous plot - I really DO like to be nice - but I can't on this one. The author must have spent a full 60 days on this one - if that !! Written on a very non intellectual level. Perhaps the author was comatose sipping margaritas on a beach all summer and had a deadline of September and handed in the first draft. So much in this plot has been done a 1000 times before, especially the ending.<br />The author has averaged about two books a year since he started writing. Slow down and put some thought into it. Skip this one, unless you want to have fun and shake your head all the way through and say to yourself \\"Maybe there is hope for me, I could write a better novel than this\\".
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game understands what it needs to be and how to make it retro without missing the point. Worth playing. []
B00AEBBA68|4.0|Keep you interested through out of the movies. Good script and great performance . I am surprised that I haven't heard munch about this movies until my son recommended it.
B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|Same old crap from Abrams...easily the most overpaid and overused hack in Hollywood history.<br /><br />Lots of flashy visuals strung together by recycled &#34;homages&#34; to better directors and films, 2-dimensional stereotypical characters with infantile motivations, and simply unbelievably stupid &#34;science&#34; that makes even the jokey original Star Trek seem logical.  If you like that sort of thing, have at it.  If not, save your money, time, and peace of mind.<br /><br />Since everyone else seems to think JJ Abrams is genius, and he's been given the helm for every action film on the slate (or little mini-Abrams are hired to imitate the Great Imitator for a smaller paycheck), I suppose I'd better get used to it and just give up on sensible adult entertainment ever making a comeback.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|This movie stopped and skipped multiple times. Amazon instant video problems made watching it suck. I want my money back
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app. It gives me what I am looking for. It's very informative. From the heat index, what allergies are out, to whether I should do an outside project.  It's amazing.!!!!
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|We liked the movie, simple and easy to watch, good for the kids too. Nice american story with happy end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so much fun...I Love Horses and now I can care for one anywhere anytime of the day...so realistic ...you got to try this !!!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|It's good... but I like Swype better.<br />It wouldn't learn my email address for some reason no matter how many times I tried to teach it so I went back to using Swype.
1423424514|2.0|Too many changes compared with 5:th edition.<br />Many nice tunes have been removed compared with the 5:th edition of the book
B00785P2QC|3.0|A nice way to pass the time. Of course, get ready to spend if you're in a hurry to build.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|With a couple funny parts. It was an easy read, but not very entertaining.  She's not a very good writer, which explains the Only funny thing she's done is Mean Girls.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|It's okay, but it doesn't keep my interest long. I think I solved it in 26 seconds after only doing it about 15 times.
B008KHG2K2|5.0|As a \\"toy\\" I gave this some low scores only because it does not really fit the criteria for a toy. This is a statue, and a collectors piece. It has no articulation, and is not durable enough for small children. But as a collectors piece, it is stunning! The detail is top notch, and the magnetic base is brilliant. My only complaint is that the magnets could be a little more powerful. Other than that, it's gorgeous!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and a good way to waste time when you need to. Best part is it's free.
B00CXVX1OQ|1.0|I have really enjoyed this game or application, It is the best Android, application. Congratulations and thanks to the developers.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The development of the main character was well done providing insight to how this unassuming individual would even have the slightest chance to survive an ordeal such as this. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I  read the reviews, hesitated because they usually express how worth installing the app is and then installed anyway to see if it really as bad as insinuated.<br /><br />I played to the hipster levels before I stopped to do this review. It's fairly simple, especially the first couple games, but then after that it gets more complicated. I'll admit the riot police level was simpler than need be. The hipster level seems to be making up for that.<br /><br />All in all it's a pretty good game. It's not Angry Birds good, but it's not an exact Angry Birds clone, either. I'm almost tempted to think that the bad reviews came from people that work for the energy drink industry or people that really are hooked on those drinks.......almost.<br /><br />Maybe not a 5 star game, but a solid 4 star. This game is worth a look. I know I am now about to go back and bean some hipsters.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Well worth the read, awaiting the sequel. The price for Kindle edition was attractive. Hope to see more books by Anthony ryan.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|It has increased my love and respect for classic literature.  T he beauty of reading books on a kindle is the instant  definition of an unknown word.  It's such a beautiful love story but so much more.....
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book struck such a cord for me. It was recommended by friend whose daughter had some of the differences that August had. Reading it reminded me of her and how far this girl has come in the years I have known her and how important it is to remember that we are all individuals in need of love and kindness. WELL DONE!
B001EC2IT4|4.0|I forgot how funny this movie is, and how good an actor Michael Keaton was in it!  I thoroughly enjoyed being able to watch it again this many years later!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Unlike the first two books this one took a little more time to catch me but it eventually got me. Love the characters in this series and the twists and turns are great. Still nobody can write bedroom stories as good as Ms. Day but the mystery and intrigue in this book is fantastic. Unfortunately I like others will be eagerly waiting on the next book in this series!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Such a great compilation of pieces.  A truly and unusual blend of keys and strings by which to be soother. I need to get Volume II.
B008AX18Y6|5.0|I am currently reading this book and cannot put it down! I bought this book on a recommendation from an article on Tan Twan Eng, my favourite author. A very interesting read as a companion to Salman Rushdie's books.
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I would have given it 5 stars however those flashing constant adds at the bottom drive me crazy!!!  I realize free is free, but seriously do adds have to flash virus warnings constantly???  Also it has quit working once or twice and I had to delete and reinstall which is no big deal.  Try some subtle advertising and I will give 5 stars!
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Another magical book from a talented writer. Book stays with you long after you have put it down. Not as powerful as the Kite Runner, however, another very special book
B00991TCOG|5.0|Loved it!! Awesome! You will love it. I can't wait for the next album that she makes. Hope its soon!
B007ZXK08C|2.0|I did not connect with the characters, they felt manufactured. I feel the marketing strategy seduced me into buying the book. A disappointing read.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|When I first played I thought it would have a rope and you feed the pudding and it grew each level you play but it is better you slide the pudding and it turns into a pudding monster. AND IT IS SO FUN!
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|Finally, I received my Blu-ray disc. As I had written before I had hoped this movie had undergone some necessary treatment.<br />Well, good news first: the picture quality is very good to excellent for a 5o-year-old movie with that amount of composite shots. The DeLuxeColor photography looks much better than on any other version I have (FV has been my absolute favourite film for 40 years now I have gathered a good deal of different versions from this movie over the past years: TV recordings, VHS-, LaserDisc- and DVD-copies). And although the original opening title has been reinserted there is still something left to be desired:<br />The print used for the Blu-ray mastering is obviously the same used for the previous DVD versions and it contains the following flaws:<br />1. The passage through the subarachnoid cavatiy (1:25:51-1:26:49) contains the most annoying flaw: wrong tinting. The entire scene is supposed to appear tinted in green color. All of my prints and copies (except DVD) show this tinting during the entire scene and the dramatic effect is gorgeous, making that scene a very dark link between the light inner ear shot before and the sparkling thoughts in the brain after. On DVD this effect is completetely spoiled showing a RED background in the first half of the scene (1:25:51-1:26:27) and changing unintentiously to a GREEN background for the rest (1:26:28-1:26:49). The faces of the actors in the foreground remain somewhat pink instead of reflecting the dark green from the outside as it was present in the prints used for the non-DVD versions.<br />2. There is a jumpcut at 1:37:56. Well, it is not noticeable in the picture but in the soundtrack if one is familiar with the fine timing of Leonard Rosenman's score.s not noticeable in the picture but in the soundtrack if one is familiar with the fine timing of Leonard Rosenman's score.<br />And of course the film stock used is Eastmancolor with treatment by Fox's DeLuxe. Nevertheless this film needs an overall careful color restoration to preserve Ernest Laszlo's inventive and effective color cinematography which earned hin an academy award nomination.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|I read some reviews online and decided to buy the book because I wanted something to read on a quiet weekend that would be interesting but not too challenging.  It wasn't challenging but it wasn't all that interesting, either.  The constantly changing viewpoints were distracting and everyone overlapped, no pun intended, too conveniently.  When the viewpoint changed, I had to consciously recall which family of characters was in focus.<br />It seemed like the adult characters were satisfied with reacting to a crisis and then burying, again no pun intended, the aftermath in order to preserve their wounded relationships.<br />The P.E. teacher is probably the most well-adjusted, yet, he's the one who sees a shrink.  Possible spoiler alert - in the end, he is the one who remains a possible victim of a potential newly hatched scandal.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have read this book twice and love the series. Yes the sex of great but the heart warming love story behind it all is so wonderful. You will fall in love with Christian Grey and Ana. Their story of love is wonderful!!!! Love love it. This is a series I could read over and over again!!!!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game, like Diablo in functionality but a toned down appearance. Some bugs that still need fixing: can potentially get stuck on loading screen, must delete and reload game, all progress and characters are lost. Other bugs are just annoying but not a big deal. Overall the best rpg I have played on the tablet.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|Loved this movie.  It was beautiful to watch and very entertaining!  Would definitely watch again.  Dicaprio delivers a stellar performance.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|What can I say...It's Tolkien...and Peter Jackson...nothing else compares.  Can wait for the next one...I will own that one too.  It will be mine...oh yes...it will be mine.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Its cool and works very well and stuff cause its cool and its cool and stuff ofnofn$ln of of os
B003U80I5G|1.0|This dvd was of extremely poor quality; green lines running vertically through some of the feature.  At other times the dialogue skipped.
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Bought this App for my son who loves Scribblenauts Unlimited on the PC.  Unfortunately, even though Amazon and Google Play report that the App is compatible with our Google Play Android 4.0 7\\" Screen 1GB System Memory 1.2 GHz processor it runs like a slideshow.  Even the initial loading splash screens take about 5 minutes until you finally reach the level select screens.  Moving your avatar across the screen takes over 2 minutes.  It's more like watching a Ray Harryhausen stop motion film in the making!
B005721W9O|5.0|A Star Trek convention recently rated this the 7th best Star Trek movie, beating 6 real Trek movies. And the movie actually deserves that honor. Galaxy Quest is at once a spoof of Trek fandom and an homage to it. Unlike some spoofs, it never demeans the source material. it's funny but respectful. It definitely helps that the lead roles were filled by superstars like Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen, who are great in their roles. Definitely recommended for Trek fans.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This was a great book usually the books in a series the first one is the best but this series just keeps getting better and better and I hear the 3rd book is even better! Is there a fourth book? I thought it was &#34;The Kill Order&#34; but I am not sure?
B005LAIISA|3.0|This isn't a bad movie. I just can't help wondering if the Ice Age franchise has run out of steam. The villains were new, but the story was pretty similar to what we've seen before. We don't see much character development with the heroes. I'm sure this movie will entertain kids and I think the new pirates are visually fun, but in terms of fresh ideas, this isn't quite it.
0756405890|4.0|Half way through and it is a pretty good story. If you like fantasy sci fi then you will dig this book.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|this virson is a huge upgrade from the first one with lots of levels and i love the new characters! 5 stars!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this.  talk about addictive highly recommend it.  sometimes takes me days to finish.  thank goodness I work or I would do this all day.  it is challenging and when that door opens yesssss.  finding all the clues really makes it fun.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|Love their music! I check to see when the next album will be out so I get it right away. I own all of their albums and never have been disappointed.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Tom Hanks is amazing in everything he does.This movie is excellent and heartfelt. Pretty good price for a great movie.
B00D7JGL36|4.0|Could have used a few more songs on this collection.  I was really getting into it just when it ended.
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|Its the Beatles! Of course it was great! It arrived as expected and had a pretty good price tag. Thanks!
B004BLDD9Y|1.0|I like the price.  I like the light output.  I like the low use of energy.  I DON'T LIKE the premature failure. The box says these are supposed to last 18.26 years based on 3hrs/day use.  Two of the three bulbs I bought burned out in about 2 months in my sons room.  It is now too late to return the items to the seller.  Now I am stuck having to deal with the manufacturer.  I'll try to update this review, depending on the response I get from Lighting Ever. Update 11/23/2013 I called Lighting Ever, they acted like they were going to send me replacement bulbs at no cost.  I have yet to receive any replacement bulbs or refund. Since the initial review, more of these bulbs have burned out.  I have many LED bulbs in my 5,000+ square foot house.  None have been as bad as these.  I WOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING THESE BULBS!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Grandson was thrilled to receive this.  Keeps him entertained for hours which is wonderful. Fun for the entire family,  Great for game night.
0061914177|2.0|Let me first say that if you are in a position where you work the typical job, living paycheck to paycheck etc, this book can be very inspiring for you. This book can be of great value to you if you have little/no knowledge of social media networking, marketing, or hustling a product in general.<br /><br />That being said, this book will disappoint the struggling entrepreneur, and anyone else who knows a thing or two about today's markets and electronic user interfaces.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this book is a vague manuscript on basic economy with a quick spash of modern social technology:<br /><br />1. Come up with a product or talk about something interests you online(Smurfs, Wine, Ornamental Horiculture.. Anything Goes!).<br />2. Build Facebook and twitter page.<br />3. Blog. Blog nonstop.<br />4. Find a way to market your product/interest(Set up an online shop after you have established readership)<br />5. Profit?<br /><br />What let me down was the lack of specificity. Everything in this book is vague, except for the authors childhood hustling story(which indeed was an amusing anecdote).<br /><br />2 stars because of lack of detail on HOW he achieved success(All he says is blogging and advertising millions of $$) and misleading title. If it were titled &#34;My Story and some Helpful business suggestions for beginners&#34;(Horrible title i know) I would have given it 5 stars.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw a little boy playing this in line at the store, went home and downloaded it, and have been addicted ever since that day!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There is a tendency among many to treat the bible as a single document.  Aslan uses contemporary and near contemporary sources to elaborate on, verify, and challenge assumptions regarding the historical accuracy of the bible.  He reminds us that Jesus was never a Christian but lived and died as an observant Jew.  Although the author never says so directly, he makes the case that Christians should be more accurately called Paulians.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is pretty sweet for a few app, but like others have mentioned, you have to shell our real cash to get health potions since they don't seem to drop. Lame but I will still be playing this.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this story!  Very well-written, and the adventure keeps you turning pages.  People born in the 70's would probably really appreciate this, especially if they like video games.  Good book!
B009MJUCNA|5.0|Great item.I love it.It made my terrainum look really great.Very natural.I took hot glue and put it on a piece of river drift wood.Looks so natural.Thank You seller.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Overall a good overview on the habit cycle and how to break it (or leverage it). I found the examples used through helpful to reinforce the points made, and the appendix seems like a good set of tools to explore your own habits. I was hoping for more of a focus on habits that seems automatic and involuntary, like anxiety responses to public speaking, etc... but it does lay out a good baseline from which to explore further on your own.
B00CEQ1HQE|5.0|doll arrived in perfect condition- thanks for letting me add her to my collection- great addition  to collection..l love her
B009VLXMJA|3.0|I enjoy Taylor's music. Most of her songs have a great story and the gal can actually sing, which is more than can be said for a lot of female vocalists right now. But this album was just a little too teen-pop for me. Looking forward to her more mature music.
B0082KPF32|5.0|I was turned on to these guys by a small record company in Finland that has been charged with creating their vinyl albums.<br /><br />I listened to \\"Forget Not\\" and was utterly blown away.<br /><br />There's not a single second on this album that I do not like.<br /><br />Can't wait to hear more music from this Aussie band.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Started to play to see if my g-children can play without being frustrated. This is a relaxing game that teaches about how the ocean substanes itself.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I finally got to read the first Harry Hole mystery.  Jo Nesbo always makes references to what happened in Australia, but I read the books out of order, so I was glad to finally read this first book.  This book is a great mystery set in Australia, and Hole goes there to solve a murder.  Nesbo purposely sets the story in Australia, using specific settings and talking about issues faced by the indigenous people of Australia.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|John Harrison should have been brown.  Carol Wallace is hot.  All Hail Jar Jar Abrams.  I love the little scenes which mimic scenes from other movies but can be totally different at the same time - like the &#34;They gave her back to me&#34; scene: brilliant.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Mind bending and very creative in the combinations. Frustrating but rewarding in the end. Fun, fun, fun creative, mind stretching and
B001QE9WEO|5.0|This movie epitomizes the idea of horror not taking itself too seriously, while also not devolving into a &#34;torture porn&#34; situation or just plain gratuitous nonsense/gross-outs (looking at you, Troma...).<br /> Goofy yet gory, the movie has enough continuity to have spawned a side-series, separate from the Romero stuff. Just stay away from that Trioxin. Ah, also, yes; this one is just like the original Evil Dead movies, in that it could easily be considered a remake, but is much less so than Raimi's work. The sense of deja vu is yet another bit of humor.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|At first I was so happy my dad let me get this game but when I got it the graphics are terrible you wipe out just by bumping the wall and it doesn't look like your car is crashed. NEED FOR SPEED IS 10TIMES BETTER. Rip off.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Visually it is worth watching.  Story wise it's kind of bland and canned like much of what Hollywood churns out.  Glad I watched it on amazon and didn't waste $ on a ticket.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I Loved playing this  game. But it costs to each game, which is fine but not when constantly freezes up and just takes your tokens. It also will randomly say you timed out and kicks you out of th  game. Inc  it freezes up not kicks you out you have  to start a whole new game with different people. It start  to get really annoying after awhile. So much that I'm hesitate to play enumerated constantly having to end it. This needs to be fixed before I'll play again!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a fun game testing your memory and eye  and recognition capabilities  and quickness to get the game finished quickly without mistakes.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|It was not as good as the kite runner, I had to push myself to read the last 100 pages...
0689878451|5.0|This is a very cute book about love.  It doesn't stress the fact that it is a same sex couple raising this baby penguin.  It is a simple, very cute book.  I also love the fact that this book is based on a true story!
B00000F6LQ|5.0|Love love love this movie! It's hilarious, like no movie today can even touch! Bought this as part of my gift to my husband for our one year anniversary!
B0089LOG02|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot.  I thought it was well-written and the characters were endearing and fresh.  I enjoy historical fiction and appreciate learning while I'm reading.  This book is a solid piece of historical fiction and I recommend it to anyone to whom the premise appeals.  Can you imagine all this plus a satisfying ending?  Good read!
B00003CXA2|5.0|One of the best movies of all time! Tom Hanks' greatness can't even be described by words. I love this movie and never get tired of watching it!
B008XCM18Q|1.0|I tried, I really tried, but I did not like this book and actually gave up about half way through.  As a well-read historical fiction fan, I gave it a shot.  I generally do not enjoy action packed, violent, confusing, loud movies either and have never seen any of the Bourne series.  I usually find real books better than the Hollywood version and when the opportunity presented itself to read The Bourne Identity, I went into it with hopeful anticipation,  However, my first instinct was correct.  It just was not for me.  Thousands will disagree.  Chocolate and vanilla, makes the world go around.
086547897X|5.0|The Animator's Survival Kit--Revised Edition: A Manual of Methods is necessary have for all Animator's/Artist. It is well written and contains vivid imagery.  My child’s Animation teacher recommended this manual, and my child loves it. It breaks down drawing techniques and Animation basics. This book is 9 1/2 x 11 inches wide and about 1 1/2 inches thick; it has some weight to it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this game!  There are many different rooms to play, so it doesn't get boring.  The only thing I don't really like is in the free tournament the last three jewels are based on ranking.  It is really hard to get the higher rankings!  I wish they were based on games played or bingos won instead.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert has such an amazing voice that is well displayed on this CD.  It runs from fun, dance music to deeply personal and beautiful songs with lyrics that can break your heart.  This is a CD for anyone who really loves good music.
0345803485|2.0|I finally got this book and I don't understand what the big hype is all about. This book is slow and I stop reading it.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Started playing months ago and I haven't stopped yet I like that you can play all different types of slots and love the blackout lounge fullcard is great
006207394X|5.0|I love mysteries, but I also love courtroom dramas, and this book had a lot of both. While the mystery in he first part isn't particularly up to par with most of Christie's other works (there are very few suspects, and they're not as interesting as save for Elinor and her love triangle), it's still interesting to read. The ending reveals who the true killer was, and I have to admit that though I did suspect that that person was going to be the killer all along, his/her motive for the crime was what I hadn't expected, so in that sense it really did take me by surprise. Overall, I'd have to say that this is a very good book and would highly recommend it to anyone. Although my review may not have sounded so extolling, it really was a great read, and though the killer may have been predictable, his/her motive and how he/she did it was DEFINITELY unpredictable and fascinating.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This was a school required book....kept me guessing. Boring at times but had many parts where I couldn't put the book down.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Everyone knows the Evo 212 is an awesome cooler, but this would rival it if you ask me.  The two fans are a breeze to mount, and it keeps my CPU under 40C even with a small OC and full load.  It's easy to install and even comes with high quality cooler master thermal paste.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|Create part two or  with Angel  same but part two and make it awesome I want more but part two please more levels and everything
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I'm still getting the hang of my Kindle Fire.  Had to return to Factory Default twice due filling up storage space too much, too fast.  I've had to trust to leaving  lot of my content, carried over from a Kindle Keyboard, in the Cloud, or in the Purchased part of apps to download  only for immediate use.  I've learned to use Silk's &quot;delete history&quot; button often, and to Bookmark sites, rather than Download from them.  (And to have only one RPG game running at a time!)  The Clean Master app helps to keep my Kindle trim.  I use it several times a day to prevent cache creep, monitor residual files, and to clear RAM space by closing tasks.  Quite useful, and easy to use.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|I just caught this film on TVO in Canada and, having lived in the BRD (West Germany) for close to 30 years, was surprized at how true to life this film is. I know people in Germany who have relatives in the DDR and have heard many horror stories about their visits. Don't get caught watching West TV, don't talk openly about the government, don't make jokes about the high party officials -- brilliantly caught in one scene where a government worker is overheard telling a joke about Erich Honecker ....... I have also visited the DDR, after the wall came down and heard, first hand, what the daily life was. This film is a must see for every single person on the planet who believes in Socialism. It will change your ideology. Fantastic movie.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Very pleasant to the eyes, and like the moon phase info with the temperature. Would recommend it. The dimmer is a good idea too.
1934030597|5.0|The true idiots guide to mtb wrenching. A great reference for all things mtb!! With exploded drawings and simple yet detailed instructions, it makes almost any repair doable at home. A must have for those new to bicycle building/repair.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|Love this movie! I can watch it over and over again!! :) I live the actors they chose for this movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it its easy and awesome and perfect for bills and just anything A+ so get it while it's hot lol ......you will love it to so take your time to download it
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|The hook is so much better, as always. For all the hype I did not think it delivered.  Very slow moving and lost interest about 45 minutes into the movie
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I wanted to watch the series and figured I would read the book first, finished it in a day ,great read
B0036EH3X4|4.0|For five seasons Lost has been of the best TV series ever, BUT, for season 6 the screenwriters had opened too many loops in the story and had a hard time tying all the loose ends.<br />Particularly I dint´t like the final episode.<br />Great series though.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|It's hard to stop playing once u start. Some games are frustrating, not this one. Yet it is challenging.  Love it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|To watch the Star Wars Films on Blu-Ray is one of the best experiences ever.<br />The sound is incredible! 6.1 DTS. The picture quality is amazing, even for the older movies, they made it in a way that still hold up until now, specially Empire Strikes Back.<br />On the extras discs there are a lot of never before seen scenes, and documentaries. One of the features I liked the most is the Star Warriors documentary... the dream of every Star Wars die-hard fan.<br />Be warned, it does not contain the extras found on the DVDs, though.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Tesla would have been more famous and more wealthy, if he had been interested in that sort of thing.  But he was too busy doing the work, to care who got rich off it.  I never knew it was HE who invented the radio!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great Movie. Cool effect in the cover. DVD for backup. The documentary about the Batmobile is incredible with amazing details every comic fan would appreciate.
B00B10GYZ8|3.0|I expected more scenes of the making of Phsyco...but all in all actors were great not enough scenes with the actor portraying Norman..
140006922X|5.0|I'm not done reading it, but so far I'm very much enjoying it. I am a devout Mormon and I enjoy reading about the historical Jesus. I'm learning so much that I never knew.<br /><br />I already have a list of three people ready to borrow it when I'm done.<br /><br />This is the first time I've ever been grateful for Fox News. I saw a clip of that ridiculous interview and I knew immediately that I had to read the book.
B00DH4BL8Q|5.0|These books are amazing they are fantastic to read and extremely hard to put down, I would recommend these to anyone who loves a bit of adventure, happy reading.<br />Jasmine
B00C5R8364|4.0|Believable, entertaining, and relevant for our time.  Characters and situations well cast.  A definite recommended read.  Looking forward to more of this author's work.
B005IT0V8O|3.0|This is a classic, but it doesn't read well on my kindle or apple products. Not sure why but I haven't been able to trouble shoot the problem.
B003B02O0A|4.0|A reread for me for my Banned Books Challenge. Yep, this is on the banned list from the ALA along with many other notable books we should read or reread again. Worthwhile read for fans of southern novels, racial injustice,and suspense. Early Grisham books are worth a second look. Sequel is finally coming out soon after all this time! Enjoy! 4 stars
B008JFUPK8|1.0|As a 30+ year comic book fan I was in anticipation for this film. I had really loved what the Dark Knight Trilogy had done and Watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe expand from Phase 1 into Phase 2 pushed the whole genre to a new level.<br /><br />Man of Steel was supposed to be a chance for DC/WB to get their universe started strong and carry it through to an eventual Justice League franchise. I couldn't wait to see that universe unfold. I went opening day with my comic loving friends. As we watched all 3 of us couldn't believe what we were seeing. Horrible wooden dialogue and acting, a plot that seemed too rushed at times and then would speed up at other times, constant flashbacks, uncomfortable awkwardness, and digital effects that seemed out of date and not as seamless as other films in the genre. Really, I felt the quality of the whole film was just terrible. It just wasn't up to the standards as Nolan's Batman or Marvels universe films. Those films have a clear direction and are very confident in themselves. Man of Steel seemed to be a huge mess that didn't really understand what it wanted to say.<br /><br />When I first saw Iron man and Batman Begins in theaters I remembered thinking \\"wow! I can't wait to see what happens next!\\" Those films were near perfection, and laid a strong foundation for future films which continued to be great. The only thing I though after Man of Steel was...time to reboot again. In my opinion this was a terrible foundation to start a DC Cinematic Universe and I am scared to see what follows.<br /><br />If you liked the film I'm glad, I hope it was what you wanted.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Very fun and creative. Takes you to a wonderful place and left you begging for more. Absolutely a favorite. Can't wait for the next installment in the series.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a good deal for all of the Harry Potter Movies. Yes, they are all together in one case, but the quality is good and just what we wanted to for - to be able to watch the movies when we want.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like games where you have to think, but not word games? Then you need to get this app! I originally started to play when I got my fire. But turns out I got my grandma hooked, too. I also liked it so muck that whenever I finish it I erase it then re-download it. Sounds crazy right? But thatjust goes to show how great of a app this is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009DCOU9S|5.0|Fabulous. It kept my attention from beginning to end, the chapters getting progressively harder.  Never too difficult, except for some of the minigames<br /> which can be bypassed, but just hard enough to have me scratching my head for a day or two !
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The only part of the book I found entertaining were the witty interactions Ana and Christian shared via email. The book was poorly written. It was obvious the author took a thesaurus to it to make the book sound intellectual. The book has so much potential to be much better. I only read the whole book because I kept hoping it would improve.
B0031R5K68|3.0|It was a good yarn. However I was disappointed in the weak ending. I much preferred his latest offering &#34;Inferno&#34;
B0000714BP|5.0|who knew Wesley snipes, Patrick Swayze and john leguzamo could be drag queens.  if you are familiar with drag queens these guys do a great job. stockyard channing is a delight and a great comic foil to these characters. the quirkly little town's residents are fun and add the right touch. of course adding Julie newmar at the end was the best. a good cult film
B000SNW0HA|4.0|It's cool to listen to the beginning beats of this band.  It's lighter than you'd think it should be for trance.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A very disappointing John Grisham book.  The characters are not interesting, and it is difficult to know who is 'speaking' and where.  Grungy characters, poorly portrayed.
072325804X|5.0|Love the Peter Rabbit tales as a child and couldn't wait to share these with my own children.  This set is very nice set and would be a treasured addition to any nursery/book collection.
B003XRELGQ|4.0|I have to admit, I got this because it was either free or like 99 cents on sale and I needed a book.<br />I figured that it wouldn't kill me to read Vonnegut. (I know pathetic)<br /><br />Anyway, I was really pleasantly surprised and WISHED something this interesting had been assigned to me back when I was in school. I guess there is a reason that Vonnegut has such a following. I really enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading other books by him.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love the word prediction and the color templates! Would be nice if it had more smily-faces though, but still a good product!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie can't wait for the sequel to come out next year as it should be as great or even better!!!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Warning: Spoilers below:<br /><br />I liked the movie very much, even with changes in the script that differ from the book completely. Acting was brilliant for an adaptation of a book not as well known as most novels of adolescent troubles and resolutions (Kudos to Gilchrist, Roberts, and especially Galifianakis for playing their parts beyond my expectations).<br /><br />At first, I thought that this would be another pointless adaptation that some random putz in Hollywood would decide to make, disregarding the novel's actual storyline or meaning, and thus ruin. But as someone who read both the book first, and rented the movie here on Amazon, I was amazed at how much elements they kept on the movie from Vizzini's novel. Sure, Bobby's story was more emphasized on and Craig's eating disorder was never really touched upon, but even the revisions in the movie's writing were refreshing to see, and the movie still has the same philosophical experience to live for the day, Carpe Diem.<br /><br />The movie was a blast to watch, and heck, I might even re-read the book. The movie and book will forever remind me on a personal level that even when the world unfairly expects you to live up to its expectations, and life seems to occupy you from finding your natural purpose, hey, \\"That he not busy being born is busy dying\\".<br /><br />This movie made my(albeit disheartening)day. I highly recommend this movie, or even the book, to anyone that's ever questioned what their life should really be about :)
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|Dead Man Down is a Five Star Movie because of the Story, Acting and the Plot of Revenge can be Bitter Sweet.  This is a must see movie with two actors alone Colin Farrell who plays Victor the man out for Revenge and Noomi Rapace, as Beatrice the woman using Victor for the Revenge she wants against her drunk driver, who left her left side of her face disfigured when he hit her with his car.  The disfigurement was bad enough, but the children in the neighborhood, who harass this woman by calling her monster and throwing stones, etc. at her, as well as writing MONSTER on her apartment door.  They both were actors made for this movie, because of the acting they have done previously Colin Farrell with many Irish Films and Noomi Rapace as the \\"Girl with Tattoos\\" movies really played the role the two of them to perfection.  Direction by Niels Arden Opley was excellent capturing the right shots at the right time to add to the suspense the two were living through, writer credits (WGA) and was written by J.H. Wyman.<br /><br />The following actors with main roles are as follows Terrence Howard plays Alphonse one of the big bosses responsible for many killings past and present.  Along with Dominic Cooper playing Darcy a thug, Isablelle Huppert plays Beatrice's mother Valentine Louzon, Luis Da Silva Jr. plays another thug Terry, and Stu Bennett also playing another thug for one of the gangs was known, as Kilroy.<br /><br />Well known actor of many Gangster movies Armand Assante makes an appearance, as Lon Gordon a head mobster of the clientele bosses.<br /><br />This movie sure can be watched over again, as the story and acting is mesmerizing for any audience to know that revenge is truly bitter sweet for most of us in the end.<br /><br />Below is the link for a great Friday or Saturday night movie for adults, make up the popcorn and sit back and truly enjoy a wonderful action packed movie with great actors and very well written and directed.<br /><br />Enjoy my Friends:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00DHNJCKQ B00DHNJCKQ]]
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fantastic! Please send me sequel.<br />Graphics were good and mini games were enjoyable.<br />Storyline was quite good too.<br />Thank you.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|I did not think this album would be this good!! Of course it does not sound like the old Fall Out Boy but I like the new sound!!
B004HWYTP4|2.0|Not a new idea in the whole movie.  Decent casting, good premise, but it's been done before.  Would be a good instant video watch but not if you are paying....
B00CWV9FQA|5.0|I loved this movie. Humor, and not violent since they are legos! Granddaughters are sure to enjoy! I'm considering ordering to have in my library.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. It was cute and funny. It makes you want to go off to Vegas just to be in the same situation. It's a great book to read. A new twist on story's you hear about Vegas. It's a must read.
B005J0VPNC|4.0|It's fun. You can turn your family into the comic strip. And it's very easy to use. I recommend it.
1843106698|5.0|I only read half yet. But it gives me a new understanding of my 9 years old Asperger son. It has plenty of practical advice. It also gives you a glimps to Aspergers who do well if treated properly. This should give hope to parents of an Asperger kid.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I love his view of time and the innocence of human life. It's refreshing and satiates our feeling to not be forgotten.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I bought this for my mother's birthday, she loves it, especially the dowager countess character. What a great story, and told so well!
B003P2VBIK|3.0|First and foremost, I bought this book because I was hoping it would hold some resolution for the TV series.  It does not.<br /><br />It turned out to be a pretty good read most of the way through, though.. same basic concept, lots of interesting science concepts..<br /><br />My major problem with the book is the way it was written.  The climaxes of this book are in some really odd places.. and the end of the book completely goes off the deepend.. it turns into a strange story of philosophical and theoretical quantum physics - and the story totally loses steam when that happens.. and it gets really cheesy overall.<br /><br />I put the book down disappointed.  The last 100 pages really needed to stick to the same story-arch as the beginning of the book.  Lots of potential here wasted in the end.
B002ZDOXM6|5.0|I love these guys no matter what some people say about them. There music is awesome, and they are an or were an awesome band. How could you not like them. Great cd.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|I play this on my Samsung Galaxy Note II and I gotta say I'm a fan.<br /><br />Graphics are very nice and minimalistic.<br /><br />Sound/music is relaxing and mellow.<br /><br />Things I'd like to ask the developer(s):<br /><br />*fix the bug that doesn't save your games progress if you exit the app in a way that wasn't initially intended. (I.e. backing out, home button, battery dying)<br />*try to add some extra complexity to the game. One peraon mentioned taking away indicators to show if you've doubled up on a number or if you've achieved the correct sum. Maybe a timed mode or something.<br /><br />Other than a few requests.  I just wanted to say if you like sudoku, or math/brain teaser games iin general, this one is well worth the money.
B005K17RU0|1.0|New version absolutely horrible. Bring back the old version. This is the worst weather app I have seen. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
1423136802|5.0|This is a great series of books, that my son's have loved and still love to re-read.<br /><br />If you have children who love to read, try this series, since it is one that will keep them going!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am 14 and I think this game is awesome to play the annals are cool<br />And CREATIVE ANDAWSOM AND THE LAND'S ARE COOL
1419705644|3.0|It's okay for younger readers, I would guess. Lots of new material, pictures( I especially like the BMO users manual). I got two, one for myself and another for gifting.<br /><br />I was expecting to read more in-depth behind-the-scenes type stuff(like the Hyrule Historia). Was definitely unaware that this was going to be one of those books that was set inside the Adventure Time universe(like tales of Beedle the Bard and the other harry potter &#34;manuals&#34; and &#34;textbooks&#34;. Makes one think why didn't they make the Enchiridion instead.). What I really would have wanted was a book that answered my questions about the show, episode writers takes on characters and and storylines and such.
051755075X|1.0|IT STINKS...UNREADABLE!!!!!<br />Look at the a picture...any picture. Read the surrounding text!<br />2pt - 4pt type. AND this is a book on advertising?.<br />A total waste of time and money<br />Borders on fraud.<br />What a joke!!!<br /><br />Bruce Crawford
B000K3HTRY|4.0|Glad this movie didn't go overboard with it's off-the-beaten-path<br />approach to an unconventional courtship.<br />Characters are believable and satisfyingly physically matched.
0439023483|4.0|Great Book came in excellent condition! Def happy with everything and the way it turned out! &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
1400069807|4.0|Very thorough research and disturbing reports from Michael Moss. Ever consumer should read this book to realize what pons we've become to the food industry giants. Shameful.
B007F5SG22|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it is well written, has an incredibly relevant story to tell and best of all its not afraid to question the religious zealots and point out just what a brain freeze religion actually is. Its hard to believe that in this day and age you still get raving lunatics willing to kill you for insulting their particular brand of super hero in the sky. Its almost comical to think that these depraved nut jobs still thrive in a modern world. This book clearly highlights that they do and that they have absolutely no doubt that a better life awaits them after death. It truly amazes me that Ayaan was able to break these shackles and for that alone deserves every single star awarded.  Its such a pity that some of the brainwashed millions rampaging across the world today cant have half the moral fortitude of this woman.  Awesome read, cant recommend it highly enough.
0525478817|5.0|Cancer. Everybody by now knows this disease by now. Many people die because of it, and a death is never a happy moment. But this book made it all seem so real, made me believe this story like I was the one living it, it made me wish there was a way to stop it from happening. I fell in love with the characters as well as the story, it was just too easy. I´m a sucker for happy endings and you should be warned this is not one of them, even so the book has so many funny parts and easy going characters that the sad ending doesn´t feel like a sad ending. Hazel is a survivor and Gus a hero, and that´s what makes them a fantastic couple. Everyone should see that not all ends happily, but that dopesn´t mean it´s not a good ending.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a very good book and well written. I purchased it on-line for my I-pad and it worked wonderfully. Great to be able to &#34;carry&#34; more books in just a little I-pad.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As always this is s great mindless read. Love the adventures of Jack. Nothing better to help you escape from reality for a few hours
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|Have waited quite some time for this to come out on Blu-Ray.  If you're a fan of the movie, what else can one say?  It's Willow.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I was a fan of the original campy 1995 Judge Dredd with Stallone, so when I saw this pop up on Amazon Instant Video I figured I could do worse than kill 1h35m watching this remake. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Compared against the 1995 Dredd, the recipe for this remake is more parts serious than camp. The actor lineup is great and the characters are written with some nuance, which is refreshing.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a fan of the original, definitely give this movie a watch. If you're completely unfamiliar with Judge Dredd, this movie does well enough to stand on its own and merits a watch if you're in the mood for an action film.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|wow! can you escape is really fun and challenging. I think you should download this app. I hope there is a can you escape 2.
B005460302|5.0|Interesting blend of humor, provocative women, and horror!  You probablt will like this one if you like Evil Dead 2 from a humor stand point.
0718154770|5.0|As expected, bought this as part of a Christmas Gift and was well received, they just Loved it, Highly reccommended
B00CFA222M|5.0|I just absolutely loved this movie. The special effects were great, I didn't find the storyline to scary for my 11 year old, and it<br /><br />really gave a modern twist to an old classic. My only regret is that I didn't get a chance to enjoy the picture in the theatre.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|I don't know of any cd of Buddy Guy's that has been not great. He is a constant great music maker and any one who likes blues or r&b will like this cd.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A great way to kill some time, great for puzzlers! Not so hard that you can't eventually figure it out!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|I played this on FB and enjoyed playing , the fact that you can build your own tank is fun.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Heard so many great things about this keyboard.  I used swype back in its hey day but became sick of its controlling nature and cencorship of my cursed words so moved onto Google's stock keyboard and never looked back.  This app was offered free on Amazon so gave it a try.  I guess as an Android newbie many would be impressed but it's useless and over reaching.  Google's stock keyboard has the best and simplest features by far and works brilliantly with voice to text, end of story
1454704225|4.0|I like the book. It doesn't rank in my top ten favorites, but does provide lots of inspiration. My personal perspective on doodles is more making marks that add TO a piece of artwork rather than making little drawings. I think a lot of people would enjoy this book. Fun for all ages .
B000OIZUW6|5.0|One word expresses this tale: &#34;WOW!&#34; This story, presumably based on truth, describes how a group of women in Britain during World War Two were successfully recruited to be spies in France and blow up a major Nazi telephone installation that was closely guarded. To succeed would create  major havoc and a strong blow to the Germans' communication when the allied invasion was to take place. Extraordinary actions and valor had to be accomplishd in order for the project to succeed. Some lives were lost, but, of course, there was success.<br />  This story was very well written and easy reading. I strongly recommend it for those interested in tales touching on history.
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|This is a laugh out loud movie. It was so funny and well done. I am hoping for Dave to win an academy award..  Minions rock!
B000UFAURI|4.0|I find the negative critiques amusing but I think the album is pretty good even if it lacks the harder edge of FF's other work.  The 'ballads' show their versatility.
B005544V6A|4.0|This show is kind of corny but enjoyable and I plan on continuing to watch the remaining episodes of season 1.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great writing, great casting, and great stories. We love Elementary and this was recommended to us.  This is superior by far!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this weather app, it's easy to set up and easy to navigate.<br /><br />I would recommend this to everyone.
B0081336FO|5.0|Can't wait for Season 3!  The season finale was thrilling and we were at the edge of our seats.  Awesome
B005TVYVI2|5.0|I have used this in the pool for the last 3 weeks. I started swimming for triathlon 18 months ago, and am generally self-instructed through video's, occasional coaching advice, and watching video of my stroke. I was feeling I had a dead spot in my stroke, and wanted a way to increase cadence incrementally in a way that would enforce muscle memory. This device has done exactly that for the past 3 weeks. By helping reduce my dead spot, my hips stay parallel to the surface of the water more easily, and I am working less while increasing speed. I wear it tucked into my swim cap, and the tone is very audible, even when I wear ear buds while iistening to music during my work-outs. I know this has taken some hits for durability by other raters, but so far, it has been great for me.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This show is well done - it is filled with thought provoking issues of life. The preformances are believable. The characters are pithy and sincere. I love their sense of humor. The historic setting has much appeal - helping us understand times past as well as from where we have come.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game a lot its very fun and it teaches you a lot about horses and i really enjoy it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great writing and superb acting. I love Maggie Smith and I'm happy that she gets a lot of screen time in this series.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|A very enjoyable read. Enjoyed the non stamdard narative and found it a gard book to put down. Well written, light and amusing,
159463176X|3.0|Khaled Hosseini built his reputation as a decent storyteller, but he's not the most gifted writer.<br /><br />What began as an engaging tale of a brother and sister who lose each other early in their lives, devolved into an attempt to<br />give the reader a 60 year history of Afghanistan through way too many other characters and story lines.  The book would have been stronger had Hosseini limited his focus.<br /><br />Moreover, I found his writing uninspired, predictable, and often extremely clumsy and awkward.  Case in point:  &#34;Adel could almost feel himself leapfrogging over childhood.  Soon, he would land as an adult.&#34;  Oh, wow.<br /><br />I purchased this book on the basis of having read his previous novels but was disappointed.
B008VBYN80|4.0|A fun game but not historically correct as I thought it would be. If anything I thought there would be more types of structures.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is my go to app for accurate weather forecasting. I do like the bonus point added features that have been added. Great App
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am always hesitant to try things online, but once I tried Pinterest, I love it and would recommend it to my friends..
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Loved this book from cover to cover. Read it!<br />The author has a wonderful way of communicating different views and opinions on a sensitive subject.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I actually think it is better than the online version.  I have been having issues with the online version and have no trouble with full Facebook Free.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Wow, this book really kept me guessing. Thinking back on it now I still get a chill up my spine!<br />Page turner!
B008GXHOFW|2.0|This game didn't work! I tried to load it a few times but it didn't work if someone knows where I can get my coins back please tell.I want my money back.please
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|there is only one word for this album...perfect. Great musicians, great singers...this album has it all, one of Buddy's greatest albums, ever.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|Tolkien doesn't even have 6,000 reviews, and he has been available for years. George R R Martin, Stephen King, these guys barely reach 6000 reviews in 3 years.  The publishers are even worse, with their paid off blogs and multiple accounts. Readers are not stupid. You can't just pull the \\"WOOL\\" over their eyes.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Great product, pretty good price, ships well. That's really all I can say! It's a great show and it's nice to watch this beginning of the series.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book with the twists an  turns. A story that makes you want to keep reading to find out what is coming next
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I end my hectic day with this pleasant Zen-like activity.  It soothes and relax me; helps me feel as if I have accomplished something and yet it doesn't frustrate me.  Better then a  cup of tea.
B004IK8Q86|4.0|The characters, issues, and observations are as relevant today as when written.  Maugham has an acute insight into human behavior and motivation,  the read is smooth and absorbing.
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|It was good but a little boring and it felt like things were repeating themselves. It was a little to intimate for my taste.
0800141660|5.0|Fortunately, for me a great deal of praise has been written about this movie and the brilliant screenplay that created it.  The only thing I will add is that I have watched it 4 times and will continue to for many years to come.  If you are open to this type of movie, you will be profoundly rewarded.  The sound track is also exceptional.
014241011X|5.0|This is another feel good story by Roald Dahl, ridiculously crafted to provide a good laugh to young children and adults too.<br />The Witches started off by providing a narration that one of the most pressing security problems in this world was the existence of Witches.  And they were notorious for plotting of purging the world of children.  There's only one reason for this: Children produces foul stench.<br /><br />While the witches all over the world are busy plotting their evil plans, a young boy who is living with his grandmother was being taught on how to recognize witches.  This is in the hope that whenever or wherever he goes, he will have an easy time to distinguish witches from normal women.<br /><br />Then one day, when the boy and the grandma went for vacation in a well-known hotel, the young boy accidentally witnessed the yearly witches' convention being held there.  It is in that convention that the boy learned of the greatest evil plan being cooked by Grand High Witch and that is: brewing a formula that will turn all children into mice.  And then she went on discussing the strategies that need to be done for the success of their plans.<br /><br />It was unfortunate, however, that while the strategy was being discussed; the witches discovered the young boy and forced him to drink the formula, thus, turning him into a mouse.  In his desperation to save the children from turning into mice, the young boy escaped to return to his grandmother.  He then told her of the plot.  Together, they draw a plan to beat the witches.<br /><br />This plan turned out to be turning witches into mice by stealing the formula and pouring it to the witches' dinner.  All the witches turned into mice.  There was an outbreak of vermin inside the hotel which the staff immediately solved by killing all the mice.  That was one problem down the drain.<br /><br />Not satisfied with just killing the attendees of the Witch Convention, the boy and his grandma concocted another plan to fully top the witches.  And that is to travel to the Grand High Witch's Castle where they will turn all her minions into mice.  To manage the infestation, they will then release cats into the castle.<br /><br />Just like any of the Roald Dahl books, this one left a smile on my face after reading it.  It was simple yet crazy and outrageously written.  A perfect read for those who would like to relieve stress in an instant.  My only disappointment with this book is that the child didn't transform back into a human. And he was ready to accept it when he could have done a lot of things against the witches when he's human and all.  And well, the grandma wasn't a ray of sunshine either.  I wish there was more in the ending than an old lady telling his grandson that he only have 9 years to live.<br /><br />What about you? Was  Roald Dahl a part of your childhood?ully top the witches.

0062014536|2.0|Lauren Oliver's last book for the Delirium Trilogy was aptly titled as I literally lamented over this joke of a book.  I am a die-hard fan of Lauren ever since I've read Before I Fall and Delirium. I have fallen inlove with the way she make poetry out of these books, so deep and poignant that you'd just want to lie down and relive the moments in your mind. But Requiem made me howl in rage. How did that beautiful poem turned into an insensible haiku? It was as if Lauren didn't know how to end the story gracefully like she was somehow lost in limbo.<br /><br />Pandemonium had ended in a thrilling cliffhanger when Lena discovered that Alex is still alive.  And that ending made me expect a lot from this book.  The days that I pondered on how it would be delivered was like I was on a pilgrimage.  Only to realize in the end, that my whole purpose was for nothing.<br /><br />More than anything else, Requiem's plot was so shallow and dragging. Almost two thirds of the book was dedicated to either Lena's musing about Alex or hers and the Invalids' journey to this and that. I don't have any problem if they need to undertake journeys as long it's not overly done that it becomes boring.  And I had had enough of that in the second book, thanks by the way.<br />And as if that wasn't enough of a torture, we were also given unessential accounts of Hanna's life like it was wholly important to the cause of the Invalids. Mind you, Lauren even failed to describe how Hanna should behave after her cure from amor deliria nervosa was unsuccessful.<br /><br />Requiem's character development was also stunted like things did not recover from the pandemonium that had taken place in book 2. Alex became a background character that without the nudges from the author, you'd forget that he was the one who set things in motion in Delirium. What about Julian Fineman, our hero in the second book? Well, since Requiem is all about Lena and Hanna, he was also reduced to a wallflower.  And that goes the same for the other characters, disposable summer decorations.<br /><br />To complement the boring character development, aside from being shallow and dragging, the plot was totally predictable. Well, there were twists planted along the way but I think these were done in a last attempt to save the whole thing from crumbling into pieces.  Most unfortunately, Requiem is far from salvation as it ended with a striking disappointment. Yeah, open ending. As in literally, with plenty of unanswered questions, you know what I mean. It was like you endured all those to-die for heartaches, persevered the hardships and fought all those battles in books 1 and 2 for a BIG NOTHING. Nada.<br /><br />There's only one thing that I liked about this book and that was how Lena and her mother finally made up.  At least, there was a bit of a drama there.<br /><br />In an overall note, Requiem epically failed to deliver.  And I hope Lauren would take time to ponder on things that make this book a major flop and not make the same mistake on her new book.  Otherwise, I might settle for fan fictions which I think would make a far better conclusion to what should have been a grand series.ame for the other characters, disposable summer decorations.<br /><br />To complement the boring character development, aside from being shallow and dragging, the plot was totally predictable.

0547258305|3.0|You must probably know by now that my appreciation for Fire just extended to the fact that it has a story to tell.  You can read my review here.  However,  my forgiving nature got the best of me and that my optimistic side was inclined to think that Graceling (the series' very first book to be published)  was a better read.  So will you come along as I try to recap all my views about this book?<br />My review...<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />Alright. Okay. So Graceling was a better book than Fire but generally, it wasn't as impressive as I hoped to be.  The first chapters were okay and I was actually flipping the pages like crazy.  It was like being a house on fire where at the middle stage, everything went dull and gray.<br /><br />There was so much potential that was wasted in this book.  One, why did Cashore directed the heroes to go after Leck immediately when she could have created a twist along the way? And why did Randa--for his toughness and cruelty--just easily gave up on Katsa when he could have made efforts to make everyone's life complicated?  That would have been fun.<br /><br />It's just so hard to grasp that King Leck with his powerful grace was easily defeated.  And it made him look like a warm up act. The story is poorly written like Cashore was in a hurry to be done with it.  So yes, I also read the book without even bothering to stop and glorify how the story is unfolding.  You can actually read the first chapters, skip the middle part and proceed to the ending. You will still understand it perfectly.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />Despite my severe disappointment with this book, I am surprised to discover that I actually liked Po.  He's calm, focused, selfless and mature.  Katsa's okay but I didn't like how she never overcame her fear of marriage.  What's up with Cashore with this one?<br /><br />And Leck, the villain, was actually quite scary in Fire (the very first chapter that is).  But in Graceling, he had lost that glory.  I wish I had read more of him, to know him and to know what really pushed him to become evil.  In Graceling, he only appeared near the end and was killed immediately. *sighs* I mean, come on!<br /><br />Dialogues and Interactions<br /><br />Dialogues and interactions weren't really Cashore's strongest points.  Actually, looking back at the two books, I couldn't seem to remember funny moments or exceptionally intense moments that would actually make your heart ache.  I can't even feel a lot of chemistry or be overwhelmed by Katsa and Po's love for each other.  There are books out there that even without the heroine and hero being  together, you can still feel the love, the intensity of emotions that your heart will just cry and ache for them.  Instead of this happening, I am merely annoyed of the fact that Katsa has to reiterate again and again that she doesn't like marriage. And Po has choice whether to take it or leave it. Baahh!<br /><br />And what about Bitteblue?  She wasn't a good actress. I can't feel her loss. Perhaps I'm blind but I can't see her agony  of losing her mother. Yes, she was tough but it was hard to relate to her.  The way she acted, it's like she didn't just lost the most important person in her life.<br /><br />Lessons Learned<br /><br />Your choices define who you are- as demonstrated by Katsa and Po that even if they have dangerous graces, they still chose to be heroes than villains.<br />That evil can't be stopped and one must keep fighting to keep it at bay- So true because evil will always be there and it is up to us what we do about it.<br />This now ends my book review.  I hope you weren't discouraged by my harshness but instead keep you reading for more books to find the perfect one.  What about you? What have you been reading for the past days?

0316067598|5.0|I have read lots of military books and so far I this is one of my favorites. I would recommend it
0345803485|2.0|To be honest, I was not quite impressed with how this book turned out. I cannot bring myself to relate to Christian or to Anastasia. It saddens me that the book which had so much potential failed to stir in me that kind of passion experienced by Anna. I give this book 2 stars.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The OC in me tells that FSG's plot is dull and poorly written like the author was just in a hurry to make some scene where she can insert the sexual intimacies of Anna and Christian. I think the book was just highly publicized and it actually projected an image that it's really good. Honestly speaking, some of the romance short stories that I've read which have almost the same subject matter are far better than this one. What I only admire in FSG is that the author is really detailed with the movements that you can vividly picture what has been going on with Anna and Christian. And of course, I also admired how E.L. James described the methods and the s-xual gadgets that were used. Although I have to say that some of the scenes really disgusted me that it almost made me throw up.<br /><br />Another reason that I don't like about FSG much is that I'm hardly convinced of what kind of lesson it's trying to convey to the readers. I don't want to put spoilers here so you better read and judge the book.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />I don't know about you but I'm quite sure with myself that there's no character that I liked in this book. Anna's character is as empty as my gaping mouth as of this moment. Why do I have this feeling that E.L. James only created the girl so that Christian can have someone to practice his BDSM tactics? And Christian, he's just a s-x starved guy who has no redeeming qualities at all. Of course, he's handsome, he's rich, gallant and all that but I could never consider him as my hero no matter how \\"good\\" he is in bed. Some of his s-xual moves left a bitter taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Interactions and Dialogues<br /><br />Perhaps, with the previous paragraphs that I've written, you already have an idea as to what I'm going to write here. The author did not really strive hard to make the interactions and dialogues of the characters a reason to fall in love with. I am not impressed with how the characters interact with each other. I do not even find Anna or Christian's dialogue to be witty and charismatic.<br /><br />Overall Impression<br /><br />I am greatly dissatisfied with FSG which is maybe one of the reasons why it took me so long to make a review even though I've finished reading it 3 months ago. I am only making a review because I want to share to you that even if I do not like the book, it doesn't mean that I'm condemning the readers for reading it. ( Again, there's nothing wrong with exploring and understanding your s-xuality. And it would never be wrong if you find the courage to read the book and decide that you like it, that it made you understand one part of yourself a lot better.) And of course, to vent out my frustrations with FSG. I was actually expecting so much from it and I thought that I'd fall head over heels in love with Christian and cry with Anna but at the last page, I ended up not liking it. And I was left in the middle of something where I questioned myself, why did I waste my time reading it? Why did I have to spend my time with Anna who's will is weaker than her own knees? Why did I have to spend my time listening to a shallow, no-good man like Christian who only knows how to \\"you-know-what\\" hard?<br /><br />I'm not sure if I'm going to read the next two books. But because I'm an OC bookworm and would like to put closure to what I've started, I might just read them but that would really take a loooooong time.vious paragraphs that I've written, you already have an idea as to what I'm going to write here.

Kindle time...Still love it as much as I did the first time I read. If you like Koontz, dogs, research into recombinant DNA, Frankenstein, or just want something to catch your imagination this will do. I have recommended this book to hundreds of people in the last xx years & everyone has loved it. I think I counted 3 typos in the kindle edition. No biggie. Print versions have the same problem. The writing was incredible. Just try it.
0385737955|4.0|Intro<br /><br />The first time that I've seen the Maze Runner Series was when I was out for a stroll in one of our local bookstores. I was contemplating whether I should buy Gregor the Overlander series or Artemis Fowl. Undecided, I browsed the Y/A section and the Maze Runner caught my attention. The pull was there so after reading some reviews in Goodreads, I went back and bought the trilogy.  The rest was history.<br /><br />Plot<br /><br />The very first thought that came into my mind after finishing this book was: SCARY. It was gripping and mind boggling. Every time I turn a Maze Runner page, there's always something in the pit of my stomach trying to unseat me with suspense.<br /><br />Maze Runner is a trigger of adrenaline rush especially when the Glade Runners are surveying the maze whilst risking their lives to outwit and outlast those menacing Grievers. These night time struggles through that vast maze always gives me a chill that I always find myself panting like I've also been running with Thomas, Minho and the rest of the runners.<br /><br />I especially love how everyone was suffering from amnesia because it really adds to the tension of the whole story.  Not to mention that I like the mystery surrounding Teresa's person enhancing my urge to finish the book and find out what really had happened.  Why there was a maze? Why everyone is suffering from amnesia? What's the whole point of imprisoning a lot of teenage boys in a dangerous maze?<br /><br />This book is an excellent portrayal of surviving the unknown.<br /><br /> Characters<br /><br />After much deliberation with myself, I finally decided that my favorite characters for this book would be Minho, Thomas and Newt.  They were well developed and really suited to unravel the mystery of the maze.<br /><br />Minho is an overall leader.  Meanwhile, Thomas fits the description of a second-in-command, curious and would always do everything in his power to prove his worth. His dexterity in solving the maze was outstanding.  His compassion for his fellow Gladers is infectious that by the end, you are desperately hoping that everyone would survive so as not to crush him.<br /><br />Dialogues and Interactions<br /><br />Except for the use of too many fictionalized slang that renders you rereading the dialogue to comprehend the discussion, the dialogues and interactions of this book is alright.  Anyway, once you set your mind with the slangs, everything should flow wonderfully into your brains.<br /><br />Moral Lesson of the Story<br /><br />Never give up- Maze Runner is a dystopian novel of survival even if the means are almost unavailable.  With Thomas unwavering desire to get out from the maze, he finally solved it with his extraordinary skills and the help of his friends.was outstanding.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I just seen this online and its better then expected. Far better then the most recent. I'm not much for reviews so I will say its a must see even if your not a fan.
0316228583|3.0|Plot<br /><br />I will be biased on this one.  There are so many things in this world that I do not like and number five on that list is Politics.  This is the primary reason why it took me 2 weeks to finish reading the book that could have been read for 2-3 days.  While reading through the pages of TCV, I kept losing energy to scroll down to the next page. I admit that I was never a fan of politics and all I have for it is hatred.<br /><br />Reading TCV was like walking in oblivion where you just give up trying to determine the kind of direction that you wanna go to.  Perhaps I'm crazy or just plain old stupid but I failed to grasp the whole point of the book.  So Barry Fairbrother, the old good Parish Councillor, died.  And almost everyone developed self-interest on the vacancy his death had created.  And a war between pro and anti-Barry and his ideals suddenly engulfed the little town of Pagford.  Within the two warring camps, mini-wars are also been waged between married couples, parents and children, teenagers to teenagers, friends to friends, etc.  In addition to that, there's also rape, prostitution and poverty issues that need to be solved. There are a lot of conflicts in the book that while reading through it, you'll just find yourself lost and had to make hasty reviews of the previous pages.  In simpler words, there are a lot of conflicts in the book that failed to connect at the end.<br /><br />For example, I could not quite fathom the necessity to kill Krystal Weedon (one of the important characters of the story) for something that is not related to the purpose of the book. The reason of her death was because of her own stupidity and selfishness and was not in any way related to the main conflict of the book.  At the end of the story, it did not solve if Bellchapel clinic would remain to cater the rehabilitation of all drug abuser or if the Fields will be transferred to the jurisdiction of Yarvil. It did not even provide a clear solution whether her mother, Terri Weedon, had come to her senses and turned a new leaf from her heroin addiction.  And most importantly, how was Krystal's death impacted the local election of Pagford and the intentions of those people who are in the Parish Council Seats?  Alas, there's only a little impact.<br /><br />And there was Miles, who finally won the election not because he was good but because he was just the winner of all losers who run for the casual vacancy.  In the end, there was no mention what kind of steps he'll be taking to improve the quality of living in Pagford and most importantly, did the events of the book changed his  views on the Fields and Bellchapel Clinic?<br /><br />There are so many things that I would like to question about TCV.  About how some scenes were more like fillers than being essential to the portrayal of the whole plot.  And as I am typing this review right at this moment, I am feeling the itch to delete the whole document because I could not even properly arrange my thoughts about the book. It was confusing, like a magic spell that gone haywire.<br /><br />I suggest that if you want to know the whole story, please do the obvious and read it.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />So after the plot disappointed me, I am in for another disappointment with the characters.  There are so many of them that I failed to empathize with any of them.  The characters were either shallow or self-centered or arrogant or just plain stupid. I do not even like Mary Fairbrother, who, even at the death of her husband remained unforgiving.  Seriously, isn't there someone on the book who has the slightest redeemable quality? The oldies were even annoying as the teens.<br /><br />Sometimes, you love the book because of its plot eventhough the characters are so darn hateful. But TCV has neither plot nor characters to love about.  Pagford is full of people who are self-righteous, self-centered, and arrogant.  Thus, you wonder why that Pagford is still there and not crumbling into pieces.<br /><br />Interaction and Dialogue<br /><br />Well, the only redeemable thing about TCV is that I find the interactions and dialogue of the characters witty and funny.  And eventhough, some of the dialogues weren't the type to pass for an intelligent convo, it gave me this feel-good feeling.  I guess I have to give JK Rowling the salute for always making conversations and interactions among characters interesting, funny and at the same time, sad.<br /><br />I especially like the interactions between the Mollison family (Howard, Shirley, Miles, Samantha and well, Mo).  And that of the Price family.  The first family appeared to be united but on a deeper sense, they are very much divided. Like how Shirley disliked Sam and vice versa.  Like how Sam disliked his own husband Miles.  And who would ever forget about the Price family? The brutal, sadistic and stupid father Simon Price and his wife who stopped using her brains.  And Andrew Price, the acne-faced son, who I'm not really sure if he is on her mother or father's side.<br /><br />Overall Impression<br /><br />Because of the effort and the interesting dialogues, I give TCV three (3) stars.  The book could have saved its face if:<br /><br />The ending did not make us hanging on a cliffhanger.<br />The plot was not that complicated, having a lot of corners to turn and only to find out that it's a dead end.<br />There's one character that emerged a hero/heroine at the end. I don't see Krystal or Sukvhinder or Arf or Price falling into that category.<br />The characters weren't so many that while reading the book, you feel like you're drowning from memorizing all the names of the character.<br />Moral Lesson of the Story<br /><br />This is a new portion of my book review which I have forgotten to add into my previous reviews.  As I have said in the \\"About Me\\" Section, there are no crap books.  Critiquing a novel is always based on your personal opinion and is therefore, subjective.  Aside from being a work of art,  books are a great way to pick up moral lessons that in one way or another teach us something as we go on with life.  No matter how frustrated I am with the book, there's always the silver lining out there and that is, I will learn something from what I've read.<br /><br />TCV is actually a perfect depiction of the \\"everything is connected to everything\\" concept.  Our every action produces consequences that do not only affect us but also affect (directly or indirectly) everyone and everything around us. This teaches us to be always mindful of our actions and anticipate the likely consequences.<br /><br />Second, TCV teaches us one of the most basic lessons in this world: the importance of the parents' guidance on a growing child. In TCV, we saw how the little town of Pagford was rocked because of the actions of teenagers who were neglected and abused by their parents.  Had they been treated with care and positively supported by their parents, things in Pagford could have happened differently... less trauma, no deaths and a better community.to pieces.<br /><br />Interaction and Dialogue<br /><br />Well, the only redeemable thing about TCV is that I find the interactions and dialogue of the characters witty and funny.

0385738765|5.0|My Review<br /><br />The story started off immediately where the first book ended. And it instantly gave me a ride to the world of nightmares as Thomas and his friends encountered Cranks and dead bodies.  Not a pretty good morale booster after you just survived the Maze and those horrifying Grievers.<br /><br />Another good thing about this book is that it does not give us any idea that it's book filler.  Here, we see a glimpse of the world where everything has fallen into devastation where majority of the populace became the living versions of one's nightmare. And the setting of the book, a wasteland desert with a brutal climate that would total spin your world, added a tension to the challenge Thomas and the gang have to face. Everything, the whole world, seemed to come and get you like a hurricane.<br /><br />I especially liked the scene where Thomas and Brenda played hide and seek with a group of Cranks.  It was terrifying and revolting when you try to imagine what would happen if these disease ridden people got hold of them.<br /><br />I also love that James hinted about Thomas and Theresa's future relationship. And it's making me happy because although I like Theresa for being a bringer of mystery in book 1, I never did like her as a person or someone who deserves Thomas.<br /><br />There are a lot of things to like about the book: Thomas' maturity and focus, setting, plot, betrayal, loyalty between friends amidst the odds, survival of the fittest, the thrilling scenes and the anxiety whether Thomas and the gang will succeed in getting the cure.<br /><br />This novel is surely fast-paced, no drags, and definitely a page turner. If you want action, drama, grossness, thrill in a dystopian world then this book is a must.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|Though a little more traditional and mature hard rock than typical past A7X, it nonetheless rocks with a great throwback feel of Metallica and Sabbath heavy riffs.  I still like Nightmare a little better, and still listen to it everyday, but with Hail I can shuffle the songs around and get some awesome rock time on my drives.
0385738781|3.0|My Review<br /><br />You must have noticed that the summary I've written is directly copied from Goodreads when I usually create my own gist for every book that I've read. I am using symbolism here, guys. It means that just like the book, I've lost my fire in writing an original summary.  For me, The Death Cure is a sore disappointment when you think about the Maze Runner and Scorch Trials.<br /><br />So it was good that the major question in our mind was answered, why there's a need for a test, would the characters we've come to love survive the deadly disease, would everything be okay.  That was fine and everything.  What irked me was that there are a lot fight scenes in this book that it was almost an exaggeration. Yeah, I understand that it's got to be action packed but some of the scenes were just unessential.<br /><br />Another major problem that I have with this book is that, where's a mature Thomas that I've come to love in book 1 and book 2? It seems that with all the things going on in his world, he's also losing his heart. For some reason, I didn't feel that he grieved for Newt, who had stuck with him from the very beginning, when the latter was proven to be not immune to the disease. It was near the end when he remembered that he had a heart afterall by trying to save Theresa. But even that looked like a last attempt of JD to say that Thomas has grown.<br /><br />And there's Theresa who had been a major character from book 1. What about her? I admit that I didn't like her but what I didn't like most was how James Dashner dispatched her like a secondary character in this book. She played a major role in 1 and 2 but suddenly, she's gone blending into the background like a dull wallflower. And Brenda, who's supposed to be a secondary character, became the instant heroine of this book. How did that happen?<br /><br />My last problem would be why in the world that Thomas and the gang suddenly ended up in a green paradise where majority of the world is ridden with Cranks? I mean come on, the ending is just like that when JD could have done a better job? JD could have just hinted that upon arrival at the paradise, the heroes are working on a cure or Thomas has discovered in his uncured amnesiac something that might be able to restore the good in the world.  But no, instead we are treated to a scene where the heroes are building their new home unmindful of what's happening in the other realm.<br /><br />That was pretty long. Sorry, if I got carried away. Though this book was a disappointment, it still has a few good things to think about. One is Minho who had always been a consistent character from the very beginning.  He's just an awesome leader, focused and firm and just cool.  And then Newt.  I didn't expect that he got so brave in accepting death and asking Thomas to kill him.  And I think it wouldn't hurt to say that this book has at least provided some clarifications to our major question.<br /><br />On a general perspective, this book is okay with the fact that I finished it.  But I'm still hanging with the loose ends JD has failed to connect at the end. To put it in a simpler note, the momentum is there with The Scorch Trials but The Death Cure simply failed to reach its climax.<br /><br />Anyway, I still recommend this book if you are an action book addict or just to complete the whole series.  No loose ends, remember? Don't mind my wicked review because WICKED is good.with Cranks? I mean come on, the ending is just like that when JD could have done a better job?

B0073COMUW|5.0|Of the four I tested (4 different kinds), this was probably the one I will use the most, as it is 10 watts and less expensive than the HitLIghts AffordXII 12 watt lamp.  The latter is brighter (as it should be) but this 10W bulb, with identical cool white daylight light, is plenty bright and less expensive.  Both lamps are great, but this is bright enough to replace the 14W florescent floods in my kitchen ceiling and will give much better light.<br /><br />A great buy!
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I love this movie - it is based on the true story of Aaron Ralston and James Franco does a good job of living out this horrific experience.  What I love about Aaron is his optimism and &#34;think forward&#34; perspective.  He never actually gives up.  Aaron realizes his perilous situation but is used to always surviving difficult moments and finally finds a way out - and saves his own life.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone because it displays our drive for survival as human beings and shows that even in impossible situations, there is always hope when you're willing to work for it.<br /><br />Five stars!!
B00197POXG|5.0|I love it  was what I expect and a litte extra. I watched the series when it was on television
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|This is a great box set for some great classic movies. Mel Gibson in one of his iconic roles Mad Max. These movies take place in a bleak future, these films are very dark and gritty. Max a police officer in this desolate world loses his wife and child to this nomadic gang. This sends Max off the deep end and seeking revenge on these twisted roads of the outback.

B008JFUPFI|5.0|This is the modern Superman film that we have been waiting for. I cannot emphasize that enough. It is not a flawless masterpiece - in spite of the obvious similarities and parallels, this is not on quite the same level as Batman Begins - however, it absolutely gets the conceptual approach that was needed to take this character and re-launch him as a realistic, real-world entity in the heavier landscape of the twenty-first century. Not everyone likes this, but that just goes to demonstrate an ideological divide among viewers.<br /><br />Superman has spent far too long chained to nostalgia for either his 1930s/1940s origins and/or the aesthetic and tone of Richard Donner's iconic 1978 film. Even in 2006 Superman Returns was looking decades back into the past for inspiration. Not that there is anything wrong with reveling in a franchise's heritage. But that should never consume a character. Man of Steel takes the core concepts and brings them forward to the present, and it does a wonderful job of it.<br /><br />I used the word \\"realistic\\" a few sentences back - of course a being with superhuman powers is not a real thing in our world. But this film is science fiction. It is a first-contact story, designed to show how such an event might play out if it did occur. Thus, the characters (all of them, including Superman and the other the Kryptonians) act and react like real people, because they are real people. This version of Krypton involves more of a focus on technology, but it is just advanced technology, not magic. As the saying goes, any sufficiently advanced technology at first seems that way.<br /><br />Again, I do not consider this film a masterpiece. The script could be better, for one thing, and some of the editing is a bit jumpy. And so forth. But the thing is, Man of Steel's virtues far, far, far outweigh any of its weaknesses. It is beautifully rendered in the cinematography and visual effects, wonderfully cast with a group of terrific actors, and contrary towhat some may say, has substantial heart and emotion at its core.<br /><br />There is the issue of the ending, but for me, it is a complete non-issue. Again, this is intended to be a realistic take on Superman. He is not a god, he is not immune to mistakes or shortcomings, and he is just starting to fully embrace the implications of his heritage and his abilities when everything goes crazy, and the earth and humanity are basically in danger of destruction. Nothing about what happens contradicts the identity of the character. Those who disown this film because of the levels of action or destruction are completely missing the point, if I may be so bold as to say so.<br /><br />The main thing is that in spite of its imperfections, Man of Steel is a very special film. It is a new type of superhero film. It looks different, feels different, is different. We are fortunate that we were not given just another cartoonish episode or just a retread of what has already been done in the past. This is the opening chapter of a new world. Not everyone will love it or appreciate its qualities, but this mythology is moving forward, and I am energized and inspired to be along for the ride. If you have not seen it yet, approach it with an open mind, treat it like it is really happening, and it may very well take you someplace beautiful and meaningful.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It needs more levels, I have the full version.  However, the lobster looks like something else that is not nice.  So I would restart the game when it came up.

B00BATWJFE|4.0|Really funny book, hard to put down. The main character is so sympathetic - you'll definitely be rooting for him!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Karl Urban does a wonderful job as Dredd.  This is one of those movies where you are not expecting much, but turns into a fun filled non-stopped action movie.  It's like dystopian DIE HARD and we all could use a little more DIE HARD in our live.  Big shout out to the lady that plays ma-ma.  It's great to see a lady as the main villain.
B001O1O71C|4.0|This is an amazing story of innocence, friendship and naivety. I enjoyed reading about Bruno and his friendship with Shmuel.  .
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|I liked &#34; Hail to the King&#34; but there are other songs just as good if not better. &#34; Crimson Day &#34; pretty cool ballad, &#34; Requiem&#34; also good, and two other i really like and give the single &#34; hail to the king&#34;  some competition. I really didn't get it for the because of the title song and didn't think I would like the rest of the album but was surprised. I would definitively recommend it , St. James is also awesome ( song about the Rev) ONLY on the Deluxe edition. Different sound but still A7X.

Most helpful to know how much battery life is left in real time when performing different functions and how long it will take to recharge.  The battery app far exceeded my expectations.  It also reports the health of your battery.  Recommended purchase.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I was told that this was the funniest movie and I HAD to see it.  About halfway through, I had to ask my partner if he had laughed yet because I hadn't.<br /><br />Still, there is some value in it.  The despicable bad guy finds his heart with the help of three orphans.  Yeah, you can watch this cartoon with your kids.  But if your kids aren't around, why bother?

B00DC7N9NS|1.0|As a life long fan of the Wizard of Oz, I will admit that I was extremely hesitant to even watch this \\"prequel.\\"  However, the kids won out, so we rented the movie last night and I tried to give it a chance.  It was even worse than I imagined it would be.  I'm so offended by the film that I don't even know where to start in this review.  I'll start by saying that the female characters (Kunis, Weisz, and Williams) do the best they can with the material and are the only good points in the film.  James Franco, on the other hand, killed a little piece of my soul with his awkward, stilted, and BORING performance as the Wizard.  He just doesn't have the personality to pull off the role.  Not that it was written particularly well, but instead of making the most of it, he actually takes in the opposite direction.  His performance makes the lack of story and decent writing even more obvious.<br /><br />The over-the-top CGI is distracting and not exactly \\"breath-taking.\\"  It seems like a gimic and looks a lot more like a Dr. Suess landscape than what you imagine as the Land of Oz.  Two of the main characters are CGI...and look it.  There is no moral to the story.  There is no heart.  There is no moment where you feel like you've watched something that you would watch again.  And then have your children watch.  For over 70 years.  My five year-old son doesn't even want to watch it again.  And he will watch a movie 100 times if he likes it. But there is no magic in this film.  Just some bad writing, bad acting, bad computer graphics, and two hours of your life wasted.  Oh, but you do have a munchkin song.  After which you'll want to flush your ears.  Yes, it's that bad.<br /><br />I have to go watch the real Wizard of Oz now to cleanse my palate and re-fill my soul.

B0081JPTCQ|1.0|It's crap! Trying to get me to download more stuff for an app I already paid for is crap! This is a crap app! Don't waste your money on a sub par app that is barely functional in the first place. I deleted the crap and downloaded Classic Notes + App Box by Fluffy Decisions. It's worth the money and gives you everything you need for note taking in one package without wanting you to download more crap!
B000P0J09C|5.0|Great movie!!! I don't understand why Amazon gave me a free download for the movie after I bought it.  Sorry Amazon...I don't see the point of doing this if I am buying the disk.  I never used the download FYI.

B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|This book was so riveting, I plowed through the rest of the trilogy in a week. The characters are so beautifully drawn and the action superbly narrated. Tom Rob Smith is a tremendously gifted writer who puts you right with his characters in the thick of it all. The story is well-plotted and a real nail biter. Loved this book and the two that followed it.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This game is great and personally I love it too! But you can 'chat' online with each other. My younger brothers found this out and then they played together. :) Then they found out they can kill animals: Cows, Pigs, Chickens &amp; Sheep. After that they started killing animals with weapons (wooden swords, stone swords, iron swords, gold swords &amp; diamonds swords). After that they tried to do the same with each other. They ended up killing each other every time they played. The youngest brother usually screamed. :  AND they have to have Internet to play with each other! Which meant we had to be bugged for my Internet password. So... I wouldn't really give this game to anyone.

B006GWO5NE|1.0|I purchased my Kindle Fire, 7 inch tablet in Feb, 2013.It did not come with the USB cord as it was supposed to. Amazon shipped it, free, in April 2013, but I failed to try it within the 30 day return window. When I did attempt to use the cable in June, it did NOT fit my Kindle. Now I need a replacement that fits, and can't seem to locate one on its site, nor exchange what was sent in April, nor get reliable assistance to determine the correct USB cable for my device. So, I am dissatisfied, to say the least!
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|The touts itself as S Pen ready, but it does not detect the heaviness of the stroke as well as any native S Pen app. When trying out different strokes to test the app, it changes stroke size instead of the gradual increase in stroke. Its a good drawing app overall, but the S Pen support could really use some work. Perhaps more stroke sizes for non S Pen devices.
B008ULRY78|5.0|I was skeptical when I first decided to watch this movie, especially since I had never heard of it. I took a chance hoping there would be some good action. I was not disappointed at all. This movie has some really intense fighting scenes, and just when you thought you saw a great fight, here comes yet another one that's even better! This movie is packed with a lot of action. I definitely recommend this movie if you're into martial art fighting and/or action movies.

0670026557|3.0|As a pragmatic guy who read to improve and give to take more, this book makes me feel good by elaborating scholarly and in beautiful terms what I had been doing with high ROI for long. The catch is: Do those readers who rate it five stars really have the patience to make very long term and seemingly low winning probabilty investment and the wisdom to tell who will return favor and who will not? If not, it is just sheer common sense, though common sense is not that common.<br /><br />p.s.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Mouse is quite good for its' cost. Weights are a must, and the door to the weights looks kinda flimsy, but just glue it up if it falls out. Tracks perfectly, and has four distinct DPI settings. The software is the big surprise, it's much better than I expected and makes the mouse endlessly customizable. Cord is nice and long too. I'd put it as better than the Logitech G500, which always just broke on me.

The TV show is definitely better, but that could just be that my expectations were set pretty high thanks to the amazing adaptation.<br /><br />Still an interesting read. Pretty cool to see where the book and tv show diverge.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|Amazing
B002M9WW30|5.0|I love Rocky collection, pity is completed.<br />It's like remembering from old times (80s) to the present.<br />Movies I wish there how are you in the future.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app. Quick and easy to use. Keeps me up to date on the weather when and wherever I need it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cried through out the second half of this book. The story is so very beautiful. The emotions of each person so exact. The philosophical reference is right on the money. This book was so rich in its language and thought that I don't want to read anything else by this writer, I am afraid it will disappoint.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Keeps my daughter entertained! She loves horses. It can be glitchy at times but other than that it is a good game! Love the hd!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|While you just know what the secret will be, it's enticing to watch how it unfolds, and how it effects each life.
0307744434|4.0|I have been trying to listen and follow the thread and characters in this book off and on this summer.  About two-thirds of the way through, my daughter arrived at our summer cottage with \\"The Night Circus\\" on her iPad and that was fortunate.  I wish I had written down the characters when I started listening to this wonderful fantastical tale, but I didn't.  I just kept going back over the end of a chapter trying to pick up the story.<br /><br />PROS:  It is a well written fantasy.  I could imagine each and every tent of the circus as Ms. Morgenstern describes a scene.  That part was wonderful.  The dinners were unbelievable, I loved trying to picture them - totally implausible, but that's part of the magic of this book.<br /><br />CONS:  The story skips back and forth between two time periods and that was the most difficult to follow while listening to the story.  Once I was \\"into\\" a time period I didn't have a problem following the plot, but when the author jumped between time periods I couldn't figure out where she was going and sometimes where she had been. I really struggled with the disjointed thread from chapter to chapter.  Rest assured, it all comes together in the end (WHEW!)<br /><br />I finished reading, not listening, to the last third of the book and wished I had \\"read\\" the entire book.  I loved seeing the characters' names in print - they were wonderful.  Most books do very well as audiobooks - listening to a book is really my first choice, but in my opinion, this book was meant to be read and savored page by page.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is the most epic game on kindle fire  it is so amazing unlike all the other poo they call games on this android app store this one is the top 5 best in my opinion you should buy it!
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I have always heard of the love story of Anne Neville & Richard of York. I didn't know very much about Anne or even her father, Warwick the Kingmaker. In this seres, I feel the author has filled in the blanks as to who is who in the Cousins War. Of course I know literary license has been taken, but I have really enjoyed these books, particularly the story of Jaquetta, the matriarch of the Woodvilles. I also think that this was not a good time to be a noblewoman in England, because all they were used for was to make alliances & gain lands, all of which were given to the men they belonged to, leaving the women as used pawns in the giant chess game for power. SAD !
B004Y1WCDE|1.0|besides being confusing to use, amazon-developer do not offer the refund option, not rven for a second. wished could have tried before purchasing.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|This is a wonderfully, well conceived television show based off of a trilogy by English author, Flora Thompson.  It took a few episodes to really draw me in, but once I settled in - I fell in love with it.  I was initially drawn to it because if starred Brendon Coyle (Downton Abbey's Mr. Bates), but soon I was looking forward to the tales of Queenie and Twister, Emma and of course, Dorcas Lane.<br /><br />Sadly, the show was cancelled mid-stream in Season 4.. so just when you have truly fallen in love.. it's over.  But, well worth the watch for all four seasons.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|A must have for any fan of rock or punk. Songs utilize multiple rhythms and each song is unique. Great album
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Buy this book immediately! It is smart, sexy, silly, sentimental and laugh out loud funny! Everything about it is terrific. You won't be disappointed! Drew and Kate`s story is worth every page turn!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a really cool game.... I have been so into it. It is Amaizing and very Fun. Like it
159463176X|3.0|The first three chapters are beautifully written and quite captivating and I wanted to get to the end. But there were just too many disruptive and interjecting sub-stories that were barely connected. These broke up the continuity and made me leaf through the second half of the book to the final chapter. The episodes in Greece could have been cut, they really added little value.  The sudden jump of the returning refugees created another disconnect when there was no reference of these protagonists having had to leave their country in the first place.
B000HL09SA|4.0|good movie, young or old. sit the family down and enjoy a good, clean movie. dont forget popcorn or snack!
B000P0J024|5.0|The album is great - too bad they couldn't continue on together...Roy Orbison had a unique voice! The harmonizing was incredible.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I waited till this come on kindle fire I enjoy the game very much also wish I can purchase gems with the coins I earn in the game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is amazing, let me just start off with. I can explain it. I'm a 12 year old girl and this book will forever make a mark on my life,  It's just so romantic, funny, and heart felt. SPOILER ALERT: when Gus Dies I just started straight out bawling. I cried the rest of the book. Every time they said Gus's name I cried harder. I know I will be rereading this book., and recommend this book to everyone.
B00005JOHC|3.0|very funny but I waited to long to buy this one because its on tv everynight now. For someone that is a collector I would say yeah go ,ahead and get it. But for me it was repeat of every day shows..The bloopers were funner then some of the regular shows. I guess its only my opinion because I have seen them so mant times the shows a embeded in mind...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing story of a teenager who is terminal with cancer! She falls in love, learns to live a little and shares a few laughs in an uncoventional way......Heartbreaking, funny, witty and breathtaking!
B0021L8V0M|4.0|Good action film but I had the end figured out before half the movie was over a typical remake of a 1940s movie,but I did enjoy it.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I miss Google Reader. I hate that there's no option to filter by unread items but i do like the overall look of the app

B0094GW6YE|5.0|I love it. I purchased it to have KISS autograph it when I met them for the meet and greet.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A wonderful read-aloud book.  I once read it aloud to a 5th grade class.  They were eager for each new chapter.  After I finished the book, several of the kids read the book on their own.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I highly recommend it.<br />Autocompletion works like a charm after a bit of &#34;training&#34;.<br /><br />Using it on LG Optimuls L5 (E610)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing. This has become the greatest game ever since the world tour edition. Keep doing you creators of subway surfers.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I may have given it a five had I not just finished The Snowman. It is really a very good book.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It was okay. I prefer the original Judge Dredd. It reminded me of 1000 Ways to Die. If you enjoy explosives, a lot of blood, and short corny lines, I recommend.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's good just put the new update because it has mine carts,Sun,moon, and mob eggs! I Like the mob eggs the most because then you spawn them then get you iron sword and kill them for fun on creative
140006922X|5.0|Astounding research and a must read for anyone trying to discover the radical, revolutionary Jesus.  Easy read but a very deep look at the life and times of Christ.
B00594XOZU|3.0|Nobody really uses kik.I mean my friends never kik me now.I talk to them In real life and they tell me they don't use it much.but other than that I absolutely love it.get it. you will see.

B000SEIDR0|5.0|I'd been meaning to read this book for years, but hadn't - probably partly because I expected proselytizing.  Then I ran across one of the earlier New Yorker stories that Michael Pollan had published as part of the prelude for the book.  It was thoroughly entertaining and well written, so I downloaded the book a few days later.<br /><br />I was not disappointed.  The book is fun to read, well written, good humored and even most balanced.  It has changed my way of thinking about food and we are now well into making some significant life changes - notably with how we shop.  Lifelong hunters will probably be unhappy with the hunting chapters at the end as it comes from the viewpoint of an urban/suburbanite.  it is admittedly not the strongest part of the book.  However, the book as a whole delivered on a extraordinary scale.  I consider this must reading for all mindful citizens.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Well it's okay  I mean it's not as good as the minecraft online so in my opinion don't waste your money get the tobuscus app instead
B000TDGGRY|4.0|The Sigma Force novels are always fun to read.  They usually involve some ancient mystery, a possible explanation for it, and a race to save the world from evil.  I stay up late to finish them and the is my best compliment.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game it's really fun to play. The puzzles are challenging and make you really think. I can't remember the name of it but the last puzzle game I played it was way to easy. I finished it in only a couple hours.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have watched this show from the beginning and it is super.  I have no doubt that it will be rewatched many times.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Its free and it does exactly what it says it will do.  What more could you want in an app?
140006922X|5.0|I recommend Zealot, an excellently crafted account of the events in first century Palestine. Author Reza Aslan put over two decades of research into the project and the documentation is incredible.  I learned a lot about the history of the region and the early days of Christianity.  Every assertion put forth by Aslan rings true - a fascinating read.
B003Z2LAAO|1.0|I take it for granted it was about the Grand Canyon! WRONG!!  It was all about the Colorado River. I thick it's a little misleading! Not good at all
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. I have this game on my iTouch, too. I have tried to get my family to play this game,but they wouldn't.
B0052E6EY0|5.0|A beautiful tribute to arguably one of the most accomplished artists of all times.  The Ring is probably the most complete work of art ever accomplished by any artist in any genre.
B005ZUR724|4.0|I'm pretty sure this is an old Facebook mmo. It's a lot like wow in almost every way. But that's ok I'm enjoying it the loot looks cool. It of course has its fair share of issues like trolls.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Great move if you love horses and war stories. Very touching at the end where the horse, after being badly mistreated comes home. Not really my kind of movie but it is great for many reasons. I am an animal person...do not enjoy horses being used in wars and getting killed for nothing.
B00138KCC4|5.0|this is where rock should go - raw, and anti-establishment.  Morello is amazing.  Everyone should have this if they love rock
B002WJI66C|5.0|This is awesome. A must have for any collection. The tongue sticks out. It also hangs with the help of a suction cup. Get one today.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Overall, a good, easy read. It does seem to drag on towards the end, however, by the end, Gaiman brings the story to a nice and neat close. Would recommend.
0812973992|3.0|He is clearly a great writer, and is excellent at character development.  But then just when you're into a character, they're gone.  It's so many short vignettes pulled together, and I guess just boils down to personal preference:  I enjoy reading more in-depth stories about one or two characters, with a fully developed plot that resolves in the end.  This novel left me hanging.  I also tend to like very direct, informational sentences.  Lots of flowery prose here and sometimes it would seem like an utter stream of consciousness and I'd be left at the end of a few very large paragraphs saying...\\"huh?\\"  He interweaves the different stories in an interesting way, but it just wasn't a page turner for me.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Informative.  Easy read.  Had hoped to find suggestions on how to link the game I play on my phone to my kindle so that I could also play on it.  So far, I have not been able to do so.
B000002MY3|5.0|My wife loved the gift. She said it was just as good as she remembered it. The purchase was inexpensive, quick and we received it without any damage or problems from the seller.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I have not read much of this book but so far it looks good.  I expect to enjoy reading it on a rainy day with my cup of tea and kitty at my side.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. I get to do all the same stuff iI would want to with a real horse and even more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a really fun game! It's difficult sometimes but it is REALLY FUN! Best app ever! I'd highly recommend it!
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|What can one say about Bruce except yipee kyay. Bruce even when he's not totally the focus of a movie he still commands
159463176X|5.0|I was truly touched by the strong relationship between the brother and sister.<br />They spent their lives thinking about each other. I have four sisters and a brother.<br />One does not call. Another comes to my town and doesn't call or see me.<br />Both stories are tragic.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|Interesting from beginning to end. Kept me on the edge of my seat and the action scenes on mountain awesome
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Love the different types of clocks. I will definitely use this app a lot. Glad that I downloaded this one.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The only things this does excellently are Netflix and Google Play.<br /><br />But then does it really need to do more?
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Easy to use and comes in handy with my infant when I am in a bind and cant get her to stop crying.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|One of the great epic films of the 60s.<br /><br />It is worth owning in blu-ray. There are scenes that the best streaming resolutions do not do justice to.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great storyline.  This game has a lot of depth with great mini games throughout it.  Can't wait for the sequel!
B008KE3960|1.0|I don't like it all u do is the same thing over and over again and why don't the tanks fight back instead of just going off the screen u lose hearts and what happens if u lose all your hearts
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Sci-fi from the BBC for all to see here in the USA. Since cutting the cable cord we have had to find other sources for TV viewing and Amazon Prime seems to be great so far. Torchwwod is one of my favorites.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am late to reading this series. Well written, characters well-drawn. Story makes it,s own sense all of which makes it a good read.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I really liked this app. It makes easier for me to read and organize pdf files on Kindle. Perfect for studying. =)
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|As a paid giver and spiritual director coming from a family of dysfunctional giving, I appreciate ideas that describe how my experiences, frustrations, failures, and surprises that have developed convictions about the importance of giving. Until now I could mostly know it to be true from internalized personal judgments and friends who confirmed my observations. Adam makes visible a foundation and framework that defines the potential of being a giver and living with givers to create a world we can't imagine when takers take first place (though they don't hold it for long).  And all this without dismissing the value of matchers and takers.<br /><br />This research intuitively leads beyond description to spark practical action. The amount and integrity of research lends a confidence in giving when fear or cultural norms would make us hesitate.  Drawing the map and showing results in down to earth language and examples of common people in typical situations is a gift that makes volumes of research practical and accessible to everyone. The style and tone of writing demonstrates several themes of the book itself.  Non pretentious statements that give credit liberally to others while making assertive requests of the reader is focused on the benefit of people the author will never meet. By using illustrations from education, politics, sports, business, charity, science, history, friendship, social change and psychology, the principles are understood from multiple perspectives and seen to be universally helpful.<br /><br />Giver, taker and matcher lines have been blurred in my professional work as family therapist, hospice chaplain, nonprofit leader, pastor, social entrepreneur and volunteer.  Not seeing the motives, purposes, benefits and drawbacks of each position makes self deception easy. Wanting to be seen as a giver, or even hoping to really be a giver isn't always enough to make it so.  Grant makes it possible to practice objective self evaluation as well as receivingassessment from those who know us. I was made to re-evaluate the real motive of actions in my own life I once considered to be more purely giving or taking.<br /><br />One follow up I'd like to see is a research based description of receiving.  Although implied in parts of Give and Take, differences between receivers and takers, various attitudes and behaviors in receiving, and mutuality between givers and receivers might be a valuable next step.  Patterns of giving, taking, matching and receiving through the life cycle would be of interest, especially in terms of mentoring relationships and family loyalties. It might also be interesting to see a collection of samples in nature where giving is essential to survival and development of systems and species other than human. We will need continued encouragement and convincing to keep on giving when feeling threatened and tempted to rely on being takers, even when we know better.<br /><br />I have only one reservation about the information presented here.  My concern is that hard core givers without conscience may attempt to use knowledge here to develop new scripts and practices for personal gain.  Creating better fakers could make it harder to see wolves coming in sheep's clothing.  But the story of wolves in sheep's clothing is also a warning to wolves.  It's a dangerous place for wolves since the story is told among shepherds who are alerted to watch out for them.  I also agree with the author that consistently acting like a giver is too much work for a true taker, and if they are good enough at it, they may actually find their own inner giver.<br /><br />Even though I enjoy giving, I'm not quick to give out 5 stars because giving you an accurate and helpful picture of this book is a gift that is more important to me than giving stars to a writer.  What makes this book worth 5 stars (or more) is the possibility of what can happen when the principles here are practiced in more networks. Intentional awareness of developing a new norm of generosity in a self centered society could create enough stars for everyone to give.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was very fun! I play this all the time! Graphics are great and best of all its free which was very surprising! Definitely worth your time!!
B00CE10XQO|4.0|While this mostly wordless claymation show is great for kids aged 5 and up, parents may find some of the themes too violent or inappropriate for younger kids.  For example, one episode shows a little girl teasing and bullying the farm animals.  Perfectly fine when taken in context, but that context is hard to provide to younger kids who may not understand the &#34;bad guy&#34; archtype at play.
B00B0ND67K|5.0|I'm probably like a lot of other people - I first listened to the Blue Sky Riders because of Kenny Loggins.  I'd never heard of Georgia Middleman or Gary Burr.  But put the three together, and it's really, really good.  I'm really struck by the great songwriting and the incredible harmonies - they're open and soaring, makes you feel like you could fly!<br /><br />I think they're classified as country (and there is some), but overall I think I'd call them adult contemporary.  The songs practically ooze &#34;life experience&#34; (the three aren't kids), and so they're richer than a lot of what I hear today.  &#34;Dream&#34;, for example.  I really doubt it could have been written by a 19-year-old.  Kenny Loggins has &#34;been there&#34; and &#34;done that&#34;.  It's real.  And it's real good.  The whole album is.  (Did I say &#34;album&#34;?  Guess that makes me &#34;not a kid&#34;, too!)<br /><br />Other notables are &#34;I'm A Rider (Finally Home)&#34; and &#34;Feelin'Brave&#34; - both top down cruising songs.  And &#34;A Thousand Wild Horses&#34; is beautiful and sad - the sound is a little reminiscent of &#34;Bo Jangles&#34;.  &#34;How About Now&#34; is full-out country.  I dare you not to tap your foot or bob your head!<br /><br />Buy it.
B004FPZ2KY|5.0|Jane austen's wit,humour, and understanding of human nature, shine in this novel.  Coupled with the manners and social restraints of a bygone era I find myself returning to it on a regular basis.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game and fun time killer but the in- app purchase items are very overpriced  it's 99.99 for a small amount of special money(golden stars)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game with great graphics. Not much instruction, so you kinda have to figure this out yourself. But so far I'm enjoying it!
B000FC1MM8|5.0|This has to be Connelly's best!  His intricate lacing of characters and sub plots is absolutely amazing.  I thought i had the culprit several times throughout the book only to find I was totally off base, and that was not until the final pages of the book, even though I was trying to &#34;out-think&#34; Connelly.  As always loved the little details about police life.  Just couldn't put this one down!
B005723JSQ|3.0|I like fiction but this had a little too much: \\"Really!?  No one would really do that!\\" or \\"Really?!  No one would ever say that! \\"  I thought there were some laugh out loud parts and the characters often made me smile, but this book definitely did not produce any higher level thinking or deep thoughts.  If you know that going in, you'll probably enjoy it.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Always a great watch whether the old version or the new.  My teenage grandchildren wanted to see it and was for the most part appropriate enough to watch.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Game is challenging but not impossible. The 20 second penalty for touching the screen to move is rather annoying....all in all good game
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Good action film VG car chase pushes the envelope. Plot resolution over the top and not very believable. For that matter the plot is weak to begin with . BW & &#34;son&#34; would have to have a cloak of invisibility and other magical powers to pull some of these scenes off. That said, I rented the movie for the action trip..it did not disappoint. BW looked a bit tired but he still pulled it off. He always does..His 'son&#34; did not disappoint. either..tough, muscular, easy to look at played the part of a big risk taker very well. I expect there will be more Die Hards which I will rent for the &#34;fun&#34; of it.<br /><br />Bottom line..if you want a &#34;ride&#34; watch it. If you want something that is believable with lots of characterization -leave it for someone else. The &#34;action&#34; does get repetitive and more off the chart and because there is so much of it , it does get  a bit  tedious to watch.
B00BWWS81S|4.0|Mostly softer songs on this CD, KT's talent is worth listening to as usual.  Lovely voice anytime. I saw her in Austin performing alone with stripped down versions of songs and some new acoustic songs like Alchemy (one of my favs), this is more in line with that than some of her previous work.  I love it.
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I bought this for a friend as a gift, he just had to have one of the songs on it, Last I was informed he found a great many songs on this cd & it plays perfectly and for a great price, I recommend this product to other.<br /><br />thanks Tom

0385486804|3.0|Good book but font way too small in this edition. Next time I would pay the extra $$ so I didn't have to use an index card to guide my reading!
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|Customizing their monkey boxer has really been the highlight of this game, it doesn't even matter to them who wins or loses because they are just having fun. Thanks for a fun silly game that entertains.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|I just started this game. It was fun until my second expantion and all my money and achievements disappeared. Very disappointed.
0143124544|4.0|I have just finished the book and I loved it.  Very well written though at times has a bit of too much detail, specifically on Will's condition.  In my view the book is not so much a debate on whether or not a person should be allowed to exercise his will to end his life - the answer is a resolute yes.  Will was in control of his life to the very end, his illness notwithstanding.  This is the whole point.<br /><br />The book is about how two such different people can change each other's lives forever and bring each other peace and happiness, regardless of the final choices.  Lou and Will better each other in every way imaginable.  He made her see things and opportunities outside the tiny place she is in and she, in turn, teaches him what real love is.  He cannot think to be a burden on her and her presence solidifies his determination to end his life.<br /><br />The other characters are somewhat too straightforward - happy poor family, bad boyfriend, rich people indifferent to the rest of the world except their own.<br /><br />For all its little imperfections I strongly recommend this book.  It is thought-provoking and stays with you for a long time.

B002FVTNZU|5.0|This album, from it's high minded lyrics to its superb guitar work and melodic skill truly deserves more respect. Every song is a winner, and it is a shame this band burned out quickly. In all honesty, this record deserves to be regarded up there with Appetite for Destruction, Hysteria, 1984 and Slippery when wet as one of the great masterpiece records of the 80s.

B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The murder doesn't even take place in the south of France, so the title doesn't make sense. I rated thsi three stars rather than two because the writing is good and the story generally is interesting, but this contrasts with a lot of unrealistic elements -- as if all these people could track down all these other people and they just pop over from one side of the ocean and find who they're looking for, etc. I also didn't like the main character, Maggie. She seems like a cold fish and her character wasn't really well-developed, and her distance from her niece was really a big strike against her.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty cool game. I hate it when it's hard to find stuff then I get frustrated but I like the game over all.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Tennis in the Face is much more Fun and Entertaining than it appears or some reviews may suggest.<br />It is a well designed Physics Shooting Strategy game with elements that makes it more fun than Angy Birds.  It has lots of EXPLOSIVE devices, Ball Canisters, Barrels, etc to help you hit your targets.  The Controls are simple and work well with Realistic Physics results.  It is great to see the explosive results of your shots in SLOW MOTION (like an instant replay video effect).  It has some Nice Music and Sound Effects and their volume level can be adjusted.  Good Instructions available from the Menu.<br /><br />NOTE: The addictive Energy Drink Vendetta and Hit the Face themeo is just SILLY HUMOR that makes the game more interesting with a Story Line that is Cute and Funny.  May be unsuitable for young Kids though!<br /><br />Overall, a very ENJOYABLE game with good Strategic challenges that progressively get harder.  You can replay levels to get better scores too.  The Graphics are a Cartoonish style but are crystal clear and all movements are Smooth, Realistic and Fun to watch.  This is a WORTHY APP and excellent for those of us that love Physics Challenges and Simple shooting Fun.  Gladly, a Keeper for me!

B005D9MUWY|3.0|It's okay but not as smooth compared to Slide IT in my Samsung Player5, Android 2.3. I ran and compared both programs. Slide IT is more accurate than Swiftkey in swiping. There are few bugs on Swiftkey that needs to be ironed out, like when you add new dictionary. After I turned off my tablet Swiftkey does not remember the key strokes the next time. When you backtrack and change an upper case on the word it doesn't accept it. After several runs I'm switching back to Slide IT.

B007VYDFMS|2.0|The movie appeared to claim that Bob Marley cancer progressed because of advice from bad doctors, and this isn't really true. Bob Marley didn't want to amputate his toe, because of Rastafari beliefs of keeping the body whole, and he SOUGHT OUT doctors who would say they could cure him without amputation. I wouldn't consider him to have been misled by poor advice from doctors, because he went out looking for quacks, and this was what caused his death. Ignorance and wishful thinking was the same thing that killed Steve Jobs.<br /><br />It was nice to see a movie about a person who was a hero to so many, but it's frustrating to see them broadcast sugar-coated b/s about why the man really died.

B00BUAEYVK|2.0|I must add a few criteria here:  First off, I am quite fond of the Die Hard films--I still consider the original to be the best and a genuinely great bit of fun from beginning to end.  And while Die Hard 2 is essentially more of the same thing, the further sequels always added something new and entertaining to the table.<br /><br />And then we get to A Good Day to Die Hard, and it doesn't please me to tell you guys this, but not only is this by far the worst entry in the Die Hard series, it's also one of the worst action movies I've ever seen.  I will not dare attempt to sum of what passes here for a plot here because frankly, the movie doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  No attempt to make any sense is ever made.  Ever.  It's a film filled with explosive setpieces and heavy expository dialogue trying desperately to explain to us what is going on, and doesn't give us any straight answers.  It's pretentiously vague, and at 98 minutes, feels closer to 2 hours (thankfully, it doesn't feel much longer than that).  And it comes off rather like the people who were putting the film together were just making it up as they went.<br /><br />The script was written by Skip Woods, who also wrote the scripts for Swordfish, Hitman, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, and The A-Team, which more than explains why nothing about this film makes any sense and feels made up as it went on.  Director John Moore was also the director of Behind Enemy Lines, Flight of the Phoenix, Max Payne, and the remake of The Omen, which in turn explains why the film is humorless, witless, and pretentious to the enth degree.  Combining the talents of two such hacks, it's a miracle that Bruce Willis's John McClane is still left in tact and in respect to the character at large.  The only other actor worth mentioning is Jai Courtney as John ''Jack'' McClane Jr., who is a CIA secret agent stationed in Moscow, and is an arrogant little baffoon, who tries and fails miserably at giving out one-liners.  Everyone else is forgettable.<br /><br />One would be more than willing to throw suspension of disbelief out the window with these action set pieces if they were entertaining, but they are not.  The worst part about this film--and indeed, the worst trait of any real action film, especially a Die Hard film?  It's boring.  Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring!  One's ethusiasm for the franchise dampens somewhat after hearing from Bruce Willis himself that there is still one more movie to go before the franchise comes to a close.  With any luck, it will more than make up for the sins of this entry, so there still exists a small sliver of hope.<br /><br />There's very little of merit in this film.  But given that--while defanged and not as witty or engaging as in past installments--John McClane still remains faithful to who he was, and Bruce Willis still gives a good, but aged performance, this film is more than spared a rare 0 out of 10--John McClane here is an 8, and as such, one of the most important characteristics of this series remains in good condition.  Thus, A Good Day to Die Hard is a 2.

B003VANOFY|3.0|Second purchase:<br />So in July 2015 I decided to give this headset another shot. I still love the audio quality and the surround sound. Mic quality is pretty good as well. Here after 8 months (it is now March 2016) the plastic housing has cracked that connects the left earpiece to the headband, causing the metal joint to fall out. It is literally a piece of metal held on by plastic. Also there's an occasional buzzing noise that takes some practice to get rid of. When it starts you have to do a combination of unplugging/pluggin in and a few headset restarts, and it typically goes away. Also the batteries are most likely faulty by now (I've suspected this for months now) and DO NOT last for as long as they say. Even though LGS says &#34;Fully Charged&#34; or even &#34;10 Hours Remaining&#34; that is not even remotely close. Heck I've even had it say 2 hours remaining and either die outright or start beeping (low battery alarm).<br /><br />I was just thinking about getting a G35 to replace it, and I see now they are $100 (what?) when they used to be $40-50. Why are they now more expensive than the wireless variant? I doubt I'll pay another $100 for a faulty product or one I KNOW will break. Save your money and get a better headset.<br /><br />First purchase:<br />I absolutely loved this headset. A week after use had me sending it back to Amazon though. I had a major issue with becoming disconnected from the receiver. (Interference didn't matter, nor distance) I could be a foot away from the receiver and it would disconnect. It would always reconnect, but it is EXTREMELY annoying to have your headset disconnect 5 times in a minute while you're watching/listening to something or even talking to someone else. Once the disconnects started to become more rapid, I immediately went to amazon and started the return process. I didn't pay $100 to get disconnected constantly.<br /><br />Instead I went with Turtle Beach Earforce PX3. The audio quality is not as high and the earcups are not as comfortable as the G930, but it doesn't have the disconnection problem that the G930 has.<br /><br />I wanted to love the G930, especially since I have a G510 keyboard and have never had an issue with it, but the G930 seems to have failed me...but it doesn't have the disconnection problem that the G930 has.  I wanted to love the G930, especially since I have a G510 keyboard and have never had an issue with it, but the G930 seems to have failed me...

B000YDAYW2|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3LWVT18LHAO5Y]]These boots are about the only thing I wear 6 months of the year.  They are incredibly comfortable.  The lining is soft, and seems to wick sweat away better than regular boots.  I wear them to work (just office work) and about everywhere else.  I would consider them casual wear, as opposed to work or hiking wear.    The upper is well put together, with stitching that holds up well, and even the laces are intact after 3 years.  The only downside is that the soles do wear out faster than the uppers.  I suppose this is a side effect of the recycled material, so I'll take it as a trade off.  I am going to try and resole them this year, but if that doesn't work out, I will definitely buy another pair.  These are too good to be without.      UPDATE - 12-25-2014: Just had them re-soled after 4 years. I've read elsewhere that it isn't possible because the soles were rubbery, but I just brought them in to the local shoe repair place \\"John's Shoe Repair\\" if you happen to be in San Diego.  Great job.  The color of the new sole is darker.  We looked at everything he had in stock, and only a few had heals that matched, so I picked the closest option.  The upper still look great, and I'm looking forward to another 4 years.  I can't load another video here, but I'll post one for you on the tube ;-)

B00EL6ACOI|5.0|I am giving Blackfish five stars not because it is the best-made documentary I've seen, but because everyone should see it.  I teach college students and I often show The Cove; starting this November I will also be showing this movie.  I often hear students (and others) complain that a documentary is biased, as though that is somehow against the rules.  Of course Blackfish is biased; most docs are.  Even The March of the Penguins betrays some pro-penguin bias; we don't notice because, hey, who doesn't like penguins?  Plus, of course, there are no humans on camera interfering with them.<br /><br />This movie is rather graphic for children, but I will allow my 10yo to see it.  The whale penis was not as disturbing to me as the whale blood, but if blood is the price of entertainment then I think we should all know about it.<br /><br />The film's argument is not quite as tightly structured as I might like, but I was fascinated and emotionally involved, and I certainly came away convinced.  (Well, maybe I already belonged to the choir.)  There is a Sea World in my city, and, although I have always been uncomfortable with the confinement of animals, I didn't absolutely refuse to go there until I saw The Cove.  It's hard for me to imagine anyone seeing Blackfish and  still buying tickets.

B00EV4EUT8|4.0|Director Lee Daniels is not one for subtlety in his filmmaking approach. Reminiscent of Douglas Sirk in his prime ([[ASIN:B00005BH23 All That Heaven Allows]]), he has an old-fashioned Baroque style full of melodramatic flourishes that work surprisingly well for an emotional powerhouse like 2009's [[ASIN:B0037QM8YA Precious]]. A lot of that now-recognizable style is on display in this fictionalized 2013 historical drama, but it doesn't work quite as well when he is trying to give a history lesson of the civil rights movement through the eyes of a relatively recessive character like Cecil Gaines, a White House butler who survived seven Presidential administrations from Eisenhower to Reagan. Fortunately, Daniels cast Forest Whitaker as Gaines, and the actor responds with an intensely reflective performance that manages to capture the character's innate nobility and conflicting emotions. Gaines is based on a real-life White House butler, the late Eugene Allen, who actually started with Truman, but screenwriter Danny Strong (HBO's [[ASIN:B00AYB1VSK Game Change]]) appears more intent in juxtaposing Gaines' insulated existence with the encroaching revolution embodied by the travails of his eldest son Louis.<br /><br />The film's timeline spans some eighty years starting with an eight-year-old Cecil working the Georgia cotton fields in 1926 when one day, he suddenly sees his mother taken to a cabin where she is raped by a disreputable white farmer and in turn, his father shot point-blank in the head for looking at the farmer in a questioning manner. The farmer's grandmother (a throwaway cameo from Vanessa Redgrave) brings Cecil into the house and has him trained as a servant, an experience that allows him to escape to North Carolina and then to Washington D.C. where he lands a job as a waiter at the exclusive Excelsior Hotel. Noticed by White House staffers, Gaines is hired as a butler in 1957 during the Eisenhower Administration. He proves to be ideal in his role as he silently does what is expected from him given \\"there is no room for politics in the White House\\". Gaines becomes a passive spectator to defining moments in the political and social landscape from the late-'50s until his retirement in the mid-80's when he plays a pivotal role in the black staff finally given equal pay and opportunity for advancement.<br /><br />Meanwhile, through it all, his saucy wife Gloria stands by him fighting alcoholism and the temptations of an amorous neighbor while struggling to connect with a son estranged by his father's subservient profession. In quick succession, Louis becomes a Freedom Rider, an aide to Martin Luther King, a Black Panther, a failed congressional candidate, an anti-apartheid activist and finally a Congressman. Despite a stalwart performance by David Oyelowo, he becomes something of a convenient plot device to personalize actual historical events such as the Greensboro sit-in at Woolworth's (a devastating montage) and King's assassination in Memphis. It brings a [[ASIN:B0035JRVBO Forrest Gump]]-like tone to the story that sometimes feels trivializing. Oprah Winfrey, on the other hand, infuses Gloria with so much of her larger-than-life persona that it is often difficult to see anyone but Oprah, yet she manages to retain credibility throughout and handles the movie's dramatic high points with aplomb. Daniels takes a similarly starry-eyed approach to his casting of the White House inhabitants, and the results are often distracting.<br /><br />Robin Williams is uncharacteristically restrained and consequently wasted as Eisenhower. Looking far more like Bobby than Jack, a too- youthful James Marsden trivializes Kennedy to the level of a prep-school student. Liev Schreiber is a blustery caricature as Johnson, while a prosthetically altered John Cusack manages to etch a thumbnail portrait of paranoia as Nixon. Alan Rickman looks strangely anesthetized as Reagan, but Jane Fonda places her authoritative stamp on Nancy in just one brief scene. The same cannot be said of Mariah Carey's brief and muted appearance early on as Gaines' catatonic mother. The framing device of a meeting with Obama (gratefully seen only in archival footage) brings the plot full circle with the elephantine point being made that Gaines was able to live to see the day when a black man could become President. Nonetheless, despite an emotional catharsis that lands with the impact of a sledgehammer and the multitude of stunt casting, the movie works on a basic emotional level because Daniels and Strong are so determined to use Gaines' life as the singular plot thread that brings all the landmark moments in the civil rights movement into dramatic focus.ief scene.

B008JFUO36|4.0|This film was very well designed and made, but it was predictable.<br /><br />I won't give anything away on it, other than, it is worth watching and I've watched it a couple of times now.  It's not one of those that I can't wait to see again, but it is a great &#34;quiet&#34; kind of film.<br /><br />That's just the best way that I can describe the story line.<br /><br />Hope it helps.
0375842209|5.0|I don't read much; therefore, I don't write very many book reviews. I started reading this book because a friend spoke very highly of it and their description of it caught my interest. I am so very glad I did. I fell in love with each of the characters and found myself really caring for each of them. The relationships Liesel Meminger has with Rudy, Hans, Rosa, Max, and Ilsa Hermann are so beautiful that you almost feel like you are right there with each of them as the story is unfolding. This is by far one of the best books I have ever read. And now I think Saumensch and Saukerl are now two of my favorite words. ;-)

B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|This film, much like the one before, amounts to little more than a fluffy summer blockbuster. Good effects, fun characters on screen. If it didn't have the Star Trek label, it would have been forgotten before its theatrical run was completed. That said, it is a fun ride in places, just don't think too hard about the plot, the motivations of the characters, or how any of this fits into a coherent world, let alone how you might call it a Star Trek film.<br /><br />Others have provided more detailed critiques. As a long time Star Trek fan, I simply didn't feel there was much respect, or love, for the original source material. As an avid movie goer, I felt this film was lackluster, providing some solid effects, and a few good moment of character interaction, but with a story that made little sense, and falls apart ever faster, the deeper you dig into it.

Buddy's voice just gets better and better each year and even at 77 years young Buddy still plays like the guitar god that he has been for the last 5 decades! If you are a classic rocker you will love this album as well as just about anything else with Buddy's name on it!
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This was a replacement for another 12C Platinum. Just what we wanted. The packaging and product were both perfect and the price was a $20 less than everywhere else.
B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|I ordered season 1-3 and it was great. Lucky for me I just returned from England and went to visit Highclere Castle in Newbury where they filmed the show. It was a great experience to actually be in the rooms that you see in the story. If anyone takes a trip to London, I would highly recommend this adventure.
1451695187|5.0|I bought this to read sitting by the pool. It was highly recommended by a friend who lost her father and had concerns. She said this book really helped her. I had the same issue and think about my Dad many times each week. I'm looking forward to it.
B00005RHGL|5.0|If you are a fan of this movie, this is the edition that you must have, expect 3 or more surprise seens that were not in the original, so unexpected, and so awesome
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have never watched this show on TV, however, we started watching on Amazon instant and I find these show very funny.  I love the banter between all the characters. Very well written series
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Thanks. This is a fun app.<br />Thanks. It gets harder and harder. Pay attention to everything. It's fun. The end.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Works right out of the gate. Word prediction is excellent. I was using google keypad and swype before but swiftkey is better.
B008JFUO36|4.0|This was a very well done picture, both graphically along with an interesting storyline, which has a surprise ending. I really enjoyed every minute and found myself putting the long movie on pause just to get a drink, since I didn't want to miss a single scene.  Those of you with high large wide high end monitors will really get a treat with these amazing visuals.  How funny and strange how Earth seemed just as beautiful as before it was destroyed. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review,<br /><br />Michael
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|I was looking in the app store and no games looked interesting. then I saw this one so I remembered that I liked the other one so I bought this one too and it is a rely good game I think it should cost 2.00 because it is a great game...thanks.
B00CO4KGYA|3.0|Here we have a dude trying to hit a clown with a tennis ball in the face/body. Hmmmm..... well I've got to say the game is a bit boring there's not enough actions to this game. We really need more action to make the game fun. The graphics is a cartoon style as seen on the picture. And seriously 3 dollars for this ? I say get this app while it's free because I'm telling you it's not worth buying this for 3 bucks.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Good game not allot of levels and some levels are to easy and other levels are to hard but its worth playing if you are bored...thanks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|what an excellent and challenging game. it's fun and, at the same time, makes you think. you should continue to add levels to it. I will definitely continue with it.
B0058VW36U|4.0|this is a nice game It keeps me and my freinds busy and it has lots of exiting levels. the only problem is it has so many ads popping up when I play the game...thanks.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I enjoy playing.don't care to much for the games freezing up always happens when your getting good game cards to.but still like playing think it will take years to get some of the collections lol but it's one of my favorite bingo games
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I didn't know what it was about before I read it.  Reminds me of Mitch Alboms writings.  It gives you hope.
B007WA56OQ|5.0|I had never heard of Kylie Minogue but while dining in a restaurant heard one of her tunes and asked the wait staff to track down the artist so I could buy the music.  I sampled several CD's but liked this one the best.  I primarily like blues, rock and some jazz so this added variety to my collection.  I ripped all the tunes.
B0057UA4FY|5.0|The Clone Wars series is fantastic. If love (or even like) Star Wars and you've never had a chance to check this series out, then you should do so now. The series really helps improve the entire prequel trilogy of Star Wars. At the very least, buy it for the purpose of seeing Yoda taking out a massive army of droids with only three clone troopers to help him - all in the very first episode.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|'The Ocean At The End Of The Lane' wound its story around me within the first pages, and I remained enthralled to the very end.  A wonderful tale filled with mystery and magic.
1607053888|5.0|I bought this for my wife's birthday. She loves it. She loves the pictures, the patterns, and everything about it. Now I only have to deal with finding space in our house for the multiple bags she will be making for herself. Admittedly, she was already making her own bags anyway. So I suppose I'm just enabling her now by having purchased this book for her.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another novel that ranks among the best.  Khaled Hosseini again draws us into his story of family ties and struggles.  This may be his best yet.  Keep them coming!!
B001GQSY5K|5.0|This is great lead-in to an excellent Star Wars television series. This movie (and the subsequent series) fills in a lot of the gaps between Episode II and Episode III of the live-action films. This is a must-buy for any Star Wars fan. Some might be turned off by the fact it is animated, but the story telling is great and on-par with the the live-action films. Do yourself a favor and buy this today.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This has kept my mind and hands busy for about an hour now. The story is funny. Really it's just a search and find. If you like those this is the game for you.
0756686970|5.0|If you love LEGO and you love Star Wars, what are you waiting for? This book is a fantastic addition to any fan's library. I bought this for my son for Christmas and he loves it. Months later he still loves finding characters in this book that he sees in movies or The Clone Wars television show. This book was worth every penny.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|Best word processor I've found on the kindle app store. I've look through dozens of other apps and this one was by far the best. And its FREE!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These type of books are not my usual read....However, I could not stop reading all three of them! Now all I can think is when is Christians view going to be published because I would read all 3 of them!!!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|I actually really liked this article, is excellent and is of good quality and I recommend others to buy it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I expected a little more. The best character in the movie was the Computer Generated Graphic of The Hulk.  Puny God!!!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I actually really liked this article, is excellent and is of good quality and I recommend others to buy it.
B000ZOW96Y|2.0|It is getting a little boring on these as the plots are always the same.  I guess they won't be making anymore
B007IX00ZC|5.0|Okay...try this description. It might not fit quite right but it's the best I can come up with.<br /><br />This is like Orzic Tentacles, Rush, Porcupine Tree, Metallica, Jean Luc Ponty, David Byrne, Thomas Dolby, Steve Vai, Zappa, 70's Genesis and Yes, a Swedish Prog Band with Celtic influence and a female singer...(add in your favorite here)...all got together in an orgy of music and the results were fantastic.<br /><br />Some great musicianship combined with all sorts of influences. Rock, Jazz, Prog, Classical, Opera, Tango and Flamenco...you name it. Best find in quite a while.
0802473156|5.0|This book is great for anyone - single, married or in a relationship.  It speaks more to marrieds, but it teaches anyone so much about yourself and how to communicate with others, especially your future spouse.  Its a good book to read as a couple too if you're able.  Definitely opens your eyes to better ways to communicate and know how to make the other person (or other people in general) happy and feel loved, appreciated, cared for, etc.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Great movie would watch again just to see costumes!!  Great actors and it makes me want to research this Gatsby further!
0525425772|4.0|I was given John Grisham's first book he had written for kids as a gift. I have now read all of the Theodore Boone books. In this book it covers the areas of friendship, politics, and real life possibilities. The author shows you that being a teenager and setting out to reach a goal is done by hard work, passion and believing it could be done. The book shows you a wrong that needed to be corrected into a right. Theodore's friend Hardie and his family were in jeopardy of losing the one thing that was true to their heart..their family farm. With the state coming in trying to take the farm and running a bypass through it to \\"make life easier\\" for the county The Quinn's and Theodore did not see it that way. The story was full of suspense. You were rooting for Theo and the Quinn's a hoping for a winning outcome.<br /><br />I would recommend any of John Grisham's books about Theodore Boone, he keeps you in suspense wanting to cheer for the underdog. He sets your mind thinking you are part of the story and one of the characters. Each book makes you believe no matter how old you are you can set out to do anything you want.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Very good read !!!i I enjoyed following the family thru the years and how they found each other in the end.
0525953728|4.0|I'm 13 years old and I had been watching the reviews come out about the book and wanted to finally sit down and read what actually happened on that day Bin Laden was taken down. I have always been interested in what the Navy Seals did and do. Reading this book gave you a first hand feel of being there and reading from a seal that was part of the Seal team 6. The author told you about the events and training that led up to the removal of Bin Laden. The training for the mission was very brutal; even though it was hard it helped Seal Team 6 become more enhanced with the mission. In the book the author describes how the government and Navy Seals had been tracking Bin Laden since 911, he describes how they had people undercover watching him and his family. Pictures in the book show the operation and the layout of the house Bin Laden lived in.<br /><br />The book kept me wanting to read to find out what was happening next. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what our country did to prevent any future disasters this man could have caused. If you like action, suspense and the truth I would suggest reading this book.
0525952926|3.0|This second book was okay but it really didn't live up to the first.  Follett handled the hypocrisy in Soviet communism and the brutality of Nazi Germany with the insidious and both the blatant and subtle nuances of antisemitism well, but despite this, the book was not a page turner which I personally need in a 900+ page book.  I felt he (or his editors)  expanded the girth of the book with unnecessary blather.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I had seen the movie but I got a true understanding by reading the book. Very well written. I can wait to read the second one.
B006O6F4O6|4.0|Very good Quality an size i bought this for a gift for a kid 4 years old and rhey love it every day play with this toy and Batman
B00C25TCZ0|4.0|Excellent album and hopefully they will do more of them. A must have for Thin Lizzy fans new or okd
0684824906|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin writing style is exquisite.  This book is packed with wisdom, great insight into the mind and heart of President Lincoln, and is very inspiring. What a servant leader...a political genius!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|A must have casual game. It's very easy to get addicted to without sucking up all of your time. The dragons range from cute, cool and even weird looking,  giving it a lot of visual diversity.
0345803493|5.0|I love it I cant stop reading the books I read them all day everyday wish the story could have gone longer
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Loved this game a lot at first, been playing a lot to get tons of gems, finally i had enough gems to buy something i wanted to buy but at the time I went to buy something it said I didn't have enough gems and I accidentally pressed ok to buy more gems, and I didn't really care since I got paid $10,733  a week ago from my job, but after I bought it it took almost a week to get my gems, by the time I got them, ALL MY GEMS WERE GONE!!  All of it! I was all furious so I emailed them, but they NEVER replied. So I quit the game. I was so sad, I really loved that game,I had so much fun with it. =( Also, the prices for the gems is waaay too high, it takes to long to cook stuff, like really it takes about an hour and a half to cook grilled cheese, in real life I can cook that in ten minutes or less, and finally the items that cost gems are too expensive but the stuff that cost coins are at the perfect price,but the gem stuff, LOWER THE AMOUNT OF GEMS!!
0345803485|5.0|I love it I read it all day everyday day and night wish the story could have been longer there the best books
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I really enjoyed the story of this book. I am not normally a fiction reader and I am glad that I made the exception.
0345803507|5.0|I love it I read the books all day everyday day and night  wish the story could have been longer
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought this trilogy for my Kindle and I have read it over and over.  It provides a great escape!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Aww man when I first saw this Cut the rope I said this has a got to be a real kiddy game. oh wait first I said how can you play cut a rope??? On a tablet or PC ect....??? LOVE IT Awww man it is pure awesome I can cut a rope on a tablet. It such a simple but put your mind to it kinda game strategy booy I love the strategy you  have to use with this game. And that little green monster, you gotta feed him or he get's mad, funny little game you won't want to put it down. I love, love, love, love this game and I most highly recommend it to all ages. Mostly adults! 5 stars baby
B008LV8TSU|4.0|fun to read.  reminds me of the old fairy tales............................................and that is all folks, how long winded can you get
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is such an awesome game...... I love it. So much better than temple run. Hope they come out with a sub surfers 2.
B002RV01Q8|5.0|I loved her music and voice, the selections were beautiful. I would recommend her CD to my friends and want to get it for my IPad
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love playing this game so much my wife has to hide my charger to my kindle fire cause i stay all night and get two hours rest for /he next day if I'm not busy I play it I love it thank you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the closest I'll get to owning a horse! I like it because I can play with my family.
B00AYB1TP0|4.0|First of all,  this is a really colorful and easy to use learning app!  This is a puzzle based app, and since I think it might get a little boring for an older kid, it would most likely be be best for preschoolers. This app is huge, it has a total of 104 puzzles, enough to keep a kid busy for awhile! I think besides just learning the alphabet, this helps kids develop coordination, dexterity, and learning concentration. The animals and animations are very entertaining, just like the other apps in this series, which is important, given the attention span of young kids. The option to play with the animals, as a reward, is a very nice touch too. Overall, I think this is a fun, interactive game for preschool kids, and I don't really see any major drawbacks. I recommend this highly!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love it but put more stuff in it were it is like the PC one.<br />LOVE IT LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is so fun! love taking care of my horses and getting them ready for competitions! back to training..
1439190275|5.0|This diet works better for me than any other.  The book is well written and very helpful.  So far I've lost 13 lbs and never feel hungry.  An easy diet to follow and still be able to eat out.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|One of the greatest music DVDs of all time. I love the Foos, but I dont think that you need to to really appreciate this. It tells the story of one of the greatest rock bands of all time up to their wasting light record. Ive watched it about 50 times, and I love every second of it.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It has some pretty good graphics for a kindle . The handling on the cars in just gettin used to. It's just like grand theft auto no different besides the characters
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Wagon Wheel is my favorite song on this album. Darius has an awesome voice and his song lyrics and the band accompanying him are a fantastic mix.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was very suspenseful. I couldn't put it down. The characters came alive. I felt like I was part of this community
B004DLPXAO|2.0|Not happy at all....would download, but could not &#34;open&#34; any 'books' .  Spent 3 1/2 hrs with Amazon support [ Cory and Jayson were awesome !!!] but could find no reason as to why.  Nook downloaded with no problem, so I guess that's where I'll be buying all my books from now on.  I  REALLY  don't like the fact that I will probaby have to re-purchase the books I haven't read yet from my previous Kindle app.  In fact I'm  STILL  waiting to hear from Amazon support, they were going to contact Kindle to see if there was a problem on the Kindle app.  that we [Cory, Jayson and I ] couldn't figure out, and believe me when I say I truly believe we tried  EVERYTHING !!!  No...no...I'm not happy with this app. at all..
1416972250|5.0|Great condition! Amazing book! Quick shipping! A series of books that have me completely addicted. If you like love stories, action stories, mystery stories, stories with lots of shocking twists, vampires, warlocks, werewolves..etc.. with comedy; This book series is what youll want to read. It keeps you wondering and sucked right into it, impossible to get your eyes off these books.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|amazing book. I was hooked to it from page 1. The version was very good. I would definitely recommend this.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|so I love it-I go way back with Bowie and enjoy almost all of his work- Diamond Dogs is still my favorite album tho
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Simply put a fun app. Try it and enjoy. Hours of fun with friends and family. I have played all the Dungeon hunter s and this by far has the best graphics and story line. Great game.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I will watch anything with Johnny Depp--I did not care for this at first but it grows on you with repeated viewings-I was not fond of the original TV show so I didn't expect much-but Johnny's great as always and the rest of the cast is really good as well
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game is way more better than temple run 2 I like all the cool things they added I the game like the silliness and a bunch of other stuff
193700788X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this entire series of books-I have read them all 3 or 4 times and still enjoy them
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|Psycho (1960 film) 5/5 stars ★<br /><br />I've seen bits of this movie.  Never seen the ending or if I had I don't remember it. I think I started watching bits of it when I was about 10 y.o.  First saw The Birds at about that time too.<br />My dad let us also watch The Lost Boys at that age too.  Maybe that's why I'm not much of a horror fan.  Saw half of Pet Cemetery at the age of 14 y.o..  Horror movies doesn't seem to scare me like back then (with the exception of Devil 2010 film).<br /><br />They showed Psycho on the TMC channel today.  It was too tempting to pass off watching that.  I'm glad I did.  I thought Anthony Perkins was really good as Norman Bates.  The shower scene is such a classic.  And I've seen so many behind the scenes and discussions about this movie.  They always mention the shower scene.  I just think that Janet Leigh did such a good job acting line she was dying.  And I &lt;u>love&lt;/u> the end where you have Norman's mom talking and Norman just sitting there so sweetly and innocent like until the end with that crazy smile.  Really good stuff.<br />This might be my favorite Hitchcock film (seen some others but not straight through like this one and The Birds).  Psycho really does well as a suspense/ psychological horror (not the horror of now).  I think the mental horror rather than the modern horror stuff now.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|Since this is undoubtedly one of the most innovative and interesting television shows you will ever see, prepare yourself. If you've gotten this far--Seasons 1 and 2 under your belt (wait...if you haven't, then turn around and start from S1E1)--just know this: breaking Bad is not like other TV shows. It doesn't get boring or run out of steam or anything like that. It keeps going, and keeps you hooked. You will find yourself watching 'just one more' episode--time after time. And you may as well go ahead and get seasons 4 and 5 while you're at it, since you're going to any way.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great!!!! An absolute power romance novel that draws you in every second! Could not put the book down. So excited
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This serious is the best TV has had to offer since....I don't know.  There's really nothing to compare it to. The characters are compelling, the acting is stellar, and the script is unbelievably well-written. The directing is top-notch, and the production---man, the scenery is like another character in the show. You won't regret this!
B009AY04A8|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  It is set up so that there are several sections to each level.  Some of them are easy and some more challenging.  I find that it is very enjoyable.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a really fun game.  Lots of puzzles, challenges, and a good story line.  I highly recommend it!  Might be a little spooky for very young kids.
0439023521|4.0|What an adventure! The Hunger Games is a great young adult, futuristic, dystopian novel that makes you think hard about what you would do in a situation similar to Katniss Everdeen's. Read my full non-spoiler review at [...]
0345803485|2.0|I read all the hype on this book and as I read it now I am so bored. I have read better romance books. There is no storyline and I'm on page 200. I would have expected some kind of story by now. The sex scenes are boring. I hate books that show women as weak. I'm not going to read any further in this book.<br />I'm so disappointed. How could it be on the best seller list so long and be so boring.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read the book because of the hype. Plot was weak, characters development weak, story doesn't move along and the scenes and interaction of characters are repetitive seems to go nowhere except back to the bedroom.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that has a cholesterol problem and uses statins and for those who are very over weight.  I have lost 60 lbs. on a low carb diet for type II diabetes, but have not been able to reduce my weight any lower.  I started the Wheat Free Diet 6 months ago.  I have lost 13 lbs. since then.  My blood sugar results were much better and did not stay up for many hours after eating.  The blood sugar readings come down faster now after eating.  My blood test gave an HA1c of 6.7 from 6.9; my cholesterol dropped from 190 to 164.  My LDL dropped from 131 to 103.  My HDL was 49 and I will increase that to 60 by using coconut oil.  My C-reactive protein (CRP) sensitive was 1.3 in the low range and not above the 3.1 range as in previous blood test.  My blood pressure has dropped to 114/68 from about 140/80.  I have not used the very strict diet in book, I have been eating gluten free breads, brown rice tortillas (for making pizza in frying pan), tacos that have rice,potato starch, and  starch.  Since I am a diabetic I keep the carbs to 15 to 20 carbs at a meal.  Also, I am on metformin and berberine. In short, I am very happy about the wheat free diet and I do not feel hungry and my energy has increased.  I agree with Dr. Davis that carbohydrates not saturated fat causes high cholesterol.  I have known this for years from my blood tests and what I am eating prior to that test period.  I thank Dr. Davis for taking the time to write such a helpful and informative book!<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Michael Kelly
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|book is ok but dan brown uses the same formula as all other books and his story lines have become almost a formula that we can all predict. The formula being 1) there is a conspiracy that will destroy the world 2) he always meets up with some female that turns out to be good-looking, creating sexual tension between them  3) after all the twists and turns of the &#34;chase&#34; they end up saving the world from an Apocalypse and Langdon is the hero...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|As other reviewers have said, SwiftKey seems to &#34;read your mind&#34; when typing (or swiping). Couldn't be happier that I found it on sale for FREE from Amazon. Thanks!
140006922X|5.0|Superb, clear and insightful account of the historical Jesus.  Aslan puts this seminal figure into the political and religiouse setting such that it adds much to a wider appreciation of Jesus and his times.
B000HF6XV8|5.0|Just watched this movie.  It's perfect for picking up your spirits on a miserable day and Linda Rondstadt's beautiful \\"Winter Night\\", which plays through the end credits, is the perfect coda.<br /><br />That's all, just a very lovely movie that is worth watching once, twice, as many times as you need the pick-me-up.
B00328G4V6|5.0|This was the album that I expected and the recording I love. Something old and something new. Jimi never put out a bad album he was and is the best.
039472903X|3.0|As an avid fan of MadMen, and a person who creates ads for my own small companies, I was hoping to learn something useful here. There are lots of great bullet points, but I wonder if the material is either outdated or everyone forgot what he learned. I don't notice many advertisers using his advice, although there are some...they seem to be their own genre of ads. (The ads that you don't realize are ads because they look like articles.) Anyhow, it was very interesting to read, but I'm left questioning the advice.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think its a good game, especially to pass time with. I use it while I'm out an about waiting on ppl at work. In my free time. Good pick try it out!
B005LJKEXS|3.0|It didn't work for the intended application, extending from a networked media player, but I kept it anyway, assuming it will be useful for something else.
1401924751|5.0|I really love these cards and so very accurate as if they are really in touch with your soul.<br />One of my favorite decks.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|It was funny, I liked this move very much, but for some reason the children that I bought it for were not impressed. I bought Willy Wonka at the same time and they like that so much better. I was really surprised, because I like this so much. I can't give it five stars because I would hesitate to buy it if kids weren't too impressed.
0811876373|5.0|I first heard about cake pops through Bakerella and her blog. She is amazing and feel she is the one who started the trend.  Wonderful cake pops to make, great ideas in this book. and pictures.
B0071AKB38|5.0|this speaker has realistic lifelike sound I would swear that I was listening to a local alcoholic cover band jam away till 2 a.m.
1439152802|3.0|It took a long time to get into the story, very slow moving until almost 2/3 through.  Rather the same old story theme, a woman recounting her past.  The only interesting part was toward the ending when the mystery started to reveal itself.  The ending was good.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This was a great game, but I bought the expansion pack because I saw there was extra levels. Now I finish world 5 and the othr levels disappeared. What happened to the levels? I paid for the expansion and now nothing!!!! Please fix or send a response
B0063M22QO|4.0|Just got this game and am very pleased with it. Clear tiles and fast, fun games.  Graphics are neat and clean, easy to distinguish tiles. Best of all can turn off the music! Love that.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This was a very interesting and exciting game. It had great graphics and good puzzles. A very well done hidden object game.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper Kerman gives names, feelings, stories to some of the faces behind bars. Prison must be awful. But Ms.Keran demonstrates there is good to be found everywhere. Without being sanctimonious and preachy. Well done and a good entertaining read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very entertaining and challenging. The graphics are terrific and well done. It is fun and educational too.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Fab game very addictive, you sit for one game and before you know it you've been playing for hours, great fun.
B0028MBKVG|3.0|I felt that this book was ok. If I was not forced to read it, I probably would not have done so, but it turned out to be not that bad, though not great.
1567184855|5.0|Very interesting and insightful account of Life After Death and Subsequent Reincarnation.  The author (Michael Newton PhD) does a wonderful job of simplifying this complex subject in a manner that is easily understandable.  Of course, many will be skeptical since the account of the afterlife isn't something that can be easily processed.  Frankly I find the methods used by Dr. Newton to regress/interrogate individuals and the extensive case-by-case analysis quite plausible, and don't think it is something that could be made-up.  Previously, I had read a similar book called Many Lives Many Masters which pales in terms of the amount and depth of information presented in Journey of Souls.<br /><br />One thing I would have loved to have seen is some corroboration of information collected during a regression. For example, if one was recounting a life within the last 100 years, which would have typically included names of individuals (spouse, uncles etc), it would have been nice for the author to have attempted to research death records (or some other vehicle) to affirm that the individuals mentioned when the person was regressed did in fact exist.  I was disappointed in that it appeared no attempt was made to do this; or alternatively, such an attempt was made but either did not prove fruitful or contradicted the account given in the book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|&#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is just plain fun.  Compelling story lines, great characters, and top-notch acting.  I look forward to Season 4.  I only wish it would come to Amazon Prime when it premieres instead of having to wait until the season is over.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very fun. Uses a lot of the movie facts and ideas. Great turn based game. The addition of other islands adds a lot of extra play. Very few bugs.
0307352153|5.0|I'm an introvert in a job that requires me to be an extrovert.  Before reading this book, I thought that much of what I experienced was unique to me.  Not anymore.  I see myself in the pages.  And it's reassuring.  Well-researched with great thoughtfulness throughout.  Such a great purchase.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is fun. Not to hard but not easy. Enjoy it. Good story line. Much try it. You will love it.
B005LAII1C|5.0|this movie came in earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. I liked buying both blue-ray and dvd pack because right now we have a normal dad player, but I know we will buy a blue-ray player some time in the future.
B000BNI99K|5.0|If you like the old standards this is an awesome set. Rod does a great job...similar to what others have done in the past but more selections.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending is a great book about testing your limits and what a father will do to protect his son. Great read
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is fun and entertaining.  I like that you have to actually think to proceed to the next level. Love that it was free!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a superb cast, it seems odd Russell Crowe and Hugh Jackman could pull challenging musical numbers, but they did! I saw the 25th anniversary concert of Les Mis before I saw this movie, so my bar was really high. When I finally saw this movie I was pleased to find the actors performance rival that of the proffesional operatic stars such as Leah Salonga, Katie Hall, Alfie Bowe and Norm Lewis, among others.<br />I especially liked that they have included in this package the right to an Ultraviolet version. I have played the movie in my tablet once during a long drive.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I enjoyed putting these puzzles together. They were the perfect size to kill a few minutes of time without being boring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have a 3 yr. old nephew who's a wiz at this game.  I can't believe how coordinated and fast he is.  This one is a keeper.
0989524116|5.0|Once again I was taken on a roller coaster ride of twists and turns, and the ending left me wanting more. Where will this end for Nate Ryder and will it turn out okay? Once again Brandt Legg has nailed the story line and characters to keep you intrigued and emotional. Where's #3 Brandt cause I don't think I can wait to see how it ends.
B00APVIDFI|4.0|I may have not made myself clear in my last review. I collect watches, and this watch is perfect for my collection. I love everything about this watch except the wrist part of it. It doesn't see that it's big enough for a mans wrist. other than that, I am very pleased.
0375842209|5.0|This is an astonishing book.  Beautifully written with unique and wonderous imagery.  As an historian, I read so many books, both fiction and nonfiction, about Nazi Germany, but this one comes from such a new perspective and is written with such pathos and insight.  An excellent read.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love to play solitaire and this is easier to use on my Kindle than on my cell phone.  My grandchildren love it to.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|It would not load on my Kindle. It's hard to evaluate something that absolutely doesn't work in the first place.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Every song is great!  I am a huge fan of Imagine Dragons.  Why are you reading this?  You should be buying this album. Dooooo itttttt!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|2.0|Enjoyed season 1. Season 2 was too melodramatic for my taste but still decent. Season 3 went south real quickly.The ending was awful. Not sure if I would want to watch a season 4.
B004EPZ070|4.0|Very pleasant romance film.  Ginnifer Godwin is especially charming and Kate Hudson sells the annoying friend well.  Always enjoy John Krasinski and Colin Egglesfield puts on a nice performance and is terrific eye candy.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|The teacher recommended this book for my third grade daughter.  She loved it!  She read the entire story in 3 days and begged me to buy the next book in the series.  I thought the theme was a little mature for her, but she understood the content.  I found out this book is on the accelerated reader list, so she was able to take a test on it and scored 100%.  It is a perfect book for a young girl trying to understand how beauty is portrayed in this country.
034580404X|4.0|I must admit that I had received mixed reviews on these books before I got around to reading them. Some friends had said they were great, others described it as 'reading porn'. I think its somewhere in the middle. The whole BDSM story line in book one was a tad disturbing initially, I must say. By book two that had toned down a bit and I agree with the reader who mentioned the sex scenes being very repetitive by the second book, and often times un necessary. They had lots of sex.. we get it already! And I agree with the same reviewer who mentioned that virgin to multiple orgasmic sex goddess in one fell swoop is a serious leap of the imagination for any reader to swallow, lol. For the most part the books were enjoyable and easy to read once you got past the constant explicit sex scenes and the BDSM dynamic that plays out throughout. By book two I think you gain a greater insight into the character of Mr Grey which makes the dark side of his chararcter that is portrayed in book one a bit more palatable. He is way less of a 'demon' by the end of the third book. Overall, an entertaining read with some endearing moments dotted along the way and a hell of a lot of quite descriptive, yet repetive at times, sex scenes.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|I have the kindle fire hd 8.9. This game I found to be a whole lot more fun than it looked.  You are try to hit 3 to 10 people with 2 or 3 shots with a tennis ball.  This is not a hard game, but it is entertaining.  So far, I have had no problems.  I think it a good game for the FAOTD.
0486474917|5.0|If you read books at all does not matter whether you just started or read o a lot this is a must read for anybody.
B000002J0B|5.0|Haven't had this one since my original vinyl got lost. The music is as good as I remember it, maybe better since it's a remix. Take a better ear than mine to tell the difference though.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This book pieced together so many different aspects of Southern life post-integration. I loved that it was told from the perspective of an editor because it seemed natural that he would have a finger on the pulse of the town and an interest in every one's stories. The good whodunnit mystery and a bloody crime were an added plus. The book is a must read for Grisham fans.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I could 't put it down, finished in two days. I'm making it a goal to read all Flynn's books.

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I actually find this game entertaining; however, in the middle of playing it always freezes and tells me 'error communication error, check your server'  and when I check, my internet connection is fine...or it will say ' you took too long' when I clearly didn't. It gets really frustrating especially when I am in the middle of winning.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I don't recall ordering this product.  I hope I was not charged on my credit card for this order.  KR
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Great movie from start to finish. All the actors play their roles marvelously and the ending was epic. This movie is a must have.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I do not recall ordering this product and I do hope I was not charged for this order,  Thank-you  KR
B004YRBULS|4.0|I played the sound track from this movie for my wife and some friends and they mentioned that they had never seen the movie so I streamed it from Amazon for them to watch. It was a very easy process to set it up. My guests and wife loved the movie and I enjoyed seeing it again. They were still commenting on how great it was the following day. Thanks Amazon.
B004YAS9M8|5.0|An excellent piece of music. Highly recommended. If you are looking for beautiful comlex instrumental music, this is the one for you.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Literally could not put it down! I loved the first book of this series but the second was even better. The characters and story line just pulled me in and took me for a roller coaster ride of emotions and theories of what would happen next. Cassandra Clare has offered another world to escape into and its a very interesting one to say the least. Romance, drama, fantasy, and constant action tie this thrilling installment of the mortal instruments up in a nice little bow. I highly recommend this series to all ages! I'm going to start book three immediately!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I really enjoyed it. Great futuristic sci fi but is not too far out. Quick read. Word word word word
B00594XOZU|2.0|Half the time I can't even send a message and it crashes and to add on to that I can't change my name, people are putting 5 stars am I only having this problem?? I think if it wouldn't crash and I could change the viewing name it would be a 5 star app work on it boys.
B007V65R54|5.0|Great explanation at the beginning of Bayesian probability in terms easy to understand, followed by a series of concrete examples that are very current in the fields of politics, environment, security, and economics.  Some of the best reading is when he blows holes in all of the self-styled &#34;experts&#34; who are completely certain they are right.

B001TODCII|5.0|In my opinion I like this one more than the first one. I loved how the mom and dad get along in this movie. And I still love Liam Neeson and his over bearing dad skills.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|It's What I expected.<br />Doors CD.<br />What more do you want.<br />I bought the vinyl when it first came out.<br />This CD has more than I expected.<br />Received it on time.<br />Thank you.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am a grown man but I love these minions. This game is awesome. I've spent countless hours playing the game and then some.
B005J0VPNC|3.0|Paper Camera Include 13 filters that gives you enough to choose from. However, it lacks the quality of other similar products so the end result is a bit disappointing. Had fun anyway.
0385528787|4.0|Margaret Atwood is one of my favorite writers, and I found the previous volumes in this trilogy -- [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]] and [[ASIN:0307455475 The Year of the Flood]]-- almost impossible to put down. To say that I have been looking forward to the conclusion is an extreme understatement.<br /><br />I liked MaddAddam. And yet. . .<br /><br />The intensity of this novel seems a bit watered down when compared to the previous volumes. And Toby, the hard as nails protagonist of The Year of the Flood, is weaker here, softened by her romantic feelings for Zeb. Her main concern seems to be whether her lover is cheating on her, and this seems rather unworthy of the Toby Atwood gave us in the previous book. Particularly with the threats to the group's survival.  Toby is further softened by the maternal role she is given with the Crakers, and she takes over Jimmy's role of storyteller.<br /><br />MaddAddam certainly ties up the trilogy nicely, and it answers a lot of questions posed by the other books in the trilogy. Rather than focusing on action, as with the previous books, Atwood here focuses on mythmaking and rebuilding. After the fall is complete, how will society rebuild? Perhaps this is why, even though the stories Toby tells the Crakers are interesting, the book as a whole is not as compelling as Oryx and Crake or the Year of the Flood.<br /><br />I would argue, however, that a weaker Atwood novel is still a very worthy investment -- as long as you have read the previous books in the trilogy.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|Maysa shines on her 10th solo release. Her emotive tone has become richer as she has matured. It goes full scale from high to low and back. This Quiet Storm CD needs to be heard beyond adult contemporary radio stations. It deserves better promotion than it seems to be getting.
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I'm not a videophile, so I can't comment with any authority on the quality of the picture, or the sound, really.  But what I can say is that from an average viewer's perspective the picture is awesome, the sound is great, and this is certainly a great set to own.<br /><br />Others have mentioned how good the third season is, including the stunning cliffhanger in The Best of Both Worlds, Part I, so this is a must-have season.  Get it.  You won't regret it.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|This movie didn't seem to do well in theaters but I was holding out hope it was better than I'd read. I was right, it's a solid science fiction tale with plenty of surprises. Good acting, believable sci/tech, and not too much Tom to make it unbearable.
160774273X|5.0|I have been a serious home backer for 3 years and found it difficult to work with such wet dough.

B005DF2QMC|1.0|I really liked the item, the price, and its looks but it didn't work for me. I really wanted the item.
006114665X|5.0|As the Ny Times reviewer put it-- it is a masterpiece.  It is a startling new look at the run up to and old war.
0399159347|4.0|I really enjoyed this book from beginning to end but I have to say the very end really through me for a loop!  I totally did not expect it.  Very clever twist by the author to throw in that ending, just when you thought it might have been wrapped up too neatly.<br /><br />I love stories that have intertwining storylines, even though originally you wonder what they have to do with each other.  I really like how the author tied the 3 main characters together.  There were parts of the book that were laugh out loud funny while others were achingly sad.  My favorite character was Cecilia, I felt I could relate to her the most, although I liked Rachel a lot too.  Tess was less sympathetic to me, but I enjoyed reading her plight and was satisfied with the way her story ended even though I felt differently when the book started.  She and her situation became more tolerable to me as the story went on.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by this author but won't be the last!
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I purchased this to play and charge an iPod in a 2009 Infiniti G37 and it works perfectly. My iPod plays fine and best of all, it charges it very quickly. I am happy with this charger and glad I chose it over alternate brands. I received it a much faster than I expected, so it was an overall great purchase. I highly recommend it.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Not only is this my favorite Springsteen record, it is one of my favorite albums of all time.  I put this in my car CD player when it first came out, and it is still in there September 2013.  Each song is a winner, the next better than the one before.  If you love The Boss, you must add this to your collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it is extremely addicting I heard about it from a friend and decided to download it. If I could give it more stars I would.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|except for the pivotal ending!!  Fans of the books know what happens with/to Dumbledore at the end, and this movie skipped it entirely!!  A lousy way to treat a major character.  They should have spent less money on opening sequence CGI and redistributed it to the end!! Also, the HBP revelation is so fast, if you had not read the books, I am not certain a viewer would 'get it', certainly, you did not get enough clues to reason it out before it was revealed.  This is the worst of the HP films, IMO.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Love how this app has detailed instructions, pictures and videos. Receipe includes cookware and utensils you'll need.  I think I will use this app a lot
B009LMTDL0|5.0|really well written, entertaining and very educational.  Perfect for any girl graduate (high school or college or starting a job).  Important for any male in the work force, especially if they are in a position of any power/hiring.  i have read a lot of similar books over the years and was skeptical that i had more to learn but it really made me look at a few things in a new way.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I would recommend and did to several people this movie.  Watched it on Amazon and then again on Redbox.  Watch it.

1481130331|5.0|I was gifted this booke to review and it is one of the best books that I have read about WW2 . A very humane and personable. The family of weavers where like a family to me. I felt the pai that Greta experienced from her husbands relatives, the lose of he first child, the post partum depression when she lost the second child because the family treated her so poorly. Rather than reading about the atrocities that occurred during the war, this other wrote about a family and all of the trials and tribulations they experience. While presenting facts about the war that tied everything together. I am glas that Grets's sons met and liked each other and that they were with her at the end. Te princess was very brave to hide this family. Grets's sister was a very fragile individual and yet very brave. I would highly recommend this book.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Wow, this is one exciting show.  My son and daughter-in-law enjoy watching it with me.  The clothes, settings, characters, plot are all outstanding.  Can't wait for Season 3 to be available to purchase.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|For me as a teacher, the author's insight is precious! I like the comparison between the writer's resources and his toolbox with the vocabulary in the top drawer.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|After watching Cranford, I was delighted to find Return on Amazon.  I watched it twice, recommended it several times and will probably watch it again and again.  Next to Downton Abbey, its one of my favs.
B008YI91HS|4.0|I'm glad to own this movie online, makes it so easier, and can watch anytime or stop it anytime without using a regular DVD.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I read this on a whim based upon some really good reviews, and though its categorized at adolescent lit. it's quite an amazing and mature read.<br /><br />I read this on the heals of Christian Wiman's excellent memoir about cancer and God an so I found myself set up perfectly for it.
1587143879|5.0|Great Books.<br />I was not expecting two books.<br />The author explained a lot<br />I will highly recommend the books to study for your ccna

B0058VW36U|2.0|The game itself is cute and I'd give it 5 stars for gameplay - HOWEVER - the paid version of the app still contains ads, and they're distracting and annoying.  Yes, this was a free app of the day, but I thought the point of getting the paid version of apps was to not be stuck with ads between every other level.  If the ads were gone, it would be much better.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my four year old loves this game!! We compete with each other to see who can get the furthest. Great family time!
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I am a pretty big fan of John Cusack, and generally enjoy the movies in which he appears.  I also like romantic movies.  I thought that the basic plot (that revolves around internet dating) was pretty good.  I did not feel, however, that the writers used enough imagination in constructing the scenes and dialogue.  So many of the lines and situations seem like those I have seen and heard in other movies.<br /><br />I especially remember a scene between the female romantic lead, Diane Lane, and her father played by Christopher Plummer.  The daughter is complaining to her father about all the women he keeps stringing along, including her friend played by Stockard Channing.  The father's reply is that he has already had the great love of his life (his late wife and the mother of Diane Lane's character) and so can now do little more than just go through the motions.  I have seen this same scene and dialogue in other movies!<br /><br />While watching this movie, I felt like I often knew what the characters are going to say before they spoke their lines.  It is as if the writers had a dictionary of to movie cliches to which they constantly refered in constructing the dialogue!<br /><br />One scene that I did like, however, was the one in which Stochard Channing is showing Diane Lane all of her various internet dating profiles.  In one she presents herself as an outdoorsy cowgirl--in another as an artsy type, etc.<br /><br />I also liked the scene on Cusack and Lane's first date he realizes that he doesn't have any condoms, so they end up driving all over town late at night in search of a drug store that is still open.<br /><br />There really were things in this movie that I liked.  But there were others things that disappointed me.  I guess that my three star rating is meant to indicate that I had great hopes for this movie--but that these hopes were frustrated!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A fun, challenging puzzler. Easy levels for kids up to very hard levels for more experienced players. Fun for all ages!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|I liked this one better than the first of the trilogy.  I saw someone had said that Eva was too much in her head in this one and I agree.  A lot of over thinking and processing....it's exhausting.  She is way too naive for me to fully in joins these books.  But I still had an okay time reading it.  I'm still a bigger fan of paranormal erotica of this.  Real life can just way to monotonous.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The Orphan Master's Son deserves the acclaim it has received, including the Pulitzer.  I don't mean to suggest that it's pleasant reading.  Adam Johnson bases this story in North Korea, where life for the central characters is spent either in prison camps or trying desperately to stay out of them.  Johnson's descriptions of life in these camps, and the cruelty that awaits those who may run afoul of the civil authorities, spare us nothing. The brutality of this story is not gratuitous; Johnson has attempted to give us a responsible snapshot of life in a dystopia he knows quite well.  Further, the primary intent of the story is not so much to shock as it is to explore such diverse themes  as the nature of personal identity, enlightenment, and the role of the artist in a totalitarian state.  Jun Do, the novel's protagonist, assumes the identity of a man he dispatched.  Depending on their own stations in life, those around him are either willing, unwilling, or periodically willing to accept him as the man he has replaced. This has to be one of the most challenging  themes for any narrative to convey(think movies such as \\"The Passenger\\" and \\"The Return of Martin Guerre\\").  Johnson does not cop out of this challenge;  in fact, he magnifies it by delivering the narrative through 3 voices (think \\"Rashomon\\"): a detached narrator, a government interrogator, and the Kim regime's official propagandist line. The contrasting viewpoints treat the reader to a load of delicious irony.  Johnson carries it all off deftly, even dazzlingly.  The Orphan Master's Son isn't a walk in the park, but it's powerful reading.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Season 5 was great! They just seem to get better every year. I'm currently watching season 7 part 2 and I'll have more to say about that one later. The season 5 delivered great performances, special effects and badies!

B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I just finished reading this book to use in my 7th grade language arts class.  The story is so touching and includes a great lesson.  I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to read about bullying, peer pressure, friendship, and love.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Great movie.  Should have been a hit.  Tom at his best.  The plot was great.  Some twists in there.  Not one of those awful Hollywood movies that are all special effects and no acting or plot.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|An honest film about childhood friendships.  It reminds of me of when I was a child.  We were drawn together.  It didn't matter how much money your parents earned or what they were worth.  Children, used to be friends for all the right reasons.  It's only later in life that you become jaded in your thoughts.  It is a simple, yet complex film of friendship and values.
B004BSFSTA|2.0|The product is not as it was describe, really uncomfortable for daily use but it has a really good sound, worst thing is that clearly has a defect because a lot of people are complain for the same issue, the plastic part is broken and that make the complete product unuseable

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is brilliant, although some puzzles are too pixel-sensitive. However, the update from 2.2.0 to 3.2.0 (hey, guys, the minor numbers are on the right, not the left) failed, forcing me to do a total uninstall and reinstall. Not good.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very smart and easy to use. I can type in English and Tagalog at the same time with so much ease
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Just what I needed to take a share of responsibility in the kitchen. The fact that you get a shopping list for the ingredients is a winnet
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is such a good book. I love that there is a story of a girl with cancer but living her life normally. It is a sad story but a very good one. I am very glad I read this book. :)

B00CVPBJWU|5.0|Lana Wachowski's CLOUD ATLAS (Germany/USA/Hong Kong/Singapore-2012) is one of the most baffling and yet compelling films I've ever seen.  Not a single story, nor set in one time, the film shifts constantly and often quickly between the years 1849, 1936, 1973, 2012, 2144 and 2321 on \\"the big island.\\"<br /><br />This last is most confusng of all and most critical to understanding the purpose behind centuries of reincarnation. Some of the post-apocalyptic world's inhabitants are from the Dark Ages in dress. Their nemeses are a tribe of cannibalistic warriors. A woman described as an \\"offlander\\" Prescient arrives on a fusion-powered airship. She's searching for the Cloud Atlas satellite station and the ability that it holds to broadcast the truth to Earth colonies.<br /><br />The 2144 story is set in Neo Seoul. It's about a genetically-engineered clone, a young lady living a regimented life as a waitress at a futuristic fast food restaurant. She's rescued from this drudgery by a resistance fighter who shows this girl what the real world looks like. She's awed by the revelation and freedom from her former slavish existence, but is shocked to learn that her fellow replicants are killed and used as food for others like them.<br /><br />The 2012 story concerns a British book publisher who, through the trickery of a vengeful older brother, mistakenly commits himself to a home where he's abused by a sadistic head nurse.<br /><br />In 1973 a young investigative reporter played by Halle Berry is targeted for assassination after she learns about an unsafe nuclear reactor.<br /><br />The 1936 story is about a young man who becomes the musical transcriber for a world famous composer.

B006LSZECO|3.0|Ms. Flynn does interesting things with narration and the reader's view of the characters does undergo a change in the course of the novel.  She captures the 'midwesterness&#34; of her setting.  However my primarily problem with the book is that it is too long.  Sadly, I found myself becoming bored with the retelling of the story, even though more of the trickery is revealed in some detail.  Am not quite sure how and why this was a best seller.  Wonder who bought the most copiies:  men or women?
B008EPGIBI|5.0|nice product, on-time delivery to trade smoothly, thank you
0374275637|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone interested in how we think.  It is incredibly interesting, and &#34;thinking provoking&#34;.  Furthermore, it is (I believe) very widely read, so understanding our current understanding of how we understand (etc) is really important.  There are so many aspects of our lives that are touched by the descriptions in this book.<br /><br />Read it!

B001LF3YQK|5.0|I love all skip hop products that I've encountered. This is no exception. Sturdier plastic than a lot of other dispensers I've seen. I don't use the slide on top because I kept forgetting to close it (absent minded new mommy).... Otherwise keeps a good amt of wipes handy and they stay moist for a good period of time in this container.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I love TV and this series was one of the best. The special features are fantastic, you won't be disappointed.
B000ID37RM|5.0|Gregory Peck plays his part impeccably! :) It depict racism very realistically and brought about great conversations with our kids ages 10, 12 & 14. My son was reading the book for school & they encouraged the watching of the movie which they don't always because movies are often so different from the book. Though content is hard to digest, and parts of it are a little scarey for the younger kids, it is a real perspective of how prejudice people were and still can be.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|If you never watched the TV series Firefly you really need to watch it first, life changing. Never met anyone who didn't love it!

B008HK3XKO|4.0|Great protection for my kindle fire  and I like the fact that you can stand it up. It is also very easy to put the kindle in and take it out of the case if you need to.  My only problem was that the shipping of it took much too long.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|Alright, these bad reviews are not true. This genie asks you a few questions and you have to think of any character a real person or a animated person it will guess it know matter what. Don't believe me get this app, then you will.

B006IYG5HE|3.0|I have to agree with other reviews that said jumping back and forth so much in the beginning really confused me....and I still can't get my head around all the bits of the plot.  It seems I have many unanswered questions.  However, somehow I managed to enjoy the character of Harry.  Not knowing much about Norway probably made this book harder to read, the names were confusing, the geography was confusing, and the politics were confusing............was that a joke at the end about Neo-Nazism???????<br /><br />I'll read one more in the Harry Hole series and see if any of the confusion wanes..........chuckle.

B00005JLEU|4.0|The movie was good in general but honestly it was drawn out and a little slow not as colorful as I thought it would be some characters needed more depth and honestly a little bit of more action the film was kinda lacking something to me I just found myself getting frustrated and bored and wanting it to end usually I never give a bad review cause I always find good in some film however I give it 4 stard for creativity and ideas that could have expanded into something epic but didn't kikis delivery service was better
B00DHNB5CY|2.0|This movie took blood and gore to a new level. It was to the point it was just too much to be entertaining. The story was weak and predictable.
B005N09L5C|2.0|This film was a waste of the talents of John Hurt and Richard Burton. It tried too hard to set a &#34;mood&#34; and never established any reason to care about the characters. The 1956 Columbia Pictures film was far superior.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its awesome and a very cool game I almost feel like I actually have a real horse I also feel like its real
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I was skeptical about getting this game. However about 3.6 seconds of playing it I knew I had made the correct choice. This game will invade your mind. You will give up sleep, food and work to play this demonic soul sucking game.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|Very entertaining.  Educational for an areligious person like me.  Principasl attribution is Gospels.  A qualified scholar like Reza Adams should be able to do much better.  Historical perspective is argumentative and speculative.  Still, this is a good, easy, and enjoyable read.

B00DU74U74|2.0|The film is based off of a Stephenie Meyer novel (one of her lesser known novels, of course). I am not a fan of hers, so to properly review this movie will be difficult to do without bias towards her flaky plots and sexist characters. The filmmakers did the best with what they had--I will give them that one. The acting was okay, but the younger actors were rather amateur and bland. The plot is for the simple-minded (much like Meyer's Twilight saga), though it tries to challenge our views and attempts to deepen our psyche. It's a movie for teens, and though Meyer's novel is stuffed in the Science-Fiction section of bookstores, it's hardly on the level of other Sci-Fi stories that surround it in close proximity. It's a Young Adult fiction novel, and the film is a Young Adult fiction film. I am trying to be as eloquent as possible in my review, but in my honest opinion (as someone who used to gobble these stories up when I was a teen only a few years ago), the film sucked. And that's about the best way I can put it. It was not the worst thing I have ever watched, and it is miles above the Twilight saga, but in the end, it's a mediocre plot (thanks to Meyer's novel) with bland acting, and too simple a \\"moral\\" for it to make an impact on anyone.<br /><br />An easy film to watch, but, like I said, bland. So very bland.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I went to this movie hoping it would be at least ok.<br /><br />BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />This movie balanced all the characters and was highly entertaining!!!<br /><br />This might have been the BEST superhero movie I've even seen. And I think I've seen all of them so that's saying a lot! My wife and I are looking forward to seeing Avengers II in a year or so.<br /><br />The plot and character development was exceptional! Writing and acting was superb. CGI was very well done and was, for the most part, necessary for the story. This was the rare movie that I would have preferred to have been a little longer. The Blu-ray picture was great as was the sound. It will be most interesting to see if they can even match this production on the next outing.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended! I would rate this, at the very least, 9.5 to 9.75 out of 10 - it was very nearly a perfect movie.
B008ZCWFEE|4.0|This is a game that encourages math without my kids knowing it! I had my eldest try it and I was impressed with how it works and gives algebraic concepts without my daughter really knowing that she was being introduced to it!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I always considered Captain America to be, at best, a 2nd level superhero.<br /><br />However, after seeing this movie and the Avengers, I have to admit I've been proven wrong. This was better than Man of Steel by a whole bunch!<br /><br />The characters were richly developed. The story, other than the killing of the Red Skull, was very, very good. The reason I mentioned the Red Skull's death is I think the movie makers killing off a big bad guy in any movie slowly boxes in the writers as most super hero's only have a handful of bad guys. IF you definitely kill off their 'adversaries' so easily you've kind of locked in the fact that you're only going to make 3 or 4 movies. Then comes the inevitable reboots which I detest.<br /><br />Blu-ray picture was exceptional as was the sound. Product arrived quickly and in perfect shape. Price was very good.<br /><br />I do find it interesting that Marvel movies, on average, are better than movies based on DC characters.<br /><br />So, it's my hope the movie makers have learned their lession and leave the death of a baddie to be a not 100% sure event.<br /><br />My wife and I are looking forward to the next Captain America movie in April of 2014.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I would rate this a 9.0 to 9.5 out of 10.

B000W4KT64|5.0|I remember renting this movie from Hollywood Video a couple of months before it had gone out of business. I actually have seen this before I saw the original movie.

B008OJ291W|1.0|As a 40yr fan of Jeff Lynne [ELO] I have  loved everything they produced!  They could do no wrong! After 12yrs of anticipation of a new album since the masterpiece Zoom album,Jeff releases Long Wave. I love older songs from the 40s and 50s. On armchair theatre september song and Stormy weather were my favorites.  After listening to long wave I find it flat and below jeffs usual standards. I cant even force myself to buy it. The bass guitar and drums are adequate but .pretty bland. The other album of rehashed songs lack inspiration and are no-way near an improvement. Its a slap in the face to his old bandmates. I have a feeling it was done for copyright reasons [ which I totally understand]. Jeff has said that he has around 100 unfinished songs, so I think the last 12yrs would have been better spent on new material instead of tired oldies and trying to make a great old library of songs sound [better]. The new album of material due out [soon] is done with out a band behind him. I hope this one is good. Jeffs music deserves the best!
B00846WWVM|4.0|It's a fun game, but I did find it gets a little repetitive after playing for a while. My Kids love it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So refreshing to watch excellent television with no commercials! The writers and actors are simply amazing and the costumes/setting breathtaking!
B002BWP4A6|4.0|First, let me state the obvious:<br /><br />Authority is all...Or is it?<br /><br />By the time I went through the 2+ hours of the movie, I realized the following:<br /><br />The children - for right - or wrong - were responsible - for everything...<br /><br />The children - in my personal opinion, were the judges, juries - and, the executioners...<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Obviously...Children talk.  In that village, much was afoot.<br /><br />I'm going to watch this film again - soon! (To see what else I missed)<br /><br />I rate \\"The White Ribbon\\"...Four stars!

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am a rehabilitation physician who was a medical director of a rehabilitation institute. I have cared for many spinal cord injured. The unique medical facts attendant to a spinal cord injury were very factually accurate. What an engaging way the author told such a special relationship story!!!!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|How do you even begin to explain this series without it sounding like just another zombie fad? I love, love, love this series and the third season, for me, is when it all really kicks in. Somewhere along the line, you forget that it's another \\"end of the world\\"  story and just dig in and enjoy the interactions between the characters. Who would ever have thought that Darryl would become what he has (no spoilers from me)? I love that the characters are flawed. Even better, everyone is real looking--by that, I mean that we don't have some former pageant queen trying to play an average character. I'm not saying that any of the actors aren't attractive, but they look like folks you'd meet in the streets and not some airbrushed, implant stuffed, brain-dead bimbo (or himbo).<br /><br />C'mon Season 4!!!!

B000000OR9|2.0|I wanted to like this album, but just couldn't.  The talent is definitely there from everyone, but the songwriting is just not up to par.  It sort of feels like these guys are Whitesnake wannabees, but just couldn't pull it off.  If there was never a Whitesnake, and these guys had their material to play, they would be great.  Again, it's just a shame that their potential wasn't realized because of the songwriting.  If you like a late 80's/early 90's sound, you may like this, but I can't imagine anyone loving it.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie probably had nothing to do with traditional star trek timeline. Other then that, the movie was quite good. The plot was decent the action scenes were great
B005544TRQ|5.0|Had a week before school started, so I was looking for something.  This show is amazin, I'm now hooked. Yay!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose this rating because after watching the movie, which I loved I decided to buy the book, and I loved it too. This is a great book, much more descriptive, than the movie. It is a great story. For those who are just starting this book and or are reading it again, listen to some of the songs mentioned in this book when reading, or even listening to ColdPlay, will make reading this book a great experience. Just enjoy this book.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Just as good as season 1.  I'm hooked, I've even caught up with most of season 3.  I can't wait for the new ones to come out.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used this keyboard (+tablet edition) app with a brand new nexus 7 2013, it's ultra fast, with no lags, and simple to use. I can recomend it to everyone.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I wanted a quality mouse without paying a hefty price. I looked for a mouse that had at least 9 buttons and dpi switching on the fly. I bought this mouse November 2012 and it still works like a champ. I am about to buy a new laptop and want a solid gaming mouse to go with that as well. I am still amazed by the prices and lack of features on more well known brands that are being offered on various custom laptop build websites. Needless to say I looked to see if this mouse was still available and was pleasantly surprised to see that it still is. The fact I am a repeat customer should say enough.
1781162646|4.0|Devon Jones is a college student who takes a summer job working at Joyland, a seaside amusement park in North Carolina in 1974. Of course, he soon discovers the story of a ghastly murder and the resultant haunting of the fun house. In this carny life he meets all types of characters- the good and the evil. He also meets lifelong friends while saving a couple of lives and solving an old murder.<br /> What makes Stephen King books resonate so much with millions of readers around the world are his characters and the uncanny ability to make each reader identify with the primary characters- we see ourselves in their lives. His ability to evoke atmosphere is unsurpassed as he slowly and deliberately gets to the heart of the story. There are so many side alleys along the way that by the time we reach the climax, it seems to come on so very suddenly. The mystery in this book is really the weakest link. The villain is a character that, once his identity is revealed, completely changes his personality and proceeds to have a talkfest with the hero prior to killing him, of course. All stock devices and quite silly. Read this book for the characters and the evocative setting. As a mystery, it is not quite so successful.
1439127727|5.0|Very educational, informative, behind the scenes of what goes on, on the way to the White House and while in the White House
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is a fun adventure. The best thing about it is the characters. As you go on the adventure with them, they grow to become your good friends. The humor is wonderful. Really enjoyed it.
B00CUB5PNY|5.0|I am so glad I purchased this game!! I have had hours of playtime. It has been a very challenging and enjoyable game.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I was getting non stop low storage space warnings, and had deleted almost every app. I knew something was awry, so after a search I found Clean Master. Easy install, easy use. 3 gig of dead files and junk cleaned up. I'm very happy with the app.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My daughter and I love playing this game. When I walk through my front door there is Her father and her siting on the couch and she is teaching him how to play. Truely Amazing.
B001NHNG64|2.0|The main thing I disliked was the constant detailed descriptions of the layouts.  The actual story felt like only about 25% of the book.  Interesting villain, but his actions didn't always live up to his supposed intelligence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Can't stop playing!!!! This is as addicting as candy crush. My kids love it too. It can slow down Sometimes but that just lets<br /> me know that ive been playing too long.
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Bryan Cranston & Aaron Paul play two character that you will not be able to get our of your head!!!<br /><br />The story line is so fresh & original<br /><br />Actors are amazing
B0045HCJRQ|3.0|This movies was good but not great because it didn't end right.  It begins with deceit but ends with love unimaginable.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I've watched this movie many times and I'm sure I'll watch it many more. If you haven't seen this classic then you are missing out.
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|This game is much better than the free apps Amaxon has been pushing lately. Its entertaining, has a good cartoonish look to it, and the permissions aren't out of control.  Get it while its free!
B00ANA27IU|5.0|If you liked the movie a little then you will love the book.  It delves much deeper than just a crazy computer. Where the movie had trippy visuals at the end, the book attempts to explain some of that.
B005J0VPNC|5.0|It is very easy to use and customable. It makes the photo taking become very funny.<br />It is a must in your phone.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I just wished that I had gotten off my backside back when this CD had come out and bought it then!
B0012GTZFC|5.0|Tribal leadership is a must read book for any business owner. It is hasn't been an easy book to read because it points out many of my flaws as a leader. But it also gives a pathway to success and creating a Stage Five company. Make room Amgen, here comes Mammoth!
B00005KB9T|5.0|This CD burned up in a fire almost 4 years ago, and I just finally got around to rebuying it. I should have not waited that long, I had forgotten what a perfect reggae album this was. If you love Bob Marley, this is a must own.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Overall, the final season of \\"Lost\\" delivers an exciting combination of action and compelling drama.  In spite of a few flaws that, if addressed, would have made the journey even more satisfying for me, I still believe they did a phenomenal job making all of these puzzle pieces come together.<br /><br />I'm going to review this season in a way that shouldn't spoil any major plot revelations for those who haven't seen it all the way through yet.  I'll divide my review into four categories:  the storytelling, the characterization, the resolution of any mysteries presented from earlier seasons, and the controversial ending.<br /><br />Storyline:  unlike past seasons, most of the \\"flashes\\" we see in each character-centric episode are not traditional flashbacks or flashforwards (or jumps through space-time), but are a new motif which the producers dubbed \\"flash-sideways.\\"  At first, it's a little confusing as to why these \\"flash-sideways\\" are being utilized, and often has the viewer asking, \\"Isn't this just a big waste of time?\\"  However, by the last five minutes of the series finale, the \\"flash-sideways\\" completely make sense within the construct of the greater puzzle, and upon rewatch the \\"flash-sideways\\" will definitely make a lot more sense to the viewer.<br /><br />Characterization:  unlike many of the previous seasons, we get very strong character journeys for Jack, Kate, Sawyer, Locke, Hurley, Claire, Sawyer, Jin, Sun, Desmond, and Ben throughout the duration of Season 6.  I would have liked to have seen a lot more of Miles, Juliet, Ilana, Zoe, Lapidus, Rose, Bernard, Cindy, Zach, Emma, and Libby in Season 6, but we do get some nice guest spots from Charlotte, Danielle Faraday, Eloise Hawking, Charles Widmore, Charlie, Boone, Mikhail, Keamy, Michael, Alex, Danielle Rousseau, Ana-Lucia, Pierre Chang, Carmen Reyes, Helen, Nadia, and a variety of other minor characters from the earlier flashbacks and on-island story arcs.  On top of that, it would have been nice to have some additional familiar faces return, such as Isabel, Harper, Artzt, Mr. Eko, Karl, Bea Klugh, Naomi, Tom Friendly, and even the much-maligned Nikki/Paulo, but scheduling restraints and actor availability probably made those logistics a nightmare for the creative team to juggle.  I do think they should have included Malcolm David Kelley as Walt somewhere within the 18 episodes; however, Malcolm does return to reprise Walt in the bonus epilogue feature \\"The New Man in Charge,\\" which is considered official canon and does resolve / give closure to Walt's storyline.<br /><br />Mysteries:  we learn what/who the Smoke Monster is, learn what exactly The Whispers are, see flashbacks of the island's early origins, learn more about the Black Rock crew, discover how the Tawaret statue was destroyed, learn even more about the DHARMA Initiative, and receive quite a bit of clarification on Jacob and his \\"Candidates.\\"  Some of the lingering mysteries aren't really addressed or touched upon, such as the exact nature of Walt's \\"specialness,\\" the mysterious outrigger chase from Season 5, or even some lingering questions about The Others' society.<br /><br />The Ending:  in a word, BREATHTAKING.  It ended in one of the most beautiful, spiritual, symbolic, satisfying ways the writers could have come up with.  I was really fearing they might cop out on us and try to present it as, \\"The characters were all dead the entire time, and nothing on the island actually happened for real\\" -- but anyone who watches the finale closely will see that this is clearly NOT the case, and everything on the island really did happen to the characters (within the context of the ficitonal Lostverse, of course).<br /><br />Most fans won't be 100% satisfied with this final season, but hopefully it provides at least some rewarding element for every fan.
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|This was definitely not what I expected... the trailer made it out to be a fun scifi action thriller, but it was very drawn out and introspective, with not enough subject matter or plot to be so.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Not too heavy. Fun to see the characters come to life. Had some time on my hands and was able to follow easy. I enjoyed it very much as will anyone looking to take some mental time off and get lost in a fantastic story.
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|I love sci fi, love anything that alludes to reincarnation, love the cast, BUT! What an exhausting, pointless (at least no clear or inspiring point), and - frankly - depressing experience this movie is. Very sorry I bought it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Enjoyable game with hours of fun. This is a must have for fans get it now while you can and while it is free.
B00B69UQJY|5.0|I have been listening to DM since I was 24 and every few years or so, they faithfully release a record that covers a chapter of my life. Delta Machine is nothing short of sublime to someone who has listened all along to these \\"geeky post modern poets\\". They are consistent in delivering moody, haunting tunes that always say something about what I am going through in my life. Martin Gore is the real voice of my generation. They can still pond out \\"techno-rock\\" depth as always.<br /><br />Delta Machine is somewhat experimental and with Flood working with them again, recreates the \\"moodiness\\" without the pain that we are used to. After Violator, the tone has been less political and more personal. This is slower and less danceable, but so much of the post-Violator period has been like this. Many fans are requesting a remix of the material. I find it fine as it is. This is not music fo the masses, yet for the hardcore fans.<br /><br />They have outlasted most of their contemporaries(where is U2 and The Cure?) and still inspire others. I had the honor of seeing them live in Detroit. That is the magic of DM. They pull the audience right up onstage with them and play to you personally. Growing old with Depeche Mode is a good thing. They have this clever way to make you seem as young as ever. I can see us doing this when we are 70!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Maybe now I will go see the movie, well maybe not. When I read the book first I am usually disappointed.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|I HAD A BRAND NEW COPY OF THIS, AND MY SISTER WANTED ONE, SO I BOUGHT THIS. I HAVE SEEN THIS MOVIE ABOUT<br />4 OR 5 TIMES AND I ENJOY WATCHING IT
B003B02PF4|4.0|Good pace, Grisham must have run out of lawyer stories. Oh wait, this guy is a lawyer. Really hard to believe an evil head of US intelligence.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Navy Seals are our heroes, along with every other person in the military. But their training is NOT what it is cracked up to be. They have SEVERELY INJURED many young men who would have been Excellent SEALS.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|and works great. I have no complaints. i am able to ead all the pdfs I want now. thank you
B000LGZHDS|5.0|My girls got this for Christmas.  They liked it and thought it was cute.  It does look like Gary.  It's not very big which I like because they have way too many toys.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I play bingo at the church and it costs about 35.00 average,  this game is just as good, but private and free. Sometimes feel stressed playing at the church with like a hundred other folks. This way I can play and if I miss a bingo I don't have 5 people pointing it out.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I finished all 16 episodes in two days! I didn't want to stop it to go to bed at night! Can't wait for Season 4 to begin!!!!!!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|This movie was okay in a cheeeeeeseeeee way.If you are looking for a movie where with a lot of good actors this is it.
1607053551|4.0|While I was hoping for more detailed design instruction, this book is still very impressive. I've learned quite a bit about fabric design. I'm a certified multimedia specialist and gain a lot of knowledge from the technical detail in this book.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love this show so much. I got started watching reruns of this on TBS. I knew I just had to buy all of the seasons. This show is so funny. This was so worth the $20 I paid for it. I can't wait to buy more seasons.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|It was excellent. Always a great watch. Very well done , and lots of twists and turns. Worth the money
B001NLL93W|5.0|So far this ends one trilogy. You know most of the players without a scorecard. I know the next books will deal with Clary & Jace the Quen and Sebastian with all the other characters interspersed. You  Don't have to read the next books.  The first three books had somewhat of a conclusion.
B002KECK1G|2.0|I had too high expectations for this. The book was a  hundredfold better. Very disappointed. I expected it to be like the book.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|If you want an adventure of a lifetime that takes you back to your childhood when so much of the world was but one mysterious and thrilling adventure??  Watch this film, especially with your children! I have not seen such a remarkable film since the \\"Hardy Boys Series!\\"  The end is so very, especially, poignent!  WE ALL EVENTUALLY COME HOME!  NJMJr!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This season you have the Winchesters, demons and... angels! Also some other bitches and jerks around but it's a great season and you all should watch it!
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and. I love it. Even my kids enjoy it. One of the best !!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Being a fan since day 1, I can tell you this is the best SPN season and if you haven't watch it, you should definitely give it a chance, you'll love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. Great for both the kids and adults. Love all the minions. Can't believe the game is doesn't cost anything to play, but gives you the opportunity to buy coins if you choose.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Not my favorite season but Padalecki was great and episode like &#34;The French Mistake&#34; and &#34;Frontierland&#34; just keep you wanting more.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I cannot understand why this movie was not a runaway success at the box office. It is 100x better than the dreck called Transformers. I am a big SciFi and action movie fan. Pacific Rim easily supplanted The Dark Knight and The Avengers for me as my favorite action, hero movie. The monsters are incredible. The giant mechs are something we have never before seen on film. Great characters. Giant mechs. Amazing movie. My kids and I cannot wait for this blu-ray.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|This show is amazing and entertaining. This season adds another famous mythological creatures to the Winchesters' list of sons of bitches to get rid off.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|A great introduction to how a good man goes bad. You can really feel for the lead character who has a tough job that does not pay enough to meet his obligations. He's kind of a wimp. By the end of the first show his wispiness has disappeared. You can decide if that is a good thing or not.
1582701709|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book. Extremely interesting and I have done what the book suggests and have found that it does work- for me anyway.
B00699SDR8|4.0|Jostein Gaarder is not an ordinary author, and this may be the second strangest book I ever read. It is really two books melded together. The one is a comprehensive review of Philosophy from the earliest written account of man's search for understanding through Plato and the Greek philosophers, through Descartes, Spinoza, Locke, Hume, Kant, Kierkegaard, Marx, Darwin, Freud, up to our present time, the Big Bang, and even parallel universes. To me, as an engineer with not much time to study all of this, this was quite interesting, especially since it was being explained to a fifteen year old girl, and that is about my tolerable level of intake for such weighty material. The second, and interwoven, book is about the girl, Sophie, who is the main character in the book being read by her doppelganger, Hilde, the real 15 year old, whose father sent her the book from Lebanon, where he is stationed, as a UN soldier, soon to return. The Sophie in the book is being taught by a philosophy professor, Alberto, who is a doppelganger of Hilde's father. If this sounds confusing, it really is, especially when Sophie and Albert become very real people to both Hilde and the reader - except that they live in a parallel universe, with very difficult communication to Hilde's universe, except through the pages of the book. An underlying truth that I thought of later - the story book characters live forever in their story book universe, while their real universe creators and readers pass away.<br /><br />I give this book five stars for a very comprehensive and educational primer on Philosophy, but three stars for the strange novel that at times had my head spinning.  -  A long, but worth reading, strange book - four stars.
B008133MDK|5.0|Great<br />Superb scrips, actors, backgrounds.  Fascinating story lines.  All actorsa appear well chosen.  Wish they had more<br />Seasons in the series.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|I like this 3 disc CD/DVD set more than when I saw them on this 2011 tour, and much more than their '08 tour recording [[ASIN:B001GSV3DS Returns]]. The song selection is great as is the interplay between the band. Perhaps it's having Ponty on board that makes it so special (adding so much more than a guitar or keyboard could), but the fusion of the band as a whole, and the times when they step out individually, is a real treat - Corea is wonderful as a leader, able to sustain the music without dominating it, White is like this too, providing a solid foundation on drums without apparently a lot of ego (and did a great job as overall producer), Gambale is very fine on guitars (I was especially impressed seeing him live, nimble and versatile), and last but surely not least, Clarke is a real force of nature on his basses.<br /><br />For me the whole production flows smoothly and easily with a few highlights being the longer \\"The Shadow of Lo/Sorceress\\" and \\"The Romantic Warrior\\". Like a fine old Bordeaux, which has just gotten finer with age, this is consummate music made by consummate musicians. The bonus documentary is exactly that a real bonus - including an hour plus high quality documentary of the tour, almost 40 minutes of additional live concert footage, and a condensed movie trailer. It all makes for a highly recommended set for fans of the band and genre.
B00631VJIC|5.0|My husband and I are big SOA fans and he is also a musician so we really appreciate getting to hear the music from our favorite show.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Great replacement keyboard for Android.  The one thing I couldn't get to work (and from looking at the forums, bazillions of other people have the same problem, and the devs won't acknowledge) is looking at Facebook for &#34;learning&#34; - the Gmail one works great, the Facebook one fails each and every time.  Multiple posts (some going back years) show this is a continuing bug, that they claim is fixed with each update, yet it still doesn't work.  Fix that and you get a 5 star rating, TouchType.
