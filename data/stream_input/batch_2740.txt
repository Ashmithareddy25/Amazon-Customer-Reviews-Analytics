B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This game is the best game on my kindle.I think they should come out with something else too,but something to do with rollercoasters
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Full of very funny references to other Sci Fi shows and movies. A must watch for all Sci Fi fans.
0394818237|5.0|That's the Richard Scarry we know. Lots of pictures, lots of color and interest. So much information being brought into the illustrations. Lovely book.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series & am very sad to see it come to an end. I think Charlaine Harris has a series to be proud of!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|Not long now before she can start playing with this. She's still a young baby buty I started my Lego and Duplo collection somewhat early. My children were brought up with lots of it and it is just a fantastic product.
0812550706|1.0|This book is the darling of the gifted community, and I totally fail to see why.  I found gaping plot holes, which obviously made the overall story line LAME.  Plus, I didn't see how it described the world of extremely high-IQ kids.<br /><br />It was disturbing, both in content and tone.  Since high-IQ kids are frequently extra sensitive, I think this book would absolutely NOT be on their reading list.<br /><br />I did see shades of the author's life growing up in the LDS church, carefully tucked between the lines.  He made some important points about improving the lives of children (and young adults) and I hope they are noted.<br /><br />Read the second Ender book?  Not on your life.
0399226907|4.0|Nice book, laid out very nicely. Will be fun to read to my granddaughter when she's the right age. One
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Take three uber talented musicians, put them in a room and say &#34;Go at it boys&#34; and this is what you get. Lyrical and musical.
B004IL7DRA|5.0|Well made, waterproof, fun and very colorful for a young child!  AND it was fun helping him put his watch together!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|great debute CD.  love it.. play it all the time at work too.  great tone, all songs well written. can't go wrong buying this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like having the Bible on my kindle fire so I can have it with me wherever I go.  Glad I have it on there,
0679805273|5.0|When it comes to new beginnings, Dr. Suess says it all and says it just right.  No matter the circumstance, the send off is inspiring.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like being on facebook.  I was not going to join facebook but I am glad I did because I am in touch with some cousins that I had not seen in years.
B007V65R54|5.0|I recommend this book to anybody interested in how predictions/forecasts are made, and seeing real world examples of how they either succeed or fail. Nate Silver is a smart guy who has obviously done a great deal of research and talked to many other smart people in putting this book together. This book also has applications for those who are interested in finding out where their blind spots are. Nate does not so much give a step-by-step method for making predictions or forecasts (I am halfway through the book so maybe I just have not reached that part yet), but is more interested in highlighting the way human error often leads to poor predictions. Or alternatively, how a good prediction can be ignored due to biases, or a poor messenger.<br /><br />Even if you have no interest in prediction, those with an interest in learning some historical background of major world events should read this book. The crash of 2008, hurricane Katrina, major earthquakes - Nate Silver is a great storyteller. This could almost be considered a historical text. In each chapter he picks a topic and addresses how prediction succeeded or failed with regards to it. But each chapter starts with an excellent narrative to give the reader a basic understanding of what lead to the situation and how it is analyzed.<br /><br />My only criticism is the large number of footnotes. I have this on the Kindle app for my iPad Mini, and clicking on the footnotes is insanely difficult. I often have to press 10-20 times to get it to &#34;catch&#34; and take me to the footnote page. Otherwise half the time it just &#34;swipes&#34; to the previous page instead. This is annoying, especially because he often includes witty or insightful comments in the footnotes which I do not want to miss (although 4/5 of the footnotes are just basic citations). So maybe I would recommend the physical book version instead...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game but solved all the 10 levels.  Done too quickly and I really wish there were more levels.  Very disappointing that there were a mere 10 levels and no more for the foreseeable future.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Bought from a brick & mortar Best Buy on Friday July 26.(Item wasn't on display I asked a worker in the tv dept if the store had any, he checked with customer service and got me one.) At first, I could not get this thing to connect to my home network. It kept broadcasting the name of the Chromecast dongle as it's own network instead of connecting to mine. (Like using Connectify but without piggybacking on the network.) User error because I had-by accident-put in my router password instead of my network password *duh*. Once I corrected this the Chromecast was good to go. I ran the app on a low-end Acer laptop(windows 7),tested on a Hisense Sero Pro (Android) and an ipod touch (4th gen,IOS). Worked great with both Youtube and Netflix. On the laptop, using the Chrome browser to cast a webpage has a slight lag but a very clear picture. Trying to cast video is the same. But hey, these are still in beta right? For $35 dollars it's fine with me, and it seems to have potential as more apps become available. Plus I got the netflix deal! Now what I cannot figure out is how to change to Chromecast settings to allow it to connect to a different internet connection. In this case, a portable Virgin Mobile mifi. If anyone figures this out, post it please :)
B005544TRQ|5.0|I was alittle skeptical at first. But after watching the first episode I was hooked. They actually deal with some realities of life. Very good show, if you enjoy shows like the good wife then you will enjoy this series.
B00BSTVEDE|5.0|Excellent Soundtrack, this was one of the greatest movies made even better by this haunting and beautiful soundtrack from Vangelis
B00285K1KE|4.0|Blu ray is wonderful and this movie, kinda gets lost in the shuffle...<br />  The acting is good in some ways this hulk has a better head to body proportion than than the more popular and more recent hulk!!!
B00B23O96A|4.0|I BOUGHT CLAPTON'S CD OLD SOCK IN VENEZUELA. THE CD IS MADE IN COLOMBIA BY UNIVERSAL MUSIC COLOMBIA. ON THE BACK SIDE IT SAYS \\"INSERT THE CD INTO YOUR COMPUTER TO ACCESS AN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH EC\\", BUT NOTHING IS THERE. IS THIS INTERVIEW ON AMERICAN EDITION? THE CD COSTS THREE TIMES WHAT COSTS A NORMAL CD IN CARACAS FOR THIS REASON. I DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT I LIKED IT VERY MUCH. I HAVE ALMOST ALL CLAPTON'S CDS. I SAY ALMOST BECAUSE SOME ARE NOT EASY TO FIND. KEEP ON, ERIC.
0679745653|5.0|This is a must read!  The character of Holly Golightly is timeless.  I even wrote a song and made a music video about her : [...]<br /><br />Shes that inspiring! The book is also a breeze to read.  I read it in France over 2 short day's reads; then felt depressed because it had ended so soon.  Enjoy;-)
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I had a major argument with a fellow Trekkie about the merits of this film. He continued to argue that the movie was good until the end, in which case it was a cop out of something that had already been done before (those who have seen other Star Trek motion pictures know what I'm talking about. Being sensitive to spoilers) This was my argument:<br /><br />Yes it does mirror some previously established Star Trek plots, but the twists that accompanied the mirages are COMPLETELY important to what makes this film unique. The changes that were made to story lines from the original series completely change the way that the characters react and open them up to future discoveries that could not have been made in the original series (I'm mostly referring to Spock's emotional availability)<br /><br />Even in the tiniest details it connects to the original series, down to the Tribbles, making any Trekkie feel right at home for the majority of the movie. The film was filled with the sass, wit, and banter that the characters in this show are known for and keep the audience on their toes with the surprises built in.<br /><br />Maybe one or two other times in my life have I wanted to stand up in the theater or my living room (or wherever I was watching whatever I was watching) and root for a character so badly. The line from the trailer sums it all up. \\"Is there anything you would not do for your family?\\" This movie shows exactly how much of a family they truly are and I could not have been happier with this film.<br /><br />By the way I NEVER see a movie multiple times in theaters due to the obscene prices, but I was willing to go three times to see this film, if that tells you anything.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like Bingo Blitz I have had a few issues but they were solved in a fast and respectful manner!
B0053O89IS|5.0|it arrived on time and in the condition specified and looks brand new, i enjoy the series and i am collecting the whole series eventually
B00DUIBZSK|4.0|While this isn't the best album I've ever heard, I think it is a great album. It's songs that will all do well on the radio and in clubs. I was hoping for some more personal songs to be included, but that's not the case. They're all catchy and will immediately get stuck in your head, especially \\"Birthday\\". Between that song and \\"Come and Get It\\", it was enough to buy the full album.
B005LAII3A|5.0|it arrived in the condition specified and on time and looks brand new, what an improvement on the total recall concept; l really enjoyed the movie
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It was the &#34;Unbroken&#34; of the WWII European theater.Loved the description of the Air battles. The reality of it all.
071815780X|5.0|Everyone should try the recipes in this book. Easy to follow and healthy meals for the family. Waiting his next book.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I Love the movie. It had great action, the acting was great and overall the movie was awesome. I love action movies that are funny,and have a story to tell. I really love it and I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to laugh and have a good time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|When I need to do a quick calculation, it is right there. It is an application which performs exactly as expected.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Lots of activities, collections, and challenges. In some ways the game is more complex than I would like. The different ways they present the clues and the variety of objects are very good.
B0036S4C6G|3.0|Too many characters that I did not care for. Read like a bunch of short stories. Fragmented story line and don'<br />T know how they all connected in the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun game for those who like logic puzzles!! Can't wait for more levels to come out so I can keep playing!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It my favorite role playing game on the kindle fire , and if you buy it I know it will be your favorite game
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Great little calculator. Easy to use. Cant complain about anything. Ok...so it doesn't do percentages, but it sure as hell does everything else
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I really love this game. It's just as much fun as the original format (pc) but available on the go.<br /><br />I originally gave this a 5 star rating, but after continued issues I'm down grading to 1. I've been very dissatisfied with problems with the app freezing and losing credit, $ and power ups. I've sent messages to customers service, but the issues continue...
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It does everything it is supposed to do. Easy to use. Friendly. I love the ease of use. Thank you
B003WUYRGI|1.0|I don't love to read alot but I wonder why is my reading grade so hi then  I realised that  my teacher forses me to read I'm only  8 and im at a  high school level of reading  and my other grades are  that hi  to so reading this book made me feel great.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Man the picture looks greate, The sound is off the chain comming from 5.1 or 7.1 system<br />Again once you go blu-ray you will not go back<br />I love blu-ray movies its better on the eyes .<br />The sound is outstanding clear but please Learn how to adjust the sound volume for your area / room<br />that best fit you.

B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Time does pass playing and it moves quickly. Although I'm an adult im enjoying this game so far. Think maybe I should now watch the movie
B001KW0C96|3.0|A great many have already supplied plenty of movie summaries, thoughts of the storyline and opinions on acting and cast , so I will only focus on the quality of the transfer to Blu Ray from the Standard Definition version.  That said, everyone was greatly excited when DeNiro and Pacino, two of my favorite actors, were in the movie 'Heat' for the first time but were then terribly disappointed that both actors shared only two short scenes with each other.  In 'Righteous Kill' , they share the whole movie playing off each other.  I just wish they had done more with the script as there was so much potential for the storyline and plot twists that, in my opinion, made the film boring at times.<br /><br />VIDEO...A very good transfer with natural colors that have been slightly desaturated in post production, crushing the blacks with a resulting loss of slight detailing that does not really take away from the film itself.  Average bit rate was in the mid 20's and at no time did I notice any aliasing or artifacts.  No dirt during the transfer to blu ray or old stock threads either.  Over all, while not of DEMO material, the video transfer is really quite decent.<br /><br />AUDIO...The audio is a lossless Dolby Digital 5.1 which will always be superior to any lossy audio.  Dialogue is easy to understand and very transparent.  Audio ratio levels are properly set so once you decide on your volume level, there should be no need for you to have to go back and roller coaster your remote's volume control.  Being a dialogue driven film, your center channel speaker will be doing most of the heavy lifting but there is a nice spread across the front stage for some discreet directionality of foley audio.  Your rear speakers are used sparingly for ambience  and your LFE channel is, for the most part, on vacation.  In fact, there is one scene where a club owner/drug dealer gets shot and the audio from the gunshot actually made me jump as the audio went down pretty low in Hz and brought the sub back to LFE.<br /><br />Extras...The dreaded advertisements for other films fill up valuable space demanding greater compression of the feature film, plus BD Life (does anyone use this?) and the theatrical trailer.  There is also  the typical commentary.  One excellent extra  is a documentary on real police and the corruption that can go on as well as an exploration of the Thin Blue Line that exists in all police departments.  This extra was well worth watching.  Never the less, I hate to pay for advertisements of other films.<br /><br />Overall, while not the best film, if it is a film you like, the blu ray transfer is a good one.<br />All my reviews focus solely on the quality of the transfers to Blu Ray of both video and audio and I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding upon your purchase decisions and that I am on the correct path with this type of review.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.e sub back to LFE.<br /><br />Extras...The dreaded advertisements for other films fill up valuable space demanding greater compression of the feature film, plus BD Life (does anyone use this?) and the theatrical trailer.

B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|This is a great app for kids. It's just to bad that you cannot unlock Jake and Lisa for free. Other than that it is great.
B00CU0UE0E|4.0|Some songs sounds a touch too compressed. Not sure if it's the mp3 sound or not.  Content wise this is a great album.  Worth getting. No disappointment here.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Loved the previous version and used it every day. New version is so bad for all of the reasons others have stated plus it causes my kindle fire to freeze. Deleted the app. I never write reviews but was compelled to in this sad case.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game. You have to search the room and figure out the steps to take to get to the next level.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show! Didn't like the ending, however. Too sad. Can't wait for Season 4 to start in February 2014.
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|Most cost-effective way to see.....3d was about the best I have ( many others)...quality of sound was amazing....NEVER heard Beatles recordings sound so good.
B0009P42TG|5.0|To be honest, I planned to watch this on my computer. However considering I am a bit of a collector and had a psp I said &#34;why not&#34; and got the thing. The product looked great and though the case was pretty barebones in terms of paper, everything was quite mint. The umd came with all the standard features one would expect from a piece of media but I was pleasantly suprised to see that the movie also had the original japanese voice acting if one wanted it.<br /><br />The movie itself was pretty interesting considering that is based in England which is not a common place in anime but I must tell the reader right now to watch the movie in English first since it fits in with the setting a lot better even if the voice acting isn't best (I'm not saying it isn't as it was pretty decent to my heres but there's always those nitpickers). I don't want to spoil anything about the plot or anything but it was well worth the price of about $5 and got me thinking at times. Looking back now, I do recall the ending having less oomph than the rest of the film especially since the end credits/epilogue needed a stronger knowledge of the background of the series/comic/whatever the movie was based upon.
B002ZG97EC|4.0|it is worth the money if you've haven't watched it yet or want a collectors item to keep in your collection.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Makes you use your ability to put things together in your mind.  People who enjoy puzzles will like this one.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|A classic to buy for playing on Hifis or for getting a better remastered version of this good album.<br /> Nuff said.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I couldn't even get this one to download.....it came on my kindle as a free option and wouldn't download.  I enjoy the angry birds I have, but not happy with this particular one not downloading.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very entertaining, challenging enough to be fun but not so difficult as<br />to be frustrating. Look forward to more rooms to solve.
0375507256|3.0|I wasn't really impresses with this book. As always I like getting books with my Amazon acct. very easy and fast.
140006922X|5.0|i am guessing we will find a lot of religious people screaming after reading this book. which, by the way, is fantastic. It is backed up with SO much research, clarity and reason, it is undisputable and this is the reason why some are giving it a bad review - as the author says, christians seem to want to believe the romans had some sort of sense of humor to etch jesus' crime as the \\"king of the jews\\"... it confirms jesus to be an amazing politician and an amazing democrat at that.<br />highly recommend it.
B0080SZ0V8|1.0|Why does this game need to access my account details?  Maybe they want to know what brand of shoes i buy on amazon and what size my kids are.  I don't know what business this game has to access the internet but it does.  It would be one thing if there was remote content but there isn't any.  Looks to me like the app is another front door into your privacy.<br /><br />That said, its a fun game but it will not stay around.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|There is nothing special about the book.  Aside from the erotic part of the book, one would think that the book was written by a teenager.  From what I hear, it is preferable to read the book in a different language; as the translators were more creative and were able to make up for the author’s lack of vocabulary.  Nonetheless, in spite of the badly written book, I have yet to meet a person that didn’t get entrapped by the story. It is very addictive, and once you start reading it you only stop at the end of the 3rd book.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|I like the recording but it doesn't have that young couples best songs. I understand there was a money scramble.  Also, lets say it, Connie Britton is a lazy singer and I don't buy her as the legend she is supposed to be. Everyone else great.  The young rocker could have had more than one song. He's very good.  In fact, all the youngsters on the show are fantastic.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game for all ages. I play it as does my 10yr. old and 4 yr. old.  Also I enjoy how you can challenge fb friends!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I just love the hottest man alive! This movie was anything but what I expected and he knocks me over every time with his acting. This movie was a good one! worth a 2nd rental!
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|The title track is a fantastic song with Elton John; I play it over and over! The phoenix is another star track. It's the perfect album to sing and dance to!
B000KZFMZI|5.0|This season just reminds me of all the real life events that this series took on but in much funnier ways!
0141442468|5.0|This was a gift for my brother, unfortunately he already owned the book, but traded in his old copy in favor of this better bound copy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I AM HOOKED! Are you kidding! One click and I couldnt stop! I am a pintress addict! I have found over a million projects to do and wants and things I am going to do with my child! If you ever want to look up a &#34;wonder how to&#34; project - Pintress has it!
B00CLR127A|4.0|The music is great, but it doesn't seem like it was recorded well. There are some loud and quiet spots that seem out of place and there are times when the tracks just sound grainy and not in a good way like a record player.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Tons of fun and hrs of strategic game play its like Sims city meets call of duty and had a game this is it
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Fun game but haven't been able to control enough to defeat vector which makes the game frustrating. Otherwise graphics are great.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game provides a nice challenge.  Each leave seems to be just the right amount of difficulty to keep you interested as well as being the right length.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Great book.  I have now read 3 of Hosseini's books and love them all.  It would behoove all Americans to read it.  It helps understand the culture of Afghanistan.  At the same time it is entertaining as any good book should be.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|this novel stands up to all expections for a typical follett novel. i could not put it down till the end.  enjoyed every word!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would love to give a glowing , at length review. I can not do this book justice. A must read!
B003B02OQ4|4.0|The book definitely kept me on edge throughout and was hard to put down!  It was note predictable at all and you never really knew where the author was going to go next.  The ending was bitter sweet and not as dynamic as I had expected.
159514188X|5.0|I loved the way everything was written. The way Hannah's and Clay 's point of views were written, was absolutely perfect.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Product works exactly as I hoped.  No issues at all. I've been using it for a little over a month now and have no complaints.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Compared to Gone with the Wind this work takes you to another time and draws you into the lives of those who lived more simply, had values that have gone missing for this generation of people. This example of art proves that people do not really want the vulgarity, nudity, and horror in order to be sufficiently entertained. I can't wait for season 4 to begin.
B006ZZANG0|5.0|Titled &#34;Out of the Game&#34; .....RUFUS is definitely still in the game for pleasing his fans and any new listeners. RUFUS is STILL THE BEST SONGWRITER ON THE PLANET.<br />He never disappoints!!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|It was action packed. I loved the new twist to the childhood story. It was a perfect movie for the crowd we had over. Will recommend it my friends
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I liked it. I WISH IT TOOK LONGER TO COMPLETE.  Looking forward to more room games...hopefully a little longer to complete.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Love Tom, and the movies isn't bad either. It is fast paced and action packed. Amazon streaming is awesome! Love the time they give you to watch the movie.
B00701L5XS|1.0|Not bad, however, the constant nagging to rate it is annoying.  As such - good on you... you conned me into buying it.  Enjoy the cash ... I'll pass the word.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Very well written account of military tragedy and human resilience! US Navy SEALS, the world's finest fighting force. No one left behind!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This is the second book in the Crossfire series and I prefer it. I didn't feel a connection or understanding of the characters after the first book, their personalities and relationship was sketchy. This book reveals more and cements their places in relation to their relationship struggles. They are both messed up and it's justified but I couldn't see the connection to each other...especially him to her. This series definitely mirrors fifty shades though its not as good...it's still an interesting read.
B005IQZB14|5.0|It makes me want to take my own walk and journey on the PCT. What a well written, inspiring quest.
140006922X|5.0|As a devout Baptist, I see nothing wrong with this book and its facts. It's about time someone took the effort to accurately display the context of our Savior. Amen.
B001PJ3SBI|4.0|Probably one of the best of Knopfler's solo works ... tasty guitar work and well-crafted songs ... the title track may be the best for the set with James Taylor guesting as vocalist and acoustic player .... recommended for any Knopfler fans ...
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Just finished Naked Heat. I enjoyed this one even more than the first.  Why?  Because I know the characters better.  They each bring an important part to the story line.  They are humorous and intelligent.  I knew I had only a few pages left so I turned off my kindle and put it down.  I wasn't, ready for the story to end.  Guess I will have to purchase Heat Rises so the fun can continue!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I have not read all the reviews but I want to mention a very important fact about Cold Fact. That is that the bass is played by Bob Babbit. He was one of the greatest bass players of all time (lost him last year to brain cancer). When I saw Motown producer/ guitarist Dennis Coffey  being interviewed for the documentary and then heard the bass on I Wonder, I WONDERED if it was Babbit. If you are unaware of his work listen to any motown record in the late sixties/early seventies as he takes over for James Jamerson (my favorite bass player ever) as the main bass player on most of Motown's great tunes. Babbit's work with Stevie Wonder is a great highlight. So back to Rodriquez. Having Bob Babbit on this album is a wonderful thing! Two of musics greatest  original artists together! Wow!
B00D3LA5WG|4.0|Matthew's in it but he's not the main, very entertaining but let's face it,<br />Mud is a B movie, I bet Reese spent 1 week on the set and Matt did two weeks,
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was helpful for both me as a leader and me as a mom of daughters. It left me with much to think about and actions to take to keep moving forward.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great story line. really gave a better look into each character. Hard book to out to down once you start. Enjoyed all three Fifty Shades books.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is so awesome<br />I almost play it everyday I recommend it because<br />It is so gun to play
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|cute, funny, has a good life lesson, no bad language or sex, a movie the whole family can see together
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Really liked the free version of this. Has the weather for your area, multiple alarm times, & sleep timer that can be set from 1 minute to 12 hours if you want to listen to white noise. For 99 cents you upgrade so you can listen to your songs in your  device. Can set alarm to wake to play list. Has snooze for those who don't want to jump out of bed right away. How can you go wrong!?<br /><br />/
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love everything about this series. Can't wait for season 4 to see what happens to this family....<br />The costumes, the sets ,properties, everything is great.
B0072IVGZG|4.0|A good offering with solid variety from the latest lineup that has been together quite a while now. Some odd lyrics as always but thats what keeps us buying the next Cult to see what Ian is into lately. Music and riffs aren't too original or catchy, but a decent variety. Hate the packaging of one full CD and then a &#34;bonus &#34; with four song. Makes it hard to listen in the car. Black Sabbath has done the same with &#34;13&#34;, so must be the latest trend, not very consumer friendly.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and the third season does not disappoint. Got the DVD fast and have had no problems. I definitely recommend it!
B003097ABA|5.0|Have all the vinyl albums from back in the day, and I got a greatest hits CD, but it was great to hear the full albums again. The first two are classics and really need to be listened to in their entirety to appreciate. The next two are only okay, but Heartbeat City is a triumph. For the money a really easy choice for a fan, or someone wanting to get to know one of the pioneer alternative rock bands. For the price of one premium CD you can't go wrong here.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This was a great purchase. I love the movies and didn't want to spend a lot of money for extras that I didn't care about. This is perfect if you just want the movies. They all come in one box so I can take them to friends houses and not have to tote 8 boxes around. I definitely recommend this.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Best gift ever for my wife , she really loves to read  the books  from the series Games of Thrones
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Being Dyslexic, I don't read a lot. I finished all 3 books in less then a month which is better then I did in Grad School.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Best gift ever for my wife , she really loves to read  the books on the Kindle. Even though she had it on the Kindle she still loves it
B003AXAS60|5.0|Nothing extra special about Cookie... great looking like most of the boo`s yet plain but that's ok with us!  Came with Pepper the cat so they are always sitting together on one of my daughter's shelves. I know this is a great collection... not necessarily financially profitable at all but a collection my daughter and I can talk about.. We welcomed Cookie in the house with a tea-party! Then, of course, I went back to my house work while she took the time to play.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Love  the animals. Love the cross breeds you can make with them. Don't like how you eventually have to spend money though. But everything else is great.
B005544TRQ|5.0|You can't watch just one , and just when you think it can't get any more exciting and dangerous ....it does.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Each run seems to be different, lots of variety, keeps game play from getting boring. Plus you can't go wrong with the minions.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Telling the story of a kidnap victim and her child, in the child's words, was thought-provoking. The mother's natural instinct to rear and protect her child was evident in the story. The author achieved the effect of allowing you to see the world through a thwarted vision forced upon him by his limited life experience. The reader also will have the satisfaction in seeing the child develop as he learns about the world, to a lesser degree the reader will also witness the mother's healing.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app surprised me.  I it downloaded fast and is about as User friendly as you can get.<br /><br />Youtube has several full length movies and other entertaining tidbits.  This allows you to download them yo watch later, without internet access...  i.e. a roadtrip.  So far I have saved 5 full length movies and all of my videos from my channel (docv73) plus a few random clips, and playback has been perfect.<br /><br />The only minor issue is easy to deal with.  If you are downloading large files, you will occasionally get a &#34;timed out&#34; error and the download will stop.  Open your folder where the movies/clips are and it will be there with a &#34;continue download&#34; option.  One file I had to to that twice, and one other I had yo do it once, both were full length movies.  Other full length movie files have worked with no issue.  This is the only issue so far, and is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.
B00COHIFQS|5.0|We love good scary movies and this was totally what we were expecting from it... to the point of screaming at crucial points !!!
B002RI9MWA|3.0|Nicely written and keeps you engaged but let down by the ending in my opinion. I enjoyed it but it won't be a book that lives long in the memory
B0098460O4|5.0|They are so young, just 17 years old and having seen their audition, I just had to see all their remaining Youtube performances. They are such loveable people and seem very wholesome and humble.  I have various favorites on the CD, and I enjoy their solos and duets.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I just received this product and so far I am very pleased.  Out of the box the slim 3 had about 75% charge.  I went ahead and charged it up the rest of the way which took about an hour.  The slim 3 is a little smaller than my Galaxy s3 in terms of length and width, and the thickness seems to be about the same.  I have several android phones and I have two that i carry with me at all times.  The Slim 3 is nice because you can charge two phones at the same time without losing charging amps.  both ports deliver a charge rated at 1000mah.  I have a car charger with two ports, but I lose some charging amps when charging both of my phones so I am glad that the Slim 3 does not lose amps.<br />  The amount of time to charge my phones with the Slim 3 seems to be about the same as with my wall charger that came with the phone.  The first charge on my Galaxy s3 took nearly two hours with the phone powered off.  The Slim 3 has enough power to charge my S3 nearly three times and my Galaxy Nexus three and one half times.<br />  I really like having the built in USB cable.  It makes it really easy to charge the phone and talk at the same time.  I think that the weight of the Slim 3 is appropriate at 3.7 Oz.  I was afraid it would weigh too much at 6000 Mah to easily carry in my pocket, but I was incorrect.  It feels like it weighs a little less than my phone; Therefore, I dont feel like I am carrying around a brick in my pocket.<br />  If I had any disappointment, it would be that the Slim 3 does not have a port that will deliver charge at 2 Amps.  I have an Ipad and it does not charge very quick with this charger.  At the same time, i realize that there arent any other slim, portable, external batteries that have the 2 amp port either.  In order to get the 2 amp port it seems like you have to go with the much heavier and less protable, 10000 Mah or higher external chargers.  The Slim 3 is great for its intended purpose, which is portability and the ability to continue using yourphone while charging with the Slim 3.  Thanks, Chris.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I'm hooked! Better than going to the carnival. My daughter had it so I figured I'd give it a try......fun, fun, fun!!!!!
1401937519|5.0|Working with people who are in fear of dying or have a loved one die will benefit hugely from this book.<br />Anita has written honestly and with an amazing insight into her experiences.<br />It challenges everyone who reads this to think about their own death. I bought two copies and they are both 'doing the rounds'.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Works on the Fire with no problems, easy interface, easy to search for feeds and add them. Hasn't crashed or had any problems.highly recommended.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|An entertaining read. A little repetitive in the writing but I'm sure that's because it's for a young audience. But it keeps your attention.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I bought this movie for my Grandson.  He loved it!  We enjoyed watching it and I know we will watch it often.  He is 5.
B008B1BL4E|4.0|The idea of a history of the factors leading to World War I immediately appealed to me. I've read numerous books about World War II and the interwar years, and I've even read a bit about WWI itself, but when I saw this book, I realized that I knew really next to nothing about the historical factors leading up to the war, outside of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife.<br />While reading this book, I found myself stopping occasionally to take time to read more about the various European conflicts that preceded and helped inform the political climate that made the war all the more possible. Conflicts such as the Franco-Prussian War and the Austro-Hungarian war were events with which I was vaguely familiar, but knew little of any real substance about, so taking a few moments to pick up on them through Wikipedia articles and such helped my understanding of the events of Clark's narrative. I also found myself taking short detours into histories of the Habsburg and Ottoman empires to help me understand the mindset of a continent that had pretty much been in conflict in some form or another for most of it's existence, and yet? I still only scratched the surface.<br />Professor Clark's detail is exhaustive and not for the faint of heart. If you're looking for light beach reading, this probably isn't going to be your go-to book for that, but if you're like me and  enjoy all things historical, this book will be a worthy addition to your library!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is the kind of movie that can be watched many times.  I enjoyed the subject, location and of course the actors.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Enjoyed the movie much.  Much better than paying $7 to $10+ dollars going to the movies.  Will watch this again!
B004SIP6BI|5.0|I was recommended this movie from my friend. I went and rented it.  I liked it so much I bought it for my movie library and watched it again.
B004TMF5EQ|5.0|The opportunity to get a sense of the Universe beyond our current thinking. Fantastic - may be the greatest scientific info of the 20th century and is presented in an incredible manner.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it and play all the time! so addicting and can't put it down!! Have a lot of friends who play it now as well!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|The game is fun, except each time you die, it takes you back to the very beginning and start LOADING, again!
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Well what can I say it's a great game with wonderful graphics very well thought out great action good for anyone from beginning gamer to experienced gamer
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I like variety in a mobile app and this has it without getting complicated, user friendly control scheme and familiar games you don't mind playing again
B007ZXK08C|5.0|A look at the nature of marital relationships and the mind of a psychopath; how this impacts on their lives and all those around them.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Sometimes funny, sometimes jarring, sometimes poignant, but consistently good. Strong leads from Cooper, Lawrence and DeNiro, and credible acting all around.
B003QSJDZQ|1.0|Could not view the movie due to HDCP not authorised message. Give me my money back. Got sound but no picture.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is so fun and easy that my 5 year old  sister can play even the vector battle is easy in hard way
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|The first part of this movie is a horror movie about psychoactive drugs and their horrible side effects.  There's also notes of BIG Pharma corrupting medicine for money.  The back half of the movie becomes a crime drama with some revenge notes.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is an awesome tool that helps me to more effectively use my Kindle Fire HD as a tablet and make better use of my time.  Thank you for making this available to me and others!<br /><br />Very easy install!!!
B005T87QCI|4.0|it is very good for 0.99 the graphics are good  and the control's good and survival mod is very good and tournament mod is hard
B005HI4LLY|5.0|The cast of characters and the plot of this movie have been covered many times already.  What I want to share with you is that this movie is fun to watch and you will laugh a lot.  The one HIllbilly you think is the dumbest of the dumb at the start of the movie is anything but that.  This is a nice roll reversal with the characters.  The college kids are not the good guys and the HIllbillies are just flat out good hearted and honest.  My wife wasn't sure about watching this movie at first but she quickly got into it and enjoyed it.  This is a movie you can watch over and over again and find yourself laughing ahead of the funny scenes since you know what is to come.  Well worth buying.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. Great action, suspense, acting, visuals, etc. The movie flew by and even though it's over two hours, I wanted a bit more. I think such an epic story could have covered more ground and my appetite for zombie doom would have been satisfied with a three hour movie! Hence my four star rating. Definitely worth buying though.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|stick with the free version where you don't have to login to amazon every freaking time you want to use the app
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|everyone loves Arnold right? You must order this one. it is a keeper. have family or friends over and pop some popcorn!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This device is perfect for what it is. There are lots of reviews here to describe in detail what it can do and cannot, but for me it does way more than I expected for $35
B00DW39B2K|5.0|this movie will keep you on your toes. No pausing its just too good. pop some popcorn and get ready for some excitement.
1451695195|2.0|I was expecting a lot when I ordered this book. It what just o.k. He goes into major detail regarding his near death experience when he was in a coma. Some parts were pretty repetitive. A little hokey. It was only about 170 pages and I was happy it wasn't longer. Save your money.
B00CX1TSSO|5.0|great movie for kids and adults. Glad we bought this one. Pop some popcorn and have a movie night of fun and adventure.
0307960471|5.0|Jo Nesbo knocks it out of the park once again. I say it's a must read if you like Jo Nesbo
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It is the best made, funniest most enjoyable movie that I have seen in years.  I would recommend to anyone who wants to laugh and enjoy a great movie.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Fun game different using a slingshot nice twist addicting. Would recommend. I like aiming games and this one is not timed which I like.
B00BI5IXL4|4.0|Les Miserables is an excellent film adaptation of the musical Les Miserables. While Russell Crowe's singing is not quite up to par, the superb, raw performance of Anne Hathaway in &#34;I Dreamed a Dream,&#34; the filming and sets, and the beautiful redemption story told in this musical make this movie well worth the time and money.
140006922X|5.0|This book was professionally written by a well learned man about a subject in which he manifested his years of research and erudition.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game for free.  I love this movie and who doesn't love the minions?<br />My kids can't get enough of this game and I am right there with them.
B0054YH8VQ|5.0|To me and millions of others this was Billy Joel's best album. To the younger generation who know little about him I will say this. Are you trying to live on after a disasterous love affair gone bad? Billy seems to tap into the pain we experience and express it in his lyrics. When it was released I was hurting. And it hit the spot. When the pain returns late in life you go back to Billy Joel.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Got it for my grand daughter to play and she really likes it.  She is 8 and loves all things animal.
B002LVVCQM|5.0|As this, and other books point out, anyone who believes in a God who kills little babies with cancer or kills parents so that their innocent children experience life-long trauma is an idiot.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I would recommend this program to everyone.  It could do with a bit less of bad guy, good guy but all in all it was good
B003B02O0U|5.0|Don't judge a John Grisham book by it's movie, especially The Pelican Brief. Great characters, a plot with more twists than a bowl of spaghetti, and Grisham's uncanny ability to weave a story so descriptive that it could be nonfiction.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and challenging. My kids love it and so do I! I'm always looking forward to updates and another version of game.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Thank you for this great movie.  The kids loved it.  Plus Johnny Depp is a great actor.  Thank you for getting it to us so soon.  I know that I am late writting this, but wanted to get it in.
B001IKKMCW|5.0|Jim Carrey is an excellent actor and this movie is very funny and enjoyable to watch. There is never a dull moment in this one. We are pleased with the purchase.

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What a awesome movie. Action packed, good acting & humor. Super pleased with this purchase and is a movie that will be watched over and over.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Calling all Magic the Gathering players. If you have cards but you don't  have anyone to play with this is the game for you. It is exactly like the real card game!! The only bad part is that unless you pay $9.99 you only have one color deck (green) to play twith, and only 5 computer people to play with. But other than that BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|This is a great show/series. It was an excellent purchase and will watch it over and over. Never a dull moment!
0385471378|5.0|This was perfect for my AP Spanish assignment. Exactly what I needed. I really enjoyed the book too. It was easy to find the Spanish version too.
B001FB55M6|5.0|Jim Carrey is an excellent actor and this movie is very funny and enjoyable to watch. We are pleased with the purchase.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Was recommended by my daughter never read anything like this before but got really hooked.  Couldn't wait to read the next one Catching Fire
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Love this Jim Carrey movie. Very funny and entertaining. Nicely done movie from the original book. Pleased with this purchase.
B00BFV1K0M|5.0|Well after finishing The Hunger Games could not wait to read Catching Fire got more and more into it and just could not put it down. Started Mockingjjay and again cant put it down so I should really thank my daughter for putting me onto the Hunger Games Trilogy as I would never had thought to read this type of book before.
B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1YMOUUK0PRFD4]]This is a good looking and highly functional calculator.  It can function as a standalone calculator that you can have on your office or home desk, in your kitchen or to carry with you to a meeting.  It is nicely made and professional looking.  It is also a Bluetooth wireless keypad for use with your Mac or Windows based computer.  The pairing of the calculator is fast and easy and for those who enter a lot of numbers into a computer this is a nice addition.  The large and comfortable keypad is easy to use and comfortable. The unit comes with an instruction manual and two AAA batteries that power the calculator. I paired it with my iPad and I actually entered numbers into my notepad application.<br /><br />When in the mode where it is connected to your PC, using the keyboard mode, it can enter numbers into any program you are using and you can also press the send button and input the result of your calculations into a document for example.  Pressing the Mode button switches the calculator from the Calculator mode to the Keypad mode.  You can set a floating decimal point or also select no decimal, 2 or 4 decimal points. On the bottom of the calculator is an on/off switch, a MAC or PC switch, a pairing button and a reset button.  I like the fact that it has an on/off switch but I would have preferred that it was on the side of the calculator and not on the bottom.<br /><br />The calculator is very stylish and attractive. It follows the Apple keyboard design styling.  This would make a nice gift for someone and it is a great addition to your own office.  I rated this as a 5 star item.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Keeps the brain sharp. Fun for all ages with no need for parental guidance. An app that has become a fun time killer.
0060555661|5.0|After reading dozens of investment books, I must admit that this one is the best at providing practical information that you can use to understand the financial markets. Graham teaches you his concept of value investing (how to identify and buy undervalued securities). Though some of the concepts are old-school now, this book is surprisingly valuable and holds up well. The advice of Graham and Buffett are without equal. If you are able to absorb all the wisdom from this title you know everything you need to do serious investment research. You will know how instead of relying on other people's recommendations. Ultimately, this book will teach you much about finance. This is how generations of investors learned how to invest and now you can follow along. You will know how to invest and devise your own techniques with the building blocks learned in this book. This book can show you the way but you won't get to the next level unless you absorb and apply the fundamental strategies.<br /><br />Buy this all-time classic! With the 2008 downturn making many investment books obsolete this still ranks as one of the best.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Great addictive free game. Just keep pushing to see more levels - does get a little repetitive. But a good time-killer.
1582701709|2.0|Let's keep this short and sweet. The movie was great for exciting the audience and delivering a positive message. However, the book is surprisingly small (just under 200 pages), full of quotations, loaded with standard self-help advice from some of the names in the business (e.g. Jack Canfield, Dr. John Gray). With that talent the book could have been so much better. I've watched the movie a few times but I doubt the book is worth another look. It's such a light read that I am not too keen on checking out Rhonda Byrne's other books. It's hard not to be a little disappointed because it seems the movie script contained more info and is much more enjoyable. Overall, the book contains 13 chapters including the biography section.<br /><br />* SPOILERS * Some of the \\"Secrets of Life\\" mentioned in the final chapter include: \\"You get to fill the blackboard of your life with whatever you want. The only thing you need to do is feel good now. The more you use the power within you, the more power you will draw through you. The time to embrace your magnificence is now.\\"<br /><br />#1 in Books > Religion & Spirituality > New Age > Mental & Spiritual Healing<br />#1 in Books > Religion & Spirituality > New Age > New Thought<br /><br />Both bestselling rankings are highly overrated.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy this game. My favorite is the many different minigames you can play. I am addicted to it!
B0089BSM70|4.0|Halloween II features Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) being stalked in a hospital after the injuries inflicted by Michael Myers in the original Halloween. The sequel doesn't live up to its predecessor but it is bloodier. It is one of the better horror sequels though (and certainly the best sequel in the Halloween franchise). The plot is a logical extension of the original film in a hospital setting (a slasher subgenre in horror).<br /><br />Special Features:<br />- Television Cut With Added Footage Not Seen In The Theatrical Version<br />- Audio Commentary With Director Rick Rosenthal And Actor Leo Rossi (Theatrical Version)<br />- Audio Commentary With Actor/Stunt Coordinator Dick Warlock (Theatrical Version)<br />- The Nightmare Isn't Over!: The Making Of Halloween II - Featuring interviews with Director Rick Rosenthal, Actor/Stunt Coordinator Dick Warlock, Actors Lance Guest, Leo Rossi, Nancy Stephens, Executive Producer Irwin Yablans, Director of Photography Dean Cundey, Co-Composer Alan Howarth and more!<br />- Deleted Scenes With Optional Audio Commentary From Director Rick Rosenthal<br />- Alternate Ending With Optional Audio Commentary From Director Rick Rosenthal<br /><br />Buy this 2-disc Halloween II Collector's Edition from Shout! Factory. It's jam-packed with stuff considering its only a sequel (most studios don't dream of releasing extras for them). Skip the single disc 30th Anniversary edition (which includes Terror in the Aisles) as it is nearly obsolete now. This BD/DVD is a real treat because of the extra cut, extra content and extra commentaries. Modern films don't have it this good. This version does not include the horror documentary Terror in the Aisles (1984) which is now sold separately. That documentary is a compilation of trailers and scenes from science fiction, crime drama and horror films of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. It is an enjoyable look back at some of the all-time classics but guest stars Donald Pleasence and Nancy Allen don't offer much in-depth analysis about the films. It does leave one wanting more and perhaps inspires you to watch the films. Ultimately you aren't missing much because the clips will be familiar to hardcore horror fans. It got a theatrical release in the 1980s but doesn't hold up well now.fer much in-depth analysis about the films. It does leave one wanting more and perhaps inspires you to watch the films.

1616551607|5.0|I can't believe how much artwork I got for such a reasonable price!  This is a great investment for any Yoshitaka Amano fan.  The beautiful sketches and rich colors are reproduced wonderfully on quality paper.  There is so much content that this massive set feels like it weighs 12 pounds!  I'm very happy that I bought this.  I've been a fan ever since I discovered my brother's Final Fantasy III (VI) instruction booklet.<br /><br />A few additional things would have made it perfect for me.  I know this is an art book, but I wish there was something written in the beginning about the artist and the media he works in.  Also, there is not a lot of artwork for some of the later Final Fantasies (especially VII & VIII).  Although maybe he just did not make much for those games.  He perhaps seemed to be using printmaking skills (time consuming) for those illustrations as opposed to his usual watercolor sketches.  Although I'm just guessing based on what it looked like.<br /><br />This is a great purchase for any artistically inclined Final Fantasy fan!
0691152640|3.0|This Time Is Different is a New York Times bestseller. It was published in 2011 and is 512 pages long. It has 17 chapters of financial info loaded with charts and diagrams. The chapters are split into 6 Parts: 1) Financial Crises - An Operational Primer, 2) Sovereign External Debt Crises, 3) Forgotten History of Domestic Debt and Default, 4) Banking Crises, Inflation and Currency Crashes, 5) The U.S. Subprime Meltdown and the Second Great Contraction, and 6) What Have We Learned?<br /><br />This book is a very ambitious academic paper that wasn't a particularly good read. I purchased this before there was a single critical review here so I was willing to give it a try. While it may hit the mark for some, as an investment professional I must admit I knew the gist of this info already. The real problem is that the book's message is buried under dense research with a variety of charts, stats, tables and graphs. The book does provide over 150 pages of data appendixes at the end that you won't read at all. While there is some good, well-researched info in here you are better off finding it elsewhere. I must admit I enjoy reading about investments but I couldn't read This Time is Different straight through. Perhaps the info would be better presented in a PowerPoint presentation or Excel spreadsheet. If you aren't a sophisticated investor I can't imagine sitting down to read this anyway because it is very dry overall and not very accessible for the novice. On top of everything I have discovered the book has some serious methodological flaws better described in other reviews. I have the hardcover but I hear the kindle version is even worse. With dozens of tables, figures and boxes I doubt it looks good in an electronic format.<br /><br />Sophisticated investors should check out Triumph of the Optimists or The Intelligent Investor.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My child loves this game. He got it because it was made by the same guy that made fruit ninja. I think it was fun for both my children
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read &#34;Wool&#34; over a period of two days. I read it in bed until the wee hours when I finally succumbed to sleep, my head still propped up by my fist and my iPad still shining in my face. Then I got up in the morning and read all day to the end. A fascinating premise. Solid writing. Memorable characters. All in all, great storytelling. Way to go, Hugh Howey.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|love, love, love this game my child can not put it down. He has a blast with it and then some
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is not my usual type of book.  I got it as an audio book because I kept seeing it on all of the bestseller lists, and a friend recommended it because she really enjoyed it.  I have to say - it is not at all what I expected.  I kept listening and could not stop.  It is really surprising how the book unfolds, and I did not see the twists coming.  I just bought the two earlier Gillian Flynn books because I was so entertained by this one.  It is not for everyone - there are graphic violence and sexual content that may be inappropriate for some audiences.  Overall, I found it difficult to put down, and that is the highest compliment I can give for a book.
B00A83075M|5.0|We went and took our son who is 5 to the theater to see this one. We liked it so much we bought it. Great movie for the entire family.

B001NLKZUA|5.0|Fun series. I like all the characters and the story moves along at a good pace. Four more words required for review.
0345472322|2.0|Dr Dweck offers an obvious insight, that the motivated among us have the better tools to learn.  However she offers no empirical data in her book to justify her supposition that intellegence is not a fixed trait.  For all the anguish Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein created with The Bell Curve, at least they provide the reader with the charts and graphs of peer reviewed data.  This book offers no such thing.  If the goal of this book is self help for the quitters out there, I think it has value.  But as a work of educational relevance, it either needs some citations or it needs to be recognized for what it is, mere psychobabble pap.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I wish it would have armor...and i wantto dig up gold and diamind but idk how to someine please tell me
B009MYARIK|3.0|Good book but not Kinsella's best. I didn't like the short chapters going back and forth at the end. But still entertaining.
1781162646|5.0|This book was like the early Stephen King books - it has everything - it has &#34;ghosts&#34; - killings - mystery - love - a circus (or amusement park) - people who are not what they seem to be - etc etc.  I read it like a speed train - just loved it!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I felt the series was very well developed with wonderful colorful characters.  I especially enjoyed the strong and colorful female characters such as Queenie Terrill, Dorcas Layne & Emma Timmins, I also enjoyed the comical characters such a the Pratt sisters and Minnie the housemaid.  It reminded me of an British version of &#34;Little House on the Prairie&#34; but more realistic and not quite as melodramatic.I would have given it 5 stars but felt the final season was too short to merit the overall price offer to buy the complete series.
B00CFA227C|5.0|I could have purchased this DVD anywhere and it would have worked.  However, I once again decided to do it the easy way.  I ordered it from Amazon.  It arrived on the day it was available in the stores, it was packaged well and I had to do nothing.  BTW, my favorite thing to do.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great show that i couldn't wait to download it and paid for the shows as they came out on amazon.
B000000OU0|5.0|I had to look hard to find the version of Hotel California I wanted.  This had it.  Great rhythm beginning.  I bought the CD just to get the one song.  Worth it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game. Enjoy playing. Challenging but entertaining. Would recommend. Definitely a problem solving thought provoking game. Well put together. Great!
B009O07NMA|4.0|saw them on Tim McGraws CBS show..they did a great job, like their mix, great tunes to play while driving the car, keep making CDs guys
B0052AC8C6|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be a little dry as far as Dream Works animations go but it was actually very good with many good moral lessons for the kids.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Everyone should have this movie.  It is a classic movie for all ages, Big is  a definite keeper movie !  Sweet, fun and innocent
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Only getting better by the season i hope they keep it up. One does not simply watch the first season then stop. :)
B001AGXEAG|3.0|I think it is more for adolescent to teenage years.  It is entertaining but can be scary to younger children.  For my age group 50....not so entertaining.
B00BY7NK96|5.0|I really think this book is an eye-opener for both men and women. It's definitely worth a read as it will get you to question the things you think you know about what women have to deal with in the workforce and the social-professional space but also how we need to go about fixing them.<br /><br />If you are a women. If you employ women. If you work for a women. If you work with a women. You need to read this book. If you don't, you also need to read this book and figure out why.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|great acting, directing, special effects, score, photograpy......a little over the top and way too familiar...also I really am not turned on by repeated cussing by such young characters to be honest
B00006EXDM|5.0|I have bought this album twice, the cassette once and on compact disc for the second time.  Well worth it.
B001L83PLQ|3.0|The book was sad and showed the civil war in Nigeria. It is fiction, but is meant to show what really went on. I think it's good to know, but it's from the Nigerian opposition's point of view.  There are many points of view to consider.  That said if this is as accurate as it is depicted, what happened was unconscionable.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|This cd pairs well with Hot Rocks as a continuation of their always-great body of work!  Go for it, you'll like it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received mine 2 days early and have been using it more than expected. Build up a queue for Netflix, YouTube and Play Movies & TV for the family so everyone is happier. I personally like it a little more than Roku because I can pick something from Netflix much quicker and because Roku doesn't have YouTube (I am aware of the work a rounds). For those of you wondering this thing consumes lass power (4.25W vs 5W) and want to put one on all 3 TVs in my house.
0937381888|5.0|Great book, especially for a beginner. It helped a lot while brewing my first batch which is currently in the secondary fermenter now.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great show, well acted lots of meat on the bones.  The story is great and the acting superb I cannot wait for season 3.
B00124PXW8|5.0|For those who love thrills and chills, this is a true classic.  There are no multiple horrors. Its more the way the story slowly creeps into your mind and grows strong in its horrifying way. Linda Blair scares your to the core.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Gone Girl was the best Gillian Flynn novel ever.  Since reading Gone Girl, I have read her other novels.  I like her style of writing.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Graphic are great, very challenging and lots of fun been the and the bad guys! Would recommend it to anyone.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|5 stars!!!  The audio and video are great.  They look fantastic and sound wonderful!!!  We are VERY happy to have these movies on blu-ray.  Buy it and ENJOY!!!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Was long and fun. I am a fan though. I liked the whole thing. Hulk is unstoppable. Didnt realize how long it was until I looked up and saw tge clock!
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|I never thought I would live to see the day when I would be comparing another trio to Rush...But that day has COME!!! OMG, these guys are ON FIRE! Kicking @SS and taking NAMES!!! This entire album just ROCKS!!! I just HOPE that they stick around for ANOTHER ALBUM!!!
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|It's always good to see the Doctor.  Matt Smith brings a unique form of madness to the immortal Time Lord.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I am on my 2nd Logitech G930 headset and am getting ready to request a return. I sent the 1st back because it would randomly turn itself of, take 10-20 seconds to turn on and have audio replaced with awful noises that cleared themselves up eventually no matter what was tried, only to return again.<br /><br />Really too bad because they are so comfortable, they just not reliable as an audio device.
0486406482|4.0|I bought the book to work with a high school student.  I had never read the before even though I was an English major (long ago).
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is a great game for kids. I am 10 and I think this game is awesome!!!!!!!!<br />It should definitely be a 5 star game
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is the best collection I could ever ask for. It is so crisp and the restoration is second to none!
B00DW39B2K|4.0|Killing Season reminds me of Dead Man Down in that both movies received so little publicity and hype, but both of them are unexpected gems.  This movie is a well-written story of two men reeling from the Bosnian War.  They are broken and pursuing the wrong paths in life.  When they clash, it is for a good reason.  And that clash is pretty entertaining.<br /><br />The characters are developed enough for a movie that feels like a really enjoyable short story--if that makes sense.  The acting is superb--how could it not be?  Surprisingly, the action is tense and realistic.  The plot contains quite a few twists as well.  I enjoyed not knowing what would happen.<br /><br />Furthermore, this movie presents a deeper message about war and humanity that it refuses to shove down your throat.  In the end, you will contemplate war, the effects of war, the duties of a man as a human being, and all that sort of existential stuff.<br /><br />Definitely a surprisingly fun film to watch.  Who doesn't want to see two guys battle it out in the woods?  While it is not a life-shattering experience, it is light years beyond the crap we get from Hollywood.  If you enjoy meaningful movies with alternating paces and realistic violence, go for it.  RENT it.
B00ADLCC9I|3.0|With this tablets internal hardware I figured that it would be a good candidate<br />for Android development; since this tablets internals are pretty close to high<br />end cell phones this makes it ideal for testing.  Now for the down and dirty;<br />the Archos Gamepad has some pretty bad software issues that need to be<br />overcome.  The version of Android that ships with the device is stable but<br />has a number of features that are lacking.  The inability to install applications<br />onto a Micro_SD card is a major limiter; taking this into account along with the<br />slew of default software that load themselves into memory randomly and you<br />have a system with the user being ham-stringed.  Not being able to properly<br />root the device is something that any power user is going to sorely miss as<br />well.<br /><br />Aside from the Firmware/Software issues the Gamepads gamepad is the only<br />other complaint that I can think of; the lack of a true D-pad can be annoying<br />and the joysticks design and placement are lacking.  Though for all of its issues<br />the Archos Gamepad is a pretty solid device that simply needs refinement.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I am enjoying this release very much and I have to thank Sloopydrew's \\"The girlfriend test vs the fanboy test\\" review. It convinced me to get this release and I am glad I did. The sound, music, and quality are superb and with THX digital surround sound and a huge plasma screen, viewing is fun!
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|The theme of this movie, a friendship that develops into love, is very appealing.  Although the theme may seem idealistic, cultivating a real connection to another person before we become romantically attached should be the way we all fall in love.  There would be much less divorce in the world.  The quirky way that Jeff Bridges goes about it is another story.  His theories are way off base because of their extremism, but Barbara Streisand is brilliant in the way she finally makes him aware of his own harbored feelings for her.  Competition never fails!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|Blackberry Smoke is great! Anyone who loves southern rock will love Blackberry Smoke.  Getting ready to purchase the other CD's they have out.
140006922X|5.0|The items I disagree with. 1. Jesus was illiterate and came from a back woods town in the middle of no where. My humble opinion. There was an advanced nearby town. His family more than likely would have traveled to this town to work. 4 miles away. To operate their they would have needed to be fluent in multiple languages. 2. Jesus was a failed Mesiah who failed to overthrow the Romans. My humble opinion. I have not recently visited or seen a Roman bath house. I have seen a Christian church everywhere. He also claims the change from failed executed criminal to God incarnate was a \\"couple of years\\". It was actually 10 years +. ********* That said. I do appreciate the book lighting my fire to learn more about his times. James the just was Jesus brother and the one who took over the Christian faith after Jesus death. It was interesting to find who Paul was and how predominate his power became after the destruction of Israel in 70. I would recommend the PBS special from Jesus to Christ. This is on YouTube. The newest archaeological findings support my view on Jesus Christ being more educated then what was presented in the book.********** I read his book. I disagree with him on some points. However, this fox talking head called this a \\"spirited debate\\". Nope, like watching a 6 year old brat with no facts, get educated by Einstein. When this book is combined with a Public Broadcasting series from Jesus to Christ. It creates a nice foundation of understanding of where the New Testament come from. This interview is exactly what is wrong with Fox. She has not read his bio, background, or let alone the book. How embarrassing. 100 pages of end notes to his book that both support and go against his positions. ***************** [...]
1597801585|2.0|it's just pretentious and overly self-indulgent with its tone of &#34;you've gotta really care about a lot of details that aren't critical - ok? - great - here's 200 pages of non essential story details and 100 pages of story.&#34;
B003G4W49C|4.0|Has a good plot and is a great story.loved it. But it swore a lot<br /><br />Otherwise it was a great book
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Just started playing, for a free game, it has terrific graphics and I am enjoying it. I know children would really like this one.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best of the series so far.  Action packed and intriguing.  The Red Wedding pales in comparison.
B000I5X81A|5.0|On July 26,2013,we lost a great musician.His name is J.J. Cale. Some of you viewing may have never heard of him,but heard bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd,Eric Clapton,Allman Brothers Band and Santanna cover his music.J.J.Cale was 74 when he died.I beleave that this CD was the last one he recorded and a CD to buy.J.J. Cale and Eric Clapton worked real hard on this CD and it is great!If you don't have it yet,you should.One good song after another.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Interesting storyline, but at times it became too wordy for my taste. I did enjoy the character development, and I grew to care about several of them. The \\"piggies\\" were interesting, well-developed and depicted in a serious light with clever humor interjected. As a whole, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars. It didn't make me want to keep reading, like its predecessor.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game, great graphics.  Only thing that I would change is the way it goes all the back to the beginning of START.  It should start at the beginning of the game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This mobile app works just fine.  Makes it easier to quickly get to my mail.  I would highly recommend it.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|love the convenience of having this app on my Kindle Fire and my iphone. works perfectly on both. I highly recommend for any avid ebayer!

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|As far as I am concerned, they just killed set top boxes, and to a large extent cable television. So impressed.

B004MNO0BQ|5.0|I live air hockey and this is just as fun for me to play on my kindle. The fme has multiple levels from beginner and up an it should fit everyone's ability
B001FB563E|5.0|One of the best screen adaptation's of a brilliant novel I've seen in years. It is a truly harrowing, post-apocolyptic story. Completely believable, underplayed when it could have been 'amped up' by a less sensitive cast & crew. There was serious Oscar contention talk around Hollywood before its botched, delayed release. I think this film was caught up in a studio leadership change- I do know it opened here in Las Vegas at only one theater... A shame, please do check this one out.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It is a great game. The animation is awesome.  Once you start you are compelled to get to the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|A fascinating tale brought to life with believable characters in a not too distant time and country in a grand setting.  Excellent script, acting, and directing.  A heart warming saga...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and it is the best game 4  me and it is the best game and I LOVE IT
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|One of the best movies made...  It is exciting, anticipating and compelling.  I'm glad I bought it to add to my movie collection.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I have read a lot of science fiction over many years.  This is my first true \\"steampunk\\" story (not including Jules Verne), and I really enjoyed it.  Having a bit of hot romance made it even more interesting.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I can not say enough good things about this book. I have had all of my friends read it. I love the point of view of Drew, I love his sarcasm, and his Witt! And who can forget, he is HOTT HOTT HOTT! You can't go wrong with this one, get it and you'll be inlove!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 works great on the Kindle Fire HD. The game is addictive, with plenty of new goals to make one want to keep trying. It is fun, and you can easily spend an hour on it without realizing. Definitely try it!
B000NOKA0S|5.0|Recently, I rediscovered Leonard Cohen.  I heard him on  the WTTW channel.  I had forgotton his poetic lyrics and intense emotion his music evokes.  This album has him in rare form.  I am enjoying his music every day.
B003JTHXN6|4.0|Amazing to read about zappos if their culture is close to I want to work there! I look forward to the next chapter and the transformation of downtown Vegas.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I listen to Cold Fact and Coming from Reality every day in my car.  I now know why he has been so popular in other countries for so long.  Too bad we couldn't have discovered him sooner.  I guess all things happen for a reason.  I'm glad he is receiving kudos now.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|Creator Vince Gilligan says Breaking Bad is comedy, he's not kidding.<br /><br />The show is hilarious. Things that you only dream of happen on this show. After a while, you start to get that our guys have God on their side, whoever's in their way meet a horrible end; whenever they need help, help appears. When the airplanes finally collided, it occurred to me, this show has no root in reality, it is a farce. Not a satire, but an extremely well-made, elaborate and entertaining farce.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  Rodrieguez sings of the real life he knows and is always precariously perched on his fence watching and knowing his subject matter.  Good music, good musician, good singer.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game ever I reccomend this on ipad or kindle fire. it would still be great not on one of them.
1419705644|5.0|I had preordered this book quite a while ago, and to my unequivocal happiness, the Adventure Time Encyclopaedia turned out to be utterly awesome! If you are new to the Adventure Time universe, or if you are a day-one fan, or if you just want some information on a show that enlightens your conversations with your kids, this is the book to do it.<br /><br />You will notice two things the instant you get this book in your hands. 1) The format is a bit smaller than most other \\"encyclopedias\\", and 2) The quality is immediately evident the minute you open the cover.<br /><br />Some readers have complained about the size of this book, but I have to say, the 'digest' size of The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia is absolutely perfect for a number of reasons. It is easier to carry along with you wherever you go, it fits into most bags, backpacks, briefcases, etc.. rather easily, and it doesn't take up wasted space on your bookshelf. I have noticed a large number of publishers migrating to this particular size and I am glad that they are.<br /><br />The quality of this book is amazing in that it keeps with the unique art style and character designs of the show, but casts a whole new light on the land of OOO. Everything that we know and love is new again. EVERY piece of art in this book is a masterpiece, even more so if you are an Adventure Time fan, and it really brings the text to life while putting a big grin on the readers face. The layout of the book is perfect. The Adventure Time Encyclopaedia is made out to be \\"authored\\" by Marceline's father, Hunson Abadeer, and so right off the bat we are treated to specific warnings telling us not to continue to read for fear of terrible things happening to the 'unworthy readers' and one of the most unique, and reassuring, forwards in any book I've read. The letter-fonts used throughout the book could not be more appropriate, including those used by Finn, Jake, and Marceline as they scribble notes through the many chapters, and the pages are beautifully printed on a thick, matte stock. As mentioned earlier, the artwork is astounding and the colors are vivid when needed, and dreary in all the right places. Even the front and back cover are a testament to the quality of this product. Offering a hardbound well printed cover, mixing both glossy and flat artwork with a cool, old-school print in the background.<br /><br />Hardcore fans will find something new in this book, and new fans will be delighted to learn all that this book has to offer. From the awesome two-page map of the land of OOO printed on the inside cover, to the quirky biographies of all the main-players in Adventure Time, all the way to the final page containing the lyrics of Marceline's \\"Daddy, Why Did You Eat my Fries\\" hit song, this book is amazing and fun to read over and over. Let's not get into all the lore, wizard's spells, and great locations strew about the land of OOO...... instead, just pick this book up yourself. You definitely will not regret it, and this book truly is worth the wait and worth every penny spent on it!are beautifully printed on a thick, matte stock.

B009UNGYHG|4.0|It has great sound quality, and fits great in my ear.  However, when using it with my GPS, the sound quality was horrible.  After going to a number of online community groups, I learned that this was a common problem that could be corrected by upgrading the firmware.  I tried to do that only to learn that it doesn't work with Mac computers.  It requires contacting Plantronics for a replacement.  Good luck!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Do you know that feeling when you want to read something and you have to either find someone that has it, go to the library or take your check book to the book store. Kindle takes all that away. In the comfort of your home you get to peruse titles, order, download, and read a book of your choosing. What could be better. There is even a button for immediate return if you ordered by mistake. Kindle is a device that every reader desires. Will books go out of style, never. I still need books for the moments when I have to pause to charge my kindle and when I am in the sun, though I have not tried sunglasses yet and that is what we use when we read in the sun. I love my kindle. What is one draw back. I read late into the night and run the risk of waking up my husband or not getting enough rest to do my job, teaching, in the morning. I love my kindle, and I will Kindle on.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Great cast and good storyline, including an ongoing story plus weekly clients with thought provoking issues.  I missed it when it first aired so I am glad to be able to catch up on it on Amazon Prime.

B000WC39SG|4.0|A little pro America and kind of farcical about the violence, but solid ensemble cast and great locations/effects for a movie from its time.
B0090SI582|4.0|Comparing \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" to \\"The Wolverine\\" is like comparing apples to oranges.  They are both about Marvel's burly and animalistic Wolverine, but they could not be any more different.  Origins seemed to explore a bit of Wolvie's past under the framework of the prior X-Men movies (i.e. familiar characters, settings, and themes), but unfortunately it didn't hit home like the prior X-Men films.  The writing fell flat, because 20th Century Fox took odd twists and turns with fan favorites like Gambit and Deadpool and then never expanded on them in future films like they promised.  Instead of bridging Wolverine's backstory to the acclaimed X-Men trilogy, Fox ended up widening the gap.<br /><br />However, \\"The Wolverine,\\" takes an entirely different approach to the eponymous character.  Audiences get to see the Adamantium and claws stripped away in a more emotionally driven film.  Wolverine is facing an existential crisis.  Following the events of \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" filmgoers get to see the Wolverine battle is own mortality, or rather near-immortality, during a series of dream sequences centering-around Jean Grey, which is reprised by award-winning Dutch actor, Famke Janssen.  This creates a great underlying plot, and immediately sets \\"The Wolverine\\" apart from the other X-Men films.<br /><br />Surprisingly enough, \\"The Wolverine\\" closely follows the original comic book volume of Wolverine, Chris Claremont and Frank Miller's four-part miniseries, that set the tone and standard for Wolverine and his story arcs.  Even though the film is set after the events of \\"X-Men: The Last Stand,\\" instead of \\"X-Men Origins,\\" \\"The Wolverine\\" accurately showcases the events of the 1982 comic book series.  Slight changes have been made to modernize and fit the screenplay into the continuity of the X-Men franchise but on the whole I was incredibly surprised by the amount of source material represented in the movie.<br /><br />Following the conclusion of \\"X-Men: The Last Stand,\\" in which Jean Grey (aka the Phoenix) is killed by Wolverine in order to stop her from committing genocide, Wolverine  once again takes to the Canadian Rockies.  Living as an animal, Logan only ever comes down from the mountains to garnish what little supplies that he needs.  After a particularly unjust hunting party pulls Wolverine from his introspection and a mysterious Japanese woman shows up to escort Logan to her adoptive grandfather, the films gains traction.  The remainder of \\"The Wolverine\\" takes place in Japan with an almost all Japanese cast, and focuses on Wolverine's relationship to a (now) elderly Japanese man who Logan saved during the closing days of World War II after the atomic drop over Nagasaki.<br /><br />Rivals emerge and mutants aid both sides, but at its heart \\"The Wolverine\\" is primarily focused on Wolverine.  It discusses his mental state after killing Jean, his own mortality as he confronts an old acquaintance, and ultimately his place in an ever shifting world.  Hugh Jackman portrays the character perfectly.  He is, for lack of a better phrase, the only actor that could ever play Wolverine.  He is the best he is at what he does.<br /><br />Aside from the phenomenal adaptation and Jackman's performance, the action sequences are tight and the revelations are legitimately surprising.  There are only a handful of lines that came off forced or cheesy, but they can be forgiven considering the overall quality of the film.  The pacing is so smooth and cyclical, that I personally had difficulties telling where the climax of the film landed; this left me without a frame of reference.  Usually I can tell when the conclusion is eminent, but this time around I had difficulties nailing it down.  I think that this is a byproduct of closely adapting a mini-series into a film.  It felt more like a series of mini-climaxes akin to the conclusion of four separate issues culminating in the finale of a series.  Regardless, the flow was appropriate and I never felt that the film hung in exposition or action for too long.  It had great balance.<br /><br />This is a solid superhero film that pays homage to its source material better than most and keeps with the character's integrity after nearly fifteen years.  Cheers to Hugh Jackman and the whole crew for \\"The Wolverine.\\"  \\"The Wolverine\\" garnishes four-out-of-five stars.<br /><br />Also, do not forget to stick around for the after the credits scene.  It ties wonderfully into \\"X-Men: Days of Future Past,\\" which is slated to release May of 2014.  Its got surprises a plenty and if it doesn't get you excited for the next X-Men film then I'm not sure what would.ver felt that the film hung in exposition or action for too long.

B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis gives a truly epic performance as one of America's greatest leaders. Some argue it can be boring, but that's merely because they're uneducated simpletons. Should have been Best Movie over Argo.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|great album was one of the best I have bought yet. Would totally buy the rest of them. Great band.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|Original a classic. When I saw this, with all the extras, couldn't resist. On first listen, &#34;SPELLBOUND&#34; !!! Had to listen again and again. Grab it !!<br />PS. We're all DEVO !!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Lot of fun. Puzzles are interesting to solve, not so hard but just right to solve and you do not get frustrated. Thank you
B000AJIF4E|5.0|There's no reason for a low-profile audiophile like me to review these headphones, since they're already highly acclaimed by almost any professional audio producer you talk to, and there are hundreds of glowing reviews already. These headphones sound great, they're high quality, and at a great price. Not an ounce of regret!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and when my husband came home to find me glued to it one afternoon in tears, he said &#34;NO MORE!&#34; to which I replied, OH My Gosh, this author can write and if you would just read this you too would become so emotionally involved in the characters you would cry too.
030758836X|5.0|I put this book down after 60 pages or so. I then picked it back up this summer after about 4 months. ONce I got through the climax or about 100 pages in, I could not put it down.<br /><br />I am horrible at sticking to a book, but this one has an original plot. Very good!
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Realistic, unpolished, all business. No spiking the ball in the EndZone. Gives one a greater respect for our intel structure.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It' fun, challenging, addictive and he makes such cute and funny little noises I really enjoyed playing it and trying to get ahead in the game..
B005LAIH2M|4.0|Gave this movie 4 stars for the enjoyment it gave . The tongue in cheek humour was just great, especially poor Hansel being a diabetic form all that sugar. If you want a movie to watch that is full of action and to have a good laugh at the same time this is for you.
B003B02O14|3.0|Not as good as his other books. He seems to be running out of story or imagination. The book was okay but it  Left me kind of bored
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|I absolutely loved the remake!! The twist at the end was one word: AWESOME! It is totally worth the money to either buy or rent.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I didn't go in expecting much from this movie.  It turned out not to be that bad and nice to some old time action movie stars.  Unbelieveable at parts but hey, it's a movie.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|This is not my favorite Le Carre book. It has the expected confusion of characters and a timeline requiring periodic rereading to keep everyone in place. Its unique story and ending left me somewhat dissatisfied.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is a fun way to get your mind working while playing and wasting time. good puzzle game for any age
1490313370|2.0|I realize the writer is writing from his experience and wants to get across what he has learned. I respect that.  I had thought this might be a good book to share with my grandsons. However, after reading about half of it I would not share it with anyone. I object to the use of the f--- word and s--- word throughout. I would not expose my grandsons to this kind of language. I know they hear it at school but I am not going to pass on a self help book with that kind of language in it.<br /><br />I am 75 years old, have, had a career in sales, customer service and process improvement. I have been in the motivational field for 24 plus years with my own company, I found nothing in the book that I would want to share with friends or family.
0307887448|2.0|I found the writing style juvenile, underdeveloped, wordy. The entire book could easily be a short story and it wouldn't suffer. The story beyond the basic premise was predictable and mediocre, although there were some interesting twists here and there. The characters were paper thin and cliched geeky. Spoiler: the good guy wins and gets the girl (shocking huh ;)<br /><br />Fundamentally the writing was just bad, so bad that when compared to a well written book the difference is glaringly obvious. Try a Neal Stephenson book, or David Eddings there is no comparison.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|Good story line, nice action, and just a dollop of love. Very happy that the love interest didn't consume the story line.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have seen the alien movies multiple times, but never noticed the details till now. Absolutely fantastic audio and video quality. Has multiple versions of each movie with extended footage. I bought this on Amazon gold deals. for less than $25, this is a no brainier buy !!!
0307476073|5.0|Okay, Cheryl Strayed made some bad choices and seemed to keep getting herself into difficult situations, but she was so honest about her journey, both physically and emotionally.
B004UID2LC|4.0|I use it to keep myself busy on long trips and it is very good, otherwise I get very boared.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun to play and is pretty easy to get the hang of. This game can be played for hours on end.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great show, too bad some the the characters wanted off the show. Young actors think they are missing out on opportunities and they are not.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|If you a magic fan. You must have this app. I'm really enjoy the game even you pay full game.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|I generally like a Bosch novel and I was not disappointed. Connelly writes in a style that keeps you attentive and interested.
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|This book was every bit as good as Khaled Hosseini's other works! I was truly engaged from the first page to the last. What a pleasure to read!
0345803507|5.0|great book can hardly put it down a truely great read would recommend to anybody that isnt overly conservative about personal intimate relations as it does get graffic
B002SSBD6W|5.0|I made the decision to go vegan almost a year ago and this book has served as a reminder or to keep going. These animals are not always in the forefront of one's mind but the kindle app is this book is a great advocate for them, the planet and a reminder to me to be the kind of person I believe I am supposed to be.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun!!!! The graphics are amazing and the over all game is adorable, and totally fun!!!!! I love the movie, so when I saw the game I went bandannas!!!!;)
B0091REZMW|5.0|Love playing this game could play it all day but run out of energy so just keep going back to it
B005LJITS0|4.0|I wouldn't say this movie is amazing, like X-Men or Spider-Man, but this movie was totally worth my time. Keep in mind, though, that I also enjoy movies like the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie, and Demolition Man. &#34;Fun&#34; is the best way to describe my thoughts on this movie. It's not a movie to be taken seriously, considering its over-the-top story with colorful, often animated characters. Not to mention, we have Ryan delivering his smug, cheesy lines like a standup comedian. As far as comedy goes, the humor isn't exactly bad, but not that hilarious, either. In short, this story falls somewhere between humor and adventure, and I had a good time with it.<br /><br />The visuals are a mixture of decorative and serious. The dominating CGI is glaringly obvious, but I think they really put some real work into it; I'm certainly not one to jump on the bandwagon and completely hate the computer-generated hero costume. I certainly buy that the outfit is &#34;not of this world.&#34; Although, how long have the Lanterns been guarding the universe without discovering how ineffective an eye mask is at protecting identities?
B00CFA222M|4.0|Good, a fun popcorn movie that the whole family can watch together lots of action , funny and lots of gaints
B000055XMF|5.0|I got what I ordered. Thanks. Fourteen more words: cat, dog, sandwich, elephant, cheese, Swiss cheese, Mozart, clumsy, catapult Pillsbury
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|been playing this game since it came out. hope they continue with different story lines. One of th better games by Big Fish.
0062255657|3.0|This book was more fantasy than what I expected.  However, it was a quick summer read and was pretty interesting.
1572814349|5.0|I ordered 3 Tarot Cards to practice.<br />This one was the most beautiful card with elegance with somewhat inspiration.<br />I love this card and I will definitely recommend to purchase this.<br /><br />Thank you!
B0051MKNV8|4.0|Bought this film on a recommendation from a friend who's opinion I trust.  Good movie and meshes well with my type of movies.  I thought DeNiro was a weak choice for the character he played.  Otherwise it was pretty good.
0738737909|3.0|This card itself is pretty good quality.<br />Thick and colorful...<br />But it is missing the most important thing.... The inspiration....<br />Arts are beautiful BUT some art works are too cheesy or without dignity, (mix of SF with some weird stuff)<br />This doesn't look professional at all,<br />I prefer Golden Tarot much better because it is beautiful and professional.
B005LAII8A|3.0|No matter how good the movie is - if the ending is weak then the whole thing suffers.  Interesting movie with a terrible ending so it gets three stars instead of four.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Amazed at the minds at work to create this. I'm itching to play the next installments. It is short - maybe took close to 3 hours - but it is worth the $2.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|What an enjoyable treasure.  I am not much for games but this one is so especially different and captivating.  No pressure, just fun.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Really fun game that never gets old or boring. Only down side to the game is that some missions require you to play friends through facebook.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I loved having the entire season on one dvd.  No commercials. No waiting until next week to see what happens. And, no missing out if you decide to get a snack or have to go to the bathroom or have other interruptions.  Lost contains so many hidden messages and clues that you must watch everything going on, even what seems to just be in the background.  The numbers on anything, license plates, the billboards, names on buildings, persons that are &#34;bumped&#34; into.  Conversations between characters always come back to haunt them or foreshadow what is going to happen.  This show keeps you on your toes....you might want to take notes.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was wonderful!  It didn't quite beat out my all time favorite, Les Miserable, but I thoroughly enjoyed the way it was written across time...
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I loved having the entire season on one dvd.  No commercials. No waiting until next week to see what happens. And, no missing out if you decide to get a snack or have to go to the bathroom or have other interruptions.<br />You might want to take notes as you are watching.  Everything you see or hear could be foreshadowing what is going to happen later.  This is a show I would have liked to had another season of!
B0041KBWM0|4.0|I enjoy thoroughly how this story unfolds. Let yourself be swept away in this very unique BBC film filled with dram.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is definitely another game that once you start playing it is hard to quit!  I like how you can pick the different block styles and the different back ground styles.  That is neat!
B003VS0CXS|3.0|Dick Van Dyke had a way with these kinds of movies. My modern children enjoyed it and watched every bit of it. The movie was cheap enough and long.
1932100660|4.0|The book is based on a long term China based study that draws a compelling connection between diet and disease. Although it restates what we already know about the negative impact of overeating meat and avoiding vegetables, the scope of the study and analysis of the data add real \\"beef\\" to the argument. If your looking for a way to bring optimal nutritional value to your diet, this book very persuasively points the way.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was a good book. Didn't like that much was skipped or how it ended, but a good book none the less.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This was an amazing book! I loved how Rick Riordan tied in Greek and roman gods and goddesses! I recommend this book to pre teens that like adventure stories
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is brilliant storyteller. Most captivating read but wish didn't have to wait so long for 3rd installment. Fantastic!
0810983915|5.0|This book was for my grandson and got here in a reasonable amount of time and was in Excellent condition! He was very happy! Thank you!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|The entire cast is great in this movie. Nice combo of comedy,romance,and drama! Very entertaining movie. A must see movie !
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Great movie! I love all of Nicholas Sparks books. One of my favorite! Julianne Hough and Josh Duhamel were amazing! Two thumbs up. :-)
B002QYSZBO|3.0|For the most part the movie is good but not great. It starts off very good then turns not so good towards the end.
B000B8L6LI|5.0|This is the second lansky  that I have bought.<br />I bought the three stone set because that's all you<br />need to put a razor edge on a knife.<br />Shipping was fast and packed well.
B000UYJR7I|5.0|Very entertaining movie. Samuel Jackson at his best. The movie has sex,comedy,drama,and a positive message when it's all said and done. You won't be disappointed with this movie !
B00CWY76CC|5.0|my daughter and I love this app we can not get enough. just want to keep playing playing playing and then play some more.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|I was very sorry I rented this movie. I think Daniel Craig is great as James Bond. I really liked him in Casino Royale;but Skyfall in my opinion really did fall ! Not very entertaining,boring !!!
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Metal Gear Solid is an incredible franchise with an insanely convoluted plot. The gameplay is challenging, but rewarding and very addicting. There is over 100 hours of Metal Gear goodness here that you don't want to miss. It includes 2 graphic novels, Metal Gear Solid 1-4, all in HD (minus 1 and VR Missions), and Peace Walker HD. Incredible value, even the two original Metal Gear games for MSX. Plus an art book? Pure steal for $50. Experience the Legacy that is Metal Gear Solid today. Any PS3 owner owes it to themselves to play this awesome game franchise from the master Hideo Kojima.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Today, I just bought the Magic and just started reading it from start and to my goodness, I am taken by good things mentioned in this creation by Rhonda.<br /><br />I think, &#34;if you are not reading something like this book you are missing many things that, life has for you&#34;.<br /><br />GO!!

B00CF2UORK|5.0|Shaun became an instant favorite of my grandchildren.  Then I started watching him!  A very funny cast of barnyard characters lead by a very inventive sheep with the sheepdog as his hapless accomplice.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Great streaming, very clear and had no problems with this all time great Christmas movie that can be watched anytime of the year!
B007T2XC7A|4.0|You cannot go wrong with Norah Jones.  Stressful day at work?  Just turn her on and let her sweet voice calm you down.  This is one of my favorite albums of hers.  I'd have to say Good Morning is probably my favorite track on this album.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Grandson loves it, loaded very easily, all parts worked, subject matter was okay for grandchildren, colors vivid and fast 0¿0
B00BD62X14|5.0|Her voice has a wonderful, calming and restful quality and I especially like that in songs being sung in French.  Also, I had read about her during her time with Eric Clapton and was curious to hear her voice.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I do not like the updated app from The Weather Channel.  I find it hard to read with all of the glossy graphics, and its basically an ad machine.  I liked the older format much better.  I simply go else where now on my Kindle Fire when I want weather information.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|I have not yet listened to the product but it is Bon Jovi so it should be good.  service in getting here was ahead of scheduled date so that was good, it arrived undamaged, so all in all a pretty good experience
B00DU74U74|4.0|I preface this with a couple of things: first, I find the Twilight Saga less than thrilling, and second, I thought The Hunger Games film was better than the book. I have not read The Host, but my boyfriend has and says that the romance in the book is a much bigger facet to the written story than the film. It's the same with The Hunger Games, and perhaps that's why I liked that movie more. Anyhoo, The Host doesn't dwell over-long on sappy romance, so I was pleased.<br /><br />The Host is a neat take on an Animorph's yerk-esque theme in which the focus is nearly completely internal. The backdrop of the post-apocalypse is slick and the story itself engaging. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanness of the conversations between the alien Wanderer and her host, Melanie. The actors carry their performances well and the cinematography is interesting and eye-catching. Love (of the caring for people without the sex thing assortment), non-violence, compassion, and redemption are the driving themes of the story, in an enormous contrast to the Twilight Saga that I hadn't anticipated. Worth watching.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|The characters were well developed, and everything about this book and the movie were perfect. It lived far beyond my expectation.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Of Monsters and Men take interesting lyrics and rhythms and combines them in a way that grabs your attention and brings you back for more.  Easy listening and worthwhile.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's like you have an actual horse right there with you! I play this game EVERYDAY. Itnis AWSOME! Everyone should play it.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I have only played the first few puzzles but it's fun so far .Beautiful graphics and the music is pleasing and right for the game.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|From Pixar, the Makers of Toy Story, Finding Nemo and Wall-ee, This is a tale with an unusual take on children and monsters in the closet. John Goodman is an incredible actor, and here he shines as James P. Sullivan, a monster who works in a factory that produces energy by collecting the screams of children. He and his best buddy, Billy Crystal as Mike wazowski are in contention with another monster, Randall who is seeking to top the scare record any way he can. However, Randall has some dark plans of his own to revolutionize the industry and that includes kidnapping children.His plans are interrupted when Sulley accidentally lets a little girl into the monster world resulting in a city wide panic because the monsters have always believed human children were toxic. While he and Mike are with the child though, things begin to change as Sulley grows attached to the little girl named Boo, and they discover that she is not at all dangerous, but Randall is and that his accomplice in the kidnapping caper is none other than their own boss Waternoose. How this is resolved is in the film, a wonderful romp that does have a point for it.It makes the dark and the shadows a bit less scary to think that monsters come out to make one laugh instead to frighten.
0439023521|4.0|I am a reader with a wide range as far as selections. I veer to the classics and back to books for youth; I like spiritual reads and deep literature. Finally, after all the fanfare, I sat down and actually read this--admittedly, a latecomer. This is a strange dystopian tale built on the theme and pulse of sheer survival. Perhaps, this is why so many enjoy this read. I have to admit, I kept thumbing the pages.<br /><br />Recommend, for its escapists pleasures.
B000068FY0|5.0|I purchased 4 Supertramp CD's recently and love each one. I had not heard this CD in well over 20 years, having recently started to buy more of the 70's music I loved so much when I first heard it in the late 70's. This music is timeless. Buy it and you will love it too!
B00006EXDM|5.0|This album brings back memories of the '60's and 70's. I went to a few of their concerts, and these are some of their best recordings.
B000002J0N|5.0|Great CS&N music. Listening to it again after a 20 years absence brought back fond memories of first hearing it in 1977. Great music and worth buying...
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|better than the last core i7. and the price is great, you dont need to buy a core i7, i will recommend this one.
B00701QV0A|4.0|I liked this CD and would have loved it had it not included bonus tracts with variations of some of the same songs on the original. However, once I got past that concern, I loved the style of the original music.  I have really enjoyed Alan Parsons Project music since first hearing it in the late 70's, and this CD keeps that enjoyment alive.
1475212607|4.0|I was close to making a decision.<br /> The consolidated information provided within &#34;Digital&#34; helped finalize the decision.<br /> The book is not perfect.There is always room for improvement(as a writer,I know this too well...).<br /> Go ahead and procure your copy.<br /> Just do it.You'll be glad you did.
B000068FWC|5.0|I purchased 4 Supertramp CD's recently and love each one. I had not heard this CD in well over 20 years, having recently started to buy more of the 70's music I loved so much when I first heard it in the late 70's. This music is timeless. Buy it and you will love it too!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|It is awesome!!!! I finished it in one day it was so addicting! I think everyone should get this game!

B0091REZMW|5.0|Awesome game with great graphics. Best hidden object game that I have played in a long time. It's a good adventure game.
B000001FN3|5.0|I was very happy to get this CD and hearing it again for the first time in over 20 years was a true pleasure. Unlike the Eye in the Sky CD that added bonus tracts, this CD stayed true to the original recordings tracts. I would definately give this a buy-it thumbs up for anyone on the fence.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved it. I love the graphics and the different places to find. Not too easy and not to hard. I really would like more of these to do.
B000002IVF|5.0|Well worth the money. David Crosby's voice is the reason I love to listen and relisten to his music. I was apparently under a rock when this first came out in 1993 and did not know of its existence. However, 20 years after the original release is not too late. Buy it and you can love it too.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is tha best game ever if u ever bord this game is tha best one to play u can play with facebook friends n challenge them 4 awards so i give it 5 stars
B000068FXX|5.0|I purchased 4 Supertramp CD's recently and love each one. I had not heard this CD in well over 20 years, having recently started to buy more of the 70's music I loved so much when I first heard it in the late 70's. This music is timeless. Buy it and you will love it too!
B005LAII8K|2.0|The first 35 minutes of this film started out good enough to qualify as a possible sci-fi classic.<br /><br />Then something happened.<br /><br />It is like they ran out of ideas and decided to start making another movie and just tacked the two ideas together.<br /><br />It started as a LOOPER story and then transformed into a story about telekinetic super babies (like an X-men character) and the primary story line was kind of shoved to the back.<br /><br />Worst yet, the \\"revelation\\" and \\"ending\\" was telegraphed so far ahead of time that it was almost painful to sit thru the second half of the film waiting to see what you already knew was coming.<br /><br />The film also needed better editing.<br />For the amount of story, it was too long.<br /><br />It just kind of churned and stalled in the middle to eat up time without moving the story forward.<br /><br />This COULD have been a great film since the concept was good --- but it did not come together.
0440244870|4.0|This is a good, fun read. I actually preferred the movie which is rare for me. Still, this is enjoyable & I have no hesitation recommending this book. This is also suitable for young adult readers as it's not crass or overly sexual.
B00BSN0K1C|5.0|loved the movie so i got this as a collectable i didnt open it left it in box but looks great
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We've watched all three seasons and wait eagerly for season four.  There is great interaction between the classes with interesting twists.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I bought this to read on my Kindle.  That was a perfectly satisfactory experience, but I liked this book so well that I'm going to buy a couple of hardcover copies, one to give away, one to keep on my shelf - and this when I've reached the age where I'm trying to clear off my bookshelves!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Puzzles are fun and challenging.  Makes you think out side the box. Time flies by when playing. I highly recommend this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great fun!<br />My granddaughter is having a fantastic time trying to<br />Collect bananas.  I haven't been able to keep up with her!
B008XG1X18|5.0|My only problem is I spend too much time on Pinterest because there are so many good ideas.I often share these with others.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I rented this movie on instant video to watch one night.  It was entertaining enough. It follows the Jack in the beanstalk story very well.  I think it would have been a nice movie to share with family if I had the dvd.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie has so many great actors that you just can't go wrong!  I watched it because Red 2 is being advertised.  I want to go see it - but haven't seen the first one yet.  It was action-packed, funny, and had a great story-line as well.  I can't wait to go see the new one!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I would have to say that Lark Rise to Candleford<br />is one of the best BBC series that I've watched.<br />I even like it better than Canford and Call the<br />Mid Wife.
B001FA0W5W|5.0|Enjoyed every bit of it.<br />Highly recommended reading for understanding uncertainty and why unpredictability is good for all of us.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I enjoyed this game immensly. It was well worth the small cost and worked well on my Kindle Fire. Tested my recall ability and I loved the fact it had no HO. Thank you Fire Maple Games for the entertainment.
B00CHILW64|1.0|The picture quality was horrible! It looked like I was watching it through a glass of water. Also the sound didn't have much bass in it.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie is great for the whole family, super cute characters! We really enjoyed this movie, the minions were super cute!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game..Love it..it's amazing I'm completely addicted to it :)<br />I love the movies and this games makes me love it even more I especially love the kung fu scrat minigame
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|We never understood the storyline. It was a complete waste of time and energy on our Saturday night! My husband actually believed that watching this movie was like listening to a foreign language audio book for three hours!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game I love it so much it great when u want to pass time and just to play whenever you want
B000I9U9A4|5.0|\<br />This is a beautifully crafted film. Performances are terrific across the board. The film allows a glimpse into the daily life of a fighting ship and her crew that call it home.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was just looking one day in the store and this was free and it is my favorite game since I got it. more fun than the movie and you can play as any minion you want.
1609611543|5.0|This appears to be an updated, annotated version of the earlier book (Lose the Wheat, Lose the Weight).  It references the scientific articles which support the theory.  As a scientist, I prefer this iteration to the original work.<br />As a cook, I find the recipes in the original work, to be more interesting than those in this updated volume.<br />If I were recommending books for a person who had no knowledge of the subject, I would recommend purchasing this volume first, and then collecting the original volume for the recipes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS IS A AWESOME GAME I LOVE IT IT IS AWESOME AWESOME GAME IT IS THE I AM NEVER DELETING THIS GAME
B007G5K066|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is problematic.  The filmmakers wanted to give this movie a dark, washed-out 70's look, which they achieved.  It looked great in the theater.  Not so good on Blu-ray.  In the lower light shots, which are most of the movie, there is often an excessive amount of film grain.  At times, the picture is so gritty that it starts flashing--alternating between light and dark.  I adjusted the picture of my television, making it darker, and that helped some.  But it made an already dark movie even darker.  This might be one of those rare cases where the DVD is easier on the eyes than the Blu-ray.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, you might want to stand pat.<br /><br />My rating of four stars is for the movie.  If I were only rating the Blu-ray transfer, it would only get two stars.  That's a shame, because this is an otherwise well-crafted film.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I LOVE IT I MAKE SKINS,TEXTURE PACKS,AND MODS FOR IT I LOVE MINECRAFT AND I MAKE TONS OF CRAZY CREATIONS I ALSO HAVE A REDSTONE MOD AND A MINECART MOD SO ITS MORE LIKE THE PC
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Love it!  What more can one ask for other than to watch it with the cast and a few friends.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter has been wanting a real horse although this is not what she wanted she plays for hours on it
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I truly enjoyed The kite runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns and therefore jumped at Khaled Hosseini's newest novel.<br />Unfortunately I was lost for most of the book. The story changed from one character to the next without warning, from one time frame to another as well.  I suggest you keep a detailed character list by your side as you read this book if you want to be able to follow the story. I was highly disappointed!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed the series as expected, after watching the first episode I was looking forward to watch more,and I was not disappointed.  I loved it !!!
0143122916|5.0|Far too many people around the world dismiss the plight of the North Korean people because of the lunacy of their leaders.  This tells us all why we need to care about them thru the amazing life story of one man's birth in and escape from one of their political labor camps.  A great but difficult read because of the tragedy of this man's life or survival without the joy of family, friends or even a basic understanding of the real world outside of North Korea.  Its sad that sixty years after the armistice, the plight of the North Korean people remains so dire and seemingly without solution.
B003WE9TU8|2.0|I had high hopes of this book after seeing the movie rushes. But its kind of boring. Describing a Zombie war through a series of interviews. Some of the story ideas are good.<br /><br />I will be looking out for more books from this author. Even though this first effort is so-so.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Tangled was just what I needed after reading quite a few angst ridden books that while great, makes you feel like your dog just died.<br /><br />Drew and Kate's not so typical love story had me laughing and smiling so much, I thought my face might break!!!  Drew is your typical manwhore, who never thought he would fall in love.  Of course, that is before he meets Kate.  She is hired to work at his father's firm and is just the right antedote for Drew's carousing ways.<br /><br />They vow not to get involved but then of course they do.  Mindblowing, steamy, panting wetting sex and crazy, out of your mind verbal volleyball between these two had me enjoying every page.<br /><br />Drew manages to screw everything up with Kate but he finds his heart so shattered that his sweetness and deep down love for his woman comes through and he does his best to win her back.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough.  It had it all for me: a swoonworthy man, funny as hell scenes between the characters, wild and insane sex scenes, and of course, a love that even a idiotic man, such as Drew, can't even ruin.<br /><br />A huge 5 stars to Emma Chase for the funniest book I have read this year.  I cannot wait to see what she gives us next.<br /><br />Now go read it!!!!  You will not be disappointed :)
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new app is horrible! It's useless and until/if the old app returns, The Weather Channel app has been removed from my Kindle Fire.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|It's a good YES album.  It makes you feel great / up-lifted, if you know what I mean.  I had kinda lost contact with the band in recent years and just played a lot of the old stuff.  To me, this one has a feeling of DRAMA era yes, maybe because Geoff Downes is playing keyboards, I don't know.  All I do know is I like it a lot and recommend giving it a listen.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best by far of all calculators I have tried out on my kindle fire its great for school I would even payed for it but the free on is great as it is.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The people you meet in this book seem very real.  Just like any group anywhere, their lives are filled with adventure, love, sorrow... The author makes them so real, I feel  I have a new group of friends.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Downloaded it to my Kindle and played all afternoon. Needless to say,  there was nothing accomplished this afternoon outside of The Room! More please!
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|I really liked this  movie.  Generally movies like this tend to be predictable, and this one was to an extent...I really liked this movie and if you watch the entire movie, you will be glad you did (trying not to give to much away).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another great tale by Mr Hosseini.  I little difficult to follow initially, but very neatly tied together as the story progresses.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing. I haven't done the other games offered, like spider solitaire or the one about kings, maybe later.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|Excellent product. I enjoyed every single moment I spenton it. I would definetly reccommend it to anyone who asked me my opinion!
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|So far so good. The music is ok and the game seems fun enough. It reminds me of Escape the Room but with  a timer and I hate timers. Why is there a need to make people feel rushed so I take away a star for that. Kudos for not having a post your scores to whatever media site people use and for not having a top score list.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This novel reveals the ways in which the human brain which perceives the world in what is called the autism spectrum. Very fast moving, entertaining and enlightening.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this app! It is so addicting and it's a great time killer. It's a fun game that as you go on it gets more and more challenging. Great brain exercise.
0812982622|5.0|A terrific read in every way. Wonderful story and characters. I highly recommend it, especially for students of history and the Koreas.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun,  addictive.  Cheaper than going to your local casino and playing all night.  Love the free daily tournaments.  Wish they would up daily credits.
1577314808|5.0|I read a lot of spiritual and self help books. I found this to be very enlightening.<br />It arrived in a timely fashion<br />Certainly a book worth reading!<br />Take what you like and leave the rest....
B008JFUPK8|5.0|This movie was great.  Great story, acting, and action.  Henry Cavill makes a perfect Superman.  I've read negative reviews about the ending as well as all the destruction caused by these god-like characters.  Those are silly and make me laugh.  I think those folks are just looking for something to complain about.  This is an awesome movie, can't wait to watch it at home.
B0042816YK|5.0|Loved this movie...Very inspiring!<br />Julie Roberts is Fabulous...<br />I analyze and took a lot of deep things that resonated with me ♥
B007QNRRIC|5.0|I bought this album after hearing New York Mining Disaster way back in the 60's.  My favorites are To Love Somebody and I Can't See Nobody.  My friends and I played the vinyl album until it wore out.  I was so happy that this album has been remastered and could be downloaded.  I HIGHLY recommend this album to anyone who should own a &#34;must have&#34; collection.  A lot of people had associated the group as disco, along with Barry Gibb's newly acquired falsetto voice, after Saturday Night Fever came out.  This album, along with Idea, Horizontal and Trafalgar, are the essence of the ORIGINAL and TRUE Bee Gees.  Their own written songs, along with their OUTSTANDING harmonies, will NEVER be duplicated.

B00448VST6|4.0|This movie mashes comedy, romance, and a video game-like world where a man is on a quest to win his love's heart by defeating a league of 7 evil x's. A great movie worth the investment.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks is a brilliant story teller.  The storyline itself was neither unique nor extraordinary, but it was both thrilling and moving at the same time.  The story flew by.  The descriptions of the violent inflictor's state of mind in conjunction with the victim's horrible experiences were the best part of the book, I thought.  The climax was somewhat expected but still very exciting.  The surprise twist gave such an emotional ending.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Watch it now.....right now....but watch season 1 and 2 first.<br />This Tv show has great action, character development, intense moments, and all around good plot. One of the better zombie apocalypse renditions out there. Every person out there can find a character they relate to in this show. A very diverse set of personalities.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a counter vote to the people giving it bad reviews without reading it. This is a counter vote to the people giving it bad reviews without reading it.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|This is classic Seth Macfarlane humor. The story line is not original but is not a bad take on the whole magic toy comes to life plot. Unlike all other toy-related movies, this one is not for kids. expect Family Guy and American Dad style humor from this movie. If you like that kind of humor, this is the movie for you. If not, avoid this one.<br /><br />But I like that style of humor so A+
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|How nice to see Ozzy back with Tony and Geezer; AND how nice that his voice is strong and powerful on this album. These is some of the best material from  Sabbath in a very long time in spite of or perhaps because of the lymphoma that Tony has been battling for the past 2 years. The music is fresh, motivated and feels like The Black Sabbath I came to love in the 70's.....Long Live The Kings....AGAIN!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing! It has me coming back for more every time. Very tense and thrilling, makes you care about each and every character. I recommend this show to everyone!
B00847KFDS|4.0|I was initially VERY apprehensive about buying this album. I HATE seeing legendary artists feel the need to duet with newer artists to REVIVE their career or to seem relevant to a new generation. He IS after all John  Fogerty one of the greatest song writers of the last 50 years. His blues rock voice and guitar chops are legendary. But as I listened to snippets of the songs on-line I could tell that he was just having fun playing his songs with other musicians he liked. When the CD arrived and I could listen to it at length it was indeed just that. It is a very nice album with John doing some cuts solo. My favorite cut is the one he does with his two sons. I would have given it 5 stars but as I said this type of album is not my cup of tea; I like listening to JOHN do HIS material. But as this type of project goes this is a very nice one.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This is a fun game but the animation and audio qualiy could use some work<br />Other than that this is an awesome game
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I enjoyed this game a lot and is very entertaining. I would recommend this game to friends!  :)<br />If you like this game then you'll love Doodle Barnyard and Doodle Devil. They should make Doodle Fantasy!!!!!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have a iphone 5 and the battery goes dead quick!  I have charged it about 5-6 times off of this and have not needed to recharge yet.  Going to try with my gopro hero 3 black which also has a terrible battery to try some time lapse photos.
0307744434|2.0|I had SUCH high hopes for this book. The reviews were high, several customers kepts buying it at the bookstore I work at, and the summary sounded interesting. I bought this book last year and finished it a few weeks ago. I normally finished books but this one was a complete disappointment.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- The title/cover art is gorgeous and I fell in love with the writing style of Ms. Morgenstern instantly. The fact that she kept up the \\"quirky\\" tone throughout the entirety of the book was impressive. The \\"plot\\" or more like the premise of the summary of the back of the book was promising. A night circus? A magical battle? A fight to the death? Heck yes! But unfortunately Morgenstern does not deliver. That entire summary is false advertising!<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Meaningless characters: I did not care for a single character in this book. NOT ONE. Why? Literally, any of these characters are interchangeable! They are so paper thin, 2 dimensional, and ridiculously boring that they could mesh into one another. There was a scene were Celia and Isobelle were having wine or tea togther (by the way that is ALL these guys do. Drink tea, converse over wine, and chatter about art and poetry. They came off being way too pretenious) and I paused noticing how similar the two were. They were both nice and pretty. The only thing \\"distinguishing\\" Celia is that she loves books. There's even a scene were one of the characters dies and I honestly didn't care. I was like so? Let's move on with the story here people. Characters make and break a book. These characters definitely broke the story.<br /><br />- The nonexistent plot: I read in the author's interview that she was apparently struggling to come up with a plot for this book. Well, surprise surprise! It was obvious for everyone:<br /><br />\\"The story came as a location created out of desperation. I was working on a different story altogether, one that was becoming progressively more and more boring because nothing was happening. I needed something exciting to happen and I couldn't figure out how to do it with the locations I had so I sent the characters to the circus.\\"<br />\\"It didn't have a plot for a very long time. Really, my biggest challenge was finding the actual story within all the atmosphere.\\"<br /><br />^^ Her own words. I mean the story started off with a lovey setting and enough mystery to keep me wanting to read...but that's all that happens. The author introduces about 20 some odd characters, there several meaningless chapters that don't pertain to anything, and there are way too many descriptions. That's literally what this book is - 500 pgs of descriptions, characters drinking wine, and boring conversations that are supposed to be intelligent. I felt like there was no magic in this book. Just interior decorating and fashion designing. And I became quickly tired of the repetative themes of the circus - it's black and white, it's black and white, and OH there's some red. I get it already! As an author, saying something once or twice is enough but Morgernstern pushed that out of the window here. And was there even a battle? What was the point of the circus anyway? Arghh!<br /><br />I could go on. I really could but I think many other reviews have done better than I have. I really don't understand all the high reviews. This book could have been good but because of the flaws I pointed out, I couldn't even finish it and winded up skimming the last 100 pgs. So disappointed. Hopefully the movie is better.appening.

B00DYVUBYM|4.0|I totally loved this movie. After Lifetime's little disaster, I heard there would be another version and I wasn't very sure about it, but everything changed when I heard that Sofia Coppola would direct it, and I immediately knew it would be amazing.<br /><br />The film has amazing actors (especially Israel Broussard and Emma Watson, and in this movie, she proves that she can play any role besides the \\"good girl role\\"; this time a bimbo), the way the story is told (not as cheesy as the Lifetime version), this one is darker, but lighter at the same time, and more appealing for teenagers. I just wish they would had shown more than the robberies (the film has like 4 or 5 robbery scenes, which takes a lot of minutes off the film, instead of showing us how their life was on High School, or when they did something else besides shopping and clubbing), the psychological sides of other characters besides Marc would had been amazing. But what makes this movie so special, is that the story is not about stealing stuff from celebrities, but also the things we would do for acceptance and to feel like we're part of something.<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoyed Spring Breakers, you will like the Bling Ring, and don't listen to bad reviews, it's awesome.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|The story flows very fluidly and the writers make it very easy to become enveloped in the outcome of the characters. Of all the law shows that I have seen this one doesn't just drown you in all the legalism of the profession but also shows that it is possible for the lawyers to lookout for the best interest of the clients and not just their own.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|If you like Emma and Sense and Sensibility from the late 90's this is a nice companion piece for your collection.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Just had to get these with the whole family loving Harry Potter. Especially the wife and sister in law. :-)
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Pure poetry! Ignore the young adult rating. I was pulled in immediately and couldn't put it down --- all the way through her sequel, Where She Went. Gayle Forman is an artist.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Love this series!  This DVD doesn't disappoint!  Would highly recommend to anyone.  Couldn't find it locally so I was happy to find it on Amazon.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|We love the cast and the storylines. You can't go wrong with the shows. There is always something to make you laugh.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Thanks to Sheryl Sandberg for speaking up and sharing her story.  The more success stories we hear, the more tools we have in our toolbox.  The candid look at her journey and decision points provides another source of strength and encouragement in each of our journies.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Best bit of software for any die hard android user.  Great capabilities for both local and networked storage.  I recommend to everyone that uses Android.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a must read. Such a wonderful honest story. I loved it! Jojo Moyes has a fantastic way with words
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Excellently written,held my interest throughout the novel. Sensitive portrayal of a family crisis with a surprise ending. A complex theme portrayed with ease.
076790592X|4.0|It's a really good one for this low price.<br />But it has many buckle fold on the edges. It doesn't really matter though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best get this app it is fun and funny!! the minion tries to run away from villians that are from dispicble me 2!! I totally recommend this!!!!
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|These puzzles changes a kids life just for a day then their smart.<br />Everything is the best part.<br />Their good like a pop tart.<br />I use it like a cart.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I've loved the movie for years, and the book has been on my must read list. I finally got around to it and it did not disappoint. I can't wait to read more from this author.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Love this app, it's so fun &amp; my daughter is obsessed with it! The only thing I dislike is you have to pay $$ out of pocket or wait two years to beat it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game in the history of games it so cute to see the little minions run by the way just get the game please you will fall in love with it
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a really fun game... The puzzles can be a challenge or easy... The graphics are beautifully done... I just love this game!!! Thank you for adding it!!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Fun game after you figure out that you have to go back and get some of the jewels that you left on prior levels to advance.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Good game but get a little upset when I can't get a level as fast as I would like to.  Have gotten several friends to start playing the game.
B001EC2IXK|5.0|Just watch it.  One liners galore. 14 more words required.  Now ten. Eight more words required. Now four. I'm done!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app it is so easy to use and understand. You can pick the different versions of Bible you like better to read. I recommend this app to anyone who loves reading the word and learning from God!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this upgrade does not work at all fast or well. wish you had left it alone. hard to get any viewable screen as it is mostly ads and pointless pictures.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|. . . and there is nothing shocking to me, a very committed Christian who belongs to a liberal mainline Protestant denomination and also spends a lot of time hanging out with Eastern Orthodox friends and in Eastern Orthodox churches.<br /><br />The writing is quite engaging,it is easy to read. It isn't knocking my socks off, but that is probably because, as some other reviewers have noted, this isn't really new stuff, just perhaps a more accessible presentation. One star off for failing to knock my socks off.<br /><br />Anyone who is a true person of faith (regardless of which religion) should be able to read this book and learn something from it without his/her head exploding.  Those of you Christians whose heads are exploding, have a talk with Jesus and ask Him whether His head is exploding, then follow His example.<br /><br />If a Muslim cannot write a book about Jesus, then no Republican or other white person can write a book about President Obama, so please knock it off.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|These impactful and gorgeously written books worm into your heart and mind and keep you entranced through every page. I've reread the trilogy, and cannot believe how deeply I am still touched. I am Katniss, mourning my duckling sister. I am Peeta, that ray of sun and hope and gentleness throughout.  I am Gale, burning with righteousness and anger. I cry, and laugh, and fight, and despair, and fall in love. And in the end I'm left with this sense of hope, that startled and startling thing with feathers, that we can, we must, create a world where every child runs through meadows without fear.  Without trauma.  With only love.....
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This one is worth it.  It allows up to 10 different sounds at one time.  There is a timer that allows you to go to sleep with it on.  I have a pillow speaker that allows me to mix and match a thunderstorm the way that I like it with urban sounds and white noise.  Great application!
B005HSGB6W|5.0|I love the author's writing style. The introduction opens a discussion on two endings i.e. with or without chapter 21.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This is a seldom used app, but when I am adding 1/4 inches this makes things easier. I like it.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Work well, fast and simple to use on my HTC ONE. Very efficient too. So far its the best among few other apps that I had used.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I am so glad I finally got around to reading this book. Being told from Drew's POV was the perfect way to read this. I loved Drew and his unashamed ways. I loved how Kate was strong, intelligent and did not take any crap from Drew. They are the perfect ying and yang. What Drew ad to go through and discover was perfect. Great first novel Emma Chase!
B001O6W9QC|4.0|Funny movie, but excessive F-bombs through out.  The movie would have been just as good without all of that, but still funny.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am in love with this show. I look forward to watching it all day long. It's so great that I get to watch it on my computer when I am &#34;working&#34;.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It's fun but it's not the best since many things you think of aren't in it but it is definitely worth the dollar for it
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This app does what it says. I was looking for something with more options and different kinds of lights. But for a basic non frills light this is great.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Entertaining. Not the kind of movie you remember for years to come, but definitely worth an investment of 2 hours of your life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|the first few episodes in season 1 of the walking dead were actually depressing and hopeless feeling to me.  despite that, i kept on watching because the characters, plot line, character development arc, etc. are so well done.  now in season 3, i'm fully hooked.  it's an absolutely entertaining show, worth every minute of the time my wife and i have devoted to watching it (on netflix and now on amazon) over the past 2 months.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really like this game. It keeps my brain working. I could play this for hours. If you are looking for something that will challenge your brain but you are tired sudoku puzzles like me this is a great game.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|A different take on the fall of civilization that keeps you riveted and wanting more. The story was compelling and heart breaking.
B002752NGA|4.0|it was entertaining, I liked the characters, and I would wacht it again. Basic vampire movie with action and good storyline.
B004X6PRO6|3.0|This book is so bleak and dismal.  The torture and abuse is never ending.  The main character becomes a loving and caring person in the mist of all his abuse, believable? probably not.  I got through it only because it was the book club book of the month, otherwise I would rather throw up.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I found it very enlightening with facts from the Germain and Russian point of view<br /> of WWII.  Since I read this while on vacation and not continuously, I found it a little confusing going from family members to other family members.  I wish there were a chronology page to refer to occasionally.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show, it is incredibly entertaining and good quality. So many modern shows rely on sex and dumb humor. This is a show that I don't feel awful after watching.<br /><br />I also enjoy and appreciate the two different views that are portrayed in the show. We are able to see life from the point of view of the wealthy royalty, and the men and women who serve them. This show also gives a good idea of the times. The entertainment, the food, the way of speaking, etc. It is definitely a worthy show of your time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is my life! So much fun and challenging. A good way to use your brain and have fun!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I have listened to 1/2 the album, definitely different than most conservative Hip-Hop fans are accustomed too. But still creative, maybe we can come up with a new name \\"Heavy-Hop\\" or \\"Dub-Hop\\". I THINK THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF BOTH. Most hh conservatives will rip this as their palate of music is limited. I applaud the courage to expand the genre.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Silver Linings kept my attention from the start of the book to the end. I would definitely read it again. It was a great read!
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This film is very likely the most \\"Gore\\" I've ever seen in even 100 horror films \\"Total\\" combined. Should a horror film have blood? Sure, I guess that's part of the horror....however, this film is what the term \\"over the top\\" was coined for...this is it! If you don't think you can stomach 100,000 gallons of blood...even if it's \\"Movie Blood\\", then you better steer clear of this one. Yes, I did like the original with Bruce Campbell...it had lots of gore as well...I was a younger guy and thought most of that film was hilarious...but something here is \\"painfully different\\". The mutilation of the weekend guest is more than gruesome...nonstop gruesome...I guess this sort of \\"thrill\\" is just not for me any longer. Horror films really don't need this level of blood letting to create horror, but if lots of creative mutilating is of interest to you this film is definitely made for your viewing pleasure! But, be careful...you could be drowned in very deep pools of blood!
B0083Z614S|3.0|It was something different to the normal read, light hearted, easy reading.<br />The subjects were well described in good detail.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|We loved the book, and the general tone of the film when it focuses on The Hobbit itself, is great. However, there are many flashbacks to battles with Orks, and after seeing hundreds of orks die in a scene or two, it's enough. But that was the one drawback. If you like the book, you'll enjoy the movie.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I am fairly new to using apps and having multiple devices. I work in a setting with HIPAA compliant electronic walls and settings. Having my work and personal lists and notes on separate systems was cumbersome. This app on my kindle is portable and works offline at work, and online at home. My kindle fits easily in my purse or briefcase. Liking having everything in one place.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|I am glad that Seth MacFarlane is a victim of arrested development because all the '80s references made this an enjoyable movie for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is like subwaysurfers.  It is a great fun game.<br />You should try this amazing great addictive game. I really Like the game
0307744434|5.0|Well written..thought provoking.<br /><br />One can tell that the author is telling a story that she feels..<br />and she makes we readers enjoy and feel too..
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Actually love the game but the game keeps asking me for more money to buy balls.  I would rather buy the game and not be &#34;nickled and dimed&#34;.
0061438294|5.0|Very easy read and very descriptive. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a board overview of body language.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A decent novella, though sad and brutal at times. It has scenes which would make animal lovers cringe but it seems realistic
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It is amazing to watch these shows in their remastered<br />form.  You feel like what are you seeing is real.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|We love this one for the holidays and occasionally around the year. Great music too. The computerized animation takes a little getting used to but is fine once you do.
B0027Z5DK8|4.0|I happened to be working on my laptop during the movie while my family watched.  About half way through, I put it away.  Good message.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game is really cool because you get to make you very own version of the mlp ponyville and canterlot towns. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there are some really annoying things in it like a pizzeria being 40,000 coin I mean that is seriously  over priced.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Read it for a book club.  We all loved it.  Generated interesting discussion.  Kindle version comes with discussion points at the back and an interview with the author which was revealing.
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|She loves monster high and this is her most favorite now that she has it....She sleeps with it and never sets it down!! She has so much fun with these and owns like 60 of them....haha
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Its a good application, its work well, no problems and very useful.<br />Works like the Droid version or PC one.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate the upgrade.  Map usage is awkward, more pictures and ads than actual weather. Just a hot mess. We should be able to request the upgrade rather than have it auto-delivered.
B00CRMWMZ0|3.0|This is a good album not great but good. I understand they were looking for that human feel and I think they did that but the style of music is of the disco 70s. As much of a fan as I am of that because the temp is basically the same throughout I could only give 3 stars.
B0041KXOVC|5.0|It is a classic for my kids who are now 34 and 31, purchased now for there children.<br />Big family movie night coming up.<br />I loved the show

B00181JGI2|5.0|Cohen Brothers are all over this one. I'm only sorry I didn't find this film when it first came out. The cult following of this film reminds me of some of the films of the 60s. Terrific film in every respect. I just bought it along with a couple of related books. Truly, I am a late bloomer in this Lebowski business, and lovin' it.

B005QI4TP8|5.0|I love this CD, when I first got it I listened to it on repeat probably 15 times. It never gets old! Florence is a beautiful person and her lyrics are deep and poetic. It's so soothing to hear real music that is both instrumentally sound as well as the words being sung. Simply amazing.

B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first when reading the reviews, but I have to say when I first turned this on and bass started to hit in Birth, I knew that I was in for a great ride. This is a fantastic CD, and I definitely would say this is a Tie between A Beautiful Lie as my second favorite CD, with This is War taking the cake. I totally think they nailed it.
B003V9OCIS|5.0|excellent movie, however it does not follow the real story in many aspects which is disappointing. 17 18 19 20

B005MLOKXA|4.0|The program gives an insight into not only politics, but also a bit about courts proceedings.  It also has a main focus on family relationships and how that can affect our personal lives.  It is a good story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was skeptical about this book when I had to read it for my summer reading, I love reading, don't get me wrong. However, reading things assigned from school is always boring. Not this book! It made me laugh, it made me cry (and when i say cry, I mean serious snot-cry haha) the characters were great in this book and I definitely recommend this book to people who love reading. Also, its easy to download for Amazon Kindle!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I didn't think I would like this one as much as the first but I actually enjoyed it more.  You got to meet and get to know a whole cast of characters.  And they meant something.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that enjoys good writing.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The Blu-ray discs arrived quickly, in the exact condition advertised.  There are no extras, like DVD versins ofthe show, but that was to be expected.  Very happy with product.

Backed with research and findings I have often come across in Women's Studies class, she paints a picture of where we are today, what individual women can do to &#34;be the change&#34; we want to see in the world, and why it matters to the world beyond corporate conference rooms.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|====08/14/13 UPDATE; ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW=====<br />I had to contact Amazon customer service via chat to obtain my Netflix incentive code. As best I can tell, it was never emailed to me. I have now successfully applied it to my account.<br />The actual device: Tab casting: I wish somehow, my PC would not have to actually stream the video, too, in order to cast the video to Chromecast...just the streaming related commands. My PC gets really hot when streaming...and does shut down occassionally becasue of this. So, indeed, if you are not using your PC to actually WATCH a video, but only to cast to your real TV, why tax the PC's CPU to stream video, too? There are occassional stutters, too, but they do not happen a lot. Resolution of the casting tab on my TV sometimes degrades, too. This is likely due more to connectivity congestion rather than the device itself.<br />Android tablet app: I have a Samsung Smart TV which has access to all the applications/streaming platforms available in the current app. So, really, except for a bit more convenience as remote control, until more 'channels' or apps are written to provide more content for the app, it really is just 'okay,' redundant to my content available via a Smart TV. It would also be great if tab casting could be available in a chrome browser available on these mobile devices (smart phones and tabs). You cannot currently tab cast on mobile devices.<br />===============================================<br /><br />I'll update once I receive the actual device, but...<br />1. You'll never get 5 stars out of me simply due to how Amazon (and Google) withdrew the Netflix subscription incentive within hours of releasing this product. Sorry people can do basic math Amazon, but this was a no-brainer. Why even offer such an incentive? This was quite a sore point for me in your product launch.<br />2. Amazon was very specific in its time frame regarding those who had access to the Netflix incentive. However, the best a customer can see online is what DATE he purchased, not the time of day, which was critical here as Amazon 'cheapishly' withdrew the offer at 5:31 PT on 7/24. While I do *believe* I nabbed the incentive as I'm in the ET zone and definitely remember ordering during the day, it would be nice for Amazon to list the exact time, since that was critical in this issue.<br />More once the product arrives.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|We (my wife & six kids), had a great evening watching this movie.  Our kids have been talking non stop about how much they loved this movie.  This will become one of the movies that we continue to watch at least yearly.  It's a winner!
B00393SFU2|5.0|What can I say, they don't make movies like this anymore! Suspense without CGI. Peter Lorre is incredible in the courtroom scene.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like the challenges it gives. makes you think a little.. when I get stuck I want to keep trying.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Clear presentation and thoughtful in actions. Setting was real and involved true authentication of environmenatal factors influencing the goals and objectives.
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|I think this was a pretty darn good movie! Of course, it wasn't the greatest movie ever, but it definitely wasn't as bad as many of the negative reviews on Amazon lead you to believe. The acting was very good and most of the action segments were simply outstanding, especially that awesome fight scene on the mountain which was flat-out cool and exciting. I absolutely enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it to anyone who loves action and adventure.

B00AZMFO6I|3.0|QUARTET is set entirely at a \\"Home for Retired Musicians\\" in Britain.  It's a gorgeous old manor (think DOWNTON ABBEY) converted into a charitable home for classical musicians, opera singers, etc.  For not one moment does it seem plausible that this place would really exist...it's so beautiful and spacious and grand.  There are servants everywhere, even though the head of the establishment proclaims the recent \\"staff reductions\\" have really cut back on services.  And the place is full of lovely music all the time, because these retirees just can't stop performing and delighting each other.  It's a nice fantasy world, populated by several well-known (and well-worn) luminaries of the British screen.  I was willing to accept this fanciful setting, but this meant I was immediately set up to see the whole film as a trifle.<br /><br />And it is a trifle.  A gentle, amusing, twinkling and only modestly moving one.  The movie revolves around the annual gala held at the house, geared towards raising enough money to keep the place running one more year.  These old performers dust off their costumes (and their vocal chords), performing to a few wealthy individuals who apparently keep funding this place out of both charity and nostalgia.  Not for one minute is it believable that this one night event, in front of less than 100 people, could for year after year raise enough funding to keep this enormous place going.<br /><br />Anyway, into this friendly atmosphere comes new arrival Maggie Smith, a former MAJOR opera star.  She disrupts those around her, because she brings such a sour mood with her (as only Smith can do).  She meets up with the rest of her former quartet, Pauline Collins (ditsy, forgetful and forgiving), Billy Connelly (a sparkplug who steals all his scenes) and most importantly Tom Courtney, her former husband, who is still nursing some VERY deep resentments.  Courtney is a bundle of hurt, and if this group is to gel again (and headline the gala)...Smith and herex must come to terms.<br /><br />Virtually none of the film is surprising.  You can predict so much of what will happen that it's as though you've seen it before.  In such a case, the film relies heavily on the charms of its stars.  And they do come through.  Connelly, as I said, is terrific.  He flirts continuously with EVERY woman he sees and is just generally the clown of the film, in the best way.  Courtney is tight and reserved and proper.  His performance is a bit one-note...but he's written that way a bit.  Collins is fun and zany.  Michael Gambon makes a puzzling turn as the director of the gala...a thoroughly disagreeable man who dresses just a bit like Dumbledore.  Did Gambon have to bring his old costumes to the filming?<br /><br />Smith, of course, is the main reason to see the movie, and she does a fine job.  She is never less than interesting.  But this role is nearly as fun as what she's done lately in DOWNTON or even in BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL.  She is sad and moody rather than acerbic and funny.  It makes sense that her character would be this way, considering how far she has fallen...but it's not as much fun.  Thus, Smith feels reigned in from the zing we have lately grown accustomed to from her.<br /><br />QUARTET is a perfectly pleasant movie and worth a look, particularly if you like those very gentle British comedies featuring these old stars.  But it travels no new ground and offers no revelations.  The music is GREAT though.

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|In this book we find out what happens when the author falls more in love with his research than his plot. Okay, so we learn a lot about Freemasonry but the action portion of this book could have used a little more attention or at least the endless repetition of mystical fru-fru could have been edited heavily. And if you are waiting for a big payoff here in why the CIA is involved or what and where &#34;the Word&#34; is, well, you'll find out but likely be largely underwhelmed like I was. The best part of this book is the villain in this piece and he is a masterpiece even if the vehicle of his creation is bloated with symbols and more words about the Word than certainly anyone could hope for. Here's hoping next time Brown does this much research, his editor turns the book that results into a novella.

B00CX7TOOG|4.0|The tagline for his moody, atmospheric, harrowing and insightful films is `The purest form of war is one on one' and that generally encircles the mood of the film from beginning to end. Written by Evan Daugherty and directed by Mark Steven Johnson this is a small cast film that concentrates much of the destructive impact of war on those who fight it and survive it. Many people seem to expect more from a film than simply viewing how war eats the brain and memory and after-war life, concentrating responses on actors' accents and implausible encounters, but the message is delivered well if you are open to hear it.<br /><br />KILLING SEASON is the confrontation of two veterans of the Bosnian War, an international armed conflict that took place in Bosnia and Herzegovina between 1 March 1992 and 14 December 1995 and is still remembered for the Bosnian ethnic cleansing campaigns and the violent and terror-inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas endured  murder, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, extra-judicial executions, rape and sexual assaults, confinement of civilian population in ghetto areas, forcible removal, displacement and deportation of civilian population, and deliberate military attacks or threats of attacks on civilians and civilian areas. One veteran is American, Benjamin Ford (Robert De Niro) whose life has become one of being a recluse in the back hills of Appalachia, ignoring his family and struggling with the atrocities he not only witnessed but participated in: the other a Serbian, Emil Kovac (John Travolta) who narrowly escaped assassination by Ford and the American troops and since the war has been hunting for Ford to make him confess his war crimes and suffer the consequences. Ford and Kovac meet surreptitiously at Ford's little cabin, and at first exchange food and drink only to have the reality surface of Kovac's intent to kill Ford. The remainder of the film is a cat-and-mouse game that braces the wills of each survivor in treacherous manners that make each man reopen old war wounds and find a new universality in the effects of war on the human mind.<br /><br />The film is shot in Georgia (cinematography is by Peter Menzies, Jr) with flashback black and white and sepia toned footage of the horrors of the Bosnian War. De Niro and Travolta manage these difficult roles well in this basically two-person film (Ford's son and daughter in law and new baby are adroitly played by Milo Ventimiglia and Elizabeth Olin, and the early scenes in Serbia are polished by performances by Diana Lyubenova, Kalin Sarmenov and Stefan Shterev). The tension is underlined by a fine musical score composed by Christopher Young.<br /><br />This film may not meet everyone's expectations of big noisy extravaganzas, but as a powerful antiwar statement is works exceptionally well.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is a work of fiction set in North Korea, but based on the research of the author.  It was very hard to put down.  The protagonist is compelling, the plot has twists and turns.  The portrait of North Korea, its politics, its society, is horrifying -- nor have a previously read anything about it prior to this book.  I highly recommend it.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Story line was a bit dark, but exciting as well as interesting.  Harry investigates with his usual &#34;bull in a china shop&#34; methods, and as always he gets results!  Not sure I agreed with the Judge, Jury AND Executioner role though.<br />Story had, toughness, cleverness and a bit of compassion, even a tiny bit of love.<br />Good Harry Bosch, but not the best.
B00B5D2V7G|4.0|I just finish the season two and boy it was twisted and great. Sure it have some problems with the story but if you like season one or like very dark story then you will enjoy it. So what didn't I like about this season? Well not to give anything away I really didn't like some of the twisted in the mid-season because it just doesn't feel right. I don't mean that it doesn't make any sense but it just feel a bit too much with too many twisted. Another reason and why I say season one is better then season two is because I really don't feel a since of a \\"wild roller-coaster ride\\" unlike the first season. Still, the dark horror story is still there (I also think this season is way darker than the first), and great characters as well.<br /><br />If you haven't check out season one yet, check it out first. Otherwise, I recommend this for anyone who is a fan of great dark story telling. Check it out!
B00DU74U74|1.0|Really this is a teenage made for TV movie that was stuck on the big screen. IT was a great idea gone terribly WRONG. I sure hope there is someone out there who decides to redo this movie with a real screen writer writing it. I fell asleep on this twice, that is how boring it was. Save your money it will be on Netflix next month.

B002SRQ214|4.0|The processor itself is very good. My only issue with it is, RARELY, it will crash. I'm talking once every 2 months. Not even under load, just randomly. Also, as some of you may know, AMD just overclocks the same chips then sends them out as a higher GHz which is questionable ethics because we can just overclock ourselves, but for someone who doesn't want to overclock this is great.<br /><br />The fan, and heatsink keep the CPU relatively cool, but they are LOUD. It can get up to 4500 RPM gaming and 6000 RPM under full load.<br />Here is the fan for reference : [...]<br /><br />All in all it's the best thing on the market for the price range, so buy it!

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Fun but after a while, a bit repetitious. I takes a while to acrew coins to buy upgrades. There doesn't seem to be much difference between levels of upgrades particularly in tires and suspension and at the cost of each upgrade, it takes a lot, perhaps too much of invested drive-time to earn 'em. That's worth minus 1 star.<br /><br />Other than that, the graphics are good, the physics seem true, and the effort is fun.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is fun and the fact that you are able to find the animals is a great thing! Good choice!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Gotta Love Bruce Willis!  This was a fun movie - great action adventure film with a happy ending:  My favorite!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the fact that it was from both of the main characters view points.  Just didn't like the ending.
B0016CTX68|2.0|I purchased the single track, Gimme Shelter,,  downloaded from Amazon.<br /><br />This recording does not sound so good on my setup. The volume is badly overdriven and the balance is off. The voice is fuzzy and faint.  Does not do the original & my fond memories any justice at all. If I could preview several versions I would probably not choose this one.
0385349947|4.0|Excellent book.  The writer gives a variety of reasons why women find it difficult to reach the top in business.  Not the usual &#34;men are at fault&#34;.  I really recommend this book for both women and men to read.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This series kept me watching throughout. it was suspenseful, exciting and new. Hated to see the series wrap up after 4 seasons. Are there going to be more?
B00932AA5G|4.0|well scripted. worth your time. Real life action with a normal guy who falls into a shit storm. A good &#34; what if&#34; movie. No loose ends.
098357670X|5.0|I've been a caricature artist for many years. I've studied from all the greats. I am a caricature \\"junkie\\" and learn from whatever sources I can get my hands on. Tom Richmond's book, The Mad Art of Caricature is not only the greatest book on how to draw caricatures, it may be the best instructional book, period. Full-color pictures throughout the book highlight Tom's skill and experience. He generously shares his secrets and demonstrates in simple terms his process. If you are a fan of caricature, or an artist yourself, I cannot recommend this book enough.
B004GBIE3Y|3.0|So- so humor but works on a simple, low intensity level. I am guessing the writer had a difficult time dealing with his parents.
B00B2166BS|5.0|This charging device worked as advertised when it arrived and continues to do so.  It charges considerably faster than the cord that came with the Nexus 10.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a cute movie, well made,good action  and funny line to bring a smile. The story line had some a lesson to it.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Follows the same premise of 50 Shades of Gray - the story drags out a bit with no resolution to the character's relationship. Didn't bother to read the third.
193700788X|1.0|I absolutely loved this series but after reading the last book I feel like I wasted money and time. This book had a  very different feel than the other books in the series.  Just because its fiction doesn't mean you should just pull things out of thin air and write them into the story. 12 books all pointing in one direction and you end it in left field and with very little explanation or elaborating on why it ended this way. Just seems like the author lost interest and I should have too!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is one of the top shows on television. When I found this series on Amazon, I watched it all the way through and was looking forward to season three. The writing, acting, and character development are excellent.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|What can you say about an alarm clock? It works. But, I don't use it often  and how can you say you &#34;love&#34; an alarm clock. It works-that's all.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I enjoyed this movie greatly. A good movie is one you can watch and lose track of time. For example, I saw Life of Pi and kept wondering how much longer the movie will go on. This movie was entertaining enough that I never wondered how much longer it would be.<br /><br />Yes, it departs a lot from the original Star Trek. And that is a very good thing. It is not as cheesy, but it still at times is. While the story is entertaining, the encounter with the Klingons was lame. It was clearly thrown in because somebody thought it had to have Klingons and had to see people speaking Klingon. Speaking of which, why is it only the Klingons have a unique language? The Klingon encounter was out of place.<br /><br />The movie by its very nature is predictable. It cannot help it. Normally I hate predictable movies, such as Avatar. But because it is a remake and because it had Khan in it, we already know what was going to happen. This movie was predictable only because I knew the story of Khan.<br /><br />My final gripe is the appearance by Leonard Nimoy in this movie. Give it up already. It is not Leonard's fault, it is the fault of the writers.<br /><br />What I like about the story is how Kirk makes Spock realize there are some rules that you must break. It starts at the beginning when Spock does not break a rule and it gets Kirk in trouble. But as the story advances, Spock begins to understand. I like how the roles were reversed for Spock and Kirk in the original Star Trek 2 movie: Kirk takes the radiation poison instead of Spock and Spock yells \\"KHANNNNNNNN!\\" instead of Kirk. I like how the story behind Khan was modified to make much of the story unique.<br /><br />I generally enjoyed this movie. It was worth seeing in the movie theater. I would give it a B+ rating.
B008M87GJK|3.0|I use this app occasionally but prefer to read my digital news off my laptop.  If you like news on the tablet the BBC is very good news.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love this game. The dresses are the cutest things in the world. The makeup is  fantastic and there are so many combinations.  The jewerly is so adorable.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|As there's hardly any 'comedy' involved, and mostly two kinda skeezy folks. Three if you count Hudson's character.<br /><br />I was underwhelmed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|2 words pure awesomeness 1 more thing Ender portal I want temples and villages<br />AND PLEASE ADD redstone<br /> And mods and skins butter butter butter
B0012TWRAO|1.0|The  ball fits great on the motorcycle.... too bad the rest of the mount didn't function as advertised.  Not much good without the mount working properly.
B003U69IX6|4.0|My ten year old recommended this so I was skeptical; it was actually pretty decent, especially if your into mythology...
B001ER4CNY|5.0|Since they seem to be so much more affordable lately this is an amazing deal. I love the packaging, even though it is a tad flimsy. The box of trivia cards are a nice touch. Great quality so far.
0553288105|4.0|As always, Asimov's writing is smooth, especially his heavy dialogue. This isn't really a \\"novel\\" so much as it's three very different stories that all connect (a little loosely in my opinion) to each other. I still don't consider myself a fan of \\"hard\\" sci-fi. Once in a while, I really get in the mood for something completely out of this world (pardon the pun), but certainly couldn't read sci-fi constantly.<br /><br />The first section was my least favorite. As I said above, too much hard sci-fi isn not something I really look for. This section contained the most science out of the three in my opinion, and though it wasn't my favorite section, real sci-fi buffs will probably love it. My grade is 3/5<br /><br />The second section is by far the most imagintive. It takes place on a completely imaginary planet, with all types of un-Asimov-like things happening, such as \\"melting\\" and so on. A good section of the book, though I felt it didn't need to be as long as it was. 3.5/5<br /><br />The last section was my favorite, simply because it was the most enjoyable part to read. It takes place on the moon, contains many unique ideas, and in my opinion has the best main characters of the book. There's also romance mixed in with the science fiction, and Asimov's excellent dialogue is on display most here. A lot of fun was this section, the only thing that kept it from being truly great was the hasty climax. 4.5/5<br /><br />Overall, the book wasn't quite up to my expectations, but is easily a worthy read for sci-fi and Asimov fans. Again, it's more three stories, each very different from the other two, that connects on a central issue. This is the first book aside from the Foundation Series that I've read from Asimov, though the structure of this book is similar to his classic trilogy. Overall, a mostly fun read with some good ideas, not to mention the romance/love aspect that I've not found in Asimov before. Good book.
B005T87QCI|3.0|I Loved The Movie And This Game Is Pretty Fun But The Devs Charge You For EVERYTHING! You Could Spend 20 Bucks On This If You Tried To Unlock Everything. Even The Create A Boxer Mode Costs An Extra 99 Cents On Top Of The 99 Cents The Game Already Costs. For That Reason I Can Only Give This Game 3 Stars.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|If you like Tetris you'll love Call of Atlantis. I've been hooked since the first time I played. Even got family members hooked.
B000XUBF3I|5.0|This seems like the perfect organizational plan for me! I felt like this book was written exclusively for me. I can't wait to get started and keep my home clean and clutter free for good!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a totally awesome fantastic game it is a mix of temple run and subway surfers I love minion rush
B003U51D58|5.0|Loved the entire season. VERY VERY ADDICTIVE!!! Must watch. Although I don't like the min words requirement that amazon has put on writing reviews. Annoying.
B005ELZKWS|5.0|Sammy and the band hit a homerun with this one, its a great listen. I really like the first Chickenfoot CD but a lot of the music sounded the same, don't get wrong the music was very good.this CD is so much better than the first one, some of the songs sounded like VanHagar which I liked I hope they continue to make more great music.if you like Sammy Hagar its a must have
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Yet another good game by the publisher. The pricing is decent as well as the length of the game. I hate the cliff hangers though lol. I look forward to playing more of these puzzle games by the publisher.
1612680011|5.0|Great, especially for real estate agents. However, it is mind opening for everyone, and gives elemental tips how to handle money.
B00BR0SGN0|3.0|I greatly anticipated this CD, pre-ordered as early as I possibly could.  I had hoped for an epic return of purple though I had not expected it.  This is a fine album.  An Amazon 3 star album, meaning it is O.K.<br /><br />Before I make any die hard Purple fans angry, I have been a Deep Purple fan since 1971.  I always will be.  This is an acceptable continuation of a solid rock band, it just is not what I was hoping for.  Deep Purple, for me, will always be, Blackmore, Lord, Gillian, Glover and Paice.  Steve Morse is a phenomenal guitarist.  All due respect to him.  Don Airey is also exceptional.  This, while acceptable, is not IMO, a long awaited epic return.<br /><br />I was not going to do a review of this thinking I was expecting too much.  Then Black Sabbath released 13.  That was the epic return I had hoped this would be.  I am not comparing 1 to the other, mind you, I am making the point, DP's release here missed the mark for me.  Yes hints of Fireball, In Rock, Machine Head are there.  Yes, there are some good riffs.  But there are no outstanding memorable songs.  Nothing like \\"Ted the Mechanic\\", \\"Any Fule No That\\" or \\"She Was\\".  I wasn't expecting \\"Smoke\\" or \\"Speedking\\" or \\"Child In Time\\" or so on, I was, however, wishing for...  The best here offered are solid, like Apres Vous and Out of Hand, and they do come close.  Maybe a couple more.<br /><br />I truly believe they had the perfect formula for the present line up with Purpendicular (hands down best DP since the addition of Morse) and Abandon.  That formula would have worked well here.  The attempt here, to blend an earlier vibe with the new while not letting Morse loose just fell short.  Not that there isn't amazing guitar because there is, but it seems as if he was put on the back burner in favor of ample keyboard work.  Airey is fantastic and plays in a similar style to Lord, and plenty of keyboard is also good, but the balance between keys and guitar isn't there.  Had there been the addition of thesignature dueling keys and guitar mixed with the more modern sound of the later releases, that could have been phenomenal.<br /><br />Perhaps I expected too much.  This is my honest opinion.  Is this worth owning?  Yes.  Fans of the later few albums will likely be more pleased than I am.  This just fell short for me, hopefully not for you.  Have a good one.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Holds up just as classically as the original/The Evil Dead 2.  Feels like Raimi, without being raimi.  Slightly campy. Entirely creepy.  Plenty of gore.  So much so, that I was a little uncomfortable, which is saying something.<br /><br />If the original movies never came out, and this one had been the first in the series; this would be an all-time classic.<br />I look forward to Army of Darkness 2.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It took a while to get into the story, then there was an interesting twist, but from then on, it was pretty &#34;predictable&#34;. I didn't like the end of the book at all.
0385349947|5.0|I saw my own mannerisms defined in the book, which startled me.  I have learned over the years to lean in, but still needed to adjust myself to totally lean in and sit at the table.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thanks  for letting me love this series all over again.  I love the authenticity of the era, the costumes and sets.  I especially like the actor Brendan Coyle, and actress Maggie Smith.  Looking forward to season 4.
B005EXA8LY|5.0|Excellent composition, recording and performances by all of Steve Wilson's compadres. Video interpretations are edgy and profound. 5 Stars. Buy it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game!!! I'm very much addicted I play it all through out the day wish it did not take so much coin to do some of the things but that the only bad drawback ive seen I will keep playing. FINALLY A FREE GAME THAT IS FUN!!!!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|What a great story.  Characters were expertly woven together over the decades covered in this story.  I will read it again!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|I love every song. Listen to the cd on my way to and from work. I strongly recommend this cd all the tracks are excellent
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Having recently viewed this performers X Factor Uk experience, I could not wait to get my hands on this cd.  Her songs are from her life experiences and they are a reflection of the person that Rebecca is. Her voice is instantly recognisable, classy and songs well written. Love  ALL the songs on the cd, which is hard to say for even the most accomplished artists. I am consuming the cd on songs Shoulder to Shoulder, Teach Me How To Be Loved and the more up tempo Backtrack. Cannot wait for her next work to be released hopefully soon! Love it!
B0080SW3CC|5.0|The quality and shipment of the book was excellent, yet, the book was purchased for my daughter's English class<br />And she stated that the content of the book was boring. I wouldn't trust a teens review on the book, because my<br />Teen thinks everything is boring.

B005LAIH2C|5.0|This one was very good. We really enjoyed it!  I've watched it twice myself. A different take on the story, and was very enjoyable!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Arduous, simply because of the absence of some favorites, but I get why it made sense to split books 4 & 5 by character and location rather than do half of ALL characters & locations.

B00271HAK8|5.0|Loved it when it came out and still makes me laugh when watching with my kids. Suddenly my kids understand my jokes. I didn't realize that John Hughes was almost entirely responsible for my sense of humor.
B00CFA222M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  My young son has already watched it 3 times. So he really enjoyed it also.  It fits into the type of movies I enjoy. A great family movie!

B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Surprisingly good for a recent Le Carre book. The usual beautiful prose combined with suspense and a believable plot. I miss Smiley though!<br />A great read
B00C061I3K|3.0|I've always liked the energy of Daft Punk and was pretty disappointed with this new album. It has a few good tracks, pretty much the ones everyone has heard on the radio and elsewhere. Too much of this new stuff is slow and etherial. Not a fan. Plus, I always put Daft Punk on my iPod to run to. This new album isn't good for that at all. Meh.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book kept me glued to the pages. Couldn't stop reading it and finished it in a month. I love the character transitions and depth of the story . I will not spoil it by naming names or retelling events. Just read on and enjoy the journey of your favorite characters and where they end up. The story is raw and real and that's what I love about it. It is no fantasy. Having read a lot of medieval history, is feels very true to events that were happening during that time period. It is a also a study in human nature. It's not black and white good vs evil type fantasy. There's a lot of gray involved in the characters some which evolve and show many sides due to harsh conditions and need for survival in this cruel world. Sound familiar right? Reading on.
B004SIP7QC|5.0|I wish there was a rating above 5 stars for movies like this.<br /><br />If you are not touched by FINDING NEVERLAND then have someone check to see if you have a pulse.
B0035WTJFW|2.0|The picture quality is not blu ray. More like VHS. The movie is very good, but the blu ray quality is lacking.

B00BXI26XC|5.0|I was brought up in a rural area, and my dad and I would watch planes go over and wonder where they were going to. This app is really cool, now I live closer to the airport then I did in my youth. Can watch them and identify them as they go over, and can tell you it's really accurate.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Never thought I would enjoy a zombie book, but World War Z definitely changed my mind!  I would highly recommend it
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Very good Bejewelled-type game with varying obstacles and strategies at each level. Decent graphics. You can skip through the 80 Days story if you wish.<br /><br />I have played this over and over for the last four months; very addictive and you can challenge yourself to improve with each game.<br /><br />The music was monotonous - I keep it shut off. I leave the sound effects on as they enhance the game play and are not obnoxious.
B00CATSONE|4.0|I was wondering why this short book started with a digression into IQ. It was made clear at the end that creativity is fed by information from many sources. When you combine things together, new ideas then will form. The author, in particular, attempted to show that is what Tesla did and I think he successfully did it. Presumably, this is so that you can unleash creativity in yourself.

B00AAZOKS8|5.0|I got this book after reading my granddaughter Moo, Baa, La La La because my granddaughter loved that book so much. This story is a fun story. My granddaughter loves hearing it read over and over. We have several Sandra Boynton books. The illustrations are so colorful.
B006S08RLU|5.0|First of all, I watched the movie before reading any reviews and expected to turn it off before a few minutes as I do with some other films (as many have violence and nudity throughout which I personally feel is unnecessary--and the movie will go off followed by my sad review).  This movie however,  with  humor and depth,  had me watching it several times to attempt to figure it out.  Until I just read Bernard's review,  I had no idea what lied behind the translation.  It's time I took up the French language.  Knowing a list of vocabulary words is not enough for me anymore.  I can almost relate to the protagonist--being an only daughter of elderly parents--and figuring life out in my own 'creative' ways.  I would highly recommend this amusing comedy.  Just to clarify, this is not a 'nudity free' production; however, the flashes of such scenes that she has in her mind are fleeting thoughts and created 'humorously' which add to the movie's humor, yet I definitely could live without and still see this as an awesome production.
B00AAZSH0U|5.0|This story is so much fun. My daughter has it memorized and tells the story even if she can't see the pages. My granddaughter loves hearing it read over and over. We have several Sandra Boynton books.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Well I received the item and I was happy with it. The condition was just as stated coupled with great response makes them a top top store!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Heartwarming and real.  Reading this will equate to hours of therapy! Somewhere in the words everyone will find some truth or meaning for themselves.  Beautifully and lyrically written .. Linger over reading it, it is about the journey, not the destination.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|It's an excellent book. It's one of my favorites! I definitely recommend it! I went straight to the second book, which was just as good! I cannot wait for the third!!

B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I'd wanted to see this because of the interesting and all too possible storyline. The bulk of the film is great. Good story/plot, good acting, etc... Trying to figure out *whodunit* throughout the film-as suspicion flips several times. But I must say-the ending was disappointing. I won't spoil it, but...there were several ways they could have played out the story....and they chose the route of the predictable, over-used, mass-appeal eroticized, classic double-cross. They COULD have used this film to trailblaze a new genre of modern (real life scenario) medical drama/suspense/mystery. To make a long story short-95% of the film was awesome....and then a disappointing ending. But-most people ENJOY the predictable mass-appeal movie ending.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|It's a pretty fun game although the push for using real money can get  a little more annoying than most games. My son and I both enjoy playing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the app. It offers help if you want it, and I like the option to choose a winning hand.
140006922X|5.0|Here's a video of a Fox news host interviewing the author. Watch as he responds to her questions like she is a stubborn child and her inability to understand the most basic of explanations.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The American Republican/Christian right is a western version of the Taliban. Many of their followers are posting one star comments here. Fact is that this is a well written, well researched, highly documented readable academic work.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. One moment I would be laughing out loud. The next moment would bring tears to my eyes. Christine McKenna has that rare gift of story telling that made me want to prolong the book. And a lot of the phrases reminded me of things my mother and aunts would say. Definitely worth the read.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|this is a great app it allows you to store everything you need onto it you can signin to your account from any device and use it

0345529057|5.0|This series is full of surprises unexpected events and interesting characters.  I like the way the chapters are divided into character headings.  Descriptive language and character development is definitely there.  It is hard to put it down.  You just want to keep going from one book to the next.  I wish the last book was included in this set.
B007THA4FI|5.0|As a huge Harry Potter fan, I had no idea what to expect from this book, especially after the mixed reviews. But I loved it! I think many who didn't like it expected it to be like HP, but what a wonderful surprise to see how talented Ms. Rowling is that she can produce something totally different, but also excellent. Anyone who has ever lived in a small town anywhere in the world will be able to relate to the goings-on in this story. So put aside any preconceived ideas of what Ms. Rowling &#34;should&#34; write, and enjoy this nuanced story and all-too-recognizable characters.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Loved the style in which it was written.  The story for me, was very captivating.  Read twice to capture all the nuances.
1781162646|5.0|I am not a big horror fan, but I do enjoy Stephen King's less gory work and this is one of the best. I loved this story, it took me right back to my own summer job on the beach. If you think you won't like it because it'll be scary, give it a chance, it's really a sweet coming-of-age story with a little mystery thrown in for fun.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|Very interesting ebook.it was the world's best selling book series to my taste if you are looking for a new book series.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Couldn't put this book down. Read it in one day.  Hated how it ended left hanging and having to wait for the next book which will probably be another year.  That really makes not want to read anything else Archer writes.
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|I literally couldn't put it down. It isn't that Anthony Ryan has written something particularly unique, it's that he's set out to achieve something, and has done it brilliantly. A great book for fans of dark fantasy fiction. There were a few formatting issues that irked me (typos etc.)
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I enjoy this series immensely ! I was diappointed to hear it is coming to an end with season Four.
B005LAII94|1.0|Murder, marijuana trafficking, bloody shootings, sadistic torture, point-blank executions, gratuitous graphic sex and enough sleaze to fill a pig trough are the hallmarks of Oliver Stone's \\"Savages.\\" The last dud that Oliver Stone turned out was the sequel to \\"Wall Street.\\"  Inert as that was, and it was almost embarrassingly bad, this go-round is truly awful, filled with gratuitous violence, torture, sex, a mediocre script and a ridiculous story line. This film reeks of sleaze and body odor.  Once upon a time there were a pair of sleazy, grungy, tattooed, sweaty, distinctly unappetizing guys (Taylor Kitsch (aptly named) as \\"Chon,\\" and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as \\"Ben\\"), who lived in a gorgeous beach house in Southern California with their blonde paramour (\\"O\\" played by Blake Lively), while cultivating marijuana in a gigantic state-of-the-art warehouse under optimal conditions, such that THEIR marijuana was thirty percent stronger than Mexican pot.  Yeah, right.  Along came a mean old Mexican drug cartel, with Benecio Del Toro as their vicious henchman, trying to co-opt them and muscle in on their business.  When they wouldn't capitulate, the meanies kidnapped their sweetie.  What follows is two hours of seedy violence, complete with Skyping back and forth between the \\"good\\" guys and the cartel, including scenes of brutal torture and endless grunge. It's about as lowlife as you can imagine, with a bad script, mediocre acting by the leads, and Salma Hayek as a nasty drug overlord bossing the Del Toro character around.  The plot is like Swiss cheese it has so many holes in it.  I wonder if Mr. Stone has children, and I wonder if he has ever given thought to the fact that producing violent garbage like this only contributes to more shootings and violence in the real world.  It's also very disturbing that Universal Studios would release a film that is so morally debased and reprehensible.  Equally surprising is the presence of John Travolta, who stumbles through his role as a government agent playing both sides of the street, and Benecio Del Toro, who can't possibly be so desperate that he would stoop to portraying this kind of garbage. After subjecting yourself to this movie, you feel an immediate urger to shower, so you can wash all the filth off.  God help the film industry.a government agent playing both sides of the street, and Benecio Del Toro, who can't possibly be so desperate that he would stoop to portraying this kind of garbage.

B006O5XYWG|5.0|I watched it 3 times because what they can due with computers now, you will swear that the Apes are real.  I love the character  of Caesar when he was an infant chimp.  They gave Babe an Academy Award for best picture.  This should have been nominated.
0399229191|5.0|A good choice for reading to baby who will love it as a toddler and a preschooler.  I have given this book as a gift several times.
B008A36R2Y|5.0|I bought this so I could create a macro keyboard (this board appears as a HID to the computer it is attached to). Had it up and running within an hour. Especially liked the dedicated SCL and SDA pins. One thing to be careful of is resetting the board, will result in a new com port assignment - making loading a sketch a little more difficult until you get used to this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a game you have to get it is so much fun and it gives you something to do that doesn't get old in the first five minutes and it has some really great costumes.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Somehow I missed this series for over a decade. Wheaton fans will recognize the archetypes and themes from his other work. Engossing!
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I've read and watched this many times, but it's such a classic that I will continue to read and watch it. Thanks.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Just enough challenge to keep it fun...I liked playing it while taking little breaks from my gardening..kept me engaged and thinking
B000JQU1VS|4.0|This is great; I'm a Sherlock Holmes fan from way back, so it's great having them on Kindle to read whenever I want.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This was a really good movie a must see for anyone who likes a scary movie, this is not the story I read as a kid, but it is definetly a good movie to see now.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I watched off and on during a flight.  Drew me in enough to watch the whole way through.  Very good story line.  Lots of action.  Not what I expected.  I am going to start reading the books.
B00BLF9FOK|5.0|This was a good movie I gave it 4 stars, I love anything with Arnold S. he's such a good actor I hope he continues making good movies for all of us to enjoy.
B00499QUK2|5.0|Benedict was superb as Khan in star trek ( into darkness ) and is a great Holmes. And the Hobbit as Watson is really cool.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Having read other books about the afterlife, I was expecting more.. it left me dangling and<br />not sure as to what he meant here.. confusing at times and not clear at all.<br />Frustrated me more than anything.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This would never get a 5 star from me but only because it is about such a horrifying subject...teenage suicide.  I do like Jodi Picoult and think she is an excellent writer.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this app is great in terms of graphics and options. however,  jewels are hard to earn and the price of many items are several jewels.
B003PBB4ME|1.0|I got one of these and was very disappointed. Feels like very cheaply constructed plastic. looks like the base is metal, but its just cheap plastic. Totally worthless junk. I wouldn't trust it for use with my camera ever. It's a decent concept if it was metal or at least carbon fiber plastic. It was a waste of money.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Since her grammy winner prior to this release, I have made a quest to acquire a lot more of her discs. The ones produced by Prince are awesome, but &#34;Time waits for no one&#34; is out of print and very pricey.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Earth's Mightiest Heroes, for Marvel, have a great film debut! Good story, good special effects, and a great cast make this a terrific superhero outing!
B001PTG4BO|4.0|A friend sent me an email about this and I was skeptical..What could this book tell me about business that I didn't know already? The book was written so that the average seller of anything could apply it to their business. I am a bookseller and often I get a lot of items that are ravaged by the penny sellers. It helped me understand that selling fewer items that are worth more is SO MUCH BETTER then selling a lot of cheap books for a penny.I didn't think I would \\"have the time\\" to read it because I was so busy with everything else. But I made the time to read it and it helped me get control of my business and they way I had always thought of more being better. Nowadays we look for quality over quantity and have adapted our policies in customer service to reflect our new business model.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This is the best series of Batman films since Tim Burton's vision. This is truly the Dark Knight in most respects. Definitely a  good series to watch while we wait for the next Batman installment!
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|As a fan of the old one I was skeptical with watching this. I see differences in this one to the next, but I see a lot of the holes that were in the older series in this one.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie is definitely for the elder couples who have been together awhile who can relate to this couples issues. Both characters make the movie even more hilarious. Would I recommend this? Yes. Because the issues that are discussed in this movie are life's struggles in relationships.
0553386794|2.0|I can't finish this. I understand that this was a violent time period, but this book/series just turns my stomach. I've tried to read it twice now, and I just can't get any farther with it. Every time I pick it up, it leaves me feeling sick.<br /><br />With the reviews I keep reading online about the TV series that's based on the books, I don't think the story line gets any better either.<br /><br />What I disliked most about the entire series is that there is no main character for you to follow. You start to like someone, and the author kills them off. So many of the characters have twisted personalities, too. Aren't there any \\"good\\" people in this book?<br /><br />This is not my idea of a good read.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I enjoy this era of time because it showed how much they really need all of the staff to manage their every whim. They never said how much they got paid, the maids and butlers were all neat as a pin. That I'm sure it was for status.  Well put together.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the size of the calculater. It fits my needs when I have to make a quick calculation. Having it on my kindle is handy, too!
B004G606K8|2.0|Too simple and too shallow in description to be a good read. Though the book may entertain you, it is not a great one.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|This is a good app. This App. requires the feedback of daily drivers to be accurate. The more people that report travel/road conditions the easier your trip navigation will be. Reports of current Police locations (speed Traps) are a nice option.
1616614609|1.0|thought it sounded fun to play the corporation vs the runner but it didn't end up to be interesting at all.  buy dominion.
1446249182|5.0|I have taken many stats courses, but still use this as a desk reference anytime I am interpreting and writing up results for school projects or manuscripts. I highly recommend this for anyone that uses SPSS. Check out Andy Field's instructional videos on youtube too!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Great book, great story and really made me get up and get running again. There are very few books that I'd be dying to get back to reading it during the day, but this was one. Great book.
B0008ENICU|5.0|The women is a classic movie of all times and Norma Shearer  and Joan Crawford and the rest of the star cast are just awsome and this too is a movie worth owning on DVD.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Renderings are great and make for a totally enjoyable 3D experience. This movie sets a high bar for 3D competition.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|Though the opening scenes were a bit confusing and I didn't feel like they tied them to the rest of movie, the movie is definitely worth watching.<br />Good acting and special effects.
B004PHE9F6|5.0|Always wanted to see this movie and finally did !!! I really liked all the information about how the movie was made.
B000J233SK|5.0|Her music is enchanting! Her voice is so beautiful!  CD was in excellent condition. One of the songs is being used in school for a poetry unit.
B000ERU9S2|5.0|Another good  movie with great actors. I love the story and how they keep you in suspense. Definately a classic.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Excellent voice and rhythm just pulls you in.  I'm using one of the songs in a poetry unit for school.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Unique writing style. It was a fun, highly addictive adventure through the Zombie Apocalypse as told by a number of different survivors.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Loved this book, quirky and engaging - so nice to read something light and easy to read yet unusual and with thought provoking themes. I found the main characters very endearing and parts of the book made me laugh out loud.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so awesome I just want to play it all day<br />And I love when they change the levels every few days so I can buy a bunch of new boards and characters
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|Fun game. I like trying to beat the clock but can also keep going if you don't make it. Looking forward to finding out how it changes.
B002ZIAC4E|5.0|very good lp on heavyweight vinyl and the gatefold is really thick card with beautiful artwork. Definitely one of the best  i have bought
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|Evil dead was a great horror movie, I'm not usually one to watch horror because of the blood and gore, and this movie has plenty of that! I still found it to be entertaining
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|Beautiful version of the Cinderella story. This movie had everything I love. Comedy, romance, and redemption. I could watch this over and over again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|fun and entertaining. great way to kill time.i like the different areas such as residential or the bad guys lair. makes it more interesting than games like temple run which used to be my other favorite game.
B005LAII80|5.0|I have been a fan of the character and stories of Judge Dredd, going back to his first appearance in 2000AD more years ago than I care to remember.  Like many fans the travesty which was 1995's Stallone Judge Dredd movie made me stay home and not watch this in theaters.  I really regret that.  I loved this movie when I finally got round to catching it on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This is a very good, low-budget sci-fi action movie even if you don't already know the character.  But more than that it showed great potential in portraying the future dystopia that is Mega-City One.  It would be cinematic missed opportunity to not explore that more.  Urban really understood the role and was a brilliant Judge Dredd.  I sincerely hope we can see more of that.<br /><br />Cinematically stunning, atmospherically claustrophobic and paced very well.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that the brand was so tainted by the first Hollywood cash-in that this didn't make its budget back at the cinema, but I have hope that if we show our appreciation by getting the DVD/Blu-Ray and keeping the buzz going, we have a chance to see a sequel, and that will be something very much worth watching.<br /><br />I recommend this highly.
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I love buying videos for my granddaughter and this one she did not have.  My husband and I loved the video.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I ended up paying for each and every show , couldn't stop myself. my naughty little habit. I cant wait till new season starts in october
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great follow up to the first book. Kept me coming back for more. Can't wait to read book three
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|All I have to say after the final episode is Damnnnnnnnnn. My new goal in life is a kiss like that!!!!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|We have been researching this  Chromecast item for the last couple of days, it's funny how the same reviews are on all the sites that sell it. Saying its so great, Bestbuy, and Amazon need to be better gate keepers of reviews
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game. Interesting enough to keep me occupied but not so hard that I can't figure it out.<br />Hope they come up with more rooms to add on.
B008MM9630|5.0|It is fun and time consuming. Great twist to the farm type games. I like that you do not have to purchase items to advance.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|It is nice to have a good film that is funny and shows the good and bad in people through cartoon characters.<br />A good family film.  Looking forward to seeing the next one of these.
B00CATSONE|5.0|One of the greatest books I've read that will inspire me for years.  I've been an admirer of Tesla for years.  It is a must read for anyone seeking encouragement or confidence in following bone's dreams and aspiration.
B009X2CUYA|4.0|Another fascinating book by Kate Morton. Her stories are excellent with many twists and turns. This is the third book I have read of hers and thoroughly enjoyed.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Upon doing the first \\"experiment\\" ... I had asked the universe to send a gift. Any gift, nothing specific- but something awesome... and I got it. Within the guidelines set, right on time... and I was completely amazed. What did I manifest? I had won a contest and had gotten a cooking lesson and great gourmet meal by a local and nationally known Chef. AMAZING. The book is awesome, check it out. - Tara Malouf
B002BWCJOA|5.0|A fun movie for all ages. Thankful for the ease of purrchase through Amazon. The streaming video options and ease of accessibility makes a perfect combination.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|It's little wonder that this has been a successful series. I couldn't put  it down and found it very immersive. I highly recommend anyone reading this and seeing where Jack's story begins.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|This show just keeps getting better and better. But what a cliff hanging ending. I can't wait for the next season
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A friend told me about the books after the first season of game of thrones on hbo. I started reading and couldnt put it down. Also got a dance with dragons. Havent started it yet, but I am looking forward to continuing the reading that has put my imagination in a whole new world.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game, I play it everyday on my Samsung phone.  The graphics fit the screen perfectly.  Most game graphics are either too large or tiny hard for aging eyes to see.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|easy to use, portable, videos help. should be a big help with Bible study. like the notes capabilities can't say much for the registration process
B008MM9630|5.0|It is a cute game and easy to collect jewels and money. Kind of reminds me of farmville just with fairies.
B007IWG3WC|4.0|Pretty good movie for an old movie i like the setting although im pretty sure sharks cant head butt titanium doors mutant fish or not
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Following the stargate story in another direction, I enjoyed this opening episode.  Am going to watch the rest over time......
B004XISI4A|4.0|Spoiler-free. I can't now nor ever fault George RR Martin's simple but evocative writing, but after the slight deflation of reading A Feast for Crows, this book feels almost unforgiveable for making it seem like things might actually happen. It's like that quote from A Storm of Swords: `Every now and again, Lord Twin Lannister would actually threaten to smile; he never did, but the threat alone was terrible to behold' (or words in that vein). This book is like that: every now and then, A Dance with Dragons threatens the reader with something actually happening; it never does, but the threat of it is enough to keep you going - only to be let down in the end.<br /><br />On the positive side, this has built an immeasurable anticipation in me for The Winds of Winter, but again, after the plodding feel of A Feast for Crows, I would have really loved a few fist pumping moments from this one.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Rollins is one of my favorites.  Keeps me turning pages and sad to reach the end.  Makes me think.  Loved It
B008476HBM|5.0|I recently reread this and have no idea why it seemed like such an effort the first time around in high school. I think I'd become too used to Stephen King's understated efficiency, but have on my second read of this over ten year later come to appreciate this as representing its own brand of understated, stylish, and evocative efficiency.<br /><br />Having read some books relatively contemporary to this one since, it's not unthinkable to imagine that it's impact may have had as much to do with its themes and characters as it did with its easy, flowing style. In hindsight, it may have just been the rapid introduction of so many characters that had overloaded by likely-strained senior year perceptions at the time, but all that was smoothed and established second time around, meaning I could focus totally on that stylish flow and quickly efficient wit.<br /><br />There's really no point recommending this book 200 years after its publication: you wouldn't be reading this at all if time's verdict hadn't already been given.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|This soundtrack is wonderful.  The sound quality is excellent and the soundtrack contains not only the highlights but the entire soundtrack.  I would definitely purchase this soundtrack over the shorter soundtrack containing only highlights.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Not perfect but better than some pay ones. I play it a lot decent options also. Overall its worth the 1 sec download.
B003B02O0A|4.0|The movie was great, but I saw the movie before reading the book.  The book is fine, of course, but I kept thinking how the movie went along while reading the book--something was lacking in the book, I thought...but again, I probably would have rated the book higher if I hadn't seen the movie.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|It is a quality production.  However, it is too far off the charts from reality.  I realize some of the premises could and do happen in real life, but not so blatantly or abundantly.  I was not impressed.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I do not mind fiction but for me it has to have some semblance to reality.  For me it read more like a fairytale.<br />My opinion, for what it is worth!!!!
0525425764|2.0|I'm sorry, but I just couldn't wrap my mind around a thirteen year old kid trying to play detective and lawyer. After reading many of Mr. Grisham's other novels, I found it hard to believe that he actually wrote this. Oh well, we all have bad days.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|I liked the old movie and this remake was incredible. This is a movie I could watch again and again.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I'm an NFC noob, so I haven't really done a lot with these yet. Just from handling them and tinkering around a little bit, I can tell that they seem to be pretty high quality. I have used them with my Samsung/Google Nexus S, which is the only NFC enabled device I have. I intend to get either a Galaxy S4 Active or Nexus 5 or something similar whenever they're released. I don't understand much about the various NFC standards or any possible incompatibilities, but so far these tags work for me and my device. I've used &#34;NFC ReTag Free&#34; to write one tag to add my home network's SSID and password to their phone. I'm also tinkering with a car-mode tag, but haven't yet decided exactly what I want it to do so I haven't written the data to the tag yet.<br /><br /> I'm considering sticking one of them to my dog's collar, but haven't x-rayed one yet to see if it's okay to drill (yes, I am an x-ray service engineer so I can x-ray all my new gadgets - definitely a fun perk!).<br /><br />Anyways, for a total of 12 tags (10 plus 1 free, plus the keychain) for $10 - $15, it seems to be quite a bargain. When I added these to my wishlist, they were $15 or so. I waited until the price dropped to $10 and ordered them.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|pretty cool movie. Didn't get the nightmare I was expecting that night. Could have included more history within the story.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Enough words have been said on this novel already.  I bought it only because Amazon recommended when I finished another book.  I was skeptical after reading the story line but gave it a shot and found myself eager to get back to it every night.  Excellent story, rich characters, and rich environmental description.  The author did a fantastic job putting you in every scene.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|Recently took this canyoneering in southern Utah and it was perfect. I bought the full Canon backpack on Amazon last year but knowing I also needed to carry water and extra clothing, it was too large to travel. This case fit my Canon 60D (18-135mm lens), 3 batteries and media cards easily and kept them free from dust and moisture. There's even room for more! It performed well over the rocks and dirt for several hours. This is great for daily travel if you don't want to lug your full pack around and the hard plastic bottom keeps the case sturdy and balanced. Remember to bring a lens cleaning cloth with you for in the field issues. Don't overpay for name brand cases. AmazonBasics makes quality products that I'd recommend any day of the week.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this will help the time pass when you are waiting for a mode. of transportation.  and the kids love to play this clean game.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Just like the ones that come with the console.  My old one was not working anymore so this is awesome!
1451624468|5.0|I'm absolutely enthralled with this book. Not only am I being mentally stimulated more than I've EVER been, I'm learning things that have been fact in science for a long, long time and I've never been told.<br />I have a feeling that those who are giving the one star reviews either didn't make it all the way through or just don't understand the science. To them I say Google works wonders...and you can always just ASK a scientist.<br />Krauss is enthusiastic about his work and does a wonderful job of explaining things to the rest of us luddites who don't have a background in cosmology or a PhD.<br />Excellent book--would read again and highly recommend for others to read. You should read this just to learn and to further understand the incredibly complex universe in which we live.
B004UJTG6Q|3.0|Not sure if I will finish it.  It's a classic that I have never read, and it was free, so thought I'd give it a go.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|And to be honest... I haven't watched it yet.  But gaging on season 3, it is going to be just as good.  Am waiting for the fall, when the rains return to Seattle and we are all stuck indoors.  LOL
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|a great passtime for all ages! opens on different routes every time so it avoids monotony. challenges both swiping and tilting skills. an all-around pleasure to play!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I downloaded this because I have this game on my iPad, and it still didn't work. I want the real candy crush saga and not fake apps. However, if you. are going to make a fake app, make to function correctly. I would rate it 5 nagative stars if I could.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever. Buy this game! It is really worth it. The best part is it is free.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|This is a great movie.  We really love this movie and wanted it to put on our Kindle to watch when re are not at home.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  I wish there was another book on the series to read. O well it was still good
B0053O89KG|5.0|Castle is one of the best TV Shows on TV today we already have the first 3 seasons on DVD
1582406723|5.0|My sister loves the walking dead so I am getting her up to speed with the comics, came quick and in great shape.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Very nice app for what it's designed to do.... perfect ambient sounds for those restless nights and for those on rotating shifts that need to sleep at all kinds of odd hours.  Worth the small investment!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions and this game is great! A lot of fun and very addicting. I could play for hours.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interestingly easy but challenging game, its a puzzle game so you will have to make a effort to figure out things as you go higher. If you get confused along the way but finally figure it out then like me, you would've rated five too. (For using mathematics to open a box.) I really liked it. Hope for more.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|love the graphics!<br />the guns are cool.the special effects are awesome.the gameplay is sweet.five stars is what this game deserves.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|Joe still has the voice and style...love the whole CD!  True R & B artist - on my playlist every day!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Loses some of the lustre from the book by ignoring some character development (plus not expanding on the relationship between Gale and Katniss). Otherwise, very well done story that keeps with the drama from the book.
B005BHNCO8|3.0|It's $70. I wasn't expecting something incredible, but the umbrellas are wimpy. If they get knocked over, you have to trash the umbrella - which wouldn't be a big deal since even without the umbrellas, it's still a deal...except that the stands aren't heavy duty enough to hold the better brands. The Speedlight attachment is of good quality though; that will last a while.
B008WK31A6|4.0|The talent (genius) at songwriting is still alive, but his voice is getting pretty bad. Saw him in concert a couple of month's ago and he did not look at all well. The band supported him well, but it ended up with a high percentage of just instrumental, with Dylan on the harmonica.<br />Enjoy this album, because I am afraid it will be one of, if not actually, his last.<br />&#34;Bootleg&#34; tapes from previous recording sessions may be all we will get in future albums.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|I love the music and the movie. So getting it on Blue Ray was just a big plus. Arrived on time and just as I remembered.
B00DXJCGE8|5.0|NOW I can port my ok docs to fire, yea! Ok is dad bomb too, so this app is clearly the date. Yo 5 stars.
1452101248|5.0|I originally bought this cookbook because it was beautiful to look at with all the gorgeous photos, also it feels quite nice in your hands with the cushioned cover. However, I have now cooked out of this book about five times and I have to say the food is delicious! Being a flexitarian, I tend to eat vegan or vegetarian during the week and will have some fattier meals on the weekend that involve meat. But, I was getting a little bored with my healthy weekday meals, I was looking for something to spice things up. Well, this book has filled that void. I would highly recommend!
B005P4PAVK|4.0|I really like all the scifi references and the fact that I know them! I go back to the original Star Trek and all its sequels and films! I also love it when stars like George Takei and Wil Wheaton turn up. I'll keep watching!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Effectively cleans the Kindle Fire of all accumulated cookies and clears the Kindle Fire Cache to free up Memory!  Easy to operate and it was free!!
1442337966|5.0|Received the CD's...Love them!!! Thank-you much!!! I will be sharing them with my friends and family for sure. Posted on Facebook!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Brings together all the players as Avengers to save the day from Earth Invaders from a different Realm.  Great Special effects and good writers with actors that seem to act as a team!
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Thought it was a very good movie and I am a guy. Shows that you don't need to find someone that is perfect but instead you just need to find someone that will accept you for who you are and you can do the same for them.
140006922X|5.0|Wonderful book, and a perfect introduction to the subject for those of us who want to read an objective, scholarly study of Jesus of Nazareth which was written by an actual scholar who has spend their lifetime studying the subject.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants the \\"real\\" story of Jesus.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. It keeps you thinking and solving while you search for things. I can hardly wait till more levels are created.
B00C2FFJFM|3.0|OK, I usually do not write reviews on music.  It's almost impossible to objectively review ART.  There is nothing that you can really use to support your assertions whether art is good or not.  If you think it is good, it is.  If you think it's bad, it is...<br /><br />But before I get into my review, I have to say this...<br />I think it is HILARIOUS that the top rated review claims that Selena can't sing at a level like better artists like Demi Lovato.  I'd wonder if that reviewer really knows Demi Lovato at all?  I had no opinion (good or bad) about Demi Lovato until I saw her perform \\"live\\" on one of those morning shows on TV.  I only watched it (Demi Lovato) as I knew a lot of people liked comparing her to Selena Gomez (an artist I truly love) and so I was curios about Demi.  This is what I observed:<br />1)  She was obviously lip-syncing.  There were times that you heard Demi's voice when the microphone was nowhere near her mouth and her mouth was closed.  There were other times when you could see Demi singing, but there was no voice audio.  Now, there is nothing really wrong with lip-syncing for a \\"live\\" performance (lots of show producers INSIST on it, in fact...so the singer has no choice), but...<br />2)  The singer was terribly off-key.  I mean, not even close.  If that \\"live\\" performance had been an audition for American Idol, the judges (all of them) would have informed Demi that she should not consider a career in music at all.  It was truly that terrible.  It's one thing to lip-sync.  But if you lip-sync OFF-KEY?!?!?  C'mon...she can't even get it right when it's pre-recorded?!?!?<br /><br />If we are comparing singing ability of Selena Gomez vs. Demi Lovato in particular, then objectively speaking...Selena Gomez would DESTROY Demi Lovato...<br />I don't say that as a Selena Gomez fan.  I say that simply because...Selena can sing, and Demi can NOT.  If Demi had any true singing ability, I would probably be a huge fan of hers, also.<br /><br />Anyway,back to my review of Selena's latest offering, Stars Dance.  I have to say I'm somewhat disappointed with this album.  It's not that it's terrible.  It's just that I can see where Selena was trying to go with this...and she did not quite get there.  Selena is not an EDM artist, but she's trying to reinvent herself as such.  And it just sounds \\"off\\", somehow.<br /><br />If I'd never EVER heard Selena Gomez before on such hits like \\"Naturally\\" or \\"Love You Like a Love Song\\" or \\"My Dilemma\\"...<br />I would listen to this Stars Dance album and I'd be thinking... \\"Well, this artist certainly has potential, if she can just find the style that fits her...\\"<br />When Selena sings on Stars Dance, her singing is competent...even more than competent.  No way could an artist like Demi sound nearly as good with this same material!!!  Selena is one of those artists who could sing the phone book and sound fantastic doing it...<br /><br />But the music here on this album for the most part...does not fit Selena at all.  It speaks volumes for Selena's talent that she can take a song that really does not fit her at all (\\"Come & Get It\\") and take it to #1 on the Dance charts.  I wouldn't be too surprised if there are other hits on this album also.  Her latest release \\"Slow Down\\" does not sound too bad, for a track that is so UN-Selena.<br /><br />But the overall feel of this CD is of an artist who is simply...lost.  I mean, would you drive a Formula One race car to the supermarket to do your grocery shopping?  If not, then why would a fantastic pop artist like Selena try to put out an EDM album?  Her true talent is wasted, here.  It's not that she sounds bad.  I don't think she could ever sound bad.  It's just that...I am shocked the producers ALLOWED this album to be made at all.<br />Selena is good at making pop music that practically FORCES you to sing along...and often makes you want to DANCE, as well.  Knowing that, why oh why would she venture into the EDM territory???  This makes zero sense.<br /><br />Will I keep listening to this CD?  Yes, millions of times...because I can't get enough of Selena, no matter how much the music does not fit her.<br /><br />But Selena missed a huge opportunity to launch herself as a madonna-level superstar, by venturing into new territory where she is truly lost...<br /><br />I'm hoping she will find her way back to her awesome pop / dance style on the next album.  In the meantime, this offering is just...  OK.  Overall.<br /><br />Now that I've reviewed the whole CD, there were only two tracks that really stood out.  One for good reasons, one for bad reasons.<br /><br />First, I will mention \\"B.E.A.T\\".  I'd be surprised if this track does not get Selena in huge (legal) trouble.  To see what I mean, google Dev and the Cataracs \\"Bass Down Low\\".  Listen to that a few times, and then listen to \\"B.E.A.T\\".  When I first heard \\"B.E.A.T\\", I remember thinking that I had heard that song before.  I thought it sounded EXACTLY like a Ke$ha song.  But I didn't know the name of the song...so I had to search a while.  Turns out what I thought was a Ke$ha song was a song by Dev and the Cataracs.  Regardless, the two songs sound almost identical.  No way you could say that one was not a ripoff of the other.<br /><br />Second track I will mention is \\"Undercover\\".  This is BY FAR the best song on the CD.  I'll be SHOCKED if this track does not DOMINATE the dance charts for months, when it is released.  And it will definitely break the top ten of the hot 100...though I don't know if it will go to #1.<br /><br />Overall, I'm disappointed with this CD.  But it's worth buying it, if only for the fact that \\"Undercover\\" is on it.  Plus, as I said before...Selena would sound good singing anything...even the phone book.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|I love Supernatural.  For me, it's the best Sci-Fi/Fantasy series currently in production, and I've been watching it since Episode 1.  They bridge the plot lines between seasons so well, infuse new characters without ever truly &#34;jumping the shark&#34;, and the humor is just awesome.<br />To compare to other series out there:<br />I tend to think of the first three seasons at least as kind of a &#34;freelance x-files&#34;, and even some episodes after.  Just instead of using UFO's as a long term story ark, there are a few other main antagonists.  (Note: no significant UFO content in this series, if that's what you're looking for.)<br />I'm Not much of a Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan, but I know a lot of people who liked that and like this.  On the other hand, I find Supernatural to be a lot grittier, better special effects, and less comic-book like than any of the episodes of Buffy I've seen.  So don't take one for granted as the other.<br />For those that are looking more for a &#34;scare the crap out of me, can't go to bed&#34; type series, I have to say it's a 50/50 shot.  On one hand my girlfriend will not watch this without me there and spending the night, so for some it will have that effect.  On the other hand it's been rare that I've had trouble sleeping.<br /><br />Sorry for anyone who's looking for comments on this season in particular, I like the series enough I'm currently in the habit of just buying them all so I can re-watch in future years... except I will comment that Castiel became of my favorite sci-fi characters ever. :-P
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|It's hard for me to even find the energy to review this flop. So little attention to detail- every scene was anti-logical to what a normal person would do under such circumstances. Kinda like a movie produced & directed by a 12 hyear old.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|I loved the music from the Lord of the Rings series on par with loving the movies themselves. This product was what I've been looking for, for a long time. It's every scrap they have to give it seems, and all the tracks you don't get with the normal sound track are enjoyable. It also seems some what broken up in to more tracks as well. Maybe it's to much for some folks, but I myself enjoy all the subtleties of the work, and being able to put on the three &#34;complete recordings&#34; soundtracks and have it fill an entire day.  Four disks is quite nice!
B000VDDWDS|4.0|Great Movie, gripping action and adventure. What else can I say? 9 more words I have to write.. I am done
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I am a Lord of the Rings fan, and loved every minute of the main &#34;Lord of the Rings&#34; movies.  I think the first installment of &#34;The Hobbit&#34; was a good start to the new &#34;Trilogy&#34; of sort-of-prequels.  The story did cover approximately 1/3 of the original book, and I found most of the special effects amusing.  I will say the first half hour or so might be kind of difficult for those not really into this sort of movie.  (Though it might be my favorite part. :-P)<br />Howard Shore's music is wonderful as usual, and fits well with some of the many themes and sound of the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  I also really enjoyed (though again it's not for everyone) The fact they did keep a couple of the Songs from the book in there.  I particularly giggle every time I hear &#34;That's what Bilbo Baggin's Hates&#34;.<br />I do have some misgivings about changes and tones they chose to take with this first film in order to set up enough material to span three though.  And I'm very weary of where they'll go with the other two.  For more on that see the last paragraph in &#34;&#60;&#62;&#34; Brackets at the end.<br />I'm not a big fan of 3D movies, so that lead me to get this as opposed to the 3D version.  I actually don't think 3D comes off good enough unless it is paired with the High Frame Rate technology, which I don't think most home theater systems can handle yet.<br />I also feel I should make a point about the Digital Copy.  I absolutely HATE this version of Digital Copy.  I bought the movie for the movie itself, but the 'UltraViolet' Digital copies are basically worthless to me.  You can't watch it unless you're on a computer or other device that's capable of watching streaming.  I want Digital Copies to watch while on my Gym's treadmills or on the Train, two places my Ipod cannot get Wi-Fi.  I suppose if you're a Streaming Internet Junky who never is without a connection no matter what the cost then it will be fine for you, but otherwise I advise youNOT to count on the Digital Copy.<br /><br />&#60;&#60;Disclaimer, if you want 0 spoilers then do not read this last paragraph.  For what I'm seeing in the first film: as a Tolkien geek I have serious eyebrow raising about Saruman and Galadriel's appearances as they weren't really in the Hobbit Book.  I think the creation of a sort of &#34;Main Antagonist&#34; via Azog the Defiler can be a useful bridge tension between movies, but will be disappointed if they take it too far as he was, again, not in the book.  I'm also not fond of the fact they seem to make the Elves borderline antagonists in this film.  I'd understand that frame of mind for materials they've left for the other two movies and the Mirkwood elves, however the books clearly show Elrond's elves and the stay in Rivendell to be completely pleasant not some grumpy barrier to getting on with the journey.&#62;&#62;
B009QA3VY2|5.0|Word are so beautiful. And you find this out in this book. So descriptive in what the characters are feeling and what their viewing in their life.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I loved the music from the Lord of the Rings series on par with loving the movies themselves. This product was what I've been looking for, for a long time.

031265068X|4.0|After the somewhat repetitive hype of the first chapter, this book really gets going and is informative and balanced in its views of Marc Rich. An enjoyable read.
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I really do like almost all of Rush's music preceding this album.  In fact I'm the opposite of a lot of fans that I meet in that I really liked some of the other recent stuff.<br />The problem I found with this one was mostly in the Lyrics.  If you're a fan of the instrumental parts purely (the notes and tunes), and they could be saying any words it wouldn't matter to you, then I'd say you're fine.  The actual sound is quite similar to their other work, and if it were portrayed as a entirely instrumental album I might have liked it better.  But I'd say more than half the Rush fan's I know don't look at the music that way.<br />To expand on my dislike of this album more:  Most Rush fans like their music due to its great lyrical content.  I am not impressed with MOST lyrics on this album.  To me the Lyrics seem to contradict previous songs of theirs, and take a new stance that I don't care for.<br />In example:  I find the lyrics to &#34;BU2B&#34; as pretty conflicting with &#34;Roll the Bones&#34;.  If one takes the entire thing as a narrative and tries to pile it all as one piece like some of the rest of their albums then one could argue that the second version of the song &#34;BU2B2&#34; makes up for it, but then they follow it up with &#34;Wish Them Well&#34; that placed right after that would seem to be conflicting once more.  Taken by itself I find &#34;Wish Them Well&#34; borderline contradictory to &#34;The Pass&#34;, and definitely not how I wish to treat my friends.<br />While I am not enough of a &#34;Superfan&#34; to have followed all of what they've said about the album, if I were to predict what's going on it would be that they sold out to this book that is being promoted side by side with it and that they lyrics have been hijacked by that.

0684824906|5.0|As  a person who never had a really good history teacher, this book has opened my eyes to a fascinating period of US history. Even though I grew up in the South inundated with war memorials, I did not have an understanding of the forces that interacted to abolish slavery or the genius and compassion of Abraham Lincoln.  (I live in a state that, regrettably, still flies the Confederate flag and thrives on &#34;Dixie&#34;.)<br />This book was very well written -- a page turner -- and I am anxious to read more by Ms. Goodwin.  &#34;Team of Rivals&#34; has inspired me to read Burlingame's &#34;Abraham Lincoln&#34;.  I highly recommend it.

B008LZHA3G|4.0|Legendary folk rock/delta blues singer-songwriter Bob Dylan continues to make great music in this his 35th studio album titled 'Tempest' (10 new tracks) that can't be ignored. His lyrics are the darkest in years but the music certainly one of his best in recent years in comparison to 'Modern Times' and 'Together Through Life'.<br /><br />Stand-outs/gems/my favourites are the poetic/rhyming sweet melodical tracks \\"Soon After Midnight\\" (folk rock track), \\"Long And Wasted Years\\" (delta blues track), \\"Tempest\\" (folk rock title track with great accordion and guitar combination. The song is a beautiful 13:54 long) and the closing track \\"Roll On John\\" (folk rock track about the death of John Lennon and is 7:35 long).<br /><br />Bob Dylan is on a roll in this new CD release titled 'Tempest'. Bob Dylan has squashed speculation that this may his last CD, we still love his talent to shine. A recommended CD listening.
0793563836|5.0|I recently got a bass guitar after not playing for nearly 20 years - and then it was just goofing around in a high school garage band with no training.  This book has made coming back to the bass a pleasure.  I went to my local library and checked out 3 different bass books, including this Hall Leonard method.  I liked it so much that I bought my own copy.  I really like the included CDs which you can play along too.  The tracks on the CD have the full band and bass, you can adjust the balance to one side or the other to either minimize the bass or minimize the band, your choice or leave it centered.  So far I've gotten through most of book 1 and look forward to the rest. I like how it teaches you to read music - tab is not even shown until about half way through the book.  I had piano lessons as a kid and then was in the school band in middle school so reading music came back without too much difficulty.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is the beginning of Metallica starting to add more motivation to their music.. The audio mix for the band starts to improve, in my opinion. As does their next albums.  I like listening to their live shows and have bought their beginning CD's from there.  The new live stuff  is great, but you usually want to hear where they began.  This was one of the best.

Not only are the jokes that from the Nintendo age funny, the kids liked them and they knew little about the characters from then.<br /><br />It is a good movie you'll watch with kids over and over.

B00AHJL7BK|4.0|In Kakuro HD from Andrei Mankevich, the goal is to solve a math puzzle that is kind of a combination of Crossword and Sudoku type puzzles.<br /><br />The description I just gave of Kakuro HD, the free paid app of the day for July 27, 2013 from the Amazon App Store will probably sound very similar to another recent 2 time Amazon free app of the day, Unolingo.<br /><br />While Unolingo required letters A-Z to be filled in once a piece to make words in a crossword type puzzle, this app Kakuro HD requires numbers 1-9 to be filled in a crossword style layout so that the numbers in each row and column add up to the numbers listed above and to the left of the empty squares.  Kakuro HD is like Sudoku since no number can appear in the same answer twice.  For example if the total has to equal 4 for a certain row, 2 and 2 will not work.  The only correct answer for that row would be a combination of 1 and 3.<br /><br />Now the app developer tries to make clear in the instructions that math abilities aren't that important.  For most people it would be helpful to use the pencil option which you can put down all the numbers that each square could be at the beginning of the game.  For example if you have 4 number squares that have to equal 30, you can eliminate numbers 1-5 in those squares since 6+7+8+9 is the only combination that would equal 30.  This will likely make it easier to solve the puzzle so you don't have to go back and fix a lot of errors by playing the game by trial and error.<br /><br />The game is nicely designed with a zooming feature for the larger size puzzles and the graphics look rather acceptable.  There is also a hint feature which gives you a certain number in the puzzle and can only be accessed once every minute or two.  The app size in the app storage is rather small at just over 3 megabytes which is definitely a plus.<br /><br />The reason I am deducting one star though is because of the lack of a timer and timing statistics so you can see how long it takes you to solve one of these puzzles on average and by the size of the puzzle completed.  In the Amazon GameCircle page there are absolutely no achievements for this game.  Also the scoring system is not explained and makes no sense why you get a score of 5 for finishing a puzzle as an example of the score I got playing a game of this.  The only thing I can think of why my score was 5 was because I played a 5 X 5 puzzle and maybe the scoring is based on what the size of the puzzle you completed is.  I think a better scoring system is probably needed here.<br /><br />And I am not deducting a star for this, but I would suggest the app publisher should consider in a future game of this type to have a swap the number feature where you could switch the positions of 2 adjacent numbers.  This would be rather helpful so you wouldn't have to enter the same numbers so many times.<br /><br />So I am giving this 4 stars out of a possible 5 stars since it is a rather nice game that could be improved quite a bit in the scoring part of the game.

1250046971|5.0|I devoured this book in one night. Marked by P.C. Cast and Kristin Cast is the first book in The House of Night series. It's about Zoey Redbird who gets marked by a trapper and has to change her entire life and move to The House of Night Academy. A vampyre finishing school. Zoey you will find is a very special girl and the book follows her first weeks after being marked. If you love vampire books this one is a for sure read. It is a easy fast read and you will be hooked and ready for book two just like me.<br /><br />The House of Night series is set in a world very much like our own, except in 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres have always existed.  In this first book in the series, Zoey enters the House of Night, a school where, after having undergone the Change, she will train to become an adult vampire--that is, if she makes it through the Change.  Not all of those who are chosen do.  It's tough to begin a new life, away from her parents and friends, and on top of that, Zoey finds she is no average fledgling.  She has been Marked as special by the vampyre Goddess, Nyx.  But she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers.  When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite club, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends.

1444904841|5.0|My grand daughter just loves this book!  The only problem is the DVD didnt work.  I think it's because we are in the USA and they came from the UK.
B000O76T90|5.0|i'm a huge fan of the Die Hard movies so any fan of the film knows the plot.<br />this review is about the different DVD reissue's<br />this 2007 steelbook is the best version you'll ever get of Die hard cause it's the 2 Disc edition<br />it's got tons of extras on Disc 2 including 2 extended scenes not included in the Theatrical version<br />there is Deleted scenes, outtakes, Newscasts featurette which are interviews with cast and crew<br />and audio commentary aswell<br />plus the Picture and audio quality is fantastic widescreen, better than the 2001 release<br />this steel book reissue has been digital remastered using 2006-7 Digital technology<br />much better quality then the 2001 release<br /><br />i also compared this 2007 steelbook reissue with the Die Hard blu-ray version, the blu-ray quality is better cause it's blu-ray technology<br />but only slighty better than the 2007 dvd version i found, it's matter of opinion really.<br /><br />the only difference between the blu-ray version and this steelbook release<br />is the extended branching version is not on the blu-ray version<br />the branching version has the 2 extended scenes not included in the Theatrical version<br />which is the power shutdown sequence and the Airplane scene, so as far as i know the Blu-ray release has only the Theatrical version<br />and i prefer the full uncut version of this movie which explains the plot more thoroughly.<br /><br />so yes good info to know that the blu-ray version of Die hard does not have the 2 extended scenes and only has the Theatrical version.<br />in my opinion if the blu-ray does not have the 2 extended scenes option aswell as the Theatrical version<br />then there is no point buying the blu-ray release at all<br />i'll stay with my 2007 release which i think is just as Good picture and audio quality anyway.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|Well written.  It gives some insight into what went on in Afghanistan and Iraq.  We tend to forget how the civilians suffered.
0060589280|5.0|Coalho really out did himself with this novel. It is very intriguing and a hot read. The underlying plot will leave the reader questions the grey area that exist in morals and ethics.

0070511136|4.0|The main premise of this book is best summarized by the author in the first chapter of the book: \\"The traditional selling models, methods, and techniques that most of us have been trained to use work best in small sales. In this book I'll be showing you that what works in small sales can hurt your success as the sales grow larger--and I'll be sharing with you our research findings that have uncovered new and better models for success in large sales...One of the simplest models of a sales call does seem to be applicable to any size of sale; almost every sales call you can think of, from the simplest to the most sophisticated, goes through four distinct stages 1. Preliminaries: These are the warming-up events that occur before the serious selling begins...2. Investigating: Almost every sale involves finding something out by asking questions...3. Demonstrating Capability: In most calls you will need to demonstrate to customers that you've something worthwhile to offer...4. Obtaining Commitment: Finally, a successful sales call will end with some sort of commitment from the customer...We decided that the focus of our research would be to develop new and positive questioning models that could replace the old ones, which were proving so unsatisfactory...We found that questions in the successful call tend to fall into a sequence we call SPIN. In summary the SPIN sequence of questions is: 1) Situation Questions: At the start of the call, successful people tend to ask data-gathering questions about facts and background.... 2) Problem Questions: Once sufficient information has been established about the buyer's situation, successful people tend to move to a second type of question... 3) Implication Questions: In smaller sales, sellers can be very successful if they just know how to ask good Situation and Problem Question...4) Need-payoff Questions:Finally, we found that very successful salespeople ask a fourth type of question during the Investigating stage... is that they get the customer to tell you the benefits that your solution could offer.\\"<br /><br />Below are key excerpts from the book that I found particularly insightful:<br /><br />1- \\"The psychological effect of pressure seems to be this. If I'm asking you to make a very small decision, then--if I pressure you--it's easier for you to say yes than to have an argument. Consequently, with a small decision, the effect of pressure is positive. But this isn't so with large decisions. The bigger the decision, the more negatively people generally react to pressure.\\"<br /><br />2- \\"By forcing the customer into a decision, closing techniques speed the sales transaction...Closing techniques may increase the chances of making a sale with low-priced products. With expensive products or services, they reduce the chances of making a sale.\\"<br /><br />3- \\"The first step in successful closing is to set the right objectives. The starting point for obtaining a commitment is to know what level of commitment from the customer will be needed to make the call a success.\\"<br /><br />4- \\"So what's the test of closing success? What's the result, or outcome, that allows us to say that one call has been successful while another has failed? The method we finally chose involved dividing the possible outcomes of the call into four areas: 1)Orders: Where the customer makes a firm commitment to buy... 2)Advances: Where an event takes place, either in the call or after it, that moves the sale forward toward a decision... 3)Continuations: Where the sale will continue but where no specific action has been agreed upon by the customer to move it forward...4)No-sales: Our final category is where the customer actively refuses a commitment.\\"<br /><br />5- \\"Obtaining Commitment: Four Successful Actions 1. Giving attention to Investigating and Demonstrating Capability...2. Checking that key concerns are covered..3. Summarizing the Benefits... 4.Proposing a commitment\\"<br /><br />6- \\"The purpose of  questions in the larger sale is to uncover Implied Needs and to develop them into Explicit Needs.\\"<br /><br />7- \\"Demonstrating Capability Effectively: 1.Don't demonstrate capabilities too early in the call...2. Beware Advantages...3. Be careful with new products.\\"<br /><br />8- \\"Making Your Preliminaries Effective: 1. Get down to business quickly...2. Don't talk about solutions too soon...3. Concentrate on questions.\\"<br /><br />9- \\"The Four Golden Rules for Learning Skills Rule 1: Practice Only One Behavior at a Time Start by picking just one behavior to practice...Don't move on to the next until you're confident you've got the first behavior right.... Rule 2: Try the New Behavior at Least Three Times...Never judge whether a new behavior is effective until you've tried it at least three times...Rule 3: Quantity Before Quality...When you're practicing, concentrate on quantity: use a lot of the new behavior. Don't worry about quality issues, such as whether you're using it smoothly or whether there might be a better way to phrase it. Those things get in the way of effective skills learning. Use the new behavior often enough and the quality will look after itself...Rule 4: Practice in Safe Situations...Always try out new behaviors in safe situations until they feel comfortable. Don't use important sales to practice new skills.\\"<br /><br />10- \\"The most important lessons come from the way you review the calls you make. After each call, ask yourself such questions as these: Did I achieve my objectives? If I were making the call again, what would I do differently?

159463176X|5.0|Hosseni never fails to provide the reader with a captivating story that touchs your heart and soul. Great book , I recommend all his books to anyone who enjoys a good fictional read and wants to gain insight into the other cultures of the world. Book arrived promptly in great condition.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|There is a twist that made me fall in love with the book even more!  Never saw the ending comming!
B0082Z447U|5.0|And a bonus if you like mystery/drama without the convolutions of Dickens.  If you haven't read 'The Moonstone' (also Wilkie Collins) that is also an enjoyable read of the same ilk, and to be savoured as perhaps the daddy of all further crime stories.
B000F8O35U|5.0|My kids have been obsessed with mermaids since our trip to the aquarium, so I wanted to get the movie, The Little Mermaid. You cannot find it in stores, so I was very happy to find the brand new DVD (still in the wrapper) on Amazon.com. It's been on repeat ever since it arrived.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|Loved the movie and the music as well.  Currently have this one in my car and enjoy the upbeat tunes all the way to work and home.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|These were a great buy. We use them when we take the kids to the pool and play fast uno while the kids swim.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I favor historical fiction and this one hits the spot. It gives an amazing perspective on the history of Europe and the events that led to WW1 and events in its aftermath that shaped Europe.<br /><br /> Flowing narrative, I could feel for all the 5 families in the book.<br />I now loom forward to reading the second part of the trilogy where the children of the protagonists of this book would hold centre stage.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game not too hard<br />not too easy great for exercising your brain!!!<br />all in all just a fantastic game!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Loved all the characters! Tatiana is amaaaaazing. Can't wait for season 2.  May subscribe to BBC America just to be able to watch right away.

B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a pretty nifty game. I've only played the tutorial so far but it seems to have plenty to offer while you explore the many rooms and quests it offers. I'll definitely keep playing.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|i don`t like angry birds games are BORING, are always the same fgmdjkfdnjfgndkgdfkjgnkj, but good graphics and good idea XD
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I did not find it fun!  It was too easy!  I would not recomend it to anyone!  I will delete it!

B0064X7FVE|2.0|Was quite surprised when new app suddenly appeared with no warning. The points thing is interesting but the app itself is confusing. It's easy to get lost. Maybe it will grow on me but too early to tell.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think it could be used by all ages it also has in app purchases but that's ok because they don't bother people it's so much fun I definitely recommend this app
B0064MPXFA|5.0|More than just a drama, the writing is inspired. The interactions are detailed and keep the viewer actively engaged in the story.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Read the book carefully 2 times.The info is great with scientific basis.Starting the training from 29 July 2013 will update the progress.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Star studded cast. The chemistry between the characters is phenomenal, the writing is fabulous and the story lines leave you hungry for more.  The only downside is the short season.
B00CATSONE|5.0|An interesting and well written short book. A journey of the genius, perseverance, and betrayal of a remarkable man. A must read!
1476734941|5.0|For me, this book makes a lot of sense and it's something one can do (long term), which is essential to have some good results.<br />I lost 18# in the first 2 months ( pretty good ) but am stuck around the same weight after the 3rd month.<br />May be telling me I need to do a little better on my non-fast days. Am going to stick with this. For me it's a weight loss<br />program that is far better than anything else I have tried ( or am willing to commit to ). The Fast days are<br />not easy but are tolerable because you can look forward to eating normal tomorrow.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who needs to lose weight and has un-successfully tried a lot of other weight loss programs that you either could not or were not willing to stick with. This program could very well be something that will work for you. Once you read the book, see if you don't agree that it's worth giving it a try....
B000I9VZJ8|1.0|Was the last of my friends to see this movie and I will have to ask what they liked about it.

B0048L4VRA|3.0|Took the pool to the beach for6 mo old. It took my sister-in-law over 30 min to blow up by mouth. It does offer some shade and is a good size for 1-2 infants.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|love games like these. the best escape game so far. its a bit short but challenging as well. cant wait for them to come out with more levels.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Hilarious and sexy! Love a tortured man and he is so tortured. One of my faves! Totally worth ***** rating!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Still a very good movie after so many years. And the promoted price is unbeatable. Glad to have this bluray set.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I really liked this book.  It was full of mystery and suspense and you never knew what was going to happen.  One thing I have to say is that Rick Riordan is now my favorite author!!!! I love his books!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it is very puzzling. Idk if it would help you with detective work but it is an awesome game
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I picked up the first, free book, which is very short, and was hooked right away. Before I finished it, I purchased the omnibus edition and moved right into it. Since there are already reviews with plot descriptions, I'll skip that. I love sci-fi or futuristic books, but this one makes a really interesting setting. I have a toddler, which means I don't get to sleep as late as I want. Therefore, most of the time I won't jeopardize getting enough sleep just to read a book that I like. With this one I did. Enough said.
086571701X|5.0|This book is an excellent reference on the subject of aquaponics.  The subject is broken down into its component parts and explained with enough detail that I do believe that armed with just this book a person could get started in aquaponics and achieve success.
B0095P31L6|3.0|My kids really wanted to see Rango, especially after how much they enjoyed Johnny Depp in the Pirates series.  This one fell short of my expectations.  First, the good.  I appreciated the themes of being who you are and telling the truth.  The main character learned the consequences of lying and the value of being true to who you are as he fought to save the town from villains who were stealing all the town's water - the setting was reminiscent of the wild west.<br /><br />I wasn't crazy about the language that was used.  Also, one of the characters (Miss Beans), became a laughing point because of a disability (she would freeze up at odd points).  At one point, other characters were making fun of her for this problem.<br /><br />This movie was entertaining for older kids, but with the undercurrents of lying, cussing, drinking and making fun of others for their problems, it isn't one I would recommend for a younger set.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I absolutely love this app!!! It really makes you use your imagination. Its like totally fetch. It is AWESOMENESS. u should really get this app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a really fun game.  I love horses and now I get to play with them. its so cool.  great app.
B0084I2PEO|4.0|I really enjoyed The Kite Runner, so I was eager to get my hands on A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini.<br /><br />My opinion: it's a good book, but not as good as The Kite Runner. Let me throw some thoughts out at you, but per my norm, this won't be a standard review. You can find a gajillion of those already.<br /><br />On a strange note, I think that some people will find this book better than The Kite Runner, not because the writing is any better, but simply because TKR had a pretty vulgar, vile event that initiated a change in the characters' behavior. If you're one of those people and know what I'm talking about, give this book a try...you may like it more than his others.<br /><br />The prose is really good, not great. And the themes are good, not great. It kept my attention, it stirred my emotions, and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The story is set in Afghanistan, which is where his other two novels take place. While I have taken pleasure in discovering some of those small details of Afghan life that I would otherwise never have known about, I also would like to see him branch out a little bit, try a new locale. Oh, well, he has time for that later...I'd say for now he has cornered the market on what he's got going.<br /><br />Some people complain if a book is too happy, that it isn't realistic. You won't have that problem here. We've got plenty of abuse and misfortunes and injustice to go around. Of course, if you are the opposite end of the spectrum of readers, and want a perfect and happy ending, well, I don't want to give it away...read it and make your own decisions.<br /><br />The characters are solidly developed, some that you love, and some you will hate.<br /><br />I'll tell you what shocked me and it's not even directly related to Khaled Hosseini's writing. It's that 4,000 of his 400,000 reviews on Goodreads are 1-star reviews. What? Really? I don't see how that's possible. Are you telling me there were no redeeming qualities whatsoever in thenovel? Ludicrous and absurd. It may not be the superstar quality of the first book, but still good.<br /><br />It's a good thing I don't blindly listen to the people who leave 1-star reviews, or I would miss out on a lot of good books! I know that reviewers aren't professionals. I'm not; most people aren't. All I mean by that is that people are emotionally driven and they aren't trained to write reviews. One bad joke, or not fitting the narrow mold of one's tastes, or writing in first person, or not containing an element of romance, or having a couple that is \\"too in love,\\" or a thousand other silly things can make a reviewer drop a 1-star rating. Really, really take the bad reviews with a grain of salt.<br /><br />But, I digress...right?<br /><br />Hosseini did a fine job with A Thousand Splendid Suns. He's well on his way to establishing himself as an author that reliably enchants us with beautiful tales and rich characters.  I look forward to his next novel.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I loved this movie! So funny and charming, Ryan Gosling played such a good role, different from his others. Awesome cast overall.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Really good book. I felt Lone Survivor is both a better book and written better. American Sniper is still a must read if you're into the genre.
0920668372|5.0|Great to give to your child or grown up! A real keepsake from the heart! Our Son cherishes it, and he is 27.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie opening weekend. I knew then i needed to read the book. I was amazed at the depth of detail the book provided. The way implied realities come alive. I highly recommend the book.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This sad, but beautiful love story is about a guy and a girl--that's how they're named in the credits--who meet at the wrong time.  He's a busker and vacuum repairman, while she sells magazines and cleans houses.  He's an Irishman with a lost love who left for England.  She has a husband in the Czech Republic.But the two of them have their own personal musical passions, and when those are combined, the result is more beautiful yet.  Like watching two desperate ships passing in the night, the viewer hopes these two will find safe harbor together.<br /><br />Review by the author of [[ASIN:0983687242 A Draft of Moonlight]]
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Best game I have ever played. Can't wait till the next one comes out. please make the next room game Don't stop making new
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|We enjoyed this latest Die Hard with the addition of John McClane's son.  It was not as good as the previous ones but was still entertaining! There were twists to keep us wondering, and lots of car chases, crashes and explosions for viewers who enjoy those. The violence was a little more graphic and callous than usual.  A little sentimentality and the typical funny one-liners. Glad Bruce Willis is still game to make these movies! I'd see a dozen more if he made them.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I heard a lot about this book, which made me want to read it. To be honest, the beginning is kind of boring and takes a while to get hooked on, but once you hit a certain part you won't be able to put it down. I'd say when you get to around Part Two. But definitely give it a chance!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is like subway surfed but better!!!!!!!!! a fun game to play. I like to play it word word word
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun puzzle game. The levels are pretty easy but still enjoyable. I hope that there are more levels soon. Recommended by my daughter and glad I downloaded.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, easy read, hard to put.down.  Great beach read for adults.  Great for teens as well.  Can't wait to read the last book.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|About one quarter of the way into this one I was hooked. It kept me up until 3 am last night and then I had to finish it this morning. Very impressive debut. I will be reading more Elizabeth Haynes in the future.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|Although it was issued in 1986, I just found it because of Pope Francis' (a Jesuit) visit to Brazil.+  It documents the abuse of the Indian population at a  mMission high up in the rain forest.<br />DeNiro and Irons are superb as Jesuit missionaries and details the sacking of a mission for greedy Iberians.  You can't help not caring about native people adopting a new way of communal life and religion.  In the end they lose everything and speculation would be what was left returned to the forest
B00821OX98|5.0|Good show, good build up, nice intrigue, well put together.  It's a nice show to watch while you're waiting for The Walking Dead to come back.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|got this for my daughter and fell in love with it myself must have for all age's! the only bad thing is I wished more of my friends played it for the challenges.
B003L77GVK|1.0|There are only 2 seasons. All this season 1, 1.5, 2, Final Season crap. This IS the final season, why they are calling one \\"Season 2\\" and another \\"The Final Season\\" makes absolutely no sense other than to rip people off. They are the same thing with different packaging. I like the show, however all this different packaging is misleading and an attempt to trick people into buying multiple copy's of the same thing to make more money. The show is awesome, and its a shame that it was canceled, but all this different packaging really sucks.

B005QYKD4I|3.0|Good Sunday afternoon movie. Not too bad, but not too good. Wasn't expecting &#34;Braveheart&#34; (obviously); but wouldn't pay-per-view it for even a dollar.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|A+, a great episode indeed! With great battles, and an Amazing climax at the end of the show with great emotional drama.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I'm a soon to be grandma...YEAH!...far from a pro gamer.  What's not to love? Even have my hubby playing this and he hates computers/tablets, etc. yet there he sits in his favorite chair w/Angry Birds! Thanks! Not much is free anymore.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this with an open mind and also realized it was someone elses personal  journal. I  was gently  reassured that there is love and peace when when we all move on from this life. Thank you.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I assumed that this show would only appeal to those guys wearing Cheetos stained underwear that still live in their mom's basement.  I was wrong.  I live in a real house with my wife and I don't even like Cheetos.  It starts a little slow, but the story develops quickly and sucks you in.  I was sorry to see it only lasted 2 seasons, but that can keep the series from getting stagnant.
B004LKRR6U|5.0|I was quite surprised at the artistic detail -- the face looked so much like Grace Kelly!  The gown is so gorgeous and elegant.  I was going to give it as a gift, but now I think I'll keep it for myself:)  Takes me back to the days when women were truly women. Quick delivery and the package was in A+ condition.  Would definitely purchase from this seller again.  Thanks!
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|I understand the movie better now.  Too bad more of the characters weren't developed more in the movie. For instance Jules or Al Neri.

0151907374|4.0|I purchased this book for a class. It turned-out that this was not the correct version that my teacher wished. This book is an old hardback from a library which is fine with me. The shipping time was reasonable.

Although I did miss having the letter seen and him walking into the dinner party.  I will leave it a that for<br />those of you who need to buy this one !!!!!  I recommend getting them all from AMAZON - they seem to have everything -<br />keep the smile moving on  :) :)  LS
B000000W71|5.0|Cannot go wrong with Gary Moore. His heart and soul are injected with all his music. Each note he touches speaks volumes. His voice is flowing with all he sings and cannot be separated. The man was taken to early from this life. He had so much more to offer the music industry. I highly recommend his music too all. I regret I found him to late to enjoy one of his concerts.
B006N0YWGY|4.0|Since it was a FAOTD, it was worth the price. It was a lot of fun for a little while, but it is very repetitive.  So once you &#34;run&#34; through it once or twice, you can just delete it.<br /><br />Only 4 stars because he concept and execution were good, but needs more tracks!  (If I had to pay for it, I would give it less stars)
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun game but I played through all 10 levels in about an hour. Would like to see larger maps as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game it makes you think to solve all the levels. great game for age 6 and up.
0500516766|3.0|it is nice to show a grandchild......and the cover shot is the best image....expected greater variety...didn't happen...big photos are nice
159463176X|5.0|Well written telling a story that slowly unfolds from multiple viewpoints. Engrossing. Well done. It's set mostly in Afganistan with  insight into the culture.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Touching and heartrending at the same time. Well written, and thought provoking. I would've liked more details about serious prison.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This fun remake is really well done with exciting visuals, great cinematography, and fine acting. Spock has been reborn in Zachary; they look so much alike (when Nimoy was young, that is) that it is freakish. Be prepared for some changes, however, in that this film seems to take place in a parallel universe. Spock and Uhurah are fall in love and, apart from some rough spots along the way, carry their love connection into the second film.<br /><br />The bad guys are pretty good too. Lots of great CGI explosions and emotional tension between Kirk and Spock as they get to know each other. This is a time travel trip, after all, taking the viewer back to what would be considered a prequel by most fans.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|And it kept her entertained. God knows why she, or anybody, would enjoy watching a bunch of rich people enjoy their wealth without ever having to break a sweat… However, enjoy it she did, and I am therefore pleased with the purchase.
B000ICKPOQ|3.0|There are some good episodes, but overall, I rate it at only 3 stars. This last sentence is only here to meet the requirement.
1781162646|3.0|This was a pretty solid read overall. I would not highly recommend this book to anyone though. I'm surprised at all of the 4 and 5 star reviews - reviews that were a large part of the reason I made this purchase. The only other King works I've read are the Dark Tower series. I realize this book is in a completely different genre but it's nowhere near the caliber of those works. Not even close. That being said, it seems to take forever (almost 200 pages) before any kind of interesting thing happens in the book, which is only about 275 pages I believe. Yes, he paints a nice picture and gives plenty of background info but for my tastes it was just a bit too slow. When the action did come around it wasn't really thrilling/suspenseful enough. Anyway, that's my take.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|the music stinks the people stink it is hard to control and I just deleted it and the picture look gunner than the game such a waste air time
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Very addicting and fun. Hope to have more levels soon. I recommend this if you like hidden object games and puzzles.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|but who is the dude with 2 skin Colorado and looks like a monkey. this game rules I wish they were free!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Good product at a good price. Good sound quality. Good battery life. Easy to set up and use. Well worth the money
B008VZD12K|4.0|Not at all what I expected, and definitely not the typical biographical movie. Superb acting and very good cinematography. Highly recommended for movie fans.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I watched part 1 of Deathly Hallows quite some time ago and finally got to see part 2.  I read all of the books and found this movie great because it followed the book very well.  I have always been disappointed by the lighting in the last few movies.  The lighting was just too dark.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game to keep you thinking and makes you work to get out of the room.  love this game.
B00009ATIX|4.0|I really liked this adaptation of the Novel.  The one in the authors native language was just terrible even with subscripts.  This movie reflected my personal take on the reading of the English translation of the novel.  I liked it very much!
B000HF6XV8|3.0|The remake of the secret garden,is not like original plus end was different. As the original which I like that one better!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this book - couldn't put it down!  Amazing story, great writing.  Kept me glued to the book
159102594X|3.0|I have always loved sci-fi, but after reading game of thrones have been trying to get more into the fantasy genre. I chose this series because there were a lot of good reviews on multiple websites, and because it was relatively short. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into his writing style, after about 50 pages, I still wasn't hooked and so I decided to stop. I'll probably go back to it eventually, but there are some other books (Shadow and Claw) that I feel a much stronger desire to read for the moment.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Well written, very educational, but also too depressing for anyone over 60!  I am sure I am loosing it now!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game! It's very addicting to play and so much fun for kids and even for big kids :)
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I liked the ending. Now I might get something done around the house!! I need to buy the hardback collection now.
0440246318|4.0|As usual a superb book to read.His descriptions are really super,so vivid you can feel yourself in the picture.<br />I am looking forward to his latest book
B00846REIS|2.0|This was another version of Fifty Shades of Grey, (which I did enjoy), but with less of a story line. I'm not interested in reading the next two books in this series.
B008JFUNYG|1.0|yet another useless remake of a classic sam raimi/bruce campbell film from 1982=31 years ago!!!<br /><br />this film was made strictly to please gore fans but falls short of soul, storyline and anything remotely independently artistic. i knew in my horror loving bones this was going to be a big $$$ flop and that is all this was made for. a failed gross-out horror film which will NEVER stand up to the original.<br /><br />concerning gory horror films, if you want real scary, violent, sadistic, over-the-top gore and indenpendent written storyline..then it is time to invest in european horror like olaf ittenbach, andreas schnaas, lucio fulci, or japanese like takashi miike', yohsihiro nishimura, etc. great american horror since 2008 has really sucked!!!<br /><br />if you must still buy american horror stick with adam green/bj marshall, eli roth, robert hall, jim van bebber or go canadian with ryan nicholson, they are the best you/we have today. if you want better than troma go with camp motion pictures horror films.<br /><br />STAY CLEAR OF MODERN HORROR ESP. REMAKES...THEY-ALL-$$$SUCK$$$!!!!
B00BD62X14|3.0|the songs were light and wish they had put the words in english in the brochure as would have made it more delightful to listen to and learn at the same time.  Her voice is lovely
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved it. I think I got addicted to it. The minions are adorable and make funny faces,  I just cant stop playing this game.
159463176X|5.0|the book was excellent and one always learns a lot in Hosseni novels, a different world for sure and worth the read
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A powerful and surprising end that satisfies and yet leaves you longing for more. Glad to have finished the series.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|WANT TO TEACH YOUR KIDS ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST AND NOT BE STUCK UNDER THE SCRUTINY OF THE RATINGS FOR SCHINDLER'S LIST, TRY THIS ONE.  MY STUDENTS WERE CAPTIVATED BY IT, WANTED TO KNOW IF IT WAS A TRUE STORY, AND IT REALLY OPENED UP HONEST QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSIONS.  GLAD I BOUGHT IT.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Fascinating insight into the way our brain operates and the way we make decisions &#34;rationally&#34;. It teaches some pretty interesting things.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|A true joy to read. I felt like it was destine to be a great sequel for the Soong brethren and each chapter brought you closer to Data of the past and Noonian`s vision of the future.  It would make for an epic movie.
B0083P1QUM|1.0|I was getting extremely impatient with all the redundancy  just to fill page space. This will be the last Cornwell novel I read!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This app is the worst. Didn't work once. I had to restart my Kindle Fire HD. I removed the app immediately after.
B002W1UEW4|4.0|this is GI Joe - a real american hero with lots of action and no graphic deaths.  It offers a step up into real people movies from cartoons. I'd recommend for 10yrs and up (of course parental discretion is applied)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think you should get this game please get this you well get a free I pod and a I pad
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like this app; they only problem I have found is that many books are being digitally scanned and sometimes the scanner doesn't read the printed words or symbols well.  Some of the words may be boggled, for instance, or symbols just appear as gobbled and garbled.<br />I sure hope they get that problem cleared up soon.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|This game is so fun and easy that everyone can play and not get frustrated like other seek and find games i really hope tries this game out
B00CB4ET0K|3.0|jumpy on the kindle. and some lag during play but overall a nice diversion. Fun to knock the helmets off.
0762777931|5.0|Kris Carr is one awesome lady.  I read the book which is packed with information on food, additives etc.  I was amazed at some of the things we eat that are not good for us.  I do still eat some cheese but am trying to transition to eat like she does.<br />I am a cancer survivor so I know where she is coming from.  I had two cancers simultaneously.  She gives you so many tips and recipes.  She has a website for even more recipes and information. There is no end to how much this is helping me.  Her adventure cleans is day to day and she takes you through it step by step.  Some said her language is horrible, well I say that she is super.  She uses a few words here and there. It is not like she is a drunk sailor or anything even close.  With all she has gone through, her sharing her life to help others is very admirable.  She talks to you like you are an old friend and by the end of the book you feel like it.  I say you won't regret buying this book.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Love it, but no multiplayer without a headset is a crazy limitation. 5 stars if I could play multiplayer. I understand wanting communication but the steam and console versions don't have the same requirement.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It is to short the controls are to weird the app made my kindle freeze millions in times and it is a knockoff of minecraft PE
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well written and a fascinating read.  A late vindication for one man, and the same stuff that goes on now with big business by some of the 'same players'.  It doesn't end.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I was excited to get the app for the weather channel. But not all information seems to be up to date all the time. But over all I`d rather have something than nothing at all.
1558908382|4.0|We ordered this dvd as we both enjoyed seeing this movie long ago......The movie is just as much fun to watch for the second time........
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|Add fighting, and make trading, and see other people's stuff,make gems easier to get,make goals easier to get,add more goals
B0097PW7H8|3.0|not as good as it had been originally.  not bad though and definitely worth a look especially if this is your only app
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|OMG!! I hate the thought of this book being over and having to wait to get the next book! I'm so wanting more!! Hot hot hot!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|One of my families favorite movies. Even better in bluray. I've watched it no less than 5 times and still love it!<br />It arrived as expected. Amazon's service is always par none!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's a very good game but don't play it for too long because it will start going faster and when it does it hurts your eyes
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Made me think , variety of the puzzles kept it fun to play. I am glad I gave this one a chance.  Looking forward to the next update
B004SIP88Y|5.0|Come on, it's Jet Li! You can't go wrong with this movie. It has passion, emotion, drive and depth. A MUST watch with the sub-titles!!!!!!!!!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|How can a Muslim write a book about a Christian? It's quite simple, darling hearts: Free Will.  My Father's beautiful creation, Reza Aslan, has studied more than a thousand books, piously, over the decades to give the world yet another possible account of my time on earth.  While My Father did not possess the forethought to give you humans the ability to record history accurately for future generations in the early stages of your social development, He was kind enough to enable you the ability to think freely so that you could use logic and reason to help make sense of My life, over 2000 years of history, what it meant to the people of My time, and what My life continues to mean to mankind to this day and into the future.  Use this God given gift to think critically about Mr. Aslan's work, thereby coming to know Me and My teachings in a fuller, more complex and ultimately, more meaningful way.<br /><br />May God bless you.<br /><br />-J<br /><br />TL;DR: \\"Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.\\" 2 Timothy 2:7 ESV
B008IGP8RI|3.0|I really like this kind of music. There is the same song on this CD 4 times. Granted it is sang different each time, but still, 4 times? The movie was good, the soundtrack is just &#34;ok&#34;.
B006LSZECO|5.0|At first this was a hard book to get going into. But kept reading by everyone loved it. After a few more chapters I became addicted and ended up loving it. Great read
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|it is a lot of fun to play! just like the original card game. honestly I could play it all day.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was already a hunger games fan before I read this book. I read the books about two years ago,and decided I would 're-read the second one so I was fresh for the movie premiere. However, the second time around was just as thrilling and fast paced as the last. Katniss is a beautiful character because while she is the person everyone wishes they could be, everyone can also relate to her story. Collins has brought something revolutionary to the world of books, as this series is fresh, hilarious, heartbreaking, and tough. A must read for anyone that can
0062101897|5.0|Phenomenally written book chalk full of pictures and information on the Harry Potter movies. It's a giant book and every Harry Potter fanatic should have it.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|First time android user, I felt that the other versions of Facebook had better options than the kindle Facebook. Too much going back cing forward even with simple tasks such as looking at pics
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I bought the CD as my daughter gave me tickets to see him and I wanted to listen to his music. The album is even better than I had hoped. I highly recommend it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Love this series.  Had to re-watch the first two seasons before the season 3 premiere.  Can't wait to watch it again.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|This is a factory OEM replacement battery. It is a quality item that I expect to get years of use from.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|I recently finished watching seaaon 3. This series is<br />truly epic as the story moves from before WW1 through the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. It remains visually stunning.  I love the wonderful attention to detail in the sets and costumes, but find the writing/pace to be a little tedious, drawn out, and sluggish.<br />Because of this, most of the characters have become tired as well.  They are still true to themselves, but since the plot/story line is draggimg, the characters seem whiney, repetiitve, and even tiresome at times.<br />However, I do care about them and am patiently waiting for things to pick-up, and will most likely keep watching.<br />Kira
B009MYAQK4|3.0|The premise is engaging and Coelho's philosophy is as strong as ever but the structure of question and answer became overly repetitive.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|it's a waste! I wish I would have never downloaded it, can't find any help! This is a useless app
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The book tells the story of the war against zombies through interviews with survivors. They look back at their own experiences some years after the war. Due to the format there is of course no main character you can follow. This is not an issue in itself but it does mean that it is more difficult for the reader to attach yourself to somebody (allthough you do identify with mankind as a whole). Some stories feel like they could have been a bit longer, but overall it drew me in and I had a hard time putting it down.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was fun and challenging. I did wish for a hint option and for the music to change possibly with the closer you get to the answer.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Read a review and thought I would give this book a try.  Wow -- did not expect that ending.<br />Liked William Landay's style -- going back and forth between then and now!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I have been working with several types of motorcycle helmet speaker setups. I had no luck until I used this small amp into a bluetooth clip-on. Mounted both on my helmet and plugged into my helmet speakers. Now I bluetooth from my iphone 4 into the helmet clip and WOW!!!! what great sound. Riding never sounded so good. I did this all for less then $60.00 for Fiio, speakers and bluetooth clip. I can get on and off the bike without wire worries. This amp boosted the sound just enough so I have the extra volume I needed. The bonus was it also made the songs crisper.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|First off, this is an excellent horror film. Yes, it's formulaic, but part of the greatness of horr its ability to breath inside the formula. Evil Dead 2013 does that in spades. It takes a standard horror story, and puts a good number of twists on it. The spin of a cold-turkey kicking of a drug habit to keep them in the cabin once the blood starts flowing is a great idea. Excellent tension maintained throughout, and surprisingly well-acted, and some deeply unsettling gags. I can still hear the sound of glass slowly cutting through flesh.<br /><br />Something that needs to be clarified: This is a remake of the original 1981 \\"The Evil Dead\\", which is a straight-forward horror film, and not the far campier and self-aware \\"Evil Dead 2\\" from 1987. The Evil Dead was a creepy, slow-burn through it's first act and a half, only to have all hell break loose later on, but it still wasn't near as gonzo as the mini-remake of Evil Dead 2.<br /><br />A lot of people are going into this newest addition to the franchise hoping for the macabre levity of the second film, only the be disappointed with the strictness to which  ED 2013 sticks to standard horror.  Realize that you're in for a gruesome ride with very little levity once the action really starts, and you'll be just fine.  Very little \\"funny\\" about this flick.
B005SDMDRW|3.0|I just like Michael's language of 'immediacy.'  I would recommend this Harry Bosch adventure to anyone who likes a good detective thriller.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John green, I hate you. Mainly for two reasons:<br />one, you killed me with this book<br />Two, this book ended<br />I have read this book countless times and it has torn me to pieces and reduced me to tears every time.<br />Not only is the plot vastly richer than 81% coco dark chocolate, but also the style of writing is border line poetic. The characters are . Beautifully flawed and fitting to this literary masterpiece. I'd say that this novel is perfect, but perfection is an incorrect concept. I have read every novel John green has published and this is by far the best. I applaud your creativity and style. Thank you for this glorious work of literature
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this season of Lost. I watched the series as it aired on tv, but was left feeling confused at the end of it. It was a complicated storyline. Watching the entire series on Amazon was awesome. I was able to catch so much that had gone over my head the 1st one around. Amazon Prime is proving to be one of the best investments I have ever made. Thanks Amazon.:-)
B00C33M2EE|5.0|If you never heard of them and love instrumental music, look them up on YouTube then buy this CD.<br /><br />You won't regret it :).
B002PEP4C8|5.0|It was a very real and honest book. I admire the authors guts to tell the whole world what horrible things she has been through. Id was also written in a very visual language.
B0069JBKHI|1.0|Ok, the good.  During the day, the quality of the video is great, and the sound quality is better than any other baby monitor I've seen or heard.  I also liked that it comes with a built in temperature and humidity sensor, which is a smart idea, and more baby monitors should incorporate this.<br /><br />Things I hated about this product:<br /><br />1. On the first night of using it, I accidentally left my wifi turned off on my iPhone.  I left the app open and running, and I ended up streaming 16 GB of data over the course the night.  16 GIGABYTES.  Luckily I have an unlimited data plan, if my wife had made the same mistake, it would have cost her somewhere on the order of $15,000 in overage charges based on her data plan.<br /><br />2. The night vision is horrible.  I can barely make my daughter out, and for several hours, couldn't tell her head from her stuffed bunny.  It's surprising how terrible the night vision is, considering this is a high end product.<br /><br />3. This device CONSTANTLY spams you with notifications and alerts.  Mostly, \\"Monitoring of your baby has ended.\\", followed in two minutes by \\"You can now monitor your baby.\\"  (Apparently, whenever it loses the wifi signal for a second, you need to know right away, and end up getting two alerts.)  When I wake up in the morning, I'll usually have between 8 and 12 alerts, so I have to mute my phone if I want to sleep, which defeats the purpose of a baby monitor.  Note, this is after I disabled all of the alerts I could - you can configure alerts for sound in the room, movement in the room, temperature and humidity.  I turned all of these off because otherwise you get 20 alerts an hour, and even with those off, I get alerts all the damn time.  If my wife accidentally leaves the monitor on after my daughter's nap, I get spammed with dozens of alerts in the afternoons at work.  This is extremely annoying.<br /><br />4. There is a small status bar at the bottom of the screen that you can't move or get rid of.  Unfortunately, the way our room is set up, there is no way for us to position the camera so this bar is not at least partially obscuring our daughter when she sleeps.<br /><br />5. The video is very choppy most of the time, and usually more like a series of photos every few seconds.  Also, there is a noticeable delay, often as much as five seconds between what is happening on the camera and what is actually happening in the room.<br /><br />In general, this product feels half baked, and like it was released in a beta version.  It wouldn't take much for this to turn into a great product, but it's definitely not there yet.  I hated this baby monitor, and returned it to the store after around 10 days.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|It grab me from the first word! really like the narrative...i enjoyed the movie, but the book is much better by far!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was very sad to read but it also made you take a look at your own life and be grateful for what you do have. The ending was my favorite part so beautiful and tragic. Great read!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|yeah this. app is ok I don't know why everyone loves it. although I am addicted to it when I am bored everything is better when you are. bored
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I love it very much. It is give it is very well written and very interesting. It is hard to put it down. I give it ******
B004NSULHM|5.0|Any Radiohead fan will want this to add to their collection - can't really add much more than that -
B007QPFGJW|3.0|I've loved the previous Hole stories but this one was beyond depressing.  Everyone is corrupt, a pusher and/or addict. It's extremely well written as are they all, but the extreme physical injuries seem implausible for even someone like Hole to endure. At one point he even sews up a gaping knife wound to his neck with a needle and thread.  I guess I need a break from Harry Hole for a while.
B008FOB124|5.0|they continue to create great music - showcases both their individual visions, and their work as a dynamic team - long live DCD
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Wow, what a journey this book took me on! Delightful, poetic, nostalgic, and full of wonder and magic. I was sucked into the story at the first sentence, and reluctantly finished it at the end. It is an enjoyable story about being a kid and experiencing wonder and magic through a seven year old's eyes.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Why they decided to drop this series is a mystery to us all.  This has everything we want in a TV series, and the clever writing and extraordinary acting is what we all crave.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|justice is not always visible to the outsider, everyone deserves representation in the legal system, Matthew McConaughey portrayed this key role well, enjoyed the ending and ultimate justice
B004B63M1S|5.0|Machete starts off with what appears to be the rescue of a woman, but not the case.  She part of a plan to get Machette. Three years, Machete goes out for revenge and Steven Seagal and Robert De Niro had better watch their steps. Machete has plenty of action.  IT IS ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIES FROM 2010. It took me three years to finally see this film and it was worth the wait. Robert Rodriguez does it again and I can't wait for the sequel.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|This charcoal starter worked great over our last camping trip following the directions.  Had another starter a couple years ago that was not reliable and often required a lot more paper to get the coals going.  This one worked everytime with the original 2 pieces of newspaper and the charcoal was ready to use in 10-15 minutes for cooking with the dutch oven.
1594744769|5.0|One of the most unique and intriguing books I have ever read.  The strange pictures and the text compliment each other wonderfully.  Good plot movement throughout, without dead spots.  Enough character development that the reader becomes invested in the characters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyrd this game it wad fun and challenging I recommend it to all. I cannot wait until the developers create new rooms with updated features.
140006922X|4.0|[...]<br /><br />I haven't read this book, but the above link is a very comprehensive review of the book, particularly the more controversial parts.<br /><br />she makes some fascinating points and now I can't wait to read the book.<br /><br />I am a devout Christian, btw.  I'd probably have never heard of this book if FOX's ridiculous interview with Aslan hadn't gone viral.  Now I want to read everything by him.  Such grace under utter insanity.<br /><br />BTW...calling Jesus a \\"Zealot\\" is not an insult if one knows the true historical definition and not the slang definition of the word.<br /><br />And from the Amazon page on Dr. Aslan:  \\"Reza Aslan was educated at Harvard, where he was elected president of Harvard's chapter of the World Conference on Religion and Peace, a UN organisation committed to global understanding. Currently teaching an introductory course on Islam at the University of Iowa, Aslan is also at work on a novel.\\"
