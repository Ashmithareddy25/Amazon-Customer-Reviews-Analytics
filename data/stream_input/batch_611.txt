B000G759LW|4.0|So far, Christina Aguilera is setting herself up to be the new generation's Madonna in terms of taking chances with her musical directions and re-inventing herself with each album. We've seen her go from cookie-cutter pop star, to a \\"stripped\\" down diva. Now, she's taken on a classic star of yester-year, and you know what? She pulls it off.<br /><br />\\"Back to Basics\\" is a good album. Yeah, it's not like anything on the radio or what's popular today, but that's it's main strength. This two-cd whammy brings forth sounds and influences from artists of the past and yet blends it with a modern day twist. There is something for everyone on this release. She shows off her vocal abilities on tracks like \\"Hurt\\" and \\"Oh Mother\\". Remember her rather shocking, \\"in your face\\" attitude on \\"Stripped\\"? That's still present in songs like \\"Still Dirrty\\" and \\"F.U.S.S.\\"<br /><br />This was a gamble on her part, but I think she comes out the true victor. This is actual good music, unlike a lot of stuff that's considered popular today. Her lyrics are thought out and well written; she can be sexually provactive on one track and then sing about love and relationships in a tender, loving manner. Then she can really put her personal life on display and make you feel the emotion and heart ache on a track like \\"The Right Man\\" and \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray.\\"<br /><br />Take a chance on Aguilera's latest cd. It's not pop or what you'd expect from someone who emerged from the pop era along acts like Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson and Mandy Moore. Aguilera, with this release, propells herself into the more mature, adult singer and star arena. Definitely worth your money and a listening to.

0375414053|4.0|i'll make this short.  this is as witty as one can expect it to be,  but it may also give you a headache to read about kate's life which is why i gave it four stars instead of five.  humorous, ridiculous, and for the light-hearted.  the ending seemed kind of bland to me after all the \\"drama\\" throughout the book.  if you're a person that can laugh at the misfortunes of yourself and others, you will probably enjoy this.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Somewhere amongst the miriad of sci-fi movies and super-hero misadventures I think Sky Captain got lost in the the foray. At first viewing all I could think of was this movie is beating video game air adventure \\"Crimson Skies\\" to the big screen. Where as Crimson Skies is set in an alternate future Sky Captain is set in the past looking towards the future. Granted it's not grounded in any reality but at the same time I think that is one of the reasons why the movie works so well to begin with. To enjoy a fantasy film dont you want to be taken somewhere fantastic? Somewhere thats not just down the street but worlds away?<br /><br />I felt like I was watching all of the classic sci-fi adventures of the past rolled into one. Generations before \\"my time\\" many of the old movie serials must have held kids captive as they waited for the next adventure of Flash Gordon and the like. Those old serials had the best simple plots and just allowed the viewer to be awe struck and captivated by the exploits of the daring hero. Sky Captain not only has that element but an amazing contemporary feel.  Its painted so well digitally that it looks amazing and actually gets better looking as the movie goes on.<br /><br />Aside from the awesome visual appearance of the film Jude Law and Gweneth Paltrow give typical warm charismatic performances. Joe and Polly are as striking together as Lois and Superman. So many films of this kind get lost in the over the top SFX, but these elements are backdropped by Polly and Joes love story smartly written but not overplayed or sappy. An ingredient without which all the effects in the world are meaningless. I like how Angelina Jolie's \\"Franky\\" throws in the competitive element for Paltrows \\"Polly\\".<br /><br />All of this happens so well and so tightly Its the kind of movie that for me, I would have hoped for a sequel. Perhaps it stands best as a single film and thats perfectly ok too. I also like that its not overly violent, offensive, or sexual in any way. It makes it virtually ok for any audience at all.<br /><br />I give Sky Captain 5 stars because it fits every aspect of an enjoyable movie for me. Good cast, good love story, good SFX, not too long in length, and first and foremost its the realization of one mans vision which I personally respect.in any way.

B000FFJYCU|4.0|Yes, the plot of the movie is not for the true manly man. But for those guys who are true racing fans, this is the movie to have. I think it is the best racing movie ever made.  Now that it can watched on DVD with Dolby 5.1, just makes it so much more enjoyable. The racing scenes are great and it really captures the atmosphere of formula 1 racing back in it's golden years.  This is a must have DVD for the true racing enthusiast. <br />Nobody has been able to make a movie that even begins to approach the realism of racing like Frankenheimer did.  I believe it would be near impossible for a director today to make a formula 1 racing movie in the now commercialized \\"Eccelstone\\" era.
1567184855|4.0|One of the few books that gives you a sense of what our soul's purpose is, in the life and in past lives. The only negative I can come up with is that the reader will not really have a sense of what 'heaven' is like. It all seems rather cold and void-like. However, according to the cases hypnotized, it will not really matter. What will matter is who meets and greets us when we cross over, and who we finally end up as our main group of friends/students/guides that journey with us into eternity.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie was visually stunning and I thought very well acted. <br /> <br />Portman is really turning into a great actress. And the supporting characthers were very human and believable. The characther V....wow! His voice and flowing eloquence was goregous to listen too. <br /> <br />I was astounded at how timely this movie was....terroism, taking away of our liberties, thinking giving away our rights gives us saftey when it doesn't. Made up \\"fears\\" and \\"terrors\\" to keep the masses in line.  <br /> <br />The ending was magnificent!
B00002E23E|5.0|This DVD rocks. I would have like some special features though. It does not do it justice. Hopefully one day they will bring one out. Back to the movie: Makes you appreciate how amazing this band really was - way ahead of their time. Led Zeppelin is the standard and no one these days has come close. These pussy record companies are aiming music at 14 year old girls so gone are the guitar heroes. These days it's all all those IDOL CRY BABY shows and other such crap. BUY THIS DVD AND BE IN AWE. It is timeless and epic. I give it 5 out of 5 !
1567184855|5.0|This book is interesting reading to say the least.  It definitely gives you something to think about when searching for a reason to be on this planet.  I believe we are all inter connected and there is more out there.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This DVD is the best music DVD available! These days, it is hard to find rock heroes but in this DVD you will see the standard of rock. (NOT LIKE ALL THE CRAP YOU HEAR ON RADIO AND THOSE CRY BABY IDOL SHOWS) You get to see how good Led Zeppelin Really were. I play this DVD to bits. Sad though that Led Zep avoided being filmed and this DVD and the other DVD (song remains the same) is pretty much the only footage available. I bet they regret that now. If I had to make a fault; it goes a little bit overboard faking bootleg footage during the acoustic session. They make it look like someone is filming from the audience but i would rather see footage that is real. Anyway, you have to buy this DVD. You will not regret it!

0060254920|5.0|My son had me read this so many times that within a week my husband and I could both recite the entire story from memory, which we had to do several times when he (my son) was still restless and fidgety after \\"lights out.\\" He still pretends he's Max, or he pretends he's a Wild Thing and \\"shows his terrible claws\\". (We dramatize it as we read it.) He loves to read Max's part, and gleefully points his finger in the air and shouts \\"Let the wild rumpus start!\\" <br /> <br />One day when I dropped him off at daycare, as we sat in the kitchen area with crackers and juice, he listened to all his classmates running around and playing just out of eyesight, and said to me \\"I hear a wild rumpus!\\"  <br /> <br />Books like this really spark the imagination, and it's just written so beautifully and simply.  <br /> <br />There is also a wonderful version of this book on DVD with music written by Peter Shipley (also known as P.D.Q. Bach) and read by him as well. There's actually a number of stories on the DVD, and the great thing is you can choose just one story, and it's maybe 5 minutes long, and then it STOPS. So it's perfect to pop in when you need just a few more minutes in the morning to get your kid's lunch ready, and you don't have to tear them away from the TV. (Also perfect in the evening, because you can say \\"Just one more video, then up to bed.\\")
0316166685|4.0|They say that a ghost remains tied to the world of the living either to avenge its death or to comfort those left behind. The heroine of Alice Sebold's haunting, sweet novel \\"The Lovely Bones\\" isn't out for revenge, but her ties to the living family and friends make debut an amazing, uplifting story.<br /><br />Susie Salmon is dead. On a day like any other, she was raped and brutally murdered by a seemingly harmless neighbor, who hacked up her body and buried it. Now she exists in a surprisingly simple and pleasant heaven, watching her family and friends after she vanished, and watching their lives unfold even after hers has ended.<br /><br />Her parents cling to hope that even though a lot of blood and part of an arm has been found, that Susie is still alive. But eventually, they must give up hope. Susie watches the police investigate her death, while her father pokes around to find out whodunnit. And just as importantly her family and friends stumble through the various stages of grief, trying to deal with a horrible, senseless crime that has touched each of them.<br /><br />When someone is kidnapped and/or murdered, the news usually focuses on the criminals and the gory details. Not much attention is given to the victims and the lives they once led, or how their loves ones are dealing with the tragedy. Other books would be self-conscious or miserable dealing with that kind of story, but \\"Lovely Bones\\" is something very different.<br /><br />Instead, this book possesses a quiet, comforting tone and a poetic style, which sometimes gets bogged in its own detail, but is beautiful nonetheless. Sebold's writing has an innocent charm; one enchanting scene has Susie trying to make a flower bloom for her father, and filling a celestial room with flower petals instead.<br /><br />The only really gritty scene is the rape-and-murder, which is all the more shocking when you realize that things like this happen in real life. And Sebold paints the characters' grief and shock with a light hand, so that it never feels sentimental. It has the hollow ache of real grief, transcribed with more skill than more authors can manage.<br /><br />Susie herself is a truly unique character, a narrator completely removed from the events she describes, and yet so wrapped up in the people she loves, and has left behind. And Sebold explores the many characters as they go through the grieving process, with different thoughts and actions as they try to deal with it. The parents, the siblings, the teachers, and even the kid who was enamored of Susie.<br /><br />Alice Sebold's \\"Lovely Bones\\" shocks you at the beginning, and spends the rest of the book drying your tears.

B000G759LW|5.0|Listening to DISC 1 made me feel like I should be in an old-fashioned JOOK JOINT. Christina really put her thang down on this CD. From the INTRO to THANK-YOU. Oh my God, F.U.S.S... \\"is THE BEST musically\\". Just listen to the piano. The organ. That song is.... \\"just damn\\". WITHOUT YOU... \\"is so pretty\\". STILL DIRTY... is \\"very well put\\". HERE TO STAY... \\"again, very well put\\". She's going to REALLY see who the haters are with these CDs because they're ALL going to wish that they had her TALENT and PRODUCERS, but they DON'T have the same talent that she has. I mean listen to her first CD CHRISTINA AGUILERA she had a strong voice then and it's just become stronger and more powerful over the years. DISC 2.... \\"Oh my God Christina. I felt like I had gone back in time with that one as well\\". THE RIGHT MAN.... I was almost in tears listening to this song. She and the choir harmonize in the most angelic way. It shows in this song how much she's in love... FINALLY. Christina, Thank you for taking your time to put this double CD together. We've been needing a CD from you for a while and this was WELL WORTH THE WAIT. I guess that's what they mean by that old saying, \\"ALL GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT\\".
B00005JKLZ|3.0|Well I was wondering if they could try to re-create this classic and still make it great.  Well it is good and the special effects are great but the story line is missing something or is it the actors.  Now don't get me wrong, this is a very entertaining film and I purchased it, so that says something.  I do like the interaction at the end with Guy Pearce and the Albino Morlock (can't remember his name right now).   <br /> <br />Good movie to buy and keep, its in my collection.

Haha naw, Lucas killed the magic long ago but at least I'll have the 'original' version of Star Wars again. Or at least as original as it'll ever be. I'll throw away my special editions thats for sure, set fire to them in my driveway.<br /><br />George Lucas has held me by the ankles and grabbed the money he shook out of my pockets many many times. This will be the last time.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Chan-wook Park is one of the great directors in the business today. There have been many great reviews of this film, and you need to see it if you have not already. I saw this film before I viewed any of the other ones in the trilogy. \\"Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance\\" was my favorite, but this middle film in the trilogy comes in a close second. It is a very deeply disturbing film, and I would not let young minds watch it. The character Oh-Dae-su, (Min-sik Choi) gives an outstanding and riveting performance in this film. As the films narrative begins, the protagonist, Oh-Dae-su, is kidnapped while making a phone call to his wife and daughter. The film then veers to what appears to be a run-down hotel. Only this is not like any hotel you would want spend the night in. He is kept in isolation, and is given a diet of dumplings. As the days turn to weeks, the weeks to months, and the months to years, we witness Oh-Dae-su age. But why is he here? Why is he being held captive?<br /><br />Oh-Dae-Su does not know why this is happening to him. Who could do such a terrible thing? And more importantly, why? This bothers Oh-Dae-Su as well, and he begins to write down ALL of the names of people he feels he has wronged in the past. No matter how trivial the transgression may seem. In the meanwhile, he attempts the insurmountably long and arduous task of trying to escape, by chiseling his way through the wall of his room with an extra eating utensil that he was accidentally given on his eating tray. But this will take many years. With a TV set to keep him company and the always constant meal of dumplings, he finally awakens one day in a suitcase on the top of a building. He has been kept in isolation for 15 years.<br /><br />Moreover, when he is released into the world there have been many changes in not only the world around him, but in his personal life as well. But, these changes in his personal life are intentional. The antagonist Woo-Jin Lee (Ji-tae Yu) who was responsible for having locked up Oh-Dae-su has a purpose. There was a reason for the number of years why he was imprisoned. And this is where the film takes on a revenge that will shock you. Oh-Dae-su is given a cell phone and a wallet with money. The antagonist Lee tells Oh-Dae-su that he has 5 days to discover why he was locked up. And thus begins a search by Oh-Dae-su to discover not only the identity of his captor, but why he was locked up. I do not wish to spoil this great film for you, therefore, I will not write further. However, the film is terrifically written, directed and acted. This is a must see. Highly recommended. [Stars: 5+]h-Dae-su has a purpose.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|You know those nights when you're at the video store, and it seems like you've a) seen everything b) only things you haven't seen are movies you couldn't be paid enough to watch?  Tonight was one of those nights. <br /> <br />Fortunately, I remembered hearing that Liev Schreiber's directorial debut film, 'Everything Will Be Illuminated' was a worthwhile watch.  I had been hesitant to watch it because, frankly, the cover image creeped me out, making me think of Elijah Wood's gruesomely freaky character in 'Sin City' - a strange and unfortunate cover choice for this movie. <br /> <br />The film was actually superb, and the cover was indeed ill-chosen, for it reflected none of the lovely naturalism of the film itself. Elijah Wood plays a young man, who collects things that remind him of his family. After his grandfather passes, he travels to Ukraine to attempt to find the Shtetl his grandfather left only a week before the Nazi occupation. I don't want to say anything more about the plot, not to ruin the discovery for anyone who hasn't seen it. <br /> <br />In short, the movie is artfully and deftly crafted - the director's touch seems so light, one feels like events are really unfolding. The actors, who are all excellent, never seem to be 'acting', and the script is not the usual heavy-handed let's-spoon-feed-and-finger-point-to-our-audience schlock. Schreiber lets the unspoken speak louder than words, and captures the fragile and vivid emotions of his characters. I've always said that the mark of a good writer is that he treats all his characters with tenderness--the entire movie is created with just such love and beauty of spirit. There is even a wonderful dog, \\"Sammy Davis Jr., Jr.,\\" who is a storyteller in her own right, played by Mickey and Mouse, top dog actors if you ask me. <br /> <br />So some night when you wonder which movie you should get, take this one. It is all-round exquisite.
B000000WF0|5.0|This album is a masterpiece!Most albums start out promising, then about three songs into it we lose interest and...turn it off.This album will surprise you,it get's better towards the end,\\"Neon Wilderness\\" is more of an intermission than an actual song,so you can't actually count that as a song,although I'm sure that there are some over zealous Verve fans out there that do,and that's ok.From the opening, soothing string arrangement of \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony\\" our hearts are held captive,then the whooshing rush of the full orchestra crashes in (this part,by the way,is the sample that Richard Ashcroft used and had to share writing credits with Jagger and Richards)and we are hooked without a doubt, to this beautiful song.\\"Sonnet\\" is a touching ballad about friendship,\\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" isn't a song about drug abuse as the title may seem to impose,rather it's a moving ballad that Ashcroft wrote about the death of his father,it's difficult to listen to this song and not think of a loved one who has passed on.\\"Lucky Man\\" is a brilliant song that Ashcroft dedicates to his wife when he performs it live.Simply put,every song on this album is a gem.Go out and buy this album now.Enjoy!
B000EDWKXI|3.0|In this fast-paced historical spoof, Heath Ledger takes the part of Casanova, a man infamous for his womanizing ways. It seems no woman in Venice can resist him. But eventually his luck runs out and Casanova finds himself with a choice: either he must find himself a respectable wife by the time Carnivale rolls around, or he will be exiled from the city. He quickly arranges a betrothal to a girl well-known as the most virginal of virgins, and then promptly falls in love with another woman - the only woman, it seems, who simply won't have him. Francesca (Sienna Miller) is a woman ahead of her time, writing feminist literature under a male nom de plume, and she detests everything Casanova stands for. However, under a false name, Casanova does mange to woo Fancesca, only to have everything fall once more into disarray when her own betrothed - a corpulent lard merchant whom she has never met (Oliver Platt) - shows up to claim his bride.<br /><br />The biggest mistake one can make is to take this movie too seriously. It is a mindless spoof and nothing more, and going into it with expectations of a period drama will only leave the viewer disappointed. Unfortunately, I found myself somewhat disappointed anyway. Even knowing that the film is intended as a comedy, I could not find the sequence of events even remotely plausible. Many of the plot twists are just too off-the-wall to wrap one's head around, despite efforts to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />And worse, none of the characters seemed to display any real chemistry with one another. No reason - not even a ridiculous one - is given for why Casanova falls for Francesca instead of any of the many, many women he could easily have had. And there is little more reason for Francesca's eventually reciprocating the sentiment, and it is especially hard to fathom her almost immediate forgiveness once she discovers Casanova's true identity. He has seduced almost every woman in Venice, and now she finds that he has been courting HER under a false name, yet, with almost no deliberation, decides that she loves and trusts him anyway and that he is worth dying for. I just couldn't buy it. Even less could I buy the \\"love at first sight\\" scenario between Francesca's mother and the man Francesca's is supposed to be betrothed to. If only the characters had displayed genuine chemistry, all the far-fetched plot twists could have been more easily overlooked in favor of the human element of the story. But they did not, and I found it difficult to truly care for any of them. Though I am a fan of Heath Ledger, I found this to be one of his more disappointing films.<br /><br />Unfortunately I did not have time to watch the special features - director commentary, featurettes, and extended scenes - before returning the movie (having watched this as a rental), and cannot comment on their quality.ame, yet, with almost no deliberation, decides that she loves and trusts him anyway and that he is worth dying for.

0446608955|5.0|\\"A Walk to Remember,\\" I think is the one of the best books I've ever read. It has taught me a lot about the importance of life and the people in it. I've learned many life lessons, for example you shouldn't \\"judge a book by its cover,\\" meaning that you should get to really know someone before you can say something that you don't even really know.In this book, Landon shows that at first he judges Jamie by the outside, but after getting know her he realizes what a great person she is and eventually falls in love with her. I think that you should accept people for who they are, and just know that everyone's unique in their own way. In this book I've also realized that you should always live life to the fullest, because you never know when your time is up.Jamie, was an example in this book that shows that you should live your life the best way you can, when she does actually does all the things on her list, and still lives her life as if she didn't even know she was dying.Overall, I think this book taught be that you should live each day as your last, and that you should never assume things about people without even knowing them.
B000FOQ0TG|2.0|I love the original album. One of my favorites of all time. But this is a sorry excuse for a DVD package. I just don't understand why they didn't redo the music for the videos.  Mono sound? Give me a break!  How hard could it possibly be?  They're probably planning on redoing it again with stereo or 5.1 in some super deluxe package so I have to buy it again!  And the live album isn't that good either. I have every version this came out on, including the Livecrime CD version from way back. If you have that, I really don't see the need to buy this.    Stick with the remastered CD and don't bother with this.  Or better yet, save your money and buy the Revolution Calling box set and you'll get all of their EMI remastered albums.  You can get it through a CD club for less than half the amazon price and it's a better value than this.
0141301066|5.0|This book is very influential. When i first read the book i figured out that as i read it the message of the story was thereare no limits to learning and when you do the power of reading and knowledge will be so strong that it will seem as if you had superpowers. I learned that there is no limit to learning and no matter how hard i seems to real your goals go for it. The style of the book is diction. As Mathilda is a little girl growing up she finds out she has a major interest for books wile her family spends their time watching T.V. She has a powerful mind and finds out she can move things telepathically. I dont need to tell you the ending because you can read it yourself.

0553801503|2.0|I read all four books in this series in about a month. And I loved the first 3, but this one seems like filler. All my favorite charactors are virtually missing. I'm gonna read the next one with the hopes that it will improve.<br />If you're looking for the best fantasy series, I'd recommend Steven Erickson.
B00005NKKZ|3.0|If you're feeling nostalgic, there are 4 pretty great songs on this cd by the undeniably great Paul Simon with his ex harmony partner Art Garfunkel.(Cecilia, If I Could, The Boxer, Bridge Over Trubled Water). The Only Boy in Town is pretty good too. The rest is dated and forgetable. Also the quality of musical recording has evolved so much that it's hard to go back. So if you love those particular songs enough to buy the whole cd then go for it. A much better buy though is Paul Simon's new cd SURPRISE. The whole cd will just blow you away. He is not afraid of evolving and progressing. SURPRISE is a real gift.
0553573403|5.0|Great book, but this series seems to be weakening as it goes along. I dug the first 3 books but the 4th is a clunker. If you want to read the best fantasy series out there that actually gets better as it goes along, pick up Steven Erickson's Malazan Books of the Fallen series.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White is simply a milestone in the history of film making. It is one of those films that has ploughed a course through motion picture history, throwing off as it does so, bits and pieces that have been seized upon by later film makers, and turned into ideas and projects of their own. Many of today's film makers will cite this film as being a major early influence on their careers.<br /><br />Even today, the film's ability to generate emotion is unique on any media. It can still tug on the heart strings after repeat viewings. This comes down to characterisation, be it of Snow White herself, the animals that help her, or the Seven Dwarves.<br /><br />All are superbly realised and engage the audience accordingly. Maybe the strength of the Dwarves is that Disney filled their characters with many recognisable human traits, both strong and weak. Audiences could identify with them accordingly.<br /><br />Annoyingly, the character of Dopey has come under attack from the politically correct for allegedly demeaning people with learning difficulties etc. I would counter that with it is a depiction of someone with difficulties getting on with his life, enjoying it in the process, and being actively supported by his peers, who in very human terms, sometimes express impatience etc with him.<br /><br />As to the other dwarves, I think we can all recognise something of ourselves, our friends, and our relatives in all of them. Hence the fact that they are so engaging.<br /><br />The songs from the film have gained immortality and deservedly so. Despite not being a fan of musicals myself, this particular score is truly something else, and I still love it after all this time.<br /><br />Evil is starkly depicted in this tale in the form of the vain and envious Queen. Once she realises that her own beauty has been surpassed by that of Snow White then she goes all out to kill her. Is it any coincidence that as she becomes ever more murderous and vindictive, her outward appearance starts to match that within? Shortly after deciding to kill Snow White, she becomes the hideous witch, and her subsequent behaviour matches her looks.<br /><br />Her fate is particularly unpleasant but the morality of the tale is that her own deeds and actions ultimately bring it upon herself. There are no grey areas - the message is that evil ultimately brings evil upon the perpetrator.<br /><br />Ultimately this film has gained a wide ranging recognition as one of the greatest films ever made and deservedly so.<br /><br />I am fortunate enough to own one of the Platinum Edition dvds. Picture and sound are superb, in particluar the 5.1 transfer is stunning.<br /><br />If you can get hold of one of these dvds, then my advice is to buy it.

B000G75AE8|1.0|I guess Slayer has joined the ranks of nearly every metal and rock band. Nothing but a bunch of anti-American, liberal B.S.  <br />I mean, good grief, there song jihad... you'd think by slayer being an American metal band they would rip apart osma or some machmoud, mohammed or whatever. But no, of course not. The last line in that song is \\"when you have reached ground zero you will have killed the enemy, the great satan.\\" For any of you that don't know, \\"the great satan\\" is what Iran, and any other mohammed country, calls America. So F slayer... they missed the calling. I, however, did not.

B000AL730O|4.0|By 2005, Paul McCartney's place in music history was long cemented. Whether you look at McCartney's work with the Beatles, Wings, or even as a solo artist - he really doesn't have much more to prove.   There was even that time in the mid-1980s when McCartney's solo career hit a bump in the road both critically and professionally - then thanks to a songwriting partnership with Elvis Costello, McCartney bounced back with his magnificent effort \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\".  Upon proving he could launch the comeback, McCartney didn't fade into oblivion.    So now we reach 2005 and McCartney at 63 years of age is clearly an \\"elder statesman\\" of Rock.     It had been almost four years from McCartney's previous effort, \\"Driving Rain\\".    That album while getting strong reviews did not do well commercially.  So in a way, McCartney had another comeback to make - and now in his mid-60s, this seemed difficult.     This latest comeback would be 2005's \\"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\\".  \\"Chaos and Creation\\" isn't the hard-rocking album that one would expect to be needed to make a comeback, but one that demonstrates a \\"kinder/gentler\\" Paul.     The result - while not nearly in the league of \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" is still satisfying and helped McCartney return to the level of critical and commercial success that he was accustomed to. <br /> <br />As mentioned this album reflects a \\"kinder/gentler\\" Paul.  It is not a hard rocking album at all.   You aren't going to hear heavy guitar riffs.  The songs are soft and in a way many may consider this the norm for someone in their mid-60s - yet let's keep in mind that this is  McCartney we are talking about.. The titles of the tracks clearly reflect this theme: \\"How Kind are You\\", \\"Jenny Wren\\", \\"At the Mercy\\", \\"English Tea\\", and \\"A Certain Softness\\" - all show an examples of this theme.   Many of the tracks that don't follow this theme still have this soft and gentle feel to it.   Now just because the music is softer doesn't mean the musicis weak.   McCartney integrates some of his strongest arrangements that we have seen in recent years.   We see the use of instruments such as the Triangle, Flugelhorn, Cello, Harmonium, Glockenspiel as well as String and Brass ensembles.   On top of that, McCartney does one of his most ambitious solo efforts to date - playing the lion's share of the instruments (but doesn't do a \\"full solo\\" effort like Phil Collins did on \\"Both Sides\\" - yet he comes pretty close).    While McCartney does make use of the acoustic guitar - he doesn't overdo it.   I consider that a good thing since much of today's music scene is already oversaturated with that sound.    <br /> <br />Part of what helped McCartney make his comeback with \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" is when he brought some fresh new producers to work with himself and longtime producer George Martin (Trevor Horn, Neil Dorfsman, Chris Hughes, Elvis Costello were the main ones).   These producers provided McCartney with an objective perspective on his music.   While McCartney has certainly had the creative juices flowing since \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\", he still brought in Nigel Godrich to be the sole producer - even taking himself out of the equation.    This approach most likely helped McCartney push himself harder than ever - even in the twilight of his career.  Perhaps this is what helped him regain some commercial success as well with \\"Chaos and Creation\\". <br /> <br />The album's strongest tracks are actually found toward the end of the collection - namely the last three tracks.  \\"Promise to the Girl\\" is the eleventh track and a very good track.    It starts out slow, then segues into the album's fastest paced track.    Much of the track does have a Beatles feel to it.    Paul's use of both the Piano and Grand Piano in a fast-paced manner are really going to help this track shine.      The track that follows might is not only the album's strongest track, but perhaps McCartney's strongest work in over a decade - that track is \\"This Never Happened Before\\".    This is a soft song that really is highlighted by Paul's vocals.  These vocals are calming and reassuring in this classic McCartney love ballad.    The song deals with McCartney finding love and realizing what a good thing it is - compared to being alone.   Overall, \\"This Never Happened Before\\" is a Home Run.  I'm surprised this didn't get much more airplay on radio - yet I'm not surprised considering the poor state of conventional radio play lists.   The final track is \\"Anyway\\" - this track is highlighted by some terrific piano work.   It is worth noting that on \\"Anyway\\", there is a hidden instrumental track that follows called \\"I've Only Got Two Hands\\".   This instrumental is appropriate considering the wide variety of instrumentation that is demonstrated on this album.   The instrumental starts out similar to the feel of the track's opener \\"Fine Line\\", but then segues into first a bluesy, then a classical, and then a psychedelic feel.   Overall this instrumental is sheer brilliance.   On a side note, \\"Fine Line\\" is also a very good track.   <br /> <br />Other good tracks worth considering are \\"How Kind of You\\", \\"A Certain Softness\\", \\"Too Much Rain\\", \\"Follow Me\\",  and the folksy \\"Jenny Wren\\". <br /> <br />There is one track \\"English Tea\\" that I have to be critical about.   This track almost has the feel for a radio jingle as opposed to a McCartney song.    This isn't meant to be a knock on the song.   Because it has a jingle feel, it is also an addictive track - one that will stick in your head. <br /> <br />The lyrics to the collection are included in the liner notes - as well as the instrumental credits for each of the songs.   At the time of the write-up, it's hard to determine where these songs will stack up in the overall portfolio of McCartney's work.    However, this is still one album definitely with high musicianship and worth checking out.
1401302378|4.0|It gave me some things to think about, but nothing in the book was \\"ground breaking\\" news. <br /> <br />I think he is going to wake up some business managers,advertising executives, and others just out of touch with the way consumers spend time, consume media, and entertain themselves. <br /> <br />I think this will be much more intresting to people who spend less time shopping online, using itunes, and that own a DVR.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is definitely the album of the year. Who would have thought Christina could go from a pop tart, to a rebellious young lady, to a demure grown woman? This album showcases Christina's voice exactly like it is: at her best! Just listen to \\"Mercy On Me\\", \\"Save Me From Myself\\" and \\"Hurt\\". I will not be surprised if this album picks up a few Grammy's next year.
B000G759LW|3.0|Finally, Christina is back! Unlike her popstar peers, she has come back in the scene with an album that she actually put her heart and soul into. Unfortunately, I'm a bit mixed about this album. I give her 3 stars because this album, which at first appears to be a testament to jazz/blues music, quickly becomes to weighted with Christina's egotism, which distracts me greatly. This is not as much a jazz/blues album as Christina is making it out to be. There are a few notable tracks that are jazzy-Candy Man, Ain't No Other Man- but Back to Basics is by no means a \\"concept album,\\" and if it is, the concept is Christina Aguilera. It has plenty of soul, some great funky tracks, and a few fillers that I found quite over the top, but it has way too much of Christina's ego and self-obsession to make it a truly worth while listen. Christina tells us that she's \\"Still Dirty\\" (who knew?) and that she's \\"Here To Stay\\" (haven't we heard that before?), but that's all. It has always been unclear to me about how Christina has become who she is, and how her idols have influenced her. She always carries on about how she was a victim in the music industry, but never really explains how she has overcome it (she just keeps moping about it...).It's all about women empowerment, pride, and egotism, but nothing about expressing her growth in other terms than how she's \\"still dirty\\" and \\"here to stay.\\" In other words, her music propels her inner self, but no insight. But other than that, Christina deserves a lot of credit for making this album. To me, it's too long, too narcissistic, and too over the top. But the album, despite its flaws, is a celebration of blues, jazz, and funk, and, you guessed it, the wonderfulness of Christina Aguilera.
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|A difficult, brilliant film, \\"Brick\\" is as noir as anything written by Dashiell Hammet.  Writer/director Rian Johnson has a big future, and his next contract will probably be in the 7-8 figure bracket; Hollywood will see the movie for what it is, money in the bank.  It is difficult to equate the depth of character, motive, and experience depicted in the film with your average 20-year-old, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief, \\"Brick\\" is easy to enjoy. <br /> <br />The actors; the lead, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, imparts the gravitas of any actor in the major leagues like Pacino or De Niro, and Pin's prime enforcer, Noah Fleiss, carries off a smoldering performance reminiscent of Russell Crowe in L.A. Confidential. <br /> <br />\\"Brick\\" is certainly worth checking out just to find out what the fuss is all about; and it doesn't hurt to be in on the ground floor when Rian Johnson or Joseph Gordon-Levitt becomes the next big thing.
0375507256|4.0|This is a complex and absorbing read.  I won't repeat the plot strucure that has been explained elsewhere, but the breaking up of the several stories into sections is as much of a distinguishing feature of this book as the stories themselves.  This lectum interruptus is titillating and engaging, sometimes annoying, because the sections may be far enough apart so that one has to go back and re-read or scan the preceding segment to recall the characters and events.    That being said, the idea that there are long lines of thought and motives that recur like a long thread through hundreds of years of humanity and unite us all is nothing short of astonishing.  My one reservation is that there are some main characters in the Korea of the future segment which are not as well defined as the rest of the stories' characters.    Strongly recommended if you want to see what the writers of the best of modern literature in English are up to.
B00005JOMN|1.0|I'd been looking forward to Mann's return to MV since hearing of it - though I was disturbed to hear that Farrell would feature (after his appearence in the comedy Alexandra). Mann directed one of my favourite films - Thief (Violent Streets). <br /> <br />Unfortunately I and my wife only lasted 20 minutes of the film - the print was poor at our Cineworld venue in Stockport, with numerous black lines on either side of the print and one large one running down dead center. What was funny was listening to the cinema manager trying to persuade me that Michael Mann, using digital cameras for outside (and interior scenes?) had added these wear lines in post-production (for gritty realism apparently). When persuaded to come and have a look he immediately admitted that the print was stuffed. We got our money back just in time to hear additional complaints being reported over his walkie-talkie by staff. So much for the movie industries desire to persuade folk not to buy pirate DVD's - the cinema prints can be even worse! <br /> <br />So beware, at least one duff print of Miami Vice is about in the UK.
0375707972|4.0|I read \\"The Reader\\" after having read \\"Night\\", and although The Reader is fictionalized, it helps one understand how ignorance can  lead to  horrific, despicable, ugly, inhumane and un-human atrocities.  In this case (The Reader), it was  a Guard not knowing how to read, and thus not being able to foresee the consequences.  Hanna, the main character in The Reader, was interested only in doing a good job at work.  She was petrified that someone might discover she could neither read nor write. Thus, she did what many beings do;  she ran from the truth and wove a horrific web.  Rather than be promoted at a previous job (the streetcar company),she quit, because she knew the promotion would have required her to display reading and writing skills.  She took  a job as a Guard, and  later sent her wards to their death at Auschwitz. (Would she have done this if she could have read the note?) She even took the rap for having written a report, a report which was sure to convict her, just  to avoid confrontation with a court expert. She was willing to accept exposure as a criminal for fear of being exposed as illiterate.<br /><br />It makes you stop and think. Hanna was not anti-Semitic.  She was just trying to be something she wasn't.  If all the world -all nations -- all peoples -- simply  confessed  ignorances and got help to overcome those ignorances, we might see  world peace.  It doesn't matter whether the ignorance is outright illiteracy , or of another's religion, culture, history, background, race, creed or national origin, as long as we have the basics to  learn about each other, seems that would be a  step in the right direction.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Wow finally after years of waiting Beverly Hills 90210 has returned to it's loyal fans in DVD! The show is primarily the first four seasons about Brenda and Brandon Walsh. The teen twins from Minnesota, that have moved to the ultra posh and ritzy world of Beverly Hills with their parents. This first season basically the foundation for a series that would long surpass it's expectations. We meet not only the Walsh family, but Dylan Mckay, Donna Martin, David Silver, Aundrea Zuckerman, Steve Sanders, and Kelly Taylor. And all their trial and tribulations as teens. There is just so much that could be said for this series, but I might as well just let you see for yourself in the dvd. But anyone who saw this show the first time around knows that not only is entertaining but also realistic. A great buy for anyone that is a fan and those that wanna jump on the bandwagon for the first time. As an avid teen drama watcher in the past, I can honestly say that none can ever duplicate the magic of the first few seasons of 90210...This is going to be a great holiday buy and probably a must have on many lists...So grab a copy, pop the disk in and be prepared to go back to Beverly Hills 90210...
6305428050|4.0|Okay, so perhaps it's a bit nostalgic, but Chris Columbus has a knack for making entertaining films, with a touch of faux-darkness and typically kid-oriented.  I won't pretend that this is some artistic masterpiece, but if you're a product of the late 70's / early 80's you'll certainly enjoy this movie as much now as you did the first time.  Plus Elisabeth Shue is adorable, as if you needed much more.
B00005AQE8|5.0|This was a complete waste of my time to even write this review because as so many of the other reviews have showed, and hopefully you would all know, this is automatically and unarguably one of the top five Rap albums of all time (Excluding Old School i.e. Grandmaster Flash, and Afrika Bambaataa, ect...) along with \\"Straight Outta Compton\\", \\"The Chronic\\", \\"Illmatic\\", and \\"Doggystyle\\". That's not a definite list, but close. Also as you all know, this was Tupac's last album he released before he died in 1996, on the Las Vegas Strip, where that man desperate for attention murdered him. This album was just destined to start a whole bunch of commotion with all the Dre and Snoop wanting to leave Death Row right around that time, the always dangerous yet fantastic idea of letting Suge Knight produce your album, and well... Him being Tupac, and the drama that came with it. But seriously, this album is combined of all his late hits such as the obvious \\"California Love(Remix)\\", \\"2 Of Amerika's Most Wanted\\", \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\", \\"All About You\\", and many more. WARNING: If you liked the Cali Love original version don't buy this album because it is nothing like the remix, which is much slower, and a lot worse of a beat. But anyway I won't ramble on about material you already know about so, if you have any taste in any good Hip-Hop, and not Yung Joc, and Lil' Jon, then save up $22 and go to Best Buy which without shipping ends up costing less than amazon. Peace.    -PIRATE
630445841X|5.0|This is one movie that I watch at least 4 times a year. I can watch it over and over and over. The cinematography is captivating, the acting is superior and the story is engaging. On top of that, the chemistry among the actors was apparent. Anthony Hopkins plays the father (Col William Ludlow) and patriarch of the family whose \\"city\\" wife left him because she did not love the mountains and rustic living. She leaves him with his loyal companion (the indian narrator, One Stab) and three sons Alfred (Adian Quinn), Tristian (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas). The stage is set early on for an epic tale that has tragedy, betrayal, and love.  <br /> <br />Early on we find out that Tristian has the spirit of his father. He loves his brothers, the land and the indian people. He is a free spirit who even fights a bear early in life. Which is significant because this same bear (it is inferred) kills him years later.  So it is through One Stab's eyes and narrations, that we see the rest of the Ludlows Family life. We see Samuel return with a fiance' Susannah (Julia Ormond). We see the immediate attraction between her and the brothers. We find out that Tristian goes to war to protect and take care of Samuel. We see Tristian and Samuel go off to fight a war that their father opposes. We see Samuel die and Tristian return. We see how Tristian and Susannah appear to be attracted, but he leaves only to have Alfred marry her. We see her long for Tristian and the life that could have been. We see Tristian return to marry One Stab's daughter, Isabel and start a family. We see Susannah struggle with the realization that she can not have kids and wants the life that Isabel has. We see Isabel killed in a cruel twist of fate. We see Alfred realize how everything has a price even his happiness. We see Alfred survive his wife's suicide, only to realize how much family really means. And finally, we see how Tristian was always meant to be a kind spirit, with the Bear. He died as he lived, how he wanted.  <br /> <br />Although I have told you most of the movie, there is so much more. This, along with the Joy Luck Club, I love and highly recommend. Rent or purchase today. You would never regret it.  <br />
0525457585|5.0|The book I read is called the \\"Neverending Story\\", an adventure story where a boy named Bastian, a weakling, scaredy-cat, and failure. One day he steals a book from a small bookshop where he was hiding and ran away to school, where he sneaked into the school attic. He began reading and found out that in the book, a dark force called \\"The Nothing\\" was consuming a world called Fantastica. At the heart of Fantastica is the Ivory Tower, where the people gathered to discuss the situation. They called upon Atreyu, a plains warrior, to find a cure for the Empress, the only one that can save Fantastica. Atreyu had many difficulties, faced dangers, met friends, and almost got consumed by The Nothing. He ended up back at the Ivory Tower when the remains of Fantastica where in utter space. Bastian was able to communicate to the Empress and saved Fantastica from total destruction. Bastian was granted as many wishes as he wanted, so he restored Fantastica, rode on the white dragon Falcor, and was able to ride him on Earth.  <br /> I thought this book was influential because it taught me more about Intellectual Perseverance, to never give up, no matter the situation. Before I read this book I thought it would be boring and long, considering the title. But after I read it, I was glad I got the book. This book told me that all people have dreams and a meaning in life. I learned that sometimes you have to sacrifice some things for others, no matter how hard it may be. The style of this book is unique not only because of the story but how the chapters are made. There are 26 chapters, every chapter starting with a big letter in the alphabet on the beginning page, decorated to describe the chapter's main idea. \\"The Neverending Story\\" is a very touching book that will inspire many. <br />
B000000OAN|5.0|The definitive Queen album, the one that made them world famous and also the one that got me hooked way back in high school.    More great hits would come in later albums, but this one which contained Bohemian Rhapsody will forever remain number one.    The band was very much above average - the same lineup held for three decades, with all members contributing, and each playing his personna to the fullest. The insanely free and gifted lead vocalist, the equally gifted but more reserved lead guitarrist, an appropiately nutty drummer, and the quiet bass player. Note that Freddie has never been replaced, because he could not be.    Just how influential they were was apparent during the memorial at Wembley Stadium, when the likes of Roger Daltrey and Robert Plant paid tribute. Right at the top !    PS: agree with others that The Prophet's Song was an amazing tune and it gripped me then, and still does now. It's funny but that is the song that impacted me more than Rhapsody. It was Queen's equivalent to Zeppelin's 'When the Levee Breaks'.
0143034901|4.0|An interesting premise, some intriguing characters and enough mystery to keep you coming back to find out more about how all these people are connected.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|\\"High Voltage\\" is everything you could look for in a debut album from a rock band.  It is rough and dirty, raw and raunchy, while also featuring catchy riffs. It all comes together effectively when lead by Bon Scott's unique, high pitched shrieks of enthusiasm and Angus Young's ugly and powerful guitar riffs.  As a debut album, it does a great deal to stand up to any other material released by the band, in my opinion only falling short in quality of 1 or 2 later albums.<br /><br />The opening track is a 70s rock gem and oddly enough features the bagpipes.  \\"It's Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock n' Roll) immediately certifies AC/DC is a great group of rockers.  \\"Rock n' Roll Singer\\" is straightforward rock at its best, with simplistic lyricism and a solid riff.  \\"The Jack\\" is a slow, bluesy jam which scored them a hit amongst fans with its dirty lyrics and repetitive chorus.  Angus Young steals the show on this track with his slow grooving solo.  \\"Live Wire\\" sports maybe my favourite guitar solo on the album, and a contagious guitar riff.  This song is an underrated AC/DC classic.  \\"T.N.T.\\" was the biggest hit song off their debut and is well deserving.  The riff is heavy and raw, while the chorus is catchy as hell.  \\"Little Lover\\" shows the group reverting back to some blues and they do it effectively.  \\"She's Got Balls\\" is a silly rock song which will make you laugh.  The self-titled track is another excellent rocker, with a great, driving riff.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think AC/DC made a fantastic and somewhat unnoticed debut into rock n' roll.  The songs are memorable and in general awesome.  Where \\"High Voltage\\" is less impressive is the overall repetitiveness of it.  Although the guitar riffs are great, they are recycled a little too often.  Nevertheless, this is an outstanding rock album and one of their best.  Highly recommended.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|We all really liked this movie as a family. Would recommend it as a keeper.
B000FS9FCQ|3.0|Now I will not dispute that this is a wonderful adaption of Alan Moore's classic graphic novel, V For Vendetta.  I liked the way they updated it and I can't say that for many of the comic book films that I've seen.  However the DVD release has left me crying.  I mean on this over-priced double disc special edition we don't even get a commentary.  A lone fifteen minute featurette, that is absolutely worthless as they don't interview the Wachowski Bros or ALAN MOORE the author fills out the first disc weekly.  They talk to a bunch of real cool comic book insiders but they have no relevancy to either the story or the film.  The second disc made me weep.  There isn't a single interesting special feature on the DVD with the exception of when they talk about the real Guy Fawkes.  They have a little featurette on the Gun Powder Treason that is interesting and relevant to the film since most Americans have no idea who Guy was.  The rest of the features fall flat on their face and simply appear to take up space so that they could stick a second DVD into the package and charge a few extra bucks for poor saps like me that loved the film enought to simply jump at a double disc release with out looking long enough.  I would recommend grabbing the single disc edition unless you are a huge Natalie Portman fan because of the easter egg on the second disc.  A SNL Digital Short of Natalie Portman rapping and cursing up a storm on Satuday Night Live in an awesome appearance.  Other than that this DVD is worthless, well the I guess the film and and this music video, and that isn't worth thirty bucks.
B000001ES9|5.0|I have to admit, this album is nothing like Rush's later progressive rockage nor their synthesizer phase that they are so famous for. This album however, is delicious in every way in my opinion. \\"Finding my way\\" is one of Rush's main hits they still play to this day, as well as \\"Working Man\\". \\"Here Again\\" is a bluesy masterpiece with solid playing throughout, heck, the entire album Rush's playing is tight and solid. \\"Take A Friend\\", \\"Need Some Love\\", and \\"In The Mood\\" are all very good rockin songs with brilliant bass, guitar, and innovative drumming as they are on the entire CD. \\"Before And After\\" is a very solid pace changing clever and enjoyable song. My personal favorite is \\"What You're Doing\\" with its Black Sabbath/Led Zeppelinish riff and awesome beats and bass. A masterpiece in its own genre. Which, it really is. Rush's first recording effort is more of a classical rock n' roll album rather than a Progressive rock album which leads to my next point...    I think it's unfortunate that people get to comparing band's albums with one another and judge based on how they compare. People take Rush's debut CD and compare it to the genius albums like Fly By Night, 2112, Hemispheres, Farewell To Kings, Moving Pictures, etc and so they completely shaft this CD. This CD isn't even the same genre as those and shouldn't be judged as such. Well when I listen to CDs, I don't completely focus on their other stuff, I completely focus on the music at hand and judge based on what I hear and not on a biased status. I think it's pathetic that people compare this album to their totally different works and say this is nothing compared to it when in fact they don't focus on how amazing the music on this cd really is.    I highly recommend this CD to any and all lovers of rock. Fans of Rush, with patience, will appreciate it and anyone that likes rock will love it right away. At its face value, and for what it's worth, it's an excellent piece of music.    Peace,  Ty
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|This is not a review of the movie, which has been aptly reviewed as one of the most inovative, independent, film noir which will inevitably become a cult classic.  But rather, this is a review of the DVD that Brick is on.  The deleted scenes are great, and the introductions are pretty good; much more useful than anything that greats like Kevin Smith and Terry Gilliam have offered.  Unfortunately the Behind The Scenes Casting of Laura and Dode are only pitiful audition tapes of a single scene for the respective characters, no longer than ten minutes between the two.  There is a commentary track thankfully.  It's really the only special feature that's worth it's weight on the DVD; which is floating it's so light.  Although this movie is one of the best films I've ever seen, and an auspicious debut akin again to Kevin Smith's Clerks.  Unfortunately Rian Johnson doesn't have Smith's penchant for special features.  The commentary is the only good special feature and the price on this DVD is pretty steep for a single disc anyways, especially for an independent film that was delayed for almost a year and a half since they started running the ads for it.  SPECIAL EDITION?  I hope so.  This film begs for a good special edition.  Begs.  The language, the dramatic flair, the perfect perversion of noir.  I think I speak for a lot of other people when I say I want to see some real behind the scenes footage.  Some special features that involve the only star who appears to be M.I.A. on the DVD, Joseph Gordon Levitt.  He's like the only guy on the planet (there are six people on the commentary) not on the commentary.  So let me say I give this movie a five, nay a six, but I give the DVD a lousy 2 out of 5.  It's overpriced and under-packaged.  Let us begin the cry, SPECIAL EDITION!
B000G759LW|5.0|Simply put, \\"Back To Basics\\" is an INCREDIBLE album that brings Christina Aguilera's credit as an artist to a whole new dimension. The sounds on this album feel like authentic oldschool classics, but they have a unique modern touch. The songs are so organic and authentic to the point where you forget that its oldschool-inspired and just focus on the songs themselves. Disc one is an impressive funk collection. \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" has an up-beat soulful/gospel feeling, reminiscent of Aretha Franklin. Of course, one cannot overlook the song of the summer, \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" - with the blaring horn blasts and funky beat. Another highlight of the album is \\"Slow Down Baby\\" which is another funky dance groove. On a more emotional note, \\"Oh Mother\\" pays tribute to Aguilera's mother and acknowledges that pain of her childhood abuse. Then there's the feisty danceable \\"Still Dirrty\\" where she claims that she may be married, but she's still naughty. Lastly on Disc One is \\"Here to Stay\\". The horn blasts and funky beats make this song's message clear: Christina Aguilera is definitely \\"here to stay\\" in the music world, proving that talent is the key to longevity. On Disc 2, we find a more burlesque feel. The second disk is characterized by burlesque-show tunes and some gorgeous vocal ballads. On the upbeat and peppy \\"Candyman\\", Christina goes all out with the burlesque theme by using some big band swing music. Next, she tones it down a bit with a slow and sensual \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\". Aguilera then channels through the old soul icons like Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald on \\"I Got Trouble\\", which is not a cover, but an organic composiiton that truly sounds like an old classic soul number that Holiday, herself, would sing. Christina shifts gears again and dives into a haunting ballad, titled \\"Hurt\\". The ballad is a gut-wrenching emotional piece that simply gives you chills. Then there's the angelic sound on \\"Save Me From Myself\\" where Aguilera does not belt one note, making ita very intimate performance. \\"Back To Basics\\" proves to be a milestone in Christina Aguilera's career; she's matured a bit, as displayed in her intelligent lyrics and musically, she's matured as well, with this collection of intelliegently composed songs. This album cannot be overlooked; simply, Christina's greatest work so far.
B000000WA4|5.0|I was a mere 10 years old when this hit the market. It was a stage when I was still extensively listening to country (did I really buy all those Garth Brooks CDs?) So, lucky for me, I missed the grand \\"play out\\" stage of this album. Lucky for me. I bought it in 1998 and became and instant and loyal listener, both to this album and the pumpkins as a whole. Now it's 2005, and if anything, I love it more. In fact, either this or Counting Crows' \\"August And Everything After\\" may be my favorite album of all time. And that says a lot. I listen to anything from the Beatles' \\"Abby Road\\" to Green Day's \\"American Idiot.\\" As a previous reviewer mentioned, this double disc has a lot in common with the Beatles' \\"White Album,\\" not so much as in the way the songs sound, but just how they flow and are arranged. So, w/out further adew, here is the breakdown of the songs:  <br /> <br />DISK ONE: Dawn to dusk  <br />1.Title Track-I might have picked more of a rocker for a beginning, but this is still a beautiful, instrumental piano opening.  <br />2.Tonight, Tonight-Everyone who remembers the 90s remembers this. It's a mainstreem radio-friendly award-winning song that is actually good!  <br />3.Jellybelly-The opening is a little messed up, and it's a typical pumpkins \\"fuzzed out\\" rocker. Not my fav but I listen to it.  <br />4.Zero-big hit for it's time, inspired the \\"zero\\" pumpkins t-shirts. Never cared much for this t-shirt, but this song kicks a**!  <br />5.Here is no why-No idea how they got the title for this. nevertheless, this has always been a favorite. The analogy about \\"sad machines\\" speaks to me, in a way  <br />6.Bullet W/ Butterfly Wings-Classic. Need I say more?  <br />7.To Forgive-Meh. Not the most interesting song on the album, but it's listenable.  <br />8. Ode 2 No-one- or F--- You, as it is sometimes refered to as. The lyrics are a bit cheezy (corgan was obviously pissed as hell about a former love) but fits well as one of the album's heavier rockers.  <br />9.Love-Listen to this song on headphones and you'll feel really tripped out. I think Corgan's idea was to musically recreated this dizzy in-love-for-the-first-time feeling. Always loved this one.  <br />10.Cupid De Locke-Took me a bit to understand this one. It's not really \\"teenager\\" but now that I'm almost 22, I recognize that this is living proof that Pumpkins can be satanic or sweet.  <br />11.Galapagos-BEAUTIFUL more mellow piece about change and nostaligia. Reminds me of my past summers in MI  <br />12.Muzzle-Another hit from the album, I always loved the lyrics to this one. It not too heavy, not too soft. One of my favs.  <br />13.Porcelina of the vast oceans-This should have gotten playtime on the radio, all the way! It's classic. I do wonder how they came up with porcelina, though. Sounds like a toilet.  <br />14.Take Me Down-James Iha-penned slower song to finish off the first half of the show. I usually skip this one. They should just let Corgan write the songs.  <br /> <br />Disk 2:Twilight To Starlight  <br />1.Where Boys Fear To Tread-Complete Hard Rockin' redemption from the first disk's poor closing. The band I used to be in jammed on this song sometimes. Always been a fav.  <br />2.Bodies-Another Fav, same rocking vein as the previous. I remember wondering what was going on between this song and the last. I thought something was wrong with my cd player. How creative!  <br />3.33-Another hit song. Well written, deep, and a good calmer tune after the previous two.  <br />4. In the arms of sleep-If the pumpkins would have made an mtv unplugged (with they should have!), this would have been on it. Great guitar work, and overall, great song.  <br />5.1979-classic hit song and one of my favorite sp songs ever  <br />6.Tales Of A Scorched Earth-can almost feel the heat of it happening too. The pumpkins rip your face off after three slower songs. Rock on!  <br />7.Through The Eyes Of Ruby-This is a really poetic alternative song, followed by a reprise of the titletrack at the end. This is a friend of mine's favorite sp song. It's not mine but it's fab!  <br />8.Stumbeline-I play this on my guitar sometimes. This is prolly the best from Corgan's solo acoustic catalog. \\"Jupiter's Lament,\\" which prolly got bumped by this one, isn't nearly as good.  <br />9.XYU-Jeeze! I would really like to know where Corgan got this title idea AND the lyrics! This giant rocker makes Korn sound like sesame st. music.  <br />10.We Only Come Out @ Night-A song about bats. And who better to write a song about bats than the pumpkins. This is one of the reasons I say that this has similarities with the \\"White Album\\"  <br />11. Beautiful-Title says it. I'll save the wearNtear on my keyboard.  <br />12. Lily, My 1 + Only-This track is genious, and is another potential radio-hit. It's a slower song about a guy who climbs a tree and watches his crush through her window.  <br />13.By Starlight-Straight forward and clean, this could have been from a U2 session. Good sound.  <br />14.Farewell and goodnight-\\"The White Album\\" ended with a track with a similar title. That song is kinda tacky, while this ending is perfection. Nicely done, pumpkins!  <br /> <br />Smashing Pumpkins are one of the 90's best bands, the this album is the reason why. How can u go wrong? <br />
B0001Z2RUK|5.0|Keane has captured the abilities of the piano, and used them to produce a sound that few come close to.  They step outside of the box to bring a new sound into the world.  Their lyrics seem to tell a story or paint a picture in your mind.  Their music is inspiring and uplifting.  Keane will spread like a wildfire to those who enjoy good music!
B00005B4GU|2.0|Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A. From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason. In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three. The result. Fillers. Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated. Anesiac is almost the opposite. It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as \\"I Might Be Wrong,\\" \\"Pact,\\" and \\"Hunting Bears\\" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions. Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one. I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead. <br /> <br />
B000G75AE8|4.0|Ok, I'll explain my title. My main problem with 'God Hates Us All' was that too many of the songs and lyrics were written by Kerry King, and there was too much nonsense about 'smashing your face in, i'm so angry...etc.' that sounded like a 15 year old hardcore bands lyrics, mixed in with the anti-religious lyrics, which are fine (i'm an athiest!) but have been done to death.  <br /> <br />And so it's a shame to see that King has again written the majority of the tracks on 'Christ Illusion.' I much prefer the Hanneman/Araya tracks, and wish there were more of them. But, it's still Slayer, and it's incredible that these guys continue to create music of such quality and integrity and brutality after so many years. Of course Lombardo's return helps, the drumming is unreal, the riffs and solos are amazing, and the majority of the tracks are great. I just wish, as with GHUA, that Kerry King wrote less, or that Hanneman/Araya wrote more lyrics on this one. So, my main complaint is that it just lyrically rehases too much from GHUA. But, as others have pointed out, it's still probably the best thing they've done since 'Seasons...' and if you are a metal fan, you owe it to yourself, and to Slayer, to pick this up!
B000002MU3|5.0|As stated before, Michael Stipe and the boys chucked the mandolin, organ, and string section and made a driven grunge-alt. album. The release of this album has spawned different rxns. Some call it a gutsy move. Others call it trite. I, however, call it a breakout.  <br /> <br />So this album isn't Out Of Time. Get over it. Out of time was really good, yet overproduced and filler ridden. This, al contrario, represents a different side of REM. To avoid making the same album yet again, they stepped out of what may or may not have been expectations of their label, they droned all of the above out with guitar on overdrive. \\"Frequency\\" is one of REM's best songs, \\"Strange Currencies\\" is a happy love song from them for a change, and \\"Bang And Blame\\" is owned by echo-effects. not to mention, \\"let me in\\" is easily the most creative, the most acid-rock recalling REM song to date. I don't think they've ever done anything more creative. So, if you are an REM fan who was disappointed by this album, challenge yourself. Imagine that REM didn't make this, but it was some other band. Your prespective may change. <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I have been a Depeche Mode since I was 10 years old, but even I could hardly listen to all the boring stuff that the guys offered me on the previous albums Ultra and Exciter. However Playing the Angel turned out to be a great recovery. Dave Gahan's vocals just sound way better when he is collaborating with the band instead of performing on his own. On his own album the songs all look alike and I don't like him singing with an American accent. I think the first three songs of Playing the Angel are the best. Suffer Well in particular. Damaged people, one of Martin Gore's vocal contributions is the weakest song. I am really looking forward to the next album as this one certainly calls out for more. (SARR)
B000AADYRQ|5.0|Even though this isn't any more caliber material than Transatlantism to be the next Nevermind, this is pleasing to the ear. I mentioned in my review of the previous effort, Transatlanticism, that is was nothing to change music in the likes of Sgnt. Peppers or The Wall. Neither does Plans. In fact, Plans more or less picks up where Transatlantism left off. Both albums are discs to put in and, though they are not necisarrily recognizable at first listen, eventually attract your attention the way your third grade teacher would do when you were caught daydreaming. \\"Soul Meets Body\\" is one of those songs that you can't help but tap your foot to. The lyrics are a nod to poetic song writing that most of us thought left with the disbanding of Simon and Garfunkel. \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is about the eternal unity of hearts. While Trans. (tired of spelling that out) was as I refered to as a \\"relationship catalogue\\" mostly dealing with the art of seeking and finding, Plan is what happens after this art has been mastered. \\"Dark\\" spells that out more clearly than ABC. It's neither happy nor sad, neither bittersweet nor, well, whatever the opposite of that is. It just brings a sense of closeness. Other songs, such as \\"Marching Bands of Manhatten\\", \\"Someday you will be loved\\", and \\"Crooked Teeth\\" constitute that whatever issues and problems resided behind the scene of Trans. have now been resolved and figured out in Plans. Maturity rules!  <br /> <br />So, artsy review-style writing aside, liked Trans? Get it, there's no reason not to like it. Hated Trans? Don't go near it with a ten-foot pole. <br />
B00000JLWW|2.0|James Cameron put together a nice movie for girls. Rich ladies falling in love with tramps looking like Leonardo Dicaprio and silly stuff like that. Everlasting love within seconds after boy and girl meet for the first time. After half an hour any male viewer will start screaming for the iceberg to show up. <br />I have got to hand it to James Cameron, that everything looks  <br />quite realistic. Too bad the love story is ruining that part as we find Leo and Kate walking through 0 degrees water longer than even a polar bear would be able to. However this movie became an enormous blockbuster, so let's not be too negative about it. (SARR)  <br />
B000002UAX|5.0|After a ginormous handfull of successful albums, singles, and compilations including the song \\"i wanna hold your hand\\" that made them heroes and the srgnt. peppers album that made them legends, the beatles delivered this double self-titled album, now known as \\"the white album.\\"  While inevidably a monster success back in the 60's and timeless today, this is one album that just about any music listener who isn't strickly listening to rap can find something to listen to.  This album is so huge and diverse, I can't cover it fastly.  Here's the ol' song breakdown:    Disc (Vinyl) 1:  1. Back In The USSR-Good Song.  Yet, I think the best songs of the White Album are the less known.  2. Dear Prudence-If you ask me, this is where the album's greatness starts.  And no-one asked me.  but I'll say it anyway.  3. Glass Onion-Beatles have always been good at writing songs that are \\"trippy.\\"  This song is, well, kind of a review of their songs in this cat.  4. Obla-dee-Won't spend too much time with this one-everyone knows it in some form or another. alway thought this was one of the most annoying songs in the world until i got the album-it fits context well.  5. Wild Honey Pie- Too Much Weed  6. Bungalo Bill-Quirkly little song about a hunter who takes his mom on his trips.  Catchy.  You prolly already know it.  7. While My Guitar gently weeps-Best on the album, first disc and second.  At the time, Harrison's best song by far!  Harrison was one of the best kept secretes ever.  To generate a great hit like this is proof.  8. Happiness is a warm gun-I love this, but I don't really get the message.  That's okay.  They're the Beatles, they don't have to.  9. Martha My Dear-I could have done without the horns, but otherwise, nice little love song.  10. I'm So Tired-I can tell he meant it.  One of my favs, still sounds fresh today with the likes of the Shins and Sunny Day Real Estate.  11. Blackbird-Everyone knows this.  It's been remade countless times.  It's timeless and classic.12. Piggies-This track is kind of silly, but it has a nice sound, so it makes up.  Geniouses can't alway be serious...  13. Rocky Raccoon-...but it doesn't have to be this pointless.  Kidding.  This another quirky story song.  Listen to the words.  14. Don't Pass Me By-The title pretty much does the job.  15. Why Don't We Do It In The Road-I hope this is a retorical question. Good for cheap laughs  16. I Will-I've heard this called cheasy.  I don't know where that comes from.  I think this mood change is just right.  I dig.  17. Julia-See Above    Disc (Vinyl) 2:    1. Birthday-I hate this song.  Skip  2.Yer Blues-that's more like it.  I don't know if this exactly my blues, but's it's definately my style of.  3. Mother Nature's Song-Even better than John Denver's version.  Oh wait, it's the origional.  nevermind.  4. Monkey-not going to write that whole thing out.  Not the best song in the world, but it definately isn't the worst!  5. Sexy Sadie-Listen to this one twice  6. Helter Skelter-Only the Beatles could pull off something like this in the 60s and get away with it.  could be off any grunge album  7. Long, Long, Long-I'm listening this one right now.  I never really paid attention to it, and i'm loving it right now!  Lower Key.  8. Revolution-naw.  version on \\"hey jude\\" (actually the origional) was worlds better  9. Honey Pie-this song still makes me laugh  10. Savoy Traffic-Nice bouncey poppy tune.  In the 60's that's a good thing  11. Cry Baby Cry-Great song, nice to relax to  12, 13-just turn the cd off    Though a few tracks are unbearably horrible, hey, it's a post-peppers beatles album, and that alone deserves 5 stars.  Every music fan needs beatles alums such as this, peppers, and abby rd.
B00005N7Z1|4.0|This is one of my all time favourites! Paul Verhoeven is at his best here! This movie could have easily have turned out into a smooth Hollywood production, but Verhoeven managed to squeeze in a lot of his dark sense of humor somehow. This is adding a real extra dimension to the movie. The movie is situated in a possible future Detroit where the police is privately owned (!) by a company called OCP. OCP now has a plan to call a halt to crime: the Robocop project. All they now need is a \\"volunteer\\".  Peter Weller was brilliantly cast as Robocop as he basically talks like a robot by nature already. However Kurtwood Smith delivers the best performance here. His role of psychotic gangleader Clarence Boddicker really rocks! Go and watch this  as this movie proves, that action movies do not necessarily  have to be stupid.(SARR)
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer self titled. The blue album. whatever it's called. This is arguably where emo core had its nemisis, at least in top 40 land. It seems like Weezer fans break into two groups-those who favor this and those who favor pinkerton. I really don't know where I am. Kinda depends on the day. Lots of people don't care for the later weezer, which is where I deviate, because I love Maladriot and Green (Make believe falters a bit), but just about anybody who appreciates post-nirvana grundge-emo-alternative rock \\"candy\\" can appreciate this. If you don't have it pick it up, or beware on judgement day.
B00005A46T|5.0|This album, on it's own merits, was the first great metal album of the new millineum. It stands the test of time, and sounds even more relevant today, as many couldn't accept it's raw brutality and hatred amidst a sea of dying rap-metal. Several tracks, like Disasterpeice, remain shining examples of what can be accomplished in metal today. And Corey Taylor's lyrics are as poetic and venomous as ever, rendering most other metal lyrics childish. Their next album went to the dumps as far as I'm concerned, so I look at this as the heaviest they could have ever gotten without falling apart. It's a shame so many haters forego true album reviews just to bash the band and an album they know nothing about. Ignore the child-like rants against this album that have no real critical value and respect this album for what it is; a landmark in modern metal.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|I'm a big fan of Adams, and I think he's a very talented artist. Most people consider this his best. I don't think so, but I do think its good.  <br /> <br />When I first listened to this album, I was quite taken with the first three songs, especially \\"Answering Bell.\\" I thought he was on a roll. If were to compare this to throwing an object off a cliff, this would be where the object soars.  <br /> <br />That being said, the album continues on with \\"La Cienega Just Smiled,\\" \\"Rescue Blues,\\" \\"Somehow Someday,\\" and \\"When the Stars go blue.\\" While not quite as capturing as the first three songs, I love them and listen to them about as much.  <br /> <br />After this point, it become clear that my metaphorical object isn't exactly going to fly. \\"Nobody Girl,\\" SYLVIA PLATH, \\"Enemy Fire,\\" and \\"Gonna Make You Love Me\\" range from the good to the mediocre. \\"Enemy Fire\\" recalls Neil Young's more crazy horse-esque moments, making it my favorite of this batch. SYLVIA PLATH starts out really starts out very strong but seems a bit lackluster towards the end, making it overall a good song. The other two I'm fairly neutral about.  <br /> <br />My flight testing object continues on its downward path, whereby we come to my \\"shady\\" area of the album. \\"Wild Flowers\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" are not exactly memorable (i don't remember them very well right now) but I know they're listenable.  <br /> <br />I don't know what Adams was thinking when he layed down the last three tracks. At this point my object crashes into pieces on the rocks below.  Pretty much the only reason this cd doesn't get quite 5 stars. Better luck next time.  <br /> <br />Overall this another really good album from Adams, but it has flaws. This could have easily been a 10-12 track cd, but instead, it has 16, so the cd kinda drones in places. In other words, the garden is beautiful, it just needs to be weeded. <br />

0066620996|5.0|Backed by extensive research, this ground breaking book explains some key principles and characteristics that enable companies to rise above the norm.  Although some of these companies have underperformed since the book was published, the information is valid.  I recommend it in conjunction with Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self to achieve individual and corporate optimization.  Buy both books.
B000FP2Z0S|1.0|What is this!!! I hate Rise Against and everything they stand for, and for all you people who like this listen to some real music and I do think its amazing they are still around but it goes to show you how dumb of a time we are living in where people dont understand what the hell is going on or anything so if you like this album great, and for the ones who hate it, that means a lot and you might have a better music taste. <br /> <br />I wanted to add PUNK MUSIC IS DEAD AND IT IS NEVER COMING BACK AND FOR ALL YOU 12 YEAR OLDS OR WHAT NOT IT IS NOT COMING BACK EVER SO YOU CAN KISS MY BACK END.
B000F7CMRM|4.0|First of all, don't bother looking for any similarities between the book \\"See no Evil\\" and \\"Syriana\\". They're aren't any. The book was about how the CIA became wholly ineffective after it fell into a bueracratic mess and decided to rely solely on satellites, and completely disregarding human intelligence. Hence 9/11.  <br />The movie was mainly about how foreign oil has completely corrupted everything from politics, business, intelligence, government, even terrorist organizations. I read the book (which like the movie had a very steep learning curve, but was excellent) and then watched the movie, and was very puzzled on how the movie was supposed to have been inspired by the book. <br /> <br />In any case, I had to watch the movie three times to fully grasp the meaning of each of the different stories, which led me to believe that perhaps it would have been better to trim down the amount of story lines. I thought that after you got past the intricate and sometimes downright confusing plot, the movie was excellent. The actors were amazing, one of the best casts for a movie of this sort. In fact, the sheer excellence of the performances helped carry the movie over the difficult plot, and kept me riveted. Clooney's character was especially amazing, I half believed he was a quasi rogue CIA agent by the end of the movie. <br />I think most people who don't enjoy the movie were expecting a more passive experience. You're not really going to laugh out loud or cry over a tragic romance, but you are going to think. A lot. Remember that although it was a fictional movie,  it was (very) loosely based on current events. Things that have happened and are happening now! In order to experience this movie fully, I recommend you coming to the table with a very open mind, otherwise don't waste your time.
B0000931OG|2.0|\\"Think Tank\\" reinvented Blur for me, or my view of their previous material.  I like Blur.  I can't say that they are my favorite band -- but they definitely have a place of their own in my collection, especially albums # 2-4 (Modern Life..., Parklife, and Great Escape).  The unabashed use of pop to convey anti-pop messages.  The sarcastic storytelling.  Blur was a good time party band that could also engage anyone who actually sits down and listens to the words........ more than meets the eye.  That was something to be proud of.   <br /> <br />I started to like Blur less the more sophisticated and artistic they got.  I didn't like Blur (self-titled album) much, with the direction of the songwriting..... and I really disliked 13......... but just the same, I oddly respect these albums, as they live and breathe, even if they are over-ambitious and/or less accessible.  If Damon Albarn wants to \\"grow up\\" as a songwriter, he has that right........ even at the expense of \\"alienating\\" fans like myself.  Whatever it was he was going for, he seemed to hit it right between the eyes.   <br /> <br />And then came Think Tank.  Instrumentally and stylistically, this was a natural progression from the increasingly more-serious last two albums.  More computers are used.  More instruments are experimented with.  The songs are less direct, more searching.  All the pieces are in place for a solid, if not as listenable, neo-Blur album.  Which would be admirable, even if non-adaptable people like me do not like it as much. <br /> <br />That's Fine............. the only problem is: it's not solid, and not listenable.    <br /> <br />And thus I came upon the revelation of what made Blur \\"Blur\\"............. Of course. It was the one palpable thing missing from Think Tank that everything else before it had had.  The only thing that could explain going from good experimentation to aimless experimentation.  The guitar.  The guitar was gone.  The abstract, vernacular lead guitar........ hard to describe but impossible to mistake.  Ladies in gentlemen, what made Blur \\"Blur\\" was Graham Coxon, I reckon...  <br /> <br />Without Coxon, Think Tank loses focus and musicality both.  Albarn and the rhythm section are left making music that sounds like it were generated by \\"Garage Band\\" or a similar computer program.  For most of the songs, there is no distinguishing one part from another.  It literally sounds as though Albarn and the band could have played the hook once and just looped it the rest of the song.  The samples are promising but the songs are basically Gorillaz clones: beat-driven, without melody or variation.  Nothing to even make them worth listening to, unless the lyrics grab you............. and the lyrics are not bad, which makes the ineptitude of the music even more unfortunate.   <br /> <br />Think Tank could have been a very good album.  Some of the songs are catchy and border on good. \\"Out of Time\\" is very pretty. \\"Good Song\\" is a drone's lazy summer hymn. \\"Sweet Song\\" is a basic but convincing little ballad. \\"On My Way to the Club\\" is a possessed reflection on rock and roll trappings.  Albarn shows that he has grown up into quite the sociopolitical visionary, actually.  He lyrics have an abstract depth that make them worth studying.  But the songs are still skeletons, barely even real songs -- even these borderline-good ones.  And sadly, this drags the poetic prowess down with it.   <br /> <br />Not much need be said about the songs I did not mention.  Most drag on like jam sessions to nowhere, as Damon tries to be understated and thus nothing gets stated, since if not words, the music certainly isn't going to say it.  When they finish one almost feels cheated for having listened to them expecting something to happen.  There is one exception. \\"Battery in Your Leg.\\" This is the one very good song on the album........ it is no coincidence that it also is the only song that features Graham Coxon.  It is almost too ironic that Albarn apparentlyfinished with this song as a message to Coxon that the two could reconcile.  On a musical level, this song says even more: they need to reconcile.   <br /> <br />Blur's career may depend on it.  In essence, this song takes the same kind of songwriting from the rest of the album and gives it melody and direction.  What actually makes the song, in fact, is Coxon's eerie descending chord progression after Albarn's sincere \\"You can be with me\\"... plummeting right into Alex James' base.  The end result is pretty breathtaking... even for someone who likes recent Blur less than old Brit-pop Blur.  When Albarn's imagination and Coxon's flare come together, good things still happen.......... <br /> <br />But while Coxon's vibrant guitar-playing can stand alone, as his solo works prove, Albarn needs Coxon badly.  Likely more than Coxon needs him.  Albarn is a freewheeler without the musical aptitude to make his idea's work......... and Coxon is his structure.  In accommodating Coxon, Albarn actually accommodates himself...... and what he is capable of.  That didn't happen on Think Tank.
B00005UT85|3.0|I searched all over for this cd after I had heard \\"Grey and Pink\\" and \\"If I could do it all again....\\", and I was in denial for a while about it being as good. Being released the same year as the first Soft Machine album, I was expecting \\"Caravan\\" to be an equally creatively explosive affair.  However, after time I realized that this was a band that had not yet figured out what they were doing (much like the first two yes albums). I burned a copy before selling the original just for \\"Magic Man\\" and \\"Place of my own\\", for me the two shining spots on this disc.  I'm not a sound engineer, so I don't get off on the stero and mono versions included on the album.  Why listen to mono?  Why?  \\"In the land of Grey and Pink\\" and \\"If I could do it all over again, I'd do it all over you\\" are the only Caravan albums you need, in my opinion.  Overall, my score is average at best.
0066620996|5.0|Most business books fall into one of two categories;    1. Been there done that - \\"I was CEO of XYZ Inc., here's what I did, try it and it might work for you.\\"  2. I've got an idea - \\"I am a author-consultant-professor and I think I have figured out how it works.\\"    What is different about this work begins by the very premise; research a group of companies who appear to have created a pattern of going from acceptable results to producing results far supier to their peers. Then, and only then, decide if there is something to write about. Collins and his team found a group of companies who made the transition from Good to Great, then successfully identified a set of characteristics present in each of the examples.     Watching dozens of small business CEOs struggle with attempting to implement the concepts in the book has lead me to a handful of biases that may be helpful, if you are planning to implement this material.    1. Collins is not saying that these concepts are the ONLY way for a company to be great. There are many successful companies who are great and don't apply these principles. He is simply saying if you have a historical pattern of acceptable/good results and you want to break the pattern, here is how other companies did it.    2. This is not a quick fix. The companies profiled dedicated years to pursue an outcome they believed in. Be prepared to implement for the long haul.    3. Get past the buzzwords and the headlines. For example: It is not just about \\"getting the right people on the bus,\\" as I have heard quoted so many times. It is about understanding who the right people are to have on the bus, making sure they are in the right seats and then designing a strategy that fits them and that they can execute.    4. Make the discussion about HOW each concept applies at your company, not IF it applies. Too often I have watched teams argue about whether a concept is 'right' or 'correct,' rather than discussing how it can be applied at the company.    This work has garnered a position as a modern business classic and is jusitified in wearing that title proudly.    Jim Canfield  President/COO   Renaissance Executive Forums  San Diego, CA
B000G759LW|5.0|I'm really not into pop singers but trust me this CD has some serious music in it, from her vocals, to the integration of old and new music styles everything is perfect. <br />Is so refreshing to see a pop star making something off the beaten path. <br />Trust me I have heard tons of music, from, early baroque, jazz, country, salsa, alternative, gothic, old rock-n-roll,, you name it. And this CD is up there with the best. <br />Cristina, if your reading congratulations, this is proof that you are a real artist.
0937381888|5.0|I picked this book up just before ordering my brewing equipment three years ago. 3 years, 52 brewing books read, 110 batches, 6 Best of Show awards, and a lot of long nights of drinking later, it is still the best book I own on practical brewing procedures.  <br /> <br />The first chapter is THE perfect guide to making your first beer and not screwing it up. From then on, Palmer delves into more and more intricate procedures from brewing lagers, to decoction mashing, to yeast propogation and management. Lot's of useful charts and graphs throughout and a well put together appendix. <br /> <br />The one book I can say that EVERY homebrewer, no matter how serious they are, needs to own.
B000G759LW|5.0|I never bought a Christina Cd in the past. So this is basically my first! And I'm glad I waited this long for it because this album finally matches her vocal power and energy! This is the album I've been waiting for her to make for so long now!   <br />Some have even questioned whether it was worth making it a double album. I'd say yes because I enjoyed it from beginning to end. <br />This is an ambitious project and I believe she succeeded! Congrats!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|Here is a spectacle that never fails to disappoint even in spite of certain imperfections.  Visually, it is flawless.  McTeigue certainly knows his craft and manages to use the camera in a manner that is perfectly befitting the content.  The production design is idiosyncratic but also accessible and believable, which further mesmerizes and intrigues.  The script by the Wachowskis further exemplifies their talent: they now how to use words, they know how to use ideas, they know how to build a story.    And what a story it is.  I was uncertain how to feel the first time I viewed the film.  Certainly, the movie must breed controversy, and I didn't know which side of that I fell on.  I've come to endorse the film but only after careful reflection.  The issues are contemporary and touchy, but the movie offers enough ambiguity to permit the viewer his own interpretation.  Certainly, one cannot mindlessly interact with this film; only catastrophe could ensue as a result.  Patience and contemplation are required here, and I fear that in the wrong hands, this form of content could be inflammatory.  But then all good art is.    There's nothing to complain about with Natalie Portman, but it's a sheer miracle that Hugo Weaving can continuously steel the show from behind a mask--what a voice!  Another component on which I must comment is the use of editing and music.  Dario Marianelli's score is superb, and listen to the way he subtly incorporates Tchaikovsky into the quieter moments!  Scattered throughout the film are several intriguing and wonderful montage sequences that create a marvelous flow to the narrative and are wonderfully accented by the pulse of Marianelli's music.  At times the film makes awkward pauses, the dialogue waxes melodramatic, and the pacing seems forced, but these faults are inconsequential to an overall brilliant film.
0743537009|5.0|Before I picked up the audio cd edition, I hadn't even seen the movie, but had heard it was one of King's best works both on the screen and in paperback.  But I wasn't sure I'd enjoy the book.  \\"So what?  Haunted hotel, and a kid who can read minds,\\" I thought to myself.  But it turned out to be one of the best King books I've ever read, or listened to in my case.  Its very disturbing, Jack Torrances slow descent into madness, and the notion of being trapped in such a terrible place, snowed in and with the very hotel itself out to get you...  Well, it made for interesting listening.  And Campbell Scott from that Emily Rose movie...  I was glad he was selected to read this thing.  Now I guess I'll have to watch the film.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I LOVE TOPGUN,ITS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER!I THINK IT INSPIRED LOTS OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF ON FUTURE ASPIRATIONS.HERE'S TOO MANY HOURS OF GOOD LISTENING, ENJOY.S:-)
B000HCO840|3.0|Like all worthwhile film trilogies, themes and character arcs established in 2000's X-Men come to their fruition in this final? movie installmant of Marvel's famous mutants. But, are we given the grand finale we deserve? No. <br /> <br />While the first movie served simply as exposition to introduce the conflicts and motives of this well-drawn cast, the second movie laid it all out and showed film audiences what comic book readers knew for decades: the X-Men are powerful, amazing, and very tragic characters, which makes them very human. <br /> <br />In The Final Stand, we are given a glimpse at how unethical Xavier can be, how vain Magneto really is, and how stern Storm can come off. But what highlights this film, and makes it even a little enjoyable, is the chemistry between lost soul Jean Grey (played PERFECTLY by Famke Jensen) and unrequited lover Logan (returning fav Hugh Jackman.) Not to mention a fanboy's dream script incorporating elements and images from  X-Tales like Days of Future Past, Planet X, the cartoon episode 'The Cure', and of course, The Dark Phoenix Saga. <br /> <br />As a fan of these stories for 15 years now, I can say that the spirit and message of X-Men was fullfilled with the trilogy, but The Final Stand did not meet up to expectations.  One could blame last minute director Brett Ratner for pushing the film along at a pace that doesn't allow for thought, or the screenwriters for trying to do TOO much in one film.  When Cyclops is reunited with his beloved, believed dead and gone, their reunion is almost watered down. Yes there is shock. Yes there is confusion. Yes there is joy. But that scene alone flows like there was a checklist, like they had to hit these feelings and move on. And the whole movie comes across like that. So, I credit this movie for telling a great story, but it loses point after point for how poorly at times it tells that story. Most likely, 20th Century Fox's demand to have the film out Memorial Day 2006 gave the production team too little time to fine tune what could have been a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Casual moviegoers will love it.  Plenty of action, special effects, romance (however complicated), comedy, and a good theme. <br />Comic fans either embrace it or loathe it.  But this isn't a comic.  This is a movie, and a decent one to be sure.  It's just not a great one. <br /> <br />As far as DVD features, the Collector's Edition's where it's at.
0743454537|5.0|Another wonderful book by Jodi Picoult.  I always love her surprise endings.  Her characters are deep and wonderful.<br /><br />This books certainly can be a source of discussion and thought.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is the best CD i've heard in awhile. All the songs are amazing and different. Christina really done it this time.
B00005QZWI|5.0|I loved it the music and it is helping me to learn to play the songs.
B000002MJC|5.0|Violator may be their biggest commercial success.  But Songs of Faith and Devotion is the one Depeche Mode CD I could listen to again and again, probably for the rest of my life.  One Caress is a beautiful song (I would love for my husband to sing those words to me :).  These songs showcase what a talented singer Dave Gahan is.  These songs relax me and sometimes leave me with goosebumps.  I'm so happy to see that there are other people out there who love this CD as much as I do, because I feel it truly never got the recognition it deserves.
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead did not come easy for me. It took a few months and several listens to OK Computer when it came out for me to get into them at all. When Kid A came out, i found the same thing. However, from my past experience, i knew to listen to the album a few times before i could judge it. It soon became my favourite album by Radiohead, and then my favourite album by any band, and then put Radiohead in position as my favourite band. <br /> <br />This album is not a collaboration of songs. It's much more like one single song, with several movements whose contrast and support from each other drive the album to perfection(this album was actually debuted by mtv in full, without breaks, one track immediatly after the other. there were no singles released in the U.S. from the album). For this reason, i cannot name favourite songs from it. I could go on abuot what this means for music, how this band came out with a post post modern work etc etc, but i dont like this album for whatever \\"significance\\" it may have. not that i have anything against those you like it for that. i'm jsut about the music itself. <br /> <br />heres a bit of a summary: Thom is at his best, both lyrically and with the sound of his voice itself. He cuts disturbing images into the mind with lines like \\"cut the kids in half\\" and \\"here im allowed everything all of the time\\", yet paints the saddest, most beautiful pictures at the same time. His voice ranges from detached and impersonal(while speaking deadly words, nonetheless) to being positively dominated with raw emotion that i honestly couldnt describe in words. <br /> <br />apart from the lyrics, the music itself is at least as important to the wholeness of the album. Jonny greenwood dropping the guitar for the eerie strings of a dead electric instrument in \\"how to disappear completly\\", the sad organ in \\"motion picture soundtrack\\", the sawtoothed electric bass in \\"the national anthem\\" (which is actually played by thom, even the computer vibe of \\"kid a\\" and idioteque\\" are seamless and...necessary, in a word, to Kid A as an album. <br /> <br />This album is truly a masterpiece, a real example of how new music has not completly faded into catchy tunes that fade from memory and constant imitation with talentless pop whose image means more tahn their music. there is creativity left in popular music, and radiohead's Kid A shows it more than any other album I've heard. Give it a try. then give it another. Understanding it takes time, but it is truly worth the while.
9707704667|5.0|This a great book, very readable. He made a lively character (La nina mala). The Wilde's quotation named in his book the Perpetual Orgy can be applied to this book by sure: ¨The death of Boris de Lubempre is one of the greatest dramas of my life¨. I had the impression that I met La niña mala when I finished this very readable book. Keep on the good work Mario. I hope that one of these days you will receive the well deserved Nobel Prize!!.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina has mos def out did herself with her double disc album \\"Back To Basics\\"..You can see her growth we all know shes no longer that 17 year old girl who first started out...She always comes back with something New & Fresh & always tries to seperate herself from the crowd she never has tried to be somebody else..To stop out & have you own creativty is an A+ in my book...Baby Jane as what shes being called nowadays took it back to the 40's very modern her voice fits this type of music & I love it..I can't stop playing it this is worth being album of 2006..A classic no other words can describe it.
B000001GBJ|4.0|I really like listening to this CD when I want to relax. The music is peaceful and mellow. There's a bit of an Irish twist to a few of the songs which I really enjoy too. This hauntingly lovely collection of instrumentals will sooth the spirit. I just wish there were a few more songs added to the thirteen so I could enjoy the experience a little longer.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|What a great and powerful film.  A true adaption of a graphic novel.  The performances were great, the story was fantastic.  Hugo Weaving as V is charismatic and Natalie Portman is very bold.  More story and little action, but it delivered where it was supposed to.  Can't ask for a better movie.  Graphic novel fans check this out.  A 5 star win for Vertigo/DC Comics.  Add it to your collection as soon as you can. <br /> <br />A Loyal Fan
B00005JGAB|2.0|Frist of all this is  an okay album don't get me wrong, but I bought it because Johnny Ramone is supposed to be a great guitarist but he really isn't. Plus it kinda sounds like it was recorded with the band playing in a bathroom, with two tin cans on a string: one in the bathroom withthe band and the other running out to the hallway with a radio shack microphone sitting in front of it. Catchy tunes but if i had it to buy over again I'd probably just d/l essential tracks like I Can't Be and I Don't Wanna Be Learned/I Don't Wanna Be Tamed and spend my hard hustled scratch on a better produced Ramones album like End Of The Century or Pleasant Dreams.
B00006JU7T|5.0|I remember reading Peter Maas' book when I was in junior high -- way back in the 1970s. I've read a lot of books since then, and yet I remember Frank Serpico. It's an important story -- what makes a man fight against corruption, year after year, at the risk of his own life? We need more people like that, they are too few and far between. <br /> <br />I watched this movie for the first time last night. I've seen Al Pacino in many, many films. He's been one of our greatest actors for over 30 years, familiar to us all.  <br /> <br />And yet, when I watched Al Pacino in \\"Serpico,\\" he was so convincing ... I forgot it was him. That's the highest praise I can give an actor. <br />
B0002F7I9Y|3.0|It's interesting to hear Ray bring his special style to the various artists he performs with.  Some songs are much more dynamic than others.  I've listened to it a few times, but it's not an album I'm going to bring out to play again and again.  I'd say it's really one for the hard-core Ray Charles fan.
B00005T7I1|4.0|I collect comic book/superhero movies and I almost forgot about Dick Tracy.  So the very next day I had to buy it.  This movie is great.  Way ahead of it's time.  I can see where Sin City got its influence.  I loved the set designs, the costume designs, all the primary colors like a real life comic strip.  The make-up for the villains is off the charts.  One fantastic film.  Just wonder how this movie would look if it was filmed just like Sin City or the much talked about coming soon Spirit film.  Awesome.  Hopefully there will be a Dick Tracy 2 or a new version. <br /> <br />I only rated this DVD/movie 4 stars for a couple of reasons.  Most of the cool villains die in the first 5 minutes and then the rest die by the end of the movie.  Even Flattop (one of the best villains in comic history)  I would of loved to see Dick Tracy 2 only feature Flattop.  Also, there are no special features.  Where's the History of Dick Tracy documentary.  Not here.  Oh well, still a great film and worth the money. <br /> <br />A Loyal Fan.

B000GYI32M|5.0|as many people found this season boring...i could say it was less rated than season 1 and 2...but this season isnt left out of drama!!! the kaitlin come back was genious! marissa kicked out of school too! volchok and marissa too! and marissa's death...as much as this season was a bit centered on marissa it was a good season..at the biggining i thought the season 3 episodes were getting exhausted...but then the finale changed everything! the Graduates was such a good episode...for Season 4 Marissa is dead...but Josh Schwartz will come back to write Season 4 and turn it to its old ways..so as i say i would think its a worth purchase object! for any oc fans!...if you are new to the show...start on season 1!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|V for Vendetta was certainly not what I expected. Instead of getting an in your face action flick about some do gooder we get a political film about an oppressive government using fear tactics to keep its people under control. And V is out to stop them. But is V really the heroic freedom fighter we are led to believe? Or has he become an evil himself? Who is V? Is he just some random guy? Is he some lunatic? Is he Eve's father? We don't really know. And even at the end of the movie we don't have a clue.<br /><br /> V for Vendetta is set is the near future in London England. Something has happened that has left the United States in ruins and the rest of the world in poverty. In England an evil fanatic has seized control of the government. By using the fear of terrorist and diesis this new leader is able to keep the people under his iron grip. It is not a total nightmare government the way Gorge Orwell's 1984 was, but give it some time and it could get that way. Than out from no where comes V who brings with him a message of hope. He wants to start a revolution and overthrow the government. His tactic is to destroy parliament and kill the dictator.<br /><br /> Obviously this movie is very political and not for the easily offended. If you can not stand people challenging your views than by all means skip this move. It will just make you faint anyway. Save yourself the aggravation. But for the rest of us who like debating other peoples views instead of slandering them, this is an amazing film. True it does some in fact talk about the Bush administration and the war against terror but reasonable people will not go out and slander the movie just for that. I am a republican Christian who is against gay marriage, and this movie has some pointed things to say about all of that. The government is a far right extremist group that justifies its actions somehow by saying it is the will of God. They murder Muslims and gay's and forbid any religion except Christianity while they try to justify what they are doing. But this movie doesn't just say \\"republicans are evil bla bla bla\\" it make its point in a very well written way. Muslims and gays are seen as people instead as enemies that so many people seem to think they are. Extreme right wing Christian fanatics are seen as just a dangeres as Muslim extremist, as in fact they are. Of course this movie slant to the left, but it does have a good message. Like don't ever give up your freedom, no matter what. Do not allow your government to use fear tactics to scare you into letting up your liberties. Never stop fighting, and if you must die for what you believe.<br /><br /> V for Vendetta is a very good film, do yourself a favor and go see it.stify what they are doing.

B000002UB3|3.0|There are quite a few good songs on here like maxwells silver hammer and oh darling, but a lot of the album is filler. If they just threw in a few more classics comparable to their timeless compositions \\"Ob li di, Ob li da\\" and \\"I am the Walrus,\\" it would have been a more well-rounded and cohesive album. I know most people are totally nuts over the Beatles, but I think this was really only the beginning. It's on their solo albums where their talents really shine. I have most of them except the John and Yoko one where John's weiner is hanging out on the cover. I just can't bring myself to purchase that and keep it in my home. I may try to find a censored version, but full male frontal nudity has no place in my music collection. Sorry, Mr. Lennon

B000GGSM7G|4.0|The Top is indisputably the Cure's most bizarre (though in some respects most representative) album. Now we have this 2CD remastering of an album long unavailable in the US, at roughly the same price as the original import. The ten tracks are indulgent, noisy, and all over the map, yet the album maintains a Dark Carnival unity: the frenetic drums and demented saxaphone rant of Give Me It could not be more different from the gauzy synths of Dressing Up, but together they are a perfect heroin fix. Throw in Robert Smith's most flamboyant vocal gymastics and strange experiments like The Empty World (a fife-and-drums number on the nihilism of war) and you have an album (and a band) in the midst of a breakdown. But then that's what makes the Top such an interesting trip. Only the Cure could bring you a record so simulataneously over the top and under the weather.  <br /> <br />A few notes on this release:  <br /> <br />DISC ONE (Remastering):  <br />The drum roll at the beginning of Shake Dog Shake is indeed slightly shorter--intentionally so, I believe. Bananafishbones is also noticably faster, correcting a mastering problem in the original release. The remastering gives more space to atmospheric tracks like The Wailing Wall, and brings out the brilliant percussion on the single, The Caterpillar.  <br /> <br />DISC TWO:  <br />As with the previous reissues, this mostly charts the development of the album tracks. Among the highlights are a demo of A Hand Inside My Mouth with lyrics from Six Different Ways (HOTD album track) and a demo called Sadacic, which eventually became New Day (b-side).  <br /> <br />If you have read this far, then you are ready to buy it.  <br /> <br />\\"Oh, I could be a polar bear,  <br />but it's impossible....\\" <br />
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Very stupid adaptation of the DC horror comic book not only lacks brains but also a lacks an actor who can pull off the complex role of John Constantine. Keanu Revees is gravely miscast as John Constantine, which is a shame because Reeves could have pulled off the role but with a screenplay that is so badly written, Keanu does not come out looking good at all and makes an complete fool out of himself in the process. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou manages to pull though this mess with their dignity intact and that's manly because they bring far too much acting talent to this badly made film. I suggest you see it for Weisz and Hounsou because they are the only good things about this bad movie.
B000002U82|2.0|There are a couple good songs on here but if your looking for good songwriting look elsewhere. Most of the album is filler. Self indulgent wanking solos that most people would have to be stoned out of their gourd to enjoy. If you want better examples of the american electric heavy metal guitar style I recommend: Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Judas Priest or the Scorpions.
B000002IU9|5.0|This was my first Manowar album I purchased and I was blown away.  I think Rhino's drum solo on the opening track is my favorite part of the whole album.  Just for the fact that when I crank my bass up all the way in my car and turn up the song I always get chills.  \\"Into Hades my soul Descends!\\"
B000G759LW|5.0|I knew I should expect something different, but then again, I always thought I sort of knew the lines upon which this album would fall...I was wrong.  That's not a good or bad thing.  Miss C has a lot to live up to after Stripped, especially with my personal favorite, Walk Away.  I was wanting all Walk Away's, which was unrealistic.  After listening through the double cd set today, I was more intrigued by all the differences that she used versus relying upon things she had known before, which is very dangerous.  Christina did it well though.<br /><br />To keep this brief...make sure to listen to the whole album, I think that is key.  When I hadn't finished the whole album today (had a meeting!) I was in the middle about what I thought...then once I made it to 'Save Me From Myself' the whole album sprung up, came together, and made me glad I bought it.  Save Me From Myself is one of the best songs I've heard in a long time, sweet, simple, and classy.  Add to it all the other wild variations xtina goes through on this album, you are definitely in for a ride.  This isn't Stripped, but I think that was the goal.
B00005S6K6|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites. Robert DiNiro and Meryl Streep are in the beginning innocently attracted to each other. As time goes on as Meryl is visiting her father, their love grows until it becomes entangled in lies and deceipt but a passionate affair. They are emotionally attached, but never get together physically. They know it is wrong, but they can't help falling in love with each other. The movie shows the turmoil of thoughts especially the scene when Meryl gets a phone call from Robert DiNiro asking her to meet him and she fights with her conscience about going. Unfortuately the situation doesn't allow her to go and the scene is so moving. They go their separate ways, only to end up together in the end at a later time. I love this movie and I can watch it over and over again. If you are sentimental you must see it. But don't hold judgement for them and don't take it as a threat to your existing happy marriage. My husband and I have been married for 34 years and still in love.
B000002UB3|5.0|I don't even own this album(yet) but I have faith in saying this is the best album ever.  It starts off with the instantly recognizable \\"Come Together\\", one of my favorite songs on the album.  \\"I Want You(She's So Heavy)\\" is also one of my favorite songs from Abbey Road.  The Song starts off sounding like Led Zeppelin, then a great Eric Clapton/Cream sounding solo comes in, and even some Black Sabbath riff-age to close it.  Every song on here is incredible - George's fine sounding \\"Something\\", Paul's upbeat \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\", This album is so good it's scary.  Some songs seem to melt together.   <br />  I'm pretty new to The Beatles, but they are definately my favorite. Abbey road is the best Beatles album, bar none. Sgt. Pepper's is amazing, but abbey road is Supurb. It should be the best album ever made.
B000002J6F|5.0|Great album, lots of solos and jams. Steven Stills and Manassas is a great buy if you like Still's other stuff or if you are looking for a good rock and roll album.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|great music and filming - we will enjoy this one over and over again - great value for the price!
B000062YAY|5.0|If you're looking for a live album to top all live albums by a thrash metal band, look no further than Slayer's 'Decade of Aggression'. This one floored me on the first listen, and I rank it among the best (if not THE best) live albums by any thrash metal band. Loud, clear, and in-your-face musical brutality and technical virtuosity by one of the best bands in the business. So go ahead and pick this baby up with confidence, crank it at home, crank it in the car! and just ENJOY!. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. Long Live Slayer!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I first discovered Dr Who many moons ago on local Public Broadcasting.  I rarely missed episodes through the many different Dr Who personifications.  I've really enjoyed the character interaction between the Doctor and his companion in this series.  The special effects are also worthy of this \\"modern era\\" reincarnation of the series.  If you are new to the Doctor - you'll be able to pick up very quickly about Time Lords and time travel.  May you enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed it.
B000002J6H|5.0|A  great solo effort. Really showing off what he can do alone. A great songwriter with a hell of a voice.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I received a copy of \\"Absolution\\" about two years ago for my birthday (thanks, Cliff) and I immediately liked it.  However, as I was listening to it a few weeks ago I had an experience that I had not had in quite awhile: a familiar but long dormant \\"click\\".  Not only did I like the album, I spontaneously \\"got\\" it.  Excited by this new perception, I fed my curiosity with a YouTube session that confirmed my suspicions: Muse is a brilliant band that distills some of the most artistic music of the `90s and combines it with long-standing rock traditions to formulate a distinctive 2K \\"electric\\" rock sound.<br /><br />Of these `90s influences, Radiohead looms large.  The dreamy and atmospheric side of Muse recalls the days when Thom Yorke and company still played identifiable instruments that actually moved air.  However, the distinctive ghost of Jeff Buckley haunts this recording in the voice of the impressive and talented Matthew Bellamy.  This combination of influences is further distinguished by good healthy dose of good old-fashioned post-\\"Grace Under Pressure\\" Rush (which is, admittedly, exciting to me).  To corroborate this analysis of influences, I found myself tempted to give a song-by-song synopsis, breaking down the references to the three aforementioned bands, but it quickly became too complicated.  While some songs exude more \\"Radiohead-ness\\" and others exude more \\"Rush-ness,\\" these influences blend seamlessly into one another to form a cohesive and singularly identifiable whole.  If I were to suggest a single track as a reference, the expansive \\"Butterflies and Hurricanes\\" covers all of the bases, as well as showing off Bellamy's prodigious keyboard skills.<br /><br />  In today's computer-driven soundscape, it seems unusual to emphasize keyboard playing in a rock format.  However, To extend the Rush comparison, lead singer Bellamy doubles on keyboards and guitar.  On several occasions, Rush's Geddy Lee considered himself to be a bassist first, a vocalist second, and keyboardist a \\"distant\\" third.  A close listen reveals that Bellamy's talents have a similar hierarchy.  First as a vocalist, and possibly the next heir to Jeff Buckley's legacy after Jimmy Gnecco's long-dormant band Ours.  Then his roles flow in the opposite direction: from strings to keys.  While he is an adequate rhythm guitarist, and his riffing, strummy style mimics Lifeson's wall of guitar, his keyboard work stands out as some of the most distinctive in its style that I have heard in a while, even in more exclusive prog circles.  However, in the contemporary days of Coldplay and Keane, Bellamy distinguishes himself in his toggling of acoustic and synthetic styles, rather like the great keyboardists of yesteryear (for lack of a better term, we will call it \\"the 70s\\").<br /><br />Despite all the attention I have devoted to Bellamy, Muse's musical identity on \\"Absolution\\" relies on the synergistic mix of their individual musical voices.  If any one of them were to leave, it would have dramatic implications for the group.  In realizing their colorful and dynamic arrangements, drummer Dominic Howard contributes significantly to the Rush atmosphere that permeates \\"Absolution\\".  His driving, creative style distinctively harkens back to the Neil Peart school of drumming.  Combined with the metronomically relentless Chris Wolstenholme's bass playing and impressive backup vocal abilities, they complete a power trio of devastating dynamic and emotive range.  It is probably unrealistic that they could match the longevity of Rush, but we can only hope that they could be allowed the similar time to evolve in such a way.<br /><br />The Lowdown:  It seems like it has really been a long time since an album clicked for me, but the Muse's \\"Absolution\\" broke this unfortunate trend.  Some recordings are best listened and shelved to collect dust, but \\"Absolution\\" is the gift that just keeps giving.  While it was released a few years ago, it is most likely my favorite recording of 2006.  If you missed it, I highly suggest you get it.t, I highly suggest you get it.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|Viewers offended by this movie are naive at best, but more likely insulted in finding out that their religion isn't as righteous as they believe it to be. Kingdom of Heaven doesn't acquiesce to political correctness because if that were truly the case, with our current political landscape, it would portray Christians as moral and just and Muslims as the \\"evildoers\\". But history isn't that simple and the corruption, violence and extremism that are portrayed in this movie, still exist today. Probably even more so.<br /><br />I felt that Ridley Scott was evenhanded in his depiction of both sides of the conflict and of King Baldwin, who managed to do what few have accomplished in Jerusalem--maintain a peaceful coexistence between Christians and Muslims. As is the case today, the militants and fanatics on both sides provoke their followers to break the peace and let their intolerance prevail.<br /><br />If you're narrow-minded or easily offended by realistic portrayals of religious fervor, then you may want to skip this film and pick up a safe Disney movie. Better yet, let your pastor/deacon/iman/mullah/rabbi or clergy of your choice suggest a movie that portrays their religion as morally superior. At least then you won't have to think for yourself.
B000001FLA|5.0|OK I admit it - I bought this album, my first Yngwie album, from a pawn broker for a couple of dollars because the cover looked cool. And all these years later I'm very happy I did. So thank you David Herrernan for the artwork that caught my eye.<br /><br />As for the music we find Trilogy is a continuation of Marching Out in many ways, the defiant lyrics against supernatural foe etc but we also find something totally new in the mix. A certain connectivity in the music and lyrics that was steadfastly absent from most of Marching Out. Lead cut and single You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget isn't too different from Don't Let it End but there is a feeling of this being more a song for the common man. Elsewhere we get Liar, again a straight down the line rocker about being hard done by.<br /><br />Trilogy succeeds because amongst the slightly simplified, less 'metal' structures there is a strong melding of more mainstream lyrical concern and tender moments such as the semi acoustic instrumental Crying to the full on racket of Fury and Fire. The goth metal of magic Mirror and Dark Ages show off new throat Mark Boals' abilities - and seriously how many great musicians did Yngwie bring to our attentions? And there is also the defining instrumental of Trilogy Suite Op.5. This latter easily joins Black Star and Far Beyond the Sun from the debut as prime time slices of Malmsteens musical vision.<br /><br />Malmsteen, on this better produced album, had the self confidence in the studio to come up with this amalgam of metal, hard rock and goth that has a number of very strong tunes on it. An example of how this album works is the aforementioned Liar which is at odds in many ways with the quasi romantic, quite gothic Queen In Love yet due to the full rock attack with which they are played they sit beside each other on this release happily.<br /><br />Theis would be my pick to any friend who was interested in Yngwie, along with Marching Out. To me this is perhaps the last 100% satisfying Malmsteen release. Great guitar work, fiercely talented fret burning backed by great vox and the backing band, here comprising Jens Johansson (keys) Anders Johansson (D) and the crisp and bright production values add up to a fine package of hard rock/ heavy metal.st 100% satisfying Malmsteen release.

0440418569|2.0|I too, like many of the other reviewers of this book, was very disappointed with the anticlimatical, convoluted conclusion to this trilogy.  But unlike many my disappointment has little to do with the heavy-handed anti-religion message of the book.  If I was somehow upset or offended by that I would have stopped reading book 1.  I was merely sad to see the story end the way it did with many characters seeming to have existed for no reason, and nothing really getting accomplished. <br /> <br /> <br />But on reflection, I wonder if the way the book was written was Pullman's ultimate \\"artistic\\" commentary on religion, life, etc.  In other words, maybe he is trying to say no matter how hard we look, life doesn't make any sense, and that religion(like the book) promises and exciting and rewarding payoff, but in the end only leaves you empty and confused.  If this is indeed the general idea of the style of the book, then perhaps this is the one that should have been titled \\"The SUBTLE Knife\\" because I think most people may have missed the point entirely.
0553588486|5.0|This book was just sitting there beside my bed for the longest time.  I had bought it one day because I had only 5$ left on a gift card. I might have remembered seeing it on someone's Fantasy Listmania List here on Amazon. Hmmm....I thought not particularly craving fantasy at the time...3.99$ Why not?<br /><br />So I included it in a giant cart of books. It was then the least desired book in my order.  And it sat there, by my bed, for the longest time. I was bored one night, again not particularly craving, nor in the mood for, fantasy. I picked it up and read the beginning. It was interesting, but I was not interested in starting a fantasy book at the time.  After another book or two I picked it up, yet again, and read the beginning once more. This time I was ready. I read on for more.<br /><br />I was instantly engrossed, so much so that when the writer chose to end the life of one of my favorite characters I threw the book aside, literally, and vowed never to read it again. I was pissed. From other reviews I suspect others have felt the same way with the author having killed off thier favorite character.  But I kept reading, that same night, until early in the morning. I stayed up way too late with this book, way too many times. I regretted it at work the next day, but never that night. I just wanted more. I tore through all four books in less then a month. And these are big books.  I learned that the books, the Series is not about any one character. It's really about the whole \\"time\\" that the book exists in. There are so many characters that I often am somewhat confused. But it is great that way. It's not a cookie cutter fantasy book at all. It's different, and stands alone. There is little magic with in the story of the book, but there is a ton of magic with in the book. The story is magically engrossing. I find myself wondering at times if I am enjoying it, this Song of Fire and Ice Series, more then I did Lord of the Rings. They couldn't be more different in style. LOTR has this elegant simplicity that leaves much to the imagination in a beautifully crafted way where as this Series is more drawn out for you, but nonetheless it has almost that same pull.  I read one review of this Series complaining that it was in need of a good editor. I couldn't disagree more. I find the depth of this book to be one of the most interesting things about it. Every Character truly, indeed, has a story behind them. It's awesomely vast.  I wish that some TV exec had the 'coglioni' to produce this entire series word for word for a 5 year series, perhaps on HBO (I'm dreaming here) and play out the book, and every scene, and character, almost word for word. I'd love that.<br /><br />But until then there is always the anticipation of another book.R has this elegant simplicity that leaves much to the imagination in a beautifully crafted way where as this Series is more drawn out for you, but nonetheless it has almost that same pull.

B000001FDQ|3.0|Nominated for a Grammy at the time the young Malmsteen bestowed upon the world this, his debut solo slab. Full of neoclassical runs and biting guitar work aplenty, this album was in some ways left behind by Yngwie almost immediately. I say that because while he often put instrumental tracks on his later albums this is the only (almost) totally instrumental album he's released, excepting his classical albums and compilations. And it's important to warn prospective buyers that there are in fact only two tracks with vocals, those being Now Your Ships Are Burned and As Above, So Below. Both tracks use gothic/heroic metal stylings to speak of topics close to the heart of Scandinavian metal - Viking blatherings and defiance in the face of adversity.<br /><br />The instrumental tracks here include some of Yngwies best. In fact the first two tracks here will really tell you if this album is for you, though it has tobe said other tracks such as Evil Eye don't always fire - farewell in particular is only 48 seconds of acoustic noodling. Elsewhere though we have the fifth track - Icarus Dream Suite Op.4 where Yngwie really stretches out and expands his vision. Knowing he was such a young man at the time increases my admiration of this track.<br /><br />And not only does Yngwie do himself proud but also the support band are solid. This album was my introduction to the work of the Johansson brothers (well, at least Jens) while Barriemore Barlow works the drums and a certain Jeff Scott Soto flexes his pipes on the two tracks with vox. The production is a little claustrophobic, it's dated a little but not fatally.<br /><br />In summation, despite my love of Yngwies work, this album is merely a springboard for his next few albums. Fans of Trilogy, marching Out and perhaps Odyssey should pick this up for a reasonable prices as Black Star, Far Beyond the Sun and Icarus Dream Suite Op.4 are well worth exploring. But this ain't the place to start your Yngwie experience.
B000G759LW|5.0|When you think of jazz legends, you think of Etta James, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, and now Ms. Christina Aguilera.  This album is by far one of the most feel good albums I've heard in a long time. Aguilera remakes jazz but adds an exquisite new twist.  This album will take you places.  It will remind old and young of the good old days.  This album is perfect for our time.  It's got tragedy, romance, and, of course, a lot of sexiness.  The word \\"sexy\\" is quickly changing from an adjective to a noun and Aguilera does just this with her new album. <br /> <br />Even though Back To Basics took four years in the making it was well worth the wait.  Each track was recorded with perfection.  One will get that gritty sound that one will not hear from albums made today.  Aguilera sings each of these tracks in high spirit, form, and phrasing.  \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" does exactly what it says.  \\"Back In The Day\\" takes you back to a place where music was defining for a generation.  It makes you feel good.  The horns in \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" are incredible.  I'm not sure what it is but \\"Understand\\" always gives me a chill.  \\"Oh Mother\\" makes me want to cry.  \\"Still Dirrty\\" proves that Aguilara is still the sexiest female alive.  \\"Candyman\\" sound a lot the Andrews Sisters \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" but the lyrics are absolutely original.  \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" is one of my favorites on the album.  You'll find \\"I Got Trouble\\" to be incredible when you think about how advanced our technology today is.  Anyone who has ever been hurt will find Aguilera's song \\"Hurt\\" to be phenomenal.  The blues and soul of \\"Mercy On Me\\" is stunning but the most amazing song on the album would be by far, the quietness of \\"Save Me From Myself.\\"  And finally \\"The Right Man\\" ends on a note that there is more to come in the world of Aguilera. <br /> <br />Christina Aguilera has finally found herself and she has never been more confident about it.  That's really what made all those \\"old souls\\" great.  We truly loved their songs, but what we loved the most was the spirit that was in those artists and Aguilera is right with them for the ride.  Baby Jane may just be the next legend in a long line of jazz artists. <br />
B00005JLWN|5.0|I thought that this movie was one of the best movies I have seen in my life. The movie has lots of good action and good drama. I would recommend this movie to people who love action.
B000001FOS|3.0|Odyssey is a strange twist of an album. It always felt to me that this album had tracks that suited the excellent Trilogy (Rising Force, Riot in the Dungeons, Crystal Ball) and others that seemed totally out of place such as the excremental Heaven Tonight.<br /><br />Had Malmsteens next album been comprised of rock of the likes of Hold On and Dreaming (Tell Me) this album could of been viewed as a transition, yet the studio LP that followed was Eclipse which was a very mainstream rock album, not at all like the weird time signatures of Hold On or the overly keyboard heavy Deja Vu and Crystal Ball. Which makes this album sort of stand out as out of synch with what followed and what came after.<br /><br />This album - featuring the much maligned Joe Lynn Turner on vox - is NOT the place for the newcomer to start on their Yngwie collection. It is for those who tried and liked Trilogy and Marching Out and Eclipse and want to explore further. For fans there are some gems here, such as the aforementioned Riot in the Dungeons and the great album.gig opener Rising Force and the often overlooked Faster than the Speed of Light. The latter track flying pell-mell to it's conclusion, full of firey vocals and great guitar work. There are also a couple of worthwhile instrumentals hera nd the production by Malmsteen and Jeff Glixman is bright and sparkly - no return to the slightly broody production of Marching Out. A flawed album not without it's high points.

B000BW7QX6|5.0|For some reason, there aren't enough really good science fiction movies.  We're given the light stories, the camp situations, and the over-the top plots and characters in abundance, but we don't often get really good science fiction movies that contain all the elements that make up a great story. SERENITY, however, delivers.  It has everything: interesting and layered characters, great dialogue, heart-stopping action, and a plot that pulls it all together.  I seriously hope there's a sequel.
0393327655|5.0|This book hits at the heart of a critical issue for American society where we have no words to start up a rational dialogue. Our standard of religious freedom in itself creates pressure to believe in a religion, and so we are forever frozen in a system that constrains our ability to understand morality in the context of today's times.  The book resonanted with me immensely in the way it delineates fact from fiction because it starts a meaningful dialogue of what it means to live an ethical life independent of a creator story telling us all the details to that life.  I encourage everyone to read it, in the hope that even religious readers gain a better appreciation of the value of separating church from state.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|Ever wonder what \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" would be like if it was set in high school?  Well, I have.  And even if you haven't, Rian Johnson's \\"Brick\\", an homage to classic film noirs, is well worth a look.    While there's many parallels to Dashiell Hammett's \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" (even the item the title refers to is sort of a modern equivalent of the \\"black bird\\"), as well as Raymond Chandler's mysteries and other stories of the genre, \\"Brick\\" has more than enough unique twists and turns of its own.  The story begins when anti-social reject Brendan (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) accepts a phone call from his ex-girlfriend (\\"Lost\\"'s Emilie deRavin).  She rambles off a series of slang terms and nicknames Brendan's never heard of.  Brendan immediately sets out to meet her face to face by infiltrating one social clique after another, starting by getting himself invited to a party hosted by a wealthy cheerleader and her jock boyfriend.  Two days later, Brendan discovers his ex's body.  He hides the body so he can bring the people behind her death to justice himself, at the same time making himself a suspect in her murder.    Several of the classic noir hallmarks are there.  There's the well-informed sidekick (Matt O'Leary), the intimidating crime boss (college-aged drug-dealer \\"The Pin\\", played by Lukas Haas), his hired muscle (Noah Fleiss), the troublesome junkie (Noah Segan), the by-the-book authority figure (Richard \\"John Shaft\\" Roundtree) and not one but two drop-dead-gorgeous femme fatales, cheerleader Laura (Nora Zehetner) and drama club member Kara (Meagan Good).  The hero dishes abuse, takes abuse, and cracks wise like a Humphrey Bogart character.  But everyone delivers their lines (riddled with slang terms from the 30's, 40's, and 50's, as well as several invented by Johnson) and actions so casually and with such conviction that they seem natural and the movie never devolves into spoof.  And, like any good film noir, the movie stays gritty without ever being crass or in bad taste.  All this with just a dollop of high school angst in the mix.    Nathan Johnson's score is one of the highlights of the film.  Like the movie, the score has an Indie feel, a contemporary feel, and a retro feel, all at once, with a hint of jazz.  Reoccuring character themes lend dramatic emphasis to the film.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt's performance will make you forget all about the role he played in the comedy series \\"3rd Rock from the Sun.\\"  But the true stand-out performance is by Nora Zehetner, who is glamorous in the best old-fashioned sense, and could definitely go places.
B000056HE9|5.0|A true hollywood classic.  Great acting and a wonderful story.  Heartwarming and enjoyable to watch.  Highly recommended.
B00005614N|5.0|Sure, these guys have been gone a long time and this was recorded a decade before that,  If you've listened to any classic jazz, you've almost certainly heard cuts from this album.  It's still a joy to listen to and a gem to hear it in its entirity.  The compositions are all Ellington's, but Satchmo and Duke make the music theirs together.  Mercifully, there are no \\"bonus track\\" outtakes here, but plenty of music nonetheless.  Aside from the pure talent of Armstrong and Ellington -- and their sidemen -- there is a chemistry between these two very different jazz legends.  To my ear, there is an enthusiasm at their only pairing in their respective 50 year careers, and a spontaneity that gives it a unique energy.  Underproduced by today's standards and under-rehearsed by their standards, the production is clean and energic.  Recorded in RCA's great Manhattan studios and masterfully remastered, the recording itself is second to none.  Groundbreaking?  No, but still a landmark because of what it is.  Best of all, though, it's just really, really wonderful to listen to.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|1988 saw the release of Return of the Living Dead Part II. This film is a sort of sequel/reboot of the first film in that the story and even some of the characters bare too much of a similarity to the original film. Ken Weiderhorn both writes and directs this \\"sequel\\" and it shows. The film reuses alot of what made the first film a cult-classic amongst horror fans. Weiderhorn seems to be of the philosophy that if something ain't broke them don't fix it. What this does is make the film feel like a deja vu, and maybe that was his intent since two of the main characters in the film say pretty much the same thing. Despite all this the film itself is pretty good and stays true to the original, albeit with abit more humor and better effects work.<br /><br />Reprising similar roles they had in the first film are James Karen as Ed and Thom Mathews as Joey. Both work as in the post-burial industry and moonlight stealing valuables from the privates crypts and mausoleum in the cemetary they're working in. Their characters act and almost have similar lines from Karen and Mathews' characters of Frank and Freddy in the first film. Karen as Ed goes over-the-top once the 2-4-5 Trioxin gas is let loose and the dead bodies in the cemetary begin to come back to life seeking live brains. It's these two characters who really keep the film from spiralling down to awful status. Even though their characters are similar to the original film, Karen and Mathews still bring a dose of great comedic timing and horror to the situation.<br /><br />This time around the town has been safely evacuated by the military except for a few people who lived on the newly-built suburban housing area in the outskirts. It's these survivors who must try and find a way to defeat the zombies and at the same time convince the military blockading the town that they're not infected. There's more action and comedy in this sequel. I think the comedy part of the film got way too much attention, but as I said earlier, Weiderhorn seems to think that if it worked in the original then it should work with more in this film. The effects work looks abit better and probably due to an increase in the budget.<br /><br />In the end, Return of the Living Dead Part II never bring anything new to the original its following-up and pretty much reuses the same characters and situations. Weiderhorn does this to good effect and the finished product is an entertaining enough horror-comedy. Who knows how this sequel would've turned out if Russo had written it and O'Bannon back directing., Weiderhorn seems to think that if it worked in the original then it should work with more in this film.

B0000028RR|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine enjoyed a respectable following in the 90's. They were apart of the funk/metal/rap movement that included Red Hot Chili Peppers , Living Colour,(though they were not straight rap) Beastie Boys, Scatterbrain, etc.<br /><br />Rage Against the Machine's sound was one of monster funk /metal riffs, especially on their first album \\"ST\\". Some say or think the Chili Peppers had a big influence on them, but I believe it was the granddaddy of funk/metal, Pat Travers, who was a major direct or indirect influence on many of these acts. Listening to the killer riffs on Rage Against the Machine \\"ST\\" has Pat Travers written all over them (maybe more than other 90's bands) from his 70's hey day (for those of you who don't know Pat & are interested, pick up \\"Putting it Straight, Heat in the Street\\" \\"Making Magic\\" \\"Go For What You Know\\"). So as I'm a big fan of Travers you could expect me to fancy this album \\"ST,\\" & I do, but one thing that knocks it down a notch for me is all the angry rapping. I'm not saying that Tom Morrello & Zack de la Rochado do not have legitimate grips about the world all around us, but 100% anger is overkill, though it does lend authority to these songs. Maybe I'm old fashioned,but growing up in the 70's, rapping is not my thing. I'll take singing every time, but I do like this album, how couldn't I? All the killer funk/metal done in great style, even a nod to the mighty Led Zep's \\"Kashmir\\" on \\"Wake Up,\\" the outstanding track on this CD, also the closing credits song on the first \\"Matrix\\" film.<br /><br />If you have a major funk metal jones like me, you could do much worse than picking up Rage Against the Machine \\"ST\\"!
B000AP04MO|5.0|This is a romantic drama different from others you might find in the genre. Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney play a couple who take repeated trips through Europe at various points in their life. The viewer watches them through the decades in out-of-sequence snippets as they fall in love, develop as a couple, have arguments, cheat, grow apart, and fall in love again. There's nothing melodramatic or contrived here, just a very honest look at how relationships change and carry on as we progress through life. Hepburn and Finney present real chemistry that makes them completely believable as a couple who've stayed together for so long. There's a beautiful, bittersweet score by Henry Mancini, and Stanley Donen continues to show why he was one of Hepburn's top collaborators.<br /><br />The dvd comes with a restoration featurette, a still gallery, and commentary by Donen. A great film for any couple who feel established and settled in their relationship, and shows just how strong love is through the ups and downs of life.
B000G759LW|5.0|I've always been a fan on Christina, from when she first came out to Stripped, but she has definitely become even more an inspiration to me after hearing this album. She's a true artist, and that's VERY rare these days. Not only the most amazing vocalist I've heard in my life, but she lyrically great as well. (Which she penned herself... rare too) This album is full of amazing 30's and 40's-sounding soul songs, with a new age twist. Each song has a message. Some more fun, but some very deep. 'Oh Mother' being one of my favorites brought me to tears when I heard it. 'Understand' is a beautifully sung and written love song. 'Mercy On Me' probably being my most favorite, is a deeply sung, strong semi-ballad. 'F.U.S.S.' is a very good skit as well, you should look a little deeper into what it means and WHO it's for... it's actually really funny once you figure it out. 'Makes Me Wanna Pray' is a more gospel inspired song, and it opens the album with her singing \\"What is this feeling coming over me/I'm taken back in disbelief/Is this really me?/In the mirror I see?/Staring back at me, could it be/A new reflection a woman complete?\\" Very true and a intelligent opening to one of the most amazing albums I've ever listened to. <br /> <br />If you love real talent, and real music... this album is definitely one I recommend.
1577314808|2.0|I'm a complete atheist (or very materialistic, as my dad likes to call me).  This applies not only to traditional one-God religions, but to all spiritual teachings, including Tolle's.  I believe that almost any spiritual book has good points, and if you read it attentively, you can distill them for yourself, and just ignore everything else.  Such is the case with this work.  There are certainly great ideas here - don't live too much in the past or the future, but instead try to focus on what you're doing now and don't resent it, and so on.  But all the spiritual mumbo-jumbo (sorry) of feeling the Being within yourself just passes me by.  Like other reviewers have said, Tolle's instructions on how to feel the Being in you aren't clear enough for me.  I understand that such is that nature of the experience, but I pretty much believe that he has undergone a profound spiritual change that cannot really be taught to others.
B000FZETIO|5.0|Another reviewer asked (and answered) some questions, to which I respond below.  First, I would like to say that Pretty in Pink is one of the best movies out of the Brat Pack opus.  It has it all, laughs, tears, good looking characters, and great music.  In sum, an all-around winner. <br /> <br />My answers to the following: <br />[Spoiler alert. Nothing overt, but I do touch on the ending indirectly.] <br />Burning questions for anyone who liked this movie: <br /> <br />Q. Why does Ringwald appear repulsed by Cryer the first time she sees him? <br /> <br />A. Because anyone that clingy is a bit repulsive. <br /> <br />Q. Why does Ringwald's best friend disappear halfway through the movie? <br /> <br />A. She died after the movie was finished.  Iona takes over as the mother that Andie needs at this point.  Jena is a friend.  Andie needs a mom. <br /> <br /> <br />Q. Speaking of Spader, why has he been chasing Ringwald for years if nothing about people outside of his social status appeals to him? <br /> <br />A. All rich boys like to slum, every once and a while...  don't you watch movies? <br /> <br />Q. Why are we supposed to think that Ringwald's perfectly decent house is trashy and shameful? <br /> <br />A. Because in comparison to Blane and Steph's houses, it is pretty shabby.  Besides, her dad is unemployed, sits around in his underwear and is  pretty embarassing to a 16 year old girl. <br /> <br />Q. Why in the novelization does Duckie get the leading lady and not in the movie? <br /> <br />A. Because in real life, any self-respecting girl in 1986 would have chosen Andrew McCarthy over Jon Cryer. <br /> <br />Q. Why, if the characters' emotions and actions are supposed to ring true, does Potts almost blind a customer with a staple gun? <br /> <br />A. Because it is a movie...  <br /> <br />Q. Why, if Cryer and Ringwald are in the same grade and therefore presumably the same age, can't he get into the same nightclub she can? <br /> <br />A. Andie is cool and has a fake ID, whereas Duckie is a misfit who rides a bike. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005UKE0|5.0|some say its the greatest ever, and some also say its the greatest post beatle record. I dont really agree with the greatest ever coz there are lots of great records out there. but I have to agree with the greatest post beatle record ever, Harrison at its most creative peak. I must say this is the greatest on that decade(70's), the big production by Spector and the cast of world class musicians, finally in this edition Clapton was credited coz he did an amazing job here, I cant imagine this record without Eric Clapton on guitars. And this record also proves that what if John and Paul gives Harrison to contribute more songs on the beatle records, it would have been great. A lot of Beatle fans are really wondering esp. if they own this record why most of these songs were rejected by George Martin, Paul McCartney and John Lennon, when its really clear that this is a collection of Elite songs or even better than the Lennon-McCartney songs. you can really see it on the reviews.....
B000002BYD|2.0|I know it's a matter of perception, taste and expectations but I personally found this recording to be bland, generic, uninteresting and just a low point in their career. <br /> <br />\\"Given to Fly\\" due to it's melodic flair, was the only song that peaked my interest of this recording; other than that song, I found YIELD to be a snoozer. Definitely, does not compare to their first two monumental albums.
B000G759LW|5.0|I have to give Christina props for taking such a huge risk with making such a big departure from the cookie-cutter sound of what pop music is \\"suppose\\" to sound like today. Judging by reading newspaper and magazine reviews along with online fan reviews it sounds like it will be a success for her.<br /><br />When I heard months ago that she was going to take on a whole new sound not to mention a whole new era with the 1920's, 30's and 40's......I did not think it could be pulled off. But, Christina not only pulls it off but, she pulls it off very well. She takes elements and sounds from that time and mixes them with todays sound and it comes out brilliant.<br /><br />Before listening to this CD, I would have been happy with another Stripped like CD - I thought that CD was amazing. But, if artists' continued to re-create themselves in that fashion there would be no evolution in music and there would be no difference in sounds between artists', which happens too frequently as it is. But, the true creative artists' venture out and do things outside of the box and show just what makes them talented and more than just a voice.<br /><br />There is quite a diversity of songs on Back To Basics. Yes, there is a lot of horns and a lot of references to the pioneers of yester-year (Billie Holiday, Nina Simone etc...), loud cymbals and muffled singing, like that of the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Yet, Christina, can still belt out a true, gut wrenching ballad like that of \\"Beautiful\\" or \\"The Voice Within\\". This is apprent on the VERY exquisite: \\"Hurt\\" - one of my favorite songs on this multi-track set. \\"Oh Mother\\" is another great example of this as well. It's a song speaking of how strong Christina's Mother was through all the abuse of her Father while growing up. The CD starts out with a real feel good song that just makes you want to dance: \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" - backed with a full choir and an infectious beat, this song is a great start to this great 2 disc set! \\"Still Dirrty\\" - is another great dancey song with a nod to 2002's original \\"Dirrty\\", for sure a hit made for the radio...just a reminder that she can still get down!  :)  Another brilliant song on here is: \\"Candyman\\" - this is a fun song that cannot help but to make you smile. It reminds me a big of \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" by Bette Midler. Actually I could see Bette singing this song, it is right up her alley. It's jazzy, dancey and all around fun! \\"I Got Trouble\\" is another real bluesy, throwback-type song complete with the rag thrown over the mic with the crackle sound for effect for the genuine sound from that era. FANTASTIC!!<br /><br />There is too many songs to critique and to review. They are all great! It's a must have for anyone's collection. IF you are a fan of Christina or a fan of jazz/blues, pop, Billie Holiday, Nina Simone - This CD will please ALL!irrty\\" - is another great dancey song with a nod to 2002's original \\"Dirrty\\", for sure a hit made for the radio...just a reminder that she can still get down!  :)    Another brilliant song on here is: \\"Candyman\\" - this is a fun song that cannot help but to make you smile.

B000G759LW|5.0|In this day and age, there are so many artists out there who feel they are doing something \\"ground-breaking\\", or \\"different\\" than everyone else. Granted, some of them are, (I've never heard a song like \\"SexyBack\\" by Justin Timberlake before). Then, there are some that are just like the rest, and are mooching off of everyone else's sounds that are beat to death: (sorry Paris, you're guilty). <br /> <br />Christina Aguilera is definitely not one of these people. Guaranteed. This album has got to be one of the most different (and still extremely catchy) albums I've ever heard. It's a musical rollercoaster, going from a bluesy, jazzy feel (Back In The Day\\" to hip-hop, R&B-infused cuts like \\"Slow Down Baby\\", to songs with a rock-edge (Welcome), where it makes it obvious she's working with Linda Perry again. To keep this short, I'm just going to say that if you want something different, add this album to your shopping cart. Christina isn't going anywhere, and she makes that known in this album, not only from her song \\"Here To Stay\\", but from the outstanding talent oozing from every track on this album.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This CD is wonderful.  Ray Charles is classic and soulful.  The \\"company\\" is fabulous!
B000FIMG68|5.0|_Lost_ is sometimes a frustrating show: too many stories, too much mystery, and not enough answers. I am impatient and so I watched S1 on DVD and bought S2 from iTunes. Even in having watched it all in a relatively short amount of time, I was felt that few storylines ever concluded. It is also safe to say that S2 was slower than S1. Watching S2 of _Lost_ will be particularly thrilling for those willing to wait. That said _Lost_ is still a remarkable series, and, despite the pace of S2, I still prefer it to S1 in some respects. _Lost_ is not only about action and suspense; it is about society and philosophy. In S2, philosophical concepts are fleshed-out and come into conflict. <br />Something that makes _Lost_ such a terrific show is the intelligent writing. And by this, I do not mean the predictable dialogue which tends to pop up from time to time (usually out of the mouth of Jack, our hero without imagination); what I mean is that references in this show and attention to detail are amazing. John Locke, Desmond David Hume, and Danielle Rousseau are three characters worth mentioning. John Locke, David Hume, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau were all philosophers who focused on the issues of civilization vs. nature, social contract, laws, government et cetera. No themes could possibly be more appropriate for a show about people suddenly stranded on a deserted island, as people who were previously comfortable in civilized society are forced to live without property, laws, or government. As they try to recapture the essence of the familiar law and forge an unofficial government of sorts, there are many interfering factors which force them to sometimes abandon a set rules not suited for their present lifestyle.  <br />The names of the characters (Locke, Rousseau, Hume) are of course references in themselves, but it is the way that these characters were written and how they manage to make philosophical debate spark within a popular television show which is truly interesting and all-too-rare. Not only do the characters make what their respective philosophers wrote and believed come alive, they show the conflict that arises between these different philosophical viewpoints. It is a philosopher's dream to encounter a show such as _Lost_; and to be able to see a \\"what if\\" simulation of what each philosopher would have done if he were on this island is a pleasure. The writers even allude to the personal lives of these philosophers through the characters, and despite the all-too-striking resemblance, they somehow managed to make it subtle, and the characters seem as if they're anything but plagiarized. <br />I will not go into detail so as to not ruin the experience for those who have not yet watched _Lost_. <br />There are also many other references -- cleverly inserted names and events -- which make the show all the more enjoyable. <br />You do not have to be familiar with or be interested by the references to appreciate _Lost_; but this is what sets it apart from other TV action-dramas; this is what makes it great.
068987474X|1.0|I did not like this book at all. I agree with what the point of the book is, to not waste your time. After that, the book is not going to really help women or men. The basic principle of the book is that if a man is into you he will stop at nothing to get you, and if for some reason he does not do any of the things they mentioned in the book cut him loose. If he forgets to call when he says he was going to\\" he is just not that into you\\". Always give him your phone # never get his, because that he is try to be lazy and make you call him.... huh?A man will always ask out a woman he is attracted ,no matter what because according to Gregg and Liz must think  men are non thinking on emotional robots. One of my favorites is if a man is attracted to you it does not matter if you are his boss, come on! Let just say my female boss winks and smiles at me .Do I risk my job because I'm into her, lets say I ask her out and she says yes and does not fire men for sexual harassment or anything like that. If for any reason it doesn't work out I still have to work with her, and guess what she is still my boss! The point is there are a lot of really good guys out there that are into you, but you will never give them a chance if you follow this book. They may be really into you, but fail one of these stupid test. Maybe he was nervous about making the first move, but he's into you so he does, you go on a couple of dates and one night you invite him up. He declines, according to the book \\"he is just not into you \\"so cut him loose,\\". This scenario (as some of you may know) comes from the episode of Sex in the city that the phrase \\"he's just not that into you\\" comes from. Later on in the episode we find out he had very embarrassing stomach issues. Again Gregg dismisses this as it never really happens, basically real life does not apply to men. Just for one second lets turn the turn this around, picture your dating life  if men used the things that this book is saying what would happen, behonest .  All I'm saying is take each relationship on a case by case basis. Use common sense, if you still want to follow this book as\\" law\\" you might find a good man that's into you.  You might also win the lottery, ride a unicorn, and win a trip to mars all in the same day. There are 2 kinds of guys that 99.99% of you will get using this book. One is a spineless jellyfish who does everything you want and never complains or stands up for himself, by the way you will cheat on him within the first year of the marriage. The second is the  kind of man that will stop at nothing to get you,  who will say and do whatever it takes  though \\"he is not that into you \\"at least not for the long run. He's just looking for the conquest, and your good friend Gregg is setting you up for him. Thanks Gregg/Liz. for making it easy for us.

6300214753|5.0|Matthew Broderick stars in this very funny film about a high school student who decides to take a day off of school.  What happens next can only be described as remarkable and somewhat crazy. <br /> <br />Broderick stars as Ferris Bueller, a somewhat clever and deceitful (in a funny way) high school senior who, along with his best friend Cameron (Alan Ruck) decide to skip school and visit the sights and sounds of downtown Chicago in springtime.  Ferris convinces Cameron to take his father's prized red Ferrari out for the day.  Reluctantly, Cameron agrees, and soon the two are off on their adventure.  Their next plan is to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane (Mia Sara) out of school so she can go along.  Ferris and Cameron devise a plan to call the school and tell Dean of Students Ed Rooney (Jeffery Jones) that Sloane's grandmother passed away.  Dressed in a long trenchcoat and hat, Ferris arrives at the school to pick up Sloane, and the three drive happily away.  However, Mr. Rooney suspects that something is up and immediately suspects that Ferris is at the root of it.  He sets off to find Ferris himself and bring him back to school.  By the end of the movie, Mr. Rooney probably wishes he had stayed in his office. <br /> <br />Meanwhile, Ferris' sister Jeannie (Jennifer Grey) has figured out what Ferris is really doing.  Angry that Ferris seems to get away with everything, she has to deal with the entire school taking up a collection for poor, sick Ferris while she really knows what is going on.  In the end, though, she proves to be a big help to him. <br /> <br />After heading downtown, the trio take the Ferrari to a local parking garage.  Cameron's father knows the exact mileage of the car, so Cameron is already nervous about allowing Ferris to drive it.  But that's just the beginning.  The garage attendant decides to take the car out for a joyride and racks up over 180 more miles on the odometer. <br /> <br />During their day,Ferris, Cameron, and Sloane manage to seethe Sears Tower, a Cubs game, visit the Art Institute, and see Ferris sing \\"Twist and Shout\\" from a parade float.  But when they head back to the garage to get the car, Ferris finds out about the extra mileage, and Cameron goes crazy.  Ferris seems to think that by driving backwards that the miles will come off, so they jack the car up in the garage and put it in reverse.  However, the miles don't come off.  Cameron, having suffered through a tumultuous relationship with both of his parents, takes out his aggression on the car.  Soon, it goes careening out of the back of the garage and lands in a pile of trees.  Cameron actually feels relieved because now his father will actually have to talk to him.  But Ferris realizes that he has only 5 minutes to get home before his parents do.  Will he make it in time? <br /> <br />This movie has attained a sort of \\"cult\\" status over the years and still remains as funny as ever.  Matthew Broderick is perfect as the scheming Ferris, while Jeffery Jones does a very good job as Mr. Rooney.  Jennifer Grey plays the part of the overlooked and jealous sister perfectly, and Alan Ruck's job as the reluctant and somewhat confused Cameron is the perfect companion to the wild and reckless Ferris.  Let's not forget the funny cameo by Ben Stein as the teacher who coined the term \\"anyone, anyone, Bueller?\\"   <br /> <br />I recommend this extremely funny movie very highly.  The acting is great and the story is very funny.  As a Cubs fan, I was glad to see the scenes in Wrigley Field and hear Harry Caray's voice.  Watch this great movie and see how much trouble and mischief three friends can get into in one day.
B0000AUHPG|4.0|This movie is  SLOW and LONG (2 hours 35 minutes)----the \\"desperados\\" stand around glaring and arrogantly smiling at each other minute after minute!  But, with the likes of Henry Fonda and Jason Robards and Charles Bronson on screen doing the smiling and glaring it almost becomes interesting!  And then there's the \\"Italian Lady\\"---oooo la la!  She is \\"candy for the eyes\\"....so, even though this thing is S L O W moving,  I enjoyed it anyway---especially due to the fact I was able to \\"take a break\\" from it for a day and divide it into two parts!

B000G759LW|3.0|There is a lot of information going on in Aguleria's new doube disc, we learn that she is still \\"Dirrty\\" and love's her husband but the key factor to her new music is her love of old school artists, ranging from Etta James to Gladys Knight, but there are problems riddling this disc. <br /> <br />Aguilera comes off as cold in some of the songs, actually, a better part of the discs, you are left scratching your head looking for the soul behind the voice. She offers you her best notes, but they come out of nowhere such as in songs like \\"Hurt.\\" <br /> <br />The best tracks are \\"Ain't no other Man\\" with its loose horns and Aguleria's vocal runs, that she has finally learned to control and the other stellar gem, \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray,\\" she gets out sung by her backing choir and it shows and hints at what Aguilera lacks, the entire album unlike the songs of those she wants to immitate just lack the sense of being lived in. The Andrew Sister's may comeback and sue her, for \\"Candyman\\" but its the best track on the Linda Perry produced second disc. Its nothing but bubble gum 50's fun. <br /> <br />Aguilera's disc is great and should be heard, with any hope it will open the eyes and ears of youngsters who need to search out the artists Aguilera roll calls. She gets credit for tackling a style of music that's been ignored by the mainstream pop audience for no apparent reason, but she needs to go deeper than just the surface.
0060853964|5.0|Crowley (formerly Crawly--the serpent in the garden of Eden) and the angel Aziraphale have been working for centuries, spreading a little evil (or good), yet building a sort of accommodation as well. Both have come to enjoy their human charges--and the unexpected decisions they make. Well, yes, the world really is a sort of Chessboard where God and Satan play out their game, but it's a nice Chessboard, and Crowley and Aziraphale would miss it if it were gone.<br /><br />When Crowley gets word that the time has come, the Anti-Christ is ready for delivery, he knows better to disobey orders. He drops the infant at the hospital run by Satanic nuns and authorizes the switch. Neither he, nor Aziraphale expect the minor mixup--the infant Anti-Christ going to a working class English couple rather than to the American diplomat scheduled to receive him. Prophesy keeps its schedule, of course--helped along by the \\"Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch.\\" The four riders of the apocalypse (with pollution replacing plague) don't require ancient Biblical battlegrounds to create the end of the world--they can do their work from well-connected Air Force bases on English soil. And with his power suddenly awakening, and filled with visions of UFOs, environmental destruction, hollow earth, and Tibetan tunnels spanning the globe, Adam Young, the Anti-Christ, is ready to create a new world--a better world where his three friends can each rule continents.<br /><br />Authors Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett combine to create a story that is simultaneously laugh-out-loud funny and highly thoughtful. Admittedly, the characters are a bit one-dimensional (but then, it's hard to expect War, Death, and the like to have really complex characters), but they ask interesting questions. Gaiman and Pratchett deliver plenty of British humor and the type of offbeat characters that make their works so popular.<br /><br />I suspect that the world would be a better place if lots of people were to read GOOD OMENS and really think about it. I also suspect that they'd have a lot of fun with it. Very nice.ople were to read GOOD OMENS and really think about it. I also suspect that they'd have a lot of fun with it. Very nice.

The book satisfied my curiousity and I would recommend it to anyone curious about this specific group of individuals.
B00005YU1O|4.0|An amazing movie, truely, the philosophy in it are almost impossible to just simply forget and it makes you think about life in a new way. Basically its like a college course about psychology in about two hours. Although at some point or another it just fell short. Some of the actors chosen where magnificent! Giving a great performance for such a hard subject that they had to express from their character. All the others...well, it didn't even seem like they were trying to act at all!! I remember some part in the film where a character was mumbling, and I couldn't even understand him, so much for philosophy that part of the movie. Besides that I found the score for the movie just boring, and didn't strike any emotion in me at all. The animation used on top of the actual picture, I thought, was a billiant thing, to make more of a dream. But unfortunately that too can be a tad bit annoying. The buildings swaying in the background add more for it to seem like a dream, but while everything is shifting in the background, you can get distracted from the characters that are RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU
B000G759LW|4.0|..... this is a great album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />disc one <br />---------- <br /> <br />1: INTRO(BACK TO BASICS) <br />its like in stripped, her talking about what the album will be about. just an intro. better than the one on stripped. longer than stripped's intro. 6/10 <br />2: MAKES ME WANNA PRAY <br />cute. she's singing about her man, how he, well, makes her wanna pray. its simple, gospel influenced. so-so. 6/10 <br />3: BACK IN THE DAY <br />the disc's first true jam. its cute, she tries payin respects to her legends, but turns out to be a catchy tune we can blast in the car. catchy chorus, feels good, like back int he day hehe. 8/10 <br />4: AIN'T NO OTHER MAN <br />aw, yea. sooky sooky, baby. a great 1st single, the most different track on the discs. it stands out. its the 30's glam era sound, u get more of this sound on disc two. a fun song. 9/10 <br />5: UNDERSTAND <br />this is one of those soft twinkly songs. it has a cute sample from one of her legends that pulls it out of complete bubblegum ballad, so thank god for it. its cute, not bad, but one u'd press skip on. 4/10 <br />6: SLOW DOWN BABY <br />picks up from the last track. the era horns in the background save it from mundanity. again, nothing special, keeps u hoping that disc 2 is better than this. and it will be :)  4/10 <br />7: OH MOTHER <br />in the last album, she brought us \\"im ok\\", a track about her abusive father. this track follows it, with a more hip hop beat, a hip hop ballad to her mother, in appreciation. its... ok. 5/10 <br />8: FUSS <br />aw, yea. here we go. the man she was singing to in \\"stripped\\" in songs like \\"fighter\\" and \\"walk away\\" returns in this song with a message of her telling him she hasnt forgotten about his lousy ways of the past. a good mellow, funk filled, emotion ballad. its cute, it feeels good. the album pops a gem with this one, its pleasant. 7/10 <br />9: ON OUR WAY <br />this track reminds me of a song ive heard by another artist, i cant figure it out.its nothing special. but not bad. typical album stuffer, thrown in to continue the album on a mundane note. thats not a bad thing either, just not a shocking track that stands out or anything. 5/10 <br />10: WITHOUT YOU <br />damn. one of the best tracks from the cd. the begining riffs just start it off like gold. that guitar with her high pitched melody of a voice, the bird singing, its beautiful. this is a classic, reminds me of \\"loving me for me\\" off stripped. a golden track. 9/10 <br />11: STILL DIRRTY <br />this is a fun track. its funky and soulful. its really cute. sux that disc one picks up at the end. but this is a very cute track, fun to sing along to, her saying she's still a cute freak nasty woman, its cute. 8/10 <br />12: HERE TO STAY <br />meh. just her saying she's not going anywhere. not the best track at all, a skipper actually. cant say muchf or it butt hat its nothing exciting. at least her voice sounds amazing. 3/10 <br />13: THANK YOU(DEDICATION TO THE FANS) <br />its what it is. a dedication. but its really good actually. it mixes her old genie song at the beginning. hearing the fans talk in the song can come off as either annoying, corny, or cute and emotionally fulfilling. its not a bad track, kinda clever. keeps the beat mellow. 7/10 <br /> <br /> <br />disc two <br />----------- <br /> <br />1: ENTER THE CIRCUS <br />kinda scary, kinda cooky, kinda over the top. but it starts the album in attempt to shock u, telling u that this is gong to be the disc that makes the last one almost unimportant to the disc set. u dont hear christina at all in this track, just a theater track. opener. cute. 6/10 <br />2: WELCOME <br />its powerful, feels like the track one, it has feeling, it has gut, it has emotion, it makes u feel something with the violins in it. she has melody with ranges. a good powerful, strong introduction. 8/10 <br />3: CANDYMAN <br /> buy the entire album for this track alone. nothing has been released in music for years in the pop charts like this track. tracks like these r needed. its 30's!

B0002OERI0|5.0|Well, on Green Day I came a couple of years ago by what else than BASKET CASE. On the radio I had also already heard WHEN I COME AROUND, of course, but the BIG hit in Germany only made the band really interesting for me. But really be a FAN only AMERICAN IDIOT made me!!!! At first I saw the video of AMERICAN IDIOT on MTV, then BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS became the huge hit of the CD, and I couldn't help buying the album. AND I NEVER REGRETTED IT, STILL DON'T AND WILL NEVER DO!!!!!! Be it AMERICAN IDIOT, BOULEVARD OF BROKEN DREAMS, HOLIDAY or WAKE ME UP WHEN SEPTEMBER ENDS - this CD is actually my best English sung one at all at the moment, and added to it, it reminds me to my AWESOME exchange year in the US from January to June 2005 when BOULEVARD was the number one in the US charts for months, and it was also played up and down the radio stations. GREEN DAY ROCKS!!!! Their music NEVER gets boring, even though it's just 3 - accords - punkrock music all the time...
B000FSME1A|4.0|The movies are spread out over two discs with its extras. The biggest omission and the most common criticism leveled at this new set is Hearts of Darkness. The producer of this set has responded that its exclusion was due to legal reasons (whatever that means) and in the process the film's legendary troubled shoot is largely glossed over in the extras. This bit of revisionism on what assumes was Coppola's decision is a bit troubling but the checkered past of the production has been documented extensively elsewhere, most notably in The Apocalypse Now Book by Peter Cowie.<br /><br />That being said, Coppola's commentary for the movies is actually quite good. Coppola tells all kinds of fascinating anecdotes, like the origin of Colonel Kilgore, and provides many factoids, like the creation of the \\"Valkryies\\" sequence, associated with making the movie. The Redux commentary is essentially the same but with new comments over the added footage.<br /><br />In the film, Kurtz reads excerpts from T.S. Eliot's poem, \\"The Hollow Men\\" and this extra features Brando's reading of the entire poem with all kinds of unused footage.<br /><br />\\"Monkey Sampan\\" is a cut scene of the natives in Kurtz's compound singing their own unique rendition of The Doors song, \\"Light My Fire\\" that is kinda creepy - the desired effect I'm sure.<br /><br />Also included are \\"Additional Scenes\\" taken from the work print and features, most significantly, additional footage of Scott Glenn's mysterious character and we also find out what happens to Dennis Hopper's photojournalist.<br /><br />For those interested in the technological aspects of the movie, the \\"A/V Club\\" is a collection of featurettes that explore how the origins of the 5.1 surround because, at the time, Coppola wanted to create an epic, Hollywood war film. A second featurette takes a look at the sound design work on the haunting helicopter sound at the beginning of the movie. A text article about the synthesized score is also included. Finally, there is an FAQ that addresses some common questions like the film's proper aspect ratio, the five and half-hour cut and the notion that there were multiple endings.<br /><br />\\"The Post Production of Apocalypse Now\\" is comprised of four featurettes that can be viewed separately or altogether. The first one explores the daunting task of editing a million feet of film stock into a coherent movie. The second featurette takes a look at how the film's score was composed. The original temp track featured songs by The Doors but it was too obvious and so a synthesized score was created with Coppola recruiting the top five artists in the world of this kind of music. The next featurette examines the film's complex sound design and how the director employed Dolby Surround Sound which was virtually unheard of at the time. He wanted to recreate the psychedelic dimension of the times with sound - the effect of a bad acid trip. In conclusion, the final mix is explored. Technicians mixed the movie for nine months, which was very unusual at the time, but required for the intricate soundscape that blended dialogue, music and sound effects.<br /><br />\\"PBR Street Gang\\" features interviews with the actors who played the crew of the boat that takes Willard to Kurtz for the release of the Redux version. All of the actors praise Coppola's knack for allowing them to feel comfortable enough to improvise and immerse themselves in their respective characters.<br /><br />\\"Apocalypse Now and Then\\" juxtaposes footage of the film's original screening at the Cannes Film Festival in 1979 with Redux's premiere at the same festival in 2001. At the time of the original, it wasn't even finished but Coppola wanted to screen it in an effort to quell criticism in the press that it was going to be an expensive failure.<br /><br />Finally, there is \\"The Color Palette of Apocalypse Now\\" that examines the Technicolor process that gave the film its vivid look. The Redux version allowed cinematographer Vittorio Storaro a chance to realize his original vision for how the film should look.inematographer Vittorio Storaro a chance to realize his original vision for how the film should look.
B000000OPQ|4.0|Very good 80's soundtrack covering a lot of different styles of music from that era. Features the very hard to find Madonna song \\"Gambler\\" I don't know why this song was never a radio hit, maybe because the opening of the song sounds a lot like \\"Maniac\\" from Flashdance. <br /> <br />Standout track: Change by John Waite featuring a young Patty Smythe from Scandal on background vocals.
0452270073|3.0|The anti-war novel, \\"Regeneration\\", attempts to portray the severity of the Great War by guiding the reader through the minds and lives shell-shocked soldiers in a hospital undergoing different forms of recovery. Pat Barker uses real poets such as Siegfried Sassoon and others as examples throughout the book, which acts as evidence for her case- yet the novel has a slight sense of fiction and it detracts from the feeling I believe she was trying to convey to the readers. Barker also analyzes the dreams and thoughts of the mental patients in order to examine exactly how WWI affected the minds of the surviving soldiers.  <br /> <br />Although I understand how greatly the war affected the soldiers mentally, I do not believe that Barker was particularly strong at showing this fully. Although she used existing people, their stories didn't seem such. I found that there was also plot left unsettled or underdeveloped, particularly with the love story between Sarah and Prior and the hanging ambiguity in patients' sexual orientations (although that may have been intended).  <br /> <br />Though I found some of Barker's dialogue hard to follow and some of her metaphors over the top, the novel was generally comprehensible and a quick read. I think that if one were to want a general feel of the effect of WWI and the anti-war sentiments that were felt afterwards, particularly by Sassoon, this would be a great book to start with. However, I believe that there are better choices for those that wish to delve into a more realistic, first-hand account of the occurrences and affects of WWI.  <br />
B000002KIE|4.0|Before I deal with all of the little \\"punk\\" kids, let me honestly review the album.  Let's begin with the songs.  I hope it's not nostalgia speaking, but the songs on this record are incredible.  They are infectious.  The energy is raw and the songs surge forward as if unstoppable.  How can anyone listen to Liar or Seventeen and tell me this album is dull?!?  We also need to place this album within historical context.  Yes, The Ramones were already out and doing their thing in NYC, but they remained largely obscure for years.  Punk rock is not meant to be underground music...it's balls-in-your-face music that stands up in the middle of a crowd and proclaims loudly and flamboyantly that \\"I count too\\".  This album and the scence that it helped create were about  the democratization of rock music.  No longer did you have to have the right look and the right sound and the right connections. <br /> <br />Now, let's deal with these so-called \\"punk\\" kids that bash the album.  This album is a bit of an ugly mess, but that ugly mess is the heart of punk rock.  I know that you think the bands you listen to are punk because some record store slapped a label on it, but what you're being sold are Hyrox cookies and not Oreo's.  I hope that analogy isn't lost on you.  Maybe this album is too ugly for your sensitive mall-punk ears...maybe you can't handle the dissonance and prefer something that's perfectly tuned and perfectly sterile....maybe Blink182 is as intense as you can handle.
0143034901|4.0|A real page turner. You will have trouble walking away and will feel the need to keep reading. It will be worth it.
B00008438V|5.0|I could never get enough of this movie, I still think its as funny now as it was then. It takes the nerdy male fantasy to another level the way a nerd only knows how, with its computer.
0064407667|5.0|This book influenced my life because it taught me that things don't always go the way you want them to.  It also taught me that you should be thankful for what you have. And that there is a lot of bad people in the world.  Another way that it influenced me is that I can make or do anything as long as I set my mind to it.  It also taught me that reading is a good way to learn new things.
0767818040|5.0|Let me put it like this, this movie is not a big deal, a head scratcher, please, HELL NO.! I just like it cause it FUN, I mean Melaine Griffith as a Porn Star is so funny ...more Camp than Thrills for me and Frankie goes to Hollywood indeed \\" Relax...Don't do it\\" and Mr. De Palma's last shot while the credits are rolling is CLASSIC. Dont think, just watch !;)
B000G759LW|5.0|I love this CD from Christina Aguilera. The first single is entitled Aint No Other Man.  This song gets my body moving. I love the horns playing on this song. Makes Me Wanna Pray is another one of my favorite tracks.  This song is very uplifting.  I love the choir singing in the background. background.  Steve Winwood helps out on the organ here, and it sounds very good.  Understand  and The Right Man are two beautiful  song about how a special  person can change your attitude about life.  Candyman is a fun upbeat track.  This song is a definite gem on this disc.  Nasty Naughty Boy is a sensual erotic track.  I like this song very much.  Fuss is a very smooth sounding track.  This is a song about a relationship that did not work out.  Here To Stay is an excellent song about living life on your own terms and making your own decisions.  Still Dirty is a song about everyone has a wild side to their personality.  Back in the Day is a nice tribute to all of the great singers of the past like Billie Holliday and Louis Armstrong.  Thank You is a special song dedicated to all the Christina fans out there.  This is a very entertaining CD.
B00004TFRF|5.0|Weird , Wicked , Wonderful. If you want to get creeped out , this movie will get under your skin. Mutiple views needed to understand, almost ten years later and I still dont get it... Can anyone help? Mind Twisting Erotic Fun. Cool Soundtrack.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|This has been a great show to watch with our family (teenage kids). We would love to be able to watch and own every Everwood episode on DVD!
B0000025RI|5.0|Best Pop album of our generation..bar none...From the opening snare stabs of Wanna Be Startin' Something on through The Lady In My Life...this collection of songs puts the \\"magic\\" in ..you guessed! Magical! Sublime studio musicians, crafty songs and Q's executive duties, and of COURSE MJ's one-of-a-kind vocal/song contributions and least not his incredible mastery of melody and groove..You have not LIVED until you hear this POP masterpiece..Every song shines! Beat It..Human Nature...and Billie Jean..I still listen to this album after 23 years...it's fresh, it's vibrant...and the beats don't stop til you get enough.
B000G759LW|5.0|With Christina Aguilera's comeback, yet again, she has reinvented herself to keep her fans on their toes and also, to reflect her musical versatility and current stage in life. With her third major effort \\"Back to Basics,\\" she does not fail to impress even the toughest critics with her golden voice, amazing lyrics, and musical originality, packed with the X-factor her industry peers so desperately lack and therefore, crave for.<br /><br />How does \\"Xtina's\\" third \\"baby\\" fair? It is definitely good, surely. Grammy worthy. The album, which is a double record of 23 tracks including interludes and a behind-the-scenes video, is a concept CD infused with the sensibilities of the past--particularly the 20's, 30's, and 40's spiced with a modern touch. With a risk this big, the consequences could be ghastly but if pulled off successfully, the rewards can be mind-blowing. Amazingly, she executes it convincingly, providing fans with an introduction to older music without forcing it on them. The album is full of dance-heavy tracks, coupled with feel-good numbers, and tear-jerkers--Christina's forte--at the same time! Talk about well-balanced.<br /><br />The first disc opens with an intro which basically informs that the CD will go back in time in terms of sound and vibe. Cool intro infused with smart samples. Disc one amply continues with \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray,\\" an up-tempo track almost like the upbeat songs sung by talented African-American choirs in churches. You're gonna be praising by the end of the song, which paves the way to \\"Back in the Day,\\" which is one of my favorites, with its addicting chorus and melodic stanzas. \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" comes next, which continues the up-tempo feel of the album and then goes to \\"Understand,\\" a slower ballad with \\"hit single\\" written all over it. Its chorus, featuring a sample vocal, will leave the track stuck on your head, in a good way. \\"Slow Down Baby\\" begins, giving a harder edge to the CD which, if released as a single, will surely be a hit, and goes to \\"Oh Mother,\\" a deep ballad about Shelly, Christina's mother. Pepare the tissues because this is a potential tear-jerker. \\"F.U.S.S.\\" starts, which is a short interlude regarding former collaborator Scott Storch, ending with \\"Guess I didn't need you, still got the album out.\\" and may leave some shocked. This is followed by \\"On Our Way,\\" another personal favorite. It's so excellent a track that you will picture yourself sitting alone at night and feeling the song through and through. Next will be \\"Without You,\\" a feel-good track that is very soothing yet simple, followed by the racy lyrics of \\"Still Dirrty,\\" showing off her sexual side perfectly and going against the people who say that she has left her sexiness behind. Great song and potential hit if released commercially. \\"Here to Stay,\\" ensues with its high-energy anthem of self-empowerment, followed by \\"Thank You,\\" disc one's closer featuring clips from fans collected through phone-calls stuck together with Christina's message of gratefulness to her supporters. I thought this would be a cheesy song but the way DJ Premier did the track left me speechless. Amazing.<br /><br />Disc two, the more soulful of the twin CDs, starts with an intro again called \\"Enter the Circus,\\" which is OK besides the fact that Christina's vocals are not there. \\"Welcome\\" then is played, which will leave you feeling nostalgic with its epic sound. Too bad its a short track. \\"Candyman\\" then begins with its up-tempo beat that is so addicting, making you almost see Christina and her dancers dancing in sailor suits, and then slows down with \\"Nasty Naughty Boy,\\" with its sexual and racy lyrics coupled by a live jazz band. Its so burlesque and the words are so clever, you'll be left amazed--\\"I'll give you my Ooh La La, voulez vous coucher avec moi...\\" \\"I Got Trouble\\" then is next, featuring a muffled sound reminiscent of old vinyl records and is one of the more authentic sounding songs along with \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" and \\"Candyman\\", and then is followed by \\"Hurt,\\" a big ballad that Christina does perfectly. For me, this is one of the best ballads in the record and deserves to be released as a single. What follows is \\"Mercy On Me\\" with its heavy melody very reminicent of the beautiful \\"Walk Away\\" from Stripped. This track is mainly a conversation with God and is generally a confession in a song. Then, what follows is \\"Save Me From Myself,\\" the jewel of disc two. The track is stripped down to just guitar, strings, and vocals, sans the riffs, featuring an intimate Christina singing about her husband. Beautifully done and definitely encaptulates the record's back to basic charm. The CD is closed with \\"The Right Man,\\" which talks about her wedding day with its slow, soulful sound. Lyrically, its moving and serves as Christina's way of making peace with her father and moving on to accept for the first time, a male protecter in her life. What touched me was the last part where she says that one day, her daughter will say that she found the right man, unlike Fausto Aguilera, Christina's father who tormented Christina's and Shelly's life years ago. It's a beautiful ender, for me, with profound lyrics stringed together with an almost church-like aura.<br /><br />Overall, the CD is very diverse and balanced, not focusing too much on drama, ballads, or dance-heavy tracks, but rather, incorporates all of them consistently. It shows Christina's versatility and the reaches of her talent, which I think ranges to eternity, showing why Christina's still here after 7 years of singing. The album, too, is very likable, which is the winning power of the double record. It doesn't only make you appreciate the music but also honestly like it.<br /><br />BRAVO CHRISTINA. DON'T EVER STOP MAKING MUSIC AND INSPIRING PEOPLE BECAUSE YOU MOST DEFINITELY ROCK AT IT.and \\"Candyman\\", and then is followed by \\"Hurt,\\" a big ballad that Christina does perfectly.

B00005JOYM|4.0|****<br /><br />Oliver Stone's \\"World Trade Center\\" is a well-made but difficult to watch theatrical experience. Much like Paul Greengrass' \\"United 93\\", both films are very similar in many regards with Stone taking a different approach in one major aspect of the filmmaking process.<br /><br />Stone goes the Big Budget Studio Route, recreating huge portions of the World Trade Center and parts of the destruction, shooting on the streets of New York, with a large cast of well-known actors. He attempts to recreate the real life dramatic story about the survival of two men, in the middle of a much larger event. It works, but a lot of the film's success could be derived from our knowledge of the event and the extent of our feelings still associated with the horror of that day.<br /><br />Stone concentrates the story, focusing our attention on a small group of Port Authority Policemen, led by Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicholas Cage) and including the team's rookie, Will Jimeno (Michael Pena, \\"Crash\\"). As these men, and their co-workers, start their day, they have no idea what horrors the day will bring. But as soon as the World Trade Center is hit, they move into action. McLoughlin was instrumental in coming up with a plan after the '93 attack on the World Trade Center, so he is naturally the choice to lead an evacuation team. He asks for volunteers and these men, including Jimeno, set out to Tower 1. As they make their way, they learn of some problems at Tower 2, but go about their mission because all information is sketchy at this point. After they have gathered equipment, they head to Tower 1 and suddenly watch as the courtyard, where people are being treated, is covered with flaming debris. Then the two towers collapse, burying McLoughlin's team under twenty feet of rubble. Later, McLoughlin wakes up and finds that Jimeno is still alive. They both realized they are buried under rubble but hold hope they will be found.<br /><br />Stone and his team of technicians have done an amazing job of recreating the World Trade Center and the collapse, focusing on McLoughlin and his team, we experience this horrific event through their eyes. This is a believable, and not necessarily good thing. It makes the film very painful to watch. The majority of the film focuses on Cage and Pena buried under twenty feet of rubble, trying to keep each other alive, hoping for rescue. These scenes are interesting and powerful, but Stone cuts away from them to scenes involving their two wives, living through the horror. We see McLoughlin's wife, Donna (Maria Bello), dealing with the inaccurate information, the horror of the situation, the lack of knowledge as she has to try to calm their four kids. There are also scenes of Jimeno's pregnant wife (Maggie Gyllenhaal) dealing with the same things. What these cutaways do is remind us we are watching a film, a recreation of a horrible event. Every time we are reminded of this, we have to wonder why this film was made.<br /><br />Is it necessary to see a dramatic recreation of such a horrible event? If the film were made to offer some education or to posit an argument, I might say yes, but as a piece of entertainment, it seems a little early. In Woody Allen's \\"Crimes and Misdemeanors\\", Alan Alda's character, an obnoxious television producer, explains his theory about what makes something funny. The gist of his theory is that you can't make a joke about something that just happened, there is still too much pain involved. If you wait a while, you have more latitude. The character's a jerk, but what he says has a grain of truth. Stone abandons his usual conspiracy theories in favor of a very straight forward narrative, a recreation of the story of two men. Yes, the story is amazing, but is it necessary to see a film about it at this point in time?<br /><br />In \\"United 93\\", the film spent time showing us how the events may have transpired, providing a documentary-like look at the event. \\"WTC\\" is smaller in scope, but larger in scale, showing us the plight of two men when almost 3,000 died.<br /><br />As we return to Cage and Pena, we are constantly reminded that Nicholas Cage is playing this character, Maria Bello that character, Maggie Gyllenhaal that one. These are very recognizable actors and their presence, even when they are good, serves to remind us that we are watching a film. The performances are all good, and the film is very moving. But because we recognize these actors, especially Nicholas Cage, we are constantly reminded we are watching a `film'.<br /><br />I think it is too early for \\"WTC\\". Releasing the film just shy of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 seems like a marketing ploy. If the film were made in another five or ten years, I think it would be easier to accept the recreated nature of the film and it would serve as a good reminder of a horrific event.<br /><br />\\"United 93\\" is a more successful film for a variety of reasons. The film contains no name actors and is shot in a way that makes it appear to be almost a documentary. In \\"WTC\\", as McLoughlin and Jimeno are pulled out of the rubble, we see a line of emergency personnel standing at the edge of the iconic view of the rubble, carrying them to safety. How much time and money was spent recreating that location? There are huge sets, expensive production values. All of this combines to make the film seem phony.<br /><br />Also, \\"World Trade Center\\" is strangely apolitical. This is probably a good thing for any film about any aspect of this horrific day, but you would probably expect Oliver Stone to throw a theory or two in, point some fingers, try to ascertain who is behind the conspiracy. Because this doesn't happen, we have to wonder why they would go to all of the trouble to recreate the World Trade Center and put these actors, and us, through a horrific event. Because he doesn't say anything except look at these survivors, see how dramatic their tale is. We already get a sense of how dramatic any survivor's tale is. We don't really need to live through it with them.<br /><br />All this said, watching \\"World Trade Center\\" is a powerful experience, but I suspect a lot of this comes from the subject matter and the horror associated with the events of the day. As I watched Nicholas Cage reunite with Maria Bello at the hospital, I teared up. It is a powerful moment because I know a similar event actually happened to the two people they are playing. Because the film is based on the events of two real survivors, the film has a power it probably wouldn't have otherwise.e, but larger in scale, showing us the plight of two men when almost 3,000 died. <br /> <br />As we return to Cage and Pena, we are constantly reminded that Nicholas Cage is playing this character, Maria Bello that character, Maggie Gyllenhaal that one. These are very recognizable actors and their presence, even when they are good, serves to remind us that we are watching a film. The performances are all good, and the film is very moving. But because we recognize these actors, especially Nicholas Cage, we are constantly reminded we are watching a `film'.  <br /> <br />I think it is too early for \\"WTC\\". Releasing the film just shy of the fifth anniversary of 9/11 seems like a marketing ploy. If the film were made in another five or ten years, I think it would be easier to accept the recreated nature of the film and it would serve as a good reminder of a horrific event. <br /> <br />\\"United 93\\" is a more successful film for a variety of reasons. The film contains no name actors and is shot in a way that makes it appear to be almost a documentary. In \\"WTC\\", as McLoughlin and Jimeno are pulled out of the rubble, we see a line of emergency personnel standing at the edge of the iconic view of the rubble, carrying them to safety. How much time and money was spent recreating that location? There are huge sets, expensive production values. All of this combines to make the film seem phony. <br /> <br />Also, \\"World Trade Center\\" is strangely apolitical. This is probably a good thing for any film about any aspect of this horrific day, but you would probably expect Oliver Stone to throw a theory or two in, point some fingers, try to ascertain who is behind the conspiracy. Because this doesn't happen, we have to wonder why they would go to all of the trouble to recreate the World Trade Center and put these actors, and us, through a horrific event. Because he doesn't say anything except look at these survivors, see how dramatic their tale is. We already get a sense of how dramatic any survivor's tale is. We don't really need to live through it with them. <br /> <br />All this said, watching \\"World Trade Center\\" is a powerful experience, but I suspect a lot of this comes from the subject matter and the horror associated with the events of the day. As I watched Nicholas Cage reunite with Maria Bello at the hospital, I teared up. It is a powerful moment because I know a similar event actually happened to the two people they are playing. Because the film is based on the events of two real survivors, the film has a power it probably wouldn't have otherwise. <br />
B000641Z90|4.0|When I ordered this DVD I mistakenly told my wife I had done so.  I placed the order on Saturday and she was on my case by Monday.  Thanks to Amazon's shipping policy it was in her hands by Tuesday afternoon (Thank you oh Thank you Amazon). <br />   This is a unique collection of Phil.  The songs are the same as most concerts, however, the stage and players are different.  I miss Phil Banks and Mike Rutherford.  In many ways this is the Caroussel Concert updated. <br />   Unique with this DVD is the ability to view it from different angles.  My original player did not offer this option, however, after purchasing an upgrade I can now switch the angle/view of the show.  There are six to seven songs in which you can change your viewpoint during the show.  It is worth utilizing. <br />    Aside from the updated songs this is nothing more than the <br />Caroussel album reproduced in better quality and effects.  That said, it, the DVD, is a tremendous copulation of Phil's best works.  Truly is worth the money and a keepsake.  Let us hope his Second Farewell Concert includes more/any of his original works.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|Dark, hard-hitting - the Batman I have grown to love in the comic book.  Still an interpretation of the Batman myth, but a believable and engrossing interpretation.  The supporting cast are phenomenal, highly recommended.
B000005JA8|5.0|The stories behind the creation of the record are fabulously interesting and mostly divulged in the wonderful boxed set Grow Fins. The band lived together, rehearsed DAILY - they could jam this record pretty much front to back - imagine what the Stones could have done under that kind of work ethic!<br />The lyrics are the usual mystical, hilarious, bizarro Beefheart material, and some of it is acapella. Some cuts are just interesting and funny quips. But there's some amazing rock gems on this set. Frownland and Moonlight over Vermont are anthemic - and crazed.<br />\\"crazed\\" is kind of a way of thinking of this record, maybe also \\"obcessed\\"  - and also \\"courageous\\".<br /><br />It's more inspired Jazz than rock in some places... but for me the moment I \\"got\\" this record came when I actually saw some of the old footage of the band performing parts of the next record Lick My Decals Off, Baby (currently an unavailable CD!). You can catch some of it on [...] or in the Grow Fins boxed set (which I can't recommend highly enough).<br /><br />To see the band creating this music style was an epiphany of a sort. It's NOT freestyle jazz after all (except for the horn) - it truely is a product of long hours of outrageous dedicated effort from excellent musicians.<br /><br />It won't be loved immediately by those who's tastes have never strayed from the conventional popular music form. But give it time.<br />One of the outstanding things about this music is that there's no doubt it pleased the musicians immensely to break with their traditions and impress themselves with what was possible, despite the gnawing understanding that commerical success was most likely impossible. Critical Success is ALMOST THE ONLY success Beefheart has ever had. A great many bands list Beefheart as a major influence.<br /><br />Don't miss this gem - take your time with it - you will suddenly \\"get it\\".
B0000019PA|5.0|How does one describe an album that lives on a metaphorical island but affects every human emotion. ITAOTS creator Jeff Mangum has made a world filled with magical imagery, swirling thoughts and our (humans) never ending battle to find a balance between the will to live and the sobering acceptance of death. I rarely play this album beacuse of its emotional punch. This is not easy listening. This work of art may be life changing or just mood changing. It, like anything in life depends on you. When I hear the distinctive strumming of \\"King of Carrot Flowers, Part 1\\" I know it's too late to turn back. I close my eyes and \\"experience\\" the album. Depending on my mood, I may be moved to tears of joy or tears of sadness (or both). By the time \\"Two Headed Boy Part two\\" concludes with Mangum dropping his guitar I feel literally knocked out (that's not a bad thing!). The album is best described by a line from the song \\"In The Aeroplane Over The Sea\\": \\"...how strange to be anything at all...\\"
B000FVQYYK|5.0|i have to admit i've never been a big fanatic of muse i like some of their old singles but never ventured into buying any of their albums until now that is. when i first heard \\"supeermassive black holes\\" i was hooked by the style of the singing and the electro hardened beat and the pure class of the lyrics.  <br />so i've finally got the album today and i wasn't disappointed  <br />i read some of the neagtive reviews on here and uk amazon site  <br />and i wasn't put off from not buying it. as i had a feel i knew i would like the album.  <br />yeah it may sound abit \\"clean\\" as you say. but the quality  <br />of the band as an unit is mesmerising.  <br />this review isn't a biased review as i said i'm not a fan of muse.  <br />but their new sound a great departure from \\"absolution\\"  <br />didn't put me off as stated by some die hard fans which i throughly agree with bc if i was a die hard fan i would of been taken aback by the dramatic sound of \\"black holes and revelations\\"  <br /> <br />out of the eleven tracks here i love ten.  <br />the only track that i haven't warmed to yet is \\"hoodoo\\"  <br />but as some people comment the tracks that you don't like instantly are the ones that capture you the most as i must concur that has happen to me before so i'll give it another try and get into the dynamics of the song.  <br /> <br />but as a concept that muse has plunged itself head first in the deep end it's a success. that needs to listened too again.  <br />
B00005MP58|5.0|I checked this series out at my local library because I was taking an American Literature class. I compared this adaption with the actual novel and to my surprise this is the BEST adaptation I have seen of a classic in the entire time that I have been studying American and British literature. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone who loves this particular genre.
B000G759LW|5.0|This album is absolutely incredible!!! I took a long drive and embraced this CD to the fullest! It's got everything and personally,it's my favorite album by Christina yet. Its funky, soulful, emotional, you name it. She pays homage to people who influenced her on \\"back to basics\\". She sings her heart out and brought tears to my eyes with \\"Oh Mother\\", which she dedicates to her mom. F.U.S.S. is one of my favorites because she is basically telling someone that her only goal is to always end up on top...with or without their help. This is a mature album and to me, unlike her previous, more \\"pop\\" sounding albums. She is in love and happy and you can totally tell with songs like \\"understand\\" and \\"the right man\\".  Her song \\"thank you\\" is an incredible song saying how grateful she is to her fans.  How often does and artist take the time to make a song for their fans?  This is an album to be loves from Track #1, to Track #23.  Her second CD is much more of an older sound, but worth listening too and appreciating.  Bottom line is no one can do it like Christina...No one can sing like her.  She is an original and this album proves it! You WILL NOT  be disappointed!
0140544518|5.0|This story is not only a wonderful variation of the three little pigs story but it is a great resource for any classroom.  I have read this story many times in our storytime hour at the local library and the little ones LOVE IT!  My high school students also enjoy it when I use it to explain point of view in my English classes.  I would recommend this funny picture book to anyone!
B00097DX3U|4.0|The self-titled Audioslave albums is in my opinion one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. With that said, how does their sophmore release stack up to the original? Very well in my book.  However, it is a different sounding Audioslave than you may have come to expect. The band itself delivers very well on this album as you may have to come to expect with this guys. Tom, Brad and Tim sound amazing as usual. Yet it is somewhat of a departure from anything that they have done before. The first album was more of a in your face hard rock, heavy and loaded with fast paced rifts, more akin to Rage style playing. This album does not  abandon their sound, but it is a little different. Different in a good way. IE, you will still get the trademark Morello solo in pretty much every song, and if your a Morello fan, he sounds as good as ever.<br /><br />The first time I heard Be Yourself on the radio, I literally said to myself, wth?  It took a few listens to really start digging the song, and to this day it's still a fantastic song. Its basically the \\"Like a stone\\" for Out of Exile.  The most noticable difference is Chris's voice, as he mixes it up and does more varied singing instead of yelling.  Some of the songs have a bluesy sound to them, especially Doesn't Remind Me.<br /><br />All in all, its a very strong and varied album, with something to like for everyone. My favorites are Be Yourself, Drown Me Slowly, The Worm, and Man or Animal. Speaking of Man or Animal and The Worm, this album is worth owning for those 2 songs alone IMO. If your a fan of the first album or a fan of soundgarden, you'll dig this.  Alot.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Bringing Up Baby might be the best screwball comedy ever, and is certainly one of the best. Cary Grant plays a staid, bespectacled professor of paleontology, engaged to a prim maiden who doesn't want to take time off from work to have a honeymoon. His life takes a sudden turn when he encounters a liberated society girl, played by Katherine Hepburn, at the golf course, where he is trying to impress the lawyer of a potential donor to his museum. She begins by playing his ball, and soon is driving away with his car, with the professor on the running board. Several adventures later, he and Hepburn are driving a tame leopard named Baby to her aunt's Connecticut estate, in a stolen car. Things don't really get crazy, however, until Baby escapes. Oh, yes - Baby loves dogs. Hepburn was never cast in a romantic farce before or since, but she is marvelous at it. The gags are so non-stop it's almost like a Marx Brothers movie. It's energy and wit carry it along to its breathless conclusion.
B000G759LW|5.0|This is one of the best christina aguilera albums I've ever listen to, this album takes us back to the gloriest times like the 30's and the 40's, real music not this fake music that people have to put with today, I Loved ain't no other man and many others, this is a great album with a strong performance by christina aguilera and a great performance by Nas, this is a terrific album and one of the best albums of this year so far. <br /> <br />Big Thumbs Up for Me.
B000GCFO0I|3.0|For the first hour or so, Silent Hill is an amazing thing. It carries, and quite well, the feel of an arthouse horror flick - there's a ton of mystery, lots of isolation, plenty of atmosphere, and enough truly creepy stuff going on that I was wriggling in my seat with joy (when I wasn't wriggling in discomfort). <br /> <br />During this half of the film there's not much else to do except soak in the wonderful atmosphere and go with the flow as Rose traverses from empty town to hellish nightmare Otherworld, infested with a variety of nasties - including Pyramid Head (who is violence personified on two legs) and The Janitor (yeek. Just...yeek.). <br /> <br />This is horror - dangerous, effective, mysterious horror. Bravo. <br /> <br />Mixed in with these scenes is the search of devoted but irritable husband Sean Bean for Rose and Sharon. Bean has a small role here, but plays it very well and the timing of his episodes is very canny - after some of the unbelievable setpieces we're shown, it's almost a relief to deal with a little normalcy as counterpoint. The most evocative scene in the film occurs between Bean and Mitchell during one of these transitions, and they're not even in the same shot. It's played beautifully. <br /> <br />...and then there's the second half. The proceedings begin their inevitable slide around the hour mark, when the film has to start explaining some things. This in and of itself isn't a problem except that the plot Gans and Avary brought in to replace the game's is a real clunker, coming off like the bastard lovechild of Carrie and Hellraiser. Rose meets the town's few human survivors, and much of the mystery is resolved through awkward dialogue that's more likely to provoke laughter than chills (as compared to the first half's sparse writing, which comes across as pretty natural). <br /> <br />Eventually Rose must venture back into the darkness, but this time it just doesn't hold the terror of the first half of the film. We've been there anddone that, and even Radha Mitchell acts these scenes out more as if she's puzzling through a videogame sequence than actually fighting for her life. Her reward, and ours? Lots of plot exposition. It's moderately interesting stuff, but it kills what momentum the film had going, with another 20-30 minutes of run time left to go. <br /> <br />Having taken his foot off the gas pedal and with his top-heavy narrative sputtering on fumes, Gans chooses to end the film with cliches and excess - which kind of killed the buzz for me. Horror fans will enjoy the buckets of Karo Syrup and Red Dye #5. Fans of irony will probably find the whole blood-soaked affair hilarious. Everyone else will likely want to fast-forward. <br /> <br />The film's final shot is a nice piece of mystery, but it's at right angles to the 45 minutes that came before it. I can't help but wonder how much better the film would've been if Gans had maybe ended it a bit sooner.
B000BYA5GO|2.0|When I saw the trailer I thought I would enjoy this movie, especially being a big fan of Mr.Cage.  I thought my wife would not like it at all.  Well I was wrong on both counts.  My wife liked it, I didn't really care for it.  Having said that I probably would have given it 3 stars had it not been preachy, even as it was subtle with it's sermon. I was not expecting a social commentary film on the evil that gun merchants do.  I actually expected somewhat of an action movie.  I think most people realize what arms dealers do for a living and the often horrifying consequences of that.  I really don't need a 2 hour movie to educate me on that fact. The characters I thought were pretty weak as well. Picture Woody Allen as an international arms dealer doing business with ruthless war lords that would cut your heart out in a second.  That's obviously an exaggeration, I mean it is Nicholas Cage, but you get the idea.  I'll leave it at that because I don't want to give anything away.  If your looking for something along the line of The Rock, this isn't it.  If you want to see a movie about how disgusting and evil arms dealers are (their not really bad guys they just do really bad things), and how terrible the US Government is for associating with them then you'll really like this movie.
B000BRBA8S|5.0|like \\"in the mood for love\\", this movie was very beautifully done.  the cinematography, the acting, the scenery, the script, etc... were well done.  bravo kar wai wong for this masterpiece.

These are my 10 month old sons favorite, every night before going to bed he points at these on the shelf and I must read them (sometimes even several times).  What a wonderful way to introduce reading to a little one. <br />

Red lights mean doors are secured in england is a sighn in a taxi which states that you cant open the door while its moving i.e. But the artic monkeys are ace, iv seen them 4 times and they rock more than anyother band. Interpool, Daft punk, Outcast. These guys are too cool but people like alex and co who might aswell be my cousin(seriouse) i can dig. The thing with the artic monkeys is that they do rock but they are very very deep aswell. Like the lyrics'' Last night what we talked about it made so much sense, but know the haze as assended it dont make no sent anymore. etc.Thats on about doing ecstacy and talking rubbish. Then the next mornin you thing what was i on, O yeah etc.
B00000DGUY|5.0|Excellent CD.All of the best songs that Dire Straits have done are in one package.
B000G759LW|3.0|I would say this is just ok. There really isnt any strong ballads here except for the cut \\"Hurt\\". Overall the cd to me is ok. The cd actually could all fit on one disc, so im not sure why they decided to split it up. Im glad I could listen before i bought. I do like her alot, maybe after a few more videos are released it may grow on me a little more. But first impression is just ok. Some songs relate to her and i dont like when artists start doing that. Songs should be very general and should apply to anyone.
B000FS9FCG|5.0|This movie is amazing. i absolutely loved it. this movie will instill ideas and questions in you about yourself and about your government. i think everyone should be made to watch this movie.<br /><br />this movie is about a corrupt government in the future. it is a government ruled by fear and oppression and the excessive need for conrtol and power on the government's power, under total control of the Chancellor Sutler. he's done everything possible to kill free thoughts and different people. everything from The Koran to same sex marriage has been banned and the mews networks are controlled by the government and they report false or biased opinions (not too unlike that of Fox News Network).<br /><br />Theres a man named V who is a freethinker and the starter of this idea that is to change this government. he challenges all the ideas the government stands for. he meets Evey (natalie portman) by chance on the street, and they form a bond over the fact that the government is looking for her. he kills the people making the government corrupt and leaves the new ideas to different peoplem, who obviously want a change.<br /><br />the ending is very good and i couldn't have asked for one better. there are ideas expressed in the movie... maybe subliminally, maybe not so hidden...about whats to come of the world as a result of this war America is in or have started. its a very very good movie that poses plenty of questions for you to ponder. it sux that i had to wait to come to DVD because my local movie theater wouldn't get it. and thats exactly the reasoning that gets us to the government in this movie.  go rent this.
B000G759LW|5.0|At first, I was skeptical when I heard Christina was going to record a 'nitty-gritty soul' record as she said once in an interview some few months before 'Back To Basics' was released. 'This was going to be boring' or so I thought. Back To Basics is a pleasant surprise. There's nothing really basic about this album - it's a wild ride fueled with artistry, gusto and creativity. The album is split into 2: disc 1 being the sample-influenced hip/hop club ditties and disc 2, filled with collaborations exclusively with Linda Perry who brings a more risque and orchestra heavy sound for Christina. <br /> <br />It is difficult to really pick highlights from both discs but I think that Back To Basics is filled with more sleeper hits that grow on you than the instant hits of Stripped. Back To Basics gets better after every listen. Christina's voice is strong and confident where it needs to, and is subtle and vulnerable where songs call them to be. From Disc 1: highlights include: the gospel opener 'Makes Me Wanna Pray' - a bouncy and dynamic start to the album, nostalgia-bitten 'Back In The Day' wherein DJ Premier effectively samples 'Charley' as Christina pays homage to Aretha, Etta James and Marvin Gaye, soul stunner 'Understand', lush ballad 'Without You' and the tongue in cheek 'Still Dirrty' - a sophisticated horn heavy club banger. It is in Disc 2 where the real fun starts: 'Welcome' has got to be my favorite in the whole album. It's rumbling start, string driven bass line and satirical lyrics about the music business - hard to believe this song came from the same girl that gave us 'Genie In A Bottle'. 'Candyman' is another highlight, a risky venture that pays off and makes you want to hit the floor. 'Save Me From Myself' borrows from Norah Jones. This is one of Christina's best vocal performances ever - I can't describe it, you'll have to hear it for yourself - it's a whole new side of Christina. <br /> <br />The album could actually fit in one disc, but the decision tosplit it into 2 discs is an artistic and creative move to showcase the versatility, how this album has ambitiously placed itself as one of the most memorable and interesting projects in the pop canon. Christina - the 4 years was worth the wait. I strongly recommend you give this one a chance - you might find a gem of your own.
0060254920|5.0|Excellent. This book is specially for boys under six years old.
0061020680|5.0|What better topic for one of the greatest living satire writers to spoof than death.  Pratchett chose the best possible story line for death to quite literally take a holiday.  Even outside of the Discworld series, this is a great book.      Death needs an apprentice.  At the apprentice fair, Death picks the hapless Mort.  Seeming to think that he is tiring of his job, Death takes a holiday which leaves Mort in charge.  Inexperienced as Death, Mort has a problematic first day on the job which threatens to alter the course of history when Mort interferes in a death.  As Mort struggles to heal reality and the course of history, a resurrected wizard attempts to restore time to coherence and the real Death to viability.  While time may heal, Death is never pleased when you foul up his work.  Death has unexpected consequences waiting.    This particular Pratchett novel displays the coherence that many of his other books lack.  With fewer characters, the story is easier to grasp.  To top it off, this book is downright funny.  If I had to recommend only one Pratchett book to a first time reader, this may be the one.
B000G759LW|3.0|It's not really soul music at all to be honest. It's pop music with an R&B twist here and there, as well as a handful of clever hip-hop samples from time to time and some ballads. There are also some songs about rough times. But that's no surprise - We've come to expect just a little depth from this 26 year old fireball. But whatever Christina is doing, she's usually speaking her mind and never holding back, which I, as others, highly admire.<br /><br />She delves sort of deep and gives you her all. I appreciate that she is contemporary pop's best voice and probably will remain for a while. All the luck to her really.<br /><br />The lyrics to this CD are pretty good, especially for pop music but she still has room for a little growth. She can also do without so many songs about her lovely hubby, Jordan. We got the point before this experience was over.<br /><br />It has its moments where it really shines, but honestly, nobody but hardcore fans should have to pay the [...] bucks amazon and other stores are selling it for. Just because it's a double disc doesn't mean you're getting extra stuff, besides a lousy video or so. I have seen amazon in the past, selling it for 11.99 which I thought was fitting, but now it has skyrocketed back to its over-bloated price. >_><br /><br />This CD is pretty much on par with her first self-titled debut, but that was catchier.

0380807343|3.0|Someone else on this site said they thought the book might have worked better as a one-shot graphic novel; I agree.  I quite enjoyed it, but I had two main gripes: (1) the story's been done before (2) it just didn't seem as vivid as it should have been, hence my comment about graphic novels.  I was reading it in a hurry, so I could have been not taking things in properly, but I still felt like this should be creeping me out a little more than it did.  I also agree with other people that the pacing's a bit off. <br /> <br />I think it might be too scary for young kids, but too child-like for older kids; but if you have (or are) a kid who reads everything, I recommend you borrow this from your library and see what you think.  I didn't feel I'd wasted the time I spent reading this, but I wouldn't buy it.
0066620996|3.0|With \\"Good to Great\\" Collins et al have made famous the analogy that compares the workplace organization to a bus loaded with passengers. In his hearty application of that analogy Collins states that moving a given organization (the bus) from the level of mediocrity or even competence to that of a stellar performer may require getting the right people on the bus, in the right seats, and maybe even getting a few off the bus entirely.<br /><br />Question: which individual on the organizational \\"bus\\" poses the greatest risk to everyone else on the bus (and to the bus itself)? Absolutely right: the Driver. And probably the person sitting right behind the driver. If either of them is a nutcase, well......<br /><br />G2G explores, with depth and lucidity, how good organizations can be turned into ones that produce great, sustained results. Yet while Collins' discussion (one chapter) of Level-5 Leadership is laudatory, the book's focus is on the organization: the goals and visions and profits of a company, not the growth and progress of the people within it nor of how one becomes a Level 5 leader.<br /><br />That one glaring weakness--- a paucity of dialogue on relational or human leadership--- renders G2G, in my mind, \\"just another management book\\" with some unusual content.<br /><br />Coke Newell, MSPR, consultant and author of \\"Journey to Edaphica\\"
B00008O31H|5.0|This appears to be a new direction for the Blues. Any young fans seeing this duo live may not really comprehend that their sound is vintage. These young guys must've listened hard to their parents Blues records and they've put together a funky combo that reminds me of everybody from Fred McDowell to Canned Heat. Obviously the Jr. Kimbrough/RL Burnside influence is strong on all of their CD's. Their sound is a fitting tribute to all the Blues legends. Simple but effective riffs to their songs.Some of the songs also will remind you of Hendrix, JL Hooker or Blind Willie Johnson. \\"Set You Free\\" recalls the raw punkiness  of 60's bands like the Sir Douglas Quintet or The Kingsmens \\"Louie, Louie\\". The title track has that dirty, swamp feel of some of CCR's hits. Whatever their influences they've made the sound their own and they are a fiiting addition to the inspirational Fat Possum label.   It's all wonderfully raw!! I think this is the way Blues should be played.. stripped down with no over production.   The lead singer, Dan Auerbach, sounds at times like a distorted Bob Hite, other times like Lowell George...his voice is stunning, reminiscent of Mississipi Hill musicians and belies his young age.   Every one of their CD's is worth purchasing as there are great tracks on all of them. For just the two of them they make a BIG sound.   A great example of what can happen when youngsters go \\"backwards' to vintage blues in order to go forward with a re-packaged sound for the 21st century.
0375703764|5.0|This book lives up to the hype here on amazon and elsewhere in the literary world. A chilling horror story that is open to many interpretations. Few answers, and many questions, a fun journey into scary territory.
006441034X|5.0|Before I read this book I watched the movie with I fell in love with it. When i found out that it was a book I got really excited and had to go to the bookstore right then. Of course the book was a thousand times better than the movie. It's full of action, magic, and a little romance. Perfect for those Harry Potter fans looking for a good read.
B00005JOQS|1.0|Don't waste your time with this movie. If you've seen Superman:The Movie with Christopher Reeve... you've seen this film. No, let me rephrase that... Superman: The Movie had a far better cast & a better director than this boring, rehashed monstrosity. Brandon Routh comes off as a bad Christopher Reeve impersonation, NOT Superman. Kate Bosworth is just scenery as Lois Lane. No personality there. Keven Spacey is wasted by being pigeonholed into a Gene Hackman-styled Luthor. The basic plot of this film is EXACTLY the same as that of Superman: The Movie. Lex Luthor has come up with a crazy real estate scheme, which will involve massive destruction & loss of life, so Superman has to stop him. Many scenes are direct lifts from the Reeve films, albeit with CGI special effects. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money on this. In my opinion, it's not even worth renting as a $1.00 rental.
B000001FS6|2.0|I saw this movie in the theater when it came out and did like it more than I thought I would based on the reviews and having expected a really terrible set of tunes.  I even bought it on Laserdisc after getting it on tape and the soundtrack on CD because there are a couple gems on there.<br /><br />But also having the soundtrack and hearing the various tunes come up in random play on my iPod against U2s whole catalog among other assorted artists from all genres, it is really apparent how bad most of the songs are and especially the cover tunes (Helter Skelter, All Along the Watchtower), Bono's embarrasing imbecilic banter nothwithstanding.<br /><br />The band is best in the studio and especially under the direction of Eno and Lanois (the guys really responsible for improving their sound) as they are not very good live musicians and that juxtaposed with their self important preachiness has not worn well through the years.<br /><br />The best tracks are the \\"Van Dieman's Land\\" and \\"All I Want is You\\" along with the BB King \\"When Love Comes to Town\\" duet.  But for the Joshua Tree era essence of this band that the movie/soundtrack is supposed to capture, your best bet is the Joshua Tree studio album and its predecessor, The Unforgettable Fire.

One can only hope and pray....
B0002B15WE|5.0|I've seen this movie bunches of times since it came out in 1988, and what's enjoyable for me is not the action, which is well done, but the character interaction.  Bruce Willis, as John McClane, is a pretty good representative for the everyman.  He isn't tall, he isn't classically good-looking (although he is bulked up for this role), and he doesn't have money, style or a classical education backing him up.  But he is observant, clever, funny, loyal, and brave.  The fantasy here is two-fold: that an everyguy can go up against a brilliant, organized, elite, arrogant force and win and, while he's doing it, he can show his superiors up as complete idiots and get the job done when they can't.<br /><br />The \\"terrorist\\" villains are almost likeable too.  Alan Rickman endows his Hans Gruber with a glossy condescension that is fun to watch.  He makes an exceptional foil for McClane: their weaknesses and strengths complement ech other's.  And Clarence Gilyard as the hacker Theo has a real energy about him.  The fly in the ointment is, of course, the violence.  At the time this movie was made, many Americans thought America was selling itself to Japan, so a big heist from a Japanese company seems almost like an acceptable payback for services to cheaply rendered.  But no viewer is going to forgive two dead hostages, so the ending with its high \\"terrorist\\" body count still feels satisfying.<br /><br />Also satisfying is watching those supposedly in charge refuse to listen and thus fail spectacularly.  A big part of this film's appeal is that the idiots in charge get shown up time and time again for the arrogant, unthinking, protocol followers they are while John McClane gets results because he pays attention, cuts through the BS, and just does what needs to be done.  Almost everyone has had a boss like Deputy Police Chief Dwayne T. Robinson, but hardly anyone gets the opportunity to call him an idiot and bypass his authority.<br /><br />Props must be given to the filmmakers for including black actors in key positions on all fronts and including them as savvy, and, for the most part, sympathetic characters.makers for including black actors in key positions on all fronts and including them as savvy, and, for the most part, sympathetic characters.

B000003TSP|3.0|It was like listening to the very few parts of Dummy I didn't like for an entire CD. Way too much gratuitous scratching, and screechy vocals for may taste. Extremely disappointing.    It's now perhaps six months after I wrote the paragraph above and I am completely addicted to this album. Cinematic trip goth at its very very best
B000002UJQ|1.0|boring, boring, boring <br />oh my, it's SUCH a nuisance how boring it is <br />I've honestly tried to listen to it, but couldn't get myself over the half of \\"Karmapolice\\" then stopped. <br /> <br />Sorry everyone. I must be a very boring guy and you all must have especially good musical taste. <br /> <br />BUT THIS \\"MUSIC\\" IS AS AWFULLY BORING AS THIS REVIEW.
B000G759LW|5.0|I've never been a big fan of Christina Aguilera. There have been songs that I've liked, but nothing that made me anticipate the next one, or even rush out and buy an album. <br /> <br />When I heard the first single 'Ain't No Other Man', I found myself in the same situation. Good song, but so what? <br /> <br />Then I heard a friend playing the album, and it stuck in my head, so I bought it and it's been on repeat ever since.  <br /> <br /> <br />Wow, THIS is GREAT music. And what I love is there's something for everyone. Whether you like R&B, Pop, old-school jazz and blues, or whatever, she delivers it here and delviers it good. <br /> <br />My stand-out tracks are: <br /> <br />-Back In The Day <br />-Mercy On Me <br />-Candyman <br />-The Right Man <br />-Still Dirrty <br />-Slow Down Baby <br />-Nasty Naughty Boy
B000FVQYYK|2.0|Black Holes and Revelations is definitely a bit of a change for Muse. With many big rock bands it seems they run out of ideas, or get lazy, and so their albums get samey (and who can really blame them? the fans are probably going to buy it anyway...)    Not so with Muse - while this album certainly has some of the 'trademarks' like big guitars, arpeggiated synths, soaring vocals, etc, we also see them experimenting, with flamenco (on 'Hoodoo'), falsetto new wave disco (or whatever you want to call it, on 'Supermassive Black Hole') and Queen-like choral singalongs (eg 'Knights Of Cydonia').    Unfortunately, despite these little excursions, Black Holes and Revelations ends up sounding pretty half-baked. For example opening track 'Take A Bow' isn't too bad, but musically it treads some pretty familiar ground (eg. 'Bliss' from Origin Of Symmetry) and lyrically its message is a bit obvious - sure, everyone's singing about it, but not many make it so blatant. 'Starlight' follows, it's got some nice sections but basically it's an overly cheesy love song with some pretty clunky lyrics.    It doesn't all go down that path though - 'Assassin' is a good ol' down-the-line rocker (I like humming 'Knight Rider' along to the intro); 'Invincible' is an interesting mix of march and love song, of course with some Indian overtones; and 'Soldier's Poem' is a cute little ballad with nice vocal harmonies (though worth mentioning that it does borrow a notable chunk from 'Ave Maria').    So all in all I guess it's just a feeling I get from this album that it could be a lot better. Some little tweaks here and there, a bit more care taken with it all, then we might have something... 2 and a half stars.
B000002PCS|5.0|but achingly beautiful for the love stricken/broken-hearted. I have always enjoyed this instant classical music since I first saw the movie at a very young age. Everytime I hear the theme it just gives me chills/goose bumps. Good for relaxing, studying, or working. Recommended for good listeners of good (amazing) music.

B00005RDRO|5.0|I have loved this movie from the very first moment I saw it for a number of reasons.  First  a very well-written spoof of murder mysteries with some top-notch jokes and some not so top-notch jokes.  But when you look at the whole you are very pleasantly surprised and you will enjoy this project over and over again.<br /><br />Moreover, seeing such stalwart entertainment figures in the 70s is a REAL treat:  Peter Falk, Maggie Smith, Elsa Lanchester, James Coco, James Crowell, Peter Sellers, Eileen Brennan, David Niven, Alec Guiness, Nancy Walker, and even Truman Capote and you are amazed at the caliber of the cast.<br /><br />It is a wonderful project, only to be matched by \\"The Cheap Detective\\" another Simon spoof.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this particular project and if you are in to classic comedies you will love this!!!
B000E8NQU4|4.0|I'll never give a Moody Blues album from the classic era less than four stars, and this week this one is my favorite. The music is a solid 5, with one less star for the remastering. A lot of people ask me about the difference between the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab masters and the SACD versions of the Moody Blues CDs. I have essentially every version so I have compared them extensively. (Yes, I'll even compare them for friends. Sometimes.) The first thing I noticed on this was the over-compression someone else commented on. Yes, the world has gone mad. The MFSL versions have spatial imaging that puts the SACD versions to shame. The pristine tonality makes the music come alive, especially if you've only heard the \\"remastered\\" CD versions (Remastered=Compressed in most cases - to make it play \\"louder\\"). I purchased the SACD versions for the extra tracks primarily. If you don't mind paying a premium price for used CDs I recommend the out of print Mobile Fidelity versions, but any Moody Blues CD is wonderful.
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen for the past months. Spike lee is a great director who has chosen a terrific cast to play that this genius story. I do not want to say more , this movie must be seen to be appreciated.
B00005JP5J|5.0|The Screen Actors Guild have an \\"Outstanding Performance by a Cast\\" award they give out annually, and this year LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE must be among the nominees (if not the recipient).<br /><br />Never before has a story been so well told and equally acted. Moving the audience to tears one moment and making us burst with laughter the next, this script was absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />And the story goes...<br /><br />Young Abigail Breslin (SIGNS, 2002) plays Olive, a six-year-old whom the entire cast orbits around. The first place contestant in a local New Mexico beauty pageant got eliminated and Olive, who'd came in second, is the default winner. She's going to California for the Little Miss Sunshine finals. But due to financial limitations, the family can't fly her, so all of them pack into a VW bus and head west. With Abigail comes her barely functioning dysfunctional family. Her father is played by the estimable Greg Kinnear (THE MATADOR, 2005). Richard (Kinnear) is the only one who can drive a stick, so he has to go. But with him comes his \\"are you a winner or loser\\" motivational comments that irk everyone around him. Also with them comes Olive's older brother Dwayne (Paul Dano, THE KING). The 15-year-old has taken a vow of silence until he's passed a test that allows him to fly jets for the Air Force; he writes his caustic comments on paper for all to read. Then we have Frank (Steve Carrell, THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN) who was recently released from the hospital after slitting his wrists and is on suicide watch by the family. A renowned Proust scholar, Frank found himself fired from his teaching job after falling in love with a student; one of his male students. Next we have Olive's grandfather played pitch perfect by Alan Arkin (THIRTEEN CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ONE THING, 2001). He's a smack-sniffing, perverted old man with a misplaced heart of gold. He's also Abigail's instructor for her dance sequence in the upcoming competition. And finally there's Sheryl (Toni Collette, IN HER SHOES), Olive's mother who is the glue that holds the family together.<br /><br />Road trip movies are practically a dime a dozen, but many miss the mark or become ludicrous. LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE has no such problems. Bouncing off -- or sometimes smashing against -- each family members' personality, Olive (Breslin) is the unifying good-natured persona that makes this entire flick so very watchable. Olive is a bit overweight, wears thick eye-glasses, and has little talent. But her family loves her without restraint and when they stuff themselves into the dilapidated VW, it is her unflagging perkiness and smiling that drives them onward toward California, even when confronting a failed father, a difficult brother, a faulty clutch, or death.<br /><br />The dance sequence at the end of the film is something of movie legend. If you think about who Olive's grandfather was, the dance she chose to do was outstandingly accurate (what other kind of dance could a drug-addled, porn-watching old man teach?) Needless to say I cringed and laughed at the choreographer's choice. It also made me ask \\"if\\" I should be laughing at this, as it was completely deranged and inappropriate!<br /><br />I'm going to risk a lot here and say that I haven't seen a film this enjoyable in about two years. And the audience that watched it with me seemed to agree; they all stood and applauded when the credits started rolling.

B0000DBJDM|4.0|If your previous experience with this movie was the original cut, be aware, this version is different.  Footage has been added and the overall pace of the movie has been quickened.  Having said that, I cannot say that the movie has really been improved or worsened.  I am very familiar with the older VHS cut so I know where the cuts and addidtions have happened.  It is still a cool movie for Floyd fans, but if you like the old school version it will take some getting used to.  If you are not familiar with the older cut, then by all means enjoy, it is still an entertaining flick, although it does have some flaws.  The additional footage that has been added dates from the original shoot (early 70's) to the presnt day.  The new footage (some of which is CG) can be kind of jarring when spliced into earlier stuff (seems to be an obvious afterthought sometimes) but it does still work.  Most of the added footage is space/NASA/stock footage which is also seems like an odd choice, but I guess it is just as relevent as footage of vulcanism and eruptions in a film about Pink Floyd (space rock?) playing music in a town destroyed by a volcano.  Also, a 5.1 mix would have been cool, but so be it.  Wrapping up, if you like the old version, live in the now, and if this is a new movie to you, enjoy!
6304696558|4.0|Goldie Hawn has long had a knack for comedy.  \\"Private Benjamin\\" is one of her best comedies.  The \\"Jewish Princess\\" persona wears a little thin in a few places, but most of the time the comedy works well.<br /><br />Judy Benjamin (Hawn) has led a pampered life.  We learn this early in the movie when Judy becomes upset that the upholsterer has failed to find an obscure color for an ottoman.  The movie proceeds to develop Judy's character as that of a woman that has received excessive luxuries from everyone in her life, with the only requirement that she be obedient.  As we join the movie, it seems that Judy is about to get her life long wish.  She is about to marry a man of great promise, her parents are thrilled, and she has tons of expensive wedding gifts.  Unfortunately for Judy, the wedding night exertions are too much for her new spouse, and Judy finds herself a newlywed widow.<br /><br />Judy learns that she is good for little.  She is non-functional as a secretary.  Judy is spoiled to the point of absurdity.  She is unable to cook.  I doubt she knows how to clean house.  Judy realizes she needs to get her life moving along again, but she does not know how.  A fortuitous phone call has Judy visiting an Army recruiter, where she learns that modern army life is full of beautiful bases, condos, and yachts, not to mention great medical benefits.  Judy believes the recruiters picture of Army life, and heads off to basic training.<br /><br />Basic training is filled with the lovely accommodating people that you might anticipate.  Judy quickly learns that her recruiter misled her more than a lot.  Captain Doreen Lewis (Eileen Brennan) initially makes Judy's life a living hell.  Judy wants to quit the Army, but a visit from her parents makes Judy realize that she is tired of people pushing her around, so Judy turns into a model soldier.<br /><br />Judy turns misfortune into embarrassment for Captain Lewis.  Judy catches her current love interest Captain William Woodbridge (Craig T. Nelson) in a rather interesting position with a fellow recruit.  Judy and a small band of misfits manage to take guard duty of a swamp and turn it into a major embarrassment of Captain Lewis, but glory for Judy and her gang.  After Captain Lewis punishes the barracks once more for all the embarrassment she has received, Judy and her fellow recruits get their revenge with a little bit of dye.<br /><br />Judy's life seems to have hit a turning point.  She is in charge of herself and doing well.  She turns another embarrassing incident into a European assignment.  Judy soon finds the man of her dreams, again.  Unfortunately, Captain Lewis also has an assignment at the same facility, and she still wants to make Private Benjamin's life as difficult as possible.  Life becomes very interesting for Judy as she decides how to stay in control of her life.<br /><br />This movie has far more humor than my mellow review would intimate.  This movie has numerous one-liners that bring smiles all the way to serious laughs.  Judy Benjamin complains to Captain Lewis that she signed up with a different Army, the one with the condos and the yachts.  When a drill sergeant tells Private Benjamin that she is only permitted to stop running if she is puking, she does; on his shoes.  When Captain Lewis tells Judy that she is not fit to wear an Army uniform, Judy replies that she has been trying to tell her that.<br /><br />Goldie Hawn does an excellent job of bringing the role of Private Benjamin to life.  She performed so well that she was nominated for a Best Actress in a Leading Role.  Eileen Brennan was also outstanding, and was nominated for Best Actress in a Supporting Role.  Both nominations were well deserved.<br /><br />This movie is rated R because it has several scenes that are bit risqu&eacute;.  Considering today's standards, an R rating seems a little excessive.  Regardless, this movie is not a family movie.<br /><br />The occasional bumpy spots in the movie are more than compensated for by the humor of the rest of the movie.  This movie is one that I watch when I want light comedy with guaranteed funny jokes.  After watching this movie a half dozen times, I suspect I will watch it many more times.  Now, if they would release this movie in a wide screen format, this movie would be even better.movie are more than compensated for by the humor of the rest of the movie.

B000G759LW|3.0|7 Years in her career later, Christina Aguilera has successfully morphed herself into a classy diva. While her peers are busy breast feeding or ripping off Madonna songs, Christina has spent the last year and a half tailoring Back To Basics -- an ambitious double album with a throwback to old school music spanning from the 20s to late 70s. The idea was to modernize music from the past, namely jazz and blues. Extract elements from the genres and fuse them with pop, hip hop, and R&B. With the help of producers DJ Priemier, Kwame, and Linda Perry -- mission accomplished.  <br /> <br />Back To Basics works in giving the listner show-stopping performances in standout tracks \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", \\"Understand\\", \\"Back In The Day\\", \\"Save Me From Myself\\", \\"Candyman\\", \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\", and \\"Mercy On Me\\". Christina's voice shines through like never before, and it becomes apparent immediately that she has learned to control it to an extent. Unfortunately, she has traded in melisma for screaming/shouting her words, giving you the idea that she's purposely trying to bust your eardrums as she sings as though for a superbowl crowd. Apart from that spectacular/irritating voice, lyrically she has improved by dropping the cliche-ridden lines that we saw in her last album, \\"Stripped\\". These days Christina sings about love, her mother, love, Scott Storch, love, celebrity, love, and love. Subtley was never her strong point, neither vocally or lyrically, but it doesn't detract from the album. <br /> <br />Aguilera shows a vast amount of musical growth and maturity on her latest venture, and where it works -- it works.
B000G759LW|5.0|My God...there is no way to explain how awesome Back To Basics is. So I guess I'll give you a review of each song, for you to read:<br /><br />Intro (Back To Basics): Christina really loves to do an introduction before you start listening to the albums, to tell you what to expect. 9/10<br /><br />Makes Me Wanna Pray: Very Uptempo Gospel-eque song, it's great...it's one of those songs you sing in the car, just having fun. 10/10<br /><br />Back In the Day: She pays tribute to those before her, and talks about her idols. It's uptempo, but not my favorite 7/10<br /><br />Ain't No Other Man: No words to explain this song, it's GOLD...everybody loves it, 10/10<br /><br />Understand: This song is a mid-tempo song, and is quite different...it isn't uptempo, but it isn't a ballad. This song is one of the odd ones, but my favorite on Disc 1. 10.5/10<br /><br />Slow Down Baby: Sounds like an old 90's vibe, and very radio-friendly. If this were a single, it'll blow everyone out of the water---yes I mean you Beyonce and Nelly F. 10/10<br /><br />Oh Mother: Just like \\"I'm OK\\" from her previous album, Christina opens up about the domestic violence her mother and her siblings delt with when she lived with her father. It's about how her mother was strong, and how she had to leave him for her kids. It's beautiful.  9/10<br /><br />F.U.S.S: Many people will disagree with me, but this is filler for me. 4/10<br /><br />On Our Way: I like this song, it's very soft-spoken (the chorus), and you can really feel DJ Premier's presence here with the beats. 8/10<br /><br />Without You: Sounds like a real 1999 pop song, maybe from her first album, however she somehow avoids making this song a terrible song, the lyrics are wonderful. 8.5/10<br /><br />Still Dirrty: Her promise to herself that even though she's married, she still is the same woman from the Stripped era, and wrote this song to tell the public...that Christina still has the \\"nasty in me (her), still got that dirrty degree\\". 9.5/10<br /><br />Here To Stay: I love this song...I prefer this version compared to the Pepsi Commericial, because it keeps with the horns and the rest of the sounds of the album, so it could fit in. This could be a single, maybe. 10/10<br /><br />Thank You (Dedication To Fans): 3/10<br /><br />DISC 2:<br /><br />Enter the Circus/Welcome: These two go together, just like Walk Away went together with Fighter. It has a Circus feel to it, and shows Christina doing a different kind of song, forign from the rest of the album...it leaves you wanting more. 10/10<br /><br />CandyMan: The 2nd Single, is my favorite song on Disc 2. I love it, it's very fun, poppy, and dirrty all at the same time. It's quite entertaining, it's still on repeat! 15/10<br /><br />Nasty Naughty Boy: The Burlesque-y song of the album, this would be the \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\" of Back To Basics, very sexual...you have to hear to believe. I love it... 10/10<br /><br />I Got Trouble: Heard in the beginning and end of the Aint No Other Man Video, I thought it was just filler material, but this song has become one of the highlights of the album, how they got the sound and it really does sound like it came from the 1920's. 10/10<br /><br />Hurt: Many have said this is the \\"Beautiful\\" of Back To Basics, and I have to agree. It is defenitely Grammy material and really showcases her voice at it's utter best. 11/10<br /><br />Mercy On Me: A very Catholic confession about asking for forgiveness from God, one of my favorites...when you listen to this track, you can hear how stronger her voice has gotten. 12/10<br /><br />Save Me From Myself: I love it, it's Christina stripped from her Diva seat, and just singing softly to a guitar about her hubby, Jordan. It's so beautiful...a tribute to her husband. 10/10<br /><br />The Right Man: My 2nd favorite song on Disc 2, it talks about how she had no father-figure at her wedding, and how Jordan became the right man for her...and vowing her daughter will not live like she did.11/10<br /><br />Overall, this album exceeds Stripped in so many ways, Christina has done the public well, she will suck the Grammy's dry this year. It's her year to shine, and she's going for it all!ng her daughter will not live like she did. 11/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this album exceeds Stripped in so many ways, Christina has done the public well, she will suck the Grammy's dry this year. It's her year to shine, and she's going for it all!
B00002SSKI|5.0|My daughter and I watched this movie for the first time when she was about 13 years old.  She is almost 18 now and we still watch it whenever it's on.  I bought the movie for her so we could enjoy it whenever we wanted. She opened it and right 'Now and Then' we watched it together for the umpteenth time, enjoying it just as much as we did the first time we watched it together.  This is a classic, bringing the past and the present together and bringing a mother and daughter together time and time again.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Werner Herzog did his homework, and managed to produce an absolute vampire \\"classic\\".  This is a horror film that excells in offering exactly what one would imagine what a vampire and the victims' world is like.  Beautiful, haunting, dark, gothic locales...misery (in the form of longing for love and a normal life) that dogs a vampire...sensual atmosphere that yields asexual circumstances...The film is a \\"must-have\\" for those of us who find this particular genre of horror films enticing to our imagination.

Their debut was defintely the group trying to feel out what it felt like to longer be Groundswell. <br /> <br />All this being said, Three Days Grace is a pop rock outfit.  Their last album was pop, this one is pop, only this one displays a much more mature viewpoint.  The songwriting has improved vastly, and they've shed quite a bit of the adolescent skin they used to have. <br /> <br />Too good a CD for most of their fanbase to appreciate it seems.
0446310786|5.0|This is an awesome book.  It is my favorite of all time.  This book inspired me to think with metacognition and it also inspired me to have a great sense of perserverance.  The best part about this book is what it teaches u.  It taught me that u shouldnt fight against whats right, if its wrong, dont go for it.  This happens in the book when atticus defends Tom Robinson in court, everyone didnt want him to, but he knew it was right, so he did. This is where the title of the book comes into play.  U'll know what i mean when u read it!  I recomend for everyone and anyone!!
0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson is best known for writing very humorous travel books, and \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is indeed a funny account of his travels in Australia. Those who love Bill Bryson's books for their humor won't be disappointed.    But unlike most people, I like Bill Bryson best when he's NOT trying to be funny, and my appreciation of this book is mostly due to the great amount of very interesting information presented.    Bill Bryson amazes you with loads of information about the geology, the animal life, the plants and insects, the history, the statistics, the folklore, etc., etc. The many dangers: poisonous snakes, poisonous insects, poisonous jellyfish, crocodiles, sharks, and rip currents - they're all out to get you. The inhospitable deserts, the beautiful beaches, the huge distances; Bill Bryson gives you a feeling of what it's all like.     The book goes into detail about many aspects of Australian life that are fairly unknown, including the discovery (and re-discovery) of Australia, the settlement by British prisoners, the early expeditions to explore the interior, the gold rushes, the outlaws, and the devastation caused by rabbits and other imported animals and plants. Bill Bryson talks about the many unusual animal species found only in Australia, including giant earthworms that grow up to 1 meter (and can be stretched to 4 meters) and the platypus, a cross between a reptile and a mammal. He talks about Australians and the Australian society, and the situation regarding the native people, the aboriginals.    Bill Bryson doesn't cover all of Australia from the geographical point of view, and the parts he does cover are somewhat random. But that doesn't matter because he captures the spirit of the whole country based on the parts he does visit and the general information he includes.    A very positive aspect is that Bill Bryson makes it clear that he loves Australia. The feeling is infectious, and it makes you want to pack your bags and head \\"down under\\" for along leisurely trip so you can do your own exploring.    If I were to mention two things I was less happy about, it would be the occasional excessive attempts to be funny and the lack of contact with Australians. One of the best parts of the book is about his traveling together with an Australian couple for 3-4 days, but other than this passage Bill Bryson is mostly playing the typical tourist, with little or no contact with Australians. And despite a fairly long discussion about the aboriginal situation he does not ever get into contact with any aboriginals. Why not?    A final note regarding the unabridged audio version of the book, read by Bill Bryson himself: Most authors are poor readers, but Mr. Bryson does a very good job here, almost on a par with a professional reader. Recommended.    Rennie Petersen    PS. \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" has also been published under the title \\"Down Under\\". It is exactly the same book.
B00005B1W7|5.0|When you think of Television mini series, you may think of such great television production in the 70's and 80s (its GOLDEN era) such like Backstairs at the White House, Upstairs Downstairs, The Bourne Identity (yes long before Matt Damon movie-with Richard Chamberlain and Jackie Smith), Roots (and the mini series sequel Roots the Next Generation), North and South (books 1-3), Noble House (with future James Bond Pierce Bronsnan), Shogun (with Richard Chamberlain), Jesus of Narazeth , Rich Man Poor Man (with newcomer Nick Nolte), Holocaust (with Meryl Streep and James Woods)or even The Thorn Birds (again with Chamberlain). These were some of the best TV had to offer. However, in April 1974 , the first NOVEL FOR TELEVISION (done on ABC TV) was presented. Over two nights.... Leon Uris QB V!!.<br /><br />The story of Abraham Cady (Ben Gazzara) learns of his Jewish heritage from his father (Dr No's Joseph Wiseman)-- that most of his family had been exterminated in the gas chambers at the Jadwiga concentration camp. After becoming penetrated in Jewish faith after his father's death, Cady decides to move to Israel and write a book called The Holocaust. In this book, Cady accuses a surgeon, Dr. Adam Kelno (played with Relish by Anthony Hopkins), as being one of the doctors at the Jadwiga camp that did experiments on other human beings and was a war criminal. Dr. Kelno finds out about the book and decides to sue Cady in court to prove that Cady is a liar. This is based of the real life case where Leon Uris was a defendant in a law suit growing from his novel Exodus, where someone sued Uris saying he were defamed<br /><br />Told in two parts, Kelno's story on the first night and the second night is Cady.story . This production lead the way for many future mini series. The production was filmed in Hollywood, England, Belguim and Israel and it shows in the production detailed filming.<br /><br />Lets talk supporting cast of this piece Leslie Caron, Milo O'Shea, Sir John Gielgud, Juliet Mills, Lee Remick, Joseph Wiseman, Sir Anthony Quayle, Jack Hawkins, and Kris Tabori-all holding their own with the talented leads Gazzara and Hopkins .

B00005JP5J|4.0|Funny, funny, funny. If you're looking for a film that tears apart American middle-class sensibilities, throwing in a potshot at snobbish intellectual university culture and go-get'em, \\"Number 1 is all that matters\\" attitudes, this is the place to be. Greg Kinnear is the Dad Richard, a motivational speaker that just can't seem to get his marketing deal to go through. Toni Collette is Mom Sheryl, seemingly the only sensible one in the crowd. Steve Carell is Frank,  Sheryl's college prof. brother, just recovering from a suicide attempt because he lost out to a competitor who wins the prize as the nation's preeminent scholar on Proust and runs off with the boy heartbreak of Frank's dreams at the same time. Alan Arkin is Grandpa, Richard's porn-loving, heroin-snorting Dad, evicted from his retirement home for making endless, loudmouthed trouble.  Paul Dano is Dwayne, the 15-year old son who's sworn a vow of silence brought on by his dedication to the writings of Nietzsche, pledging tight lips until he gets into the Air Force Academy to fly jets. <br />And then there's Abigail Breslin as cute 7-year old daughter Olive, who dreams of being a Beauty Queen. As they all gather at the dinner table one night to partake of a bucket of chicken, Sheryl's 2-minute salad and Sprite, they learn that Olive is a finalist in the Little Miss Sunshine competition.    <br />Thus opens a road trip movie for all of us, rather than a road trip movie about disaffected bohemians. This film goes places, exposing winner-take-all attitudes for their hurtful bitterness, opening the curtains on marriage missing communicatons, peeling off the wrapper of misunderstood youth and elders alike, and does all of that without a lick of patronizing pretension. By the time the family hits the beauty competition in Redondo Beach, having traveled from New Mexico in a VW bus that definitely has some health problems, you'll think you've seen everything the writers could throw at you. But Olive's contribution tothe pageant and the reaction of the snobby, snooty purveyors and followers of prepubescent girl-glam contests was seriously the funniest thing I've seen in a theatre all year. <br />Oh, yeah, and it shows that families can stick together, too, even the ones with a lot of problems.
1401206905|5.0|Anyone who enjoyed the Btaman Begins movie will savor this Frank Miller retelling of Batman's first year as a crime fighter. Miller script is tight like his previous works or his Sin City stuff.<br /><br />It is the retelling of this classic that makes it interesting. In the hands of a storyteller like Miller, this work isn't ancient history retold..it is like the Man of Steel Mini series (and Graphic Novel)  that John Byrum did a few years ago. This is the Batman in the beginning, course and rough..not the great detective he is now<br /><br />Is it worth it? This retelling of the beginning of the BATMEN canon is pure GOLD to my eyes. Note to Frank Miller, I love Kevin Smith's Green Arrow--but would you take a Stab at it, PLEASE!<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD

0375507256|1.0|We always have to read books like this at book group, rather than anything with a proper plot. I think I started it half-a-dozen times before I gave up completely.  It was dull and pretentious and I couldn't concentrate on any of the stories. I'm sorry but I really didn't enjoy it. After this book I decided to give up the book group. My girlfriend seems to enjoy it much more than I do, though, and she's still going. She seems to find the books much better than I do. And she seems to spend most of her time with her book group mates anyway these days. Maybe she'd rather be going out with David Mitchell or something.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae is GREAT!!! <br />This is a CD you listen to when your in the mood to sit back relax and listen to something smooth.  Corinne Bailey Rae's voice is incredible. The CD is a mixture of jazz, soul, and r&b. If you love artist like eryka badu, jill scott, billy holiday etc, you will fall in love with this CD as soon as you hear the first track.  Hope you love it just as much as I do.
076531178X|4.0|Mistborn was a really good book--interesting, satisfying, and engaging. <br /> <br />Sanderson's first book had a great story, but his characters were a little wooden, and the writing kind of raw.  Even so, I couldn't put it down, and when I did, I thought, dang, I liked this book!   <br /> <br />Sanderson's second book shows that he is maturing as a writer, highlighting again his impressive skills in creating a unique and original world and plot, with an interesting and unlikely system of magic.  The characters are a lot more realistic in this one, and the writing is more polished.  And, once again I found myself staying up late and spending too much time reading one of Sanderson's novels.   <br /> <br />Sanderson is definitely an exciting new talent in the genre.  I have to say that I'm pretty tired of elves and sorcerers, and am glad to have some interesting new worlds and ideas to delve into.   <br /> <br />Overall, an engaging and enjoyable novel.  I am definitely looking forward to the next one coming out!
B00005JL7Q|5.0|I've never been much of a Hugh Grant fan, but he was surprising effective in this movie.  Grant's character starts out as a self centered womanizer who thought that having a kid around would make meeting women easier.  The kid hangs around Grant because in him the kid has a friend which would up his coolness quotient.  The comedy is subtle, but very effective.  This is not a laugh out loud kind of fare, but more of something you'd chukle to.  All in all, it's a very well made movie.  I especially like the ending.

B0009VRHLK|5.0|There is a lot about the Brown Bunny that didn't make sense, but in the end I found myself haunted by it. I find it rather ironic, that Bud Clay loved Daisy despite the fact that she didn't make sense, and in the end he was haunted by her.<br /><br />In any case, the Brown Bunny is a film about a motorcycle racer who travels across country for his next race which happens to be in California, near where the love of his life, Daisy, lives. There is little more I can say about the film without giving away spoilers, for this is a film with a minimalist plot. Bud does meet some women across the way; women he is attracted to, yet, who are not Daisy.<br /><br />Many say that the Brown Bunny is junk, but it did a lot for me. Here goes...<br /><br />First, the scenes with Bud and the woman were some of the best man - woman interaction I have seen on film. With little to no words, I felt myself attracted to them. Gallo does a marvelous job of using the camera to convey attraction. Despite the quirkiness of the 3 flowers, Rose, Lilly and Violet, I found myself oddly attracted to them. This was due to the filmmaker and the acting between Gallo and said actresses. In these 3 minimalistic scenes, Gallo shows us everything that can be good about film romance, and everything that Hollywood is missing. Call it a lesson on chemistry, if you will.<br /><br />Second, the film felt familiar. It felt like my journey, and a journey I have taken. The journey built up suspense as to what Bud was up too, and in the end delivered. But more than that, the journey is familiar because each of us (or most of us) have had those confusing days where a relationship has wavered and we are trying to figure life out. Bud's journey is our journey, and the Brown Bunny, despite using little words, conveys that well. Those who have never had a dysfunctional or soul mate-gone-wrong relationship might think this point is silly.<br /><br />Third, the acting was brilliant. The immersion, off the scale. The intangibles were huge. Often the camera seemed to say a thousand words when the dialog said little. The silence spoke volumes. Sunsets, scenery and sadness.<br /><br />Lastly, I walked away from the film thinking and feeling. It made me think about love, and live, and those I have yearned for but lost. I went to bed a ball of mixed emotions. Few films do this.<br /><br />In the end, Brown Bunny is minimalistic with little dialog, but it is a movie well worth seeing. It makes you think, makes you feel, makes you wonder, and leaves  glad you watched the film, for better or for worse. Just like Bud Clay.<br /><br />I loved it. I hated it. I loved it. If you don't understand dysfunction, Bud Clay, or the movie, you won't understand why I say this.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 90<br /><br />47 (out of 50). Enjoyment.

1400096936|4.0|First of all, I did enjoy Don Winslow's \\"Power of the Dog.\\"  It has some important, and I think very relevant and true things to say about the failure of the so-called \\"War on Drugs\\" to do anything except enrich those who ply the trade (although the author does not quite make the comparison explicit, the current \\"War on Terror\\" can easily be seen as a rerun of this failure). The plot is grounded in recent history, such as the abduction and torture of a DEA agent several years ago, the rise of the Mexican drug cartels, the U.S. involvement in Mexican politics, and the baleful effects of American meddling.  On the whole, Winslow's interpretations of this history seem valid and important.  As a thriller, it does not disappoint, and anyone seeking a good airplane or beach read will not be disappointed. <br />However, the author has been ill-served by his publisher.  A good editor could have slimmed down this 540 or so pages by 100-150 or so without losing any of the intricate plot or much of the background.  The writing quickly veers into bestseller-type bloat and sentimentality.  The characters are not well developed, and sloppily described.  The author seems to have strange clothes and food obsessions, always a short-cut to character development.  We always get to know what even the most minor character has for breakfast and what they wear in every scene. We get 2-3 pages on a seedy San Diego motel, a canned tour trip of Hong Kong, and when some characters are on the run, we get the complete eight lines of their grocery list. The sentimentality weakens the book tremendously:  we always know who the author likes and who he doesn't, and know well in advance that the latter will soon come to an unpleasant end. There's as much emotional string-pulling going on as in a Disney movie, most of it to little effect, as almost all the characters are unlikeable.   <br />In a purportedly realistic thriller, the details are important, but a lot of them are questionable or just plain wrong. Everyone about to be offed suddenly acts very dumb just before they get it.  A scene with someone on a Harley chasing and shooting three pistoleros in a BMW at 80 m.p.h. is simply laughable (don't try this at home!).  The Chinese would nver have a high-ranking official in a shed with a pistol holding a hostage over an arms deal; surely they've heard of electronic funds transfer. And the lights of Tijuana do not \\"twinkle and wink\\" from San Diego's Shelter Island. And on and on. <br />But, these serious quibbles aside, I hope this gets a wide readership, as it has some valid points to make, as well as being superior entertainment.
B000B8IA2G|4.0|I stumbled across this show late one night when I couldn't sleep.  At the time, I had never seen an episode of Stargate SG1 much less Stargate Atlantis.  I was taken by the characters and the storyline.  However, Stargate Atlantis is now in Season Three so I thought I should buy the first season.  I am very impressed.  The show is great!  The extras are even better.  There are commentaries on almost every episode.  Not from just the producers and directors either.  The actors, such as David Hewlitt, do a lot of the commentaries.  There are also video diaries and behind the scenes stuff.  It is definately worth the price.  I can't wait for Season Two.

B000000OF6|5.0|OK, let's get this straight ... some younger fans tuned into Queen in the 80's and that's ok, but by then many original fans had tuned out and were busy making a living to keep up with all the trash that came out in that decade. <br /> <br />So down to business ... Disc 1 is home for me ... I know all the songs by heart and they are part of me. Five stars, even if some important ones are missing. Disc 2 you can thow in the trash can ... radio gaga pop garbage. Well maybe not garbage as it is Queen after all, but nothing here worth my while. <br /> <br />Queen stopped being Queen right after Live Killers ... how come that one is not listed on Amazon ? ... I swear I've seen it somewhere (other than LP and 8-Track, which I own !). Come on, let's have Live Killers back, it is the best. Ten stars !

B00026W82U|5.0|Riot on a Quiet Street is a truly absorbing and outstanding album. The influence of Simon and Garfunkel is very obvious, but Kings of Convenience tailor their inspirations to produce a genuine acoustical style. Like their previous album, many songs explore the topics of love and heartbreak. Their songs never sound depressing, but there a sense of longing that is quite beautiful.    Kings of Convenience stick to a relatively simple formula of acoustic guitars, upright bass, some twinkling piano, and light percussion. For many bands, such a formula would come of as trite, but here, it is one of the band's strengths. The beauty in this album arises from the pure simplicity of the duo's harmonies, and how these harmonies effortlessly interleave with the mellow lyrics. \\"Misread\\" utilizes a simple, repeating piano theme, which complements the song's nostalgic air. The spritely \\"I'd Rather Dance With You\\" is perhaps the duo's most famous song. With an upbeat tempo and bouncy guitar riff, the song is perhaps the most lively track on the record. \\"Cayman Islands\\" is an extraordinarily powerful song that only utilizes guitar and some strings. The resonant harmonies evoke a sense of deep contemplation and reflection.    Perhaps Riot on a Quiet Street's greatest strength is that it is such an unassuming album. There is no dense and obtuse intellectual commentary or abstract artistry on this album. Like a sunset on a cold winter day, Kings of Convenience take advantage of the beauty in simplicity and harmony.

0375703764|2.0|Like others, I had heard House of Leaves was supposed to be this fabulously scary book. Unfortunately, I spent so much time turning the book around, reading backwards, flipping pages, and getting lost in the footnotes, that I was constantly pulled out of the horror. Which seems a shame, because I think the underlying horror story could be scary. It's an interesting attempt at interactive reading, an idea which I like, but it didn't quite work for me. I know I gave it 2 stars, rather than 3, and that's because I just couldn't get into the story. Like the others reviewers, if you're looking for something unusual and interactive with your books, this may well be it.
B00002Z88D|5.0|About a year ago, I had a few Metallica songs in my computer and most of them wore from \\"S&M\\". I enjoyed listening to \\"Master Of Puppets\\", which was my favourite at that time, and so I bought the whole album! I wasn't at all disapointed and it suddenly became my favourite live album. Some of my favourite tracks are \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", \\"Battery\\"...but my all time favourite is \\"One\\" (a trully excelent live performance!). And...\\"this it how it all started\\". Today, I have almost all their albums and I really enjoy listening to all of them. It's really hard for me to make a Metallica album chart, but \\"S&M\\" is undoubtebly going for top 3!

B000002H2H|5.0|\\"Ride The Lightning\\" is, by far, my favourite Metallica album! Sure, \\"Master Of Puppets\\" has it's glory, but this masterpiece has the energy, the fire and the speed that, in my opinion, beats the hell out of MOP. My album top 5 goes something like this: <br />1. the sad, yet powerfull ballad \\"Fade To Black\\" (my favourite Metallica song after \\"One\\") <br />2. the lethal \\"Creeping Death\\"  <br />3. the heroical \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\"  <br />4. the fearless \\"The Call Of Ktulu\\"  <br />5. the angry \\"Ride The Lightning\\"  <br />Of course, I like all of the tracks because they all give me a free and powerfull feeling that get's me right back on track when I feel down! This album is also special for me because it represents a giant leap from the childish \\"Kill 'em All\\" to the mature and powerfull Metallica we know or used to know...In conclusion, \\"Ride The Lightning\\" is an album worth listening and it's 8 tracks are going right to the point of Metallica in it's best componence and at it's best!

0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning by Lemony Snicket is a very influential book and has had an impact on my life. It was one of the first books I was reading while I was maturing as a reader.    The book shows that life isn't always fair, but also that perseverance and never giving up is important and things may work out in the end. Things won't happen if you don't take the initiative. It also depicts that there are people with good and bad intentions within the world. There is a potential within us to do good or bad, the decision is left up to us and we must live with whatever happens, the consequences. The author's style revolves around the use of formal language as well as explaining words and phrases that adds to understanding and the mood of the story. Figurative language such as similes, metaphors, and clichés are also exercised in the book.    The book is aimed at a young audience. I would highly recommend this gem of a novel.
B000E5N62U|5.0|First of all, I appologise for my poor english. But I felt I need to write something about this big return of Donald Fagen to his solo work. Although I do not always underestand the lyrics, I can comment on the work and production. The production, as always with any other Steely Dan production, is flawless. Crystal clear sound and exellent musicianship. It's even more jazzy then the previous albums like Two against nature and Everything must go. The tracks are significantly longer. A bit long for the avarage pop music listener, but I am used to listen long music. I think Donald simply wanted to create something bigger, longer, and more sophisticated use of jazz. I cannot really comment on the tracks because anything that I write will be my own personal choice. I personally enjoyed \\"What I do\\", \\"The great pagoda of funn\\", \\"Security joan\\" and \\"H gang\\". The others also I enjoyed, but the weakest track maybe in my opinnion is the title track.  <br />I think Donald had made a great return and showd us he is still doing one of the best grooves around. I am so unhapy that I will be missing the Steely dan tour this summer. I hope you guys from US, had oportunity to be there.
B000G759LW|5.0|I didn't think that Christina could ever top \\"Stripped\\", but she has proven me wrong.  I love this album so much, and it kills me to hear people talk bad about it, because this is how real music is susposed to sound.  REAL MUSIC!  Anyways, fans of Christina will more than likely fall in love with this album, but this CD also has a chance to attract more than just her fans.  The album is universal, and Christina deserves a huge amount of respect for putting out such a well-made product.   <br /> <br />Great job Xtina...  I just can't wait to see what you come up with next!
0140135154|2.0|After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.<br /><br />Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their \\"stuff\\" and the \\"stuff\\" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.  Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?<br /><br />It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the \\"capitalism is bad\\" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.<br /><br />Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial.
B000G75AE8|5.0|these guys really know how to tear it up. they are the kings of thrash. if you mess with these guys, you're just going to end up bloodied and bruised. it's nice to see Dave Lombardo behind the drums after his stint with Grip Inc. kudos to Slayer for coming back. they are big stars now. standout tracks? as far as I am concerned, the whole album is a standout. if you like Slayer, other bands to try out are Destruction, Kreator, Sodom, Pantera,(R.I.P.) Testament, Exodus, Megadeth, Forbidden (R.I.P.), Sacred Reich,(R.I.P), Flotsam & Jetsam, Carnal Forge, and newcomers Demiricous.
0312954468|4.0|Only drawback; it's long, too long, but for sheer imaginative scope, Wilbur Smith's River God tops everything I've ever read. The story is narrated by the charming eunuch slave Taita, whose secret passion for queen Lostris surprises - until we learn Taita reached manhood before being castrated in order to render him \\"safe\\" for service in the palace. He retains his passion, artistic drives and incredible mind, and the exercise of these alone are entertainment of the highest order. After his responsibility to the queen, Taita's primary task in life is to oversee the creation of the treasures the pharaoh will carry to the next life. Along the way - if you believe Taita's egotistical and often condescending reports  (and I loved believing) - he engineers the cutting of stones for the pyramid, personally carves the most exquisite of the golden treasures to be entombed with the ruler, influences most of Pharoah's decisions, protects his friends and destroys his enemies and oh yes, devises equipment and tactics which make the army invincible. Ultimately, however, the Hyksos arrive, an enemy whose primary weapon - the horse - is unknown. The hoard drives toward the capital city, defeating the Pharoah's forces wherever they are met and finally it is necessary for Taita to oversee putting everything of value aboard barges and direct the flight to the south.   In the high place where the Nile valley ends and the vast plain of Africa begins, Taita and the remnants of the royal family go into hiding while Taita, deprived of his pyramid, struggles to conceive a way to create a safe tomb. Here, unfortunately, Smith has essentially exhausted his story material. The lengthy narrative covers decades, and becomes a relatively colorless telling of events - and as the end sections set up the precedents for The Seventh Scroll, (second novel in the sequence), of unfortunate necessity everything must be kept suitably vague. We never learn where the pharaoh is finally buried, and the wholestory kind of subsides rather than coming to a rousing end.   It doesn't matter. What has already gone has left the imagination reeling and sated. There's also the story that awaits in The Seventh Scroll - I had no idea what it would be, but let me tell you, it knocked my socks off.   If you are tired of the same old same old, I suggest you buy a NEW (un-sneezed upon) copy of River God and treat yourself to a read that will stir your imagination like no other.  If Wilbur Smith lived on the great lakes, he'd have written \\"The Secret Ever Keeps\\". He lives in Africa, so I had to do it for him. If you like Wilbur Smith, you'll love \\"The Secret Ever Keeps\\". Here's the Amazon page.  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601640048/
B00005JOQS|1.0|This could have been a great film, it wished to be. It only lacked the light to show the way. It also lacked an actor strong enough to anchor it. <br /> <br />The Plot: Pitching itself as \\"the Superman 3 that should have been\\", scientists have spotted what appeared to be the remnants of his home world Krypton, prompting Superman (exit tall, dark, effortlessly heroic Christopher Reeve, enter tall, dark, metro sexual newcomer Brandon Routh) to leave Earth, without bothering to tell anyone, not even his would be lover and co-worker Lois Lane (exit Margot Kidder, enter Kate Bosworth), to see for himself what was floating around out there. Now he has returned to Earth after his 5 year space odyssey to learn more about Krypton has failed. The world has moved on, Lois has moved on, now a mother(!) with a nice guy fiancé, Richard White (James Marsden), nephew of their boss Perry (Frank Langella), and having written a Pulitzer prize winning article \\"Why the World Does't Need Superman\\", a thinly veiled rant of hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned. As Clark Kent, our protagonist gets his job back at the Daily Planet and then makes his grand return as Superman, triumphantly saving a jet to the hearty welcome of a grateful baseball stadium. But Lex Luthor (exit Gene Hackman, enter Kevin Spacey) is on the loose, and he's got revenge on his mind as well as a plan to create a new continent with the crystal technology he stole from Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Will Superman be able to thwart him?  <br /> <br />The story of how the first round of Superman films were eventually destroyed by off screen mishandling, proving that even Superman cannot overpower Hollywood stupidity, is now the stuff of legend, as is the story of Warner Brothers quest to bring Superman back into movie theaters, a quest that spanned almost 20 years and countless writers, directors, and actors. It's an evil story my friends, and the fact that WB still relies on Superman and Batman to bring in the audiences, for no better reason than the fact that they are Superman and Batman, when DC Comics is loaded with other deep, richly intriguing heroes, ranging from Wonder Woman to Aquaman, from Green Lantern to Flash, from Captain Marvel to the Martian Manhunter, is mind-boggling as well as disheartening. After goth-master Tim Burton, TV maestro JJ Abrams, fan boy champion Kevin Smith, and the much maligned Brett Ratner among others all tried and failed to bring about a story based upon the Death of Superman storyline from the early 90s, Bryan Singer, director of X-Men 1 and 2, came along, and pitched the idea to Warner Brothers of a kind of semi-sequel to the first two Superman films directed by Richard Donner and R. Lester, including the use of archive footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, the crystallized look of Krypton and the Fortress of Solitude, and using John Williams Superman score, as opposed to starting over with a new continuity like \\"Batman Begins\\". <br /> <br />It was a bold, ambitious idea, and the final result is a valiant effort by a man who claims to have always loved, admired and identified with Superman, based more on his love for the TV series that starred George Reeves and the original Donner film than on the actual comics. But it just doesn't work. For starters, the demographic friendly leads, 26 year old Brandon Routh and 23 year old Kate Bosworth, are too young to believably pass themselves off as a Superman who has been missing for 5 years and a Lois Lane who is supposed to be an accomplished reporter turned single mother. Apparently Singer became so fixated on the idea of casting an unknown in the role of Superman, one of many moves that mimicked the approach of Donner all those years ago, that if Superman were to have been missing for any length of time, he should look old enough to have been missing and also look old enough to have the experience of a great hero under his belt. Jim Caviezel, at the ripe old age of 37, would have fit these requirements perfectly - already tall, dark and heroically handsome while also experienced enough as both an actor and as a human being to dig deep into the conflicting feelings within Superman. But Singer, blinded by hubris from his success with the X-Men films, and succumbing to the idea of actors young to enough to have multiple sequels belted out of them, decided to have his cake and eat it too by casting some young guy no one had ever heard of, and matching him with an equally young leading lady. Adding insult to injury, Singer and his idiot costume designer Louise Migenbach, butchered Superman's costume, darkening the red parts to maroon/burgundy shrinking and raising the \\"S\\" insignia and giving the costume an overall rubbery look. After all Migenbach's rantings of what a brilliant job she did updating the costume and bitching about how she always hated the suit's classic color scheme and all those speeches about how Superman should look as though he stepped right out of our collective conscience, Singer's Superman looks more like a high school jock in a bad Halloween costume. Donner's film didn't have nearly as big a budget as Singer's, and Donner didn't have nearly as advanced technology as Singer has, and Donner's people were still able to turn out a suit that looked exactly like the one in the comics, and it looked damn good too (the same can also be said of the Dean Cain TV series). <br /> <br />Another problem is the very idea of clinging to the continuity of the earlier films. Let me just say right now that I know the Donner films were not perfect - they tended to suffer from unnecessary camp humor, best personified by Hackman's slumming stand up comedian approach to Lex Luthor, the slow-witted portrayal of Lois Lane, and the fumbling bumbling Clark Kent who wouldn't last five minutes at a burger joint, let alone a metropolitan newspaper. Also, the idea, while interesting, doesn't work because these earlier films are almost 30 years old, making them a bit outdated and probably don't rank as high with the modern audience as they do with Singer. I enjoy those films as much as anyone else, but if you're going to do new Superman films, you might as well give them their own continuity, their own sense of history away from their predecessors. Christopher Nolan recognized that what had worked for Batman during the Burton era no longer worked, and took the necessary steps to breathe life back into the franchise by creating a new continuity with its own sensibilities reflecting changes in both modern cinema and the modern comics. To squander all the potential that could be found and used from the comics in favor of using the old films, a sequel to another man's interpretation, is very misguided, not to mention lazy and uncreative, right down to virtually recreating the same sequences from the Donner film with a little tweaking, like the romantic flight between Superman and Lois, minus the voice over narration, add in Lois taking off her high heels as a symbolism for taking off her clothes for a lovemaking session. While the film never sinks to the painful depths of banality that the Star Wars prequels, Matrix sequels, King Arthur, and all the non-X-Men/Spider-Man films sank too, there's an overall feeling of been there, done that, and Singer's slick, sleek style isn't enough to cover for it. Good intentions he may have had, but this time Singer bit off more than he could chew; perhaps it's time he abandoned the world of pop spectacle film-making and went back to directing films grounded in reality like \\"The Usual Suspects\\". <br /> <br />Adding insult to injury, the very idea of seeing what happens when a hero as important as Superman disappears and then returns could have made for a fascinating film (the idea was also explored in the \\"Kingdom Come\\" miniseries), or chronicling Superman's years in space examining the remnants of Krypton, just as \\"Superman 3\\" could have given serious exploration to what would happen if Superman went evil or how \\"Superman 4\\" could have explored what happens when a hero tackles a political issue of global importance (nuclear warfare). But the film never bothers to give much examination to its own idea - Superman saves the jet and the world falls in love with him all over again as he goes back to doing good deeds, with only Lois clinging to her burning resentment for Superman leaving in the first place and Luthor plotting to get even, never mind the fact that Superman leaving without telling anyone goes against his character. No real examination is given to the individual reactions of the other citizens in the world; they just go on about life as if Superman had never left in the first place. The introduction of Lois's kid and fiancé was also pretty tacky, and Superman, though clearly annoyed, did not display much bitterness or resentment towards his newfound rival (but then again, Superman always did handle his angst better than Spider-Man); very little examination is given to our title character's inner turmoil, his guilt over realizing his own mistakes, etc. We can only imagine how he would respond to the negative reactions of characters who are not Lois or Luthor. Or how he would have responded to coming back to the world and finding that another hero, say Wonder Woman or Captain Marvel, had replaced him as the Guardian of the Earth, the responses of others from this. <br /> <br />Given the thankless task of being the new screen embodiment of the world's most famous hero, Brandon Routh, chosen for no better reason than the fact that he's young, unknown, inexpensive and in the eyes of some vaguely resembles Chris Reeve (he's actually two years younger than Tom Welling, who plays the teenager Clark on \\"Smallville\\"), gives an admirable effort, but despite all his sincerity, he never inhabits the role the same way Reeve did and lacks the heroic aura of Reeve(though Routh's never quite as annoying as Hayden Christensen was as Anakin in the SW prequels). After awhile you desperately want to like him, but Routh's clearly in over his head, most notably in his scenes with Ma Kent (Eva Marie Saint) where he tells her that what he found out there was \\"a graveyard... I'm all that's left\\", and at the end when he tells Lois's kid, who turns out to be Superman's illegitimate son, the same speech that Jor-El gave to the infant Superman in the first film. As stated above, Routh's boyish youth prevents us from really believing that he was missing for five years and had prior experience as Superman. Reeve was also young, but damn it, Reeve looked like a man, whereas Routh is bound to the uber-boyish looks that so many young actors are punished with these days; perhaps if he were 5 or 10 years older, or maybe if the film wasn't mindlessly lashed to the earlier films, Routh's efforts would not appear to be in vain. It's so easy to imagine the aforementioned Jim Caviezel in the same role and bringing in the necessary depth and gravitas to Superman's plights. The washed out costume doesn't do Routh any favors either. <br /> <br />But if Routh comes up short in some areas, he's not nearly as bad in his role as Kate Bosworth is in hers. As stated above, Bosworth is simply too young to be the veteran reporter Lois Lane, or the mother of a five year old boy for that matter (unless we assume she had the kid when she was 17 or 18), and she's such a lightweight that everyone overshadows her. <br /> <br />As the fiancé Richard White, James Marsden, so woefully underused as Cyclops in the X-Men trilogy, displays a gallant, heroic charm that makes it easier to root for him than the title character. Frank Langella and Sam Huntingten are good as Perry White and Jimmy Olsen respectively, and Kevin Spacey, as expected, is an improvement over the Lex given to us by Gene Hackman (himself a fine actor who simply chose the wrong approach), but suffers from a few instances where he is forced to resurrect the campy approach. Luthor's henchman are an embarrassment though - Kitty Kowalski is even more pointless than Eve Teschmacher of the earlier film, and that's saying something, especially considering how bad they made Parker Posey look (she probably would have made a better Lois Lane than Bosworth at any rate).  <br /> <br />Superman deserved better. If this film is remembered as a flop in light of the more popular response to \\"Batman Begins\\"- but will probably be remembered more as a lukewarm/modest success - people will say it's because Batman's a better character than Superman or that people identify more with Batman than with Superman, but that's not the real problem. \\"Batman Begins\\" had a better idea, better writing, better directing, better casting and it shows. <br /> <br />But if it's of any consolation, this film is still better than Catwoman.
B000G759LW|5.0|Songs like \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"Candyman\\" are so fabulous and fun, you can't help but get up and dance.  \\"I Got Trouble\\" truly sounds like a vintage record.  And \\"Save Me From Myself\\" shows a softer side of Christina.  For once she moves away from the constant belting, and gives us something very tender and intimate. <br /> <br />I think that with each album, Christina is really growing and progressing.  This one is great, and I can't wait to hear what she comes up with next time around.  (I just hope we don't have to wait another four years!) <br /> <br />I really recommend giving this album a try.  I think there's a little something for everyone here.
0694524441|4.0|I bought this as a present for my daughter, who loved the book.
0823003590|4.0|It shows you how to draw from the inside out.  The artist does not believe in starting the figure with lines but chariscuro (light and dark).  He says to start of as a gesture drawing and then go in and start working with the shadows, not drawing the shadows and filling them in later, but start filling them with no lines.  He shows you a few steps on how it is done, but he first goes over some basics and some materials.  He talks about some techniques.  If you want a better break down of a more step by step how to, then another book is needed.  I think this book would be for an intermediate to advanced person.  But, the work he does is good, like the Great Masters.<br /><br />Read the book, he is informative and makes you want to give it a try, he just makes you want to draw.  Still not sure - check it out at the library first.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|i just want to help raise the rating on this movie. it wasn't that confusing. i liked it alot...
B00008VGL6|5.0|I can perfectly see, based on the reviews in here, how it works on people - it either gets a 5-star review by an amazed listener or a 1-star review by a person who asks what is this supposed to be. Well, being a DM fan for so many years I can tell that DM fans are so incredibly diverse that I can almost understand such varied reactions.  <br /> <br />This album represents what Martin truly is and I'm sure that there can hardly be any closer expression of himself. I've heard it dozens of times but there's just no way I can get bored with it, it's so unbelievably catchy and profound, so incredibly loaded with emotion that is works like a drug. Those who just don't get it say it's monotone and disappointing and that's just because it's not really an easy listening, you've got to devote your time to really get into it... words just can't explain, I'm not a native english speaker so I can't describe it in such an impressive way. You have to feel this one inside out, this is for people who understand the deepest dimensions of music and once you get it, I'm absolutely sure it'll tremendously reward you and never get away from you. There's just nothing in between - you either understand it or you don't.  <br /> <br />You ask how can it be so much special when considering Martin is the brain of DM? It's extremely irresponsible to state that it's just because he could've done better with this album - those who said it in here could have done much better when they listened to it and made such vague statements about this \\"one-of-a-kind\\" album. My ultimate viewpoint is that after hearing this album I understood that DM is actually the \\"commercially-friendly\\" version of Martin's world and his ideas, although still being so stellar and fantastic to all of us. Although I'm a musician and constantly listen to such a broad spectre of music I must admit that Martin L. Gore is so unbelievably gifted that he can't be denied the spot among the very unique geniuses that this world has ever seen.
B00005JOYM|5.0|This movie show a side that most people never saw. The veiws of two surviors.Image being trap under that mess of distruction.

These men are some of the few who made in out.The movie shows how far down they were bury and what people had to do to get them out.  <br />     My heart goes out to the many of people who responds everyday to help in these helpless encounters to save lives.  These cops are HEROES IN THE HIGHTEST DEGREE.
B000G759LW|5.0|... and with avengance.  She really got into this music.  You can really hear her having fun with her songs with the different styles of singing she uses.  This is her best album yet.  Definitely the album of the summer and hopefully album of the year!  Get it!!!
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I do have to agree, that it is dumb not to like a band because they are mainstream.  That doesn't mean their sound sucks.  But I just don't like this cd because it sounds too much like late 80's/early 90's metal.  I like Waking the Fallen and Sounding the Seventh Trumpet because I like newer metal, especially like Atreyu, As I Lay Dying, and others.  Now I like a lot of different kinds of rock though.  My cd's range from Green Day to Norma Jean.  And yes, I'm 14.
B000065V3H|4.0|I love Can't Buy Me Love! This was one DVD I had to own, simply because I'd worn out our old VHS of it years and years ago. Years before \\"McDreamy,\\" Patrick Dempsey plays Ronald, who like most guys in town, has a thing for Cindy Mancini, the captain of the cheerleaders the prettiest girl in Tucson. The nerdy Ronald is constantly picked on and is tired of being considered a nerd. Wanting his senior year to be more than \\"cards with the tards\\" as his brother Chucky calls it (played wonderfully by Seth Green when he was just a kid), Ronald finds himself in a position to help Cindy out of a predicament. She needs money to replace a suede outfit she borrowed from her mother and ruined, and he needs to be popular. Cindy doesn't think Ronald's plan will work, but she has little choice. She agrees to pretend to be his girlfriend for one month, but not even Ronald expects his plan to go over with such initial success. But soon, things unravel as they tend to do, and Ronald and Cindy both learn a lot from their mistakes. It's a great 80's movie with a wonderful message about being yourself entwined in it. If you grew up in the 80's and you missed Can't Buy Me Love, for shame! Go get it now. It rocks!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The is a tragic but very true to life depiction of the degradation caused by addiction to individuals, families, and society. The film is graphic in its depiction of addiction, but as an addiction counselor, who is an addict and alcoholic in recovery, it is very close to actual tragic events I have seen in the world of addiction. The emotionally disturbing events that take place in the lives of the main characters are exactly the very real things that addiction counselors are seeking to prevent. These events are the end of untreated or unchecked addiction for far too many. Unfortunately, even though some of the content may be offensive to some, it is a starkly true depiction of what the reality for some addicts becomes. Even though the film may leave one emotionally upset for a time, it is a worthwhile film to break through false pretenses about addiction's final results and the glossing over of the degradation addiction can and does lead to in real life. Watch and learn the truth about severe addiction.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera has definitely conquered the sophomore slump with Stripped. This album is my personal favorite album by a singer because its various messages that people can relate to. I have all of Christina's albums and she is always able to raise the bar for other artists. Here is a track by track breakdown of her album. <br /> <br />1. Stripped Intro: A really good intro in which Christina introduces the album to the public. This is one of the few intros that I can tolerate. <br /> <br />2. Can't Hold Us Down [featuring Lil' Kim]: This song was the track that dealt with female empowerment. Christina had some really good vocals on this one and Queen Bee is my favorite rapper so this was like the ultimate collaboration. Plus, although she is talking about females and their strength, I also felt like a guy could reach out and say you can't hold me down for different reasons. <br /> <br />3. Walk Away: A beautiful and long song in which Christina showcases her low vocals for the verses and then showcases them on the choruses.  <br /> <br />4. Fighter: This is one of the songs that immediately drew me to this album because of the message that everyone who has ever wronged her only made her stronger. Love this song! <br /> <br />5. Primor Amor Interlude: This little interlude has Christina doing a Spanish thing for this one. This one is all right.  <br /> <br />6. Infatuation: This track also has a Spanish flavor to it and is a good track to dance to. This is another track that anyone would love to listen to. <br /> <br />7. Loves Embrace Interlude: THE best interlude in the whole wide world. This interlude is so good that I have it on my iPod (and I don't usually have intros/interludes/skits/outros) on my iPod. It has beautiful music and I wish it were longer. <br /> <br />8. Loving Me 4 Me: THE best song on the album and one of the greatest love songs I know. The music sounds beautiful and Christina's vocals are amazing. This is the type of song that you could just close your eyes to it and envision yourself in the situation. It concludes with a beautiful poem. <br /> <br />9. Impossible: This song is also great and Alicia Keys does her thing in the beginning of the song. Once again, Christina sings her heart out. <br /> <br />10. Underappreciated: I love this song because if you're feeling that people don't appreciate you, you can listen to this and make you feel better. <br /> <br />11. Beautiful: Without a doubt, one of the most meaningful songs that I have ever heard. This was one of the first I heard by Christina off the album and was just awesome. I love this song. <br /> <br />12. Make Over: This song is one of my favorites because it's a song that you can listen to when people try to tell you who to be. It's sort of rock like which you can also dance to. <br /> <br />13. Cruz: I didn't like this song at first but it really did grow on me. Christina's vocals just blew me away with this one, listen to this one. <br /> <br />14. Soar: Once again, Christina gives a good message that everyone can spread their wings and fly. I just love this one and is so inspirational. <br /> <br />15. Get Mine, Get Yours: This is the worst song on the album (but not to say that it is bad). This is a good track that shows Miss Aguilera's sexy side. <br /> <br />16. Dirrty [featuring Redman]: The actual dirty song that gave Christina so much controversy. The first single that people can dance to. Christina insists that the song expresses her emotions which I didn't get at first but now I do. I tink that's very clever. <br /> <br />17. Stripped Outro: This is a good outro. \\"Sorry if I ain't perfect, sorry I don't give a (what).\\" I like this one because it's like she's apologizing for all these things people think that she should be.  <br /> <br />18. The Voice Within: The final single off the album and the video was beautiful. The message for this song is that when there is no one else there for you, you can always look inside yourself. <br /> <br />19. I'm OK: This song is Christina recalling her abusive childhood. This song can almost make yuo cry because she shows so much emotion in it.  <br /> <br />20. Keep On Singin' My Song: A good song in which Christina says that she is going to sing her song. This is really a good ending for the album. <br /> <br />Christina Aguilera is one of the best singers in the business. She can sing like Mariah or Whitney; she can make good subject matter that people can relate to; plus she definitely has her looks. You can guarantee that Christina will be here for a long time
B00004UEDQ|5.0|As an addiction counselor, who happens to be an addict and alcoholic in recovery, I found the film to a great depiction of various aspects of addiction. The satirical comedy scenes of the chanting were delightful and depicted the sense of silliness that most addicts or alcoholics see them as at first. The dramatic scenes of withdrawal and attempted suicide are very true. The need to change from an addictive social network to a sober support network is also true. I loved the horse scene at the end where the main character finally got a sense of spiritual victory when she finally submitted to the need for help. This is a film that captures the serious nature of addiction with a hint of humor in a manner that will allow the largest audience to gain insights into addiction and recovery. I am using this film in a family systems approaches in addiction course that I teach at a university. I also use the film in groups to serve as a conversation starter. Watch, laugh, cry, and learn.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This cd is one I will listen to over and over.  Emmy Lou Harris and Mark Knopfler's voices are very harmonious.   It doesn't matter what Mark sings or  who he sings with, he's the GREATEST!!!!
0062502182|2.0|A large number of people recommended this book to me, so I checked out the plot - the quest of a Spanish shepherd to discover a treasure located near the Egyptian Pyramids - and it definitely seemed like something I might be interested in. I looked at the various reviews here on Amazon, and they were overwhelmingly positive, so I went ahead and purchased this book. Sadly, I have to admit that I feel like I wasted my money. The plot is fine, although it seems more like a plot outline than an actual story. If the plot and the characters had actually been developed, it could have made an amazing novel. As it was, the book was less of a novel and more of a pseudo-religious parable. The message of the parable, follow your dreams, is a great message, but I felt as though I were being preached to for 167 pages. I simply cannot recommend this book.
B000CNDIZE|4.0|I bought this cd for the song \\"Breathe Me\\" and there are a few others on the cd that are good.   Breathe Me is happily on the cd three times and I LOVE that song!!  I could listen to the breathy, sexy voice of SIA over and over singing Breathe Me.    Natale is a good song too and a couple of others, but even if the only songs on  the cd was versions of Breathe Me, I would be quite happy!!

A young man gives a hitcher a ride resulting in unremitting, episodic violence as the hitchhiker, played by Rutger Hauer, follows the boy and creates havoc. Violent and terrifying film. Recommended. By the way, this film is head-and-shoulders above the recent remake!!!
B000002I97|5.0|This isn't the first time I have heard this cd.  In fact, I had the album many years ago.   Love all the songs on it.  Prine's lyrics are tremendous and he has a unique quality to his voice.
0385512058|1.0|Most of the text is devoted to tips about how to make yourself as visible as possible to someone more visible than yourself, which ultimately reads as blatently self-promoting and swarmy; a pitiably shallow alternative to the exploration of qualities like service, ingetrity, and energy. There is much more substantial business advice out there on leadership and confidence that truely is the backbone of American commerce and strength. Look into \\"The Secrets of Effective Leadership, A Practical Guide To Success\\" by F.A. Manske, Jr. or any of Dale Carnagie's classics for a solid meal.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|i love all of the songs on this cd..usually you buy a cd and, if you are lucky, you like at least 2-3 songs...but this album is the best...the arrangements are great, the music is great, rihanna is great...love it...
B000G759LW|3.0|I appreciate Aguilera and the fact that she is one of very few pop stars that can actually sing. However, despite the fact that this is her THIRD album, she continues to oversing everything. Honey, we know you can sing already! Don't gimme 50 notes when 1 note will do, ya know? Most of the songs on this album sort of run together with no one song in particular that stands out. The CD does come with an impressive glossy album of Aguilera perfecting the sex kitten look of the eras she's supposedly emulating. In conclusion, I'll give Aguilera props for her vocal abilities but I'm pretty ambivalent about this particular album as a whole.
B000002UA9|5.0|Here's where to start your Beatles CD collection: at the beginning.  This is pre-'Meet the Beatles' Beatles; their first album in England.  Americans now get to collect the English  albums on CD, achieving added freshness and perspective.  This first one features Stephen Hawking's fave Fab Four tune.  You guessed it, 'Please Please Me'.
B000E41MS6|5.0|If you think that watching this new Doctor Who on the Sci-fi channel was adequate or even good, think again.  The DVD contains footage that was chopped out of the Sci-fi showings due to time limitations.  The writing is superior and watching the whole episode as intended (and without commercial interruption) is a huge improvement.  I can't wait for the DVD of the second season.
B00008CLOA|5.0|\\"...It's all dark, really!\\"<br /><br />First of all, I seem to recall that it was always THE Dark Side of the Moon; people just tend to drop that first \\"the.\\"  That's a really niggling detail, however, that I won't dignify any further.  If you're going to nitpick that much, then why bother with this reissue at all?<br /><br />That said, I find this to be the best remaster of this great classic album.  Admittedly, due to overkill on classic rock radio (thanks, or blame, to Clear Channel and their ilk), I can't listen to this album more than once or twice a year.  But what an experience when I do...if ever an album was made for a surround-sound remix, this one is it.  Between Pink Floyd's slow, dreamy/nightmarish grooves and the disembodied voices floating in and out of the mix, it seems inevitable that a SACD 5.1 mix of this album would eventually appear.<br /><br />But you absolutely MUST have an SACD-compatible player to fully appreciate this latest (and hopefully ultimate) remaster--else it's a wash.
B000G03RJA|4.0|\\"The Platinum Collection\\" is an excellent compilation of Laura's career from 1982 - 1990. It contains all of her charting singles from that period along with key album tracks. Unfortunately it does not contain any tracks from her 1993 album [[ASIN:B000WZACZ6 Over My Heart]]. This is a budget title, so the booklet contains only track data, and even a few of the tracks have the wrong year listed.
B0000E64TR|5.0|...and if you're fortunate enough to find it, I recommend buying the version with the bonus DVD, which chronicles the making of Yellow Brick Road.  When I bought it, it cost the same as the 2 SACD set without the DVD, so it was still a great deal.<br /><br />My only complaint--and it's really minor--is that it would have been nice if they could have fit the original album onto a single SACD.  A second disc could have included the bonus tracks that are included in this package, plus any extra--maybe even audio-only interviews--still remaining in the vaults.  No matter.  The important thing, if you are able, is to make sure you have an SACD-compatible player (like the Pioneer DV-563A, or one of the really expensive players if you've got the cash and love audiophile formats in both your hardware and your CDs).  Even if you don't, the stereo CD layer still sounds truly excellent.
B000002LUB|4.0|'Dehumanizer' doesn't seem as well regarded as the previous two Dio-Sabbath albums.  I dunno if I like it as much as those two albums, but it certainly shouldn't be ignored. As many others have mentioned, this has got quite a different sound form their earlier work together, much darker and heavier and doomier, with noticeably angrier vox from Dio. Tonally it's pretty damn monotonous, I'll admit, but the riff writing and vocal lines are memorable enough to carry it.<br /><br />'Computer God' is a solid opener, but the first really notable track is 'After All', which is probably the best song here. It, like most of the best tracks here, combines the best of both worlds, in that it is very atmospheric and doomy for the most part, but it still manages to generate a grasping, melodic chorus. Great song, and genuinely ominous in spite of the silly lyrics. 'TV Crimes' is another fun one, probably the fastest track here and with more great singing from Dio.<br /><br />'Dehumanizer' is a little weird because it crams most of the weaker tracks in the middle, rather than the end. Songs 4-7 are all relatively uninteresting, so they're actually still pretty cool. Not standouts, but good enough that you don't want to skip over them either. 'Master of Insanity' is probably the best of 'em, with a nice catchy chorus and some energetic guitar work. (Particularly for this album, which is frequently pretty plodding, as you'd imagine.)  `Time Machine' is probably the next best of `em, just a rock-solid mid-paced rocker.<br /><br />The album closes with 3 particularly strong tracks. 'Too Late' is a moody, balladish epic. It sounds pretty much like most of the other 1000 moody metal epics you've heard, but it's still a good one. More fantastic singing from Dio, in his older, less harsh style. 'I' is next, and it really should've been the opening track on the album. The most unrelenting, aggressive thing here with the best riffage on the album. It's a bit overwritten, though, with a fairly pointless little clean intro which is repeated later in the song, to even less effect. Still, the core of the song is awesome. 'Buried Alive' is another great one, with a great progression of riffs, moving from heavily muted, grinding riff to a lighter, more sprightly one to the final, simple wall-of-sound power chords that underline the epic chorus. This is another song 'best of both worlds' kinda song, since it moves from the dark, pounding stuff to an immediately memorable, traditionally melodic chorus.<br /><br />Yeah, a cool album. Definitely worth a look for pretty much any metal fan.a fairly pointless little clean intro which is repeated later in the song, to even less effect. Still, the core of the song is awesome.

B000FGGE68|2.0|This movie has excellent cgi, excellent fight sequences, and excellent actors.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have an excellent script.  The dialogue and story were clunky at best and the movie had difficulty in its continuity.  Was it the script or was it the editing?  I don't know but this movie proved that you can't just throw money at something and expect it to be good.  Sorry Mila.  I've loved you in everything else that I've seen you in but this one was UltraBLEEP.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|A classic... enough said. <br />Well, I guess I gave the movie 4 stars because not much footage is from the gym - mostly contest stuff (which isn't all that bad and it keeps the movie interesting with the bodybuilders' pranks and such). <br /> <br />It's definitly worth the money - I think I only paid like $9.98 or something like that. But like I said, it's a classic and it WILL motivate you to pump it up.
B000GGSM7G|3.0|I'd have to agree with one of the other reviewers of The Top in that my review is a bit biased; which is unavoidable since this album did not elicit much more of a response than a shrug of the shoulders from me when I first heard it about 20 years ago. It's the older brother of the equally unstable 1996 release Wild Mood Swings, and listening to the deluxe remaster of The Top only reinforces this for me. Both of these albums lack focus and consistency, and while they each have some flashes of near-brilliance, they never really establish a theme and/or atmosphere for the listener to grab onto. <br />The Top was originally released in May, 1984 and represented yet another line-up change for The Cure (already the seventh in the first six years or so of the band's life). Because of this, it suffers from a lack of clear identity and direction. <br />Robert Smith has claimed in past interviews that he played almost all of the instruments on The Top, in spite of the musician credits listed on the album's sleeve. If that is true, then it makes this an even more confusing effort by a supremely talented, but obviously very unsure, artist. <br />The Top opens with \\"Shake Dog Shake\\", which is a decent enough song, but still a sub-par introduction by a band that has mastered the art of the powerful album opener. Yes, this remastered 2006 edition has a clipped drum intro to the song, but I believe this was an intentional edit. The drum roll sort of fades in for about three seconds before the rest of the music starts. The fact that it fades in would appear to be an intentional revision and not an oversight, in my opinion. <br />The next two songs, \\"Birdmad Girl\\" and \\"Wailing Wall\\" are two of the stronger tracks on the album and are as close as The Top gets to representing that unique and magnificent Cure sound that we all know and love. Along with \\"The Caterpillar\\", they are the only tracks from The Top that have stood the test of time and sound just as good some two decades later. Conversely, \\"Give Me It\\", \\"Dressing Up\\", and \\"Bananafishbones\\" are some of the poorest (and perhaps laziest) efforts in the history of the band. <br />Because of the unclear focus and generally themeless haze of The Top, I feel comfortable in advising that only the more enthusiastic and loyal Cure fan should consider adding this one to their collection. It just does not offer very much to anyone else.  <br />The second disc of mostly home and studio demos provides little help, and is most interesting for the previously unreleased, but none-too-special, handful of offerings. The most interesting of which is the atmospheric \\"Sadacic\\" with one of the more confident vocal tracks by Robert Smith up to that point of his singing career. The live material that closes the disc presents a nice sampling of how the band sounded on stage at the time, and the version of \\"Forever\\" is a particularly worthwhile listen with it's all-too-fitting schizophrenic climax to such a confusing album.  <br />2.5 STARS. <br />
0743454537|4.0|My first novel by Jodi Picoult was The Pact and I was absolutely engrossed. The book was recommended by practically everyone I knew...they were right. I found myself addicted to turning the pages needing to know what would happen.  <br /> <br />I was a bit skeptical when I started reading My Sister's Keeper, a recommendation from my best friend- who absolutely raved about it. This novel did not seem to have intensity of The Pact and I found myself not connecting with the characters. Boy was I wrong! I felt close to the characters, feeling empathetic to each of them. Before I realized, I was half way through and developed the same addiction I had for The Pact.  <br /> <br />Jodi Picoult's novels never cease to surprise her readers. I look forward to exploring more works of my new found favorite author!
B000GGSM76|4.0|Coming out a little over a year after the surprisingly bland offering of The Top, 1985's The Head On The Door was just what the doctor ordered for The Cure. It represented a new vitality and intensity for a band that seemed so lost and unsure over the previous two years before it's release. In addition to unveiling a focused, rejuvenated Cure, the music of THOTD also rang with a new sense of joy and passion, undoubtedly due to the band actually getting along with each other and being on the same page musically. <br />While arguably The Cure's poppiest and most \\"accessible\\" set of songs(certainly to that point anyway), the enigmatic and vivid mystical imagery of Mr. Smith's lyrics remain strong throughout THOTD. This is what makes THOTD such an important step in the Cure's development as a band; while having the necessary elements to attract new fans, they do not lose any of the magic of earlier works that would keep the Cure faithful around as well. Add the huge success of the \\"Inbetween Days\\" and \\"Close To Me\\" videos on MTV following the release of THOTD, and The Cure's rabid following was destined to multiply in number, which it did over the ensuing two years, with America finally catching Cure Fever. <br />As for The Head On The Door's actual songs, it begins with the upbeat \\"Inbetween Days\\" which is a fitting mood setter for the rest of the album with it's bouncy rhythm and layered acoustic guitars. Both the light and the dark are well represented on the album, with plenty of moodiness and self-reflection to go around. The band sounds tighter than ever and looser than ever all at the same time, while Smith's voice is stronger than ever in leading the songs along with noticeable confidence and ease (many of the songs were nailed on the first take, according to the band). <br />There are no weak tracks or fillers here. But songs that stand out as especially good are \\"A Night Like This\\", \\"Close To Me\\", \\"Sinking\\", and \\"Push\\". There's a little something for everyoneon this dish and I'd think this would be a great first album for someone to be introduced to The Cure, before getting into the heavier, more demanding material. <br />The second disc of the Deluxe Remastered edition includes the standard offering of Robert Smith home demos along with a handful of studio demos that document the early stages of development for most of the songs that made the final cut, as well as some outtakes from the sessions. My only complaint with the Deluxe edition is the sacrifice of more live material to make room for all of the demos. Personally, I'd like to hear more live versions of the songs and a little less of the rough edged, two minute instrumental demos that don't really offer anything new. <br />But this is still a fantastic pop record, and an essential piece to The Cure's extraordinary puzzle. <br /> <br />
B00006879E|5.0|Songs About Jane is a unique blend of rock, pop, soul, R&B, and funk. It's got everything which sets it apart from that other stuff on the radio. The sexy, souful lyrics really grab you, \\"Cool these engines, calm these jets, I ask you how hot can it get.\\" I don't know if I have a favorite song because I love the entire CD, although \\"Sunday Morning, Secret, The Sun, Harder to Breathe, Not Coming Home and Sweetest Goodbye stand out. I cannot get enough of this album and I've been listening to it for awhile....
B000002NIW|5.0|Dude! When I discovered this album I was still barely getting into the Deftones and didn't know much about them. The only album I had really heard was White Pony. But damn!!!These guys are hardcore!!Chino could f***ing scream!!! I could listen to this album from beggining to end(as I can with all of them) and never get tired of it EVER!! And obviously it's just as fun to play. This album is probably the hardest out of them all, and if you haven't heard it yet give it a chance. Every song has it's own unique feel to it and is very interesting so F***ING JUST BUY IT!!
B000FS9FCQ|4.0|After anticipating this movie for so long, all of a sudden I found myself not wanting to watch it. I couldn't figure it out: was it the negative press, or the controversy, or the fact that I read the original graphic novel and wasn't that big of a fan of it? I still can't figure it out after watching it actually. It's certainly an admirable film and one that's really easy to like but I found it hard to love. <br /> <br />We're in an Orwellian \\"1984\\"-esque England where the government controls everything, microphones and cameras are everywhere, religious texts are banned and dissenters often disappear. Leading the fight for freedom is V, a man in a mask inspired by Guy Fawkes who dons knives and takes down key members of government and plans to blow up Parliament. With him is Evey, a young woman whose had more than her share of problems who can't figure out whether action does create results, even if said action involves killing and explosions. <br /> <br />Remember how after 9/11, certain songs or movies were kind of banned for awhile? Then there was that Simpsons episode where Homer goes to the Towers looking for a washroom that got taken off the air? Well Vendetta certainly picked a worst(or better, depending on your viewpoint) time to come out since anything involving terrorism gets people up in arms. I find governments have the ability to go deaf at will, oblivious to people's cries for help until they decide action should be taken. Standing in front of a tree once a year and saying the environment is good does not make you an environmentalist. Well, blowing up Parliament or the White House certainly isn't a good idea to create change, it's sad that something of that magnitude in some form has to happen before people realize \\"hey, we ARE getting screwed here!\\" <br /> <br />How is the film? Well, it's got problems really. It starts out fine but then it hits the hour mark and while it doesn't slam on the brakes, the gas is definately running out. I'm not an actionjunkie but I'd like something of substance to happen and unfortunately it just kind of goes. Acting-wise though the film is quite good with Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, the latter being very charismatic even just through voice. But like in Lord of the Rings, I can't help but think he's gonna bust out a \\"Mr. Anderson...\\" at any moment. <br /> <br />Extras-wise it's incredibly disappointing. There was more featurettes on my one disc Serenity then there was on this thing. Expect another release sometime in the future I bet. The film works at the same time for reasons it doesn't but despite the fact the Wachowski Brothers are all over this, it certainly makes up for the last 2 Matrix movies.
B000089RVX|5.0|Best album I've heard in years. Worth every penny. Amy's angelic voice brings out the emotion in every song.
B000067CPX|5.0|I just purchased this cd and I'm a big fan of the Chili Peppers.  I've been buying there cd's since I was 8, but in no particular order, so i haven't really witnessed the gradual change in their style, but now I see it.  The difference in sound between By The Way and Blood Sugar Sex Magic is big, but it's still fantastic music.  In By The Way, there's almost no \\"funk\\"-type music that the Chili Peppers made in their early days.  By The Way contains a more alternative rock-type sound overall, which is by no means a bad thing- RHCP can pull off both sounds.  I LOVE this album. It really shows you their artistic ability to change their sound a little but still stay true to themselves.  If I could I'd give this album 6 stars.
B000002KHH|4.0|This is one of the albums that everyone who listens to rock or metal should own. BTW, Led Zeppelin wasn't the first metal band, Iron Butterfly was. However, when Led Zeppelin came along the two were associated in the minds of pigeonholers, hence \\"metal\\".
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|wow, this movie gets bad reviews from conservatives only???? What are they afraid of? Do they really want to kill gay people and muslims? If not, why would they view a film that portrays a government that does so as an attack to their moral codes? it just puzzles me. Come on, people, this film is great. The main character is the guy we were waiting for while reading 1984.... we just had to wait to see him in a different media, with a similar story. <br /> <br />The film in itself is well shot, mounted, and has a good pace. AND DOES NOT PORTRAY CATHOLICS AS EVIL!!!! Get real, we (catholics) don't go around killing any non-catholic, and, if we were, then we surely would be evil, don't you think?????
0553573411|4.0|I was very suprised at how much I liked the first book, and was eagerly anticipating reading this one. I was not overwhelmed with its greatness, but neither was I let down at the direction the story took. As with the first one, the characters are very interesting, and the plot isnt \\"good guy always wins\\" style, wich I find boring. After 'Assasins Apprentice' I find it hard to believe anyone is doubting to buy this one, but if you are, than have no fear, it will not dissapoint.<br /><br />The only thing different about this from the first book, is that while the first book was only 435 pages packed full of plot and written at a fast pace, this one is around 675 pages and slower paced. The story seems to drag toward the middle of the book. I would rather it had been full of plot and dialouge and been shorter, than have it longer and slower. As far as fantasy novels go in general 700 pages is still not long I suppose.<br /><br />Either way, it is a good read, and an excellent series thus far. I highly recommend it.
0743454529|4.0|I had a minor problem with the product, but it was resolved quickly.  The service was excellent.
B00004W56S|4.0|Originally released in 1980, \\"Smallcreep's Day\\" by Genesis' guitarrist Mike Rutherford sounds a LOT like the solo material his former Genesis colleague, Steve Hackett, was releasing at the time. It has a couple of great moments that almost warrant having the album. But overall, it is not as solid as \\"Duke\\" by Genesis (which was released at about the same time) or even less like Hackett's solo work, which -along with Gabriel's and Collins'- was among the best music to get spun off of the legendary prog band.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Tapestry was one of the first albums in my collection.  Thirty five years later, it is still arguably the best album ever written. In fact, NO collection is complete without Tapestry.  Ms. King's lyrics are full of emotion, and the delivery is incredible.  Clear, pure and soulful, it transcends generations.   Carole can captivate so completely with the haunting 'Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow' and move easily into the toe-tapping 'Smackwater Jack' with ease.  Adding James Taylor to the mix was a touch of genius. His voice and acoustic guitar are the perfect compliment.  I love every song on this album, although the title song is my least favorite, only because it seems out of place on this collection. If I had to choose only one song to keep with me forever, it would be 'A Natural Woman'.  Simple, stirring, with beautiful piano accompaniment, it is impossible not to sing along with this anthem of the 70s.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|With a few options available for you to get your hands on Blondie's greatest hits, and pretty much little new to say about the guys that blended punk and new wave to perfection in their time, the one thing that can be claimed about this compilation is that it's the best one available. It covers pretty much everything you'd want to have by the band and the quality of the recordings is also the best one around.
B00026WU82|5.0|The only album I ever bought with nothing but great songs. <br />From Desolation Row to Like a rolling stone this album is <br />a real pice of americona in the 60's. Great album!
0743454537|5.0|I am usually a crime-fighting, suspense novel reader so I was hesitant on reading My Sister's Keeper.  However, there are no words that describe the utter awesomeness of this novel.  Oh, and what an ending! A true talent at the hand of Jodi Picoult.
B000G759LW|2.0|honestly I wished it was good as stripped, but its not. Christina has a wonderful voice and i still love her and her music but i was let down. I have listened Thur the cds about 6 times now and no song has started to stick out as a Catchy pop top 40 song. I would not expect many singles to come out of this CD. She did a lot of artist creativity stuff and its alright but its not pop or top 40, maybe  thats why no one else does it.  There is to much  \\"in the room\\" audio, meaning while you listening to the CD, some times you fell like your listening to some one else listening to the same cd but you can hear them while the CD pretends to skip to define a beat. There are a lot of songs that sound like Big band, with out the band or limited band. Christine provides most of the \\"music\\" with her voice and the big band is just the drums or beat. The songs that didn't sound like they were big band hip hop mix,  sounded like they were from her holiday cd, same production and sometime similar melodies. <br /> <br />Don't believe all the reviews on here as some sound to perfect, like a marketing slick, may be her agent posted some of these reviews to help sales.  <br /> <br />Note to Christina, Girl you got the voice, you have the looks, your just reaching to far out to try to be a leader in something new and wonderful, and its not that good. Come back into the fold of Top40 and make some more hits.
0375805613|5.0|I grew up reading this classic and read it to my students when I was a teacher (they loved it!). Now as a mother, I read it to my own son who gets such a kick out of this hilarious book. Love it, love it, love it!!!
0451191153|3.0|It's hard not to be swept up in the fervor of The Fountainhead.   It reminds me of the challenge a film professor gave to an anxious audience moments before screening Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda masterpiece \\"Triumph of the Will.\\"  \\"Try not to tap your feet to the music,\\" he said.  I found I could not resist turning the pages of The Fountainhead despite its flaws.  Take the premise.  No one in their right mind should believe that the fate of America rests in the palm of a liberal New York art critic named Ellsworth Toohey who nurtures a conspiracy so broad-reaching that intelligent people will eventually be reduced to a pack of drooling, slack-jawed socialists.  But that is precisely what Ayn Rand proposes.  She believes that you and I are all dolts - idiots - who have succumbed to mediocrity based on altruism.  The hero who can save us is an egotistical architect named Howard Roark.  As heroes go, there is nothing warm and cuddly about Howard.  He doesn't really give a damn what you think about him or if you like him.  Given Howard's prickly disposition, the ludicrous premise on which this book is based, and Ayn Rand's contempt for her readers, why is this book so damn popular?  What gives?  The answer is obvious.  It's a timeless, paranoid fable that grabs at the emotions, negates the intellect, and reduces everything to absolutes.  Perfect in other words for the red-baiting 1950s of Eugene McCarthy or the modern Bush era.  Try not to tap your feet.

B000FSME1A|4.0|My goodness, get a big wheel of cheese out for all the friggin' WHINE we have going on here from so-called Apocalypse Now heads. Yes, it is a terrible tragedy that Hearts of Darkness is not included in this new DVD set. But my word, if you can get over that crime against humanity,  there's a slew of new stuff that blows the lame previous DVD releases away. Excellent featurettes and the deleted scenes that were added here give us a glimpse into what might have been on the so-called bootleg that's a reportedly 5 hours long, which I admit, I've never seen. But still, for any true fan, this new set is excellent. And as one other reviewer said, buy this at Jerk-It City. THey have the exclusive third bonus disc, which I did not even know about until reading the other reviewer here. But when you buy it at Jerk-it City, make sure you see the \\"bonus extra disc\\" sticker on the packaging. Not all of the AN DVDs in the store have the extra disc. The destruction of the Kurtz compound and other snippets are added on the third disc. And I do think the overall packaging of the new edition with the Faux Dossier is clever with the velcro snap shut where the sealing wax is supposed to be. True, this new edition is not completely complete as some fans, including me, would have liked to have seen it. Hearts of Darkness should have been included. And that's the ONLY reason I gave it four stars and not five. And the splitting of the films from one disc to the second was a pretty big blunder, really inexplicable. But I do have a multi-disc DVD player, so it's not as much of a big deal for me. But other than that, there's hours of good stuff here for the greatest film ever made and for any true fan, this is a refreshing edition to the Apocalypse Now lore and the price of $12.99 really is a piece of wisdom from Coppola, who unlike other directors, such as Ridley Scott, are hosing fans for as much as they can milk them for when special editions come out. Surf this DVD, it's a blast. Because you either fight or surf!
B000G759LW|5.0|WOW! <br /> <br />I had hoped that this was as good as Stripped, but when I put it on my cd player yesterday, I found out that it was EVEN BETTER. <br /> <br />What astonished me even more, was when I put on cd number 2 (yes, it's a double cd) and some of the best singing I've ever heard found its way into my ears.  <br /> <br />When I looked inside the booklet, I saw that she had teamed up with Linda Perry for cd number 2. You may remember Linda as the front singer of 4 Non Blondes and she also wrote Beautiful for Christina 4 years ago. I think that Christina and Linda has this powerful chemistry when they work together and everything that comes out of them as a team is pure gold. <br /> <br />I you like Christina, this is a must buy. Or better yet, if you like music, buy this. <br /> <br />
0767827791|3.0|Enjoyable, but not nearly as much as when I saw it in 1955.  Then I fell in love with Kim Novak and admired William Holden.  Of course I was 15 YO old then.  In other words, the movie made me feel old.  Kim Novak was not as pretty as I remebered and William Holden was a little corny (however, I think that he was supposed to be).  I'll watch it again sometime when I am in a good mood!
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is just the beginning of possibly one of the best tv dramedy's (drama/comedy) out there. Even in the 1st season, it showed that it had potential to become a great show. When I first saw an ad for Gilmore Girls one day when I was watching tv, I thought to myself, \\"Oh great. Another feel good show. I'm not going to waste my time with that.\\" I am so glad that I eventually changed my mind and started to watch it. I think that I started watching it when there were reruns on ABC Family since I started on the 1st season. I immediately became hooked. It's amazing how the actors and actresses can talk as fast as they do. Most of the references made go right by me. That's why the Gilmorisms guide that comes with almost all of the DVDs except season 5 comes in handy. I feel that it's better to review the 1st season of Gilmore Girls to start out with at least since that is where it all began. So if you're looking for a good dramedy (if you didn't look at the top, a dramedy is a combination of a drama and a comedy), I highly recommend Gilmore Girls.
B000000W6R|5.0|It's the truth...this album is amazing...I listened to The Greatest Hits first, and when I listened to Pisces Iscariot, I was somewhat surprised that great songs such as \\"Obscured\\" and \\"Starla\\" were not on the Greatest Hits.  Those were two of my favorites on this album. <br /> <br />Anyway....I think Pisces Iscariot is not as heavy as the other Pumpkins albums.  I got this feeling from songs like Soothe, Whir, Blew Away, Obscured, and La Dolly Vita.  However, songs such as Frail & Bedazzled, Pissant, and Hello Kitty Kat are there to offer more variety besides the softness of most of the tracks. <br /> <br />Soothe and Frail & Bedazzled are great opening songs...Soothe is an amazing solo, and Frail & Bedazzled is a great song to bring the listener out of the daydream-like softness of Soothe.  I think Plume is a great song because it describes a day full of boredom...and the tone of the guitars illustrates this too. <br /> <br />Now you're all probably wondering, \\"Why is Obscured your favorite song on the album?\\"  I think it sounds great...I actually listen to Obscured when I'm tired...it's a great mellow song.  And as for Starla, I love how it alternates between heavy and soft sounds over the course of 11 minutes.  Girl Named Sandoz is actually a funny little story about a girl (named Sandoz, obviously...) that turns out to be a little too old... <br /> <br />Blue is another of those alternating songs (like Starla)...one thing I noticed about Spaced, however, was that it sounds exactly like a dream...an atmospheric background with ringing echoes... <br /> <br />Overall, the album was great.  I highly recommend it.
B000G759LW|5.0|CHRISTINA AGUILERA HAS TOTALLY OUT DONE HERSELF WITH THIS AMAZING, MIND-BLOWING ALBUM. B2B IS A CLASSIC ALBUM THAT WAS WELL PRODUCED AND ARRANGED. I HAVE BEEN WAITING 4 YEARS  FOR THIS ALBUM AND CHRISTINA DID NOT DISAPPOINT. HER VOCALS ON EVERY SONG IS STELLAR. SHE IS AMAZING. I HAVE TO AGREE WITH JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE, CHRISTINA IS THE BEST SINGER OF OUR GENERATION AND THIS RECORD PROVES IT. WAY TO GO CHRISTINA, YOU ALWAYS COME OUT ON TOP.
6305079811|5.0|Oi, it's true this has come out on dvd already but, hey it came out on dvd almost ten years ago.  Back then DVD players were around the price of 700 bucks so, this movie was released in a very very small print run...... Here it is 2006 dvd players are 50 bucks and this movie is still not rereleased and ironicly sells more than it cost to buy a dvd player!?!? Whats up with that?????  Why has this great cheesy sci fi film yet to see a reissue or some sort of \\"collectors tin\\" edition just so they can charge 30 bucks. Either way I'd be estatic to see this come out on dvd at a price I could afford!!!  The only thing I could see thats preventing this from being rereleased is the soundtrack royalties...... If so, hey queen please don't be greedy or hey universal don't be cheap on royalties.... I don't know who's at fault but, come on bring this film to dvd again at a price we can afford.... Someone is sitting on this film because it's not even rerunned on some offshoot of a turner network like it was throughout the eighties..... Bring this back to dvd! Flesh Gordon is easily findable on dvd but, not the real movie..... Oh, as for a review of this film this is a movie about a jets quaterback who saves the universe! And in space if one recalls dudes bleed blue blood since theres no oxygen ;) And the soundtrack is one of the best soundtracks made by one band for a movie period. No songs feel forced into the movie... Instead each track flows perfectly with this film.... IE this was made in the day when soundtracks where just that soundtracks to the film. Not some junk to sell a new \\"artist's\\" single like soundtracks are so like today.....
B000001A3H|5.0|Why this is the greatest heavy metal or hard rock album ever released, bar none: <br /> <br />1. Impeccable musicianship.  I defy you to name one band with a better rhythm section than Nick Oliveri and Brant Bjork.   <br /> <br />2. Gargantuan riffs.  Kyuss is twice is ambitious as Black Sabbath and just as gifted when it comes to crafting minor key hooks.   <br /> <br />3. Incredible composition.  Ominous silence, dramatic buildups, explosive thrash carnage and spaced out jam sessions are deployed with precision to evoke the emotional responses that the listener needs to feel he is completely immersed in an all consuming psychic (and psychedelic!) journey.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, every song is informed by the previous and subsequent songs. As a result, the entire album plays as an organic whole, yet does not grow monotonous. <br /> <br />4. A signature sound.  Tune the guitars down to C.  Play them out of bass amps.  Add plenty of fuzz and reverb.  Its brilliant.  The sound is huge.  It just coarses through you like nothing else.  <br /> <br />5. Great attitude.  John Garcia's manly, laid back megalomania is just plain fun.  And his coarse snarl adds a very complementary rough edge to the impeccably precise arrangements crafted by Homme, Oliveri and Bjork.  Listening to Kyuss makes you feel like you're king of the world and you just don't give a... <br /> <br />This is the best album ever.  I hope you buy it and \\"get it\\" the way I do, because it has really opened my mind to how truly inspired a rock band can be.  I literally see music differently than I did before I bought this album.
B00065MDRW|5.0|People talk about how ITCOTCK started it all with prog-rock and all that but that's nonsense. Zappa started prog-rock way back in 1965 with the \\"Freak Out\\" album which, though it didn't sell many copies at the time, was notorious enough to influence the Beatles, who were already leaning towards experimentation due to the influence of LSD, to go all out and make the \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album which in turn influenced everyone else. Zappa was the catalyst, the Beatles were the key and everything else exploded immediately right after. The Beatles legitimized the whole genre even if they didn't go too deep into it. People argue that Pink Floyd made the \\"Piper At The Gates of Dawn\\" album at the same time and in the same studios and yes, that is correct but at that time Floyd was a completely esoteric hip cult band with a limited audience while the Beatles were the single most popular musical group in history. As a result of the Beatles not selling out at the height of their popularity, hundreds of bands felt free to experiment and mushroomed everywhere and made their best albums, Giles, Giles & Fripp & King Crimson included. A great prog-rock band of this period that not too many people give credit to is \\"Caravan.\\" Both their first album & \\"If I Could Do It All Over Again, I'd Do It All Over You\\" appeared before ITCOTCK on the so-called 'Canterbury' scene and are definitely prog-rock and definitely classic though not as well-produced in sonics as ITCOTCK.<br /><br />As far as ITCOTCK is concerned, the HDCD remaster sounds really good for a recording that old. It cranks with excellent bass and drum definition. The album is solid & classic all the way through except for the end of \\"Moonchild\\" which is just silly noodling and too many repetitions of the ITCOTCK chorus in the title song at the end. Fripp did not play the guitar like anyone else at that time as is apparent from \\"Schizoid Man\\" on (the best, most pulverizing version of \\"Schizoid Man\\" for my money is on the \\"NIGHT WATCH\\" double live CD from the 73 Bruford-Wetton-Cross-Fripp band in Amsterdam which you should click over & buy immediately after reading this review).<br /><br />It really boggles the mind how many classic albums where made in the short period between 1968 & 1974. As far as Crimson itself, all their studio albums of this period, except for \\"In the Wake of Poseidon,\\" are CLASSIC with a capital C. ITWOPoseidon is too much of a re-hash of ITCOTCK without the same impact though still an essential purchase for the classic songs \\"Cadence & Cascade\\" & \\"Cat Food.\\" \\"Islands\\" is another one that some people say is weak but maybe that's because they haven't cranked the HDCD remaster out of a good system! I just played \\"Islands\\" three times in a row at maximum volume and let me tell you there isn't a note that I would change on the whole thing. It is a magnificent album, not to mention that it includes \\"Ladies of the Road,\\" the greatest song about groupies ever written. \\"Lizard,\\" \\"Starless & Bible Black,\\" \\"Larks Tongues in Aspic\\" & the final monster album \\"Red,\\" which is easily the best progressive hard-rock album ever made. Wouldn't change a note on any of them.e live CD from the 73 Bruford-Wetton-Cross-Fripp band in Amsterdam which you should click over & buy immediately after reading this review).

B0002W18MU|3.0|Johnny's last CD is that of a very sick man staring death in the face, mourning the loss of his wife, and trying to celebrate parts of his life. On first hearing it, I was disappointed; however, subesquent listening has helped me see the value of his work and the honesty with which he is facing death.  This CD is not for everyone yet everyone should hear it at least once. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00009W0U4|4.0|I'll admit, I was a bit confused when I put the disc into the dvd player and found that the credits rolled through when I pushed play. Odd; perhaps that is they way they do it in France, I thought. Then it donned on me--the title--Irreversible. Very clever, this Noe guy. And in fact, the entire movie tells the story in reverse order. What the viewer experiences is the climax, in all of its brutal ugliness, first, followed by the events that lead up to it, and along the way, the viewer becomes aware of the complexity of emotions, actions and relationships between the main characters. <br /> <br />Having heard of Noe's other works, including \\"I Stand Alone,\\" I wondered if his true fascination lies with violence and shock value because \\"Irreversible\\" contains incredibly graphic violence (some of it sexual) that would no doubt please the hardest of the hardcore gore hounds. But, this reviewer does not think it is Noe's only fascination.  <br /> <br />There is more to Noe's method than just madness. The rape scene is indeed one of the longest, but, after the dizzying violence (literally--the camera panning is a little annoying), the story surfaces.  Despite the subtle character development, Noe effectively pulls the viewer into a feeling of intimacy shared with the two lovers.  The graphic and brutally intense scenes become memories off somewhere in the distance--the writing is already on the wall and \\"future\\" events cannot be changed.  This churns one's stomach even more than the violence witnessed early on.  In fact, the last scene--as simple as it is--may be Noe's most effective and artistic, as this theme truly resonates with the viewer and transcends all of the ugliness.  <br /> <br />I can say I recommend this film, but be warned, its not easy to watch. It is not for the easily offended, weak at heart and *definitely* not for children
B000G759LW|3.0|So I'm going to say basically the same thing as the other reviewers. This album is one that takes a while to actually get into. With Christina claiming that this was more of a old school record with a sort of twist I went into buying this record picturing more of the Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong sounds that I love and that she said she had. Unfortunately it didn't have the old school sound I expected let alone more upbeat fun songs like \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" featured amongst the songs on the record.Most of the songs are ballads which is fine but once again its harder I think to get into a record like that but the best song on the album has to be \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" that song alone was my main reason for buying this album and now I have to continue listening to the album to figure out what other song I actually like. But I don't find this album a waste of money because it is pretty decent just not what I expected.
B000G759LW|2.0|I've been following Xtina's career for a while because vocally, she is the best of the pop singers.  As a TRUE fan of old soul, funk, jazz, blues, gospel and (to a lesser extent) modern R&B, I have heard her straining to incorporate these styles into her music.  I have chalked it up to her young age and to the people in the business who were exploiting her and never took the time to properly critique her.  But it was my hope that with her maturing age and working with more seasoned musicians that she would show some growth stylistically.  Boy was I wrong! <br /> <br />This CD - a supposed shout out to the soul legends of days gone by, is really just a shout out to a twentysomething wannabe who is a talented singer but not a talented artist.  Like her fellow wannabe, Mariah Carey, she never veers far enough from her self-absorption and obessession with the sound of her own voice to connect with the music and lyrics and truly deliver.  She seems more to be inviting us to sit quietly and be impressed by what her voice can do than to include us in an interactive give and take of artist, art, and audience.  Her music does not move nor does it inspire.  And the arrogance it takes to put herself in the company of greats is amazing.  She is NO Aretha.  She is NO Marvin Gaye.  She is NO Ella Fitgerald.  She is a shark in a pond of guppies that calls itself a whale.  In fact she is not a true representative of soul music at all - screaming, running every note, and oversinging does not make one a real soul singer any more than a dress, high heels, and too much makeup make a drag queen a real woman.  This is what she is - a drag singer referencing a genre that she will NEVER truly occupy.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|music died a little with the release of this album. i read some  comments wherein people have the audacity to suggest that this garbage de jour is actually good--no! great music. please just crawl into a hole and remain there. you'd think with such an absolutely moronic band name like panic (exclamation point!!!) at the dico and equally moronic asinine song titles people would have the sense to avoid such trash. instead i see woww great stuff to dance to....and \\"its rare too see a band with such mature and profound lyrics\\" or something like that. emo (and this band) are devoid of anything resembling creativity sincerity or originality. warbly falsetto vocals typical guitar riffs drum machine trite synth lines its all here. please read pitchforks review- it made me laugh. whos up for a trip to hot topic and  then a good cry over those pesky highschool crushes? meeee! oo nice bangs.
0735619670|5.0|As the title specifies, this book is COMPLETE, yes, sometimes is too generic, but I'm impress of the amount of information it contains. Very well organized, I recommend to read it and then keep it as reference (it contains a lot of information links as well to keep improving)
B00007KWHN|5.0|THE BAND: Jon Anderson (vocals & percussion), Steve Howe (guitars), Chris Squire (bass), Tony Kaye (piano/organ/moog), Bill Bruford (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1971) Originally 6 songs clocking in at approximately 42 minutes, this digitally remastered (2003) edition adds 3 bonus tracks and lasts just over 52 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing song credits/titles, song lyrics, band photos, and singles released. This is the band's 3rd album. Recorded at Advision Studios, London. Originally released on Atlantic's label, this reissue released on Elektra by Rhino.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Indicated in the liner notes - this album needed to attract a much larger audience, or their label (Atlantic) was going to drop them. I'd say YES responded to the challenge. Original guitarist Peter Banks was out. Enter the new - Steve Howe. What a difference one player can make. Where the first two YES albums took on a very experimental psychedelic feel, Howe's playing and writing led them into the progressive rock arena. Listen to Howe's solo on \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" and perhaps you'll see what I mean (\\"Can a song really rock and yet also be beautiful?\\"). I also have to note Kaye's Hammond B3 organ - a solid backbone in many of the songs here. Bruford's drumming, as always, is complex and varied, and proving in some spots that less IS more. Classic YES songs include the 9 minute opener \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", the 3-part \\"Starship Trooper\\" (the best song on the album and one of their finest in their entire catalog), and the 2-part \\"I've Seen All Good People\\"... all 3 of these songs featured on many of their compilation discs. The remaining 3 songs are deep album gems - including Steve Howe's acoustic live recording \\"Clap\\", \\"A Venture\\", and the heavily underrated 8 minute album closer \\"Perpetual Change\\" (this song never got its due). The bonus tracks are adequate fare - single version sections of longer songs here \\"Your Move\\" (from \\"I've Seen All Good People\\"), \\"Life Seeker\\" (from \\"Starship Trooper\\"), and the studio version of Howe's \\"Clap\\". The remastered sound is crisp. YES has many a classic album - and I rank \\"The Yes Album\\" 2nd - closely behind 1972's \\"Fragile\\" (and slightly ahead of \\"Close To The Edge\\"). Classic disc (5 stars).), \\"Life Seeker\\" (from \\"Starship Trooper\\"), and the studio version of Howe's \\"Clap\\". The remastered sound is crisp. YES has many a classic album - and I rank \\"The Yes Album\\" 2nd - closely behind 1972's \\"Fragile\\" (and slightly ahead of \\"Close To The Edge\\"). Classic disc (5 stars).

B00005JOYM|2.0|The problem with making a movie about 9/11 so soon after the real event is not that the pain is still palpable but that the movie must invariably censored.  Such is the case with World Trade Center.  Certainly, there is nothing entertaining about what went on that day in 2001.  Certainly, to think about it is heart-wrenching.  Certainly, to visualize it is even worse.  But, in the creation of a film about this event, to censor certain images is to neglect the full scope of that disastrous event.  Regrettably, Oliver Stone takes the safe road.  He teases the audience with images of the disaster but never has courage enough to show us the actual event.  Would an image like that be something the audience would enjoy seeing?  Hopefully not, but that doesn't mean it is something that they shouldn't see. <br /> <br />The film must be compared to Paul Greengrass's United 93, a film that was so burdened by its bare-bones realism that it alienated its audience.  However, at least the title of United 93 accurately boasted its subject matter: it was not a film about the twin towers or terrorists or anything else besides a plane crashing in Pennsylvania.  In this case, the World Trade Center fails, for it is not, in fact, a film about the World Trade Center but about to port authority officers and their families.  The true and full story of the world trade center will someday be made into a film, and it will detail more accurately the terrorist attack, the rescue operation, and the resulting backlash.  This is not that film.  In fact, Stone, in an uncharacteristic fit of prudence, seems to have gone to great lengths to avoid offending anyone, and thus left us with the empty husk of a half-finished film. <br /> <br />The technical components of the film are all satisfactory.  The actors are adequate and the script does everything it should.  But that might be the main problem.  This falls under the category of a disaster film more than a historical record.  It follows all of theformulas of other disaster films and, if anything, achieves even less for its sheltered, myopic view of the catastrophe.  At least when a disaster film depicts a boat sinking/plane crashing/building falling/storm striking/volcano erupting/etc., it has the decency to help us experience the full event.  In ten years, Oliver Stone might be able to make a pretty decent 9/11 film. <br />
B000G759LW|5.0|'Back to Basics' is Christina Aguilera's first release in four years and I must say, after all the hype and anticipation...this album does NOT disappoint.  It is without a doubt the most original album of at least the last six years.  Christina laces every track with a jazz beat and puts her beautiful, powerful voice on top of it.   <br /> <br />'Back to Basics' is perfect from start to finish, in my opinion.  Not one bad track on either disc.  And easily Ms. Aguilera's best album thus far, although I love all her work.  Do not hesitate to purchase 'Back to Basics' - Album of the Year!

0425129616|4.0|As World War I rages, Captain Arthur Hastings, late of the British Army, has come to an Essex estate to visit a friend.  Within a night of his arrival, the matriarch of the family is dead, locked in her room.  Arsenic poisoning is determined to be the cause.  But, was she murdered?  And if so, which of the many people who inhabit the estate is the guilty party?  Her thoroughly hated second husband?  Her spendthrift step-son?  Her niece, a nurse with access to all manner of poisons?  While Hastings considers himself an amateur sleuth, he soon learns that one Hercule Poirot, formerly a detective in Belgium, has taken refuge down the road.  Poirot, one of the most gifted minds in the amateur detective business, takes on \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles.\\" <br /> <br />So begins Agatha Christie's first novel.  This is the second of her novels I have read, the first being \\"And Then There Were None.\\"  Since I've read only two, it's hard not to compare them, even if it's unfair to do so.  \\"And Then There Were None\\" was written many years and many books after \\"Mysterious Affair,\\" so it is naturally a more polished and confident book. <br /> <br />This isn't to say \\"Mysterious Affair\\" is a bad book.  It's not.  It is actually quite enjoyable.  The mystery is compelling, as there are so many suspects, all of whom have any number of motives.  As suspects are eliminated for their alibis or lack of evidence, Poirot and Hastings find themselves faced with choices that make very little sense, or are flat-out impossible.  However, Christie never writes the proceedings in a way that makes the reader feel the sense of urgency the characters feel.  The mystery is intriguing, but there isn't any sense of danger to the well-being of Poirot or Hastings. <br /> <br />Poirot and Hastings as characters happily make a huge difference.  In a way, it's their rather flawed natures that make them enjoyable.  Hastings, quite vain about his abilities, is actually rather obtuse when it comes to actual sleuthing.  In contrast, Poirot is extremely capable, and never lets the readers or the characters in the book forget how gifted his \\"little grey cells\\" truly are.  Granted, Poirot if legitimately gifted.  He just isn't always easily suffered. <br /> <br />While not a \\"gripping\\" or \\"suspenseful\\" read, \\"The Mysterious Affair at Styles\\" is an entertaining one.  I certainly am excited by the prospect of working my way through the Poirot series, getting to novels were Christie really made her mark.
B000002MP2|5.0|So the name Dookie, a slang for the term faeces, couldn't be a more funny title for the album! <br /> <br />This was the second GD album I brought after American Idiot, and immediatley I liked Dookie more, it sounds much less mainstream. <br /> <br />1. Burnout - A brilliant start to Dookie, with catchy lyrics, \\"I'm not growing up, I'm just Burning Out,\\" a pretty cool drum solo halfway through the song as well. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. Having a Blast - Cools the mood down a little bit after Burnout, but still a pretty good song, especially to listen to when you are feeling angry. 7/10 + <br /> <br />3. Chump - An excellent song, talking about Billie Joe's hatred towards the boyfriend of a girl he likes, the end of the song is very good how it just flows into Longview. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Longview - One of Dookie's signature tracks, a cool bass line, the lyrics mean a lot to me as well, and when the sound of the lead guitar hits you, you will be amazed! 10/10 + <br /> <br />5. Welcome to Paradise - Yet another brilliant song, about how Billie Joe left home, hated it at first and then grew to love living in the punk scene. I also love the guitar riff. 10/10 <br /> <br />6. Pulling Teeth - Probably the weakest track on the album so far, but it is still good in a different kind of way. 7/10 <br /> <br />7. Basket Case - Dookie's second signature track, about Billie Joe's panic disorder. I am addicted to this song, anyone (apart from R&B enthusiasists) could grow to love Green Day alone. 10/10 + <br /> <br />8. She - Not able to reach Basket Case's standards, but again a pretty damn good song, and sort of relevant to me being confused about girls. 9/10 <br /> <br />9. Sassafras Roots - A good song, also relevant to a relationship, but a little repetitive. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. When I Come Around - Some might say it sounds like a pop song, but I love it!! Sort of a love sick song, a good bass line, and some smart lyrics! 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Coming Clean - A strange song,about someone who is in the closet. Has a good punk sound to it, short but sweet. 9/10 <br /> <br />12. Emenius Sleepus - About someone who hasn't seen a friend of theirs in ages, meets up with them again, only to find out that they have changed, for the worse. Squeezes a lot of meaning to it in such a short space of time. 8/10 + <br /> <br />13. In the End - I don't like this song as much, I don't know why but it seems like it doesn't fit in to the album. Pretty average and boring. 5/10 <br /> <br />14. F.O.D./All by Myself - I love this song! Acoustic and quiet vocals to begin with, and after about one and a half minutes, kicks off in to a very agressive ending to the album. It is about hating a backstabber. 10/10 <br />I normally switch the CD off before All By Myself because I don't really think it is worth the wait. <br /> <br />Overall, a magnificent album which I would recommend to anyone who actually appreciates people who write their own songs, do a great job of singing them, and play their own instruments, unlike R&B (cough) 5/5
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|A co-worker loaned this to me and said it was a really good movie. So last Thursday, I sat down to watch it, not knowing what to expect and whether or not I would even like it. <br /> <br />I watched it 2 more times in the follwing 3 days. <br /> <br />This is quite simply one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. The not-too-subtle political statements are well said without being preachy. All the political angles have been covered ad nauseum. Suffice it to say, you will either love or hate it, depending on whether you are left or right of the center line. <br /> <br />All the actors were excellent, but Hugo Weaving's V stole the show. Despite being behind a mask for the entire movie, his body language was so expressive that the audience can't help but be drawn in to root for this \\"guy\\". His V is at once angry, bitter, vengeful, but also righteous, decent, gentlemanly and above all... tender. <br /> <br />Both Evey and V grow throughout the movie, each learning from the other that right and wrong is not so clear cut as they originally thought, eventually coming to the realization that they alone cannot make choices for anyone other than themselves. <br /> <br />Like all good love stories, this one is heart-breaking. The moment near the end, when Evey and V finally share a tender moment, Hugo Weaving's touching performance conveys the depth of the longing that V has for Evey. The audience can actually feel V's momentary indulgence, considering abandoning his plans for vengeance in favor of a life that he never thought he would have. It was just brilliant. <br /> <br />This is a must have for my collection.
B000G759LW|5.0|Being a singer myself, I can truly appreciate Christina Aguilera's voice.  Being a musician, I can appreciate the arrangements and mix of the old jazz, blues, and soul with modern beats that \\"Back to Basics\\" utilizes.  I am very glad I bought the CD, but there are a few songs I will not be uploading to my iPod.    DISC 1  1. Intro (Back to Basics) -- This is a pretty long intro song that is worth listening to.  The lyrics basically explain why Christina made this kind of CD.  Very R&Bish.  I like it.  It was iPod worthy.    2. Makes Me Wanna Pray -- There is this driving beat in this song that is very gospel, complete with the choir.  Throughout these CDs, older people may not enjoy the \\"cracking\\" from the old records (they feel like someone hasn't taken care of them properly!).  I, on the other hand, like it.  This particular song is very enjoyable and I put it on my iPod for sure!    3. Back in the Day -- You know that 70's distorted guitar?  Yeah, it exists here.  This song, much like the intro, explains what's going on on these CDs.  I think it's funny how \\"Coltrane\\" is rhymed with \\"Soul Train.\\"  But this is a pretty good song, so it's on my iPod.    4. Ain't No Other Man -- Ah, yes.  The first single.  The first song I ever heard from this new album.  This is the reason I bought the CD.  It is extremely catchy and the lyrics aren't incredibly idiotic.  If you wanna hear this song, watch the video on MTV if you can.  This, of course, is iPod-y.    5. Understand -- One of those ballads with a beat.  The chorus mostly consists of one of the old-time great women singing (I have no idea who it is, sorry), the chorus repeating, and Christina doing her ad-libby thing over.  At times this gets a little grating because it's too busy.  The song itself is not too bad, though, and I do enjoy it mostly.  iPodded.    6. Slow Down Baby -- Typical Christina sound.  There is a sound clip that is continually utilized with a guy saying \\"Stop, slow down baby\\" every once in a while.  It's not too obnoxious and works with it.  I do like this song.  I really appreciate how you can tell what Christina is saying.  I'm getting tired of many bands and artists who are mumblers and don't overpronounce the consonants!  It's on my iPod.    7. Oh Mother -- The piano track.  It is a very pretty song.  The music box part adds a lot.  The lyrics are bittersweet because they speak of abuse, but they also speak of how they have survived.  When the strings come in in the bridge, it's very powerful.  On the iPod.    8. F.U.S.S. (Interlude) -- This short song thing sounds very much to me like dark Stevie Wonder-y.  *ahem*  I know what the acronym stands for, but it's not appropriate to post.  But the song's not too bad.  It's on the iPod.    9. On Our Way -- The beginning of this song may be very irritating with the constant \\"record problems,\\" but once it gets going, it's not a bad song with the tasty string section.  This isn't the most spectacular song to me, but it is nice to listen to, so it is on my iPod.    10. Without You -- Spanish guitar!  Well, not entirely, but hey, that Stevie Wonder sound again.  It's like that only beatier.  This is a refreshing song.  On the iPod as well.    11. Still Dirrty -- Hmmm... well, yeah.  I like the crazy background and the \\"message\\" in the lyrics is... interesting.  I was not fond of her original Dirrty on the Stripped album or the other raunchy songs.  I like this song but I don't like this song.  With this mixed feeling, I still put it on my iPod.  But I don't \\"got the nasty in me.\\"    12. Here to Stay -- After the last song, this is SO much better!  Very 70's again.  The lyrics are pretty sweet.  It's basically a women-empowerment song, which is kinda cool and one thing I really like about Christina Aguilera. iPodded.    13. Thank You (Dedictaion to the Fans...) -- Ugh.  Well, yeah.  Okay, so I really like how Christina put in a song dedicated to her fans (complete with clips of people thanking Christina for makingmusic), but I really HATE this song.  This is NOT on the iPod.  If the clips of people were not on the track, I might have liked it.  But I will not listen to this song more than once.    DISC 2  1. Enter the Circus -- The circusy-background is interesting, but Christina doesn't sing on this track.  The choir \\"la la la la la la la\\"ing isn't worth putting this track on the iPod.  It's not a bad song, but it's not really a song.  The announcer guy is kinda annoying and the only saving grace is the choir la la-ing.    2. Welcome -- Ah, strings!!  I'm kind of obsessed with the rock/string mixture, so this song is really cool to me.  It's a good song that is on the iPod.  Mmm... strings.  This is a short song, but it is sweet.    3. Candyman -- *ahem* Well, first of all, you'll notice the swing danciness (big bandiness) of this track.  I have recently taken a swing dance class, so I was excited when I heard this track (\\"Something to dance to!\\"), but then heard the lyrics and was less happy...  The singing is so very Andrews Sisters, but they're not talking about a Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy...  This is on the iPod only because of the swing danciness.    4. Nasty Naughty Boy -- I guess she is still dirrty.  This is the burlesque number.  Think \\"Hey Big Spender\\" with lap dancer lyrics.  I don't like this song because I don't like those kinds of songs.  This is not on the iPod.    5. I Got Trouble -- Recorded in the old-timey way, complete with old microphone, this almost sounds like it comes from the 30s.  This is a standard blues track and she sings it very well.  iPod-y goodness.    6. Hurt -- So sad!  The melody is nice.  Again, the strings are present and the lyrics are not horrible, so this is on the iPod.  This song really showcases Christina's vocal dynamics.  I like it.    7. Mercy on Me -- The gospel sound comes back in this track.  Almost sounds like a spiritual as it kind of reminds me of \\"Follow the Drinkin' Gourd\\" when it's done kinda bluesy.  Strings!!  Okay, Ireally like this song.  You guessed it: it's on the iPod.    8. Save Me from Myself -- Another sad but pretty song.  For some reason, this song reminds me of \\"You Must Love Me\\" from \\"Evita.\\"  In fact, the lyrics are similar...  Christina sings so sweetly on this track and shows that she doesn't have to belt out everything to be effective.  While her short stature (I can relate) does make her belting very impressive and it is good, this sweet singing is very nice.  iPod.    9. The Right Man -- Yay!  Strings!  For some reason, this song makes me think like it belongs in a musical even though it was more likely written this way because it's like Pachebel's Canon in D or the other typical wedding music.  This song is about marrying the right man.  No beat in this song, but it really doesn't require a beat.  The choir comes in and goes crazy in the good way during the bridge.  Definitely on the iPod.    Overall, I do enjoy so many of the songs.  I have been a Christina fan for awhile now, so hopefully this review helps you make your decision.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina latest album in four years is well worth the wait. It has everything for everyone. THe first CD is composed of faster songs but the second album is byfar my favorite with great ballads and my favorite song Save me From Myself. There is honestly not a bad song on this album. Christina did her thing and God forbid she doesn't make an album with top 22 top 40 songs, like anybody actually does. There is definitely something for everyone on this album and everyone should pick up a copy ASAP.
B000G759LW|3.0|First off, Christina is incredible, there's no denying it. The problem does not rely in her lack of chops...it relies on the way she uses them and her persona. <br /> <br />With this album, Christina once again changes persona from the ghetto talking X-tina, to classy jazz diva...*what!?* Quite a change, yes? Well, Madonna did this sorta thing all the time. The thing with Madonna was, she never took any of her personas too seriously. They were just her marketing gimmick. Christina is way too self-important to use all of these personas. She takes herslef way too seriously which kind of hurts her likability. She went from cute teen who worshipped Mariah and Whitney, to hot Latina who was *totally* connectected with her Latin roots, to ghetto X-tina who preached the gospel of hip hop, and now jazzy diva who grew up on jazz and soul? Ecclectic, yes. Confusing and somewhat unbelievable....just a bit. I doubt she was seven years old and jamming to Billie Holiday.  <br /> <br />Now to the music. A few decent tracks, but waaay too much filler. She is obviosuly inspired by her recent marriage and that's great. She seems to revist certain subjects from \\"Stripped\\" such as the abuse her and her mother suffered at the hands of her father. *deja vu?* The music overall is ambitious, yet obvious in that fact that she is trying waaay too hard to garner critical acclaim for the whole retro aspect. <br /> <br />In closing...Christina tries way too hard. She can sing, yet oversings until the cows come home. She seems to reject her past personas with each one she takes claiming \\"that wasn't me.\\" Bi-polar anyone? Christina claims that she is finally letting her inner creativity forth...yet I still think she's a prisoner of trying to be cool.

B000001FTD|5.0|<br />Everything thrash metal should be dark, fast, heavy, brutal!!! Anthrax is truley up there with old Metallica and Megadeth. Really awsome stuff, while in my opinion not as good as Persistence Of Time, still a true classic MUST HAVE for any true metal fan. Dosin't get much better than this. Anthrax really brings the sound of thrash!!
B000FSME1A|1.0|I own all 3 apocalypse now's (original, redux, and this) <br /> <br />I must say that I have become more and more disappointed as I went down the line.  <br /> <br />Original version (1979) on DVD contains everything that was meant to be there, just no impressive multimedia or extras. <br /> <br />Redux came along and made some desirable but mostly undesirable tweaks to the original. <br /> <br />THE VERSION YOU ARE BUYING is in my mind a total rip off to anyone who owns the redux and or original!!! <br /> <br />I advise anyone who doesn't own apocalyse now on dvd to go ahead and buy it, BUT IF YOU DO OWN THEM save your money!!!
0375831002|5.0|I'm going into eighth grade this year.  The books I usually read are fantasy, like Harry Potter.  But I found this on a shelf in my library one day and checked it out.  What I found was a book so deep that it was one that really went down in my mind.  One thing that really stands out was the narrator, Death.  It was so unique for me, and I really like the idea Mr. Zusak gave about how our souls would be picked up by Death.  I like how he gives the view of how the Jews were treated during that time and how some people, like Hans Huberman, must have at least tried to help them.  <br /> <br />I reccomend this to any one who has an open mind.  You can really understand it when you imagine yourself in Leisel's shoes because the descriptions are so amazing it is possible to find yourself walking on Himmel Street. <br /> <br />
B00000099Y|5.0|And peel back the layers of Aenima with each listen. Then truly understand this for what it is. Musically, conceptually, artistically, visually, a masterpiece.
0920668372|4.0|My husband and I received this book as a gift for us and our daughter (we have a 7 month old girl)...initially, we both cried when we read it together (I had heard about the book from friends but never actually took the time to check it out). Our mothers are older and the story really touched us. However, in looking at the book again, I can see why some might be creeped out by certain things, like the mother crawling into her son's room and rocking him back and forth after she's sure that he's sound asleep, especially when he's older (and I'm talking about a grown man here). I kind of wondered if my own Mother-In-Law did the same thing, would I EVER be freaked out...I'd be like, \\"OK, nice knowin' ya...enjoy each other...bye-bye now\\" LOL I kind of even put a black humor into reading it, like the son is Norman Bates (the mother in the book has that \\"granny\\" hairdo and old-fashioned dress) and it made me laugh, although I'm weird that way anyhow. In any case, don't speculate too much (I'm one to talk) over the book...it's not meant for it -I personally won't be reading it to my daughter until she's older and fully understands the concept of aging and death or using it as a teaching tool when I think that she's ready to learn about it.
B000G759LW|2.0|Okay, so Christina's back with a 2-Disc album. I listened to it and I wasn't impressed. I love blue-eyed soul music, but this album has no soul and everything sounds forced and pre-packaged. I didn't see anything exciting about this album and while the album is different from what other people are doing in 2006, it's nothing innovative. A lot of name dropping of old school artists just to show that's she's down with the R&B thang. Basically, \\"Back to Basics\\" is a pop album with jazz and R&B influence, which has already been done before. Madonna did it back in 1992 with \\"Erotica,\\" and it was excellent.  But \\"Back to Basics\\" is no big deal and the songs go through one ear and out the other. Xtina still oversings with her \\"yeah yeah yeah yeah\\" and her \\"oooooooooooooooooooo uuuuuuuuuuuu OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO\\". Will the real Christina ever stand up? No, because she's still imitating Whitney Houston and in order to get that Whitney sound Xtina always makes her voice sound really deep, like she's about to cough up something from her throat. It makes her voice sound strained. If Christina wants to be R&B, then that's what she should be and I would respect her. But for Xtina to switch genres completely would mean losing her mainstream audience, and that's why everyone is going pop these days because that's where the money is. I'll giver Xtina credit, at least she didn't have any rappers on this album. But like I said, I'd rather listen to Joss Stone because at least she wants to do soul/R&B. Skip this latest album by Xtina at all costs and get anything by Teena Marie who most of you probably don't even know.
B000002MU3|4.0|Wow, I have just started listening to REM maybe a few weeks ago. I know I missed the main stream times when they were extremely popular but who cares. I started off listening to songs off of their greatest hits cd and I was blown away by some of them like Pop Song 89 and The Great Beyond. So I started digging deeper to find better material and then I found Monster. I haven't heard everything from REM yet, but so far Monster is by far my favorite cd from them with songs like Crush with Eyeliner, King of Comedy and Circus Envy. This is truly a unique band.
B000BKVQTS|3.0|Renowned director/screenwriter, Terry Gilliam, brought the tale, featuring the two legendary authors, Jacob (Heath Ledger) and Wilhelm (Matt Damon) Grimm, to the screen in 2005's \\"The Brothers Grimm\\".   <br /> <br />The movie starts by introducing us to the brothers as young children in the late 1700s when it's discovered that Jacob, (played by Jeremy Robson in this scene) has sold the family's cow for a handful of magic beans.  Several years later the two brothers have grown into men who travel from town to town throughout Germany getting rid of unsavory creatures who seem to be plaguing the towns.  However, it's soon realized that the pair, along with a couple of friends, are con artists who have constructed everything from the evil characters (in one case a witch) to the elaborate \\"rescue\\" of the town. <br /> <br />Napoleon's General, Delatombe, (Jonathan Pryce) is not pleased.  When he threatens to execute the two brothers, Jacob and Wilhelm have no choice but to travel to Marbaden and solve the mystery behind the disappearance of several of the village's children.  With Cavaldi (Peter Stormare), one of Delatombe's henchmen, to keep an eye on them, the brothers meet Angelika (Lena Headley), who agrees to escort them into the nearby forest.  The group soon finds the tower that legend says is home to the Mirror Queen (Monica Bellucci) and who has great powers over the forest.  But is the legend true?  What other secrets does the forest hold and how do they connect to the disappearance of the children? <br /> <br />Terry Gilliam has directed and/or co-wrote a number of films including \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" (1998), \\"Brazil\\" (1985), \\"Time Bandits\\" (1981) and several of the Monty Python features.  \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" was one of those films that I had high hopes for and really wanted to like it a lot.  However, the movie, while good in some parts, seems to be lacking in others. <br /> <br />There were two things I especially liked about \\"The Brothers Grimm\\".  The film was visually appealing.  The way it was shot was reminiscent of \\"Sleepy Hollow\\".  I also liked the way that familiar stories from the Grimm brothers were incorporated into the movie; for example \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\", \\"Little Red Riding Hood\\" and a little bit of \\"Hansel and Gretel\\". <br /> <br />The idea of the two Grimm brothers as con artists traveling from town to town, swindling people out of their money by exorcising fake creatures, until they come across the real thing was great.  Unfortunately, the movie seems to stray from this and eventually gets scattered in several directions with the brothers in situations with Delatombe, Cavaldi and the Mirror Queen as well as a side story about Angelika and her family.  Don't be surprised if you find yourself exhausted from trying to keep up with everything that's going on!  (You wouldn't believe how hard it was coming up with the movie summary above!) <br /> <br />I did like Heath Ledger's and Matt Damon's take on the two brothers.  But I felt that the characters could have been developed more.  We really don't get to know a lot about them.  Perhaps a little more insight into their backgrounds would have made the characters more compelling.  Also the possible romance with Angelika just didn't go anywhere. <br /> <br />While I have liked Jonathan Pryce's and Peter Stormare's previous works (Pryce was Governor Swann in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" (2003) and Stormare appeared in \\"Chocolat\\" (2000) and \\"Armageddon\\" (1998)), I felt their characters were somewhat shallow, bordering on annoying.  A lot of screen time also isn't given to the evil Mirror Queen who is supposed to be the Grimm's main opponent.  Maybe without the Delatombe and Cavaldi side story, more time could have been spent on developing the character of the Mirror Queen, letting everyone know just how much of a menace she was. <br /> <br />\\"The Brothers Grimm\\" isn't the worst movie to come out of Hollywood.  But, unfortunately, it failed to grasp the opportunity to become a great one. <br />
1400079179|3.0|I bought this book to see what all of the hype was about like so many others. I did finish it, so i cant say that i was unimpressed. But i will give my review a bit of a break-down.<br /><br />First the good: Lots of history, whether you believe it or not is your problem. Clearly lots of research was put into this novel.<br /><br />The the not-so-good: If Dan Brown was the one who uncovered this research, then i would have given it five stars. The fact that it was pretty much all based on the novel Holy Blood Holy Grail, I was disappointed. It seemed to be centered around this book with a bit of fictional characters to give the perception of plot. Id see a little bit of \\"action\\" then get a 45 minute history lesson. I disagree with the statements on the back cover thta suggest this is suspenseful.<br /><br />In all, I should have bought Holy Blood Holy Grail and just read that, which im still considering. I might try some of Brown's other books but wasn't too impressed with the hype of \\"The Code.\\"
B000G759LW|4.0|I lov eher though for her vocal abilities. She kind of soyunds like a young mariah and whitney merged together. Great great album this time around. I like the soulfulness in her voice this time around. YOu can tell this album is not over produces. Standouts are \\"Save me from myself, Candyman, Oh Mother,Slow down baby, mercy on me. Overall this is album is worth the purchase. We are gioing to see how bias the Grammy's are and watch how much grammy's she gets thi syear. I don't know why. Back on topic this album is worth the listen. Great vocals and lyrics.
B0001MDP3G|2.0|Cold Mountain, a place in Western North Carolina is no fun. Life is harsh for country farmers, and cold-blooded locals.  Sure, it's beautiful to look at through the mist as long as you're not starving to death, being raped, or murdered.  I thought I'd let potential viewers know ahead of time before they think they are going to see a romantic period piece for chicks: Cold Mountain is brutal with violence and sexual abuse.  Most of the offending scenes are unnecessary for the telling of a \\"Saga.\\"  I have no idea why Minghella felt it imperative to show Hollywood blood and skin every other scene.  Well, I know why.  The director has these fantasies and he wants everyone to understand.    A saga is a long story of adventures and side plots that finally climax in a truth so ironic that audiences can't sleep at night thinking of the terrible drama and unrequited love.  Think Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, or Gone With the Wind.  Speaking of GWTW: isn't Cold Mountain kind of a crude remake of that chestnut.  For the most part, Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and especially Renee Zellweger are awful with their dialect; in fact, they are all over the language map, and these inflections kill those moments of human suffering, erupting a giggle to the viewer's throat.    I wonder if the relationship between Zellweger's can-do Feminism and Kidman's old fashioned Southern Belle is a commentary or debate that didn't actually take place for a hundred years.  Feminism is an outgrowth of birth control and Socialism.  Empower the woman and there'd be no war.  All would cooperate as women do as workers.  Men are beasts etc.  You see what I mean.  None of these ideas pounded upon by our screenplay and director would come to fruition for a Century, so why not try to get with accuracy a slice of history.     Recreated, The Crater, a true debacle of history is truthful to a point, but after the Union soldiers are trapped in the hole, did the Confederates jump in too?  I read Bruce Canton's account, and I can assure you the Confederates fired down into the pit with no need for hand-to-hand combat.  The same may be said about the National Guard portrayal.  Films about the Civil War give the impression that every able-bodied man joined the army.  This was not true.  Legions of men stayed home and society itself, law and order, remained for the most part.  Now I won't argue with oral history.  If somewhere in North Carolina, the locals became abusive to their own people: so be it, but CM makes the villains cardboard without character development, so I was left with cheap prurient emotion.  I felt the need to bathe.
B000001FLA|3.0|I picked up a copy of Yngwie Mamsteen's album \\"Trilogy\\" recently for two reasons: <br /> <br />1: It was cheap. <br />2: He was a major influence on Dragonforce, one of my favourite bands. <br /> <br />Even so, I was duely pessimistic when I saw the cover. Anyone would be when they see a man duelling with a three-headed dragon armed only with a guitar. However, when I got home and stuck it on, I discovered that \\"Trilogy,\\" while far from being a masterful composition, wasn't quite the masturbatory shred-fest I had been expecting. <br /> <br />The majority of the guitar work on this album, while admittedly quite shallow and one-dimensional, is at least catchy and uplifting. The solos (which, let's face it, were inevitable) are in fact surprisingly well integrated into the song structures. The drumming is utterly unremarkable - your standard issue snare/bass/crash cymbal kind of deal. The keyboards, on the other hand, genuinely add something to the songs, providing a backbone of harmonious melody and giving the songs a touch of theatrical flair. Yes, they are utterly cheesy and poppy, but at the end of the day, they're fun. <br /> <br />Mark Boals' vocal performance is something of a mixed bag. On one hand, you have his melodious oparetic calls on songs like \\"Liar,\\" providing a genuinely uplifting feeling. On the other, you have the likes of \\"Magic Mirror,\\" where he descends into weak, banal, pop metal diahrhea. My estimation would be that while he is a competent vocalist, he can't hope to compare with the likes of Bruce Dickinson and Rob Halford. <br /> <br />One of this album's main problems is the repetitive and predictable songwriting. The standard verse/chorus song structure is adhered to rigidly, every song providing the same up-tempo guitaring, cheesy, theatrical keyboards and 16th note drumming. While this formula isn't inherantly poor, it does get old quickly. <br /> <br />A more important problem comes in the form of the lack of power. The ultra-clean production on this record has resukted in a very smooth, clear guitar sound. This is no doubt included for the benefit of the guitar vituosos this album is aimed at. However, for those of us looking simply for enjoyable music, the weak sounding production can become annoying. <br /> <br />Two exceptions to the rules can be found in the instrumental tracks \\"Trilogy\\" has to offer. The first of these comes in the form of the fourth track, \\"Crying.\\" This was, for me, undoubtedly the highlight of the album. Genuinely touching, emotive melodies butress Yngwies phenomenal guitar work, an opportunity for him  showcase his skill in a musical, expressive manner. <br /> <br />The second instrumental is \\"Trilogy Suite Op: 5,\\" the album's closing track and is virtually the antithesis of \\"Crying,\\" Sterile, meaningless shredding is the name of the game here, just what I was afraid of when I bought this album. Anything on this seven minute monstrosity remotely resembling musicality is quite quickly lost among more directionless, self-indulgent wankery. <br /> <br />I think I should probably point out that this album only just made three stars in my eyes. As technical as it is, I can't help but feel that Yngwie Malmsteen is really little more than a mediocre songwriter, and at the end of the day songwriting is what counts. Guitar vituosos will love this for what it is, but for everyone else, the musical value of this album is limited. If you can get \\"Trilogy\\" cheap and you can't find anything better, then by all means pick it up for a quick hit of fun, catchy music, but don't expect it to be any more than that. And don't bother with the last track; the last time I listened to it, I couldn't listen to another guitar solo for days without shuddering.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|Inside Man is a new film by acclaimed director Spike Lee (Do The Right Thing), and stars Denzel Washington (Training Day), Clive Owen (Sin City), Christopher Plummer (Syriana), and Jodie Foster (Flightplan). Inside Man would be the latest collaboration between Lee and Washington, after such films as 1992's Malcolm X, and 1998's He Got Game.    Spike Lee surprises audiences this time around with a suspenseful heist thriller, a territory that he hadn't experimented with up until Inside Man.     Clive Owen plays bank robber Dalton, who leads a gang into a New York City bank one day, forces the hostages to wear the same clothes they are wearing including black hoodies and white masks. Washington plays troubled detective Keith Frazier, who is trying to negotiate with Dalton to let hostages go and find out what he wants. In the meantime, bank owner Arthur Case, played by Plummer, is afraid the robbers might uncover a secret document in one of the safe boxes in the bank, so he assigns a tough-as-nails problem solver named Madeline White, played by Foster, to try to strike a deal with the robbers. What Frazier is about to uncover are deep secrets and a very unexpected surprise as the events unfold.    Despite some flaws and a few vague characters, I enjoyed Inside Man. Denzel Washington, as usual, delivers a fine performance, and Spike Lee's direction is right on target.    Recommended    B
B000GFLKEY|3.0|'Inside Man' is the story of a NYPD Detective named Keith Frazier (played by Denzel Washington), struggles to outsmart a clever bank robber (Clive Owen) who, along with a well-trained strategic crew of accomplices, has seized control of a Wall Street bank, turning what initially looks like a hostage crisis into a personal crusade to expose a mysterious secret.<br /><br />As the dangerous game continues, a power broker called Madaline White (Jodie Foster) injects more problem solving into an already crucial and dangerous situation.<br /><br />With an impressive cast that also includes Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe, 'Inside Man' is a pretty solid, entertaining and engaging film. However, it all seems as if it could have been done better. Thrilling and tense scenes that are supposed to be \\"thrilling and tense\\", are not. The story seems to travel in one constant and slightly boring pace, while performances are just pale. The acting in 'Inside Man' is a surprise, as for its impressive cast of professional actors are, in a way, unprofessional. For example: Denzel Washington (to no surprise) plays himself as he does in every other film he has been in, Clive Owen (to no surprise again) acts as if he is reading directly from the script in his usual constant boredom tone that drags on throughout the entire film, plus Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe's easily forgettable performances.<br /><br />The acting IS bad in this film, but not terrible. From Clive Owen's minimal effort to act, to Denzel Washington's annoying outburts of laughter and attempts at black humor is quite possibly the worst of the acting in 'Inside Man'. The cast do in a way let this film down. Especially the unwatchable scenes were Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) talks to his unbelieveably slutty and cheezy wife/object, who is always situated on the bed in a glossy pink nighty.<br /><br />With an intelligent and new twist on the 'bank robbery' genre, 'Inside Man' does at times surprise and outsmart the viewer. Clive Owen's character pulls off a very cool and dangerously clever bank robbery that successfully fools the entire NYPD. Which is impressive.<br /><br />This is only an alright film (far from brilliant) and if it was only for the poor acting, 'Inside Man' would have been a much better and actually thrilling thiller.and outsmart the viewer.

B000FSME1A|1.0|First off, I must say that I enjoy both versions of this movie very much (although I still prefer the original.  I was looking forward in being able to own both versions in this one low priced set.  It has a interesting packaging design, but what it contains is a major dissapointment.  The movies are split up over two discs so you have to watch \\"act 1\\" then put in disc 2 to watch \\"act 2\\".  This is the lamest presentation of any movie I have ever seen.  They could have easily put the original on one disc and Redux on the other.  So on disc one you have half of the original version and half of redux (then disc 2 for the other half of redux and the orignal)! I don't understand the point of this as it breaks up the flow of watching the movies.  I guess they were thinking people would watch Act 1 of both redux and the original and move on to act 2.  Why not get even more ridiculous and split it up even more into 3 acts or 4 acts or 20 acts over a span of dvds!!! Just leave the movie ON ONE DISC please!  If you want to go ahead and stop in the middle of the movie and change to another disc just to watch the rest of a movie go ahead and get this.  If you want to be able to watch a movie all the way through on one disc DO NOT BUY.  Also the video quality really doesn't look all that improved from the first DVD releases of the films.  1 star just cause the films are good (well and the fact I have to give it at least one) The Horror, The Horror.

B00005NGZX|5.0|I've been avoiding writing a review for this album for some time now, in fear of not being able to convey the wonder it is. How can you put a mind-altering masterpiece like this into words? A number of wildly different adjectives can be used to describe this album, such as frightening, beautiful, horrific, majestic, chaotic, etc. One undeniable word for it; passionate. Every last note of this record is shrieked, pounded, and hammered as though it is the bandmembers' last chance in this world to truly express themselves. The conviction of this band is astonishing, unlike any other band I've heard in my 27 years. I can say with absolute certainty that this album with never leave my personal top 10, all genres included. I never really gave hardcore music a chance until listening to this album, and since then, few in the genre have lived up to my first impression. Every fan of heavy music should at least hear this album. I'm almost too personally attached to this record to give it an honest review, but music has always been a subjective topic. The title track alone is worth stacks of inferior CDs...

That is an existencial journey, the search of your own destiny, enjoying life despite all adversities you may encounter in your path. The language structure and syntax Vargas Llosa uses in this novel, can always give you duality of meaning, depending on how you read a definite sentence. You feel traveling throught ages, culture, events than circunvent the story, and the ending is not an end. It is a begining of a new life.
B0000028PI|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  One of the BEST hard rock albums released in the 1990s.  Last Temptation is a very cool concept album in the same vein as Welcome To My Nightmare=but way better. The production is awesome, musicianship is topnotch, great lyrics, track order flows from start to finish and has that great, theatrical feel you would expect from AC.  Standout tracks..It's hard to narrow them to a few cause each song is a gem, but will go with Nothing's Free, Lullaby & It's Me=one of his best ballads since I'll never cry. I got to see many of the songs from the cd get performed when I saw him in concert in 1998 (Unfortunately, The Only time I've got to see him live, But I did get to meet him at a Horror Show Once!!! Way cool and polite celebrity!!) and it was a great, great show!!! If you want to have an essential Alice Cooper Studio albumcollection definately start with THE LAST TEMPTATION along with BRUTAL PLANET, THE EYES OF ALICE COOPER, RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL along with the Ol' Skool Alice LOVE IT TO DEATH, BILLION DOLLAR BABIES & WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE.  p.s. When the LAST TEMPTATION was 1st released, It coincided with a 3-part Marvel Comic Mini Series which was the perfect staple of media to tie in with the album.  Darkhorse Comics did get the rights to it and now has it available in a graphic novel book. So, If you like hard rock, horror & comics=You'll love the LAST TEMPTATION album and graphic novel!!!

B0000ACY0Y|5.0|Way back in the dark ages known as 1985, I was lucky to catch a show by the Byrds Tribute Band at the Boathouse in Norfolk, Va. No,  it wasn't the five original guys, but Gene Clark & Michael Clarke ( Original Drummer ) were part of the show with members of the Flying Burrito Bros, Firefall, Beach Boys & Byrds of 1969 - 1972 Editions.<br /><br />To see the great Gene Clark up close was really something... He was in fine voice and could play guitar much better than David Crosby would lead you to believe. To say he was one of the greats would be an understatement.<br /><br />Around a year back I purchased: \\" No Other \\" because of  what Johhny Rogan wrote about it in his book \\" Timeless Flyte \\". I made it through the  first four  tunes and had to hit the stop button. Oh, my  what was this junk and why all the fuss?  Well, about a week back I gave \\" No Other \\" a new listen... BUT I began at track 9:  \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning\\" and  wow, I was floored with what I Heard and the next six cuts that followed were EVEN BETTER !!!<br /> The Released Version of \\"No Other\\" from 1974 is a mess to put it nicely. The production of Thomas J. Kaye is WAAAY WRONG with weird gospel singers and Gene's Voice being streched too far over the rainbow.  I can't  even begin to fathom how many drugs  Mr. Kaye had to be taking when he did this to Gene. This is like a tuna fish sandwhich with so much gloop on it that you cannot begin to remember what you were eating in the first place. Listen to the first 8 tracks of this CD ... then go take a cold shower, calm down and then listen to tracks 9 thru 15 and hear the REAL ARTIST and only then will you understand what all the fuss was about.<br /> Gene created this thing called folk-rock.  Gene, was the true secret greatness of the Byrds from 1964-1966, and what a fantastic songwriter.. he will never get the praise he deserves.<br />  Forget about the very bad production of the original release, forget about all of Gene's bad habits that took him from this place way too soon and listen to something total original as the alternate versions show us now just  much this great artist is missed.<br /> Call it: Folk-Rock<br /> Call it: Country-Rock<br /> I like to call it: Great!<br /><br /> I was one of the lucky ones,  I will never forget that night at the Boathouse up close listening to one of the very best performers...

I started reading this book, not expecting much-never having heard of the author, as just a way to pass some time on my flight over to Costa Rica. By the time the plane landed I didn't want to get up cause that would mean I had to stop reading! I'm telling ya, my friends were all mad at me by the end of our trip because I couldn't put down this book! When I got to the end of the book I was sharing a hotel with a couple of friends and when that twist happened I just started balling! I woke up my friends with my crying! Haha, but anyways, I had never cried from reading a book before. Since then I have been recommending this book to everyone! It is currently circling my group of friends and family for their reading pleasure. Absolutely fabulous book! Good going Jodi!
B00006AW2J|5.0|Somewhat simular to the Grateful Dead's \\"Workingman's Dead\\" as in giving us a band's departure from previous and subsequent work, Beggars Banquet represents a shift from R&B to more countrified blues idioms.  \\"Sympathy\\" is, of course, such a song as had a whole movie shot around its recording and became infamous after Altamont, and Street Fighting Man seems crafted to be the hit radio staple it became.  But many other gems abound.  This is definitely a man's collection.  Ever felt stuck with a girlfriend that wasn't quite right (Dear Doctor?)  Remember feeling estranged from your family or being happy with a real working woman, or tempted by a lady way younger than you are?  It's all there, plus some gorgeous acoustic strings (I don't mean violin), some wonderful Hopkins keys, and Jagger's voice at its absolute prime.  Enjoy!

B000BBOUU4|3.0|I'm the first person I know who would completely go against Hollywood for remaking what is, in my eyes, a classic. I've always been vehemently opposed to remade classics such as 'Planet of the Apes', \\"Psycho', and the list goes on, with Hollywood taking some perfectly wonderful classics and simply ruining them in the name of more money and a lack of original ideas.  Yet with a remake and rename to 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory',I was pleasantly surprised for two reasons:  1) The original grasped at some potentially high-tech-like and creepy scenes that would've looked much better with good technology, which, at the time, was unavailable (creepy boat scene in the chocolate waters, the TV Room scene with the little boy who shrunk, the glass elevator ...or, respectively, Wonkivator. These scenes looked great in the remake - when good movie-making technology remakes a classic that didn't yet have the equipment, it makes it look good, and in this case, looks DO stand to benefit the movie.   2) As a nutty fan of Gene Wilder, who did a wonderful job as the original Willy Wonka, I do think Johnny Depp worked for this movie, and worked very, very well. People need to stop criticizing him. For one, he's a good actor. Second, he's also a great COMIC actor. He picks up on the nuances, has excellent timing, and shares a similar facial control to Gene Wilder, enabling him to deliver comedic lines with that same dead-pan stillness which Gene Wilder was notorious for. Johnny Dep is also one of the few actors today who is unafraid to take chances, and his Wonka character was creepy in how androgynous and eccentric it was. I laughed when he seemed to throw up a little in his mouth evert time the term 'parents' came up. I don't think any other actor would've been as good for the role of Wonka.   All in all, the acting was actually very good in this movie, including the minor characters. I always found Charlie to be a minor character in this movie, and in this remake I kept thinking 'Tiny Tim' or 'Oliver Twist'. I kept expecting Charlie to finish a chocolate bar and then grovel to Wonka, \\"Please sir, can I have some more?\\" He was cute, in that gaunt, poor way, and I had the urge to feed him lots of porridge.   Now, the bad: Overall, the story is okay, though there are some key elements missing, and those were what put a big damper on the movie for me. The mysterious man in the original, whose name I forget, the one who acts like a competitor for Wonka's chocolate recipes, trying to secretly bribe the children into extracting a piece of candy to analyze the ingredients, is missing. His character, in my opinion, was central. He was essentially greed, one of the main motivators of it. He was a test to distinguish which child was natually loyal, and which was a greedy little brat.   In the remake, Charlie automatically wins by default because all the other kids are gone. Wonka, for being so concerned about his precious Ooomap-Loompas and factory, is willing to surrender it all to a random boy simply based on DEFAULT? I think not.   And to make matters worse, there was that little wounded child scenario, with Wonka's estranged daddy, and the reunion. I think I threw up in my mouth a little when I saw that. Don't mean to sound cynical here, but the beauty of the original \\"Willy Wonka\\"  was about a mysterious, cynical man whose heart melts when he finds someone worthy and loyal enough that he can trust as his heir, not his therapist, for cryin' out loud. The beuaty was that Wonka never needed to explain to himself...he was a weird, eccentric guy, unapologetic and, well, weird. The other thing about him was that he was enigmatic. Does anyone remember a time when a character could be this way without being BAD? Does anyone remember when enigmatic, unexplained behavior in a character, in a FANTASY story no less, worked, without everyone needing to jump on the bandwagon and dissect the character, coldly sucking out his insides and calling him a pervert? It's just sad.    This daddy thing just ruins Wonka's character completely and keeps pointing out his shortcomings and bad childhood. I felt like I was beginning to read the introduction to a very bad self-help book after a while. This was a movie, after all, a fantasty, not a self-help book, or am I wrong??   All in all, the acting was great for me, but the script was poorly written. Someone took their Daddy issues and insisted on shoving them in, which annoyed me. But I think it's an okay movie, as long as you have the classic handy and watch that too, because that is the real thing.
0792839749|3.0|I can't see how this movie can compete with all the newer, more flashy kids' movies that are available. However, the story is simple and sweet and so are the songs. I bought the movie because my autistic daughter likes simple musicals which feature kids and she enjoys listening to me sing the movie's songs which are so easy to learn. There are better choices for Disney movies from this era, like Mary Poppins and Bedknobs and Broomsticks.

I don't quite understand why this movie is so special to daughter. She is autistic and one thing I know about her tastes is that she gets bored very easily with contrived, canned entertainment. If it comes from the heart, she really takes it to her heart. Maybe the ensemble that put together this movie had a lot of fun doing it and she picks up on that. She prefers it over Mary Poppins and much prefers it over Chitty-Chitty Bang Bang

B00005JOQS|4.0|I am probably giving away my age but, as a child, I used to enjoy Superman on the radio.  I also read all of the comics.  By the time the television series began however, I considered Superman \\"kid stuff\\" and, for this reason, never saw any of the film versions of the Superman saga on the big screen either.  However, I'm now a grandma.  So watching \\"Superman Returns\\" with my 5- and 6-year old grandchildren was an interesting experience.<br /><br />When the film opens, Superman, played by newcomer Brandon Routh, is returning as Clark Kent to his mother, an elderly Eva Marie Saint.  He's been traveling in outer space for five years, trying to discover if the planet he originally came from, Krypton, still exists.  It doesn't.  And so he is thrust back into his life as both Superman and the quiet reporter, Clark Kent.  Naturally, he wants to see Lois Lane again, who just happens to have a 5-year old son and a boyfriend.  Of course there is also a bad guy.  That's Kevin Spacy, and he is introduced in a scene with an elderly woman which was extremely confusing.  This bad guy has a girlfriend, played by Parker Posey, who adds a bit of life into the rest of the film which seems a bit tired.<br /><br />Much to the delight of my grandchildren and the rest of the audience, there were great special effects.  However, I spent a lot of time explaining superman facts to them, like where Superman came from, and that the bad guy can hurt Superman by using Kryptonite. There is one part where the bad guy is beating up a weak superman which upset the children, but I was sure to tell them that in a movie like this Superman will ALWAYS win out in the end.  All of this explanation caused my grandson to as me, \\"How do YOU know so much about Superman, Grandma?\\"<br /><br />Yes.  I did enjoy the film.  But I don't think it had anything to do with its quality.  \\"Superman Returns\\" would have bored me completely if I didn't have my fresh-faced grandchildren to play mentor to.  That's why I can only give it a very modest recommendation.hy I can only give it a very modest recommendation.
B000G759LW|3.0|I REALLY wanted to love this CD, but just plain don't.  Now, don't get me wrong.  Everyone knows about her voice, blah blah blah, but it's a bit overdone on this album.  I was listening to some of the 'softer' songs and she started the whole yelling belting bit and it took away from the emotion and vibe of the song I was beginning to feel from the music itself.      This CD was DEFINITELY love inspired and as a newly engaged woman, I can relate to some of the lyrics.  But the only other primary theme on this CD was abuse or talking about the sad times she's gone through.      I was hoping to hear more light songs, not necessarily songs that would either make me appreciate my honey more or jump off of a building.    And I kept waiting for all the inspiration (20's, 30s, 40s) she's been claiming in interviews to peer out from the songs, but only got it on a couple.  I wanted more of the vibe she was talking about and didn't get it.      So, yes, I love the girl and she can SANG, but it didn't quite reach the high bar she'd already set.      I'm going to try to like this album.  Who knows... maybe I'll change my review in the future.    UPDATE:  Okay, so I've had more time to listen and appreciate this CD and while I still agree with most of my earlier points, homegirl did good.  There is alot of soul and gospel, but not necessarily the jazz I was hoping for.
B000G759LW|5.0|My review title is directed both at the stellar new album from Xtina, and to the other reviewers who claim that she \\"overdid it\\" on this album. Her voice is her instrument and she should be allowed to play around and have fun with it - she has so much talent that I spend most of my time listening to her just in complete awe of her abilities. I have always appreciated that she takes her time between albums so that she actually has something to write about, rather than cranking out continuous bilge like so many other musicians do. This set of cd's contains a diverse range of songs, and I cannot say that I dislike any of them. I say, congratulations Christina. You clearly took a risk with this kind of album and not everyone can handle it, but if anyone had any remaining doubts, it proves that you are a TRUE artist. Thank you, and keep 'em coming!
B000G759LW|5.0|How refreshing to see someone as young as Christina paying respect and tribute to the soul/jazz/blues legends of yesteryear (even though she appears to be confused about the eras. Most of the songs has influences from the 50s, 60s, and 70s and not just the 20s, 30s, and 40s as she claimed). This confusion does not hurt the beauty of this cd. In fact, it allows Christina to offer something to everyone. <br /> <br />On Disc One, Christina joins forces with DJ Premier, Rich Harrison, Kwame, Mark Ronson, Charles Roane, Big Tank and Tony Reyes & Ben H. Allen for an exciting world of R&B, Soul, Hip Hop and some Blues. The songs are either uptempo or midtempo, but Christina commands every lyric and melody. From the churchy \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" to the edgy \\"Here To Stay\\", Christina holds your attention. Even when she is all about \\"me\\" like on interludes F.U.S.S and Intro (Back to Basic), Christina comes across as being true with her emotions. The only song that suffers is \\"Thank You\\" which I find rather pointless. <br /> <br />On Disc Two, the show is all about Christina and Linda Perry (who is becoming one of the most important female writers/producers of all time). Songs like the Andrew Sisters-inspired \\"Candyman\\", the sexy \\"Nasty Naughty Boy, and the bluesy \\"I Got Trouble\\" are all throwbacks to another era of time. While songs like the pop ballad \\"Hurt\\" and the churchy \\"Mercy On Me\\" has a modern day twist. Christina really sells these songs but the biggest surprise is the sweet folky \\"Save Me From Myself\\" and the 50s pop style \\"The Right Man\\". In both songs, you can tell Christina is singing from the heart and to her new husband. <br /> <br />Disc One and Disc Two are actually two seperate albums because they are both very different in styles, but the quality of both cds are high level. The growth from the last cd is clear because the one thing I also noticed is while 'Stripped' concentrated on sound and structure, 'B2B' focus on songs and structures (two totally different concepts). This is also the cd in which Christina leaves behind Britney, Jessica, Lindsey and that crew and join Alicia and Beyonce as the most talented pop female artists of their generation. Wow! She has come a long way from her \\"Genie\\" days, let's hope she can continue to grow. <br /> <br />Highlights from the cd: <br />Back In the Day <br />Slow Down Baby <br />Without You <br />Still Dirrty <br />Candyman <br />Hurt <br />Mercy On Me <br />Save me From Myself <br />The Right Man
B000J4QWMC|1.0|Yes, I know there wasn't a book, and that's my point. Even worse, this movie was based on a TV show and the TV show is much better! The TV series had a sexy style, color, music, and a pulsating rhythm under the surface holding it all together. This movie, even with all its sexy actors and big screen, couldn't hold a candle to it. The script and the plot, even the scene changes, were disjointed. The dialogue was juvenile, the characters predictable and stereotypical. I couldn't even enjoy this as an action film. And don't get me started on the lame romance which took up a major portion of the story. Come to think of it, maybe the romance was the best part of the story.

B000F39MAG|4.0|It's fast becoming clear that stagings in European opera houses these days are by and large in the unwittingly trite \\"tradition of no tradition.\\"  To the claim that one can't do new productions in the same old manner, I'd reply that it's hard these days to see any productions that respect those historical particulars that would allegedly maim a new staging.  What we are regaled with instead is an operatic theater featuring the philistine set designer and barbaric costumer as stars.  These fashionistas are devoid of any depth of respect for the works they stage, focusing instead on a sort of colorless and mindless minimalism.  No discernible fresh but relevant ideas are behind the changes these persons choose to introduce; if there were any, one might be able to make a case for them.  Instead, what we have is a parade of repetitive and uniform ugliness. <br />What is not recognized is that it's the intensity and passion of the composer and the performers that allow a work from the past to transcend a specificity of time and place to achieve universality.  It is manifestly not mere costumes and sets, altered for no discernible purpose.  The real innovation these days would involve a demotion of these princes of decor to an appropriate subordinate place. <br />Fortunately, this production features an all stops out performance by Gruberova which can make one forgive much.  Even in late career, her work is distinguished for its beauty and passion, and it makes the viewer wish the fashionistas involved in this production had seen the same power in the work that Gruberova surely did. Then the DVD might have merited 5 stars.

However, the ones he was on, he would totally destroy everything.  I'm sure of that.<br /><br />True Lies starts off with Arnold at his best; he's a spy at a fancy ball, dressed in a tux and there for spy business.  It's only a matter of time before the bad guys are on his heels, and he has to distract them with a tango.  Yes, a tango.  Arnold grabs Tia Carerre by the arm, does the most rigid, non-sexual, unappealing tango ever, and absolutely fools the people looking for him.  Somehow this is possible, except for the fact that he was probably the only 6'5\\", 250lb, body builder from Austria in the room.<br /><br />After the dance, Arnold makes his way out of the party by doing typical Arnold stuff: he blows up buildings, shoots everyone in sight, and escapes in the nick of time.  It's actually one of my favorite scenes because it reminds me of the totally ridiculous carnage in Commando, where Arnold is deadly with every bullet fired from his pistol, but the men firing back with automatic weapons are spraying wildly around him.<br /><br />Things I learned that Arnold the spy can do: smash a car window with a backhand, fly a fighter jet, speak several languages, ride a horse, park a car like a stunt driver, fight with all his wits while under heavy sedation, and tear the hell out of a public restroom.<br /><br />The movie evolves as typical spy movies do; there is a ton of fighting, a few story loops, a one or two crazy chase scenes, classic (cheesy) lines from Arnold as he dispatches villains, and more bullets fired than at the Source Awards.  And just like nearly all other movies of this genre, the good guys undertake an epic battle/task, eventually win, get the girl, and save the Earth.  It's exactly what I expected, and exactly what I received.<br /><br />It's a great movie.  Be on the lookout for Jamie Lee Curtis dancing as you've never seen her, Chet playing a hilarious role as the biggest loser in the world, and an appearance by Eliza Dushku in her early years.do; there is a ton of fighting, a few story loops, a one or two crazy chase scenes, classic (cheesy) lines from Arnold as he dispatches villains, and more bullets fired than at the Source Awards.

B00005B36H|5.0|It's hard to write about something that I can barely understand, which is why I've waited 5 years to write a review of this album, and I figure that with the release of the latest album the time has come. <br /> <br />This is the best album I've ever heard. Hands down. For me, this beats Pink Floyd, Led Zepplin, the Doors, Radiohead, Smashing Pumpkins...all of them. Every band that has open my eyes and kept me going through my day. None of them have meant as much. <br />I guess everything started with the video for Sober (from Undertow), a video rarely seen on MTV but never failed to entice me. The album was a dark and muddy rock record with undercurrents of religious contempt, intellegence, and even a sense of humor. I liked that album, but at that point I was busy listening to grunge. <br /> <br />By the time Aenima hit, I had left grunge for industrial and metal. The first time my friends played Stinkfist for me, I was a fan. The songs were perfect, controlled and thoughtful. Their sound had progressed from a sludge to a sharp crystal. The edges would cut, yet the sides were smooth and breathtaking. To take upon a Pink Floyd comparison, Aenima was Tool's Dark Side. <br /> <br />After years of waiting and wondering if the band could ever top their perfection (and also fearing whether A Perfect Circle had taken precedence for Maynard), Tool released Lateralus. The crystal was now a bright light and even more, it was alive. The songs were organic, creeping into each other. I found the album hypnotic, better than any drug I had ever taken. The band leaned further into the melody that had been introduced on Aenima, and this became their strength. For me, the album is divided into segments, not mere songs.  <br />The first contains The Grudge through Schism, a shocking collection that pulls the listener into the album.  <br />Then Parabol/Parabola the centerpiece that shines into the eyes, blinding me from the world. <br />Ticks and Leeches stand on its own as a reminder of Tool's older sound, a heavy song full of venom. <br />The heart of the album lies with Lateralus, Disposition, and Reflection. Each song weaves into the next and creates a hypnotic and pulsing chill that always runs down my spine. This is my favorite segment, and is truly the reason why I hold this above any other album. <br />The ending songs are filled with agitation and paranoia, bringing me out of my hypnotic state and returning me to a world full of fear. <br /> <br />I think I should also mention that my Pink Floyd comparison for this album is Wish You Were Here, my favorite Floyd album. <br /> <br />10,000 Days (Tool's latest album) I would compare to Animals, a decent and interesting album that lacks greatness. <br /> <br />Thanks for reading all of this even if you don't agree with me.
B0002OERI0|5.0|A fab. blend of previous work and current thought.  The lyrics bring new emotion every time you hear it, and the mix is just as catchy as ever.  A album built for intellectuals and hard-core rock fans alike.  Buy it and you won't be disappointed.
6305558167|5.0|(4.5/5 stars)  I bought the DVD recently and watched it for the first time ever. I found it to be extraordinary. I cannot speak from any position of authority about Arthurian legend and, as such, cannot attest to its authenticity. As a film, however, this is fantastic entertainment. It has a great story, plenty of action, well-developed characters and perfect pacing. Furthermore, it is an elaborate and quality film that isn't afraid to include elements, such as sex and violence, which might limit its audience. I rather find this surprising, given the magnitude of the film. Here we have a film about a legendary English hero, which would most certainly appeal to the patriotic senses of the country's citizenry; yet, the filmmakers deemed it necessary to tell the tale graphically, thereby all but ensuring it would not be shown in classrooms. They are to be applauded for this decision because it brings the characters to life in a way they would otherwise not be. (In the end, everyone wins because edited versions have in classrooms for years)  Anyway, the acting is first-rate, the costumes (especially the armor) look authentic, the stunts are unbelievable and the direction judicial. The only gripe I have is the DVD quality, which could be a little better. Scenes are jumpy in places and there aren't any worthwhile extras, though overall the picture is decent, it is presented widescreen and the movie is all on one side of the disc. (An unpleasant surprise on some Warner Brothers DVDs has been part one of a movie is on one side and part two on the other, even though the movie itself isn't terribly long. See Amadeus and Goodfellas for examples)  5 stars for the movie, 4 for the DVD.
B000G759LW|4.0|I thought i wasnt gonna like this Christina Aguielra album but its actually good . Im not really into all that old type of music but i like this album. I just really hate that song CANDYMAN i tried to like it but i dont ! but the rest of the songs are good my favorite one is number 9 (on the 2nd disc) \\"The Right Man\\". But one thing is true Christina Aguilera could sing !!! Her voice is amazing !!!
B0000A02TZ|3.0|This film provides a few chuckles, but that is about all. Aside from three or four scenes featuring John Belushi (the food fight not being one of them), I don't find it at all funny. Perhaps I witnessed too many frat boy shenanigans while in college, but in this movie these seem more irritating than they do amusing. I don't find myself caring about any of the shallow, one dimensional characters and it drags on way too long at the end. The section at the very end, which shows what happens to each character in the future, might have been novel at the time. Now, however, it comes across as a clich&eacute;, and a not very funny one at that.
1565847032|5.0|\\"Understanding Power\\" contains so much discussion, dialogue, and exchange of information that there isn't a way to cover even 10% of what's in the book.  A good bang for the buck.  Whether newcomer to Noam or well-read of him, you can do further research on the topics discussed in this book, on your own.  \\"Understanding Power\\" contains a comprehensive index. The editing, footnoting, and referencing is superb. <br /> <br />Chomsky's perspectives have always been intriguing.  Not because they aren't mainstream, but because they are often corroborated as fact. He has ability to think and communicate outside of the conglomerate box.  Disturbing at the same time are Chomsky's presentation of facts about concepts that we as ordinary citizens are latently aware of, but not necessarily overtly conscious of.  Partly because, we aren't exposed to these facts and viewpoints.    <br /> <br />A few of the numerous points discussed are: \\"Creation of wants,\\" public education, journalism in America, foreign policy motives, 1994 Oslo Peace Agreement, Dili Massacre, and many other historical and current event topics that go on today, in 2006.   <br />  <br />Early anti-free speech Supreme Court rulings and laws were also reviewed in \\"Understanding Power.\\" We're reminded that the U.S. is basically the only country in the entire world that has legal safeguards to the degree it does regarding the Freedom of Speech.  Meaning, the extent of Freedom of Speech to the degree we have it, under legal protection under law.  The Sedition Act (1798) was not struck down until 1964.  Previous USSC precedents stifling the Freedom of Speech were the Espionage Act 1917, and the Smith Act 1940, and later 'Schenck.'      <br /> <br />The System of Journalism and the media in the United States is systematic.  It's very controlled.  It is, censored.  <br /> <br />One of Chomsky's points we should be aware is that the media serves two functions:   <br /> <br />1) Indoctrination of the Elites.  Why?  Because they serve power.  The Elites are often the most indoctrinated segment of society, because they help serve those in power by participating in the decision-making process. (Informing the masses.)   <br /> <br />2) Marginalize and exclude the rest of the population: <br />The second function of the media is to marginalize and exclude the rest of the population (the masses) from awareness and participating in the decision-making process: television sitcoms, \\"National Enquirer,\\" sports, \\"American Idol,\\" and reality TV for example.  This latter function targets about 85% of the American public.  <br /> <br />THE MEDIA FILTERING SYSTEM:  <br /> <br />One way to control and direct the message of the mainstream conglomerate media to the Elites and masses is to create a system of hiring journalists who think, believe, and write, what is \\"supposed to be written.\\"  It's no overt, conspiracy.  But this is how things work.  Journalists that get hired and have critical assignments given to them often have \\"internalized the values\\" they are \\"supposed\\" to have and espouse when writing stories on issues they cover.  This is especially true when it comes to Foreign Policy.  As journalist Tom Wicker of the \\"New York Times\\" states, \\"Nobody tells me what to write.\\"  Wicker is correct: no one *tells* him what to write.  But if he didn't write what he actually writes, he wouldn't be in the journalistic system, writing for one of the most well-known and influential newspapers in America.  Alternative perspectives held by the likes of like Alexander Cockburn do get their occasional snippets in the back of the \\"Wall St. Journal\\" for the \\"sake of balance.\\"  The quashing of alternative viewpoints is not about \\"Right vs. Left,\\" either.  Those who think independently are weeded out.  Chomsky notes several journalists whose work you can find, as examples of how information is created, constructed, molded, and disseminated.  <br /> <br />Public Education: <br /> <br />The public education systemis designed to mold and shape our values so they our conducive to dominant political-social-cultural expectations.  Jump through the hoops of the education system, and get letters behind your name (Ph.D, M.Ed, BA, MA, MS, etc).  You have been trained.  You've done what you're told, and thought what you were and are, supposed to think.  <br /> <br />A brief note reinforcing what Chomsky states about criticizing Zionism and its consequences.  In April of 2006, an article questioning the establishment's support of Israel by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt was going to be published in the \\"Atlantic Monthly.\\"  But was shelved at the last minute.  The article was written by two of the most leading prominent international relations experts from the Center of the Spectrum.    <br /> <br />For those reading \\"Understanding Power,\\" and other works by Noam Chomsky: It's worth stating the obvious biases and opinions that we as human beings, have.  Therefore, one needs to *try* to be as objective as possible when reading Chomsky, as any other author that discusses these issues.  Whether one agrees or not, a reader should attempt to look at both sides, regardless of their final opinion.  It seems to many people are unable to do this today (myself included) because of television, talk radio, and spin-doctors.  Chomsky is just an individual. Not the leader of a movement.  This is good. Few can say this today.  Love him or hate him, he evokes the ire in many because he doesn't jump when the powerful tell him to do so.  He certainly doesn't say and write what the establishment wants him to say and write, either.  What strengthens his positions are the shallow attempts to silence him by the spin-doctors, talking heads, and radio talk-show hosts.    <br /> <br /> <br />
0780626494|4.0|(3.5/5 stars)  Aside from the stray profanity, this is a decent family movie. Brendan Fraser is charming as a young man who has spent almost his entire youth underground because his overly cautious father was a little too anxious to try out his self-built bomb shelter. Adam Webber (Fraser) learned almost everything he knows from his parents, played with goofy provinciality by Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek. When it comes time for Adam to purchase supplies in order to restock the shelter and/or get married (dancing with mom just wasn't cutting it any more), he heads up to modern-day Los Angeles. As luck would have it, the first girl he meets, Eve, happens to fit all his qualifications for a mate, and she happens to be looking for an earnest doofus, which Adam fits to a T. So, Adam and Eve plan to populate this post-apocalyptic world with little Cains and Ables, apparently. Eve is played by the luminous, ever delectable Alicia Silverstone, and I can honestly say this is one of her better films. She has deserved so much better than she has had. This romantic comedy is unrealistic, but it is both entertaining as well as insightful. This is one of those movies that more successfully examines the concept of time displacement than science fiction films do. What happens when someone from the early 1960s is transported thirty years into the future? In retrospect, how much has changed in the past thirty years? For all our commonalities, how much has the human race changed during this period (for better or for worse)? Manners and the mentality of the Cold War are but two aspects of life this film observes. Pretty decent.

If you ever  <br />wondered about Klingon, Romulan, or Borg relations with the  <br />Federation, there is plenty here for the interspecies enthusiast <br />as well.  Of course, if your concern is more thematic, you may  <br />be interested in how well or how poorly each story is written. <br /> <br />The Star Trek franchise has reached the point where many of its  <br />supposed deficiencies may be forgiven.  It is large as life now- <br />an icon worldwide--and it is interesting just to see how the  <br />universe of Star Trek creates itself continuously, regardless <br />of the quality of writing or direction.   <br /> <br />The set's one major drawback is its predictability.

B0002PUHF6|5.0|A reviewer below said that this film will only seem good to those who saw it in the 80s and that people who have never seen it shouldn't. Well I really have to disagree. I'm only 15 so I obviously never saw this film in the 80s, but a few months ago I bought this DVD for 15 bucks and it was one of the best 15 bucks I ever spent. This film is great. If you actually like real horror films then you should like this film. Also the same reviewer said that the special efx were only good when the film came out, but I thought the efx were great and better than the CGI of today. So if you're a fan of horror and haven't seen this film yet you should go out and buy it right now. The DVD is amazing by the way and pretty cheap.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|As the previous reviewers have stated, this particular show was absolutely amazing! As a fan of the band since 1989 and having seen 37 DT shows to date, this show tops them all and I am proud to say that I was there!     However, unlike those previous reviewers, I've actually managed to get a copy of this DVD ahead of time, and after watching it, I can say for certain that this DVD *is* DT's best yet! Mike Portnoy pulls out all the stops in making sure that this DVD tops everything else they've done thus far. The picture quality is gorgeous - better than Live at Budokan, if that can be believed. I was told by someone who worked on the project that extra attention was put in the details to ensure that every single frame was perfect, and it shows! The sound itself is also a thing of beauty - even the stereo mix is not the traditional AC3 encoding, but rather the superior PCM encoding. The actual mix is very well done by Michael Brauer and is balanced nicely, allowing each of the musicians to shine throughout. It is quite evident that every bit of space on the DVD was used.    I won't go on about the actual songs themselves, as you can read many reviews of the actual show to learn about them. However, I would like to point out that while the song selection is not to everyone's taste (as is evident from the other reviews), Mike Portnoy continues to give the fans the most bang for their buck by not having the same songs on every DVD like many other bands do - the only \\"overlapping\\" songs on this DVD compared to their previous DVDs are some parts of the song Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence (as found on Live at Budokan), The Spirit Carries On and Metropolis pt. 1 (found on Scenes From New York) and Under a Glass Moon (on Live in Tokyo).     One other thing to add is that seeing the orchestra perform with the band is absolutely stunning - something to behold and the final song (Metropolis pt. 1) proves this beyond a shadow of a doubt.    The second DVD showcases 3 bonus tracks (Another Day, The Great Debate and Honor Thy Father) which are taken from older shows; they are nice to have to round out the collection, but it should be noted that the picture and sound quality are not to the same standards as on the first DVD. Still their inclusion is worth having seeing as live performances of these songs have previously been unavailable on DVD. Also on the second DVD is the animation that was played during the song Octavarium, so if you happened to miss watching it during the show you were at, now you'll have the chance to watch it in full.    The best part of the second DVD has to be the documentary showing the history of the band from the days of being at Berklee School of Music up to the present day. Definitely a good look into DT's history, and a great companion to the book that Rich Wilson is writing on DT ([...] My only real complaint on the documentary is that it isn't long enough, but surely Rich's book will fill in many of the stories and details missing in the documentary.    All in all, this release is definitely a labor love for the fans. No DT fan's collection will be complete without it. Also, both the show itself and the documentary serve as a great way to introduce DT to those who are just beginning to learn about them. I give this DVD the highest recommendation I possibly can! Stop reading these reviews and buy this thing - you won't regret it!!!
0743201140|5.0|A family member bought me this book, having found it helpful for themself - and I've also found it a winner. Very, very helpful. A major step up from Myers Briggs, and other personality tests which I've done before - much more precise and accurate.    The idea is that people should look to build on their strengths and manage around their weaknesses - the internet questionnaire helps you to identify those strengths.     I've recently gone through some life changes, and the book & questionaire provided me with very useful insights into the way I 'operate'. I've already changed work habits with pleasing results.    My wife and I both got copies, and the questionnaire seemed to identify our strengths pretty well. Explained why my wife knows everyone in our neighbourhood, and always checks the mileometer, whilst I prefer to stay at home reading biographies!! We both agree that it's also helped us understand each other a lot more, so good for our relationship.    Yes you have to buy the book for each user, but personally I think it's well worth the investment (and it's a lot cheaper than some lesser courses). I've happily bought copies for other people since then.    Much recommended.
B000BCKFWK|5.0|The original DVD was great, but splitting the individual stories up into 3 seperate movies, with additional scenes each, makes this DVD top-notch.

The more I listen to this album, the more I enjoy and appreciate her breathtaking vocals and amazing talent. Just like they say in the Intro of the album, \\"This is how music should sound.\\" <br /> <br />This album is one of the most unique and flawless that I've heard in a long time. There are only two songs I choose to skip over (\\"I Got Trouble\\" and \\"Thank You\\") but the other twenty I can't get enough of! \\"Candyman\\" is so much fun, while \\"Hurt\\" and \\"The Right Man\\" are guaranteed to give you goosebumps. <br /> <br />Christina, keep up the amazing work! This album is definitely Grammy worthy, and I highly recommend it to anyone who appreciates music.
158234082X|5.0|Having been long mesmerized by the earthy charms of Anthony Bourdain, as he appears in his hit Travel Channel show \\"No Reservations\\", I felt it high time I read the book that started it all in 2000.  And, too, having once been in a tortured relationship with a French Lebanese hotelier and restaurateur, I thought I knew the biz.  Hell no.  Apparently I had been sheltered from the truly seamy side of the kitchen and knew nothing.  I love this book.<br /><br />Want to sit in the store room of a restaurant and spy on the egos?  The horseplay?  The social pathology? Oh the humanity! This is truly the sex, drugs, and rock and roll of the restaurant industry. Guaranteed, after reading this work, you will never encounter a dining establishment the same way again. You will realize that just on the other side of those swinging doors exists a barely contained lunacy that regards the customer as motivation but not end, and which, if the venue is good, manages to pull off culinary perfection again and again, in spite such seeming obstacles as substance addiction and stab wounds.<br /><br />Bourdain's raw use of unfiltered language is brilliant. It's as evocative as the aroma of a highly spiced stew.  At once memoir and muck rake, the reader is treated to an intimate peek over the shoulder into the author's bohemian and colorful life. The rapturous epiphany of a fourth grader's first taste of vichyssoise. The realization that \\"food is power\\".  Apprentice misadventures:  \\"they'd let us practice our knifework on whole legs of beef... we were the culinary version of the Manson family...\\". Industry advisements: avoid buffets.  Eat out on Wednesday or Thursday. Forget about Saturday night (unless you know the chef or maitre`d).<br /><br />I hope to heaven someone makes this into a film.  It would be hysterical.  A character actors dream.  It would be worth the price of admission alone to see whoever plays Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, the insane but genius baker who has pots of uniquely based dough starter tucked into all unlikely corners of the premises, and who phones in to work, incapacitated by a bender, yelling at the staff to \\"Feed the bitch! Feed her or she'll die!\\" referring to the maintenance of the giant mother vat of bubbling starter pushing its way out of the bowl like some yeasty Audrey II.<br /><br />If you are a foodie, or anyway close to that, you'll devour the book in one sitting. Get it. Don't hesitate.niquely based dough starter tucked into all unlikely corners of the premises, and who phones in to work, incapacitated by a bender, yelling at the staff to \\"Feed the bitch!

0895260131|5.0|I don't like the title because I'm sure it will turn many people away which is a shame because this book does what the mainstream media will never do: tell the truth about Islam. <br />A while back either Time magazine or U.S. News & World Report did a special issue about Islam. Of course it was a total white-wash of that religion. No mention of Muhammed marrying a 7-year-old (yes, a 7-year-old!), no mention of brutal conquest, no mention of persecution, no mention of a poll tax for non-Muslims, no mention of the invasion into Europe, etc, etc....  <br />This book tells all the truth about the history of the \\"religion of peace\\".

0440418569|1.0|I enjoyed the first two a great deal.  The final installment still has a lot of great imagery but gets darn lazy in the making sense department.  Characters die for no reason.  God is disapated with little notice - which is odd as that is kind of what the whole book was leading up to- even the big meanie Metatron is kind of destroyed along with two major characters off screen- we just hear about it later as a sidenote.  The rules of the universe he created are undefined and too maleable to support the end of the story.  It was like he decided the end should have a tragic overtone and just pasted it on, and the two young leads lost all the gumption they had in the earlier books and just accepted with no fight.  The kids in the earlier books would have forced the angels or whomever to make it work out.  With the thousands of windows closed one can hardly imagine 2 windows would be that big of a deal for the children's lifespan which as the angels and the witches keep saying is so brief in the big picture (seeing as the kids did save the universe after all).  It just didn't make sense.  Spatial relationships in geography were also undefined and lost all sense of meaning of whether the kids were traveling a thousand miles or seemingly jumping continents.  I'm no fan of religion but he villified the church into simplistic evil which I think undermines the truth of his worthier ideas.   A very disapointing end to two wonderful books.
B000002AZ8|2.0|If you read my review of YIELD, it will apply to this album just as well - it's boring, bland and uninteresting.   <br /> <br />If I might add, I had a great time listening to the garage band THE DETROIT COBRAS - their musical sense of ROCK N ROLL is right on par with spirit, sound production and the way RNR should be played. PJ should take some lessons from them.
B000G759LW|3.0|The good news, everyone already knows.  Christina Aguilera is very talented, has a strong, flexible voice and tons of charisma.  She also deserves credit for trying out new things, instead of sticking to formula hip-hop pop (Are you listening, Mariah?).  I love her first 2 albums.  BUT - I have problems with this one.  In the first place, too many of the tracks sound like the ones on \\"Stripped\\".  I can hardly tell the difference.  Second, the CD is overdone - too many tracks.  One good CD would have been enough.  Even Madonna never stuck us with a double CD, except \\"Evita\\", a movie soundtrack.  And some of the individual tracks suffer from overkill too - \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" and \\"The Right Man\\", for example.  And third, Christina needs to rein in that voice a little.  We all know she has power, but sometimes it is a little too loud, to the point of being harsh.  On \\"Oh Mother\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"Hurt\\", she sings more softly and sounds beautiful.  I also like \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" and \\"Mercy On Me\\".  I really hate having to be negative overall, but I think she tried too hard to produce a blockbuster.  Next time, just make a good album.
B00005JMEW|5.0|I haven't seen anyone point out the obvious inspiration of this film.  Obvious to me I guess, because I don't know martial arts movies too well.  The Jeanne Moreau film from the sixties, a group of men kill her husband-to-be at the wedding ceremony, and she hunts them down one by one, for the rest of the movie, first enslaving them, and then killing them. <br /> <br />This one is \\"updated\\" in that it's not the husband, it's the whole bridal party that \\"gets it\\", including the bride really, and especially her \\"unborn child\\", a girl (how did she know??).. <br /> <br />But she rises from the dead as it were...and goes to re-establish Justice...not acknowledging that it is \\"justice\\" that destroys the inner child of every one of us. <br /> <br />A great thought-provoking film.  I could talk for days but will spare you...it's \\"religious\\" to me...and killing bill is about the same as nailing the Law to the Cross.  But the same guy says he came to fulfill it, not destroy it.  My favorite part was how the nasty fight with Vivica stops when her beautiful little daughter shows up...please, we mustn't be our horrible killing selves in front of the children...and yet it always works out, that THERE THEY ARE, at the Moment of Truth...and down the same path they go...
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour comes out of hiding with this stunning masterpiece he calls \\"On An Island\\". The singer/guitarist/songwriter/producer of Pink Floyd shocked fans with his most personal musical statement yet. While the sound is very Pink Floyd (why wouldnt it be though as Gilmour was the primary songwriter of Pink Floyd)it bears alot of emotion that was absent from his music before. The result is a very guitar driven melodic collection of songs. With his trademark guitar sound and his haunting voice Gilmour delivered the goods on this one. Pink Floyd colleauge Richard Wright joins Gilmour in his first solo album in nearly 20 years. The standout tracks are the title track, \\"Take A Breath\\" and \\"Smile\\". The tracks also play very well live and the only disappointing thing about this disc is...when it end's. Highly recommended!
B0000VD04M|5.0|AWESOME, A REALLY AWESOME FILM, MARTIN LANDAU IS FANTASIC , BUT SO MANY OVERLOOKED PERFORMANCES BY DEPP, PATRICIA ARQUETTE, BILL MURRAY, AND SARAH JESSICA PARKER. WHAT AN OFF-BEAT APPROACH OF MAKING A BIO PIC ABOUT SOMEONE, ESPECIALLY ABOUT AN ECCENTRIC LIKE ED WOOD, A B MOVIE DIRECTOR WHO LOVES WOMENS CLOTHING , THE GREAT THING ABOUT THE PICTURE IS THAT, THE MOVIE DOESNT BASE UPON THAT SPECIFIC FLAW, IF NOT, A FLAWLESS APPROACH TO  HiS RELATIONSHIPS AND HIS CORNY WAY OF DIRECTING, HE THOUGHT HE WAS GENUIS AND WAS TERRIBLE AT IT. A COMPLETE OPTIMISTIC.
B000A59PMO|4.0|I caught a few episodes of Veronica Mars when it first aired, but like many shows these days, you really have to watch the entire thing to appreciate the serialized arcs and season-long plot threads involved. Luckily, when this DVD set came out, I was able to, and I enjoyed it quite a lot a bit.<br /><br />Many people proclaimed this show the \\"next Buffy\\", but it's really the \\"first Veronica Mars\\". To set up, Veronica is the daughter of PI who both helps her father out on cases between classes, and runs her own cases whenever she can get away with it. The is one main over-arching mystery in the season, and many smaller ones (including the \\"case of the week\\"). Many of the episodes were excellent and even the ones which weren't as good, once I'd watched the whole season, turned out to reveal important little elements and steps towards the grand finale.<br /><br />The story (and mystery), however, wasn't what interested me most. It was the characters. Episode by episode, Veronica, Keith, Logan, Mac, and a few others grew on me in a way few characters in others shows have. A combination of great writing and delivery really brought them to life, and made the show truly something special, and head-and-shoulders above most of the other programming on TV.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina A. has mixed the old and the new with this album. Yes, I must admit it takes some repeated listening to like some of her songs here BUT her voice is so beautiful to listen too and worth the listen. Anyone who likes Jazz, Swing, Rhythm and Blues would love this album and does not matter what age you might be, its experimental and I applaud that, their is no other pop princess that can pull it off especially what she does here, neither Jessica Simpson , Britney Spears, Christina Milan so on and so on,have this. There is no substance to those women But Aguliera has it all bit Classy, Wild, Eccentric, even Trashy,  Soulful, and lots of energy that proves her Reinvention the way Madonna did and with NO APOLOGIES. I like Christina but Love her even more now . The photos add on the CD booklet are nice as well kind of like a 40's, 50's pin-up girl the best she has ever looked, complete package can not wait to see what she will do in the future.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw Firefox when it aired.  And when Serenity came in the theaters, I thought it was just another \\"super female weapon\\" movie like the other two coming out about that time (Ultraviolet and Aeon Flux).  Boy was I wrong.   <br />Upon the recommendation of a friend I \\"borrowed\\" the first episode and thought \\"this isn't bad.\\"  Then by the time I watched episode 3 I had to watch all of the episodes.  I proceeded to watch the entire series in 2 days then watch Serenity.  Now I am a huge fan of the series. I then went and bought Firefox the complete series and Serenity so I can watch it all over again.  This is the first series that it pains me to know I'll never see another episode...like the previous review, this is on the level of reading a good book.  Keeps you coming back for more. <br />Why oh why must we watch crap on TV that comes back season after season when a show with such depth is removed before it can finish an entire season?  I am disgusted by the networks and production companies because of this.  Fox mismarketed this series and the production company did the same with the movie.  I never remember hearing about it before my friend told me to watch it.  I would wager to guess that the fan base has grown far larger since the series was cancelled than it was while it aired.  This show had it all.  The only hope of fans everywhere is that if two cartoons can be brought back because of fan support, then maybe we'll see some more of Firefly in the future
B000EULJLU|4.0|10,000 Days (2006.) Tool's fourth album (fifth overall).<br /><br />Yeah, I'm a bit late reviewing this. So be it.<br /><br />Anyway, Tool. Lots of things to describe about this band. They can dish out great epics, have lots of confusing filler that can be intros or not, sometimes normal lengthed rockers, take 5 year abscences between albums (though 'Undertow' and 'Aenima' are just 3 years apart), etc. And now, after the masterpieces 'Aenima' and 'Lateralus', they come back in 2006 after yet another 5 year abscence with '10,000 Days'. It has taken both heavy bashings and praise from fans and critics alike. How does it measure up to 'Undertow', 'Aenima', and 'Lateralus'? Find out.<br /><br />\\"Vicarious\\" is a 7+ minute melodic rocker that we know and love Tool for. It is also the 1st single and big hit off the album. Great lyrics, vocals (though Maynard sounds somewhat raspy but still good in the verses), musicianship and everything else make this opener another Tool masterpiece. \\"Jambi\\" is yet another sophisticated (though less melodic) rocker with Adam Jones' fast opening licks and Maynard's normal show stealing vocal performances. Then, later on in the song, Jones' gives a wonderful talkbox solo! Another awesome song of course, the talkbox solo alone could give that title. What did you expect, really? Now, onto the main epic of the album soon enough... \\"Wings for Marie (Part 1)\\" is very slow, dark and sad. Then in a middle a rocking part comes in. Very progressive indeed. But this is just is a lead-in to... the very, very epic \\"10,000 Days (Wings Part 2)\\". 1 word: WOW. Hardly anything as powerful musically, vocally OR lyrically that I've heard before. Arguably the finest on the album. About Maynard's mother, Judith Marie being in a coma for 10,000 days (yup and that's 27 years! :(), Maynard's lyrics or personal letter (whichever you may call it) are touching as hell. Skipping this 11+ minute masterpiece would be a total sin. Back to the rockin', \\"The Pot\\" is next, which is the current single and my 2nd favorite on the album. With funny lyrics (though they're also serious), Jones' simplisticly soaring riffs and Maynard's again usual vocal delivery, what's not to love? \\"Who are you to wave your finger, so full of it!\\" 2 fairly obvious infamous fillers that Tool are known for are up next, them being the African tribe strangeness of \\"Lipan Conjuring\\" and the noise-driven guitar 3+ minute \\"Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman)\\". These fillers are pretty weak compared to some of the ones on 'Aenima' and most of the ones on 'Lateralus', I'd say. Oh well, \\"Lost Keys\\" is a lead-in to the 2nd true epic of the album, the 11+ minute rocker \\"Rosetta Stoned\\". This one was pretty hard to get into at first, but now I appreciate it. Maynard's robotic, fast paced vocals and fairly weird lyrics may confuze and puzzle the average listener. This song, along with \\"The Pot\\" also has lots of cursing enough to warrant the album a Parental Advisory label, but at least that didn't quite happen. Maynard gives yet other sweet vocal performances outside the verses, and Jones' riffs are still simplistically cool. Danny Carey's drumming is also spot on, especially at the end! \\"Intension\\" is next and is probably the weakest non filler track. First off, it's a bit too down-tempo and offbeat, making it really quiet to hear unless on 50-100% volume. And then, it stays like that pretty much the whole time, creating no build up. Oh well, nice lyrics and decent soothing, creepy vocals from Maynard doesn't make this one completely boring. \\"Right in Two\\" is another personal favorite. It starts off with a nice, mellow riff from Jones that's a bit similar to \\"Schism\\" and then Carey's african like drumming creates a beat along with Maynard's quiet vocals yet again (he's one of my favorite vocalists, that's why I mention him so damn much!). Political but very worthwhile lyrics as well and later on it gets rockin' with another spectacular riff from Jones. Ending it off is another filler that's longer, \\"Viginiti Tres\\". This one stays quiet and noisy at the same time. Not completely pointless though, cause it's been said that there's this trippy experience when you synch it by playing it after \\"Wings for Marie\\" and the title track. Rounds out the album quite well when that is done.<br /><br />Overall: Tool have proved that they still have staying power with '10,000 Days'. Is it as good as 'Aenima' or 'Lateralus'? Not quite, but it's still awesome and equally as good as 'Undertow'. I'm sure we all that have been disappointed or not with this release will equally be looking foraward to Tool's next work of progressive rock/metal genius in the next 5 (or less!) years.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF TOOL, PROGRESSIVE ROCK, METAL, HARD ROCK, ALTERNATIVE AND FANS OF MUSIC IN GENERAL!

B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I own this CD. While listening to it for the 100th time I was enjoying it so much I wanted to share it with a friend who recently had a baby, so I bought one for her. It's a beautiful, emotional and loving album. I am a Celine Dion fan and this album adds a whole new dimension to  her music I recommend it highly to any Celine fan who doesn't already own it. And for any parent who knows the joy of new parenthood. <br />Carole Julius <br />DecoratingTradition.com
B000059Z8J|5.0|Superman is first and foremost the must watch movie for anyone interested in action/adventure action comics heroes.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Thankfully the DVD has been a top seller and everybody (including me) is discovering this gem of a film. Christian Bale is one of our top young actors. Just watch his performances in The Machinist, American Psycho, Batman Begins and one of the best child performances of all time in Empire of the Sun. Everything in this film fits perfectly. The futuristic style, brooding score and unique action scenes are fresh in a genre full of sameness. Equilibrium may bare resemblance to Gattaca and 1984, but it's like those films on steroids. And by the way, Gun Kata is about the coolest style of fighting ever created for a film. I really hope they make Equilibrium 2, but after seeing Ultraviolet (by the same director) I think a sequel will only diminish this already cult classic. They don't need to go The Matrix route.
B000059XUI|5.0|In superman II, not only do you get another great performance by all the returning cast from the first Superman, but you have a really good story about Superman and the legacy that he must carry. Great stuff and while the fight sequences could be done even better these, special effects are a tool to tell the story, which is a really good continuation from the first, the movie really makes you continue to believe
0688172377|5.0|This book is enlightening in more than one way. The description of nomadic life from someone who had lived it is very moving. The details of female genital mutilation makes one's psyche hurt. The details of her life, how she was used and in my opinion abused by her own relatives in England is quite sad. Mostly, I was awed by the fact that she was illiterate for all of her youth, and described herself freely as still not able to read and write properly. I'm sure she's quite literate now, but it wouldn't matter. The story, written by someone else and co-authored by Waris Dirie, is wonderful.
0446677450|2.0|While Mr. Kiyosaki's book is a painless, fast-paced read, most learned investors will find it to be a trail of bread crumbs leading the reader to part with more of their money and recieve little nourishment.  The book's title implies that the road to wealth lies within its pages.  However, Mr. Kiyosaki's message is simple, and should be common sense to those who are financially literate.  \\"The rich make their money work,\\" says Kiyosaki.  In other words, they invest, be in it real estate, stocks, commodities, or one of many other things.  And then they take the money made from the investments and invest it again.  They don't buy boats, Ferraris, or platinum and diamond dental work unless they can afford it many times over.  That is essentially the whole book, with the same idea repeated in slightly different ways.  The rest is anecdotes lacking any real edification.<br /><br />So naturally, you want to know more.  Well, Mr. Kiyosaki has many resources available for you, including a $195 (!!!) board game and a slew of books that supposedly take you closer to the loaf you crave.<br /><br />If you want sound financial education, including detailed theories on beating the market and wisely choosing real estate, there are plenty of low-priced resources to get you started on that path.  If you want to read about people becoming rich, and think advice like \\"Start a business!\\" and \\"You won't have to fix clogged toilets if you use a property manager!\\" will help you, then dive in to the Rich Dad quagmire.  Just don't expect to be a Rich Dad after you slog through it all.<br /><br />If you're a beginning investor, \\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need,\\" by Andrew Tobias will help you get your feet wet and begin formulating an investment strategy, while \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" will teach you how to live a financially comfortable life regardless of income.<br /><br />Kiyosaki is no doubt a tremendous success story; his \\"Rich Dad\\" franchise is proof enough.  But his advice is too diluted and requires too much expenditure of time and money to be a good competitor to solid, straightforward financial help books.  If you want to break into the upper crust from something other than long-term, carefully managed investing, prepare to spend a lot of time, to take serious risks, and to learn and think on a higher level.  This book is fluff compared to what you need to be reading.t his advice is too diluted and requires too much expenditure of time and money to be a good competitor to solid, straightforward financial help books.

B000G759LW|4.0|Okay when I first heard that Christina was coming out with a new album I was pretty psyched. I never got her Stripped CD until like a few months ago and I was really unimpressed with it. I was really shocked when her \\"Dirrty\\" image first came out a few years ago and I kind of lost a little bit of respect for her, to be perfectly honest. It was really overdone and it really turned me off...but looks can be deceiving, as she proved to us all. Then we all saw her new \\"Marilyn Monroe\\" image and I was pleasently surprised. Since I listen to a lot of different types of music I was overjoyed when she said she was taking the retro route, infusing the music of the 20s, 30s, and 40s. The first time I listened to both the CDs I was kind of taken aback, as it wasn't really what I was expecting. In fact, I didn't really didn't know WHAT to expect. It does take a few listens through to fully appreciate the messages she's trying to convey on this album. The CD compiles of two discs and a glossy book filled with pictures and lyrics to all the songs (which I love, because I hate not knowing the lyrics to the songs lol). As with many reviews, both discs are fine, but it could've easily been condensed into one CD without all those side songs. What also kind of surprised me was that she made a huge point that she was the executive producer on this album, as well as co-writing all 23 tracks, giving her further respect as an artist in the music industry. Here are my reviews on the following songs:    Disc One    1. Intro (Back to Basics)~ This starts out kinda funky and then it picks up popish R&Bish. IMO it's a very fantastic way to start out the album. 5/5    2. Makes Me Wanna Pray ~ I kind of have mixed feelings about this song. It has a very nice beat, and of course, her voice is beautiful, but it sounded like a rehash of one of her previous album songs...3/5    3. Back in the Day ~ This song is a start of her retro sound, kind of 60s or 70s-esque sound. Upbeat sound, I like it =) 4/5    4. Ain't No Other Man ~ At first when I heard this song, I didn't really like it. But as I gave it more listens, I loved it and found myself listening to it repeatedly. I think that song has that effect on people. This is the first single that she released a couple months before the album came out, in the music video she gave us a sneak peak on what \\"I Got Trouble\\" sounds like, which was awesome. 5/5    5. Understand ~ This song contains clips from a song by Betty Harris, this song is very jazzy. I didn't really like it too much. 3/5    6. Slow Down Baby ~ This song has a great beat and Christina sounds awesome in it =) 5/5    7. Oh, Mother ~ This is a beautiful song, and you can tell that she put her heart and soul into this song. The emotion of this song is easily one of the best on this disc. 5/5    8. F. U. S. S. ~ lol this is Christina giving an old collaborator (I think?) both middle fingers. Nice beat, but it really wasn't anything special, comical at the very least...2/5    9. On Our Way ~ Very catchy and upbeat song. It starts off slow and record-scratchy. The message is uplifting and gives a very positive outlook on future. 5/5    10. Without You ~ I swear to GOD this sounds like something from Destiny's Child's \\"Survivor\\" album. I didn't like the beat of it then and I don't like it now. =\ 2/5    11. Still Dirrty ~ This song made me laugh out loud, seriously. The beat is very funky and catchy after a couple of listens. She still claims she's Still Dirrty. This is an awesome song, one of my favorites on this disc. 5/5    12. Here to Stay ~ The beginning reminded me a little of \\"Charlie's Angels\\", kind of actiony-ready-to-kick-some-butt-esque theme. Upbeat, and rebelleous Christina at her finest. 4/5    13. Thank You (Dedication to fans...) ~ I didn't care for this track at all. It contained clips of messages people thanking her for the difference she made in their lives. It was heartwarming but a little egocentric of her, I think...2/5    Disc Two1. Enter the Circus ~ I skip this song every time after listening to it the first time. Christina isn't even in this track! lol...it's of a ringleader announcing some stuff...I didn't really pay attention to it. Those of you who are afraid of clowns I would skip this track altogether lol...1/5    2. Welcome ~ This is a song of Christina introducting you to the second disc...it was all right...3/5    3. Candyman ~ Easily the best and strongest song in the second disc. I believe this is going to be her second single. This is very \\"Andrews Sisters\\" style beat, I LOVE IT. The lyrics are so incredibly suggestively dirty...but that's what makes this song so much fun. She also belts really high and long towards the end of the song as its climax. Awesome. My favorite track on this entire album. 5/5    4. Nasty Naughty Boy ~ This is a slow song, very 30s and 40s theme and it has as many suggestive lyrics as the previous track, lol. Awesome track. 5/5    5. I Got Trouble ~ We had a preview of this song in Christina's first single music video \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", it has of a muffled \\"radio\\" sound, to it. Incredibly creative and authentic, except what I kind of wondered was, even though her voice was radio muffled, the music was crisp lol. Even still, very awesome song. 5/5    6. Hurt ~ This is her power ballad of this disc. Absolutely beautiful and her voice shines incredibly throughout this song. An absolutely favorite and possible single in the future? 5/5    7. Mercy On Me ~ This song is very jazzy and begging for forgiveness for all of the sins she committed. It's an all right song, I suppose...3/5    8. Save Me From Myself ~ Very slow song, absolutely beautiful. I think her voice was the best in this song. She definately showed all her soft dynamics on her voice. Absolutely beautiful. 5/5    9. The Right Man ~ This is her song dedicating to her husband, Jordan Bratman, very nice. I like it, nice beat and her voice sounds beautiful as always. 4/5    Overall, 3.78, so I'llround it up to 4 stars. There we a few misses in this album, but it's overall a very impressive album by Christina. I wonder what she'll surprise us with next...
B00008BXJG|1.0|Well everyone, Paperback Writer is wrong. This album is not good at all. AC/DC are one of the worst bands along with The Beatles and don't make good decent music. Their lead singers just scream. Touch Too Much is just an awful joke just like all their other songs which are lousy. Ignore the awful Paperback Writer from India and get Inside Information from Foreigner insted. <br />
B000G759LW|5.0|I was a little unsure about how I would feel about this album. I love Christina Aguilera, her voice is awsome, I just wasn't sure about the way that the album was going to sound. After listening to it though, I was really happy with it. I'll admit that it did take some getting used to because of the difference between this and \\"Stripped\\". But, after I listened to it a few times, I really like it! <br /> <br />I'm not surprised though because Christina is such a talented singer in my opinion. I think that she could easily stick around for quite a while (unlike some others that are around today).
B000002H97|1.0|This is it!! Metallica were one of the most overrated bands of all time. They only made 1 decent song in 'Orion'. Every of their other songs just sound the same. The Black Album was a really lousy album which had some of the lousiest songs in NOTHING ELSE MATTERS, and THROUGH THE NEVER. I mean James Hetfield just screams, he can't sing at all. Don't buy any album from this band. They are lousy.

B000FA57N0|4.0|Serenity HD DVD is an excellent disc to demo the HD format to friends and relatives; especially chapters 5 and 15.  The picture quality is razor-sharp and detailed throughout, nearly 3-D in its effect at times.  The audio quality gives your home system a workout with thundering bass and excellent use of surrounds throughout the movie.  If you want to experience HD DVD at its best buy this disc. Great sci-fi storyline, too.
B000002UAI|5.0|It's true that in first glance Beatles For Sale might seem like a step back from the excellent and highly successful A Hard Day's Night, which was penned entirely by the Beatles themselves; Beatles For Sale is often uneven and inconsistent, filled with some odd covers, and in those ways is more remindful of their previous album With The Beatles. It's also true that Beatles For Sale was made in a bit of a hurry, and at times it shows. But these observations are all skin-deep. Further listening will show that not only is Beatles For Sale an important transitional step in the band's constant process of development and change, which led to the great Help! and from there to the timeless masterpieces Rubber Soul and Revolver - it's also an integral step forward from A Hard Day's Night, and is one of the strongest albums of the Beatles' early period, i.e. the Touring Period. <br /> <br />As I've already mentioned, the cover choices on the album don't always make absolute sense; it's also worth mentioning that in contrast to With The Beatles and Please Please Me, the Lennon/McCartney songwriting team is by now skillful enough for the original songs to be much stronger than the covers, and so the Beatles included these albums not due to lack of confidence in their own songs - they have already produced an album of original material only - but to fill some time, and more importantly to add variety. Indeed, even though the covers are the weaker songs on the album, they add some different flavors to the listening experience and make it more dynamic and more engaging. The strongest of the bunch is John Lennon's excellent interpretation of Chuck Berry's Rock N' Roll Music, which is as much a rock n' roll anthem as Berry's original; it's reminiscent of the very first days of the Beatles, and especially of George Harrison's Roll Over Beethoven. Ringo Starr's version of Carl Perkins' Honey Don't is cheeky and energetic, and remains one of Ringo's strongest vocal appearances. Merit could also be found in the beautiful Mr. Moonlight (excellent vocals by Lennon), in the pretty cover of Buddy Holly's Words Of Love, and to a lesser degree in Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby and the Little Richard medley (which may be one of the best samples we have of how the Beatles must have sounded in concert). <br /> <br />But in their own compositions, Lennon and McCartney really broke new ground on this album, in ways that are subtle but important. It's certainly darker and bleaker than the charming boy-band pop/rock of A Hard Day's Night. The Beatles sound somewhat tired of the superstar status that was at its peak in A Hard Day's Night; it shows in the cover photo beyond a doubt that the Beatles were no longer that interested in being cute. It shows in the slight and subtle sarcasm in the album's title. And it shows in the songs much more. Of the latter day albums, Beatles For Sale best resembles the White Album - there's none of the flower power of 1967 here, but there is some of the bitterness and world weariness of 1968. It shows best of all in John's I'm A Loser, which is one of the best compositions and vocal performances from the pre-1965 Beatles. In spite of the rather traditional rockabilly tune, the self-loathing and depression in the lyrics cannot be ignored; and the lyrics are by far deeper and better than anything Lennon had written before. <br /> <br />Baby's In Black is another great one; this song is interesting musically too, with a six-eighths beat that was rare in rock n' roll in those days. The lyrics are also excellent; even if Lennon's poetry still focused on love and relationships, he was now dealing with relationships much more complex and realistic than the boy meets girl, boy loses girl of the first three albums. Paul on the other hand hands in the beautiful ballad I'll Follow the Sun, which is not quite as catchy as And I Love Her but it's much more daring in its minimalism and intimacy, and sounds entirely sincere. I Don't Want ToSpoil The Party, What You're Doing and No Reply all deal with rejection and depression in a more mature manner than ever before, even if the music isn't quite as complex and mature as the 1966-1967 work. And even the cutesy single Eight Days a Week is well-worth a listen, with its terrific fade-in intro that had since became a classic, and with the upbeat music and lyrics that serve as contrast for the rest of the album. <br /> <br />Beatles For Sale is by no means a place to start your Beatles collection, but it's a good step along the way, and for experienced listeners - many of whom have long ago rejected the earlier albums in favor of the post-Help! material, it deserves multiple listening, and with a keener ear. <br /> <br />Oh, and sorry about that lousy pun in the title - couldn't think of anything else to write.
B00004T6V4|5.0|Still Crazy is very special to me. In 1998, my girlfriend showed up with a VHS copy of the movie, and it immediately became a favorite. The year before, the band with which I had worked in the '70s, had just done a 12 week reunion which, had disintegrated into thin air just as I was preparing to record them for the live CD they never got to do during their first incarnation (no name-dropping here, but they did have 3 major label studio releases). Needless to say, the film struck a chord with me....a very intense \\"power chord\\".<br /><br />  I was not a \\"computer-active\\" individual then and I could not find the music anywhere, so I took the movie and recorded the audio onto mini-disc and edited together as much as I could (sometimes only pieces of a song). As soon as I was able, I purchased the soundtrack CD, and have actually given it away and replaced it 3 times!!<br /><br />  Jimmy Nail's voice is pure magic (the guy really ought to form a band!!!), and the vibe of the project in general is as moving and authentic as Spinal Tap and The Rutles were funny. If you don't enjoy this album (and yeah, the movie made me sniffle a bit too), then you wouldn't have enjoyed the '70s music scene very much.<br /><br />  And oh, by the way......my guy's did reunite again in 2005, and we did that live CD.......The Flame Still Burns!!!!!!!!<br /><br />  Edgar
B000G759LW|3.0|I agree with others in that I really wanted to like this CD, but it hasn't happend yet.  <br /> <br />\\"Ain't No Other Man,\\" and \\"Candy Man\\" are spectacular and as hot as anything Christina has ever done, but so far the rest of the two discs just seem to sit there. <br /> <br />If she wants to a retro albumn, why not just cover the best of Etta James or Aretha Franklin. That's where she shines.
B00097A5HW|4.0|Shakira is brilliant.  Not only does she produce and write her own material, she sings in what I describe as the music business female sex's most unique bleat.  Usually my reviews come from a third person perspective (since any critic knows that's the best way to approach a review), but it's hard to describe Shakira's musings without inserting my personal feelings and opinions toward and about it.  \\"La Tortura\\" is the biggest hit here, of course, and deservedly so.  It's simply the best Latin pop song to come along in a long time.  The beat, the poetic lyrics and that voice all combine to produce one awesome track.  Fijacion Oral is a mismash of genres and, unfortunately, only a couple songs can even come close to approaching the instant smash \\"La Tortura\\" is.  Opener \\"En Tus Pupilas\\" (featured on the later Oral Fixation album in English) is decent and sounds somewhat European.  \\"La Pared\\" is one of Fijacion's better moments.  \\"Las De La Intuicion\\" is the record's second best track with its disco-infused melody and charge-forward beat.  \\"Lo Imprescindible\\" use of thundering drums adds rock flavor to Fijacion while \\"Dia De Enero\\" is girlish fun.  Though I prefer the English language Oral Fixation to the Spanish Fijacion Oral, with each listen this record just keeps getting better and better.
B00009027B|5.0|This is My Dying Bride's masterwork. From beginning to end, the power and melodrama is perfectly evident, and even displays shades of the epic sense they derive as fans of Dead Can Dance. His voice is not as assured as it is with later releases, but the emotion and despair is palpable. This is in my top ten in ANY genre. Some have complained about the guitar sound in the production, but, trust me, you get over it by the second track. If you don't own it, buy it, and find out what all the cool chaps on your block are talking about.
B000G759LW|4.0|There's no doubt whatsoever that Christina can sing.  She may not be as distinctive as, say, Mariah or as timeless (as of yet) as some of the old-school jazz and R&B legends like Ella she's trying to emulate on this record, but the girl has one of the best voices in today's music business.  Her new album is a double disc dedicated to the classic singers of jazz and R&B.  For the most part Basics really takes flight, heard in songs like current smash \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" (the fake trumpets sound a little hollow but they don't detract much from the track) and the incredibly addictive '50s radio jingle-influenced \\"Candyman,\\" and Christina's singing abilities are in fine form here.  Basics leans heavy on ballads (which really showcase this fine performer's amazing voice), and overall these types of songs are good.  \\"Save Me From Myself\\" is a soothing, sexy and sweltering ballad dedicated to husband Bratman.  Hauntingly beautiful \\"Hurt\\" is a slow piano ballad with a great chorus.  The album has its forgettable tracks too, but these moments are produced well so they don't sound as bland as they really are.  In the end, Christina hits and misses, but still manages to put out a record that is memorable, unique and likable.
0393327655|4.0|The End of Faith is a courageous call for radical change in our society--we must turn away from traditional god-based religion.  Any religion with a god is going to have a Book, and that book will undoubtedly pit neighbor against neighbor by threatening, cajoling, and hoodwinking its readers. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this diatribe; and although polemical, its content is quite thoughtful.  I wholeheartedly agree with NYT reviewer Natalie Angier as quoted on the book's cover:  \\"The End of Faith articulates the dangers and absurdities of organized religion so fiercely and so fearlessly that I felt relieved as I read it, vindicated, almost personally understood.\\" <br /> <br />Quite cleverly, Harris points points out that religious \\"moderates\\" are a significant problem--not just the fundamentalists.  They provide shelter for the crazies, and they seem to realize that many tenets of their religions are embarrassingly passe.  After all, fundamentalists (while absurd) are actually following what their Book says!  Those who are too afraid of what their friends might say (moderates) pick and choose the doctrines they decide they'll follow. <br /> <br />Just a personal criticism.  I was uninterested in chapters six and seven, maybe because I just wanted more of what I'd seen in the first chapters.  The important point to take in those two chapters is that being good, ethical people should be the goal of our existence--we do not need a Bible- or Koran- based set of life teachings to help us stave off personal anarchy.  In fact, Harris seems to say, baseless, 14th century beliefs will only hinder our abilities to solve the real problems facing our civilization today.
B000G759LW|5.0|wow....she still got it.... <br />This woman's voice STILL gives me the chills... <br />  <br />all it took was one listen to \\"Right Man\\" <br /> <br />unbelieveable...she still got it after so long. I honestly thought she could never outdo 'Stripped': boy was i WRONG.  <br /> <br />Listen for yourself. I won't blab much or select which songs you should listen to...go cop it. i need not say more.
630027179X|5.0|I must have watched this film a few dozen times after seeing it in 1981.  The worst setting I ever saw it was in Palo Alto in 1981 when a group of Stanford frats kept laughing at everything they saw and heard.  I guess they thought they were viewing the Monty Python version.  (Which I saw in 1975 and laughed my head off at too).  But I digress.    If this film were made today, I am would be happier with it because today, films are just longer.  And that is what this film needed, more time in development.  While I sucked up every bit of imagery and word, I was painfully aware of great jumps in tale telling that left the viewer with too many \\"how did we get here.\\"  And the corniest moment of all is the \\"tah dah\\" music when Authur pulls the sword from the stone.  With all its faults, this is the best film on the subject made yet.    Nicol Williams saves the day with his very Tolkienish rendering of Merlin.  As an actual friend of the late J.R.R. Tolkein (a name that inspires other so-called fantasy authors names - J. K... something) Williams uses a lot of Middle Earth vision in his role so that I felt as if perhaps Tolkien himself was playing the part as he might have.  \\"It is a time for men and their ways,\\" and other Gandlaf like speech is peppered throughout his dialogue.  No doubt, Tolkien was thinking of Merlin when he gave Gandalf his voice.  The intertwining that Williams brings to this film is not a mistake in any way; Tolkien's tale was his own \\"other than Authurian\\" epoch in the medieval style by intention.  That Nicol Willliams was a friend of the venerable old professor who once recorded a four volume lp spoken word version of \\"The Hobbit\\" long before \\"Books on Tape\\" was ever thought of adds to his credentials for this role rather than takes away from it.  I can't imagine any other actor ever playing Merlin.  But that helmet was a little confusing.    I would have loved to see the film go an hour longer and show why the Grail was vital to the plot.  I am sure Boorman has the intellectual capacity to do it.  I would have really enjoyed seeing some of the battles and negotiations that led to the union of the land under a just king.  This and other things would have shown us why the sword was important and why the three queen/goddesses would carry Authur away to Avalon.  To do this would have necessitated a journey into the very Pagan roots of Christian thinking - especially in medieval times.  The public was not ready for it then, and perhaps never will be, but with a new version of the Wicker Man coming out soon, there will perhaps be a new interest in more serious investigations via film of some of the deeper aspects of European Culture.  (But in the case of the Wicker Man, one hopes the filmgoer will dig up a copy of the genuine 1973 film, not this honker!)    Excalibur inspired me to actually read Mallory.  I became a collector and reader of history and lore until now almost 30 years later I have a deep and still growning interest in all of the history, legends and myths of Europe.  One of the most fascinating is the question of Mary Magdalene's possible presence in Europe.  I have been in those regions including visits to Rennes-le-Chateau and Montsegur.  And one of the greatest moments for me was when my wife and I drove through a series of Aude River gorges in the Pyrennes named \\"The Gorges of Saint George.\\"  I could blame this film at least in part for my own quest that took me there.  Yet these are the kind of things that make a meaningful life.  At least in my opinion.  The illumination of knoweldge with the living presence of historical evidence is a thrill for some.  Espescially when you are exploring the lesser treaded histories.    I write all of this for the young reader to show how all of these things can connect.  A film can be an inspiration.  Excalibur was like LOTR a great inspiration to me.  I think this film is at least a minor classic.
B000G759LW|2.0|I was eagerly awaiting the drop of this cd, only to find that this is not the Christina I know, love, and can sing along with.  I lovelovelove every one of her albums, but this one is simply a total letdown.  As previous reviewers have stated, she's got the voice, the look, etc., but she's got no hits on this album, I'm afraid. <br />Christina, get back to the Top 40 music that we love to listen to, sing to, that inspires us to get up and dance, even if we're mid-thirties-mamas!
0671510991|5.0|It's impressive that most of the bad ratings of this book comes from people that haven't read it and are opposite to Kissinger political views and acts. Sad thing, they are missing an excelent book. <br /> <br />Of course, Mr. Kissinger's actuation, especially during Nixon Administration, was very debatable, but this book has to be read in spite of that and without prejudices. <br /> <br />Kissinger views on Diplomacy is lucid and focuses in the main characters that shaped the world History and how it influences the politics of their times. Also interesting is the comparision between Leaders of different periods, like Wilson in the end of the World War I and the leaders at the end of Napoleonic Wars. His style is easy to follow even for a long book as this one. Kissinger's contribution to the Historiography of the subject is fantastic and totally recommendable.
B000G759LW|5.0|This album is honestly packed with some of the best music I have heard in a while. You can tell Christina put her heart and soul into this album and that she stayed true to herself.  The lyrics are meaninful and the music is beautiful.  Christina really is a true artist with the most powerful and amazing voice in my lifetime. <br /> <br />The album is packed with it all from the sound of old blues and jazz with songs like \\"I Got Trouble\\" and \\"Candyman\\" to more old school Christina with songs like \\"Still Dirrty\\" and \\"Slow Down Baby\\".  Honestly, you will love this album.  It's packed with over 20 songs, and it's definitely worth the money.  I cannot wait to see what she has in store for her tour.  Baby Jane is on her way to becoming a legend.  =)
020530902X|5.0|When I first decided I wanted to write a series of historical fiction I was fairly confident of my subject matter as it has been a passion throughout my life, but - and this was a big \\"but\\" - I had never written anything before other than business reports. I set about trying to learn the craft of writing from various \\"how to\\" books I borrowed from the library or bought in the local bookstore. These were all helpful to varying degrees, but one dog-eared volume that my wife presented to me (she is an ex-magazine editor in chief) stands out. Yes, it was \\"The Elements of Style\\", an amazing little book packed full of useful, practical advice for anyone who wants to ensure clarity of communication. I particularly found the tips in the chapter \\"An Approach to Style\\" useful:-<br /><br />1. Place yourself in the background<br /><br />2. Write in a way that comes naturally<br /><br />3. Work from a suitable design<br /><br />4. Write with nouns and verbs<br /><br />5. Revise and rewrite<br /><br />6. Do not overwrite<br /><br />7. Do not overstate<br /><br />8.

B0002XL35G|5.0|Paris Texas:  It does not matter which Paris comes to mind at the mention of the city because it is an etheral illusion which binds European<br /><br />and American cities, alike.<br /><br />I have seen this movie several times.  I have just seen the DVD of Paris, Texas.  Wenders' running commentary confirmed what I'd always thought: The dialogue between Travis on Jane is the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Perhaps, I am a bit overly cerebral and analytical, but I do not thing it is insignificant Travis shows up in Terlingua, that is \\"Ter\\", (three) \\"lingua\\", (tongue).<br /><br />There are three tongues at play in life, not just Travis' life; the (first) unspoken tongue of action without words, the (second) tongue of illusion, that is one's altered<br /><br />view of reality, and then, the (third) tongue of the real/healing, understanding, peace and reconciliation.  Incidentally, there is a strong similiarity between<br /><br />the english word \\"language\\" and the spanish \\"lengua\\" for \\"tongue\\".<br /><br />A speechless (first tongue) Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) emerges from the southwest Texas desert to collapse and awaken under the care of the local doctor in Terlingua.  What soon becomes apparent to Travis once he is reunited with civilization and his brother's family and his son in Los Angeles is that he must find his ex-wife.<br /><br />Before doing so, the humbled Travis accepts the maid's (Socorro Valdez) counsel on how he must not only look like a father, but be a father to his son, Hunter<br /><br />No.  This is not a \\"I'll-get-my-gun-and. . .\\" all too common, cheap, mindless storyline.  It is the story of a man who has \\"come around\\" to see the indulgence and<br /><br />consequences of his own warped illusion of love and jealousy in his marriage to Jane (Nastassja Kinski).<br /><br />This illusion (second tongue), or deception of self, is revealed by Travis to his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell) to break his reticence.  He shows Walt a picture of Paris Texas he has treasured for years.  It is a picture of a vacant lot.  A purchase made by Travis in his quest to discover and connect with his<br /><br />origins.  Paris is, his parents told him, where he was conceived.<br /><br />Paris Texas is about the game of illusion people play for their amusement and sometimes at the expense of others.  Certainly, it was Travis' father's amusement growing up when he would engage people and allow them to spin their own web at his mention of having met his wife in Paris; _ Ahh, Europe, Paris, the beautiful city, the place of dreams, romance, love, relationships.  Then he would drop the other shoe, _ Texas, ha ha.<br /><br />Illusion took an ugly, bitter, mean turn for Travis compounded by his drunkeness.  Believing his wife to be unfaithful with other men he would bind her to deprive<br /><br />her of her dignity and freedom.<br /><br />None of this, the illusion, or second tongue, is part of the movie.  It is recounted in the form of a vague, impersonal narrative, \\"I knew these people\\", on the phone across a one-way mirror to the beautiful Nastassja Kinski, Travis' ex-wife in Houston.  Interestingly, there's no whining, pinning or palming the mirror or a longing to reunite.  Travis shows no desire to see her, only to talk.  This (third tongue) is the heart of Paris Texas.<br /><br />Wenders has done a masterful job with this box-office flop, internationally critically acclaimed movie.  In its aftermath came a string of siblings-cross-country-trek<br /><br />movies and commercials such as Rain Man and Budweiser commercials of greedy people begrudging their last beer to the thirsty soul at their door. Five years<br /><br />later Claire Denis, Wenders' Assistant Director gave us her own materpiece, Chocolat.<br /><br />Although decidedly of American culture I found much of my Mexican heritage in Paris Texas.  Particularly, the recurring, \\"Cancion Mixteca\\" melody which could<br /><br />as well be Agustin Lara's, \\"Se Me Hizo Facil\\", \\"It seemedeasy\\".  There's a line in the former which could well summarize Travis' life:  \\"Oh, that I would<br /><br />die of loneliness\\".  The latter seems even closer to Travis:  \\"I abandoned her because it was the thing to do.  It seemed easy\\", only to gulp his bitterness later.<br /><br />Ry Cooder's raw acoustic steel trembling slide evokes the trembling, sliding descent into chaos by those who cuddle illusion.  Alas, their illusion has become<br /><br />reality.<br /><br />I expect Paris Texas will re-emerge some time in the future to be appreciated for the so-unamerican, beautiful, slow-pace story of human interaction, tragedy,<br /><br />sacrifice, selflessness, humility, acceptance, reconciliation and peace.  It is a warm movie and an eye-opener for those whose default course of action in relationships gone awry is violence.  If the recent reviews found here are any indication I'd say a movement has begun!<br /><br />The movie script is the work of Sam Shephard.

B0000019PA|2.0|This album was recommended to me by several different sources, including Amazon and my local record store, which had \\"mandatory indie classic\\" in a sticker on the disc.  I tried it out a couple of times and Mangum's voice just takes away from everything else for me.  I just could not get into this \\"experience\\" and traded the disc back in.  I agree with the reviewer who says this is not for everybody.  If you can get over the vocals, by all means enjoy this album.  As for me, the vocals were just too much, or maybe not enough.

3895089281|5.0|The book is basically one-of-a-kind and that alone should give it some due respect.  You will come away knowing more about shoes and their manufacture than you ever thought possible.  However, if you ever visit Vass in Budapest for a fitting, don't expect them to follow the lengthy steps outlined in the book for having custom shoes made.  They won't.  How quickly (and simply) you are measured will come as a great surprise.  That said, you will still be stunned at the beautiful (and perfect fitting) shoes that you will receive. And through the book you'll be clear on how they came about. <br /> <br />HIghly recommended for the clothes horse.
B000EGCITG|5.0|i haven't heard the whole album. i found this album in my ipod yesterday and had no idea where it came from, or even known that pink had a new album. i haven't listened to any of her stuff since her debut, and am not all that passionate about her. but the reason i felt compelled to review and gave it 5 stars is because 1) i didn't want to be unfair since i haven't heard the entire thing, and 2) because of the accidental listen to the track \\"dear mr. president\\", which literally moved me to tears. that doesn't happen often, for me. the lyrics strike a chord somewhere, and i've had the track on repeat since yesterday.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I'll just cut right to the point, because, based on the number of stars I've given this album, I assume that you'll be able to tell how much I liked it. <br /> <br />Vicarious - The CD opens with the most Tool-like riff you'll ever find, followed by a different sort of fast paced energy that was unfamiliar to me at first.  I'm not used to Danny doing REAL drum beats, but a series of fills to tie the melody together.  It grew on me quickly.  10/10 <br /> <br />Jambi - At first, this was my favorite song on the CD, because of the almost incomprehensible direction of the song.  My only true complaint is that during the interlude/talkbox solo, the backround music (and even the guitar itself) sounds too simple.  However, the last ninety seconds are some of Tool's best.  10/10 <br /> <br />Wings for Marie (pt. 1) - Unfortunately, this song is identical in nearly every way to the next, so I just tie it right into 10,000 Days.  7/10 <br /> <br />10,000 Days - This is the song that truly surprised me on this CD.  The build up doesn't lead to much that we didn't hear ion the previous song, so I get a little turned off by that.  Otherwise, I love the fact that Tool finally did a swing style song, because for a rock band, they can really pull it off.  9/10 <br /> <br />The Pot - I flat out hated this song at first.  It grew on me quite a bit, but not enough for me to give it the highest rating, because really, it's just a heavy song, similar to Ticks and Leeches, in a complicated time signature.  The scream at the end, however, is excellent. 9/10 <br /> <br />Lipan Conjuring - This song feels mysteriously connected to the album in some way, though I can't figure it out, I always listen to it. 6/10 <br /> <br />Lost Keys (Blame Hoffman) - This is a Tool build up at its best.  If you actually listen to the lyrics underneath the music (which is hard sometimes) you'll realize that there's a lot going on in this song that ties into the next. 8/10 <br /> <br />Rosetta Stoned - This song is where Tool truly shines.  If Lateralus had a problem, it was that the songs that were over ten minutes long were boring and repetitive.  This song, over eleven minutes, doesn't fall into any category but exciting and unpredictable.  Chancellor's bass lines truly capture that talent of Tool's musicianship, and his improvement in  the band since Aenima marks a rise of thoughtfulness driving the power that each member holds.  10/10 <br /> <br />Intension - Another build up to a good song, but not as well done.  Once again, it seemed long just for the sake of being long.  6/10 <br /> <br />Right in Two - This song's verse, chorus, and guitar lines all blend into one symbiotic melody.  The only fault is that it gets boring after hearing songs earlier on the CD that kept you on the edge of your seat.  The musical interlude five minutes through is amazing.  9/10 <br /> <br />Viginti Tres - Like Faip, the CD ends with a series of noises, whose meaning is known only by the band themselves. 5/10 <br /> <br />All in all, this CD is incredible.  I love every minute of it, but I hate that this may be Tool's final album.  My only complaint is that it didn't fall far from the Lateralus tree.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|This is a love it or hate it kind of film.  I love the style, the story, the acting, and cinematography.  I was mesmerized. I hate to put it in too good a light, because it will then not be the pleasant surprise that it could be (to some).  If you liked Matrix, give this a try.
0307263118|5.0|This is a beautiful book in content and enclosed in a very appealing cover.It is extremely sensitive and honest, not without wit.

B000G759LW|3.0|finally finished listening to both of these discs&they both have there moments,but yet something is missing. that Problem is the Soul. Yes She can Sing,but sometimes her instrument overrides her presentation&what she is trying to say. I respect the fact that she has a true love for alot of Yesteryear's Greats,but she hasn't been able to fully bring that emotion all the way out. both sides have about 5-6 cuts that work&the rest are filler in places. the bottom line this could have been a tight Single disc,but at this point this is a big bloated for two discs. She still doesn't have that One song,but she is making more progress as a Artist with each release. time will tell if the Etta James vibe She shadowing shall come to pass,but at this point while she has become more polished&has gotten better she still hasn't come with that \\"At Last\\" Torch song that will place her with all of the influences whom she is trying to Channel.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I've always been super-squeamish and somewhat of a morality critic when it comes to movies, but, for me, the test of a truly GREAT film is if I can't help but watch it in spite of the over-the-top violence, vulgarity, gore and rampant immorality.  It's my guilty pleasure.  Scarface is simply a film masterpiece.  (Shhh.  Don't tell anyone I said that!)  :) It also takes me back to remembering that early 80s feeling in Miami that I experienced firsthand, having spent at least half of my formative years there in the 70s and 80s.  Last, about Al Pacino -- you just can't take your eyes off the man in this film.  He's unbelievable.  Ciao.

The underlying message for making money is to treat employees badly and don't worry about personal ethics.  <br /> <br />Examples, the authors first enterprise was a comic book library using magazines that were unsold and should have been thrown out. Another story suggests buying low priced property when sold for unpaid taxes. <br /> <br />Rich Dad looks down as employees and figures why pay them well, since they will not use the money wisely. From the description of his house he doesn't spend money on family either.
B00008PX8P|5.0|For all those of us who were disappointed with \\"The Song Remains the Same\\", and had longed for something better, this set is the one we have long awaited.  The 70's-era picture and sound appear to have been cleaned up as much as is technically possible, and the result is the definitive Led Zeppelin live compilation.  In addition to the improved sound and picture quality, the performances are vastly superior to TSRTS, without all the annoying \\"fantasy\\" sequences.  This is Zep at full speed, and while some of the selections may be a bit overlong, it is nonetheless a superbly entertaining look at one of the most dynamic bands of all time.  Plant and Page are as flashy as ever, the rhythm section of Jones and Bonham is in excellent form throughout, and one cannot view this set without a renewed sense of awe at the tremendous musicianship of the late John Bonham.  It is a good value, and well worth buying for many repeat viewings.  We had to wait quite a while for this one to be released, but it was worth every second.  Highly recommended.
B000FFJ85I|5.0|As I'm sure your probably aware, there seems to a many AFI fans who hated Sing the Sorrow, which ironically was there most commericially successful album. Decemberunderground probably won't please those fans, in my estimate at least. On the other hand, if you liked and appreciated Sing the Sorrow, I have no doubt you will fall in love with Decemberunderground. It may take a few listens to like. But once you like it, you won't put anything else in your CD player for awhile. Its that good. I've had it my cd rotation for months now.<br /><br />The thing I really appreciate about the album is that it offers a little something for everyone. You have harder, edgier tracks like Kill Caustic and Affliction, and even Miss Murder(to some degree), which are amazing in their own right. But the real beauty of the album lies elsewhere. Tracks that show off Davey's voice and the bands lighter sound, are amazing.  The Interview, The Killing Light, and Love Like Winter are perfect examples of a newer style AFI has addopted.  The album even has some techno influences, which is no suprise since Davey has admitted he likes techno. I welcome that sound. Prelude 12/21 as and example, has a awesome vibe to it.<br /><br />Give this album a chance. Go into it with a open mind, because its a great ride. Take this album for what it is.  Its not Black Sails, and it's not The Art of Drowning. But its a damn good album, and easily one of my favorite albums this year. And its a damn fine addition to the AFI archives.
B000G759LW|5.0|I have to admit, it took more than two listens to get into this album, but it was well worth effort. I could have done without a few tracks (On Our Way, Without You, Here to Stay, Thank You), but overall, there are plenty of potential radio hits and memorable tracks. I don't think Christina really reached her goal of a \\"concept album.\\" Most of the songs are retro, but they harken back to the 70's or early 90's more so than to the 20's, 30's, and 40's. The only tracks that sound obviously like songs from the target era sound a little like what someone who doesn't know much about that kind of music thinks it should sound like, like \\"Candy Man\\" and \\"I Got Trouble.\\" Either way, the song \\"Understand\\" alone is worth the price of the double-disc.    Stand out tracks:    Understand  Slow Down Baby  Still Dirrty  Nasty Naughty Boy  Hurt  Save Me From Myself    Also, make sure to get the physical copy of the CD because the booklet is the best I've ever seen.
B0000028RR|5.0|Ah, how can you describe Rage? I will in one word, Briliance.  Its hard to belive this album came out in 1992, 14 years ago. Wow. Listening to it today, it still blows away pretty much everything on the scene today. This album started it all. It really did, RATM only released 3 albums in the 90's and they are easily one of the most powerful and influential bands from that decade.<br /><br />Onto the album, this album is easily one of the greatest albums of the 90s in my book. Easy. Every song on this album is powerful, and infused with energy. Frontmant Zach is known for being a perfectionist, and while that certainly delays albums and makes for long waits inbetween, it also produces some incredible music.<br /><br />Tom , Brad and Tim have to be one of the best trio's in all of music. Looking at all the albums they have been apart of, they are truly special. They just have that chemistry and the flow they have when the start jaming is unbelievable. If you've seen them live, you know what I'm talking about. They sound better and crisper live than on the album. Its actually hard to imagine that this is the first album by these guys. It sounds so polished and so fluid, they already seem like vets of the industry. Tom Morello is also one of the greatest guitarists in the history of music. Without question. There is a reason why they put on the back of th e cd that all sounds on the album are real and not electronic or mixed. Morello always amazes me with what he can do with the guitar, and he is still going at it 14 years later. Kudos tom.<br /><br />Also, the chemistry of the band and Zach also is amazing. As much as I love Audioslave(and Cornell), nothing really matches the intensity and fire that Rage has. When Zach starts doing his thing, he sings/raps with such power and emotion. Just listen to him, and listen to what he is saying. All these songs mean something to him, and he is passionate about that. All of this is what makes Rage truly special. And this album delivers it all in spades.<br /><br />Looking at this album, if you didn't know what songs belonged on which albums, it could be a best of cd. Killing in the Name is obviously the biggest and most sucessful song on the album. But then you have Wake Up, Bombtrack, Know Your Enemy, Take the Power Back, Bullet in The Head, Freedom...all of those songs are incredible.<br /><br />If your looking to get into Rage, start here and work your way towards Battle of Los Angeles...and then Renegades(good stuff, but hard to get into, all covers). Each album is fantastic, but this is the album that starts it all. I can't imagine any of you not knowing what Rage sounds like, and if you have heard them and are intrigued, go buy this album. It won't dissapoint.s.    Looking at this album, if you didn't know what songs belonged on which albums, it could be a best of cd.

B0009WFFS6|5.0|The boys go way out of their way to recognize one another throughout this show, particularly Ginger Baker and Jack Bruce in their undisguised attempt to shower praise on bandmate, Eric Clapton, and all with great justification.  These three gents defined the power trio and their ability to fill the Hall with some of the best rock and roll/blues for their brief reunion shouldn't be missed by anyone who truly loves the genre. <br /> <br />Clapton's mastery of the electric guitar is undeniable as his seemingly effortless frolicking up and down the neck of his Strat even has his bandmates looking on with admiration. <br /> <br />Video and sound is excellent and the overall quality of this DVD is amongst the best.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Eric Clapton, Cream and really good bluesy rock n roll.

6300216365|5.0|I HAVE TO AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE REVIEWER: \\"MKSONIC50\\". I READ HIS REVIEW OF \\"PLAY IT AGAIN SAM\\" THE SCENE WHERE WOODY ALLEN TRIES TO BE COOL AND COMPOSED WHEN INTRODUCED TO A LADY AND HE, INSTEAD OF SOUNDING ANYTHING LIKE ENGLISH, ONLY GROWLS.  <br />   I RECENTLY FOUND OUT ABOUT THIS MOVIE BECAUSE ALL I COULD THINK WAS OF THAT SCENE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM.  <br />I HAVE TO REPEAT THAT: \\"MKSONIC50\\" IS RIGHT ON THE MONEY. THAT WAS THE BEST COMICAL SCENE EVER. <br />
B000ETQRCM|2.0|The title really says it all.  It's nothing special.  Those who hailed it as some sort of \\"return to form\\" haven't listened to early PJ enough.  That's not to say there aren't *some* redeeming qualities here, but it's an extremely inconsistent effort that, in the end, wasn't worth the wait or the hype.
B000059HB7|5.0|This is the greatest movie ever.<br /><br />As a classical film buff I keep asking myself what are the 5 or 10 best movies. Rio Bravo is always among my top 5 for sure, but I can't make up my mind about the order. Yesterday, August 15, having one of those days when I can't get in the mood of reading and feeling so tired that I just wanted to sit back and relax without necessarily falling asleep, I browsed through my collection of classics and finally picked this one up. Instinctively I was picking the one that is the answer to my doubts. Yes, this is the best. I can't tell why. It just gave phisically and mentally tired self what it longed for.<br /><br />But if I have to pin point, there is Dean Martin as the Borrach&oacute;n, acting wonderfully. Ricky Nelson as himself (not acting) also wonderful. Then, of course, the Duke, what can you say?! But Angie Dickinson... goodness! she is lovable to the extreme. How can anybody not fall in love with her?<br /><br />Oh, and the music, and the 2 songs that Dean and Ricky sing together with the guitar... beautiful \\"my rifle, pony and me\\", absolutely wonderful, that mood, those voices...<br /><br />No. I haven't forgotten. Indeed. on purpose I have left for last Mr. Walter Brennan. This man is a true icon, a character bigger than the screen that tries to frame him. He is the best secondary actor in the history of film-making. But secondary is not a fair description for him because he is absolutely the star of every movie he's in. God, was he a good actor! Old Stumpy.<br /><br />The only thing I would like to ask is that Criterion or somebody would put this legendary film on a decent edition, because this is not a regular classic movie (for that matter, any Howard Hawks film), this is something deserving a second dvd with bonus footage and interviews and booklet and what have you...<br /><br />RIO BRAVO, by Howard Hawks. N&uacute;mero Uno, baby.
B000F48CD8|3.0|Intially, I was on the fence.  I was never much for Mr. Benson, but I've been a huge White Stripes fan for years.  The thought of Jack White with a full band excited me and scared me at the same time. <br /> <br />The result is mixed.  Upon my first listen, I wasn't sure what to make of the album when it ended.  Today, I also am unsure of what to make of it.  It seems inconsistent, but never bad.  There are some true standouts (Steady, Hands, Store-Bought Bones) but there's a lot I wouldn't think much of by comparison. <br /> <br />Still, it's a solid release.  Definitely not the worst album of 2006
B0002O39A2|5.0|The above reviewers do a great job with the factual information on this disc. I'll just say that if you have any or all of the Steve Hillage solo works or Gong albums with him on guitar, then proceed on to this treasure.  If you don't and have an interest in prog, this album will launch your journey into a discovery of the best Hendrix disciple on the planet.
6304698690|4.0|I agree with the other reviewer. It is sad that anyone would even in the slightest consider a brief view of a little girls chest/nipple to be \\"nudity\\". In case no one knows the chest of little girls and boys and exactly the same. if it was a 10 year old boys nipple it probably wouldn't even be mentioned. I think it's time to dispel these sick, silly ideas.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I tried to approach this movie with an open mind, which was difficult since I've loved the book and the BBC Firth/Ehle version for years.  I found the new movie enjoyable with some things being better than the BBC version.   <br /> <br />Kiera Knightley and Judi Dench's performances are outstanding.  Almost all of the acting was very good.  My problems were with how characters were changed and thus I didn't like their portrayal.  Elizabeth's father as portrayed by Donald Sutherland was much more sentimental and lacked the appropriate humor.  Both the Darcy and Wickham characters are barely known and thus essential aspects of the story can barely be comprehended.   <br /> <br />If you're familiar with the BBC version, the lines Darcy says to Elizabeth in the Knightley version are appallingly laughable.  They make Darcy out to be an idiotic geek rather than an intelligent yet shy man.  When it comes right down to it, the only way I can watch the Knightley version is if I skip any scenes with Darcy in them.  His lines are awful, the actor plays him like a sick lost puppy.  Ok my prejudice towards the BBC version is now coming out.  Colin Firth plays a far more believable Darcy, with dialogue fitting of the character. <br /> <br />So I'd only recommend if you a)skip scenes with Darcy or b)have never read the book or seen the BBC version
B000G759LW|5.0|I'm black and most of the black people I had listen to this hated on her. They can listen to Mariah who's voice is fading out. Christina is one of the best singers out. She has her own style. Like I said before I don't care what race you are as long as you can sing soul I will listen to it. Each track is good really that's why I won't rate it.

B00005JNS0|5.0|In Pixar's CARS, directed by TOY STORY director John Lasseter, the world is populated entirely by - you guessed it - cars.  So it's only natural that the biggest event in the entire car world is the Piston Cup, the world's most popular race (inspired by the ever-popular NASCAR racing).  This year, the public's rooting for Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), an immensely-talented albeit egotistic rookie.  While traveling to California to prepare for the Piston Cup, Lightning's driver, Mack (John Ratzenberger), dozes off and sends Lightning off into the middle of nowhere.  The middle of nowhere happens to be the small town of Radiator Springs, or - as Lightning described it - \\"hillbilly hell\\".  Though at first Lightning wants nothing more than to escape from Radiator Springs and win the Piston Cup, he gradually becomes more and more attached to the town and its citizens, eventually realizing that friends and family mean more than fame. <br /> <br />Pixar makes family movies better than anyone.  Adults find their films just as entertaining as do children.  CARS is no exception, though it lacks the power of many of Pixar's previous creations, such as TOY STORY or FINDING NEMO.  Also, it is becoming more and more clear that Pixar's films seem to revolve around the same sort of formula.  Eventually, I believe that this will begin to bother some adults, but the children will go on loving these films, and that's what the films are here for in the first place. <br /> <br />The cast for CARS is even more impressive than that of previous Pixar films.  The cast includes, along with Owen Wilson, Paul Newman, Bonnie Hunt, Larry the Cable Guy, Cheech Marin, Tony Shalhoub, George Carlin, NASCAR racers Richard Petty and Dale Earnhardt Jr., FINDING NEMO/A BUG'S LIFE director Andrew Stanton, Jay Leno, and Michael Keaton.  That is quite the cast.  It also features music by Randy Newman and some fantastic animation. <br /> <br />Despite all that it has going for it, CARS was considered a flop at the box office, primarily when compared to Pixar's previous masterpieces.  I believe that this is due in part to the advertising, which I thought made the film look like many of the other stupid CGI family film imitations in theaters recently.  All I can say is disregard the advertising and see the film for yourself.  It's another delightful family film from Pixar.  Your kids'll love it, and you'll love it too.  What more could you ask for?
B000F48CD8|5.0|This cd is absolutely amazing!  I heard \\"Steady As She Goes\\" on the radio and had to hear the rest of it.  It doesn't happen very often that you buy a new cd and end up liking EVERY song on it! \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" reminds me of Led Zeppelin.  The other songs remind me of a combination of The Who, Ted Nugent and maybe the Beatles.  Jack White and the rest of the band certainly have some major talent!  I also liked it because it seems like they were having fun and really enjoyed making this cd.
B000G759LW|5.0|I love Christina she has a great voice and I loved her Stripped Album and almost burn it down because I played so much. After that cd I said that it was going to be hard to top that album, well she made another awesome album. She use her influences from the past and adding her knowledge from the music today. She's not trying to be those great soul singers like Etta James, she's been herself. Stripped was a CD reflecting her dark side and Back To Basics reflects another side of her, happy and playfull. Awesome and Great.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|I was disappointed by the ending. It seemed quite hastily concluded. I wanted more details on her recovery process--how she was able to save herself. That would definitely help readers who have been through similar experiences.
B000G759LW|5.0|\\"It is now time for the one and only....There will never be another....Christina Aguilera\\" - Back to Basics (Intro)    Who knew Christina was capable of actually topping 'Stripped', her audacious sophomore album from 2002, or even capable of making an album of this magnitude. Nobody questioned Christina's talents as a vocalist, but was she up to to the challenge of making this album? I've only listened through it once, but I can already tell this is going into my 'classic album' file.    If 'Stripped' was her dirrty, angst album, this one is pure joy and class and she pulls it all off with vigor. As you might have heard, this is Christina's foray into old blues/jazz/hiphop/20s/30s/40s sounds she's been so influenced by. This album is more of an homage to those who inspired her and those with keen musical ears will be able to pick out those samples that she and super producers DJ Premier and Linda Perry (among others) have thoughtfully put together in stunning and creative ways. Songs like the fast paced catchy first single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\", the touching mid-tempo ballad \\"Understand\\", the ultra sassy \\"Slow Down Baby\\", and the explosive soul rhythms of \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" blends perfectly the elements of old soul/r&b with modern day sounds. Other songs bring back to mind old hip/hop vibes of the late 80s and 90s. The bump and grind of \\"Back in the Day\\" gives praise and tribute to early artists who paved the way for her. The chorus to this song is one of the catchiest I've ever heard. There's a chill energy on the track \\"Thank You\\", a thoughtful exchange of thank yous between Christina and her fans with clips lifted from actual fan voicemail. \\"On Our Way\\" and \\"Without You\\" finds Christina using her voice in her upper register is some beautiful ways especially in that of the latter. And a haunting piano loops in the background of the endearing \\"Oh Mother\\" that gives appreciation to her mother for getting her out of a domestic violence situation when she was younger. Overall, Disc 1 is a solid album even if it was released by itself. However, it's not like Christina to completely stop there. If you're looking for something more adventurous, check out Disc 2.    If you want to go further back into time, venture into her second disc and there you'll find those sounds that hearken back the sounds of the 20s, 30s, and 40s. The insanely infectious \\"Candyman\\" is an ode to the Andrew Sister's \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" only with much more tongue and cheek sexuality in the lyrics and music. \\"I Got Trouble\\" sounds the most authentic to the era and sounds like it's coming straight out of an old, ratty radio in a dingy, dark bar. The torchy, burlesque stylings of \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" will send you off in hot sweats while the hush stunner \\"Save Me From Myself\\" leads us into a very intimate conversation with her as she sweetly explains to us how her husband has changed her life. No reverbs, no nothing. Just Christina's voice at her most vulnerable. This is a vocal performance like you've never heard from her. Treading back to Disc 1, even the track \\"Still Dirrty\\" has a 1920s flapper-esque sensibility with it's repeating triple horn blast. \\"Mercy On Me\\" is a vocal tour de force with Christina infused with deep down blues giving a heart wrenching confession to God for committing a wrongful sin towards a lover. This is probably my favorite song out of the two disc set. Her vocals on this song is a feast to the ears. The rock ballad \\"Hurt\\" sends an emotional chill up the spine as she pleas for forgiveness from a lost loved one. And as if the second disc wasn't off the wall enough, Christina sends us to the circus with \\"Enter the Circus/Welcome\\" acting as a combo. \\"Enter the Circus\\" feels like something lifted straight out of a Tim Burton movie with what seems to be Linda Perry playing the MC for the opening act of a circus. It's somewhat creepy, but it's a very effective intro and it leads straight into \\"Welcome\\". This is an amazing (albeit short) little song giving us a satirical view of the music business. She sings over a cavalcade of beautiful strings and the combo sounds epic in scope. I just wished it was a little longer. Christina ends the set with \\"The Right Man\\" written in response to the emotion she felt when she realized she had no father to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. A very emotional, almost classical song with dramatic strings. This ends with a very touching line and optimistic view to her future.    There are no fillers on this album (save for FUSS, but it's actually an interlude). The two discs could've been meshed into one, but her decision to divide it into two sets was more a creative reason - to separate the two completely different sounds. This album has something for everyone.    Standout Tracks :    Makes Me Wanna Pray  Back in the Day  Ain't No Other Man  Understand  Slow Down Baby  Without You  Welcome  Candyman  Nasty Naughty Boy  Hurt  Mercy On Me  Save Me From Myself    There you have it. It's quite possibly the best album to come out in 2006. This will surely be a major contender in the upcoming Grammy season. If you have any reservations on whether you should go out and buy this album, don't hesitate - BUY IT! You can't go wrong when the music is this good.
B000002C25|4.0|In so many ways, this is the album that Oasis were destined to make.  They had been a cocky, over-the-top, excessive group before, but on \\"Be Here Now\\" they really cranked up the noise and bravado.  Just look at the length of the songs.  \\"My Big Mouth\\" (my personal favorite track) seems like a simple ditty compared to the colossal songs that make up the remainder of the album.  \\"All Around the World\\" clocks in at a modest 9 minutes, and then reprises at the end of the disc.  \\"D'ya Know What I Mean\\" begins the album with a bombastic roar that never really relents.  Yet, this is exactly the road that Oasis was headed in from the very beginning.  They were always about being the biggest, about being the best to the point of excess.  This album is the culmination of the lifestyle they had been enjoying up til '97.  That's exactly what makes this album so great.  It's carefree yet bombastic.  It's fun but overwhelming.  It's both frustrating and engaging.  There is no other Oasis album like it, for better or for worse.  All of the criticisms mean nothing when you hear a song as wonderful as \\"Stand By Me\\" or \\"Magic Pie.\\"  Oasis were nothing if not entertaining (something that can't be said of their most recent efforts).  \\"Be Here Now\\" is both a celebration of and a funeral for Britpop.  Give it another chance.  I'm sure you'll like it.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|I love Rihanna. She's fine and talented---TO A LIMIT! Some of her songs I find good but one track I hate in particular is Unfaithful!Lord, does she sound TERRIBLE!Like I said some of her songs I love except for Unfaithful and A Million Miles Away (because-to me-it sounds as if she's trying a bit too hard).Nonetheless it's a good album and she does better than her debut album Music of the Sun. My only suggestion to Rihana is: STOP TRYING TO SING SO HARD!
B000HCO83Q|5.0|I have been a major fan of the X-men for a long time. I enjoyed the  first two films (especially the second) but this one really stood out to me. I do agree with the others who reviewed it and said that they where unhappy that in the Last Stand several main characters die. But it is because of that I like it so much. I was shocked just as everyone was when Cyclops and Proffessor X died. But I had to give an appluase to the Director for taking such a huge risk (especially when there are so many Cyclops fans). I think it brings more emotion and life to the film, due to the fact that these main characters die. I also found the action to be superb, I liked how all the mutants showed off there powers this time around. And I love that in this film it was centered around The Dark Phoenix. I do however agree that her story was very diffrent in the comics and that this film version depicted her very diffrently. But overall I thought that the Dark Phoenix ways played very well and that her scenes whe prehapes the most intense in the film. In conclusion X-men: The Last Stand is a powerful, emotional, and capitivating film that you will entertian you to the very end. PS. whatch after the criedits for the final scene, its a shocker.
1401302378|3.0|There are some interesting ideas in the book, but a lot of repretition.  Could be condensed down a great deal.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|\\"Brokeback Mountain\\" is a beautiful, faithful, and moving film-adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story. The film conveys intact and true the overall mood and emotionally terse feeling of Proulx's literary work, even though not every scene nor all of the dialogue from the short story has been translated into the film verbatim (although a great majority of the dialogue and description has). This is understandable given the different natures of the two media. Inner psychological reflections and some physical descriptions in the written word can be difficult to portray on film cinematographically in photorealism, or may have been considered too graphic for such an artistic movie. If nothing else, this film is very tastefully done. To fully appreciate the film, one may wish to read and compare the short story, and view it at least two or three times to catch all of the subtleties, beginning from the very first scene. <br /> <br />As one viewer's impressions, given that director Ang Lee is Chinese (Taiwan), he imbues throughout the entire film an \\"Asian\\" or \\"Chinese\\" aesthetic. For instance, there seems to be a particular framing of the landscape like in classical Chinese paintings, or incorporation of parallel and so-called \\"bookending\\" scenes, like Chinese rhyming couplets. As another \\"Asian\\" trait, may be a reticence to address controversial or sensitive matters too directly; hence, repression and the use of cultural allusions, subtle, nuanced facial and physical expressions or vocal inflections to convey unsaid or unsay-able thoughts or emotions. Even though unsaid or said indirectly, an observant viewer will understand completely the emotions and feelings that are being communicated. <br /> <br />Often times when Jack and Ennis are together, every view of the moon is of a full moon, which not only signifies passage of time - usually only one full moon per month - but also in Chinese culture has connotations of wholeness and completeness. Thus, Jack and Ennis symbolically are two halves of a whole - yin and yang. The black and white hats, may actually reflect the yin and yang natures of Jack and Ennis, respectively. One can say that Jack is predominately \\"psychologically feminine,\\" while Ennis is \\"psychologically masculine\\". <br /> <br />Yin and yang are descriptions of complementary opposites rather than absolutes. Most forces in nature can be broken down into their respective yin and yang states, and the two are usually in movement rather than held in absolute stasis. As in the traditional, circular yin-yang symbol, part of yin is also in yang, and part of yang is in yin, which is symbolized as a dot of each one in the other respectively. The dots in each serves as a reminder that there are always traces of one in the other. For example, there is always light within the dark (e.g., the stars at night); these qualities are never completely one or the other. Also, the dots serve as a reminder that absolute extreme on one part transforms instantly into the opposite, or that the labels yin and yang are conditioned by an observer's point of view. For example, the hardest stone can be easiest to break. This can show that absolute discrimination between the two is artificial.
B00019GG1M|4.0|Who would have expected a little band coming out of Little Rock, Arkansas to become such a mainstream success? Whether you know them from their Linkin Park-ish first hit \\"Bring Me To Life\\" or their mellow-dramatic crossover with \\"My Immortal,\\" it's safe to say that Evanescence are one of the most recognizable and most overplayed band in recent memory. I'll be the first to admit that this album really doesn't sound as fresh now as it did in 2003, thanks in part to an open door where swarms of female fronted rock bands have emerged. Regardless, it's still a solid album worth revisiting from time to time (hence the re-review).<br /><br />With their major label debut, co-founders Amy Lee and Ben Moody managed to etch out a sound all their own, fused with plenty of pop hooks and dramatic themes. A catchy hard-rock act with a more than capable female handling the vocals is kind of a hard thing to ignore. Opening with the dark, heavy and simple \\"Going Under,\\" the soundscape is set for the rest of the album, as Lee fights with the band to be heard. If hard-rock ain't your thing, then songs like \\"My Immortal\\" and \\"Hello\\" beautifully show Amy's capabilities and range. \\"Everybody's Fool,\\" the lesser-hit of the album, has always been a standout in my mind, as it is an excellent assault on teen-pop and shallow self-image, presented by the likes of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera. However, songs like \\"Haunted,\\" \\"Tourniquet\\" and \\"Imaginary\\" are so over the top and dramatic that it gets a bit cheesy. And need I mention that I really could go the rest of my life without hearing \\"Bring Me To Life\\" ever again?<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Fallen\\" was very overexposed and overplayed in it's time. In my opinion, it never earned the credibility that the strong musicianship and songwriting truly earned it. It's an excellent album for any fan of music. It appeals to both the rock crowd and the pop crowd without losing any authenticity along the way. It should be interesting to see how the band fares with their upcoming new album, without the influence of guitarist Ben Moody (who has been replaced by Terry Balsamo, formerly of Cold). Regardless, \\"Fallen\\" definitely stands strong on it's own.how the band fares with their upcoming new album, without the influence of guitarist Ben Moody (who has been replaced by Terry Balsamo, formerly of Cold).

B000CNDIZE|4.0|In a world of hit songs and singles, this album is a delectable, soothing mix of songs that you can play from start to finish - no skipping.  Sia's tone is extremely unique and beautiful - it's slightly nasal, but extremely powerful and her ability to slide from note to note is remniscent of the skatting ability of Fitzgerald - though Sia takes a much slower approach. \\"breathe me\\" is ethereal and absolutely breath-taking - one of those times when the single actually is the best track on the album.  \\"Don't bring me Down\\" and \\"Sunday\\" are great tracks as well.  The only let down of this album is the lack of variance in tempos - it's a little slow at times, but other than that it's a great CD and I'm proud to have it on my wall.  If you fancy Sia and other female singer/song writers, try \\"Siren Songs\\" by Gretchen Lieberum -  an irresistably sultry, sexy female subpop/jazz vocalist whose latest album features innovative musical and lyrical ideas.
0380789019|5.0|I found this book accidently and did not expect to like it.  I loved it and want more, more, more.  Neil Gaiman's mind scares me a little but the creativity and feeling that the characters in this world generate are wonderful and so much like the \\"real\\" world only under eschewed circumstances to say the least.  I loved all of the characters.  The nasties found in this book were so unbelievably nasty and the good folks were good even if in a somewhat flawed way as most of us are. <br /> <br />I have just read the above and it makes no sense to me at all.  However, those who have read this book will understand. <br /> <br />Well worth the $ and the time.  Best and most unusual book I have read in a very long time.

B000G759LW|4.0|Save for the spectacular 'I got Trouble' in which Christina channels Bessie Smith, this album is not dressed much in 20'-40's musical arrangements...However, this is one fantastic album overall and a major accomplishment for Ms. Aguilera coming from the land of over-produced, teeny-boppers...But we all knew she could sing and if any one was going to make it out alive, it was going to be her.  <br />Back to Basics has a few duds in my personal opinion, but out of 22 songs, said 'duds' are very few and far between.  <br />I especially like 'Save Me From Myself' as it is a welcomed departure from Christina's big showy vocals and she delivers with such restraint and control to this acoustic masterpiece, that I can only hope she goes in that direction for her next project; that or the direction in which 'Mercy on Me'  points towards... Imagine Christina putting out an album like Betty lavette's latest blues/rock masterpiece! <br />Anyhow, if you love her or you don't, she can sing and she desrves credit for living it up - her way and on her terms. <br />Congrats!
B000002GBB|5.0|This has to be one of Styx's best pieces of music. It's up there with THE GRAND ILLUSION and PARADISE THEATRE. This is one of the few albums out there that you can put in your cd player and not skip a single song. Every song on here is a piece of greatness. Done by the best band of all time. Styx is a great band and they're even better live. I honestly feel though that they have lost a bit since Dennis DeYoung left but I do believe that Lawrence Gowan does a spectacular job. They still are a great band.    Here Is My Review:    1. Great White Hope (35/10) A Spectacular Hard Rocker written and sung by JY the guitar and drum work are excellent on this piece. Keep an ear on John Panozzo and his drums because he shines on this album.    2. I'm Okay (40/10) A great song by Dennis. The Organ Solo on this song is spectacular. Guitar Work and solo is very good. Dennis' vocals are great and so are John's drums.    3. Sing For The Day (30/10) A soft song to Tommy's daughter. The keyboards are very well done onthis song. The keyboard solo is good. It's a very nice upbeat song.    4. The Message (15/10) Intro to Lords Of The Ring. Proof that Dennis could've been a great techno performer too.    5. Lords Of The Ring (25/10) Written by Dennis sung by JY good theatric kinda song. John's drums are excellent on this song and the guitar work by both JY and Tommy are great.    6. Blue Collar Man (100/10) Written and sung by Tommy Every instrument in this song just shines. Dennis keyboards are fantastic. Chuck supplies a really good bassline. JY's rhythym guitar/solos are fantastic. The guitar solo and singing by Tommy is just plain inspiring. My favorite song of all-time.    7. Queen Of Spades (50/10) Written and sung by Dennis he really shows off his pipes on this one. Some great guitar and drum work too.    8. Renegade (60/10) Written and sung by Tommy the guitar solo is the best I have ever heard. The drums are good and the keyboard parts add a nice touch.    9. Pieces Of Eight (10/10) Written and sung by Dennis. A great song with a message. The piano solo is very nice.    10. Aku-Aku (10/10) A nice soft instrumental to finsh off the album.    Well there you have it buy this album it really is very good. I highly suggest it to anyone whether you're a staring out Styx fan or you've been one for a while this is a great album to start, continue, or even end your collection with.
B000002KAT|2.0|I've listened to this CD at least 10 times, and it really is like looking at a Andy Warhol or even Picasso painting and 'just not getting it'.  I bought the disk thinking it must be the ultimate Van Morrison (#19 on Rolling Stone Magazine's Best Albums list), but it is so rough and dated that you would really need to look beyond the recording to appreciate the art.  I have read that Morrison didn't even know the backing musicians, and that there was very little, in any, interaction prior to recording.  I find 'Moondance' and 'His Band and Street Choir' much more enjoyable from Van's early 70's work.  His strongest release is the live album from 1974, 'It's Too Late To Stop Now'.  Interesting, in that concert he only had one song from Astral Weeks...which was a vastly superior version of Cypress Avenue.    Hard-core Van Morrison fans should own Astral Weeks, but IMHO it really is a rather unexceptional period piece, and not a 'timeless classic\\".    For later period Van Morrison, I would recommend Hymns to the Silence, Down the Road, or Live at the Grand Old Opera House Belfast.
B000ASATZ8|4.0|Before I rate the box set and the four movies I would like to give you a brief history of my life with these films. When I was really young I use to always ask my dad to rent Tremors and we would all set and whatch it. But when I got a bit older and I could understand things better I became afraid and was scared of Grabiods coming up from underneath are house and eating me. Anyways after about two years I got the guts to whatch Tremors 2: After shocks. And Afterwards I was agian afraid of Grabiods and now Shriekers attacking me. Finally after about ten years of not watching them, me and my buddy Travis got to talking about Tremors and he asked me what Grabiods where. So I dicided to draw him pictures of them and after a few days I ended up creating a Tremors comic. So after becoming so involved with Tremors again I decided to watch the first film again. And after it ended, I bought it off Amazon and a week later I bought the third movie and then another week after that I bought the second. I had literly gone a 180 from fearing Tremors so long ago to become a huge fan. And when the fourth finally came out I had my family, my friend Travis and his brother hooked. Now after being a huge fan and watching the four films over and over I can finally rate them. The original Tremors is by far the best; with it's all star cast and great story line. The second best would have to be Tremors 4: The Legend Begins because it stays more true to the first and it shows how it all began. Tremors 2: After shocks would be third best since it stared Earl and Gummer and Tremors 3: Back to Prefection would have to be the worst since it's story is weak, its short and it takes the evolution thing a bit far. Overall this is a great pack of all four Tremors movies and if I hadn't boughten all of them aready I would buy this Attack Pack. Ps. Tremors 5 script has been finished and if Tremors 4 sales enough they will make a fifth. And one more thing it would be awsome if Universal would release Tremors: The Series on DVD.
B00005JP7Y|4.0|I took my 8yr old son and 14 yr old nephew to see this last night. It was mostly for them but I was unexpected surprised that I enjoyed it so much myself. Film delivered the subtle messages about \\"crime does not pay\\", \\"never give up and aspire to better with your life\\", \\"follow your parent's rules\\", \\"give everyone a fair chance\\", and more. Oh, did I mention that I REALLY enjoyed the dancing? I liked the way that you saw parts of the Main Dance Routine and felt you were being given a performance when the actual Main Dance Routine was done in its entirety at the end. My little men were up an dancing in the show when the credits were rolling. I really enjoyed this movie. I must also admit that CHANNING TATUM is a handsome youngman.
B000002KAT|5.0|This isn't the CD I'd take to a desert island with me...this is the one I want to either be buried with or go to the Arterlife with. A work of true genius unlike any in the annals of pop music and as thoroughly original as, yes, Sgt. Pepper, this album is THAT good. There was never any music like this before Astral Weeks and there hasn't been anything like it since.  Everything about it is perfect, everything about it is unique.  Even Van the Man never came close to repeating this...it's as if the angels granted him this one moment of the sublime.  Though there are songs on St Dominick's Preview that come close. But enough!  Words do not suffice.  Astral Weeks speaks, groans, purrs, bellows, growls and soars for itself.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|Oddly, a compilation by Talking Heads should come out uneven and disjointed, but this collection is marvelously done.  The songs meld well together and provide a sampler that wouldn't prevent anyone from buying their excellent original albums.  ('Talking Heads '77,' 'Remain in Light,' and 'Speaking in Tongues' are their crowning achievements artistically, but 'Fear of Music,' 'More Songs About Buildings and Food,' and 'True Stories' demonstrate that they had a great repertoire.   (Unlike, 'Sand in the Vaseline,' which is also excellent, but perhaps takes too many gems and doesn't align them as well.)      For the uninitiated, Talking Heads is one of the freshest and engaging progressive bands from the seventies and eighties.  \\"Psycho Killer,\\" \\"Once in a Lifetime,\\" \\"Burning Down the House,\\" and \\"Wild, Wild Life\\" all capture the inspired lunacy that dares to match the insanity of ordinary life.  All of their albums are well represented.  \\"Life During Wartime\\" represents them at their progressive best, but \\"And She Was\\" showcases their ethereal best.      In sum, 'Best of Talking Heads' provides a great mix and a thoughtful sampler without spoiling all of the fun.
B000A6T262|3.0|If you are, or ever were, a Star Trek fan, then you must of course own every one of the movies. It's much the same as the obligation to own all of the Star Wars movies even though you believe that the second trilogy is trash compared to the first trilogy. Does this special 10-box set add anything? No, but if you, for some odd reason, don't already have them all (or most of them) then this is an amazing deal. However, I wouldn't get too attached to the box as there are talks of yet ANOTHER Star Trek movie in the works. If someone knows where it is possible to purchase JUST the box, so all of the films can be contained without having to repurchase every movie again, the information would be welcome.
B00005JKJA|5.0|`Mulholland Drive' is as intoxicating as it is confusing, but it's not impossible to understand as so many have already pointed out and explained in great detail.  I just got finished watching this film for the first time and I must say that it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, yet I'm really not sure what I wanted to see.  I had no knowledge of this film's plot, I just had heard so much about it, rave reviews mostly for Naomi's brilliant performance, so I had to watch it for myself. <br /> <br />I do want to mention first and formost that all the praise Naomi has recieved for this film is just and she was wrongfully denied the Oscar nomination...when she should not only have been nominated but WON... <br /> <br />Now... <br /> <br />The opening sequence gives us a car crash that ends up bringing two very different women together.  Rita (Laura Elena Harring), the sole survivor of the crash, is suffering from amnesia and ends up stumbling into an apartment belonging to Ruth Elms.  Ruth is away starring in a film and has lent her apartment to her niece Betty (Naomi Watts) who stumbles on Rita when arriving at her new home.  The two bond shortly thereafter and Betty decides to try and help Rita regain her memory. <br /> <br />In the meantime Betty is pursuing her acting career, auditioning for part after part, one of them being a film being helmed by director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux).  Adam's life has been falling apart piece by piece, starting with his film being taken out of control, the lead actress forced upon him, his wife is found cheating on him with the pool man, his bank accounts are zeroed out and there are threats made on his life. <br /> <br />This all adds up in the end... <br /> <br />The only name's that Rita can remember are `Diane' and `Mulholland Drive', the latter being the place of her accident, and the former being the name of someone she knew, someone who may know her and so Rita and Betty venture to find this woman to get some answers.  What they find is not what you, I or even they expected.   <br /> <br />The first two hours of this film are summed up in a sequence taken place at Club Silencio.  Here we are told that everything is prerecorded, everything is phony, fake, and it may not click right then, but soon you will understand what they're getting at, and when the identity of Diane is revealed within the last half hour of the film everything will make perfect sense.  What makes `Mulholland Drive' so extraordinary is that is challenges the viewer to forget what they think they know and just let it all sink in.  If you watch this film trying to put the pieces together, trying to understand the plot twist then you'll miss the whole point.  Just watch it and be patient and as the credits role you'll get it...I promise.
B00009RDGA|5.0|\\"Paper Moon\\" hits a homerun in all respects.  Superb direction by Peter Bogdanovich, an excellent Oscar nominated script by Alvin Sargent, great depression era atmosphere distinguished by the production design by Bogdanovich's then wife Polly Platt and an impeccable song score.  It's the performances by the cast that is the film's greatest attribute.  I don't dispute Tatum O'Neal winning the Oscar for her work here.  What I do disagree with is why she won in a supporting role and not in the lead actress category(Glenda Jackson won for \\"A Touch of Class\\".  Puh-leeze!).  Tatum at the tender age of nine shows a maturity and guile well beyond her years.  Ryan O'Neal contributes probably his best performance ever.  I think the combination of working with Bogdanovich and opposite his daughter ignited a spark in him.  The comic scenes where he and Tatum go toe-to-toe are classic.  Ryan's slow burns in this film are the stuff of legend.  The supporting cast which includes the Oscar nominated Madeline Kahn as a dancehall girl and John Hillerman as a bootlegger and his sadistic sheriff brother are also outstanding.
B00006LI4S|5.0|Only thing negative was the two people \\"reading\\" parts of the song.  Let's get real, half of the world could repeat the lines by heart.  The fact that they needed a cheat sheet for the lines and there lack of timing during the reading were disapointing. (Next time call me I will do a much better job) <br />Thanks to Dave for the music!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|For those who appreciate the modern, \\"mature\\" Pink Floyd, Pulse is a masterpiece. For classic Pink Floyd fans, Pulse is very good. Disc one is a thoughtfully-produced set, opening with \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" followed by an early Syd Barrett track. A solid hour of music. The rendition of Dark Side of the Moon on disc two is nearly identical to the original (although that isn't necessarily important), although it has that vibrant, live energy that David Gilmour seems to command. Finally, the encore featuring \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\" fantastic. Roger Waters fans will be thoroughly satisfied despite his absence; there's something in it for every Pink Floyd fan and is a must-listen
B0009HLDFU|4.0|It's been over a decade since former Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl's Foo Fighters made their impact upon the music scene, and thankfully he and the rest of the crew are not showing their age with this double disc set.  \\"In Your Honor\\" covers both ends of the spectrum; the first disc featuring edgier, hook laden riffs, and the second disc focusing more on a softer, melodic tone.  In any case, \\"In Your Honor\\" succeeds where most double albums fail, by never too wrapped up in itself.  The title track, \\"The Best of You\\", \\"D.O.A.\\", \\"The Deepest Blues are Black\\", and \\"Over and Out\\" are all great tracks which showcase that Grohl's songwriting skills have not degenerated over time, even though the album loses speed during the last half of the second disc.  Despite that however, \\"In Your Honor\\" is better than I ever expected, and while it's no \\"Colour and the Shape\\", what is?
B00003CXA6|5.0|This 1993 movie, based on Michael Shaara's book The Killer Angels, is over four hours long, but it uses that time well to document this critical Civil War battle.  I used the word `document' on purpose because this movie is accurate to the point of being a documentary.  It was even filmed at the Gettysburg National Military Park.  When you see the fight for Little Round Top or Pickett's Charge, or another fight, you are seeing the events much as they happened where they happened.<br /><br />Thousands of civil war re-enactors play the everyday soldiers you see in the background and in the grand charges of this battle.  These amateur enthusiasts put their heart into this movie and it shows.<br /><br />As a high school history teacher, I was timing certain parts of the movie to show in class.

B0000024W3|4.0|There are certain Dylan albums that hit me like a ton of bricks,  Blonde on Blonde, John Wesley Harding, just to name a few; but this  isn't one of them.  And what's so wrong with that? <br /> <br />It seems that everyone looks to Dylan as a \\"Master craftsman\\" who creates seminal objects in American culture.  Each one moving us to the edge of sanity and bringing us back.  We're supposed to be trasnformed and left in a puddle of tears by Dylan.  But is that was a great work of art has to be?   Do we really have to dominated by our heros? <br /> <br />Self Portrait may be a big screw you to his fans.  It may be a restless icon trying to break loose.  Or it may be exactly what it sounds like: and apathetic tired babbler making an album just for the sake of it.  It seems to me that Dylan is just doing music for lazy goofs.  No pretention, no lofty philosophy or artistry, just for goofs.  And that is in a way, more exciting that a seminal piece of american culture.  It's far more organic at least. <br /> <br />In some of the original songs that you could call more \\"poppy\\" it seems like he's crapping it out just to show he can.  The fact that there is so much material on the album proves it.  He didn't put much effort into each track, seperately they're nothing, but together it's something. <br /> <br />I think that if we only love dylan for as maker of masterpieces we are clipping his wings.  If we only define art as well crafted beauty we are being very narrow minded.  We should look at this album as just an hour and a half of fun, lazy, pseudo mindless fun.  It's Dylan just for goofs.

0061020710|5.0|This is a great book that pokes fun at many modern-day topics.  Even though this book was published before I was born, I still found that it related to our modern society.  The constant wit and humor won't have you rolling on the floor laughing hysterically, but you will be reading this book with a smile on your face and a rather loud chuckle now and then.
0316172324|5.0|I enjoyed Blink much more than \\"The Tipping Point.\\" In \\"TP\\" Gladwell seems to belabor his points with elongated stories and repetitive emphasis. In \\"Blink\\" he left me wanting more. Fascinating stuff, and even a glimpse of how thin slicing can work in a million different situations puts you on the lookout throughout your daily life.<br /><br />It also restores your belief in the value of you own hunches, intuition and feelings.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|I love this prequel and its better than its counterpart unofficial sequel Zombie 2!!! <br /> <br />The legendary Zombie Master George Romero has created a most intensely shocking motion-picture of all time, Dawn of the Dead. And special guest starring Tom Savini the gang leader with his gang of bikers. <br /> <br />I give this 5/5. <br /> <br />But, to all those people love to bash this film and us lovers of this film, we don't want and don't need to hear your nagging on us loving this film and calling us narrow-minded, I think you guys are the ones who are narrow-minded, posting all these things to bash us are simply downright: childish, insane and narrow-minded. Looks like the harsh words you all had made on this film and on us fans probably has backfired on yourselves. So quit your childishness and peace out.
0143034901|5.0|You know how some books are so wonderful that after finishing the last page, you can't read anything else for quite a while, because it seems that nothing else could be quite this good?<br /><br />Well, \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" is one of those books. Admittedly, it was slightly slow going at first, before I started liking it, a lot. But it was the last third - poignant, beautful, and haunting - that made me fall in love with the book.<br /><br />Many reviews have compared it to various other literary works, rightly enough. But I'd add that it reminded me a whole lot of a movie by Spanish director Pedro Almodovar - bizarre and colorful, filled with quirky characters, at times outrageously crude, but also touched with sudden, breathtaking moments of beauty.<br /><br />And, as noted above, the final moments of \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" just wrapped around my heart and still won't let go, even months later.<br /><br />Can you tell that I really recommend it? :)
B000002BBY|5.0|okay, seriously, what can I say about this disc that hasn't already been said?  Best of the 90s?  Maybe.  One of the best?  Definately.  It's just one of those albums jam packed with tight rock that anybody who is into anything but disney music needs to have in their collection.  If Definately Maybe was about the dream of becomming a \\"rockNroll star,\\" this album is the sequal where the dream comes true      Songs:  1. Hello- nothing has said \\"hello\\" better than this song  2. Roll With It-exactly.  just listen to it.  This one really has a magic to it.  3. Wonderwall-sure it's cliche, and it's been remade more times than I'd like to admit.  Not even their best song.  Yet, this is one of my favorite rock anthems.  4.Don't look back in anger-Alway been a favorite Oasis song.  Nod to \\"Let It Be.\\" (but NOT a ripoff)  5. Hey Now-don't you dare turn the cd off  6.Okay, MAYBE could have lived without the swamp song clip  7.Some Might Say-that this is a great song and a great cd!  8. Cast No Shadow-Deep, philosphical, accoustic, love this song  9.She's Electric-Catchiest one of the cd, this makes me grin  10.Title Track-This has the same rock magic that is contained in \\"Roll W/ It.\\" Words can't describe.  11. See #6  12.Champagne Supernova-basically what we're saying here is, \\"f*** off, I'm gonna be famous, try and stop me!\\"    Stop reading reviews.  Stop listening to those who say they are Beatles ripoffs and or those who make fun of how much the gallaghers hate each other.  Just buy it, or else evil pterridacyles will hijack your pt cruiser, and God won't love you anymore.
0140441166|5.0|\\"..engrossing...\\"<br /><br />\\"...keeps the suspense mounting and the pages turning..\\"<br /><br />\\"...delicious witty and gossipy...\\"<br /><br />Alas - any of these blurbs still would sell this novel short, for it has all the virtues of your garden variety bestseller du jour - gripping plot, memorable characters, unconventional ending - and far more.<br /><br />Simply put, Les Liaisons Dangereuses raised the bar of the epistolary novel so high it no longer exists. The subtitle, \\"Letters gathered in a Society\\" indicates a collection of the correspondence has been arranged by a \\"fictional\\" editor. The distinctive styles and view presented in each letter creates a polyphonic effect, where the reader is always better informed about the relevant situation than the authors of the letters themselves. The authors are not merely reporting events, they write in order to present themselves the way they intend to appear to their correspondents.<br /><br />The nature of the composition of the novel has disposed of the \\"normative position\\" of the author, Choderlos de Laclos and preempted the moral imperative. The absence of a narrator or an authoritative narrative voice makes it impossible to locate the intentions of the author. As a result, moral ambiguity is the book's greatest charm. Its depiction of the base motives of the aristocracy was shocking, controversial and scandalous, for its authenticity in certain spots implied it was a roman a clef. The first edition sold out within days, nonetheless.<br /><br />The Marquise de Merteil and Vicomte de Valmont are two letter writers who shrewdly and ruthlessly play a game where seduction is the name; psychological methods, the rules; erotic pleasure, the prize. They are the dangerous liaisons of the painfully naïve young girl, Cecile Volanges. She and the other authors, the Chevalier de Chanceny, Presidente del Tourvel, and Madam Volanges are pawns in the game of seduction. The twist is that the game backfires on the puppeteers of the drama and everyone else.<br /><br />I thought the sweetest morsels were the scattered psychological insights: on people in general, the distinction between men and women and their socially appropriate relations to pleasure, the incompatibility between vanity and love. They painted a clever and cynical portrait of human nature, challenging the pretensions of society, the resonant echo of the maxims of the moralist La Rochefoucauld.<br /><br />Some readers have proposed tragedy as the appropriate category for Les Liaisons, where fate is exceedingly brutal to the protagonists and shatters all possibility of redemption of life. In classic tragedies, the protagonist(s) are virtuous, yet that makes no difference as they are destroyed by external forces or by themselves. Both Marquise de Merteil and the Valmont are exceedingly vain, and this is their virtue of excellence as well as their fatal flaw. \\"Strong swimmers always drown.\\" Because of the way novel depicts human society as something permanent, there are no apocalyptic overtones. The tragic end of the characters are somewhat absolved when society continues on, surviving their destruction. It could be argued that the excessive portrayal of the vain aristocrats was a condemnation of the aristocracy itself, which was thoroughly corrupt to the bone, a decadent society in its death throes where the Revolution was right around the corner.eetest morsels were the scattered psychological insights: on people in general, the distinction between men and women and their socially appropriate relations to pleasure, the incompatibility between vanity and love.

Both Marquise de Merteil and the Valmont are exceedingly vain, and this is their virtue of excellence as well as their fatal flaw. \\"Strong swimmers always drown.\\" Because of the way novel depicts human society as something permanent, there are no apocalyptic overtones. The tragic end of the characters are somewhat absolved when society continues on, surviving their destruction. It could be argued that the excessive portrayal of the vain aristocrats was a condemnation of the aristocracy itself, which was thoroughly corrupt to the bone, a decadent society in its death throes where the Revolution was right around the corner.
1594200440|3.0|I have just finished the book and it had a lot of bright jokes,so as a funny ha-ha it can have 5 stars.But this book is not a light little novel (remember all the travel books on France,Greece etc) it bounces all the time  from \\"bigggg boobs\\" to a hungry childhood in Soviet Ukraine. It is sadly very obvious,how Lewycka uses her novel to paint a pale row of portraits.The mother is like a small icon in the corner,perhaps it is not a wise idea to use your own mom if there will be no real information revealed.Two sisters are nervous hissing snakes with very little emotions but anger.The father he is so smart,just too good and that's why he is obused by grotesque Valentina for she is fat,stupid,greedy,lusty,messy,lazy etc.I can see someone like Lewycka (we were running for life to Britain)standing by the Ukrainian club and making nasty notes about immigrant workers from Ukraine -that one big boobs must be fake,look at that lipstick,so and so dropped a cotton ball,that one laughs too much slut,and those mini skirts!!!There is no credibility to Valentina,unless we cut her and make : Valentina A. is a good cook and pappa is not mad 84y old,but more likely in his 60s and not so poor ,he happily spends his money on the fur's.Some other Valentina B might be a gorgeous tart sleeping with a married rich guy who pays for the schooling of her yes actually very talented boy.I am sure there is a living Valentina C a rather fat simple women who takes good care of Grandpa (WITHOUT SEX)and how could he!!!!Grandpa leaves her his little house.All those Valentinas are not perfect,but they are not asking for any crowns. <br />Well,any book has + and - <br />
B000EYK4KI|3.0|Nothing like I expected, very glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater. Lots of action, But when is Hollywood going to realize that you can't outrun a hail of machine gun bullets???? Three stars may have been too generous.
B000G759LW|2.0|What Christina Aguilera has learned from her idols is not quite clear. We know she admires the style and sophistication of past generations of music, but where is it on this album?  Although supposedly inspired by blues, jazz, and soul legends such as Billie Holliday and Dinah Washington (who is sampled on the track \\"Understand\\"), the first disc plays more like a tribute to a decidely different '70s groove, and the second disc is more of a throwback to an ill-advised broadway/Cabaret show.  <br /> <br />BACK TO BASICS is undoubtedly ambitious, but where it fails is more obvious than where it succeeds. Aguilera's voice, which normally is considered a great musical instrument and combination of heart, feeling, and soul, here falls flat. She is stiff, mannered, self-conscious, and the lyrics are entirely too self-possessed. She references her last album, STRIPPED, dozens of times and many of the lyrics in the album seem like re-hashes of the same old themes.  There's \\"Still Dirrty,\\" the continuation of a STRIPPED theme, as well as a whole song with names of song titles from the last albums used as lyrics. <br /> <br />BACK TO BASICS may have been an ambitious concept, but the songwriting is downright lazy. Never has Linda Perry's work seem more forced or contrived, using the same old sing-song psuedo melodies that made Courtney Love's last disc such a bore, devoid of any truly great melody.  <br /> <br />Christina's best songs have always been ballads. She just doesn't have the rhythm or sense of swing to make the old jazz really work, not that she really is trying to evoke jazz on this album. Although the music is considered \\"reinvented,\\" it really has not a lot in common with the music of the 1920s, 30s, and 40s, with the exception of a trumpet section and a doo-wop kind of song called \\"Candy Man.\\" \\"I Got Trouble\\" is a throwback to Billie Holliday, but the songwriting and vocal performance are vague and awful. \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" was interesting, but sounded more like something Natalie Wood would sing as Gypsy Rose Lee in GYPSY than anything else.. <br /> <br />The few ballads on the disc are disappointing. There are only two which stand out: \\"Without You\\" and \\"Save me from Myself.\\" Only the first is good (mostly owing to the beautiful production), but it's not a great song.  <br /> <br />The rest of the songs suffer from just being completely over-the-top. There is no subtlety to be found anywhere on the album. From the ghastly overproduced music to the blatant vocal blasting from Christina (of which very little true emotion is registered), BACK TO BASICS is as obvious and fake as Aguilera's platinum hair.  <br /> <br />She's no Billie Holliday, kids. She's not even Doris Day.
B000B0QJM2|1.0|Like other reviewers, I think this DVD is a bluff. The appealing title (those of us who still are waiting to SEE & HEAR such concert masterpiece can only express a complete disappointment at this DVD) does not reflect the inside. The whole thing is missleading. One appreciates the music lessons given by those so-called experts appearing on the DVD, but that content is not what the average customer wants and/or expects... unless it is in the Appendix of the DVD as \\"learn more about the group...\\" or something like that.  The cover jacket of the DVD should explicitly read what it is and not mistake the reader. One thing I have learnt: I will never buy anything from this \\"Rock Milestones\\" or whatever editors... They are taking us for fools.   <br /> <br />Oscar Gallego, Madrid, Spain.
B0002W18MU|3.0|Just knowing that this was his last recording set helps put a perspective on the CD. But Groggy vocals and a CD that never really picks up, just didn't fly with me too well. The stories are classic Johnny Cash though, this made listening a few times through at least entertaining.
B000002ADT|5.0|The best album in the history of recorded music. Ever. Bar none. Can't really say much about this music that it won't say for itself. Must hear.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|With an eight-stories sequence, Kurosawa expresses the magic of chilhood, the importance of perseverance and resistance, the beauty created by Van Gogh, war and atomic menace unleashed spreading their horror, and, last but maybe most important, hope an joy when the travel finishes. A film not to be seen once but many times, and getting amazed on each.
B00008G9JO|4.0|As my title says, I love SFTW, and I bought Heavy Horses looking for the same sort of Olde English country feel.  I was a little disappointed when I did not find the album that was touted as the follow-up to SFTW to be in the same vain.  Not to say the songs are not good.  All of the songs are technically fascinating, intricate, full of heart and have beautiful melodies.  Moths, One Brown Mouse, Living in These Hard Times and Broadford Bazaar are reminiscant of SFTW.  Anderson's writing and the bands playing is incredible, with crystal clear production, interesting rhythms, and of course, thoughtful lyrics.  Overall, a good album.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I've listened to Manson since Smells Like Children, but it took Mechanical Animals to really make me a fan. This album is his glam-rock turn & I can't help but think of Bowie's \\"Ziggy Stardust & the Spiders from Mars\\". Its 14 songs have an existential feel throughout, and only 1 of them isn't golden; track 12 is the only one I skip over. This is his best work & one of my top-5 favorite albums of all time.      MM could have simply followed the success of Antichrist & pumped out another \\"look at me, I'm dark & evil\\" shock value album, but instead chose to reinvent himself with this one. I have a lot of respect for bands that take the risk of fundamentally changing their sound from one album to another.  Faith No More was a band that did this well with each album sounding completely different, yet better, than the one before. Too many bands pump out the same-sounding tunes year after year. They may still sound good, but the songs become bland  & almost indistinguishable from one another. Green Day & Godsmack are 2 such bands who have stubbornly refused to change and even though I like their over-all style, I've really grown bored with both of them.     It's a shame that MM got burned for taking this risk, in terms of sales & fan-support, and I think that his next 2 studios albums suffered for of it. They're still both good albums and worth listening to, but not nearly as good as Mechanical Animals. His evolution as an artist became stunted & I feel he tried too hard to distance himself from this perceived glam-rock failure & regain the shock value he had with Antichrist Superstar. The world had already been shocked once by Mr. Manson, and it wasn't going to be again.    This is Marilyn Manson at his creative peak. Definitely worth picking up by any fan of metal, industrial, glam-rock, synth-rock, or any brilliantly crafted music that transcends genres to become something sublime.
B000G75AE8|4.0|I've always compared Slayer to AC/DC in terms of never changing their working formula. Christ Illusion is more of what the typical Slayer fan has come to expect: killer riffs, blistering drums, anti-religious/anti-governmental themes and lyrics and Tom screaming bloody murder. In these respects, Christ Illusion is a smashing success. Dave Lombardo's reappearance for the first time on record since 1990's Seasons in the Abyss, reunites Slayer with their original lineup. Lombardo is a fantastic drummer but I was always partial to Paul Bostaph ever since the intro to Killing Fields from Divine Intervention. Nonetheless, Lombardo delivers an inspired performance behind the drum kit. King and Hanneman dole out punishment and continue to be the best 1-2 punch in metal. Tom's bass playing holds the madness together and his vocals are sharp and precise. Kerry's lyrics are bordering on devil worship these days. Lines such as \\"Hail Satan\\" and \\"I've made my choice 666\\" are prime examples of King taking his war against organized religion up a notch. There is no doubt that this record will be condemned by the litany of religious zealots in this country and hopefully give Slayer even more press! Anyway, Slayer fans will not be disappointed. While Christ Illusion is not Slayer's best album it is definitely worthy of buying and owning in your metal collection. Recommended.<br /><br />Tracks rated from 1-10<br />1.

B000002GFC|5.0|cream is called the cream because they really are the cream of the crop! no joke! the three men in the band was each the others favorite. so they decided to create thier own band! fortunatly they succeded in making one of the greatest bands ever!!
B000G75AE8|5.0|Flesh Storm opens the album, and you think you are listening to unreleased Slayer recorded in the 80's - it's that good.   Faster (Lombardo on drums, obviously it's going to be fast) and heavier than their last 10 years of product.  I have been into Slayer since hearing \\"Black Magic\\" in the 80's.   Any Slayer fan will absolutely love the disc.  They even brought back Larry Carroll to do the artwork on the cover (which is why it looks so familiar to older Slayer albums). <br /> <br />JUST BUY IT, IT KILLS!!!!

006016848X|1.0|Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates \\"escapes\\" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! <br />Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! <br />I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. <br />For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth.

B000035Z1Z|5.0|Ever since \\"Harry Met Sally\\", \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", and \\"You've Got Mail\\", Meg Ryan is synonymous with romantic comedy. Her facial expressions, amusing antics and humorous predicaments make her one of Hollywood's most adorable and adored comedic actresses. \\"French Kiss\\" meets all the above criteria, plus more. It has a great story line, twisted and twisting plot with well developed characters and romantic escapades set in Paris, Cote D'Azur and Provence (or other French wine country setting).<br /><br />Kate an American school teacher met Charley a businessman, as she plans their future life together, even to the point of scoping out a nice suburban two story future home ... She has applied for Canadian citizenship, when Charley unexpectedly is called to Paris on a business trip. Kate has a fear of flying and does not accompany him. To her shock, after several telephone calls from Paris, he breaks off their engagement telling her he is head over heals in love with Juliette ... Kate overcomes her fears and boards a plane to Paris to win back Charley ... She is seated next to a male Parisian, Luc who happens to be a thief, as they make small talk about, what else but love ... He plants a stolen necklace in her purse knowing she is the type who does not get checked by customs.<br /><br />In Paris, they collide under various circumstances, as Kate's purse is stolen in the hotel where she plans to confront Charley and his new love. Luc must retrieve the necklace ... Kate must confront Charley. The two combine forces, each seeking to use the other out of sheer necessity to get what they want ... Luc describes a failure proof technique for Kate to win Charley back. Meanhwile, they take a train to Cote D'Azure but stop at Luc's home town which is located in the French countryside with magnificent vineyards ... Kate learns about Luc and his relationship with his family, along with his future plans to own a vineyard and make a unique wine. His methods to win Charley are successful. However, at this point Kate knows her true desires and turns everything topsy turvy to everyone's surprise but her own. The film has a very satisfying ending. Erika Borsos  [pepper flower]cessful.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Eric Kripke has learned from the masters, most especially Joss Whedon. He keeps just enough humor in the show to keep you guessing when the scares will come and just enough truly scary, creepy moments to make you jump.  <br /> <br />Additionally, he's brought in Kim Manners, McG, David Nutter, John Shiban (and newly added Ben Edlund!) as well as some amazingly talented (and underrated) actors in Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki.  <br /> <br />People initially panned this show, thinking that two actors as relatively unknown as Jensen Ackles (Smallville and Dark Angel) and Jared Padalecki (House of Wax and Gilmore Girls) could not possibly carry the weight of an entire series, simply because they would be the only two recurring characters in every episode.  <br /> <br />They've surprised everyone. The chemistry and interaction between these two is incredible! They are believable as brothers and as hunters. Jensen Ackles has taken the character of Dean Winchester, a devil-may-care leather-jacketed gun-toting demon hunter and lifted it from the potential stereotype into a truly multi-dimensional character. Jared Padalecki can at times be a bit more uneven in his characterization, but he comes into his own toward the end of the season and plays well off his co-star. <br /> <br />Add to the mix Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Grey's Anatomy and Weeds) as their father and the three of them keep you glued to the screen. The tension literally jumps off the screen when the three of them work together. <br /> <br />Basic Premise: <br /> <br />John Winchester (Morgan) witnessed his wife's death at the hands of a demon 22 years ago. Since then, he's become obsessed with hunting down and killing the thing that took his Mary from him.  <br /> <br />Dean Winchester (Ackles) was 4 at the time, and carried his baby brother, Sam, from the house at his father's behest. Since then, he has been the glue that held their family together. Hunter, protector and sometimes referee. <br /> <br />Sam Winchester (Padalecki) left the family to pursue a normal life at Stanford - a life that is interrupted in the pilot in a brutal on-screen way, driving him back into his family's drifting, hunting lifestyle.  <br /> <br />Spooky, dark, funny, and angsty - this show is the real \\"MUST SEE TV\\"!

B0001KZM3O|5.0|This album takes a while to grow into the maserpiece it truly is. The concepts are as inportant today as when they were originally recorded 20+ years ago. It tells a message of politics, government and cultures gone wrong. The story of the group with the biggest guns and most money winning at all cost without concern for the people who are fighting for them or reasons for fighting Songs like A Gunners Dream, Two Suns in the Sunset, and The Final Cut are truley haunting reminders of the politics of western culture that still are evident today. While musically not as strong as some of the earlier albums, the message is just as clear to society.
B00007KWHN|5.0|great music at the peak of greatness! there still rocking to this day! dont go down like the stones (who deserved it)! great great album!!!
081541028X|5.0|This is the best book about space travel I have ever read. Michael Collins is able to tell the story in a way that makes the reader feel he was actually there. He tells his story in a very knowledable and professional manner, but even more importantly, Collins uses polite mannerisms and dignity in his writing, a virtue absent from most modern writers. This book gave me a great deal of respect for Michael Collins as an astronaut and writer, and for Michael Collins as an American with dignity. <br />

0783240287|1.0|This is yet another example of an excellent musical play made into a horrible movie. The original play was purposefully set in unrealistic situations, but at the same time the music was of excellent quality. The movie has taken the play and turned it into a comedy that is not funny. The music has become farce. Beautiful semi-classical style music from the play has been dumbed down into cheap rock junk. The singers exaggerate emotions so much that it borders on ridiculousness. Nowhere is this more present than in the narrator's horrible exaggerated singing style. The only bright spot in this movie is Donny Osmond's singing quality. He seems to be the only actor in the movie who uses breath support while singing.

0385484518|4.0|This was an inspiring short story.  Morrie is dying of Lou Gehrig's disease and shows not one ounce of fear, regret, or remorse.  He seems to know everything there is to know about living a solid lifestyle here on earth, and he shares it with one of his favorite students.  Mitch Albom is a very descriptive, in-depth writer.  The fact that he makes certain aspects of our daily life so insignificant compared to what Morrie is telling him makes the book worth while.  I highly recommend this book!!
B000G759LW|5.0|Not a voice but THE voice.  This girl can spin circles around today's muscial divas.  She has the look, the talent and damn can she sing.  So move over Beyonce, Madonna & Celine.

B000G75AE8|4.0|4.5 Stars out of 5 <br />------------------- <br /> <br />Well, this is what any old school thrash fan has waited for. And they have got what they asked for. It's the first Slayer album with Dave Lombardo since Seasons in the Abyss (1990). Many fans consider this to be their best album since that album. Personally I cxan't say that cuz I also liked Diabolus and God Hates. Hell, I like every Slayer album (ok, I never really cared for Divine Intervention, to be honest), but a good album it is. And contrary to some morons, this is not nu-metal, and neither GHUA and DIM were. Those 2 albums were not exactly thrash due to the downtuned guitars but real metal they were. The only 2 bad things I can say about those albums are that the lyrics and the vocals were weak. But other than that they were great and unfairly criticized CDs. But on the other hand Chirst Illusion is REAL thrash, not nu-metal in any aspect. I mean, can nu-metal get so intense with a dual guitar shredding and an actual GOOD drummer? Also they classic Slayer lyrics are back, this is a anti-war and anti-christian/islam album, so... not for the easily offended. And it also has the hands down best production since South of Heaven. The bass here is also quite audible. But what really makes this album rule is the guitars. Kerry and Jeff have never played this good since the late 80's.  <br /> <br />So, why not 5 stars? Well, it's not completely without flaws. I mainly have 2 complains here; a) For those who have missed the vocals on Hell Awaits, Reign in Blood, South of Heaven and Seasons, they are no different than those on DIM and GHUA (aside from the fact Tom doesn't use the F-word every 2 seconds), they're no too bad but I would be happier if they were rawer and angrier. b) The song 'Catatonic' is not too good. But besides, a near masterpiece. Everything here is amazing. <br /> <br />All the songs (except 'Catatonic') are good but my favorite is possibly the opener 'Flesh Storm' for the speed and solos. 'Eyes Of The Insane' is also very creepy. And I also like the 2 fan favorites 'Cult' and 'Jihad'. <br /> <br />So, it's not Reign in Blood, Hell Awaits or South of Heaven, but what is? This is one of the best pure thrash albums in years and one of my top 10 of metal in '06. Once you buy this, you'll foget all about the new stuff from Megadeth and Anthrax and don't get me started about those sellouts who put the middle finger to their old fans in 1991 (I think you know who I'm talking about). <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!!!
B00000272N|5.0|This album is starting to age. It needs to be remastered. I will buy it again. Overall a great album from begining to end.
0679777547|4.0|After reading all of the above reviews, you may not need to read THE CLUB DUMAS after all since so much of the book's plot has been revealed by those who still feel that a book review is just an assignment to be turned in to teacher in English IV just to prove that you read the book. It's as if someone tells you what the movie was all about before you've seen it. Just you don't hate it when that happens?  <br /> <br />That said, I would like to say that if you enjoyed reading John Durnning's BOOKED TO DIE or THE BOOKMAN'S WAKE (the Cliff Janeaway novels) I would highly recommend The Club Dumas. A bizarre labyrinth of mystery, murder and the book arts. Mr. Perez-Reverte must be praised for his research and if you are not well versed in Alexandere Dumas' literary career (the author of 257 novels, histories and memoirs), take heart, you will become very enlightened. <br /> <br />If you are interested in a limited history of the book and its role in the mystery genre... and the occult, this book will keep your fingers flipping pages. It's just an added layer in the creative complexity of a novel with many layers....  Although, to be honest, I did think the ending was a bit over the top.  <br /> <br />Hope you will enjoy it as well. I've just finished the FLANDERS PANEL and have started THE FENCING MASTER. I had to place a hold on THE SEVILLE COMMUNION. I think you get the idea.
0736697659|5.0|I love this book, and I listen to the audio version over and over again! I think Kate Reading is a terrific reader, one of the best I've heard so far. This book is one of my favorite \\"brain-candy\\" novels, partially because of the narration, and partially because of the heroine. She is a hardworker and very positive.  If you liked this book you should also check out \\"Undomestic Goddess.\\"
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Very impressed with Joaquin Phoenix's performance as Johnny Cash, Reese Witherspoon left a lot to be desired but not all is her fault, the script didn't really play well for her role as June Carter Cash, portrayal of June was pretty negative from the start until almost the very end.
B000G75AE8|4.0|Guitars sound good and are improved from the post Seasons ablums but, their still not fast enough and don't quite have the catchy groove of Slayers early stuff up to South of heaven..  The vocals are decent and a little better then the post Seasons albums however, Araya tries to hard to sound current (like Hatebreed) and loses the characteristics  he had from Show no Mercy up to seasons in the abyss which involved a subtle rythem to compliment the flow of the music.. <br />Overall this album is good, a little to literal on the religeous angle for my taste.. PRoblem with the post abyss albums is that slayer became to literal with the messages in the music rather then being artistic as they were in their early days.. They lost their mysterious mystique that they had and now appear to be just a stripped down metal band... <br />This album still gets 4 stars for the relentless guitar attack and araya's passion along with Lombardo's timely drumming which makes the music breath rather then being stale which was the case with Bosteph..
B000AMJDHY|3.0|I heard about panic playing at a club near me and i heard the show sold out in 5 days...Suddenly i realized there must be something irresistable about this band. With a name like Panic! At the disco, the band mates have got to be retarded. However, with such a terrible name they compensate with their sound. These are one of those bands, like good charlotte, like Fall out boy, like taking back sunday, like so many other before, who have fallen prone to the \\"assistance\\" of a studio engineer. In short, i want to say that they didn't harmonize, the guy making the dollar did. The producer made their sound before they probably knew what their own sound was. So, with such catchy rythyms and a very very annoying voice that you could hardly say is singing, i give props to the executive producer right now, because nobody is smiling more than him. If you want something to dance to, sure, buy this. Otherwise listen to some band with talent, like the beatles or something.
0380799006|5.0|Excellent book.  Well written. Has condensed summaries at end if one does not have time to read full text (and w/kids who has time).  Has great cartoons to provide examples and use as refresher.

074322454X|5.0|Before I read this book I had heard so many great things about it and was so excited to read another World War Two ACTION book. <br />What I didn't know was how graffic and real this book was going to be. I am only fifteen years old and this book totaly changed my thought of how war is so intense and bloody. I just could not get over how Easy Company was able to make it through fighting in Europe. This book taught me that war is such an ugly thing with people involved in it that never wanted to kill anyone.  <br />Stephen Ambrose did extremely good research and organized it so well into a book that keeps the reader awake and aware of what is going on. The book gives every little detail of Easy Company's violent tour of duty in Europe.  <br />This book is so great it is hard to describe and I guarantee you will be satisfied when you are finished reading it.
B000G759LW|5.0|This album is probably one of our generation's best. It is probably not the CLASSIC CLASSIC album that we're all hoping for, but it will definitely make its mark as one of the greatest musical achievements of our time. Perfect execution, flawless and versatile vocals (her range is amaazing.... she has the versatility that is unsurpassed by her contemporaries), and you just can't help but bee-bop with the awesome DJ Premier beats. I've never been a huge fan of Xtina, but this is undeniably a masterpiece. More power to her, and thank God, this time her image didn't overshadow her talent (Stripped, although an amazing album, was overshadowed by her image).
B000FSME1A|5.0|The Film 5/5 <br /> <br />There have been countless books, websites, and even a documentary (Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse) about this film that it seems almost pointless to write about it. One of the most troubled productions in film history, the film went on to recieve universal acclaim and is now a cinema classic.  <br /> <br />For those of you getting into this film for the first time, do not expect your typical vietnam war film. In fact you could argue that the film is not really about the Vietnam War, but is instead about man's descent into \\"the heart of darkness\\" if you will. The film follows Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen)who is given a mission to proceed up river into Cambodia to assassinate a Green Beret Colonel (Marlon Brando) who has gone insane. <br /> <br />That is the basic story of the film. But, it is much more than that. The movie is essential one sureal moment after another. From a helicopter attack done to the tune of Wagner's \\"Ride of the Valkyries\\", to surfing calvary men, to the much debated ending.  <br /> <br />If there ever was a film that must be experienced just once in your life this is it. <br /> <br />The Video 5/5 <br /> <br />The film was shot in the scope widesceen format of 2:35:1, but is present here (as with other DVD versions) at a slightly cropped 2:00:1 format. This decision (made by Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro) has caused much controversy over the years, and while I would love to see it in it's original format this version doesn't bother me.  <br /> <br />That being said this is the best I've ever seen Apocalypse Now look. The colors are much more vivid and flesh tones are more realistic. For a film that was released in 1979 it stands right up there with any modern blockbuster. Each film is spread across two discs for higher picture quality. The result is stunning. <br /> <br />Sound 5/5 <br /> <br />Speaking of standing up there with any modern blockbuster. Apocalypse Now is the Grandfather of allhome theater show off films and this new DVD set is no exception. The original discs for their time offered impressive 5.1 mixes, this one however takes it to the next level. Bass response is more dynamic and there were even obscure background sounds and dialogue that I never noticed before on the old versions. It fully uses the 5.1 system. Again for a film released in 1979 it stands toe to toe with any modern movie. <br /> <br />The Extras 4/5 <br /> <br />Apocalypse Now: The Complete Dossier is a two disc set that feature both the classic 1979 version and the extended 2001 version known as Apocalypse Now Redux. Each film is divided into two parts. While my preference is for the 1979 version. I recommend watch both versions and decide for yourself which one you prefer. <br /> <br />Extras on disc one include several deleted scenes, Marlon Brando's reading of T.S. Eliot's Poem \\"The Hollow Men\\" as well as a few short featurettes on 5.1 sound.  <br /> <br />Disc two includes several featurettes on the editing, music and sound of Apocalypse Now. These featurettes are very informative and really give you an insight into the process of assembly a film from what is essentially nothing into a cohesive whole.  <br /> <br />Above all else though is the absolutly engaging commentary by director Francis Ford Coppola. Following the same standard of excellence that was on The Godather dvds. This commentary track is extremely informative and provided insights that I've never known before.  <br /> <br />Now, what is missing however is the classic making-of documentary Hearts of Darkness. In fact there are no featurettes on this set about the making of the film. One of the reasons Apocalypse Now is so famous is that its production was arguably the most troubled in cinema history. Everything that could possibly go wrong did go wrong.  <br /> <br />In spite of the lack of Hearts of Darkness, and the slightly cropped aspect ratio. This DVD version of Apocalypse Now is head and shoulders above the previous versions.  <br /> <br />This DVD gets my highest recommendation.
B0000666DW|5.0|I've always had the sense that the genre of metal music always had a monolithic representative holding down the essence of metal...That if you were asked \\"what is metal?\\", you wouldn't have to describe it, you could just as well say \\"it's Black Sabbath\\" or \\"Metallica\\" or \\"Slayer\\" or \\"Pantera\\"...well those were the bands you could, at least at one time, say that defined metal.  I think Mastodon carries the banner of those bands for the genre now and does it well.  What is metal?  It's Mastodon. <br /> <br />This record is an excellent introduction to the band.  If you still haven't gotten into this ridiculously good band, here's where you start.
B000002C2E|5.0|In this album, you see a man raw and cut apart as if by a broadsword.  It doesn't matter if you've just lost your love, or if it has been five years or more... most will feel the hurt again... and I think that's the point.  This is great Dylan, but it may be set apart from previous releases due to its honesty and mortal character.  This may explain the low ratings by other reviewers.  I tell you, though, for listeners of Dylan with an undiscerning palate, this is terrific music.  It is in my personal top 10.
0156027321|2.0|This books sets off to a good start, however it quickly goes downhill. Something seems to be missing from Pi. Martel describes Pi's love for animals (although it doesn't seem to extend much past his father's zoo) and his exploration of religions leading to his Muslim, Christian, and Hindu devotions. However, the character seems empty and Pi does not seem to grow at all during the novel. I felt as if I could see Martel sitting at his desk writing the story, thinking of where to go next, what to say and what to do. Most of the story was implausible and yet, extremely predictable. Yes of course the story is supposed to be unbelieveable (by the end it seems that is the point), but many of the details were unimportant and the important ones were not expanded upon. Religion seemed much more of a theme at the beginning of the book and hardly stepped into play at the end. The hypocrisy of the ending is unfathomable. If you want an adventure, surely you can read this book. If you want a good adventure, read something else.
B00006AW2M|5.0|This album is really cool although between the buttons before it was hinting at this there really is no album quite like this by the  kings of rock n roll showing this band had more itelegence and creative juice then some would say. To get this album I think you need to hear alot more first like sticky fingers exile on main street ect but this is a great add on.
B000AMJDHY|2.0|I don't want to just trash this album; it's a two-star review, yes, but I have listened to this CD plenty and put lots of thought into this. I like to think of it as an educated opinion. <br /> <br />And the first thing I feel I must mention is that yes, there is a great deal of similarity in the sounds of Panic! and Fall Out Boy. I don't care what anyone says, Brendon Urie sounds exactly like Patrick Stump, and the music isn't all that different either. These bands could EASILY play covers for each other, or take each other's place at shows. No one would know the difference. <br /> <br />And is that a bad thing? Well, yes and no. I don't necessarily hold Fall Out Boy in the highest regard, but it's hard to deny that Pat Stump has a great voice, and whether Urie is purposely emulating it or whether he just naturally SOUNDS like that is of no consequence, because people love it.  <br /> <br />As for the rest of the band, the music they play is largely unoriginal. I like how they break out the techno every once in a while, but it really doesn't help the feeling that it's all been done before, and been done much better. <br /> <br />In fact, I think that bands like Panic! and Fall Out Boy are an indication of the decline of the emo genre (or, if that term offends or annoys you, the \\"pop-punk\\" genre). Few bands these days that play music like this are coming out with anything original or unique, and you're probably just as well off buying the new June CD as you are buying something by, say, Armor For Sleep.  <br /> <br />But anyway, I'm getting off-track. \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" is a CD that, quite simply, is annoyingly redundant and repetitive. Put aside the fact that it sounds a lot like any other popular music today, and you still have a CD whose tracks are so catchy and tedious that whatever novelty it holds deteriorates over the course of a whole two listens. Some CDs (dare I say most?) lose their quality over time...repeated listens aren't good to them, andeventually it's prudent to just put them aside than to bore yourself listening to the same single-layered tracks again and again. \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" suffers that exact problem, except there's the added headache that even when you're NOT listening to it, the same lines will be repeating in your head over and over...and over. I don't like catchy stuff, and that's just me. Or, maybe that's not true. I don't like music that's so catchy that listening to a mere five seconds of any one song will cause the entire song to stay stuck in my head for the rest of the day, until I just can't take it anymore.  <br /> <br />That's the biggest problem with this CD. It's TOO catchy. Every song has something about it, even if it's not the WHOLE song, that will repeat in your head until you hate yourself for ever having listened to it in the first place. \\"London Beckoned...\\" is a perfect example...\\"Well we're just a wet dream for the webzines / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene\\" is perhaps the catchiest point of the entire CD, and it's fun at first, but after hearing it in your head thirty times straight it's torture, plain and simple. And then there's \\"Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster!\\" from \\"Lying is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have...\\" which suffers the same problem. \\"I Write Sins, Not Tragedies\\" is a terrible choice for a single, and the chorus is among the most repetitive on the whole album. It reminds me of \\"Liar (It Takes One to Know One)\\" off of Taking Back Sunday's newest release, which is not a good thing. And let's not even get into \\"The Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide is Press Coverage\\". <br /> <br />Oh, and I also hate how Panic! decided to name most of their songs. Yeah, it's cute at first, and kind of intriguing, but now it just comes off as pretentious to me. Kind of like most of this album. <br /> <br />I gave this CD two stars because I like the song \\"Camisado\\", and like I've already said, Urie's voice is smooth and it works well, even if he's not the most unique singer in the world. <br /> <br />Of course, don't let me dissuade you from buying this CD. If you're into this genre, and you enjoy really catchy music, then you'll no doubt find something here worth having. For me it's \\"Camisado\\", for you it may be the rest of the CD. I personally wish this whole genre would just die before it gets any worse, and hopefully before long we'll start seeing less new stuff from bands like this. Unfortunately I have to put up with it for now. <br /> <br />Oh well.
B000G759LW|5.0|Out of all the current pop artists out there, Christina Aguilera definitely has the most potential to be a true legend! I didn't really know what to expect when I bought it, but I was really blown away when I heard it. It really makes me feel like I'm in the movie \\"Chicago\\". My favorite songs are as follows:    Here to Stay  Back in the Day  Candyman  Without You  Slow Down Baby  On Our Way  Hurt  Intro    It costs $12, and for two CD's, that's not too shabby! Her voice is phenomenal, the music is original, and she looks gorgeous!
0385338082|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a fun fast-paced read.  I can't wait to read other Kinsella's books!
B000G759LW|5.0|I'm not a big endorser of pop artists, but as a music lover this is something worth highlighting- especially Disc 2 where Christina embraces a soulful, eclectic and fun sound. Here's the breakdown: <br /> <br />1. ENTER THE CIRCUS: Linda Perry lures us into a twisted musical adventure with this Moulin Rouge-esq intro. Great! <br /> <br />2. WELCOME: Christina soars through a grand landscape of sounds usually exclusive to someone like Rufus Wainwright. <br /> <br />3. CANDYMAN: A fun but modern throwback to Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy drizzled in sweet. <br /> <br />4. NASTY NAUGHTY BOY:  The cast of CHICAGO may have a new routine to learn. This easily blows away Madonna's I'm Breathless act. <br /> <br />5. I GOT TROUBLE: Trouble never sounded so good, as once demonstrated by Etta James, Bessie Smith, Nina Simone. <br /> <br />6. HURT:  Starts out with a hint of Zepplin but quickly turns into a full-blown ballad that's perfect for restraining pretty, high-octane voices.  <br /> <br />7. MERCY ON ME:  Self-reflecting confessional-type tune that gave Fiona Apple a career. Check the organs as they deliver Christina from her past sins. <br /> <br />8. SAVE ME FROM MYSELF:  A new modern day classic that should join the ranks of Norah Jones. <br /> <br />9. THE RIGHT MAN:  Would have stopped at eight tracks and left this one off - We're happy your married honey but this is too much icing on the cake. <br /> <br /> <br />Definitely worth the price of admission! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000006NPY|5.0|Despite all the nay-sayers, this was and is a truly great album. It is by far the best of the Smashing Pumpkins albums and Shame is the most lush, beautiful and profound song I have ever heard. It will transport you to another universe!
B000BKJ78K|3.0|Kind of upset :( <br /> <br />I was not expecting any changes, besides maybe special effects. I could have done without the special effects changes, now that I think of it. <br /> <br />I have not seen this movies in a very long time, thought, well I loved them back in the day, this is going to be awesome... <br /> <br />Two things that jumped at me was the han and greedo, is that his name, shooting. When Han shot him, I thought I missed something, I was like that was kind of weird, but okay... Second thing was the conversation with Biggs, I was like huh, I don't remember that. <br /> <br />After these two things, I started to question \\"what else had changed\\"... Then I started reading reviews online and was really upset that the movies did change and I was not imaging things.  <br /> <br />Atleast, I own the movies now, and I know what was changed, more then what I had thought changed during my first viewing. <br /> <br />I wish I read the reviews and realized that later this year, like in less then a month, the unedited versions are coming out...
B00005JOYM|5.0|This is such an amazing movie! I guess Oliver Stone is known for shoving his own little ideas and conspiriacy theories into his movies but this movie is the exception. I am sure if he even tried, any actor with a right mind would have declined. This movie makes the day much more personal and real, as we follow the two main characters and their families. It brought back my own memories from that day (and entire week) and even more so, this movie made it even more real (since I was living in Alaska at the time). If I was in those people's situations, I probably would be in a cataonic state or crying my eyes out in a hole somewhere. This is a true story and is very respectful of the lives this movie is based on. Such an amazing movie. I think all of us can remember that day almost 5 years ago, it was a big part of history for all of us, especially if you are American. Go and see this movie!
038533348X|5.0|I've read many of Vonnegut's books over the past few years and I have to say that this is easily his greatest work.  It contains a gripping tale about a protagonist that is stuck in a world that is almost certainly doomed to fail.  Along the way there are many interesting thoughts expressed and funny moments.
B000HCO840|1.0|This last instalment of X-Men seems to have been thrown together with no sense of direction or purpose. <br />After an astonishing sequel which left all audiences in eager anticipation of the final culmination, everything just fell flat. <br />To give idea of how the plot should have been, there are basic themes running throughout the movies.  The main one is acceptance of differences and overcoming predujices between humans and mutants. <br />In the first instalment we are introduced to the mutants and their struggle to be recognized and accepted in society.  <br />The plot centers on the differing opinions of Professor Xavier and Magneto who have their own methods on how to deal with the problem and are opposed to each other because of this. <br />In the second instalment, the two opposing factions of Mutants (Xavier's group and Magneto's) find themselves working together despite their differences to foil the humans plan to wipe off Mutants from the face of the earth. The sacrifice of Jean Grey <br />in this second installment provides the perfect background for the third twist, where the MUTANTS and the HUMANS must work together to eliminate the worst possible threat to the entire earth in the form of the ressurected Jean Grey aka DARK PHOENIX.  This would have been the perfect culmination of the trilogy as it would challenge the beliefs and values of the mutants, ie after having so long fought for mutant rights, having to overcome fears and predjudices of humans, will the mutants react to Jean Grey turned DARK PHOENIX with the same fear and dread as the humans have regarded them all along?  <br />In the comic storyline, Dark Phoenix is responsible for destroying an entire solar system.  Can one imagine the reaction of the other Mutants if Jean Grey destroyed and entire city, e.g. New York?  And in the wake of such destruction the other Mutants who have hated humans would have to use their powers to rescue and protect them instead. Likewise the humans would alsohave a shock to their belief system if they were saved and protected by the Mutants they so despised. <br />The development of the mutant cure could have resolved the delimma of saving Jean Grey rather than being the main issue of contention for the film, and everything would have worked out just perfectly in the end. <br />Although this is my personal opinion, I am sure there are many persons who would agree with me on how the plot should have gone. <br />It's a pity one can't redo a movie. Maybe in future there could be several versions of the same movie made to suit different audiences. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

0684800713|5.0|I sit writing this review from a beach chair.  Since the day is gorgeous, I anticipate the sort of joy Hemingway celebrates.  Among other things, he was a connoisseur of the natural world.  He was also a connoisseur of the sorts of emotion experienced as one looks forward to an adventure. The book is dedicated to EW's first wife and his child.  The first copyright is 1926, eighty years ago.   <br /> <br />Robert Cohn boxed at Princeton to overcome feelings of inferiority and shyness.  He fought only in the gym.  In Paris he read books, wrote a novel, played tennis and bridge, and boxed.  Robert went back to America with his novel.  The publishers praised the work.  Returning to France, Robert had become a very successful bridge player and had learned that women liked him.  He asked Jake Barnes, the books narreator, to go with him to South America, having read W.H. Hudson.  Robert Cohn became interested in Brett, Lady Ashley.  Jake's head worked on old grievances.  It was a rotten way to be wounded and it was a joke.  Jake started to cry thinking he wouldn't have Brett.  Brett is getting a divorce and she intends to marry Mike Campbell.  At the Cafe Select Jake encounters Harvey Stone.  In trying to begin his second book, Robert Cohn has lost his sureness.  Jake begs Brett for them to live together.  She says that it would not work.   <br /> <br />Jake plans to shove off to Spain with Bill Gorton at the end of June.  They are to go to the fiesta in Pamplona.  Mike Campbell and Brett and Robert Cohn will also go to Pamplona.  Robert Cohn, naive, brings out the worst in everybody.  Jake admits to Bill that he has been in love with Brett, on and off, for a long time.  The members of the party stay at the Montoya Hotel.  Senor Montoya asks Jake if Bill is another aficionado.  At Pamplona Jake is reading a story in THE SPORTSMAN'S SKETCHES.  Jake hears Brett and Robert climb the stairs in each other's company.  There is a big religious procession.  San Fermin is transferred from church to church.   <br /> <br />Pedro Romero, a new matador, is outstanding.  He keeps a pure line facing the maximum amount of danger in the presence of the bull.  It seems that Pedro Romero learned some English in Gilbraltar.  Brett tells Jake she believes she is in love with Pedro Romero.  Mike announces that Brett has gone off with the bull fighter chap.  Later, summoned, Brett and Jake rendez-vous in Madrid.
B000G759LW|3.0|This cd has been promoted as a throw-back-retro of the blues, jazz, <br />and soul cultivated during the past five decades . . . unfortunately it gives \\"lip service\\" to some of the greatest black performers from these enlightened times, but Aguilera's admission of a past rich in these genres does not mean she measures up to the task. Imitation this time is less than flattering to the R&B artists she holds in such high esteem.  Admittedly she has a great and mature voice as evidenced by her collaboration with Herbie Hancock and Andrea Bocelli; this album, however, is characterized by self-indulgent songs that certainly capture the power of Aguilera's life and times, but these songs are not an affirmation of the great music exemplified by the blues, jazz, and soul from previous generations.
B000001DQI|5.0|I am not a huge Elton John fan, however I am a huge music fan and I like to think I know good music when I hear it. <br />Great choice of sounds and instruments, well written songs, great lyrics, and of course, Elton's strange and powerfully beautiful style. <br />I have always thought Elton had a very unique style that was hard to pin down.  It seems to me that his personal uniqueness has come about from attempting to sound like American country while not successfully escaping his English accent.  Listen to \\"the Ballad of Danny Bailey\\" and tell me I'm wrong.   <br /> <br />  Regardless how this music came about, it works, and its fantasitic.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|What can you say about St. Elsewhere that most have come to agree on? Danger Mouse and Cee-Lo really put out the most significant Hip Hop cd since Outkast's double lp. Some compare these two gifted acts, but they are only similar in that they both were able to get a record out that was eccentric and solid.<br /><br />From the beginning of the CD, Go-Go Gadget gets things going by pumping out major blistering vocals and energy. Everyone's favorite \\"Crazy\\" is a great tune that should be considered cut of the year. Two tracks worth mentioning and my personal favorites are \\"Who Cares\\" and \\"Feng Shui\\".<br /><br />A serious consideration for record of the year.
B00005JP7M|4.0|The story begins when the Great Splendini (Woody Allen aka Sid Waterman) performs a magic trick on Scarlett Johansson's character, Sondra Pransky (an American journalism student spending the summer with her wealthy British friend in London).  The magic trick goes awry and brings back the spirit of a recently deceased, well-known journalist (played by the great Ian McShane of Deadwood fame) with \\"the scoop of the century.\\"  The thing is, he discovers the scoop, involving a serial killer (the tarot card killer), on his way to the hereafter directly from one of the killer's victims and not being able to break the story himself, manages to get messages to Sondra through the magical talents of Splendini.  It turns out that this particular victim was poisoned because she was about to blow the whistle on the killer who just happened to be the son of a British Lord.  The son is Peter Lyman, played by Hugh Jackman.  I won't say anything more about the story because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't already seen it.  There are some interesting twists as Scarlett and Woody try to break the story as a faux father/daughter combo.<br /><br />That said, I thought the casting was so good because it went against stereotypes: Hugh Jackman as a bad guy (yes, one CAN be handsome AND evil all at the same time) and Scarlett Johansson as a nerdier version of herself.  Woody was classic Woody (but you just don't mess with that).  I felt that this film showed Woody evolving.  Perhaps some people were disappointed because they are accustomed to Woody a certain way - the old way - when Diane Keaton was a regular in his films.  But you have to give the guy credit for stepping out of the box and asking his actors to do the same.  I think some people might have been disappointed too with Scarlett in a not so glamorous role but I found that I liked her better because of it.  People get too comfortable with directors/actors/writers doing similar projects over and over that they end up feeling let down if the director/actor/writer does something new or different.  Change is good though.<br /><br />This is a perfect movie to see if you feel like laughing until you hurt.  When I saw it in the theatre, the noise level (laughing) got so loud that it was, at times, difficult to hear some of the dialogue.  Every so often, you need a film that is just plain entertaining and fun - even over the top as this one is at times.  Recommend.let down if the director/actor/writer does something new or different.

B00000HYXB|5.0|I wouldn't say it's their best album (I just love _Imaginations from the Other Side_, y'see), but Blind Guardian's _Nightfall in Middle-Earth_ is an epic tour-de-force that sets a whole new standard for the band in terms of over-the-top, bombastic choral power metal. There is less overtly thrashy power metal driving at top speeds, and more elaborate arrangements, variety, and vocal domination. The razor-edge vocals of Hansi are sounding a little more tempered, the metal sound of the band a little more blended, and the reach of the music more ambitious. Most of all, Blind Guardian `authenticates' its fantasy-metal sound with even more musical resources that makes NIME's rather, erm, nerd-like pretenses stupidly credible. Yes, the album is all about Tolkien's _Silmarillion_, not a book I have any interest in - so NIME covered with an abundance of voice-over passages with evil sounding narratives. Cheesy? Oh yeah. But the good news is that the whole story lends itself to amazing metal lines on which Hansi's voice thrives (\\"Revenge be mine!\\"; \\"My mind's in frozen dreams, the rotten flesh of bitter lies\\"; \\"Fear my curse!\\"; et cetera). And the songs are just awesome, apparently taking the dark menace of their concept and manipulating perfectly to their ends. As a concept album, the flow is a little broken up at the end by the time \\"Thorn\\" rolls around. But I am obsessive about structure, and in any case the songs are mostly amazing, with some of the best choruses Blind Guardian has ever produced. \\"Into the Storm\\", \\"Blood Tears\\", \\"Noldor\\", \\"The Curse of Feanor\\", \\"Mirror Mirror\\", \\"When Sorrow Sang\\" \\"Time Stands Still (At the Iron Hill)\\" - these are breathtaking, hugely inspiring aural onslaughts of multitracked vox. There are more vocal harmonies than ever, and more medieval/renaissance influences than before - they are integrated through numerous guitar phrases, vocal lines, and melodic contours. Bardic interludes, like \\"The Minstrel\\" and \\"Out on the Water\\", cover the softer side of the album with classical guitars, flutes, and forest sounds, adding a lot of atmosphere. There are no ballads of the sort like \\"Bard's Song - In the Forest\\", \\"Lord of the Rings\\", or \\"A Past and Future Secret\\" - but there is the surprising, eerie and beautiful \\"The Eldar\\" - a piano based piece with that is unique among BG tracks, and featuring the most delicate, astonishing performance by Hansi to date. The music has evolved to the point where even prog-metallers might get hooked by some of the characteristics here - complex arrangements, snaky time-changes, and \\"texturizing\\" metal guitars are things you don't hear in a lot of power metal bands. Flemming Rasmussen's production is titantic and thundering. Let me add another voice to the great volume of praise already showered upon this wonderful disc.er side of the album with classical guitars, flutes, and forest sounds, adding a lot of atmosphere.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and I've seen it a couple of times now.  The only improvement would have been to make it 5-6 hours long--as is the BBC version.  This story moved so fast I'm glad I had it on DVD to pause and watch some scenes again.  If you weren't familiar with the book or BBC version, you might get lost.  I thought the character developement could have been better.  But all in all, Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are a great couple in this movie.  Their glances and small gestures are perfect.  I love one of the very last scenes where Mr. Darcy is walking towards her and the camera stays on him the whole way.  I thought the cinematography was wonderful.  I almost want to visit Stanage Edge where Elizabeth stood looking out over the valley.  I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B00005R62N|5.0|The Setlist, The Production, and especially the performance can't get any better... This was the 1st Priest Album I bought over 25 years ago and I have never grown tired of it. Unleashed in the East is ... an alltime classic!
B0002EXH40|5.0|... and this is undoubtedly Megadeth's. <br /> <br />I will admit that upon purchasing Youthanasia way back in 1994 I was a little bit disappointed. Not because it sucked, but because it seemed to lack energy. And also because -- and I laugh at myself now -- the production seemed way too good. What? You can hear every warm little nuance of what is being performed, including the subtleties of the bass player? What gives? <br /> <br />Indeed, maybe it's because I was young and wanted everything to sound dark and cold and, of course, fast! <br /> <br />Well, as the years passed by, I came to realize that this album is full of incredible riffs, some of Dave Mustaine's absolute best vocal work and lyrics, and brilliant Marty Friedman and Mustaine solos at every turn. In fact, turning down the tempo really reveals how well Megadeth can groove as well as let their riffing get into a lot more detail.  <br /> <br />There really isn't a bad song on here, but my favorites are probably the openers \\"Reckoning Day\\" and \\"Train of Consequences,\\" \\"A Tout Le Monde,\\" \\"I Thought I Knew It All,\\" \\"Black Curtains\\" and the surprisingly catchy \\"Family Tree.\\" The title track is probably the low point for me, not because there is technically anything wrong with it but the melodic ideas are just not to my taste. It has an awesome double-time breakdown, though. And the closer \\"Victory\\" is just genius in it's driving beat coupled with the lyrics, which creatively chain together a career's worth of song titles. Nice. <br /> <br />All in all, it was preconceived notions that got the best of me and many other metal fans out there when this first came out. I think most Megadeth fans have come to hold this album among their absolute favorites, or at least appreciate it as a tried and true metal album, if not a speed metal one. <br /> <br />
B00008PX8P|5.0|If you are a Led Zeppelin fan of any kind, you need to own this DVD.  A friend of mine let me borrow this DVD and I've been watching it almost every night for the past month and half.  This is what true artistry and musicianship is all about.  It is a jaw-dropping experience!  The Royal Albert Hall footage of Page playing Dazed and Confused is nothing short of a musical miracle.  You will also see a young Bonzo performing an awesome rendition of Moby Dick.  My favorite part is the Earl's Court footage which is superb.  I have been a Ledhead since my High School days back in the 70's.  I grew up on their music and they hold a special place in my heart.  Everytime I listen to their music, it's like I'm listening to it for the first time.  It brings me such joy!  This project was a labor of love for Jimmy Page and it shows.  I was lucky enough to see Zeppelin at the Garden in '73 and '77 when they were in their prime.  This folks is Rock n' Roll at it's very best.  What can I say about these guys that hasn't already been said?  Get the DVD!!!

B000G759LW|4.0|Christina can sing. She is so talented and her voice is so strong which makes this album very enjoyable to listen too. some have complained about the jazzy feel to this album but I actually love the jazzy retroness of the album. If there's a bad song it doesn't even matter because Christina's voice makes you forget. Listening to Christina sing it's sad that at one time she was compared to Britney, in no way is Britney even close to her level.
B000G759LW|5.0|it seems that Joan crawford, \\"Jon\\", loves the classic movie stars, YET, she fails to see a true classic in the making, <br />christina is only in her 20's, and she already displays amazing talent, far beyond her years, mark my words, by the time she reaches her late 30's  and early 40's,  no one will ever talk about her in the same breath as those wannabes like whitney, mariah, alicia, beyonce?  big joke, mary J blige?  big joke, <br />all those rap queens are a sad joke, next to christina, <br />christina  is a true classic,  she is the real deal, everything about her screams classic,  her look, her persona, her beauty, <br />all her life, she has had people take shots at her, girls have always been envious of her looks, her talent, and her amazing voice,  especially the black community, they cant stand the fact, that a white girl, can make them look foolish, <br />I LOVE IT!!!!!! <br />this reminds me of another legend, THE KING, mention the name ELVIS, and the black community quivers,  they lie and call him a racist,  they say he has no talent, they say he stole from blacks, I LAUGH OUT LOUD at the stupidity and sheer ignorance of black leaders who make such racist remarks about the KING, <br />after seriously studying the career of elvis presley for over 25 years,  you get an education in \\"soul\\", the black community cannot stand the fact that a white singer like elvis, can out sing ANY black singer, any day of the week, and, come back and make you look foolish, <br />I love the strong comparisons here,  the hatred of christina and elvis, because BOTH these artists make you feel like a loser, <br />WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO BRASS TACKS,  thats what this is all about, <br />its about rappers and hip hop losers, with zero self-esteem, lashing out at two GREATS. <br />its basic human psychology 101, people have been doing it for all of history, when you hate yourself, lash out and lie about others, to make yourself feel better, ONLY PROBLEM IS, educated people like myself, will expose you for the loser that you are, <br />how do you like dem apples? <br />

Easily the most breath-taking visuals I've seen since Sin City, and some of the best acting I've seen since Crash. Hugo Weaving as V is one of the coolest characters I can remember, and he plays it perfectly. I thought Natalie Portman was just awful in the Star Wars trilogy, in fact I really haven't liked much of anything she's done, but she absolutely nailed this, a crafty mix of innocent and troubled persona holding on to a disturbing secret and violent past.<br /><br />The Wachowski Brothers and there protege' James McTeigue have created a masterpiece that I eagerly look forward to purchasing and watching many, many times. Bound to upset others, but I found this to be just as entertaining (if not more) as the Wachowski's 1st visual feast, The Matrix. I know that Alan Moore asked for his name to be removed from the production as he was upset over a few of the minor changes, but Mr. Moore, you have nothing to be ashamed of, you're novel has been transformed into the best movie of 2006, and you know what, I think I just might go watch it again right now, see ya!!!a!!!
B000G759LW|5.0|I'll admit my biases up front: I think Christina Aguilera is just immensely, immensely talented.  That she was ever miscast as a peer or contemporary of the likes of Britney Spears is one of the great mysteries of pop music reviewing I'll never grasp.  Second bias - I think Stripped is one of the most honest, most musically diverse and most amazing sophomore efforts (not counting concept albums like Mi Reflejo) in recent pop music history.<br /><br />That said, that she is taking yet another fork in the road in the evolution of her own music is in and of itself a remarkable achievement in a popular music scene rife with music that sounds the same, substitutes guest rappers in for real originality and employs endless studio trickery to disguise the fact that most of today's artists really don't deserve the name (nor can they sing).<br /><br />This album is not a jazz album, it's not a soul album, and it's not a pop album.  It's a little bit of all of the above, inspired by the music that Christina grew up listening to and learning to sing from.  Since her cover of Etta James' signature \\"At Last\\" it's been apparent the depth Christina truly feels the music she sings.  The myriad styles and subtle but noticeable inflections in her voice are not only amazing to listen to, they show that as an artist, Christina Aguilera cares immensely about her craft and that she wants to push the art form to newer places with every album.  I've only had the album two days, and already I'm finding new favorites with every listen (though it's hard to resist the Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy-influenced Candyman a few times in a row..)<br /><br />This is not an album that will likely spawn a number of radio singles, because radio by its very nature exists to promote the status quo.. it rarely pushes the envelope.  However, if you want to take a bit of a musical journey and hear the interpretations borne out of Christina's enjoyment of a lifetime's worth some of the most beautiful, soulful and passionate music of the last 100 years - as well as some of the most purely enjoyable and sugary - this double CD is more than worth the investment.  It was worth the wait.and passionate music of the last 100 years - as well as some of the most purely enjoyable and sugary - this double CD is more than worth the investment.  It was worth the wait.

B00005JKEZ|5.0|My children sit riveted to this old movie.  They simply love it.  I had rented it a couple of times, and finally decided it was worth owning.  I love the good old-fashioned values...no swearing, nudity, sexual innuendos, or gratuitous violence.  Nothing for parents to worry about here!  This version is colorized, fyi, for those children who might be black-and-white-phobic.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|This movie starts off with a woman and a man kissing each other goodbye, then the woman goes on a plane.  Then it flashbacks to when they first met; at his lecture.  His name is Justin and her name is Tessa.  Tessa gets pregnant and after 9 months loses the baby.  I'm not sure what Tessa's profession was, nor am i interested, but i think she liked going to other countries to help out certain people. <br /> <br />Very slow moving and boring.  It kept going back and forth from flashback to present, most of the time i wouldn't know what was going on.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I'm not sure what all the whining is about from the reviewers who are upset that this edition does not include the documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmakers Apocalypse.\\"  Yes the documentary is a brilliant piece of filmmaking and it would have been nice to include it in this release, but its exclusion in no way detracts from what is an excellent DVD release filled with excellent behind-the-scenes documentaries (including all new never-before-seen footage and interviews), illuminating commentary from Francis Coppola, and an excellent package.  We also get lengthy \\"outtakes\\" which are pulled from the 5 1/2 hour cut (Which I have also seen.  Trust me, you are not missing anything.)<br /><br />As for the disc change that is required to view the entire film, this seems to be done to ensure a high-quality transfer without having to sacrifice on additional features.  As Coppola and Michael Herr point out in the documentaries, the film was originally planned to have an intermission which these DVDs seem to emulate.  (To achieve both fims on one disc, the producer, Kim Aubrey, wisely chose a \\"branching\\" method where you basically have the '79 version and then branch to the extra scenes. Permitting optimum bit rate playback.) Personally, I will always prefer a quality transfer with an acceptable disc change, rather than a poorer quality film that is on a single disc. (For those who say they have never seen this done, have you checked out Godfather Part II???  It's on TWO DISCS even though in the theatre it was shown without an intermission.  I don't get what all the complaining is about!!)<br /><br />Basically, if you are fan of the movie or this is a first-time purchase, this is a tremendous value that is packed full of additional features.  It IS a complete package of the entire scope of the film, covering the entire span of its development to its final release in 2001.  This DVD is outstanding!!

B000002B35|2.0|This album lacks more than just energy, it lacks that surrealisism that we attracted Pink Floyd fans in the first place.  The music itself is technically well played but the vocals are, at best, flat and at times downright pathetic.  With hokey emphasis on specific words that remind me of how perhaps a fourteen year old may sing these songs.  Perhaps it is just me, but the original surreal quality of Pink I always stemmed from the almost \\"matter of fact\\" way Waters sang songs like Run like hell.  This album places almost juvenile over emphasis on thier lyrics that destroys the surrealistic style of the original music.  Pink Floyd fans of all types will find this album just plain lacking.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Superb music. All track are great. Jackson varies great fast stuffs (Bad, The way you make me feel, Another part of me) with beautiful ballads (Liberian girl, I just can't stop loving you).

Yes, there was songs on this album which I didn't like (Speed Demon or Smooth criminal) but in comparison with today's music they are great. <br />More than respectable music.

B000008I4Z|4.0|This review is for the 1994 single disc issue. <br />You have to listen to this album several times, let it sink in for a while. Marillion take their time to get to the point, but it's well worth it. It's not a masterpiece, but in my opinion it is very pleasant- at times just plain beautiful, somewhat challenging musically, and quite successful as a concept album. If anything, the band could have taken more creative risks- I think the drummer in particular is not as articulate as could be. Anyway, it is good enough so that if somebody stole this cd from me, I'd definitey replace it. I suspect I'll listen to it regularly. <br />Some angry reviewer stated that this is not \\"rock\\" as it is a bad thing. It is indeed on the slow side as a whole, but frankly, as long as I enjoy the music, I don't give a rat's @$$ for the genre label. If you want some fast paced music, play something else.

B00005JL0I|2.0|This may be the first cinematic spoof that requires Cliffs Notes.  Deep down, buried somewhere inside of this incessant film, there is something like a plot, but I don't know that all of the pieces are ever brought together in anything resembling a satisfactory manner.  Characters come and go, are recruited with no apparent function, commit outrageous acts for unclear purposes.  This is less a coherent film than it is a series of skits, interspersed, and loosely connected by (exceptional) production design.  I recognize that plot was not the driving motivation of the filmmakers, but let us consider the modern day equivalent: Austin Powers. <br /> <br />Austin Powers covers the same ground and covers it better.  The plot is grossly simplified and stereotypical, thus serving the function of a spoof.  The scenes are never essential per se but do serve to the further what little plot there is.  Characters are recognizable by their Dickensian idiosyncrasies.  Casino Royale does not accomplish any of these characteristics.  In fact, I guarantee that any person who watches a genuine James Bond film at random will laugh harder and more often than someone watching Casino Royale.  What the filmmakers failed to realize was that, to a certain extent, the real James Bond already is a spoof.  His sex-crazed machismo is as far from realistic as can be; he is a caricature of cinema stereotypes.  It's impossible to spoof a spoof, and that is why Casino Royale is such a failure. <br /> <br />The only impression it can leave upon the viewer is one of excess: you feel literally glutted after watching it.  It is too long, there are too many characters, there are too many plot threads, there are too many sets, there are too many scenes, and then you get to the climatic fight(?) scene, then there are too many people--cowboys, Indians, the French, etc.  It's senseless, pointless, and stuffs the viewer to the point of dyspepsia.  It is an overbearing, overdone, overlong film that should have been scrapped on the drawing board. <br />

0800130928|5.0|Its not often that you come across a movie so completely dominated by one character. True, no character in the movie is as fleshed out as De Niro's - Cybill Shepherd, Harvey Keitel & Jodi Foster to name a few, all play important roles but none of them so completely dominates the screen as De Niro. And it is in this characterization and its treatment do we see directorial brilliance. <br /> <br />At its heart, the story (and probably this is just my interpretation) is about Solitude and one mans search purpose to his existence. De Niro stars as a Taxi Driver, drifting mostly, searching for a cause to hook himself to. But he also seems like your typical slightly-above-intelligence guy who tires of his purpose and explains it away or does something about it. So he's in the army and leaves, and has strange quirks like being unable to sleep much. He decides to date Cybill, campaign for the presidential candidate, rescue a child-prostitute, dream himself as a secret agent on an important mission etc. The movie is sometimes hilarious, especially when De Niro's character shaves his head as a punk and attempts to pursue the cause of cleaning-up-society.  <br /> <br />But on the darker side, the movie deals with a man and his experience with solitude, the kind of fantasies he develops to help him get thru the monotony and how these fantasies soon start to control him and the line between imagination and reality blurs, where the movie and viewer unite in an unrivaled and unparalleled movie viewing experience. Probably one of the best movies on the darker side.
140003180X|5.0|So many series start to wane by the time the 4th installment comes out, but not so with Smith's No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books.  This installment, The Kalahari Typing School for Men is directly on the level of the previous three books--delightful, peaceful, witty, charming.<br /><br />This installment finds Mma Makutsi feeling down because she is \\"just\\" an assistant manager/detective and she wants more out of her life.  She would also like the attention of a good man.  Not only that, but the responsibilities of taking care of her family back home and her ailing brother living with her have depleted her savings and are hurting her ability to make ends meet.  After much thinking, she decides to open the Kalahari Typing School for Men to make some extra money--there she thinks she finds the love of a man, but what she ends up finding is the love of herself.<br /><br />Mma Romatse must solve a couple of mysteries--another errant husband and a man who did something bad in his youth and wants to make amends.  These are so lightly tossed in there that you hardly realize the tough detective work that Precious must do--she's definitely one smart cookie!<br /><br />When I finished, I found myself thinking \\"I want to grow up and be Precious Romatswe\\" but then I realized that 1) I AM grown up already and 2) Precious is really my age.  She is such a smart, patient, peaceful, wonderful person who sees the good in people and tries to do her best no matter what.  I would love to be like that--to be able to step back from the things swirling around in my life and just breathe and let things work themselves out.
B000GGSM76|3.0|A distinct change of direction, \\"The Head on the Door\\" finds the Cure drifting towards pop music for the first time.  This is really enabled by the band-- with the return of bassist Simon Gallup to the fold, leader/vocalist/guitarist Robert Smith had the anchor that the band needed.  Gallup could play the morbid, goth sort of basslines that the band cut their teeth on, but he could also manage a bright funk and pop sound.  Ditto for drummer Boris Williams, who provided a fine foil for Gallup in the rhythm section.  But just as key was the presence of guitarist Porl Thompson, who allowed Smith to construct shimmering guitar textures.  The group is rounded out by founding member Lol Tolhurst, contributing on keyboards (although in the liner notes, his contribution is played down quite a bit). <br /> <br />The shift in sound is obvious right from the start-- bright acoustics, delicate synths and an overall light touch lead the superb \\"In Between Days\\".  Likewise throughout the album, this variation of texture is what carries the record-- the minimalist Asian textures (\\"Kyoto Song\\"), Spanish gypsy rhythms (\\"The Blood\\"), funky bass (standout track and single \\"Close to Me\\") and frantic, punky stuff that wouldn't've sounded out of place on their debut but for the improved songwriting and musicianship (\\"The Baby Screams\\"). <br /> <br />Still, for all this good, sometimes it gets a bit dull (\\"Six Different Ways\\") and the pieces occasionally don't take off and aren't exactly memorable (\\"Push\\", \\"Screw\\").  The net result is a mixed bag, when it's good, it's great, but while none of it is bad per se, some of it doesn't stand out. <br /> <br />The deluxe edition of the album features fantastically remastered sound, a set of demos including material that didn't make the album, and a handful of live tracks.  It makes for a fine collection and in many cases, the evolution of the pieces is obvious.  What's noticably missing is the significantly hotter single remix of \\"Close to Me\\" that ended up on \\"Staring at the Sea\\" (and subsequently \\"Greatest Hits\\").  At the least, the whole record sounds absolutely fantastic courtesy of remastering and includes a nice booklet detailing the band's history during the recording. <br /> <br />A lot of folks really love this album, I've always looked at it as a stepping stone on the way to \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\"-- it's a decent record, but they'd very shortly do much better.
B0000017CA|5.0|I am serious when I say this. You will not want to take this out of your disc player. Acid Bath, along with Crowbar, Soilent Green, Down, Eyehategod, and a few select others, hail from the New Orleans sludge metal scene that basically broke the rules and played metal in the vein of early Black Sabbath.<br /><br />Acid Bath stands out the most out of all of these bands. They are a mix of sludge, death metal, black metal, hardcore, grindcore, and everything along those lines. The band also throws in its share of acoustic ballads as well (\\"Scream of the Butterfly\\").<br /><br />\\"The Blue\\", the track that starts it all, is a more melodic track with its share of tempo changes. Then we have \\"Tranquilized\\", which would have probably been a standout single for this band. It's a faster track that still carries that drone feeling. \\"Cheap Vodka\\" goes into punk/crust speed and only lasts just over 2 minutes. \\"Finger Paintings of the Insane\\" brings the speed down and is more of a doom/sludge track. \\"Jezebel\\" starts off by bringing its elements of death/thrash metal riffage and then simmers down when it hits the chorus. \\"Scream of the Butterfly\\", as I said before, is an acoustic ballad. A nice change throughout the duration. However, the mellowness quits with \\"Dr. Seuss Is Dead\\", another sludgy track that actually starts off with a slow feel. \\"Dope Fiend\\" brings back the feel that \\"The Blue\\" provided. \\"Toubabo Koomi\\", the promo single of this album, is one amazing song. Starts off quick, then drones off into pure bliss. \\"God Machine\\" is basically like an anthem track. \\"The Mortician's Flame\\" keeps a steady beat and keeps you hooked. \\"What Color Is Death\\" is another song that represents the CD well. \\"The Bones of Baby Dolls\\" is yet another acoustic ballad as well, and the closer, \\"Cassie Eats Cockroaches\\", has one of the best groove riffs in there. Very diverse selection here.<br /><br />Now, to the band members:<br /><br />Dax Riggs is one of the most talented and underrated vocalists in the history of music. He was only about 16 when this CD was made! It carries a drone feel, but also has a wide range. After his work in Acid Bath, he carried on an alternative rock project called Agents in Oblivion, that only released one album. Now he plays in Deadboy and the Elephantmen, which is more of an indie outfit accompanied with Tessie Brunet.<br /><br />Sammy Duet is one great guitarist. He now plays for American blackened death metal act Goatwhore.<br /><br />Mike Sanchez also makes the guitar sound of Acid Bath complete as well. He also went off with Dax in the short lived Agents of Oblivion.<br /><br />Audie Pitre was the band's bassist, in which he showed off his undeniable talent. Unfortunately, in January 1997, he was killed in a head-on collision by a drinking truck driver. Thus, that was the death of Acid Bath, just after they released their final albu, \\"Paegan Terrorism Tactics\\".<br /><br />Jimmy Kyle is a great drummer. Not the best, but good at what he does.<br /><br />You need this CD. Whether you are into sludge or death metal, or even into nu-metal for all I care, you need this.

B000GGSM7G|2.0|An album that Robert Smith has pretty much disowned, \\"The Top\\" is a record that pretty much lives up to its reputation.  The Cure were in a state of disarray, Simon Gallup having defected left Smith and Lol Tolhurst to handle most of the instrument duties.  And while it starts off well enough, the album's second side is another story. <br /> <br />But again, it does start nicely-- opener \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" with its railing drums, fierce riffing and frantic, powerful vocal is one of the best, early, loud statements by the Cure.  And it continues positively-- the crisp, clean, dancey \\"Birdmad Girl\\" and the moody, MidEastern tinged \\"Wailing Wall\\" are both great cuts with very unique sounds.  But after that, it's just one unmemorable cut (Bauhausesque \\"Give Me It\\") to another (\\"Bananafishbones\\"), with a bad penchant for reedy synths (\\"Dressing Up\\") or on occasion, oddball reed performances that distract from the piece (the otherwise fantastic \\"The Empty World\\"). <br /> <br />Like the rest of the Cure reissues, this one comes remastered and with a second disc of unreleased material, mostly demos that, while interesting, aren't fantatic, with a few low fidelity live tracks tacked on the end.  Honestly, I can't figure out why the live tracks sound so bad-- I've heard better bootlegs from the era. <br /> <br />So it's a nice set, but truthfully \\"The Top\\" is an album everyone but the diehards can probably skip.
B00005O3VC|1.0|Without a doubt, \\"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\\" is the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was so dull; it literally put me to sleep. Even the ending was lame. I don't understand why they even bothered making such a stupid movie in the first place.<br /><br />I especially don't understand why so many people think this film is so fabulous. I mean, come on, guys, what's the overall point of the movie? What's the general theme?<br /><br />Anyway, if you've read this entire review, and if you still want to purchase this DVD, that's your own choice to make. But I'm staying as far away from this movie (and anything else related to Monty Python) as humanly possible.
B000005RS0|5.0|This album re-introduced a former R&B singer by the name of Tina Turner to the world at-large. She hasn't stopped turning the world on its ear since. It's interesting to hear how this album grew practically on its own, rather haphazardly, with none of the careful nurturing and selective songwriting most artists put into their albums. The album's biggest hit, \\"What's Love Got To Do With It\\", almost didn't get made. Tina hated it. One of her favorites, \\"I Might Have Been Queen\\", wasn't released as a single. This album shows tremendous range and depth of talent. From her roots in R&B, to the lighter realm of Pop, to the harder edge of Rock, Tina showed she could handle it all. She became the first woman to be nominated for Grammies in the fields of R&B, Pop, and Rock all in the same year. The album became a phenomenon, going multi-platinum in the U.S. alone, and a few times that worldwide. There really isn't a weak song here, except possibly the cover of \\"Help\\", which is much better live. The sterility of the studio really didn't help the song. The rest of the album, though, is amazing. Her rendition of \\"Private Dancer\\", the title track, is wonderful. The slow, measured reading of the lyrics, and the weariness in her voice blends to completely convince the idea of her being a tired private-dancer for hire, her dreams of happiness gone. It seems that nowadays, pop princess-tarts are a dime a dozen, talented, yes, but over-produced, and lacking true direction and focus, hence the immense early attention and enormous album sales, then burn-out sets in, and they fade. It's an inspiring thing, then, to see a woman, in her forties at the time, come back and show what a lifetime of experience and a world of talent can do. Get this album and enjoy it, because even though radio played some of it to death, it still stands the test of time amazingly well.

B000002LND|5.0|For anyone who thinks Madonna is nothing more than an a vapid image-maker, listen clsely to the tracks on this album. You come to realize that Madonna created many, many memorable songs during her now-more-than-20 year career. This album is only a sampler of her hits, because more than one disc would be needed for all her hits from her first 1983-1991 period. One can hear and feel her growth as a person and as an artist on this disc, from poppy dance music at first to deeper more introspective material later. Of course, her fans remember each track with the companion video firmly in their memory. Such was the power of video. People who never really paid attention to the videos will be surprised how well-done the songs are. This collection shows what a true cultural chameleon Madonna is, and how she has matured as an artist. This collection is a true must-have for music fans, not just Madonna fans, because Madonna is a true legend in the music industry, and she shows no signs of slowing down.

B000FS9FCQ|4.0|Let me preface my review by first saying that I am not familiar with the original graphic novel, so my review will be based on my reaction to the movie alone.<br /><br />What I am most impressed by is the commentary that is quite naturally found in this movie.  The theme is quite old, but wonderfully universal--the abuse of power by the powerful to entrap the common and weak.  Because of that, the movie makes not very veiled references to George Orwell (by not only using John Hurt, who starred in the movie 1984, but to dress him up as Big Brother from that movie and have him appear, through most of the movie, on a large TV screen) and even George Bush (with a second-in-command that smacks of Dick Cheney).  Though the references seems a little cliche at times, they are quite effective.  This is the greatest strength of sci-fi--to investigate present times and comment upon them in a form that doesn't seem like political commentary.  This was the purest strength of The Matrix--a movie, essentially, about the removal of humanity from an electronic world, and how to become human once again THROUGH that technology instead of DESPITE it.<br /><br />In this movie, we have an England that is run by a hard-edged morality that outlaws and bans what it doesn't like.  V, after a chance rescue of Evie (Natalie Portman), begins to induct her into his plan to free England, in much the same way as his idol Guy Fawkes attempted back in the 17th century.  But of course this time around, the stakes are higher, in that a mysterious biogenic weapon has created a lot of hysteria about terrorists and has given the government power to keep tabs on EVERYONE (sound familiar?).  Evie begins to investigate the truth of things, and everything unfolds from there.<br /><br />Some criticisms of this movie have decried the close connections of V to actual terrorists, but V clearly has a purpose to bring society together rather than tear it apart.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving, a brilliant actor (Mr. Smith) is stunning in this, though his face is rarely ever visible.  And the idea of plans within plans falls through a little bit, leaving some confusing movements towards the end, but the extent of the conspiracies presented here will keep necessary arguments going on for years.  The plotline of V as somewhat superhuman didn't quite seem to fit into this movie--it would seem that he would have been just as effective as someone who hadn't been 'enhanced,' but perhaps this was an element of the graphic novel that held more purpose there.<br /><br />In all, this was an excellent movie.  Exciting, action-packed and meaningful.  Great work.r. Smith) is stunning in this, though his face is rarely ever visible.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|IVE PLAYED THIS ALBUM 75 TIMES SINCE I BOUGHT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TIRED OF IT YET....I LUV THIS ALBUM.  HAVEN'T HAD AN ALBUM MAKE ME THIS GOOD IN ABOUT 8-10 YRS.  REAL SOUL MUSIC U CAN FEEL NOT MONEY MAKING HORMEGINIZED GARBAGE THAT PLAY ON THE RADIO THESE DAYS.  AND I COULD GO ON AND ON AND ON BUT WHO CARES??  GO GET IT NOW!!!
B0000640SA|3.0|The movie rocks.  It's thought provoking, ground-breaking and unconventional.  I give it 5 stars.    It's too bad that they took this same approach to the grossly misguided DVD menu design.  The menus play out like a psychiatric evaluation with multiple choice answers that have nothing to do with anything, especially when all you want to do is get to the movie and supplementary material.  Who wants to go through a frustrating process seemingly on an unending loop just to get to the movie and unlocking other DVD features?  I was not amused.  I hated this DVD treatment.
0060578793|5.0|My 7 year old son loves the idea of being a survival expert. Most of his \\"survival\\" involves spending the afternoon in the year eating sandwiches in his tent.  I purchased the \\"SAS Survival Handbook\\" as a something fun to read with him. <br /> <br />We both love the book! It's packed with info that is both handy to know and fun for kids to learn.
0805047905|5.0|This is the first book that my daughter and I read every night.  She points out the different animals when I read.  It is a great book that teaches colors and animals.  I recommend this book to every parent as first reading material with your child.
B000F8O35U|5.0|i still remember getting this video for my 3rd birthday. i watched it then and i watch it now that im 18. its one of the best classic disney movies. and although i have this movie on VHS i would still buy it on DVD.
B00097DX3U|2.0|I think Audioslave's first cd is one of the cd's I've listened to the most over the past few years. Pretty much every song is great on that cd. This cd though, sounds like they are trying too hard to come up with their own sound. It comes off as too polished and radio friendly, while their first cd was a bare knuckle hard rock masterpiece. Half of this cd is just not good at all. I hope their new album coming out sounds more like the first. I like their newest single \\"Original Fire\\" a loooot more than \\"Be yourself\\", which frankly, sounded like they were playing a song for sesame street.
B00007LTIB|5.0|harsh, aggressive, jazzy, experimental. all have been adjectives used to describe this final LP of the classic yes era. its brilliance is only outshined, perhaps, by that which came before it and it is to yes' credit that they did not attempt to retread a formula, but rather march boldly into uncharted waters. moraz' only record with yes and he made the most of it. very, very good album.
0060920432|5.0|I'm very glad I read this book. Though I had some idea before reading it that challenging yourself and achieving \\"flow\\" is important for your happiness, I just didn't really grasp how important it is in all aspects of your life. One can turn wasted time in optimal time, just by using a little creativity to make challenges for yourself. I would have never thought that someone could turn boring factory work into an optimal experience, for example. Often, happiness comes from within, not from without. That is perhaps the lesson that Westerners need to learn the most. We keep trying to find happiness with greater and greater riches, but it continues to elude us.  <br /> <br />However, I think that Mihaly C. overstates the importance of Flow a little. There are other components to happiness that have nothing to do with challenging yourself - love, friendship, relaxation time, comfort, etc. Just keep that in mind as you read this book.
B00009Z574|4.0|after all these years i still cannot get a handle on this thing. yes had changed and change can be a good thing, right? but don't kill the whales? why the hell not? all semantics aside, onward is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I love his first album and I love this one.  No, Josh cannot be compared to some of the finer classical singers (as \\"MaestroMichael\\" so scathingly said in his review) but that isn't why most people like his albums.   <br /> <br />There is a definite maturity from his first album, though I feel that he sounds a bit more strained in this one when he is hitting higher notes. <br /> <br />\\"Oceano\\" is my favorite song ever. I listen to it and never get tired of hearing it.  It is sung in Italian and is both upbeat and calming and seems to be always changing from one key to another. <br />\\"My Confession\\" is very pretty and is a great, more mellow followup to \\"Oceano.\\" <br />\\"Mi Mancherai\\" is hauntingly beautiful with Joshua Bell playing the violin in the background. <br />\\"When You Say You Love Me\\" is actually my third least favorite song on the album.  It sounds more pop and sickeningly sweet at times. <br />\\"Per Te\\" is another Italian song and would be perfectly suited in a dramatic acting piece, another haunting melody. <br />\\"All Improviso Amore\\" is yet another Italian piece that is nothing but energy from start to finish.  At first I found it to be annoying, but the more I listened, the more I liked it. <br />\\"Broken Vow\\" was first heard on the PBS special.  It is probably one of his most beautiful English songs.  A very sweet, simple song. <br />\\"Caruso\\" is the last Italian song on the album and is meant to be a tribute.  It is definitely an interesting tune as the Italian is sung so quickly. <br />\\"Remember When It Rained\\" was penned by Josh, the piano was played by him as well.  It is a very sad, but beautiful song with some beautiful piano solos by Josh. <br />\\"Hymne a l'Amour\\" is sung in French and brings that type of environment to mind.  Personally this is my least favorite song on the album, but some might like the peppy sound. <br />\\"You Raise Me Up\\" the first 50 times I heard this song I really enjoyed it.  In fact, it was the first song off the album thatI heard and it brought tears to my eyes.  Since then it has been overplayed and now does nothing but annoy me.  It has a beautiful Irish gospel type sound, but one can only listen to that so many times.  It holds as my second least favorite. <br />\\"Never Let Go\\" is a collaboration between Josh and Eric Mouquet of Deep Forest.  It is the most \\"alternative\\" track on the album and is a nice change, but I feel that it shouldn't have been placed last. <br /> <br />There is another version of this album with four more songs that I will cover here as well. <br /> <br />\\"Mi Morena\\" an English song with a Spanish title.  It is a mellow but beautiful song with Spanish influences in the music. <br />\\"She's Out of My Life\\" is a cover.  I didn't enjoy it so much the first few times around because I actually preferred the 98 Degrees acapella version, but this song grew on me.  The accompaniment is very subdued so the vocals are very clear. <br />\\"You're the Only Place\\" some of this song was played on the PBS special.  This is the full song.  A nice, pretty song.  Nothing overly special, but it's easy to listen to. <br />\\"My December\\" is the cover of the Linkin Park song of the same name.  It is similar, yet very different.  It is subdued and mellow, but rocks more than most of Josh's songs.  Very good effort. <br />
B00007KWHP|5.0|as but a young pup when yes released fragile, music still had the ability to shape your reality, the very way you saw things. with the addition of rick wakeman on keyboards and roger dean on artwork, yes created something totally unique, their own universe. there are a lot of great artists out there today, but no one has ever made a statement like fragile (sgt. pepper maybe!) later the same year yes would release close to the edge. how is that even possible?<br /><br />fragile still has a ring of innocence to it missing in later recordings. it's almost as if they, too, are in awe of that which is being created. a stunning, beautiful, perfect album.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|Now I know its hard to say one CD is better than another because all of AC/DC music is classic and will be until our generation and every generation after us forgets. But if your looking for a good \\"rock-out\\" all around fun AC/DC album to buy, this is your best bet. Always my favorite amongst my collection.
B00007KWHN|5.0|the yes album was the start of the greatest run any band ever had. hard to imagine upon listening to this masterpiece that they, or any band, could do better. with the addition of rick wakeman the following year they did just that on fragile. a must for any fan of seventies prog.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Highway to hell is my best heavy rock album.No day passes without me listening to this cd at least once.I listen to it either in my car or at home.each and every song is amazing with great vocals from Bon Scott and great Guitar solos from Angus young.It would really make me happy if you would buy this.this album is great,and is recommended.Please ignore Battery a.k.a Whirligig from Bakersfield California and buy this today.
B00009Z576|4.0|trevor horn saved yes, trevor rabin would later ruin it. the buggles were a cool unique band with a sound all their own (the first video ever played on MTV and all that), yet still he respected the aura, the mystery that was yes. the other guy thought he was yes. an enjoyable record that doesn't really pass the test of time. it sounds a little dated now. but all in all, a nice effort.
0930289234|5.0|It's a cliche nowadays to call something a realistic comic.  However back in the 80's this wasn't the case.  Not until the classics of that era anyway... (Dark Knight Returns, Watchmen, etc)  The writing is superb, the characters are very well written w/ human flaws and failings.  The artwork is extremely well paneled.  Dave Gibbons is one of the best when it comes to pacing the artwork of a comic book.  This is one of Alan Moore's finest works, and was meant to be his last statement on super hero's.  It stands up to the test of time, and is definitely worth your time and money.<br /><br />I had to add this little bit.  I first read this in 1989 or so.  Since then i re-read it every year or 2.  It's been quite awhile since i've re-read this comic, but i STILL think about it to this day.  There are very few comics or books that i can say that about.
B00007LTIA|5.0|this was my least favorite album yes released during their classic period. and then one day, out of the blue, i got it. and it hit me hard. it now ranks as my favorite yes album and that's saying something considering the competition. better than the yes album? better than fragile? close to the edge? relayer? yes, yes, yes and again yes. if you do not have hours and hours of free time on your hands you may never get it. this is the ultimate recording for those who enjoy music that works on multiple levels. to those who have nothing but contempt for this album, i truly understand. and i feel sorry for you. you are missing one of the seminal experiences a human can have. give it time. lots of time. trust me. it's worth it!
B000031XCR|5.0|Love this CD--in fact, this is the second one I've purchased--lost the first CD.
B00007LTIC|4.0|after a long lay-off, yes returned with this satisfying LP. gone was the roger dean cover. instead one gets a guy's naked butt. great. GFTO never approaches the magic of that which preceded it, but it doesn't suck either. a very treble-y, shriek-y mix. still quite listenable, though.
B000E1155E|5.0|I think in 20-30 years from now, we will still be listening to Arctic Monkeys... This is one of the best albums I've ever listened too, enjoy!
B000E41MS6|5.0|The first series of the new Doctor Who is presented in fine style in this box set.  The stories are good and there is a commentary on every episode!  Other special features include behind the scenes views, special effects planning, and the like, but those are mostly space filler:  good enough for what they are, but not really a selling point. <br /> <br />The reason to buy this is the stories, of course.  Christopher Eccleston manages to be both funny and dangerous as the new Who and Billie Piper updates the role of companion for a new era.  Not since \\"Star Trek\\" spawned \\"Next Generation\\" (and perhaps never) has a cancelled series returned in such fine form. <br /> <br />Well worth getting.
B0002W18MU|5.0|One of John's best.  When you've been a fan of one artist for as long as I have, you tend to like everything that artist does, even if it isn't as good as you think it could(should) be.  I felt that way about many things John did with Rick Rubin.  I've longed for the day I could hear John perform with his band (especially Bob Wooten) again.  I guess Rick never felt the same way.  Bob isn't here and hasn't been on any of the American recordings which is sad and unfortunate, however in this compliation of recordings Rick and John were at there best (at least at thier best considering John's health).  Great songs sung by an icon makes for great music ... simple as that!
B000GFLKF8|4.0|This fourth Spike Lee/Denzel Washington collaboration in many ways is the most conventional and the one that has the least to do with Spike's own voice -- he's operating off a thriller script he did not create -- but there are still signs that \\"Inside Man\\" is still a Spike Lee Joint.<br /><br />There's the signature shot of a protagonist moving down the street on a rolling cart instead of walking, an off-hand discussion of the damage done by videogames that glamorize the gangsta lifestyle and, as always, a lot of Spike's signature camera work and camera shots. For big Spike Lee fans, this might not be as much Spike as they want, but the film is still definitely worth watching.<br /><br />It's a smart thriller, not so much a \\"whodunnit\\" as a \\"what, exactly, did they do?\\" Clive Owen appears at the very beginning of the film, laying out what's happened in the film, with an implicit challenge to the viewers to figure out exactly what they're about to see. The bank robbery that follows is mysterious and more clever than it at first appears to be and the entire affair takes on extra realism thanks to an extremely good cast, including a number of lower-tier character actors putting in solid work, and especially Christopher Plummer and a surprisingly disquieting Jodie Foster, playing against type.<br /><br />The final resolution doesn't have quite the emotional pop that may have been intended, but it's an intellectually satisfying one.<br /><br />\\"Inside Man\\" could have used more of Spike Lee's signature style to spice things up, but it's still a very solid little caper movie and well worth seeing for fans of such films or Spike Lee Joints.
B00005JO1R|5.0|Where's the sequel?  I'm ready for the rest of the story.  Producers should call me, people say I sound just like John when I sing.  Also, I have a picture of John and I together and I must say with some make up and a hair style change I could resemble the man in black enough to be believable. <br />ANYWAY, the movie was great and the extra documenteries was worth the extra bucks and I cry too Marshal EVERYTIME I think of how much John and June meant to me too.  I miss them as much as if they were my own parents. <br />
B000A88EVE|5.0|This is a great fully restored copy of this film. If you are not familiar with it, well the title says it all as for plot. It is a wierd movie but one that is more enjoyable each time you watch. Great period piece. If it were anyone but Bowie, I might think it was the story of Bill Gates early days.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|To all the Floydians who have waited a very long time for this DVD to come out-it was worth it. Bootleg versions were a teaser to listen to, but in the end the final product is what really rocks. My VHS version was also fine, but the DVD format is incredible! From Yugo to Lambo!! 5.1 mixing is done with the listener in mind. The sound quality is so up there that even my teenage kids are asking if they can borrow and listen to it. Gilmour is a great musician and the band he assembled for this tour are truly amazing. Don't get me wrong, at 47 years old I still love the \\"old\\" Pink Floyd with Waters and Gilmour, but Gilmour has taken it to a new level (even if this DVD is dated). I had the chance to see them in Montreal-Canada when I lived there and that show still ranks as one of the most memorable concerts to date.Would have loved to seen this tour \\"live\\". The DVD is a pretty damn close listening experience though. Turn it up and enjoy..... <br />See you all on the Dark Side of The Moon.
B0002Z9HT8|1.0|Aside from the fact that one of the discs was cracked when I got this set (which Amazon promptly replaced with no hassle)this is a chronicle of an ambitious effort by rock and rollers who seemed to care and others who wanted to ride the coattails of those people. If you are looking for all the artists that played and all the songs from Live Aid this is NOT the set for you. In fact there's been some audio recreation on this set which I don't think is even mentioned in the collection. I felt gyped but you can read about it in Wikipedia's listing for Live Aid. Good performances by U2, Bowie and Queen as is expected but some of the other 80's acts are HORRID! I was at Live Aid and had no sentimentality for this package. The good thing is that this set promises to give some of the money to the Band Aid effort, though where that money will eventually end up is as mysterious as where Led Zeppelin's fottage wound up.
B000BYRCH4|4.0|This movie had a better story than I expected, the action was pretty good, and of course, Jessica....

B000G75AE8|4.0|i don't know about all this \\"return to form\\" hype.  i thought most of the post-lombardo albums were quite good, and full of interesting experiments.  i was less impressed with diabolus in musica, but divine intervention was a great album and god hates us all was as strong as anything else in their catalog.  as far as drummers go, i'd like to hear them with BOTH lombardo and bostaph!  but i suspect king, hanneman and araya are a little too musically conservative to try that.  anyway, this album is great for all the reasons everyone says it is and definitely one to own, but they never really slipped to a serious degree.  this is just part of a long progression.
1558908382|4.0|Bizarre mixture of hired assassin action film and romantic comedy is well done and pretty entertaining. John Cusack is likeable, as always, as the hired assassin who heads home to Grosse Pointe after a long absence under the ruse of attending a class reunion, though he has been hired to make a hit. Minnie Driver plays the girl he admired in high school and who has no idea what he has been doing ever since. Toss in an 80's soundtrack and you've got yourself a film that should appeal to pretty much every thirtysomething. While the assassination subplots bring a fresh ingredient to the genre and is an integral part of the story, the emphasis is on the romance and comedy. As such, the assassin subplot serves as a distraction by the film's close; however, the script is so engaging one might not notice. The violence isn't very graphic, though adult language keeps this from being suitable for kids. The DVD is okay, though nothing special.
B000G759LW|4.0|Here's each track broken down into listings and I've rated each song out of 5. 5 being the best and 0 being the absolute worst!    1.) \\"Intro (Back To Basics)\\"  2.5/5 - I loved the intro to \\"Stripped\\" a lot better. The tone changes in this quick intro. The first listen is great but it loses its novelty fast.    2.) \\"Make Me Wanna Pray\\" (Feat. Steve Winwood)  3.5/5 - The song opens up terrifically! The beat is amazing, however, can't say I love the lyrics too much.    3.) \\"Back In The Day\\"  2/5 - Can't say I care too much for this track. It's a medium beat and the chorus has more of an upbeat catch to it, but other than that I don't see anything great with it.    4.) \\"Ain't No Other Man\\"  5/5 - Who would of sunk it? My first listen to this song, I hated it. However, now I love it! After realizing Christina's style change, and hearing it a couple more times, this song has became top notch. Congrats!    5.) \\"Understand\\"  4/5 - I love the way this song begins (which is continued to be heard in the chorus), and Christina sounds beautiful after the quick intro and, of course, throughout this song. It's a very nice track.    6.) \\"Slow Down Baby\\"  3.5/5 - If you aren't used to this jazz, 20's, 30's, 40's style then this album will take some getting used to. Give the songs a chance, like this one, and by the end of it...things aren't that bad.    7.) \\"Oh Mother\\"  5/5 - Extremely emotional. Christina gives her soul, again (I love these types of songs)! It is like the material heard on \\"Stripped\\", but it continues to be a part of Christina's life (even though it's her past) so I'm happy that she continues to sing about it. Many people can relate to this kind of thing (abuse).    8.) \\"F.U.S.S.\\" (Interlude)  5/5 - Nice deep beat. I like the lyrics, they are catchy and I always love when Christina puts the people/men who have crossed her in their place!    9.) \\"On Our Way\\"  4/5 - Very nice beginning. With some of these songs it seems some major effort has went into the beginningand if you expect nothing out of each and every track...you'll really be able to enjoy the extreme majority and messages from this masterpiece.    10.) \\"Without You\\"   0/5 - Christina is very artistic, and she works with wonderfully talented  people...but this song does nothing for me! I think my rating speaks for me,  but I'll say it anyway. It's way too light and fluffy for this album. I feel like I'm  listening to \\"Happy Face\\" on the Survivor album from Destiny Child.    11.) \\"Still Dirrty\\"   3.75/5 - I try to go in with no expectations, but I did have some, obviously,  due to the title. I wanted to see if it sounded the same as the original or if  she'd re-create the chorus into this song or not. And she did none of that. It's  a completely new song, which turned out to be okay anyway. Very  provocative, but nothing like \\"Dirrty\\"!    12.) \\"Here To Stay\\"   2/5 - Again Christina is rectifying her style and actions. How many types of  these songs has she made now?    13.) \\"Thank You\\" (Dedication To Fans...)   3/5 - I had high expectations for this song too, and they fell. There a  collaborative of past singles and many, many fans speaking about Christina  and how much her music means to them. It's nice that she has a dedication  song to us fans, but it doesn't really seem like a song to me. Okay onto the  next disc.    1.) \\"Enter The Circus\\"  5/5 - Hey, am I at the circus? I see red and yellow tents! Elephants! YES I AM! I love this introduction! And although Christina doesn't give her vocals on this track after listening to the whole disc it feels like this is the opening act for a great upcoming concert of hers!    2.) \\"Welcome\\"  3/5 - Christina has just got on stage and basically repeated everything her announcer said (previous track). Then the chorus hits and it reminds me (only the lyrics) of a sappy country song! The track is decent.    3.) \\"Candyman\\"  5/5 - This song is going to do wonders for Christina's career. Not that she hasn't had great tracks releasedbefore, but if this becomes a single it'll definitely find it's way to the top of the charts. The lyrics and beat is way too catchy not to. Very provocative. Very \\"Dirrty\\" material!    4.) \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\"  5/5 - OMG!! Sexy, sultry, provocative. Way more `dirty' than \\"Dirrty\\" and \\"Candyman\\" ever could be! It reminds me (the jazzy/piano bar tone along with the lyrics) of Jessica Rabbit singing to the men at the bar in the movie \\"Rodger Rabbit\\", only this song would be way inappropriate for the movie. There is a nod to \\"Lady Marmalade\\" and she is extremely hot in this track!    5.) \\"I Got Trouble  5/5 - Very old (20's, 30's) style with jazzy tone and radio filtered sound. It sounds exactly like it would if I was listening to her on the radio or a record. It's a good sound and her voice is beautiful. Disc two is WAY better than one!    6.) \\"Hurt\\"  4.5/5 - It begins very soft and instantly on a high emotional level, brought to you by the power of a piano (so far it reminds me of \\"Walk Away\\" from stripped, which was my favorite song from that album). Very slow song. And as the title suggests, you do feel like you've been hurt when listening to this song. Her voice is a bit overpowering, however, at times. But just pretend you are at the opera.    7.) \\"Mercy On Me\\"  3.5/5 - Another terrific beginning! A choir singing the chorus. Then the piano comes in and soon enough Christina begins singing her heart out again. Definitely feels like the concert is ending soon, and maybe she's a bit worn out, or maybe it's the song. Who knows? Maybe this song should be on disc one and replaced on disc two by disc one's \\"Oh Mother\\".    8.) \\"Save Me From Myself\\"  4.5/5 - We all know she has beautiful voice, and the song begins out with just her, loud and clear, singing beautifully, of course, and a tad bit higher it seems. It's amazing. The song is nothing but her and a guitar. The song is great!    9.) \\"The Right Man\\"  5/5 - What a happy story. I'm glad that Christina is happy in herlife now. She definitely deserves it and she shares a lot of her happiness in this touching/loving song. The orchestra gives some emotional hype along with her voice, again. A great way to end a terrific disc!    On average the total of both discs got a 3.8! I feel that Disc One doesn't live up to as much hype as the promotion was giving off as the second disc does. Disc Two is far more enjoyable than disc one, however, do not get me wrong: disc one has some memorable tracks too, just not as many as the short second disc!
0767840135|5.0|After watching \\"Varekai,\\" \\"Dralion,\\" \\"Alegria,\\" \\"Journey of Man\\" and other DVDs, I can safely say this is my favorite Cirque du Soleil show. Anyone familiar with Cirque du Soleil's training camp show on TV's Bravo knows there is a similarity to most of their shows, so details and subtle differences are important when distinguishing among them. With \\"Quidam,\\" the music is perfect for the show, the performances are exceptional, the costumes are brilliant and the plot is the most delightful. I've seen this live once and liked it so much I might go back. I cannot find much about the DVD to criticize either because it is filmed very adroitly, the picture and sound quality are outstanding and it is presented in anamorphic widescreen. Suitable for all ages.
B000GFLKF8|3.0|This is one of the most successful boxoffice films for the formidable director Spike Lee.  Fortunately, he is blessed with performers like Denzel Washington, Jodie Foster, Clive Owen, Christopher Plummer and Willem Dafoe.  They are excellent in their roles in this unusual heist film which ultimately turns into a hostage situation for something more than money.<br /><br />Washington brings his cool reserve and winning sense of humor to his role as the hostage negotiator who has his own internal problems as well; Owen is quietly sinister in his role as the henchman of the robbery; Foster is superb in a strange role as a different kind of negotiator; Plummer is effective as the bank owner with his own dark secrets; and an unusually subdued Dafoe is stoic as a policeman working with Washington.<br /><br />Lee's direction is crisp and on target.  My main problem with the movie is the lack of giving Owen any history that explains how he knows Plummer's secret and just what he hopes to accomplish.  If that had been a little more clearer, this movie could have become a much better film.
1401301010|5.0|In SCAR TISSUE Anthony Kiedis, charismatic and highly articulate front man of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, recounts his remarkable life story, and the history of the band itself. Raised in the Midwest, he moved to LA aged eleven to live with his father Blackie, purveyor of pills, pot, and cocaine to the Hollywood elite. After a brief child-acting career, Kiedis dropped out of U.C.L.A. and plunged headfirst into the demimonde of the L.A. underground music scene. He formed the band with three school friends - and found his life's purpose. Crisscrossing the country, the Chili Peppers were musical innovators and influenced a whole generation of musicians. But there's a price to pay for both success and excess and in SCAR TISSUE, Kiedis writes candidly of the overdose death of his soul mate and band mate, Hillel Slovak, and his own ongoing struggle with an addiction to drugs. SCAR TISSUE far transcends the typical rock biography, because Anthony Kiedis is anything but a typical rock star. It is instead a compelling story of dedication and debauchery, of intrigue and integrity, of recklessness and redemption.<br /><br />I was surprised, not only at his storytelling skills, but also his history, it is the kind of life you hear from some rapper that constantly 'raps' about it. Kiedis never really portray's this harsh past in his music to a major extent.<br /><br />It really is a highly recommendable read.<br /><br />*I don't have problems with skilled rappers i.e. Tupac* Just wanted to point that out... But thats a review for another day...
B000069KGM|5.0|It is so easy to dismiss Chicago, especially what they became later. I honestly cannot stomach a lot of their later stuff, like \\"Baby What A Big Surprise\\" and especially \\"You're The Inspiration\\", and same goes for Peter Cetera's big solo hit, \\"Glory of Love\\" which I thought really stunk up the Karate Kid Part II movie. But before they blew all their credibility away with Peter Cetera-led cheesy pop ballads, they were by far and away the best known and most successful of the big brass rock bands. Blood, Sweat & Tears was obviously Chicago's early rival, but they didn't have much chart success past 1971. Chicago was a classic case of a good band selling out to cheesy commercial pop balladry, Genesis was another prime example, same goes for Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship/Starship. All obviously earned their greatest success and earned the most money (plus lots of MTV exposure) during their most commercial phase (the mid 1980s) but with a lot of their credibility sacrificed. <br /> <br />OK, back to 1969, the band, consisting of guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath, bassist/vocalist Peter Cetera, keyboardist/vocalist Robert Lamm, and drummer Danny Seraphine with three wind players, Walter Parazaider, Lee Loughnaine, and James Pankow was going by the name of The Chicago Transit Authority and released their debut in April of that year. The real Chicago Transit Authority (the city's public transit system) didn't quite like the band using that name so the band was shortly thereafter named just Chicago. I have often heard this album as being the first '70s album released in the '60s, and that's true, the music does sound more '70s than '60s. This band knew right away that they couldn't continue if they played \\"flowers and beads\\" type of pop psychedelia, which was already going out of fashion thanks to the Beatles going post-psychedelic (with The White Album and Abbey Road), not to mention prog rock and hard rock (like Led Zeppelin) was on the rise. <br /> <br />\\"Introduction\\" is the opening cut, with Terry Kath handling the vocals. It's plain to see he had a more bluesy voice than the other two vocalists in the band. Horns dominate this piece, and this piece goes through several changes. James Pankow also gives us some nice trombone solos too. The next two songs are the two biggest hits on the album, \\"Does Anyone Really Know What Time It Is?\\" and \\"Beginnings\\", which became staples of both AM and FM radio. Neither of these songs were immediate hits, and in fact neither were not hits until Chicago II and even Chicago III came out! Both of these songs were written by Robert Lamm. Lamm also wrote \\"Questions 67 & 68\\" but it was Peter Cetera singing this cut. This is a rather pop-oriented number. This is a great example as to why people referred to this album as the first '70s album of the '60s. Lamm's \\"Listen\\" is another fantastic, but short piece, with some rather dissonant horn arrangements. \\"Poem 58\\" starts off with a guitar solo, but then gets in to blues territory. Kath's \\"Free Form Guitar\\" is often regarded as the album's low-point, as it's basically just an experiment in distortion and feedback. Think of Jimi Hendrix performing \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\" without performing \\"The Star Spangled Banner\\", and that's what you get here. Obviously Kath's experimenting with distortion and feedback was inspired by Hendrix, as Hendrix was his big influence. \\"South California Purples\\" is another excellent example of the band doing a blues-influenced number. They do a rather creative version of the Spencer Davis Group's \\"I'm a Man\\", starting off with Cetera's bass playing, nice organ work from Lamm, plus an extended percussion solo the original did not have. The band pretty much had their own stamp on the cover of this song. \\"Prolog, August 28, 1968\\" is basically a recording of a demonstration at the Democratic National Convenion in Chicago, which is segued into an actual song, \\"Someday (August 28, 1968)\\", which you hear some of the demonstratorschant, \\"The whole world is watching\\" during the music. \\"Liberation\\" is largely Terry Kath's time to shine as he gives an extended guitar solo. <br /> <br />This is truly great stuff, and really beats the stuff they did in the 1980s hands down. If the thought of Chicago gets you running thanks to \\"You're The Inspiration\\", you should consider getting their earlier albums, and this debut is a great place to start.

B000FQJAIW|2.0|This isn't fair, Mr. Lucas! But then again, I guess \\"life ain't fair\\". Why is he releasing the 2004 digitally tweaked editions of the film again, with the unaltered 1977 version of the film? He's making a fool of himself! I've got an idea! I can buy all 2-disc sets, and just take the first disc out! One of the other guys that said something about remastering the original version without deliberately but obviously and inflexibly destroying the original film's reputation: <br /> <br /> * High-definition on the new Blu-ray discs <br /> * Still keep the original aspect ratio (2.35 : 1) <br /> * DTS 6.1, and the new 7.1 surround sound <br /> * The original theatrical and teaser trailers <br /> * The teaser poster for the film that read in a big font, \\"Coming To Your Galaxy This Summer\\" <br /> * The original 1977 documentary \\"The Making of Star Wars\\" <br /> * Talent files of all the main people that were in the credits <br /> <br />Still, Mr. Lucas, if you really want to hear OUR views, \\"GET RID OF THE 2004 VERSION WHICH ALL OF US OWN!\\"
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces is an amazing book. James Frey has a unigue gift of story telling. Reading this book an in the face look at the story of a drug addict, the thought process, the healing, and everything inbetween. Both this book and My Friend Leonard are proudly my favorite books still after the negative feedback that some of the truth had been twisted. Regardless of wether or not the book is entirely true, partly true or completely made up, the story is phenominal. It is a look inside addiction, self worth, and healing.
B00006RINF|5.0|I bought this CD in my favorite store, Hot Topic, although my caretakers told me not to, but I had to. I just can't put down the CD! I'm giving 5 stars cuz it's Lacuna Coil is much better than Black Eyed Peas (Cristina Scabbia is the dramatically Gothic version of Ferge; Andrea Ferro is a deliciously creepy yet rockin' version of Will.I.Am.) And plus, Cristina and Andrea never talk about drugs, money or sex like most rappers do (Kelis is a stupid cow). So, I'll gladly have Cristina and Andrea show those rappin' stupid cows what it's like to stop talking about sex, drugs or money!
B00027JZ3E|5.0|One of my All time favorite films. I can never grow tired of this movie. For todays audience not to gory, not to big on frights but anyone who loves vampire movies this is one of many. This one for the times. Thankfully the 80's.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|Unless you're from Mars, you already know this is a classic.  Just look at that line-up: Hepburn, Grant, Stewart and Cukor.  I just wanted to write a review so that I could recommend the 2-disc version, since it has a wonderful commentary track by Jeannine Basinger.  This is now the second DVD commentary that I have enjoyed by Ms. Basinger, the first being 'It' starring Clara Bow.  She obviously does her homework since she imparts information on practically every aspect of the film she is commenting on.  I do wish she would occasionally take a breath and enjoy some of the film, but this is a small complaint.

B0000CD5I6|5.0|This is great stuff.  Sprightly, catchy, jazzy.  Band having a jolly old time.  Very pleasurable.  A few tunes (\\"Greensleeved,\\" \\"God Rest Ye Merry\\") get airplay on the smooth jazz stations around Christmas.
B000FS9FCQ|2.0|Man! This movie does make a lot of big statements on current world politics. In fact, it is one big political statement! It uses current hot buzz words like \\"terrorism\\" and \\"national security.\\" It also makes references toward \\"America's Iraq War.\\" I can see how Conservatives hate it, while Liberals love it, much like they would Rush Limbaugh or Bill Maher. <br /> <br />As an action movie or drama, I thought it sucked. I had the impression that the writers' message was more important than the story itself. Movies like \\"American President\\" entertain first and make political statements second. Not this one!  <br /> <br />Artistic entertainment aside, if your Conservative, pass it up. It'll just hurt your feelings and tick you off. You're the bad guy in this movie (and I mean BAD).  <br /> <br />If you're liberal, watch it. It'll make you feel good, since it's a movie about how evil Conservatives are. It's also about another Revolution to overthrow them.  <br /> <br />I do suggest that if you do watch it, you should try to borrow a copy. No one should pay to watch a political advertisement or statement, whether it be from the right or left. Political ads should be shown for free!
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|The two leading actors in this movie make it work.  Stone and Baldwin are a winning combination.   The story line is interesting and thirilling.  This is a movie one can watch more than once.  The line this movie will be rememered at is \\"go get a life\\".    The love scenes are very well done and very sexy.  If you enjoy a good \\"whodunnit\\" you will enjoy this one.
B00005JP5J|5.0|Spoilers below: <br />This movie encapsulates the American obsession with success, and more noteably not being a loser.  The line in the title of my review is given by Olive, and it is just heart breaking when she delivers it.  So young but she is all too acquainted with winning and losing and the stigma attached to the latter.  It is her Grandpa's reply to Olive which is reassuring and touching.  The movie opens with Olive viewing the moment when a contestant for Miss America (or the equivalent) learns that she has been named Miss America.  Olive repeatedly replays the video clip.  That winning smile. <br />The other characters in the movie are:  <br />Richard, played by Greg Kinnear, is a wanna be motivational speaker; Dwayne, played by Paul Dana, is the son who wants to be the fighter pilot; and Frank, played by Steve Carell, is the Proust scholar who has his heart broken by a relationship with a student. <br />As each one of these character's dreams comes to naught, the family has to grow closer and closer together.  Olive's hug of her brother after his realization that he will never attain his dream, and he decides to join her on her quest, is quite touching. <br />And finally the metaphor of the yellow VW bus, the one that can not be driven with out the entire family pushing it, is perfect.  They all have to push to make the family go, together they are not losers, they are in fact trying to succeed, and that is what makes you a winner.  A great movie.
B000G75AE8|4.0|With Lombardo back in the band the music can now breathe.It sounds more organic.Paul bostaphs drumming was so mechanical and stiff that it smothered the sound.This is the best Slayer since Seasons and I like it just as much as that album.The Slayer vibe is much more apparent here than the last few releases.The standout tracks for me are Eyes of the insane and Jihad.These songs sound much different from the rest of the album because they were written by Araya and Hanneman.I think Christ Illusion would be even better if Kerry king didnt dominate the writing so much.The drumming is amazing and for me the highlight of the music.Nobody can pull off rolls and double bass like Lombardo.A track thats grown on me is Catatonic.A very slow and heavy song.This album was worth the wait and no doubt every Slayer fan is on a Christ Illusion binge right now.
B000EMGAOY|3.0|Stadium Arcadium frustrated me.  I really wanted to like it, despite the good case made by Flea, John Frusciante, and the underrated Chad Smith.  But, my ultimate opinion of Stadium Arcadium is due to Anthony Kiedis, the band's singer.  Don't get me wrong, Kiedis is great live and his vocal delivery is energetic and passionate.  But the songs don't mean anything.  The lyrics are a pastiche of nonsense, and the act wears quickly. Take \\"Charlie,\\" the third song on the first disc: \\"You could do at the hippodrome/slide back, trombone/ anybody got a tv tome?/ That's right, unknown.\\"  I have no idea what this means, and I don't think Kiedis really cares to know, either.  The RHCPs have a great album in them, but until they start focusing a bit more on their lyrics, their promise will always be just that.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I picked this movie up while on an extreme gore binge with a friend of mine. When we saw this, we figured \\"Awesome, that's supposed to be disgusting!\\" Although this is marketed as \\"The scariest movie of the decade\\", it is nothing of the sort. It is NEVER scary. Ever. Disgusting? Yeah, in a few parts I guess. But if the entire movie is riding on gore and violence, and there are only a few minutes of the saids content, then the movie has failed. Yeah, the achilles tendon scene was a definite flincher, but nothing else really got me. The eye was wicked fake looking. It was obviously a cheap prosthetic slapped over her eye.  <br /> <br />Another serious issue was the VERY slow buildup. At least an hour was spent showing as many breasts as they could fit on the reel. It was meant to lull the viewer into a false sense of security, but it was so long that the viewer was CONSTANTLY dragged into thinking about what the trailer promised. A 30 minute buildup, reasonable. 60? That's just bad editing. Sorry. <br /> <br />Another thing that really got me is that sometimes the main character wouldn't take the action the viewer really wanted him to. It would have been great if he went on a murderous rampage, killing his captors. He did take out four or five guards, but that was not enough.  <br /> <br />Overall, this movie was not even halfway as good as the trailer made it seem, and the fact that it was marketed as a horror movie is just pathetic.
B000G759LW|3.0|Ask anyone who knows me, and they will tell you that Mrs. Aguilera and I have had a love/hate relationship from the beginning. On the plus side, she's got that amazing voice that's crisp, soulful and bone-chilling. She's cutesy without being obnoxious, and her songs aren't, mostly, half-bad. The negative side, though, are things like: her nasty attitude, her fake accents, and her constant need to be better than Britney Spears. She's got the voice over Britney. But she continually tries to differ herself and she never really comes on top of her. But that's because Mrs. Spears is a different kind of artist than Christina. I think this album may just be the album where she gives up her competition.<br /><br />Upon first listen to Back To Basics, the common listener, the one's who aren't exactly CA fans, may feel a little confused. 'It's good music, but there's jazz horns and stuff while she's singing about being a slut?' It's a little silly but she makes it work for her. For the most part.<br /><br />As mentioned previously, the problem with Christina will never be her singing. While it may be her OVERsinging, it will never be her singing. The slight problem this album has is it's promotion. It's been promoted as this big swingback to the '20s, and besides the jazz horns and maybe a few bluesy vocals, there isn't much '20s in here. She's still singing the same way she'd sing in any other song, whether it was live-band or synthesized bass drum. She's still on her Dirrty kick (appropriately, Still Dirrty), Can't Hold Us Down female empowerment vibe (Here To Stay), and even a little I'm Okay thrown in for good measure (Oh Mother), but it's been done before. And while it may be even better this time around, fans won't be able to help but notice the similarities between these songs and her previous album's content.<br /><br />On a more positive side, Aguilera has her hands full with this album. She constantly provides fans (with the past two albums) with continuous hours of music with just two cds. And she constantly makes them feel important to her, this time dedicating a sweet, cutesy track (Thank You) which includes a few recorded messages from, assumingly, her true fans that may have got her cell phone number from the Paris Hilton sidekick leak (I know, I was there. Voicemail was full when I called ;). But maybe the biggest gift for fans and non-fans alike is the gritty Save Me From Myself, which she recorded with Linda Perry without ANY reverb or vocal make-up. It allows us to truly hear her singing from her SOUL, which is what this album is mainly about.<br /><br />So that's just a few things to think about with this album. A Surgeon General's Warning, if you will. Just remember that on this album, she isn't so much showing us what the cd may promise, but, nonetheless, it's pretty good music. Especially for the fans.urs of music with just two cds.

0812550706|3.0|When I first bought this book, I was under the assumption that it was similar to Starship Troopers.  I guess someone's review misled me...   <br />It's nothing like ST, other than the fact that they are fighting aliens that are like bugs (and even then, their attitudes are completely different).   <br /> <br />But, on the whole, the book is a solid read, with interesting characters with real development and personality.  The beginning of the book however, I felt was a bit too slow.  Other books like ST start off with a bang, and get things moving quickly so as not to put the reader off in the first 5 minutes of the book.  This problem was quickly relieved as the book progressed though, and you begin to identify and like (or hate) some of the characters presented. <br /> <br />Really, the emphasis of this book is mostly on the people, not the plot.  The plot can be summed up as a kid who plays laser tag in zero gravity with others because it simulates space combat with ships, which he does later on to fight aliens.  Who cares?  It's the characters and Ender's experiences with them where the real meat and potatoes can be found.   <br /> <br />Ender himself is likeable to a certain degree.  You want him to win, and you want him to be tough.  But he isn't tough all the time.  He is whiny sometimes, doesn't want to fight sometimes, and cries too much.  Where have I heard this before?  Oh right, Kira from Gundam Seed.  At least he's not as bad as Kira though.  Ender is much more likeable when he's confident with himself, and becomes a leader to be looked up to.  His experiences with bullies and harassment when he's younger, and his ability to overcome those obstacles makes you respect him more.  So Ender strikes a balance with being confident, and being a wimp, but I would have liked him a lot more if he wasn't crying and whining at those moments of weakness (although his reaction to what he did at the end of the book is understandable). <br /> <br />This book pulls off character development very well.  Sadly, that's only shining point of this book. Like I said, this book is mostly Opera as opposed to Space Opera.  There are no fantastic battles in outer space against a fearsome enemy (at least not directly).  The book barely even mentions the buggers.  Just a few mentions here and there in the middle, then again at the end of course.  Even ST had more battles, and more discussion of Sci-Fi elements, and technology.  Rico as a character was also a lot more likeable. <br /> <br />On the whole, this is a solid good book.  However, it has its faults, and I think it's overrated.  If you are looking for a good soap opera that happens to take place in space, then this is the book to get.  If you are looking for Sci-Fi Space Opera, then I'd pick up Starship Troopers instead.
B000HCO83Q|3.0|...but nonetheless, this movie falls short, waaaay short, of what I was expecting after X2. This contains spoilers.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- It's a lot more action and effects than the previous two films. While the first two were more of a story, this was more eye-candy. It's the fireworks display after a day of Independence. I gave this movie an extra star solely because of the Golden Gate bridge sequence.<br /><br />- We finally get to see the Phoenix and what she can do. A whole slew of new mutants are also introduced: Juggernaut, Multiple Man, Kitty Pryde, and others are here.<br /><br />- The core story is simple enought to follow. It's impossible to get lost halfway through the movie.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- I feel that the characters I've learned to appreciate are wasted. Rogue, Mystique, Professor-X, Cyclops,... They're pretty much gone a mere 15 or so minutes into the movie.<br /><br />- Although I liked the fairly simple story, it wouldn't have hurt to provide more characterization for the, well, characters. Angel, Colossus, and the others were just too one-dimensional.<br /><br />- The length. It's supposedly the last of the series and with a run-time of just under an hour and forty-five minutes, it didn't satisfy me. I feel robbed.<br /><br />- The dialogue is pretty awful in most parts. I mean, I know it's something to expect in these kinds of movies but the folks here didn't even seem like they were trying to stray away from that.<br /><br />It just feels like storyline/plot of this movie was rushed. I don't know whose fault it is, Ratner & Co. or Fox, but I think this movie would've been A LOT better (maybe even superior) to Singer's vision if it were split into two.<br /><br />The Last Stand is a condensed, crash-course version of the X-Men universe, and it doesn't work. Somewhere along the line, I hope another X-Men film will be made, albeit not follow this storyline because it's basically ruined.

0937381888|5.0|HOW TO BREW: EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW TO BREW BEER RIGHT THE FIRST TIME is more than another beer recipe book: it's a series of step-by-step processes perfect for the novice at brewing, explaining terminology, techniques, and even more intermediate processes. A 'crash course' in the basics leads to more extensive discussions of hop quality, fermentation processes, yeasts, and the later considerations of lagers and specialty brews. There are plenty of brewing books on the market, but this is the perfect place to begin, moving deftly from introduction to more advanced brewing.<br /><br />Diane C.

B000GTLQXU|3.0|Petersen and Co.'s remake boasts amazing special effects and stunt work but I think they forgot about the characters. There are some spoilers.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Kudos to the effects team. I've seen all the other special-effects driven movies this summer (X3, Superman Returns, Pirates 2) and this by far exceeds all three of them. The same goes for the stuntwork, which I've read are sometimes done by the main cast themselves.<br /><br />- Rather than being just the background of the disaster, the ship, due with the opening sequence and some other scenes, is given some character.<br /><br />- It didn't have a love story.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Like another certain movie released this summer (X3), I feel that the characters are wasted in all the fast-paced action. There wasn't much development at all...<br /><br />-...The stowaway girl had the most potential for this. After what happened to her, I didn't care much for the movie anymore.<br /><br />- Having a (retired??) firefighter along with the team just made it too easy for them. It would've been nice if they somehow had to learn escape/survival skills rather than just dragging along someone who already knew it.<br /><br />- I wish the rumors about Queen Latifah joining the cast were true. It would've made this a bit more interesting.<br /><br />This would've only gotten 1 star from me but the incredible effects and stuntwork saved it from being a total disaster (pun disturbingly intended). Petersen and Co. had chances to deepen the characters, but they didn't take those chances and as a result, this film sinks.
B000000OAH|5.0|All the Queen I heard before this album was only mildly interesting. A little too operatic for my then-heavy-metal tastes. But with Jazz I finally got it. Every song is a gem. The whole album flows and was also featured largely on their excellent \\"Live Killers\\". Maybe it's sentimentality on my part, but I NEVER was into any other Queen album as much as this one. If you ever had any doubt about Queen's ability to 'jam', just listen to \\"Dead On Time\\". Lots of nostalgia with this one. In my top ten of all time.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|Yeah, this is not the best movie ever made.  Fans of the game seem to be divided on it, either loving it or utterly hating it.   <br /> <br />The thing I like about this movie, though, is that it's a whole lot of fun.  Oh, and it's freaking hilarious.  No, seriously.  There are some genuinely laugh-out-loud moments in this movie.  The creature design is fantastic, as is the quality of the photography.   <br /> <br />If you're looking for a fun, unintentionally funny horror film, then this will be right up your alley.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain's chief appeal lies in the absolutely beautiful scenery and cinematography, and the love story between Ada, a preacher's daughter, and Inman, a Confederate soldier.  Filmed in the mountains of Romania, North and South Carolina, and Virgina, it is a relaxing pleasure to watch the seasons and the unspoiled beauty of nature.  It seems to have been the filmaker's goal to return to a pristine time before the environment became ravaged.<br /><br />Indeed, watching Cold Mountain is like stepping back in time, watching the horrors of the Civil War unfold in the South.  The acting of the stellar cast is impeccable.  The film is long, and moves slowly, but is a treat for romance lovers or history buffs.
B0000033J9|4.0|Love this CD. Very relaxing and the sound is very good.  Makes me want to see the movie again.
B000002UA0|5.0|The stuff with Syd Barrett is the only Pink Floyd that interests me.  After him it was a different band.  This is absolutely one of my all-time favorite albums.  Yes, it's very psychedelic, but I think it is totally unique and defies any attempt to categorize.  There simply isn't another album like it.<br /><br />Check this out, then seek out the other Syd-era Floyd on albums like \\"Relics\\", plus a couple of songs - \\"Scream thy Last Scream\\", \\"Vegetable Man\\" - never officially released, but which are great.  Then check out his solo albums. Unfortunately there simply isn't a lot of material out there.  Beware of endless attempts to repackage the same stuff over and over again.

1400079179|1.0|I'm a big fan of books and I bought this one to see what all the hype was about. This is not a book, it's a movie screen. I didn't have to think at all and all i saw in my imagination was one big movie reeling itself across my head. If I want to watch a movie I will put one in the TV, I don't want to watch a movie while I'm reading a book. Not only was it boring, but I figured the whole book out during the middle of it. I'm great at predicting movies, but I read books so I can get surprised. This wasn't much of a thriller if I knew what was happening before I turned the next page. An [...]year old could understand what is going on in this book, and when I was [...] I liked to read books that I could understand but I'm an adult and I like to read books that rise to my level of thinking and understanding. What's even worse about this book is that so many Christians are reading it and saying they don't know if they can believe anymore! What because of a FICTION novel! Yes Dan Brown says that some facts are true and it is slightly hard to distuingush between truth and fiction in that book, but if you did five minutes of decent research you would understand that most of what he says are conspiracy theories that don't hold a shred of truth in them. Have people forgotten how to think on their own anymore? If your faith is fading because of reading this book you might want to question whether or not you really had any at all. As for my faith, it was built upon a rock that many waves have crashed down upon and none have broken. While some people may think the fact that this is an anti-Christian book was the only factor in my disgust with this book, consider that one of my all time favorite authors is Stephen King and he is anything but Christian friendly. He simply writes very well put together horror stories that I enjoy. I was told that The Da Vinci Code is one of Dan Brown's worst books, I thought about reading some more of his books before I read this one. Guess I should have picked up another one first.have picked up another one first.
0440241588|2.0|This offering from John Grisham is about a high-powered Washington lobbyist who goes to jail after trying to sell some hacked software to control a spy satellite system. Six years later he is pardoned in a CIA gambit to see who will kill him and so learn more about the deal gone sour. The vast middle section of a book is a travelogue (as other reviewers have made clear) about the broker's life in hiding in the Italian city of Bologna and his attempts to learn the language and assimilate into the local culture. Most of the book, then, is more about Italy than about anything else. As the author freely admits in the afterward, he knows little about spying, satellites and such, but was more interested in describing Italian life and culture. <br /> <br />The story is set in an atmosphere of moral decay and corruption. As the broker meanders through Bologna and contemplates his past sins we get the impression that he is seeking redemption and rebirth. At the very end the book abruptly shifts into high gear and the broker is reborn though not necessarily redeemed. I was dissatisfied with the uneven pace and the overly simple ending. I have also read better travelogues.
B000G73U5Y|3.0|there so many Steely Dan compilations out here. now I have the Box set&all of there albums so there isn't anything new here to go get.but for the Newbie to SD's Music or just the Casual Fan this has some of there best stuff,but it is missing some cuts as well.  you will enjoy the trademark SD Musical Hybrid grooves,Production especially the Gary Katz era of Production& the Lyrical Wit&Sarcasm that makes Donald Fagen&Walter Becker so Creative.
B00004YKUY|5.0|I know, it sounds blasphemous, but \\"Arrival\\" has so many strong melodies and hooks on it, that it gives \\"Escape\\", \\"Frontiers\\", and even their \\"Greatest Hits\\" a run for the money.  <br /> <br />For reference: I'm a music fan who likes all sorts of classic and contemporary music. I own or have owned every Journey album with Steve Perry. I love & miss Steve Perry, too, just like many people here. But I've had this CD for over 2 years now, and it continues to impress me. I won't waste your time and tell you everything the band puts out is great. I agree with the reviewers who say \\"Trial By Fire\\" and \\"Generations\\" are both pretty bad in comparison to this. And I would take that a step further, because this album holds its own against anything the band has done in the past. <br /> <br />The musicanship flourishes here, and some of the songs are more quirky and heavy than I'd expected. It is like the band was set free or something. But what will win you over is that Arrival has so many memorable, strong melodies that stay with you, for years, apparently. Just which songs those are depends on your taste, but I am most impressed by \\"We Will Meet Again\\", \\"Higher Place\\", \\"Livin to Do\\" and \\"All the Things\\". These songs rank right up there with the greats like \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Girl Can't Help It\\".   <br /> <br />The Amazon reviewer hits upon something important when he compares Arrival to their Greatest Hits. It seems the majority of the songs on Arrival would be right at home on a \\"Greatest Hits\\" collection, and not in a random \\"they were lucky and in the zone\\" kind of way. I think it was very purposeful: each song on Arrival is very reminiscent in tempo, structure, feel, etc. to one of their big hits from the past. \\"Livin' To Do\\" has shades of \\"Lovin' Touchin' Squeezin'\\". \\"Higher Place\\" is the lovechild of \\"Be Good to Yourself\\" and \\"Seperate Ways\\". And don't get me wrong, these similarities---and the obvious care that the band has given Arrival---are a very good thing. I think they were crafting some kind of masterwork opus to help propel their new singer.  <br /> <br />And it works, at least for me. <br /> <br />So, if you are at all curious about what the band has been up to since the 80's, Arrival is the album to pick up.
B000GFLKF8|2.0|Denzel Washington is One of my all time Favorite Actors. Jodei Foster is one my all time Favorite Actresses,but they are both wasted on this overblown film. back in the day Spike Lee was happening,but it's been so long since he has made a film that has truly held my full attention. I dig the aingle where he is coming from with this picture,but something is missing in this film that keeps it from reaching it's peak. you get a Post 9/11 flavor with a few other past films of this style thrown in.  it should have been more tighter.

B000FBGBPC|4.0|This album surprised me. It really did. I liked the first album a little bit. There were a few tracks I really liked, but they soon bored me so I put the cd off to the side and really havn't listened to it since. Then this album comes along and really surprised me. This album is much more refined and intricate than the first one was. Some of the tracks will really rock you hard. Everything on this album is an improvement over the first album. This is a album I like to classify as a \\"riding\\" album. And by that I mean its a cd that sounds awesome in your car (if you have a good or decent system). You will probably be one of those people you see who are totally rocking out by themselves in their car, singing along and doing drumming motions on your steering wheel. Trust me on this. This cd is addictive, and full of great hooks on each track. The last album the rocked me this hard that I really got into was Audioslave's debut album.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Its all over\\" really sets the tone for whats to come on the album. I absolutly love the intro to this song. And when the vocals kick in, it sounds amazing. The next song \\"Pain\\" is another excellent song, that has a catchy hook you cant help but like. \\"Animal I Have Become\\" is the first single, and its actually quite good. I love the guitar work on this song, especially how it kicks in at the very begining. If you've heard this song on the radio and like it, you'll surely like the rest of the album. Track 4 is probably the weakest track imo. Just couldn't get into it. Track 5, \\"On My Own\\" is a great song, and is stronger than track 4 imo. Next comes along my favorite track, \\"Riot.\\"  This is by far the best song on the album. It has great hooks, incredible vocals, and great riffs to go along with it. I keep listening to this song over and over again. Its that good.<br /><br />Next comes \\"Get Out Alive\\", which I could easily see being the next single, it was one of the first songs on the album that drew  me in. Its slower than the first single Animal, but it has a strong chorus and it just has a very intriguing atmosphere to it. Very strong track, one of the albums best. Next is \\"Let it Die\\" & \\"Over and Over,\\" which are both slower tracks, but they both sound great, with great hooks on them. \\"Time of Dying\\" is next, and its more up-tempo that the previous tracks. Very good song. The last 3 tracks are great songs, but I do think the first half of the album is stronger than the 2nd, in my opinion. But there really isn't a bad track on the album.<br /><br />This is a great hard hitting, raw and powerful album. If your into hard rock, if you liked the first album or if you like, \\"Animal That I Have Become,\\" you will probably love this album, as it tops TDG debut by leaps and bounds.he first single Animal, but it has a strong chorus and it just has a very intriguing atmosphere to it.

B000G759LW|3.0|I'm a HUGE JAZZ FAN & I also happen to be a fan of Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" Album. So when I heard she was releasing a Jazz record I was EXTRA HYPED. I absolutely loved her duet \\"A Song For You\\" with Jazz Master Herbie Hancock on his album \\"Possibilities\\" and the first single \\"Ain't no other Man\\".<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed upon listening to the first couple of songs. THIS IS NOT A JAZZ ALBUM, not even close, it is more of a HIP-HOP/SOUL ALBUM. They're a couple of songs that have portions of Jazz influence like \\"Slow Down\\", \\"On Our Way\\", \\"Still Dirrty\\", \\"Candy Man\\", \\"I Got Trouble\\", \\"Mercy on Me\\", but nothing in this album reminds me of any Jazz or Blues legends from the 20's 30's, or 40's.<br /><br />I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS A BAD ALBUM; IT ACTAULLY IS GREAT IN ITS TRUE ELEMENT OF HIP-HOP/SOUL. They are even some songs that will finally bring Christina the artistic acknowledgement she should have received with \\"stripped\\". The one noticeable bad thing is that Christina seems to be recycling the same message from \\"Stripped\\": Feminism, Abuses, and being \\"Dirrty\\", but with a bit more love songs. I guess you can say this is \\"Stripped II\\" but softer (STRIPPED IS MORE EDGER).<br /><br />I'm greatly disappointed because I WAS EXPECTING AN AUTHENTIC JAZZ SOUND AND SHE DIDN'T DO THAT!!!! Christina had the opportunity to revise Jazz & bring it to the hip-hop generation. Sadly, that generation will continue to be soulless and never appreciate real music. I've barely listened to this album and maybe I'll be back in a couple of weeks or months praising its genius. BUT FOR ME, there's nothing new thats brought to the table with this project.....

B000EULJLU|5.0|These guys did it again. The albums just keep getting better. Tool is the most musically talented band since Pink Floyd. Just need to tour a little more.
B000G759LW|5.0|Christina Aguilera has come back! I thought 2002's \\"Stripped\\" would be impossible to top, but she managed to do it. \\"B2B\\" is an excellent concept album and really dives back into blues, jazz, and old soul sounds pop music originated from. EVERY song is amazing, however a few stand out more than others. Aguilera has definitely matured lyrically as well as vocally.  <br /> <br />Disc One: <br />Makes Me Wanna Pray - very catchy, old samples compliment song <br />Ain't No Other Man - duh <br />Slow Down Baby - has an excellent beat with some r&b hints <br />Oh Mother - I got chills the first time I heard this song, great <br />Still Dirrty - Great addition to \\"Dirrty\\" (in your face) <br />Here to Stay - reminds me of \\"Singing my Song\\" from Stripped <br /> <br />Disc Two: <br />Candyman - 2nd single, very dance-able :) <br />Nasty Naughty Boy - very naughty <br />I Got Trouble - sounds straght from the 30's, great vocals <br /> <br />The last 4 are more instrumental than any of the other songs, shows Aguilera's raw talent! <br /> <br />Hurt - slow ballad, her vocal range is excellent <br />Mercy on Me - like \\"Hurt\\", incredible vocals <br />Save Me From Myself- just Aguilera and accoustic guitar <br />The Right Man - Sad, but incredible music <br /> <br />Overall, this is my favorite album of 2006. Right above Pink's \\"Im Not Dead\\", B2B will surely be a best-seller for some time. BUY IT! <br />
076790382X|4.0|Bryson has been one of my favorite authors for years now - the first thing of his that I read was a magazine article comparing American weather extremes with those in his beloved England.  This collection of his writings on things American has me confused.  Most of it, as his wife points out, is griping about this and that.  Bryson has a tendency to talk down anything that doesn't fit into his view of how life ought to be and a maddening myopia when it comes to understanding why things are the way they are in this modern world.  Balancing that though is his self-deprecating humor and his beautiful writing skills.  There is a piece on global warming in this book that all ought to read.  So, basically, even though he is preachy, and a bit gripy, he is laugh-out-loud funny and writes so very well that I will keep reading him.
0156027321|3.0|I picked up \\"Life of Pi\\" based on the excellent reviews and several recommendations from friends. When that happens your expectations soar, and most of the times you are disappointed. That was my experience with LOP. Martel is a very good writer, but I was left wanting more <br />. <br />The first part of the book is fantastic and engrossing, we meet Pi and we walk with him thru his tribulations with religion and being a Hindu, Muslim and Christian at the same time. Also we learn about his life as a son of a zoo director. Unfortunately those two story lines are not developed further and we are left wanting more. <br /> <br />The second part is a tale of survival and endurance, again very well written. Narrated thru the eyes of a boy while on really extenuating circumstances. Lots of symbolisim and fantasy here.  <br /> <br />The third part tries to wrap up the story leaving it up to the reader to decide what's real and what's not. <br /> <br />Overall it was a good book; nor excellent. I just don't understand all the fascination about it. Also, a warning. It has very violent passages, I'm amazed that this is becoming required reading in some schools. I would not recommend it to a teenager or the faint of heart. <br />
0812975219|4.0|Taleb's book is a must-read for anyone who wants to glimpse the reality of life lurking beneath our perceptions of cause and effect. He is a derivatives trader who by his experience sees life through the perspective of a trader and has had his worldview shaped by his family's losses in the Lebanon Civil War, but his observations on the pervasive errors hard-wired into our brains by our need to assign a cause to every effect strike directly to the true reality of the circumstances and decisions we face every day. Unfortunately, he veers from his course from time to time and chooses to condemn a few well known people without knowing enough about their work to understand what they do and believe. His distain for the Nobel Prize and those who have won it may have distorted his judgment of the contributions of some who would wholeheartedly agree with his thesis, such as Harry Markowitz. Still, I highly recommend the book to anyone who has any desire to rise above the prejudice and superstition that often rule our decisions and avoid the expensive and sometimes dangerous blindness that keeps us from recognizing the role of randomness in our lives. I, for one, wish I had been able to discover his insights before the events and market behavior of 2000-2003. The lesson I take away from reading (and re-reading) this brilliant tome is that I am and always will be inordinately prejudiced with regard to the probabilities associated with any decision I will make and can only hope to overcome that prejudice by recognizing it and creating an objective test to discover its distortions.
B000000WCA|5.0|This brings me back to late elementary school when I heard half of these songs at family rollerskating nights. \\"Wannabe\\" was my favorite of the Spice Girls. The Spice Girls movie is pretty good as well. 1990's music with the Spice Girls. Gotta have it!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Usually, when someone goes from movies to music, it ends up being, to quote Seth from The OC, \\"self-indulgent actors with instruments\\".  Listen to the stuff Russell Crowe and Keanu Reeves have done, and you'll likely agree that they should stick to the big screen.  But, Jared Leto (and his brother Shannon) end up being a major exception. <br /> <br />This is a really cool band, sort of proggy indie rock, with great musicians, and a cool unique sound.  Jared has a pretty good voice, and Shannon is an awesome drummer. <br /> <br />So, if you're the type who has reservations about listening to actors playing in bands, definitely shed those here, because these guys are really good.  I started with this album, so I'll have to check out the first one too.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|its no surprise to me everyone is liking this CD, its a spiritual masterpeice with an underlying spiritual-awareness theme in every track. even the \\"necromancing\\" that is turning some people off from the music, is nothing more than an intricately-woven expose on the ego/false self/mind. Those not equipped with spiritual understanding, an the concepts it manifests, will likely not comprehend what im getting at. the song \\"crazy\\" that everyone likes so much, for instance, is actually making light of everyones (including gnarls') false sense of themself, and their self-fullfilling reality. when you identify \\"yourself\\" entirely with the physical and mental aspects of what you are, you deny what lies underneith, you are acting \\"crazy\\"... people who have come to this understanding know precisely what the song is talking about. searching the physical with the mental for a solution to the spiritual doesnt work. Once you realize you can fill your head with billions of bits of information, but it wont get you any closer to the truth, you start to understand what \\"it wasnt that i didnt know enough, i just knew too much\\" actually means. An if you think im reading wayyyy too much into this stuff, just listen to \\"the boogie monster\\" , the whole album is filled with this same message in a different format. Besides helping everyone who is unaware of what most of this album is about, i would just like to say to anyone thinking about purchasing or downloading it, that its completely worth it, even if you dont get it either, your soul will, an it will put you at ease all while exploring and exposing the paradoxical nature of the mind and creating beautiful new emotions in you. \\"who cares\\", \\"st elsewhere\\", and \\"smiley faces\\", among others, are just as good as the single \\"crazy\\". theres only like 1 or 2 songs that i didnt COMEPLETELY get into, but even them i like. i cant speak highly enough of it, especially for spiritual students, you will cherish it from top to bottom. (excuse my over-active ego!) ;-)
B000002UB3|5.0|I'm just putting in my two cents worth with regard to \\"Carebear's\\" enthusiastic review below (which I agree with wholeheartedly).  Unless C-bear knows something I don't, George is primarily known as the Beatles' great lead guitarist, not bassist.  Now, all four of the lads are capable of plucking a bass or keeping the beat on a drumkit or noodling on a piano, but as for saying that George Harrison is one of the greatest bassists in rock--that may be a true statement if one has insider info about his bass skills, but it's certainly as one of the greatest melodic chord and lead guitar players that he's best known.  I bought Abbey Road in 1970, along with Let It Be, so I've been familiar with this great piece of classic vinyl for quite a while.  Look, it's not just a rock thing: if Leonard Bernstein, Yehudi Menuhin, Henry Mancini, Tony Bennett, Bill Evans, and about a hundred zillion music fans the world over say these are four of the best composers and lyricists in the history of western music, never mind just popular song, there's probably something to it.  If you don't know the Beatles classic output, you don't know jack about 20th century music, and rock music at it's very best in particular.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|If you liked the music of the movie and wondered how come since you did not care much for orchestra performances yet, I think it is a great opportunity to give it a try. I think you will like this CD. Only one advice: listen the whole think from the beginning to the end, do not change the volume. The impact is guaranteed.    Personally I liked \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" (composed by Hans Zimmer) a little bit better comparing to \\"The Curse of The Black Pearl\\" (composed by Klaus Badelt).We can argue about this statement, but I am sure we all agree that we would love to hear these performances alive.    Anyhow, I encourage you to get \\"Dead Man's Chest\\" too, and the soundtrack of \\"The Last Samurai\\" (composed by Hans Zimmer).   Miklos

B000BW7QWW|3.0|I discovered the Firefly DVD set and enjoyed it so much that I watched all the episodes in about two days.  One great thing about the show was that most of the episodes were nicely self-contained, and they didn't have to tell the whole story in one show.  And they were always driven by a micro-plot instead of trying to squeeze the whole story in one segment. <br /> <br />The movie was a great way to tie the loose ends of the series together, but I think in the process it lost something.  I didn't find the dialogue half as witty as on the TV show.  The effort to answer the unanswered questions really became strained at times.  I think if I'd stumbled across this movie without having first watched the fantastic series, I would not have enjoyed it as much. <br /> <br />
B000AP04L0|5.0|I only worked in one office for a month and I can relate to a lot of things in this movie: the printer that barely worked at times, the overdemanding boss, the rules and regulations and that feeling that any kind of profit and you're not going to see a dime from it. Unlike certain comedy movies which are based primarily on being disgusting, rude or people getting smacked by things, Office Space gets its laughs by moments where you go \\"I know someone exactly like that\\". <br /> <br />Peter and 2 friends work at Initech, a computer company that prides itself on making workers do what they've been told to do. After a hypnotherapy session, Peter becomes carefree and uninhibited but he gets a promotion. How to get back at them? Put a virus in the computer system that takes the remainders of transactions and puts them in a separate account. Will they get caught? <br /> <br />One of the great things about this movie is that it seems to take itself seriously while having fun at the same time. While there's no big comedy punchlines, the film is quite funny at certain personas we've met such as that slooow tallllking guy...mmkay? Or bosses in restaurants making demands while saying it's up to you if you want to do it but I'm gonna whine if you don't. <br /> <br />Acting-wise the film's straight across the board. While I only know 3 cast members(obviously Jennifer Aniston and the others being Dave Herman, voice actor on Futurama and John C. McGinley), everyone's perfect in their roles and even spout some great one-liners too. My favorite: a neighbor, overhearing about Peter's plan gone awry, declines an offer to visit Peter saying \\"that's ok, don't want you to **** up my life too.\\" The only thing I didn't like is that the character you're going to love to hate never gets a comeuppance, like somebody losing it and punching him. Kind of disappointing. <br /> <br />How skimpy on the extras. This \\"Special Edition\\" practically has one making-of and deleted scenes and DVD-ROM stuff.No commentary? Grr, which is too bad cause I would've loved to hear from at least anybody but still this is a film that definately warrants a purchase.

B0006ZFQP8|5.0|Although Carlos Kleiber never produced recordings in the same bulk that Karajan and Solti did, his output was always amazing. This recording of Tristan proves the quality of his music-making as one of the prime exponents of Wagner conducting, and without a doubt, Carlos Kleiber brings out all the passion, eroticism, lyricism, tragedy, and beauty in Wagner's score. Like the old Wagnerian stalwarts such as Knappertsbusch and Clemens Krauss, he has an ability to make a seamless and endless string of music that seems almost incandescent...yet brimming with passion. Hearing this Tristan, I sometimes feel that the drama would sometimes threaten to leap out of the speakers and engulf me in the tragedy of Tristan. That said, I would think that this would be the work's best conducted version, and with the contribution of the Dresden Staatskapelle (Wagner's favourite orchestra), there is nothing that could surely remove this from the Wagnerian oeuvre of conducting.<br /><br />Regarding the cast, I would say that the most outstanding singers in this record are Kurt Moll and Margaret Price. Never having had sung Isolde on stage, Margaret Price gives this Isolde a lyricism, youthful quality, and beauty that you can never hear from other recordings. While I certainly find Dernesch, Modl, and Nilsson more compelling, she is one of the best Isolde's I have ever heard in the part. One could wish that she had sung it on stage. Kurt Moll is revelatory as King Mark. His monologue is superbly sung and acted. You can never go wrong with this artist, as everything he touches is definitive (he would probably be the Christa Ludwig of basses). Slightly below this standard of singers is the tenor Rene Kollo, who gives an amazingly youthful and heartfelt portrayal of Tristan. While I would take Vickers over him any day of the week, his Tristan offers siomething that others do not: youthful tone, ardent lyricism, and dramatic impact that singers like Suthaus never had. Fassbaender is an excellent Brangaene, although I would never take her over someone like Christa Ludwig.<br /><br />The one advantage of this set over its previous issue is the fact that DG fit each act into a disc.  So...none of those interruptions which are so deplorable in Wagner are heard in this CD.  I still like the older on though, with its beautiful libretto and very well done artwork.<br /><br />All in all, this set is an excellent when you sum up the components that make it so seductive and alluring. But you must never forget the EMI Karajan set, the 1966 DG B&ouml;hm set, the legendary 1952 Furtw&auml;ngler, or even that which Karajan conducted in Bayreuth in 1952.  Did I mention that Pappano's 2005 recording is excellent too?aene, although I would never take her over someone like Christa Ludwig.

B000G759LW|3.0|I'm a huge Christina fan... and I'm also a massive fan of the Greats (Ella, Etta, Nina, Nancy Wilson, etc)... I love cabaret music and I have a soft-spot for jazz.  I'm a crazy supporter of camp, as well.  So with all that said, this album should be my own piece of taylor-made heaven.  I bought it with such high expectations.  I ran home and popped it in and spent the following hour and a half completely underwhelmed.  Out of two discs worth of tracks, I could count the number of songs worth a second listen on one hand.  Blatant and (dare I say) lazy rip-offs of sounds made popular a few years back by Lou Bega (\\"Candyman\\") and Blu Cantrell (\\"Still Dirrty\\"), as well as a thinly-veiled attempt to copy \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\" (again... \\"Candyman\\") are interspersed with tracks that could have been yanked from the \\"Stripped\\" vaults and re-produced with some jazz samples thrown into the mix.   <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  There are some very fun and fabulous tracks here (most of the second disc is just what I was hoping for).  I think she was perhaps a bit too ambitious at the start, trying too hard to fill two discs.  There are enough gems and/or sturdy tracks to fill one fairly fabulous album, but the additional fluff-tracks fail to push the sonic envelope at all and result in sounding like... well, like fluff.  ...Take a few decent tracks from the first disc, add them to the second disc and relegate \\"Candyman\\" to the ranks of the b-side for the \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" single... then perhaps it would be a fantastic concept album. <br /> <br />I don't hate it by any means, but I'm certainly not overjoyed.  Sadly, I'll end up spending more time hitting the skip button than I will listening... At least I have a handful of great tracks and some campy pics to justify my purchase.

B000G759LW|5.0|I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS ALBUM HASN'T SOLD MORE ALBUMS.  IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM YOU ARE REALLY MISSING OUT ON AN EXTRAORDINARY AND UNPRECEDENTED ALBUM (Updated 1/11/07).  Another astounding assortment of soaring vocals and brilliant music from this beautiful and remarkably talented young lady.  This is a distinguished and spectacular performance by Christina.  She proves, once again, her unparalleled talent.  When her previous album \\"Stripped\\" was released in 2002 I was in awe.  In \\"Back to Basics\\" she raises the bar, yet again.  & PLEASE, TAKE IT FROM ME - A CREDIBLE MUSIC LOVER (whom owns 100's of cd's in various musical genres) - THIS ALBUM IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE EVER HEARD. I find it so hard to believe that anyone in their right mind and with any love for music would even attempt to criticize this masterpiece.  Every song is superb ranging from upbeat tempo's to emotional & heartfelt ballads, and a voice that soars to the heavens.  Please do not listen to those few that are obviously incapable of appreciating musical authenticity and God-given talent. This album is definitely an \\"Album of the Year\\" contender.  She is the only \\"pop\\" songstress that consistently distributes a phenomenal record that is both authentic and diversified in comparison to the same ole same ole routine music that is currently all over radio.  Christina always sets herself apart from her counterparts, and I applaud her for that.  Furthermore, she is the writer and Executive Producer of this masterful piece of work, and that in itself is a tremendous accomplishment and is another factor that distinguishes herself far from the rest.  The only other well-known legendary songstress that is also completely involved in writing/producing is Mariah.  It is so amazing to me how passionate, soulful, and powerful her voice is.  She is truly blessed to have been given such a talent and instrument.  This album certifies her as one of music/entertainment best artists/vocalist - right up there with Mariah, Aretha Franklin, Patti Labelle, Whitney......The girl has it all....she can sing her a_ _ off, dance, and her live performances never disappoint.  And beginning with her \\"Stripped\\" album she is also a talented writer and producer.  When she sings live she sounds just like the recording - that's how good she is.  It is so refreshing to have a modern day singer/songwriter that has real authenticity as Christina.  Thank goodness she was discovered.  & although I hate waiting 4 years between her albums, I do respect the fact that she takes her time & creates a finished product that is well worth the wait.  & boy oh boy is \\"Back to Basics\\" worth the wait.  First, I love the style and theme of this album.  She looks absolutely beautiful and has emerged into a true gem.  Her throwback to the jazz/blues, which is the foundation of the rock era, fused with modern day pop/subtle hip-hop/R&B is brilliant and unique.  Both discs are phenomenal, & although in the 2nd disc the first 2 tracks may throw some people off because they are more geared toward theatrics.....once track 3 \\"Candyman\\" kicks in you will experience a fun/uplifting, sexy, & emotional ride. Everything about this classic album is noteworthy.  And for the very few reviewers that give this album an average rating, my only assessment is that these folks have an inability to appreciate the diversity of music and do not truly understand its depth. The lyrical content throughout the CD is so grown-up, intellectual, and expressive.  In fact, \\"Oh Mother\\", \\"Hurt\\", & \\"The Right Man\\" actually made me tear up.  This girl has so much passion and soul when she sings - it's truly amazing.  I really hope this CD receives the recognition it deserves and wins AMA's & Grammy's.  To the reviewers who even attempt to still categorize her within the same category as Britney are so completely clueless.  In addition, yes there are only a FEW subtle so called \\"sexed up\\" songs (\\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\") but is no different than how it'sused in modern day pop/r&b.  Furthermore, Are you not aware that \\"sexual\\" content has been/and is employed in all music?  I would like to provide you with a little educational lesson on blues/jazz.  Back in the day, blues/jazz music always had very expressive \\"sexual\\" elements in it.  Take a listen to some old classics and you will see what I mean.  Christina is honoring and paying homage to the founding fathers/mothers of this musical genre and at the same time she doesn't abandon the modernized sound of today.  Please stop the ridiculous comparisons to Britney.  Face it, Christina is in a much more prestigious league and has raised the bar for herself.  She is held at a much higher standard than her so called counterparts.  This is a stellar effort and superb performance, and I have so much appreciation for CA that she has stepped out of the conventional and routine sounds of today and has uniquely fused blues/jazz with pop/r&b.  WOOOOOW, this CD is so amazing.  GO GET IT!  Although every track is outstanding, if I had to choose my favorites are:  Makes Me Wanna Pray  Ain't No Other Man  Understand  Slow Down Baby  Oh Mother - Brought tears to my eyes  F.U.S.S.  On Our Way  Without You  Still Dirty  Here to Stay  Candyman - very reminiscent of the classics....makes me think that I would have loved to hear a remake of \\"Boogy Woogy Bugle Boy\\".  Nasty Naughty Boy - Bluesy & sexy  Hurt - I cry when I listen to this - absolutely beautiful  Mercy on Me  Save Me From Myself  The Right Man - I also cry with this one.  It's a tear jerker, but in a beautiful way.  See.....I can't bring myself to choose a few.  They are all magnificent.  There are not enough descriptive words to describe this masterpiece.  THIS 2 DISC SET IS EXQUISITE MUSICAL PERFECTION.  YOU MUST GO GET IT.  EVERYONE FROM AGES 5 TO 100 YRS. OLD CAN ENJOY THIS CD.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This is an amazing album. If you are a Johnny Cash fan/a decent human being you will enjoy this. It's an album that you can't help but feel. There are a lot of death references and religious aspects which are slightly disappointing to an Atheist like me, but you can feel what he was feeling in his words. It's absolutely incredible. Although I am not a fan of religion, even the most religious sounding songs on the album are well worth listening. It also has several really great cover songs and overall should be just respected.

B00000BKDY|4.0|Somewhere In Time (1986.), Iron Maiden's sixth studio album<br /><br />In the first half of the 1980's, Iron Maiden's rise in popularity had been something of legend. From storming into the New Wave of British Heavy Metal scene with their self titled debut album, the band never looked back; even in the face of line up changes that plagued them in their early career. With what is regarded as the `classic' Maiden line up in place, with Bruce Dickenson (vocals), Nicko McBrain (drums) and Adrian Smith (guitar) joining long time members Steve Harris (bass) and Dave Murray (guitar) over the course of a couple of albums, the band went on to record `Piece Of Mind' and `Powerslave'. Both classic albums, the band again showed they were the masters of the dual-guitar heavy metal onslaught with more than a fair share of rip-roaring tunes. The question was, where should the band progress from here? Songs like `Rime Of The Ancient Mariner' had more than hinted at the band's progressive ideas and indeed this was the next territory for the group to delve into. Following a mammoth (and I mean MAMMOTH!) `Powerslave' tour which lasted nearly a year and encompassed nearly 200 concerts, the band went back to the studio to record `Somewhere In Time'. One of their more now underrated albums, it was released perhaps at the height of the band's popularity. So how does this more progressive epic from Iron Maiden fare?<br /><br />`Somewhere In Time' for me is an impressive development on the archetypal Maiden sound. The main change is in the form of introducing subtle synthesisers into some of the band's songs and also longer more progressive song structures overall (the album's shortest track is at 5 minutes). That said though, these changes don't weigh down the Iron Maiden sound in this album. The synthesisers aren't in your face (they are slightly more bloated on the follow-up `Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son' and the longer songs never settle into too repetitive riffs. Bruce Dickenson's vocals are an important factor in this as he carries the lyrics with a great deal of urgency which keeps the music flowing along. Sadly though, I feel the more progressive nature of this album is what makes it quite an underrated work by the band - certainly it gained a more mixed reaction from fans when in was released back in '86. For me, the guitar work on the album is of similar heaviness to previous albums and has just as much pace (songs like `Caught Somewhere In Time' fly like the wind!) Also, the album provides a good mix of more catchier numbers mixed in with the more progressive stuff to please the hardcore Maiden fans. Adrian Smith certainly shines most of all in the songwriting department on this album with fantastic songs in `Sea Of Madness', `Wasted Years' and `Stranger In A Strange Land', the latter two of which provided Iron Maiden with a couple of successful hit singles. The cover to the album is an awesome one too, have a look and see just how many references you see to previous songs by the band on it, in it's futuristic setting!<br /><br />Not too long ago, the Iron Maiden catalogue got totally remastered and improved. Hence the 1998 remasters are the way to go. The remaster job is great and all of the songs shine through with no sound glitches but also the recent version features and excellent accompanying booklet. The CD itself also has an enchanced multimedia section and you can view video footage of the 'Wasted Years' and 'Stranger In A Strange Land' songs from your PC.<br /><br />Title track `Caught Somewhere In Time' gets Maiden's sixth album underway. This opener is a classic epic, set up fantastically by an opening haunting riff. This song has a great brisk pace throughout which never looses momentum, helped along by some strong Dickenson vocals. Murray and Smith play out some great solos mid-way through also. The first hit single in `Wasted Years' is next up, the first of 3 great songs written by Adrian Smith on this album. Again the song has an infectious opening riff which develops it's way throughout and a proper sing along chorus which in true Maiden style. `Sea Of Madness' follows, with a much more mellow sound to it. Again, a strong chorus and also a catchy undistorted bridge with more great Dickenson vocals. `Heaven Can Wait' marks the finish to the first half of the album. This is perhaps my favourite song on here. The highlights are the bass intro with clever guitar interjections, the blistering lengthy solos and the somewhat cheesy but effective interlude. Again another song which never falls down in speed and doesn't lose interest.<br /><br />`The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner' is next, another Steve Harris epic based on the 1960's film of the same title. The intro to the song is surprisingly reminiscent to the tune to later song and Maiden fan favourite `Fear Of The Dark', still it sets a gentle, unassuming pace before the song breaks out into full attack with snarling Dickenson vocals in the verse and a thrashing chorus. `Stranger In A Strange Land' is a true classic and another top cut on this album. A formidable, plodding bass line opens up a particularly entrancing song with plenty of diverse guitar work and a surging chorus. The interlude is a great chilled out affair with some fantastic bass/guitar interactions. `Deja-Vu' follows; definitely the weakest track on here IMO. The riffs are surprisingly catchy though however the lyrics are pretty awful with a repetitive `Feels Like I've Been Here Before' repeated chorus. It's a bit of a `Maiden on autopilot' kind of song. Still, the album picks up again with the progressive epic in `Alexander The Great'. This follows on from where `Rime Of...' left off, this time obviously though with synths. Although not as timeless as `Rime...' it's still a great slice of adventurous metal that only Maiden could do well. The lyrics, although delivered brilliantly by Dickenson, do become somewhat of a boring history lesson in parts but never the less it's a captivating epic, full of twists and turns in the melody. There's more great solos (with clever bass fills) and the interlude has riffs with an ancient feel to them, which was not doubt what the band wanted to achieve with this epic.<br /><br />`Somewhere In Time' is another excellent album from Iron Maiden and is yet another successful chapter in their career during the `80's. It's a sadly underrated album that showed yet again that the band was capable of developing and producing a few more surprises. Although I wouldn't rank this alongside Maiden's 5* efforts like `Number Of The Beast' or `Powerslave', it's on the next level down, which is still fantastic and should be an integral part of any Iron Maiden fans collection. Not for a Maiden newbie, pick this one up once you've got into the band's more famous albums like `Number Of The Beast' or `Iron Maiden'. Highly recommended!!<br /><br />MY RATING: 8.5/10which develops it's way throughout and a proper sing along chorus which in true Maiden style. `Sea Of Madness' follows, with a much more mellow sound to it.

It's a sadly underrated album that showed yet again that the band was capable of developing and producing a few more surprises. Although I wouldn't rank this alongside Maiden's 5* efforts like `Number Of The Beast' or `Powerslave', it's on the next level down, which is still fantastic and should be an integral part of any Iron Maiden fans collection. Not for a Maiden newbie, pick this one up once you've got into the band's more famous albums like `Number Of The Beast' or `Iron Maiden'. Highly recommended!!<br /><br />MY RATING: 8.5/10ch develops it's way throughout and a proper sing along chorus which in true Maiden style. `Sea Of Madness' follows, with a much more mellow sound to it. Again, a strong chorus and also a catchy undistorted bridge with more great Dickenson vocals. `Heaven Can Wait' marks the finish to the first half of the album. This is perhaps my favourite song on here. The highlights are the bass intro with clever guitar interjections, the blistering lengthy solos and the somewhat cheesy but effective interlude. Again another song which never falls down in speed and doesn't lose interest.    `The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner' is next, another Steve Harris epic based on the 1960's film of the same title. The intro to the song is surprisingly reminiscent to the tune to later song and Maiden fan favourite `Fear Of The Dark', still it sets a gentle, unassuming pace before the song breaks out into full attack with snarling Dickenson vocals in the verse and a thrashing chorus. `Stranger In A Strange Land' is a true classic and another top cut on this album. A formidable, plodding bass line opens up a particularly entrancing song with plenty of diverse guitar work and a surging chorus. The interlude is a great chilled out affair with some fantastic bass/guitar interactions. `Deja-Vu' follows; definitely the weakest track on here IMO. The riffs are surprisingly catchy though however the lyrics are pretty awful with a repetitive `Feels Like I've Been Here Before' repeated chorus. It's a bit of a `Maiden on autopilot' kind of song. Still, the album picks up again with the progressive epic in `Alexander The Great'. This follows on from where `Rime Of...' left off, this time obviously though with synths. Although not as timeless as `Rime...' it's still a great slice of adventurous metal that only Maiden could do well. The lyrics, although delivered brilliantly by Dickenson, do become somewhat of a boring history lesson in parts but never the less it's a captivating epic, full of twists and turns in the melody. There's more great solos (with clever bass fills) and the interlude has riffs with an ancient feel to them, which was not doubt what the band wanted to achieve with this epic.    `Somewhere In Time' is another excellent album from Iron Maiden and is yet another successful chapter in their career during the `80's.

B000F4PD7G|5.0|I bought the DVD of Beowulf and Grendel recently and it is a wonderful film - each time I watch it I find something else to appreciate. <br />The poem in its original English is quite difficult to understand,even for college students,and can be pretty heavy going. i suggest you read the Rosemary Sutcliff book 'Beowulf:Dragonslayer' which tells the story simply in beautiful language and shares many details with this movie.It also fills in the background and follows up what happens to Beowulf in later life. <br />No doubt the animated film 'Beowulf' with its bigger budget and special effects which is due out next year, will stick to the simplistic 'good versus evil' mystical tale. Impressive but not as intersting as 'Beowulf and Grendel's attempt to show what could have been the original basis for the legend before it was adapted and sanitised by Christian monks. <br />I dont see anything wrong with introducing a female character,Selma,or a Christian missionary monk,Brendan,to the mix - it all adds to the story. <br />And the humour in the film is unexpected and welcome. <br />Thorkel,the Geat poet/narrator, is constantly exagerating his leader's exploits and Beowulf has to tell him to tone it down - he is a great warrior and fighter,yes,but still only a man. <br />Much has been said criticising the swearing in 'Beowulf and Grendel',but there really isnt all that much - nothing like 'Deadwood' or 'Sopranos' for instance.And as the director and writer explain in their commentary,when a group of guys get together their language is salty! Four letter swear words used nowadays are actually very old (Anglo Saxon) and are therefore not out of place in this film. The F word originally meant plowing and sowing seed, and the C word was simply the name for a particular part of the female anatomy. Selma uses it matter of factly when asking Beowulf if he wants her and when he doesnt respond she teasingly calls him a warrior monk. <br />The cast are excellent especially Stellan Skarsgard and Gerry Butler who is Beowulf personified,showing his feelings in his eyes and bodylanguage and with beautiful tangled locks of hair. <br />The Icelandic scenery is wonderful and has so many moods. <br />I wholeheartedly recommend this film. Watch it with an open mind and just enjoy the tale. <br />It's not meant to be a blockbuster with lots of special effects,nor is it a reenactment of the original manuscript. <br />It is its own unique take on the story and wonderfully acted and photographed. The music is good too.

This DVD is absolutely awesome, I had the VHS tape for years, but this is perfect. The special features are worth it just by themselves. I'll say no more about it, except that David Gilmour's solo at the end of Comfortably Numb is the reason they are legends in their own time.

Colin Campbell <br />The China Study <br />This gives very careful and statistical evidence for a lifestyle which may well protect against and/or remove some of the major health problems which are the cause of death in the US: cancer, coronary heart disease, and diabetes Type II. However, it also requires a change of paradigm for our thinking. We have been brought up and \\"convinced' of the necessity of meat for protein and milk for calcium for our bodies; vegetables and fruits and grains just \\"come along for the ride.\\" If your health is important to you, or you are moving toward a more plant-based food plan in your life, this is the book for you. If you are willing to listen to the \\"other side\\" of the arguments in the media for more protein and calcium, or you'd like to know how our RDA and other \\"statistical studies\\" come up with the eating plan which is the Basic American Diet (BAD), this will certainly interest you.  It is not a panacea for items Dr. Campbell is selling (he sells nothing), nor is it giving a \\"magic bullet\\" to cure your ills while allowing you to keep eating what you'd like.  This is a change in lifestyle.  <br />EXCELLENT! Well written, easy to understand and compelling evidence regarding our food choices and our health.
0060763280|5.0|I Loved this book... It changed my life and it will help you to identify your 'Money Blueprint'. This is the foundation of the book which basically states that we all have a 'pre-set' financial thermostat that will dictate how much money we earn (and keep). Once identified, there is no stopping you on your way to accumulating wealth. Harv teaches you how to think like the wealthy think (instead of thinking like the poor think) The concepts in this book may not be all that new, but Harv Eker puts his personal touch and personality into these basic principles of wealth. As a result, the book is very easy to read and understand. Harv gets right to the point and at times, is very blunt. I enjoyed his candid, honest and authoritative style of writing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is serious about changing their financial future.

I haven't fealt this way since I watched Shug in the Jupe Joint in the Color Purple. My favorite track is Candyman, but the whole album just blows you away. I really think this album is going to be a classic. I don't know how she will ever top this. Her voice on this album is STELLAR and so are the songs. Great job! This young woman really is an artist. I'm going to buy her previous albums.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|It was an overall good movie. It was very entertaining, and in my opinion a great heist thriller. Not good for kids with strict parents. F-bomb was dropped almost every other second.
B00005LK95|4.0|It would probably be much like this; two everyman protagonists, themes of loneliness and isolation and yearning, a robot who is far more humane than his human counterparts...<br /><br />Unlike the first Short Circuit Movie where there wasn't much time to explore the character of Jonhhy Five, or invest the machine with character, the second film does just that and it does it very well. The viewer's suspension of disbelief is fully engaged- even as an adult I find myself lulled into feeling a deep sesne of pathos and compassion for Number Johnny Five. This is in part due to an amazing pre-CGI special effects/machine team and also due to the exceptionally unselfconscious acting of the human cast: Fisher Stevens ((the bad guye from hackers)) is truly phenomenal as Ben Jharvi, an Indian ((I think)) computer programmer who is as inept at expressing his feelings as Johnny Five is as understanding his own); Michael McKean and Cynthia Gibb are also great (McKean is perfect as a petty conman who betrays and then saves Johnny Five). The actors did an amazing job interacting with the machine and their performances add subtly dazzling layers of humor and sentiment to whta could have been a really awful movie but instead becomes a marvelous thing to watch.<br /><br />OK. The script is somewhat shoddy at times and the pacing is not so well-handled. There are some dead-end scenes, but for the most part everything really hangs together well- Johnny Five stumbles through several mishaps trying to understand why humans behave as they do and why he feels what he feels. Oh, there's a chase scene set to the godawful \\"I need a hero,\\" song. The kitschy 80's pop score wears a tad thin afterawhile. But then, this is a kid film at heart, and a rather unique one at that.<br /><br />One scene always breaks my heart, one of my all-time favorite poignant scenes: Johnny five, after being caught by the cops, is taken and chained in the police basement- the stolen property room. He is slowly reading two books, page by page. His friends come to have him released- when allowed to leave he breaks his chains easily and sadly leaves (you see, he could have left at anytime had he wanted to; there's some Sadean undertones in how #J5 repeatedly allows himself to be demeaned and debased and almost destroyed by humans without fighting back lethally- which he easily could... a postmodern and mechanical kin to Justine, perhaps).<br /><br />The books he was so slowly reading were Pinochio and Frankenstein. It always slays me, just like the Rockbiter's monologue in  The Never Ending Story (\\"They look like big, strong hands...\\").<br /><br />This one is so much better, in my opinion, than Spielberg's execrable A.I., if only in that Stevie over-reached himself (again) on that crite film; trying to make a 'serious' film about 'serious' issues... and then he tacked on a completely odious ending.<br /><br />This film has no such pretensions- it mostly aims at fun.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|One of the best DVDs you can use to show off your surround sound setup and large flat screen TV. For me, the whole concert was a bit too staged and too sanitized. Only on the live version of \\"Money\\" does the band actually let loose, with fantastic results. That said, you get exactly what you'd expect from a Pink Floyd project: pristine video and incredible sound. Nothing wrong with that.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I remember watching Mary Poppins as a kid, and it brings back some fond memories of imagination and feel-good music.<br /><br />As I watch this show again, I can't help but think, \\"How come Disney, and Hollyood can't produce movies like this anymore?\\"<br /><br />You know, movies with morales (but not too \\"in your face\\"), action, but not the violent kind, and just overall good character-growth and acting?<br /><br />Everytime I see Julie Andrews now, I feel so sad, because of the loss of her ability to sing.  She has such a beautiful voice, which is on record for all time.  New aspiring singers should look to this classy singer, Julie Andrews to learn how to sing!<br /><br />And as someone else pointed out--Dick Van Dyke's amazing skills of dancing and acting as Bert and Senior Dawes STILL takes my breath away.  The \\"Step-in-Time\\" sequence and the dancing with the animated penguins....<br /><br />The magic involved is imaginative for its time. The power of human suggestion with Mary's singing is quite....what's the word? \\"supercalisticexpialidociuos\\".  Her ability to talk to animals, making animated objects move.  It's well before the time of fantasy or magic in books or theaters these days :)!<br /><br />Every kid in every generation should all be too lucky to see this. This is truly a treasure of a film, and a great family fun movie.
B000FQVY2C|5.0|I don't know what more I can add to the Paris 1919 discussion.  It's arguably the best work by arguably the most unfairly obscure popular music genius of his time.  If you don't already own it, stop reading and buy it!<br /><br />The reissue is what I'm really reviewing, and if I were to rate it on its own I would give it three stars.  It's a case of quantity over quality, with unfortunate results.<br /><br />First, the good.  The booklet has great new liner notes by a writer who thoroughly understands the album.  Burned Out Affair, despite a flat, possibly drunken vocal, is quite interesting.  Though I'm glad it was cut from the album proper, I'm equally glad to hear it.  Two alternate versions are fantastic: the Drone Mix of Hanky Panky Nohow and the hidden instrumental take of Macbeth (with masterful electric slide guitar) give new insights into the material and are great listening on their own.<br /><br />Second, the bad.  Pretty much all the other sketches are not particularly interesting at best.  The piano mix of Paris 1919, the vocal mix of Antarctica Starts Here, and the informal takes of Endless Plain of Fortune and Graham Green are all good listening, just nothing special or revealing.  Some, however, have mumbled partial vocals, muddy arrangements, lyric mistakes, and pitch problems.<br /><br />Sure, these things happen while recording.  This is probably the most honest set of rehearsals and takes I've ever seen on a commercial record -- there appear to be no overdubs or edits of any kind.  I'm not at all convinced that's a good thing, however.  It seems to me that including alternate versions of every song was overkill, and even undermines the album itself with material that obviously was never meant for public consumption.<br /><br />If they'd just stuck to new and revelatory versions, we'd have three or four great bonus tracks.  As it is, there's an entire alternate album that's not worth more than a couple listens.<br /><br />Certainly this reissue is worth buying, for the first time or even for the second.  Just don't expect anything much of the bonus tracks.or the second.  Just don't expect anything much of the bonus tracks.
B000EHRVP6|4.0|You'll rarely find a mainstream horror film that's gorier or more intense than Eli Roth's Hostel.  When Paxton (Jay Hernandez) and his two pot smoking pals go in search of sex and drugs, they get much, much more than they bargained for, as one by one they get captured and unbelievably and brutally tortured.  That's about as far as the story goes, but there's no need for Hostel to go any farther because Roth more than makes his point.  The film is more of a throwback to the exploitation films of the 70's, focusing less on story and character development and more on sickening gore effects and shocks.  And Roth is not afraid to let his camera linger and not cut away (the eye extraction scene will make you squirm like you won't believe).  Quentin Tarantino executive produced, and his hand can be felt in the final, revenge driven sequences.  Those who grew up with the aforementioned films will find plenty to admire with Hostel, but for those who have been weaned on teeniebopper, Scream-horror or PG-13 Japanese remakes, this should be avoided.  The DVD has a surprising amount of extras, particularly commentaries by Roth and Tarantino, which in itself is a real treat.
B000000XB9|5.0|By 1970, rock 'n roll in it's purest form was on the verge of joining the endangered species list. Granted, the term had become much more inclusive by then, referring to more or less the entire spectrum of pop music, epitomized by The Beatles in the UK and The Beach Boys in the US. The grittier, less refined elements which had defined the rock music of the 50s and 60s had become less prominent, but it was not ready to fade away just yet. It still had two very popular bands as proponents. In England, that band was The Rolling Stones. In America, it was Creedence Clearwater Revival.<br /><br />CCR was from the San Fransico area, but their sound was hardly indicative of this (nor were their haircuts or wardrobes). A few of their first singles - covers of \\"Susie Q\\" and \\"I Put A Spell On You\\" - contained a few psychedelic flourishes, and big hits like \\"Fortunate Son\\" and \\"Who'll Stop The Rain?\\" tapped into the protest mentality of the late 60s. But John Fogerty and company were not ones to wear flowers in their hair. Musically, Fogerty's vocals and guitar bore no trace of his California origins, and drew instead from the swamp, country, and rockabilly sounds of the American South and the heartland. Although this was hardly the formula for cool in the age of flower power, Creedence collected seventeen top 40 hits in a mere five years.<br /><br />Chronicle Vol. I contains all twenty of their top 100 chart entries, thirteen of which made the top ten, among which there is not a single #1 (CCR's seven biggest hits all reached #2). All of the classics that are familiar to anyone who has spent more than a day in America are there, as are less familiar classics such as the country-flavored \\"Lodi\\" and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door\\", the sweet pop tunes \\"Hey Tonight\\" and \\"Sweet Hithchiker\\", the inspired rock of \\"Commotion\\" and \\"Run Through the Jungle\\", and the plaintive closer \\"Someday Never Comes\\". Also featured are the band's versions of \\"Susie Q\\" and \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\". The former is certainly worthy of inclusion, but fans wanting a concise and complete collection would have been better served if \\"Born On the Bayou\\" were in the place of \\"I Heard It Through the Grapevine\\". Granted, the latter was released as a single to coincide with the 1976 pressing of Chronicle, after the band broke up, but two things: 1)This song is not most famously associated with Creedence, and 2)This version is 11 minutes long. Sure, \\"Born On the Bayou\\" was not a chart single, but it is one of their best and most enduring tunes, as well as the one that first defined CCR's unique sound. But it is a rule of compilations that they  fall just short of being perfect. Thankfully, this unfortunate omission is included on Chronicle Vol. II, which is a fine collection itself, and further evidence that Fogerty was a well-oiled songwriting machine who was rarely low on steam.<br /><br />Strangely, the legacy of Creedence Clearwater Revival has not been quite as durable as that of The Byrds or The Beach Boys. They surely influenced a number of subsequent bands, but their name is not dropped as often, and they are not very closely associated with a particular style of modern music, like The Byrds are with jangle pop. They probably got a bit of a boost when they were touted as The Dude's favorite band in the 1998 movie \\"The Big Lebowski\\", but other than that, Creedence's cred is minimal.

Wasn't too crazy about that particular recording or one of the hits from it, \\"Can I Play With Madness?\\"  I'm not putting it down, it just wasn't my cup of tea.

Fantastic songs, but I wasn't too crazy about \\"Sea Of Madness\\" and \\"The Loneliness Of the Long Distance Runner.\\"<br /><br />\\"Iron Maiden\\" really carved a niche for themselves in metal history with their unique brand.

B000BW7QWW|4.0|I'm hesitant to criticize this film at all since there is so little worthwhile science fiction being produced these days.<br /><br />This is an interesting film. The FX are impressive. The cinematography is good, the direction is good. I was annoyed by the repeated cut scenes meant to represent River's shattered mental state, suddenly a horrible \\"Reiver\\" face pops on the screen... BOO! It's a cheap trick, that's not storytelling.<br /><br />In the first ten minutes I found five or six instances that seemed to be \\"quotes\\" from other science fiction movies. I couldn't decide if that was meant as tribute or imitation.<br /><br />I wish I'd seen the television series. This movie impressed me. It's ambitious, and that much alone makes it worth recommending. The story overall doesn't exactly remain taut, but it's difficult to fault the movie for that, given what it does achieve. It's a really good effort. You care about the characters. The captain of the Serenity is very, very good in his role. The girl that plays River has a creepy sexuality about her that's disturbing... kind of an Angelina Jolie f-me-and-I'll-kill-you vibe.<br /><br />Overall: BUY IT NOW WHILE IT'S STILL AVAILABLE. It may not be perfect, but it's one of the few good science fiction movies produced in the past twenty-five years. It's a gasp of air after the claustrophobic/stale Star Wars-Star Trek franchises have suffocated anything imaginative for the past three or four decades.<br /><br />I wish amazon.com had a four-and-a-half-star rating... it's a very good SF movie.
B000000W94|3.0|Kind of ironic that Irishman Moore does a tribute to Englishman Green who was an interpreter of American blues music. Maybe you should just cut out the middlemen and go right to the real deal, namely, Otis Rush, BB, Albert, and so on.  <br /> <br />That being said, I have long been a huge admirer of Peter Green, starting back in the 60's. His talent was stupifying. I still think he was the greatest combination (guitar playing AND singing) white blues player ever. Fabulous, tender, heartfelt, subtle and magnificently understated guitar playing and a truly great voice. He played \\"for keeps.\\" What a shame it was that he became so disenchanted with the music scene and dropped out for so long.  <br /> <br />I have heard a bit of his present-day stuff and unfortunately, he seems to be merely a shadow of his former self. Alas, we all get older and lose our chops, to some degree (except for BB, who seems to keep getting better and better all the time!). But it is nice that Pete is back on the scene. If he came to town I'd go see him, that's for sure. A true blues immortal.  <br /> <br />Though it's kind of cool to have a lot of [Green's] good Mac-era tunes on one recording, the biggest problem with it is that it's not Peter Green playing, but Gary Moore! Gary is great, don't get me wrong, but you come away thinking Gary, as fine a player as he is, is trying to sound like Pete but not truly succeeding, especially in the voice department. Peter's voice was full and quite mellow, and he could both growl and purr, with equal success. Compare his \\"Stop Messin' Round\\" with Gary's. The guitars are quite similar, but that's it. Same thing with pretty much everything on the record. Pete's versions just have more balls, more swing, five-star category throughout.  Listen to the \\"originals\\". I'd highly recommend the two-disc Jumpin'At Shadows: the Blues Years by the early Mac.  <br /> <br />And I still like Gary Moore.

0316172324|2.0|This book uses a lot of words to say very little. Basically, snap judgements and gut reactions are the result of very quick processing of information by our subconscious mind, and if we try to think hard about why we feel the way we do, we'll come up empty because that information isn't accessible by our conscious minds. So we should trust our intuition...except that we shouldn't, because our gut reaction can also reveal our inner racist and cause us to elect people like Warren Harding. So we shouldn't trust it...except that many major decisions can and should be made using a very small amount of information, because too much will hinder your decision-making process...but you can't know which information is critical without a lengthy and detailed study of all possible factors. So...trust your gut only if you're highly trained and not under very much stress. I guess. I was tempted to put down this book several times, but the writing style is actually quite engaging, and I had faith that the author would somehow tie up all his suppositions into some kind of generalized theory. He doesn't. He shares a lot of marginally interesting anecdotes, but I was definitely unimpressed. So if you enjoy arbitrary and often conflicting psychological conclusions supported by loads and loads of case studies from a large variety of fields (from New Coke to marriages to police brutality), you will like this book. If you're looking for a cohesive explanation or even a concrete argument one way or another, you will be left wanting.
B000GIWS7E|5.0|Let me tell you that I've never seen or heard DT ever like this. <br />I took my cousin to see this show, and he absolutely loved it. <br />This was his first DT show- what a great way to see them. I could'nt believe my eyes and ears, DT just gets better and better each and every time I see them. The arrangements were just great. I would've like to have heard some different songs, but that's the way DT wanted it. DT rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1592402038|5.0|What a charming little book! With genuine affection for the subject matter and a large helping of wit, Truss methodically runs down the rules for apostrophes, periods, commas, exclamation points, question marks, dashes, quotation marks, hyphens, and brackets. If the very word \\"punctuation\\" causes you to yawn despairingly, this book is probably not for you. However, if you have even a passing interest in communicating more effectively, I heartily recommend picking up a copy. Contrary to popular belief, the purpose of punctuation is not to drive you bats, but to clarify the written word. It's quite useful, really, as is demonstrated so well in this book. I learned a lot without ever feeling lectured to, and even laughed quite a bit.
B00005JOQS|2.0|The special effects were awesome but the story was weak. Let me get this straight, Lex Luthor - the evil genius who is the world's smartest villain - has a plan to create uninhabitable real estate?? First off Superman 1 was based on a Real Estate plot. Secondly, who would buy land made of useless crystals??!!!!  Then the secondary storyline with Lois and the boy was boring. How could this kid be so lame and nerdy? This is SUPERMAN - they could have written a unique story and made a fantastic movie. Instead this story was lacking in all aspects. Cool special effects and \\"epic\\" cinematography in some scenes, but overall it was disappointing
B000056HE9|5.0|This is my favorite movie along with \\"Autie Mame\\"...they are wonderfully made and make you feel wonderful...like sitting near a cracking fire place...I would reccomend both....
B00005JKCH|4.0|This movie is really really good. It reminds me of why I loved comics as a kid. The script stays very close to the original Spider-Man comic. Its cool to see Peter Parker stumble into his super powers and learn how to use them. The performances are amazing. I dont think Willem Dafoe has ever had a bad performance but he absolutely shines as the menacing Osborne / Goblin. Especially the scene where he confonts himself in the mirror -- cool! Tobey Macguire is perfect as Peter Parker. The original comic portrayed Parker as a nerd who becomed this hero, and Tobey plays the part perfectly. Kirstin Dunst plays MJ to a tee. She is the perfect girl next door. Very sweet and incredibly sexual at the same time. The CGI looks kinda wacky at times but because of the lighting / cinematography Sam Raimi allows us to fall into this world seemlessly. Other movies that rely heavily on CGI end up looking stupid - but in this movie it fits because Spider-Man does move with that agility and speed in the comics. The movie is 2 hours long but flows easily and you are never looking at your watch. Go see this movie. I can only hope that the inevitable sequels do not tarnish this fantastic film.
B0002KVULG|5.0|I remember I watched this movie when I was about 10 years old, and it scared the crap out of me. Mainly because of the two female vampires, Lucy and Mina. Mina has to be the most frightening vampire I have ever seen on film.  <br />   <br />The excellent music by John Williams, gives this movie an extra dimension to it. Frank Langella, last seen as the editor in chief of the Daily Planet in \\"Superman Returns\\", gives a strong performance as the lovesick and bloodthirsty count Dracula. The late Donald Pleaseance and Laurence Olivier, plays Dr. Seward and Dr. Van Helsing, Draculas greatest enemies.  <br /> <br />To sum it up: Great actors, scary vampires, rich gothic atmosphere and a great musical score by John Williams, makes this production from 1979, one of the best Dracula movies ever.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|One of my favorite movies reshown in blu-ray!  Short of the futuristic scenes with the robots and the HKs, everything looks really good on 1080p.  I don't think there is anything they can do to make rear screen projection backgrounds look any better on HD (I'm sure they never considered it a problem in 1991).   <br /> <br />The colors from the explosions, night scenes and steel mill look really good.  Big improvement over the old one.  The scenes where Arnold is shooting at the cops with the mini-gun, then grenade launcher, then the subsequent blowing up of the computer lab are wonderful in high-def with the sound cranked all the way up!  Just never gets old! <br /> <br />I liked the 2003 commentary track with James Cameron the most.  You know this movie is cool when you watch it, you just don't know exactly why until you here this guy talk through some of the scenes.  Rare opportunity to hear one of the greatest film makers ever talk through the whole thing.  The attention to detail is incredible.  This thing is more than 13 years old and still holds up against most of the modern sci-fi/action movies of today.  Highly recommended.

B000FGGE7C|4.0|Well worth the money.  One of those movies you can watch over and over.  The action only pauses a few times and then picks back up. <br /> <br />Blu-ray is awesome!  Well worth the extra cash.  Graphics are extremely tight.  Finally caught up with my PC.  The uncompressed sound is well worth mentioning too and it sounded great (my neighbors hate me!).  Nice, loud and extremely responsive. <br /> <br />I've never seen a movie that used color and music so effectively.  You could \\"feel\\" when things changed and when it was about to hit the fan.  <br /> <br />Some of the scenes in the movie were implausible (very comic book like which makes some sense) though they were cool enough on their own that I'm glad they did it that way (most notibly the last 2 scenes in the Needle).  They could have tightened up the graphics on the motor cycle and transfer truck driving scenes.  Kinda like the \\"Smith\\" fight in Matrix 2. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, think of a movie about a better looking, much more colorful Trinity from the Matrix mixed with Blade. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B000FS9FCG|3.0|What we have here is some sort of fascist England whose main issue seems a dislike of gay people. We also have a freedom fighter who plans to blow up the British parliment building in public view in the name of freedom. To me the story made little sense. <br /> <br />The acting was reasonable. Nothing memorable. <br /> <br />From the directors of the matrix, I thought the special effects were rather ordinary. I suppose I expected more from them.
0780622553|5.0|This is one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever produced in my opinion. If I had to list my top ten favorite Sci-Fi's ever, this would be on the list. The film starts off in a very bleak and menacing tone: The people of 'Dark City' have no past, and no future. It is a place where all connection to the human race have been severed, and they are the unwitting experiments of an alien race that wishes to study mankind for its own ulterior motives. Enter John Murdoch (Rufus Sewell) who awakens naked in a bathtub. He does not know why he is there, or anything of his past. Suddenly, there is a ring from a telephone. The caller on the other end, Dr. Schreber (Keifer Sutherland) informs Murdoch that he is in danger and must leave the hotel room. And thus begins a dark and eerie film.<br /><br />My only regret is that I never had the opportunity to watch this excellent film on the big screen. I saw it in early 1999 on the cable station. Nonetheless, I loved it when I viewed it. This masterpiece of science fiction is about as dark as they come. And the reality of those who inhabit 'Dark City' is not the reality they know, but one forced upon them by an alien race bent on finding out why humans tick. What gives mankind his meaning and hope for the future? And in the process, the aliens have invented a city which is as much of the film, if not more, than the actors themselves. However, the city's alterations at the hands of the aliens is a necessary tool they use in order for them to learn and understand the humans, if they are to get the answers they are seeking to their questions.<br /><br />Therefore, contrary to many reviewers and critics criticism's of the film, the LIVING CITY is necessary in order to advance the story. Just as the humans who inhabit the city are manipulated and used, so is the city itself. The visuals in the film are some of the most stunning I have ever viewed. One of the things I liked about \\"Dark City\\" [and there are many] is that the viewer knows nothing about the individuals who inhabit the city. Yes, we know they are humans who have been abducted for this strange experiment of the aliens, but we know nothing about them. Indeed, they know nothing about themselves. Their identities have been shaped and reshaped so often, that not even Dr. Schreber (Kiefer Sutherland) who is the human assisting the aliens, even knows his identity--or for that matter where they all came from. This I found to be very scary indeed.<br /><br />I wish there were more films like this. Truly original and breathtaking in its vision. Detective Bumstead (William Hurt) was great in this film. I was intrigued how he himself began to question the reality around him. With his former detective partner and friend going insane; and his office filled with clues to what he has discovered; we witness Bumstead's character taking on an even more pensive demeanor: And his own thought processes begin to question the reality of his own life and that of John Murdoch. But it is the alien beings themselves who are most intriguing.<br /><br />The STRANGERS are some of the most bizarre characters ever in the pantheon of Science Fiction alien lifeforms. As masters of Dark City, the Strangers have manipulated the humans to a point where one finally manages to break free: John Murdoch. His ability to Que, as it is called, gives the rest of the humans hope; and this is the danger in which these alien's have themselves to blame. It is Murdoch's ability to break free of their control which alters the Strangers insidious designs on the human race. If you have not seen the film, I highly recommend it.

B00009NDAF|3.0|Gerstner had a big constraint while writing this book - he was writing for a general audience who may not have the inclination to know every single thing he did at IBM. Even after accounting for this, it is particularly disappointing that the book completely glosses over the real details surrounding the decisions that turned around the company. As he himself says, hard and tedious data crunching coupled with solid analysis is the basis of any decision and while the general public need not know the intricacies of every single thing, it is sad that he did not include a single case-study end-to-end.      The book starts and ends well but the second part gets bogged down with generalities. Business books that are replete with words like strategy, vision, execution and so forth are nothing new (that does not mean that the words are untrue but without supporting details, they makes the book cliche-ridden).     Retrospection over something that turned out well is a strange thing - it causes one to justify everything that one has done. It would also have been interesting to read what did NOT work out well during the authors tenure and what could have been different. What Gerstner did at IBM was truly phenomenal and by that yardstick, this book does not even measure-up.

0375507256|3.0|Without a doubt David Mitchell can write. He cleverly shifts pacing and language to distinguish between six \\"interwoven\\" narratives. Unfortunately the narratives each are only mildly interesting and the connections between them are superficial at best. The stories set in the future are the hardest to bear and make the occasionally prescient genre of science fiction look childish. The linear progression into the future and back into the past is incredibly predictable and the consequences of the stories can hardly be called consequences, more like mild coincidences. I see no reason to break the stories in the middle and conclude them later in the book as they are each for the most part isolated, with the exception that character B watches the movie of character A or some other trite connection. (Not to mention the recurrent birthmark). Perhaps if Mitchell would suggest that there is more than a draw to past lives, but that in a cycle of reincarnation there was also a connection to the future, and a reciprocal relationship between lives at any time there would have been more interest in the different periods. As it was the various eras became a stylistic device to try out different speech patterns with historic or futuristic set pieces. In fairness there are beautiful moments in the book and it is still worth a few lazy Saturday afternoons.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I was blown away by its disregard for social mores. It completely goes outside the standard Hollywood fare by taking on a real issue in contemporary society, while not working to \\"dumb-it-down\\" for the average movie-goer who is not interested in thinking.   <br /> <br />The United States is no more. It is in ruins and subject to civil wars and rampant disease. Does this sound familiar? It should, the United States in the future is Iraq. The \\"American\\" wars have devastated the world and withered away the nation's resources, while garnering the world's disdain and hate. The movie takes place in the near future in Great Britain. Britain is no longer a democracy, but instead it is ruled by fear and rampant misuse of power and resources. A secretive despot (called \\"Chancellor\\") sits at the head of the nation. His location is just given as \\"underground,\\" and he always speaks to his sycophants and the nation from this secure location. The Chancellor hates anything/anyone that gives him a tough time or might challenge is unyielding authority. He uses unfounded fear and Christian morals to maintain his authority. There's even a color-coded curfew system, which everyone is required to follow or suffer dire consequences. Does the Chancellor sound familiar? Again, he should, he is George W. Bush. The mouth of the Party--as they are called--is a government controlled 24 hour television station monopoly, called British Television Network (BTN), which \\"spins\\" the news to benefit the government. It is embodied in a building called Jordan Tower, which to me represented, perhaps, the Pentagon or NSA, where Fox News had relocated. It is complete with Christian inferences. Ironically, one BTN host states during his program, \\"I'm a God-fearing Englishman, and I'm goddamned proud of it!\\" During one part of the movie, a BTN producer of a news program, states, it's their job to report the news, and it is the job of the government to create the lies. Although, this movie is based on a comic series from the 1980s, it has striking parallels to modern issues and events through various allusions we can infer. <br /> <br />\\"V\\" is the ultimate voice of reason. He was a victim of a covert government research project, which left him scarred--mentally and physically--for life, hence his vendetta against those who have wronged him. He is forced underground into a world where he is surrounded by the facts and reminders of the past. He completely understands the issues of life in England. His goal is to liberate all the people of England from the oppression they have so meekly given their Chancellor. He uses various methods to destroy the government from the inside by preying on a top Party official's paranoia, while then giving the people a tactile vision of what freedom and popular sentiment really means, by succeeding where Guy Fawkes failed on November 5, 1605. Yes, he blows up Parliament; thereby, symbolizing a striking defeat to tyranny and a new beginning for the masses of England toward democracy and self-determination.  <br /> <br />In the end, \\"government by the people\\" is restored. \\"V\\" is deemed the patriot within all of us. Perhaps, \\"V\\" is the patriot in us as Americans. He envisioned a world without hate, a world returned to common sense, to rule by the people, from the hands of a dysfunctional, paranoid oligarchy.  <br /> <br />You may infer your own meaning, of course. But, of course, perhaps, we mustn't forget the 4th of July...the plot, the vision.
B0009F9O6W|4.0|Alright, I have to admit that this album is proggier than prog (the cover art is um, far out... yeah) and Peter Hammill's melodramatic delivery is an acquired taste. Still, 1971's Pawn Hearts is a far sight better, more radical, and progressive than anything that Yes, ELP, or even early Genesis ever did, and stands alongside the best works of Mk IV King Crimson and Gentle Giant when it comes to '70s art rock.<br /><br />Setting VDGG apart from most prog bands is their combination of avante-garde jazz and symphonic tendencies. Rarely does a guitar show up on this album (on Man-Erg courtesy of the great Robert Fripp), the lead instrument void being filled by Hugh Banton's organ/synths and David Jackson's aggressive sax. Hammill's over-the-top vocals are the centerpoint of a swirling vortex of dissonant jamming, angular melodies, and off-kilter instrumental harmonizing that stood apart from their more staid contemporaries.<br /><br />The overall mood is a lot darker, too. Lemmings/Cogs paints images of the sheeplike mass \\"crashing on quite blindly into the sea.\\" Man-Erg's subdued first few moments are abruptly broken up by a thorny transition into moody jazz, and the album's multi-part centerpiece A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers takes the listener on a 23-minute journey through pretty balladry to despair and madness and finally a poignant resolution (\\"all things are apart\\").<br /><br />The bonus tracks are intriguing as well, with a catchy 3-minute instrumental Theme One, a rough version of accompanying single W, and a few instrumentals slated to make it to a double-LP version of the album that was shot down by VDGG's record label. Amazingly, this VERY uncommercial album (no songs under ten minutes) managed to crack the #1 spot in Italy. Pawn Hearts has aged surprisingly well and has something to offer even for casual fans of prog. Recommended.

B000G759LW|5.0|To anyone who thought Christina was just another blonde pop princess...how wrong could you have been?! She is a chameleon, and her ever-changing style never ceases to amaze me. She comes across as a powerful woman, one who is not afraid to show her true colors and if anyone has a problem with that, it is beacuse of their own insecurities. This long-awaited album is simply fabulous! As an admirer of the 20's 30's and 40's I have fallen in love with this album! Christina's voice is so adaptable to any musical style, and she embodies everything from this era, from her marilyn-esque style of dress, to her soulful, passionate, hearty voice of the likes of Etta James, and so many others. I cannot begin to tell you all how much deep respect I have for this woman who is so driven and passionate about the thing she loves: music. And it really shows in each and every one of her songs. There is no denying that her voice is absolutely breathtaking; it draws you in and transports you to a time that many of us have never experienced. She is only 25, and yet she has the soul, knowledge, and experience of a much older, wiser person. Props to Christina for once again delivering an amazing album, and hopefully she will keep them coming for many, many years to come! Thank you for making music the way it should be sung!
B000G75AE8|3.0|Slayer is back, they haven't changed much.  They dubbed this some of the heaviest stuff they've written.  I can agree the music is fast, punishing and very much Slayer.  All is good with the music.  The lyrics deal with heavy subject matter, but they don't appear to have much thought or depth, like they were written in one day and left in draft form.  I think Slayer has been around long enough to have honed their skills when it comes to lyrics, and when Hanneman and Araya write the songs, they come out much better as a whole.  I always looked at some of Seasons as a great album lyrically as I'm not as familiar with their lyrics from '86-90.  Dead Skin Mask, Skeletons of Society and the title track had some great stuff in them.  They were heavy without all the shock value attempted in the lyrics here, \\"My choice is 666\\" and \\"Hail Satan\\".  Give me a break, that's not even creative or shocking, just plain dumb.  Unfortunately, King has written almost the whole album, which includes the sloppy lyrics.  If you don't give a flying shiznit what Araya is singing and you're happy as long as he's screaming, then you're good to go.  Bottom line, Slayer remain true to form, write a lot of fast stuff with tempo changes and gruesome lyrics while including a lot of weird leads that never seem to quite be in synch with the music.  So, if this were an instrumental, I would give it 5 stars, but the lyrics dragged it down to 3.  May Slayer be with you, always and forever.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|I just happened across the show one night.  I then began to watch it faithfully.  My husband then sat down one episode and he became addicted too!  We have to tape it and watch it together.  He let his sister borrow it and her and her husband became addicted!  You just can't wait for a new episode.  Now my husband's parents have borrowed it.   <br />  When it comes out I might buy 2 sets so I can watch one and loan one out. <br />  I really hope Veronica Mars is a long lived show and the networks don't make the mistake of dropping it without promoting it (like Firefly & Wonderfalls).

B000EMGAOY|5.0|Three words: get this cd! (you will love it).
B000E5KUK6|4.0|Okay, so I actually really like this movie. I have been a fan of the Japanese Godzilla for years. I was first introduced when the '98 Godzilla came out, and my parents told me about some of the older ones (mainly about King Kong vs. Godzilla). I wasn't allowed to watch the movie when it came out because it had a rating of PG-13 (I am now 14). I finally got to watch it some years later on TV, and LOVED it! A few years later, I got the movie for a VERY cheap price, while on a quest to collect EVERY Godzilla film made on DVD. And I watched it for the first time in years: <br /> <br />     The movie was OK for a Godzilla movie (there are worse ones), but just downright wonderful for a modern-day CGI monster movie (there aren't very many of those). Now, this movie stands out proudly in my DVD collection, and REALLY wish the two originally-planned sequels would have been made. The only reason I only give it a 4-star rating, is because it pails in comparison to the Japanese Godzilla. Great film.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|Easy to listen to these jams and I really love the unplugged version of \\"Fathers be good to your daughters.\\" A great cd to play when you have people over - it is appealing across different genres and I like to add it to the mix with several cds.
0765348780|3.0|After reading the reviews, but also talking to some people who have read Erikson's works, I must say I found myself to be an oddity. I neither love nor hate Erikson's works. Or, to be more precise, I love and hate them at the same time. <br /> <br />The problem with this book (as well as the entire Malazan series) is that both the proponents and the opponents are right. That is, Erikson's writing has some excellent points, but it has some major weaknesses itself. It's one of the very rare cases where I'd describe the quality of the writing as \\"controversial\\". <br /> <br />First, the strong points. Erikson is an excellent worldbuilder. He's an excellent character builder. He's a great plotbuilder. He's got all the qualities a good fantasy writer needs. If you find a plotline, you're guaranteed to find it well constructed. If you find a well-formed character, you'll find him/her believable and coherent. If you find some world description, it'll surely be breathtaking. <br /> <br />Now, the weak points. It's no coincidence that I started each of the sentences in the previous paragraph with \\"if you find\\". The problem with Erikson is, sometimes you get tired of searching. I think the one quality Erikson lacks most is underlining. Even mediocre fantasy authors know that in order to get the reader focused on their writing, they have to let him know what's important in the book and what's not. Erikson seems to ignore this truth - he seems to be constantly poking the reader, telling him \\"there are no less important parts in the book, everything is equally important\\". <br /> <br />To show how much this is an issue, a comparison. I find that Martin actually cares for the reader's attention and keeps track of his main characters and plotlines - I don't have such feeling with Erikson. The Malazan series are full of intricate descriptions of places that you'll never again see and that have no plot meaning, of characters that you focus on and study their development only to have them disappear and never show up again, finally, of plotlines that you consider major but that suddenly turn up to be only side-events of no real meaning.  <br /> <br />Then again, though I consider myself a capable reader, I also tend to be somewhat impatient. For a more patient reader, the abovementioned downsides might not be a problem at all - if you're the type of reader who reads the entire book inside out and remembers all the tiny details such as what the serving maid on page 154 wore, you're bound to love Erikson's books. Remember, his writing is really excellent - it's the \\"look and feel\\" that might scare you off. If you've had problems tracking through Martin or Hobb, you might want to stay off this one - just to avoid straining your nerves.

B000FSME1A|1.0|It is incomprehensible what Coppola has done to Apocalypse Now in this new edition.  Being a two disc set, one would think that the 1979 version would be on one disc, and the 2001 version on the other.  This is not the case.  Coppola has SPLIT the film into two halves, \\"Part One\\" of the '79 and '01 versions being on the first disc, and \\"Part Two\\" on the other.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is an absolutely amazing show, and I'm so disappointed that I didn't find out about it until it came out on DVD.  Though a space-western sounds like an odd mix, the characters and dialogue are so crisp, witty, well-written, and heartfelt that even non-scifi fans will enjoy it.

006074748X|3.0|Airs Above the Ground is not quite as compelling in its descriptions and plot as The Gabriel Hounds, My Brother Michael, or This Rough Magic (my favourite); however, it is still a classic Stewart mystery/romance, even if the romance is quite evident from the start. Vanessa March is quite likable and the only Stewart heroine thus far to not have annoyed me just a little bit. My favourite element of the book is the friendship that develops between Vanessa and young Tim Lacy, who is trying to break away from a stifling household and forge a path for himself. As far as the descriptions of exotic locales go, trademark to Stewart, I enjoyed the chase scene through the castle. Airs Above the Ground didn't wow me and I found the ending a bit strange as it didn't feature Annalisa at all..., but all in all, a pleasent read.
0143036556|4.0|Mr. Diamond has written an exellent book, with more accurate information and fewer omissions, misconceptions and flaws than I would expect of any book by anyone covering such a wide range of subject material. I recommend it heartily. <br /> <br />This being said, I'll now observe that he overlooks several aspects of human psychology and social behavior that are pertinent to his theme and go far to explain the phenomena he documents. <br /> <br />First off, almost all of us place more emphasis on the near future than on the far future, and for very good reasons. If I were offered a choice of $1,000,000 today or $10,000,000 dollars to be distributed to my grandchildren 50 years from now, I would take the million dollars today. Why? Because I have seen enough inflation (moderate in the USA, extreme elsewhere I have lived) to doubt the value of $10,000,000 50 years from now, even if the promise to pay is kept, which my experience leads me to doubt. And besides, how can I guess what the situation of my grandchildren will be 50 years from now and whether they will have a use for the money and a desire for it, even if they are still alive. You may make a different choice in this example, but I'd guess that if you think carefully about your own choices, you will find that in most cases you choose a predictable short-term gain to a problematic long-term gain. <br /> <br />Second, individuals and societies adapt, even unconsciously, to changing environmental conditions. Having been raised in the rural South many years ago, I am appalled at much of the packaged food sold in supermrkets, so full of taste enhancements, additives, coloring agents, preservatives and other contaminants, that I consider it unfit for human consumption. But most people raised in towns, cities or suburbs seem to prefer their fruit juice sweetened with corn syrup and laced with chemicals to color it and preserve it, and similarly with most other packaged foods. When I look at supermarket beef, I'm astonished; it comes from steers fed huge doses of antibiotics to make them grow fast and make their meat tastier, but I personally dislike to eat meat raised that way. And so on. Most people are either unaware or just don't mind. Which is ok; people are entitled to nake their own choices. Good furniture made today is very different from good furniture made in 1850, but few people realize how different, because most people don't crawl under tables, remove drawers to examine joinery, look at the backs of cabinets and hutches, ... as I do. By and large, people in the US get better furniture today than their forebears of 1850, because more of us can afford it, but the materials and cabinetry are far inferior to those of 150 years ago, for two reasons. First, the materials used for good furniture in the 1850s are essentially unbtainable today; a dropleaf dining table to seat ten people made in 1850 could have each leaf, and the top of the center section, made from a single piece of flawless butternut, but if butternut trees capable of yielding such lumber still exist today, they are not for sale at any reasonable price. Furthermore, very few Americans today can afford the cost of a skilled cabinetmaker doing first-rate work, so the joinery I see in modern furniture is almost always sloppy, except in the most obviously visible spots. But nobody sems to mind; we have adjusted comfortably to a higher standard of living with furniture that won't last. So, we make do with what we have. <br /> <br />Another factor that Mr. Diamond acknowledges but finds a bit mysterious is the fact that societies often ignore good and readily available alternatives. In many cases, it is because that alternative isn't obvious, and takes unavailable skill and training. My favorite example is related to the fact that in most of the Northeastern US fireplaces and wood stoves for heating are considered undesirable sources of smog. They need not be. If one knows how and when to cut, split and dry blacklocust, and how to preheat a wood stove to burn it, one gets a fire with the fuel value of anthracite, but that emits no smoke and essentially no pollutants except carbon dioxide. But black locust is not sold for firewood any place I've ever been; indeed it's considered a weed tree. Why? Because it's quite difficult to start it burning unless one knows how, and also because splitting and drying it takes some specialized knowledge. So this good source of alternative energy remains unused; few people know how, and those who do have no incentive to teach that skill to others in their communities. <br /> <br />Fourth, alternative energy sources pose a problem that's seldom discussed: the extreme difficulty of computing life-cycle environmental impact. Wind turbine towers for electricity generation are nearly nonpolluting in operation, but making the steel and other metals, plastics, lubricants and insulation they require is a task involving industrial processes that are intensiely polluting. So also with solar panels, heat pumps, geothermal energy, hydroelectric power, and other such sources. The current enthusiasm for \\"environmentally sound\\" energy sources is perhaps well founded, but who calculates, or can calculate, the overall environmental impact, including the impact of making, maintaining and disposing of all that stuff? I can't calculate it, and I believe few people can; even the federal government would have trouble doing it. <br /> <br />To conclude, I wish to correct one misconception in Mr. Diamond's book. He quite obviously believes that sheep-raising has less environmental impact than raising cattle, hogs and goats. Well, from being a long-ago farm boy with manure caked on my shoes, I can say with certainty that sheep do more to damage the environment than any of the other three species unless extreme care is taken. This is for three reasons. First, sheep crop grass right to the ground, so that it does not regenerate quickly, and until it does, the soil isvery subject to erosion. Second, unlike goats, sheep will not eat most kinds of weeds or shrubs, so pastures used continuously for sheep soon lose their grass and bacome weed-and-shrub-covered barrens. Third, sheep have a built-in habit of walking single file and using the same routes repeatedly, so on slopes their sharp hooves cut through sod and produce ready-made gullies that erode like crazy. These undesirable environmental effects can be avoided by intensive supervision of sheep herds, and frequent moving of the herd from one grazing area to another. To top this off, sheep, unlike goats, cattle or hogs, uniformly panic in the presence of predators, so one bear taking one sheep from a herd will typically result in a dozen or more dead sheep that fell off cliffs, drowned in streams,... These difficulties in raising sheep are the whole reason why skilled shepherds with trained sheep dogs still find employment. Given that Mr. Diamond lives in the Bitteroot Valley part of the time, I suggsst to him that he lease 40 acres of grassy hillside, put 40 sheep on it for three months, and see what they did to the land. He won't like it. <br /> <br />Still, this is a fine book.
B00007LTIL|5.0|I'm not a Dead-head and I've never seen a Dead concert - Okay I saw Bob Weir once - but I consider this to be the best album ever made by an American Band, and one of the top ten albums of all time. In 1970 the Dead stopped experimenting and started recording real songs, with great lyrics, catchy melodies and harmonies, and even hooks, by Gosh!  Workingman's Dead was the prototype, but they struck the vein later in the year with American Beauty.  All 10 songs work well. Even the harmonizing is breathtaking, meaning that Jerry Garcia's tendency to wander around the key doesn't mess up matters too much.  But what raises this album above many of its influences (the Band, the Byrds, Dylan, CSN) is its striving for spiritual union in the midst of a mundane, drug- and war-ravaged society.  So it makes perfect sense to me that one of the most sublimely mystical songs, \\"Attics of My Life,\\" is placed right before one of the great earthy rockers of the era, \\"Truckin'\\".  They flow right together, as do all the songs on the album, and the glue that holds them together is the tight playing and singing.
B00005NKK8|5.0|This is an excellent anthology of the music of the \\"Baby-Boom\\" generation, from childhood to early adulthood.  It is definitely the soundtrack  of our lives and it evokes many happy memories. Love this music.
B0000024SD|5.0|While I flip-flop on the issue, today I consider this Dylan's finest album.  When I first heard it back in the 70's, I considered the electric side dated and amateurish.  Any pre-Hendrix guitar work was always going to sound behind the times, and it was just too - well, lo-fi!  But the circle has turned, and lo-fi is in again, and this album miraculously sounds better than ever.  The acoustic side, though, is the true miracle, with two of Bob's best-ever songs, \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" and \\"It's Alright Ma.\\"  If you've only heard the Byrds' version of Tambourine Man, you haven't heard the song.  Nobody but Dylan can write songs that can be tough and tender at the same time, and he never did it better than right here.
B00005JOSS|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for a movie like this. It took me back to a time when movies were pure enchantment. I've always said movies should carry us away, and this one does. Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves share amazing on screen chemistry as lovers divided by time. They each give, in my opinion, the performance of their careers. We see a mature,and seasoned Keanu showing emotions in this movie that he's not explored before, at least not in such depth, and Sandra Bullock is tender and real. Their acting carries this movie beyond the ordinary. If you want to sit back and be swept  <br />away by romance and magic...see this one. I hope it comes out on DVD soon!!! Oh, and the soundtrack is haunting and beautiful.
B0007OCG4W|3.0|I wanted to like this.    But in the end I thought that it was a cold and inorganic piece of film, and that they didn't have the time to develop the warmth and character which would have made this interesting and moving.    It was a Love Rectangle - not uncommon in film. But I thought the people were fickle and changed their minds too often to be believable. It was like watching a game of relationship-chess which lacked impact, despite all the hard words spoken.    Worse, these expert actors didn't seem especially convincing.  Crying on cue is difficult, but the trick is making someone believe that you're really devastated - and the material didn't  work for me and from there the tears and emotion also felt like a trick.  Without sincere Love, the chess game has no solid goal and no sense of loss.  This had neither.    Oh well..
0393320928|4.0|This book starts off pretty interesting, but gets bogged down in criticism of NASA management.  While I agree with Mr. Feynman on this, I kind of got tired of it after a while.  Still, this is a worthwhile read, and if you're a Feynman fan I'd say get it.  If you've never read Feynman before I'd strongly suggest Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman! <br />

B000G759LW|4.0|This album was very different, and if you like that old soul jazzy sound from the 1920's-1940's you need to buy this cd, it's so not a typical Christina Aguilera sound.
0385338082|5.0|It's not that I'm a Chick Lit Snob, because I'm not.  I love children's literature for gosh sakes.  And, on occasion I have even enjoyed reading a few books in the chick lit genre!  But, I usually find that most of the books aimed at a certain female population to be quite trite with boring storylines and juvenile (as in written by a first grader) sentence structure.  This was all before I discovered Sophie Kinsella!  What a treat!  A few weeks ago I read CONFESSIONS OF A SHOPAHOLIC and really enjoyed it.  Then, a friend lent me CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? and I became immediately enchanted with this author's adorable little stories.  In fact, I have ordered the entire series! <br /> <br />From what I understand, the prolific writer Sophie Kinsella is a pseudonym for an even more prolific author Madeleine Wickham.  A combination of her middle name and her mother's maiden name, Kinsella created her new series of books to be an attempt to write a lighter and funnier fare.   She also stated that she didn't think anyone would think her idea of being in debt as funny but guess what?  Kinsella has made millions from her new stories and all future books will start having both names on the cover.   <br /> <br />CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET? is a precious, hilarious novel written in the first person.  Emma Corrigan is like a lot of us females.  She lies about her weight, pretends to like things she doesn't in order to get someone to like her, buys fake or used designer clothing and accessories and she feigns interest in subjects that she not only knows nothing about, but is able to totally think about something else.  That's why we love Kinsella's quirky heroines~~deep down inside, we have a lot of the same traits as these gals have!   <br /> <br />Emma, who is deathly afraid of flying is sent to a meeting in Scotland.  The meeting is a complete disaster and she becomes quite inebriated in anticipation of her flight back to London.  During a great deal of turbulence, she tells all of her deep secrets to the gentleman sitting next to her and then discovers that he owns the company that she works for.  This tale of Emma includes eccentric and amusing characters including:  flat mates (life long friend Lissy and the uptight vengeful man hunter Jemima), her co-workers and even quirky family members.  And most interesting of all is the handsome and complex Jack who sees something special in an ordinary and fallible young woman!  Even though some of the story is predictable, it is so funny and light that I didn't want to put it down.  What a great escape and an enjoyable trip!

B000G759LW|4.0|Overall, Christina's latest album is every bit as good as anything she has released prior.  There are at least half a dozen songs on these discs that have really catchy and unique melodies.  \\"Enter the Circus,\\" \\"Candyman,\\" \\"Ain't No Other Man,\\" \\"Still Dirrty,\\" and \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\" will draw you in and entertain you over and over.  Unfortunately, like her last album, there are some dull and uninteresting songs and interludes mixed in.  The first CD starts with a lame \\"Intro\\" song explaining the theme behind the album.  Later on, the 5 minute \\"Thank You\\" features messages from her fans about how Christina has touched their lives.  These two tracks alone put somewhat of a damper on this set.  But worst of all, the set ends with perhaps the 2 most boring songs on the discs (\\"Save Me From Myself\\" and \\"The Right Man\\").  If you burn a copy of your CDs to play in your car (like I do), both of these discs combined will fit on one 80 minute blank disc (with about 1 minute to spare).  With some recommended editing, you can shave it down to under 60 minutes.  There will be enough quality material left for a solid piece of work.
0670034711|3.0|I picked up this book after rave reviews from a book club and for the first half of it I could not figure out why they liked it so much. I felt the author came through as extremely immature and somewhat shallow- I found the section on Italy read a lot like the diary of a girl who just graduated from high school going to see Italy before she went off to college. Oooh, cute boys, drinking wine, do you think that cute boy thinks I'm cute?However, there were some really lyrical and amazing passages sprinkled in with this so I kept on reading. You could really see how she developed as a person as she went through India and on to Bali. Her account of the ashram and how it changed her was interesting, I could totally sympathize with her difficulties getting her mind to shut up during meditation! While it was somewhat enjoyable to see that progression I didn't find her interesting enough to keep me enthralled with the book.  <br />And she really did give short shrift to places she had been. I know this book was not supposed to be a travel guide but more of her personal journey but as someone who has been to both Italy and Bali (funny enough I was there in Ubud the same time she was!) I don't think she did any justice to the beauty and magnificence of either of these places which is what I found most disapointing. To only concentrate on the food in Italy is such a pity considering the beautiful architecture, and to not talk about Balinese food more...I just felt there was so much more to be conveyed! It really was like reading a 20 something's diary and as I've often felt when I have looked back on my own journal entries, they aren't all that interesting to people other than you. There were a few sections that really grabbed me so overall it was a worthwhile read but not a strong recommendation. <br />One last thing I would like to mention in response to the person who didn't like the political references, I actually felt she really downplayed the prevalance of these discussions. As soon as anyone, fellow travelers and locals alike found out we (my travel buddy and I) were Americans, ALL they wanted to talk about was the election and the war. It was really exhausting after a while.

B000EMG904|5.0|This isn't a review, but a way to find 'Matrix Reloaded' and 'Revolutions' for the US PSP (if curious). <br /> <br />It can be found in the UK, as all 3 Matrix UMD's are Region 0. <br /> <br />What I've found out is that the short list of Warner Bros UMD's are all Region 0, meaning they work on ALL PSP systems.  <br />I've have tested this UMD on both my US Region 1 and Australian Region 4 PSP's, and they work fine. <br /> <br />I dig this flawed trilogy, and great to watch on the fly.

B000FVQM2Y|1.0|Pseudo intellectual and weak drama <br /> <br />There seems to be a lot of praise for the 'witty dialog' in this movie. <br />Don't believe it! It is not so smart - just basic 'dialog replacement' that appears to the uninitiated as code. <br />Those who crack the code (and therefore understand the dialog) feel a sense of accomplishment (like a Sudoku puzzle solver) and therefore, since they feel smart, they assume that the dialog must be witty. <br /> <br />It works like this: <br />Think of a well used phrase (e.g. Who is he/she hanging with) <br />Replace with some teen like verbiage (Who is he/she eating with)  <br />and you have it! <br /> <br />If this seems like witty dialog to you then go ahead and waste your hard earned cash on this trash. <br />Better to spend it on Rock and Roll High School - Well, at least that has the Ramones in it! <br /> <br />\\"Gabba Gabba Hey\\"  - Now That's some good writing!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I admit, I only really like a couple of songs on the whole CD, but they're worth writing a review about. Of course, \\"Crazy\\" is great. But I love that they re-did the Violent Femmes song, \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" I think they did a great job at that.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects absolutely blew me away the first time I saw it. I've seen it several times since and the intelligence of it is still amazing. I won't provide a plot outline since others have already done that. I will state that if you've never seen this movie then don't deprive yourself any longer. You will NOT be disappointed.

0783239955|5.0|When this movie started, both my wife and I sighed - another movie with subtitles to read.  But it quickly got us engrossed with the brilliantly funny concept - invite idiots to dinner.  I'm almost inclined to start our own version in Hanover - but that is besides the point. <br /> <br />The movie is laugh out loud funny, and while I don't speak a word of French, the expressions and the tone of voice of the protagonists conveys a lot of the feel of the situation.   <br /> <br />It is crisp, short and well worth reading subtitles.  A must see.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Man, this is a good album.<br /><br />Though it hardly makes me unique, I was a fan of TEN way back before Pearl Jam broke world-wide. (It's not that my judgment was that great, I just happen to live in the Pacific Northwest.)<br /><br />And PEARL JAM is the group's best effort since then.<br /><br />This project satisfies on a number of levels; the songs are top-notch and memorable, and Vedder's lyrics are atypically direct. But most dramatically, PEARL JAM rocks. If you want visceral, hard-hitting, thrombosis-inducing guitar riffs, you got it. In fact, if you know of a clench-fisted, hardcore rock kid who thinks of Pearl Jam as old-timers, gift this CD to him. After he hears \\"Big Wave,\\" your \\"thank you\\" note will be in the mail.

B00005V9QJ|3.0|I purchased the DVD of this concert 2-yrs,. before I purchased the CD and was hoping to have the FULL concert on the CD. The CD represents only 50% of the concert that was on the DVD. Many great concert monments and songs were left off the CD. The band \\"jam\\" during Smooth Operator is one example. For those of us who appreciate the musicians talent, writing and production were left short.  <br /> <br />In addition, I thought the crowd noise was to high for a live production. <br /> <br />The above reasons were the only reason not to give \\"5-stars\\". I only wish it would have been a double CD with the whole concert. <br /> <br />For those who have the resources and a good quality home DVD set-up I would highly recommend the DVD of this concert. One of the best in my collection.

B00005JNRY|5.0|CARS is the latest hit from animation power-house Pixar.  The story begins at the annual Piston Cup.  It's the biggest racing event of the year and there are three favorites to win:  conceited Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton), The King and reigning champion Strip Weathers (Richard Petty), and young maverick Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson).  McQueen seems to be a sure bet to win, but at the finish line the race ends in a three-way tie.  The officials decide that a run-off race between the three cars will be held in L.A.<br /><br />On the road trip across the country to L.A., Lightning finds himself stranded in the dessert.  After a late night chase with a cop, McQueen finds himself in the jail of small town Radiator Springs.  The judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) sentences McQueen to refinish the road he destroyed.  Time is running out until the big race off in L.A., but his community service allows McQueen to finally know and understand that the most important things in life don't necessarily involve living in the fast lane.<br /><br />CARS was faulted by many critics at the time of its initial release as being a good movie with some impressive voice talent, but, nevertheless, the worst of Pixar's films.  There's a reason for this.  CARS is all about small towns, NASCAR, and Route 66.  Most critics live either on the West Coat, the East Coast, or in Chicago.  The movie greatly appeals to middle America, the heartland of the country.  For someone used to a metropolitan lifestyle, CARS must be difficult to understand.  However, for anyone who lives in middle American or who has an interest in NASCAR or Route 66, CARS is a film that you will probably adore.  I know I do.
B000B8QEZG|4.0|I was frustrated by the cynicism that created Confessions On A Dance Floor nearly as much as I was by the music on my first couple of listens.  Madonna, reeling from the world's rejection of American Life, her \\"personal,\\" \\"political,\\" and \\"stripped down\\" record (or, more accurately, \\"disastrous\\"), did what she always does when she needs a successful reinvention - creates a dance hit.  \\"Hung Up\\" did seem a sloppy single, and the record, from its awkward title to its disco-cursive interior, seemed like a record designed exclusively to remind you of its trashy simplicity.  That's ok, I suppose - her 2000 release Music remains one of her finest records, after all - but its high-pulse disco production left me about as cold as anything else in this album's release.  Still, I found myself unable to get \\"Hung Up\\" out of my head, a phenomenon that only got worse when the album's deeper cuts kept showing up on my iPod - \\"Hour High\\" with its confessional aggression, \\"Get Together\\" with its delicate come-ons, \\"Forbidden Love\\" with a sensuality that defies (or completes?) its computerized hooks - these songs seemed as genuine and addicting as any Madonna songs I could remember.  That all makes Confessions a scrappier album than it appears, eventually making its blitzkrieg attempt to get its listeners to have fun successful (and ok - fun too).  I'm not nuts about all of it - \\"Push\\" and \\"Sorry\\" are as annoying as any Madonna song this side of \\"Love Makes The World Go Round\\" - but I do have to give Madonna credit where she deserves it; no one confesses like she does.

0446677450|5.0|This book must be approached carefully.     On one hand, reading it is an excellent way to begin to turn your mind around about money. My parents bought timeshare condos and viewed the timeshare condos as \\"investments,\\" because they would at least theoretically appreciate and could be inherited. They also spent thousands of additional dollars every year in \\"maintenance fees\\" and bought the percentage of a condo on a mortgage at usury interest rates. I knew that there was something wrong, and I sat down and did the math and figured that each condo unit was worth about $5 million to the guys that built it, plus yearly income. Buying a similar condo outright would have been about 100K, at the time. I tried to show my mom that by investing that money in the stock market or something, after 10 years (the length of the mortgage) they'd have more than enough to take fantastic vacations anywhere for the rest of their lives, but she had none of it. That was when I figured out the difference between and \\"investment\\" and a \\"liability.\\" Those condos were liabilities. They just kept sucking money every year. Getting your head straight between something that you pay for and something that pays you is worth the price of this book.     However, some of the things that Kiyosaki says that he did to accumulate his wealth give me the creeps, like when he bought some land for $150K, and then turned around and sold half of it to a friend for $150K. I would never do business with this guy.     In summary, this is a good place to begin your financial literacy journey because it teaches you the vital difference between assets and liabilities, a distinction confused by advertisers in today's society.     However, as many other reviews have noted, there is precious little solid information in this book. You will need other skills to build wealth. No book can tell you everything, all at once.     There is one more important lesson to be learned from this book, though it is an unintended one: branding and building a business. Kiyosaki self-published this original book, and all the later ones, too, and has built a huge business on the Rich Dad/Poor Dad financial products. He makes a whole boatload of money off them. That's another lesson to learn.     TK Kenyon  Author of [[ASIN:1601640021 Rabid: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:1601640226 Callous]]: A Novel

For instance, it's interesting that one reviewer said this book is not great science fiction like Herbert's Dune, but is still well worth getting.  My first thought was, thank God, because I can't stand Herbert.  (I am convinced it is not necessary to spend 2 pages describing what a sand dune looks like.)  But the work of Herbert is great science fiction, there is no denying that.  My point, therefore, is that different people like different things.<br /><br />Because it really is up to individual taste, my philosophy about reviews is to not write them unless I think it is really important to note how good a book or writer is.  (Or how bad, sometimes.)  This book is good enough to write a review.  Way, way good enough.<br /><br />With Old Man's War, the influence of Heinlein is clear, but as others have noted, it is also quite different from Heinlein.  Many artists or musicians or writers have produced great works inspired by other great work before them.  That is the case here.  Same point to be made with The Forever War.  Same sort of thing, yet very different, too.  So if you liked either or both of those books, this one is a good bet.<br /><br />Don't worry about Old Man's War being some kind of cheap knockoff.  Don't worry about Scalzi writing a pale imitation because he couldn't think up his own story.  Neither concern is valid.<br /><br />The story moves along very well, there were no flat spots that I recall, unusual even with great writers.  The science is interesting, the experience of the main character is interesting, and the world created in the pages is interesting.  Actually, I thought it was all fantastic, and I could hardly put the book down, but I'm trying to restrain myself.<br /><br />I do think this book is more than a pleasant diversion, I have to say.  It's better than that.  It has too great a story with far too much skill at telling the story to just be a pleasant little afternoon read.  But it is not particularly deep or dense reading, and thus you may finish it in an afternoon and feel I'm wrong about that.sant little afternoon read.

0670034711|5.0|I'm an avid reader, and have never written a review, but since I've recommended this book -- unsolicited -- to more than 10 people, I had to put my thoughts here, too. <br />This book is a breath of fresh air. It's heartwarming, personal and deeply resonated with me. I couldn't put it down and I want to read it again. I'm sad it's over. My friend who read it recently said, \\"I am trying to save it so it's not over.\\" Another friend has highlighted passages to refer to later. I love this book and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a dash of healthy guidance.
B00005O3VC|5.0|Depending on your sense of humor and taste for the absurd, this is either the funniest movie of all time (which I think it is) or a complete waste of celluloid (or whatever film is made of these days :) For those that do \\"get it,\\" you can watch this movie a hundred times and still find something new and freshly amusing each time. If that doesn't define a \\"classic\\", I don't know what does! Watch it, or I shall taunt you a second time!
B0002Y4TOM|4.0|I am a latecomer to this show....heard about it but that's where it ended.  Now I can say that I am definitely a fan!  The show is extremely clever and very well written.  The characters are very original and fun.  There are so many funny references to people and events in the past that is has become a challenge to identitfy them.  I have just finished season 2 and have gone on to season 3.  Still the same quality.
B000BYA4JM|2.0|So yeah, the film, & the script has a lot of problems, but I don't understand why critics gave Madonna a bad review. She played this character like a pro. She was funny & sooooooooooooooooooo adorable! She made me want to be Nikki Finn. <br /> <br />I think Madonna got on this path of bad films because somebody in the industry wanted her to fail as an actress......there's no reason for Madonna to be coined \\"a bad actress\\" because of this film......she was just as natural here as she was in Desperately Seeking Susan.
B00005JP5J|5.0|It really is a bit of a shame that the best movie of the summer isn't playing on three screens at your local mall. In fact, it may not even be playing locally in your area. But even if you have to drive seven hundred miles in your broken VW Bug, and you have to push it half the way, it is well worth it. This is an alternately hilarious, dark, and poignant movie, that measures family values (everyone cheers on the under-dog daughter at the end) and dark, wildly innapropriate (but also uproarious) humor (the grandfather snorts heroin and reads porn magazines.  <br /> <br />Let me just say how good it is to see a suburban family whose home is in shambles, and who has to come up with an amount of money everyone can spend when they go to Denny's. In a movie like 'A History Of Violence', or I guess more commercially, 'Freaky Friday', the family's house is clean, prim and proper with nary a stray feather to be found. They usually have big dinners that the mother cooks, and the kids are usually perfect, as are the obligatory live-in relatives. In this movie, the house is such a mess that in an early scene, mother Sheryl (Toni Collette, doing a much different version of parenting than in 'The Night Listener') pushes chairs and kicks toys out of the way. She doesn't cook dinner. She brings home chicken and all of the side dishes that the restaurant includes. She throws together a salad, then throws some pops on the table for dessert. Hardly a cliche. But, the kids are not cliches either. The son, Frank (an expressive Paul Dano, and one would have to be when you're not talking) has taken a vow of silence because of, and I know I'm spelling this wrong, Fredrick Neichae. Their daughter, Olive (Abigail Breslin) is not pretty by many peoples standards (although on a recent cover of Entertainment Weekly she looked better than she does here, which is a smart decision of the filmmakers to downplay her looks so that she doesn't look like every single other beauty pageant contestant. <br /> <br />The title refers to the beauty pageant that Olive has placed in, and the plot revolves around the family driving to Rodondo Beach, California. Olive's father (it is never made clear if he is her real father, since references are made to Frank's father that Sheryl divorced, and Richard never treats Olive like his own) Richard (Greg Kinnear) is a motivational speaker who tells his kids that you shouldn't attempt anything if you don't think you'll win. It seems that he shares Reese Bobby's train of thought. Kinnear plays the same character here that he did in 'The Matador', only a little bit more of a jerk. Steve Carrell plays Sheryl's brother, a gay, suicidal Proust scholar who has to live with Sheryl because he can't be alone after trying to slit his wrists. <br /> <br />The whole family has to go to California, and on the way, where there could have been cliched road trip calamities, like the car blows a tire or the car dies and the family has to buy a new car or rent a car, and this usually, in any normal movie, would take up three hours, and then the family would have to speed to their destination. There car does die, but they find a way around it so that they can use the same car, which probably isn't as different as it looks, but it was good enough for me.

0930289455|4.0|With all the hoopla about Heath Ledger being cast as the new Joker, many a fan are wondering if he can pull of a psychotic, blood thirsty role. How can you not take a character seriously when he has done unarguably the most damage to the Bat family? To quote rocker Tommy Lee, \\"If you're all YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGHH! all the time, it's fake.\\" I think the same applies to the Joker. You can only take mystery and incessant piss and vinegar so far. Batman fans come in all shapes, sizes and ideals on the character. The same can be said for the Joker. It all depends on how you see the character, if you like the psychotic mean because he is angle you might site Arkham Asylum as the definitive Joker. If you are a fan of the harmless prankster then please by all means have a ball with Cesar Romero's Joker. What Moore managed to pull off was perhaps the most ingenius way of introducing a tragic orgin for the Ace of Knaves and still keep the character from being watered down. The Killing Joke gives us an insight to the Joker's twisted psychosis and offer a hint of humanity that exists in even the most vile of monsters. Even in the Clown Prince of Crime. Arkham Asylum was intended for people who like heavy metal, Killing Joke was written for people who appreciate comics and aren't afraid when writers take risks with characters even the Sacred Cow the is the Joker.<br /><br />By now, you are probably familiar with the basic premises of the story: Batgirl gets shot, stripped naked, Gordon gets the same treatment, enter Batman to save the day, and all this for the Mogul of Montebanks to prove that insanity can happen all because of \\"one bad day\\". People who criticize the tragic orgin angle are apt to forget that this adds a whole new depth to the character. He is more than senseless violence and dark humor. It makes him three dimensional and it adds a whole lot more to the Batman/Joker dynamic. Another smart move Moore made was to keep Joker's orgin debatable. We don't know exactly what happened but by not saying yes THIS is what happened, it wouldn't do justice to the Joker's fluid psychosis. Hogwash, I say this is a character you take seriously. It's not about sympathizing with him, rather, add another dimension from most fanboys comfort zone of twisted, psychotic, utterly demented Joker. We see both extremes here. Call this reinventing the Joker post crisis and Moore nailed it. Not even Jack Nicholson could do this justice, though he was good too. Moore is too hard on his own creations, but don't let that deter you.<br /><br />Brian Bolland's talent at drawing Killing Joke delivers exuberant beauty and intricacy that rivals Tim Sales, hell, even Jim Lee! (I'm serious!) The gunshot panels that bleed red/orange make you feel Barabara's anguish. The colorful atmosphere during Joker's song add to the chaos. Perhaps what gets most points was Bolland's ability to make different facial expression's for the Joker while keeping them believable. The infamous HA HA HA scene after coming out of his chemical bath is unforgetable. Hell, as I type, I really can't think of a perfect word to describe Joker in THAT state except nothing short of bone chilling. Joker was born. From that to the hall of mirrors as he explains his life philosophy to the Dark Knight. His sad almost pleading facade as he asks his adversary \\"Why aren't you laughing?\\" seem to cry Help! Of course at the end when Batman offers rehabilitation to which Joker rebuffs reestablishes their relationship as hero and villain, order and chaos, Sonny and Cher. They need eachother and Moore did a great job with alluding to their deadly associations with one another. That would explain why Batman was laughing at the end. Or perhaps it was a nervous twitch. Don't listen to the obsessive one dimensional types who claim that the shared laugh was lame. It just shows that they don't appreciate the deadly delicate dance that Batman and Joker share. Either way, it is up to the reader to interpret that and other aspects of Killing Joke. A must read for any Joker fanatic. The only reason it got four out of five was because it was too short. Here's to Absolute Edition treatment for Killing Joke!of Killing Joke. A must read for any Joker fanatic. The only reason it got four out of five was because it was too short.

B00012L786|3.0|Richard Widmark plays them all. Later in his career he does numerous westerns & even a mad Navy ship's captain. In this one he is Skip McCoy a happy-go-lucky career criminal. His performance is above the movie itself. He is a pickpocket who steals Candy's (Jean Peters) wallet. Unknown to both of them she is a courier for communist spies & had a piece of microfilm with government secrets in her wallet. The Feds know about it too. Soon they're both in trouble & turn to each other in some of the movies best scenes. She's in trouble with her commie bosses. He's in trouble because he is already a three time loser. He's not particlarly patriotic, even when he figures out what he has. He is looking for a big score. He has to reconcile, doing the right thing, going straight & pursuing a long-term relationship with Candy. Widmark does the best he can with the material he's given in this average B movie. I give him ****.
B00005JNEI|4.0|My teen-age son specializes in techno-art and his comment to me costs this film one star--he says that the out of context mixing of video clips is very low rent and almost unethical.  Seems like a very good point.<br /><br />The film does, however, offer many important points that I summarize here for those who have been--as I was--reluctant to invest the time or money in this controversial film.  It *is* worth buying or renting and watching.<br /><br />The most important point early on is many Members of the House of Representative demanded Congressional action in the aftermath of the known illegal disenfranchisement of people of color across Florida, and not a single Senator, including Al Gore as President of the Senate, was willing to sign on and force the issue.  For this alone Al Gore will never get a vote from me, and I am fairly disgusted with the entire body.  I am *very* surprised that Senator Byrd did not sign on, and wonder what kind of deal was made in the back rooms of the Senate.  From that one decision have stemmed 6 years going on eight of a half trillion dollar war with thousands of dead and tens of thousands of amputees and disabled veterans whom Bush has been trying to sideline, cutting their benefits and medical care.<br /><br />He reminds us of the eggs thrown on the motorcade on inaugural day, and the documented fact that Bush was on vacation 42% of the time in his first 8 months.<br /><br />Not one meeting on terrorism in all that time.  The film is in error in claiming Bush did not read the 6 August report.  As James Risen notes in \\"State of War\\" Bush got a frantic personal briefing from CIA, and then blew them off with the obscene comments \\"OK, you've covered your ass on this.\\"<br /><br />The film traces the connection between Saudi money, Bush, and his National Guard flying buddy Bath, and the later the Carlyle Group, where partner George Bush Senior was the ONLY President to continue to demand CIA briefings after retirement.  The film correctly points out that $1.4 billion dollars from the Saudis invested in the Bush family carries a lot more weight than the $400K a year salary from the taxpayer, one reason, no doubt, why 142 Saudis got to fly out of America on 6 private planes after 9/11 while all Americans were grounded.<br /><br />We are reminded of George Bush Juniors obstruction of justice in the 9/11 Commission investigation, and pointedly reminded that Iraq was put in play on 13 September despite strong assertions from Dick Clark and others that Iraq had nothing to do with the attack.<br /><br />We are reminding that Attorney General John Ashcroft lost his Senate race against a dead man still on the ballot, and that Ashcroft pointedly told the FBI he did not want to hear about terrorism.<br /><br />The movie overall highlights Donald Rumsfeld as a fraud, with clips of his speaking about the \\"humanity of precision targeting\\" followed by clips of mass destruction.<br /><br />There is a fascinating discussion of how poverty across America is producing recruits for the military who would not normally volunteer, and then pointedly shown Congressmen ducking interviews because only 1 of the 535 has a son in Iraq.<br /><br />There are moving interviews with people who lost children in Iraq, and two points jump out: the first is that the general public does not distinguish between the need to honor their loved one's sacrifice and our Armed Forces, and the need to condemn and hold accountable the political leadership that lied to all Americans, to Congress, and to the United Nations.<br /><br />The second point is that those who lost children do not blame Al Qaeda; they blame the political leadership of America, but not in a strong enough manner to demand impeachment (yet).<br /><br />The movie concludes that the object of war is continuous war to keep the current hierarchical system of wealth, power, and privilege in place.<br /><br />It's a very strong creative effort, marred only slightly by what myteen-age son considers to be video editing slights of hand.marred only slightly by what my teen-age son considers to be video editing slights of hand. <br />

1401206905|5.0|Even Miller himself doesn't have to be over the top ala Dark Knight Returns and Dark Knight Strikes back. The man can pen a well written story with shoving things down our throats. Here we are introduced to Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone and how organized crime has taken a permanent residence in Gotham City. You can tell Nolan and Goyer were influenced by this piece of work in Begins. The inner monologue of Bruce Wayne hinting at his pent up frustation of the plague that infests Gotham City as he manifests that anger into the form of the Batman flows beautifully from the pages. I personally will take this over the ever overrated Dark Knight Returns any day!
1592401791|5.0|Emerick's book is incredible, if you're a musician concerned with an accurate \\"fly on the wall\\" account of much of the Beatles' recording history by someone who was probably just as instrumental in helping them craft the sound that pretty much guided the entire Rock Music Industry in its direction with close-microphone techniques and other ground-breaking methods that have been imitated ad infinitum virtually ever since they recorded Revolver.  <br /> <br />If, however, you're looking for a \\"dirty laundry\\" portrait of the personalities of the Beatles, look elsewhere. Emerick readily admits that he was their engineer, and he simply states the way he feels he was treated by them over the years. Early on they were close-knit and would usually close ranks if anyone in the EMI studios were to try to wedge into the group. Later some would become more difficult to work with in the studio, and he admits this, speculating that drug use and/or other factors could be at play. But Emerick's account is to be valued primarily as a look at one person's viewpoint of the creative process that was at work when the Beatles recorded these seminal Rock recordings, and for this we should be very grateful. I would imagine that people more concerned with personality analysis' of the Beatles would be disappointed while true musicians, and musical producers, and people who are capable of retaining interest in the creative recording process will be the most rewarded by reading this book. <br /> <br />I was very happy to buy this book at full price, and the Amazon price is much a better deal.  <br /> <br />Emerick also goes into some of the Apple Records building process and his time over there, sometimes with none of the Beatles present.  <br /> <br />In fact, the personality clashes, if they ever happened, were viewed as a hindrance in Emerick's mind to the proper job at hand, which is why he sometimes seems cruel in his account of Lennon's rough treatment of the crew in the studio.  <br /><br />I find his opinions to be very consistent with how I imagine the recording process to have gone, and he verifies that McCartney was usually the driving force behind the recordings and he had the most will to drive the genius into greatness, while Lennon's genius was less consistent, yet more effective during some of the songs he wrote.  <br /> <br />Geoff Emerick is a recording engineer extraordinaire, having recorded for other artists such as Elvis Costello, mixing Supertramp's \\"Even In The Quietest Moments\\" among others.  <br /> <br />His Grammy awards for best engineering came on Sgt Peppers, Abbey Road, and McCartney and Wings' Band On The Run.  <br /> <br />He is entirely qualified to state his opinion about the personalities of the Beatles but his opinions should be tempered by the fact that he was an engineer, a professional there to do a job. You can hear his input on all these records if you listen for it, and he was probably a valued part of the team, as evidenced by the fact that the newly-formed Apple corporation successfully tried to hire him away from EMI studios.  <br /> <br />His qualifications to speak clearly and concisely about his experience recording with the Beatles is undeniable. That is more than can be said for simple Rockstar gossip crap books that exist in abundance out there. I can do without that extra stuff that serves no purpose other than to color the brilliance of the Beatles' music with unproven innuendo. <br /> <br />Until McCartney releases a truly thorough account this will have to serve as one of the most important historical documents about the Beatles recording history in existance.

B000FSME1A|1.0|I owned the previous versions and I am disappointed that the movies were split into 2 discs on this complete dossier set. The movies were not showed in the cinemas with intermissions when they were released. <br /> <br />It does not make too much sense to arrange the movies this way. The only reason I saw it happening was to avoid 2 causal viewers sharing the cost of buying this already discount-priced set and each getting a version of the movie home. Of course, this is just my little conspiracy theory to vent my dissatisfaction with the new set. <br /> <br />The sad part of this story is: I may buy the DVD(s) again if they do it right (possibly including the Heart of Darkness) the next time.
1563894696|5.0|I came back from a ten year Bat hiatus this time last year after reading an essay on the Dark Knight in my English 101 class. Back then Batman was apart of my daily afterschool TV diet: The character, the stories, the rogues gallery. He was an integral part of my childhood and now as I embark on a second chapter in my life I am thrilled to say that he is still there. After reading up on what was going on during DCs Infinite Crisis/One Year Later, I asked around for what the fans thought was the best, or at least a really good, Batman story. All the answered varied but I did notice a pattern and Long Halloween was one story I decided to risk and tackle.<br /><br />Best $$$ I ever spent! An intricate tale of whodunit, a wonderful cast of characters and Tim Sale's art, all combine and come together in this work of art that is sure to make the reader have an appreciation for the Dark Knight and forever leave the idea that Batman is for kids/60s camp TV show. This is the Batman you take seriously! Jeph Loeb, a wonderful craftsman on the pen, keeps you guessing and even with all the explanations at the end leaves his audience thinking: \\"How did he do that?\\" He showed it here and he showed it in Dark Victory and Hush which I also highly recommend.<br /><br />The story is about a mysterious murderer nicknamed Holiday who is suspected as being responsible for the murders linked to Carmine \\"The Roman\\" Falcone's organized crime and its strangling grip it holds on Gotham City, which we first meet in Frank Miller's Year One. Here we are also introduced to another integral character in Batman's mythos, DA Harvey Dent, whose forboding tendancies become more apparent and are a significant harbinger of things to come. Even I, as a hardcore Joker fanatic, place this a bit higher than Moore's Killing Joke but for now, let's save that for another matter. 13 chapters of suprises will leave you gasping for more as it was difficult for me to put this down the first time I bought it, and it took me three and a half to four hours.<br /><br />Now some people will complain that Loeb's habit of using villains' for eye candy is excessive and albeit annoying. I would have to disagree. They are the perfect red herring and distraction for the Dark Knight. Joker becoming jealous and going into the crime lord's villa and challenging him was chilling, Ivy's feminine wiles to distract Bruce were well done and Scarecrow and Mad Hatter's Team up was a riot!<br /><br />Tim Sale's art has been underhanded way too many times. I think he adds an interesting take on the characters and making them his own. I like how he made Selina look. She wasn't a blonde bimbo like how you would normally see her. The black long hair made her look sultry and a bit predatory, which fit like a glove with her characterization. Some people have complained the Joker looked a bit toothy here. Well apparently he did also in Hush. It just adds to his overall psychotic/predatory nature. Sale adds a sort of definition to the women instead of making them look all bulimic a la the Gotham Knights episodes. And for that Long Halloween gets my fifth point.<br /><br />It's a great buy! If you like detective, film noir, Batman or a combo of all three, well, what are you waiting for!?and a half to four hours.

B000BKVQTS|5.0|Despite the low opinions of most in regards to this film, I still thought it was a terrific romp through some of my favorite fairy-tales.<br /><br />Fairy tales have been passed down through generations as entertaining stories full of traditional morals and lessons used to instruct children (and often adults) on such things as good behavior, how to treat others, and general life lessons that everyone should learn.<br /><br />Fairy-tales have been moderated over the years to make them more kid friendly (for example, in the original translation of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", the Prince actually has sex with the Princess he finds sleeping in a tower, and then leaves before she wakes up. Obviously, this ending was changed to where, instead, the Prince awakens the beautiful Princess with the kiss of true love (something that occurrs in other tales, such as Snow White).<br /><br />\\"The Brothers Grimm\\" takes an applaudable approach to revamping some of our best-known fairy tales into an entertainingly NEW story. By fusing together stories such as Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Rapunzel, Hansel and Gretel, and many more, \\"The Brothers Grimm\\" presents new elements and insights into these stories that are so steeped in tradition. I challenge you to watch the whole film and try to pick out the details from each fairy-tale. Try to catch the inside jokes, and little *winks* the film gives to so many different tales.<br /><br />The DVD version contains many fun features, including deleted and extended scenes. One of these deleted scenes, in which the two brothers and their \\"lady fair\\" are attempting to escape the attack of an enchanted tree, is one of the most *expensive* scenes to ever have *not* made it into the movie!<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and it reminded me of my deep love of fairy tales. If for nothing else, at least credit the film with \\"thinking outside the box\\" when it comes to translating traditional fairy-tales on film. This wasn't a simple retelling of a fairy tale, as can be found in abundance on DVD...it really tried to poke fun at itself, and present a *new* story mixed in with so much tradition.<br /><br />It also doesn't hurt to have such a star cast, with Matt Damon and Heath Ledger creating a comical \\"odd-couple\\" duo.

B0002FR07O|5.0|THE BAND: Steve Wilson (lead vocals, guitars, mellotron, keyboards, samplers & tapes), Richard Barbieri (keyboards, synthesizers & sequencers), Colin Edwin (bass), Chris Maitland (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC(S): Originally released in 1997, this revised and remastered foldout digi-pak 2-disc set released in 2004. 22 songs clocking in at approximately 108 minutes (the original 12-track album is disc-1 at approximately 62 minutes, and the 2nd (bonus) disc titled \\"Insignificance\\" at approximately 46 minutes). Included with the discs is a 6-page booklet containing songs titles/credits, song lyrics, musicians, and odd pictures. The \\"Insignificance\\" disc is a selection of Wilson demos that includes several tracks that were not recorded for the final \\"Signify\\" album, as well as formative versions of some that were. Label - Snapper Music.<br /><br />COMMENTS: This was my first disc from Porcupine Tree. I like it a ton, but it's definitely not my favorite (favorites include \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Stupid Dream\\", Lightbulb Sun\\" and \\"Deadwing\\"), but absolutely essential in their catalog of must-have albums. Some great songs here... the best in my opinion are the \\"Sleep Of No Dreaming\\" (dark, moody, wonderful), the opening jam \\"Signify\\", \\"Waiting Phase 1\\" followed by the instrumental \\"Waiting Phase 2\\", and the 8 minute album closer \\"Dark Matter\\". More than other recent Tree albums, \\"Signify\\" features many (6) instrumentals. Some being minute-and-a-half synthesizer experiments, while others being full blown 6-7 minute jams... the best being \\"Intermediate Jesus\\", \\"Idiot Prayer\\" and the title track. The soft acoustic \\"Every Home Is Wired\\" is a gem of a song too (with futuristic words from Wilson about the home PC). The bonus disc is a nice addition.

And, the two best songs with vocals being \\"Wake As Gun I\\" and \\"Sever Tomorrow\\". This disc made me go out and buy the rest of their material... several years ago, this turned out to be a great discovery for me - since 2002 Porcupine Tree has been my favorite band.

B000G759LW|4.0|\\"Back To Basics\\" is a very good album. I was very impressed with the songs and the subjects of the songs. It seemed the majority of the songs focused on finding the right man and the album even includes a song called \\"The Right Man\\". It's not a crime that a lot of her songs are inspired by her new hubby. It's just really obvious. I think my only confusion is over the second disc which I understood to be a \\"retro disc\\". It only has a few songs that emulate the 40's style that influences the album. It actually seemed Disc 1 is more urban, hip hop, and dance-able. Disc 2 is a little more mellow. The single \\"Ain't No Other Man\\" seems to get better everytime I listen to it. But out of all the songs \\"Hurt\\" is the one that echoes in my brain. A beautiful ballad that I suspect will be a single soon. It's just that good. Overall, it's a very ambitious album with some well written tracks and of course the distinctive voice of Aguilera. There's a reason why she's one of the most emulated artists in the American Idol auditions.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it, and every time I catch it on TV I have to sit down and watch it. I don't know how many times I've seen it, and it still scares the hell out of me. I love love love it.

B0002CHIJW|3.0|Typical revenge horror movie with some unusual visuals. It starts of with a slow burn but once the gang rape begins that's when the horror begins. I am amazed Camille Keaton portrayed that role. She was completely naked throughout the attack. I know it's acting but that must have taken a lot of preparation and trust in her costars. The revenge portion of the film is pretty shocking too. And that bathtub scene will haunt me forever. That was brutal. Very similar to \\"House On The Left\\" I agree that the subject matter and the way it is portrayed is graphic. But it's a reflection of reality. Women are abused everyday and rarely get the chance to exact justice. It was nice to see a woman get control of the situation. Not that I condone that kind of violent retribution....but it was satisfying to see the bad guys get theirs. Definitely not recommended for the kiddies.

B00005U122|5.0|Prior to purchasing this DVD, I had been looking for a good live Floyd product since I never saw the band live.  I read the reviews on the other Floyd and Gilmore DVD's and decided not to ingore their warnings.  This one appeared to have the most favorable feedback.  The production does not disappoint.  Roger proves that he can continue to deliver without the rest of the boys.  His team in this footage pulls it all together.  The concert is so good that I play it to listen even if I'm working on something else that doesn't allow me to watch. If anyone comes across another product with Gilmore, Mason, etc... that compares, please let me know as I would like to see it.
B00005JP0A|4.0|This was a funny movie. I liked the story and the characters. Of course Meryl Streep steals every scene she's in. Anne Hathaway wasn't too annoying as the central character. I enjoyed rooting for her especially when she starts taking her new job seriously. I also liked Stanley Tucci who helps \\"Andrea\\" get her style makeover. Great movie with some nice life lessons to boot. <br /> <br />The only gripe I had is with the way Andrea is treated by her friends. I felt they were unsupportive. The boyfriend was selfish and whiny. Andrea wanted to be a success. That's part of the reason why people go to college: so they can be successful in a career. And Andrea was doing really well. Yes, she was extremely busy but that was her job. The boyfriend should have been much more understanding. I mean, he gets a new job and Andrea is supposed to be all happy for him while she apologizes for living it up a little. That's where the moral gets a little distorted. I say follow your dreams and make it big when the opportunity hits. If your friends don't support you as in Andrea's case....get new friends. Otherwise, really good movie.
0553804677|5.0|A lot was expected of Scott Lynch's debut novel.  There was a buzz around the 'net abuot it, from the story of how he was signed, to his multi-book deal to the Hollywood connection.  For the most part, this book lives up to the promise. Lynch clearly has a good command of language and a fantastic ear for dialogue, and his breezy style is a joy to read.  The action and plot twists come thick and fast, making the book a good, old-fashioned \\"page-turner\\".  The central characters are well-drawn, more than mere caricatures and one is easily drawn into their lives and their rich, nuanced world. <br /> <br />All of this pales in significance before this fact: the book is a heckuva lot of fun to read.  Go forth and enjoy!

B000G759LW|4.0|For the money, this is a great a deal for two discs. At first I thought I liked disc one better than two, but then I realized that it's just too much music to try to listen to in one sitting. You sort of get over it by disc two. But there is no denying Ms. Aguilera's talent and you definitely have to admire the guts it took to put something so different out. I love how she put her ex-collaborator Scott Storch on blast with F.U.S.S.-which according to the internet rumor mill it stand s for (expletive)U Scott Storch-who refused to work with her because she wouldn't spare additional 20k for a private plane on top of his $3 million production fee. They agreed to the fee but not the plane and he threw a Hollywood fit. Interesting.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good CD with good music. It's good to see an artist growing as oppose to sticking to the same old schlick. Looks like she's the real graduate from the school of Madonna.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I may mock I make fun of but in the end i enjoyed watching this movie, over and over again.  It is one of those films that allow for the corny one liners and yet a lighter side to some serious events.  The romantic side of this movie for me is unforgettable, as is the music.
1400032717|5.0|I got this at Borders as the \\"freebie\\" in their 3 for 2 promotion.  I had no intention of buying this book when I went in there, but I'm thrilled I did. <br /> <br />Having met several autistic children who have different types of autism (not the same type the main character in the book has), I was enthralled by the thought process.  Whether it is 100% the way an autistic child actually thinks or not is irrelevant because the way this book was written is so unique. <br /> <br />At times, I felt like it could have been written by Vonnegut as there are little jabs at scoial behavior.  Also, the schizophrenic nature at times (think Slaughterhouse Five) made me draw some comparisons.  While it is not on the same level as Vonnegut's works, this book is extremely unique and, being only 200 pages in length, a quick and enjoyable read as well.
0596101996|5.0|First off, this is a review of the 5th edition, released August 1, 2006. All other reviews prior to that date are talking about previous editions of this book, which are considerably different than the current one.<br /><br />The reason the various editions of this book have been so good over the last ten years is probably because they have all been written by the same author, David Flanagan, who seems to really know his audience. Part one of the book is pretty much the same as in the previous edition. It acts as a complete tutorial on the language, taking you all the way from basic language constructs into object-oriented programming and finally basic scripting.<br /><br />Where things get really interesting and cutting edge is in part two of the book, \\"Client-Side Javascript\\". Most of the examples we've seen so far, while legal JavaScript code, had no particular context - they were JavaScript fragments that ran in no specified environment. Chapters 13 and 14, \\"Javascript in Web Browsers\\", and \\"Scripting Browser Windows\\" provide that context. This begins with a conceptual introduction to the web browser programming environment and basic client-side JavaScript concepts. Next, it discusses how to  embed JavaScript code within HTML documents so it can run in a web browser. Finally, the chapter goes into detail about how JavaScript programs are executed in a web browser.<br /><br />Next, the book turns its attention to the Document Object Model (DOM). Client-side JavaScript exists to turn static HTML documents into interactive programs. It is the Document object that gives JavaScript interactive access to the content of otherwise static documents. In addition to the properties that provide information about a document as a whole, the Document object has a number of very important properties that provide information about document content. Chapter 15 explains all of these issues.<br /><br />Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a technology intended for use by graphic designers or anyone concerned with the precise visual display of HTML documents. It is of interest to client-side JavaScript programmers because the document object model allows the styles that are applied to the individual elements of a document to be scripted. Used together, CSS and JavaScript enable a variety of visual effects loosely referred to as Dynamic HTML (DHTML). This is the subject of chapter 16, \\"Cascading Style Sheets and Dynamic HTML\\".<br /><br />Interactive JavaScript programs use an event-driven programming model. In this style of programming, the web browser generates an event whenever something interesting happens to the document or to some element of it. For example, the web browser generates an event when it finishes loading a document, when the user moves the mouse over a hyperlink, or when the user clicks on the Submit button of a form. If a JavaScript application cares about a particular type of event for a particular document element, it can register an event handler - a JavaScript function or snippet of code - for that type of event on the element of interest. Then, when that particular event occurs, the browser invokes the handler code. All applications with graphical user interfaces are designed this way: they sit around waiting for the user to do something interesting (i.e., they wait for events to occur) and then they respond. Chapter 17, \\"Events and Event Handling\\", discusses these issues.<br /><br />The use of HTML forms is basic to almost all JavaScript programs. Chapter 18, \\"Forms and Form Elements\\", explains the details of programming with forms in JavaScript. It is assumed that you are already somewhat familiar with the creation of HTML forms and with the input elements that they contain. If not, you may want to refer to a good book on HTML.<br /><br />The Document object contains a property named \\"cookie\\" that, on the surface, appears to be a simple string value. A cookie is a small amount of named data stored by the web browser and associated with a particular web page or web site. Cookies serve to give the web browser a memory, so that scripts and server-side programs can use data that was input on one page in another page, or so the browser can recall user preferences or other state variables when the user leaves a page and then returns. Thus, the cookie property controls a very important feature of the web browser and is important enough to warrant a complete chapter of its own, \\"Cookies and Client-Side Persistence\\".<br /><br />Internet Explorer on Windows, Safari on Mac OS-X, Mozilla on all platforms, Konqueror in KDE, IceBrowser on Java, and Opera on all platforms provide a method for client side Javascript to make HTTP requests. From humble beginnings as an oddly named object with few admirers, it's blossomed to be the core technology in something called AJAX. The object in question is called the XMLHTTPRequest object, and it is not limited to being used with XML. It can request or send any type of document, although dealing with binary streams can be problematical in Javascript. This chapter, \\"Scripting HTTP\\", covers these issues. Since AJAX actually stands for \\"Asynchronous Javascript and XML\\", the next chapter discusses Javascript and XML working together.<br /><br />The final two chapters of part two of the book are very cool and interesting to me, but might not be of interest to the standard professional Javascript programmer, since it deals with client-side graphics and movies using Javascript. This includes working with VML, SVG, graphics and Java, and finally using Javascript with Flash 8. Parts three and four form a reference section for Javascript, including the various methods and their usages.<br /><br />The source code is well commented and explained, as in all previous editions, and is available for download from the book's website. This book is a great instructive textbook and reference on Javascript. I highly recommend it.eb browser and associated with a particular web page or web site.

B000E41MRC|5.0|Sometimes bad-tasting medicine is good for you. Here's some good flavored stuff. Anyone who wonders how the 'cultured' Germans could have spawned a regime of Evil will find some of the answer in this film. This superbly restored edition conveys the sense of power and purpose that the Party rallies intended to convey. Ms. Reifenstahl, a gifted if amoral enabler, crafted a brilliant and finely organized propoganda. The camera work is disturbingly effective in drawing the viewer into the event. One experiences the guilty pleasure of seeing something enjoyably bad,  like, well, pornography. The happy, attractive faces of the participants, full of hope, are haunting, because they have no idea that they will soon be responsible for destroying most of Europe and Russia, and the near extinction of entire races of people: the Jews, the gypsies, the mentally handicapped.   Students of history will know that the hope contrasts with the violent and melancholy turmoil of Germany after defeat in the Great War and the economic collapse of the twenties. Many, perhaps most of the on-screen participants shared the mistrust or even dislike of Jewish folks and Communists but few could have imagined the horror intended by their idolized featured speaker.   History will argue whether the War was the result of his miscalculation but it is unarguable that the deaths of almost 60 million people followed the decisions taken by the charismatic star of this show. Thank God there is no sequel.
B00005JOML|4.0|It's no secret that Michael Mann's film adaptation of his time capsule-cool TV show \\"Miami Vice\\" was a troubled production (hurricanes, cutting deals with drug lords and gangsters will do that to a movie). It's also been no secret that the advance screenings generated all the buzz of a chainsaw underwater. But now, opening for the viewingpublic, how does Miami Vice (Universal Pictures) in the 21st century REELY fare?<br /><br />Opening to a Jiggaman remix inside the energy and vitality of a South Beach club, Miami Vice introduces us to Miami-Dade County undercover cops Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo \\"Rico\\" Tubbs (Jaime Foxx) on the job. They're pulled off a prostitution ring sting and into an FBI investigation when one of their snitches informs them that the feds have been compromised. Due to their skill level and outsider status, Crockett and Tubbs go deep cover as expert drug traffickers, in order to set up Colombian drug lord Montoya (Luis Tosar), a dealer so successful and vertically integrated, he could have a ticker number on the New York Stock Exchange. As Crockett falls for Montoya's beautiful and invaluable Chinese-Cuban mistress Isabella (Gong Li), both he and Tubbs risk what semblance of real life they have for this boundary-blurring job.<br /><br />A question comes to mind while watching two \\"go-fast\\" boats slice through ocean waves against a scary cool Miami backdrop in the dead of night: \\"Just how did a sixtysomething Man(n), who cut his teeth on TV in the '80s, become the arbiter of cool?\\" From the Ozwald Boateng suits to the $100,000 sports cars and beyond, Miami Vice is an adrenaline boost of pure style. Fast cars, slow love, hot women, cool attitudes...Mann and production designer Victor Kempster create a visual eye candy bar for the stylish.<br /><br />In Michael Mann's agreeably and realistically multi-ethnic, multi-national world, I'd dare say Miami's never looked sexier, even with all the color drained out. Matching the serious tone of the lingo-laced Mann script, Vice puts to good use the night-black digital cinematography system he perfected while filming Collateral. The dark tone is justified, merely from the script's shady entanglement of white supremacists, Dominicans, Colombians, Cubans, even a Chinese-Cuban - all criminals, all of whom don't trust each other in a world where anyone can be bought for the right price (just depends on what kinda currency you're using). They speak with such casual knowledge of this ice cold world, they've inented their own language of frostbite, so much so you can almost catch freezer burn just watching. On top of all that, there is an INTENSE stand-off scene that's so frigid and fraught with emotional stakes, you kind of marvel slack-jawed at its violently elegant beauty-that rare violent film that is not gratuitous.<br /><br />If there is any arena that suffers just a bit from over-chill, it might be the acting. The casting is great; what two better ambassadors of gritty, visceral excitement than the hard-livin' Colin Farrell and the hard-partying Jamie Foxx? With such a grave, dire tone all the time, Vice could use just a dollop of humor on occasion just for variety's sake; you can't know real drama without a touch of comedy-not to ingratiate itself to the diehard fans of the oft-times cheesy '80s TV hit, but just to give the viewer a dramatic intermission. As a result, you have Foxx squinting a lot at greasy, handlebar mustachioed Farrell, professing his utmost trust and faith in him without any real scenes in Act One or early Two to show us an example of this. Naomie Harris is fairly convincing with her Noo Yawk accented cop Trudy while Gong Li excels as the dramatic and emotional monkey wrench in Crockett's best laid plans. Does her English suck? Absolutely. But when you look that good, who gives a damn? Li is able to hold men's attention and sway their allegiances with a single, blankly desirous look; she's nothing short of mesmerizing.<br /><br />Sexy, complicated, stylish, and Sub-Zero frosty, Miami Vice is an excellent police story procedural, like the country cousin to HBO's The Wire. But it's so much more. When the stakes get raised so immeasurably late in the second act that this goes from high-sheen Arctic lip gloss to something real and arrestingly dramatic, operatic almost, that's when it's time to take a trip down to South Beach-refrigerator-fresh Vice style.<br /> <br />Sexy, complicated, stylish, and Sub-Zero frosty, Miami Vice is an excellent police story procedural, like the country cousin to HBO's The Wire.

B000BTC5LW|3.0|This DVD will not disappoint.  I only wish that Roger Waters was still with them so I don't have to double up on my purchases because the split took incredible talent in two different directions.  Waters and Gilmour both took talent with them and they could only be better if they were together.  I am still holding out for a reunion.  The quality of this production is so much better than my VHS.  If you don't have this in your collection you should have your classic rock organ removed from your body.
B000BM6AVA|5.0|Sound: The short story, System Of A Down have written one of the best of records of their career, of the year, and of the decade. Hypnotize is the perfect blend of blazing screaming crazyness that was very present in their self-titled effort and Toxicity, and the more safisticated blazing screaming crazyness that was Mezmerize. Anyone who had doubts of a band selling out when Daron Malakian started singing will have their doubts thrown right back at them. System Of A Down managed to blend both Daron and Serj voices perfectly into these group of songs, while perfectly mishmashing guitar crunching with well organized riffs. There's not much more to it. This is the perfect combination of what System Of A Down does best. // 10<br /><br />Lyrics: Lyrically Hypnotize shines. Perfectly blended with very heavy symbolic messages and flat out screaming and noises, and no matter which on of the two it is, or somewhere in between, it will get your attention, and bury somewhere deep in your head. The riffs and lyrics will stick to you, a gift System of a Down has mastered, undoubtly a huge part of their massive success over the last couple of years. Hypnotize also sees the horizon broaden lyrically for System Of A Down. They tackle issues such as War, of course, with songs like Soldier Side, the continuation of the intro from Mezmerize, which sees the songs taken to epic proportions, one of the biggest sounding songs System has ever done. Not to mention the songs that are just down right crazy, like Kill Rock n' Roll or Vicinity Of Obcenity, but System of a Down wouldn't be System Of A Down if they didn't load it full of symbolism. The one big surprise comes in Lonely Day, the only really personal song System Of A Down has really done, with lyrics like \\"If you go, I wanna go with you, and if you die, I wanna die with you\\" really touch a nerve that System hasn't explored before, and they do it amazingly well. // 10<br /><br />Impression: It is no doubt that Hypnotize will outsell anything System of A Down has ever done, and it should. Mezmerize blazed the trail for this albums much anticipated release, and System deserve any praise that this album gets. They perfectly tweeked a sound that has driven them to the top, mixing what their self titled album and Toxicity did for them to be the one of the most respected bands in metal, and what Mezmerize has done for them to be one of the most respected band in music today. // 10sell anything System of A Down has ever done, and it should.

Pollan takes you with him while he discovers what exactly is going on in our supermarkets.  I was shocked at how I had developed blind trust in what I was ingesting and if you take anything away from this book, it should be the attention put on industrial farming and the problems it is causing with personal, economical and enviromental health.

B000E33VWW|5.0|I'd read IN COLD BLOOD years ago and also saw the stark black-and-white film (with Robert Blake as a killer!).  I laughed at Truman Capote's very funny cameo in Neil Simon's comedy, MURDER BY DEATH, and always liked Rich Little's impersonations of him back then.<br /><br />But I had no idea how dramatic the backstory was for his writing and how compelling of a movie it would make.<br /><br />Phillips Seymour Hoffman deserved the Oscar for Best Actor, despite the bitter cries of the BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN faction.  Hoffman does so much more than just mimic Capote (he does the voice awesome, though!).  He completely fleshes out the unseen narrator of the novel, becoming a fascinating character himself.  As Capote draws out and manipulates the killer for his story, I couldn't help but think that this was a twist on the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS set-up: the more incisive evil was outside the bars and looking in this time.  I'm joking...but you can see how far Capote was willing to go to get his story, and the toll it took on the rest of his life.<br /><br />The extras are also interesting.  For those too young to remember Capote, there's a segment of an interview so you'll get to see that Hoffman wasn't a caricature--that was his voice!<br /><br />The entire cast is great, from Catherine Kenner to Chris Cooper to all the Winnipeg locals the filmmakers used in crowd scenes.  Beautifully photographed with Canada standing in for Kansas, CAPOTE is a wonderful film about a dark crime and a great literary event.

B000GGSM94|5.0|In my assessment the album where it all finally came together for the Cure, \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" is a triumph-- a double album of startling diversity and quality.  While it's best known for it's pop singles (particularly \\"Just Like Heaven\\"), there's quite a bit more that this album has to offer. <br /> <br />Noneteless, I'll start by talking about the pop songs-- on \\"The Head on the Door\\", rhythm section Simon Gallup (bass) and Boris Williams (drums) provided a deep, pop groove over which textures could be arranged by leader/vocalist/guitarist Robert Smith and guitarist Porl Thomspon (both, as well as Lol Tolhurst, also contributed keyboard performances to the album).  And \\"Just Like Heaven\\" is the best example of this-- a great beat, a nice, bright bassline hinting at funk, shimmering acoustic guitars, descending keyboard motifs, and a great electric lead guitar hook open the way for Smith's positively ecstatic vocal.  It's no surprise it's a hit, it deserves to be, it's a great song.  As nice as it is though, it's really overshadowed by the bouncy \\"Why Can't I Be You?\\"-- driven by a horn arrangement that in other hands could have been tacky, the piece is filled with energy over a frantic acoustic guitar riff and a superbly bizarre vocal by Smith. <br /> <br />But pop is really only one side of this, this is a band known as a goth band, and opener \\"The Kiss\\" reminds us why.  Throbbing bass, fierce lead guitars, and an extended opening lead into a vocal assault by Smith among the most potent and confident he's done.  Also of note in this vein is morbid droning piece \\"The Snakepit\\", with Smith's carefully half-spoken vocal providing a dramatic atmosphere.  Again though, the Cure isn't a band just about goth and pop, tackling cooled off '60s psychedelia (\\"The Catch\\"), deep funk (the absolutely fantastic \\"Hot Hot Hot!!!\\"), world music tinged mood pieces (\\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\", \\"Like Cockatoos\\") and texture driven punk songs (\\"Icing Sugar\\") among others.And remarkably, nothing is subpar-- it's all fantastic stuff. <br /> <br />The deluxe edition only makes things better-- restoring \\"Hey You!\\" to the album (deleted from early CD issues due to length considerations on 74 minute CDs) and a second disc of demos, alternate mixes and live tracks.  This set of demos proves quite revealing not just to the creative process behind the pieces but the input of the rest of the band other than Robert Smith-- Smith's home demo of \\"The Kiss\\" illustrates this nicely-- it's a synth heavy number that benefitted drastically from Thompson's more aggressive guitar stylings.  The live tracks are a big add, sonically they are superb (best of anything released so far on the deluxe edition) and the performances are great.  The entire package has been remastered and sounds a lot better than the previous CD issue. <br /> <br />\\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\" doesn't get quite the acclaim that \\"Disintegration\\" or \\"Wish\\" gets, but I've always found it to be the stronger album, managing to be both accessible and obscure.  Highly recommended.
B00005LQ04|4.0|\\"Suspiria\\" is Italian director Dario Argento's most renowned movie for his career.<br /><br />It follows the classic vintage horror genre of mood and setting in the likes of the Val Lewton/Jacques Tourneur collaborations, a gory cousin of Tourneur's \\"the Curse of the Demon.\\"  It has a very interesting use of atmosphere and deliberately alienating visual patterns which are broken by puffs of blood.<br /><br />No one gets killed in this movie with a chainsaw because that would be uninteresting; to stab to death a fairly young and pretty woman in her nightgown on a checkerboard tile floor, in front of designer wallpaper and richly lavish decor, then hang her pretty corpse in the middle of the room, is different.  It says, \\"This a beautiful place.\\"  Then it says, \\"This is a beautiful girl.\\"  Then, it says, \\"This is a beautiful murder,\\" like it's perfecting a climax.<br /><br />It has a lot of story build-up and suspense by the way of ambience and bloomingly vivid colors that contrast loudly on purpose.  The movie is about the night, the wind, the rainstorm, the house, and the se'ance, like Disney's \\"Snow White.\\"<br /><br />That movie might actually be a good description for mood comparison of \\"Suspiria\\" since they both have mystical and fantastic selves, although there are more killings here.  It is, itself, a fairy tale.  If you watch it, watch it to the end.  \\"Suspiria\\" is Hitchcockian through subtlety, fine texture, and well-crafted artistry.<br /><br />I only found the abstract electronic rock music contrived and it annoyed me during the film.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The original release of this movie should be destroyed. It was shredded into incoherant bits in some parts. Just the first 15 mins. of the DC divulges many important facts and wonderful scenes. If you saw this in the movies, forget what you saw and buy this version.  This reminds me somewhat of \\"Return Of The King\\". The longer dvd version was like watching a different movie. While this is not as good as Jacksons trilogy work it shows what proper editing and un-abused story telling can do for a movie.  Give it a try!!!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Prior to Dirty Dancing, I've only seen Patrick in Red Dawn and Uncommon Valor where I found his acting marginal at best and his look somewhat common.  I had no intention of seeing this movie when, as a teen, my mom dragged me kicking and screaming to the movie theatre.  After Johnny and Penny danced their mambo together I was hooked and have loved him ever since.  He was simply to die for! There is just something so sensually mouthwatering about a man trained in dance and who would have though Patrick Swayze could dance or act?  Yes he does do a decent job acting in this movie.  Turns out he's been doing the wrong type of films.  Its too bad he hasn't done more dancing/romantic lead acting, as it seems to fit his brooding demeanor and look very well. <br /> <br />Simply one of the best movies out there.  Great theme, great look, great dancing, great music, not to mention one of the most beautiful, tender love stories on film.  Don't believe me?  Watch the movie again very carefully.  Watch how Johnny carasses Baby and how he looks at her, not only during the love scenes.  It seemed that he loved her so much it hurt.  The chemistry between the two was so perfect.  I won't even start on the seduction dance, especially the \\"penetration\\" scene.  I admit this movie sparked a 20 year fantasy of dancing the Mambo with Patrick.  Of course he'd have to teach me first. <br /> <br />Its very obvious that a lot of love went into the making of this film and it looked beautiful for such a constrained budget.  I thank the producer for never giving up on the project, for the actors, the dancers and everyone else involved.  Thanks for giving us the time of our lives. <br />
0800141849|5.0|This movie is perfect for romantics everywhere and offers a very inspirational boost to women and men everywhere who feel that Mr. or Mrs. Right is out of their reach.     I think the character that Jeff Bridges played was marvelous. If you look at it closely you can see that he's a good looking man, but the women that he's previously dated often find him too dull. However, the moment he realizes that sex is the problem in all of his relationships and he moves it to the back burner (as crazy as that may be) it leads him to the right woman.     I think there's a really good message in there for people in reality.  His character's ideas were a bit over-the-top but if they were toned down a little, you can see that the moment he didn't put as much emphasis on looks and sex... he met Mrs. Right. That could easily be useful to people in real-life in helping them realize that maybe they are putting too much emphasis on the wrong thing and they may want to check out how they view things to see if they are trying to have their cake and eat it too.    Pretty much what Rose and Gregory had was a courtship in modern time, which can often be a better alternative to dating and can lead a lot of people to the right person (without the risk of sounding too preachy).    I also watched the movie and saw that Gregory was a very good man. He appreciated the right things when it came to Rose. He was a good looking man but he was the type of man that a lot of women would appreciate. The only problem with the women he was dating before he met Rose was that they were too beautiful and selfish to appreciate what a good man he was. Though I'm quite sure it would've been possible to meet beautiful women that weren't selfish... though often it just happened that the women in his league (looks-wise) were just not the type of women to appreciate him.    They were spoiled and had too many options and idolized their own beauty far too much (like Rose's mother--played by Lauren Becall). And of course when you watch the movie... you can get a good look at how women with that attitude can often end up if they aren't careful (by paying attention to Rose's mother's feelings, life, and how she always has to have a compliment about her looks). Women like that are enslaved by their own spoils and priviledges... but eventually that fades with age. And you can see how they try and hold on to it--too afraid to let go. When you watch the movie it will also be easy to see that Rose's sister Claire was also following in her mother's footsteps. Scared to death of not being beautiful anymore and living each moment and weighing it against the attention she received from men. It's quite a sad outlook.    Really I think there's a lot of lessons to learn in this movie and I'm surprised it's criticized by some people. I find the movie utterly beautiful and charming. It's hard to find wonderful men and women in this world these days and to see a wonderful example of one in a movie is very nice. :)    And the thing with someone boring like Gregory is that if they meet the right person, that can be changed. When you meet the right person and they accept you for who you are (like Rose did with him) it's only a matter of time before things like that change for the better if it's the right relationship, because two people who come together like that challenge one another and help one another open up and grow in the right direction. For instance, Gregory says on a dinner date with Rose that he finds dancing rather embarrassing, however at the end if you watch the credits... you'll see that Rose helped him change in that area.     As for Barbara Streisand, reviewers have said that she was using the film as a way to state how beautiful she was and to show off her talents. Well, I disagree with that way of seeing things. I think that's projecting one's biased attitude onto Barbara Streisand.    Just because she chooses to use her talents to create something good doesn't mean she should be ridiculed for it. The reason talents are created is so that we can use them. Now it would just be silly for her to know she can do something great with a project like that and be too afraid to use her talents. It's rather blind to automatically think she's trying to prove something to everyone when it could just easily be Barbara wanting to do something for herself and because she has the skills in general to do it.     This is my personal opinion now, but I don't think Barbara was trying to brag or tell the world she was beautiful at all. What I saw was a woman (Barbara Streisand) who knows that she's not \\"conventionally\\" or \\"typically\\" beautiful in the usual way using her known physical faults to show and prove to other women that they don't have to be typical or conventionally beautiful to be beautiful to themselves or others.    I thinks it's a bit narrow-minded to automatically assume she's trying to prove anything to anyone (\\"the world\\" per se) that she's beautiful. It's just quite possible that she's trying to use her God-given talents to achieve something she believes in. I could be wrong but I don't think she's losing sleep at night worrying about or trying to prove her beauty status to the world as reviewers have said. She seems much too strong of a woman for that, if you ask me.    There were a few points in the movie in which I thought eating carrots/veggies (when she was trying to lose weight) and her metamorphasis as a beautiful woman was a bit over-the-top, but that's my opinion on the movie itself. I think they could've eased up on that message just a little and made it a bit less superficial but it's minor and it's entertainments. It's not going to be perfect. It's just a movie and you can sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride and the delightful ending that it entails.    Perfect romance through and through. :)
B0001HLVSC|5.0|Excellent movie, good acting, etc.  Leaves you on the edge of your seat.  The price for this by Amazon was great.
B000009DUY|5.0|Another awesome score by John Williams. All of the patriotic orchestral music from the movie itself is in this soundtrack. Outstanding brass and strings.
B00003CXAY|3.0|I bought the combo pack because it was about the same price as just getting Koyaanisqatsi alone, and since Powaqqatsi was the second of three in a series, according to the literature, and I remembered really liking the first back in the 80s, I figured it was worth a look.<br /><br />It really didn't do it for me as much as Koyaanisqatsi, but to each his own. The video quality was better in many regards, however, since, I assume, there was a bigger budget for the second film... Frankly, I was also much more into all the scenery and what was done with it in the first film, not so much with the people pictures in the second, but for the combo price, I guess it's worth it over buying just the one.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|I saw this film when I was 16 as it was a recent release. That was around 1966 or so. It influenced me so much that I followed the career yearnings I gained from it and after two college degress in Photography ( B.F.A., M.A.) I opened my studio in 1971. I have had a great career traveling the world producing images for a whole range of clients.<br /><br />The mystery of the murder and the end of the movie really tell the story of photography. You can see it, but you must live the experience of involvement to understand. I will forever appreciate this film. It was a directional moment at first sight.

1576751988|4.0|Much of it you already know but sometimes you need some reminding. This book is easy to read, to the point and not inflated with boring repetition like others of it's kind.
0307276902|4.0|My friend asked me when I was finished reading the book, \\"regardless it's fiction or memoir, would you have found the story any less interesting?\\"  The answer is no. It doesn't matter if it's fact, fiction or a mixture of the two. The story is compelling.<br /><br />The reality of addiction as told through Frey's eyes is jarring. His writing style is fractured, yet focused - and serves as the perfect delivery given the subject matter; and, we find, a genuine reflection of the author's personality.  I gleaned from this book a deeper understanding of the recovery process and the powerful internal struggle every addict must endure in order to survive.
B000E8NRR6|5.0|Wow. The first time I listened to this album I found it 'nice'.  There is a lot of \\"Nightfly\\" and \\"Dan\\" flavor on this album and since your brain is hotwired with so many classic riffs of their classic songs, at first you try to fight the music since this album is all new.  That being said after I listened a couple of more times I realised that there is greater depth to his music than ever before and I started to get more and more into it. <br /> <br />Once into it you realize that this is truly an amazing work of art and it gets better and better every time you listen to it.  The phrasing and harmonies and lyrics and chord structures are so  fresh it really gets under your skin.  I have this on my ipod and am listening over and over. <br /> <br />Another reviewer said that they couldn't understand the backing vocals.  If you can't hear them then you have a bad cd player or a compressed ipod version of the music.  Since the songs are densely packed with instruments and harmonies, only a better than bottom of the line cd player will allow you to hear the nuances.  I ripped the cd into ipod format using EAC (exact audio copy) to get a very very hi-fidelity copy. <br /> <br />I'm sure with a dvd-a player you would get an even better sound.
B000002P2V|4.0|\\"Who are You\\" is kind of a perplexing album. Though expertly produced by Glyn Johns, it sounds like the work of an uncomfortable band groping for a new musical and lyrical direction-- and not really coming up with anything. Scanning track titles such as \\"New Song,\\" \\"Guitar and Pen,\\" \\"Sister Disco,\\" and \\"Music Must Change\\" suggests a focus on musical innovation that the band doesn't deliver. Pete Townshend's guitar and synth parts sometimes seem to spar awkwardly with each other, instead of meshing into the streamlined and powerful attack he perfected on \\"Who's Next\\" and \\"Quadrophenia.\\" Keith Moon's final studio performance, while still retaining his inimitable style, has a somewhat deflated air to it. John Entwistle contributes fully a third of the songs, highlighted by the thrashing \\"Trick of the Light,\\" but his misanthropic \\"Had Enough\\" dampens the album's momentum early on. Roger Daltrey sounds typically powerful throughout, his fierce vocal performances breathing life into \\"Guitar and Pen\\" and \\"Music Must Change\\" especially.<br /><br />\\"New Song\\" sarcastically (or not?) describes an aging rock musician writing \\"the same old song\\" over and over, and you have to wonder, did Townshend mean it as an attack on his own band? Music must change, indeed. While punk and new wave were busy doing just that, the Who essentially stuck to the same old prog-flavored hard rock. There's still a lot of enjoyable material on this album, and of course, the roaring title track redeems much of the ponderousness of what precedes it. But as a listener, you can't help but share in the confusion and doubt the band must have been feeling at this chapter in their history.
1400079179|3.0|Older novels seek to develop depth and substance in the characters in the books.  Consider the works of Charles Dickens. His characters are full of life and substance.  As you read, you are drawn into the issues of the novel and experience them for yourself.  You have to think and contemplate. Reading an older novel is an educational experience.<br /><br />Not so with Brown's \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\"  Like much of the newer genre of novel writing, Brown builds interest in his work through mystery and action.  That can be entertaining and fun, but the educational value is limited.  You may \\"experience\\" the drama with the characters in a newer novel, the action, excitement and violence, but you aren't stirred deeply inside beyond the thrill of the moment.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading The Da Vinci Code, but was disappointed with historical inaccuracies, theological inaccuracies, and the constant barrage against the Catholic Church (and I'm not Catholic).  A great irony concerning the secret societies in the church is that in \\"real life,\\" most of the secret societies that work ill will against church and society work outside of any church.<br /><br />Another great irony is the concern for the \\"bloodline\\" of Jesus.  The Pharisees in Jesus day laid great stress upon bloodlines.  \\"We know who we are descended from - Abraham.\\"  Jesus changed the stress from bloodline to that of the Spirit.  Could we search as diligently for the \\"Spirit\\" of Christ, that Spirit which led him to give his life as a ransom for many?<br /><br />One character, Teabing, sees our current cultural shift as being away from the thought control and dominance of religions telling us how to live.  Now, we are moving into a new age, \\"the Age of Aquarius - the water bearer - whose ideals claim that man will learn the truth and be able to think for himself.\\" (P.289-90).  Many today are abandoning our 2,000 year religious heritage rooted in Christ, including his ethic of personal integrity and service.  Is society any better for that abandonment?  We'll see!s society any better for that abandonment?  We'll see!

B000FFJ85I|5.0|I would like to say first of all that I enjoy listening to AFI's new stuff. I first heard of AFI when they released \\"Girl's not grey\\" about 3 years ago. I immediately went out and bought \\"Sing the Sorrow\\". I gave STS a listen and was put off and disappointed,  but then for some reason I kept listening and eventually it just burrowed itself into my head. Well needless to say I looked for every album that AFI had ever recorded and I have been an AFI lover ever since. Fast forward to \\"decemberunderground\\" anticipated release, well as you all can imagine I was a nervous wreck waiting for the album to drop. When the day finally arrived I sat in my chair and gave the album my full and undivided attention. The boys did it again as I knew they would, but this time their sound has progressed in a more esoteric way. AFI has always been shrouded in a kind of mysterious fog as far as lyrics go anyways and this album proves that point. The album gets 5 stars from me because I truly enjoy these guys and I hope to see them perform.I was scheduled to see them perform in San Antonio but that was around the time Davey got sick and the show was canceled.
1932100660|5.0|I went to an Ayurvedic physician at OSU for severe pain due to arthritis and degeneration of 3 discs in my neck.  I was also experiencing numbness,tingling and pain in my right arm.  My family physician had me on a prescription nsaid, and was looking at spinal surgery to relieve the numbness and pain in the right arm--I wasn't satisfied with any of these 'options'.  The first thing the doctor at OSU told me, was to completely eliminate all dairy products.  I did it, reluctantly so, because I too grew up thinking these were good for your body.  That was on July 6th--and I have been pain free since the first week--haven't needed anything at all for pain, have full mobility of my neck, AND the numbness and pain in my right arm have completely disappeared.   <br />The doctor provided me a copy of a professional review of The China Study, and also advised me I should eliminate almost all animal protein from my diet; particularly with my family history of hormone driven cancers.  My energy level is higher than it's ever been and I'm losing those stubborn last 5 pounds.  I went from looking at major spinal surgery to feeling energetic and pain-free, just by giving up dairy products!  The treatment won't make the pharmaceutical industry or the dairy industry happy, but it works!   <br />The author also grew up on a dairy farm--completely convinced of the health benefits of dairy products.  Needless to say, the overwhelming evidence to the contrary was a suprise to him.   <br />If you think you're giving up delicious, sumptuous meals by giving up animal products, you need to check out The Medterranean Vegan Kitchen, and Vegan With a Vengeance.  The recipes are delicious, quick, and use everyday ingredients.  Stay well!  If you keep doing the same ole thing, you'll get the same results.
B000E97Y6K|5.0|Peter Jackson strikes gold with this shocking and somewhat violent movie.Much in the tradition of the 1930's and 1970's versions,the film covers an eager filmmaker named Carl Denham looking for a girl to play a role in his latest movie.Soon,he runs into Ann Darrow,a homeless and out-of-work actress,and convinces her to come with him and his crew to a deserted island where the film is to be shot.After some slight boat trouble,the crew and cast crash-land on the island,where they are attacked by a tribe of savage villagers.Narrowly escaping,the natives steal Ann and take her back to the island.Soon,Carl,his friend Jack,and others cover ground on the island looking for her.They witness her being captured by a large monkey creature who takes her deep into the jungle.From there,the group encounters dinosaurs,giant insects,and killer monsters.Soon,Carl devises a plan to capture Kong,and convinces the crew to put him to sleep with some chloroform they have stashed on board.Kong is taken to New York and put on display,until he breaks loose,smashing and tearing the Big apple to bits,until a final encounter on the Empire state Building where he is savagely shot down by a number of airplanes.The film covers somewhere near 3 hours,but it's a joyride from start to finish.

0805076476|4.0|I love Chuck Palahniuk. I think he is brilliant, smart, witty, and, best of all, he speaks the scary truths about humanity that most people would rather bury. His writing style is truely unique and the phrases or words that he repeats are never annoying - he emphasizes them perfectly and is sure to bring up reoccuring themes throughout all of his books. He'll throw a line in from earlier in the novel, a powerful line. And it will bring the book full circle all over again.<br /><br />I did like &lt;u>Survivor&lt;/u> and &lt;u>Diary&lt;/u> better than &lt;u>Fight Club&lt;/u>, but it was still an awesome book. Palahniuk is so great, I promise myself to reread every one of his novels before I die.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|When I watched this 20 years ago I found it scary then and it still made my heart beat faster watching today. The scary part was when it was evident to most people that war was going to happen and people panicking. I had tears come to my eyes when the farmer had to force his wife to quit making the bed and get to the shelter. When she had to face what was happening the cry of despair from her is heartbreaking. To know that your life and your love ones life is essentially over in such a abominable way...   <br /> <br />Goggle September 26, 1986 and find out how close we came to nuclear war. I just came into Colorado that day for a new life here. So close to the end of the world it's chilling!  <br /> <br />We have different world today but we are not safe from this horrific ending. It would be another scenario but the same tragic results.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|....but I had to review this one. In my search to find another band like Nightwish, I stumbled onto this one. I didn't know which cd to pick so I picked the one with the cover that was most appealing to me (it sounds odd I'm sure, but it works everytime).<br /><br />The very first track on this album literally blew me away. I can't speak for their other cds, but this one is amazing. The music is strong and the vocals are strong. I haven't played a cd out this much since Evanescence's Fallen. I wish I found them sooner. I love Nightwish, but their music is missing an element that keeps their music from speaking to me on a complete level. And I found that missing piece in Within Temptation.

B00030590I|4.0|This is one of the most visually stunning hong kong cinema pieces. The action is top notch, and the story was great. The interesting thing about this film is how the plot unfolds from different interpretations or vignettes in the movie. Jet Li is excellent throughout. Ignore the \\"QUentin Tarentino\\" title over it, all he did was pay for the film to get over to the usa- He didnt have anything to do with the making of this magnificent film. It's rather annoying that he has to slap his name over it. Yet any unknowing moron will think he made this film. He did the same thing on HOSTEL He had his name all over the title as if he made the movie, when he was just the producer. That's akin as if the recent TITANIC film had \\"Rae Sanchini\\" name over the title!!! He didnt do anything with directing it.  All quentin=shameless name dropper tarentino aside, Hero is a MUST OWN if you are into hong Kong cinema and these types of movies.  <br />Not to mention, if you own a Huge screen tv, the movie alone is worth demoing to your friends. The cinematography is jaw dropping. Buy it!

For Velvet's fans, im going to rate this 3rd of Lou's solo efforts behind Transformer and Take No Prisoners.
1400079179|2.0|Let me see. This man Langdon is awakened after midnight, groggy, and he and a host of other characters go on a wild goose chase. It seems to last longer than five hours, unless all these places in Paris and England are all around the corner from one another. In the dead of night all the characters are so lucid, open-minded and intelligent. Well, I guess they are all night people. In some ways the plot is far-fetched, in other places it hangs together. Sometimes the brain stuff is fun (Newton's missing orb). The characters never really develop in themselves, never become three-dimensional. They are all talking and listening and learning machines. Maybe Sophie is a bit human. Even Langdon's whack on the head cannot keep him from once-again postulating, reminiscing and informing. Everyone is so darn intelligent and no one is tired!<br /><br />I am not even going to get into the stuff on the Catholic Church. Some rich non-Christians financed the hype that made this book and movie (thank you, hollywood) a tidal wave. Not because it is a good book, but because it tells credible lies about the Church. It has become fashionable to beat up on the Church for the past decade or so. And these non-Christians have the money to do it: on screen, in the newspapers, on the boob toob, all over the media. The serpent in the garden was named Dan Brown.<br /><br />In the end it is pulp fiction, with a bad intent.

055357342X|4.0|The third book of a series and follow the story line.  I have not finished it yet but am enjoying it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|This is such a strong album it really makes you feel as if you get to know Madonna more.  The theme here is one of confession and the realization that she now knows fame doesnt help you find yourself any faster or cure your problems.  Shes openly questioning organized religion and her faith in many things, even her place in the world.  Damn if it isnt very listenable, inventive, funky and fun.  Oh and the rapping?  Thats the sound of an artist not taking themselves too seriously.  Loved it.
B000089CJI|5.0|Give Up transcends the labels of Electronica and Indie, sure it helps to put it in a category but you don't have to be immersed in either one of these genres to appreciate this album, simply put... it's beautiful. Of course much has been said about this album already, but something that affects you to this degree compels you to speak out with your own words. While the general sound may not be considered entirely innovative by some, the power of this dynamic duo surely lies in their delivery.  <br /> <br />The heartfelt vocals and innocent, often childlike soundscapes, breakdown your defenses and before you know it, these songs burrow deep inside you becoming part of your life. Perhaps the reason it's so successful is that it feels genuinely honest, not sappy and over emotional, but truly and utterly \\"real\\".
0802130208|5.0|Who would think a book whose main character is an obnoxious, self deluded mama's boy would be so enthralling?  Once you get past the fact that Ignatius is possible the most difficult character to like in literature this is a great book.  The cast of characters seems to be unending.  From the patrolman who just can't cut a break and his crazy aunt to the cloud headed Jonesy to poor mama Reilly, everyone you meet has their own interesting and strange story to tell.   <br />Several plots develop together and all seem to center around our fat green hatted 'hero' who battles to see a King in America and to end indecency by introducing geometry and theology into life. <br />There is never a boring moment in this book, and you don't know who to root for as the antics stretch from 'civilized' New Orleans all the way to Ignatius' revolutionary x-girlfriend in New York who thinks all problems can be solved with sex. <br />This is a great fun book to relax with, I highly recommend it. <br />
B000EDWL82|5.0|Great music and lyrics.  The music is not only good to the ears, but makes you feel as well.
B000089CKH|5.0|Delivery was quickewr than expected although I live in a remote part of Italy. Also no surprises in payment and address info. Good work
B000053VAZ|5.0|I'M just becomming a Johnny Dep fan.  He is a remarkable talent. <br />I really enjoyed this not so typical boy meets girl movie.  It had great acting and music.  I would recommend it to any age.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Absolutley outstanding movie.  What chemistry these fabulous actors bring to a movie about them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As tempting as it is to bash FOX in yet another review of this wonderful DVD set, I'm going to demur and just say that \\"Firefly\\" will go down as one of those shooting stars that burned brightly but too briefly. Joss Whedon's space western introduced us to one of the most talented and compelling ensemble casts ever put together for a TV series, and while not every episode was briliant, the vast majority were thoughtful, humorous, suspenseful and - as usual for a Joss Whedon show - wonderfully written.  <br /> <br />This DVD set is a must-own for fans of literate science fiction (and open-minded fans of Westerns as well), and contains every episode that aired along with three that did not (one, entitled \\"Trash,\\" is among the most hilarious of the entire series). The themes of \\"Firefly\\" - family, loyalty, the search for a home that feels safe and the desire to live in freedom - are universal and resonate more than ever today. My fondest wish is the same as that expressed by one of the show's producers in the bonus feature about the making of the show. He ponders how wonderful it would be if someone at one of the networks saw the film \\"Serenity\\" (another must-own, by the way) and thought, \\"Hey, why don't we make a TV series out of this?\\" <br /> <br />At a time when so many mediocre (or worse) TV series seem able to stay on the air for years even though no one is watching, it's inconceivable to me that network execs think there's no place on television for a high-quality series like this. Bring back \\"Firefly\\"!
B000FVQYYK|4.0|The good news is that Muse appears to be emerging from Radiohead's shadow. Conversely, they appear to be going in many directions at once. This lack of direction provides a sometimes thrilling, sometimes bumpy ride. Take a Bow is the perfect introduction to the new Muse. Just at the point when your about to say \\"what the f...\\", the guitars kick in and the cd starts to take shape. The first three songs mix synths, guitars and genres and you realize this isn't your older brother's Muse (or Radiohead for that matter). The fourth track, Map of the Problematique, combines Depeche Mode and U2 while somehow not sucking. But wait, theres more oddities to come: Queen like harmonizing; flamenco music; a Herb Albert horn... and it works. By the time you get to the final track, Knights of Cydonia, you realize singer/guitarist Matthew Bellamy has lost his freaking mind. But damn if I didn't hit repeat and take the ride again...
B00005JKZ3|5.0|Smith & Jones make a fabulous duo.  Lara Flynn Boyle is marvelous in her role as bad girl.  The timing of all the actors is impeccable.  The jokes never stop, and many of them are shoulder-shakingly funny.
0440241413|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has really written a great fun, entertaining book.  I think this book could be a work of fact, there are so many people who are in this situation with debt and collection letters, and now we can see how they feel.  It is almost like an addiction to shopping, and then hiding from debt.<br /><br />A great book that you will breeze through!
B000F6IOC0|4.0|It's not very often that a sequel will be as good or better than the original.  \\"Underworld-Evolution\\" is every bit as good as the original.  It has a complete storyline, although it helps to have seen the first film, and the action and FX are well done.  But, the film is well worth watching if for no other reason than to see more or a wet, black leather-clad Kate Beckinsale portray Selene, the sexiest vampire to ever roam the shadow world.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins is part of a rare breed of researchers--those who can approach a question with a completely open mind, and suspend judgment until ALL the facts are in.  In his work, there is no hint of the all-too-common 'force-fitting' of facts into existing \\"boxes\\" (pre-conceived notions).<br /><br />If you are interested in what makes a successful business different from the 94% of startups that fail in their first 5 years...then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Once you read this, you'll want to pick up Collins' equally enlightening follow-up work:  \\"Built to Last\\".
B0000029DD|5.0|I read what I feel is an erroneous vocal comparison to Robert Plant.  If you know your music, you would hear the voice of Marc Bolan from T. Rex in Jeff Buckley's tragically sweet and haunting melodic sound.  But make no mistake...in a world rife with reproductions, Jeff Buckley had his own authentic sound.  On the other hand, if you're trying to describe Buckley's sound to someone who has never heard his music, then I can see the value of trying to cite the sound of an musical icon from a bygone era...but at least choose the most applicable iconoclast to make that comparison!
B00005JKL8|4.0|As usual Gene Hackman is perfectly cast in this dark portrayal of the US and international forces monitoring of the Bosnian/Serbian conflict. I caught the end of this film on a cable channel and it was forever imprinted in my memory. After watching the film again from beginning to end it's become one of my favorite \\"war\\" type of films, realistic, dark and gritty. <br /> <br /> If you like Owen Wilson be prepared for a shock. In many films he is cast in comedic roles as in the Jackie Chan films, Zoolander and The Wedding Crashers but this film shows the true depth of his abilities as a serious actor. This by far is my favorite Owen Wison film.
6305897786|5.0|This movie plays to Johnny Depp's almost natural underlying sinister quality. He plays a book finder in search of the authentic copy of The Ninth Gate. A book suppossedly written by Lucifer himself. The search started from a man seeking power, and in that search answers to questions that were to disturbing to utter were found.<br /><br />I loved this movie, hence i bought it !
0688023711|4.0|I picked this book up to read after visiting Mr. Perot's office. The book is a testimony to the commitment of a boss and fellow workers to risk it all to take care of your people and your friends. Whatever the debate within the State Department about Perot not giving diplomatic measures time to work, Perot realized time was of the essence and decisions could not wait.  <br /> <br />A side lesson, apropos for today, was the rescue teams requirement to negotiate with government officials, tribal leaders, mullah's, and anyone toting a gun to achieve objectives or make progress.   <br /> <br />This is a book about men who were selfless, placing their lives in great danger, adapting on the fly, and then returning to America to work in their buisness suits. A rare group indeed.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|If you are into suspense, horror, sci-fi, action, fighting and/or vampire type movies, this is a great movie to add to your collection.  After you get watch this, you will definitely want to purchase the second one too.  I bought them both at the same time and think they are great movies.
B00007KWHG|5.0|I was in a casino the other day, one of those that cater to the baby-boomer crowd, when BIG GIRLS DON'T CRY came blaring over the <br />P.A. Instantly the images of enormous cars with tail fins, massive chrome grills, and drive-in's with car hops came to mind. <br />Somehow I've missed adding THE FOUR SEASONS to my collection, but now that I have it, it's a most welcome addition. Has all their sixties classics in addition to DECEMBER 1963.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|You have to buy this movie if you have seen the first Underworld.  I purchased them both together, and I have heard many people say that this one is even better than the first, and I would not disagree.  I like them both though.  Awesome graphics, fight scenes, etc.  Good movie to add to the collection.
B000002JSP|4.0|No matter how negative the reviews from others on this disc, I have always loved it.  A bit synth heavy in places (Carouselambra anyone?) which makes this more of a John Paul Jones record than anything.  Three other tunes (which showed up on \\"Coda\\") were recorded during these sessions, and if the CD had been around then, I believe those songs would have been released as part of In Throught the Out Door.  You'd have a Jimmy Page-John Paul Jones balance and would make a much stronger record.  Anyway, if I were to sequence those songs into the mix, my ITTOD would look like this: <br /> <br />1.  In The Evening <br />2.  South Bound Saurez <br />3.  Fool in the Rain <br />4.  Hot Dog <br />5.  Carouselambra <br />6.  Ozone Baby <br />7.  Darlene <br />8.  All My Love <br />9.  I'm Gonna Crawl <br />10.  Wearing And Tearing <br /> <br />I always thought by putting \\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\" at the end of ITTOD that the album ended on a down note, like \\"Tea For One\\" did on \\"Presence.\\"  By putting \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" at the very end, you'd get an ending like Physical Graffiti's \\"Sick Again.\\"   <br /> <br />But enough of my Monday Morning Quarterbacking - this album is not a disappointment.  Buy it!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Great Buy.  Very happy with my purchase.  Thanks
0312323859|4.0|I was very skeptical since I wasn't a fan of Darcy or babies/pregnancies but I was pleasantly surprised!  Her character did quite the unexpected turnaround making it very enjoyable.  I liked the `Something' series so much that I kept finding myself wondering what the other characters were thinking during the different situations.  Giffin kept it interesting and pleasurable.  I definitely recommend reading it after Something Borrowed.
0446677450|4.0|All, <br />  I am not a millionaire, but I plan on being one.  I know I do not know enough right now, but I do know that I need fresh ideas on how to achieve this goal.  This book was my first exposure to \\"learning\\" about the mind set of a successful investor. <br />  That being said, this book is not your \\"instruction manual\\" on how to become an overnight success.  It is designed as part of an evolution in thinking, developing the millionaire mind set. <br />  In order to benefit from this book I found that I needed to be willing to put my beliefs in my pocket and maintain an open mind towards Mr. Kiyosaki's ideas and presentation.  His delivery is not earth shattering in its content, rather it moves you in subtle ways, providing a fresh perspective on society and its engrained habits, thereby suggesting how you can modify yours. <br />  Overall I would say that this book is an interseting read and a beneficial first step in modifying your estabished spending and working habits; towards your becoming a financial success and independently wealthy.
B00005MP58|5.0|Absolutely loved BBC/A&E's version of Pride and Prejudice.  It's one of the best I've seen.  Great actors, great scenery, great everything.  Although, I do have to agree that it does not have some of the special features such as subtitles like other DVDs but overall it's a great mini-series.  They actually have time to follow the novel faithfully and allow character developement etc. unlike the more recent movie starring Kiera Knightly - which was a total waste.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Great race movie, better than \\"Le Mans\\". Superb music, realistic shots, the actors really driving Formula 3 cars made up to look like Formula 1, everything is worthwhile.  I recommend for all ages, it's a timeless film.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This album is a classic.  Very well written and sung.  Lovely.  Lauryn has such a timeless voice, she is one of the best.  She is very real.  It is refreshing.
B000E97Y6K|2.0|The sad thing about this movie is that it was full of wasted potential.  It started out with an intersting lead, and made you want to get to know more about the story, as well as the characters.  Then, we got to the bloody jungle and it all went downhill from there. <br />Major plotlines were suddendly dropped.  For instance, what happeneded to the love brewing between Adam Brody and Naiomi Watts?  There chemistry suddenly fell flat. Plus this is a movie which shows how important an editor's job is to the overall movie process.    There is no reason in the world that this movie had to be 3+ hrs long.  None.  Nada.  Zip.  Zero.  I felt every hour of this movie-3 hrs which i will never get back.  And the sad thing was that even I could see places where things could have been cut!   Like for instance, did Kong have to battle, not 1, not 2, but 3 monsters?  One really intense brawl with one of those disgusting creatures would have been great for me. <br />By the end, you cared neither about the story, or the characters.  It's funny, when one would think that the more time spent with a character, the better you get to know them, but after the 3 hrs the only character I truly cared about was the giant monkey, and he went and died at the end, which pretty much sums up what the movie did as well. <br />However, the special effects-if you're into that sort of thing- were AMAZING.    Brilliantly done, it felt as if you were truly there.  However, special effects can't rescue a movie.  The settings were also lovely, and the costumes relating to the time period was gorgeous.  But honestly, this movie was childish, boring and long, and sadly, might have been a halfway decent movie if not for the length.  The only saving grace was that I wasn't the one who had to pay for the tickets, though i still considered asking for my money back. <br />
1400049628|5.0|Yeah I enjoyed it.  Yes, I recommend it.  But most of all I believed it!  You may also, if you let the book suck you in with its earnest tone.  It is a great survival book that make you wonder what you would do in this fictional set of disastrous circumstances.  Replaced the Zombie Hordes with a Hurricane, riot, earthquake or epidemic and you begin to feel that there is at least some value to this book.   <br />Sci-fi, Horror, Survival, Medical, Military and Martial Arts fans should all have a copy of this book on their shelves.
B000FQJAIM|4.0|I'm excited to hear that both versions are being released.  I love origional theatrical versions, (and I usually hate tampering) but in receiving the originals in the package, it justifies being able to enjoy the 2004 edited release.  There's also some magic in seeing how the films were first imagined. <br /> <br />Please, rate the product based on quality, not personal feelings?  Pretty please? <br /> <br />I didn't give it a 5, only due to in the above description, there weren't any real documentaries or deleted scenes. Albeit the documentary is very worn out by now, but I'm spoiled when it comes to DVD's and extra features.  A 2-D game where I play Han and shoot at a panning Greedo gallery would even make me happy. &lt;&lt;;; <br /> <br />Finally, who said George was obligated to listen to ingrates and protests?  It's HIS story, it's HIS work, and there are many  happy fans that helped him make it a reality.  It's really just like you writing an author and complaining about THEIR work, or THEIR ending, and petitioning a change.  Sounds kind of silly, doesn't it?  It just happens to be, regrettably, that fans within the film industry have convinced themselves of some non-existant authority.  If you don't WANT to buy it, then don't.  Please, put your money into something less materialistic, but don't ruin it for the people who love the story.  George isn't in your living rooms twisting your arms.
0743454537|5.0|The second book I read by Jodi Picoult. I had a hard time putting it down and after I finished I couldn't stop thinking about it. Such an excellent story. I loved how she wrote each family member's point of view. It would have been interesting if she had added Kate's point as well. In any event, I highly recommend this book as well as \\"The Pact\\" by Jodi Picoult. The twists in both books will leave you speechless.
0140131558|3.0|\\"The New York Trilogy\\", by celebrated author Paul Auster, is made up of 3, somewhat interlinked, long stories which were originately published separately at various times around 1985-86.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Paul Auster is a terrific writer so I won't even get into that aspect of the book.<br /><br />Let's get down to what's really important by trying to pinpoint the subject matter, i.e., what \\"the new york trilogy\\" is really about: in a sense, it's a mystery, in the true sense of the word, because even in the end many questions (most, I dare say) are left unanswered, many stones unturned and many cues are simply left hanging in the air.<br /><br />The NYT has been described as metaphysical detective fiction and the description might in fact prove apt: each of the 3 stories follows the investigations of one man which always turn into an obsession, making the man completely lose touch with the reality. The NYT is thus much about mental processes, we see each of the 3 main chracters gradually become so absorbed by their quest that they lose all sense of proportion and stop thinking like the rest of us.<br /><br />It's also a novel about writing because writing, depicted as the greatest obsession of all, always plays a role in the stories.<br /><br />There is also a definite surreal element in most stories and, quite often, they reminded me of Dino Buzzati's short stories.<br /><br />The author is obviously very pleased with himself, playing with his own name (much like B.E. Ellis does in his recent \\"Lunar Park\\") and toying with the other character's names (which pop up in different stories, alluding to the possibility of a strong link between them all).<br /><br />Did I like the book? As much as it's clever and well-written, it leaves you with a sense of un-completeness, too much stuff remains only vaguely hinted at (I was never one to fall for open-endings. Plus, everything is open here, much more than necessary) and in the ends, the whole thing sound more like an elaborate intellectual game that engaging fiction. Thus, I give the novel 3 stars although this is in no way diminishes my appreciation of the author's talent.game that engaging fiction.

0618001905|5.0|I have owned this book for a few years and never picked it up to read.  I had good intentions, of course, but it just looks \\"heavy.\\" <br /> <br />Last week I noticed it again getting dusty on my bookshelf and picked it up.  I was immediately engrossed.  Hochschild tells the story in well-defined, small chapters which are done before you have a chance to get bored.   <br /> <br />He manages to remain objective even when describing the most grizzly and atrocious happenings.  He turns our most revered personages into human beings, complete with faults.  He does not condemn or trivialize.   <br /> <br />I will definitely explore other books by Adam Hochschild as well as do more reading about colonialism in Africa and other places. <br /> <br />A good and easy read.  Don't pass it by!
B000002J09|1.0|And I don't care anymore. If liking this album is the only way I can be cool in the world I say to the world F**K YOU!!! I never liked this album for the most part. From the first riff of \\"Black Dog\\" to the last riff of \\"When The Levee Breaks\\". There was some breaths of fresh air on the song \\"Going To California\\", but the rest of this is overplayed, and way too much requested. \\"Black Dog\\" is just annoying, \\"Rock And Roll\\" is good for the first half, but when the 3rd verse came into play it just fell flat. \\"The Battle For Evermore\\" is good for the most part, but when Plant repeats that one word over again it sounds like a cat meowing, and it gets on my nerves, then you have \\"Stairway To Heaven\\", and all the glory it's recieved as a holy hymn to Satan, but to sing it you must play it backwards, \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" has some good sounding drums, but that's all it has going for it, \\"Four Sticks\\" the best version of the song is done by an anonymous band off the compilation \\"The Song Retains The Name\\", and \\"When The Levee Breaks\\" is a depressing lament that kills the ears, soul, spirit, and just makes you want to pull a gun out, stick in your mouth, and pull the trigger. I know that I think it's the worst piece of S**T that I've ever heard. Now that you know how I honestly feel about this album I can move on. I no longer care if you like, or hate me. I'm free.
B000GFLKEY|3.0|Others here have told the plot line well.  I will just add that the early sequences are nicely filmed and the story is immediately engaging.   <br /> <br />Denzel plays an aging detective who has little in the way of heroics in his repertoire.  He's a bad dresser, laughs too loud, but brings some intelligence to the job.  Nevertheless, one wonders what the sex-kitten girlfriend sees in him. Jodi Foster plays a villain, and she does a great job of being truly unlikeable.   <br /> <br />I've never been a fan of Clive Owen, and he does little to change my mind here.  His character -- the lead bankrobber -- does a lot of posturing and swearing and does a good job of intimidating his hostages, but it's a bit hard to see what part of that character would care to shame an exNazi [the reason for the heist at that PARTICULAR bank]. Willem DaFoe is credible as a cop, but not much is asked of him here.  Christopher Plummer seems not sufficiently old enough to have made a lot of money during WWII and still be as young as he seems at the time of the robbery.  <br /> <br />There are references to Dog Day Afternoon (1975), another heist-turned-hostage-crisis film based on a real event.  And like Spike Lee's other films, there is some social criticism regarding race, violence, and power.   <br /> <br />All in all, there are nice plot twists and turns until the end, where it takes too many additional scenes to tie up the loose ends.
B000DZIGDU|5.0|Since we all know what choreographed horse-dung most \\"reality\\" shows are these days, it is downright refreshing to watch a movie that skillfully conveys a time, a place, and a group of people as well as this film captures Gulf War One.  You remember, the time we actually won, actually GOT \\"Mission Accomplished\\" with barely a few scratches (well, ok there were a few hundred casualties but 90% by accidents, friendly fire or by the one Scud missile that hit an Army barracks).  Yes, THAT war---led by the elder Bush not his idiot son, and where our troops were truly greeted as liberators.<br /><br />Problem was, for the boots on the ground, Gulf War One was really one long tedious slog leading up to a total anti-climax.  The only American combat personnel to really see much action were the air force, who did most of the work ahead of the ground forces.  Oh, were all wars for oil so easy and painless!  Sam Mendes, director of the highly acclaimed \\"American Beauty,\\" does a fine job of capturing exactly what that experience was like, mostly from the perspective of a brighter-than-average 20 year recruit played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a slightly absurdist anti-hero who quickly regrets his decision to volunteer which he later describes as, \\"I got lost on the way to college.\\"<br /><br />Yes there are allusions to other classic war movies, and there are a number of parallels with the movie that the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr correctly called \\"the greatest war movie of all time:\\" Stanley Kubrick's masterful \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" which this movie predictably cannot match.  Yet it is far from a failure, as some reviwers have claimed---Mendes has achieved enough clout and independence as a filmmaker to not have to pander to the lowest common denominator audience's eternal desire for easily recognizable good guys, bad guys, and uplifting endings.  What we get instead is a vivid and generally very entertaining portrait of men trained and then thrown into a war that actually wasn't much of a war.<br /><br />Mendes certainly does share some subtle anti-war sentiments, but that does not prevent him from admiring the devotion that men develop for their fellow soldiers, which is the one thing that keeps them in battles that they often know are totally absurd and unnecessary, and keeps them from rebelling against commanding officers, generals and politicians who usually have far more ego than intelligence.  He also does a fine job of exposing the viewer to the very unglamorous realities of military daily life and military culture and the animalistic group dynamics that develop between young men thrown together into that type of environment.<br /><br />So those viewers looking for a nice kiss-the-flag exercise in sentimental patriotism will surely be disappointed, as will those violence junkies hoping to see some satisfying combat scenes---there really aren't any.  Mendes goes to great pains to NOT commercialize or cosmetize violence, and this is perhaps the reason why he has been accused of making a \\"cold\\" and \\"distanced\\" film in some quarters.  For instance, he chooses to show us the charred and smoking aftermath of the \\"Highway of Death\\" massacre in which US aircraft slaughtered thousands of Iraqis fleeing Kuwait ahead of the American invasion instead of the actual massacre itself.  What many viewers and reviewers seem to overlook is that in this day and age, with our modern air-based weaponry, much of war itself IS very much \\"cold\\" and \\"distanced\\"---at least the wars that we still win quickly and convincingly.<br /><br />\\"Jarhead\\" is most enjoyable if you have some appetite for dark and absurdist humor, and do not insist that every movie have the same predictable Hollywood 3-act plot lines and focus-group hooks.  Yes there are a few somewhat clunky moments but there are also some exquisitely bittersweet ones, such as when a Vietnam USMC vet hops on the homecoming bus for the returning soldiers and tries in vain to bond with them.  A Steven Spielberg or other such director would not have been able to resist turning that into some tear-jerking, crowd-pleasing ending---Mendes has the cojones and the artistic integrity to just tell it like it is, even if the audience would much prefer to get their rocks off through the usual tricks and cliches.ve been able to resist turning that into some tear-jerking, crowd-pleasing ending---Mendes has the cojones and the artistic integrity to just tell it like it is, even if the audience would much prefer to get their rocks off through the usual tricks and cliches.
0920668364|5.0|This book is a heart warming reflection of the relationship between a mother and son and how it begins, develops and changes over time.  I was given this book when my son was an infant, he is now seventeen and it is still one of the most treasured books in our home library.  I still can not read this book without getting emotional, it really pulls at your heartstrings. <br />I often give this book to new mothers as a baby gift and I always give it with pride and with the knowedge that it will probably become a treasured item for them as well.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The second that I saw this, I bought it. I had been hearing for YEARS that this was coming to DVD, and I'm so glad that it finally did. <br /> <br />Pink Floyd never delivers anything \\"sub-standard\\", and this double disc is no exception. The sound is superb (if you son't have a surround system, this concert is worth getting one), and the visuals, though a bit dated, are as clear as you can get. After too many years of the VHS copy, this is almost like seeing it for the first time all over again. <br /> <br />On a side note, I noticed that ENIGMA is now replaced by E=MC2 behind them during \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\". Publius apparently has gone underground for the DVD.
B000H7JCG4|5.0|Years ago I got hooked on 90210 by my sisters.  Then my good friend and I found ourselves watching it at 4pm every day after school.  What does this mean for me? Its less about a great show (although it is) and more about great memories from a simpler time of life.   <br /> <br />Plus....It's about time.
B000EHRVP6|5.0|There are two types of horror flick. In the first, the protagonist battles a monster that all of us knows doesn't exist - can't exist. We watch Creature of the Black Lagoon and appreciate it as camp, never believing for a second that there reall was a lizard-man that  was swimming below the beautiful girl. We can watch this and relax. Then there is the second type, the kind that makes us squirm. We watch Jaws, and secretly fear that there really is a horrible predatory shark just below the surface, swimming under the beautiful girl.  We see this and getting in the water is never quite the same. Hostel falls squarely in this second class, and does it with gritty intensity I haven't seen in a long time. Well, maybe Saw did it too - there really might be a sicko out there wanting me to make the choice between my foot and escape. The story of Hostel is pretty clear, and is identifiable to a lot of us (especially guys) who went to Europe with just a backpack and dreams of adventure. Some guy we meet along the way tells us, \\"Hey, go there. You'll find all the girls you can handle.\\" Well the guys in this movie take his advice, and really do get more than they can handle - way, way more. The, \\"Holy Cow, I can't believe it!\\" ending makes it worth sitting around to the credits. Sure it is juvenile, but so is going abroad to find sex. I work a lot of nights, and we often sit arund talking about movies we've recently seen. The consensus is that Hostel, along with Saw and Derailed is among the creepiest movies released for a long time. I have to confess that I gave a lot more thought about where I stayed when I went to Italy this summer than I usually do. Any movie that has the Jaws Effect - the ability to make you change your day-to-day behavior easily deserves five stars in my book.
B000EULJLU|2.0|i like tool but this cd is a waste of money and time. cant believe we waited this long for a new release from them and this is what we got. there are 2 good songs on the whole cd. the rest is a bunch of rambling nonsense musically and otherwise
B0009FU0ZQ|4.0|Tom Selleck does a great job portraying a small town police chief dealing with a serial type killing spree taking place. A sleeper of a movie, it will keep you entertained and on the edge, although movie makers still have the \\"I know what's going to happen next\\" theme, the movie moves very well and doesn't carry a lot of baggage. <br /> <br />Violence, laughter, friendship and love story all in one! What more can you ask for. Well, maybe a few more details would've been nice, but for overall viewing it was great!

0380820846|3.0|Best line: \\"Next time you want to complain about the trials and tribulations of universal adoration, try being an on-the-shelf-spinster for a day.\\" (100)<br /><br />In the fourth Bridgerton book, Colin Bridgerton returns from another series of travels and finds himself quite frequently the subject of Lady Whistledown's column.  He befriends his little sister's best friend, Penelope Featherington, because she's the one person he feels he can talk to about the difficulties of being a Bridgerton and the pressure to live up to the name.  Penelope, however, at 28 is not in the mood to hear Colin complain about how difficult it is to be adored. She is most assuredly an old maid and has herself been the subject of many stinging set downs from Whisteldown. Still, they strike up an easy friendship which eventually turns romantic.<br /><br />I like this book because it was a quick and funny read, but it wasn't quite a love story.  It was more a story about two friends who found a romantic interest in one another, but there was no real spark between Penelope and Colin.  The highlight of the book for me was the ton's efforts to unmask the infamous Lady Whistledown, and that subplot carried throughout most of the book.  This book didn't have the romantic tension of The Duke and I (Book 1) or The Viscount Who Loved Me (Book 2), but it still held its own in this series.  I definitely liked it more than An Offer From a Gentleman (Book 3), and look forward to finishing up the series.
B0000AMRJD|5.0|First...there was Elvis Presley-THE KING OF ROCK AND ROLL.  Then, there was James Brown-THE GODFATHER OF SOUL.  And now, there is Al Pacino-THE ULTIMATE GANGSTER IN MOVIE HISTORY!!!! <br /> <br />I would rate this movie with unlimited stars...but unfortunately...they only go up to five on Amazon.  This movie has everything for the ultimate gangster movie-The script (i.e. \\"SAY 'HELLO' TO MY LIL' FRIEND!\\"), the characters (Al Pacino (PERFECT GANGSTER!)), drug money, crooked cops, gore (NOT TO THE EXTENT OF HORROR FILMS, BUT ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THIS REALLY HAPPENED) explosions, guns, guns and most importantly-MORE GUNS!!!!!!!   <br /> <br />This is not one of those fake movies where when a guy gets shot in the leg he is still able to run at normal speed. HA! no way...when a guy gets shot in the leg in this movie, you better believe he will stay down! (he might still be alive but he aint gonna do no more runnin' for a long time).  <br /> <br />Tony Montana (Al Pacino), comes from being a low-life prisoner of Castro's; a \\"scumbag\\" murdering street gangster, and goes \\"straight to the top.\\"  He has everything anyone can want-money, cars, \\"the girl,\\" friends, mansion, and his own private security force with no rules, no law, and NOBODY to tell him what to do next...UNTIL...he makes one wrong move against his new partner Alex Sosa (Paul Shenar), wich soon after leads to his downfall.  THE ENDING OF THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST I HAVE SEEN IN YEARS!!!!!!!!   <br /> <br />If you want the best movies in your collection, you would be a fool not to add this one to your collection! <br /> <br />TONY MONTANA~ THIS ONE'S FOR YOU BRO!!!!!! (KEEP IT UP AL PACINO! YOU THE MAN!!!) <br /> <br />~Jason Lessmann

B000FSME1A|5.0|It seems kind of sad that most of the great films I've been watching recently are actually older films while recent ones haven't been that inspired. Director of the Godfather trilogy and the Conversation, Francis Ford Coppola decided to make a film based around the book \\"Heart of Darkness\\" about Vietnam. Instead of just a simple film, he got a production that dealt with storms, delays, overbudgeting and even a heart attack. What we're left with is one of the better war films and all-around films period. <br /> <br />Willard is an officer who gets called in on a special and odd assignment: eliminate a Colonel Kurtz, a highly respected officer who's gone recently mad. So Willard and a crew of others decide to go head-first into Southeast Asia to kill the Colonel. <br /> <br />Released on a DVD(that I've found overpriced lately) and the extended Redux version, Apocalypse Now was one of those movies that everyone wanted a proper DVD release for. Well it's been released finally in this edition, and it's one of those kind of releases where you get everything you wanted yet you feel something's off. For one thing, the film's been separated in 2, having both the original and Redux versions split across 2 discs, similar to Titanic or Godfather II. Not only does it seem unnecessary, it breaks up the flow of the original, although it does provide a good break from the feels-lengthy Redux version. <br /> <br />What's ultimately missing is the documentary Hearts of Darkness which covers the film's production in extensive detail. Wrapped up in legal disputes, the documentary couldn't be released with the film and although I didn't have a problem with its exclusion, the troubled production story interests me so it's sad we can't see it. The other extras are quite good with a really interesting look at the new sound system they had to develop as well as a visual presentation and discussion about the opening shot. <br /> <br />One way to tell of a film's popularity is how many aspects made it into pop culture. From the napalm and extreme prejudice lines to the helicopter scene using Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries(hilariously parodied on the Simpsons), the film's quite popular for a reason. However, I still prefer the original since it's better paced as the Redux version seemed to be expanded for the sake of it(besides having nudity, the Playboy bunny encounter seems unnecessary, as well as the French Plantation). <br /> <br />Should you buy it? Well, it's hard to say. It all comes down to 2 things: do you mind not having Hearts of Darkness and going for the 2 versions on one package and some other extras or would you prefer to wait for a most-likely-to-happen Super-Duper Edition. Personally? I couldn't wait.
0451529308|5.0|Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts.  I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.<br /><br />As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well.  The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.<br /><br />But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them.  People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.<br /><br />I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.<br /><br />The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words.  And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.<br /><br />Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.<br /><br />I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage.  It's a time period that few books consider.  Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens.  I like this approach better.<br /><br />Should you read Little Women?  Does the sun rise in the East?<br /><br />If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.<br /><br />Here's the story in a nutshell:  During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army.  Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas.  But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness.  Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather.  The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow.  Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another.  One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.<br /><br />The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions.  Meg is beautiful and much admired.  She should attract many suitors.  Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself).  Beth is very kind and yet fragile.  Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet.  Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.<br /><br />You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits.  Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.<br /><br />What a joy!s the story in a nutshell:  During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army.

0380820846|3.0|I really liked this book from the start. Loved Penelope!!!! However it really isn't a very sensual or romantic story. I thought the chemistry between Penelope and Colin was really lacking. <br />Still love Julia Quinn!!! \\"How to marry a Marquis\\", \\"Dancing at midnight\\" and \\"Splendid\\" are my favorites!!! And much better than this one.
B00005JOQS|5.0|This was a complete surprise in the days of swash and buckle, where the special effects usually supercede any hope of story. Superman returns was subtle, sensitive and very well put together.  I found myself emoting throughout.  The plane crash was very well done and even the only slight camp moment where brandon reminds us its still 'statistically' the safest way to travel, was just enough to relieve the audience.  Quango quango in the lift was fantastic, and the scene where Mom tells Superman that she thought that she would never see him again are particlarly fond memories.  The angst of the love triangle was also really well thought through....poor X-X-man! <br /> <br />If there was a disappointment, it was Kevin Spacey, I expected more from his role, he underplayed it to the point that I felt that he was standing in till the real actor came along and gave it menace! <br /> <br />Apart from that, this was a REALLY great film and has kept Bryan Singer top of my charts.  Shame about X-men 3....dull, dull, dull.....
1400032717|5.0|While the book was at times teetered on the edge of dull by the great detail that the main character discusses issues that are off topic and not related to the plot, it offers insight into how he thinks, offering character development for the plight of this autistic young man.   <br />All in all, I found this quick read very well written and thoroughly entertaining.

B000E41MS6|5.0|Outstanding production value. This is the way we always wanted Doctor Who to look. Super special effects, and continuously building plot that finally culminates in a battle with the Doctor's greatest enemy. I'm ready for season two and so is my 3 year old! He makes us watch the episodes over and over. The DVD's are outstanding. Lots of extras to explore.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  It reminds me of the original 1978 version by John Williams, and uses many of his themes and musical motifs.  One can even envision many of the scenes from the movie itself while listening to the it, which is to me at least the ultimate test of a good movie soundtrack.
055299703X|4.0|Bill Bryson is best known for writing very humorous travel books, and \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" is indeed a funny account of his travels in Australia. Those who love Bill Bryson's books for their humor won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />But unlike most people, I like Bill Bryson best when he's NOT trying to be funny, and my appreciation of this book is mostly due to the great amount of very interesting information presented. <br /> <br />Bill Bryson amazes you with loads of information about the geology, the animal life, the plants and insects, the history, the statistics, the folklore, etc., etc. The many dangers: poisonous snakes, poisonous insects, poisonous jellyfish, crocodiles, sharks, and rip currents - they're all out to get you. The inhospitable deserts, the beautiful beaches, the huge distances; Bill Bryson gives you a feeling of what it's all like. <br /> <br />The book goes into detail about many aspects of Australian life that are fairly unknown, including the discovery (and re-discovery) of Australia, the settlement by British prisoners, the early expeditions to explore the interior, the gold rushes, the outlaws, and the devastation caused by rabbits and other imported animals and plants. Bill Bryson talks about the many unusual animal species found only in Australia, including giant earthworms that grow up to 1 meter (and can be stretched to 4 meters) and the platypus, a cross between a reptile and a mammal. He talks about Australians and the Australian society, and the situation regarding the native people, the aboriginals. <br /> <br />Bill Bryson doesn't cover all of Australia from the geographical point of view, and the parts he does cover are somewhat random. But that doesn't matter because he captures the spirit of the whole country based on the parts he does visit and the general information he includes. <br /> <br />A very positive aspect is that Bill Bryson makes it clear that he loves Australia. The feeling is infectious, and it makes you want to pack your bags and head \\"down under\\" for a long leisurely trip so you can do your own exploring. <br /> <br />If I were to mention two things I was less happy about, it would be the occasional excessive attempts to be funny and the lack of contact with Australians. One of the best parts of the book is about his traveling together with an Australian couple for 3-4 days, but other than this passage Bill Bryson is mostly playing the typical tourist, with little or no contact with Australians. And despite a fairly long discussion about the aboriginal situation he does not ever get into contact with any aboriginals. Why not? <br /> <br />A final note regarding the unabridged audio version of the book, read by Bill Bryson himself: Most authors are poor readers, but Mr. Bryson does a very good job here, almost on a par with a professional reader. Recommended. <br /> <br />Rennie Petersen <br /> <br />PS. \\"In a Sunburned Country\\" has also been published under the title \\"Down Under\\". It is exactly the same book.
B000EQ4G5K|4.0|This is one of the best albums of 2006.Rihanna will be around for quite some time.My favorite tracks off of ''A Girl Like Me'' are ''Unfaithful'',''We Ride'',''PS [Still Not Over You]'' and ''Million Miles Away''.Rihanna has a nice set of pipes at the age of 18.I can't wait to see the video for ''We Ride''.Anyways cop the album its definitely worthed.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|This is one of those rare films that last for nearly three hours and keeps your attention for every second. The battle scenes were shot brilliantly and the action and acting is riveting. As much as this is a war film, it is also a fantastic character study of an interesting historical figure. Once you start this film, you won't want to turn it off until end.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Some friends at work talked me into borrowing their copy of this series.  After several months, I finally threw in the first DVD one night.  I was hooked immediately and watched the entire series over the next few days.  I cannot believe that this was cancelled.  Excellent!
0140187650|3.0|This is a philosophical book passed off as history.  It is also a renowned and famous book.  Arendt, famous for her affair with Nazi philosopher Hiedegger even after the Holaust and an expert on totalitarianism, presents the thesis that without the help of the collaborationist Jews in many of the Nazi occupied countries those Banal men who were 'just following orders' such as Eichman could not have acheived the Holocaust.  Thus she pus the blame for the Holocaust squarely on the 'actions' of Jews while reserving no judgement for the Nazis who ran the camps(themsleves mostly collaborators such as French, Austrians, Ukrainians, Germans from non-German lands and Poles), those Nazis are 'banal' which is to say 'boring' and therefore uner the rubric of moral relativism their actions cannot be judged, after all anti-semitism was part of their 'culture' it was not their fault they murdered 6 million people, because some of those people went willingly.<br /><br />This is a problematic thesis.  Eichman was no ordinary man.  He was not just a 'willing executioner' to use the new term, but he was an intellectual, a fanatic, who studied Hebrew to 'know his enemy' and read Talmud, he himself was devoted singly to the cause of national socialism(or Nazism).  This was his ideology and pagan-nazism became his religion, race the means by which he devided the world.  This man was invigorated with destroying the Jewish communities of Hungary and the Netherlands.  He loved his task, unlike those mundane Werhmacht men or Italians who cared not, or corrupt French, he was at the Holocaust with zeal.<br /><br />This book present philosophy ahead of fact.  It does indeed uncover the tragic role of the 'judenrat' the Jewish executive who managed the ghettos and did in fact collaborate, unknowlingly, in the Holocaust.  However in the end this book tells the truth, it has Martin Buber, the Yiddish anti-zionist philosopher, condemning the hanging of Eichman, because it would be a crime 'equal' to the Holocaust.<br /><br />Seth J. Frantzmanqual' to the Holocaust. <br /> <br />Seth J. Frantzman
B000HCO840|1.0|I had this horrible awful dream the other night that someone took the two of the greatest X-Men storylines of all time and reduced it to a terrifyingly bad encapsuliation, written and performed about as ineptly as anyone could ever imagine. Unfortunately this dream turned out to be real. And the more I thought about this film, the more upset I became. This is just an awful AWFUL film that, for some inexplicable reason, people continue to defend by saying \\"At least it was entertaining!\\". This jerkwad excuse does NOT work. There is very little fun and almost nothing funny about this film. It works hard to hold your interest but fails miserably. I do not actually blame Brett Ratner so much for this failure as much as I do the writers, Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn. They have little-to-no respect for the source materiel and even less for the characters. What's even worse is the performances in this film. Halle Berry couldn't be more wooden if she had roots firmly planted in the ground. Hugh Jackman... when did Wolverine become such a wuss-bag? When have we EVER seen Logan shed a tear in the comic? If you've found it, you're more of a fan than I. Hugh Jackman seems to want to turn Logan into the Melancholy Dane. And it works not one bit. The only outstanding performer in this film really is Sir Ian. McKellen is one of the greatest actors to have ever lived and he continues his great work here. Kelsey Grammer as Henry \\"Beast\\" McCoy also is quite good, because his performance is one done with great affection for the character. I don't know if the direction that they decided to go with for the creation of The Phoenix is interesting or absurd. It does fit in with more of the \\"real world\\" stuff that they're looking to do (having Phoenix be a repressed dominant personality rather than a cosmic lifeforce is definitely more realistic, but this is a COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION...). Anna Paquin, who has been my least favorite character of the entire series, not that I disliked Rogue, but Paquin ALWAYS seems to be on the verge of tears. Rogue was someone in the comics, who, at times, revelled in her power, whereas Paquin's Rogue is sooooo incredibly saddened by her abilities (understandably, but COME ON... let her have some FUN once in a great while) that we're meant to empathize with her ultimate decision, which is also something that really bothered me. Most people in this film are just wasted... none more so than James Marsden aka Cyclops. His character is given the WORST of the fates in store for the mutant heroes, and no respect is given to him other that a passing moment at the end. That was the worst part for me because Cyclops was always my favorite X-Man, and his treatment in all of the films (worst of all this film) is upsetting to say the least. For the better part of the first decade that X-MEN was in print, the main focus of the group was Cyclops, even though they did have the foresight to have the team have an actual TEAM dynamic, as opposed to this film where it seems it's Wolverine vs. the world. It ranks amongst BATMAN AND ROBIN, ELEKTRA, and LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN as one of the worst comic book films ever made, and I recommend to read the comics and skip this film entirely.aquin ALWAYS seems to be on the verge of tears.

The picture quality is better than any recent movie I've seem. <br />A must buy for people who enjoy this kind of movie.
B000BJS4SU|4.0|I've been following Mayer since his Room for Squares album.  I like all his stuff, but have found that this album tends to hold my interest for a longer period of time.  The others were entertaining, but this album hits your senses in a way the others didn't quite accomplish.  His new songs, Vultures and Gravity, which will also appear on his next release, \\"Continuum\\" are in my opinion his very best.  I couldn't stop playing Vultures for weeks!!!!    I guess I'm out of the loop.  I've been reading a few reviews and was surprised by the amount of controversy surrounding this guy.  Why everybody feels the need to crown or crucify him is bewildering to me.  Just take the music for what it's worth.  He's a great songwriter and a fantastic muscian.    P.S.  I meant to give this 5 Stars.  Sorry.  :)
0312995423|5.0|of dan browns four novels (da vinci code, angels and demons, deception point and digital fortress) this ties with deception point as the can't-put-down-gotta-keep-reading of the novels. the two books are more thrillers than the other two, which is more what I like anyway and they focus less on religion, which is not a huge topic for reading of mine
1400032717|3.0|It was a good book. I had to read this for summer reading. The only problem was that the main character, Christopher, would often go into random ramblings about math and random things that the reader didn't really care about. I understand that he was autistic, but seriously! I liked the actual plot, and that's about it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|...then you'll love the CD.  By now, more people have seen a cast *other* than the original, so it won't be exactly the way you might remember it.  I've come to the conclusion, after much listening and  YouTube surfing that the original cast was - if not the best - at least tied with the best, particularly the leads.
B00000DCHI|5.0|I like this compilation, it has all of Billy Joel's important hits, dring the 70's-early 80's. I think the songs were well selected, just one complaint I would have is that \\"Sometimes A Fantasy\\" wasn't included, I really loved that song, when it was popular. As for this time period, you won't find a better representation. Highly recommended.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I was so excited to get this DVD in the mail only to realize that when you put the DVD in your player, you cannot skip chapter, stop, go to the menu.  You are forced to watch the previews.  I'm the viewer and the CUSTOMER here, don't insult me like this.  I want to be able to control how and what I view.  Terrible, terrible DVD.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|this movie is not for everyone.  People who liked \\"1984\\" will love this film; those that didn't, will probably hate it.  It is visually appealing in a very dark way; but then again, if your tastes lean towards lighter, fluffier scenery, you won't agree with my statement.  The actors did a good job, especially Hugo Weaving.  I did have a hard time getting into him at first because of the mask, but after a while, you learn to appreciate it.  This was also one of the better jobs by Natalie Portman in the past few years (although she was good in Garden State - a very good movie btw). <br /> <br />Also, this is JUST A MOVIE - made for entertainment.  It's not going to change the world, for better or for worse.  Governments do that well enough without being influenced by a film.   <br /> <br />Like I said, view it with an open mind and perhaps you'll appreciate it.  I know I did. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002A46|5.0|There aren't too many Christmas albums out there period...but this is among the top. I love the fact that it's about the birth of JESUS and she's not ashamed of it. IMO, Mariah at her finest. MC...please do more Christian music :)
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Finallly got this one the other day and have been listening ever since.  I worked myself into a frenzy by waiting a month before I actually bought it, in the meantime listening to Supermassive Black Hole only and reading countless reviews (but never listening to samples).      While I was not immediately blown away when I finally hit 'play' for the first time, I was very impressed with their musical direction.  This is not Absolution pt. 2 just as that album was vastly different from both Origins Of Symmetry and Showbiz.  The attitude is the same, however, and the feeling I get from listening is similar.  This ability to significantly shift musical styles yet still retain the quality is an aspect to Muse's music I enjoy, and where I actually think they most closely resemble Radiohead.    Speaking of Radiohead, this should be the album that finally breaks Muse free of the constant 'sounds-like-Radiohead' criticisms... though they might be replaced by 'sounds-like-Queen' ones (which was always there, albeit more in the background).  The genuine way these guys embrace the dramatic has certainly not been seen since Queen, and having the guts to take what many bands would consider huge aesthetic risks actually works significantly to their benefit.    On their new album, they manage to merge synth-pop, progressive rock, metal, flamenco guitar, classical piano, and operatic vocals into a set that is completely cohesive.  It also has that 'album' quality where, listened to from start to finish, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  There are a few tracks I don't think hold up that well individually, but manage to work within the context of the album.  The tracks are as follows:    1. TAKE A BOW  This recalls Absolution's opening track, Apocalypse Please, in feeling and is built around similar synthetic arpeggios.  Halfway through, it breaks into a dramatic rocker warning our leaders of dramatic things like \\"burning in Hell for crimes against the Earth\\".  This track will carry you away all by itself, but is even more effective as the blasting-off-vessel that begins the ride through this album.  So begins the space opera. 9/10    2. STARLIGHT  This begins the ride through space, and the view is awe-inspiringly beautiful.  This track seems most like a synth-pop song on the album... very melodious and simple synth and piano, heartfelt lyrics, and a nice balance in the other instruments.  Probably the most controlled song on the album, yet it still feels fresh and original.  10/10    3. SUPERMASSIVE BLACK HOLE  A little controversial among fans.  When I first heard it, I double-checked whether I downloaded the right track.  Yep, this was Muse.  I was confused, disturbed, intrigued, and finally downright impressed.  This is catchy as hell, and makes a good single.  On the album, it actually feels appropriate in its spot.  Lyrically, it seems to be the dark turn of events hoped against in Starlight.  It feels the same musically.  Darkness rearing its ugly head in all its pop-trash glory.  9/10    4. MAP OF THE PROBLEMATIQUE  The album begins to feel like a relentless assault on all the right buttons at this point.  This track begins with a synth and guitar combination that recalls Enjoy The Silence.  It's just enough to produce those same pleasant endorphins as Violator-era Depeche Mode without sounding like a ripoff.  The song drives on in another direction anyway.  Lyrically, it feels like the close of the trilogy that began with Starlight.  Hope turns to Anger turns to Despair.  It's dark stuff.  I love it. 10/10    5. SOLDIER'S POEM  We get our first breather of the journey for a song that seems to be from the point of view of a dissenting soldier.  It holds up well with other slow and melodic Muse songs, and adds some very Queen-like vocal harmonies.  It's a little too short, and is one of those songs that doesn't hold up as well on its own, but fits in nicely within the album.  7.5/10    6. INVINCIBLE  This begins a trio ofsongs that, while not bad, do not have the freshness in ideas that elevate the rest of the album.  It seems every Muse album has this section for me.  All the songs usually win me over in the end, but this is my current least-favorite.  It ends with a very cool riff, but until then has an anthemic feel that does not dodge the \\"cheesy\\" moniker as deftly as the rest of the songs do.  It will grow on me.  6/10    7. ASSASSIN  Didn't care for it on the first listen... it's the hardest of the bunch.  It's the first time I feel assaulted in an unpleasant way.  I can't remember which time through the album it was, but this song finally clicked for me.  It's supposed to be a little unpleasant.  It's a call to arms.  I'm not ready to join yet, but I can see the appeal.  Could become a favorite in time, but right now it feels like it's missing something.  Maybe another unique synth arrangement would help it, but I can't help thinking what's really missing right now is time and repeated listening. 7/10    8. EXO-POLITICS  Interesting song about Alien Mind Control by \\"Zetas In The Sky\\" that is really about the way that people allow the government to think for them.  The result is the same.  The song unfortunately feels like something that would have been a weak track on OK Computer.  Musically it is competent but like the previous two tracks is bereft of the ideas that elevate the rest of this album. 7/10    9. CITY OF DELUSION  I was initially disturbed.  Flamenco guitar?  I realized from my experience with Supermassive Black Hole that disturbed feelings were probably a good sign so I decided to trust the band here.  Glad I did because this song really brings me back into the album.  It feels like an exciting and new journey again as the flamenco gives way to driving rock, and then folds the Spanish-sounding influences back in again.  8/10    10.  HOODOO   Cannot understand the negative opinions I've read on this one.  It beautifully blends all the different settings on the Muse-ship with the Spanish guitar of City Of Delusion and the best classical piano on the album.  I don't miss the piano in the rest of the album until I hear it used so well here.  Perhaps more piano could have added life to a couple of the middle tracks.  This is the perfect precursor to the final epic space battle.  There is much foreboding.  Probably also better on the album than it would be on its own, but still... 9/10    11. KNIGHTS OF CYDONIA  This is it.  One for all the marbles.  And Muse wins them.  Another reviewer pointed out that this song has no vocals for over two minutes.  You barely notice among the horses, lasers, and just plain exciting music.  I almost didn't even notice the vocals start as they are folded in just like another instrument.  Then, the song breaks into a dramatic rock spectacle with three part harmony.  \\"No One's Gonna Take Me Alive / And You And I Must Fight For Our Rights / You And I Must Fight To Survive\\"  I believe it.  I want to sing with them.  I want to join their fight.  I think maybe I am being overcome at this point.  Then it rocks out.  I almost wanted one MORE shift for the song to continue, but maybe I'm asking too much.   It's already 10/10.    12. GLORIOUS  Some of you will end your journey with the final battle and miss the Glorious celebration afterward.  If you feel robbed like I did, you'll go download this track so you can join the party.  I've only seen it offered on iTunes as part of the album (you can't get it as a single song). Some feel Knights is the appropriate end to the album, and going out on a high note has its appeal, but I feel like this ties it up better.  I haven't listened to it as much as the other tracks yet, but it is definitely worth seeking out to complete the listening experience.  8/10    The album is nearly perfect, only marred by an ever-so-slightly saggy middle that is actually pretty darn good as well.  I thought nothing could beat Thom Yorke this year, but I think this is my new frontrunner for Album Of The Year.  Time will tell which one holds up better.  I began this review thinking I would end it by saying \\"Black Holes And Revelations\\" is a close second to \\"Absolution\\" and a worthy addition to the Muse catalog.  However, I've listened a couple more times while writing this review.  It's their best.  Buy it if you love music.    Joel
B0000648WZ|1.0|This movie is all about looking good and little more as far as I am concerned.  However, amazing special effects can't save what is a pretty awful movie.  I won't go into the plot because it isn't worth it.  It's just stupid.  The acting is pathetic.  Sitting through the entire 2+ hours of this movie was a test of endurance for me.<br /><br />This movie was major disappointment, especially given the very favorable reviews I've read on Amazon.  I love science fiction and Paul Verhoeven's other sci-fi movies (Robocop, Total Recall, Hollow Man).  I can't believe this is the same director.  Man did this movie suck!
6305428042|3.0|My son and neice just love this movie, they watch it over and over.    I give it a 3 because they love it but it just puts me to sleep with boredom trying to watch it.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Do not believe the hype: this CD is bad.  I mean, it's really bad.  No catchy riffs.  Completely self-absorbed lyrics.  The levels of angst and aren't-I-cute are cranked up way too high.  The singer's voice is nauseatingly annoying.  If they created a release with no vocals, just so they could strut their performance chops, then maybe, just maybe, it might be listenable.  Even that is doubtful. <br /> <br />I plan to return mine and ask for a refund.  Seriously.  The soundtrack to \\"Cabin Boy\\" would be vastly preferable.
B000AMJDHY|1.0|Creativity can only do so much, kids. Sure its fun and catchy and new. But so were the beatles before Sgt peppers. But thats not why we remember the beatles. Thats not why their great. They are a GREAT band becuase they actually brought sophisticated songwriting to mainstream music in and after Sgt Peppers. This isnt sophisticated songwriting. nothing happens in these songs. They dont move or develop. no solos, riffs, or instrumentals of any kind. the music relies entirely on its catchy lyrics and singing. thats not greatness, thats barely listenableness
B00003JRCQ|3.0|I love jane austen, but persuasion was not her best book and it didn't translate into the best movie. it is an all too common plot with actors you couldnt really believe. the leading man wasnt dashing and the leading woman offered no charm which was confusing when she was so highly prized.  <br />better as a rental.  <br />x
B0007LXPBI|5.0|A charming film score coupled with a refreshing re-write of the timeless story turn this one into a classic in its own right.  Lindsay Lohan outshines Hayley Mills in the role(s) of the twins, which puts this one a notch above the 1961 version.
006085880X|5.0|I first checked this book out from the library but it was so good that I had to buy it.  The two main characters are Emily and Chris, who have grown up next door to eachother all of their lives.  Anyone who has been in an intense relationship where you cannot really seperate yourself from that person will find this book to be easy to relate to.  By the end I was bawling my eyes out.  After reading this book I made my boyfriend and my sister and anyone that I could read it.  The ending was a bit of a surprise, I was definitely thinking that it would end more like Romeo and Juliet.  I highly recommend this book for anyone over the age of 14.  Jodi Picoult is a wonderful author and this left me addicted to her books.  By the way another great book is the Dogs of Babel, by Carolyn Parkhurst.
B0000524CY|5.0|In 1973, the scariest movie was released over an audience that dared to watch it. This scariest film of all time is entitled...THE EXORCIST. This film turned athiests into Catholics, it sent non-church-going Catholics to Church every Sunday, and it pretty much scared the living daylights out of every human being on this planet. Read on...if you dare. <br /> <br />    In Northern Iraq, FATHER LANKESTER MERRIN (played by Max von Sydow), a priest, who is also an archeologist, is digging up artifacts of the country, when he comes across a frightening piece...the face of Pazuzu, one of Satan's diciples. As he leaves Iraq and heads back to the states, he happens to get a glimpse of the stature of Pazuzu, the full statue. <br /> <br />    In Washington D.C., there lives an actress named, CHRIS MacNEIL (played by Ellen Burstyn). Living with here is her 12-year-old daughter, REGAN (played by Linda Blair). One night, while reading over a script for her next acting role, Chris begins hearing strange noises in her attic. She begins to suspect that rats are in the attic. How stupid can you be to think that rats are THAT big? <br /> <br />    While walking home the next day, after a day's work of shooting a few scenes of her next movie, Chris happens to pass by the local church, where she sees FATHER DAMIEN KARRAS (played by the brilliant Jason Miller). She saw Father Karras at the shoot early in the day. Late that afternoon, Father Karras is introduced properly as he visits his mother, who is very sick. Karras wants to have her in a nice retirement home, where she'll be properly taken care of, but Mrs. Karras does not want any part of that. <br /> <br />     That night, Regan and Chris are down in the basement, where Chris finds a Ouija board. Regan already knows how to work it, so she shows Chris how it's done. But for some reason, it does not want Chris to be involved. Oh, well, can't dwell over our losses...or can we? Over the course of the next two days, the noises in the attic begin getting louder and louder, Regan has been claiming that her bed has been shaking. Chris takes Regan to the doctor, where he diagnoses her with a nervous disorder. <br /> <br />      As Father Karras learns that his mother has sadly passed on, Chris holds a party at her house to celebrate the ending of her next film, which is entitled, CRASH COURSE. The director of CRASH COURSE, BURKE DENNINGS (played by Jack MacGowan) leaves early because he ended up pretty trashed. Chris and SHARON SPENCER (played by Kitty Winn), the woman who home-school's Regan, who also leaves with Regan and Chris, joins the last few guests of the party around Chris' piano. Playing the piano is FATHER JOSEPH KEVIN DYER (played by Reverand William O'Malley). Father Dyer is a close friend of Chris', despite the fact that Chris and Regan are athiests. As the guests sing along, they are joined by Regan, who looks at one of the guests claims so evil that...\\"You're gonna die up there\\", and then urinates on the carpet. The other guests leave the party, as Chris' maid, WILLI (played by Gina Petrushka) tries to scrub the urine stain out of the carpet. But at that moment, Chris hears Regan scream terribly. She runs into Regan's bedroom to find Regan's bed violently shaking on it's own. Chris jumps on the bed to protect Regan as well as trying to get the bed to stop shaking. <br /> <br />     The next day, Chris takes Regan back to the doctors to find out what the hell is going on, where the doctors perform an MRI and an EKG. They look at the results only to find that there is no disturbance in Regan's brain. At that moment, the doctors get a call from Chris, where they make a house call to the MacNeil house. Sharon informs the doctors that Regan is still having those A.D.H.D. episodes, but they have gotten severly violent. They enter Regan's bedroom, where growls in a deeply horrifying voice. She sits up, punches one of the doctors in the face, and says in a deep, man's voice...\\"Keep away, this sow is mine...\\", and then gets into a sexual position and simply says, \\"F--- me! F--- me! F--- me!\\", which is where the doctors heavily sedate her. <br /> <br />    The next night, Chris comes back from the doctors office, where she is informed that a psychiatrist for Regan is more than neccessary. She arrives home and checks on Regan, where her bedroom window is wide open. She closes the window and heads downstairs, where Sharon arrives home. Chris scolds Sharon for leaving Regan by herself, but Sharon claims that she didn't leave Regan alone, for she called Burke Dennings over to keep an eye on Regan, while Sharon went off to get more of Regan's medication. That is when one of Chris' co-actors from her movie arrives to tell her that Burke Dennings...has been killed. He fell down the stairs outside the house and rolled down the street, where he broke his neck, to which his neck was turned completely around, making a 180, facing backward. That is when Regan comes downstairs...in her frightening spiderwalk. <br /> <br />    The next morning, while going for a run, Father Karras meets LT. WILLIAM KINDERMAN (played by Lee J. Cobb). They discusss Burke Dennings murder, where the two go on about their business. The same day, Chris is discussing with the doctors about Regan's case, where the doctors inform her that Regan's condition is most likely not medical, but spiritual, which is where they tell Chris that Regan maybe under demonic possession and needs an exorcism. <br /> <br />     She takes Regan home and puts her in bed, where she finds a crucifix. She confronts Willi, Sharon, and KARL (played by Rudolph Schundler), who is Chris' servant, about the crucifix, but they all claim they had nothing to do with it. That is when Lt. Kinderman arrives and discusses Regan's case, as well as Burke Dennings' murder. As he leaves, Chris hears Regan scream in horror and fright. She runs up and finds Regan in bed masturbating with the crucifix, and saying (in a deep, man's voice) something that is to sac-religious to review here. Chris tries to grab the crucifix from Regan, but Regan grabs her mother's head and shoves her face into her daughter's bloodied up privates and says, \\"Lick me! Lick me!\\" She then punches Chris' face, where Chris goes down with force, where Regan's head makes a 180, where Burke Dennings' voice takes over Regan, saying, \\"Do you know what she did? Your C---ing dauther?!\\" <br /> <br />    The next day, Chris has a meeting with Father Karras. Now, as I said, Chris has no religious beliefs, but she is desperate need for religious seeking. She has Father Karras come by to see Regan, where Regan is fully under demonic possession, her face green and severly scarred, her eyes almost like a werewolf's eyes, her voice in a demon's voice. Father Karras introduces himself as who he is, where Regan introduces herself as...\\"and I'm the DEVIL!!!!\\". Apparently, Regan is not possessed by a demon, but by the Devil himself. <br /> <br />    He comes back the next day to make sure that this possession is for real. Father Karras finds Regan speaking Latin, a language that Regan has never learned before. He sprinkles water on Regan, claiming that the water is Holy water. Regan reacts to it very violently. Father Karras goes to the Church and asks for the permission to perform an exorcism on Regan. He is given the approval, but he is to have help alongside of him...Father Merrin is the one to perform the exorcism with Father Karras. The reason for allowing Father Merrin perform the exorcism, despite his severe heart condition, is the fact that back in the 1940s, Father Merrin had performed an exorcism back in Africa. The exorcism supposedly last for months, but the exorcism was a complete success. <br /> <br />    The two arrive at the house, to perform the ritual. They enter the room and begin the ritual. For the next 15-20 minutes, the exorcism takes place, and very horrifyingly. Father Karras and Father Merrin decide to take a little rest before it's time to start again. They enter the room, where Regan begins imitating Karras' deceased mother. Karras goes downstairs to get it together. He goes back to Regan's room to find Father Merrin...dead. He grabs Regan and begins beating her, where he shouts...\\"You son of a b****, come into me!!!\\" Father Karras finds himself possessed by the devil, where he tries to kill Regan, but Karras, with the control he needs, jumps out the window, down the stairs, and lands at the bottom of the stairs. The whole neighborhood arrives at the scene over Karras' body. Father Dyer arrives (since he and Father Karras are very close friends) and gives Father Karras a last confession. <br /> <br />    The next morning, Chris and Regan prepare to leave their house, for the exorcism is overwith and a complete success, since Chris' movie is now finished. As they leave, Chris hands Father Dyer a necklace that was worn by Father Karras, but Father Dyer wants Chris to keep it, where he watches Chris and Regan drive off. <br /> <br />    This, as I had stated, is the, if not one of, the scariest movie of all time. I have seen many scary movies in my day, but I have never seen a horror film that was this scary. This film will forever remaina cult classic.
B00005JM4Z|2.0|... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I've been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He's made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word \\"bro\\" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it's clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would've been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting. <br /> <br />Now you might be wonderning: who's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there's actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it's well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see \\"Timeline\\").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn't look so terrible, because everyone's focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there's even a sequel.
B0009353IW|5.0|I knew next to nothing about Chavez Ravine and what happened there.  I didn't read the extensive liner notes for a bit after I started listening to the CD. (Sorry, my bad.)  I knew there was a theme, a story, to the album.  Even though I don't understand Spanish, it was there. (Some of the cuts are in English, some are in Spanish--the comprehensive liner booklet provides lyrics and translations in both languages.)  But, bottom line, that all just provides depth and background to a grooving, poignant musical experience.  I love this CD.  I love listening to the sounds, the beats, the music. This is my latest favorite album, the one I keep playing in the car.  \\"Third base, Dodger Stadium,\\" \\"Poor Man's Shangri-La,\\" \\"Los Chucos Suaves\\"--try not to sing along, try not to move.  Not possible. <br /> <br />So buy it if you want a cohesive, thought-provoking, themed CD--which, plainly, some of the reviewers think is reason enough.  Or just buy it if you want to enjoy an unusual musical journey-- bluesy sometimes, rocking, a little jazzy, rumba beats and other funky Latin sounds, dreamy even mystical at times, kinda cranky at others. Maybe, at some point, you can consider the ramifications, the philosophical, anthropological, political underpinning; no doubt that will add to the experience.  But you don't need to know history to enjoy a journey through a strange country. You just need to be open to the experience. <br /> <br />It's a trip that I have enjoyed immensely.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|There's a lot of action and the acting is fine, but what in the world is going on in this film?  The main point is made that oil causes corruption, greed, killing, and maiming, but figuring it all out was very frustrating for this viewer.  Better to skip this one, despite the casting of fan favorites George Clooney and Matt Damon.

0375703764|3.0|House of Leaves is one of those books that's impossible to describe. It's weird, that's for sure, but even when you're trying to relate the intricacies of the plot - or even what the hell it's about - you find yourself speaking in paragraphs, and procuring the sporadic addendum, \\"And then there's this other guy...\\"<br /><br />House isn't particularly amazing. It's memorable in its execution and occasionally, Danielewski has a couple of sentences that highlight his command of the English language, but in terms of it being incredible, moving, revolutionary, or anything that a truly great book is, House kind of fails to deliver.<br /><br />This failure is probably aggravated by the fact that the story of the house itself - that is, the bulk of Zampano's book - is pretty dry. Johnny Truant's intermissions are the only refreshing factor, especially while Zampano spends countless pages describing architecture and dwelling on the Human Condition.<br /><br />In its defense, House of Leaves is a great book to read if you're unhappy. It will be unhappy next to you, sometimes funny, sometimes tragic, and, alas, very often boring. But if you're one of those people who can't sleep at night, this is a great book to read in those eight hours while the world is in bed.<br /><br />I must say - no spoilers herein, but just a thought - that the ending was disappointing, too. From all sides. The house AND Johnny didn't reach a satisfying conclusion, so that was sad-making.<br /><br />Otherwise, read it to have read it, so that you can say that you encountered a profoundly strange piece of literature where sentences are often upside-down and sideways.
B00005JMXX|1.0|I can just imagine the writer's thought-process: <br /> <br />\\"Let's see, we've got massive tornados in L.A., tidal wave engulfing NYC, an almost immediate deep-freeze that kills instantly, and a sick character who needs medication or she will die, what could make this better?  Wolves!  Yes, we need escaped wolves.\\" <br /> <br />Sheesh.  If anyone thinks the CGI effects in this movie are fabulous, they've obviously never seen a real wolf.  Those things weren't even close.   <br /> <br />Oh, and let's not forget the zoo that keeps the bears, sheep, and wolves right next to each other in a small building.  Riiight.   <br /> <br />I spent most of the movie either laughing at the absurdity of the scenario, and getting nauseated by the \\"sentimental\\" scenes.  <br /> <br />I'm not even going to go into the horrible plot, cliches galore, and all of the other just plain wrong things about this movie.  I'm not going to touch on the overt environmental and political messages that probably did more damage to real and important climate concerns - since from the reviews it seems some people actually believed this was even remotely plausible, while others used it to deepen their hatred of \\"greenies\\".   <br /> <br />Don't waste your time with this one.  There are far better movies of this genre.  And there are far better ways to learn about global warming.
B00097DX3U|5.0|A great mix that shows the band's deversity. Very enjoyable. I think this is Audioslave's best work so far.
B00005JP5J|5.0|...rather how often you pick yourself up.  Brlliantly captures the insanity of modern life.  You'll laugh.  You'll cry. A terrific movie!!
B000G759LW|5.0|WOW,While I had high hopes for this CD I didn't expect to love it as much as I do.I'm not usually a big fan of double albums as its usually a lot of music to process but in the case of \\"Back To Basics\\" it is well worth it.Christina has never sounded better and the music is \\"today\\" with an old school flavor.Disk one starts out rockin with \\"Makes me wanna Pray\\" \\"Back in the day\\",\\"oh Mother\\",Slow down baby\\"\\"Still Dirrty\\" are all highlights. <br /> <br />There are lots of possible singles here,my faves are \\"Ain't no other man\\",\\"CandyMan\\"\\"Here to Stay\\" \\"Slow down baby\\" and the \\"Right Man\\".The Linda Perry ballads on disk two are very good,\\"Have Mercy on Me\\" has a Fiona Apple vibe, \\"Hurt\\"will probably be a huge hit a la \\"Beautiful\\",'The Right Man \\" is very moving.\\"I Got Trouble\\" and \\"Nasty Naughty Boy\\"are fun throwbacks to the 30s and 40s. <br />This album is a fully realized vision from CXhristina Aguilera,we'll see her at Grammy time.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I heard \\"Dirty Harry\\" on Upop XM and began thinking about taking a chance on buying the album.  Then my wife came home one day and said she heard a song on a local station and really liked it-but she didn't know the title or artist.  The station helped when she emailed them and it turned out to be \\"Feel Good Inc\\" from the same album!  The choice was now clear!  Log on the Amazon! <br />A first listen to the whole album was good, but not as good as I had anticipated. The second, third, and fourth listen hooked me good!  I even like the 2 cuts I first thought were terrible.  Now I will be getting a second album so I don't have to share.
B00005JOSS|5.0|Oh my God... I don't even know what to say. This story is so real... It's fiction, but the emotions, the love.. It's all genuine. <br /> <br />It's amazing. If you have experienced true love you'll feel so identified! I loved it, I saw it 20 minutes ago and came running back home to see if it was available to buy. I guess I'll have to wait!! <br /> <br />In other aspects, truly nice performance of the actors. It was just perfect in every way. And I love Sandra Bullock!! (I'm starting to love Keanu as well).
B000BT97AO|4.0|I'm another of those who saw this at Sundance, and all the things I enjoy about Gaiman and McKean's graphic novels were on display: the quiet humor, the intelligence, the delightful weirdness, the astounding visual vocabulary. Except that in this case, the words are spoken by good actors, and all those visuals get up off their feet and move. <br /> <br />It's hard to describe the impact of watching a McKean painting move and talk. There might be those who quibble about the movie looking too \\"animated,\\" but of course that's exactly the point: to create a world and make it dance. The end result, visually at least, is like nothing you've ever seen before, and absolutely worth seeing for that reason alone. <br /> <br />Some of the people I talked to after the screening also loved the visuals but felt the story was a bit dull, that they had seen it all before. Well, it's true that the story does wear its influences on its sleeve--a little \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" here, a little \\"Time Bandits\\" there, a lot of \\"Wizard of Oz\\" over here, not to mention a resemblance to Gaiman's own \\"Coraline.\\" But I'm just as familiar with those stories as anyone else, and the resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment of \\"MirrorrMask\\"--after all, it's what you do with a story that determines its success. And from moment to moment, there was enough innovation and cleverness, enough delight and wonder, to make the movie a positive delight. <br /> <br />When the movie came out in theaters I went to see it again, and there was a little girl about six years old in the row ahead of me who sat through the whole thing with eyes agog; then a friend of mine tried to show the DVD to her young son but he got completely creeped out by the spider-thingie. (Hey, in \\"Wizard of Oz\\" the moment when the Witch appears in the crystal ball had exactly the same effect on me--yet it lingered in memory, and when I got older I was drawn back and fell in love with the movie.  That's how this stuff works.)  \\"MirrorMask\\"was probably a little too wild to be a full-out commercial success; but I bet it's going to have a long, long shelf life on DVD as people pull it out to tell their friends \\"Wait till you see this.\\"
1590581814|2.0|Drive constantly switches between timeframes which becomes extremely annoying at times and not only hinders the smooth flow of the story but also the enjoyment. With Drive not written in chronological order you've got to read for a while before you know when each chapter is taking place.  Even if written in timeframe order the story is pretty average at best.<br /><br />In Drive the main character named Driver works as a stunt driver at LA movie shoots.  He also makes a bit of cash on the side as a getaway driver for criminals but emphasises that all he does is drive.  As you would expect amongst the criminal world, doing the honourable thing doesn't always apply and there comes a time when Driver's choice is either kill or be killed.  Then Driver must reap vengeance on those who turned on him as wiping them out is the only way to ensure his own survival.<br /><br />Much better novels of this type of genre can be found by other authors such as Richard Stark's (a.k.a Donald E Westlake)Parker series or James Pattinson's (Pattinson not Patterson) many novels.
B00030590I|5.0|With indelible impressions of the subtle beauty and depth of \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\" and \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" still fresh on the mind, this viewer approached \\"Hero\\" with caution, anticipation and wonder ... could another WuXia film leave a similar impact? The answer is a joyful and reverberating  \\"Yes!\\" The special features section of the DVD is just as important to view as the film itself. It is important to understand how the film was born and came to life on the screen. First, the decision to include some of the best and most famous Asian actors and actresses is highly critical. The fact that it took almost 24 months to complete the screen play, which was written by the Director, Zhang Yimou along with Li Feng and Ang Bin is most amazing and unique. It is a joy to hear Zhang Yimou, the director explain his view point in writing this unique story, which is crucial to understanding the deeper aspects of human nature. The creative process comes alive and it is just as fascinating to hear and understand as viewing the stunning film and scenery of different locations in China ...<br /><br />The story line is subtle and simple: a Chinese swordsman is brought before the King of a province of China to explain how he managed to kill three assassins and arrive before the King within 10 paces of his throne. The king analyzes his story and through keen questioning, in a most legal and lawyer-like fashion, he dissects the truth. There is Confucious-like depth to the manner in which the story unfolds as the King is told the three different versions of the swordsman, Nameless's experiences.<br /><br />Each story has one of these colors associated with it: red, blue, or green. Different aspects of the story are emphasized with other visual artistic wonders, for example, leaves falling during a fight between Nameless and Snow. In the final scene our \\"Hero\\" b helps unite China for future generations. The meaning and depth of the story and visual cinematography are priceless and beyond word descriptions.

B00005AQE8|5.0|I wouldn't say this is the greatest rap album ever mainly because there are other great albums that in my opinion are on the same level as this. In fact I don't really think there could be a greatest rap album of all time but rather a few albums which are the greatest rap albums of all time. Those albums would be NWA's Straight Outta Compton, Dr Dre's The Chronic, Snoop Doggy Dogg's Doggystyle, Nas's Illmatic, Biggie's Ready 2 Die, Tupac's Me Against The World, Tupac's All Eyez On Me, Tupac's The Don Killuminati and quite possibly more I haven't mentioned. This album is just krazy. I love Tupac, love Deathrow, this is simply amazingly. This is certainly his best produced album with top producers such as Dr Dre and Daz who give great g funk beats. There are many classics here though of course its not without fillin with tracks like What'z Ya Phone# but it is a double disc and plenty of classics such as Ambitionz Az A Ridah, All About U, How Do U want It, 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted, I can stop now because i'd just be naming just about every track on the album. Certainly make up for those. Then can you believe that this was made in just two weeks, two weeks!! Wooooh, that's skill. To sum it up this basically shows the real thuggish Tupac. There are songs with real gangsterisms like the collabaration with Snoop on 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted. However though this is definitely a gangsta rap album, Pac put in some of of his deep and caring tracks like Life Goes On. Of course there is a slight let down from talentless guest appearances which appear mostly on the second disc but overall this still remains a five star album.  Now all you rap fans better have already copped this but if your wondering whether this is good or not, trust me you will not regret buying this. R.I.P. Tupac Shakur
0553212737|5.0|In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate.  Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys.  This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful.  In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry.  But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character.  It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is.  And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.   <br /> <br />For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself.  Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This differenceis more a matter of degree than in kind.  In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic.  The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book.  The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play.  Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself.  The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not.  Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers. <br />
0316172324|1.0|I was recommended to buy this book at a user experience session at a web conference.  <br /> <br />After reading it all the way through, I felt that the core of the information would have made a good 3000-5000 word piece in a journal, with a few much shorter examples.  <br /> <br />In fact as I was reading it, I found myself thinking the annecdotes were too long and can we get back to some real content please. <br /> <br />The annecdotes do illustrate the point well though, especially some of the ealier ones like the study on married couples. This was interesting, but I felt the book did drag on after that without adding much more.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|Corinne Bailey Rae's initial offering to those of us \\"across the pond\\" is incredible. I picked it up cause I thought she had a nice voice the few times I heard her first single. I was completely blown away by the entire CD. The song writing, while clearly directed at a younger (than myself) audience, conveys her beautiful voice in a way that makes me very hopeful for what she will sound like when she matures as a songwriter and a young woman.  Great Job Corinne!!! If you're reading this review and you don't already have this CD do yourself a favor and buy 2!

B0000TB01Y|5.0|Everything about this original cast album is incredible - from vocals and score to story and performance.  Extra musicians were comissioned for this recording, and it shows.  The orchestra sounds terrific, but it's only the terrific orchestral score to begin with that makes the music what it is.   <br /> <br />Vocally, the cast was perfectly chosen, and all the performers do a great job interpreting the music and performing it.  The tunes are incredibly catchy, but they're so fun I can't get tired listening to them.  They are melodic and at many times quite beautiful - such as \\"As Long as You're Mine\\" and \\"For Good.\\"  But the orchestrations, the orchestrations, the orchestrations, and the melodies are what carry the soundtrack.  The singers only help it along.  But that's not to say they're not good at what they do. They are over and beyond the call of duty on this recording.  In my opinion it's pretty much perfect. Though generally light in tone, there are plenty of serious undertones in the story as well as music that show why \\"Wicked\\" is so appealing; it's not a sugary-sweet musical, nor is is sugar-coated.  It is genuinely heartwarming-it points out the importance of friendship and love-but it also tells about both the good and bad of life and humanity.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|Gnarls Barkley, St. Elsewhere - How to describe this record is almost as difficult as rating it.  Gnarls Barkley is foremost the united collaboration of DJ Extraordinaire Danger Mouse and Cee Lo, the gospel-driven soulful-skilled vocalist.  But the real genius in GB is their ability to tackle up to four different genres of music, wrap it into one package, and present it as a trademark of sound.  No doubt, there will be many artists in the next few years who will paid tribute, as reviewers stamp a \\"Gnarls Barkley\\" approval upon them.  Songs range from frenetic rave-like funk (Go-Go Gadget Gospel), to mainstream pop with interesting hooks and feel (Crazy), to bouncy covers of the alternative/punk (the extremely well done cover of the Violent Femmes \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\"). The record at first listen seems to jerk back and forth between introspective slow tempo jams, and go-go techno dance spins, but after a few listens, the record seems to coagulate together into one rousing tribute to \\"something different.\\"  Backed by normally an 11 piece band, including string section, Gnarls Barkley has taken the stage dressed as a uniform homage to Star Wars, What's Happening, the medical profession (including Dr. Feelgood as their opening number) and sorted others.  However you describe it, it's good.  Grade: A
B000G759LW|3.0|While artists should be recognized when trying to create different sounds and acknowledge certain eras...it should also be considered that the reason why that era isn't very popular now is because there's truly not a need to hear it or relive it.

The only songs I really enjoy are \\"On Our Way\\" and \\" Without You\\"...It shouldn't have been 2 discs. :(<br /><br />Update: After watching her perform this songs live...I really do enjoy the first disc alot...the 2nd disc not so much still because i'm not really into 30.40.50's music :)

B000002UA2|4.0|Obscured by Clouds, the 1972 soundtrack to the obscure French film (set in Papua New Guinea) La Vallée composed and performed by a little-known band called Pink Floyd. Should be fun. <br /> <br />The opening cut is the album's title track, an instrumental entitled \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" (yes, title track, see?) which is pleasant, very much Pink Floyd-sounding, but at the same time an obvious departure from the stylings of 1971's Meddle - the immediate predecessor to Obscured by Clouds - that manages to suggest both Meddle and 1973's The Dark Side of Moon - the immediate successor to Obscured by Clouds - without being either. It defines its own sound and informs the listener that this album is not just a watered-down version of another classic Gilmour/Waters Floyd album. It's quite nice, really. <br /> <br />It was probably a mistake to put one instrumental right after another, but it's a soundtrack. What can you expect, really? The second track is called \\"When You're In\\" and really doesn't stand out a whole lot to me. It's pleasant, drum-and-guitar-driven mood music, but it doesn't have the interest of \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" and is no match for the complexities of \\"Echoes\\", \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", or \\"On the Run\\" and is fairly repetative. Very repetative, actually. <br /> <br />\\"Burning Bridges\\" is not instrumental, but has a pastoral, meandering tone and rather subdued vocals that do progress in volume and clarity further into the song. It has interesting lyrics, but definitely isn't a favorite of mine or an album standout track. It's all right. Notably, it still manages to rise above most else that Pink Floyd had done by 1972 since 1967's \\"Lucifer Sam\\" off of the Syd Barrett-directed The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. <br /> <br />The next song is an unexpected blues-rocker called, improbably, \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" Now, it's hard to be truly sure what the gold is in, but it's a rocking good song. Unlike with Meddle's eerie, experimentally tropical \\"San Tropez\\", \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" does not sound disturbing as a result of it being a cross-genre Floyd performance. You know, as a matter of fact, if the band had played around with more bluesy arrangements after running out of atmospheric soundscapes and sonic textures to explore in their later days, both with Roger Waters and after his departure, their post-The Wall material might have been a little more classic and well-liked. This song ends too soon, unfortunately. It feels oddly incomplete. <br /> <br />If you thought \\"The Gold It's In The...\\" was a strange title for a song, \\"Wot's...Uh The Deal\\" beats it out there. It's a bit dreamier and floatier than The Dark Side of the Moon and the other classic album pieces, and the lyrics aren't quite as thoughtful, but it's still a nice song. <br /> <br />\\"Mudmen\\" starts off as another unassuming instrumental before opening up into a familiar-sounding musical assault from Rick Wright aboard his toy, the distortedish organ memorable from The Dark Side of the Moon's \\"Any Colour You Like\\". It was about at this point that The Wall yielded to Obscured by Clouds on my ranking of favorite Pink Floyd albums, giving it the number four slot behind, in ascending order, Animals, Wish You Were Here, and The Dark Side of the Moon. Interesting, yes? <br /> <br />And then the next song, \\"Childhood's End\\", one I'm familiar with and have heard a few times before, is just plain incredible. The lyrics are intelligent and driving, the vocals are biting and have a brilliant edge to them, the musicianship is staggering as always, and the composition is very effective indeed. Definitely my favorite cut off this album and among my top ten favorite Pink Floyd songs, which I won't even try to rank. <br /> <br />\\"Free Four\\" is all right, kind of strange for me. It's a jaunty pop tune that begins to slide into the \\"San Tropez\\" rut of just being too \\"out there\\" by not being \\"out there\\" enough. It may not make any sense, but it's Pink Floyd, and really itdoes. Despite the upbeat, pop sort of sound, there's those long, penetrating notes that hit regularly to remind you that this really is still Pink Floyd. Oh, and the lyrics are about death. <br /> <br />The next song is a ballad piece called \\"Stay\\", which might be pretty moving in the context of the film. I should try to hunt down an English-subtitled version someday. As part of Obscured by Clouds, though, \\"Stay\\" isn't immediately affecting or catching. It's rather like \\"Burning Bridges\\" in that regard. <br /> <br />\\"Absolutely Curtains\\" closes the album, an instrumental with a very typically Roger Waters title. Rick Wright again demonstrates his invaluable keyboard skills, which might be just what put this album over The Wall (which lacks Wright completely). It ends with a Papuan tribal chant, probably from the movie itself, thus echoing \\"Fearless\\" from Meddle. And from there, it's just moving on into The Dark Side of the Moon and beyond. <br /> <br />Obscured by Clouds is a soundtrack, so the segue of one track into the next familiar to those listeners of classic Pink Floyd is completely absent. This is sad. Also sad is how some of the songs just seem to be abbreviated. The album also occasionally just floats, more at the beginning and end than in the middle (which is easily the strongest part of the album, the meat to the beginning and end's bread), but no more - and in fact, less - than Meddle with its peaceful, unassuming arrangements and melodies. <br /> <br />I also like it better than The Wall, probably because of the keyboard work of Rick Wright and the vocals of David Gilmour. Funny, eh?

B000FSME1A|2.0|Apocalypse Now is a masterpiece of filmaking and no film like it will ever be made again.  I went to the theatrical premiere in '79 with my parents when I was a precocious seven years old.  I remember my dad bringing home the press kit with the tickets inside and he had to explain to me what the Viet Nam war was all about before we went. My parents were afraid that I wouldn't understand and would be traumatized by what I saw. I was completely blown away by this film even at that innocent age and it burned a lasting impression into me like napalm.  I got it.<br /><br />Apparently Paramount didn't.  The Complete Dossier is anything but.  If you don't already have the original (and far superior) 1979 theatrical film in your library that has been out-of-print and impossible to find since Redux has been on the market for the last 5 years, then by all means, buy it for that reason alone.  For the aficionado, however, it's a money grab.  First of all, I cannot understand why anyone would make such a boneheaded decision to put both versions of the film on the same dual-layer DVD-9 thus compromising bit rate quality and precious disc space requiring them to be interrupted onto two discs!?!?!?

B00005JOQS|5.0|I grew up with the Superman franchise. To me, Superman is the single greatest superhero of all time. Not only is Superman entertaining, he's also a symbol of right and moral certainty. I had been waiting for a new Superman movie since \\"Superman IV\\" came out in 1987, and when Superman Returns came out I was a bit nervous going into the theater. I had hoped Bryan Singer, who is no doubt a great director, would stay true not only to who Superman was but also to the first four films starring the late, great Christopher Reeve. I was truly delighted to find that \\"Superman Returns\\" featured nearly the same soundtrack as the Reeve films, quoted several lines from \\"Superman: The Movie\\" (Reeve's 1978 debut as Superman), and that Brandon Routh bore a striking resemblance to Reeve, and thus to Superman. Routh does an amazing job as the Man of Steel, filling the shoes left by Reeve quite well. Singer even managed to resurrect Marlon Brando as Jor El, Superman's Kryptonian father. The special effects were amazing, and the movie also has a lot of heart. We as an audience got to take a look at the vulnerable, introspective side of Superman, as he learns that the world seems to have moved on in his absence, and almost forgotten him. \\"Superman Returns\\" has a very touching, very human side. All in all, I loved this movie, and Bryan Singer did a truly amazing job. He exceeded even my best expectations. There can be no doubt among anyone with any common sense that Superman is back in a big way. <br /> <br />Matt Decker, New York City

I enjoyed it so much, my husband finally started thumbing through it when I did manage to put it down in order to do the mundane chores like laundry and cooking dinner. I particularlly liked the way the chapters alternated among the band and other various voices. That made it real to me because I wasn't having to buy into just one author's version of the truth. My favorite chapters came from Mick Mars and Vince Neil. Definitely a worthwhile read for any rock fan.

I belive owning this set was neccesarry because this movie started the next phase in trekdom. Not only did it reunite the crew of the U.S.S Enterprise, you also had new shows that came sometime later. this where it all began.  <br /> I liked the documentaries on how the new film took off. I was also amazed to see some of the scenes that were ommited. My favorite one is when the ship was in V'gers great big abode, Uhura says: \\"Its's like one big ship\\" Spock replies: (something like) It's 1 thousand of ships\\" Can't remember verbatem but was something like that. <br /> Overall, not the best trek film, this dvd set is worth purchasing for completion of a collection and the other attributes.
