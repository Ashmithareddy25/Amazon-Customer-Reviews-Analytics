B00005JM09|4|The first thing you're likely to think as the movie starts is, \\"this sure doesn't feel like a Terminator movie.\\" And I attribute this mostly the absolutely horrible soundtrack. Brad Fiedel's famous and haunting score of man vs machine is no where to be found. Beltrami does an arrangement of it once...at the end credits. Now I realize that most movie-goers care less about musical scores, but the absense of Fiedel is as strong as if you were going to make a Star Wars sequel and not use John Williams classic score.<br />If your a real fan of the franchise, the second thing you'll notice is a true lack of James Cameron. I must admit, that many of the shots and the cinematography appears right out of the T2 playbook, but it's important to remember Cameron didn't only direct the film, he wrote it. T3 suffers from a real lack of intelligent plotting that is one of Cameron's strongpoints. For the most part, action scene happen because... well they just needed action scenes.<br />The story centers around a now adult John Conner, aimlessly making his way through life now that Judgement Day has successfully been avoided (see T2). But we find out of course that it hasn't, it's just been prolonged 10 years. In this film, Skynet is about to go operational and machines are about to take over the world just as Reese described in T1. But the target isn't only Conner this time. New character Kate Brewster is John's future second in command, and it's she who this time sends back the antiquated T-800 to protect both her and John. The new menace is the T-X which is even more advanced (and somehow less advanced) then the T-1000 from T2.<br />The plot is pretty formulaic, and follows the traditional Terminator style. There's definately nothing cerebral about it, and you know pretty quickly into the film just how the T-X is gonna bite it thanks to some pretty obvious forshadowing. Most of it is just an excuse to have Arnold kicking [butt] against the virtually indestructable T-X that should have destroyed him in the first 15-minutes (she's an anti-terminator terminator). At least in this film, Arnold's Terminator is much more a killing machine than the \\"now I know why you cry\\" touchy-feely Terminator from T2.<br />Despite all the flaws that are glaring once you stop and think about this film when it's over, it's still hard not to enjoy it. On it's own, it's a pretty fun hollywood blockbuster. As a sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi franchises of all time, it's lacking. But fortunately, it's good enough that you're glad to have it rather than no sequel at all. I particularly enjoyed the ending. While not executed as well as it could have been, it brings a lot more meaning to the story rather than just the same old, \\"how they gonna defeat the terminator this time?\\" type of plot. It leaves a huge opening for a sequel, but also serves as a fitting ending to the series, should this be it.<br />All in all, I have to give T3 a positive review. Even though the James Cameron fan in me questions much of this film, it's still entertaining, and that's all this film sets out to do. It's a fun roller coaster ride that shouldn't be missed in the theatre if you at all enjoy big action blockbusters.ould have destroyed him in the first 15-minutes (she's an anti-terminator terminator).

B00IKZX1ZI|5|I absolutely love frozen free fall, but it is really challenging once you get to level 13. The characters look so real, but the &quot;too bads&quot; realmake me feel bad. The amazings, good jobs, and the wonderfuls  make  me feel good . I love the movie frozen  and I bet you do too so if you do this game is the dream!!!!
030746363X|5|I loved The 4-Hour Body enough to hit the blog and see author Tim Ferriss's plea that we help him crush George \\"The Decider\\" Bush's Amazon stats between two kettlebell-swing sculpted buttocks.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Body's potential contributions to your life: great(er) times in the sack, a higher sperm count (or sperm facilitation count, for the un-testicled), improved athleticism and a hotter body.<br /><br />Compare that to George Bush's specialities: complicity in torture, a fractured economy and a scrambled marshaling of the forces of ignorance for a war on terror that's terrifying with very little help from actual terrorists.<br /><br />I'm actually buying both digital and paper copies of The 4-Hour Body for both portability and comfy home reading, because using it has enormous potential for awesomeness, or -- even better -- potential for helping me unleash new levels of my own awesome. It's an amazing, unique piece of work, and if you read it, you'll see why.<br /><br />I'm a competitive kickboxer and I've dabbled in various strength protocols with no noticeable performance benefits for my sport. More recently I've been hemming and hawing over Cross-Fit and paleo, but they seem to demand commitment, unpleasantness and flashback of high-school gym class for rather nebulous returns.<br /><br />4HB has already helped me articulate what I want, as well as sharing some blueprints for ways to get it. I now know that I want clear instructions and assessments that make sense over the short term. I want to get stronger but spend more time having fun (kicking people in the head) than dragging heavy things around just because I'm supposed to. I don't want to suffer any more than I have to to make weight. And, I want a cure for my ABD (Asian Butt Disease.)<br /><br />It looks like I may get some things I really want from The 4-Hour Body. And if you have the relatively unusual combination of open-mindedness and an ability to follow directions, you might, too.
B008JMKN4Y|4|This is amazingly beautiful! Like a roller coaster ride of love. When I started reading this book, I literally did not put it down (except for bathroom breaks), that's how much I was attached to the characters. The author caught my attention right away from chapter 1, like I wanted to know what's gonna happen next. I like the way the relationship of the characters started slow because I got the chance to know Travis and then finally fell in love with him as if I am Abby - the heroine. Travis is someone whom you wanted to avoid but like a temptation that's hard to resist. He is not a typical boy next door but a bad boy who loves Abby like a drug - very intense. Abby wants somebody who is the total opposite of Travis, she is brave and doesn't care what other people think about her but she is afraid of her own feelings, she hides her emotions that sometimes its so frustrating.<br /><br />How I wish the author wrote their first night together more passionately and hot because that's how she potrayed Travis' character, a badboy-playboy, but then I thought that she probably doesnt want to focus on that area because it is not an erotic novel but a love story (BUT STILL..... I know for sure the readers will enjoy it more).<br /><br />This is not a quick short story, it's long and entertaining, with some action/adventure in between, and of course a lot of sweet and giddy moments. There are also other interesting characters around Travis and Abby that made this book more enjoyable to read. You will not be bored, I kid you not I read this for 5 straight hours and the next day I tried to read some parts that I thought I missed. I love the fact that its on my Kindle, I can re-read it again anytime I want. Buy it and you will not regret it!
B00GY0HJ4K|5|I enjoy this new game. It is interesting and challenging. There is always more than one way to reach the goal.

B000Q6GUW0|5|I have seen many tv series and this is if not the best then its right up there with the best . This is a series that is addictive and I honestley feel like I can't stop watching . Michael C. Hall is a gifted actor I first saw him in Six Feet Under another awesome series . I got this series ( Dexter ) on Blu-Ray witch is definetly better than DVD but not amazingly so . I feel that anyone needs to at least try this series or else they will be really missing out . The writters really keep you wanting more and maybe its the people behind this series that are the ones that need to be recognized the most .
B0091W6QZG|4|Good movie. Worse time to watch.
B00KG41CZC|2|Maybe I am too old for this kind of movie but I always loved Legos. The plot was ok no complaints. The characters were just fine also. The movie was not great but my problem with it was (I will try to keep from giving too much away) the bud guy who killed Lego people did not get punished. No jail or prison. Yes its just a kids movie but why would you want a kid see the bad guy get away with murder?
B00GH4RKYM|2|Just dumb.  Really goofy re-write of the superman story and poorly acted.  I'm not a movie snob and like many of the &#34;cartoon/comic genre&#34; flics, but this one is just bad.  If you feel obligated to watch it, may want to wait for it to go to Prime, which I'd bet won't be long.
B000002NHN|5|I love the song 'Mummer's Dance'. To me this song has a very wiccan feel to it and I like it:) It invokes images of black-robed women dancing in a circle in a fog-shrouded, moonlit forest.....<br />Lovely, enchanting music:)
B00005JO9J|5|I didn't want to like this show but I'm so hooked.  I started watching a few shows into the season so I just had to get this DVD.  If you're a casual watcher, this will get you up to date

B0042U94UQ|5|For Christmas we got this and &#34;Despicable Me 2&#34; (the original one) for my eight year old daughter. We take her to see pretty much EVERY family-friendly movie that comes to the theaters, and I have to say, the Despicable Me series holds a special place in our hearts- not only is it wildly appealing to children, both movies are also very, very funny. And both films stand the test of repeated watching.<br /><br />Out of both films, I like this one best- it's slightly more clever and &#34;sharp&#34; than the sequel. I still think it's one of the funniest films we've seen in the past several years (kid-friendly and non-kid-friendly movies included)- there are things in &#34;Despicable Me&#34; that will appeal to kids and then there are little things included throughout the movie that are designed to appeal to the grown-ups who watch the movie with them that the kids don't get. I kinda like that.<br /><br />Whether you have seen this movie a zillion times or you haven't had a chance to watch it yet, I highly recommend just going ahead and adding it to your movie collection. It's silly, clever fun. And sometimes that makes for the very best movies.
0441009425|5|I am a huge fan of Reynolds and his use of actual science within his novels. I got the Audible version and think that John Lee does a great job of narrating the series. In the beginning it may seem a little hard to follow along since the story jumps between characters and time periods, but after a while you get used to it, and the stories eventually merge into one larger story. I suggest reading/listening this after Chasm City. Even though Chasm City is it's own complete story, some of the events/characters are references in Revelation space. It won't mess up the story if you don't read it after Chasm City, but I think that it gives you a better since of things.<br /><br />I would read the first few books in this order:<br />-Chasm City<br />-Revelation Space<br />-Galactic North<br />-Redemption Ark<br />-Absolution Gap
B00A6CCF0K|5|The long awaited continuation of the Shining. Nice to revisit the characters and find out what has happened in their lives.
B007SGM084|4|I liked the books, there was just a small part that became boring.<br /><br />Here are my seven words that I have to write
B00G3L6KQI|5|An awesome end to an amazing series!  The imagery created by this author is outstanding.  I could not only see the scene as they were depicted,  but could also feel and smell them.  Outstanding work! I look forward to your next series.....and with any luck, a series of films as well.
B000002KHB|4|Along with The Doors, Deep Purple are notable in being a band which made memorable music featuring the organ. Whilst I don't think that this album surpasses their \\"In rock\\" album, it's not far behind it.      The iconic song:      Smoke on the water - iconic for both the guitar riff and drumming. Apparently some music shops have banned guitar browsers from playing the riff...it's been done so ofen. Did hear within the last year or two that the world record for most guitarists playing at one time, together, had them doing this song's riff. Musically, this song has a cool organ, great guitar solo, cool bass guitar and I like the 'chopping' sound effect later on in the song. A flatmate once taught me how to play the riff just using notes on the sixth string...even though I don't play guitar and haven't attempted this 'feat' for years, I'm pretty sure I could quickly rediscover how to do that again. Iconic for a reason.      Next best:       Highway star - has that rock'n'roll syntax which becomes heavy metal at times. Good riffing, bass, organ and operatic (soaring) notes from the talented lead singer, Ian Gillan.  More coolness lies in the baroque elements to the song, like the lead guitar and organ parts, at times.       Then:      Space truckin' - the organ intro to this song reminds me of an Australian pop song, actually (released years later though)...The Rockmelons' \\"New groove\\", I think (as far as the keyboard and bass guitar goes). A song notable for its drum solo. High concept lyrics with a cool tone to the drum later, and the solo, like I said. A rocking song with a Gothic riff on the keyboard.      The rest:      Maybe I'm a Leo - maybe a Cream like blues song, but I find it more engaging that Cream's efforts in that genre early on in their career. Mid-tempo track. Features the organ.    Pictures of home - frenetic drum intro and outro. Expressive lead guitar (mid-tempo). Features the organ. Has a \\"Strange kind of woman\\" vibe to it...another Deep Purpletrack, from the previous year.     Never before - bluesy rock.  Bass, with some interesting drumming at times. More organ features. Riff and licks at times aren't bad.    Lazy - mostly an instrumental...for over half of its running time, in any case. Starts with an organ which sounds over the top, then gets boogie, then rock'n'roll syntax later. Nice keyboard parts at times.         Recommendations:        Deep Purple - In rock    Black Sabbath - Paranoid    Led Zeppelin - IV    AC/DC - T.N.T.    AC/DC - Back in black    Midnight Oil - 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,3,2,1    Midnight Oil - Red sails in the sunset        For something different:      Deep Purple - Concerto for group and orchestra.   Has well known Deep Purple songs performed live, but also new classical compositions by members of the band.  If you like interesting drumming, some of the drumming on the classical pieces are good. I've reviewed that album on this site.
B005ZOBNOI|5|No book has ever made me cry. I am soaked in tears from a story that wrapped me up and shared itself with me. I never put it down from start to finish. Thank you, John Green.
B003O86FMW|5|I was obsessed with this book. It keeps me wondering what's going to happen next. Kudos to Suzanne Collins. ALTHOUGH this is a very good book it does contain descriptive violence and blood. I recommend this book to readers ages 12+

B00F88H5K2|4|Excelkent performances! Amazing costumes. A view of Liberace's persona and motivation. Michael Douglas really had Liberace down the omit difference being the quality if Liberaces voice was a little different, but that is to be expected.
B00MHT49KO|5|This movie was well worth the wait, granted it was torture waiting for it but that's another matter. The Wind Rises literally goes back to the bare basics of how animated films were made, there is nothing fancy about this movie just seer beauty. And although kids probably wouldn't understand or relate to the movie to much it's still a must have for your collection. It's 2 hours of watching a dream come to life even if the dream doesn't have a happy ending the movie teaches you that even in the hardships it's still better to have lived to see your dream come to life than to leave it on a piece of paper on a sketch pad. Truly a beautiful, heartfelt end to a very successful career for Miyazaki.
B00LD1OHE0|5|I loved this book. It made me want to high five on character hug two other and punch two others. I always feel a connection to Colleen's book. Love them so much. They consume me for a whole day.  This one did just that.

B00M856DSS|4|First time I heard this song  ( Take me to church)  it was haunting to me and I found I could NOT stop listening.  I was even more curious to hear the rest of the album once I saw and heard the duet with Hozier and Annie Lennox ...
6302206294|1|Prince of Thieves -- hmmm, they borrow the Muslim Merry Man from Robin of Sherwood, and some of the magic and plot details. And they borrowed from some other sources. Of course &quot;borrowing&quot; is a long-standing  Hollywood tradition, and it would have been forgivable if Costner's Robin  Hood had even an ounce of charisma, or if the dialogue wasn't wincingly bad  (&quot;Have I wronged you in a past life, Will Scarlet?&quot;) or if the  direction of the film had been even. Big spectacle with little or no brains  behind it. I do like Little John (Nick Brimble) and his wife Fanny though.  However, for a really good Robin Hood film of 1991, I recommend &quot;Robin  Hood&quot; starring Patrick Bergin. And of course, you can always buy the  Errol Flynn  classic.

B000002UYZ|5|This two-disc album is part 1 of the definitive Best of the Beatles album, the second part being The Beatles 1967-1970.<br />The Beatles 1962-1966 is a fantastic tribute to beautiful musicof this great pioneering band in rock and roll, which dominated the musical scene of the 1960's with one magnificent hit after another. Listening to the Beatles really has a feel-good quality about it. In fact all these songs are masterpieces in the history of music.<br />My personal favourites are:<br /><br />I Want to Hold Your Hand<br />All My Loving<br />Hard Day's Night<br />Ticket to Ride<br />Yesterday<br />We Can Work It Out<br />Nowhere Man<br /> Michelle<br /> Paperback Writer<br />Eleanor Rigby<br />Yellow Submarine<br />Definitely a good choice for your first Beatles combination and an intro to why the 60's generation loved the Beatles so.<br />A good starter kit for new fans and a good piece of memorabilia for old fans revisiting the Beatles.

B0089EHWQE|4|There is only one reason that I cannot give this highly enjoyable, romantic and interesting book five stars: I hated and disagreed with its conclusion. Having friends who are severely disabled, I know the type of life that can be led and it is nowhere near as depressing as what was painted here.<br /><br />Still---I loved this book and found it compelling and very well written!
B00DR0PDNE|5|I really like this thing. Set up is a breeze, assuming you have a tablet, smartphone, or iPod. I'm less familiar with how setup works through the Chrome browser.<br /><br />The idea that anyone you allow on your wireless network can control your TV with their device is genius, as is the app-centric controls (you already probably know how to use Netflix, YouTube, and Hulu etc. on your phone - now you just hit the &#34;cast&#34; button from within the app.<br /><br />More apps are added every month or so, and with the planned international expansion, it seems like it's only gaining traction.

B009Y7YC2M|1|this game needs you to have a microphone and a as you the kindle does not have a microphone so you cant do anything.
0800179501|5|This movie is way beyond the physical realm about Karate.  Though I am not an expert in Karate yet, it brings the spiritual essence of what Karate is about.  Mr. Miyagi is the type of teacher every kid (and even adult) wishes one can encounter when they are being coached.  Someone who takes a first glance of how Mr. Miyagi looks like would think he looks weird, not appealing ... yet, this man in the movie is full of spiritual wisdom, integrity of mind and spirit with mindfulness tools all wrapped around him.  Breathing, balancing (essentially it is the combination of centering and grounding) ... what a great way to teach kids and adults of how life is about.  Sometimes one needs to have faith about the teacher if teachers/coaches show competency, integrity, respect and compassion to self and others.  I am so glad Mr. Miyagi talks about Karate is about the mind (calmness of the mind) and the heart (full of integrity and compassion), not about the stomach (stomach... in Asian culture means it stores anger and fear ... also called as \\"chi of anger\\"... the air of anger and fear).    Though I still have to say ... 2 months of dedication and commitment to win a championship part is misleading... no matter how hard core the training is.  To master the skills of a black belt level takes some years of devotion and constant commitment.  This portion of the story line might mislead kids and adults about the fast-food pill of success... which is far from true in real life situation.  To master any skills (not just Karate), requires constant commitment, following through with a coach who demonstrates competency, integrity and compassion.  Yet, I suppose a movie can only do so much in bringing spiritual awareness about body, mind and soul.           Overall, it is a very spiritual awakening, inspiring movie.  Great job to every actor, actress and the crew behind the scenes filming.  This is certainly a film that deserves the applause from the many audiences.
B008JFUTUY|5|This story will give you chills and touch your heart. A modest poet and talented performer who thought he'd had his shot at fame and fortune and missed. The money never mattered, only his music. Were the 40 years between his 2 albums and his rediscovery wasted, or did the continuing love and appreciation of his music by the South African people make him richer in ways he couldn't imagine? Experiencing their heartfelt admiration at his first concert in South Africa was amazing. How many people get to experience anything close to this in their lives?<br /><br />js

B005HED1BE|5|The show that started it all lives on. I never tire of seeing this series. It remains the benchmark against which all syfy TV series are measured. With all the advances in CGI and other special effects, one still has to be impressed with what Star Trek accomplished even when the studio cut back on the budget and wrote them off. The fans have remained loyal and would not allow the concept to drift in space.
B00335EQ0E|4|An all time Disney Classic, it is just one of those all time must see movie, would highly recomend to any one who hasn't seen it or to anyone that has not seen it for a while
0156027321|4|Well written novel that stirs your interest. I love being taken to settings and ideas that seize me and Martel did a great job doing this. Pi is one of those characters you'll miss (Richard Parker too) once the experience has you identifying with his theme in Chapter 94 of \\"concluding things\\" and of a good-bye with closure. This novel has multiple thematic travels to walk and ponder. It did not make me believe in God though to a greater extent than I presently do, as it foretold...but it did underscore my ever-present trust in His Providence and in the triumph of faith amidst adversities. The humorous elements were refreshing and added to the humanism. I loved the contrast of the two stories at the end and the insight we shared with Pi's true experiences as the Japanese stayed rooted to their \\"dry, yeastless factuality\\" (Chap 21 & 22). Leaven for the soul!
B003DZX3SA|5|Bought this movie brand new. Came double wrapped in excellent condition. My one and a half year old daughter loves it!
B000M4RG42|5|With Flags Of Our Fathers receiving so many negative reviews, I hesitated in buying the DVD.  Still, I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood as both an actor and a director, plus I love movies about World War II.  I purchased the film and found myself really liking it.  I was surprised.  Maybe it's because I wasn't expecting big things to happen.  Anyway, I had no trouble with the flash-backs, or the character development, or the fact that the battle for Iwo Jima wasn't covered as heavily as was the effort to raise money with the rallies for War Bonds.  I had no problem following the movie and was caught up in it within the first few minutes.  I thought the performances were excellent by all three of the main actors (Jesse Bradford, Ryan Phillippe and Adam Beach), and that Clint Eastwood did a marvelous job of conveying the fact that war is hell and that no soldier goes untouched by what he or she experiences.  In fact, the movie made me feel sad for what the real-life soldiers--John \\"Doc\\" Bradley, Rene Gagnon and Ira Hayes--had to go through once the war was over.  One day you're a celebrity, then the next day no one wants to return your phone calls.  I have nothing bad to say about Flags Of Our Fathers.  I really enjoyed this movie and look forward to seeing Letters From Iwo Jima when it comes out on DVD in a few months.  As far as extras go, there are none on this DVD.  If you want to buy it, my suggestion would be to wait for the Director's Cut, or the Special Two-disc Collector's Edition, to come out some time in the next couple of months.  Mr. Eastwood always does a Special Edition of his Oscar nominated films.  Though I'll always see Clint Eastwood as his most famous character, \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan, I have to admit to being extremely pleased with how he's done as a director.  This is one man who'll always make your day, if you give him the opportunity.  A great film maker with a great story to tell!

B00GFHFRNM|5|Vampire stories are so not my thing. Usually. I must be about the only book nerd not to have got past the first 20 pages of Twilight and although I love fairy tales and stories of magic I pretty much avoid anything to do with the bloodsuckers.<br /><br />So why I have absolutely loved this trilogy remains a bit of a mystery. Perhaps it is the combination of witches and vampires that has done it – there are just enough witches to water down the vampires. Or maybe it’s because these stories actively try not to be the stereotypical vampire story. I love this quote from Matthew (the main vampire character): ‘And before you ask, I can go outside during the day and my hair won’t catch fire in the sunlight. I’m Catholic and have a crucifix. When I sleep, which is not often, I prefer a bed to a coffin. If you try to stake me, the wood will likely splinter before it enters my skin... No fangs either. And one last thing: I do not, nor have I ever, sparkled’.<br /><br />The emphasis in these stories is not really on what a vampire must do to survive. Don’t get me wrong, that does of course form part of the story but its rarely gruesome and when it is, the gruesomeness is for a very specific reason. Far more important than blood and death are the incredibly detailed and rich story, and the characters themselves. To some extent, whether they are human, witch, vampire or daemon is actually irrelevant. Ultimately, this is actually a very beautifully told, though never simple nor mushy, love story: ‘To every question I have ever had, or ever will have, you are the answer’.<br /><br />It’s also very rare for me to enjoy the third in a series just as much as the first. Perhaps the fact that there has been a significant gap between all three volumes has helped. A Discovery of Witches (Volume #1) was published at the beginning of 2011; Shadow of Night about 18 months later in 2012 and this concluding volume in July 2014.<br /><br />The gap has also been helpful because these are not quick, easy reads. Well, they weren’t for me anyway. Each volume clocks up over 560 pages and contain so much rich and absorbing detail that I wanted to savour them slowly: ‘Dried herbs and flowers hung from twine strung up between the exposed rafters. I could identify some of them: the swollen pods of nigella, bursting with tiny seeds; prickly-topped milk thistle; long-stemmed mullein crowned with the bright yellow flowers that earned them the name of witches’ candles; stalks of fennel. Sarah knew every one of them by sight, touch, taste and smell’.<br /><br />In some ways, I wish I had re-read the first two volumes before embarking on this. I’m sure that there are things I missed as a result of not doing so, but it certainly didn’t detract from the read. Harkness is very good at reminding the reader of significant events in the past so that there were quite a few ‘Ah yes’ moments for me whilst reading this.<br /><br />With each successive book, the characters have somehow ‘settled’, grown and developed. The relationships between them have also deepened and I couldn’t help but be swept away in the story, just as I was when I first picked up A Discovery of Witches three years ago.  If you prefer not to know anything about the plot, I would advise you not to read past the blurb summary...<br /><br />**What the blurb says:<br /><br />After travelling through time in Shadow of Night, the second book in Deborah Harkness’s enchanting series, Historian and Witch Diana Bishop and Vampire Scientist Matthew Clairmont return to the present to face new crises and old enemies.<br /><br />At Matthew’s ancestral home at Sept-Tours, they reunite with the cast of characters from A Discovery of Witches, with one significant exception. But the real threat to their future has yet to be revealed, and when it is, the search for Ashmole 782 and its missing pages takes on even more urgency.<br /><br />In the trilogy’s final volume, Harkness deepens her themes of power and passion, family and caring, past deeds and their present consequences. In ancestral homes and University laboratories, using ancient knowledge and modern science, from the hills of the Auvergne to the palaces of Venice and beyond, the couple at last learn what the witches discovered so many centuries ago.**<br /><br />This book is mainly concerned with four issues and all the resultant issues that branch off from them. All are interrelated and in order to explore them fully, the narrator changes throughout. The issues are the traumatic death of Diana’s Aunt Emily and the circumstances surrounding it; Diana’s pregnancy; ‘Blood rage’ – a hereditary condition passed from vampire to vampire and lastly, the search for the secrets of the Book of Life and Ashmole 782 which continue in this book with even more urgency: ‘The witches believed that it contained the first spells ever cast, the vampires that it told the story of how they were first made. Daemons thought the book held secrets about their kind, too... My job is to find the missing pages... then put it back together so that we can use it as leverage’.<br /><br />Diana’s pregnancy inspires a great deal of interest in, and research into, ‘creature’ DNA and reproduction and this brings together a whole host of fabulous characters including Diana’s human best friend Dr Christopher Roberts, Matthew’s scientist second-in-command who is also a vampire, Miriam and a whole team of researchers with nicknames ranging from Mulder and Scully to Game Boy and Xbox.<br /><br />The desire to have a greater understanding of the differences between creatures, and creatures and humans are to some extent resolved by the end of this volume and this has an impact on the ‘covenant’ which I won’t go into here at risk of writing serious spoilers. ‘Creatures had long ago agreed to a covenant to minimize the risk of their world’s coming to human attention... The ninemember Congregation enforced the covenant and made sure that creatures abided by its terms’.<br /><br />Most of the wonderful characters from Book 2 return in Book 3 from those we love, to those we love to hate: ‘The mention of Benjamin’s name made my blood run cold. Matthew did have a son of that name. He was a terrifying creature, one whose madness was of unfathomable depth’. And the humour is still there too: ‘Peter Knox murdered Em. There’s a tree growing out of the fireplace. I’m pregnant with your children. We’ve been evicted from Sept-Tours. And the Congregations could show up at any minute and force us to separate. Does that sound fine to you?’<br /><br />The book is full of Castles, Vampires, Witches, dusty old tomes of magic and a firedrake called Corra. What on earth is there not to like? This book manages to combine a rip-roaring plot with brilliant characters but is also full to the brim of completely realistic description and detail – if you’re a mother, I challenge you to read the childbirth scene without panting! All in all I’m rather sorry to have finished it and am hoping that Harkness decides to forget the ‘trilogy’ description and write a fourth volume. The perfect curl-up-on-the-sofa-and-forget-about-everything, read.<br /><br />‘Our family had begun with the surprising love that developed between Matthew and me. It grew because our bond was strong enough to withstand the hatred and fear of others. And it would endure because we had discovered, like the witches so many centuries ago, that a willingness to change was the secret of survival’.
B005ZOBNOI|4|I'm not a tremendous fan of YA literature, but I must say this is one of the better ones. At times the author's voice and intellect overtook the adolescent voice of Hazel and sometimes Gus; however, I also appreciate intellect, literary allusion, and realism. My grandmother died of cancer and my mother is in remission, so I appreciate the author's attempt at treating cancer in a more raw, realistic way. It's hell, but it's life. Saccharine treatments of love and illness are what typically turn me off from YA and pop-lit, so I enjoyed the jabs made at cliches and the attempts to write &#34;love&#34; and &#34;loss&#34; differently (e.g. kissing in the Anne Frank house made me enjoy the juxtaposition of young love and impending death or the parallelism between Anne and Hazel). Overall, it was a very thoughtful meditation on life, young love, and death. The universe wants to be noticed, and indeed, I noticed it in this novel.
B00KA87GCW|4|EAsy and fast
B00006J3WH|5|I've been waiting for this forever and let me tell you, it was worth the wait. What could be better than watching James Marsters? Hearing him sing! OMG! James and Tony's vocals are incredible, as well as Amber Bensons. The whole cast sounds great, but I have to say my fav track is James' &quot;Rest In Peace&quot;. It's a great album, even more so if you love Buffy. Do yourself a favor and take a listen.
B00JDB4PEY|4|As we all know, we will never get another full &#34;Michael Jackson&#34; album again. In my opinion, Off The Wall, Thriller, Bad, and Dangerous are 4 of the greatest albums ever recorded in history. This &#34;Xscape&#34; album is much different, but honestly I do like it. Some songs they should of left alone but others I prefer the remix version.<br /><br />1.Love Never Felt So Good<br />The duet with Justin Timberlake &#34;Love Never Felt So Good&#34;, is the best song on the album. When I first heard it I was in total shock, I was expecting something dramatic. I also do love the demo and solo versions of the song. The song put Michael back in the Top 10 on Billboard Hot 100, his highest charting song since &#34;You Rock My World in 2001.<br /><br />2.Chicago<br />This is an awesome remix. I prefer the remix version over the original. This should of been the second single released instead of &#34;A Place With No Name&#34;, this had more sounding and could of also been a club hit.<br /><br />3.Loving You<br />When I first bought the album, this is one of the tracks I kept playing over and over. This was something different from Michael had ever recorded. I do prefer the original version of the song.<br /><br />4.A Place With No Name<br />I love the fact that Michael borrowed music from the classic song &#34;A Horse With No Name&#34;. I prefer the original mix of the song more than the remix. The song is good but I don't think it should of been released as a single from the album. That is also why it did not chart much around the world.<br /><br />5.Slave To The Rhythm<br />I think this was tied as my favorite track on the album with &#34;Love Never Felt So Good&#34;. This remix was terrific, I loved the version they used on the hologram performance. I was not a fan of the hologram itself but I loved the version they used. As soon as they used it for the performance, it should of been an immediate single and could of been another Top 10 hit for Michael but the recordcompany decided another choice. It did chart at #45 on the Hot 100 with digital downloads only, giving Michael his 50th chart hit.<br /><br />6.Do You Know Where Your Children Are?<br />This one grew on me. The original and the remix, it was just something about the song that did not click. As I listened to it more, it eventually grew on me and it is now one of my favorite tracks from this album.<br /><br />7.Blue Gangsta<br />This is an also a good track but probably my least favorite from the album. Also here you can see where Michael took a turn for a different writing method. It sounds like he was writing this at the same time as &#34;Smooth Criminal&#34;. Still a good track though.<br /><br />8.Xscape<br />This track might be a new sounding to some people but personally I heard this song years ago when it leaked in 2003. It was supposed to be released back in 2003 for an album but was shelved when the witch hunt went out for Michael. It is a good track, but I do prefer the remix version of it. Not a single type of release but surely a good album track.<br /><br />Michael Jackson will always be one of my favorite artist of all time. His style of music, his live entertainment, and emotions through song. Not just that, I love Michael as a person for who he was. You can say what you want about him but he was such a humble guy and a huge humanitarian. Through out all of his songs, you can hear a message of love. If you have an open heart, you can hear the messages. RIP MJ!
0553582038|3|As much as I have loved this series so far, I just couldn't get into a Feast for Crows. I totally understand that Mr. Martin is building more character levels and setting the background for future plots (gotta love all those twists and turns); however, I really lost interest. It is possible that Crows was a \\"let-down\\" for me after all the action in the first 3 in the series, or maybe I was too disinterested to catch onto the subtleties of the plot. Regardless, I have found there to be at least one \\"weak\\" book in every multi-book series I've read, but I've also found it rewarding to Keep Reading! George RR Martin is still a brilliant and inventive writer in my humble opinion.
B005K0HDGE|4|Since I grew up during these early years, it was easy for me to relate to the events and was interesting to follow through the eyes of the author.  I was expecting more drama like King`s movies!  All in all, 11/22/63,was a good read.
B006ZBRMOU|5|Since I've now read this series a number of times, I'm finally taking the time to do a review on each of the books this time. This is my favorite of the series.<br /><br />Ana and Christian are married and life for the most part is good. There's still questions concerning the helicopter accident, and Christian and Ana still have some issues with opening up to each other and being completely honest. Christian is as ever, perfect. He may be a controlling, over protective man, but I think I'd be able to deal with that. His love for Ana is so powerful and because it's his first real love, he's terrified something will happen to her. Ana is still quick to make bad decisions where her safety is concerned and still does things without thinking (topless beach for example), but that's because of her young age I think. She's still after all three books, not my favorite, but I've learned to accept her as perfect for Christian.<br /><br />The conclusion with the stalker was good and I liked how it all ended. The last few chapters are my absolute favorite. Such a warm and happy ending to a great series. I'm thrilled about the movie and can't wait to see how close it is to portraying our fifty.
B00EUN12IM|5|LOVE this! So much talent and emotion!
B00FAPF5U0|5|good
0307962520|5|Anne Rice opened my eyes to a very amazing world, I've been reading religiously for years now... a return to all my favorites and what they're up to these days is spectacular!<br /><br />Thank you Anne.
B00JLKHTCW|5|I was thrilled yo get this DVD.  Only saw the movie 3 times in theater with my senior discount.  Don't even think this is just a children's movie.  Animation, yes but transends all others and advances this art form.
B004FGMDOQ|5|this was the first book I borrowed from the public library on my kindle.  I was intrigued by the title and even more by the book.  Excellent storyline.  Was unable to put this one down.  Would love to see a sequel.
B00688628M|5|Awesome series! My children grandchildren and great-grandchildren will enjoy this movie.
B006LSZECO|3|This book deserves an above average rating. But... everyone and their third cousin told me this was &#34;such a great book,&#34; and &#34;seriously so worth buying and addicting.&#34; After reading the first few chapters it was obvious to me the general ending. Those &#34;twists&#34; were merely the circumstances of what I pretty much predicted.<br />Besides the plot being pretty interesting the book wasn't very well written. I thought the journal entires from Amy added a spark as compared to the second half of the book. But aside from that it didn't live up to its name. It just.... wasn't that good.<br />That being said, I would still read it give the choice.<br />But hey, I'll read anything that seems semi-interesting and non-tweeny given the choice.
B00005RIKD|4|I must say that this album is great. I was'nt a real fan of sting's until the released of &quot;Ten Summoner's Tales&quot; back in 93. Before, I had seen earlier police videos, but I did'nt really take any notice. So my taste in his music does not linger on his band from the early 80's for those of you who keep dragging the &quot;police&quot; stigma around ever time you review one of his albums. Over all, this album is great. I like the jazz reworking of his ealier stuff. The addition of Christan Mcbride (one of todays leading bassist) was and awesome idea. I would have preferred the extra tracks included in the U.S. release though. But still, I highly recommend this album.
B000B5XOXY|5|In my estimation the best of the four Warner Bros. Batman films was the '95 release 'Batman Forever', the third installment in the series. With Tim Burton moving out of the directors chair into the position of co-producer and Michael Keaton no longer interested in reprising the role for the third time those positions were filled by Joel Schumacher and Val Kilmer.<br /><br />Generally replacing the main character in a film with another actor/actress is a sure sign of doom, but not in this case. Val Kilmer provides a superior Batman, one darker, deeper with a more morose view of his mission and life after the death of this parents. A man whos dreamllife and the everyday world merge and separate on there own terms. He's more complusive than dedicated, more imprisoned than liberated. He is a man obsessed with his role as the caped crusader. The inclusion of the lovely young Nicole Kidman as Dr. Chase Meridian, psychiatrist and love interest to both Bruce Wayne and his alter ego Batman is wonderfully designed to explore the obsessive, dreamlike world of the troubled multi-millionaire.<br /><br />Joel Schumacher delivers an exciting action/adventure cinematic experience from beginning to end with excellent special effects, a campy cast of characters and at long last the first appearance of Robin, the Boy Wonder played perfectly by Chris O'Donnell!<br /><br />Also starring; Jim Carrey as the Riddler, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, Drew Barrymore as Sugar and Michael Gough as Alfred.
B0099Y2YL6|1|QA took a LOA during the production of this DVD.  It plays, but almost none of the controls, e.g. &#34;Top Menu&#34; or &#34;Menu&#34;, work as they should, so once you've played the 1st and/or 2nd episode you can never get back to them.  You cannot access a list of the episodes at all.  Even if you reject and reinsert the disk it will simply go to playing the last episode no matter what you do.  It's infuriating.
0345457684|5|Altered Carbon had me hooked from the beginning, with me first seeing the book at a library under the Science Fiction category. After reading the summary at the back, I could not resist as to signing out the book. I read it in 4 hours, straight, since I am a fast reader. Nonetheless, the book had me hooked from the beginning and I could not put it down until I had finished it. Morgan paints a world with descriptive adjectives, and slowly leaks us high-tech inventions while seamlessly showing that this kind of technology is not considered too high-tech. Sleek, believable weapons and firefights are a good addition, with a great storyline with lots of twists and sudden revelations. Flashbacks are also a nice touch to the story, and it makes us curious as to the main character's history. More believable things in the future such as religion is also carefully incorporated. <br />In conclusion, Altered Carbon is a very good book, and I believe Richard Morgan may become a legend in Sci-Fi books soon enough.
B00006HYQ5|5|In 2003, I was still getting used to using the trackpoint on my laptop.  A colleague took pity on me and lent me his IBM travel mouse.  I bought my own the next day, and I've been using it ever since.  I think the secret is that it's so small you can easily hold it between your thumb and ring finger, and your index and middle fingers rest on the buttons without thinking - so it takes no adjustment time when you move between the keyboard and mouse.  It's incredibly precise for a LED mouse, but the scroll wheel has always been a little wobbly - not a big deal.  I'm super-fussy about my mouse and keyboard, and I've tried to find a better mouse many times (the closest potential successor has been a USB Razor Pro Click), but after 8 years in my laptop bag I keep coming back to the increasingly battered little IBM.  In fact I only came to this page to make sure they were still selling them!
0399157565|5|Another GREAT Scarpetta book!
B000MG1ZFQ|5|SOFT PARADE is another amazing rock collection of songs from the legendary THE DOORS!!!!!!! All the songs are great, like TOUCH ME, SHAMAN[s BLUES, DO IT, EASY RIDE, RUNNIN BLUE and the crazy title track!!!!! THE DOORS create masterpiece after masterpiece, and all their stuff is TOTALLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!! WELL DONE, DOORS!!!!!!!!
B00BVYNSLC|5|We are addicted.  Good stuff.  Very entertaining
B0036S4B6M|1|Awful do not waste your time on this book, watch the show on Netflix instead! Our book club read this book and no one liked it, the author is full of herself.
B0064MPXFA|5|Intelligent, worth seeing, and I 'm using the Fire stick too. Love it!
B00D7Z4GQY|5|It was a page turner. Very interesting characters.it was heart warmer
B000053VAZ|5|This is a very sweet movie. Benny (Aidan Quinn) lives with his sister Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson), who is mentally ill. One day Joon loses at poker, and *surprise* wins Sam (Johnny Depp) a quirky wanderer who changes both of their lives forever. Great for those who have a taste for bizarre humor, and also wonderful for those obsessive Depp fans. This movie, all though it will make you laugh out loud, will also touch you. And the music is a lot of fun!
B00H3GZMIE|5|Fantastic!
B00466HM28|5|I love this keyboard, and at first I was skeptical as to whether or not I wanted a full sized keyboard or this.<br /><br />Normally I never would have considered, a usb powered keyboard, but I have no regrets. I bought this for portability, and it serves me well.<br /><br />The keys are not weighted, but I never expected them to be.<br />The connection to the keyboard does get yanked out easily. Then you have to &#34;restart&#34; the DAW that you are using, which is not a big deal, but may frustrate someone.<br /><br />The drum pads are fun for recreation. I have yet to use them for any real sequences. There is an application that allows you to set the default notes that are for the pads. Very lightweight application but nice to have.<br /><br />On first start up I had no issues installing drivers, worked out of the box.<br /><br />Buy it!
B0033QC0WE|5|Heard this on NPR on afternoon and knew I had to have it.  I keep it permanently loaded in my car.
B0030ZOYHC|5|Great remake of a classic awaiting the rest of the series.
1423113454|5|Great reading for young and older/oldest!  Love the adventures of Sadie and Carter as they realize that their lives will no longer be the same.
B00E5I2MEK|5|I bought this movie to add to my collection. I have watched it a couple of times already because it is an excellent movie.
B0052FX6M2|5|I wanted to read this book since it came out. I have not been disappointed. Kissinger gives a lot of up close portraits of the people he met in the Chinese Leadership, the differences in personalities and the quirks of individuals like Mao, Deng, and Zhou. He describes well the historical background, why this and that happened, allowing the reader a much better understanding of the entire historical period. It helps if the reader knows the context from the Korean War in 1952 to China 1985. He also speaks on the relationship between Mao and Stalin and the complicated relations between China and Russia and the role China played and still plays in Asia as a whole. The Vietnam conflict is also brought into the picture to help understand that world politics and diplomacy is never black or white decisions.  Kissinger was most involved in the opening of relations with China and the visit by Nixon, he points out that the Nixon visit was the beginning of talks with China and how this impacted the Taiwan question. Recognition by the USA of China and opening of an Embassy in Beijing will come much later in 1979 under Carter, a point often forgotten.<br />Kissinger in the book is the able diplomat, the suave Courtisan, the great tactician and negotiator, he also gives credit to the people on his team for all their efforts in making is work easier. A very good book and an important book on understanding history.
B005GFPZYK|5|I really enjoyed reading it. I am retired military (Vietnam veteran) and it made me proud to read Chris Kyle's extraordinary combat accomplishments.
B007KOMTUI|5|LOVE IT WELL DONE, TRIP BACK IN TIME; THE PERIOD AND ATTITUDES OF THE DAY WERE CAPTURED BEAUTIFULLY!  A DEFINITE MUST SEE!
B00HRC40T6|5|This is the only review I've written for an app, because normally I don't care enough to leave feedback. But this game made me take notice. Quite simply this is the best game I've played on my phone. The art is fantastic, the controls are good (the button controls, anyways. Swiping sucks) and the challenge is the perfect blend of not too easy or too hard. Wish I'd paid for it instead of getting it as the FOATD, because it's worth it.
B00785P2QC|5|Enjoying the game a lot. It is very much like virtual city.  Like the fact I haven't needed to have friends playing the game.
1423113497|5|These books are really good reads. They arrived on time and in great condition. I loved reading these books.
B00632HWOG|5|I use my yahoo email everyday, so to have it on my Kindle was a must. Love the fact that every time I use my Kindle, my emails are there and it never crashes or freezes on me(knock on wood) lol<br />Great app, no complaints!
B00G4ZHCOM|3|It's ok
B00139XSBA|5|The Right Stuff is an entertaining and enjoyable reading experience. The story of the people who served our country as pilots flying test planes and then being selected to become astronauts was fascinating.  Gaining an idea of what they consider the \\"right stuff\\" was insightful to what they expected from themselves and their peers. I hope you enjoy reading this book as much as I did. Happy reading!
B001KVZ6LQ|5|It sounds strange, but watching the blu-ray version makes this movie look a little like 3d. I love this movie and have the collectors tin, vhs, newest dvd, etc. I can not watch the ending anymore because it is sad. I wanted the blu-ray book collectors item and amazon had it, sent it, and fast. When I look for something like this I go immediately to amazon. Thank you amazon.
B00005JMFO|5|Love Actually was a breath of fresh air compared to all of the other \\"Chick Flix\\" that have been released lately. Movies like this one don't come along often and haven't since Notting Hill, 3 Weddings and a Funeral and Bridget Jones' Diary.  It is in true form to all of those. Bring your friend or bring your spouse-- I believe men will \\"Love Actually\\" this movie as well.
6305922756|5|The best mockumentary ever made just got better!<br />Rob Reiner's groundbreaking &quot;This Is Spinal Tap&quot; was first released some 16 years ago and quickly became a cult classic.  Christopher Guest and Co.'s deadpan dissection of heavy metal foibles is as applicable to the Era of the Boy Band as it was to the 80s.  <br />The DVD is a treasure trove for Tap fans.  In addition to over one hour (!) of additional mockumentary footage, the DVD contains music videos, an interview with Reiner in character, promotional materials, and the funniest audio commentary track you will ever hear.  <br />Face it, Tap fans---this one goes to 11!
B00BN2NY48|4|Almost didn't finish watching it but it got more interesting as time when on.  Glad we finished watching the movie.
0553386697|5|I believe the world would be a better place  if all parents, teachers, and anyone who plays a role in raising children read it and implemented the authors recommendations.  The authors use neuroscience findings to guide adults so that they can help children gain control over their emotions, release negativity, and make better decisions.  Key concepts include the difference between &#34;upstaris&#34; (higher brain) and &#34;downstairs&#34; (primitive brain) tantrums, and how to respond when a child &#34;flips her lid&#34;, essentially losing her ability to use her frontal cortex to temper her emotions.There are applications for all age groups, and even a quick guide by age at the end of the book. This book receives my highest recommendation.
B001U7NVV2|3|I had only seen the first of the three, when I saw the ad for the collection.  So I jumped on it thinking it to be a cheap<br />fix for not seeing the other two.  Well I just say there's a reason I'd never seen the other two and you get what you pay for.
B00377E5R2|5|One of the best romantic movies I have ever watched.  I have seen it multiple times since it was released and enjoy it every time.  Good actors and Sydney Pollack is a great Director.
B00CE03UOC|4|You can have a relaxing game or have an exciting one and time yourself. This game isn't only fun, but a challenging brain exerciser. Good for all ages.

B006LSZECO|4|I was going to say I usually don't read books like this.  But, I am not even sure how to categorize this book.  Kind of like a dark comedy mystery. That being said I loved the book.  The way it is broken into different parts and different people telling the different sections made it so fun and interesting to read.  I did not want to put it down after each chapter because I wanted to know how the other persons was going to portray the story.  I don't like book reviews where they tell you all about the book that's what the authors review is for.  I just want to say no matter what kind of books you like to read, try this one I don't think you will be disappointed.  And give it sometime.  It took me a few chapters to figure out how it was written and to get hooked.  After that I could not put the book down.

B000LTAY1U|5|I love this watch, it is not going to keep time like a quartz watch, but it is close enough for everyday time that most of us live in.  No need to wind it, no batteries, just put it on and let it do it thing.    It has a nice size, a practical size to live with and use, not to see who has the biggest watch. I can wear it all the time, and if something were to happend to it, it does not cost much to get a new one.    It is just does it job, and will do so for the next 20+ years from what I have read on the Seiko 5 movement.

A miracle occurred, and you have to read the book to see what happened!<br /><br />Some of the author's musings related to his neurosurgeon's knowledge were a little deep for me, but did not take away from the premise.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this to believers and non-believers alike.

0525423281|5|Anna and the French Kiss is one of my favorite recent contemporary reads so I was eagerly anticipating the companion book's release. Happily, Stephanie Perkins pulled off a great follow up to Anna. Even with a new cast of cast of characters, the feel of the story is just as charming and captivating and left me completely satisfied.<br /><br />Lola is a quirky and flawed yet endearing main character. She's confident and outgoing and likes to have fun with her clothing choices and dress up in wigs and her own fashion creations.  She's 17 and lives in a San Francisco Victorian with her two dads, and has a part time job and a loyal best friend. Her love life is heating up with her rocker boyfriend Max, and things are going pretty well until her old crush Cricket Bell moves back next door and then things start to get complicated.<br /><br />Part of the book's charm is due to the unconventional characters. The main character Lola isn't perfect, and her decisions can be rash and infuriating at times, but I liked that she seemed authentic. The supporting characters are fully detailed and help to enrich the story. I loved Lola's family especially. Her two dads are a great support system for her, and it's great to see her interactions with her involved parents, which is something we don't see too often in YA. As a bonus, it is fun to see some familiar characters from Anna turn up in this book and interesting to see how outsiders view them. The funny thing is that I thought I would miss Anna and St. Clair from the previous book, but as I became involved with this story, I was less interested in their lives and more taken with the current cast. You get the best of both worlds with the overlap of characters past and present.<br /><br />The story is set in the Bay Area and all the details written into the story lend an air of authenticity that as a former San Franciscan I enjoyed a lot. It's not Paris, but San Francisco has its charms as well. This setting is more grounded and relatable in a way.<br /><br />Stephanie Perkins again impressed me with the way she writes slow building romance, with the longing looks and sexual tension that leaps off the page. This author is great at capturing the small moments in a relationship and the feel of first love. As the boy next-door, Cricket is smart, sweet and tall, and fashion forward in his own right. Mainly he's a nice, normal guy, which can be a rarity in itself in YA books. The author takes advantage of his close proximity next door by creating cute, special opportunities for them to interact. These characters will make you melt. Fans of the first book should fall in love with this couple just as much as Anna and St. Clair.<br /><br />I wager you will enjoy this book if you like YA contemporary romance, the book Anna and the French Kiss, and books with quirky characters. It's hard to perfectly capture the magic formula that is the first book, but I found Lola and the Boy Next Door a treat to read all the same.erkins again impressed me with the way she writes slow building romance, with the longing looks and sexual tension that leaps off the page.

B000063DIH|4|For some reason, this album has a lot of negative stigma attached to it, and I have no idea why. No, it doesn't sound like Maiden's awesome 80's efforts (\\"Piece Of Mind\\", \\"Powerslave\\", etc). It's a pretty big change in style, but it's still pretty damn good (and even better where you compare it to Maiden's last release, the average \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\".    First off, let me say what's bad about this album: Bruce, man, what happened to your voice? It's not anywhere as odd as it was on \\"No Prayer\\", but really, it doesn't sound as if Bruce was trying as hard here as he was on previous albums. Also, there are a few filler tracks here, such as \\"Fear Is The Key\\" and \\"Weekend Warrior\\", that kind of take away from the album. \\"But,\\" you say, \\"you can skip over the tracks you don't like!\\" To which I reply, that's true... but this is IRON MAIDEN we're talking about here! If it had been any other band, this would probably be a 5-star effort. But I hold Maiden up to a far higher standard than most other bands, and having filler on a Maiden album is simply unacceptable. Period.    Then why did I give this album four stars? Because there's much to enjoy here as well. \\"Be Quick Or Be Dead\\" is one of my favorite Maiden opening tracks, \\"Afraid To Shoot Strangers\\" is a beautiful ballad that I definitely enjoy, and \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"The Fugitive\\", \\"The Apparition\\", and \\"Judas Be My Guide\\" are all catchy, enjoyable tracks. And, of course, there's the awesome title track, which is, to this day, one of my favorite Maiden songs, hands down. Most of the people who trash the album even like this song.    So, yes, there's lots for Maiden fans to enjoy here, but it's not of the band's greatest albums. If you're new to the band, i'd recommend that you start elsewhere (probably with their mid-80's albums), but once you've picked up a few Maiden records, then come back here and buy this one as well. If you're already into Maiden but are hesitant to buy this album, I say download a few of the better tracks (and make sure you get the title track), and see if you like what you hear.
1616614609|5|I was quite a fan of the original Netrunner but this review isn't based on nostalgia for the old game. If that were the case I'd stick to using the old cards and playing with the same people I did before. This is a great homage to the original and surpasses it in many ways.<br /><br />Android: Netrunner, simply put, is the best two player game experience you can have right now. The only reason I would suggest someone pass on this one is if you really don't like complex card games or building decks or if you would rather play games with more than two players.<br /><br />For the time investment you can't beat the game play of this one and that's why I rate it higher than any other game I own. I absolutely love it.

B000K15VSA|5|I bought this for one version alone-- the original theatrical cut.  With that out of the way, I watched all the other versions (including the \\"final cut\\") and found them all wanting.<br /><br />Of note: The documentaries.  All of them worth multiple viewings.  And the deleted scenes are great to fill in some of the gaps and show some of the different angles that they explored before finding their groove.<br /><br />You may not need all the other bells and whistles, not to mention that this doesn't fit on ANY DVD rack, but you should, at the very least, buy the boxed set that contains all of the films (too bad the \\"work print\\" can only be found here-- not as radical a take as reported, but another interesting look).

B008220BP2|5|BEST MOVIE EVER!
B004WESFZW|4|The Adjustment Bureau (Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller)<br />Directed by George Nolfi<br />Starring Matt Damon, Emily Blunt and Anthony Mackie<br /><br />Universal Studios   2011   106 min   Rated PG-13   Released Jun 21, 2011<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: VC-1<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />French: DTS 5.1<br />Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Discs:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />DVD copy<br />Digital copy (on disc)<br /><br />The Film 4/5<br /><br />I almost went to see The Adjustment Bureau at the theater, but generally negative reviews made me decide to wait for the Blu-ray release. The same was true of Clint Eastwood's Hereafter, also starring Matt Damon. I'm going to have to trust my instincts more because I found both movies entertaining.<br /><br />So why the negative reviews?<br /><br />What do you expect from a Matt Damon movie? His biggest role was as Jason Bourne in the hugely successful trilogy and I think he's expected to be an action hero in every role he plays. That's simply not the case. The man can act and he has a lot more to offer than some give him credit for. The marketing for The Adjustment Bureau is selling it as an action movie, but it's actually a love story with a science fiction element. The front cover shows Damon and Blunt running. They do run in the movie, but that's not the point of the story.<br /><br />This is not an action movie.<br /><br />David Norris (Damon) is running for Senate and he's losing. He meets Elise (Blunt) in a bathroom and they kiss. A brief conversation influences his concession speech and he decides to be completely honest with the assembled crowd. This is not typical behavior for a politician. The entire meeting was arranged without his knowledge just for the purpose of influencing his speech.<br /><br />We are introduced to four men in suits and hats. They look like the Men in Black. What is their origin and why and how are they trying to influence events? One has an assignment to delay Norris by making him spill coffee on his shirt, but he fails to intervene in time. As a result, Norris walks into his office and sees the men altering the memories of his colleagues. He runs, but is quickly caught. They make him promise to keep their secret. They also demand that he drops any interest in Elise as the two aren't supposed to be together.<br /><br />Norris isn't ready to give up on Elise and feels strongly attracted to her. He searches for years and eventually tracks her down. The Adjustment Bureau fails to anticipate his resourcefulness and level of determination. In order to prevent the relationship, other methods are tried to tear the two apart. Norris is given some strong reasons to walk away from Elise. Will they be enough, or will his attraction toward her prove to be too strong?<br /><br />Philip K. Dick wrote the short story on which the movie is based. He was also responsible for Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which resulted in Blade Runner being made. I'm not saying that the Adjustment Bureau is on the same level, but it's certainly a thought-provoking story worthy of your time.<br /><br />Think about fate and predestination for a moment. Do you live your life thinking that every step has been mapped out? If that were the case, why bother to do anything? Do you think that your overall destination has been decided, but it's up to you how you get there? That would at least give your actions some meaning. Or do you think that everything is random and there's no reason or purpose behind anything we do? The Adjustment Bureau raises similar questions. You might be able to predict how the movie ends, but the fun is experiencing the journey.<br /><br />Emily Blunt has good chemistry with Damon and the casting was spot on. She had to learn how to look like a ballet dancer for the part and she was utterly convincing in the role.<br /><br/>I love the Bourne movies, but I'm a fan of Damon's acting in general. It dates back to Good Will Hunting and Rounders. In fact, I've rarely seen Damon disappoint. Hereafter and The Adjustment Bureau will stay in my collection and I'm happy to own them. If you give The Adjustment Bureau a try without expecting an action movie, you might end up enjoying it as much as I did.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />While most recent releases use the MPEG-4 AVC codec, The Adjustment Bureau uses VC-1. The result isn't bad, but I've seen more striking presentations. Grain is moderately thick and detail is average. Many of the scenes have an intentional blue tint, but colors are otherwise accurate. I wouldn't complain about the picture quality, but it's far from exceptional.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />The English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 mix does a good job for the most part. Dialogue is clear, apart from in noisy settings when it's not supposed to be. When Norris is talking to the crowds of people, the atmosphere seems realistic and sounds are separated well. There are no gunshots or explosions, but the sound quality is good throughout.<br /><br />Special Features 2.5/5<br /><br />Audio Commentary by Writer/Director George Nolfi.<br /><br />Deleted and Extended Scenes (6:54)<br /><br />Labyrinth of Doors - A Google Map allowing you to explore various parts of New York. Each door offers a small feature; normally under a minute long. It's a lot of work to navigate through everything and the reward doesn't seem worth it.<br /><br />Leaping Through New York (7:36) - Showing the wide range of locations used during the shoot.<br /><br />Destined to Be (4:51) - Damon and Blunt talk about the casting process and their characters.<br /><br />Becoming Elise (7:08) - How Blunt learned how to become a dancer for the role. Acting can be hard!<br /><br />The Adjustment Bureau asks some interesting questions. It's well-acted and kept my interest for the 106-minute duration. The mystery element and slow exposition have the effect of placing the viewer in the same situation as David Norris, and it works effectively. If you go in with the right expectations (not anticipating explosions and constant action), the story has a lot to offer.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5Adjustment Bureau will stay in my collection and I'm happy to own them.

As for the fire - you will have to read it to understand. Be surprised is all I can say. When it ends you will want to read on to see how it all ends or does it?
0316168815|1|This book is a hoax.  Simply a sappy childish fantasy in the guise of adult literary fiction.  Sebold often comes up with clever metaphors and imagery, but her characters persist in their flatness and incongruity.  Each character jumps right out of some \\"after-school special\\" mold, and the little quirks Sebold ascribes to some of them (Ruth's \\"Sixth Sense\\", Ray's <BR>\\"exotic\\" Indian heritage) are cheap tricks.  The characters act in ways no rational person would given the circumstances: the father pressing the surviving daughter Lindsey to go explore that den of murder, the mother having an affair with the detective investigating her daughter's death, Susie having wanton unprotected sex with a junior high crush who doesn't even seem concerned about this supernatural soul transfer, as if it happens all the time.  Give me a break!  <BR>The ending is so ludicrously sentimental and facile that you really do believe it was written by a fourteen year old girl and illustrated with colored pencils, as she prouldly showed it off to her uncritical mother.  \\"You did such a good job, Alice, you budding little writer, you!\\"
1608198065|5|My 93 year old mother insisted that I order this book. She was right. It is both entertaining and heartbreaking.

I was disappointed, though, since the first song Dewey teaches the kids wasn't on here.  It's still a great cd so buy the soundtrack and see the movie.  They're both great!!
B005OK721G|5|Very good movie and a well chosen cast, especially the little girl who played the protagonist.

B000957O82|5|I just took the time to watch this film instead of wholesaleing it to a buyer. I've always liked Will Smith but the low ball price for this film was $1.28 and I make more selling it like that instead of individually at that price. Let me say this about that and this movie. Buy - Buy it you won't be disappointed. I laughed a lot and the connection Will Smith and Eva Mendes have is only exceeded by the chemistry that Albert Brennaman and Will have. If you think I'm wrong - E-Mail me and I'll buy it from you and give it to my friends at that price. By the way my copy's not for sale at any price.

B00005YW4H|5|A great blend of country, jazz, soul and probably a few other genres.  Be sure to read the liner notes to see that Norah wrote a few of these tunes and plays the piano on almost all of them.  The recording of Hank Williams' \\"Cold, Cold, Heart\\" brings this hit into the 21st century without compromising it one bit.  \\"Come Away With Me\\" is so wistful one wants to hold Norah's hand and tell her everything's gonna be ok. All of the songs invite one to sit back, listen closly to the lyrics and relax.

1451695195|5|Wow this was an amazing story about a surgeon who didn't believe in a god and how a life after death experience changed him. It hit me deeply and now I read and am interested in more people who have had an afterlife experience. It really helped me spiritually as I had lost faith while dealing with depression.
B000099T2L|3|Dangerously  in  love  was  a  Destiny Child  song.  I  think it  was  unfare  of Beyonce to put it out to be just  hers. She made her album to better  than  Kelley's cause she's  the one that wants to be in the spotlight.And to tell the truth I think some of the songs on this album are from Destiny's Child.

B009FZHYKU|4|I love this show. It keeps me right on the edge of my seat all the way through. The characters are strong and the way the story develops you really feel like this is a post apocalyptic world. Unlike other shows have attempted to, this one really nails it. Not for the faint of heart or young though, this is a TVMA  all the way.

B003Y5HWGI|5|loved it.
B00Y6QF0PE|5|Wasn't really sure about getting this after reading another out there that was actually pretty good, but I gave it a chance and loved it sooo much.
B00JP5ONY0|3|This movie was pretty good, but the story line stayed flat the whole time. Even the exciting moments, weren't really that exciting, and there really wasn't any great climatic moment.
B000EMGAOY|5|After reading another review I guess that I was not the only one having problems with the mars disk.  it played in my car and in my cd player but i could not get it to play in my computer.  i did exchange it for another copy and it works fine now.
B002UWH8P6|5|Awesome show
B0060MYM3S|5|bought as a gift. recipient says it is a great series. i will continue to buy each season as a gift for this person
B005XQLBU4|5|this is a very fun game that will keep you busy for many hours.  it is fun for all ages also from kids to adults.
B0023SDPS6|4|I bought this book because I like the television show, Longmire.  So, I was disoriented as I began to read.  Walt, Vic and Henry didn't look or sound right. Now that I've read the book, I expect the reverse to be true when I see the show next.  After all, who knows more about the characters than the author. And a damn fine author he is.  The images he creates describing the setting, the environment, the people, all are strong and clear.  The dialog, once you settle into the rhythm, sounds authentic and totally believable.  I'm adding this series to my must-read list. This is good stuff.
B004SYP5WC|5|this is just what I needed to stay on top of bills.  I love the simplicity and ease of use.  nothing fancy but that's. not what I wanted.
6303471730|5|The movie itself is excellent, probably one of John Waynes best. The quality of the video is very poor. Video apprears to be a multiple generation copy.
B004SJ3AXI|3|I am over 50 and guess this is designed more for the younger folks.  I get bored with it in a very short time.
B004SJ3BCI|5|my son loves this game
B004ZZS4CC|5|I was sad, but encouraged by the courage of this young lady. Her commitment to maintaining her sanity is overwhelming. It's something to think about when we're complaining about insignificant and mundane issues in our lives.
B00FPGSPQU|3|I was looking for a couple of hours to kill on a snowy day and got what I thought I was getting.  Not great but predictable.
B00HBQWGXK|3|Not up to Mr. Child's normal level of excellence.  The first person narrative gets old very quickly.  The plot line is a little tortured.  I'm hoping for better next time.I
B000088E6D|1|It's flat and dull and totally uninspiring, which is saying something when one considers the material he uses.  How can he NOT be inspired by these songs?  Does the man's heart not beat?<BR>Who cares, really? Do yourself and us all a favour, don't encourage him by buying this CD and instead look for Johnny Hartman and/or Sammy Davis Jr.  Your ears will thank you.
B00FATEJYE|5|420 no scope illuminati up I here
B0063IH60K|5|Fantastic app! Easy to use, sleek and simple interface, a well-rounded application for fans of the game, very cool winning deal function.
B0002OERI0|4|This is the first cd I could not import to my MP3 Player. Kind of a bummer. They made some of the songs transfer for 15 hours or more. I guess they need the money. But there has to be a better way.
B002XMGGJM|3|I ordered new yet I was sent used.  The picture online was shown of the US version however I received the Canadian Version(Which is fine because it is in both English in French).  No digital copy sleeve, no inserts, which points to it being an obviously used copy.  Slow shipping, and when asked why I was sent a used copy there was never a response.  Again, great item, poor vendor.
B00ID4I0FM|4|The movie is not as good as the book, but entertaining and faithful, even with updates like email and ipads.
B00BHMETKC|4|Sadly the only real drawback was knowing the final outcome. It moderated the final nail biting tension a bit. Great stuff all the same.
0812548094|4|OK, so he borrowed a little from the Wheel of Time Jordan books.  So what?  Robert Jordan's last foray was rather weak, so I enjoyed reading this similar, yet better written, version.  The bottom line is that the book IS  a simple, fun, and not too intelligent story...exactly the reason a person  should be reading fantasy in the first place.
B0084AZXKK|5|Awesome and well told, a quick read perfect for any pirate adventurer at heart.  Is perfect for young readers aside from some mildly violent passages.
B00GH738GS|5|As described.
B0012DP8A6|5|I dont like many musicals but Little Shop is a classic.  Its dark and funny and synical and the music is amazing.  Do you recognize Pam and Gina from Martin?? How about Bill Murray as the overly excited sado masochist?  Must watch again and again!
0321701763|5|did the trick
B000J10ER4|1|My DVD came scratched and I will never get back the money I used to by it. It really makes me mad because not only did I want to watch the movie but spent hours trying to fix the DVD to my luck nothing fixed it.
B00I4R5326|5|HD quality and a fun movie to watch with the family.
B00HV2KPNW|4|Delightful for children
B0064MPXFA|5|Love this series.  There are so many plots and sub-plots, it keeps me coming back for more.  Great character development and believable story lines.  Love it!
B001NLKZUA|5|Lags at points, but overall pretty good.  Not as good as Beautiful Creatures.  But I will say this.  I just got done watching the movie Mortal Instruments and I was blown away at how closely they stuck to the book.  When I watched the movie Beautiful Creatures I was yelling at the tv about 70% of the time. The movie to City of Bones was retry much dead on.  I can't wait til this one comes out and I can see it all come to life. I just hope they do this one the same justice they did the first.
B00QLVY7J2|3|Fun but to really advance at a reasonable rate you have to pay.
B003G4W49C|5|Best read in quite a while.  Can't wait to get my hands on some more OSC!  I'm hooked on books again.
B00006IR5S|5|I imagine that the art of scoring a film is quite different than writing for a symphony orchestra with its hall audience:  the musical movements must fit the story, and for film, must be resolve rather quickly as each scene of the film passes by quickly (especially in Harry Potter).  Williams, aside from near plagiaristic sequences of music similar to Holst and, should I say it, his own Star Wars soundtracks, has nonetheless produced a second soundtrack that is better than the original.  Fawkes the Phoenix is a hopeful, gradually intensifying piece of melody that is one of the most briliant pieces of music I have ever heard.  It is woven throughout the soundtrack through other familiar themes and sequences that appear in the first Harry Potter soundtrack, but is unique and different from them.  I really like Williams' use of his strings, and this soundtrack puts them to the test a bit more than average a la Stravinsky.  I recommend this soundtrack for its many moods and ability to make sense as a coherent whole.  Kudos to Williams again.  I wonder if I'll recognize any sequences in any other pieces of music.  Will I?  I hope not.
0738711500|5|Love this deck, pretty imagery and the book is useful, great introduction to tarot readings. The quality of the cards is nice and good weight and printing is done really well, looking forwards to doing readings :)
006197806X|4|Lauren Oliver is currently one of my favorite authors. Her descriptions, characters, events, ect. are always worth reading no matter what part of the book you're on. That in mind, I have to admit that Pandemonium had some huge expectations on my part. Delirium was fantastic for me, and after I finished reading it I thought that was it. I wasn't planning for a sequel. And for as many expectations I put into this sequel that did not quite make their mark, I almost wish this book hadn't been written. Almost. However this is all just my opinion...blah, blah, blah...moving on.<br /><br />I MISSED THE OLD CHARACTERS! I know it wasn't possible to bring them back in this book, but the ones like Raven, Julian, and the \\"new Lena\\" just didn't cut it for me. They were forced. Everything was forced: the relationship with Julian, the deaths of those girls-were we supposed to cry for them because I'm sorry but I didn't know them enough to squeeze it out of me-, and the danger of fleeing through the wilds in the THEN-of course some of the characters are going to be fine, in the next chapter there's a NOW with them in it. All I'm saying is who are these characters Oliver introduced us to? We learn a lot more about Lena, and we learn about Julian, but when Lena felt so betrayed by Tack and Raven, all I could think of is why? I get no sense of family from the people in the wilds she lived with, yet family is what she calls them.<br /><br />Onto Julian. I'm not even sure how to comment on him. He and Lena had some really tender moments, but I am now and forever will be an Alex fan. Julian seemed girlish to me. This is the reason why: he is the \\"old Lena,\\" the one ready for being cured, and Lena is Alex, the one who knows the wilds and attacks huge bodyguards with only a knife. They fell in love too quickly despite Lena repeating over and over again her remorse of Alex. Julian earned my sympathies-probably the only character who did. I felt little more for him than honest sorrow.<br /><br />You might be wondering at this point: why on earth did this picky, unfeeling person give Pandemonium four stars if she keeps rambling on about all the dislikes. I will tell you why: because I can't write a review long enough to cover all the things I did like. I really can't, and many other readers will figure those like's out without me trying to describe them. I just had to let the things I disliked out. I desperately await the next book, but I hope now, with my expectations squashed to less than galaxy heights, I can appreciate it like Oliver's books should be. Oh, and if you haven't noticed the reviews screaming \\"I can't believe the ending!\\" then let me also add, \\"I REALLY can't believe the ending!\\" I think I passed out after reading that last page. It was that shocking. SO DON'T YOU DARE SKIP TO THE END!br />You might be wondering at this point: why on earth did this picky, unfeeling person give Pandemonium four stars if she keeps rambling on about all the dislikes.

B0042TV4IW|5|Great series! I love how they weave several tales around one central theme. I also like seeing some familiar faces from other movies and shows.
B0097GVJWQ|5|i really loved the game but hated that it didnt take long to beat it.  that was the worst part of the game.
1594135851|4|This is a good read. I have actually enjoyed the books a lot more than the movies. It is an easy read to get away for a bit. You can curl up with a blanket and a cup of tea and just loose yourself for a bit. Just make sure if you order the large print you need it. I dont need large print and I accidentally ordered large print! oops,
B004HWYTP4|5|Old retired people rule based on life experiences & knowledge.  Must see this movie first before watching the sequal, Red 2.
B000FC1RCI|5|GREAT piece kept pages turning and excitement high plan on reading again to uncover the full mystery of agatha christie
0671027344|5|I'm not quite sure if words can describe it but i am blown away by this book in every aspect. <br />It's amazing.<br />The author mixes humour with sadness and the reality of life out side the comfy suburbs that i live in, where its easy to pretend nothing truly bad is out there.<br />I find it inspirational, and my emotions were keyed in to theprotaganists feeling.  I felt like I was in the book.  As Charlie, the main character's life started getting better I started feeling better, it opened up my perspective and the way i view the world.<br />I would strongly suggest this book to anyone and everyone no matter who they are.<br />I loved it.
B009ZUZ9FW|5|Thoroughly detailed without being overly complicated or complex. One of the best books on programming languages that I have ever read. It's comprehensive without being dull or dry.
B00B2V66VS|5|So addictive and it is so much fun. It is a great game and you should try it if you haven't.
0553382179|5|I got it from our local library and decided I had to have one for myself, so I shopped around for the best price, and found it thru Amazon.com
B007J4T2G8|1|Ridiculous. Horribly written. Couldn't finish it, and I NEVER put a book down in the middle. Ridiculously ridiculous. What are people thinking? Would give it negative stars if I could.
1594633665|5|Really enjoyed The Girl on the Train.  The first 50 or so pages were a little slow to get me drawn in, but then I couldn't put the book down.  Would definitely recommend for a good, dark read.
B00MX1NML8|5|Unfortunately, only the first chapter is free. Fantastic App!
B0094BB4TW|5|Nothing bad to say about this app, not sure why there are bad reviews for this app when there has never been any issues for me at least on my part
B00J5LXTUI|5|Phenomenal movie.
B00BAXFECK|5|Compelling story
B008ZOHCKE|5|I am so thrilled by this application. I am going to use it for homeschooling my children. Thank you! If you made an application that was set up for homeschooling records that would be even better but I am not complaining.
B00005U122|4|Surprisingly fresh and entertaining. Roger does great homage to his classic Floyd hits, as does his very talented assemblage of musicians. From start to finish he is energized and looks like a man far younger than his years. I expected much less, due to his Live in Berlin disaster, and especially because of the absence of David Gilmour. Any modern Floyd or Waters reproduction of the classics seem to be firing at 1/2 brilliance. (It's a tradeoff, no Waters or no Gilmour, what a terrible shame). Gilmour isn't missed as much as usual during the In The Flesh performance, however, which is a huge compliment to everyone involved. The New songs are equal to the classics because Roger is so fired to perform on all cylinders, thus garnering a 4 star rating. The backup singers as usual add that extra dimension and wonderment to the proceedings.
B0000CABBW|4|Beautiful, meaningful.
B008K8U13K|5|Havent bought this for the kindle fire yet but i have it for PC &amp; it is fun as hell! Wish they had sonic generation for the kindle fire! Sega has made me a happy customer, so far they haven't let me down.
B0088W6IMQ|5|If You LOVE Stargate SG-1 then you'll love this too. Same writers and some great new interesting situations. Some things are cheesy but I can look past it.
6303334598|5|Truly a delightful movie. I love the fact that the Charlie and Yvonne are so innocently just &quot;doing the right thing&quot; whilst staying so unassuming and carrying on with their lives. The scene at the end in their &quot;darkest hour&quot; almost had me in tears, and really showed out their true characters. A real heartwarming film - for a change I felt a well spent 90 minutes rather than an empty hour and half. Refreshingly different from the usual shallow romantic comedies out there which are all basically the same.
B000XUBFE2|5|At the end, when he mentions that he has more stories like this, I had an immediate desire to know each of them.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. It is one of the most beautifully written stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading. So touching, and amazing character development. I felt like I was in the basement with the characters. Very emotional.
B000PDYVVG|4|I really loved this book. It was insightful and I think a lot of women today can relate to some of Elizabeth's feelings and emotions. For those persons who say this is only for the rich who can fly around the world....absolutely not true. Elizabeth herself states that you don't have to pursue your self-actualization via her means, but what the book does, is that it opens your mind to a lot of things. It provokes thought and encourages you to look within yourself. I found myself on the same pursuits as her and it didn't require any trips to Italy, India or Indonesia. I also learnt quite a lot from the book; it was not only inspiring but informative and interesting as well    Elizabeth is an excellent writer. It was hard to put down the book; her story and words were very captivating. I am discovering a whole new me thanks to this book and encourage others to read it to see what I am saying.    \\"Your treasure - your perfection - is within you already. But to claim it, you must leave the busy commotion of the mind and abandon the desires of the ego and enter into the silence of the heart. \\" - Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat.Pray.Love
B00FAPF5U0|5|I Love it on level 387 and dreading reaching the end of the line.  Colors, music special effects it's all good.
B001O9BB3G|3|This is a wonderful story with beautiful character development and back stories but just as the story gets to where you want it, it ends! I want more!
B0018OASZE|5|Adele's debut is a case study in looking for love in (mostly) all the wrong places. A few songs suggest that the singer is on the verge of finding what she's so desperately looking for. Most of the time, though, she's left all alone, painfully trying to piece together the fragments of her broken heart.
B0002IU988|2|This cd is the perfect example that you can have a good guitar player , a good bassist , a good drummer , a good singer and still make songs that have no depth.  This cd is very well played but is also very very boring , so before thinking about buying it  listen to the song samples first.  These guys can rock but I just dont like the songs they play, I don't feel them and I think they lack creativity except for the guitar solos and riffs which are really good but that doesn't change the fact that listening to this cd is like listening to some background music. It's like ambient rock music. Check out 'seven wiser' instead , it's less sophisticated but better in my opinion.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|My friend showed me this game and now I can't put it down
B002QCD2OG|5|Really good movie. Last scene is awesome. It is better than the remake done a few years ago. Set on a Scottish island in the modern day but the inhabitants practice ancient paganism.
B00PTB7B34|5|Best game ever
B00V5850OC|1|Reading this book is like slogging through quicksand.  There are pages of meaningless, unnecessary dialogue with nothing much happening.  At 81% in, I'm finally giving up.  I will never know who the killer was and at this point I really don't care.  If you have trouble sleeping this book is better than a sleeping pill.
B00O58REC0|5|excellent service  received as described
B00992CF6W|5|I think it's going to be a great game in the Guinness world records(if it gets in)<br />Although it does get boring without all the items that are in the computer version.
B00KGCNRAM|5|I love Mahjong.  Many many different kinds.  The designs to this game are great.  I feel confident playing.  I hope come out with a # 2.
B00GJNQ40W|5|This may not be who she is today but it is definately shows her strength as a song writer and poet. Her emotion and vulnerability just blow me away when she sings.
B00571F26Y|4|Wheat Belly Kindle  is a  good book but I found that this book needs to be in print form rather than Kindlefor me to select/utilize the recipes.
B00BVYNSLC|4|Interesting story line. Relevant for our times and where science is heading. The actors portray their parts convincingly. Enjoying the episodes.
B0000TG9E2|5|This is one of the many Disney Classics that won our harts and loyalty to the Disney name.  No collection is complete without this movie that is good wholesome fun for the whole family.
B0025UHKNS|5|I have  been using the 405CX now for a week, and I'm very pleased with the results..It has incredibly accurate GPS function, and it gathers all data and transfers it so easily through the my Win7 computer to Garmin Connect. I like the fact that they have eliminated all but two buttons, and every thing else is controlled by the touch sensitive bezel that surrounds the crystal. The controls requires tap, or touch & hold (for 2 seconds).  The face light is controlled by using a two finger touch and it is nice and bright.  I've used it as a handy light when no flashlight was on hand.<br /><br />I was using my smartphone's GPS and one of the Android training apps(Endomoundo), but the watch is far more accurate and easier to manage when I'm in action.  I would have had to spend $75 for a heart monitor, and this accessory is included in the 405CX box. The watch contains a re-chargeable battery, and a one hour run uses only about 15% of the charge. Adapters for the power adapter are included if you are out of the US. And I think the USB charging cable can be used through your computer's ports. But I have not done that yet. The watch strap is broad, secure and comfortable, with additional Velcro straps included in the box along with a small tool required to change the band.<br /><br />Garmin did an excellent job here and provides the support to make this a terrific purchase at Amazon's price.
B000AP04L0|5|This movie is so funny. After reading some of the bad reviews, it's apparent that some reviewers have never worked in an office or just simply don't have a sense of humor or don't understand sarcasm.    A good indicator of if you'd enjoy this movie is if you agree with the following statements...  Do you like satire?  YES  Do you like sarcasm?  YES  Does the perky office person drive you crazy?  YES  Did you enjoy watching any episode of Beavis & Butthead or King of the Hill?  YES  Are you tired of your boss being a jerk?  YES    If you ever worked in an office, you'd be able to relate to this movie. But it's not something you'd want your kids to watch if they're under 14.    YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE if you want to laugh!
6305428050|5|It took me all of the opening 2 minutes of this film to remember why I had such an enormous crush on Elisabeth Shue while I was in high school.  Nowadays she is a serious actress with excellent honors and awards to her credit.  Back in her early Thespian days, however, she was just plain adorable.<br />As you might expect, the movie is about a routine babysitting job that goes awry.  Kris (Shue) reluctantly drives from the suburbs to the inner-city of Chicago with 3 kids she's supposed to be watching over.  On her way to pick up a flighty friend who wanted to run away, her mom's station-wagon gets a flat tire.  Let's just say that the rest of the evening is all downhill from there!<br />While the adventures are off-the wall, the plot does maintain a certain cohesion as all of the adventures are linked together nicely.  The film also serves as a funny satire of what happens to naive suburbanites when they end up on the &quot;wrong&quot; side of the inner-city.  Along the way, the kids even pass thru the university of Chicago which is, despite its reputation as an elite academic institution, most ASSUREDLY located on a rough side of Chicago.<br />This film is highly recommended for all persons who enjoy adolescent comedies.  If you look up &quot;fun movie&quot; in the dictionary, you just might find this movie listed as an example.
B0054JZC6E|5|great way to pass the time. I only have one problem with it, some of the controls are hard. it took me longer to beat those games.<br />  thanks for reading!
0441009425|5|My husband loves this author.
B00DFFHUUA|4|Good movie. Nothing spectacular.  My nephews love it
B00B4Z5GDQ|5|Great doc
B0084AXZK0|5|The Picture of Dorian Gray is more than the story of a young man who wanted to keep his pretty looks for the rest of eternity, it contains more than that; it is about vanity, bad influences, mistakes, lack of remorse, joy of the forbidden things, etc. It is certainly a critique of English society during the Victorian era (a society that Wilde was part of). The book shows us that no matter what wicked things you do, remorse will always haunt you. And note that this book is not as horrific and immoral as some movies based on this very same story.
B0044C5SCU|5|Another great season of stand-alone stories interspersed with serial-type content. The cliff-hangers in this series are some of the best I've seen.
B00VFTD43A|5|Great movie!
B00F1BFNFA|5|Best series ever, this completes my collection thus far. Enjoyed every minute.***** 5 stars. Waiting for season 5 to come out.
B007PTJOV0|4|its a really fun game but it keeps saying that a need Internet connections and plus its too easy to beet
B0087ZG7HK|5|Good, old fashioned exciting movie. It starts out where everyone is oohing and awing the development of Jurassic Park with the many varieties of dinosaurs. Then the security and electrical system of the Park is tampered with and all hell breaks loose. After that happens, there's a lot of running and screaming. Good acting, beautiful scenery, and a lot of scary excitement.
B000LPQ6DE|5|I have looked for this movie for a while and it was great to watch it again. I was very satisfied with how quick it arrived too.
0316036692|5|A very interesting book with some new concepts that I had never even figured were possible. For example, the concept that anyone is ever, ever an \\"overnight success\\".  Apparently, there is no such thing.  Anyone that appears to be an overnight success has already spent at least 10,000 hours learning their craft. This book has forever changed the way I think about success and it's achievement.  Most of us may be doomed to mediocrity.
B00000JPH5|4|I have loved this movie for many years.  It is designed for children, but is a very sexy movie too.  David Bowie can't help that.  This is a must see for any David Bowie fan!
B000JJ4GW0|5|U2 is always U2!! Better and better everyday... this CD/DVD is the right choice for who really likes the group. I recommend it!!
B00009YOQW|4|We started letting our baby play with this around 10 months without the rubber mallet which just became a chew toy. As a previous reviewer mentioned there are only three little rubber feet on the bottom, which causes the drum to easily tip / flip. Four feet would have been ideal. It's probably less of an issue for older babies / toddlers.
B002L5GQGY|5|This recording is just outstanding. Bonamassa must surely be the best guitar player living.I have the DVD of this concert which I would also recommend...bought the CD for the car.Great, great music.
B00005AQE8|5|All Eyez On Me is a really good cd. I found the cd inspiring and it influenced me to write lyrics of my own, because of its great tracks. On this one theres alot of songs that made it on the Greatest Hits cd, like &quot;Life Goes on&quot;, &quot;2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg, and &quot;How Do U Want It&quot; featuring Jojo of Kci and Jojo, and theres also alot more. And to me this is his best cd. It has good beats mixed by producers like Johnny J,Dr.Dre even produced one song called &quot;Cant C Me&quot;, and great lyrics by the legendary Tupac Amaru Shakur.
B009UX2YAC|4|This is a very fun and addictive game. I love trying to pass my Facebook family and friends.I would recommend this app to all my friends that want to play it.
B000002KIE|5|Ok, boys and girls, THIS is music. All you people out there that think all these frieken pop/punk bands *cough*GoodCharlotte*cough* are great well, you need to wake up and hear the Pistols! This is one of the greatest albums ever and the point it brings across is just awesome, Sid Viciuos has the greatest punk rock voice I have ever heard and these songs actually have MEANING TO THEM. So, all you little &quot;puink rockers&quot; out there that think pop/punk bands are hardcore, pick this damn album up NOW!
B007HU4FZ2|5|Excellant movie.. very moving..would recommend it to anyone.  Something I will not forget.  Im sorry I didnt watch it sooner.
B002VRZEYM|5|It was an eye opener in regards where, and how our food is farmed.  Makes sense why organic food is a little pricier than just regular food.
B007X3DQGM|5|hav'nt gotten very far but i love the different shapse and colors
1101946342|5|Awesome!!!! Love this 50 shades series. Can't wait for the next one
B00DUGCLY4|5|It gets difficult as u level up. Overall this is fun and addicting game. A must download game.I  play this game with my daughter and we love it.
B00G5G7K7O|5|Great Movie!!
B000000993|5|This is an AMAZING CD, the songs, the beats, the lyrics, the band, the entire thing will leave you in a lull of blissful harmony and then, and raging ball of fury. Maynard is wonderful as he expresses the full force of  his awesome treachea. Buy this CD, and you will never look at music the  same.

1573226521|1|This book basically chronicles the adventures of a 21 year old British \\"traveler\\" (our protagonist) and his discovery of a hidden unspoiled island commune somewhere in Southeast Asia. Basically the guy is in Thailand staying in a youth hostel when the creepy Scottish guy next door (aka Mr. Duck) leaves a map to \\"The Beach\\" taped to his door before he promptly kills himself (by wrist slashing-which means we can look forward to annoying blood and suicide metaphors throughout the rest of the book- too bad he didn't just jump off something tall). But Mr. Duck ain't dead yet folks, he comes back in the form of about 127 annoying dream sequences in which he advises our hero while dripping blood from the wrists everywhere and making a general nuisance of himself. But I'm jumping ahead of myself. Said protagonist sets off to find this mystical place, accompanied by an annoying French couple. They find it, are accepted into the community, but find there are sinister undertones to this supposed Utopia (what a shocker). I'm about 2 chapters away from finishing this thing and it's yet to kick into high gear. Author Garland prefers to write everything from the first person perspective, so not only do we get to hear every insipid conversation the character takes part in, we get to see into his thoughts as well, and believe me folks there ain't a hell of a lot to see in there. Mostly we get to hear his internal mental struggle on if he should light another cigarette, will he be able to get more cigarettes, and should he try and make it with the French chick while her boyfriends not around. We also get his mental commentary on which members of the commune he likes or dislikes on that particular day. Unfortunately it is hard to agree or disagree with him since there is little or no character development focused on anyone other than the protagonist (who is basically an annoying self centered twit). I can't say this book completely sucks since I did manage to get through it ( I guessI was waiting for something interesting to happen). Call it the literary equivalent of a Tab Cola. If you want to read a book that you will completely forget about within a week, pickup \\"The Beach\\" by Alex Garland. Otherwise try reading something by an experienced author instead of a first timer.

B0055SWM08|4|I like the graphics, game play, and music are all aces for this game, when my phone tells me I'm out of room, this is the last app I decided to remove to make space. Loving Amazon's policy of downloading later if I get room again.

B0089LOG02|5|Loved the descriptions of sights, smells and emotions.  It's so well written I felt like I was there living the story with Vivian.
B0034DGPEU|3|From the wealthy to the poor, every page had bad things happening to good people.  No let up.  All &#34;Evil Wins&#34;.<br />I know things were bad, but why would they want to live?

B0006N2EZ0|5|This is a  'must see' for All movie lovers!  I saw this in the theaters several times.  I miss Whitney so much and this brought me close to her, if only for 2 hours!  Check it out!
B00COGY2P2|4|I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but this movie looked pretty good and I'm glad I rented it.<br />I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed it very much.  Lots of great action.  Would watch again!
B004I744AS|5|This by far is the best dictionary I have ever used. It has so much information and it is fun to read. This is my go to  place when playing Word with Friends
B00O8NPCA8|4|Better than anticipated. I'd like now to find out if it is based on a novel. I think the novel might fill in some of the story line gaps that are always present in a film adaptation. In all a definite four star movie.
B00R3DODWI|5|It's The Hobbit.  What else is there to say??
B004GUSG4M|5|Throughly enjoyed this book, I could not put it down, from start to finish and then when I was finished I had to go back and reread sections.  Very well written!
B005Q1W10A|4|Not at good as Season 1, but it still had the season-ending episode that warmed our heart.<br />Looking forward to Season 3, but don't like Shirley McClain. Violet is the real star in the show.<br />Others are favorite characters, too, however.
B002XTBE6K|5|This is a beautiful, timeless story that has been wonderfully redone.  This is my all time favorite version of Emma.  The actors are marvelous, and the producers and directors did a wonderful job editing the movie from the book.  They have kept in the most from the book that I have seen yet.
B00AREIAI8|4|this is a awesome game, I want my own horse but we don't have any room in my back yard so I play this game and it is kinda simalar.
B000WEMH3C|1|This cover is garbage.<br />Multiple problems with this cover.<br />Keeps blowing off, so I had to place a brick on top to keep it from flying away.<br />Ripping, tearing, disintegrating...<br />This thing wears like cheap paper.<br /><br />Don't bother with this, it won't even last 6 months.<br />Not the type of quality I expected from Weber.<br />Very disappointed.<br /><br />I wish I could post a picture of this piece of garbage.<br />It's literally in shreds from the wind tearing it apart.
0307588378|5|Really good
B00168OINK|5|Hadn't seen this until we saw it in blu-ray. It sure is gorgeous, and intelligent to boot, easily in the pantheon with the Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, and a few other recent masterpieces of animation.<br /><br />  Jack Black is quite perfect, Hoffman and the rest equally fine, and the script is excellent. I really can't find much to not like about Kung Fu Panda, either for kids or adults. There's enough smart humor for the elders and enough eye candy for any fan of color, composition, and animation in general. The form is used to perfection and it's clear that we are in a golden age of animation right now; the classics are coming fast and furious.<br /><br />It's also a very funny, wry movie, with sweet and snappy moments to spare.<br /><br />This is bound to be one of the dvds that parents use to pacify their kids, for decades to come. If they have to be watching the boob tube instead of reading or doing something truly useful (\\"Such a nice day and you're watching Kung Fu Panda AGAIN?!\\"), this is about as good a thing for them to be tv zombies with as can be found.<br /><br />This is in fact a work of art.<br />Not bad for a kids' flick.
B00IPK6HTU|5|A Awesome Group Of Musicians every song is Killa, i hear a little(a lot)of  Rush in the song Tin Soldiers,, I love everysong on this CD, everytime i listen i find another song i love, The Guitar work, the Drummer and Kip Winger is holding it all together with his solid<br />vocals and Bass lines, they are a musicians Band!!!! I hope this CD make the charts ( it's that Good)
0399159347|5|I had never read anything by this author and I saw a review in Entertainment Weekly and ordered the book. Oh, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I won't go over what the book is about, you already know that. BUT, the husband's secret is a life-changing secret!<br /><br />The characters are very well fleshed out, you get to know everyone. The reader is taken on a journey that you will never forget. At least I won't. My husband said I even talked in my sleep about this book, that's how engrossed I was! It's an amazing book and one I won't soon (if ever) forget!
0062059998|5|I absolutely loved this book, as well as the trilogy! Very well written- I just had to keep reading to the very end!
B0085MNZ66|2|There is a level soon after starting that it is unclear what is needed to be done. The colors do not match so they cannot be joined. Just didnt make sense and especially hard for the kids. They found an easier, yet similar game to play called Flow Free.
B000HT3P7E|4|\\"How I Met Your Mother\\" is a wonderfully heartwarming and humorous show rehashing the courtships and surroundings of a late 20s early 30s man named Ted Mosby as part of an overarching story arc of a future Ted Mosby recounting to his future children regarding how he met their mother.    The stories are wonderfully shot, and brilliantly rounded by a diverse set of characters played by Alyson Hannigan, Cobie Smulders, Jason Segel, Neil Patrick Harris, and Josh Radnor.  The individual episodes are cleverly linked and tied together, with foreshadowing and callbacks ranging through complete seasons.  The writing is punchy, and the humor is tailored to easily fit with each character, never feeling force.  It's enjoyable, heartfelt, and intelligent.    However, the transfer to DVD has one small problem and one really big problem in it, from my point of view.    Small problem is the menu system does not allow for consecutive playing of the episodes without returning to the menu.  I consider this feature a must for TV shows transferred to DVD.    The biggest problem I have is that they changed much of the scoring and music selections within the shows.  Instead of containing the songs and music from the broadcasts, they have been replaced by unknown and less evocative music.  For example, in the episode \\"Drumroll Please\\" they replaced \\"You Don't Knom Me\\" by Michael Buble for this heartwrenching romantic scene with some neutral generic waltz music...detracting from the scene considerably.  In the same episode, the final scene was originally done to Pavement's \\"Spit on a Stranger\\" which brought lovely color and climax to the finale of the episode, but on the DVD, it was another generic piece of music.  I imagine these were cost saving measures to prevent paying royalties, but it lessens the greatness of the show...and the show really is great.    For this transgression, I have penalized the DVD one star for taking a great show and not keeping it intact during the transfer to DVD.
B002HJ9PTO|2|Tried with different recorders / laptops / desktops and had to maximize microphone in software and then still VERY low recording volume when clipped anywhere on my shirt; only if held up to my mouth was the sound acceptable. It did eliminate environment sounds (cars outside, humming of computer at desk), but not useful to actually hear the person. I had to convert the audio file and import it into an audio software to amplify and then change sound settings to make it usable. Also the jack for using it with an iphone has loose connections / fittings and ANY movement creates VERY loud static discharge sounds and spikes the recording to basically no moving if trying to record on an iphone (the reason I purchased this). The iphone itself has much better recording volume and sound quality, but picks up a lot of environment noise also.
B00A4A1KK0|5|Phillip Phillips is made of talent.  American Idol started with Kelly C. and had James Durbin in the middle, and ended with Phillip Phillips.  There will NEVER be another A.I. like Phillip Phillips.  Never.  All of the songs on this cd are good.  Usually when I buy a cd there is one song I do not like, Just one.  but not on this cd.  This one is the best and I am glad I own it.  he will be around the music scene for DECADES and go down in history as a legend.  Why not buy his first cd?  Ya nutz?  ;)

B002AWJEU8|5|Steve's back, but it's as if he was never gone!    Great to see the old stuff, new stuff bundled in the middle and the outstanding growing skills as a perfomer by the genius of the space-age guitar.    Also followed by a great band, introducing other kind of strings to bundle with the guitar, creating a soul-powered live gig, a must see!    Worth every dime!

B0017SWPXY|5|The description of this book captured my attention, but time after time I talked myself out of reading it, thinking it would be childish written from Enzo's perspective. I wish I would have read it sooner!  From the very beginning, you are drawn into the story of Enzo and his master, Denny. Somehow, Enzo becomes real, and if you look closely, you can see him tilting his head and trying to make you understand the language he speaks.<br />Enzo is complicated and simple at the same time, with an understanding far beyond what we give animals credit for. The Art of Racing in the Rain is well written, detailed and emotionally charged.  I found myself laughing at his antics, shaking my head in agreement, all the while picturing what was going on in my own dog's brain.  Seldom do I read fiction that grabs me from the beginning and holds me until the very last word, and then wishing there was more. This was a wonderful escape from the cold, harsh reality of winter.  It was funny, sad, heartfelt and simply beautiful.

B00127RAJY|5|(This is my husband's account, but the review is from me). I used this video after each of my children were born. I am typically lean and in good enough shape. I lost 20 pounds to get to my pre-pregnancy weight in 3 weeks. I did only eat approximately 1000 calories each day, as well. I know, not the best method, but I needed fast result. What I did not expect was how my toned I became. I looked the best I have ever looked in my life after doing this video. Now, I needed fast results, so I did this video 5 days per week for 1 month. I also did the video 3-4 times in a row. (about 1-1.5 hours). I would do each circuit, each day, in a row. I got incredible muscle definition. Now, 2 years later, I started the video again after my twins were born and I needed to lose 15 pounds. I did that with this video in about 2 months and ate about 1500 calories/day. Also, I only did the video 3x/week and only 1 time on those days. My body looks lean and tight, but not nearly as toned. But, I'm still really happy with the results. This video is amazing and you get out of it what you put into it. I never get bored with it. I also rotate circuits each time I work out and I still get a burn after all this time. I actually just bought this dvd for the second time since my 2 year old used the first one as a chew toy. :)

0553208845|4|I first read SIDDHARTHA over thirty years ago.  The only impression it left upon me at the time was disappointment.  It seemed that Siddhartha really had not achieved much wisdom; he had simply grown old, after a life of mistakes, and finally resigned himself well enough to life's disappointments to be contented with life.  To be sure, that is no mean accomplishment, but quite a few ordinary people manage to achieve it.  Even I have, and I am not all that old yet.  Upon reading it again, I see that Siddhartha  is supposed to have achieved ultimate truth in the end.  I am fairly sure that when Hesse wrote the book, he himself had not yet achieved ultimate truth.  Did he ever?<br /><br />Siddhartha encounters Buddha while still quite young.  He sees that though Buddha has found truth, he is not able to teach it in such a way that his followers do.  So he does not become a disciple, but eventually finds the ultimate truth on his own.  The A true seeker can accept now doctrine, though one who has found the truth accepts all doctrines.  Carried to an extreme, and Siddhartha insists that it must be carried to the extreme, this means that contradictory doctrines are all equally true.  Since time is not real then sorrow and bliss, good and evil, and so on, are illusions.  This strikes unenlightened people like me as foolish - I really cannot acknowledge that Ted Bundy is not evil, nor that there is no difference between Auschwitz and Disneyland  -- but the truth always sounds foolish to the unenlightened.  This certainly makes the pronouncements of the enlightened impossible to criticize.<br /><br />In my unenlightened state, ultimate truth strikes me as pointless and gloomy.  I gather that since we are all eventually supposed to reach NIRVANA, or whatever, and there is no time, then none of mankind's suffering is real.  Well, it sure seems real; if it is not real, what on earth is its point?  I am skeptical when I am told that Buddhist monks are in possession of ultimate truth.  People read Siddhartha and tell me that they find it full of peace and wisdom.  But I will bet that I am not the only one who is left shaking his head.<br /><br />Hesse's prose is quite beautiful.  I imagine when it was written, SIDDHARTHA must have been one of the earliest Western accounts of Eastern philosophy.  It is well worth reading on these accounts.read Siddhartha and tell me that they find it full of peace and wisdom.

1400031362|3|Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third book in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith.  While this series is quite delightful, I found this book less entertaining and darker than the first two.<br /><br />The engagement plans of Precious Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni hit a snag when the groom-to-be comes down with a mysterious malady.  Mma Ramotswe not only has to run her detective agency, but also must oversee Mr. J.L B. Matekoni's garage, Tlokweng Rd. Speedy Motors.  This actually becomes more the story of Mma Makutsi, secretary and now assistant detective for the detective agency.  In addition to her detective agency duties, Makutsi is also made acting manager of the garage.  How she motivates the two, lazy, girl-crazy apprentices is a stitch.<br /><br />The agency deals with two cases in Morality for Beautiful Girls.  A government official suspects his brother is being poisoned by the brother's wife.  Mma Ramotswe must infiltrate the household as a guest to investigate the accusations.  Mma Makutsi digs into the backgrounds of four young ladies competing for the title of Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana.  Neither of these cases is as riveting as in the first two books.  Still, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books are better than most \\"fluffy\\" mystery series out these days, and I will definitely pick up book number four, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.

0064407667|5|Title: The Bad Beginning<BR>By: Lemony Snicket<BR>Reviewed by: B. Arihara<BR>Period: P.1<br />     The Baudelaire children Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are all wondering the beach when they receive terrible news that their parents have died in a fire which began in their house. Mr. Poe, the person to give them the news took care of the children until they were taken to their new father, Count Olaf. Count Olaf is a horrible evil man who is just interested in trying to get the Baudelaire fortune. He thinks of a scheme to receive the money, which can only be used by Violet when she is old enough to inherit it. Klaus eventually figures out Count Olaf's plan and tries to stop him, but instead gets them into more trouble. Olaf is going to have a play where he is the groom and Violet is the Bride. Justice Strauss, a neighbor who happens to be a judge, is the one who performed the wedding ceremony.  Once they both say their \\"I do's\\" and sign a piece of paper in front of a real judge, they will be officially married, which everyone thinks is just part of the play. Once they are married, Count Olaf will be able to take the Baudelaire money and dispose of the children. Unfortunately, everything has gone as planned and Violet and Count Olaf officially married as Olaf had thought. When Violet signed the piece of paper, she signed it with her left hand when she was right-handed, which means the document is invalid and they are not married. Justice Struaff arrested Count Olaf along with his assistants, and the Baudelaire children were taken away after saying their good-byes and thank-you's.<br />     One of the reasons why I liked this book was because the author explained, as he went along, the difficult words to understand. He saved some time for me by telling me what the words mean, so i don't have to take time and look them up in the dictionary. \\"The word nuptial means relating to marriage\\" is an example of his unique type of writing and so is \\"The word standoffish here means reluctant to associate with others.\\" Also i like how Sunny always says those baby words like \\"yeeka\\" or \\"odo yow.\\"<br />     I disliked this book because there was constantly bad things happening again and again. One after another terrible things happened to the Baudelaire children. They always got into trouble and when they thought of a plan, it was always ruined by Count Olaf or his assistants. Sometimes too many unpleasant happenings make a book not very enjoyable to read. There should be a little more happiness throughout the book.<BR>     <br />     My favorite part of the book is in the very beginning when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are walking along the beach shore. The way the author described it made me remember all the fun times I had at the beach. I remember running in the shallow water looking for sea-shells and playing in the water trying to catch small fish with my hands or a net. The beach is probably my favorite place to go in the world. Whenever i think of the beach i think of happiness, joy, fun, and good times.
B00HVEFCS8|1|I'm kind of biased, paid apps should not have in app purchases. maybe I would like the series more if there was a 6$ doodle app that incorporated and was updated and added to instead of a gazillion $2 apps. most of the apps have a lot of the same elements And combinations. I will never pay For a doodle app
0312641893|1|This was not a great book to read. The book started out interestingly enough, but started loosing me half way through and completely lost me before I could finish.<br /><br />The characters don't behave realistic. I just can't buy how quickly Prince Kai falls for Cinder, and how he responds to her. Cinder seemed interesting in the beginning, but her actions grow impulsive and stupid. She goes against the good advice, and makes such a scene multiple times and gets herself in more trouble...it's utterly frustrating. I can't read a book where you can't respect the characters.

B0006399FS|5|U2 hasn't sounded this good or natural since \\"Joshua Tree\\". \\"Achtung Baby\\" comes close, but \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\", besides scoring one of the most impressive displays of publicity I've seen in a long time for an album (think free NYC concert, iPod commercial, U2 iPod, The Leak, etc.), is solid in all fronts. The lyrics have grown every bit as much as the music, and they come from a \\"different\\" place too, many of them having been inspired by the passing of Bono's father.<br /><br />Joined by longtime collaborators Eno, Lanois, Flood and Lillywhite, production legend Chris Thomas (mixed Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and produced INXS' \\"Kick\\"), Nellee Hopper (think BJork, Madonna, Massive Attack) and Jacknife Lee, the Dublin-based foursome strikes a solid musical punch with this album. From the moment \\"Vertigo\\" hit the airwaves along with its insanely brilliant video, it was obvious that the album coming was not going to dissapoint. After the release, it is clear that U2 is at the top of their game.<br /><br />\\"Miracle Drug\\" maintains the power of the opening track, with a U2 sound that can make you weep of emotion, leading into track after track that don't dismay until well after the album is over... and you play it again, and again. Sure, I am a U2 fan. And this album only confirms my respect and admiration for their work, in the studio and outside of it, as spokespersons for the world's most worthy causes.

B00TOMSZCU|5|Very good graphics, the story line is very entertaining. I was hoping for a game like this. I love the puzzles a mysterious clues.
0440539811|2|I must admit, this book is wildly entertaining. However, I took off three stars because of the way in which it mangles the more complex philosophical questions. Wilson preaches a very narrow, dogmatic ethic of paranoia-- &quot;A, and never B, is what the smart person is afraid of, and C, and never D, is how he can escape...&quot; and that in itself would not be so bad, had he not also disguised it, very effectively, as open-minded nonpartisan questioning or &quot;neophilia.&quot; He accomplishes this disguise through a...very superficial...PRETENSE that he does not arrive at a single answer. Thus, he manages to obscure the real questions, and possibly the anawers, for those potentially insightful minds with little training in critical evaluation. Please do not take this book at all seriously if you are seeking wisdom. I doubt that Wilson himself does so, unless I underestimate his intelligence. In fact, to view this book as a parody of liberal-progressive metaphysics and the &quot;X-Files&quot; fnord contingent would be a much more enlightening, and funny, approach.
B00IK590UI|2|Take the original RoboCop. Remove all the important parts of the hero's journey, massively (and unnecessarily) inflate the front story, water down the action, add a unnecessary dialogue delivered by very high end actors, mix thoroughly, and flush down the toilet.<br /><br />PS: The random pieces of the original (lines/music/tech) sprinkled through it lessen the pain...but only slightly.

B0000AGWJ7|5|Im giving this cd a 5-star rating, because when i bought this cd I only knew of the band by one video that I saw on Fuse, It was Unholy Confessions, but at the very moment i heard that song i had to have the cd.  So when i bought it i was new to the whole A7X scene, and now after listening to this album i cant get enough of it it is by far one of the best albums i have ever heard.  I am a big music fan i like all different styles of rock.  But A7X uses a whole scale of different styles and jams them into one there own.  If you are a punk fan youll love them, if you like heavy metal you will love them, if you are a death metal fan you will love them, they have a lil alternative sound to them as well as others they just fit every expection of a band possible i hope my review on this album helps you out in any way possible!     A7X rocks!!!
B0039208CG|5|Great Movie! Who doesn't love a good Batman movie? This was one of my favorites and I was very excited when it came out on Bluray.
B006XF5BTG|5|After feeling that my physical fitness was deteriorating and I started some doing more Cardio I was not content with my results. So I started looking for some good advice how to improve my health and my looks. I was doubting my own common sense approach and the book certainly gave good practical advice, but it also gave it in a logical step-by-step way by creating a foundation of concepts and building on them. I have read very little on the subject, but I am convinced that the advice given in the book gives results.
B00008AY3L|5|I have been a huge fan of Ben Harper and he continues to amaze me! This album is brilliant, every song is unique and different. The style of this music can't be fit into one genre. My favorites are &quot;Touch From Your Lust,&quot; &quot;Amen Omen&quot; and &quot;So High So Low,&quot; though the whole album is great. I definitely recommend it!
B00004RF97|5|Hollywood has a long history of taking Broadway theatricals and turning them into successful films. In 1940, this process produced &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; which had been very popular while on the stage with Katherine Hepburn. As it happened, Katherine was given a lot of control over the film.  She chose all the leads and virtually had the film adaptation custom crafted for her. The end result was a fabulous cast, great performances and one of the funniest scripts ever produced. One final bit of trivia, the studio claimed to have shot the entire film without the need for any second takes.<br />For the most part, this is an interesting film because it has interesting characters. And like any good cuisine, the ingredients are added with impeccable timing and in such a way as to produce a very spicy result. Instead of identifying with one central character, we are forced to wear the shoes of at least three. James Stewart plays, Macaulay Connor, a dissatisfied reporter working for a society rag. He represents the white-collar class. Hepburn and Cary Grant each represent the upper class. Hepburn is Tracy Samantha Lord, a wealthy heiress who is planning to wed for the second time, after rejecting her first husband on the grounds of what seems to be  alcoholism. Grant plays that ex-husband, C. K. Dexter Haven, a now reformed drinker who is still in love with Tracy but is forced to make her life more difficult on the day before her upcoming nuptials.<br />There is a strong social commentary within the film. Tracy's betrothed, George Kittredge, is a working class lad who has worked his way to success. He is possibly the only unlikable character in the movie; as his ambitions are a little too obvious, his mind a little to shallow and his love a little too conditional. There is some early foreshadowing of doom for their relationship. The most obvious clue comes when George tries to mount his horse, after refusing help, and makes a botch of it. Each little scene is jam packed with meaning. The movie would certainly make an interesting study for film students.<br />All of the main characters, barring George, go through significant changes throughout the movie, even if they only change in our perceptions.  Tracy's ice-princess veneer is shattered and she becomes a warm, vulnerable and loving woman. Macaulay drops his prejudices, finds some moral fibre and finally stands up for what he believes in. Dexter forgives himself and in doing so, forgives Tracy. Even Tracy's Father turns out to be a caring and wise figure, instead of the distant, immoral playboy we hear described at the start.<br />Overall the film is too clever for words. They just don't make films like this anymore. It actually relies on the audience to get the joke. The puns, cultural references and interactions are not forced down our throat with a laugh track and a snare-drum. That's not to say you have to work hard to &quot;get&quot; this film; it's more like talking with your friends; you just understand, without further explanation. Everything about this film is perfect, which makes it a delight to watch time and time again. If you don't mind classic black and whites, you'll love Philadelphia Story.jam packed with meaning.

B000QCQ8Y4|5|I enjoy all of the Reacher stories. They are always fast paced.i like the math facts, the way he reasons things out. The attitude. Just a good story.
B0039TD7RC|5|To phrase Richard III \\"This is the winter of our discontent\\"  They had fled the UK to live as tax exiles.  Keith Richards looking worse for wear with every passing year.  Mick Jagger becoming more arrogant.  Brian Jones ghost was still haunting everyone.   Altamont concert still in the background and with all sides still blaming each other.  World was getting worse, men, women and children still dying in that meat grinder Vietnam, The Middle East coming up to the boil and Nixon not far away from telling everyone \\"I'm not a criminal\\"  Out of that chaos came Exile On Main Street, one of the greatest combinations of rock, country rock, blues and just little bit of folk music ever put on an album.  I won't analyse each song as this seems too have been done in great detail in other reviews and any way I think the songs speak for themselves.  When an album kicks of with a title like \\"(I wanna get my) Rocks Off\\", you just know it will be different.  This slice of early 70's music sits well on the shelf with The Who Who's Next album.
B00000DHRZ|4|ok first of all pretty fly (for a white guy) is not a poser song. It is however a song about posers and how gay the are...anybody who didnt notice this when they first heard the song was really bloody stupid and probably was a poser (posers usually are the ones to yell poser about others the loudest)....this a great cd over all, possibly their best....do not compare the offspring in anyway shape of form to good charlotte..if you do you deserve to be decapitated....the offspring was at one time on the same level as greenday back when greenday was good...Why dont you get a job and pretty fly for a white guy, which only account for two songs on the cd, are intentionally poppy, this is because the irony of it goes well with the song......

B00GUONXBI|3|Okay, I knew it was going to be an enviro-nagging game when I got it. FAOTD let's me put up with some nonsense for a try. The puzzles are cute and fun. Getting a message about water consumption, how much of the world doesn't have clean water, etc at the end of EVERY level gets old. Sorry, but little kids can't do anything about ANY of the issues being raised.<br /><br />The puzzles aren't bad, though I haven't run into any that are overly tricky, either.

B000P0J0G0|5|Okay, picture this.  J and I are on an airplane somewhere above the icy Atlantic heading toward London.  Ear buds in our ears, joined together by a splitter on our DVD player, laughing our heads off.  The people around us, not hearing the reason for our gaiety, must have thought we were lunatics.  We didn't care -- time was flying by and we were having too much fun watching the first two seasons of Fry and Laurie.  We were in London before we knew it.
B00ABKGG0C|5|I read so much of this genre I can't always remember who is who with a series. Guess it gets hard to tell them apart when every one is covered in chainmail and boiled leather and wields that big old special sword.  Not so with this book. There's a sword, but so far its only lopping heads with gusto. It isn't glowing or singing or making anyone's wash whiter and brighter. Our fantasy element is slowly introduced in a believable way-  much appreciated!  There's a well crafted story here. Looking forward to more interesting times. This book really pulled me in. If you've been there and read that with fantasy I'd recommend this one and have.
B00NWLIW0E|5|I love it!!!

B00B4FU6KE|5|The amount of detail and compassion required to write about this subject - don't want to give too much away, since the author keeps it under wraps at first, is amazing. I hope not to overuse the word. There are facts and research placed into a story of great generosity and painful honesty. The voice in the book tries to show all, the good, bad, and shameful  about herself and our scientific research and entertainment communities.
B00EL8I8IS|4|Fun movie for sci-fi fans.
B007Q476KU|5|Great story line
B00000720W|1|Black metal, considered by many to be \\"different\\" or \\"underground\\",is some of the worst music ever produced, right up there with pop and rap.  And Mayhem is no exception.  Lame guitar riffs, offbeat drums, and some of the most laughable sounding vocals ever recorded are compiled here into 20 minutes of teeth-grinding garbage.  Listen, people!  Black metal is underground for a very good reason.  IT SUCKS.  It's some of the most annoying and unoriginal music ever made, and if you're listening to it because you want to be \\"different,\\" then get your hands on something that is genuinely good and original, which is definitely not Mayhem.  All these guys are are a rehash of a bunch of corny horror movies, satanic nonsense, and names stolen strait from the Lord of the Rings (HA!  Count Grishnackh!).  Seriously, though, these guys are real dorks.  They sit around all day in their mom's basement, writing silly lyrics about how they murdered dozens of people (when they never have and never will) because people made fun of them too much when they were little.  Whoa! I guess that really does make them evil, and not just a bunch of untalented pyschotic posers who took D&D too seriously.
B003VS0CX8|5|We rented TSOM for my daughter and she loved it so much that I was considering buying it but was hesitant because of the price. (my husband loves the quality of Blu-ray and refuses to watch any other format). When I saw this on sale I snapped it up. We are impressed with the quality of the movie on Blu-ray.<br />As an added Bonus the package came with a DVD of the movie which we sent over to Grandma's house so she can watch it there too.<br />The Bonus features are decent, but what really made me purchase this was the price and I was not disappointed.

081297381X|4|One of the best business books I've ever read from a brilliant, cynical, humanist statistician.<br /><br />SUBJECT<br />The book is a philosophical rumination on human cognition- i.e. what do we think?

B00H58VGIA|5|Beautifully written. didn't know the history of these sisters. How important for all the world to know.
B000R7HY0K|5|In my mind there is no other word for this film. It serves as a terrific homage to Vanishing point and at the same time has the humor that we have come to expect from a Tarantino film. You never know what is about to happen and at the same time you do. It has a stellar cast and plot and at the same time has the feel of the classic car films.

0385341008|5|I didn't think I would be interested in a post WWII novel, but I loved this book from the first page!! I loved that it was written in letter style. The characters and their stories were real to me. They were quirky and witty and amazing. Their stories made me laugh and cry. I wanted it to keep going and going so I took my time finishing it so I could savor the ending. This is a book I will definitely read again and again!

B00846REIS|5|I thought Bared to you was an excellent book. I think comparing it to Shades of Grey is a good comparison. It was a very similar reading and I really enjoyed the book. It was well written and kept my interest throughout the entire story. This is crucial to me when reading a book and I felt this book met that expectation. I also recommend the rest of the Sylvia Day books. She is a great writer and I enjoy her style of books. Thank you for the novel Sylvia Day!

0060872675|1|This is not a children's book at all. The pictures could be upseting, there is not story behind it, the language is not what you want your kids to learn at an early age or ever! I have never read this author before, but I will certainly won't do it after this book. I am glad I did not buy it, my son picked it out at the library misled by the front picture.
B000FC10QG|5|Read this while I was doing my MBA Corporate Finance course. The course had a case study on the RJR Nabisco LBO/MBO, and reading this book added fantastic color and history to the case and class discussions. Besides the truly excellent penmanship of the authors, this story gives a superb glimpse into the the private equity industry and the entire ecosystem that makes it function. Finance students or enthusiasts - I would deem this a must read.
B000B5XOY8|5|I hate to tell people this, but what you see in \\"The Dark Knight\\" is not Batman, nor the Joker. This movie is a Batman movie, from the 40's, Tim Burton and the producers had gone back to Batman's early days as a crimfighter. And this is what was produced, all I can say is woooooooow, I still become alittle kid when I watch this movie. Micheal Keaton was the perfect choice to play Batman, And Jack's Joker is perfect. Batman actually acts like a detective in this movie, the movie opens with him beating the crap out of a couple of thugs. Then he disappears after uttering that now famous line \\"I'm Batman\\", not with a growl, but with a low menacing whisper. Then we're introduced to Jack Napier, as he's having an affair with his bosses mistress. Jack goes off to pay the mob's informant on the force, and now we're confronted with Vickie Vail and Alexander Knox, both working for the Gotham Globe. But wait, Mob Boss Carl Grissom wants to keep the new district Attorney Harvey Dent from getting to close to his businesses, so Jack suggests they break into Axis Chemicals. But he's signed his own death warrant, as Grissom asks him to be in charge of the job personally, since Grissom knows about the affair and is going to have Jack killed. But at the plant, the police interrupt Jack and his men. As does the mysterious figure, Batman. Jack gets shot in the face, and just before he falls into a vat, Batman tries to save him, but alas he can't, and Jack supposedly falls to his death. But he survived the chemicals, and it turns him into THE JOKER. He goes after Boss Grissom and kills him so he can take over the mobs of Gotham. Meanwhile, Bruce and Vickie start dating, but the Joker notices Vickie as well. And wants her as his as well, which leads to murder and Mayhem on the streets of Gotham, I forgot to mention a character in this movie. It's not a person, but it's THE BATMOBILE. A true Batmobile, that is sleek and menacing. Jack's Joker is what the Joker should be, Micheal Keaton is Batman. And surpisingly, Kim Basinger's Vickie Vale is a pretty decent Character, even if she gets let into the batcave. And we get one of the greatest moments in the Batman movies, when Bruce wayne suits, and Danny Elfman's score is incredible. An Awsome, awsome movie. Better than \\"The Dark Knight\\"Batman.

B006GH6IWU|5|I am a huge Queen fan and have seen most of the documentaries on them and also on Freddie Mercury.  However, this one seemed more &#34;authentic.&#34;  The interviews were mostly of Brian and Roger and others that actually knew them all during that time.  Many documentaries, I wonder just how much some of the people knew them, or are of fans reactions to stuff.<br /><br />The part where Brian and Roger describe Freddie's illness and eventual demise were beyond touching.  Had me in tears.<br /><br />Of course my husband loved the footage of the Bicycle Race video shoot.  (eye roll)<br /><br />Highly recommend it

B0034G4OY0|2|After watching the trailer, I saw this movie with high hopes, but was let down after the first scene. It became immediately apparent that they spend half their budget to recreate an unrealistic-looking tsunami just so they could grab people's attentions with the trailer, and that's not necessarily my biggest complaint. Rather, Hereafter sets a premise, but does not follow through with much character development, and has no ending. It is merely half of a movie -- one that could have been something like a Lifetime channel original, but does not even make it that far.
B002ZB26AO|4|This is a well crafted account of the lives of those North Koreans who were able to defect to South Korea. Barbara Demick unfolds a masterful account of life in North Korea. I found myself increasingly interested in the stories of the defectors who were able to find a way into South Korea. Their suffering and sacrifices for each other helped me identify with their humanity. This is a very worthwhile read. Unfortunately, it is not fiction.

B0058FW06Y|5|I honestly think this movie is brilliant. If you read through Rotten Tomatoes' reviews of it, you'll see that neither its supporters nor its detractors tend to understand it. Watch it with the eye of a literary critic, look for the themes, and enjoy the intelligence of the film. It doesn't spoonfeed you like most of us are used to in film - you actually have to think about what you're observing. If you have the patience for that, then go for it.
B0009YA386|5|Look out Interpol, Editors have come out swinging. \\"Back Room\\" is a solid debut album, quite possibly one of the best albums of the year. In the past few years that has seen an uprising in post punk/nu wave band, Editors have come out and set the perfect example of how to make dark love songs that make you wanna dance.  <br />Right of, you notice the likeness of Tom's voice to that of Ian Curtis. But once you get past that you'll notice that he has his own identity as he crafts beautiful, meaningful songs without any \\"nah nahs\\" or \\"hey heys\\". Accompanied by swirling guitars, thumping bass lines and heart pounding drums, These English blokes create music that will actually capture your attention. In my opinion, the best track is \\"All Sparks\\" which brings me back to 1985. The drums on this track and heavy and almost made me question if a live drummer was used. The lyrics, although a bit negative, are simply amazing.  <br />In all, \\"Back Room\\" is a ray of light that has been long overdue and with I hope they're able to continue with this formula. If your a fan of Interpol, Depeche Mode or even Placebo, This is a must have for your collection. <br />

B00005JPAO|3|This is a film about what politicians and celebrities \\"owe\\" the public and the media. The message of the film is that it is the duty of a public figure to give \\"the people\\" what they want even if it doesn't necessarly reflect the actual emotions of the person in question. <br /> <br />The film begins with the death of Princess Diana. Her death initiates a media circus and she is treated as a great person though in life she accomplished little other than getting lots of press coverage for herself. The politicians immediately make the rounds of the media programs, say all the right things and express the manipulative \\"false\\" emotions that press/public want to hear. But the royals themselves and especially the queen are not in front of the press making the expected over the top dramatic false emotional displays of \\"grief\\". They also don't immediately move back to the media center of London. In the film's view of things, these are \\"bad\\" things. <br /> <br />The film, like many people today, assumes that there is \\"one\\" right way to show the emotion of grief and that such displays need to be made in front of the Cameras as quickly as possible. The idea that individuals have different ways of expressing emotion is lost in the self-help fed culture of amature experts. Phillip, for scheduling activities to take the children's mind off the tragedy is made out to be a \\"monster\\". But who is really the monster? Is it a man who attempts to keep children away from a media circus or is it the people who want to feed those children into the media circus? <br /> <br />The queen and company not returning to London starts to ignite events in London. The press, unhappy at not getting the story they wanted, starts to fuel public opinion against the Queen. The politicians then start to see the unpopularity of the Queen as a drag on the popularity of their party and start putting pressure on. The people (and really the media as well) are demanding a public show of grief for Diana. The queen must give the people what they expect. The life and death of modern politics: Poll Numbers are dragged out as a reason why the Queen must make an over the top false public display of grief that she doesnt want to make. But she resists. <br /> <br />Meanwhlie, the media has stirred up the crazies that follow on the edges of celebrity. The film tries hard to convince us that unbalanced people who express \\"grief\\" by putting \\"they (the royals) have your blood on their hands\\" are somehow normal people. Diana was a divorced woman who died in a traffic accident in Paris. What kind of person blames the ex-mother in law in \\"blood on your hands\\" terms? Thats crazy-talk. And yet the film treats it as a real expression of public opinion. <br /> <br />More pressure is brought and finally the queen attempts to make a public statement herself. But in the most surreal moment of the film, the political PR people demand that the statement be rewritten so that the words \\"sound human\\". Incredibly, the film's message here is that a real message by a real human being sounds less human than text written by a bunch of Public relations hack writers.  <br /> <br />We live in an age where public moments and public emotions are scripted. Where the words and feelings of real people don't sound human to many of us anymore and where we demand (as the film does) made-for-tv moments of false grief. And if we don't get them, the person responsible must be destroyed. <br /> <br />The Queen makes the statement. The media and press get what they want. The politicians get what they want. And \\"the people\\" seem to get what they want. But the question I was left with was why the statement was necessary. Why do public figures \\"owe\\" the media or \\"the people\\" anything?  And what especially do they owe the public emotional displays that are often false? <br /> <br />This film is a message film. It is blatently one-side and manipulative. It is all the worse because it uses real people who are still alive to make its points. Some people do extraordinarily well in the film as to their portrayal. Others are played almost as charactures. <br /> <br />The message the film wants to present is that the old \\"out of touch\\" royals need to modernize themselves. The message that the film unintentionally presents is that modern public life is entirely fake and driven by the stories the media decide to present. If you give the media the story they want, you are a good person and they will treat you well. If you don't give them what they want, they will fill the newsprint and airtime with attacks on you. <br /> <br />According to the film's thinking, the right reaction for a Queen on hearing of Diana's death would have been to rush off to consult public relations experts and get everyone in front of the TV cameras as quickly as possible. Regardless of real emotions, they should have acted out film or television movie \\"grief\\". Everything and every word would have been scripted and planned out with regard to media coverage day by day until the funeral. <br /> <br />The film might have been better if it had dealt with the broader implications of events and been less one-sided. But it didn't. The iconic moment of the movie is when the speechwriters come in to change the words of a real person to make them sound \\"more human\\". There is so much wrong with that, words fail. <br /> <br />
0316286443|5|This book is great! It has pictures of step by step makeup application, tricks of the trade and at the end very exotic looks. I LOVE IT!
B00GIXY4M8|5|This movie was awesome. We'll written, graphics were well done.<br />Once you start watching you get sucked in completely. Great job!
B008MG1E4A|3|It was interesting to get an account of what happened, but the writing style was not very sophisticated.  The author is clearly not a writer by trade, but it was a decent read.
B009IF82SK|5|Big Bang continues to make me laugh with every episode. I highly recommend it. It is interesting to see Sheldon's relationship progress.
B002H09I0Y|5|With both Michael Douglas and Sean Penn in the same movie, what could go wrong?!  Excellent &#34;cliffhanger!&#34;
B00FAPF5U0|2|When I'm close to clearing the screen, I'll buy 5 moves or other bonus. Many times the app store<br />purchase resets the page so I lose my game progress, negating the reason for this purchase. Too long to regenerate lives. Only have a few minutes to waste time each day!
B00V4JJPKM|3|Enjoyed the music and cinematography. The actors were cast well overall. It didn't wow me but I really enjoyed it.
B008IJT0CE|5|I'm glad I found this app.  With all the stress I've been through lately, I needed something to calm me and this does the trick.  I use it every chance I get.
B00K4P7TEG|5|Nice relaxing game.
B00C5R7B0I|3|slow and not very interesting. drags on and on.
6300263673|5|my favorite movie
B00FRQ32N4|1|Not any game I would want to play
B00B5HQLMI|5|Kick Ass movie, who does not like 00 movies, been watching since I was a kid and do not remember ever seeing a bad one.
B0068TJLSY|1|AWFUL!!!!   JJ Abrams needs to do better research if he wants to do Sci-Fi. The kid stops the alien from eating him by telling the creature, \\"I understand\\". What are you kidding?
B000A6T1JU|5|I won't detract any stars for the movie because it rates all 5 of the stars I've given it, and Amazon will apply this review to all versions of this movie, but I absolutely HATE the comic book feel to this Ultimate Director's Cut.  It turned a serious and well-crafted movie into a joke.  The Warriors is a classic film that stands on its own, this Ultimate Director's Cut is a travesty.<br /><br />Love The Warriors, hate the UDC.  -kd5-
B00JB3MVCW|5|Excellent movie. It held your interest from beginning to end.
B001QJUX24|5|as are millions of others, i am a great john wayne fan and to me this was one of his finest jobs of acting
B0014Z4OQG|4|when the movie first started I was ready to take it out! but I was patient! once it got going it turned out to be a good movie.  I reccomend this movie.  I would watch it again. Good acting and good special effects. I JUST HATED THE ENDING!
B007SGLZP8|4|This was a clever story and a pleasant read. I always appreciate the nuances of the legal system that Grisham is able to spin into a compelling tale.
B00A6CCF0K|5|Fun read..learned alot
B003G4W49C|4|It was very well read in and though it was in the future it still show man that still can be mean, callus to there own people. But it did show that the next generation gives hope for peace in the world and buoyed the stars.
B004LWZWGA|5|I saw this movie in theaters and enjoyed it so very much. I really like the way that they ended the The Dark Night series. This one had me thinking that I knew who the villain was for a very long time, only to find out that I was completely wrong.
B00ISJO1D2|5|&#34;Death whispered to Robin Stuart.&#34; That's how she hooked me. I read the first line and I knew I was in for a great story. Everyone sort of imagines the Grim Reaper whispering. I shivered when I read that line and thought of that great film with Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. The ghosts definitely whispered there.<br />Every once in a while, the graphic gory descriptions made me turn my head away only to rush back for more. It's not for nothing that Conduit won a Readers' Favorite Book Award. The twists and turns and surprises but no spoilers here. You have to pick it up. Well, I can't resist just one detail: Psychic. I won't say any more, but I love anything that delves into other senses, other ways of perceiving. I found another writer to follow closely. Definitely going to pick up her other books.
B009UX2YAC|3|This app is very fun I love it all of my kids do to it is super fun. Another app similar to this one is temple run I use both of these apps on my kindle and it is great
B00BWBHIUG|4|Lots of fun and grandkids really enjoy playing and learning about an ocean reef.
0857522329|5|Good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I loved every word of this book. I read the other reviews saying that this wasn't the Katniss that we are not used to, but she is definitely the same ol' Katniss, just as badass as before. Yes, she hides in closets, but she also rather be on the front line than just stay put. Anyway, lots of twists and turns, heart break and anger. The end of each chapter is a crazy cliffhanger. This book is great and a great way to end the series. This one leaves you with no questions. Deserving of 5 stars.
0767805712|5|Havent seen this movie in about 20 years and it still kept me at the edge of my seat.
B000AMJG4Y|2|I have the Japanese edition of this movie as well and I have to agree that it needs some heavy editing. I played the game and I still found its obvious lack of proper editing more than a little annoying. <br /> <br />Now, obviously, this movie is targeted at a niche market, otherwise there would be better back-story build-up. So, on the one hand, if you're a fan of the videogames, by all means, pick this up. <br /> <br />On the other hand, if you're a casual fan, you'll find this to be mediocre at best. You may find the artwork to be alright but it's not even the best of its genre -- to put it in perpsective, the original Ghost in the Shell's artwork was better.
B00J2PCCYQ|5|Its a really good movie. Disney did a great job with the animation and the whole theme of independence and courage
B004VMUS9G|5|Thanks for this alarm clock,
0060832819|5|Master storyteller Paulo Coelho's stories are all semi-autobiographical in nature, read well, are set in fascinating locations, and leave you thinking the author has somehow seen more deeply into the human spirit than most of us.  It's hard to read his books without feeling deeply touched, and The Zahir is no exception.<br /><br />There are themes of love, belonging, separation, anxiety, heartbreak, understanding, alienation, need, want.  Many settings, in many places including Paris, Madrid, Kazakstan.  The themes are ones that absorb all humankind whether we realize them or not.<br /><br />I read this book at a bad time in my life, pulling it randomly from my wife's bookshelf, and being pulled into the book as if it were somehow the correct choice of all the books I could have picked.  It spoke to me deeply of love and understanding, in a way that I think many couples, many who have loved or lost will instantly empathize with.  Following in the narrator's steps, we arrive where he does, gain wisdom as he does, and achieve enlightenment as he does.  And hopefully, find and regain true love that had been neglected, as he does.<br /><br />Coelho's native language is not English, yet none of his writing feels \\"translated\\" or stilted like happens to many foreign writings when they appear in English.<br /><br />It is as if the author has a special gift for storytelling that transcends individual languages, the the vast number of countries in which his books have been published seems to support that.<br /><br />Whether you are looking to be entertained by a lively tale, or are seeking solace and understanding as I was, The Zahir will fill your need.  If you are in need of both then it behooves you to read everything this master storyteller has written.
B00DW36G32|5|Two terrific actors doing their jobs well. Enjoyed the plot and the performances of the stars. Well done movie with a fast-moving pace with lots of excitement.
B004UB9SKS|5|So much better than I expected  it to be. Love hearing the words as well.  And what a great introduction to other languages.
B000002H97|5|One of My all time favorite bands is Metallica! The music they perform and the sound is incredible! I love how the songs are as they are long and has non-stop excitement! My favorite member in the band is James Hetfield and he is also one of My favorite singers. In My opinion there is no one else like him. I just love the way he sings! If you are a Metallica fan get this CD! <br /> <br />
B009JZSC9S|5|This continues to be one of the best things on the air!  Great cast and great stories both bittersweet and funny.  I hope it continues with the same quality as they go forward!
B00AF6MF9I|4|Nice game to start. The game needs more levels to go through. The recent update just added an underwater area and some area to expand on land but there are fewer challenges once you get go the higher levels. It does play good but one critique is that it sometimes loses your place when you go back to the game and you have start all over again.
B00005JMYI|4|Will Ferrell shines in this movie about the old boy's club at a 1970's TV news show being threatened like anything when--of all things--a WOMAN is hired to join the crew. Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgundy; Cristina Applegate plays Veronica Corningstone, the newcomer on the block with a strong willed desire to be an anchor herself. Farrell, especially being the male chauvinist as he is, sees Corningstone's arrival as yet another chance to have himself a conquest. Corningstone, predictably in this type of plot, wants no part in an office romance. Worse yet for Ron Burgundy and his male buddies on the news show: newcomer Veronica Corningstone actually knows something about journalism!<br /><br />There are numerous funny moments in this movie here on DVD. There's of course the gang warfare between five (count 'em, five) separate news channels that's really well done. Another scene worth mention is the scene with Ron's dog that despite being a bit troubling is actually hysterical. There's Steve Carrell as the weatherman with a questionable IQ level who refers to the state of Iowa as \\"the Middle East.\\"  Moreover, there are some great cameos by such pros as Tim Robbins, Danny Trejo and Ben Stiller.<br /><br />While watching this movie you get the sense that the actors really wanted to do it to showcase their talents and just plain have fun making a fun movie. My advice is not to go into this comedy expecting it to be literally flawless. Instead, this comedy flick is perfect for the person who wants to enjoy some laughs and funny situations while relaxing their brain and not worrying about following a complicated plot. Yes, I know, there's the subplot theme of the 70's feminist movement, but without any doubt this takes a back seat to the comedy.<br /><br />The DVD comes with great extras that increase its value. Extras include the \\"Making of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\\" bloopers and deleted scenes, and (of course) the \\"Ron Burgundy A&E Biography.\\" Sound and picture quality are very good.<br /><br />I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time! Fans of Farrell and the Saturday Night Live style of comedy are going to be especially pleased with the way they made this DVD! The extras make it all the more worthwhile.d picture quality are very good. <br /> <br />I would encourage you to get this DVD: the movie itself is very good for a fun time!

0307272702|5|Completely changed my thought process on how macro foods work, and most importantly, my attitude towards those who may be obese.  To focus on the CAUSE of obesity and not just SYMPTOMS is critical here.    I also appreciate the abundant research cited throughout the book. It's not new, but as often said, what was old is now new again.

0545123275|5|I loved this book! The author managed to weave an intriguing story with distinct and lovable characters and a gripping plot. Her use of language is beautiful and poetic. She is skillful enough to make the switching of narrators feel seamless, while maintaining their individual voices. This is a book that makes you feel as if you live and breathe with the characters. At times it made me laugh out loud. At times it made me cry bitterly. Books like this make me love reading. I cannot wait to get my hands on the next installment!
B0039SFKSW|2|Oh sorry, guys!! But once again (after \\"Phoenix\\")- also regarding of their worst album-cover ever (Roger Dean, where have you been recently?), They perform some normal and quite poppy songs here (whose length is about 5 minutes and each one having got the same mood tune by tune, as long as it's not concluded...), which is not so good after all!! I understand their business strategy, I know it's necessary for them to survive in the modern music market of nowadays, but the other songs (perhaps with the exception of \\"Holy War\\"), are useful within a John Wetton solo album (with all my respect for an album like \\"Arkangel\\" or \\"Battle lines\\", just to mention a couple among the other solo works), but it doesn't reflect the job of a superband...each member with his own important talent should be worth in producing something different (do you remember their remarkable return on stage? Well probably it's the unique album regarding their new era- entitled \\"Fantasia\\"- which is well worth checking out...) .  C. Palmer and Steve Howe instead would have been more involved in the instrumental passages, if the songs were more technical and a little bit \\"symphonic\\"; but of course, talking about the present work (even though \\"Omega\\" should be the antipode of \\"Alpha\\" and- unlike this latter anyway inferior than their debut album- it's often easy), it doesn't implicate automatically that it can't contain a few features of prog music inside!! Nevertheless I recognize their new attempt: that is They try to avoid some stupid compromises, like within a few commercial hit ballads in general, and moreover (even though G. Downes is fond of the analogical and old synthesizers, producing an old and \\"dated\\" sound) this latter keyboard- player is always able to play according to his own melodic liking...which is perfectly \\"coupled\\" with the mood of the leader J. Wetton, who unfortunately has almost ignored the skill regarding the other two veterans (once upon a time one of the best drummers withinthe prog scene along with one of the most talented guitarists, sharing the same scene for many years). If you are completely into the prog world you'll give this \\"Omega\\" one star in the evalution; otherwise, judged as a poppy album, the present work is quite good...I'm happy to see them live on stage anyway, but please don't let me judge their studio albums anymore!!

B00GCE3TCE|5|I am an avid reader of books,  but never before have I been so moved by the written word. Markus Zusak has such a  beautiful way with them that it brought a tear to my eye as he described such a simple thing as a tear falling down Mama's cheek. I haven't the words, the right words to describe the effect this book had on me.
B00005JMJ4|1|This is the worst movie i ever bought according to reviews from editorial amazon, the film budget is poor 4 million, revenues prove it and acting is terrible (also the filming) i will never buy according to editorial revue again cause they decieve u with nice wordings into buying (or they will be out of there jobs !!!)
1422188612|2|I was expecting this book to be more tactical in nature.  Do this day one, do this day 30, etc.  In my opinion, this book was a little too academic and read like a thesis for a PhD.  I know others have loved it, but not quite what I had expected or was looking for.
B003Y5H5HO|3|The major difference between the Swedish version and the American version, is the portrayal of Lisbeth Salander.<br /><br />First: If you read the novels, you know that Lisbeth Salander was only 5 feet tall and weighed 90 lbs.  In the Swedish original, Noomi Rapace is actually 5'3\\" tall, and in the American remake Rooney Mara is 5'6\\".  Folks, there was a reason author Stieg Larsson made his heroine 5 feet tall.  He wanted this little girl to be a gallon of nitroglycerine read to explode -- like she did when she kicked ass on two Hells Angel types.  This was an essential part of the plot -- that someone so small, could be so violent.  Making her 5'6\\" loses this dramatic point.<br /><br />Second: Facially, in the novels, Lisbeth is not pretty, or would even be considered attractive on any level.  She is described as having a boyish figure and facial piercings.  This is accomplished in the Swedish version with Noomi Rapace -- nude, she is flat chested and her body and face are just so-so.  In bed she is not truly sexy or sensual -- she gets on, gets off, and is finished.  She does not make love.  The Swedish director deliberately cast this actress to accomplish this faithfulness to the novel.  The American director made Rooney Mara look -- at times -- beautiful.  She does not have a boyish body; she has a very young womanly body with normal size breasts. In bed, she is very attractive.  Very sexual, very sensual.  She makes love.  This is not Larsson's Lisbeth.<br /><br />Third: Psychologically, Lisbeth is an introvert who is filled with hostility.  In the Swedish version, the reporter slowly works his way into her confidence, and she (somewhat) lets her guard down for him.  The American version carries none of Lisbeth's borderline psychosis.  Rooney Mara, as Lisbeth, just \\"acts\\" like she is pissed off at the world.  It doesn't take much for the reporter to get her into bed.<br /><br />Conclusion: Stieg Larsson in his triolgy set himself a monumental task:  He asked himself, can I make a small unattractive girl, who is extremely introverted and hostile, and continually acts antisocial and like a bitch -- have the reader (audience) come to like (maybe love) her? This is a girl that we would never sit next to on a crowded bus -- but by the end of the novels (movie) we'd have her over for dinner.  Make no mistake, probably 90% of everyone who saw the Swedish film disliked this obnoxious character from the opening scenes, but by the end of the movie we were rooting for her.  The American version loses this quality of character.  Rooney Mara is tall, attractive, and her Lisbeth is not really super obnoxious or completely introverted.  Once again, her version of the character just \\"acts\\" pissed off.  The director missed the point.<br /><br />Sure, see both versions, and maybe read the books.  If you want Lisbeth Salander, you will only find her in the Swedish version.  The reviewers who thought the American version was as good or better than the Swedish version, did not understand the character of Lisbeth.
B0000DJZA5|5|Can't someone just like listening to a voice and instrument, raw with all its flaws, and enjoy it without all these nitpickers tearing it apart?  Long and Winding Road, and Let It Be, have always been two of my favorite Beatles songs.  I've heard both a thousand times, but never have been moved to tears by them until hearing them on the Naked cd.  There is no wall-of-sound to cover up Paul's quivering voice on Long and Winding Road.  And now Let It Be seems to be speaking to the listener, not just recorded for an audience.  I may not be a music expert, schooled in technique and Beatles history, but a love song sung by Paul without the Specter-hoopla has brought several tears to my eyes lo after all these years.  Don't compare it to the original album.  Buy and enjoy it as a labor of love by true song-writers, the way they sounded in the studio all by themselves.

B00M4BJ3KG|5|Good  classic gameplay
B000VSYDRM|1|I decided to watch this movie based on the description, the actors, and the decent reviews.  I am reviewing this movie because I found it to be a complete disappointment.  I came to this movie with the knowledge of it being based on a well-received book, but I have not read it.  My opinion is based solely on the movie.<br /><br />The movie was beautifully made.  The setting, the people, the costumes.  I found that all to be believable and it pulled me into the movie.  Initially there were parts I liked and parts I had to suspend belief a bit to watch, but I do not have a problem with that.  If I like a movie, I like it.  It doesn't matter if it got poor reviews or if I understand why others don't like it.  So I kept watching.  Warning:  Spoilers to follow.  Don't read further if you don't want to know what happens.<br /><br />Here are some of the problems I had with the movie.  Each on their own I may have been able to look past, or even a couple, but when put together, it was just too much.  A man can smell a perfume and recreate it IN SECONDS, grabbing CLOSED BOTTLES of essences from around a large room without pause, even though these bottles are clustered with countless others.  He pours these essences in the proper quantities and shakes them together, voila, identical perfumes.  This same man thinks he can preserve the odor of a cat by basically boiling the cat.  Having seen blood and death, it never occurs to him that the scent will change from the living cat to the dead, cooked cat.  The man, trying to follow a woman who smells good to him, figured out that she left town, and what direction she went in, simply by waking and breathing.  From what was apparently miles away.  In open countryside.  So incredible is this man that, using the scent of over a dozen women (now dead), he was able to release a few drops of this incredible perfume, turning an angry mob, screaming for his death because of all the women he murdered, into a mass of people who now saw him as an angel and proceeded to have sex in a courtyard with the person nearest them, no matter how unlikely the match.  They then all went to sleep there or passed out while he escaped.<br /><br />The man journeys to the place he was born, which he found by smell, because apparently the place smelled exactly the same as it did when he formed the memory as a newborn.  He then douses himself with the rest of the fragrance, entrancing a smaller group of people (huh? really?) who are so taken by the fragrance that they CONSUME him on the spot.  Yes.  They ate him.<br /><br />I honestly expected to be mildly disappointed that this was a dream just before his death.  My disappointment was so much greater when I saw that this is supposedly what happened.  I was willing to accept everything up until he created a scent that was able to enchant people the way it did.  I can honestly say out of all the movies I have seen, plenty that I liked and a fair number I did not, this would have to be the very last movie I would recommend to anybody.<br /><br />Again, I did not read the book, and it is entirely possible I would feel differently.  If you haven't read the book and you've made it this far in my review, well, you've been warned.an angel and proceeded to have sex in a courtyard with the person nearest them, no matter how unlikely the match.

B000002J0B|5|Houses Of The Holy is Led Zeppelin's fifth album and their followup to the classic Led Zeppelin IV also known as Zoso. The band waited two years to release this album which while now commonplace in the music industry was considered an eternity at the time. While not containing as many classic tracks as Led Zeppelin II or IV, this is their most diverse collection and the last album they would release which was great from beginning to end.<br /><br />The album begins with its heaviest track \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" which spotlights Jimmy Page's distinctive solos and solid riffs and the creative bass work of John Paul Jones. This leads into the majestic ballad of \\"The Rain Song.\\" One of their greatest and most overlooked tracks, the track features one of Robert Plant's most emotional vocal performances and the inclusion of strings and keyboards which add a beauty to the song which is absent on the more famous \\"Stairway To Heaven.\\" The track \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\" with its memorable acoustic intro is the most enduring track here and remains a staple of AOR radio. Then we get into previous uncharted waters as \\"The Crunge\\" is a great funk workout spotlighting the rhythm section of Jones and drummer John Bonham while \\"D'yer Maker\\" shows the band doing a remarkable job of dipping into reggae and being rewarded with a Top 20 hit. \\"The Ocean\\" is another great track featuring a memorable riff from Page which has been sampled by both the Beastie Boys on \\"She's Crafty\\" and by Plant himself on \\"Long Cool One\\" before shifting into an a capella vocal during the middle then finally breaking into a groove straight out of the '50s complete with doo wop vocals at the track's close. The remaining tracks, the slow and moody \\"No Quarter\\" and the mid-tempo rocker \\"Dancing Days\\", are also very good. This is the last classic album the band would release where everything worked as future albums such as Presence and In Through The Out Door were uneven efforts despite their eclecticism. Highly recommended.ism. Highly recommended.

B00I8Q77Y0|5|This app is soooooo much fun! It's much like Flappy Bird. I find it easy to play it on my Kindle Fire than My IPhone.
B00G32OMF8|3|The conclusion of a love story,but not sure it was needed
B00992CF6W|5|I don't understand the objective of this game,but my son loves it! He is always playing it. Definitely a hit with the pre teens.
B00DHKKN6Q|5|Snuffed fun to the max
0316322407|4|I gave this to my granddaughter.  She was so moved by Anne Frank, I thought she would like to read about this modern day amazing young woman, who is her age.  I do not know if she's read it.  We never discussed.
B003ZSJ212|5|Yeah he liked it
B003G4W49C|5|Awesome story that pulls you in, twists the plot and follows with a resolving ending. Definitely recommended for just about anyone.
0439023491|5|I read this trilogy on the suggestion of my step daughter and I was truly impressed with the writing and compelling story line of this set.<br /> I read the first one seperatly and had to purchase the rest of the series since the first one was just so good! I had not even finished the first one when I knew I needed to read the rest. It was well written, intriguing as well as thought provoking. I found it not to be predictable and interesting.. the characters are vivid and likeable or dispictable depending on the intention..<br /> I strongly recommend all to read this trilogy as it is just amazing !!!
B004SBULWE|1|Never never!!<br />I was installed this app, and my kindle were slow down.<br />I didn't see this app ever. So what I talking to yours is<br />DO NOT USE THIS APP ON KINDLE FIRE HD 7&quot;<br />It like a gum on the road. Make me shit.
B0087DFIYA|5|This movie was filmed in the hearth of Veracruz City, inside of the Allende prison (Penal de Allende) that was vacated almost exclusively for this purpose. I loved it and I think that is an eye opener for foreigners who do not know how the Mexican &#34;justice&#34; system works, where prisons are run by drug dealers and kingpins. It is an action movie, fast, with lots of twists and changing situations. I really do not understand people that hate Mel Gibson movies, when so many &#34;action&#34; movies being so bad are not criticized enough (I yet do not understand how is it possible that 3 sequels of &#34;The Expendables” were done.)<br />I would recommend this movie to a friend. Is an entertaining, &#34;educative&#34; movie.
B0002IU988|5|There is only one word to describe this album--excellent!  The departure of Scott Stapp from the band has actually made them better.  Gone are the sappy love songs along with the over-mellow voice.  The new lead singer, Myles Kennedy, is MUCH better!  His voice is a lot fuller, and he sings with passion and meaning.  Kennedy brings the songs to life vocally, and the great guitar riffs and percussion bring them to life musically.  The two best songs here are \\"Find the Real\\" and \\"Open Your Eyes\\", which have nothing to do about love but have everything to do about the human spirit and the things beyond this life.  This album is quite a rocker and quite enjoyable when you are in a \\"rock out\\" kind of mood.
B000003NA4|5|A great voice, well mastered. When you hear Diana Krall's voice in this CD, you can find something wrong in a lot of great jazz vocalists.
B001AZI1PA|5|Whenever you think of Jim Henson's Muppets, the fuzzy kooky variety shows and entertaining adventures of Miss Piggy, Gonzo and Kermit the Frog come to mind.<br /><br />But these versatile puppets have been used for far more dramatic effects in \\"The Dark Crystal,\\" an exquisite little fantasy story that happens to be entirely populated by puppets. Not a live person in sight, from start to finish. Henson and Brian Froud conjured up a gloriously detailed world -- full of fantastical flora and fauna, crystalline castles and strange creatures -- and wrapped it around a solid coming-of-age story.<br /><br />On another world, there are two strange races that appeared one thouysand years ago -- the enormous, gentle, peaceful Mystics, and the nasty, vulture-like, vicious Skekses who ruin the surrounding lands. Both races are somehow connected to a massive crystal that was broken a thousand years ago, and now a shard is missing from it. What's more, three suns are about to come into conjunction, and the shard has to be back in place when that happens.<br /><br />The Mystics have cared for one of the last Gelflings, an orphan named Jen whom they rescued from the insectile Garthim. As the conjunction approaches, they send him out to find the lost shard. Along the way, Jen gains the crystal shard for himself, and meets the only other living Gelfling, Kira. Now they must both evade the Skekses' Garthim henchmen and bat-winged spies, and somehow infiltrate their castle. But what will happen when the suns line up, and the crystal is completed?<br /><br />Many fantasy movies slap together a story that has been told many times before, but increasingly without interest -- throw in swords, some monsters, a brave prince or farm boy, and some evil witch/queen/wizard/Dark Lord. But fortunately nothing is so simple in \\"The Dark Crystal\\" -- although the origins of the Skekses and Mystics are pretty obvious from the very start of the movie, the journey along with Jen is what really makes this interesting.<br /><br />Instead of some pan-medieval land, \\"The Dark Crystal\\" aims at portraying a truly alien world, and Brian Froud's slightly weird designs make it seem so -- strange swamp reptiles, colorful anemones, vast crystalline castles, desiccated vulture-like creature, shrieking fuzzballs, and gorgeous forests full of strange plants and animals that tend to move and act in unique ways. \\"The Dark Crystal\\" leaves you feeling like you've been transported to some other planet.<br /><br />Additionally, this film also has the honor of being the first major movie to entirely star puppets, with nary a human being in sight -- some of those puppets still walk in a herky-jerky Muppet manner, but their design is utterly detailed and believable, from Jen's sort-of-human, fawnlike features to the vast four-armed Mystics, and the rattling armored Garthim soldiers. And the special effects end up being pretty spectacular, especially during the chaotic literally earthshattering climax -- while the finale is rather predictable, it is no less awe-inspiring for that.<br /><br />At times it feels like the characterization gets a backseat to the movie's visuals, but Jen and fellow Gelfling orphan Kira are fairly likable, naive young heroes who develop a cute little romance throughout the story. The various Skekses are given individual quirks and personalities (such as the annoying Chamberlain who won't stop humming).  Not to mention the abrasive, lumpy witch Aughra, who's an absolute riot (\\"Whole world might burn up... hmph... end of Augra!\\") and Kira's toothy fuzzball Fizzgig.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Crystal\\" has some predictable plot twists, but it is also a glorious visual feast and a coming-of-age journey with the Gelflings, leading to a finale both awe-inspiring and bittersweet.

B000023VR6|5|Hello everybody! This is one of Dre's best CD's out there!! He's got  everybody in it from Eminem to Snoop Dog! You name the person and he's in  here!! This is a must buy for any rap fans out there! I saw the Up in Smoke  concert 2 days ago and it was well worth it!!
1484707230|5|We have enjoyed the Percy Jackson movies a great deal. I have always told my granddaughter that when they make a good movie out of a book, she should find and read it, since there is always more in the book than can be included in a film. She is anxious to start reading about Percy Jackson, and I was delighted to find this set at Amazon.
B003XF1XOQ|4|I was not looking for a fairytale ending, and Collins doesn't supply one. I did think Collins would have continued along the same train she had been riding that while things aren't perfect, people can work together to make them better. The world of the Hunger Games has been a dystopia from the beginning, but this final volume seemed even bleaker. It also seemed a bit more disjointed. It almost seemed as if Collins wasn't sure herself what she wanted to do with these characters she had so lovingly created. The resolution of the love triangle seemed especially neat but incomplete. The action scenes were very good, and I must say that Collins does a good job of maintaining the nature of her very real characters. Not a bad book, but not up to the standard set by the two books that preceded it.
B0071XO8RA|3|Not bad but not the best either.  I was hoping to see something more than just a lot of dead ends.  Like maybe a way off the planet instead of fighting for the last crumb until dead.  Howey is a very good writer but I know he can do better with that kind of talent.
0857680986|5|This is a great primer for figure drawing. A must for anyone wanting to advance their figure drawing skills to another level..or for starting figure drawing.
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great suspenseful read!!
1433502410|5|This is a great study Bible with lots of good reference and study materials.  The main thing I find that separates this from other study Bibles is the wealth of diagrams and maps throughout.  In most areas where a map would be useful to help the reader visualize what the text is talking about, the ESV study Bible comes through and provides one.
B004HXIZVC|1|Ever since soundcloud updated it pissed me off endlessly. I didn't like the new upate now I have deal with a  horrible and s***y sound cloud update. Yes, I like it better than it was before why did even have to update. FIX IT PLEASE!
B001FB4VZS|5|Excellent product, totally recommend it for everyone who needs and wants a product like this. Five stars to it. Thanks
B00F9040HU|5|LOVE THIS GAME, HOURS OF ENTERTAINMENT.
B00CWY76CC|4|Fun to play.  Challenging and interesting trouble shooting for my brain. Not fun to write a review blah blah blah.
1400034205|5|I first saw Bill Murray's 1984 movie version of the book and I believe that it is by far his best movie. There is also a 1946 movie version of the book starring Tyrone Power. The Razor's Edge is a great book and I would suggest reading it before watching the movie. Also l would suggest watching the 1946 movie before the 1984 movie.
B00BR4QNJ0|3|Game is very cute and a little bit funny. Graphics are very nice. Very little fighting help. Should give a bit more use in attacking not just walking.
B009U9S6FI|3|I loved the history and personal bio in section I. The philosophy section leaves something to be desired. I had hoped for more.
B00FHB2XB6|1|I knew from the reviews that it wasn't going to be anything great, but seriously, this should have cost $14.99.  It is SO SMALL and very cheap plastic.  Do NOT waste your money!  So disappointing!
B00HEPDLFK|2|Five stars for shipping and packaging. However the gravitational pull of this movie literally sucked 3 stars right off the top!!!!. We should have waited for it to land on cable...
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|This is a great sandbox, exploration, crafting game with a ton of content and things to do.  I've been playing it for months and still have things I haven't gotten to yet.  Plus the developer adds new content on a relatively regular basis.  People compare it to Minecraft but I've found Terraria to be much deeper especially the mobile version.  Also just more fun.  One note to people who are having trouble creating a new character or world because the keyboard doesn't work.  Try using a different keyboard.  You can change the keyboard on your android device by going to Settings and then Language and Input, and changing the keyboard in the Default setting.  If you don't have a second keyboard on your device you can get one here from the Amazon Appstore or on Google Play.  Here at Amazon you can try \\"Swype Keyboard Free\\" or the \\"Fleksy Keyboard\\" which is free today for their holiday giveaway.  Changing the default keyboard on my phone solved this problem for me.  I hope it works for you too.  Terraria is a great game so I hope that you can play it.
B0002XVQNU|5|I read the book adaptation of the film Daredevil and was disappointed to see that much of the story was cut out of the film by the studio.  I liked the movie, but I liked the WHOLE story much better.  In this version you get to see what brings the Kingpin down and how Matt Murdock uses his senses as a blind superhero and lawyer to free an innocent man. GREAT.
B006LSZECO|5|After seeing how many people did not like the ending. I found it satisfying after a great read that kept the pages turning at s rapid clip . Not the most like able characters , but flawed in a wAy that kept you wanting to know what was going to happen next . Great read and highly recommended .
B0000DD7LB|5|This album proves that Britney Spears has staying power. It is her best to date, and is very well put together. It's kind of refreshing to hear music like this coming from Britney Spears. I have always been a fan, but this cemented her in my book as a true artist, and performer. Work it Britney!!!
B007THA4FI|4|As others have said, it rambled around a bit and some of the characters seemed a bit contrived and sometimes vicious, but she is of course a great writer and it was enjoyable.  I stuck with it and was glad I did.  Interestingly, for someone who wrote the definitive young people's book, she gave the children, even the grown-up daughter, the power to affect their parents' lives.  Particularly in this case, when no one else seemed to call parents out on their poor behavior.  I will read her other books.
B00D6BN9NK|5|this product met my criteria.  they arrived in excellent shape and were exactly as described on Amazon.  I would buy again.
B007GCY8FS|5|Another great Jack Reacher story! Characters and locations are all very real. The suspense causes you to to just keep reading.
B00GINENG0|5|I love both talking Tom and Angela.
B00J6YA1V4|5|So excited to have Lestat back again! I love any book by Anne Rice, but this is a special treat. The book is beautifully written, as usual, and again we are blessed with her abiity to weave history with fiction to make her vampires so real that you want to believe they're real. Thank you Mrs. Rice for another wonderful novel that I will read again and again.
B001CDWFPC|4|It is the best Bible I have, and I seem to have them all.  There's only one way it could be better, and the reason I give it only 4 stars. It would be perfect, in my opinion, if it was red letter and had tabs. I have the large letter edition, which makes it a very large bible.  I leave it open in my study. If a red letter edition with tabs ever comes available I will buy it in a standard size with leather cover to carry in my briefcase.
B008764ZQ4|5|If you remember hearing these songs during the 80's, you will love this soundtrack.  Many great memories, although the songs are obviously re-done for this project.  Great collection!
1401201911|5|what if Superman was born in Russia, and was their champion--this books explores that in a n interesting and fun read
B005ZOBNOI|5|Totally enjoyed this book. The characters are real and brave. What a testimony to the resilience of youth and to once again realize that life is just not fair.
B00006LLNU|5|I listened to this album wandering around Manhattan at 2am on the night of the blackout...  the perfect soundtrack to that eery night.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Treky from way back, love how these new Star Trek films show where the original characters came from
B00881VLCE|4|it's nice to be able to do a puzzle anywhere.  the ones available for purchase have some amazing pictures. But there is a collection of free ones too.
B0001AP12G|5|ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS THANK YOU KANYE WEST! I WAS ABOUT TO STOP LISTENING TO &quot;NEW SCHOOL&quot; RAP AND JUST STICK W/THE 90'S STUFF (THE GOLDEN ERA OF RAP). BUT THIS CD PROVES THAT WE STILL HAVE AT LEAST ONE GOOD RAPPER AROUND! ALTHOUGH THEIR ARE ONE TO MANY SKITS ON THIS CD, SONGS LIKE &quot;ALL FALLS DOWN&quot;, &quot;JESUS WALKS&quot;, &quot;GET EM HIGH&quot;, AND &quot;THROUGH THE WIRE&quot; (TO NAME A FEW) MAKE UP FOR IT COMPLETLY. ONCE AGAIN...THANK YOU KANYE!
B00EEDJM2Q|5|This puzzle game is interesting. It gradually increases in complexity. I could not put it down for hours. Buy it.
B00BB8RKH6|5|Im a Denzel fan.  He played his character really well - spot on!  There is one unnecessary scene where a woman is shown naked many times as she walks around the room.  Dont watch with your inlaws or skip that scene.
0802473156|5|I bought this book during a deployment in preparation for marriage. At the time, I was in a serious relationship with someone I thought was going to turn out to be \\"the one\\". (Come to find out, I was simply in the \\"in love\\" stage)<br /><br />But I digress. This is an AMAZING book. I didn't realize that it was written for couples who were already married, but nevertheless it has been very beneficial. Once you read the book, you'll start to see the similar pattern many of the married couples were going through because they weren't speaking their spouse's \\"love language.\\" They weren't doing the things their spouse MOSTLY considers unmistakable expressions of love.<br /><br />There were at least two couples in this book who said that they had wished they had known this information (or read this book) 20+ years before so that they could've forgone the years of NOT feeling loved by their spouse. If that's not motivation enough for you to feed on this information Dr. Chapman offers, I don't know what to tell ya.<br /><br />I STRONGLY recommend this book to married couples, couples who plan on being married, and even single folks. There is so much eye-opening wisdom in here that you'd be doing yourself a disservice by ignoring it. It can save you years of hurt & misunderstanding. But positively, it can spur you and your loved one to newer heights of satisfaction and happiness in your relationship. Be blessed.
B00JDB4PEY|4|Good music. Songs that had not previously been released by the artist. Most songs are duets with current popular artists.
0553103547|5|Confronted by a new concept in fantasy realm, this is the introductory novel to a world of a coming winter that will last for decades. With seven Royal families fighting over control, there are some great descriptive characters that feature kings and queens who struggle for control of the throne. There is a mysterious wall to the North, guarded by outcasts from whatlies beyond. It is intruiging from the beginning.  Our hero, Lord Stark of Winterfell, seems to be a down-to-earth family Lord, but is forced to leave them behind after his younger son is injured, He comes south to act in the role of chief councilor to the newly appointed King, a good ally of Stark although his family disagree. While he is away, Lord Stark's wife and children soon become the main characters of a plot unfolding and dark deeds galore.<br /><br />This is a great action book set in an extraordinary setting with such detailed description, you feel you are there. Am now plotting on buying the next novel and hope it keeps to the same high standard of adventure and escapism.[[ASIN:0553386794 A Game of Thrones: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book One]]
0316044695|5|this account of modern-day warfare will give you some insight into the caliber of men fighting the wars of this country...they are volunteer warriors who seek little recognition for their daily sacrifices while we sleep warm in our beds at home, depending on them to keep us safe.  you will ask yourself after reading this book...\\"where do we get such brave men\\"?
140120841X|5|I normally don't read fiction but I got to see the last half of the film with Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond and Hugo Weaving as the mysterious V figure who puts on a Guy Fawkes mask and seeks to save England from the New Order.    The book reminds me of George Orwell's novel, 1984, and in fact, John Hurt CBE who played Winston in the 1984 film version surfaces here as one of the country's leaders. How ironic is that or was that the purpose of casting him.    The book is an easy to read and a page-turner as well. You are wondering what is going to happen next and to whom. I do have some issues about V's character as to why we really don't know much about him. The book makes some revelations along the way to help explain his background without it being overdone.     Evey's character brilliantly played by Natalie Portman in the film is one of those borderline characters in the post-reclamation or revolutionary period in British history after the Queen is gone and the World Order takes shape in their own country. She starts off suspicious and aware of some of the lies fed by her government while working at a government television network.    One night, she meets V under terrible circumstances. He rescues her from being raped and maybe killed by the fingermen, government's dangerous law enforcers. V brings her to his home in the underground. They bond more like teacher and student or father and daughter than as lovers. Evey is old enough to be his daughter anyway. V is mysterious and loves the film, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\\" and loves growing Violet Carson OBE roses.     If you don't know who Violet Carson OBE was, she was one of the Britain's best known actresses from television. She played busybody Ena Sharpes for years on Coronation Street. They named a rose after her.    Well, the book is a page-turner and I'm not usually reading fictional works but the movie got me interested by accident. I saw it on a flight to London.
B00APUYWYA|5|Movie is great - great acting, great singing - a total pleasure.  Also,it was funny and makes you feel good.
B00EPL4PBK|5|Bad ass. So different, so awesome, so insane. Love it. 3 new favorite songs on it. Solid drums, syn and Zack deliver as always, and shadows sets the bar a little higher this time.
B00DYCBH4O|5|I really like Jane Austen's books but I prefer this one in particular. Classic romance, I guess women would like it best.
B0091REZMW|4|So far so good. Kinda hard to see things on a smaller screen but not too bad. Fun.
031603438X|5|Great book . At times you felt like you were reading a combination of Angela's Ashes and Fear and Loathing.   It's written as if he is sitting there verbally reading the book to you . A bit stream of thought perhaps. It's interesting prose, though I was lost at times w/ some of the Brit slang.  It's pretty raw, you get the feeling that he held nothing back, and told it as he remembered (or what others remembered - he frequently defers to witnesses to explain a story from their point of view).  At the same time, I got the feeling he held some sort of grudge w/ Mick. I think he spends too much time on Mick and harps on the same topic about how he got a big head in the 80's. I'm sure he did, but he was the lead singer of the greatest band ever, that kept it together for many years, without complaint, while Keith was on smack. I'm sure Mick could write a book and pick out all the pet peeves about Keith as well.   Overall - I really enjoyed it. You keep having to remind yourself how much great music he created. I highly recommend the book - it's an easy read - entertaining, insightful, and I even appreciated the recipes at the end and went out and bought a bottle of HP (must be a UK thing - tastes like steak sauce).
B00OPMI04M|5|Absolutely love this CD! My 72 yr old Mama loves it too  She agrees with me, This girl can sing!
B003XF1XOQ|5|I loved the other two books and couldn't wait to find out who this book ended. It is a book for teens and older.
B00KZ6WRAA|4|Good
B0020BUWX2|4|It is hard to believe that an entire book about a girl in a coma could grab one's attention, no less keep it.....but it does.  The story lines weaved in and out of the background provide the real story of Mia and her struggle to determine if it's a life she wants to go back to.
1451696191|4|I love this book. Loved Charlie. Such a likeable character that I found I had a great connection to. It was a simple read. Teenagers trying to survive the pressures of school, relationships, love, hormones and the concept of entering adulthood. It's moving. Charlie is faced with a lot of challenges that sees his character developing throughout the book. The characterisation is very believable. You have characters from all walks of life. It has moments of happiness and sadness. It's a brilliant read. Really captures the essence of kidulthood. I look forward to reading it again someday.
B007J4T2G8|3|Strangely captivating, though no work of art.  It should be read when ou are relaxing and have nothing more important to do.  It helps kill time.
B009UX2YAC|5|Very addicting and fun to play! You get many prizes and you can travel all over the world in just one ganr! Plus you get different characters and boards! Its awesome!
B00CW6DAKC|4|,rut tillon land and Great combo of two ways to play on the farm and a fishing  hole  for some  . Or fishing and a little farming
B00KWVZ750|3|This is an ok game. A bit slower to play than other angry birds. Haven't had many problems yet. Not sure if it is really another angry birds actually has a totally different feel.
B00AEBB97S|5|It is an excellent movie performed by great actors I enjoy it immensely! I do enjoy the classics with the great actors I would recommend this movie to anyone
B004624N6K|4|I love all her albums... this one is not the best but I like it though. The price was unbeatable.
B0083Z614S|5|This story was my first introduction to literature \\"without pictures\\". Read to me by my Great Aunt at the tender age of 6, this was my first exposure to a \\"real\\" book, and it has been imbedded in my memory ever since. Wonderful to find it here and brought back so many memories. A must read for anyone.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Not only a book for teenagers, a great read for all of us wishing to leave our mark. It was tough to read through the tears at times, but worth each one.
B003XF1XOQ|5|I enjoyed and recommend this and the first two books to everyone. Captured my attention from the beginning all the way to the end.
B0044WUIHA|5|We had a young friend staying with us whom had never seen this movie.  It was the 3rd time for me and I still thoroughly enjoyed viewing it again!!  Hanks should have won the Best Actor Oscar this year instead of Russell Crowe!
B00BD99JMW|2|Terrible, the first two books good. I wanted a good ending. I wanted something that wasn't what the ending was. Plus this whole book was confusing. Good series terrible ending. I had so much more hope for the characters and building up, but the characters never did.
B000002JNJ|5|My 2nd nephew is a long time fan of Pantera & specifically asked for this CD. I think he is really enjoying it. Glad I got it from Amazon, what a good price!
B006RED4GA|1|was told it would be disturbing, it wasn't. Also the acting was ridiculous. big disappointment. but i will watch more movies
B00E8KLWB4|4|Good game but crystals are hard to come by if you don't want to pay for them, also turning the pictures for the new rooms is difficult on the kindle which is frustrating as your on a timer and I tend to waste energy having to repeat the puzzle because the pieces take so long to turn . Overall a great game and totally free :-)
1400032717|3|I've been interested in reading this book for awhile so when I found out that I had to read it for class I was relieved thinking that I would enjoy 'school reading'. At first, I was confused thinking that the author had autism himself. But without having to look it up, I noticed in the writing that the author was writing as if he was autistic.   Although some of Christopher's behaviors are true to the description of autism, such as everything needing to have an order and being very specific in what people say. However, if you pay close attention you can find contradictions within pages of each other. I've read that Haddon has had experience working with people with autism, but that does not mean that he knows how an autistic mind works 100% of the time.  Regardless, I did enjoy the book and thought it was funny and portrayed a person with autism relatively well. I just would have enjoyed it better if it was actually written by a person with autism.
B004SIIBGU|5|it is really simple and once login it stays in and there is no problems logging in it organices by your car and better it help you find what you need
0345525558|5|I read this book initially because of the pre-release buzz this book had created, and it does not disappoint.  This is an AMAZING book, one that draws you so deeply inside you want to finish it, yet you never want to finish it.  The main character is richly layered, the supporting cast is memorable and layered, too, and the writer creates a world with texture, feeling and the just the right amount of mystery.  What I want to know now is, what's next?  I'm most definitely a Vanessa Diffenbaugh fan!
B0083ZBW2Y|5|London is excellent always. Not for the faint of heart animal lover. Fascinating perspective through the dog though.
B00NEJ7MMI|5|Inventive arrangements! Hard to believe that this is accapella! Great singers and especially loved the newer songs on the album!
B0051OZ564|3|I actually don't normally write movie reviews. I felt like I had to with this film...<br /><br />It was so very interesting and had us riveted to our seats during the entire film. But... It was too dark for my tastes. I was expecting something a little different. I had lots of moments during the film where PTSD (from abuse) slipped in and made it such that I did not want to finish watching the film.<br /><br />Personal junk aside:<br />The film was expertly shot, the angles and transitions were superb, and the camera motion never distracted me from the \\"living in the movie\\" experience I always get with films like these. I like plot twists, and this one delivered a few nice ones.<br /><br />This was sort of like a modern Twilight Zone episode with excellent FX, killer song covers, and convincing actors.
B00EMJBVAI|2|I feel dumber having watched this movie.  From the way the virus operated snapping my suspenders of disbelief, to the nonsensical set piece driven plot, to the vast stupidity of the characters, to the poor action sequences, the utter lack of character development, this is a zombie movie that did not deliver on suspense, action, or drama.  The cinematography was decent though as was the zombie make-up.  Those are the only elements that saved it from a 1-star
B0063IH60K|5|I spend hours playing. I really enjoy this app. My personal opinion on the best part of this game is the fact you can deal a winning hand.
B002NXSRVG|2|How novel, a movie about a toy.  Why does that premise sound so silly?<br /><br />Talk about overkill!  Yeah it sparkled, all glitzy with gizmos and explosions and nasty nano-green goo and explosions and fire and....did I mention explosions?  I suppose they thought that if they kept things moving at a heady clip no one would notice there wasn't any substance beneath the KABOOM!  That all the actors were subordinate to the action and the, well, toy weapons and whatnot.  They really didn't need actors, they could have gotten by with robots (there was that one guy you couldn't see beneath his suit, didn't say a word, which was a blessing considering the dialog involved, was he a robot?  Couldn't tell.).  And then there was Sergeant Stone, aptly named, that I thought was...then told myself it couldn't be, was that Brendan Fraser?  Blinked and he was gone.  Why was he there, I forget.  This is one movie you could never spoil in the telling because who can remember what just happened?<br />My synopsis of the movie: there were a lot of explosions.<br />Even riddled with the occasional flashback (which served only to confuse matters), there wasn't much in the way of humanity involved here.  Tough talking, macho posturing (especially by THE Baroness, Sienna Miller), withering putdowns (the obligatory slur, \\"ladies!\\"), toy names (who would name their kid Heavy Duty or Snake Eyes!?), and deliriously impossible combat sequences that everyone seems to survive with barely a scratch (who thinks Storm Shadow won't be back?).<br />By the time The Rise of Cobra had set up its sequel my brain was having spasms, begging them to stop the torture: I'LL TALK!  I'LL TELL YOU ANYTHING YOU WANT....No, it wasn't a keeper, and no, I won't be watching the sequel or the one that follows it.  I'd sooner stare at a sparkler for 2 hours.
B00992CF6W|5|This game is really cool. You can make chickens catch on fire. You can challenge mobs of creeper with diamond swords and it is just all around epic.
B00FAPF5U0|5|This game is amazing. Every level has a different way yo pass it. You just need to figure it out! It is so very addicting!
B0063IH60K|4|Good
B00GH75V1S|4|Good Post Apocalyptic film....not the best, but good.
B007FEFLTO|4|this book is captivating and informative for those who like historical novels.  does a good job of developing characters and placing them in key historical settings
B001PPLJIQ|2|I watched the movie on tv and I am glad I didn't buy it. My main point of criticism is that all the props (e.g. books) are English books. It bugged me to see that he reads an English book to her and she learned writing with an English book (they even mention in the movie that he only learns Latin and Greek at school). They suppose to be Germans - than use German books. Otherwise the movie is alright.
B005PK57IK|5|I like the characters and the storylines are varied and interesting.  A bit to much of the office intrigue but still love the show.
B001SGEUNI|5|Most of us rockers can't wait for something new to come along. This cd is a slick recording, well played/sung with a variety of tempos not everyone can appreciate but will after a couple listens (and you will listen to it again...and again...  One can only appreciate the talent Lizzy Hale possesses by seeing her and her musicians live. Saw them in Burlington VT last night and it was one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. They are professionals and it shows. I'm sure they may outgrow the smaller venues but that's the best place to see them. Up close and personal.
0684853523|5|I just like to say that this is one of best autobigrphies I have ever read. Stephen King's most of the books are international bestsellers. This is the first non-fiction I read by Stevie. I think this is also one of his master pieces. I personally recomended this book to anyone who like to read autobigraphies.
B00005OAIE|4|I have to admit that at first I didnt want to listen to John Mayer because all I could see was a Dave Matthews [knock]-off.  But when a friend of mine gave me a copy of this album and I listened as a courtesy.. and I found myself liking it more and more and got to where it was all I would listen to.  To compare John Mayer to Dave Matthews is an unfair.  The only serious comparison to make is that they both play guitar and both write songs about women.  John has his own style and he is worth listening to.
B005K0HDGE|5|This book was amazing!! Steven King is a generous...not only was this book enlightening, but it was also informative!! I would recommend anyone of any age to read it!! I loved it and couldn't wait to turn the page!
B00DVKOYBM|3|Enjoying, playing a lot, but all the ways it doesn't react like the real thing is very frustrating.
B001XJEKGC|5|Awesome. i liked the old Traffic & Hendrix stuff too
B00DR0PDNE|5|If you are looking for that something extra get this love this and absolutely recommend it to anyone that is looking for a stocking stuffier.
B0063IH60K|5|I use this for stress.  Its my im over everyone n everything leave me alone but im to restless to read stress distraction.  It is exactly what it says it is and that makes it great.

B000FCKC4C|5|The Alchemist is the story of Santiago, a young shepherd, who finds the courage to follow his heart in the pursuit of his Personal Legend. I found the writing to be beautiful in its simplicity. The reader is drawn into the journey on which Santiago embarks. We are shown, through his journey, all the miracles that await each and every one of us who have the courage and faith to follow our passion. The message is profound and important - I believe this book should be required reading for anyone with a soul. I would like to thank Paulo Coelho for being the conduit through which the Universe could impart such wisdom.
0061122416|5|Simple, profound and elegant fable.
B00005JKGI|5|As a canadian That has lived in London England for a few years. I can say that this movie is one of the best to come off that island. Hey even sing the great escape song at football matches.<br />Michael Caine at his best ( And if your not a Michael Caine fan you will be after watching this movie). Also, the great car chase with three mini's and a very large bus.<br />If you are a fan of English Culture or you just want to watch a great movie buy it!
B00I6JOBTI|5|This is hands down the most incredibly AWESOME Lego Movie ever made.  For one it is more alike any LEGO toy than any of the other Lego movies.  This is great for children 5+ as the action themes are a little too much for children under 5.  What makes this a great movie is that children and adults alike can appreciate and enjoy the movie and both will see and view it completely differently.  I can't wait to check it out in 3D!
0385737955|5|The Maze Runner by James Dashner is a great book that starts off with a boy named Thomas waking up to a group of strange boys, and only boys, with no memory at all. Thomas soon finds out that is stuck inside an unsolvable maze that changes every night. Then, for the first time, a girl arrives and triggers “the Ending.” Thomas, along with the other boys, must figure out a way out of there as soon as they can, before they all die. This book has a dystopian feel to it, like Divergent and The Hunger Games. Although many would say the plot is similar, it has its unique elements. The reader knows just as much as Thomas and the other characters do. With every new piece of information the characters get, you find yourselves trying to figure out the maze along with Thomas and the other boys. This keeps the reader intrigued and wanting to read more. The plot and ideas for the book are great. I felt like some characters could have been more developed, but overall the book is great. If you’re the type of person that likes dystopian, young adult novels then The Maze Runner is the book for you.
B00MNUB9IC|1|bought this on sale from Amazon,  description states it supports exchange,  but doesn't say it requires an ADDITIONAL PURCHASE.
B00AL1OV0I|5|I Liked The Word Play And The features. the Types and Styles Of the Songs Are Very Diverse. I Would Say It Is A Very Strong Album, Considering What Others Are Coming Out With Today.
0062114042|4|Paul Stanley of KISS tells a very interesting tale about life. Not only about his life, but also of the people and circumstances that have touched his life so far. A very personal view of what went right and what went wrong.<br /><br />Rating: 80%<br /><br />Review in a bit more detail:<br /><br />I read this book in a day, after not reading anything else for about six months. It is very well written and I found this hard to put down. Like many people, I was a KISS fan from the moment I first heard them, they were huge in Australia in the late 70’s. Granted, I was far too young back then to understand the lyrics, but the hard rock sound appealed to me.<br /><br />Stanley Bert Eisen, or Paul Stanley as we know him, paints a picture of himself as a neglected child. Born with a birth defect that affected his appearance and hearing; yet he was by far the healthier of the two Eisen children. One criticism I thought of when reading the first parts of the book was about perspective. Paul writes about how dysfunctional his family was; presenting his view of why he withdrew into himself becoming painfully shy and insecure. It’s certainly a key part of his development into the rock star that he becomes; but I felt that he was very harsh in his criticism of his parents. I thought he could have applied the ‘hindsight’ rule as to why they may have been that way, which he does discuss briefly toward the end. However, it does sound like he’s wanted to get this off his chest for some time, so who can blame him?<br /><br />There are a lot of stories about the life of a rock god, and some quite amusing and fondly-told stories about the good times and great memories that were shared by the members of the band.<br /><br />Paul was very harsh in his criticism about many of his bandmates and associates, both current and former. Again, it appears to be in response to the stories that were in the ‘other’ KISS memoirs. The honesty is refreshing, but a little overdone perhaps?From what’s written in the book, none of the people or circumstances discussed should come as a surprise to the people who have been singled out.<br /><br />He himself is not beyond his own criticism, admitting to poorly handling many circumstances that life throws his way. It’s nice to know that the rock gods can be all-too-human. Paul details a lifelong struggle to marry the insecure, physically disabled lonely person with the larger than life rock front man persona behind the mask. Or behind the makeup, as it were. I was reminded of reading about Freddie Mercury, who seemed to share the two distinct personalities; embracing thousands of people in a stadium every night, but keeping real intimacy at arms-length through much of his life. Both of them not though choice, but due to overwhelming insecurities off-stage.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book, both as a fan and a reader.<br /><br />Pete Diggins<br />4 April 2015
B00J2VSS0C|1|Things to find are smaller now I don't play it any more
1878424750|5|The world would be a better place.  Not all have ears to hear and may be put off.  We can find fault in his words.  No fault in his intention, your feelings, and the spirit given.  This copy is to listen to at work or in car.  Have book copy also.  Have pass on to family
006097625X|5|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but I took a chance and bought it. This book goes beyond the average reader's understanding of comics, but presents as both clear and interesting. <br /> <br />Frankly, \\"Understanding Comics\\" doesn't read like a textbook, but more like a graphic novel. By the end of the 2nd chapter, you'll be oblivious to the fact that you're actually learning something.
B00000099Y|2|very disappointed. Undertow is still my favorite. This album is overplayed too much, because it is their first album in years.
B0002KPIQY|5|great movie
B006GWO5NE|5|received this item in a timely manner and it works great. thanks.
B00F91SCXC|4|Better movie than I expected

B0054JZC6E|5|i love this game i cant get my mind off of this i play it every single day i even take to school and play this game
B0006OBPTA|5|if you love classic films in this box will have all versions of karate kid what surprised me is the last part with the girl in personal is advisable to have to remember the complete collection of a franchise that a time frame<br /><br />si eres amante de las peliculas clasicas en esta caja tendras todas las versiones de karate kid  lo que me sorprendio es la ultima parte con la chica  en lo personal es recomendable para tener para el recuerdo la coleccion completa de una saga  que marco una epoca
B008Y2FRFO|5|This is a very interesting game will get addicted to it. And it is a very good smart buy to relax with.
1451683405|5|Very well written and easy to understand.  Sam Harris presents the problem of free will and demonstrates why we don't have free will with very sound arguments that aren't easy to refute. For anyone interested in the question of free will, this book is a must.
159463176X|5|I love Hosseini's work, yet much of it is very hard to read because of the subject matter being extreme and graphic.  This novel, while it contains elements of raw emotion and some harsh content, has a milder general tone.  Don't start reading it if you have other things to do because you will not want to pause in e story.
B006Z1GLHO|5|Love this show!
B000NY12CI|5|Excellent, a must read!
B003XF1XOQ|5|I really enjoyed this last one. It was amazing, definitely worth the time and money. I would absolutely recommend it.
B000002H33|5|Not only is the Metallica's best album ever, it is also one of the best albums ever - period.<br /><br />FYI, this review is for the &#34;old school&#34; CD, not the newer vinyl release. I still have my original pressing from back in the day and it is far superior to the CD.
0061122416|5|My ex boyfriend kept going on and on about this book until I eventually got a copy. Best book I've read in my life! It's such a simple and short read but so much weight in it's message. My best friend purchased a copy after I had her read it, then she purchased it for two other people. I loaned my copy to my Manager and he too is ordering a copy. MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION
B000005JAK|5|CAG is one of those albums that I return to at specific moments... when you are feeling so far down that it offers catharsis and you can't help but feel better. First heard it during a confusing time in my life and was  floored that Mould and Hart &quot;knew&quot; that feeling too.
B005CRQ4GU|5|Hope they come out with another one and I will read the next one too . Peace out  !!!!!good bye.
B008JGSM6G|5|Great mind puzzle.  This is very challenging and cant put it down.  Love the colors and the different sizes of the grids. Great choice and well worth it.  Was a free puzzle.
B00IUBXPEY|2|The acting was good the story not too bad but was a little thin. The ending, while I understand they needed to leave it open for a sequel, was just bad and no closure what so ever.
B00SWWPVSY|5|Wow. Fantastic game.
0312360258|4|I picked \\"Marked\\" up from my daughter's bedroom floor after she left for college.  I was heading off to camp and figured...why not?  I have been absolutely hooked on these books.  I have read one right after the other (in less than three weeks) and can't wait for \\"Destined\\" to be released.  I will admit I had a hard time at points because the writer kept explaining past events over and over, but I realize some didn't have the benefit of reading all the books in a row as I did.  I really enjoyed Zoey's character and the story line kept me hooked!  If you enjoy fantasy type stories - there is no way you won't enjoy these books.
B007SVPZMW|2|If you can't move it to your SD card, then it is just taking up valuable space on the device. 26M for  simple game. I uninstalled. I'll give it a higher rating once you're able to move it to the SD card.
B007XKEY6Q|3|Its free and it does exactly what it says it will do.  What more could you want in an app?
B00UC5K74C|5|Really fast shipping!!
B00650SSWG|3|Cute, funny, and okay for the rental price. I wouldn't rate it as strongly as many of the other reviews, but it's definitely better than so many cheesy romantic comedies.
B0050DZN4K|5|If you want to follow several (or many) different blogs, feedly is the way to do it. It is easy to use, and automatically shows you the latest posts from all your favorite websites.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is just plain awesome I love it try it for your self
B004VMUS9G|5|Great application
B008P1EWIM|4|Only one thing would make it better and that would be to have a radar option.  It would be great to check the tracking of bad weather to help make decisions.
B00004R7TP|5|&quot;This remastered classic CD: &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; from England's favorite sweetheart Kate Bush, goes all out to give you your moneys worth.  The six additional bonus tracks-(there are 18 songs in all),  and beautiful new pics of Kate are well worth your purchase. If you already have the original version, sell it now and get the remaster!      I really enjoy listening to the 12 inch version of &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot;...the production quality is better than the original, and Kate had added some new twists to the song. I wasnt as impressed with the remix version of &quot;The Big Sky&quot; however its still an interesting addition to this masterpiece.  &quot;Under The Ivy&quot; and &quot;Burning Bridge&quot; are fabulous!!  It's as if they shouldve been on the album in the first place. &quot;My Lagan Love&quot; adds a unique touch at the end of the bonus tracks as Kate sings accapella in a traditonal Irish folk style.If you are searching for any reasons why you shouldnt buy this remaster of Kates classic album, give it up right now!  Cause you'll never find any that are worth holding back your purchase.If you are already a Kate Bush fan and you dont have the remaster of &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot; then you really have no excuse not to get it. And if you arent a Kate Bush fan yet, this remastered CD is the perfect purchase to begin your collection!
B006JPS1OM|5|interesting game... it has different locations you can go to and use different items in.  It keeps your interest going.
B006LSZECO|4|Exciting and insightful in parts. I liked where it finally went. I was interested because I heard about the film adaptation coming up. I'm curious to see how they pull that off.
B000003AEB|5|I bought this CD in 1993 when the original version came out.  It had 19 tracks, not 18 or 13.  The real track 18 is \\"Gz Up, Hoes Down\\" and Track 19 is \\"Pump, Pump.\\"  I didn't even realize that later releases had tracks removed until I started looking for the album art for my iPod.   <br /> <br />This album is a classic.  if you want to buy it try to get the original with NINETEEN TRACKS.  Don't allow yourself to miss Snoop in his full artistic form.  This is definitely one of the Top Ten CD of All Time.
B003UPPO2G|5|When the Bee Gees got on stage together, the results were magic.  Their perfect harmony, their hits that spanned the decades, and their obvious love for each other made them a one-of-a-kind group.  Of course, they perform their classic dance music from the \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" years.  But, the Bee Gees also sing their songs from the '60's such as \\"Massachusetts,\\" \\"To Love Somebody,\\" and \\"Words.\\"  Some of the finest moments of the concert are when the band takes a break while the brothers gather around one microphone and sing unplugged versions of several songs.  They also sing songs that (when this concert was done in 1997) were new...showing that their songwriting talents had not diminished at all.  Speaking of the Bee Gees' songwriting, it is great to hear them perform songs which they wrote but became hits for other people, such as \\"Islands in the Stream,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and \\"Grease.\\"<br />The Bee Gees said that \\"How Deep is Your Love\\" was a particular favorite of theirs, and as they perform that song, they show video of the brothers with their wives and children in the background.  That is touching.  The other touching moment is their tribute to youngest brother Andy, who died when he was only 30.<br />The interview included on the DVD is very interesting.<br />Of course, this concert is especially poignant now, knowing that only one Gibb brother remains.  Six years after this concert, Maurice would pass away suddenly at only 53, and nine years after that, his twin Robin would be gone at the age of 62.  How very sad for oldest brother Barry and the rest of the Gibb family.  But the music of the Bee Gees will live on.
B00005JNS0|5|Kids love cars and cars movie, what else can I say. My son was very excited to start watching once it arrived.
B007XAYKX8|4|Firstly, I'm a MotoGP junkie, so I'm apt to like anything on that topic.<br /><br />But, I especially liked the approach of this movie.<br /><br />It's all about the changing of the guard and the efforts of those who were fastest to stay that way and of those who want to become fastest.<br /><br />I always like when riders are presented as true &#34;thinking&#34; people and in the interviews this movie does that well.  I especially liked the interviews with the Yamaha engineer and Rossi in which they describe the difficulty of modeling the behavior of a racing motorcycle and its rider.<br /><br />I thought there was a little too much coverage of racing injuries, but I suppose that in the context of trying to be &#34;fastest&#34; it's not inappropriate.
B003G4W49C|5|This is one of the best stories I've ever experienced. It grabs your heart and mind, throws them in a blender, and pours out an emotional mind twisted smoothie.
B004FGMDOQ|3|From the write up on Amazon, it sounded like a good book.  While I got into the characters and all, they story was just too phone
B001KVZ6F2|1|What a disappointment! Too many bad words to dodge, if you mute out the potty-mouth, you don't get to hear the movie at all. Soooooo not worth the time to get to the impotent finish. No satisfaction of watching the bad guys get emasculated and see regret fade into pallid death... I rented it for a $1 and it wasn't worth the money! It's Hollywood; it should end the way I want it to. However unrealistic, \\"Dirty Harry\\" made us feel good. I hope this isn't indicative of Eastwood's final years on the screen... fade to black.
B00AMBLXP8|4|Flash Gordon is great in this movie and its definetly a guy movie. Beer and pizza helped make this funny.
B000066NW0|1|Creativity abounds on this album.  Avril Lavigne is the perfect representative for the angst-ridden punk girl, and she sings and writes songs like she knows it.  While sporting a white wife-beater and tie, it's like she's speaking directly to the youth of today.  As she bellows out powerful lyrics like &quot;Why should I care?&quot;, and sings about issues that affect all of us, especially in such a confusing time, one can literally feel her as a guide to our nation, a true light in the darkness that engulfs our world of poseurs and hypocrites. Way to go, Avril!
B004VD3YIM|5|Love this app. Use it on different Nexus tablets plus a moto X...it also works great with my moto 360!
B000W9DSVW|5|The only thing missing from this is the original Ocean's Eleven with Sinatra and Martin.  It would have been a nice bonus feature or easter egg.
B009KWU6Q2|5|Great family movie. It was nice sharing a good old family movie with my young children. One two three foe
B004BEMC6G|5|This was a great movie - I'm waiting to hear if there will be a Salt two (2) - at least it gave you that impression.
B0029LCJJS|4|Although the writers don't bother themselves with historic accuracy, the show is actually pretty good. If it were more accurate, I'd give it five stars.
B007THA4FI|2|I'm probably one of those people who was judging this book on the Harry Potter series, but I just couldn't get into it at all.
B0052GACNM|5|This is a great album. All the duets are good, the best being Aretha and Tony. The most soulful rendition of How Do You Keep The Music Playing that I have heard. Aretha adds a little bit of her African American roots to the song.
B00CITOS4A|5|I'm a Kelby-holic. I enjoy his writing style. That said - really Scott - couldn't you just have called this &#34;Part 5&#34; and expanded on Part 1 to fill it up more? Nevertheless - I'll eventually pick it up in paperback along with my Kindle edition because I just love this series.
B00HPYMVD8|5|Very good easy read. Perfect for a holiday in the sun . Cant wait for the next book in the series.
B00CS65JS2|2|Although highly anticipated, with the exception of a couple of tracks, this album is pretty forgettable. The highlight is obviously 'Get Lucky'. The majority of the remainder could be used as sleep therapy.
6301790170|5|I love it that you can find this film on VHS online.  God bless the internet.  I saw parts of this on TV years ago and the scene where they discover the nitro has been etched on my mind ever since.  They do a great job of showing the desperation the men had to be in to take on such a job and overcome the obstacles.
B005K17RU0|5|I liked it before the update and now love it even more with lots of cool extras all in one swipe.  Great news videos and articles of current events. Love the outdoor sports grading, pollen watch, barometric pressure readings, etc.
0345522303|5|I really recomend this product. It came on time (earlier i have to say), new and in perfect condition. I only have one problem with amazon, and it was it don't update the traking information so it don't let me make a review from my orders page, but they help me to reach here anyway.<br />Angain, highly recommended.
B00SH04286|2|Had to see this one based on recommendations from family members. I did not care for it.
B002E0JL4A|4|Robin Williams is wonderful again.  My doctor actually recommended this film.  It is based on a true story and there are some scenes that are difficult to watch especially now after Robin's tragic death.  It's worth revisiting if you haven't seen it in awhile and you'll see the full range of Robin's talents as an actor as well as a comedian.
B0009PVZWI|3|Tired of reading reviews that just whine about copy-protection and instead want to hear someone talk about the actual music on the CD? Well, here you are.<br /><br />I was surprised to hear that a lot of people didn't like Foo Fighters' last album, One By One; even Dave Grohl said it wasn't that great. I thought it was pretty good; I gave it four stars (I mean, it was no Colour & the Shape, but...). Anyway, in light of the band's ten-year anniversary, they brought us a new album in the form of a double-disc, In Your Honor.<br /><br />Disc 1 contains lots of hard-hitting stuff, like the title track and \\"Best of You\\". And I think their latest single \\"DOA\\" is one of the best songs they ever made. The only songs I can really do without on this disc are \\"Hell\\" and \\"The Last Song\\". And \\"End Over End\\" cuts off rather than goes off.<br /><br />Disc 2 is what a lot of people seem to have a problem with, in that they're all acoustic songs. I really have no problem with that per se, but the thing is that the songs are a little hard to distinguish from one another, despite standouts like \\"What If I Do\\" and \\"Cold Day In the Sun\\" (and \\"Virginia Moon\\" kind of sounds like a show tune). Plus, we all know that the guys have done acoustic songs before, but I'm not sure true Foo fans will want to hear 43 straight minutes of them.<br /><br />Even though this is the first Foo Fighters album I have given less than four stars to, it's not bad by any means. It's still very representative of the band's talent, so it's definitely worth picking up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B007M45PMU|3|My favorites are Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, Jason Mraz.  Love F.U.N.  This one didn't do much for me, only listen to a couple songs.

B00007LTIA|5|First of all, and it's not incredibly important but here it is anyway, &quot;Tales of Topographic Oceans&quot; boasts the single greatest cover in the history of albums, period, end of story. You can stare at it for hours and find new bedevilments, and you don't even have to be high. An album cover, when it's not just a perfunctory photo of the band staring moodily into the camera, can be a powerful aphrodesiac and a clue, giving you a taste of what you're in for if you buy the album...and that is exactly what Roger Dean's absolutely magnificent cover painting does. You know what you're looking at...and yet you DON'T know what you're looking at, and that's exactly the sensation you feel listening to &quot;Tales&quot;.<BR>Okay: check this out. Trek back to the 1970's, when there were no such things as CDs, just vinyl albums with two sides, about 20 minutes each side. Throw on 5 or, if you're daring, 6 songs on each side, each track about 3 minutes long, and you're done. Blah blah blah. Then...along come bands like Yes and Genesis and King Crimson, encouraged by the likes of Dylan and the Beatles, and they say, &quot;To HELL with the accepted norm...and not just song length, not just song subject matter, not just instruments...but to hell with EVERYTHING you ever told us we could do. Why can't rock music fit onto a jazz platform? Why not a classical music platform? Why not try something different? Why not try EVERYTHING???&quot; So try they did, and those who must name every new thing called it Progressive Rock, and it was good. Then came the ultimate Prog Rock album, Yes's &quot;Tales of Topographic Oceans&quot;, a double album with just FOUR songs, each 20 minutes long, each filling one album side, the single ballsiest move in rock and roll since &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot;...and it all came tumbling down. Prog Rock became as hated as disco would soon become, reviled for being snooty, snobbish, self-involved and navel-gazing, a waste of time, a big masturbatory frenzyof Brit whimps with too much time on their hands. And YOU know, it's always true, that those who look ahead and see past the inevitable political log-jamming make the best music, because that's what they're about, my friend, THE MUSIC; not the politics of the music. It's that simple. Each of these four epic songs rises and crests and washes through you and creates a multiplicity of emotions, and I can't tell you what you'll feel when you listen but you MUST LISTEN, because there are still frontiers to be found and conquered, and no one, no one at all since these guys, has had the piercing imagination and bloody-rare courage to venture into the territory of unknown the way they did. Listen and understand: music can be anything, can go anywhere, if you only have the will to follow your own crazy lead.
B007IXWL2C|4|I like the characters and enjoyed all three books! I can't wait to see the movie. I think it's a beautiful erotic romance and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys them!
B00AQ71FLK|1|Removed as I didn't like it
B0036S4B6M|4|I thought the book was very informative and eye opening.  I never realized what kind of bonds could be formed in prison - very necessary bonds.  I appreciated all of the innovations and realize how much we can really do without. thanks to patient and understanding people like Piper, it was nice to know that there can always be many changes for the better and hopefully things that will make all of us stop and appreciate what we have.
B007IXWKUK|3|This book had more of a story than the first but the writing was very amateurish.  The story did begin to evolve, but too much repetition.
B00KMX5V8G|5|Fun game. Gets more challenging  with each new level.
B00174TKGI|4|A true story that stayed true. I loved the acting and directing with this movie. It's a movie to watch again and again.
B0054JZC6E|5|it is cool. fun and awesome. fun fun fun fun vb vb fhh th vb ch cg cg cg cc
B00129H7VS|5|This is an absolutely fabulous movie.  You would swear that you were sitting in the middle of the action and that bullets and bombs were exploring around you.  Just great for anyone interested in WWII.
B001DEXDNI|5|One of my favorite CD's of all time. I listen to it all the time.
B00S17FT82|3|I only liked three tracks on the CD.  So sample it first and see if you like it.
B0096BIENY|5|Very nice CDs..Thanks
030758836X|5|I wish she had written a different ending but both I and my husband loved this book.  Her writing style is very compelling.  Our sympathies would switch with each chapter.  The female character is not the usual goody, goody and the male character has his own flaws.  I stayed up all night to finish it.  Totally believable.  As an academic, I believed her parents would have behaved as they were described and also the male lead.  Fascinating--not the typical procedural or thriller.  Very psychological.
B001PPLKI0|5|This is a great collection of old time gospel favorites.  No one can sing like Elvis!  You will enjoy this collection.
B00005QFE5|5|...Without question, at the heart of the film is a monumental yet simple story of true love in the purest sense, and of the devotion which renders that love eternal.  But the film transcends even that, and within the greater context indicates the impact of the past upon the present, which is summed up in a single line from the film:  \\"Know the past, know the present.\\"  And know, too, that the love portrayed in this story is the kind of love that is abiding, and that which sustains all that makes life worth living.  It's a veritable journey of the soul; one that will touch you deeply and linger in your memory long after the screen has gone dark.<br />Upon receiving the news that his father has died, Luo Yusheng (Honglei Sun) leaves the city to return to his home, a small village in the mountains, to bury his father and comfort his bereaved mother, Zhao Di (Yulian Zhao).  When he arrives, however, he discovers that his mother will not be consoled until her wish concerning the burial of her husband, Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) is fulfilled.  In keeping with a long standing tradition and superstition, Di insists that his coffin be carried by hand by the men of the village along the road connecting the village and the city, insuring by so doing that in death Changyu will always be able to remember his way home.<br />Yusheng quickly finds that realizing his mother's request will be no easy task; their village is small and all of the able-bodied men have left for the city, leaving only children and those too old for such an arduous undertaking.  And it is winter, a harsh time of year in the mountains.  But Di is adamant, and so Yusheng sets about the business of fulfilling her request.  And as he does so, he reflects upon the story of his parents; a story well known throughout the village, for theirs was a love that was unbridled and boundless, the likes of which no one in the village had ever know before.  Or since.<br />This film, so wonderfully crafted and delivered by director Zhang, is altogether ethereal and transporting; he tells the story in simplistic terms, and yet it is in that very simplicity that he finds the genuine honesty and truth that provides such an emotional impact and makes this love story one that rivals any the screen has ever known.  Aided by the masterful cinematography of Yong Hou, Zhang achieves that same sense of transcendence that defines much of Akira Kurosawa's films, such as \\"Ran\\" and \\"Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,\\" or Ang Lee's \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\"  There is not a superfluous moment in the entire film, and Zhang proves that capturing pure emotion with the camera can express more than pages of dialogue recited by an actor.  And with his lens, Zhang opens up the very heart of the film and lays it bare for all to see and feel, finding more in the eyes of his characters and in their expressions than words could ever convey.  It's a study of human nature that is disarming in it's candor, and quite simply a brilliant piece of filmmaking by a director with an irrefutably incisive understanding of the human condition.<br />Without question, though, the single aspect that makes this such an unforgettable film is the performance (in her motion picture debut) by Ziyi Zhang as the young Zhao Di.  A young woman of exquisite beauty, she has a sublime screen presence that is a portrait of the angelic, and her innate ability to silently express the myriad emotions called for by her character is used to great effect by director Zhang.  Ziyi's portrayal is one of youthful innocence mixed with stubborn determination, which gives her character the necessary depth to be entirely convincing, and she will win you over in a heartbeat.  She is so affecting that near the end, when Di, now an old woman, is hurrying across a rickety foot bridge, the same bridge we've seen the young Di traverse many times on her way to and from the schoolhouse (which is central to the story), despite the weathered age so evident on her face,because of the lasting impression made by Ziyi, you realize that she still bears the heart of the young woman you've come to care so much about by this time, and you understand that age is superficial; that this is a shell housing the spirit and the true beauty that resides within.  It's a beautiful moment to behold, and ours forever, due to the extraordinary performance and presence of the delicate Ziyi Zhang, as well as the tremendous sensitivity and care with which she is presented by director Zhang.<br />The supporting cast includes Bin Li (Grandmother), Guifa Chang (Old Mayor), Wencheng Sung (Mayor) and Zhongxi Zhang (Crockery Repairman).  A love story told sincerely from the heart is a treasure that endures forever, like a painting by Monet or Renoir; and like those artists, director Zhang is nothing less than an impressionist behind the camera, capturing the distinctive rhythms of life and love for all time in \\"The Road Home,\\" a gentle, poetic film that will make it's way into the hearts of all who experience it.  And therein remain, forevermore.

B008IZ6OAE|5|The last episode ended with four horses walking down the street carrying four bloody manikins except that they are also made up with real body parts of the kidnapped victim of the Doomsday Killer. They represent the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse from the Book of Revelations in the Bible.  Dexter, while examining the body parts, finds a clue and realizes that they might have missed one on the first victim, the fruit vendor.<br /><br />The new detective from Chicago is figuring out hidden messages in the Doomsday murders and he shows his intelligence.  He can still be a pain as he is not much of a team player but he is making valuable contributions to the case.  Debra is still struggling with the job and has to have her first press conference and she is very nervous.  She tries to do it naturally and calmly and, well she is just Debra!<br /><br />Dexter has a medical scare in his family and Sam the preacher and Dexter are becoming good friends. Dexter is holding back some evidence in the Doomsday Killer case and they even think that they have a possible name.  The episode ends with a gruesome murder that occurs right in front of the police and there are multiple biblical scenarios in the murder and crime scene.<br /><br />The tension keeps building in every episode and it is because of the new serial killers and all of the tension in the homicide department and their personal lives.  This is a great season and it just keeps getting better.
B0088EDMMS|5|Okay, I know Disney likes to distance themselves from this film because of questionable language and other unimportant things. This blu-ray better come with more than a working Title Menu...meaning special features! (behind the scenes, commentary from at least one of the cast members), deleted scenes, outtakes, and whatever you have. You are Disney, you can make anything possible. No excuses. Thank you. BTW: It's a classic.
B003J27WFW|5|If you are like me you've been inspired by the music of these geniuses for decades, but never really got that intimate look behind the scenes to see what makes these guys tick, you must have this.  This film does a great job of taking you through some great chronological moments in the band's career and each member's life.  It is great to see interviews with the parents of the men and a hilarious bit of footage with a teenage Alex Lifeson arguing with his parents on the merits of staying in high school vs. going out to play in a rock band.  The stepping through each of the albums was a good method for the movie and to hear these guys talk about how difficult their music is to really play (we who have tried know this), but they freely admit it themselves and admit to challenging their musical/instrumental abilities (and Ged's voice) to newer and greater heights was very enlightening.  Now I have to go see them at least three times on this current tour!
B000JZ3TYA|4|Pretty good thriller with good performances by all the main actors. Michael Douglas, Sean Penn and Deborah kara unger play their roles with enough conviction to make you ignore some plot homes.
B00EEDJHXA|5|love this game it is fun to play and challenging enough to not be boring. relaxing and playing Buttons and Scissors pro is a great way to get your mental workout
B000002LQR|5|If you dont own this album something is really wrong with you!!!!! you dont deserve to listin to music if you dont have this album!!!!  <br />you are a liar if you say you like music and you dont have this album!!!!
B004LWZW42|5|interesting idea for a backstory to the friendship[ between Professor X and magneto when they were young.<br />the uniforms in this one I think are cooler than the uniforms in the 2000 X-Men movie.<br />the villains are just as equally awesome as the heroes.<br />Banshee and Havok are my two favorite characters on the X-Men's side.<br />Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw for the villain is just an all around badass! =D,<br />First class cast, first class characters, first class everything.<br />I absolutely love this movie!
B00L9B7IKE|5|Great read.  Hard to put down!

B00FPOSDGY|5|Won't say any more than I need to. Fantastic book, well written, very well done. You will love this book, I promise.
B002ZBTWL0|5|This is an excellent recording of a Verdi opera few people know. It was first performed at the MET only in 2010, the opera Riccardo Muti chose for his (overdue) house debut.  That production left a lot to be desired because of the strange, un-Verdian approaches of the director, costume designer, and set designer, but it was musically about as good as you can get these days and showed off the vigorous young Verdi.  This recording made some years ago is even better and highly recommended.  I don't much care for EMI's penny-pinching approach to notes and libretto: they are supplied on a \\"bonus\\" CD and you print them out yourself.  You won't be disappointed in the performance, I promise.
B002S9DRA6|4|I am enjoying listening to the collection. In one of my moves I lost her c.d.s....so wonderful to have her back in my house again. I'll be sure she doesn't get lost again.
B000P0J0D8|5|Even though Gary Oldman is only on screen less than 15 minutes, it is a great performance.<br />I only wish their topic of conversation with Samuel L. Jackson and Paul Bates could have been cleaned up a little  bit.<br /><br />Enjoyed performances by the late Dennis Hopper & James Gandolfini.<br /><br />So sorry for the loss of Director Tony Scott.
B006885EFE|5|Amazing stories of combat and how that affects the soldiers involved touches the heart, the soul, as well as, the mind.
0345803485|1|horrible
B008NW67E0|5|It's not very often the a sophmore album is exponentially better than the first, but for Mumford & Sons, this is the case.  This album far excedes their debut album and makes me excited for the music I will hear from them in the future.
B00I6IKSZ0|5|This game is awesome you can get a date and create your own skin make friends and also be on a<br />Team I think you should get the app cuz it's AWESOME!
B00HETD0KC|5|I love all the Harry Potter books so much and I have so many things on Harry Potter that is was a good collection when I got for $150.
3869930691|5|One of the most comprehensive and best strategy guides out there. I had already beaten the game twice and still wanted this book. The lore in this book alone makes it worth every penny. If you like souls games this is a must buy.
B00BSZZA3I|3|Don't like how the flap that covers the screen doesn't stay covered needs to be longer and have like a magnetic or something
0743298020|2|All I could think from beginning to end was how incredibly trite the whole thing was. It's a fast airport read I guess, but I don't even know if I would recommend it for that. I suppose I wanted to know the outcome, but I figured out the \\"twist\\" long before it was revealed and it made finishing the book a chore. Super light reading.
B00CBKLO52|5|This sim is awesome! Great graphics, good controls, and there remote control boats, planes, cars, and helicopters. Get this sim if u like all these!
B001UV4XI8|2|The Digital Copy is practically unwatchable with all the macroblocking.  The voices are totally lost in the mix so you'll deafen yourself turning the volume up to hear it.  The DVD is no better.  I seriously can't believe that WB felt like this was an appropriate way to handle their cash cow.
B004EC5IUW|5|When I first heard they were remaking the Evangelion series I thought, \\"Why? So you can put it on blue ray and get more money out of me?\\" Then a friend showed it to me and I was blown away. This remake is like watching a completely new show. Same characters and basic plot--but they've changed the storyline a lot! And you know what? So far I like this version better than the original. It's not as depressing, and it's a lot more exciting. Shinji has really manned-up. Rei has other emotions besides \\"robot.\\" Gendo isn't a complete sociopath. I feel I can actually follow the storyline. I just love this remake! I like the changes to the story. I like the characters better. And honestly, I like the animation better--the angles are just awesome. I can't wait for the next installment.
B004P1JEXE|5|Amazing book, fills in a lot of the side stories and points of view from other characters and their locations. It's a must read if you are an actual fan of the entire book series to date...
B000002C25|5|Even after reading about how terrible this album was, I just had to buy it and judge for myself.<br />I personally liked the &quot;over-production&quot;.   I also didn't think that the songs were too long, but you have too judge  for yourself.  I think that much is a matter of personal preference.  This  album undeniably has an Oasis sound to it, though.<br />&quot;(What's the  Story) Morning Glory?&quot; is definitely a better album.  There are some  great songs on this album, but the rest are forgettable and  boring.<br />&quot;D'You Know What I Mean&quot; is a really, REALLY cool song,  one of the best on the album.  The album gets off to a strong start, but  it's only downhill from here.  It definitely doesn't go on too long.   &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; is a loud and boring song.  Worth it only for the  line &quot;Into my big mouth, you could fly a plane&quot;.<br />I am the only  human being on the planet who likes &quot;Magic Pie&quot;.  That's alright.   More for me!  Seriously, I've listened to this song over and over again,  trying to figure out what everyone's trying to say about this song, but it  always strikes me as a great song.  The songwriting could be a bit better,  but it's still the best song on the album.  It's got the strongest chorus  on the album.  It's just grand!<br />&quot;Stand By Me&quot; is another really  great song.  &quot;I Hope, I Think, I Know&quot; is the second shortest  track on the album, all the better.  The opening riff is stolen from  &quot;Underneath the Sky&quot;.  It is a nice song, but just doesn't grip  me.  &quot;The Girl in the Dirty Shirt&quot; reminds my of &quot;She's  Electric&quot;, but without the latter's charm.  The best line of  &quot;Fade In-Out&quot; is &quot;Today is just a daydream, tomorrow we'll  be cast away&quot;.  This song also is nice, but the songwriting could be  better.<br />&quot;Don't Go Away&quot; is simply beautiful.  Enough  said.<br />&quot;Be Here Now&quot; is a pretty good song.  The bestpart of  the song for me is the line &quot;Sing a song for me, one from Let It  Be&quot;.  (I also like the &quot;yeah yeah yeah&quot;'s at the  end.)<br />&quot;All Around the World&quot; is a good song, and doesn't seem  to long.  It's just a bit overkill, too much effort trying to make it an  epic.  If you try too hard to create something, it usually ends up  artificial.  Oasis fans love it, critics hate it.  Again, the best part for  me is the &quot;Na Na Na&quot; part.<br />&quot;It's Getting Better  (Man! )&quot; is, I think, highly underrated.  &quot;Maybe the songs that  we sing are wrong, maybe the dreams that we dream are gone...&quot;<br />Don't  be influenced by all the critics and so called &quot;fans&quot; who bomb  this album.  This is not the disaster they say it is, but songs like  &quot;My Big Mouth&quot; and &quot;The Girl in the DIrty Shirt&quot; make  it boring at times.  So don't be influenced by all the fans who say that  this is the greatest thing since toilet paper.  &quot;(What's the Story)  Morning Glory?&quot; is a better buy.  Why?  In one word, songwriting.  I'm  still gonna give it five stars, though.  Tracks 1, 3, and 8 get five stars  each, tracks 4, 10, and 11 get three stars each, 1 star for track 12, and  no stars for the rest.  NOT an Oasis essential.  To uneven, without any one  really great song like &quot;Live Forever&quot; or &quot;Wonderwall&quot;.
B009NFHF0Q|4|A delightful story with plenty of magic for the imagination.  I wanted to see Lettie come back, maybe it will be another story.
B0064MGU98|4|Good acting interesting plot especially lead actress<br />A little melodramatic but kept my interest especially through frequent shifts of power between the protagonists
B005LAIGSM|5|best movie
B001FB4W0W|5|What more could you ask for? Colorful characters, burning love and lust in the bayou, prejudice. The first episode is clearly feeling its' way around but by episode 3, the show is really hitting its' stride. A must for vampire lore lovers and those who like sardonic wit. and nudity. There is lots of nudity on this show. I watch it for vampire Bill.
B0010SKUYM|5|I was caught up in the writing of this book from the first chapter. I had to stop myself from highlighting the entire book. The story is written in such a way that I felt hungry when he felt hungry and that kind of closeness to the character made this book a special read for me.
B0087JTAKW|5|This is a really great parable. It made me think and best of all it soothed me. I recently lost my father in law to cancer, and my husband is so sad. I think I will read this book to him.
B00N35P5MW|4|It's a great time waster, and I am writing this so I don't continually get told that I need to rate the game
B00AQL8VU4|3|Why create the tablet app without the capability to play Prime/Instant videos. I like the interface much better than the mobile version, but I have to keep the mobile version for video viewing.
B008UCJ7KO|1|I've been waiting for this book forever and was going to order it but before I did I wanted to read the reviews to see what people thought so far.  I'm happy I did very disappointed this is not the end will not be buying the book...<br />This should of been done....
B009AMANBA|5|Being a history student the era of the American Civil War has always interested.  If I should have ever had the opportunity to met Lincoln, I think that i did in this movie.
B00AIUUXHC|3|This game is pretty good, but some problems in-game. 1st, the &amp;#34;daily reward chest&amp;#34; is rubbish. I was close to the mystery prize, but the next day it sent me back to 200 coins. 2nd, while you are battling the giant crab, you can't hit it more than one time.
B00000294R|5|THE BEST EVER RIP A MIC.  THIS ALBUM WILL STILL BEAT ANY ALBUMS THAT IS OUT NOW TILL THIS DATE.  THE ALBUM IS DOPE. LYRICS ARE SO SICK, BEATS COULD DO BETTER, BUT WHO CARES.  IF YOU ARE JUST RIDIN ON BIG L, JUST KNOW THAT HE'S ON OTHER ALBUMS FROM D.I.T.C, SHOW@AG, AND DIAMOND D.  HE'S EVEN GOT AN ALBUM HE'S MADE FROM AMSTERDAM WHEN HE DID A CONCERT BACK IN 1998.  I GOT IT.  IT'S REAL UNDERGROUND.  HE'S EVEN GOT UNREALEASED SONGS THAT ARE DO TO COME OUT THIS YEAR OR NEXT WITH A DVD.  AND THAT FREESTYLE HE DID WITH JAY-Z, HE DESTROYED JAY-Z IN A 7 MINUTE FREESTYLE.  OVERALL, BIG L, IS ONE OF THE BEST, THIS ALBUM IS HELLA DOPE.  COP IT.
B000957O82|5|Will Smith delivers yet another AWESOME movie!!! Had only seen one preview for the film and thought it looked decent, since I love many more of Will Smith movies didn't see any harm in giving this one a shot!  Happy to have taken a chance on it!! :o)
B00002SSKI|5|love it
B00JB3AOEY|1|bizarre and not interesting
B00FAPF5U0|2|This would be a great game if it was not a money scam.  It only allows you to complete a specific number of games and then you must purchase more &quot;lives&quot; to continue.  What a greedy ploy for money. No wonder it was free.  I'd rather have paid for a complete game.  Shame on you.
B002AWJEU8|5|Steve was the editor! His vision through and through!  His music played with the violins makes the older songs sound new and fresh.  This DVD is a feast for the ears and eyes, as only he can do it!  I would have to make that seven stars *******
B000N2HBSO|1|I ordered this book but it was never delivered to my Kindle. I don't know why but I re tried to download it and it said I already had it . When I go to manage my kindle it is listed there, but I still don't have it. Same with the other book I ordered by same author same date.
B00AZL3PBK|3|Well was having fun with the game till now won't let me pass the first level on the desert world I die without even touching game
B003U51D58|5|Followed all the episodes from session one through six, was unable to see season six until just recently<br />Loved trying to figure out the direction the show kept changing to, all the suspense and mystery.<br />For me it was great acting and fantastic scenery.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Very good read....thought provoking....funny and sad.  John Green makes the characters very real and you can feel their emotions, good and bad.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00005QCVY|4|Summary:<BR>George Bailey (James Stewart) is a hometown boy with big aspirations.  After finishing high school, he is going to tour Europe then go to college and become a big name architect and construction job manager, building huge dams and great projects.  Everything seems to be headed that way, too, until his father, Peter Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds), has a stroke and ends up dying.  His father was the head of the local Savings and Loan and without his guidance, the vile Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), the town miser, plans on a forced takeover of the Savings and Loan, much to George's Uncle Billy's (Thomas Mitchell) wishes (and to the detriment of the town's poor).  <br />The only way to save the Savings and Loan is for George, whom everyone respects and trusts, to step in as the new chairman and takeover.  Giving up his tour of Europe and college education, George does the 'right' thing, and takes over the Savings and Loan, which is really the only thing standing between the poor of the town having a chance to live decent lives and Mr. Potter taking over everything and grinding them into the mud.  <br />In giving up his college dreams, George has to watch while his younger brother, Harry (Todd Karns), uses his money to go to college, becomes a football star, then a war hero.  George also watches his new found love, Mary (Donna Reed), go off to school.  All of this turns George bitter, but he presses on, despite the problems.  Eventually one good thing does happen, Mary comes back, and despite his bitterness towards his lost opportunities, George marries Mary and they make a life together as the advocates of the town's poor. <br />George, who helps the poor despite it hurting the Savings and Loan and keeping him perpetually poor, eventually runs into trouble.  His forgetful uncle, Billy, loses an $8,000 deposit on Christmas Eve, just when the local auditor comes to check over their books.  Without that money, George and Billy are bound to go to jail.  As it turns out, Mr. Potter is the one who found it, but because he wants to crush them out of business, he doesn't give them the money.<br />For George, this is the last straw.  Knowing his life is ruined, he finally breaks down and is mean to people, starting with his Uncle, but moving to his wife, kids, their schoolteachers, and, well, pretty much everyone.  Until his guardian angel happens upon the scene, Clarence Oddbody (Henry Travers).  Clarence appears just in time to stop George from killing himself then helps him to see all of the good that he has done for the people of the town and how much they need him.  Once George realizes this, he can't wait to get back home, despite the impending jail sentence.<br />But when he returns home, even though the police and the auditor are waiting for him, he finds that his incredible wife has brought the townspeople together and they are going to bail him out.  Thus ends a touching tale about how kindness can make you much wealthier in terms of relationships than can money.<br />My Comments:<BR>Believe it or not, I had never seen this movie, despite it supposedly being a classic Christmas film.  I was a bit hesitant, because I tend to enjoy psychological thrillers much more than sappy dramas, but I ended up appreciating this movie.  However, my appreciation went much further than what I would consider the superficial heroics of George Bailey, who saved his younger brother and was nice to people.  It was also deeper than the townspeople coming together in the end to save George and the Savings and Loan.  What I really liked about this movie was the communism.  Yep, that's right, this is pure communist propaganda and I loved every second of it.  But before I get into that, let me talk about the story and the acting.<br />The story is pretty straightforward.  It does cover quite a bit of time, but does so well and convincingly.  There aren't any major plot holes and the only kind of quirky thing is the intervention of the guardian angel.  For most people, the divine intervention is probably one of the best parts of the film.  As an agnostic, I recognized that many people probably enjoyed this notion, but it was really just a necessary tool to illustrate to George what life would have been like had he not been born.  And, yes, the portrayal of George's town without him was a bit extreme, and the idea of someone not being born wasn't particularly well-fleshed out (though this is a drama and not a science fiction thriller).  But overall, it's a sound story that hits all the right marks to jerk a tear.<br />The acting is also good.  There are some weaker links, like Thomas Mitchell and some of the other peripheral characters, but the main actors, Stewart and Reed, were really very good.  (Oh, and Donna Reed, am I the only one that thinks she's attractive?  I never thought I'd hear myself say that about Donna Reed...)  Anyway, I can't really complain about the acting.  It was really good for its time and pretty good for today.<br />Now, back to communism.  Yes, this movie is about communism, but not Soviet or Chinese communism.  This is essentially a boiled down version of Marxist communism, where the people own everything. It also is a brilliant depiction of the exploitation of the working classes by the bourgeoisie, in this case Mr. Potter.  George's attempts to help the poor and maintain the Savings and Loan are Capra's way of defeating capitalist exploitation.  Hooray for the little man!  Three cheers for labor unions!   If Frank Capra was just trying to tell a story and was not trying to criticize capitalism, then I'm a double-headed pig that can use a computer.<br />Overall, this is a very good film.  It is well-produced, convincing (except for the whole guardian angel/talking in space thing), and the acting is good.  But what's more, it has an anti-capitalist message.  I can't say it was perfect, but it was touching and inspirational.  If only we could take out the religion stuff, I'd say we have a rallying cry for social democracy (okay, leave in the religion for now, but eventually...).  Anyway, if you haven't seen this movie, yes, it's sappy, but it's also heart-warming (and Donna Reed's cute).  You should definitely check it (and her) out.

B00B5A9FLY|5|Merlin was an EXCELLENT family series that was brought to us by the BBC. The series was canceled after 5 seasons. Family oriented televion is hard to come by in todays world! Myself & my family are EXTREMELY SORRY to see it go : (

B009JZSC9S|5|Great Show no commercials. Join Prime and you can enjoy it like I did. This is a really good Series started from Season one and couldn't stop. Ridley Scott production so you know it kicks ass.
B000ZINGIK|5|I only recently discovered Edguy and am very impressed with their ability to shift from pure power music to enjoyable ballads. I wasn't sure what a solo effort from front man Tobias Sammett would be like. This CD rocks and uses several talented and recognizable vocalists to enhance the overall enjoyment of the music. The title song alone is worth the price. Jorn Lande sings with Tobias on several songs and his deep powerful voice adds a great dimension to an otherwise excellent CD.  Everyone that I've played this for loved it. I find myself listening to this CD more than any other recent purchases. Outstanding power metal with a couple of well written ballads. Highly recommended !!!
B00J9APGGA|5|Excellent -  Item delivered on time, was as described

B006XF5BTG|5|had this book for xmas which was an ideal read just before the new year training regime kicked in<br /><br />this book completly blew my mind of how informative & detailed it was, the way in which the advice was put across made complete sense & was toatlly helpful in making me realise what i needed to change in my workouts to gain full benefit from them<br /><br />if your into training a feel stuck in the same routine without getting any major gains this book will inspire & excite you to try something new & at the same time putting it across in a way which completly realistic & achievable

B00D5LC4GY|5|I enjoy spending time with this game.  It is challenging and the colors make it fun and light. Sometimes it is easy and sometimes not , and I like that about  a game. Thanks.
0679809015|4|I ordered this book based on all its' glowing reviews. I was a little disappointed when it arrived though. It's very small... yes... good for throwing in your purse etc.. but the flaps inside are also very small. Too small for my 11 month old to use, and a little difficult to find. I'm still going to give it four stars. The illustrations are very colorful and fun. The location of the flaps with-in the pictures is very well done... it's just a shame they are so small. I'm sure my son will really enjoy this book in 5 months or so. <br />*** For a better young age appropriate lift the flap book, try \\"Hide and Seek Farm\\", by Grandreams books. This book is a little bigger, but the card board flaps are huge, and the illustrations simple and colorful. My sons loves this series! (Hide and seek Ocean, Forest, Farm, Pets, Jungle, and Polar)
B00E8KLWB4|5|I can't seem to get enough of this game! I keep coming back for more. Simply a whole lot of fun!
B007PT3QOQ|1|I hope nobody paid for this game.  It must be meant for children because it held my interest for about 30 minutes before it got deleted.
B00004XONN|4|How can this be a bad album? Am I the only one who thinks this is a brilliant piece? Where is everyone?<br />I thought this is right up there with their two previous albums (OKC, bends). Many reviwers here point out that there is hardly any melody, just noise. I think its the other way around. I found  a lot of euphoric melody (in reminicense of OK Computer), and the noise actually made sense!<br />To the upset reviewers: did you actually think they should have made a second OK Computer? If you believe Radiohead is one of the greatest bands of this (and the past) decade so far, leave them to experiment, and not produce the same album over and over again. Doing that may prove that they are not so productive, and may cause them to lose credibility.<br />To the hopefuls: Listen again. and again. and again. You will eventually like it. Im surprised some people did not get it on first listen. I did!<br />To the ones who loved it: Rock on!
B005PD0VDI|5|The Tree of Life doesn't fit on the same spectrum as ordinary movies.  It is a spiritual message, not an entertainment.  If you get it ( I do) it's almost beyond criticism.  Many (most?) must find it incomprehensible.  Some people immersed in a rigid church life may see it as a &#34;new wave&#34; thing and hence unacceptable
B00JOP9TM2|5|Fantastic album
B00FOWX6NM|5|Good
B00H8C4HZ2|5|The portrail of a tragic part of our history brings back memories of my childhood.  So many attitudes have changed, so many more yet to come
1402760663|5|An excellent (and classic) book at a very good price. The photographs, etc. really bring the story to life. If you are interested in the history of the American Indian, this book is highly recommended.
6305263302|5|If you are looking for one of the greatest vampire(or vampyre) movies of all times this is it! Simply stated this movie will scare you to death and will make you cry for the love and the loss portrayed in it. If you think  you have seen a horror movie that inspires more thought than this one I  dare say that you have watched one to many horror movies. This vampire is  the original of the legend that we have come to fear. Simply put, be  prepared for a swirling mist of incredible acting and a portrayal of love  that will knock every sense in your brain alive. Superb acting, a great  story, and stunning camera portrayals of Nosferatu will make your heart  skip beats. Nothing tops this movie, nothing!
B00QW8TYWO|5|I love this game
B00005JKNF|2|It's watchable, but takes too much time to get the story line going. My time is valuable. I fell asleep twice and had to go back to catch up. A rental for a slow Sunday afternoon.
B00FB13Y74|4|The game is really fun, but the real time waiting for recharge is the worst, I have to leave it and then after that I don't go back for a while since it doesn't appeal to me much then.
B000QCQ8Y4|4|Action without pause.  A fine read.
B009ZQC7MY|5|Love all the series they are so good. Can't wait for the next to come out. Would recommended to anyone wanting to see true characters.
B008673ZAQ|5|As good as 50 shades and Gabriel's Inferno<br />A little more explicit but a very screwed up addicting love story

0385344333|1|I have read and enjoyed every Jack Reacher story prior to this.  I, like many others, could not wait to finally read another about my favorite character.  Although previously, I could not put down any Reacher book; I actually looked forward to putting this one down.  It was so boring and so pointless; that even though I had only 25 pages left I almost just stopped reading it.  Mr Child what happened?  Did you have someone else write this for you?  I am so disappointed with this book and now with Tom Cruise playing Reacher, a hulking blond, blue eyed man I may just have to give up any hope of enjoying another story of a character who used to be one of my favorites.
B006XOBFTM|4|I got this primarily for the recording of the Ninth Symphony, I had it on the CBS budget Odyssey label decades ago. The transfer is excellent, and it remains probably my favorite Mahler Nine (along with Abbado and Chicago). The other recordings are more variable in quality, but all have the authoritative Bruno Walter stamp on them. And, the price is &#34;on the money.&#34;
B008UG0JJI|5|Hiromi is a musical force that must be heard (and seen) to be believed. Her technical ability, combined with unparalleled improvising skills, are incomparable. This DVD captures her at her best.  Her band mates,  drum legend Simon Philips and bass god Anthony Jackson, rise to her challenge and make this recording a must-have item for any serious jazz-rock fusion lover.  Certainly, it isn't your run-of-the-mill jazz band.  There is not much that is 'traditional' about it, but, on the other hand, they never venture into 'smooth jazz' territory either (thank God!!!).  This DVD captures a marvelous performance, sometimes manic in tempo and full of ferocious improvisation, at others, highly lyric  and sweet; it is one of Hiromi's finest recordings yet. So, if you're in the mood for some unbelievable pianism, brilliant invention, and truly inspired music-making, this is the show for you!<br /><br />As an aside, this is Hiromi's latest concert DVD - her fourth.  I would highly recommend all of them.
B00BLCHYKU|5|Great characters and story. The brother plot line is really interesting. The battle scenes aren't bad but definitely not movie quality. It's more like game of thrones season 1 or Camelot on showtime which are in line with my expectations for a show like this and they so a good job at it.
B006LSZECO|4|At first it seemed like this book was drawn out but all of the sudden you are sucked in. One minute you feel sorry for the wife. The next minute you feel sorry for the husband. I kept changing sides most of the book. It is a roller coaster of truths and lies.
B004YEJGEO|4|Fun game, some easy levels, some head scratchers! Some &apos;moves&apos; appear to really mess up the layout or light paths. I&apos;m not sure if that&apos;s a feature or a bug. Sector 2, Level 15 appears to have issues, with inconsistent behavior of switches and &apos;doors&apos;.

B00BD99JMW|4|Twisted ending and unexpected outcome
B000UBMWG4|5|This version has been on my wishlist for a long time and was glad to score it at a reasonable fair price at amazon.com - especially the 4ht disc containing the interviews with philip k.dick - which is my favourite sci fi writer - and the deleted and alternate scenes are a joy to watch.  This version stands now high on my BD shelf between the European final cut version BD and the also sheer beautiful spinner included unicorn cover edition.  Each time i see this film i am enljoying the sheer beautiful sight of the spinners flying through the LA air.
B000050AMB|5|After a powerful and unforgettable tour, David Cross left the group, for the same reasons that Ian McDonald did in 1969. Fripp has said that is better to rest after one exhausting tour before taking regretabble decisions. Less than one week later, the trio of Fripp, Wetton and Bruford got in the studio for another album. Few bands falling apart have obtained a record so concise and powerful as Red. An idea that does not seem good in the paper, but functioned as magic: the rollback of old members, such as Ian McDonald, as guests. The result is a fusion of the elements that had formed King Crimson, since 1969. Mel Collins' sax is the star of the brutal &quot;One More Red Nightmare&quot;, accompanied by Bruford's curious percussions and Wetton's devastating bass. Marc Charig, who has shone in the end of &quot;Islands&quot;, loans his conrnet to &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;. Even the heavy instrumental &quot;Red&quot;, with its circular structure benefits from a cello solo. The improvisation &quot;Providence&quot;, recorded in the second to last concert of the 74 tour, still with David Cross, is one of their most interesting, counting with a somber introduction in the violin. The band develops it into a furious number, and the abrupt end must be given to the fact that the original recording lasted 3 minutes longer (it can be found in the box The Great Deceiver). And to finish, the great triumph not only of the album, not only of this lineup, but all of King Crimson: &quot;Starless&quot;. It starts with a sad melody in mellotron, graced with drenching saxophone, violin, guitar and deep vocals of John Wetton. The piece then converts to an agonizing experimental section, with uncommon percussions, driving bass and a nervous guitar solo. Fripp repeats the same notes, and slowly magnifying the tension. The release comes: McDonald's sax enters in the explosive and complex final section. Robin Miller enters with the oboe to reaffirm the main melody, and after that mellotron. To describe something so intense, cathartic and emotive in words would only result in empty conjectures. Live versions featured intersting arrangement variations and different lyrics, and were generally more furious and exciting, and consequently less concise. I strongly recommend checking it out on The Great Deceiver box set. &quot;Red&quot; was played live with the lineups that followed. Soon after the announcement of the album, Fripp decided to disband Crimson - which was preparing to a new tour with Ian McDonald. Sad but true.<br />The new gatefold 24-bit remaster is much better. The booklet with photos from the last gig and newspaper clippings is priceless.
B000255LIY|5|While the original is a masterpiece of writing and Katharine Hepburn and Peter O'Toole are epic legends of the silver screen....there is not enough in the original to draw interest among my generation. This remakr was necessary because the original was no Gone with the Wind. The best that the original had was the writing and the performance of the two key actors nothing else. Unlike Gone with the Wind there was no great expense or exquisite artwork and design or costumes that would warrant it to not be remade. But this performance, the intensity and raw emotion, the beauty, the authenticity of Henry and Eleanor in the Middle Ages comes to life and does great honor to the original. I believe Peter O'Toole and Katharine Hepburn would be very proud of the performances made by Glenn Close and Patrick Stewart. My generation and future generations rely upon remakes to look back to the original to enjoy both. Every now and then we do need to rejuvenate the originals in order to generate interest in that which is timeless. Just as Neoclassical art generated interest in the original classicism of ancient Rome it intrigues and inspires. I think this is one of the finest re creations I have seen.

0876855575|5|If you know nothing about Bukowski this is a good place to start.  You'll have a MUCH clearer picture long before you finish.  This book is somewhat biographical though it claims to be fiction.  With Bukowski anything is plausible and if it didn't happen to him as told in the book it probably could have.  Sometimes I think he's a genius and other times he seems to me as just a drunk misogynist with some writing skills.  You decide.<BR>If you do enjoy this you might consider renting &quot;Barfly.&quot;  This movie, starring Mickey Rourke, came out around 1987.  Rourke seems to have captured the essence of Bukowski on film.
B000001FAU|5|There simply is no other effort in rockdom that equals the raw power of Rising.  Blackmore's guitar, Dio's voice, Powell's drums, Carey's keyboards, and Bain's bass provide a texture of music that simply has no equal.  From the opening track to the close of &quot;A light in the black&quot;, intelligent songwriting and powerful musicianship will give you years of enjoyment.  Buy this one and you will *not* be disappointed.
0393327345|5|When first reading Fight Club, I was a senior in High School. The book caught my attention and featured a storyline that I could never have been familiar with at 18 years old. After reading it again as a 22 year old, I still have no insight to such a world of problems, but can certainly relate to people that I have met in the past. Fight Club is a novel that takes a wonderfully unique idea and expands it to the filth and scurge of society.

B000006NPY|5|I bought Adore while I was searching for Soul Coughing's new cd (which I found later, and still love) and was expecting.....nothing. I was a virgin Pumpkins fan, having heard hardly any of their songs, new or old, except  the gigantic hits. For expecting a whole lot of nothing, I was VERY  pleasantly suprised. Billy Corgan has one of the most interesting voices in  music today (whine! hmmphhh) and paired with some brilliant music, BOOM!  You've got this wonderful cd. I sadly have no other cd of theirs, and am  current ly lobbying with my parents to get me Melon Collie... Pray for me!  This cd is one of the only bands (the other is Garbage) in my Sarah  McLachlan dominated top 10 cd list.

B00FJ2YTLK|5|The love letters had me to my boarder line, of streaming tears. I absolutely love the whole trilogy, I want to give you a high five for writing the books. I felt so close to the dad when he died, he was America's world;and also figured he told August about the journals. I love obstacles the young couple had to face to make the end, their beginning. I only wish I didn't have to let my imagination run wild with all the changes the new king and queen will make.

B00000JPHD|5|Almost 70 years after its initial release, this version of Bram Stoker's classic novel remains the definitive horror movie, and Bela Lugosi is the definitive Dracula. While many actors played the part of the hypnotic, blood-sucking count, Lugosi is the only performer who truly lived the part. He was known to walk around town in his cape and give interviews while inside a coffin which he kept in his home. This guy was truly dedicated to his art, though that might be putting it much too mildly. This film is actually a recreation of the role Lugosi played on stage in 1927. Purists argue that the movie is more of an adaptation of the stage play than the actual novel. But who cares? When Lugosi is on-screen, that's the only thing that matters. He's such a strong, commanding presence and few actors have ever taken their roles as seriously as Lugosi took this one. In fact, one might say it was his life rather than just another movie role. I get chills every time I see this film even though I know the outcome. Seeing Lugosi prowling around the foggy streets of London after midnight and preying on beautiful and innocent young women for their blood still gives me the same morbid excitement that it gave me the first time I saw Dracula over ten years ago. Truly the best of Universal's monster movies in the '30's, rivaled only by that same year's FRANKENSTEIN starring another horror legend, Boris Karloff.

B000PMLFRA|1|It's really simple. People in 1977 loved your film. For many years after, people loved them. When I was growing up in the early 90s, I loved them as well. But even at the age of 12 when the \\"Special Editions\\" came out, I knew something wasn't right with them. I had grown attached to the original trilogy, the way the story was meant to be told, and the additions of the \\"Special\\" versions did not fit in. The new stuff didn't add anything. All of it was just fluff, never intended to be in the film in the first place, with the obvious exception of the Jabba extra scene, and even that was butchered. If it didn't fit in anymore, just leave it as a bonus on the DVD and move on, that CG mess was completely uncalled for.     As a student of film, and avid lover of the art of film, the fact that not only would you, Mr. Lucas (I know he probably won't be reading this, but still), shrug off the complaints of your first bout with \\"special enhancements\\", but you would further insult when we finally get to see these films in an HD format. It shows a total disregard for the art of filmmaking. What happened to your love the work of Kurosawa? Do you think he would ever do such a thing? Maybe add a CG horde of bandits to Seven Samurai, or a loud melodramatic \\"Nooo!\\" to the solemn ending to Ikiru? No, it would never happen, because Kurosawa was an artist, and I'm beginning to think that you aren't and probably never were. I can understand the feeling of not being satisfied with something that you've done. Most people probably can relate to that. But the finished product was cherished by many, many people, and it belongs to them just as much as it belongs to you.     I know that you're a business man first, and a filmmaker second. I know that despite the thousands, maybe millions of dissenting voices you'll hear over this will probably fall on deaf ears. But I urge you to think back to the late 70s, when you were a struggling artist who nearly killed himself to bring his vision to the world. How would that young man view what you have become today? Bottom line, your fans are just that for a reason, because you made a wonderful piece of art. Please, stop insulting them.
B0000C5RQF|5|In this DVD's special feature, renowned Mozart interpreter Sir Colin Davis states (or quotes another musician) that, &quot;Mozart is simply God.&quot;  He compares this composer's Singspiel in two acts to Shakespeare's valedictory work, &quot;The Tempest,&quot; and relates that one of Mozart's characters actually quotes Prospero.  This occurs when Sarastro is speaking of the Queen of the Night:  &quot;This thing of darkness I / Acknowledge mine&quot; (5.1.275-76).  How very appropriate since Mozart's librettist Schikaneder was among other things a Shakespearean actor. Mozart himself was said to be working on sketches for an operatic version of &quot;The Tempest&quot; when he died.<br />This production was filmed at the Royal Opera House, Convent Garden in January, 2003 and one of the most pleasing aspects of it is that the producer has achieved unity of music, text, and staging.  As the conductor says, &quot;you can be an old man like me or a little girl of seven...&quot; and the 'Flute' will still enfold you in its trifold magic.<br />The designer, John Macfarlane chose an unusually dark Baroque setting--&quot;When will this endless night be over?&quot;--but there are flashes of brilliance, some of them paying homage to Ingmar Bergman's version of this opera, e.g. the scene in the Speaker of the Temple's study, the trials by water and fire, Pamina's attempted suicide, and Sarastro's final exit with the flute (although this Sarastro doesn't toss it gleefully into the air).<br />One of the most extraordinary aspects of this production is its Papageno.  Simon Keenlyside is a nervy, cynical birdcatcher.  He is not simple, so much as burned-out.  This interpretation makes his attempted suicide seem very much in character, but I had trouble believing that he would live happily ever after with Ailish Tynan's brassy Papagena.<br />The Austrian bass Franz-Josef Selig is a portly, paternal Sarastro.  The low Fs of &quot;O Isis und Osiris&quot; are no challenge to his dark voice, but he is less successful with the second great bass aria, &quot;In diesen heilgen Hallen&quot; which sounds a bit shouted and effortful.  His speaking voice resonates with deep, mellow calm, and I'd almost rather hear him talk than sing.<br />The Queen of the Night, Diana Damrau will cause the hair on the back of your neck to rise up with her unearthly arias.  She was voted &quot;Opernwelt's&quot; Young Singer of the Year in 1999 and I hope to hear more of her.  She commanded the stage and the Night, as well as every difficult passage that Mozart wrote for her.<br />Will Hartmann as Tamino is a little pinched at top, but suitably noble.  He is an excellent, believable prince.  Dorothea R&ouml;schmann is his sturdily-sung Pamina.  Usually her suicide attempt is more believable than Papageno's, but not in this production.

B009JBWOU0|5|excellent packaging for a classic movie set! shipped very quickly and securely. this set also includes a batman photo book and a hologram on the box. very worthwhile- a must for all batman fans!
B00FRVH3V6|4|A 4 because it stops to soon and I wanted to know how it turns out<br />Also I hope it has a sequel
B00E9PMML2|5|I am a Star War fan. I misplaced my original movies and so glad that I was able to get them from you.
B007R41E8O|4|I am a lover of hidden object games, and this is one of the best ones I have tried. I would highly recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|4|Very good story and well written. Good historical background. Kept my interest throughout. Some characters were a little trite and cliche.
B00EDY5KTA|4|I could do without all the extra music and second disc. But, the first 12 songs on the first disc are AMAZING
B005PK56TA|5|Excellent!! What it sucks is that only the first season is available for free (amazon prime). Once you've hooked, you're basically forced to pay to watch other seasons.
B009GEBBNQ|4|The start of this movie was not that good, but the action in the end more than makes up for it....great last hour.
B00009P1O2|5|In 1986 i went to see Queen at wembley on the Friday...Now thanks to Queen and the dvd people i can watch highlights of that Concert & this the whole of the Saturday gig in fantastic 5.1 surround sound and vision..Queen live was always an event and now re-live at all again..Forever Queen rock!!
B003DNN0L2|5|Wonderful !!
0756405890|5|Better to read a well-written book twice than read something mediocre once.  Mr. Rothfuss comes from the school of \\"show don't tell\\".<br /><br />Description of settings are lush, immersive. Characters are well-formed and believable.  Warning: if you are more of a plot/action person, you're going to think parts of it drag.
0790741520|4|This 1996 film is about a terrorist hijacking of a jumbo jet to get a jailed terrorist freed. They succeed in this release, but then decide to drop a nerve gas bomb over Washington DC to kill millions. \\"Its only a movie.\\" But I wonder if this movie put ideas into the minds of Al-Qaeda? The hijacking of the jumbo jets on September 11, 2001 follows the ideas of this script. Except they used the jumbo jet itself as the bomb.<br />In 1987, after a problem with a flight attendant, all guns were banned from flight personnel. This enabled terrorists to easily hijack a jumbo jet. This would never happen on the many foreign airlines where their pilots are armed! I hope this mistake will be corrected soon.
B00AHXIC50|5|Bruno brings it in this album showcasing his voice and talent. Great songs from slow to quick with excellent beats.
B009XIXVU6|4|The book is very well written but maybe a little bit wordy.  The story is good and I liked the way the author tied up all the loose ends when the book finished.  It may have been a different culture but not too hard to understand why the father felt he had to give this child a chance for a better life than he was able to give her.
B002I0J5FG|5|Classic, artful games. Very low price. HD, 3D. If you've never played Shadow of the Colossus, and have a PS3 - now's the time. beautiful experience.
B0026IUXO2|5|This is such a well done film, led by an amazing performance by Cate Blanchett in the title role. She should have won an Oscar (but, instead it was given to Gwenyth Paltrow for Shakespeare in Love, which was a good performance but not as good as Blanchett.) She is supported by Geoffrey Rush, who also was great. I'll keep it short & sweet: If you want to see a great film with fantastic acting, watch this movie. You won't be disappointed.
0800184327|4|If you like dancing this film is for you.  Lots of dancing where people are really having fun.  The story could be better but Vanessa William and Chayanne work well as a team, sound good together and are both very easy on the eyes.  The music is hot and fits the movie perfectly.  Also some very funny bits.  Fluff but I mean that nicely.
B00338QENI|5|There's a reason it has been so widely recommended. It reads like a novel but is filled with sociological and scientific themes that seemed terribly painful but necessary to explore. Revisiting mid 20th century scientific and medical norms brings back the very important history on which our current practices depend. Well researched but expressed in a readable dissertation for any reader. Commentary at the end reminds readers of how complicated research and medical practice are.
B00HCOSF3G|5|a good song that just makes ya smile and feel happy.  the movie was funny also.  sound quality is great.
B0000025RI|5|Good  cd
B00FN811SY|5|I think this app. library is one of the most user friendly apps available and it covers all of my biblical research needs!
B008Y6WRIA|5|I thought it was a wonderful movie. One I can share share with my family. No sex scenes or infidelity or filthy language. Yippee! Just goes to show good movies can be made without them.
0544336267|1|Don't be fooled by the name - this is NOT all four books in the series.  It is ONLY The Giver.  I have no idea why it is subtitled (Giver Quartet).  Misleading and disappointing.
B009EEOQIU|5|One of my all-time favorites, I really enjoyed seeing it again on Amazon Prime - for free! Thanks, guys, plus, your quality is really getting better! No troubles whatsoever!
0385509456|5|I'm rather shocked by some of the negative reviews of this book--- I won't go into the plot, as it were, as it's detailed elsewhere--- but it strikes me that those who find the book fascinating are people who can appreciate a narrative for its language, perspective, and ability to open one's mind.  I fear that, just because it's a short book, some readers thought it would be an easy read.  It's not a classic mystery, it doesn't have a classic plot--- but it's a remarkable feat of writing in that the author could so totally convey the thoughts and viewpoints of an autistic adolescent.  As for its use of profanity--- honestly, I can't even recall it; it's simply part of the environment.  Christopher reports exactly what he hears--- that's the point--- he's unable to edit, screen or interpret symbols around him, whether they are facial expressions or colloquial expressions.  I consider this an extraordinary piece of writing, and can't recommend it highly enough for readers who will appreciate what it offers.  Nancy Drew it ain't.
B000P0J09M|5|Great movie!
B00EOARZ4G|2|While I appreciate the author(s) attempts to weave past and present together, it just didn't feel like a true Clancy novel.  The detail and history from first five or six novels is clearly missing here and there were far too many loose ends.
B0041D843M|5|This book has already, definitely, changed my life. His argument for a more plant based diet becomes more compelling as his evidence unfolds - and there is so much of it. And it makes such good sense: it kept me nodding in recognition and then often being surprised by those 'Ah-ha!' moments where Campbell has revealed the bio-chemical reality behind some simple but significant changes we can make in our diet. I have been telling all my friends and family to read this book.
B00FVZJUS2|5|Very good movie to watch. The whole movie keeps you entertained. My kids loved the movie as well. excellent family movie.
B0088RQ4X4|3|Having paged through some of the old John Carter stories a few years back, a fairly campy version of the same brand of Sci-Fi typical to Jules Verne was something I expected. But Disney seemed to want to straddle the lines between this mold of Sci-Fi and the grand epic movies that Kevin Costner was dabbling in from \\"Dances With Wolves\\" to \\"The Post Man\\", exhibiting some of the strengths of the former, but also some of the negatives found in the latter flop. The characters are sympathetic, particularly the striking princess of the city of Helium (aka the heroine of the story and John Carter's love interest), and John Carter's character manages to embody the reluctant Byronic hero depicted in the novel.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest hurdle for most younger people watching this movie will be the antiquated understanding of the planet Mars as potentially having humanoid life on it (and breathable, oxygen rich air), with a healthy helping of cliche visuals from Alister Crowley's concept of what an alien looks like amid all the non-humanoid characters on the planet. Throw into the equation a group of deceitful aliens that prey on the destruction of planets that all but embody the cliche of an Illuminati sect., and most will probably puzzle over this being labeled as Sci-Fi, when its parameters seem to conform more to high fantasy given the updated understanding most have of astronomy.<br /><br />Nevertheless, for a kid-friendly adventure movie that is mercifully not made entirely out of Pixar characters and CGI generated images, this is pretty well realized and mercifully free of the overt slapstick comedy that tends to get employed in many modern reworkings of classic 19th century fiction. The inclusion of the author in the story itself is an interesting touch that, while not uncommon during the era that the story was penned, has since become a less common practice in both the cinema and the printed page. Don't expect a dazzling series of plot twists and depth of character reserved for the likes of \\"Inception\\", but definitely expect to be entertained.ter reserved for the likes of \\"Inception\\", but definitely expect to be entertained.
B005RAO0GS|5|This entire production is perfect.  Sometimes one comes across music that is never tiring.  Such is the achievement here from Florence + The Machine!
0393312836|4|If you have seen the movie you may as well have read the book.  I do not mean to say that it is a bad book by any means, but don't expect anything more.  The only thing you get more from the book is the last chapter, which was not included in the movie
B004SOR4H6|3|This is a great app, but since the latest update, My kindle reads &quot;Twitter has stopped&quot; every time I try to log in. I hope this issue gets fixed really soon.
B00B5HQLMI|5|Great 007 movie.  I am not crazy about Craig as James Bond but the movie was great.  A lot of twist and turns to keep you guessing.
B00EEL0LGY|4|I loved this game until I moved my SD card and lost the game data.
B00006AG5N|5|Just what I wanted. Loved the product.
0345363132|5|I read this book several years ago in the hardback form.  It's huge size and heavy weight belied what an easy read it was.  Ms. Penman's greatest gift is her ability to breathe life into her characters to the point where  you feel you know them personally and become emotionally involved with  them.  It was hard to reach the end of this book for two reasons:  (1) I  didn't want it to end the way I knew it had to, and (2) it was such  wonderful reading I just wanted it to go on and on.  Ms. Penman is truly  gifted.  I always recommend her books to anyone who loves reading history.
1451627297|3|By now you get the idea of this book's basic premise - a man has the opportunity to go back in time and possibly prevent the Kennedy assassination on 11/22/63.  A neat idea in concept, and I had high expectations from its author.  To be clear, though, Stephen King is a liberal.  A seemingly angry one at that, especially as he gets older.  And his snarky leftist jabs at all things traditional in America, from the late 1950's to the present, serve only as a distraction from what would otherwise be an interesting story.<br /><br />I agree with many of the other reviews that describe this book at bloated, and that it could have been several hundred pages shorter, and more likely to keep the audience's interest.  His depiction of time travel got a little abstract toward the ending, but the audience owes him some amount of license, because after all we are talking about time travel, without a sci-fi premise, or moving faster than the speed of light.  I was concerned that this depiction would go the way of the touchy-feely Celestine Prophecy, but it successfully resisted going in that direction.<br /><br />But after reading the final pages of the plot, there is an AFTERWARD section in which King credits those who helped him with his exhaustive research in getting the facts and details correct, particularly regarding the steps leading up to Oswald's fateful day in Dallas.  While I am all for historical accuracy, King's declaration of his desire to be unerring is undercut by his condescending hyperbole, spread out at regular intervals throughout his novel.  If he had let the audience draw their own conclusions or form their own opinions, King would have demonstrated that even in his later years he still has the ability to remove his own ego from the fascinating stories he has told for decades.  But he couldn't leave well enough alone, and his injection of political commentary served to alienate me.
B009C7JS14|4|User friendly.  Good graphics resolution.

B00B4RP0OO|5|Works great!!!

B005ZOBNOI|5|A very touching tale of love, life, and death. I laughed and cried, sometimes at the same time. I highly recommend it.
B00HYTSTNU|4|Re Captain Phillips:  Like it very much. The ending was too long, hence made the film almost boring during the ending.
B005AUWXZ0|5|Prompt delivery.  Item is exactly what my grandchildren wanted for Xmas.  Great to have a digital version so they can watch it on my Ipod.
B00005U152|5|The other versions are excellent as well, including Lon Chaney's silent epic; Charles Laughton saving Maureen O'Hara from burning Hollywood; and Demi Moore in her greatest performance in the Disney musical.  But for my money, this is the version to buy and cherish.  Filmed in France for Frenchmen, and secondarily for the international market, HUNCHBACK was criticized at home for failure to cast French actors in either of the leading roles.  It's not as if France in 1956-7 didn't have dozens of great stars, and wouldn't you have enjoyed seeing a version of this Victor Hugo tale with, say, Jean Gabin as Quasimodo, and Brigitte Bardot as Esmeralda?  Instead the producers went elsewhere, arguing that in the novel, of course, Esmeralda's \\"foreignness\\" was an essential part of the tale, and the same for Quasimodo.  Gabin was, indeed, a very real possibility, for he was director Jean Delannoy's Inspector Maigret in several films and the two clicked together on a personal level as well.<br /><br />Thus we have Anthony Quinn as the tortured church servant, and Gina Lollobrigida as Esmeralda.  She plays up the Gypsy aspect quite a bit, and in general cavorts like she's Demi Moore trying to have a good time, but something of her fate seems to be hanging over her handsome, tousled head, and the shadow of the gargoyles is like the guillotine--a factor of doom.  Lollobrigida had just finished filming TRAPEZE and was given only four days' holiday before reporting to Paris for the arduous, twelve-week NOTRE DAME DE PARIS shoot.  (Notice how buff her arms are in those sleeveless peasant blouses, that's a holdover from her training for TRAPEZE.)<br /><br />Lovers of French film will rejoice to see Roger Blin in s smallish part: Blin starred in everything from Cocteau's ORPHEUS to Clouzot's LE CORBEAU, and in NOTRE DAME DE PARIS he's very stylish, though badly dubbed into English.<br /><br />Best of all is the lustrous color photography!  Because this was a production partially financed by the French government, approved by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux, the production was allowed to film directly in the Cathedral itself, so every time you see an interior shot, or so it is said, you are peering into the mysterious Notre Dame itself.  The long shots of Quasimodo pouring molten oil over the battlements were recreated largely in the studio.  Watch for the famous bateaux-mouches parading lazily up the Seine, which has never looked more beuatiful.  This film was nominated for a \\"Cesar,\\" the Oscar of France, but somehow lost to a smaller product.  The day of the \\"new wave\\" was at hand and it wouldn't be long before the names of the moment would be Louis Malle, Jean-Luc Godard, Agnes Varda, Chris Marker, and Francois Truffaut.  When the bells ring in the ancient cathedral, they're ringing out the end of an era, and ringing in a new dawn for French film.financed by the French government, approved by Minister of Culture Andre Malraux, the production was allowed to film directly in the Cathedral itself, so every time you see an interior shot, or so it is said, you are peering into the mysterious Notre Dame itself.

B00FEMJF6O|5|I love my Castleville Legends....
B00J2PCCYQ|4|I didn't understand what all the &#34;buzz&#34; was about re: Frozen - it appeared to be just another animated, kid-friendly film.  But it is so much more.  The animation is first-class and the wonderful characters,  story-line and the singing really grab you.  Every song has you toe-tapping.  It's just a great, uplifting and fun movie for kids and adults alike.  Highly recommend.
0316204366|5|This was a really interesting book.  The author shows in many different situations how being an &#34;underdog&#34; can actually be a strength as it may mean you use different strategies from usual which turn out to be very effective.  It's also an easy read.  I would recommend it.
B00005QFE5|4|I thought this was a great movie about love. The way the main characters expressed themselves and thier budding love. And the love of the son for his mother and father. I was touched by this story.
B00B2V66VS|5|So much more fun than the old game.  And u have to  be quick! Have no trouble with the game at all.
B0051ANPZQ|5|Loved the story! Good plot, very realistic. I would definitely recommend to adults and children. Readers will fall in love with Auggie!
B005GP7F8Y|4|Caveat: Buy or rent the Blu-Ray version...the Net**** version is not worth your time. This is essential viewing for Marlon Brando fans as it is the only movie he directed; performing quite well behind the camera. It is also a superb Western, with Brando in the lead role. Running from the law after a bank robbery in Mexico, Dad Longworth (Karl Malden) finds an opportunity to take the stolen gold and leave his partner Rio (Brando) to be captured and imprisoned. Five years later, Rio escapes from prison and hunts down Dad for revenge. Dad is now a respectable sheriff in Monterrey, California; and has been living in fear of Rio finding him. That will set the stage...watch it to see how it plays out. In addition to Brando and Malden, look for Katy Jurado as Dad's wife; Pina Pellicer as Louisa, Dad's stepdaughter and Rio's love interest; Ben Johnson as Rio's sidekick and Slim Pickens as Dad's deputy sheriff. Brando interweaves themes of betrayal, revenge and hypocrisy into something strangely hypnotic and real. The other key to this film is its setting on the west coast of California, giving it a feel and rhythm that is rare in the Western genre. All in all a greatly neglected treasure....highly recommended for Brando and Western fans!
B00AREIAI8|5|This game is awesome. It shows you how to take care of a real horse. You feel like you're actually in a stable owning your own horse.
B007ZXK08C|5|Cleverly written, well built characters and a great story with depth, dark humor and a lot of twists. It never gets boring and although it is not completely realistic it never gets ridiculous. Flynn is a great contemporary writer who manages to create believable, three-dimensional characters. Absolutely recommendable for people in relationships!
B004SIIBGU|5|Indispensable for the eBay user.  I'm an eBay power user and use the iPhone app and now this Android app, which is a little different.  But it is just as effective as the iPhone one and has a lot of information on the Kindle Fire screen -- which I find very good.  Again, it's free.
B00IRISI42|5|A very exciting read. Puller is tough, honorable, and human. In his latest adventure, he proves that blood truly is thicker then water and America needs a man like him In these troubled times. Exciting and thoroughly enjoyable.
B009CWWFD2|5|Written as only Jeffrey Archer can.  Held my interest all the way through to the very end.  I highly recommend this to any other person who enjoys a good book.
B001UJUGZY|1|Gosh! Since that awful adaptation from the Japanese classic, Sarah Mcihelle Gellar acts all of her roles with the same distant, faceless look. It's weird.<br /><br />This one is another flop, lazily executed, excrucitingly low. Well, maybe for a TV moive it would be enough.
B00J9IH1RO|1|Can't make it work
B004MC8CA2|5|It is an awesome app.  I read it every day for my devotions.  I like that I can easily find the chaper and verse I am looking for.  Great addition to my Kindle.

B00GXKVZSW|5|This show is amazingly interesting and entertaining. It is well acted, well filmed and the casting is perfect. Also, the puns are delicious.
B0009I7NNA|4|Yeah, so there's none of that on this, the latest release from A7X, if you think that means it sucks feel free to smack yourself over the head with the nearest heavy object. <br /> <br />Ahem... at any rate. <br /> <br />I'd like to state first-off that I absolutely disagree with the sentiment \\"If you're an Avenged Sevenfold fan, don't buy this album.\\" Different though it may be, it is very much full of all the things that made A7X a great band in the first place.  Growls or not, Shadows still belts out as powerful a vocal delivery as ever, if not moreso.  City may is a bit less extreme, but it still rocks thoroughly in its own right. <br /> <br />As far as people screaming that the band has \\"sold out\\", please refer to the opening paragraph of this review, and repeat as necessary to purge yourself of stupidity (take your time, I'll wait). <br /> <br />What it comes down to is that while City of Evil might be a bit different than A7X's previous releases, it's manages to be a great album.  The band seems very tight and comfortable with the new material, marking a steady improvement in them as writers and musicians.  They're playing to their strengths here, which do not lie solely in Shadow's abilit to growl.  If anything, City is somewhat more enjoyable than previous efforts in that it comes off as much more cohesive as far as the flow of the music.  Make no mistake, they still manage to inject a nice ammount of variety into the songs even with a slightly streamlined approach. City of Evil is a consumation, not a compromise, and a very promising 3rd outing from a very talented young band. <br /> <br />So basically, if you still think City sucks because there are no growls on it, or if you think A7X \\"sold out\\", please keep hitting yourself.  If, however, you are a fan of well-executed, tasty hard rock music, feel free to grab this album.
B004MC8CA2|5|So far I am well pleased. I like that I can read off line with the bible version of my choice. Not all, but the majority of them are available for of line reading. All that is required is that you create an account with YouVersion and more features is available to you. Very simple to use. I like the daily scripture and chapter reading posted when you open the app. No Bible dictionaries, but that wasn't too disappointing to me. My main focus was to find a Bible that is easy to use anywhere with the flexibility of quick switching Bible versions. It takes time to find the right one to fit your needs, but this one is for me. I'm so glad I don't have to look no farther.  Try it out! It will only cost you a little of your time.
B00000J6AG|2|It's a moderately good dance record with a couple of stand-out tracks. It's nowhere near as good or as ground-breaking as 'Everything Is Wrong'. It's sample overload. It's a unfocused. It works in places and not in  others. It's 'clever'. <br />If you're dipping a toe into the murky waters of  dance music, and you want a 'safe' CD from a North American artist to play  at dinner parties, buy this. It's better than Deep Forest or  Vengaboys.<br />But seriously, how is the Best of 99 list made up? Who  decides? It's like a dance music equivalent of a rock list including The  Eagles, The Rolling Stones and Pink Floyd. All good acts ... but not in the  running any more.
B00KT3LC7I|5|Love! Love! Love! Listened to it for an entire 4-hour plane ride and never got tired of it.
B001IBIHQ4|5|This movie was in all aspects, amazing. I felt all the actors did an outstanding job in the roles in which they were cast. I bought the series and have watched it several times.  The movie has acheived near perfection in every way, save one glaring fact: the Marines who landed on Guadalcanal in August, 1942 were armed with the 1903 Springfield; old rifles left over from World War I, they were NOT armed with the 1903A3 Springfields as seen in the movie. Check it out.  They were not.<br />  Perhaps the 1903A3's were the only ones Hollywood could find enough of to arm the actors?
B00KY7PEAA|5|This game is awesome because you can join alliances and talk to them and help them out. I recommend this game to patient people because it might take a while to build all the buildings you need.

B00LLMFAAG|4|These are all songs I remember from the 70's and 80's, but might not have acquired if I hadn't heard them in the movie. Plus, I remember some of the movie scenes while listening to this album, and now i want to see the movie again.
B00E3UN44W|5|Although the ending of the season Three was to a certain degree predictable, nobody seriously expects Sherlock to die (sorry for the spoiler) in a modern version of a Charge of the Light Brigade, the story lines simply get better and better. The problem is that you would love to see more of these pair and the savory secondary characters, and these stories have been carefully and meticulously crafted giving the end product an almost magically quality, but they are so few... Quality regrettably requires time, and this people are true to the form and content of this jewel of the crown. (Forgive my clich&eacute;s, but life is short....) Do I love the series and the characters? Does a Kodiak bear eat salmon? Elementary, I would say, even if Sir Arthur Conan Doyle never said it, it is, it is so, and it shall be.
B00KW272YS|5|Fast Cars, Fast Bikes, and a Cute Girl...Doctor and Doctor go to Russia for more action packed weekend!!!  rent it
0812981480|4|A well written, historically sound analysis of a subject of a story for which there is scant written evidence available.  The author makes a convincing, but not unassailable case.  Well constructed, carefully documented and interesting to read.
B0086700CM|4|Very addictive game but fun for the whole family to play!  My 8 year old loves it!  It is such a fast paced game that it is easy to take turns or just useful to kill a few minutes worth of time.
B000P0J0AG|5|Heat is a long yet beautifully and at the same time intricately plot mixed movie(which I don't appreciate for other movies this one YES). Michael Mann Did a Good Job unlike on The Insider and Later Miami Vice. Anyhow,De Niro And Pacino are great. (Unlike a later collabo which did not work for me) The Action is great,the vehicles,Corvette*sparsely in there*,Camaros*base models*,A Peterbilt,and other vehicles! Val Kilmer is surprisingly good,jon voigt as well, all the actors, it is a great cast and great action and story throughout the movie.One of the Best Movies out there.
B0006L16N8|5|Coldplay has once again proved that they are one of the best bands in the world right now. This cd is absolutely amazing, and outshines Parachutes as well as ATOBTTH. I dont care what anyone else thinks, this is their best work so far. Every song is good, and there is 13 of them. 13 great songs make this cd a triumph. If you even remotely a coldplay fan, pick up this cd. You wont regret it. I bought it tuesday, and i havent listened to anything else since. I've been waiting for this cd for years, and i must say it was well worth the wait. Dont listen to the horrible reviews that people are making up. This cd takes a couple listens to appreciate, because it is pretty long, and each song sounds different. People who are giving this cd less than 4 or 5 stars have voiced their opinion, but I do not agree with them. Just listen to it, and see for yourself. Its worth it.
B00292V3PS|5|Hey...if you don't \\"get\\" how great this show is..then I don't know what can interest you.  The first 4 minutes of this episode just grip you...Tess is evil...Clark is faced with a moral dilemma and there's a chase thru a dark forest...all within the first 4 minutes of the show.  This is what great storytelling is all about. Oh...and BTW...Tom Welling directed this episode.  What talent! I love Smallville!
B004G6009U|5|My daughters (3 and 5) love this movie: and luckily its cute so I don't mind watching it over and over again
B008JFUTUY|5|I am a musician, and this film touched home with me about how random the business can be.  But more than that, it was well produced, and the music included with the film was excellent.  It lead me to purchase the two CD's that Rodriguez had available again after all these years.  A humble man with a strong message, whose time had come in the 60's but not in his own country.
B005IQZB14|5|Wonderful. Cheryl is a terrific writer and the trail came alive under her pen.
B006GLLXXK|4|I enjoy this show, kind of a dramedy!
B00GMV8M2Y|5|Loved the movie.  Had a great story line never thought it would end that way. You have to see it.
B00DPM7TIG|5|Just a wonderful book to read.  I got drawn in to the story and couldn't put it down.  A very personal way to live through those years of German occupation of France during WWII. You will see both sides of the war and the effect it had on the people.  I highly recommend the Sidekick which will reveal lots of hidden meanings and explains why the story draws you in.
B008673ZAQ|5|I couldn't put this book down just like the first one. I can't wait for the third book. Waiting til Dec 31 will be hard.
B002O1TMI4|5|These guy's are very talented and have feelings which come across when they sing! What's wrong with that? They're different and I really love their stuff. Don't compare them with Queen~they aren't anything like them. These three guys love what they're doing and they're good at it too. I am 65 and back in the day,some bands had orchestra's playing with them~so what~just listen and enjoy!
B007HACDLK|5|I like most of the authors books and this was no exception.  kept me interested right up to the end.
B00L23RZO8|4|An interesting story, and it's fun watching.  It was a pleasant surprise for me to see so many popular and good actors in there.
B00PTB7B34|5|All the clash of clans games and similar are ok but this is set apart big time everyone who loves call of duty will rock this game out...
B0009HLDFU|3|...but at two discs, feels somewhat bloated and misses the mark of true greatness it could have achieved. <br /> <br />The concept of a \\"Hard\\" and \\"Soft\\" collection sounds promising at first, giving the band the chance to showcase both their hard-rocking side and a more delicate side separately. The problem is, this leads to a certain \\"sameness\\" in the sound to each disc, where one song begins to blend into the next and make it difficult to tell the true winning compositions from those that might have been better left as a b-side release (or simply back in the studio). Too much of a good thing, perhaps...or maybe simply too much of the same thing when a little variety track-to-track would have been more effective. <br /> <br />There are certainly enough stand-out cuts for the listener to put together his or her own great mixed cd. The Hard disc gets off to a blistering start with the title track, which reminds me of The Who with Dave's blistering vocals and Taylor's assault on the drumkit. \\"Best of You\\", \\"DOA\\", and \\"The Deepest Blues Are Black\\" also stand out as instantly memorable and up to the standards of some of the best Foo tunes before. <br /> <br />On the Soft disc, the lyrics really shine, particularly on tracks like \\"Friend Of A Friend\\", \\"Razor\\", and \\"Over and Out\\". But it all begins to sound a bit too mellow after a while, and I for one  could live without ever hearing Norah Jones mixed with \\"my Foo\\", as on the cringe-worthy \\"Virginia Moon\\". <br /> <br />The Foo Fighters are a band I have enjoyed listening to for some time, though I always seem to find their individual albums slightly lacking in consistency. \\"In Your Honor\\" is no exception to this, which is a shame because condensed down to one cd this could have been the best, most impressive collection of Foo Fighters songs to date.
B00ESNDQWY|5|Good writing good acting and pretty good plots
B00003CXCT|4|OK OK,yes these are the special editions and people have been complaining about the \\"New Coke\\" syndrome since 1997. Yes I was appauled that Greedo shot first. In this version he shoots at the same time. Lucas! How about him not shooting at all!? Han Solo is a pirate at this point with a price on his head. He doesn't have to have the heroic \\"never shoot a guy in the back\\" way of thinking. Y'know, one dirtbag rubbing out another. Other changes for the DVD version was Obi-Wan's Krytt Dragon call used to scare away the Sand People was altered. The Jabba scene was improved. He looks more life like and not like he belongs in a Playstation game. I also liked the addition of that scene where Luke sees his old friend Biggs in the hanger before the last battle. It added to the emotion on Lukes face when Biggs got blown away in the trench.    In Empire they changed a few more things... Why did they have to change Boba Fett's voice? (Actually, it was so he'd sound like Jango Fett, since Boba's a clone and all...) It didn't really detract from anything but when you've seen the movie as many times as I have you notice right away. They changed the image and voice of the Emperor. This was an improvement that evryone pretty much saw coming as we're all trying to follow Lucas' insanity. The worst change in this film for me was the one he did back in 1997. He changed Vaders dialogue near the end of the film. The part when Vader leaving Bespin after not bringing in Luke is surrounded by his commanders and troops walking to his shuttle. In the original he barks out 3 words scaring his men, \\"BRING MY SHUTTLE.\\" The mood was perfect, his men looked scared, and you knew Vader was pissed! In the SE version he said something completely different that did not at all show that same anger. \\"Inform my Star Destroyer to prepare for my arrival!\\" WHAT??? 1. He didn't sound pissed. 2. He didn't sound at all menacing. 3. \\"Bring my shuttle\\" would have worked with the new shuttle sequence just as well untouched. 4. James Earl jones was 17 years older when he redid that dialogue and it sounded like it. That dialogue change just sucked the life out of that scene as far as tension and where the mood was going.    Return of the Jedi: Well, I wouldn't have cried if he did away with the Ewoks. LOL The Sy Snoodles animation made me feel like I was watching \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\\" But since Lucas hated the original scene I knew that was coming. The added look for the Sarlaac Pit was unnecessary IMO. I liked the added celebrations of the different cities at the end but changing the Ewok song was lame. And the Hayden Christiansen thing at the end was just obscene. Why change the original image of Anakin Skywalker? He died at that age (in that stage in his life) so his image should be of the same age/appearence right? Also, those images are how Luke remembers them. How could you have a young Anakin image for Luke to see if he's never seen his father until after he took the Vader mask off him? I mean they didn't substitute an image of Ewen MacGregor in place of Sir Alec Guiness! That just plain didn't make sense.     The pic quality, sound, and widescreen is nothing short of stellar! The documentary disc was neat also. I do recommend this set for those reasons but if those changes I mentioned irked you as bad as they did me? Keep your original VHS/LD editions from 1995 or older to accompany this set because you'll always want to go back! Trust me.
B004MC8CA2|5|Highly recommended. It is easy to find passages, has tons of different versions of the Bible, and you can highlight, copy, and write notes on verses that inspire you.  If you switch devices, simply log into your account, and all your notes and highlights are still there. This app also has topical study plans like how to increase your faith and children-themed topics.
B00E5Q1HJS|5|Plenty of action and plot. Kept you thinking all through the storyline. Would watch again. Loved the scenes awesome stuff.
B005PK57IK|5|LOVE the characters. Great binge watch with 6 seasons!
B005HEVBGG|3|Good star trek
B0064X7FVE|5|Very informative!
B0002J4X1Q|2|I did watch Resident Evil: Apocalypse back when it was in theaters & I rather enjoyed it! this movie, I just got to today & found myself wondering what the hell happened. the movie is just so much stupider then the second one. I found myself laughing at parts where we're \\"supposed to be scared\\". the acting is just not that good, it's corny as hell. hasn't anyone in this film ever heard of a zombie before? if a zombie was coming at you, would you lower your weapon or blast it apart? like, what are they doing? I got so mad at this film cause it's so stupid. why do the characters have to be so dumb? I'll blame the writers, the director's for this. Resident Evil is not worth your time or money. I found the second one more enjoyable for some reason. so please, look elsewhere. I'd be more entertained by a fish swimming in circles.
B00992CF6W|5|My dad bought me this game but 2 kindles cant start a game try to fix it and me and my bro and bro and sis play together cause we can play with ipads
B000G75AE8|4|OK, I am pleasantly surprised by this album.  Slayer has been putting out junk ever since Seasons in the Abyss.  With the original lineup back it sounds more like the Slayer I jammed to in jr. high.  I remember the DAY a friend of mine in jr. high gave me his Reign in Blood tape, yes tape, not CD :) and said \\"you've got to hear this\\"  I was instantly hooked.     Christ Illusion is a definate pickup if you were a fan of Reign, South of Heaven, ect.
B00L9B7IKE|5|This book was described  as a story for those who enjoyed the twists and turns of Gone Girl and it definitely did not disappoint!! I couldn't put it down, even reading it on my phone on the way out to dinner.  If you like a gripping tale this is for you!
B00KG2SXII|1|what a waste of time and money. Whenever something eventful was about to happen the lights went out and then everything would be  dark. The story is very disconnected. Overall an awful movie
B00AA2I2NK|3|I'm a big Einaudi fan; If I had to make a top 10 list of my favorite songs of all time, he would probably take half that list. His albums have been great to listen to, and everyone of them has given me goosebumps, or given me a moment where I would just sit back and think \\"Wow, that was a brilliant, brilliant song!\\"<br /><br />Well, nearly everyone of his albums has done that. I didn't get that from In a Time Lapse. To be sure, it's very soothing, relaxing and enjoyable to listen to, and as a standalone its very good; but when you compare it against Divinere, I Giorni, or Una Mattina it just seems a bit... lacking. Put this way, there's nothing on here that I could liken to Ancora, or Canzone Africana or Oltremare.<br /><br />For those of you who are fans of Top Gear, it's a bit like the \\"fizz\\" that James May gets whenever he drives a really brilliant car. I get similar euphoric, wonderful feeling when listening to one of Einaudi's great songs. I'm sorry to say, this album didn't quite seem to have that.
B004GJDQT8|5|Amazon despatch and delivery is the best of all.
0385340559|5|I am constantly wondering when Child will fall off his game - but I have to wait longer as this one is one of the best of the Jack Reacher novels - and I re-read them all prior to reading the latest.<br /><br />Reacher is in rare form on this outing as we learn a big chunk of his back story. Each book truly just get better and better - and after \\"The Hard Way\\" I didn't think he could do it again. I was way wrong!!
B00J9IH1RO|5|Fine
B004UJAOLM|5|This book speaks on the true meaning of love and what it makes you feel and go through.  It is such a great book and the movie is even better....please get this book and read it.
B001UV4XUG|5|I'm so getting this movie! After I saw it a coupe of times, I realized I have to own it :) It's about a cute boy, his cute crush and their story. It's about becoming a man and staying true to yourself. It's about dreams, failures, hopes and that trip called LIFE. The movie is that much more adorable because it was a true story, based on the writer's love :)
0446615641|4|A most interesting piece of fiction that every reader will enjoy. The work contains different suprises at every turn of the page. I would strongly suggest the reader get a copy of the \\"Camel Club\\" first by the same author before reading this work. The characters are vivid, the action exciting, and the ending somewhat unexpected.
B008FOB124|3|After a 16-year hiatus Dead Can Dance, the esoteric world music duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, returned in 2012 with this new album ANASTASIS and a long reunion tour. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Dead Can Dance changed styles with nearly every album, and when they had stopped with [[ASIN:B000002N74 Spiritchaser]] in 1996, their sound was dominated by African drumming. ANASTASIS is something of a step back from that to the album before (\\"Into the Labyrinth\\"), e.g. synthesized ethnic instruments and music that sounds vaguely tribal but can't be fixed to any particular part of the world.<br /><br />The album does not have a promising start. \\"Children of the Sun\\" is a clumsily worded paean to the hippie counterculture that with its distinctive synthesizer loops sounds like it was left off Brendan Perry's last solo album [[ASIN:B004V9J53O Ark]]. Of course, Perry and Gerrard often feature their separate work on DCD albums, but it would have been nice to have something that sounded like it came from their joint recording sessions and not some earlier Perry date. \\"Opium\\", \\"Amnesia\\", \\"All in Good Time\\" continue this Perry soloing.<br /><br />On the other hand, Gerrard's glossolalia vocals dominate in the tracks \\"Anastasis\\", \\"Agape\\" and \\"Kiko\\". Not only are they not much different than music Gerrard recorded previously for DCD, solo projects and film scores, they aren't even much distinguishable from each other.<br /><br />Only in \\"The Return of the She-King\\" do Perry and Gerrard share vocals, and this is the one song really holds up against their old work. Gerrard takes a somewhat different vocal approach than elsewhere on the album, and multitracks these vocals to fine effect. Perry also gives up his serious message-driven lyrics for pure vocalizing that melds well with Gerrard and the synthesized strings.<br /><br />I cannot really knock this album; this duo knows how to craft some catchy tunes, even if they are now clearly following a formula. And my tastes remain weighted towards their music, which I've checked by going through their classic albums again. But ANASTASIS could have been much more and both musicians seem stuck in a rut. Perry announced intriguing plans around the turn of the millennium (for a Zen percussion album called \\"Zun Zun\\"), but abandoned them for the MOR generic synthesizers of recent work. Gerrard's inability to come up with new musical ideas has been noted for over a decade now.es remain weighted towards their music, which I've checked by going through their classic albums again.

B00992CF6W|5|Where's 0.11.0? I'm pretty sure its out but this is a great game!
B004J4WLB4|5|Simple but poignant.
B000002GLT|5|...I particularly appreciate Larry Taylor's bass ... great evidence that the rhythm section does not need drums to drive a song.<br /><br />Mayall is just himself ... always interesting ... &#34;Nature's Disappearing&#34; is blunt, unapologetic, ahead of it's time, and still all too relevant.  Thanks, John.
B002MQYOFW|5|I put this on my 10 year old daughter's kindle because her class was reading it at school, so she could follow along and recap at home. I made the fatal mistake of ready the first few pages and didn't put it down until I finished! It's my third time reading it and it's magical every single time. This book is great for preteen to adult. Some people say it's too dramatic and graphic for younger children, but they're reading it in my daughter's fourth grade class and it's less gruesome than the graphic images they're left with from the movie. Catching Fire here we come!
B000ID37RM|1|Renters beware, I only got 3 hours. The movie is great, however I feel ripped off, they should've given me at least 24 hours or made it clear that my rental was to expire in 3 hours. (and no it IS NOT in my rental library)
B000ICL3KG|5|I didn't rent this movie to jump on the global warming band wagon, just as someone with an open mind that likes to listen to current issues at hand.  I watched the movie hoping for fallacies or blatantly one sided opinions without counter-arguments but was hard pressed to find any.  Yes, Gore is passionate about this issue, yes, he might not be the MOST exciting/fun guy in the world, BUT he does bring to light some important issues to be thought about.  What I have the hardest time understanding is the people that are so openly against the possibility of global warming(Check out the one star reviews, most didn't watch the movie).  This is something very real to consider if you want to continue living on this planet.  Anyways, Gore does a great job presenting his point, and the DVD was well produced with enough varying scenes and themes to keep the audience interested.
B0089LOG02|5|I enjoyed this book. Sad, romantic, tragic, and hopeful at the same time. Not too sad, it was realistic. I loved it.
B005HJWWW8|5|This is my first review ever and I will make it short and sweet.---These things finng rock! Point blank!  I bought the beatss by Dre, and while I enjoyed the sound I felt like they were going to break. They did on the 2nd day again on the 2ND day.  I returned them and researched and bought the JVC xtream explosive's. I say they are a lttle less than the Dre's on sound but are far more beefy.  I hooked up the Fiio E6 to them via my Ipod Shuffle and I am blow away.  I danced in my living room for an hour straight and I am a 29 yr old man+Iraq Vet+Prison Gaurd.<br /><br />So put them in your drop buy and press proceed.
B004J4WKTW|5|I love this book. The imagery alone makes for a great read. I hope there will be a series. I can't get enough.
B00AQ3K8IU|5|Sweet, romantic, surprising. This book made me want to keep reading! Excellent story with a great ending. This book kept me guessing but really surprised me.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Once of my best purchases Yeh.
B00GCE3TCE|5|Excellent!  Very moving!  Characters endearing.
B00NF4PNUU|4|Amazing talent on this one!
0446573019|4|Good read.  This book had a great story line, and strong plot development that packed a lot of suspense.  Unfortunately, with such a great build up, the ending was a bit of a letdown.  It went a little too technical in the thriller moments.  Fun read though, with good characters and good intrigue.
B000VZYPB4|5|I love this show. It is made in a  way that everyone can enjoy it. I definitely recommend this series.
1556347308|5|Beauty is in the eye of the beholder (or should I say in the eyes???), lot of people are so used to other systems or are so strict about following rules that may find GURPS a hard to handle system, however GURPS is an excelent system for Role-playing. It has tons of rules and information (which some people may find overwhelming), but the beauty of GURPS is that you don't need all of them in order to play! The system is developed in such a way that you can bypass entire chapters without a problem. It is completely customizable, and adapts to any kind of campaign. If you are looking for a role-play system that allows you to play in different kind of campaigns with the same set of rules or if you are looking for a role-play system you can customize, modify, or adapt to the needs of a certain campaign, GURPS is the way to go!

B00HUCF6KK|5|There are a lot of other reviews here for this show, and I don't think I can say anything different than them, so I won't.  But I will say give this show a try if you like dark, brooding, thought-provoking shows.  I think you'll like it.
B006ID6NDQ|4|Well written.  I found no parts that dragged.  I cried, I marvel ed at her courage.  I listened to the horrible indignities she and other Jews had to endure.  This should be required in high school  especially for those misguided students that this could never happen.
B00992CF6W|5|Pretty good game for the most part, but could be better if they made more like the PC version.  Like have wolves spawn more frequently or add stained glass.
B009LQKHIO|5|Good read really enjoyed this book downloading the next ones now! It's a must read for sure. Great job Jill
B00005N6KG|3|These are my favorite style headphones for working out in. My only complaint is they failed after less then 5 months of use and are only warrantied for 90 days. Not horrible for an $8 product, but I'd expect Sony to stand by their products better then that.
B00991TCOG|5|I might be slightly biased in that I absolutely love the violin however Lindsey has created absolutely beautiful songs. For me it's been my driving music. Keeps me calm during rush hour. Which is pretty significant.  I feel it's worth 5 stars. If you don't feel that way check out her youtube channel then come back and tell me that this cd doesn't deserve 5 stars. Which you won't and if you did you would be lying.

B004QKNXIQ|5|great movies for kids
B006AZZPCM|4|This app suddenly  wont let me download or watch anything which i had this app ever since i got my kindle and im ticked off that it wont work
B00DL48BM6|5|First of all, I'll keep this short, because I hate long boring reviews.  I'm a history buff, so I very much enjoyed the movie.  Keep in mind, it's a Hollywood story based on actual events, so it's usually better to read the book either following or after seeing this type of movie.  So, check out &#34;The Monuments Men&#34; by Robert M. Edsel.  Excellent book..actually based on real events.
B00GSZEBE2|2|I played this game everyday... well, I used to. I even spent some money on th his game which makes it even MORE ANNOYING. But then all of a sudden , it stopped working like it used to. I have 53 levels and I maxed out on the imperial levels. I had $50,000 dollars for like 5 days. It no longer earned any money when i closed he game out... the only way it would earn money was if the set the sleep function on my kindle to never and left the game running all night. I don't know if it is related but before the game asked for push notifications before it opens. I selected yes and no each time it opens. It doesn't make any difference. TOTALLY SUCKS!!
B00005JLF5|4|The first spin-off of TNG launched in a spectacular way. Opening with the Borg battle at Wolf 359 (from TNG's classic two-part episode \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\"), we are introduced to Lieutenant Commander Benjamin Sisko. He is the Executive Officer on the Saratoga when the attack begins, with Jean-Luc Picard -former captain of the Enterprise and now Locutus of Borg - leading the assault. And quickly, Starfleet discovers they are no match for the Borg. Forced to abandon his damaged ship, Sisko is able to save his 9 year-old son; his wife is tragically killed. <br />Three years later, we meet Sisko as a Commander about to assume the position of command of a former Cardassian space station Terok Nor -now renamed Deep Space Nine. Starfleet needs Sisko there to help prepare the Bajoran's for entry into the Federation. And a bitter single father soon discovers, his newest mission to aid the Bajor may have been written in the stars centuries before he was born.<br />DS9's first season, like TNG before it, had many high and low points. The 2-hour opener was a better pilot than TNG, and featured a better theme music. Almost from the start, this spin-off was going to way different from TNG. Where everyone on Enterprise were a happy family and conflict free, DS9 introduced conflict galore. Sisko and his first officer, Bajoran Major, Kira, butted heads from day one. And instead of solving that right away, it would take years for them both to come to an understanding.<br />Political intrigue and religion would be the series bread and butter over seven years and while it would take most of the first season to introduce these concepts, it still had a handful of stories that introduced you to the characters that populate this show. The first season would also feature a few familiar characters that were first introduced on TNG. The biggest, of course, was Colm Meany's Chief Miles O'Brien. Meany, a part of the Trek franchise since TNG opener, brought Miles over to become Chief of Operations. The Klingon sisters of Lursa and B'Etor -who were involved in several plots to take over their homeworld - visited DS9 in \\"Past Prologue\\" and popular character of Q would visit with Vash (TNG's Captain's Holiday\\" and \\"Q-Pid\\") in \\"Q-Less\\". \\"Battle Lines\\" would kill off the spiritual leader of the Bajoran's, and the late Brian Keith shines in the allegory episode \\"Progress\\". Even Majel Barrett's mostly annoying character of Lwaxana Troi would show up in \\"The Forsaken\\".<br />But perhaps, the highlight of season one is \\"Duet\\", a tightly plotted tale of culpability. Guest star Harris Yulin shines as a coward who personalized the guilt of an entire race. It was, perhaps, Nana Visitor finest hour as Kira, who realizes for the first time in her life that not all Cardassians need to be punished for their 60 year enslavement of the Bajoran's. <br />With the season finale, \\"In the Hands of the Prophets\\", the series long-overdue conflict between the tolerant Federation and the deeply spiritual Bajorans comes forward in a tale of intrigue, murder and philosophy. With this episode Oscar wining actress Louise Fletcher begins her recurring role of Vedek Winn, and chews the scenery and steals every scene she's in.<br />Over all, the first season was uneven, much like TNG. Still, with a last two episodes, the series proved it could be different and still be entertaining and keep with in Roddenberry's vision of a peaceful Federation.<br />But season two would begin to blur the lines...<br />To be continued.

B00DPM7TIG|5|Beautifully written, exquisitely crafted, almost perfect novel, but the last 50 pages were superfluous. Highly recommend.
B000FC1JCQ|5|a well researched Arthurian novel with its emphasis on the socio-politico-spiritual status of women in the British Isles at the onset of the Dark Ages, especially with respect to the complete and abject dominance of the male culture over women's lives, which effectively denied a woman's basic human rights for the twenty centuries following the establishment Roman rule in Europe......
B00005JKED|4|***Movie fact: \\"John Q\\" was filmed before \\"Training Day\\", but \\"Training Day\\" was released first because the producers felt that it's unusual for Denzel Washington to play a heartless villian.  They figured that if the audience didn't like him in that role, then \\"John Q\\" was to be the apology.<br />Denzel Washington needs no apologies for one of his best career performances in this wonderful action movie.  This is one of the more unique and the best police movies made in 2001.  It brilliantly desplicts the use and the dealing of narcotics.  This describes perfectly how to be a good and a bad cop.  <br />Washington deserved his second Oscar win for his portrayal of a criminal police officer, an unusual role for him.  This proves that the brilliant actor has many more monumental roles in the future.  Ethan Hawke deserved his first Oscar nomination as a cop in training trying to do the right thing.  Hopefully, Hawke is seen more often in the future in roles like this.  Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Macy Gray prove in \\"Training Day\\" that they are talented outside of music.<br />The writers, the director, and the producers chose the perfect dark theme for this movie genre.  They make Washington's character's lifestyle as dark as it should be.  They desplict the drug houses and narcotic use as dirty as many of them are in real life.  They give Hawke's character the light that it deserves for being the good guy.  This combination blends with all events perfectly.<br />Those who are not used to such a unique movie may have to watch it twice to truly appreciate the quality.  The first watch may seem unproportioned.  The second watch will further understand all the scenes, therefore proportioning everything.
B000002VMH|5|When my Dad died in 2000, I stopped at Gravelly Point along the Potomac River where the planes take off, on my way back from a job. I popped \\"Diva\\" into the CD player and bawled my head off.<br />For a \\"tuff\\" old dude like me who cries maybe once a decade, this album gave me access to emotional release that I really needed at the time.<br />I really don't know any other album that gives me straight and true emotion like this one. The album, for me is singular and unique, and is a great contribution, not just to music, but to compassionate and intelligent human expression in general.
B0020BUWX2|5|It was very lively up to a certain point.  I enjoyed the story and even knowing the subject matter I found it mostly a positive review of the characters' lives.  Around 70% it took a turn toward drastically emotional.  A real tear jerker indeed!  The only thing it lacked for me was one more chapter.  I wanted to see consequences and plans.  But still a great book!
B003XF1XOQ|5|Great ending to the trilogy.
B00005RFAI|5|This CD...words just dont describe how much i love it.I feel like Pink is singing my life story. In every song there is words that describe how i feel in my life right now. Everyone will have some connection with this cd no matter where you are in life. BUY IT!!!!!!
B006ON41FC|5|Although it is not a complicated game, it does not need to be. This game supplies fun and challenge in an easy to play package. I seen no reason to give less then a 5.
B00JOT3HQ2|5|Half of the game but hey awesome
B004QZ9PLU|1|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks. I've read all of his novels. This one was disappointing. It seemed very rushed. The basic story was very reminiscent of The Notebook. However, I was not fond of the female character. I didn't expect a happy ending, his books rarely end happily, but this was just depressing. I felt so incredibly sorry for Dawson. He was such a great person who never caught a break. The ending was terrible and very predictable. Waste of time and money.
B00G3L13UQ|5|I adore Sophia Amoruso as well as Nasty Gal. Her story is inspirational and the Nasty Gal aesthetic that she created is edgy and fun. I can't wait to read this book again.
B00992CF6W|1|After updating it I can play. I tried to uninstall it an install it back,  but it won't let me.
B00KZ6WRAA|4|Good app

B00005JK8K|5|The new DVD only reinforces my initial response that WINDTALKERS is one of the best of the recent WWII movies filmed over the past few years. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. It was interesting to see that this DVD contains both Widescreen and Pan & Scan versions.your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict.
