B001BZ36HM|5|AWESOME
B00PG2QA1K|1|The most flimsy table I have ever seen. It just feels like a cheap piece of plastic
B00VJQ79KI|4|Is bright as hell. The only complaint I have is the beam in the center is more flood than beam. Other than that great light so far.
B00BK7LQXW|5|Good stuff, same as oem
B006ZJ1XF6|2|Not real happy with the product. Was expecting a much smoother ride but it did not deliver. Only positive was I didn't spend a lot for it
B007ZD36T2|5|Installed easily in less than 5 minutes total for both sides...read the directions! They fit perfectly on my 2012 Explorer. Only buy the best and you won't be disappointed
B00809XG40|1|The filter did not fit my 2007 T150.
B00Y5E96PM|1|It does not fit a 2006 Dodge Ram.

B001EPDLJC|5|Center Cap fit well on my 1999 BMW 328i. Thank You!!!!
B0009H51TO|5|good durable filter. catches everything.  one of the easiest items to change as part of a vehicle tune up.
B003LNJWTI|1|Horrible, one burnt out 3 days after installation and they're not even as bright as regular factory lights in my 98 f150
B00LC4M26S|5|Item arrived as described.
B007FGR852|5|Was a bit weird to install, took me about 45 minutes because there are no instructions. Make sure you piece everything together BEFORE you bolt onto your bike.
B004SL8568|5|very good item
B00IA9TKLI|5|Good price
B000C94EM4|5|This muffler is an exact fit for my 2002 Ford ZX2. Great quality . I am very well satisfied with my purchase. Installed by myself on my car with no problems. Best price I found anywhere also.

B0023VGAJ4|5|Just what I needed. Direct replacement as advertised. Faster than expected shipping.
B00LQAO4E6|5|Item arrived as advertised. Instructions were thourough and easy to follow. Looks as advertised.
B0029N7R6G|5|I LIVE, I DIE, I LIVE AGAIN.
B000QIQU5K|5|Worked well
B002R1097O|5|Waited way to long to replace these.  Wish I had done it sooner. Looks like a brand new truck!
B00HYHWCJY|5|Fits really well, like how they go up the floor pan to cover completely. Good investment!
B007W60K1O|4|Works as stated, but the black paint on the rubber cover was already flaking off during install. Other than that starts right up on my 2008 Nightster and its less than half the cost of other starters. Great buy.
B008PJDOSS|5|Filter arrived on time and as described. Numerous reviews speak to how difficult this is to install in 2012 Ford Focus but it was very easy.<br />I watched a video on YouTube (25 min long) that explained the steps in a slow drawn out way. The actual job took me less than 5 min but I credit that with having picked up the secrets in the video.<br />The oil change shop wanted $39 to install the $17 filter so it was worth my money and time to order it online.
B00L84EKI0|5|This thing worked perfectly and was relatively cheap
B00IVQMMNS|5|Mud flaps work great
B0014ORGBM|5|It is a sticker and it sticks.  does its job well!
B002JH7PEQ|5|Works great!
B000C5BVYM|4|This fit the OEM part not the Dorman 902-860 replacement. That came with its own gasket.
B00RPVKCZA|5|More than I could have possibly asked for. Best piece of plastic I ever had. But seriously the orange color reminds me to pick it up
B00803PRKW|1|Does not fit
B009CWMS20|5|Great quality
B004K9I2C0|5|I would by this again
B00M78820I|5|I love the sunshade, it fits perfectly, unlike many I had before.  It is very easy to put on and fold it back. The pouch is a nice addition to keep the shade away when not using.  Communication with the seller was very pleasant.  Thanks Josie.
B00F3WAFPK|4|like the yellow but this one scratches very easy and then the yellow will refract the light of the scratches
B00BK86OSI|5|I purchased these for our 2011 Nissan Quest and with three kids protect the seats perfectly. Well worth the price paid. Made of durable material and not cheaply constructed.
B00AZOV1RW|5|This came with every thing that you need,  all you need to keep is the tube and awning.  you get all new mounting hardware along with the brackets that you will need.
B000O1C47M|5|Bought this Robinair 2 stage pump, 1 foot Yellow Jacket hose, and Yellow Jacket charging tool with port for my micron gauge.<br /><br />After Nitrogen pressure checking, and 2 step Nitrogen flush.<br />125 Microns in under 2 minutes!!<br />Equalized and held 350 Microns steady for an hour.<br /><br />I bought this after trying the Ideal Mini Split Tool kit with a cheap vacuum pump and leaky gauges.
B005992QKO|5|good addition to my truck
B004HP2J0S|5|These really help complete the look of the front of our Rubicon. Super easy to adhere and have been in place for almost a year now with no problems.
B00CASDZKC|5|they are a must with kids. easy to clean
B002M722HI|4|I bought this to replace the OE bumper on my 02 Ram 1500 4x4 since I wasn't paying attention one day and backed into a pole.  The truck was originally put in service and spent most of its life in the Pacific Northwest.  The inside of the bumper was pretty rusty but nothing showing on the outer surface although there were a couple of small dents.  I wanted to replace it anyway and inadvertently gave myself a reason.  Now that we're in Las Vegas, I don't think rust will ever be a problem.<br />Typical Amazon service.  I ordered on Sunday and selected standard 3-5 day delivery.  The bumper arrived on Tuesday.  I opened the box and found no defects.<br />Removal and installation was pretty straightforward.  Just eight bolts hold the assembly in place and the new unit matched up perfectly even with a Drawtite hitch assembly.  Removal of the hitch, dropping the spare tire or jacking was not necessary.  This is a one person, 30 - 60 minute job with basic hand tools unless you have a 7 pin trailer plug mounted in the OE bumper.  Disconnecting the receptacle from the wiring harness and re-mounting in the new bumper will add some time.  It's a good idea to label the wires first.  I used air tools because I have them but they are not required.  A little penetrating oil on the old bolts is useful if they are rusted.<br />I gave four stars for two reasons: this bumper is not an EXACT match with OE.  First, the lamp sockets for the license plate lights do not fit into the new lens housings that come with the bumper.  I had to open the cutouts slightly on the housings to get the locking tabs on the sockets to insert correctly.  Second, the fit of the black plastic cover on the top surface is not precise and doesn't align the way the OE unit does.  This is entirely cosmetic and I doubt anyone will notice but Fey advertises this as &#34;Perfect Match&#34; and it isn't. The bumper assembly is made in China so these issues are not surprising.<br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the purchase and recommend this option if you need to replace a bumper and haven't damaged the frame.  A factory unit with all of the other necessary parts will cost twice as much so this is definitely the way to go, especially if you don't want to get your insurance company involved and want a professional looking result.
B000E7WLJW|5|excellent product.
B002SL9Y1A|5|OEM replacement for my 2006 RX-8 HID headlamp housing. Be aware that this does not include any of the bulbs, or the wiring assembly.
B008BLKI2U|1|Material came rolled but obviously is  not stored that way. So many creases. Heat gun on 1 one foot section for half an hour stretching and did not help. Only caused more issues. Have tinted other tail lights without this much trouble. Better to have paid someone to do the work instead of ordering this.
B000GOJWJK|4|Everything work great and I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00HMYIEGY|5|This is a good wiring harness for making a light install very easy. The main wires have a good gauge to them and a additional cover to help protect the wires. With a dual leg for the money it is a very good purchase. I bought one to do a 12&#34; led light on my ATV, and bought the harness again when I did another light project on my brothers ATV. I have no thoughts on the switch that comes with the harness, I used the high beam as a trigger for activating the relay therefore no switch was needed.
B0044A8XY2|5|Fit perfect!  Easy to install just like the original
B000I4JPZE|5|Absolute must for 1st time RV as a back up to a jack to change a tire
B00I52B6JO|5|Great service as well as great product!<br /><br />Thanks!
B008WH1LFG|1|These didn't fit my VW Toureg.  I bought OEM rotors and the thickness of the Power Stop rotor is off which prevents it from seating properly
B00CIQXMLS|5|installed working good  good price
B0027FYBNI|5|Moved into an office where a smoker had been -- this really helped with the smell until we got it professionally cleaned.
B002SAUY74|1|This didn't fit my 2012 Toyota Highlander. The lock pattern was not the same.
B000EBICHI|3|Seat is very comfortable but continually has to be put back in place<br />after exiting the car.
B000182DVK|5|Installed easily and looks great. Definitely reduces interior temperature when parking car at work on hot days, just roll windows down a couple inches with no worries about rain or storms that pop up.  Appear to be good quality and made in U.S.A., expect these will last a long time.
B00PAMUACQ|5|looks good
B001664JOA|5|this mattress made all the difference in the world, beats the foam mats that were there before.
B00WFHXGNO|5|very easy to put in
B000CF6RX2|5|Easy to install
B000AMBODK|5|Been using this stuff on all my vehicles for years, and never burn a drop of oil between changes, even on engines with up to 200K miles...
B0006Z9YOC|2|I thought this would be a lot bigger, and have a different top somehoe. It is stable however, and while we haven't tried it in a hurricane, I don't see it blowing away.
B012UYL4JE|1|It's impossible to separate the vinyl from the substrate because the cutter head cut through it. The application layer doesn't have enough tack, either, so it won't pull the vinyl up. In short, it's pretty much unusable. Also, the picture is of a white sticker on a black background, which would have worked fine against a window. What arrived was a black sticker. Which I would have been happy to put on my paint, but again... can't get it off.
B013EIBC3S|5|Someone ripped this off of my car and keyed where it was. 5/5.
B0089T0T46|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B00EECM5FI|5|Great product... Thanks to Amazon prime I received my product the same day on time!
B007NGBRN8|1|Very nice pair of boots and very comfortable.  The reason it got such a low rating was because in less than 2 months, the sole of the boot tore apart.  I do ride a bike, so I do not recommend.
B000MN4KQ0|5|Iv only had to use it about 3 times so far but every time its done its job very well!
B00CQA1T3O|5|Best price around an a direct replacement.
B007OW6M0Y|5|as described
B001KQAAFS|5|They're easy to install
B00JGP8I1S|2|BOINK MY HEAD on it many times but it seemed to help its just clumsy and big
B00PSD6K9Y|5|They seem like an excellent product haven't had any trouble with them at all yet they were a perfect fit for my 95 Dodge 2500 diesel
B00AZJFWJ0|5|Work great. 4th time ordered.
B007TY3C0A|1|Didn't work properly, when I'd turn my headlights on the brake light would constantly stay on. Took it apart and just put the parts I needed on the old taillight.
B005S0CQ4U|5|Nice product. Looks great on the car. Haven't seen any of the problems others mentioned here. Even has nice packaging
B00JMHF70A|5|Replaced the original, which was showing a bit weare
B0149N2TRU|5|Just like stock and fits fine
B00FZ3MYZ6|4|Sturdy pouch but does not include mounting fasteners.
B0010GL3AY|4|It was just what I was looking for.  Works great!
B0051RHZF0|1|You have to pull the front axles to install the lift and remove some metal from a arm mount or it will cut the boots. Didn't say anything about that on the description that I remember.
B00DBEPUV6|5|Great.  It saved me $40 and it was easy to install.
B00KGGTGO4|5|It was too big for my GMC Terrain but guess what I cut it in two halves and it just works fine for me. (Just duct tape the ends so the edges don't fray) Love the product and customer service.
B004BGTGY0|4|does the job
B001DKR3C4|5|EXCELLENT! chrome cover. As advertised.

B00GYDBPL0|5|Looooove my new frames.  Came in just one day!
B006NZTZLQ|5|I bought this during Amazon's lightning sale in July. Sure enough my 2004 Outback displayed its first CEL after 110k miles. The OBD read out the dreaded P0519 code. I had difficulty initially pairing it with my Android kitkat phone. I had to go to the Bluetooth settings and manually start the sync. Also, under the settings in the OBDLink app, I had to set the unit to use Bluetooth. Once done, the app links to the OBD units with no glitches.
B000WJEXAM|4|It seems like a good filter for the money. General research has it rated a little better than the OEM filter that came on my scooter. The Hiflofiltro seemed to be well made and appears to be working well so far. As I change the oil in my scooter every 1000 miles (yes, it's a bit of overkill) I don't stress the filters too much, so this was a good choice for me.<br />Price was good, shipping was very fast, so will be buying again, when I need more.
B00GTOJK0C|5|best price
B000C2CHHU|5|This kit was great it had every seal and gasket I needed for my entire 1mz-fe engine refresh, everything worked great no problems, good quality.
B004P9YBCA|5|Replaced my oem toyota 1994 4x4 stabilizer; what a huge difference in control and comfort and breeze to install.
B00ARJQGHA|5|I was sceptical at first because of the price. The dealership wanted to charge me $800+ for (8) ignition coils, thats over $100 a piece. So to find them less than $25 a piece had me nervous, but it was worth the try.  So easy to do yourself...one screw out, take out the coil and put the new one in.  I replaced two of them that were bad... took me every bit of 10 min.  My 2005 QX56 Infiniti no longer shakes and the engine light went off. Great product...fits fine. Will buy more if needed.
B000CO959G|5|a+
B00GWQ359E|1|Not a good product.. Bad quality.<br />I have been using this bag for less than 2 months and started to fell apart..  The magnets are not strong enough to keep the bag on position... Not recommended
B0006305WO|5|a+
B001EP0H8A|1|I can not recommend this cover at all.. I had a problem with the fit. Just a bit too large to fit the receiver in the draw tite hitch that I also purchased form Amazon in the same order. Ever so slightly too large. The square stock used to make the shaft is just not right. I struggled with a file, slowly removing material from the corners, taking my time to not hack it up.. It just wouldn't go in.. Finally I headed to the bench grinder and ground the four corners way down! Hacked it up a bit out of frustration.. But it took so much work that in hindsight, I should've just returned it, and bought the draw-tite version for twice the price.. In fact I should have just went for the latter from the get... I got it to fit though, and If you're not equipped, or prepared to MAKE it fit... Don't take the chance. There are others. The chrome wasn't so great on mine either.. Rust is inevitably going to render it completely ugly soon enough.. I do see that others had no issues with fit. So you're rolling the dice apparently if you purchase this.. Good Luck!
B000BZN9J8|5|great price. as expected great quality. pair did not arrive together. but anticipated that through great communication from amazon.
B00TRFK644|4|It has been pretty great however the initial set up is extremely confusing as you do have to go through 3 different instruction manuals to get everything set up.
B005JV8ESU|5|This is the first racing helmet I've bought.  I got it for autocross and occasional track days.  It is comfortable and not overly heavy.  The modified design is perfect for a closed cockpit car.  Highly recommended.
B00APOEJF8|5|Exactly as described
B00I5G8EAY|5|Great product
B00IX26VQ4|1|Got here an 6 of the bulbs were already burnt out tried to contact the selling an heard nothing in return, guess u get what u pay for I'm a highly reputable jeep enthusiast as well to what a shame
B00EP9BX6W|4|They fit perfectly.  Not too dificult to install with basic tools and look really good.  I did have to cut both of the rear support brackets off  because they were too long and hit the vehicles frame.  The reason that I did not give them 5 stars is that they were not packaged very well and were damaged upon delivery.  They did replace them and they arrived undamaged, even though the box was damaged and the content had nearly fallen out.  They are plenty strong for me to stand on at 230lbs.  Shipping was a little slow.
B0052G5NPE|5|Worked fine great price.
B00CQ7W41I|4|Great quality , great new look and feel for the Harley at a good price.

B001EAQTRI|5|Bought this for my car and it eliminated 100% of the high pitch static-type sound.<br /><br />I have a Toyota Camry that has a female auxiliary port to plug in a stereo male plug into.<br /><br />I listen to Pandora and have in the past, had a stereo cord that went from my phone to the auxiliary port.<br /><br />Worked great except I kept getting the noise when my phone was plugged in.<br /><br />Then I recently purchased a bluetooth device (1) which plugs into the port.<br /><br />This eliminated having to plug a cable into my phone. However, the bluetooth dongle was powered by my car so it had the noise too.<br /><br />I purchased this device, plugged my bluetooth into it, then plugged this device into the port: no noise!!<br /><br />Now when I get into the car, my Pandora starts right up on the car stereo with no issues!<br /><br />(1) This is a great product that I bought so I can listen to Pandora in my car.<br />SoundBot SB360 Bluetooth 4.0 Car Kit Hands-Free Wireless Talking & Music Streaming Dongle w/ 10W Dual Port 2.1A USB Charger + Magnetic Mounts + Built-in 3.5mm Aux Cable<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RH29CJO?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o05_s00

B00V4H30M8|5|Perfect replacement for my John Deere 425. Casing was just a hair longer and had to file down about 1/16 on the bottom block for the oil dipstick.
B00U6HL2X6|2|Did not fit Sent back
B004RDTTG2|5|Compared all over the internet and local auto stores back in April 2014, for my 2001 Lexus LS430, but found a better price here! I remember installing them incorrectly...my mistake...but they have worked great since purchase! Forgot to write a a review, but just as well, now I have had time to test them out many times. You can't go wrong with this brand, in fact if I remember correctly, the local auto stores carried them but at a much higher price. Good luck!
B00B8X58SW|5|Awesome
B00JGP8I1S|1|2012 Honda Accord, does not work unless you're 7 feet tall. I'm 5'9&#34; and this is way too short to work as a visor. It literally only covers like the first 6 inches of the top of your windshield. Do not buy.
B000C57WB8|1|I want to tell everyone that Moog makes great products but this says this product fits my 2003 GMC Sierra 1500 4wd but it does not. I should have verified on Moogs website before buying. Amazon says it fits but the proper part number is ES3493T. This is the second time I have bought parts for my truck and they don't fit. I could have bought the correct part on Amazon for $35 but I had to buy at Advanced Auto for $62
B00V5DI3FA|5|Good quality. Makes it easier to wash my car
B00GUUTGPY|5|Fits R170. No problems. Easy to install. Thank you.
B000CB42O2|5|Solid product. Can't go wrong with a Rancho.

B00FXI9N66|1|I received the item on time but there is not circuit and battery inside itself. It was not a good deal. I lost my money and my time.
B0010DZZSI|5|excelent  filter

B00KB47G9I|3|Tire pump sucks big time, Battery Charger is Awesome. ues it twice , started right up. but will not buy it again as a combo pack.
B004B61B34|5|Fit my 2015 JKU. Had to remove the bumper to install but that was no problem.
B0028JLFCI|5|This also will work on a 2014.<br />It's not identical but does work fine.
B004KM8MCW|1|Did not receive the same product as pictured. Received an all silver Cowboys logo with the word, &#34;Cowboys&#34; underneath.
B0039ZGPKC|5|Fit perfectly!
B00AFO749Q|5|Now we do not have to search for a tissue in the car. Sometimes my kids pull the tissues out a little to hard resulting in the snap coming off. But my kids are some what on the ruff side. Great buy
B000C7UQT6|5|Same as original and works great!
B00REJXVEW|5|Fits my 02 Dodge Ram sport perfectly. I've had it for a bout a month and am very happy with it.
B00FQRI98M|5|These three solenoids, a new filter and a couple of gallons of DEXRON III  (forget ATF+4) and a 277k mile AW4 shifts fine and is substantially quieter.....
B006WVCPQ8|5|I only installed it two days ago, but it is working fine with no unusual noise.  It was a perfect fit for a Santa Fe. It was a simple 15 minute repair.  Two screws holding the plastic cover under the glove box and three screws holding up the blower assembly.  Many of the poor reviews appear to be related to the Elantra installation.  I will post again if I run into any quality problems as we continue to use it...
B003U4D3PM|5|Use two in my truck as there are no other ways to mount a cupholder

B00LHT3G54|1|wrong fit/size for listed honda accord model, the image you see is not the same cut out that you will recieve
B0044B0Z06|5|I received it in good condition and fit properly.
B00GRSOJSS|2|Too slow and much too expensive for merely cleaning rust off metal. It's also very Impracticle . When you have to soak tools overnight in a $27 gallon of your product in order to remove rust those tools are probably out of spec already. $27 can buy several new tools.
B002GO7F7Y|5|Easy installation on my 2007 Honda Civic Coupe.<br />Etrailor has as simulator item and video installation on YouTube .<br />Awesome product and I hope the module holds up.
B000GQ6LF6|4|I recently bought a used Coleman camper (1986 Columbia).  I drive a 2006 Saturn Vue 4 cylinder, 5 speed std.  It can't tow anything over 1,500 ibs.  This camper was the only thing I found that weighed under that.  This hitch came two days before I expected it to arrive.  My son and I took a little more than an hour to install it. All the holes aligned perfectly.  The only thing that made it take so long to install was the supplied bolts.  The 1/2 inch bolts were too big.  Maybe they were for the V-6 Vue?  A quick trip to the hardware store for the 7/16 inch bolts that fit was the only time consuming task.  After installing the ball and light kit (that came that afternoon) we were towing that camper like pros.
B007XRBN68|1|If you purchase these, be sure you check the resistance before you install them.  Resistance was high (extremely high) in three out of five wires in the set I received.  I contacted NGK about it--they didn't seem to be in a hurry to find out why the three wires read high.<br /><br />On NGK's web-site it reads:  &#34;NGK wires have a lower resistance than conventional carbon core wires (8k ohm/meter vs. 16k ohm/meter). This comparison is important to remember when you consider that many manufacturers recommend wires be replaced when the resistance exceeds 20k ohm/meter. This does not leave much margin for wear when the wire may only meet original standards at the very early stages of its life.&#34;<br /><br />Until I read this, I never thought about checking a new set of spark plug wires right out of the box.  They look great, but that's about it.  If you do buy a set, put a meter on each wire before installing to be sure the resistance is within range.
B006GHFXX0|5|Matched perfectly and was easy to install in about three minutes. I wish BMW made fussy parts that held up better--I've never had a visor clip break into pieces before, but I was very happy to find this replacement part at such a reasonable price.
B004AGFSC0|5|These work and fit great. No problems with squeaks. Would recommend them.
B00GUD9IKO|5|This was a perfect OEM fit and came with the light bulb as well, which was unexpected.
B00211UR18|2|Just not enough suction for daily use. Okay for occasional use on the cars, but I'd hoped to mount this in the laundry room inside for daily quick clean ups around the house. Unfortunately it just doesn't have enough suction to really clean the floors and the bags are so small they require frequent changes.
B00FLFVEVI|5|When I first got the setup, the nozzle I received was different than what was pictured. What I had lasted just long enough for me to flush the system before it stopped working and sprayed line flush all over my driveway. I also had to go out and buy $10 worth of threaded connectors to adapt it to my compressor. Needless to say, I got on Amazon and just blasted the company. Jesse A advised that I should contact them for support, but I just blew that off. Huge mistake on my part - because when I did finally reach out to him (I got bored one day), he immediately offered to ship a replacement nozzle. He also volunteered that the kids have been updated to include the appropriate NPT fitting to adapt to common air compressor sizes. The replacement parts were FedEx'd and received within a week. Which is good, because I now need to replace my household air conditioner and - you guessed it - the lineset needs flushed.<br /><br />This is the mark of a good manufacturer - that they stand behind their product. No company which makes a poor product can afford to do this for long. Only a company committed to customer satisfaction and continuous improvement will step up like this.<br /><br />That being said - the replacement nozzle appears to be chemical resistant, as I've already used it to flush some components for a friends AC system with no problem. The adapter mated to my compressor perfectly, allowing me to get full pressure through the line. The sturdy construction on the hose, bottle and other assemblies means I'll be able to get a lot of use out of this product.

B002ANU68Q|5|used for school project
B00QQWSV6Q|5|Totally Satisfied
B00BLQB5QU|5|Great decal. Great size.
B0007RQXDE|5|I bought this specifically for a 2005 King Ranch F150 with aging leather.  It was perfectly priced, so I figured why not.  I am a fan of Mother's products, so I went with it.  After a few applications, my leather looks great.  It renewed the color, provided a nice, leathery vice chemical smell and went on easy.  Vice spraying it, I used light pressure to allow the &#34;gel&#34; like conditioner to be applied, so it acted like a paste.  The spray feature has an exceptionally wide arc and it got everywhere - just beware.  Great product!
B00Y1HTTWI|5|Excellent service and product at a great price.
B003ZSD1G4|5|It'll take much longer to rub through this stainless braided line!
B00FEAPYNE|4|works good quality is good
B00HTOB0NG|4|They look great and plugged right in to my ballast.
B00GRHSU5C|5|Love this!  It is perfect for my 2012 Jeep 4 door!
B005OUUSHQ|5|This meet expectations and was an easy repair for the 2001 Saturn LW200 compared to most other vehicle heater cores. Very pleased!
B007ICVF2K|5|It's a bit short for my LT1 trans am but with about a 6-8&#34; more pipe welded on it will fit nicely.
B000BO66XA|5|I ordered this so I can more properly fill up our bicycle tires, as my other tire gauge is more for car tires and does not go past 50psi. Where I needed a much higher reading for the bike tires. I had seen this same Slime tire gauge at the local auto part stores and just never could come to pay that price for a basic plastic housing tire gauge. If it was metal or stainless steel, then sure the higher price is justified. But once I found it on Amazon I was pleased at the price I saw. And now that I have used this Slime tire gauge for months, I am pleased with my purchase.<br /><br />The tire gauge is easy to use and easy to read and comes with some extra valve stem caps. Which is always handy being we all lose them from time to time. I would easily recommended this product to friends and family. The only improvement I can make on the product is to make the shaft metal instead of plastic. But that would also drive up the price. Pick one up today and keep it in your glove box when needed.<br /><br />We were not paid nor discounted in any way, shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others.

B00EGT9LN8|5|As good as oem part
B006LJ8N08|5|Delivered on time, easy to install and works flawlessly
B00GSUD0D0|5|Perfect fit on my 2015 Durango. Heavy mat construction should last a long time.
B001GJ3FIS|4|It pours a little out the out the bottom, when on the center setting.
B0016KG72I|5|Great
B00JLJK5BK|5|Great price worked like a charm
B00RB4GNWW|3|A great idea. Unfortunately, it's still too small for my F-150 windshield. When the top edge is pulled up to the top of my windshield, it leaves about 6 inches of windshield exposed at the bottom. And about 3 inches of the bottom of each side exposed. They need to offer a larger size for pickups. Also the wind shield wipers are not strong enough to hold the bottom of the cover in place in even a slight breeze. There is a spandex mirror strap on only one side. Needs one on both sides. I run an elastic bungee from each mirror across the lower windshield to hold it in place. I DO NOT recommend this product for any sort of ice or hail protection! It will work only once and then you'll have to replace it. Rain is equally questionable.
B005FJXPNA|5|They are stopping the car very very well. They look awesome also.
B00T8MBD6G|5|They look awesome..!! Easy to install...
B00P45JP8Y|5|These bars were a needed touch to my new colorado, they make it easier for my wife to get in and out safely.  The fit is superb and all of the attachment bolts, clip nuts wer included. They were very easy to install however, there are no instructions just a sheet that tells the installing dealer where to look for instructions. If you buy these and need instructions just search in the forums at Colorado Fans Dot Com. There are plenty of people who have installed them with pictures.
B004QQCEO4|1|This piece of junk would not seal and cost me the only can of r 12 I could find anywhere ,don't waste your money .
B0105Y4IUS|2|Belt logos look great. The door catches on the other hand looked and felt cheap. The letters peeled off while installing them and they did not align well to the shape of the handle. If you order, only order the seat belt logos. Don't waste your time and money on the Door catches.
B000CFVMH8|5|Fit great no problems.In my 2000 cherokee
B00JXS3BXI|5|All good
B0068ODC1Q|4|Good product, but didn't work
B00CST9BC4|4|A little sloppy on the shaft not bad
B000N9LQH4|5|Fast shipment and good price. This oil is already in my Volvo I/O.
B00BOEFEPC|3|Other than having to drill my own holes to hold the console piece and the base together.. It meets my needs.
B005MZUQFM|4|good quality, nice price
B0016533HU|3|still not sure its better on fuel but can feel more zip in the mid range
B0009X8LYK|5|Worked as advertised!
B00823FSRC|4|Overall this is a very good item.  The strap work leaves a little to be desired, as the boat often shifts and is then not aligned with the wheels.  If there was a small bar that ran along the base of the boat and allowed for a strap... along with another stap by the wheels, it would increase stability.<br /><br />However, using a strong bungee cord or a better strap system (i found using both is best) helps.<br /><br />otherwise, it is great to be able to cart our kayaks from our home a few blocks to the river.
B00YI3IGA6|5|Love it !
B0067ECOCU|5|This product went on as designed but as I have a 2010 Tacoma with the oil filter on the top , it was quite difficult to get the filter off then this one on , so great product , nice simple design , but the conventional strap wrench is almost impossible to remove or tighten with but I got it going , so number one -get the right tools and this product will keep you satisfied !
B0050DBO6G|5|Great
B00KE9GMEA|1|To small!!!!!
B000C53RXU|5|Work ND fit good on my 2wd 76 f100 rides smooth
B00H4HAD1S|5|Quality gasket, even though I ended up not using it.
B00TO2WEH2|5|Absolutely adorable! Exactly what I was looking for! Perfect fit for my car!
B0001EWLQG|3|The rivet screws that they pack with the product are of extremely poor design, I went and got the 3M tape that they use on a lot of other bug deflectors, which I then incorporated in this setup. The final was a much better adhesion to the hood.
B004BTOOXA|5|Perfect, seems to be better than OEM (thicker tip). When I was about to install it I realize that I also needed the plug that goes in front of it, so be sure you check it's there, you can buy here in amazon for a couple of bucks.
B000I2079E|5|Great stuff.  Quick ship.
B00JPOFYDK|5|Very much like oem!!
B00C5THYIK|5|Easy install. Works well.
B000827S0A|5|Perfect fit in our 2002 Jetta Sedan.  Look great and holding up well.
B000CEE62W|5|Extremely sturdy. Should last several years. Produces a very noticeable bump when car tire passes onto it. Will actually stop car if car is going slow enough. Much better than hanging a tennis ball from the garage rafter.
B001C97ZVA|5|Cheaper than in store. Worked perfect
B00BD4NLIK|5|Love it
B0024NM3S8|5|Very pleased.  Prefect fix and looks great.
B00IN5BXKA|5|Excellent for the price.  Would recommend.
B0047DDBJS|5|Easy install. Good fit. Brand name. Great price.
B00DJVNFDQ|5|Great for Raven tags
B00NUDZKWW|4|Serves its purpose
B000GTUMFI|5|Super east to attach to KTM bikes that do not have crossbar.
B004LEYIQ8|5|I have a 2011 Audi A4, 2.0 turbocharged 4 cylinder, with more than 25k miles.  Some Audi's burn a lot of oil, mine never did, but I did have the oil consumption test performed.  I was using the dealer's 5w-40 Castrol (if you are an Audi/VW owner, then you should be aware to use VW/Audi Spec 502.00 oil) and the stage 1 oil consumption test turned out 0.17 quart burned per 1k miles with the Castrol, which is very good and the gauge readout on the console showed &#34;1/3&#34; down from full (the full meter is 1 quart range, so when it's at the bottom of the guage, the engine is a quart low).  This test was in the course of 2,200 miles.  Now ever since my last oil change with the Motul 5w-40 Xcess, I have put over 3,500 miles on it so far and the gauge has not dropped a single bit.  I can say for sure that this Motul is by far a superior oil than the Audi dealer's Castrol 5w-40.  I can't say for Mobil-1 0w-40 Euro which I use in my other car, a VW Passat 3.6 VR6 and is also pretty good, but I can say with empiracle evidence, in my experience with the Audi A4 2.0T (B8) , that Motul is far better than the Castrol.  I was paying the Audi dealer around $70 for the oil change, which is very reasonable, but I'd rather do it myself now because I prefer to put in Motul.  The Motul by the way is VW/Audi spec oil 502.00.  I plan to drive to the 10k mile interval and send it in to Blackstone Labs for analysis just for ghits and shiggles.
B00DSO938A|5|love this cover and was delivered on time
B00843WMZG|5|Great mats, will order from this company again.
B000GTWGFW|5|Shipped fast, product was as advertised.
B001N0E16A|5|I got a complete set of these for a VW Passat Wagon. They firmly snapped on the wheels and look very good.<br />Twice I took them off to wash and wipe and get the unsightly brake dust off them. Just used lukewarm water. They went back to looking like new again.
B001HKZHIW|4|It keeps blowing the fuse if working.
B00849PASG|1|Does not fit. ..said it fits the 2012 R1.... it does not.  Do not purchase.
B007KFMJ8Y|5|Perfectly fits 2010 rav4 v6; the kit came with all the needed parts except for the metal hook on the front brake pads that attaches to the brake bracket
B000C23DS2|5|5+ stars i would buy again
B001ABMQIM|5|Works well, no problems, haven't cleaned yet, no complaints.
B00LLLAKTS|4|I really enjoy this product the only snag was it didn't come with the adapter for a bigger bar, but once I bent the bar it went together easily and it runs great!!
B00DJBPN8G|5|2010 Subaru Legacy 2.5GT (5th Gen)<br /><br />SPC designed this to look OEM, it's high quality stuff. If you're too low, it comes with toe adjusters to increase toe range. Within 1.5&#34; drop you don't need it. Don't buy Megans or other cheaply made control arms and there's a lot of those on eBay, this is the one to get.
B00CLUYFNA|4|Fits GM truck and easy to install
B0051D3MP6|5|A great trickle charger, solid construction.
B000A0CAJE|5|No complaints!
B00Q4DX0SQ|4|Ok
B00MIDV90C|4|initially, I wasn't to sure about this bumper, but I'm impressed. It was relatively easy to install and good quality.
B00493S6CS|5|Excellent part! Fit my 2008 Colorado prefectly. 20 second install!
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Very pleased
B001W9OP86|5|I put them on and the inside of my car turned new and clean.
B000F5ECRM|5|This worked great
B001PWFPRU|3|Installed on  RAM 1500, followed directions completely. The gate free falls for first third of travel which was surprising. I found that the ball connection on the tailgate portion had started to bend at the neck.
B00IABG9YC|5|This was a prefect fit to replace the broken brittle original A/C cover on my camper.  The only minor issue was on the rear corners on the backside of the new cover it did not have two holes for the screws.
B00FRHODI6|5|Good product
B00062ZLZG|5|Excellent product.
B001445IZ8|4|I bought this because a have a 2003 BMW Z4 that is a little difficult to change the oil on. This car is very low, too low for my Rhino Ramps. To change the oil I had to jack the car up and then put it on the ramps or stands. It was doable but kind of a pain. I thought this would be much easier, particularly since the BMW's has the oil filter on the top at the front of the engine so there is no need to access it from below.<br /><br />Just tried this Topsider MVP for the first time and it worked great. No problem setting it up. The hose fits in the dipstick tube just fine and it is easy to feel when it has bottomed out. I pumped 20 times, released the clamp and the oil started coming out.<br /><br />I got impatient after about 10 minutes. The tube was still full of oil but couldn't tell if it was still sucking oil out. I pulled the tube out a bit and heard it sucking air. Tried clamping and pumping again but wasn't really getting much resistance on the pump and could not seem to get the oil to flow again. I emptied tank, tried again and everything worked normally. I let it go until is was sucking air. So seems like it does not work as well when there is some oil in the tank and therefore less air to create the vacuum.<br /><br />Overall this thing is great. Can't wait to use it on the other cars. It probably doesn't get out quite as much as pulling the drain plug but I put in 5 1/2 quarts which is what I used on my last oil change. And because it is so easy I will probably change oil more often.
B00DP4BH3M|5|You would need a meticulously trained eye to tell this from OEM. Fit like a charm.
B001DH0Q62|5|I watched a video on line on how to install this mirror. After I received it I had it on my truck complete in<br />45 minutes. Electric works as it should
B00KTIR1ZU|4|Worked as advertised. It cost me $70 to get both programmed.
B00MG9D1G8|5|Fit perfectly
B0021YZER2|5|My husband tried about three different cleaning agents before he ordered this for our glass shower doors. It took a lot of elbow grease, but was the best product he ever used on glass. It made them crystal clear. Now he can do windows!
B00H9K167A|4|Used this for mini split ac system installation.  Worked well all four times.  I like the 3 12s and 4 14s.<br />Cable real not the best as the one end came off on the first 20 feet.  needed a better glue.
B00EUIDPLO|5|Great!
B000BRF4AI|3|I replaced my old 30 amp plug with the Camco 55283 &#34;Mini&#34; plug.<br />The new plug was larger than my old plug, so did not fit into the existing wire hatch.<br />After installing this new hatch, and installing the new plug, I thought I was done.<br />Alas, the new plug is still too large. The lid had to be forced closed, with the plug pushing on the anti-vermin tabs.<br />On the road, the force is too much, and the lid will not stay closed. Flapping in the breeze it does no good.<br /><br />I will have to go in and break off the anti-vermin tabs, so I can close the lid firmly and not have it fly open.
B00KTJ7VK4|3|The trunk button is too sensitive
B007IKOX7Q|5|Fit the 19mm carburetor perfectly!
B000A6ZGU8|5|Mine has 1 broken fin, this is exactly as mine was originally. Includes screen.
B000X1G0R8|1|We bought the unit for a camping trip in August. When we opened the box at the campground, the unit was slightly dented on one side and we had a lot of difficulty getting it stay lit. However, we FINALLY figured out the the &#34;dial&#34; was broken but if we leaned a rock up against it to hold it in place then the unit would work. I had every intention of returning the unit as it was completely defective when received but missed the deadline to return by one week. Big giant waste of money.
B004LX3AS6|5|Works to maintain battery life is a great product. Would recommend to a friend.
B002IKWG4I|5|Great gloves! Very comfy and cool looking. Can't beat the price! You're hands will smell like new leather fire a while after riding but they are very nice. I definitely recommend this as right now. Well see after a season or two how they look/feel.
B00FT69H72|5|worked perfectly
B00EKJQ1EG|5|Great!
B00SZ70TP6|5|They fit.  Relatively easy to install.
B0068FV596|4|Serves the purpose.  Makes stand up riding much easier.  The caps and spacers aren't as wide as the ones on my bike, and one hole had to be enlarged slightly, and somewhat expensive for what you get, but work well.  The black finish seems good and match my bike parts.
B000KL115W|1|Nope. Not what I wanted.  I had best buy install the stereo for me.
B001PV1UK2|5|Fast & Great!
B00029WYBM|5|This will take care of several recharges.
B000GG1IHC|4|`Fit great!
B00SF2S99E|5|works great
B0012WHBSO|5|I only have work privileges and I have 3 leaky tires. I bought this because I couldn't drive to tireman to get them fixed. It works perfectly and only take maybe a couple minutes to fill a REALLY low tire. I love this! I can also use it to blow up bike tires, sports balls, and more. I haven't used it for a camping mattress, but I think I can.
B001MOVR8W|5|Good fit work well
B00GHT6U3Y|4|Arrived faster than scheduled ..install required an 8 mm socket wrench an extension ..<br />Took about 15-2o mins to complete.<br /><br />Ps dealer was going to charge $ 130 +just for the part ....<br /><br />Very happy with results
B00GZLMEPM|5|Used on 2007 Toyota Sequoia and 2009 Hyundai Sonata.  Both vehicles had some fading.  Figures I would get to it before it got to ugly.  Headlights are restored to new car finish.  My neighbors were raving about the appearance.  One neighbor went right out and purchased the kit for his car.  One review stated no micro fiber towel.  I used an old bath towel. Worked for me.
B009RC2HVC|5|thanks
B001FEZDVQ|5|Shipped fast, perfect fit/ function, items as described. A++
B003CJQRDU|5|Great product! Pattern is on both sides and it's a soft material, unlike most other bandanas you'd find out there.
B0091OE6II|5|So far so good. I have been using it for a month and it works for me.  Only open the back clip far enough to slip it on your seatbelt when first putting it on.  Then you won't have a problem with it breaking like some people are saying.
B00ARJP6QM|3|It worked great during it's time while under Warranty for about 90 days.  after about the 100th day I encounter the same problem again.  I was able to pass inspection while it was on my car so it did helped me but did not last long.  Had to get one from the Junk Yard cause this MAF is about 350$  and the one from the Junk Yard fixed the problem again.<br /><br />Pros:  1.  You get what you pay for,<br />  2.  Short life span.<br />  3.  Good Customer Service (Called in cause this one had 1 extra prong and was explained why it will work with it)<br />Cons:  1.  No Cons,  I work in the Auto Parts industry and I know that parts fails no Matter what kind of car you own.
B00W2XEMT8|5|fit well
B00DQU9Z3Y|2|THIS WAS MY SECOND ORDER AS I RETURNED THE FIRST OXGORD CAR COVER BECAUSE IT WAS EXCESSIVELY LARGE SIZE / XL. WELL, THE REPLACEMENT WAS ALSO AN XL COVER BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT BRAND AND QUALITY. I PREFER THE FIRST CAR COVER QUALITY AS THE SECOND ONE IN MY OPPINION WAS A SLIGHT BIT SMALLER BUT IT ALSO IS ON THE GROUND ON BOTH SIDES.<br />I'LL KEEP THE SECOND COVER AS I'M JUST TIRED OF FIGHTING. NEXT TIME I'LL ORDER AN EXACT 1972 MUSTANG MARC 1 QUALITY CAR COVER.
B001C9ZZHQ|5|It was just what was described and I would purchase from them again
B0002MBC08|3|its nice, but my mistake in not looking at the dimensions. I saw garage mat as part of its use and assumed that it was bigger like a  door mat. It is a tiny mat for the rear seat in a car.
B000CKXWVW|5|The ride is smooth and tight. Great for the price. Went into my 1991 325is.
B00ANZW28U|3|not very strong keeps falling down
B00FLH4MJC|5|My daughter told me that it was the best gift ever!!! Helped her get to her way to classes with less hassle of snow & ice removal - she only had to worry about shoveling snow.
B00030AV3I|1|Really doesn't do anything like I hoped for don't waste your $
B000FQ1Q4S|5|what it is
B0042HU3GS|5|Work very well east to apply
B000GOHUS0|5|Just what i needed at the best price.
B001H1JJB2|3|This replacement part works absolutely fine.  I am giving it three stars as this is the exact model on my gas jug that broke with only two years of use.
B0084BJGFW|1|Poor quality Chinese junk.  Buy quality coil packs U.S.A . You'll save money in the end.
B00GYTEDRW|3|correct fit for our pos 2013 mazda 3 base.  however, this thing ate my lunch.  the problem is that it dont stay up.  the filters are installed only 1 way, the first is inserted, then slides up, and the second slides in underneath.  but the first one wouldnt stay up.  i finally used some 2 sided sticky tape on the first, and it held it in position while the second one slid right in.  stupid mazda.  what a dumb design.  the later models have the filter in the glovebox area, really easy to change.  we are looking forward to the day the lease is up on this pile, and we can get a car that has a/c that actually cools
B002OPXD58|3|very quit
B00K87WH8I|1|Price was great but when I tried to adjust the carburetor after installing it one of the adjustment screws broke in half just trying to loosen it !!!! Quality Chinese made product !
B001UP0ENM|5|No fitment issues, product fit perfectly. I recommend this Beck-Arnley ignition key/cylinder replacement.
B001V8U12M|5|Works great
B00F3I9IPM|5|Great thanks!
B002GTKAHQ|4|I love these mirrors. I put them on my cafe racer project bike. I wasn't crazy about the way they are installed they take a little more work than you think they would and they take a little fine tuning  get them to stay adjusted to your preference and size of rider. Over all, after I installed them they gave my bike as leak good look.
B00PCRUX4Y|5|Nice solid cvt cover for my gy6. I cut some parts out and painted it red. Fit perfectly, didn't use a gasket I don't think it's necessary. BTW, this cvt cover takes the shorter version of the kickstart starter gear.
B000GV8THE|5|Works well. Only draw back is changing oil. Gets all over the skid plate.
B001RAQGXC|5|This product worked very well, but it is not a &#34;quick&#34; process.  You cannot expect scratches to just disappear after a few minutes of polishing.  I had a total of 6 scratches in my windshield due to a wiper blade issue.  (I bought the vehicle used with the scratches so I do not know exactly what caused them.) Two scratches were 20&#34; long, two were 12&#34; long, and the other two were 5-6&#34; long.  The long scratches were the deepest.<br /><br />If the polish splatters on the paint (very likely), it does come off fairly easily with water.  However, I covered my hood and roof with old sheets, draping them over the side windows, mirrors and the fenders.  I used 1/4&#34; green painter's tape to mark the scratches on the inside of the windshield to make them easier to see on the outside as you progress through the polishing.<br /><br />Follow the instructions!  Have a spray bottle of water and use it frequently.  After 30 seconds or so of polishing, the glass will be warm - the heat generated is part of the process, but you do not want the glass to get too hot.  Wet the glass with the spray bottle, and as soon as it cools a bit, go back to polishing.  With the applicator pad damp from the water, you do not need to keep adding polish as the pad will become saturated (same principle as polishing/waxing a vehicle).  I spent approx. 2 hours polishing the 6 scratches, and approx. half a bottle of product until I was satisfied with the results.<br /><br />Did the deep scratches totally disappear?  No.  I can find them, but I have to look real hard, and can only find them at a certain angle.  If I asked someone, &#34;Are there any scratches in this windshield?&#34;  They would likely say, &#34;No&#34;.  If I pointed them out, they may see them, but they may not.  I would describe the result as a &#34;polished, slight groove&#34;.<br /><br />Tips:<br />** Using water also helps with lubricating the pad to rotate smoothly (less friction).<br />** Hold the drill  / polishing pad on a slight angle to the glass surface.  It is very difficult to hold the polishing pad perpendicular / flat against the glass and have control of the areas to polish.<br />** If you have multiple scratches to polish out, spend a few minutes on one, move to next one and polish, etc., and keep repeating the polishing cycle.  This will allow the glass to cool in a specific area, decreasing the amount of overall time spent.
B0038AVA2G|5|Nice right rear light and brake LEDs. It's a shame that all the lights are not LED but this is s nice updated look on my classic Millenium Silver Metallic truck.
B007MAZ0CY|2|It's well built and I like that it's made in the U.S.  Unfortunately I wish I had bought a different one. The shock extenders are too narrow to go over the control arm and the rear lift blocks are flat. A lot of the other brands have tapered blocks to maintain the pinion angle. It was surprising that it was a little more than the rest and to have these issues. I didn't mind paying $30 more for a product made in the U.S. But I wouldn't suggest buying it. The extra couple hours fixing the shock extenders makes it irritating.
B00HNKYD0I|1|The quality's so bad. The glue did stick anymore
B00CMTRKH8|5|Fit my 2011 Cadillac SRX perfectly after installing a Curt 13002 Class III receiver hitch.  Product is more costly than it should be, but it is worth it.  90% of the time, we do not use our hitch-mounted bike rack.  This cover keeps the sleek look of the SRX instead of having the visually displeasing receiver hitch showing.
B003YNB2W0|4|Good
B0053O9EUA|5|It's all I use in my CVO.
B000UOE1YM|5|Belt will fit 2010 Mazda 3, I-4, 2.0 with idler tensioner.  Will need to buy a belt remover/installer since AC compressor belt is in the way.
B00REDE3D6|4|For the price this stuff was GREAT. A little tricky with ad-hearing to curves, but my dash turned out pretty nice. :)
B00YI3IGA6|5|Great product! Keeps the sun out but still able to see fairly well. It fit the length of my rear doors of my Honda Pilot well but is about 1-2 inches too short...not a big deal, but just wanted to include it in my review (for the record: the Honda Pilot rear doors are large at 19&#34; from base of window to top of door frame and 39&#34; from side to side of door frame).
B00EBQAW84|5|Much better than the dealers and received quickly.
B00BHH1QT4|5|Shipping was on time. Great product!
B00ELASYIA|5|Works great!
B005ZHRNOE|4|Somewhat flimsy but works great and fits perfectly!
B00842R5M2|5|Excellent cover! Fit perfectly, even with a custom grill guard on my SUV.

B00C1A46CU|4|Thank you
B00657FZO8|2|The backside of the emblem is hollow so the double sided tape only has the thin edge of the emblem to grab, so most likely will not stay on for long.
B00AR1503Y|5|Excellent fast service delivery. Plate is super cute. Luv it. Baught  a second plate from this seller, same service. Definitely recommend this seller. Thank you!
B002MB7QDY|3|Great stopping power but when the warmer weather comes they squeal like crazy
B005EPLJ9W|4|When I bought my car the buttons were broken, now they finally work....it was easy I fix
B001LHVOVK|2|A bit disappointed as this gadget came up with Link Error when plugged into my BMW Z4 (2005 model so should be compliant with it) - which was the car I bought it in mind with......I only want to find out which of my six cylinders needs a new coil pack!
B005TMIKYM|5|Perfect fit great quality
B003R2PYUY|3|car covers, are alright, fabric used to make these is very susceptible to lint and anything else that want to cling to them, wouldn't recommend them.
B008PWN6SS|4|It was exactly as we expected.  We were pleased.
B0012Q4H96|5|denso quality no problem
B001PYG9GO|4|Perfect kit cold not find at part store
B00I8OESOY|3|It's cool and all but it moves around while driving
B000BRV5WY|4|Royal purple seems to be an above average lubricant. My only complaint is I used this in my mowers (commercial usage) and as you may know. This oil is purple making it hard to tell if there is dirt in the oil therefore making it hard to tell if you need to change your oil early. I would definitely use this in my vehicles though.
B00650NY6G|5|works absolutely great.
B004SS6EMI|4|It fits great BMW318i
B00HVJ899C|5|Used the Comfrmax on cross country trip FL to CA and back and had no discomfort.  Prior to that trip I drive from FL to PA and had pain for 2 days and was laid up in pain.
B000CGDDD8|5|Fits perfectly on a 1995 S10 4.3L, W engine.  Looks similar to the original part and fits great.  Has two new screws too.
B0073T4AAW|5|Keeps my Yeti in place while traveling and secure
B001O1O9YW|5|I own a 2009 Honda Fit and these fit perfectly, are durable, and look very nice. The passenger side shifts a little but nothing I can't live with.
B000I6I97W|5|Great
B00HR26X6O|5|these lights work great.
B0054JVMBI|5|This is a direct replacement for the OEM part. It will fit and function as the original part had.
B0048FXOOM|3|Didn't have center speaker cut out
B0051D3MP6|1|poor service because one of the two products did not work and can not return?
B00DDVU6EI|5|Works well. Used this product in addition to replacing the spark plugs and installing a new air filter and mileage has improved back to the car's old self. From 400 miles/tank to 510. No check engine light on this finicky car.
B00M1URMZ8|5|After calling around to Jeep dealers about putting remote entry for our new jeep and being told it can't be done, how wrong they were as this product got installed and works great.  I bought 2, one for our jeep and one for my granddaughters car.  So far no flaws.
B0076GTPES|5|No problem with this product.
B0026MCPF8|4|worked perfect fit like a glove
B000C5WD08|5|It fixed the p1135 and the check engine turn off after 10 miles of driving.
B009DJWA3O|5|The Trim was nicer than the stock. Couldn't be any happier. .. AAAAA+++++
B00M42CEG0|5|So far so good. Product arrived in about 4 days from ordering and took about an 1 1/2 to install. I'm very happy with the way they look on my truck and have had no problem with them.
B000VU98HK|5|Nice box, mounted it on the tongue of my trailer.
B00HLUPOV2|5|Love them! Smooth and durable. The blue looks just the want it does in the preview pictures.
B0055F50UU|5|Not much to say.  Worked great and fit right into the etrack plates
B004QKLSO2|5|Heavy duty
B004VP5UKA|5|Looks great on the back end of my hitch
B00Q7HV6NA|1|The product that I bought was to fit A Nissan Titan the lights do not fit covers the notch for access to my spare tire Very disappointed with the lights. Very wrong when you said it fits Nissan Titan!!<br /><br />  Carmine Marino
B00G93DA6I|5|Great windshield, fits great and easy to install.
B009NHVXNE|5|Great product
B00QSNZRR4|1|The piece that holds the knife and saw inside the handle broke the first time it was pulled it out. While I knew this was not an expensively made item, I did not expect it to break that fast. Would not recommend to anyone who actually wants to use it for anything say, like in the event of an emergency and especially not to give to a 10 year old as a birthday gift. Poorly made.
B00K9BDFMU|5|Support the NRA!
B00VY6ROE4|5|I was afraid at first because of the price tag but i was very pleased once i installed the seat covers looks great in my car i have been getting many compliments from riders i uber from time to time.
B004ZF3A94|5|Take some time to install. But, it was worth the time. They are AWESOME! Received many compliments on the light.
B004C6B9FS|5|Perfect OEM product. Installed with no hassle and no leaks. I would buy this again and again. Be sure it is the right part for your TOYOTA and you shouldn't have any problems.
B00KTHWGQA|3|ok
B00OPEFKBQ|2|After installing the lights, it really looked great - right up to the time the some LEDs failed.  Some of the LEDs failed just four weeks after installation.<br /><br />So far I have had very good customer service through Amazon.  I elected to get a replacement and see what happens.
B000IEZEJ0|1|Using the Amazon tool to verify whether this product fits my vehicle identified that it did. I believe the seller inputs the information. However the Auto Ventshade I recieved will not fit.
B00B0Q60C0|5|Perfect fit for 2004 Honda accord 4cyl
B00Q58HJ5K|5|As advertised
B00PQWN5DQ|4|Easy to hold and take a reading.  Being able to register the pressure and bring the gauge up to read is very handy.<br />Dial gauge a little difficult to read. Larger numbers and pressure mark (larger dial face) would help.<br />I would have ordered the 60psi gauge, but I inflate my travel trailer and tow vehicle tires are inflated above its limit.
B001Q6IK90|4|The rubber tray on mine was black. Probably better for stains, but still different than the pictuee and original.
B0077465TC|5|Very satisfied with product and provider
B002BG4WX2|5|It worked! Stopped my ac leak! Put it in about 6 months ago and I haven't had to add refrigerant once!
B008CL49P6|5|Great find
B00SJTDDYY|5|Its a good product i love it
B000CPAEJA|5|I rebuilt the  front end of my superduty and this is what i used. I am super impressed. This will be all i will be using from now on wards.
B00X9NUUQO|5|just What I needed.
B002E3FXB2|5|Fit well does good job.
B00C8EA6W8|4|it was a great fit no problems with it
B00WM36XNG|5|Highly recommend.  This is a large leak proof trash bag that work great in my car!  Great product
B000CODEQQ|5|one of KYB strut was bent, so this was a good price to go with.
B00TF8G110|5|I like my seat cover
B001AD6T24|5|Very good quality. Very versatile for its size. Lot of options for attaching to the bike.
B007NNHJEW|4|It works
B001CL9XZ4|5|as expected
B00E9W2PPS|5|great stuff to use on my a/c .Really cool
B00AWDKB2W|5|NO COMMENT
B003U90IDM|2|I was happy with the fit & sound but after 11/2 the tile pipes rotted out where the rear hanger was welded on, the right side hanger is broke off & there is a hole in the pipe, No fixing it. my advise would be to send a little more now on stainless!
B00JBIBXH6|5|Good
B001VXXUWK|5|works great
B00VR6ZXR6|5|It's a tag brackcet, it fits. It's just what I expected. Seamless transaction.
B0099T1SPE|5|Bright and work well
B00ID2P60Q|5|Worked awesome!!
B00V56U28I|5|Great Product,have one in our car & another in our truck results are excellent,Thank you
B000EFZOJI|5|Nice product, would buy from here again
B0002JMDAE|5|Use this about once per week on leather interior. Once it dries, no oily residue. Makes leather soft
B00C2TNOSM|1|This picture shows a fury seat. Not a tank cover!
B00IPZE3GE|5|Great Orem item
B00FV130EQ|4|My husband loves it!
B0013935FY|5|Easy to install, looks nice also
B00CEX4UMU|3|one of the covers was missing the adhesive tape for install.
B00651CLCS|3|Easy to install and looks good. The reception is not great.
B000F1180A|5|Looks good in the car...looks so much better than the dash looked before we put the mad in..
B0011O0YDW|5|husband loves these in the garage
B00FC22HUM|5|Serious lights...im lighting up dark roads in NJ
B00F2IEGLY|4|This is a good product for the cost. Had to grind a bit to make it fit but I completely expected to considering the price. Shipping was fast too.
B00A4O9K6W|1|Not a good tire had flat first day
B0006VORDY|5|It's a Camp Chef. That means it's good quality. We've used it for camping and canning. Works great. Easy to put up and take down. Packs up nicely in a small carrying case. No complaints.
B006B2XXIM|5|good stuff fits perfectly
B0081SC1Z0|5|A+
B001EAQTRI|5|Despite the neg reviews for this thing, I purchased anyway to hopefully get rid of the terrible hum/alternator noise when using my Galaxy Note on my Aux In (while powered). I have tried other inline ground loop isolaters with no luck. Figured if it didn't work I'd just return since this is prime.<br /><br />I am happy to report that it completely gets rid of the noise with no noticeable degradation in the sound (including sub bass, I have a 15&#34; sub and there is plenty of bass with this thing plugged inline).<br /><br />So, maybe it's that it only works with certain grounding/phase problems, and I am just lucky that it worked on my car/device. I would say, try one, on prime and return if it doesn't work!
B00D2HTIIS|4|Works correctly, no issues.
B0006JJ588|5|item was as expected
B0040DUCGA|5|I don't like concave mirrors so I bought this one. Installation isn't that easy but once it's there it's just magic. It completely removed my blind spot on the right side. Only thing that bothers me is the logo.
B00E0CZRGQ|5|Shipped quickly.  Fit well.
B0012TWJZ2|5|Received item very quick it works well
B00E1ETJNU|5|Fit my Honda Ridgeline perfectly
B00OZ6SIN6|5|This little thing stopped my car's enging oil leaking at ones. Amazing!
B000WJCV24|5|Fit my 2009 KX100 throttle cam housing perfectly.
B00QAC5CW8|1|dose not fit . has no provision for steering dampener mount . has no provision for control locator dimples
B000EDUTX6|5|Looks good. Helps keep the noise down and adds much needed work space
B009AQS4IU|5|I bought two of these, one for the front and back. I have a green Camry and had some touch up paint, so I painted the leaves green. They came out really nice and I get so many compliments!
B004RCSMZW|5|Very nice device. Worked as expected
B0016GRTVU|5|3 winters later and it's still in use. so i guess it lasts
B00LEBLI82|3|Bulbs are a nice bright white and are a good fitting replace for the bulbs in my Ice Castle fish house. The first one I put in worked until I turn it off and then didn't work after I turned it back on. Haven't had a chance to replace the other bulbs but hope this was just a fluke and not a common issue.
B00T6JOS4K|5|Great product.
B001CZODH8|4|as has been said my bmw x3 with 122,000 did gain 2 mpg after using this so I am a believer.
B00W4XIK6C|1|Such a cheap investment to show the world my pride in my nephew. Absolutely disappointed. The words are smeared. The whole decal including the words are not even lined up right on it. I was expecting a clear coat or something on top, but there is nothing. Just an expensive piece of junk sticker to go in the garbage.
B0006IX7Y2|5|Works great!
B0072AXR5Q|4|Everything fine, nice & useful as expected & good delivery service...
B00NJRGD70|5|I ordered the car size shade for my Cadillac ATS. It's bigger than other shade of it's type which allowed me to position up against the windshield beyond the car frame. The large size creates a spring effect which holds it in place and completely blocks the sun... and without the need to support it with the sun visors.  Great product!!!
B00NQCTSLQ|5|Good
B008N6K36O|5|It is what it says. Looks good on my car and has stayed on. Show your accomplishments with this.
B0052UDMY4|5|Work seamlessly after programming it.  Used the instructions included and was done in 3 minutes.
B007PXOL3C|5|Excellent product, fast shipping. Just what I expected. Totally recommended.
B005EPLJ9W|5|Purchase for my son's 01 Jetta.  Easy to install.
B00JSJMV38|4|Quality is ok, good fit (rav4-14.5in). Smell is too strong...
B00265M9SS|3|After watching multiple videos demonstrating its use and following step-by-step instructions  to the letter, I was not able to get this contraption to work the way it's supposed to.
B000C9SNFI|3|they arrived just tossed in a box not one plug made it in its individual packaged but appear good
B007I6REZI|5|genuine honda! might as well save a few bucks and have it brought to your door!
B00X04JRMU|5|This is one of the best products I have ever cleaned my car with, thank you
B00QHZV7IQ|3|Camera has a lot of lag. Still better than getting in and out to see where your at.
B00N15KHVI|5|Perfect
B00T7GYDTC|5|I love this led light the size is perfect for mounting on a ATV. With the combo beam pattern I highly recommend this for anyone looking to add some great lighting to their ATV. The light is well built and I would buy it again to add to any ATV.
B000GD5FMY|3|They seem to work reasonably well, but the material that they are made of feels flimsy. While cleaning off the lenses i could move the lens in the sockets. They were very loose.
B00UBIMAV8|5|Very good product
B005C1Y4Z4|5|Very satisfied with seller contact and item.
B000GU587Y|4|If you intend on using this cover a long time, it should primarily be used indoors or in a covered structure like a carport. I used it primarily as an outdoor cover (which the description says it's not meant for) and it developed tears after about 10 months.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Lightweight<br />- Dries quickly if wet<br />- Has pocket to fold into for storage (great for trips!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Material isn't quite waterproof. Your bike will still get a little wet in the rain, but not soaked.
B00FYDAP6M|2|I have had this for about 18 months and the last 12 it has been plugged into a 115 volt line for my RV. I just removed it today and the rubber around the connection to the extension cord had melted at some point and &#34;Glued&#34; the connections together. With great difficulty I finally got it &#34;Cut&#34; apart. There hasn't been much usage for the 115V into my RV this past year although early thus summer I did run the air conditioner for an hour or so two or three times. The extension cord is a top brand item and the location of the &#34;Melt&#34; is visually in this dogbone adapters side of the connection. I like the features of this but with this quality I'll have to buy another brand to replace it I guess.
B000C7ZCHM|1|only lasted a month, Headlights started shutting off after every bump. had to wiggle the switch on and off just to try to get home
B00G0KRHKK|5|Febreeze alwaus,have great scents for the home and car.
B0024NSWEM|5|Pretty amazing. Arrived in beautiful shape and was impressed with the quality. They feel like they are made of quality glass, while my old OEM ones feel like they were plastic.. Installed them in the shade on a Saturday afternoon, and timed myself: 90 minutes. Found a video on You Tube and just followed along. It's a little misleading to say that you have to remove the bumper -- you don't. You do have to remove the big piece of plastic that covers the bumper, that's it. Only tools required are a flat head screwdriver for popping fasteners, an 8mm socket with extension, a 10 mm socket and some WD-40 to spray on the bolts to help loosen them up. Mine came with lamps in the headlights, but not the driving lights or the turn signals -- so you have to bring those over from your old lights -- bulb and receptacle (twist and pull to remove). I did get stuck trying to remove the wiring from the turn signal and driving lights -- hint: squeeze and pull.
B00CFALFXY|5|These cloths are the best you can buy.  Excellent for dusting, cleaning glass top ranges, etc.  very good quality!
B00O7TXHBO|5|Arrived quickly.  Drive vehicle for 15 minutes after installation at highway speeds and light went out. Light has not turned on anymore. Plus I have an extra.
B002MAJ5GG|5|I recently bought a new-to-me used van and wanted to personalize it.  One of the first things I did was buy this bumper sticker.  It's a favorite of mine.
B001O7PNNM|5|best value on any compound, works great with DA.  Easy to remove.
B0007XXTVC|5|ORDER 2
B000B8JUNY|5|I had code P0455 on a 2007 Volvo XC90.  I checked the gas cap gasket:  it was coming apart,  so I bought this cap.  It fit.  Great quality.<br /><br />My spouse, however, did not want to lose the convenience of the retaining strap found on the OEM gas cap.  So, I replaced the worn out gasket on the OEM gas cap with the gasket one from this new cap.<br /><br />One tip:  It is easy to remove and install the gasket by gently twisting it along the threads of the gas cap.  In this way there is little risk of stretching or damaging the new gasket.<br /><br />Apparently it is possible to buy a replacement gasket (search the Volvo blogs for reference to IPD) but they were out of stock.  Buy why bother?  Slant has a good reputation for quality and the gasket they use may be better.
B005J6JRMM|3|Can't use well for 2004 Mini as it is slightly different configuration.  Had to get the file out to make it fit.
B0012ETJ1O|1|The bulb got stuck in my Harleys FXDC housing, had to be pried out and broke the bulb.
B005VF7M00|1|These are junk,  maybe i just got a bad set, but i have tried for the last year to get them to work consistently, i didn't mess with the factory setpoint, tried then in my garage and in 15 minutes i had 4 flat tires,  aired back up, set the deflators to 20psi, put them back on and in 15 minutes i had 4 flat tires.  I have tried taking them apart and cleaning per the instructions, didn't help, i have tried them on atv tires, my jeep and even bicycle tires, result is always the same.  4 flat tires. I have spent the last year trying to get them adjusted,  total waste of money, if you screw them on to far they don't let air out at all, you realky have to fiddle to get them to let air out, than they don't stop at 20 psi, or even 5psi, they just let all the air out.
B000FQ0AI6|5|Great product
B00BHH1QT4|5|makes a big difference if you have to use a spray paint can.  much more control
B000IYNTWY|4|This fit perfectly, and was shipped in a very protected manner. Replacing the rad was the easiest car maintenance or replacement I've done to date. Only gave it 4 stars because it's only been installed for a few weeks, and I can't say how it holds up, but so far so good.
B00J8QVQ7S|5|Expensive wheel brushes, but better then others listed for sale on Amazon. I had one previously, but over time the bristles lose their ability to hold up and the rubber protective tip fell off. That alone caused some scratches on the wheels, which is why I bought another brush. Be careful and inspect the rubber tip before each use. My first brush lasted over 2 years with hundreds of washes.
B000EGMGBG|5|Awesome bed cover!
B006RLIAI0|2|These appear well made, however I did have problems with the drivers side.  The connector for the wire harness was molded poorly and needed trimming and some help with a screwdriver to lock into place, then the turn signal did not work, opened the cover and found the connector was off the back of the bulb mount which had the two end pins pushed in too far.  I removed the mount with bulb then removed the bulb and the pins fell out.  I just used the mount from the old unit and it worked fine.  Very poor connectors, expect issues when changing bulbs!
B00480J4QY|5|Nice and bright.
B00KLKV026|5|Works great. Just like the original.
B00SD4EKS8|3|This didn't exactly fit my 2005 Landcruiser.  Installed in one direction the clips don't catch the metal and it falls out.  Installed the other way it won't fit in the opening.  A little glue works to hold it in and the electrical connector is right so all is good.  For now.
B000COMX3Q|5|great locks
B0082365AQ|4|Great for the $$.  It works and is cheaper than anything else out there.  That being said I have a few notes. (I'd have given this cart 5 stars if it hadn't been for #'s 2 and 3 below!)<br />1. The tires REALLY DO STINK when you first unpack this thing.  Do not do it in your house.  Once they are out of the package for a couple of days though, there's really no issue anymore.<br />2. The strap stinks and there are no instructions.  Grab your own tie down strap.<br />3. The wheels attach with quick release pins.  If you put the wheels on the way you'd expect to (valve stems out) then the pins will hit the valve stems each time the wheels rotate.  This will destroy the valve stem caps and probably eventually the stems.  It also makes a really annoying noise.  The fix is to just attach the wheels with the valve stems pointing in.  This seems wrong, but since you can remove the wheels by simply pulling the pin, filling them with air when needed is really no issue. (again, something that could have been explained in the instructions...if there had been any.)
B0002X7T5Y|1|Not good
B00FC221PI|5|Delivery was fast and packaged well. I fitted these on my gtr and I'm really satisfied with the product.
B0031ZDU62|4|Great value
B005BIAP4M|5|workes and looks great
B009XQ5VZQ|5|Perfect fit - no issues
B00LCDM8HM|1|Fit nice, but doesn't hold well.
B006B7Z6NW|5|Noticed increase in horsepower immediately
B00IAB4728|4|Perfect size!  Also easy to apply, but take your time.
B0015PI73Q|5|Excellent tool. Seemed a little pricey for one tool, but it is specialty and it does work well. I had a rounded/stripped lug nut and couldn't get a grip on it, this thing had no problem whatsoever. Very heavy, sturdy tool. In the right applications it's perfect.  A 1/2&#34; drive extension is necessary for this.
B001AI56QO|1|I purchased a set of bags for my 750 shadow. The bags are sturdy looking but tore a hole in my seat wishing a few miles. Needless to say I was unhappy. I contacted Viking Bags to tell them why.  I didn't want a new seat. Just a longer bolt to allow the bag to sit farther away from the seat.  Well after a long run around they said your SOL and pound salt.  I let them know they should modify their kit for the shadow and they refused to talk to me or return the product. So now I am out $200 for a set of bags and who knows how much for a new seat. My bike isn't even 30 days old. I would not recommend this company for your bike solely on customer support. The bag is maybe not bad but def not worth destroying your bike seat.  Again this was custom for my bike. Not a one size fits all.  But at your own risk! I will try to load a picture later if I can.
B001W0FVH4|5|didn't need them but they ok
B000OUZV8W|5|For the price seem like a good little ports power
B0068ESBSK|5|Fit perfect for my 93 rm125. And showed up in time to do the repair before riding day. Package was a bit old looking, but the bearing kit was still clean and perfect. Great product overall. Felt the difference right away, since my old bearings were blown out. I would recommend, and will buy pivot works products in the future.
B000VKVXKA|3|Makes your car smell weird in the first month. Had to replace them unfortunately
B00H26TO2A|5|My wife loves it. It's shiny.
B00CBCPYOC|5|Great quality super fast shipping
B001O0FZ8W|5|good heavy steel boxes would tell everyone to get these boxed very durable
B0089T068U|3|I added these in the frequently bought together section. So i guess it's my fault they do not fit . They are quality bolts though and came fast.
B00CEK88DU|5|Fits good on my 2009 Honda CR-V
B00876Z40U|5|Beautiful thread work, color, and size. Looks great of my leather vest.
B00RX98L9I|5|nice new item and fast shipping
B000CN52TY|5|Just what was needed
B004I1F3AE|5|Just what we needed and at half the cost of the local parts store!  My husband had it installed within 15 minutes, maybe less.  Fit our Equinox perfectly!!
B000NW8EU8|5|Nice set up. Notable improvement.
B00SIHEK6M|5|Exactly what I was looking for! Quick and fast shipping. Couldn't have asked for more.
B003UXZ6RG|2|The website said it would fit a 2007 Hyundai Accent but it didn't. It was way too big. Luckily for my boyfriend, it fit his car (Hyundai sonata), so now he has a cover! It looks really nice and is comfortable. Just stinks for me, I have to keep looking.
B007Y4WYD6|5|Very good!
B00NUE545O|5|Was concerned about signal loss. Not the case with this unit. I travel about 8000 miles a month and this antenna holds signals very well. No more hitting the port a cache on my house which was the main reason I bought it
B001NNFZ2Q|5|Much easier than than toe plates and the old style gauge I was using

B00ELNGAU6|4|A bit pricey but great sound!
B009S2V45G|4|Control arms are very rugged and look good. The only downside is very soft bushings. I highly recommend getting high performance bushings for this or just simply replace the bushings.
B00HFWZ1NW|5|I bought these mats to go into my 04 Chevy Silverado SS, they fit perfect. I wanted to get floor mats before the winter hit and these was so on time. I can't thank you enough for allowing me the chance to review these mats at such a low cost Thank you.<br /><br />I received the product for a discounted price in exchange for an honest review.

B0074JVP2C|5|Works great
B000PA00XM|3|Make sure you check your radio to determine compatibility! Just because you have the plug, does not mean it will work with this!
B004BFW0EO|5|Have a black Challenger with real bad hard water spots. Done a lot of experimenting to rid my car of these. From everything from a buffer using a polishing compound, to more aggressive rubbing compound. (Bad water spots here). This stuff is the best I've found, for being easy and not requiring electrical equipment.<br />  First i minute that they recommend on the finish is not near enough. The best results I had, was to rub a layer on one half of what ever section I was working on. (started out 2 by 2 foot but got bigger as I experimented). And let it stand 3 minutes. Then using the same rag after 3 minutes rub the same area again and wait another 1 minute. Then used DRIVEN Quick Spray Concentrate to dilute and remove Eraser (a bought 3 times Expect to go through a lot of microfiber rags). Surface even after cleaning will have a film of eraser on it, it's ok. Next rub on a layer of DRIVEN Finish Restorer then have a couple drinks, let the arm heal. When dry buff out. Then apply your favorite wax. I haven't had the water spots back (which is what I really was looking for after all this work). I used you guessed it DRIVEN Automotive Polish. No I do not or am not affiliated with them in anyway. And now anytime I wash my car I first spray it with DRIVEN Quick Spray Concentrate, then dry it. Water spots nightmares are a thing of the past. (perfect).<br />  Hope this help anyone with the same nightmare.<br />I'm still not done but have the hood,roof, and trunk done. The rest will be easy not near as bad on the side of the car.. Probably get away with the polishing compound.
B002TI7N3I|1|This product will not fit at all. One half of it is useless.
B008H5UAY6|5|First off i am 34 years old 190 pounds was skeptical about buying one of these and felt like i was going to get made fun of. But let me tell you i used to ride 300 miles a weekend without it, now i could ride 600 with it!  life safer and just makes the entire experience way more enjoyable even on short rides. Oh and not one person made fun of me lol...
B002UY8ZTW|5|very nice no more leaks good shipping time good price
B000A0CAM6|5|thanks
B000YC7GA6|5|works great, thanks
B0002KNZL4|5|I LOVE IT
B00V30J86I|3|Looks fine but I can't figure out how to attach it at the bottom....
B007WR25FC|1|Fell apart after first use.
B00L7E80IW|5|Good product.  Fit perfectly.
B00TH2GPMO|5|This offers great value for the DIY crowd.  I found the big leaks by inspection and repaired them and charged the system because it was empty. The system had been opened to do mechanical work and they put the wrong o rings in. Once recharged I used this to check the work. It was sensitive enough to find leaks that haven't emptied the system in a month. More o rings, but that will wait till next year. AC becomes moot in MN pretty soon.
B005HBTE1I|5|Great boats for an excellent price
B004LF6KJU|5|Perfect and received fast.
B00VYX2I7A|4|When it first came in I didn't like it at all. it was really light and didn't seem like it would look good, but after I put it on the jeep it looked great! In my opinion I think it looks way better than the stock grill and it makes the jeep look tougher. Definitely recommend this grill to anyone looking for a good clean looking grill.
B004HYRI28|1|Stake hole locations were not right so they did not fit on my 2004 GMC Sierra Ext. cab 6.5' bed
B001Y8L65U|2|One of the two stands was stripped right out of the box. Will not hold any weight at all.  The one that works works well.

B00TI5EKWC|5|I received this as a free review sample and thus far it has undergone a complete Central Florida summer with no issues (I received this in March and it's now August.) I mention this because especially in July and August the heat inside my vehicle where this is stored gets pretty high and is hard on electrical and electronic gear.<br /><br />This easily jump started a motorcycle, but if you are purchasing it for a diesel or 8-cyclinder engine you may want to read the product specs carefully before buying it. The maximum 6 cylinder gasoline  engine displacement is 3500cc, and this is not recommended for 4 cylinder (or above) diesel vehicles with displacement over 2000cc.<br /><br />I've reviewed similar jump starters and the operating range of some is not as robust as this one. You can charge this one up to 140 degrees F (according to the specs - I was unable to get an environment to test it), and as far down as 32 degrees F. The lower end may not make sense if you are in Minnesota in the dead of winter, but the temperature is for charging this battery, not jump starting a vehicle. I have other batteries that are not guaranteed to operate at all near that range. Still, if you live in colder climates I would contact the seller before making a purchase.<br /><br />One thing I like about this one is you can charge it with any micro USB cable. Many jump starter batteries require a more proprietary barrel connector. More importantly, this will charge at a full 2 Amps, so can be fully charged in less than six hours.<br /><br />Do note that the 10000mAh stored capacity is correct, but the useable capacity is closer to 7000mAh due to losses from heat and transfer, and cable inefficiency for this type of battery technology. Regardless of brand you will experience the same inefficiency, so if you are comparing this to other brands keep the fact that all of them are about 70% efficient.<br /><br />A final note: this is MUCH larger than an iPhone 6 Plus, which the description implies. It's heavier too. However, it's sturdy and convenient to store in a center console or glove box.lies. It's heavier too. However, it's sturdy and convenient to store in a center console or glove box.
B004X70LZA|4|Works as described.
B004QEKGA0|4|Although the basket is perfect, the converter to be able to use it in the standard hitch attachment is lousy.  It is plastic and rather than fitting completely around post, it offsets the post to one side.  Poor design.  However, the basket itself is great.
B00FAJOZTS|5|Very nice setup and delivery was very prompt
B0083TYGZ0|5|Seat covers arrived and installed just as represented. Will buy from this seller again. Made old seats look great!!
B007D0A2WQ|4|The cross bars were easy to install and at highway speeds will sometimes make noise if going into a slight cross wind but with a canoe in the rack are virtually noise free.
B00B26JDY0|5|look good fit perfect
B000C42RPK|5|fit perfectly on my '90 4Runner. a little stiffer than stock shocks
B00DDVU6EI|5|My 2005 Hyundai Sonata was developing a small miss when feathering the gas pedal, low or high speed, esp. when the A/C was on.  Plugs and timing belt were both replaced recently, because they were due but the car developed the miss anyway which seemed to be fuel or sensor related.<br /><br />I hoped to cure my problem with BG44 and I was not disappointed.  I ran one can thru a new fill up of 17 gallons and it never missed again.  Runs smoother than before at all speeds.  Very Pleased..................<br /><br />I highly recommend to clean and to keep clean your fuel system.  It cleaned my injectors as well as sensors and other associated fuel system components.  My miss is gone and mileage was never better.
B00JX5UZTO|1|I bought two of these kits for my motorcycle (high and low beam) and installed them July 30th, 2015.  When I first installed them, I noticed the light that was being projected on the wall kinda flickered.  However, I didn't think much of it.  Over time though, the high beam side wouldn't turn on each time (which wasn't a big issue since I could toggle the switch and that usually fixed the problem).  However, two months after the install, the low beam bulb burned out.  I happened to have a backup set of HID bulbs (same brand) so I installed it, that bulb died two days later.<br /><br />My last HID kit lasted five years, this kit was hit or miss and then after killing two bulbs within the span of two months, lasted me two months.<br /><br />I do not recommend the APEX brand.
B00IIFO2GC|4|Just got home from a 250 mile trip in 95+ degrees. Bought them when I got to my destination because my old warm weather gloves were done.<br /><br />They seem to do just fine in the heat. I didn't feel much airflow, but I also didn't feel my hands getting overly warm either. Guess that just means that they were in fact breathing.<br /><br />This is now my third pair of gloves made by Alpinestars. I've tried others. But always seem to end up with a pair of A-Stars. Great fit, quality, and durability.
B003G0KBK0|5|Fit in the truck great. These are great floor liners.
B00GHT6ZWU|5|All fixed now!
B00ADHQ0LI|5|Working great. Excellent.
B00I5X072U|4|So far so good.... very easy to replace
B004RNR9QY|5|Great drinking water safe and well made hose. End fittings and strain reliefs make for a durable product and very suitable to dockside use. Lastly, the price was exceptional for this quality. Takes a bit of time to flush the typical hose taste, but that is normal as this isn't rigid pipe after-all. Highly recommended...
B007HRGTJA|4|On a 97 Ford Ranger with a 7ft bed, I used the tilt bed method I saw on Youtube. Remove 4 of the Torx bolts holding the box to the frame and leave the two rear bolts loose almost to the point of removal. I used a chain hoist to lift the front of the bed up high enough to access the tank. Make sure to remove the three screws on the top of the old hose attached to the bed before you lift the bed up. No need to remove the bed or drop the tank.<br /><br />The only snag was the length of the hose. It could have been a little longer. But for the price, I can't complain too much. The last hose lasted 5 years. Also made in Taiwan. I expect no better from this one.
B003Y3SIE0|5|Superb buy for the money. Heavy and comes in carrying case. Best buy I have ever seen.
B00AJFIQLG|5|Easy to apply! Well packed! Look good!

B00Y1HRMFO|1|I have a saturn vue and apparently cannot be preprogrammed. The customer service was perfect.
B0026Y81VS|4|fairly easy install ------- fits tight and water proof but dislike the top roll straps that end up falling down out of sight behind the cab and have to be fished out in be used....... i had to install the black pinch paper clips to keep them on top and tangible to use..........
B00K1N43R2|5|this seat cooler is just amazing, its very comfortable and it does what it calims it does, In Saudi Arabia the climate is hot almost the whole year and such accessory is an outstanding and effective solution to bear with the constant heat<br />it keeps my back cool and sweat is not a problem anymore, excellnt job Viotek.
B009DJYNTI|2|Keep breaking on me. but i do enjoy the delivery.
B003S2E4UE|2|Trying to glue together a plastic vacuum cleaner handle. I can't get this stuff to harden up enough.
B001F2I7SE|5|Excellent buy. Easy installation, Will do exactly as it was intended.
B008OZSNA2|5|They sent the wrong bulbs for the tail lights, should be a blade style instead of a festoon. Other than that a great product at a great price
B00IS604LI|4|As advertised. Very good sticker strength on it.. Put it in my front grill to the right of my Challenger logo and despite only gripping on a limited area (it's a grill) it held on well. Only complaint is that after a few washes the background of it (the part of the badge that doesn't say sxt) kinda clouded. Before that it matched the challenger badge perfect. After a few washes it doesn't match perfect. Doesn't look bad.. But doesn't look seamless.<br />UPDATE: 6/27/2017 - have had this on my car for almost 2 years and it's held up. Still looks good despite many car washes. Very good buy
B00NB34NMO|5|Perfect product if you have a motorcycle that regular plug sockets does not fit (needs slim wall socket) worked on my 2001 kawasaki vulcan 750.
B00L6WPC0E|5|Was $20, $10 to cut, and $80 to program so $110 total. Works great and cheaper then my local VW dealerships. 2003 GTI. Make sure you find out how much it is to cut and program in your area first or you could end up spending more.
B00WL0APHK|5|These boards look great on the Toyota Tundra that we just bought.  The installation was a little confusing due to terrible instructions.  But once we figured them out, the installation went smoothly and the boards work great!
B0031I4HN4|5|This is a 9 month update on these ACDelco front brake rotors:<br /><br />Grandpa here... I purchased these ACDelco brake rotors back in May of 2015 for our Chevrolet Blazer 4x4. I only use ACDelco parts on this truck as anything else just does not cut it for fit and longevity. During these past 9 months we have had a master cylinder failure, issues with the brake lines and the ABS system, all due to the master cylinder going out. And both front wheels heating up numerous times due to the ABS issues and the ABS trying to come on while doing 40 mph down the road. The problem ended up being an issue with the 2002 model due to incompetence of the manufacturer. But through it all, and all the days of heating up the rotors to almost glowing red, even to the point they tarnished blue and purple all over front and back. These ACDelco brake rotors took it all like a champ and are still going strong and are still straight as an arrow. Braking is just as good as day one of installation, there is no squeak from any brake dust, and the brake dust in general is actually very small. And to top if all off, these rotors have to take the abuse each time we drive, as currently our front shocks are toast so the truck nose dives while its driven during braking. Tuff rotors they are.<br /><br />I buy nothing else buy ACDelco parts for our Chevrolet Blazer 4x4, as there just is nothing else that works as good. And for basic rotors at a fair price. These rotors are the king of the hill. I would trust them through just about anything the road or nature could throw at us. And I live in the upper NE where the blizzards live. And these ACDelco rotors have no issues with snow, ice or even frigid temperatures.<br /><br />We were not paid nor discounted in any way, shape or form for giving our honest opinion here of this product as a review to assist others.

B000C9CDAY|5|It works!
B000H2BPMS|4|Very bright
B009HL6OTO|5|Easily installed on my 01 Kawasaki Prairie 400.  The old belt was getting worn, so there was an immediate improvement after installing the Gates belt.  Only have 30 miles on it so far, but so far so good.
B00R6S0MEI|5|Excellent Product!
B00FB3E1S8|1|Cheaply made.
B00GR3VPQC|5|Cute
B00UTTVE98|5|Worked great, cluck off click on, no tools even needed for install
B00C6J5BG6|5|The part arrived very promptly, and was exactly what was represented. I didn't have to wait for a &#34;bidding war&#34; and got a fair deal.
B00VUUKDFG|2|there is no manual attached to the product to enable you adjust the product
B0039Z1UHA|5|This works pretty good especially when your exhaust is very close to your shocks.
B00774U6HY|5|Great price. Good fit.
B000BUQOFE|4|Good but don't leave in sun or too much heat they turn brittle in time.
B00180P03I|5|It works.
B000TYQB14|5|Easy install in my 2005 Yukon Denali.
B001NYJOCC|2|I'm sure it works fine, but you MUST have an impact wrench to remove the old one, period.  Simply won't work if you don't.
B002M3KSK0|1|Didn't fit my HHR
B00MBPLPII|5|This stuff is GREAT! My Rims look Brand New! This product gives you a finish that looks like a thin layer of clear &#34;paint-like&#34; gloss (but not to point of looking unnatural) that makes rims look almost better-than-new! You have to follow the directions to the &#34;letter.&#34; Buy a aluminum rim cleaner; I bought MEGUIAR'S G14324 Hot Rims Aluminum Wheel Cleaner on Amazon at a Great Price!  If using this; don't pay any attention to any negative reviews; these were from people who wanted a &#34;spray on wash off&#34; product (Meguiar's sell this for more money) but I opted for the G14324 because it was milder & safer for aluminum rims. I used a &#34;dollar store&#34; light detail brush; followed cleaner directions, sprayed & brushed rims in a circular motion & washed off thoroughly; twice. MAKE SURE RIMS ARE CLEAN; ANY DIRT LEFT ON THEM WILL BE SEALED IN WITH &#34;NEW WIPE&#34;! Make sure rims are completely dry (I waited an hour & dried again to make sure no dust.  Plan to apply &#34;Wipe New&#34; using it on 1 side of car (front & rear rims) then continue on other side. MUST WEAR THE GLOVES & BE OUTSIDE WITH PLENTY VENTILATION ( I was under a car-port; if in garage; have door & windows open)! Don't do on windy day to avoid dust!  The Wipe New solution pad applies on like water, but don't scrub on; just thoroughly WIPE it on; then move on to the next rim!  If you have small rims (I have 16&#34;) you can do all 4 rims with 1 pack & have an extra pack left! (I don't know how good this will be because product has 2 year warranty & maybe in 2 years this extra pack of unused product may go bad. But on &#34;flip side&#34; if product wears off rims before then; then you can re-apply with your extra pack). BE SURE TO LET THE RIMS DRY AS PER INSTRUCTIONS. DON'T PLAN ON DRIVING CAR FOR A LEAST A FULL DAY TO ALLOW RIMS TO DRY & THEY CAN'T GET WET; THIS WILL SMEAR FINISH! I hope this helps! My rims look: BRAND - NEW - AWESOME! THEY HAVE A KIND OF &#34;WET LOOK&#34; TO THEM! THIS STUFF IS GREAT!!!
B00WTJXII6|5|easy to install, really nice add on
B00GAVF1TI|5|I've been wearing Shoei helmets for more than 20 years. That are great
B00762JLXC|5|good quality
B0045ZXOHM|5|Great match to the one we lost!  Great service and packaging.  Thanks.
B0055QUZ54|4|These flaps are really nice. Hard to install and if you have wide tires these won't cover them. They look nice tho. Mine came w/o any hardware and I had to go to a hardware store.
B000ZIZ32W|1|Broke on the first use, should've known. Bought a Matco one instead!
B00P5YM0VS|5|Look great, easy install.
B00A6WY5SK|5|Worked great! Super bright and great color
B00AC9UPMC|5|Works better than expected. Lessened the wind noise a bit and doesn't invade the opening and closing of the chin bar as much as I thought.
B00IEA8R76|5|2 months and about 2k later and my 2009 Honda Accord EX sedan still running smooth thanks to these affordable wheel bearings<br /> Easy to install, and a great value. Wish i could say the same for the horrible Brake pads installed! Guess you cant win em' all! Great bearings though, highly recommend!
B00FEU61KY|5|Love this sticker: went on easily and looks great!
B000CMF2QI|5|love em!
B00O3QBERK|5|The mirror is great and shipping was fast
B004JL0QZA|4|Works well - not super strong, but enough to hold boxes & crates during short drives - even at freeway speeds.
B009PQHWB0|3|It was nice but nit what I expected
B00ETHGCDY|5|So dope
B000BWCFLO|1|This is a worthless piece. There is no damper on the needle so it jumps all over and its hard to tell what the pressure. On top of that it only lasted for about 30 min before it just quit working period.
B003RYN6OS|2|Only fair wear and tear quality. Works OK but the low price is it's best feature.
B00PV5DFUQ|3|These are a bit of a clunky fit for a 2015 Honda CR-V.  Even with trimming, the fit is not great.  The best value in mats that I have found are the set I got at my local warehouse store (C0stco)
B00B0Q60C0|4|Fits perfectyly
B008KV4IIG|5|This fuel pump was identical to the OEM fuel pump that I needed to replace!  When a friend suggested that I look on Amazon for one, I thought he was joking.  I'm glad I did now!  This fuel pump definitely exceeded my expectations!
B000VHZHOQ|5|Great
B001BJZ7TI|5|Ok
B004I10MC8|5|Fit Perfectly!
B002VIDPBA|5|This is the first time I've used ceramic pads and I put them on a '97 Astro van. I reused the rotors which were in good condition and did not need resurfacing. I didn't know what to expect and I'm impressed. They have what I'm calling a soft touch for lack of a better description. They engage and release softly and smoothly, but positively, compared to what I was used to. Based on that I recommend them. I won't know about wear for a year or two though.
B002MQCY7C|3|It is alright does as advertised but found it faster to use the straps without it as it has to be exactly in line to click locked.
B002DLYR8A|5|Fantastic googles for cosplay! Affordable and customizable, what more could you want?
B002TN4IVS|5|A fun little addition to any Honda, it's always fun to look in my mirror on the highway, see this, and see someone in my mirror. Cool sticker, but be warned that when you apply it, since it is a sticker, its not as clear as the picture shows or how the &#34;Objects in mirror are closer than they appear&#34; looks. Nice regardless though.
B000MS9VZK|5|This is a great battery, I was afraid to order it online after reading others reviews. It arrived fast and in great shape. I installed it myself and it works great!
B001DKT0DO|5|These were very easy to install, just take the paper off the adhesive on the pack and stick on.
B0060EU5PK|5|100 % satisfied
B0008FUFR0|5|Great item. Fit perfectly. Well made.
B00FJUEO12|5|Love it and use it everyday!  Easy to assemble and plenty sturdy for household use.  Got it because Of back problems
B0108MWEVW|5|Great! Couldnt have asked for any better with a used item.
B006STTIVY|5|Excellent
B006FW3G2G|5|So far so good move it around to charge different battery pleased with product
B0016IXF7A|5|Great product works as it should,correct size for my vehicle
B00MLXTXUW|5|Works great!
B00X711YWW|2|Pictures are correct, description is not. Will absolutely NOT fit a W123 or W124. It has kind of an askew/rectangle frame that the fake leather (yes, FAKE leather, man-made) is glued to. Useless to me. Thinking of cutting off the faux leather from the plastic frame and see if I can glue it to the W123 console frame.
B0052XFWCG|5|Works as described awesome
B00B8IXTME|5|Fits my 2013 honda accord ex-l nicely. Makes a big difference in temperature during the hot summer days. Kinda bulky but it gets the job done.
B003GC74U8|5|Love these use them all the time in the microwave
B006UZWYD0|5|Item exactly as described. Fast service; had it the next day.
B00JA3BMDW|4|works great
B002P8DF5M|5|Thank you. It was the correct mirror  and it arrived in a timely manner
B00HLV05DS|5|Great helmet for the price, I have one for me and one for my wife. A fair amount of wind noise but what can you expect when paying a quarter of the price
B004IARSEE|5|Great
B001HBT1V0|5|Very good workmanship and works as expected
B000EALHHG|2|I was dissatisfied. My oil spots aren't very big and it didn't do anything for them.
B000C9P35Q|5|Part was perfect

B009OQ3XY6|4|My husband loves this tag.It is very beautiful and bright colors.
B00IS93EW6|1|These fenders are pretty sweet. Cant go wrong with the price compared to other one's on the market. Install was pretty straightforward but time consuming. Just watched a video on youtube and started chopping away. Got the smittybilt fenders for the rear. Happy with both products. Happy jeepin....<br /><br />Update*****  have had my fenders on about seven months. And every nook and cranie has signs of rust. I give it 2 years before I have to replace. Don't get me wrong fenders are very heavy duty and would last with a better powder coat. Just alot of upcoming work on my end. Check out the photo.<br /><br />Update #2. Well..... Not even a year later and i had to pull these fenders off cause of the rust issue. Took a hose to them and i bet 75% of that crappy powder coat came off. Its really a shame since know my jeep is sitting in the drive way looking sad.  You fellow jeepers out there buy somewhere else. This is pretty bad stuff. Im nit looking forward to replacing fenders, paint, etc!!!!!!<br />☹️☹️☹️☹️
B001Q4QO2C|5|Exactly what I needed to hold my crossbow on my 4 wheeler front rack.
B001LHVOVK|5|Excellent
B00316QNTC|3|While this porta potti seems strong and well made, the seat is not very large.  While an adult may be able to sit on it, anyone with any girth is going to have a hard time doing the paper end of business! It's competitor Thetford is a good 3 inches longer in the seat, and close to an inch wider. Also, the water tank did not hold pressure over night.  If you are a small person, this would be a 5 star toilet.  I found it hard to give it 3 stars as a slightly overweight person.  Returned for a refund.
B00CL0ZPUC|5|It works great! Easy Installation, put it on a moped because headlight were not bright enough.
B001NZQIFM|4|Easy to install.  The cable is only barely long enough to mount the brake controller under the dash on the driver's side.  To do so, I had to remove the plastic under dash skirt and fish the wire along the same path as some of the stock cabling.  The cable is not housed in any of that plastic flexible conduit, and I was concerned about abrasion of the wire insulation and the dash skirt, so I had to buy some to protect the cable wires.  The Tekonsha instructions available online do not show the correct under dash picture for the OEM hookup.  I found it in my owner's manual and in online installation videos.
B000H94F6E|5|as advertised
B00LF05KU4|5|I love these little buggers.  But I don't know if some people know how to use them.  You don't just clip them to your vent and expect a rose garden.  They work when you clip them to your vent, and you are using the heat or the air conditioner.  You have to have the vent in use for them to flow the scent out into your car.  Just wanted to mention this for the people that say they don't smell anything.
B000EFILQ6|5|Product met expectations.
B002OPSY9S|5|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B00029JC6M|5|It works really well with the Weber Carbs especially on the Jeeps
B00FBVE68U|1|NOTHING DID WORK AS EXPECTED, EVERYTHING WAS WRONG,..
B00G4RV2DW|5|On time and exactly how it was described!
B003O6SJEQ|4|Product just as advertised. Great merchant
B001THRG9Q|5|As advertised
B0094JIWFI|4|So far so good even under extreme heat conditions! Didn't come with bolts or shims was advertised that they were included.
B004ME11FS|2|Not easy to put back add the hose is rigid.
B0068NUSC8|2|The logo wad stuck together and unable to pull apart without tearing the logo. Hopefully they will return this one and replace with a new one.
B00NXEB4UA|1|This is a waste of money do not buy these! Absolutely does not accommodate for the grooves and bumps on the lights. If you're looking to throw twenty bucks away buy these.
B0041TQU8W|4|fits perfectly
B001C6Q7US|5|Exactly what I was looking for!<br />I give it 3 smiles!😁😁😁
B00KY5P2KE|3|Was good but it did not come with instructions
B00NPUUWXW|5|Works well on my 570 RZR
B00ELHT41Y|5|The best engine oil out there. What else can i say.
B004UHF6R6|5|Works well
B00EDDQ6RQ|5|Product is great, I replaced it on my 2004 Hyundai Elantra. It is half the price of getting one at pep boys or Napa.
B00F50T8GM|5|Works well. You just have to find a place to stash the housing. Took away the flicker and serves as the adapter. 08 JK Unlimited Rubicon
B000OEDQQW|5|High quality. Does what you want it to do.  Buy it and don't worry again.  Would definitely buy it again.
B004IAB4DK|5|very good item
B001UROTUE|5|Really like the gloves. Would recommend for sure. Padding is nice too.
B000C2EBEM|4|Gaskets all seem good quality and fit well, only complaint is the kit does not include every gasket you will need.  I had to pick up two at local Toyota shop.
B0089CJ9JY|5|good quality, a bit bigger than what I expected
B003179XKW|5|Very easy to install. You can adjust the amount of lowering by adjusting the length of the provided PVC spacers. I ended up going with a 1.5&#34; lower.<br />I called Progressive to ask if the level of my fork oil needed to be adjusted, and they said no.<br />The ride is everything I wanted. Pliant, yet not weak. Good all-around spring rate.<br />One other thing... it took longer to jack up my Dyna than it did to slip these in. Very highly recommended.
B00AIXCXNQ|2|It looks pretty good but it's cheap plastic.
B002R4SY3W|1|Okay for the price and not as blue as they make it seem. I've had them in for three weeks and you can tell that one is going to go out soon they are not sylvania brand that's for sure
B000P6WS22|4|Seems to work great. I'd buy it again.
B003DNL8ZC|5|Large Sedan (191&#34;-210&#34;) as recommended by the sizing guide fits my 2008 BMW 550i very well. Front and rear elastic ends line up almost  perfect. Quite surprised & pleased it fits so well.  Driver door zipper access is also convenient.<br /><br />Not sure how it will perform over the long term. But given the reasonable price, if I get a solid year out of it I'd be happy.
B013R7P8YK|5|I like this set of skull half face masks. Both of my sons ride motorcycles and will be able to put these to use.  I love that this purchase included two masks.  The masks are really light weight and could be tucked in your pocket easily.  I tried the masks on myself to see what they felt like and it actually felt quite comfortable.  I could breath very easily and it fit well because of the stretch.  I kept it on the mask for about an hour and not once did I need to pull the mask back, it stayed put.  The skull printed on the masks is well placed and realistic looking.  It reminds me of the Sons of Anarchy masks. My sons said the masks help keep bugs and dirt from hitting their face, plus the masks help keep your face warm. I am pleased with this purchase, the masks are well made, and my sons will use them often.<br />I purchased this product at a reduced cost in return for an honest and unbiased review. I based my review on my own opinion of the skull masks.
B0002SR2RY|5|worked great!
B00GBCIRQ0|4|Great cheap fix
B00RTFB4Y0|5|Installation was very easy. It also comes with additional 3M tape in case you want to put some more or in case you didn't install properly first time.<br /><br />Although the protector say S Q5, it really fits well on a 2013 Audi Q5. I hope it goes long way without a problem.
B00FYX2WEU|1|I ordered these seatcovers for my 2003 Grand Cherokee Laredo and they did not fit at all! Very disappointed...it's like the covers belonged on another vehicle all together.
B005GKAPDQ|5|Well made. Very satisfied. Good product. Thank you so much
B00IO97VNS|5|Perfect fit and are working well after 7500 miles
B00A145NL6|5|The wiper motor arrived quickly and fit perfectly to my ford 2010 Escape. Everything went back together easily and motor worked well once hooked up.
B00GL1IIHO|1|Didn't last a month before the left side mirror quit working.
B005PZMLDY|3|The fit could have been better for my 08 Camry
B0128SCKN6|5|I like them fit good
B000V8VZ78|5|This product masked the deep scratches caused by a cat in a brown leather couch and sofa. The the cream works by smoothing and protecting. I was really pleased with the results.
B00AFRIT2E|5|Placed it over an intake on a carbureted engine, worked great
B000182EUK|5|The ventshade came packaged well and fast. The installation on my Ford Ranger was quick and easy. It help to eliminate the heat that builds up in the truck. The plastic is sturdy.
B000C2WE0K|5|Great part, good price
B001G6LI1C|5|Like OEM...
B011PJIMPE|4|Feels like good quality. Does NOT fit 83 Nighthawk
B000C9I4AM|5|Great part, work good
B00JH23LVW|5|I was half expecting for this battery to be a POS but it works great.  Lots of power!
B004NL1P60|5|I had a check engine light on my 2001 Camry V6 Gallery Series. Put the obd2 scanning machine and found it to be one of the cylinders.  When checked the possible causes, It pointed to maybe the ignition coil. I had recently did a tune up about a few months ago, Timing belt, water pump,  spark plugs and plug wires.  I rechecked the plugs and wires and all were ok. So it had to be the coil. I was hesitant to buy non Toyota parts, but over a hundred dollars to just around 27 dollars... I put  it on and had no problem since. I installed July 20 2015 and no issue since then and of August 29 2015. No more check engine light.
B00152C02S|4|Very tight fit. With this system installed it will be kinda hard to check the power steering fluid since the intake pipe is about an inch away from the cap. Although you'd have to remove it to work on any part of the driverside it only takes a few extra minutes.
B007CNB5W0|1|Lasted less than 2 months, waste of money.  Purchasing the name brand part from a dealer instead (The same of which lasted 5 years the last time it was replaced.)
B0056PIO8O|5|Husband loved it
B00BG07GR8|5|Great pipe for the price. Went on easy and fit was good. The ability to change the tips is great. Even with the racing tip, it's not very loud. The silencer tip is very quiet but still has good power. The mounting rings are a bit hoaky but they work. The only problem I had is the best exhaust was blowing on my turn signal so I had to make a small bracket to drop the pipe down a little. I ride a KTM 500 EXC.
B002G2YAVU|5|Good price very good compressor
B00ERYAH3U|5|Excellent product!
B00TEH6T50|5|Nice quality
B00LXAMVOE|5|Fits 2016 GTI perfectly.
B011RZ12HQ|5|Great price
B0014DF1AG|5|great item
B004VT8BW0|4|I like these tail lights. They looks great, easy to install, and give my tahoe a greet look, but what the manufacturer left out that these tail lights don't have running lights and an officer pulled me over said my lights were pitch black but he said when I would break and signaled they worked. The manufacturer should include that they're aren't any running lights.
B000E7WLJW|5|This is a wonderful addition to the Cargo Basket.
B0009IQZFM|5|Meguiars is always good
B00TKS3FKA|5|I love how these look in my Lexus!
B00CRPAHKE|1|This product had good reviews so I purchased it. Mistake. I was able to get one hose to move water from the sink to the floor once. After working up a sweat trying to repeat process with no luck I tried second hose. I could not even get that one to work once. After pumping hose up and down swiftly water level would reach curve in hose at top of pan. No matter how swiftly I pumped hose,  water would not pass the curve in hose and run into pan on the floor. From my experience I cannot recommend this product.
B0049HKFIM|5|Fits great as an OEM replacement.  Much better than the one that I bought at the local auto parts store.
B00ANG15F0|5|It worked as advertised perfectly
B00ICR1UB6|5|Great voltage current meter, does the job.<br />Easy to use, and to check your different chargers and wall connectors.<br />I liked the design, it looks better than other voltage meters in the store.<br />It switches between voltage current and amperage every few seconds.<br /><br />Please remember to vote below my review if it was helpful or not helpful. If<br />you choose to vote my review unhelpful, please feel free to leave me a brief comment so I can improve my future reviews as they are important to fellow buyers like us.
B00J6ZI6PQ|5|Fit my 2014 Ford Escape had to drop the exhaust but other than that fairly straight forward
B00E49X87U|5|I got the package in 3 days of ordering it. Came from California and I'm in Michigan. Its fit perfectly. Came with new bolts that fit perfect also. It doesn't cover the front sprocket and chain like the factory one does. Now since I didn't want to take the chance of having my pants get caught in the chain, i took the factory plastic cover, ground off the 2 parts that stick past the chain, used the stock bolts (they are longer than the included ones), put 2 lock washers between the stock and new piece on each bolt to make it sit flush, and tightened it up. Fits 100% perfect and no worries about snagged pants! Its well worth the $20
B0041PPV4K|5|Good quality
B001GH1ODI|4|This leveling kit done a good job but be prepared for several hours and a lot of hard work to put the kit  on  and some skill .  Cannot get a five star rating because of difficulty of installation
B00EC0ZDD8|4|FIt perfectly for my2007 Mazda 3 5-door.
B00O7YCQ9S|5|Work well and stay stuck to car.
B00UNTU3VO|5|Great product. I got it this week and been using it quite often and it's a great product if you want to keep you car looking great. +++++******
B0085KGOH0|4|Comes complete and ready to use, for a great price.
B006VYHQWY|5|Very pleased with these crossbars. Definite OEM product and included all parts needed. Took my husband about 10 -15 minutes to install. Super easy to install and looks great on my 2012 MDX.
B000EDOSKQ|4|I have bought 3 of these, as I am resetting all my roof-top vents..  I hope it lasts as well as it seals.  Great value, includes screws.
B000SL4AA2|4|This compressor does a good job of inflating tire. Cord long enough to reach rear tires. Takes a little while but gets the job done.
B00UVVAVMU|5|Perfect, just as described no problems at all. A+ all the way.
B004BG1FIK|4|Excellent brush for vents and small jobs in the car. Do not be surprised it is much smaller than you think. It is only about 4 inches from the tip of the brush to the base of the handle. But it is excellent for what I bought it for which is cleaning a/c vents and other small areas when detailing cars.
B006Q0TKSQ|1|Not same fixation
B010H3HJOO|5|I love this sticker........
B00U8L6OXI|5|Great quality, just got it today and I love it! I will give update how its holding up in few months.  ... Almost 2 years, still have it!  Changed the battery and re did the stitches, looks clean and new again!
B00VVFGIXG|5|Worked perfect. Now I am ready for the rainy weather.
B00DILTFP4|5|great wiper
B000C7QH8K|5|This radiator has been a life saver! My Chevy Lumina 2000 used to overheat all the time but not this summer. Love it!
B001J7CO02|5|Each of the individual horns can be removed from the hub and tucked in where ever you find room. I made 3 brackets from 3/16 x 1 1/2&#34; strap steel. The horn air inlets are threaded female 1/8&#34; pipe thread. Adapters from 1/8&#34; npt to 1/4&#34; nylon air brake hose are available on this site as well as Ys. Solenoid is 1/4&#34; air hose in and 1/4&#34; npt threaded male out.
B004GCRJ98|5|Came on time, exactly what I needed, easy to install, best price on mine.
B002MEHFVO|1|This mirror is not a match for this set of mirrors I purchased for my truck!
B00NQGCDC8|5|This does the job in no time at all and is cheaper that the name brand ARB and Lois the same color and all
B00CJ21U7O|5|Excelente shipping, fenomenal packaging, and gave my vehicle a very nice look
B00L24M96Q|5|A+
B00MJ43ZQG|1|Front visors were too long, this did not fit a 2009 Mazda 3. to ad insult to injury, I have to pay $6.78 for the return shipping!
B001LHVOVK|5|man, this is the best value out there. Pulled the codes from my 95 Altima the cleared them, Just in time to get her smog completed.
B000C7ZDQM|2|The switch does not fit into the factory location.
B00OUUP4QG|5|It brings the nerd out in me..I love everything Batman so I am very satisfied with this product. Bright lighting in the dark. Easy to install.
B00NEX77WO|1|Tabs were not removed as advertised and I paid more for this product over others because it said the tabs were removed. Should have paid for the $10.00 one.
B013XSCHXI|5|My husband and I LOVE this sticker!! We both have our hand gun permit. It is on a quality vinyl decal. It's the perfect size for my bummer. It's measurements are 4 x 6. I can't wait till a nice day to be able to put it on. They sell several styles are stickers. The sticker is laminated. This is a great sticker to have to show your pride.<br /><br />I received this free in exchange for my review.
B000GZAUG8|5|best o.e. plug replacement for my hyundai at a great price
B00W5MG8XY|2|Cheap. I have another one similar to this and the tip and the seat belt cutter is made out of metal. Not what I expected and expensive for being plastic. The other one I had is made of metal and came with case. Giving 2 stars for those reason.
B002P8EMK4|5|Worked well. Fit well.
B005O2B8E6|5|Deutsch connectors are top of the line. You don't really need much beyond a crimper if you have small screwdrivers and an awl, but the specialty tools are reasonable and work better. I had to learn to use these to make repairs on a skid steer. They are such an indestructible and superior exterior DC wire fastening method especially for rough terrain and adverse conditions, that I use them for all my rolling stock wiring needs now.
B00FT69VFA|5|easy to install seat covers.  velcro side closer made it easy to slip around armrest that was incorporated into my 1995 e320 mercedes convertible seat for a better quality fit and finish.  Very quality pelt that fit the seats perfectly.
B00992HKL2|1|Sierra 1500 pick up. Not suitable
B004ZF39T0|5|I had an issue with the first set I received. Kensun Customer service was outstanding and did a great job helping resolve my issue.
B006K2JQX4|5|I purchased this for my 2005 CVPI and it is perfect, no problems at all. A+ all the way.
B001A0J2JO|4|This takes a bit of getting used to  - especially distance perception.
B0027QWNGO|5|It's a good size for my small car. It also matches the black interior well. The fabric is good quality for the price.
B00NFF39MI|5|VERY NICE
B002R38TCE|2|Used this on my convertible top and spent significant time picking the loose horse hair off the top fabric than I anticipated.
B008RA9FG0|3|I've discovered what the extra 2 lights are for... 2 of my end firing LED lights from the kit have burnt out after a couple weeks of mild use. After removing the lights, it appears that the cheap wire electrical connection has come loose for each LED. The LED is fine, but without the wire contacts they're useless. The end firing lights could be higher quality here... I would have much preferred getting a whole set of the other LED lights they included.
B000GHV7VI|4|Nice heavy duty crowfoot. Worked as expected
B000C9I8WQ|5|Original GM EGR valve. Can't beat the price.
B00JZQXJ3K|5|Great price, not as easy as the more expensive ones to put on. But still the best deal for the money out there.  The wiring harness is by far the best offered and the simplest to install.
B0002SRE8Q|5|Excellent product and excellent service.
B000IYPQQ6|5|good price, ordered it, fast ship, it fit, that's y i use amazon
B004P5W66M|5|Snapped right in. Too easy. Like less than 1 minute easy.
B00AJV9ONY|5|Arrived in OEM packaging
B008214ZDW|2|Color does not match exactly.
B00B2AF61A|5|This is a very good lift kit for the money. I ordered with full leaf springs and was well worth it.  Not sure it gives you a full 3&#34; lift but it's close. No installation issues and the quality was good. Ride and control was much better than I expected.
B003YYMM1E|5|Perfect. Just perfect.
B003V5KKH4|5|Received as advertised in a timely manner.
B002NEV7S0|4|Belt will fit 2010 Mazda 3, I-4, 2.0.  Belt remover/installer is needed but will need to have leverage to install belt on.  I used half of my 3 ton floor jack handle with a 1/2&#34; ratchet or flex bar
B001NZKMUE|5|Bought two and put them in about a month ago, they fit perfectly, and work great.
B000A2B0IO|5|Worked and fit perfectly
B005MJYUAA|1|After only wearing this brace occasionally over the course of a year the rubber in the main straps has began to rip apart save your money and buy a better brace.
B00MV654UM|5|I practice trap, neuter and release, so this accurately reflects the number of cats I've handled!  The backing plastic is pretty sticky so you need to be slow and careful when peeling if from the decal, or you risk tearing off the kitty tails.  The gloss white really stands out.
B00YE360TO|5|This organizer is so perfect, one would think it was made by the car manufacturer. The fit couldn't be more perfect, it makes the entire console so much more useful, and the convenience is fantastic. It's so simple to remove and put back when needed. I just love this in my Q5!
B001AM8KAO|5|work great and easy to install
B00A7YVRM4|5|very durable and strong
B009D3K7E4|4|This matched our Toyota perfectly.  It worked great on a few scratches we had.
B000JFHNEC|5|Excellent quality
B008G2XRYU|5|it works great I like that does not make noise when mounting or dismounting
B00J4TW2SQ|4|So far it's fine have nit driven it much yet. Had to get a couple of nuts and bolts to compete putting it together. Looks better than the advertisement photo.
B00THJCA44|3|Thin metal, if you are looking for a cheap solution. I would get this. Showed up faster than the OEM GM part I had to track down to order. However, it still took a little bit to make it fit almost perfect by bending.
B0092KVYGI|5|Fdo
B005FKR1WA|5|My rotors were warped (terrible shimy, especially on downhill braking.) I wanted to upgrade to ceramic so this kit is great value for money. Easy replacement on my 16&#34; wheels/6 bolts and enjoyed return to good braking performance. Have been working well for 2 months now.
B000CNLB3K|5|sounds great, love my new sound
B004ME3ADY|4|Added color and spice to my car.
B0002Q8036|4|Kit was complete, easy to follow instructions...
B00JF92IHK|4|Great looking but plastic
B000BPTVTK|5|Worked from the first time I used it. Definitely would recommend.
B000EVU8JS|5|Works fine. Help me confirm that the misfire/dead cylinder problem of my car is no enough pressure.
B00KO77C5A|4|I research EVERYTHING.  This product seems high quality and has worked fine for me.<br /><br />The only draw back is its weight.
B000UZSJQM|5|I had evaluated this elsewhere a few years ago and when I found a need immediately bought one. I have an 85 Gallon 18.5 SCFM Eagle Compressor and needed to insure I had clean water free and oil free air. I use this with the bottom port slightly opened and have had no problems at all. This is fulfilling a need where a refrigerated regenerative dryer was cost prohibited.
B00D7QHSKY|2|The adhesive is horrible. Doesnt want to stick. Bad bargain.
B00QNQOVC8|4|The straps sent with this are worthless.  They stretch entirely too much.  Hammock itself is great, just save yourself some time and go ahead and order some good straps.
B00J36N4TG|5|Great set of plate holders.Excellent value for money
B00DUGXH6U|4|Worked good for 93 civic fender liner slightly larger than OE but it holds better
B008CE0R40|4|These things are flexible.  They hold my 17,000# camper very well.  I used them on an grade and they really gripped well.
B004C69NGA|5|Great price for a genuine part!
B004A0DRJM|5|😁😁😁😁😁
B00GBQ73ZM|5|Perfect fit.  Love the K&N stuff.  I've read posts and blogs where people put these filters down, but I've put them in dozens of cars, all fit perfect, some improved fuel economy and some provided noticeable performance improvement.  The only issue I've ever had was with one I had in my truck for 12 years and the foam seal was starting to degrade (starting to, but still sealed).  All weighed out $5 to $10 a couple times a year for a paper filter that does okay would have been $120 to $240, I paid $50, checked it every oil change, cleaned it once (I already had cleaner and oil for a previous filter but a kit is about $10) and it wasn't really that bad.  I figure I came out at half the price for better filtration.
B000CO90FA|3|Worked. It is a little too tight and made it difficult to get the brake cable installed.
B000BPWSFO|4|Fits my Milodon valve covers.
B00ABZC8IG|5|Great chain for my vest!
B00YBMH35S|1|The rear light didn't come with set
B003NHEPEE|5|Installed on my 2007 Yukon easily with just a screwdriver.  Stronger than OEM.  Just a slight knock, it's almost hard for my wife to close the hatch! I replaced both even though only one had gone bad. It was a quick, and cheap fix.  Thanks Amazon.
B00UM4BM6U|1|Didn't fit like they said they would.
B001CIA0OK|4|I cut this down to fit my Jensen interceptor III, and it works great.
B00GNU33KU|2|nice idea but the inside reflector broke after a couple of rides. it rattled around inside the light. tried to repair but it is bigger than the hole for the bulb. Had to throw it away. reflector is made of very thin metal. poor quality.
B00DVMADVK|5|I was going to order new badges for my 07 335I e92 but came across these and glad I did. I was worried that you would be able to notice that theyre overlays but once you clean the badges and apply these it has a factory look. you can barely tell its a decal but others cant tell at all! I ordered the carbon fiber black with red and per the sellers instructions wrote him a message with my color choices immediately after ordering. product arrived fast and was shipped in a padded envelope between two sturdy pieces of thick cardboard. Comes with extras to cover mistakes and i was able to cover hood, trunk, steering wheel, and wheels. I ended up using only the carbon fiber black and applied it over the blue areas on the emblem for a black and white emblem. it did look nice with the red over the white but i'll save them and see how it looks later after I add some red accents to the car.
B004RNR9BY|5|THIS HOSE IS AMAZING!  YOU TWIST IT ONTO THE SPIGOT TURN THE WATER ON AND IT JUST ROLLS OUT OF THE OTHER END. BEST HOSE IVE EVER HAD, AND ITS A PRETTY BLUE COLOR! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND BUY THIS HOSE. YOU WONT REGRET IT.
B00K6TBVBW|5|Very bright lights also very simple install it only comes with one light but its a very good quality will definitely buy more
B003ZWZ7VM|5|Fits perfectly
B001945LI2|5|Great boot for the Price. Going to buy another pair as backup.
B009681GM8|1|Junk. blade came off and jammed my throttle body. Almost got hit by cars as I tried to cross a highway. bought the car used and someone else had installed this. Did know it was there until it messed up.
B00EFFZ8GC|5|I was suprised at the quality of this product. It has a nice solid feel and arrived fast with no scratches or defects. I shouldve ordered a 2nd one for the front but oh well
B00VAJWZD0|5|Great product.
B0006IX87S|5|Very good water and easy to use. Recommend for first time RV just in case you get some not so good water.
B000C01T3K|5|Great Rotor which I've used before on same vehicle. Even Wear and minimized rust after 3 years of Brutal Northeast winters.
B004R4WRN8|5|Fits perfect, allows me to plug the trailer ball hole when I know I'm not going to be using it!
B000H5R5YM|4|if you use a lot, shop packs is the way, to go.
B00EE8K4XM|5|Just received these and put them in my 2015 Subaru Forester. They fit great and are well constructed. I've owned weather tech car mats in the past and these are quite comparable. Weather tech mats seem to be thicker and more rigid not that that is a bad thing but these seem thinner and more pliable. These also have the spikes to hold them in place and seem to work well. I don't think you could go wrong with either set but these may save you a few dollars.
B00144EOOE|1|you listed  an omc part with a mercury bearing you should keep merc and omc in their own colum
B002IV8I80|4|Simple product but it works fine. I mounted a 15&#34; spare to my trailer frame in about 30 seconds. I bought a cover too so it should last a long time.
B004OI7O08|5|Fast shipping, really well packaged. Looks great on my jeep, and it's a strong item. I'm happy with my purchase
B00VBIL0QI|5|Exactly what we were looking for… quick shipping.. thanks
B000C0Y9FA|5|Good part
B006N91C2M|5|Got it on time, good quality
B000C9C1YW|5|Work great. ...the best....
B00UMWZVV4|4|Installed this in my 02 Boxster following a write I found on the 986 forum. The unit works well, but as has been stated, the schematic included is almost worthless. There were misspellings in the directions, and the lock and unlock wires were actually labeled backwards.
B0024EC74M|4|Seem to work well for keeping things from sliding around in a less - than - full rv refrigerator. Easy to move or remove as your needs change.
B00BTSHCXA|4|These are bad ass. Wife and I took them on a test ride yesterday. Sound is great and very clear. Had the bikes up to 80mph and could still hear each other (we do have windshields though). Knocked it down a star only due to range. Advertised as 700 yards but intercom range got very static at 2/10 of a km on the hwy (little over 200 yards) and completely cut out at 275 yards.
B00CFALFXY|5|Excellent product.  Cloths are larger then I was expecting and very easy to handle.  Super soft.  I use them for electronic monitors (smart phone, tablet, computers) and for my new stainless steel appliances - cleaned the stainless steel like a dream. I highly recommend these microfiber cloths for all possible applications.
B003SWNVL2|5|This works great.  It states water resistant, and it is.  It is not waterproof.  We came thru a day of heavy rain and the stuff inside was wet, but not terribly so.  Other than that, great space, easy to tie down and easy to load.  Heavy duty zippers work great.
B006IMNPOC|4|Nice product but didn't fit my mirror
B00RHSEYG4|5|fits perfect and came in at a timely manner
B00498FL8K|5|Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to.
B00IMMC2BS|5|Do you want to increase your braking ability to a much higher level? Install these! Put them on a 1- ton Ford van, used to both haul a lot of tools and also occasional trailering. These rotors make such a substantial difference that they almost defy description. And, the package price that I paid was exceptional ( note: possibly a promo pricing, as they are higher now, but still a good value). The additional cooling that these provide yield a much greater stopping power, giving you far more safety. If you have a vehicle, especially heavy duty, on which you would like to install incredible braking power and safety, install these all four wheels. You will not be disappointedly!
B00SJXEMI6|1|Terrible mount. Shakey, hex screw hole full of paint.  Screw hole plate doesn't line up with the holes on the locking plate. I had to drill new holes all over to get it to fit. I would have been better off to make my own for their price.
B00G9W9Q4Y|4|Great quality of construction.  It stays in place quite well, even over rough fire roads and the easier trails I can navigate on my KLR 650.  There is some handlebar contact at full wheel lock but it doesn't interfere with turning.  I put all my trail tools and tire repair stuff in it and the weight is well placed for balance.  Good investment
B005M2UUEM|5|Fits perfect, looks good, do detach it before going into a car wash or else you will lose it.
B0031GPK96|5|Good price shipped on time everything I needed.
B00CFPJEPU|4|Smaller than I had anticipated but fits in the cup holder nicely.
B00FS66N20|5|Looks awesome on my 33,000lb single axle dump truck wheels. They fit snug and look really sharp.
B0002SQLH6|5|Good price fits perfect
B010CUCRK8|5|Easy instal and looks great!  Product is not flimsy and took about 5 minutes to install.
B000CPI5Z0|5|Made a huge difference in the performance of my wife's 2005 Cadillac SRX V6 engine. They recommend using it every 3000 miles. I'm all in.
B000CMH83S|5|this is a great system and easy to put on. The sound is awesome with no reverb in cab. A lot better than flowmaster.
B00Q7P9BFW|5|Great jacket!! Better than expected.
B000GU11DY|4|Good O.E.M. replacement. Only thing I did not like was I had to buy the battery acid battery came dry would have given it five stars had it came with acid.
B00PLIYNYK|1|Light is bright but color doesn't match betwen the two bulbs. Bulb doesn't turn and lock in to place correctly. Bulb back is huge because of the fan and I had to cut holes behind my headlights to get them back in. Bought new headlight housings to go with thease bulbs and the light is all scattered about because the bulb won't turn all the way.package said h8 not h11 but seller said its a cross fit bulb. Guess I should have bought the more expensive ones or hids.  Would have gave 3 stars if customer service wasn't so bad.
B000BAT622|5|This product was a life savor!  Ok, I messed up on the touch up paint.  And all my efforts to make things look better made them kept dragging me down the rabbit hole.  I went to Maaco, yes, I was that desperate!  The wanted 200 dollars!  To remove the messed up touch up paint, and put a sealing coat over the whole hood.  This is a BMW 328i.  I knew there had to be a better way.  The touch up paint was a week old, with the sealing coat on top.  I did let the product sit a few minutes on the area, because I had applied so much touch up paint, and I had to do it several times, before I could get rid of enough of the paint to follow the directions on the bottle.  But all is well now, and I will never, ever try to touch up my BMW again!  Something my husband is very glad to hear.  And the best news yet, he didn't have a heart attack once I told him what I did!
B000E4SQIA|5|Product was as advertised.  Had it installed for $25 locally and vehicle is doing fine.
B00R26RCVK|5|This cover is a lifesaver...or seat saver.  The cover performs as advertised.  No moisture leaks through to the seat. I wish the company made a similar product to go over the seat belt.
B000E28HWC|5|It fit perfectly, as to performance I haven't notice the difference yet, I'm still running diagnostics.
B005992QKO|1|4 months into owning this lock kit it failed and was stuck on. Thought it was safe went towing a week later and the lock fell off. Luckily the pin staid in. and there is no returns for this product
B002UC8PHQ|5|Exactly what we needed and cheaper than buying from the manufacturer.
B00KTIBY4Y|5|Excellent product
B001J89BHU|5|The mats arrived on time n look fabulous in my brand new car :)
B0007TQWKQ|3|I used this product to repair a cigarette burn. I had a hard time getting the fiber colors to match my seats. In the end, I ended up using a razor blade and scraping fibers from my car seat, it my have been tedious but at least now the color matches and I don't have to worry about mixing the fibers to match the colors.
B000VSCDWO|5|These are good low profile blinkers/running lights. I put them on the rear of my 2004 Kawasaki Ninja and they look good and are bright!!
B000931OEO|1|This stuff is useless
B00UV87XZ6|1|Got the item on time, Went to hook them up in the socket and turned them on waiting for the beautiful shine of a iceberg blue and all i got was a lot of smoke, a burning smell and a little spark... They blew as soon as i hooked them up, the connector pins were in the right place and all looked well but in the end i was left with a big disappointment...
B00VWT4WO8|5|Couldn't be better I had a problem with two of the lights not being the color of the other two but that problem vanished also where you connect the lights to the box the little prongs that stick out one of them or couple of them were pushed in but I got needle nose pliers and pull them out they still work to this day perfectly
B00G8WLW2Y|5|Did exactly what I needed.  No complaints.
B001CEJH6G|1|This doesn't fit Volvo S60 2002 . When I purchased it said that it will fit 2002 Volvo S60 and I tried installing it couple of months later after I purchased it found out its a wrong product. False specification for this product. Don't trust buying from these guys. I cant return it anymore.
B000CDADO8|1|Wrong items.  Was supposed to fit my make of car.
B00ASY7HCM|4|It fits my back are of my 2000 Jeep Wrangler fine.
B000EVPCFS|5|its al ok
B002JH7PEQ|5|This little guy is amax ing. I have it for camping that has no electricity. Blew up three twin air beds and three tubing floats no problem
B00B5ZY07I|5|Like the product, the only small issue is that the distance between a license plate frame and the cap holder may be too small to put the silver caps on.  I had to use a rubber mallet to get mine to seat due to the small distance but once seated they looked great.
B000NKCIWK|5|Fit perfectly, plenty of instructions. Not a huge mpg difference yet(1-2mpg), 2012 ford fusion.
B00J99CABA|5|Perfect fit
B00HXJK8ZI|4|Petite girl 5ft2 ordered xs great snug fit. I returned because, though looks are not most important(the helmet itself looks awesome) in the function of a helmet it was an unacceptable sholder to head ratio. I looked like a comical super bad ass bobble head. I cannot tell you anything about the performance but what I can tell you is it cost me to return however the return was easy and in about a week got full refund.
B00XIQ0T1S|4|Just what I wanted.
B002TS923W|5|I love it
B00JS5XL1S|5|I wanted to try this product in the hopes of avoiding that costly roadside repair, or worst, a tow to a dealer for a tire repair. After reading many positive reviews, I am confident this product will preform as advertised. Contrary to what several people posted, the product did come with a valve stem tool and a plastic tube for installing the product. The tires do not need to be completely deflated, just position the valve stem at 10 or 2 o'clock. Then add the product and re-fill to proper PSI for your tire. After a 1200 mile trip I can report I did not have a flat, or any vibration. I will use this product again when I change tires the next time. Worth the cost in peace of mind alone.
B001EOV492|5|Perfect length and slides in and is tight. No play with the curt receiver.
B001N4QY66|4|I don't have anything else to measure RPM with to compare for accuracy, but the tachometer arrived promptly and in good shape.  Instructions are adequate (basically affix reflective tape to rotating object, then point tach laser at reflective tape while rotating).  Reflective tape supplied is generous (especially since you can apply to any, less permanent tape or surface and reuse one scrap a hundred times).  For really accurate measurements... well, you'd probably be in the market for something else anyway.  For the dirt cheap price, i'm happy.  I used this tachometer on two of my Dewalt cordless drills  with their RPM ranges printed on the tool body, each fitted with a 3&#34; cutting disc, and with both of them this tach read within 100 rpm of the listed range. I'm sure a larger disc would provide greater accuracy.  Oh, and it did smell pretty strongly of cheap plastic when the package was first opened... but the smell fades.
B000E4IGL2|5|arrived i a timely manner, packaged well and fit and worked well
B00LNONJN2|5|Great item, quick shipping
B002AMR6Q2|5|Very impressed. Love it & how it looks on my new car
B000NVW1LM|5|Had a bad trans  &#34;seam&#34; leak  in a 2005 Altima with 244,000 miles and it completly stoppped  leaking within 300 miles!
B000C5DZOG|3|works
B005H7DARG|5|Very nice emblem. I am extremely pleased with this transaction. Thank you.
B002RW244Y|3|Hold up well on our trip for temporary use. They do vibrate some but can get you by until you can install fixed set. I would suggest to sepnd the money on a attached set as I worried sometimes with the stability.
B0081OSRQQ|4|Clay bar works great! Was able to feel a noticeable difference from before I had clayed the area to after. I think the price is okay for what you are getting but I think I may go ahead and try a Mother's Clay kit to see if there is a difference.
B0006MWPZU|2|I was looking for a seat cover to add cushion and back support for a long ride in the car. I found this cover really more annoying than anything else. The lumbar support never really fit right no matter how much I adjusted and it would slide and move around every time you got in and out anyway. It lasted less than a week and is currently in the trunk...
B00YAFWVQC|4|They seem to integrate with the side mirror but there is a little distortion in the product. I don't think they should be that expensive.  More like $4.00a pair.
B00UXG5LU0|5|Easy to install and it works.
B000EDOTH8|1|Tthe bag is too small, gas control knob pokes sharply into the side of the bag and deforms it. Storage bag does not seem like it was custom made for this grill at all, poor fit. It was a waste of money.
B000B68V6I|5|Used STA-BIL for many years for gasoline storage, I actually found it to last much longer than the claim. Never had a carb  problem with gas powered tools from one season to the next.
B002A3MYOK|5|Good
B001NYAUFM|5|Great product
B000C16XL2|5|awesome fit, I was used to replacing the ones on older trucks. Which is horrible on your hands. This took MAYBE 20 mins!!!
B00F66V00M|4|item was good. The first time I ordered I ordered 2, just received 1.  I had to order one more. Quality fine.
B00JMHGDZI|5|This lil tubby is going to work perfectly in our trailer. We bought a new cargo hauler trailer and put a bed and kitchenette in it for camping and travel. The bathroom was on hold till we found this tub. We are pleased with the quality, size and shape of this lil cutie. I want another one now to install in the mud room for washing doggie paws and mops.
B00RV6CDOC|5|excelente...
B0013FXXGE|5|Good product, looks original
B001GAKS8W|5|Good stuff for car A++++++
B000WK45IG|5|these things are great!  if you own a dirtbike, you should own seal savers & get the stitched ones, not the velcro ones.  yes you have to loosen a few bolts to pull the forks, but that takes all of 5 minutes.  when i get a used bike with leaky forks, i rebuild them & install seal savers, have yet to have to rebuild my forks using these.  so, if you have no leaks, get these installed to keep them leak free.  i turn mine inside out, they should make logo free versions, or pay me to rock the logo ha
B001HX9WVM|5|Adhesive
B001OBCZXO|5|great product......
B00G91CJ9Y|5|Fast to install.
B000E65PKK|1|DOES NOT FIT AS IT SAID IT WOULD. THREADS ARE DIFFERENT AND IT IS NOT BEING USED. CANNOT RETURN AS I DID NOT INSTALL IT UNTIL RECENTLY AND RETURN PERIOD ENDED. SAID IT WOULD FIT MY 99 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE GST AND IT DOES NOT. BOUGHT ONE AT AUTO ZONE SINCE AND SCREWED RIGHT IN....  THANKS A LOT FOR WAISTING MY $!!!!!!
B00393V9LO|5|Can't beat this price and quick shipping...
B002IVKZ86|5|these are awesome goggles. Blur discontinued them for some reason. Ive never had a set of goggles work as well as these!
B001J1ZV08|5|Great item!
B0069XERNS|4|Very satisfied. Thx!
B00NRO6X98|5|Thank you it was great
B00371VKVC|4|Did the job. Good price.
B002LGF7C2|5|👌👌👌👌👌👌💛
B004P1YYLQ|5|Very good product and all older RV owners should have one.
B00433SIQI|5|Was kinda intimidated at first. but the window came out great. Going to get more to do the rest of the windows in the house. It is definitely a two person job!
B00BVPYAAE|1|Had to modify it because it would allow the window to roll completely down. Not a real happy or future customer!
B00BPZHGBK|5|Worked as intended
B00UBFXSYE|5|nice look and fit love the price
B007GCDVC4|4|Had to change purpose for the battery the terminals not heavy enough for my  first thought  --- always got another thought...
B00K4SVS2M|4|Great product
B00F8LEB9W|5|PERFECT...just what we needed. Easy to program.
B004GCNIZ2|5|The package came with everything but the inside mirror adjester, which isn't that bad. I would like to have seen a better description of what I was buying. Other than that, the mirror works.
B00N37E5JE|5|Good quality
B00BOEFF8I|1|It doesn't fit and NO instructions
B00W8LR61K|1|horrible tape supplied does not stick, had to take them off my vehicle. ...what a disappointment!
B00NLMEVQI|4|Fit decently for my 1966 Ford mustang but not perfectly
B005QB09DQ|5|It was exactly what was described and delivery was fast.
B000GTTWKE|5|I give this mc cover 5 stars because the d motto stands true, &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. I paid a little more for quality and I am glad I did.  The guide for sizing was perfect.  I have a 600 honda shadow 2007.  The fit is nice and snug.  It has rained several times and each time my bike was dry under the cover.  This brand even had a soft extra barrier underneath for my windshield to prevent scratching.
B00LV3M1A2|5|Great quality
B007F8QE0A|5|Good strong boots use them on the bike and in the truck thank you.
B00407TVTK|5|Pretty close to my Toyota Corolla 2001 red color, I like it
B001C9WTUC|5|So far so good no problem out of the product it was easy to install I have another vehicle I have to do the same thing with I do recommend this product I have worked in a auto parts store and never had any come back by Raybestos company before
B00DRZXRO6|5|In Alaska the midnight sun is always there these are great for room darkening in your RV
B00JAXIXLG|5|Perfect fit
B00K0CN87K|5|Fits perfectly, makes the hand brake feel like it matches the rest of the ST interior a little bit better.
B00J4RAZ96|5|I purchased this for my trunk to keep items from slipping around during daily driving. Sure I'll use it to protect my car when working on it but it's also a nice touch in appearance when you open the trunk.
B000GTIZ8E|5|I am using this with my solar setup to connect LED lights that work on 12V DC.  Awesome!
B010OYOHO6|3|hello
B007568DA6|5|Very easy to install. Less than 5 minutes, they work good. Also they took 100 k miles off the look of the truck :)
B00G1Y3FZG|5|Excelente
B008RAATI8|4|It's pretty small, only about as long as your hand give or take an inch or two. The rain fly is extremely useful for those surprise storms. The map pocket is nice for sticking your phone in (iPhone 6+) or smaller, or some directions but it just isn't big enough for a map. The main compartment can hold a couple pairs of gloves, a pistol or taser or something and anything in your pockets. It's got a small exterior supper compartment on each side, one holds the rain fly, the other is good for sticking your keys in and maybe some anti fog spray or something. That's about it really. The magnets are incredibly effective at holding the bag in place, in fact I'm only using 1/2 of them because the 4 center magnets are on top of a thick leather strip on my tank. They hold up to pot holes and speed bumps at fairly high speed without even sliding an inch. I've got a tank mounted speedometer so I needed this small bag to still see it. Most of you won't have that issue so get the larger ones.
B001JPBGUI|1|hose had a crack in it.  also after a day the fill end spring broke and was just a mess of parts now sitting in my tool box for use as extra parts.
B0013DZBTS|5|Nice to have a functional portapotty again - wasn't too bad getting the old one out and working the new one in, and now it's working perfectly.
B0002KKHS8|4|Good product.
B000GUWPL6|5|Do not damage gasket, stock uses o ring. Have to get gasket from boyesen.
B003RDKDKY|5|Arrived intact, packaged well. Installed, and truck runs great
B00NGBSXI6|1|Light didn't fit my BMW e60 2005 properly.
B006QH6XQG|5|nice new item and fast shipping
B0000AYZ50|5|Just be sure to look at photos. Several are similar but not the same
B00RN90EIE|4|Easy to assemble. Made very well. Would have given 5 stars had I not been missing 2 bolts and and several washers.
B002I0MOY0|5|Great procduct if you do body work
B00Z7KIZPA|5|This is one of best inventions since Spanx and sliced bread.  I love that my big purse (I carry everything!) fits snug and stays in place.  And for my small evening bag, it slid perfectly into the pocket and never slid out.<br /><br />This morning, I was running errands and was able to use the Pocket to hold my list and coupons in place in the pocket while my big purse was snuggly safe.  Having my list and coupons within arms reach meant I did not forget about all the places I had to go to.<br /><br />This Pocket should be in everyone's car - no exceptions.
B00EJA3E1Y|5|Very pleased.  Absolute match as a replacement for the original equipment.
B00HNMLQAG|5|As advertised.
B00BD4SJBO|5|Good quality. Have no problems with it. Fit my dodge ram 1500 seats perfectly.
B0031IBVCY|5|Works perfect. Fast ship
B00BF8N6Q6|5|Finally! These fit a 2014 VW Jetta TDI.  They seem to be better quality than my previous set I paid out my @$$ for at the dealer.
B00R6S0MEI|5|real nice sprayer
B00R6M00DM|5|Perfect compliment to my spray in liner. The liner I had is made by Reflex and has too much grip. You had to physically get in the bed to load things, total pain.  I also have a topper which made things more difficult.<br /><br />The bed mat is awesome and grips just enough. Not to mention that it's easy on the knees if you do have to crawl around in the bed. It's also crazy light and easy to remove for cleaning. A++
B00EFFVXTI|5|Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You.
B00QU6NT7E|5|Nice
B00GXRG64I|5|Great microfibers! Compared to the chemical guys yellow towels, these glide across the car much more easily. The are also much softer and have no edges so there is no chance of scratching. I will definitely be buying more of the Rag Company's lineup. I'll update this review after a few cycles in the wash machine
B00KN19JG2|5|My 4Runner looks even better with this final touch
B001EBDS1M|3|H3 emblem wearing off quite quickly.  Looks to be printed on.
B0033WNIT2|4|I installed this hitch on my 2011 Cadillac SRX - Performance.  The product is fine, and the finish is of high-quality.  The fit is what I wrestled with a bit...  There are two holes on each of the sides of the mount, and one hole on each side of the receiver 2&#34; tube.  After initial fit, only 4 of the 6 holes aligned properly to where you could get the bolt into the threaded holes in the frame.  The upper hole on the passenger side of the mount, and hole on the driver side of the receiver tube were misaligned.  (I used a floor jack and a pry bar very methodically to coax alignment for 30 minutes, but was not successful.)  I scribed a mark where the hole needed to be, and used my Dremel grinder to remove 1/16&#34; - 1/8&#34; of material from each hole.  All six bolt holes then aligned properly and were torqued to specs.<br /><br />A few other reviewers/installers also noted hole misalignment.  Unfortunately, I did not take any measurements of the mounting points on the vehicle or that of the hitch to determine if this defect is that of Curt or GM.
B00KGSCTYG|4|Fits exactly as shown on the bike. Not enough space to put much items in it but good enough for the essentials.
B00IO95QX0|5|We tow a 16,000 lb 5th wheel and brakes are essential. Our Dodge Ram 2500 came from the factory with excellent brakes and I almost went back with OEM pads and rotors but after reading the rave reviews on this product we decided to take a chance. We are very pleased with the results, excellent brakes and much less brake dust on the wheels. I have recommended these to several RV'ers already.
B000BUQODG|5|Fantastic
B0075ZWBUA|4|Love it, makes me laugh every time I walk past the car.
B00WYO2OYK|5|I was hesitant to purchase this but I was impressed with it at the end. My car battery was dead dead dead, I hooked this up and started my car immediately. Since then I have started so many vehicles and the charge is still amazingly full. I have recommended this to so many people I think I should get a gift pack lol. Yhe only complaint I have is that it came with a cable to charge the battery pack but not the part of the charger to plug into the wall
B00KTIVFTS|5|Great so far.  To program just cycle the key on-off 8 times within 10 seconds. Do it really fast until you hear the doors lock. Then just press the unlock button on the key fob.
B00V3RZ2B6|5|direct replacement,works great,will buy again
B001EOV4NS|4|Great service,good price
B00CAKILAO|3|Stated it did not smell=it smells.
