B000002TQV|5.0|I'm reviewing this CD because it's one of those albums that you can forget  about and return to it with a new perspective. I've been listening to this  album a lot lately and every time I do I feel like I'm.....floating. And  not in some stupid Enya sort of sense. Every time Thom Yorke's voice  reaches the crescendo in 'Fake Plastic Trees' or 'Sulk' and the music  builds along with it, I'm in the air. There's no other way to explain and  there's no other way to do it justice.
B0000024K1|5.0|Without a doubt one of the single most important albums in the history of  popular music.  This album started it all.  Hardcore hip-hop on a punk  rock/black power tip.  I'm sure this album has changed people forever.  It  may have dropped in '88 but it still blows away anything in '98.  Don't  call yourself a knowleable rap listener if you don't have this.  Essential!
0446343129|4.0|I read this book years ago and have not been able to locate it locally.  Written by Gloria Swanson's good friend or paramour, I'm not sure which, it  is as good as new titles on the subject of sugar, the enemy. The first part  of the book, where Duffy questions Swanson about what she had to eat at a  cocktail party, is worth the read.  His description of what was in her  stomach could turn anyone off of food.  Catch this one to understand that  diet theories, fads, and programs are usually not new ideas, just a rehash  of common sense information.
B0000024IE|5.0|PE picks up where It Takes a Nation left off.  More politically charged  rap, that comes off just as hard yet still manages to find a seperate sound  from the It Takes a Nation of Millions.  May not be considered as classic  as a whole like It Takes a Nation, but Welcome to the Terrordome is  arguably the greatest hip-hop song ever.  Worth the price for that track  alone.  Chuck D makes no apolgies and keeps slapping America in the face,  with himself, Sadler and company backing it all up with awesome beats.  To  get an idea of where this sound disappeared to, check out Ice Cubes first  record....
B0000047CX|5.0|&quot;Perfect&quot; rythm, instantly captivating.  Jobim was THE composer.   While J. Gilberto's vocals and Getz' tenor sax playing were both renowned  for their extreme clarity of tone, Getz was surprisingly passionate yet  natural sounding, while Gilberto was lowkey but intimate with his old-world  wistfullness.  And what Melody! Plus, no matter what anyone says, Astrud's  vocals are great with that cute little accent.  YOU CAN _NOT_ GO WRONG WITH  THIS ALBUM!!! Good for conversation-heavy get-togethers, dancing, romantic  nights of quiet stars, relaxing, and especially just for listening to.  It  earns every quiet star it gets.
B000003S5H|4.0|I bought this completely on a whim, after a freak encounter with the video  for &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; late one night, which was funny in a dry way that  reminded me of an Aki Kaurismaki film.  If you understand French, the  lyrics to that song are even funnier (&quot;un jour je serai beau comme un  dieu&quot;).  The album as a whole is...lush, beautiful, modest, and quite  reminiscent of &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;-era Beach Boys, although its optimism  has no tragic dimension (nothing wrong with that).  Music like this is easy  to degrade (or appreciate) as kitsch, &quot;retro,&quot; mood-music or  what-have-you, but it seems to me to exist in a space between naivete and  irony, hard to pin down and all the better for it.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Wedding Singer seeking goth rock androginous she-male wishing to rock the  hell outta dodge and pay homage to the Duke. Great oppurtunities and great  results. I think the response to this ad from Manson was heard loud and  clear from the first note. Concepts, changes, and shockers, Mechanical  Animals is a must for any fan on MUSIC period. Manson is Gene Simmons in a  much brighter light. Thanks Brian Warner for becoming a musician.
0205191584|5.0|I bought my first copy of THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE nearly thirty years ago,  when I was 13 years old.  It cost me one dime, in a thrift shop.  That is  still the best dime I've ever spent.<br />THE ELEMENTS OF STYLE is  indispensable for anyone who wants to write.  It distills the essence of  writing clear, direct, logical prose.  I read it four times a year; in  addition, I read it again whenever I am about to begin a large writing  project.  This book has shaped every word I've ever written, and it has  taught me more than I can say about life.  That may sound weird or  idiosyncratic, but it's not -- for the principles that guide the writing of  clear, direct, logical English prose are the same principles that guide a  life of integrity and commitment.  Writing honestly and clearly is the  surest path to living honestly and clearly.<br />Buy it, read it, reread it,  live by it.  You won't be sorry.
6304233639|1.0|This movie epitomizes everything that's wrong with Hollywood moviemaking  today.  A ludicrous plot, stock characters, pathetic dialog and a host of  other ills make it unsuitable for anyone with an intellectual age in excess  of 12.     END
0060977493|4.0|The book lives up to its hype - it is entertaining, the characterizations  are well-etched and captivating. Estha really tugs at your heart, and  Rahel's mental torture is brilliant in its silence. The visual writing  style was appealing in its uniqueness. I did have a couple of the  proverbial bones to pick with the author - why did the twins have to end up  the way they did ? I felt the twins' fate was thought up as a  commercialisation, something twisted to attract readers. I felt it was  wholly unnecessary. And the use of the word 'laterite' with such relentless  and unnecesary frequency irritated me. Why 'laterite'???
B00000AFDW|4.0|Paul's voice has never been so good! ~- in my opinion, all the songs on  the disc are great ones with only one exception. well mybe two; i think the  song dreamin' is a poor song that sounds like it was left off of carnival  of souls and the song 'i have finally found..' sung by peter - weak. the  entire disc seems to be a good combination between 'crazy, crazy nights'  and 'destroyer.'
B000002UZ4|5.0|While these boys have put out some great albums, its the singles we  remember, and they're all here in this outstanding collection.  Whether you  are new to the Pet Shop Boys or an old fan, you will love this album.  It  is my #1 choice to take with me if I ever got stranded on a desert island.
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light, Madonna's new spectacular CD shows her at her musical best.    She has moved from clearly being the Material Girl to the Ethereal Girl.   With a new techno sound and high callibre electronica, Ray of Light, is  destined to be one of the Hottest Albums of the Year.   Ciccone deserves a  Grammy for this one.
0688158234|5.0|I found I could not put this book down.  Its amazing to me the drive Waris  had in life to get where she wanted.  Its sometimes funny, sometimes sad  but so interesting to see how far she has come and what its really like  coming from someplace so foreign to most of us.  Its made me rethink a lot  I take for granted.  Great book.
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is Manson's best album yet.  Unlike Antichrist Superstar he sings  about things that affect all of us.  He constantly is reminding us that  drugs do run our society.  &quot;The Dope Show&quot; is the best song on  the album.  But the others are not far behind. In his past albums Manson  constantly screamed his lyrics.  This happens only a few times in  &quot;Mechanical Animals&quot;.  I particulary like the song that has a  70's sound and backup singers.  If you are looking for variety from one  artist, Marilyn Manson is your man? woman? mannequin? Who knows and who  cares!
0375402675|2.0|I found the book slow moving and over weight.  There was too much detail  and meaningless info.  It felt like he was writing to fill pages rather  than fill out the story.  Once he got off the soap box, the action was  typical Clancy; good.  But there wasn't enough of it.  This is by far his  worst book.  I was extremely disappointed, it took me 5 weeks to finish as  it never really grabbed me by the throat.
B000005ILF|4.0|but still, being Sting, he's better than about 90 percent of the artists  out there.  I think my favorite would have to be &quot;La Belle Dame Sans  Regret&quot;, which shows flashes of his clever self (more easily heard in  &quot;Ten Summoner's Tales&quot;).  If you only buy one Sting album, let it  be Ten Summoner's Tales, and if you buy two, get Tales and the Best Of  collection...but I have this one as my third, and I like it a lot.
0812550706|5.0|I have read a lot (a lot) of science fiction in my lifetime, and only two  books have forced me to read them straight through without stopping,  skipping classes and sleep.  The other is Heinlen's Starship Troopers.   Phenomenal book.
B000003NA4|5.0|Wonderful music, beautifully performed, with a rare combination of passion  and self-restraint. While Diana Krall is out front with her sensuous voice  and fine piano playing, this is truly a great jazz group effort. Russell  Malone's guitar work especially caught my ear -- never too few notes, nor  too many, always a complement to the group's performance of each song. So  good I gave the CD to a friend and fellow guitarist and I'm buying it  again!
0385484518|5.0|Death of the body is an inescapable part of life; but death of the spirit  during the process of dying is a choice.  Each of us has a personal belief  system about what happens to the spirit after death occurs; but no matter  what your's is, this book has at least one lesson to offer you to enhance  the life you are living now.  Mitch Albom has given all of us the  opportunity to share with him in Morrie's mentorship, a gift for which I  will always be most humbly grateful.<br />Morrie's lessons aren't geared to  any one age or stage of life.  I firmly belive that our youth as well as  our elders will respond to this book with a true opening of the spirit, and  come away with insights they might never have received otherwise. If you  were planning to read only one more book in your lifetime, I would  definitely recommend that this be the one.
B000001ES4|5.0|Secret Garden is in my enduring &quot;to keep&quot; category, surviving  several prunes as I run out of storage (with three towers).<br />The music  tiptoes into Irish territory, without being to easily type-cast. It is  ambient, without being boring, a touch moody yet not saddening.
0802130208|5.0|I first discovered this book almost ten years ago while in high school. I  even managed to choose it for a history book report as the teacher  obviously thought the story was about the war. Toole is a greater writer  and it is a shame that we will never be able to read any other of his  potential works. The main character is a sad, pathetic man who lives at  home but looks at the world as if he is the only normal one around. He  spares no expense in puting down his poor Mama and her cohorts. Really,  this books is full of humor and you have to like Ignatious even though he  is a pompous, gas-bloated recluse. Set in New Orleans, we get a glimpse of  just some of the odd-balls that run into our narrator.  I've read this book  many times and each reading brings more laughs.
0345409671|3.0|I have read the other 4 vampire books (as well as Pandora) and this was  not her best...in fact it could be pretty slow going at times (although not  as excrutiating as &quot;Violin&quot;).  If you want a good one, read  &quot;The Witching Hour&quot; or &quot;The Vampire Lestat.&quot;  And what  is the deal with killing Armand (so stupidly)?  Her new book is an Armand  chronicle.  Does that make sense?
B000002BYD|5.0|After the solemn No Code hit shelves last year, it appeared that Pearl Jam  was sliding into that category of rockers that traded in thrashing electric  riffs for aocustic strumming. Yield brings Pearl Jam back to its grunge  days with sophistication and maturity added to the flavor. They display  this new attitude on Brain of J, the album's first song and an excellent  way to set it's tone. Wishlist and All Those Yesterdays show that Eddie  Vedder has become an even more skilled frontman. The dissident of the  album, Push Me, Pull Me, seems out of place but in a some strange way, fits  in with the varied collection of all together excellent music on Yield.
B00000AFDW|4.0|Having been a Kiss fan for many years i have heard them go from great to  average to downright awful. There last CD &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was  just terrible. I had high expectations for Psycho Circus and on first  listen i was unsure. However after living with the disc for a few days now  i'm beginning to be reminded of why they were so popular when they were  originally first around.  The opening title track is killer and i keep  playing it over and over again. Other stand out tracks are &quot;I Pledge  Allegiance to the State of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, &quot;Into The Void&quot;  &amp; &quot;Raise Your Glasses&quot;. There is unfortunately one flaw in  this great album.......&quot;I Finally Found My Way&quot;......Why did they  let Peter Criss do this? Lets face it...he sounds terrible and the song is  just boring ballad fodder.  All in all its a grower of a cd and i do think  it will be looked upon as a great Kiss album.   The packaging is also great  and the whole concept superbly sets the stage for a stunning theatrical  live show.  We wanted the best...........and we got it!!!!!!!!!
B000002GQG|5.0|i still have a reel to reel tape that i bought when i was in viet nam.  needless to say i've not heard it in 30 years,not only is the lirics  astonding,mesmerizing,but the sound of this recording is to be guardingly  cherished.i hope they never stop.

B000007SPT|3.0|This is not a new album, as shown in the Amazon specs.  This is a 1998  re-release of a 1984 production.  Still, very nice.  We all wish they made  more.  It goes to show you how far ahead of the times TMC was in 1984.
0399143904|1.0|As a lay person Clancy reader, I am greatly disappointed by Rainbow Six.   I say I am a lay person, because Clancy, who never met a weapons system he  didn't like, spends entirely too much time giving technical stats, alphabet  soup + numbers for simple descriptions of items.   But, all of that is  typical Clancy.  I usually skip the sections of massive and tediously  technical descriptions and stay with the dialogue of the main characters  and do just fine.  But, in this story, I began to wonder whether the  defense industry has created new toys which Clancy read about,  then  structured a story so that those new hi-tech kill 'em toys could be  show-cased?<br />I am greatly disturbed by something ugly that seemed to rear  its head in this book.  There were repeated ignorant generalizations about  Africa in the text of Rainbow Six.<br />In one instance,  He says:  &quot;  ...what African country has a proper air-defense network..&quot;  Mr.  Clanceyneeds to ask one of his airforce friends whether they want to  overfly South Africa, Egypt, Angola or Lybia without warning.<br />Later he  says:  &quot;..Africa was not yet a hot bed of international law and  integrity...&quot; Wow.. what an unfair condemnation of all 53 African  countries.  I found that uninformed generalization about Africa to be  highly insulting.<br />Still later he says, &quot;.. Africa.. where countries  lacked the infrastructure to do much of anything.&quot;  Really?  How  uninformed can Clancy be?  Just because it isn't on network news doesn't  mean it doesn't happen.  The infrastructure throughout southern Africa is  more high tech and well developed than in areas of rural Mississippi or  Lousinana or in the Applacians.  Clancy, travel or read more about Africa  so that you can make better statements.<br />On top of all of that... Clancy  chooses unfortunate adjectives.  I counted five uses of the adjective  &quot;niggardly&quot; and &quot;niggling.&quot;  These are two words that  get too closeto the n-word for my tastes.  In this era of trying to be  politically correct whenever practicable, perhaps choosing another  adjecitve for &quot;stingy&quot; would be better?  Five usages of that  adjective are a bit much don't you think?<br />Then, Clancy's premise bothers  me.  God help us when an elite SWAT group sets itself up as judge, jury and  executioner answerable to no elected body or official, yet with full  ability to use equipment paid for by those very tax-payers cut out of the  loop.  Just the idea of this European/Anglo police force going across  borders to implement their form of law and order is scary.<br />But, this is  only a story.  In parts, a nice story.  I like Ding and Clarke.  I liked  most of the characters, like Popov.  But, so many of the events were  predicable like the hostage taking of the two Clark women and the usage of  all of the high tech toys that were on display.<br />Clancy missed the mark by  a mile this time.  Rainbow Six is a dud.
B000002MP2|5.0|It is the best of their 3 Reprise records. &quot;Dookie&quot;  is my fav.  even though this is an old CD I still listen to it as if it just came out  yesterday.  My fav song is &quot;Longview&quot;.<br />P.S. Green Day  ROCKS!!!!!!!!!
B0000028VT|5.0|This is by far Mariah's best cd! I don't know if she'll ever be able to  top this masterpiece. &quot;Emotions&quot; didn't do that much for me, but  &quot;Music Box&quot; blew me away. I love Mariah's sweet, girl next door  kind of personality. I hope you never change, Mariah.
6304711891|5.0|This is my favorite Action movie of all time. Connery is great as always.  Cage plays a reluctant hero who really comes across as reluctant. You can  tell he doesn't want the job he is forced in to. There is also sympathy for  Ed Harris's character. I found myself hoping that he would succeed in  getting his demands. Great action sequences, great dialog, Just GREAT!!     END
0395324416|5.0|In this &quot;follow-up&quot; to The Silmarillion and LOTR you find a  literal treasure chest of knowledge concerning tales of Middle Earth. The  Tale of the Children of Hurin is one of the best stories I have ever read,  the essays on the Istari and the Druidain reveal two of the mysteries in  LOTR, and The Battle of the Fords of Isen and Cirion and Eorl will give you  good insight on the troubles of Gondor and Rohan in the Third Age. It also  contains two rarely mentioned parts of LOTR; one being Aldarion and  Erendis, a tale concerning a King of Numenor, and the other tells of the  entire hunt for the Ring as seen by the enemy. I recommend this book to any  Tolkien fan. You will read this book time and time again and simply revel  in the quantity of information it gives you.

0399143904|1.0|Well Tom you finally did it..740 pages (hardcover) of slow reading,  repetetive, predictible nothingness. John Clark the &quot;Dark Side of Jack  Ryan&quot; is nothing but a suit and tie white collar whimp. Ding Chavez  must have 240&quot; thighs from all of the working out he did. The Rainbow  Commandos well, I hope that I can read more comic book stories to my 7 year  old about virtually invicible heroes like these guys,the X-Men,and Sergeant  Rock.<br />I hear there is a new &quot;Techno-Thriller&quot; coming out called  &quot;Tree Squad Six&quot;. They are an elite group of commandos who seek  out and destroy authors who kill trees for the sake of wasting 740 pages of  paper on...well..books that are just plain bad.

0790736322|5.0|I first read the book &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, when I was about 14. It  didn't make alot of sense then, but the next time around - wow! Scary book.

0399143904|3.0|Clancy's skill for technothrillers has not escaped him, but his plot  (which to my mind is far too similar in its bio-technology content to  Executive Orders) lacks the essential realism which makes a book of this  kind a real winner. We have to be able to believe not only the characters  but their actions, and Clancy's thinly-vieled sideswipe at ecological  groups is at best crass and at worst a PR disaster. Portraying these groups  as potential genocidal maniacs is not based in reality only in the vaguest,  most bizarre &quot;what-if&quot; of one's imagination. Not something to  write a 740 page novel about. The action is well done, and the characters  are progressing well, though I would have preferred more on Ryan and how he  handles the presidency, and less on Clark, whom we spent an entire novel  with in &quot;Without Remorse&quot;, Clancy's best book, in my opinion.  There was insufficient background to make the bio-war plot in any way  believeable, and the background scenes that were included were virtually  carbon-copies of the similar scenes in &quot;Executive Orders&quot;. A  little more variety, please. And, one small point, as a Brit myself, I got  a little tired of Clancy's over-egged Britishisms, which stretch realistic  use of the language to breaking point, even the brand of English used in  the armed forces. At the same time, the use of American English by Clark  and Chavez is similarly unrealistic - does anyone have the mental capacity  and dexterity to actually _speak_ like that? Not only does no-one even  pause for breath before emitting these clever and witty utterances, they  seem to form part of the everyday American language. Not so, in my  experience! I look forward to more from Clancy, though the Op-Centre series  is failing rapidly. We need more on Ryan and the presidency, and it does  not have to be another global conspiracy, just a well-told story, sticking  to the point and not trying to shoot down groups of the public with whom  Clancy does not agree. Put all that stuff on the back burner and simply do  what you are good at - entertain us.
B0000029J5|5.0|A truly riveting blues escapade for a phenominal new artist.
B000006NPY|5.0|In my opinion, this is clearly the Album of the Year! Of course, i am a  big SP fan. I rank this as a close second behind Siamese Dream. There are  many beautiful songs on this album, including To Sheila, For Martha and  Once Upon A Time. Ava Adore and Perfect are great songs too. Heck, they are  all great songs. I think Billy Corgan is a music genius and i am sure we  can expect great things from the Smashing Pumpkins in the future!
1573226521|5.0|Not outstanding, but definately readable.  Yeah yeah, yeah..it's Lord of  the Flies meets pop culture, but there seems to be something more to it.   What that something is is rather elusive.  I only know that it was enough  to make me fly through the book even though I was pretty sure how things  would turn out in the end.  And it's never *completely* predictable.  If  your looking for a good vacation book, consider this one.  Do not, however,  look for any deep meaning.  Or really any depth, period.<br />Additionally, I  have to say that I was rather bewildered to hear that Leonardo DiCaprio is  to play the character Richard in a movie version.  It'll be hard enough to  make a reasonably faithful film version of The Beach.  Why add miscasting  into the mix?

B000003TSP|5.0|I really like &quot;Dummy&quot; but this album is one of my favorite  albums of all time (and I have a lot of records). The songs on this album  are catchier and really stick in your head. Though it lacks  &quot;Mysterons&quot; and &quot;Sour Times&quot;, which were my favourites  from their debut album, they make up for it with great songs like  &quot;Half Day Closing&quot;, &quot;Cowboys&quot;, &quot;All Mine&quot; and  &quot;Only You&quot;. This CD is also much eerier than their earlier album.  &quot;Cowboys&quot; and &quot;Half Day Closing&quot; are songs that you  wouldn't want to listen to while you're alone. A fantastic album. You'll be  hooked.
0316548189|5.0|I read &quot;long walk to freedom&quot; a few years ago. It stills remains  so strong in my mind. Mr.Mandela's struggle for his people is  un-precidented in our lifetime. Hail to Mr.Mandela. We should all take a  look at his life and learn from it.  A must read for everyone!!!!
B000001FA4|5.0|This might not be 'Joshua Tree,' but then again, 'Joshua Tree' ain't no  'Unforgettable Fire.'  &quot;Bad&quot; is arguably one of the best songs  ever, and while there might not be as many stand alone singles as U2's  later releases, it's one of their best albums if you listen to it in its  entirety.  It's almost Pink Floyd-like in that regard.  I give it 5 stars  in part because it is the album that made me a U2 fan in the early 80's.   In other words, nostalgia points.

0393317552|2.0|Upon finishing &quot;Guns, Germs &amp; Steel&quot; I am left with the  regret of having to plow through 400 pages of belabored, repetitious text,  which is actually encapsulated in several essential ideas, while not being  spared the redundancy of details, at times, insulting in their obviousness;   particularly when the predicable explanations extrapolate to circumstances  and aspects discussed almost throughout the book.  The offense is that much  more grave since individuals interested in &quot;Guns, Gems &amp;  Steel&quot; are likely to want to be spared the didactic, pedagogical and  might I add monotonous style J.D. inflicts on us and enter the material at  a slightly more advanced level.<br /> In all fairness ,The analysis of the  factors impacting the trajectories of cultures and societies are thorough,  too!, astutely addressed and analyzed, them being:   · Congenial  geoclimatic environments: Mediterranean basin, fertile crescent, etc. ·  Definitely the EW latitudinal axis of Euro-Asia vs NS axis of Africa and  the Americas · Domestication head start and sedentarism · Monolithic China  vs splintered Europe · To a lesser degree the germ theory · The alphabet<br />  Conspicuously absent, due to a lack of stomach for provocation on the part  of J.D., is the issue of GENES to which marginal feeble allusions are being  made in the epilogue Pg. #417,  &quot;The hand of history's course at 8,000  BC lies heavily on us&quot; no kidding!   The inability to escape the moral  Jewdeo Christian prism by hypothesizing on the reverse outcomes &quot;had  Incas been Eurasians then&quot;... and the assertion that &quot;if  only&quot; then every human being on the planet would be at the same level  of development and no one would have miserable, wretched stone age lives,  or depending on the point of view, miserable, alienated space age lives.    This inability prevents, the &quot;this is the way it is&quot; type of  analysis and laces the antro-socio-historical work in the West with  scruples antithetical to pre II WW theories and analysis, which, granted  were hysterical in the emphasis of race, archetypal humans and hegemony  ...<br /> The lame conclusion that the outcome was determined to such an  extreme extent by geoclamatic imperatives, ignores the phenomenon of HUMAN  SPIRIT. In concrete terms the innate tendency of Humans in all stages to  enhance their HUMANNESS and thus to ameliorate the condition of HUMANITY  despite the horrid, murderous setbacks of which history is full.<br />  &quot; Guns, Germs &amp; Steel&quot; ought not be about on other species of  animals and studied as such ; it is about HUMANS.  We are special, we are  better, we are superior, we are the crown, the miracle of existence on this  planet and probably in the planetary neighborhood .
B000002UB3|5.0|While it famous as Beatles' true last album, this one needs no such tag to  recommend it. Its a classic. The Dark Horse George Harrison puts out two of  his best songs here. He also leaves out the Sitar, Saarang and tablas to  give the album a conventional feel. The lyrics are fascinating and  mysterious. Can't mention any song though.. all of them are excellent. I've  been listening to this album for the last 14 years and still haven't tired  of it. Now thats a good investment!
B000003JDA|3.0|There are a few top-notch songs on this CD, including: Beside Myself, Free  Will and Valley. To compare it to Yanni is absurd.  This is a masterfully  performed rock collection with a very serious lyrical slant.  Sometimes  grim but very interesting.
B0000025HU|5.0|Can you believe that was the tag line for many of the band's record ads in the early 80s? Who came up with that? It's still true.... Sure call me nostalgic... but the apocalyptic propulsion of the song \\"London Calling\\" is beyond all sentiment, all cheap \\"punk rock\\" revivalism--it ushered in a new way of hearing rock music. Long before Paul Simon's \\"Graceland\\" and rap, before Rancid, Green Day and Sublime (bleh!), before hardcore and World Music, before MTV and politcal correctness, Buzz Clips and CD's, before the anguish of Cobain and Vedder, the Clash were the band who forged boldly ahead into vast musical landscapes, political loggerheads, and the role of the pop star in a sterile social climate.<br />Leaving behind the one-dimensional fury of 70s punk but not its creative, and often times violent, energy and passion, the Clash created a double-album (to the dismay of their record company CBS) of such imagination, ferocity, playfulness, and integrity that I stand chilled and in awe before it. Rank this one with \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" \\"Exile on Main St,\\" \\"Sgt Pepper\\" and \\"Raw Power\\" as one of those pieces of popular art possessed by undeniable genius, shattering all boundaries and leaving many to gape dumbfounded in its wake.<br />I love \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" with is irresistable rhythm and heartfelt, plaintive, postmodern chorus: \\"I went to the market to realize my soul/But what I need I just don't have....\\" How about the romanticism of \\"Spanish Bombs\\"? One of my top three fave Clash songs ever, and these lines that break my heart every time: \\"Spanish bombs shatter the hotels/My seniorita's rose was nipped in the bud.\\" The raw rockabilly of \\"Brand New Cadillac\\"... the Phil Spector-esque \\"Card Cheat\\"... the trashy reggae of \\"Revolution Rock\\"...the satire of yuppie coke addiction and consumer culture in \\"Koka Kola\\"... the mythologising of \\"Death or Glory\\"... the sensitive pop of \\"Lost in the Supermarket\\"... the exquisite classic \\"Train in Vain\\".... The anti-establishment critique of \\"Clampdown\\":<br />(\\"Kick over the wall/Cause governments to fall/ How can you refuse it?/Let fury have the hour/Anger can be power/Didja know that you can use it?\\"<br />This is rock'n'roll dizzy with its own creative forces, all wrapped up in a fabric of American influences, as well as the too-often overlooked reggae flavors: the Clash conquered rock for the eighties, paving the way for bands like U2 and Public Enemy, trying to steal airwaves away from the phoniness of Aerosmith (ironic, huh? The Clash long gone, while that travesty shambles on, the result of consumer demographics and millions of dollars worth of video lighting, record production, and plastic surgery), injecting rock with a fierce political stance, sometimes confused, sometimes idealistic, sometimes too complex for mass consumption, sometimes brilliantly condensed....<br />I could go on forever about what makes the Clash the greatest of all British rock bands since the Stones. Two years in a row they won the Village Voice polls for best album (this one and \\"Sandinista!\\") and today you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who could name a song by them other than \\"Rock the Casbah\\" or \\"Should I Stay.\\" I'm so bored with the USA indeed... Buy this album if you care at all about vision, integrity, creativity, and fighting oppression in music. \\"London Calling.\\" The Clash. No reunion tour.

B00000DCWQ|5.0|Songs From the Wood is a superb album, fusing all the elements that  made/make Tull special.  The decidedly woodsy tone was, and still is, a  treat. I often wonder why Ian never scored one of the many U.K. themed  films.<br />My kids, even though poisoned by Spice Girls and Back Street Boys,  ask me to play Hunting Girl (they don't understand the lyrics!) and  Whistler all the time.<br />Nearly every song is a winner.
B0000062Y2|1.0|This album sounds very interesting, and as far as I've been able to listen  to it, the music itself can be great. BUT the quality of the recording is  so awful that I coudn't listen at it as I would have liked to. This really  is a pity. If you like clean sounds, don't buy this CD.<br />BTW there are no  lyrics included. At this price, it hurts.
0060977493|5.0|The is the most enjoyable book I have read in years! The story is  interesting, tragic and very well told. However, it is the refreshingly  new, clever and bold writing style that took my breath away. I gasped. I  cried. I Laughed Heartily. I was amazed that anyone could be so clever with  the playful and forceful use of words. I can't wait for more !
B000000WFZ|5.0|I have had this CD for more than 4 years and I never tire of its  soul-purging melodies. It has simple melodies underpinned by the  unfathomable pain, sorrow and joy that only love can inspire.
0688052304|4.0|As another reviewer said, if you read a part of this book and don't get  into it, put it down and wait for the right time.  This book has so much to  offer, but you need to want to listen.  This is a book for one who is  disillusioned with themselves and everything this ****ed up world appears  to offer.  It reveals your own inadequacies with such a caring hand because  the author knows them in himself.  Reading this book, I found someone  talking about their own pain.  This isn't a book aimed at healing the  world.  It's a book about stopping and looking at yourself and all the  clasifications you make of other people and how quickly we blow off people  when we really should be (and in actuality are) blowing ourselves.  At the  right time it's just a book that makes you realise you're not alone but you  are stupid.  Who can ask for more than to be reminded of that.
0140430148|1.0|I had to read this for an English class and found it to be the most boring  thing I have ever written.  The author babbles endlessly about inane  subjects; the plot is boring and the ending disapointing.  The  entertainment value is non existent and there is nothing in this so called  &quot;classic&quot; even remotely interesting.  I beg of you, spare  yourself and get another book.
B000002LGW|5.0|I grew up with the songs in this CD when I was a teenager during the  &quot;New Wave&quot; age, before they broke out in America, and, together  with A-ha, this music collection vividly captures that spectacular time for  me. &quot;Somebody&quot; expressed the greatest emotion I had at that time,  but don't get me wrong -- there are some great danceable tunes here which  defined &quot;hip&quot; for the 90s. A definite must for those who just  enjoy great fine music.
0380778556|5.0|I enjoyed Rebecca very much, which surprised me, since I prefer action  stories and generally dislike books written by women.  There were times  when I wished more would happen, but the author's fine writing made up for  any slow parts.  I can see why this book has become a classic, and I  heartily recommend it to anyone who appreciates fine writing.  Daphne  DuMaurier truly exhibits a rare talent for prose.
B00000BKDV|5.0|The fourth release by maiden is in my opinion the best.  I am a huge fan  so it's hard for me to say this is the best.  Songs like the trooper,  flight  of icarus, and to tame a land are what maiden are all about to me.   The album is a great trip with each song becoming an epic story.  The only  song I can ever say I don't like, however is die with your boots on.
B000002KL3|4.0|With songs like Fools, In A Simple Rhyme, and Rome Delight, it's no wonder  I keep coming back for more !!!!!!!!!!
B000005843|4.0|karl willets and Co. have slowly improved release after release.  The  album is a little more clean sounding and you can tell one song from the  next without listening for the lyrics.  Still, For Victory is great war  metal and worth listening to.
B0000048CX|5.0|This is a beautiful record. <br />Although this CD consists mainly of covers,  it remains lush and atmospheric, and very original.  This record is  beautiful, and will be considered so for a long time. The track, 'What  Comes Next' is what Luscious Jackson will be aspiring to for the rest of  their careers.  Other tracks, like 'Andalucia', and 'What Can I Say' are a  bit more quaint and inviting, but few will argue that retro-rock doesn't  get much better than this.<br />If this is your first listen to Yo La Tengo,  it will be misleading; subsequent CDs such as 'Painful' and 'Electr-O-Pura'  are much more hard- edged and raw.  'Fakebook' will also get you there, and  in a much more tender and engaging way.<br />For 'Yo La Tengo' fans new and  old, this is an important recording.
0446343129|5.0|I will admit that a lot of this book did seem like anti-sugar propaganda.   When I say propaganda, I mean that the author was, at times, writing with  more emotion than fact.  Because of all the excellent points &amp; the lead  to macrobiotics, though, I still give it 5 stars.  Some &quot;facts&quot;  should be taken with a grain of salt &amp; some of the material is a little  outdated (this book is as old as me!).  Still, I couldn't put it down.  I  have always been a sugar fiend, but I now have not eaten refined sugar for  several months.  An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.  <br />I  always read food labels now.  Even foods like Earthgrains bagels (that  advertise themselves as being healthy) have refined sugar!  This book will  definitely change the way you look at processed food.  It also tells the  different ways refined sugars are hidden: brown sugar, corn syrup,  molasses...I was on my last nerve trying to figure out why I was constantly  tired.  No one could seem to figure it out.  I tried this just for the heck  of it &amp; I am a new woman.
B000002E5J|5.0|Shakira has a very raspy voice which makes this a great album.  She  reminds me allot of another rocker Alanis Morissete.  The songs are well  written. My favorite song is Estoy Aqui.
6300274268|5.0|Walt Disney has brought to life many classic children stories, and Lewis  Carroll's Alice in Wonderland could be no exception. The Disney Company  actually mixed both Alice's stories (&quot;Alice's Adventures In  Wonderland&quot; and &quot;Through The Looking Glass&quot;) into one,  resulting and extraordinary masterpiece with beautiful animation,  extraordinary music, unforgettable charachters and all the non-sense of  that wonderful place called Wonderland. A true Disney classic.     END
B00000AFDW|5.0|I have waiting for this in 20 years now, and I don't dissepointed at all,  great CD
0812504488|5.0|I have always loved Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, and I liked Stevenson's  novel for the same reasons.  Man tries to play God, but God always  prevails.  This book is a classic page turner...it only took me a couple of  hours to read it.  A must-read for all those out there who support the  cloning movement.
B000002OAZ|5.0|You can not go wrong with this album, if you dont like it someone better  check your hearing. The &quot;band&quot; for these sessions have been key  members of some of the greatest bands in rock and roll history.  Clapton,  Winwood, Watts, Wyman, and Ringo Starr all play exquisitely during the  peaks of the their careers.  If this CD does not move your feet then stick  to the Spice Girls.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This is an album for everyone, male and female. The fact is, Lauryn Hill  has talent period. This is not an album defined by gender. Too often in  hip-hop women are second class citizens, our voices and our issues pushed  in the background. Hard core rap fans might not like this because Lauryn  Hill doesn't front like other artists and talk about the street or how many  gats she has, or how many blunts she smoked. She writes about her ACTUAL  LIFE. She DOESN'T LIE. I appreciated that. If you didn't get that, then you  need to take a long look at yourself. She is no less fabulous an artist  because she is a woman. She is the future of hip hop, and all those hatas  need to recognize that.
0062502182|5.0|If you are thinking of buying this book, ask yourself first: Do I have the  courage to follow my dreams? Do I have any dreams? This lovely little story  of the shepherd - don't heavenly messages always come to the lowly? - who  overcomes all obstacles to reach a treasure is an old one, and you have  heard it told many ways before.  But that does not at all detract from the  joy of reading the story again.  It is timeless, belonging in the category  of archetypal stories that fill the mythologies of cultures across history  and across the world. So the writing is not perfect; most of us don't read  Portuguese and must read a translation. So the story is simple.  So what!  The theme is universal, you will recognize the truth of the message, and  you will simply feel good when it's over. We need a new fable like this  every decade or so.
B000009SFR|5.0|One of their finest albums, TFF's SONGS FOR THE BIG CHAIR, borrows  significantly from John Lennon's seminal album PLASTIC ONO BAND and the  Beatles'(and, surprisingly the Beach Boys--listen to the harmonies)ABBEY  ROAD.<br />This, TFF's second album, examines much of the same themes as the  first(THE HURTING), but is superior in every aspect. Clearly Orzabal's  songwriting became more ambitious and had begun to mature. This album  represents some of TFF's best and best known material. The sound on MSF's  remastered edition amazes--it makes the original cd issue sound like a bad  tape.<br />Well worth the investment this is one of the seminal 80's albums.
6304711891|5.0|This movie is the single greatest action movie ever. IT packs high power  stars (Cage, Connery, and Harris) along with a heart pumping soundtrack by  Hans Zimmer and the gang, and tops it all off with the high voltage  producers Bruckheimer and Simpson (Days of Thunder, Crimson Tide,  Armageddon and Con Air [last two are Bruckheimer alone]). Micheal Bay  brings his unque style of non stop camera movements seen in the 'Aaron  Burr' milk commercial as well as Bad Boys and Armageddon. Be prepared for  one hell of a blast.  -Nate (natez@iname.com)     END
0399143904|2.0|Most of the time I look forward to reading and immersing myself in a Tom  Clancy novel, but Rainbow Six the book doesn't fill the bill.  The  characters in this book do not come alive.  In previous Tom Clancy books  with Clark and Chavez, they had depth, you could understand what motivated  them and they seemed like real people put into impossible situations.   Rainbow Six didn't get the job done!?  The personal dialogue between The  Clark and The Chavez families was especially disappointing in its  blandness.  The  emotional reactions of these two families to the  &quot;jobs&quot; Rainbow Six has to do are almost non- existent.  This is  the first Tom Clancy novel or nonfiction book I have not recommended to my  friends!      I think Mr. Clancy needs to spend more time on his character  development and less on &quot;Gadgets&quot;.      I also wonder how much of  this book was written to sell his new Computer game of the same name?  At  least in that game, 2-Dimesional characters are understanable due to  technological limitations.  What the excuse for this does Mr. Clancy have?          I hope the next book Mr. Clancy writes will improve in this area.  I  am going to read reviews next time before I buy another of his books.
B00000AFDW|5.0|I was waiting for this cd for a long time. At fisrt, I did not know what  to expect. After hearing each song, I taught to my self, this is the best  one. Now that I've heard the album, they're all pretty good.<br />They finally  went back to the 70's group they used to be and that made them famous....  Congratulations guys !!!
B000002H2H|5.0|this is a beast of an album. this is my favorite. i have all 7 metallica  albums. this is AWESOME. I listen to all the songs. my 4 favoriets are 1.  Fade to Black; 2.Ride the Lightning; 3.Trapped Under Ice; 4.Creeping Death.  If you have heard abou t how good Load and ReLoad are, they suck (compared  to this). These solos will make you want to jump and bounce off the walls.  BUY it. It rocks (seriously). Worth its weight in gold.
B00000253N|5.0|This album is one of Dylan's greatest ever and in my opinion his premier  work of the 70s.  Each song is totally unique and brilliant, both musically  and lyrically. I've listened to this album countless times over the past 20  years, yet appreciate it no less now than upon it's release.
0684874350|5.0|Angela's Ashes is the best book I have ever read.  In every chapter I  laughed, cried, smiled, felt physically sick, I felt every emotion  possible. This is the only book that I have got to the last page and  started it again, and its even better the second time around.  I have  recommended this book to everyone I know and no-one has been disappointed  in it.  BRILLIANT.  But Frank, what happened when you got to America, and  what happened to the other McCourts......another book I hope.
B000001C6M|5.0|Being one of the very first cd's I bought - when it was first released  this is a personal favorite.  However after listening to this album, hell  awaits, reign in blood, south of heaven, and seasons in the abyss - it  REALLY breaks my heart that Dave Lombardo is gone.  Say what you want - HE  WAS SLAYER.
B000002IWQ|4.0|A strong album, with some of the best songs from Rush in the 1990s. Tracks  1, 4, 5, 6, and 9 are exceptional. A pleasant surprise.
0688002307|5.0|For anyone with a spec of spiritual yerning.  A way of looking at life  without filters and understanding a greater part of everything.
0451169514|5.0|Loved it....the beginning hooked me in. Two boys float a paper boat in the  gutter, when they lose it in the storm drain, they see a clown down  there....I whipped through the next 1000 pages to see what happened next!!!
B00000292K|4.0|I don't like Miles Davis as much as a lot of you probably do, but I have  to tell you that this CD has really given me a whole new respect for his  work. Fat (and phat) sweaty, visceral grooves that don't quit are what  &quot;On the Corner&quot; is all about. There's not much of Miles' horn  work on this one and even less jazz as his fans knew it, so a lot of people  really slammed it when it was first released.  Oddly, this reminds me of  the kind of pseudo-African polyrhythms of Brian Eno and middle period  Talking Heads.
0451160916|5.0|I have read almost every one of King's books and this one is the best with  &quot;The Stand&quot; a very close  second.  Loved the character of Tony  and how he guides Danny through what happens.  Redrum is the classic term  that permeated the pop culture.  I would recommend that you read this book  first if you haven't read any of his books before
B000000WHX|5.0|If the house was on fire and I had to choose one disc to rescue,  &quot;Blue Lines&quot; would be the one.  Liek other reviewers here, I  didn't get it at all when i first heard it.  It eventually took me about 5  listens to readjust my thinking and see this for the perfection that it is.  Don't wait -- buy it now!
0679405429|5.0|Jane Austen is wonderful.  Pride and Prejudice was a joy to read.  I had  the worst nights' sleep this past week because I truly couldn't put it  down.
B000001FSP|5.0|People initially explore Marianne's music because of her connection to The  Rolling Stones, which, though admittedly cool, ( I worship The Stones more  than most),always seems to pale her own musical prowess. Marianne is one of  those rare artists that can blend the cadence of pop music with darkness,  durge, anger, poetry - and through it all shed some clarity and (dare I  say) light into an otherwise dreary existence. She is balsy, pensive,  outspoken, ardent and has the vision and talent that seems elusive in the  artists of today.  This record is undoubtedly her most raw and most  powerful. It is the zenith of her career.
0345404475|5.0|This is one of the most gripping novels I've ever read.  I read the first  few pages on a school night, and the next day finished it in school,  resolutely ignoring the classes I was meant to be paying attention to.   Incredibly gripping.  You've probably already seen Blade Runner, but if you  haven't, I'd read Androids and steer clear of the film.  It's an okay movie  in and of itself, but you'll realize that it's rather a shallow parody of  the masterful book upon which it was based.  Just read it, why dontcha!?!?
B000002KOG|5.0|I'm a big Neil fan and have most of his recordings.  This album is a true  classic as it offers a collection of early Neil &quot;country rock&quot;  tunes.  There is a subtle hint of Buffalo Springfield but the guitar tracks  are pure Neil.  The album tunes range from &quot;country and western&quot;  instrumental tracks like The Emperor of Wyoming, to gentle ballads like  Here We Are In the Years, to the the rocking song The Loner.  Without a  doubt, my favorite Neil album. Thanks to amazon I finally found and ordered  the CD.  My album is worn out!
0399143904|2.0|I love Tom Clancey's novels, but you can skip this one.  I was actually  bored while reading this.
B000009RC2|5.0|I saw the Mahavishnu Orchestra play this album in 1973 in Detroit and they  were fantastic.  Suprisingly, Jan Hammer was the focal point in the group  with his expressive stage presence and inventive solos.  This was one of  the best concerts I have ever witnessed - Billy Cobham was  almost  overpowering in his drumming abilities.
B00000ADG2|3.0|Lauryn Hill has a beautiful voice. She's sexy, hip and real...Not many  would deny that. However, if you are among the 10% of people in this  country that are not religious her theme may get a little tiring. I love  her voice and respect her talent. I could only dream of sounding so good.  My favorite tracks are: Doo Wop (That Thing) and the Ex-Factor. &lt;-Which  almost brought tears to my eyes. I'm happy that she has found her God and  is so successful, I just don't want to hear about it in every song. This  album should be listed under Christian Rap/Jazz. I might not have paid for  this CD if I knew all the songs were going to mention her faith. Luckily  90% of the country agrees with her. She will go far.
0451450523|5.0|The Last Unicorn by Peter S. Beagle is one of the last, best fairy tales  of our generation.  It's a great read for an adult or a child; I first read  it in fourth grade, and recently re-read it as an adult with no less sense  of wonder or awe.<br />It's an often tongue-in-cheek fairy tale about the last  unicorn left on a Midaevil Earth, which unicorn represents (of course) the  last of the immortal magic that is inevitably represented in good  fantasies.  The story is set in the usual quest setting, with the expected  good and evil dichotomy and characters such as a bumbling yet powerful  wizard, a good-hearted lass, a handsome hero, and, last but foremost, the  beautiful and sorrowful, immortal unicorn.<br />What sets this tale apart from  others--it is most definitely in the same league as C.S. Lewis' the  Chronicles of Narnia, or his more adult Till We Have Faces--is its flowing  prose and often unexpected sense of humor.  Beagle pokes fun at the fantasy  form of story-telling (for the enjoyment of the adult reader), while not  allowing the jibes to be too satirical or otherwise distracting from the  beauty and grace of the story itself.  While the tale stays within the  traditional confines and plot of a fairy tale/fantasy, the characters are  so well-written and the story so imaginative and well-told, the tale's  traditional form only adds to its sense of magic.<br />In short, it's one of  the very best fairy tale/fantasies I've had the pleasure of reading (and  re-reading).  I unabashedly recommend it to the young and old with five  stars.
0451163486|5.0|Well, what can I say!? I mean, all those other reviews down there really  tell what this book is like. Ken Follett at his best. And THAT is  something, huh? &quot;The Needle&quot; Faber is the only german spy in  english soil that can turn the war back for the Nazis, as he learned the  secret that Churchill was hiding so well with the help of the americans.  The book tells his adventures up the Brittany Island in order to contact a  U-boat. The final sequency on Storm Island is something of a genious.  Follett has written some very good thrillers about WWII, like this one and  &quot;Night over water&quot;. But his best still is &quot;The key to  Rebecca&quot;. Anyway, &quot;Eye of the needle&quot; is a page turner like  Grisham in his early years, a book one with interests in spies and the War  won't regret reading.
B000000WJZ|5.0|I LOVE this album.  My sister got it like 5 years ago and we listened only  to the popular songs.  But, I started listening to it again about 3 years  ago, and I just can't get tired of it.  I just got Gish and Mellon Collie,  and they're both really great, but Siamese Dream just has something they  don't.  You know a band's good if you can't get tired of their album.   Cherub Rock and Geek U.S.A. are amazing moshers.  Soma is very heartfelt  and emotional.  So is Mayonnaise.  But, I'd have to say that Hummer is  probably on of my all time favorites by SP.  I love the jam session at the  end.  So, this is their best I'd have to say.
B000000OMJ|5.0|What do an amnesiac, an assassin, a chronic compulsive, and an  institutionalized lunatic have in common?  They all enjoy residence on this  incredible album by Peter Gabriel.  <br />The amazing lyrical territory is  matched by unprecedented sonics, which married dry guitars, erratic  keyboards, with heavily gated drums (which would later become Phil Collins  trademark sound). <br />One of the greatest albums of the decade.
9993445320|5.0|I've read this book two or three times and it is always great. C.S.  Lewis's writing is very original and friendly. The pictures are very nice  and the story itself is exciting and entertaining. There are obvious  allusions to the story of Jesus, but I like to think of it just as a lovely  little story that really everyone can have their own interpretation to.  P.S. If you think that this book is just for children, you probably aren't  the type of person who would like it anyway.
B000002UY3|3.0|This is an interesting CD.  At first I didn't like it very much, but it  grew on me.  Hope Sandoval's voice takes some getting used to, but  eventually it becomes a distinctive part of the music.  She sounds very  world-weary, slurring her notes up and down often.  Sometimes she sounds  just a bit off-key.  The accompanying instruments are mostly acoustic,  though there is a distortion-drenched guitar in &quot;Blue Flower.&quot;   The style doesn't sustain my interest for an entire CD's length, but  nevertheless there is some pretty good stuff here.
0451450523|5.0|When I was little, I used to watch the movie over and over. We moved at  one point, and somewhere along the line, the movie got lost. Last year, I  bought the book, and found that it was everything I remembered the movie  was, and more. It was the most beautifully written book I have ever read.   Beagle has an amazing way with words..
0609603086|4.0|I picked this book up in Copenhagen in Sept., it's due to be released in  the US in October (I think).  Anyway, I was skepical to dive into this  after &quot;The Third Twin,&quot; which I felt was a huge disappointment  against all of the other great things he's written.  But, I'm happy to  report that this book helps bring Mr. Follett on his road to recovery!  The  basic plot is an interesting one: the ability of a cult-commune leader to  trigger a California earthquake in order to stop the development of power  plants threatening his home.  The plot moves quickly, with a good mix of  suspense, humor, passion, and all the usual elements.  The links that  develop between the good and evil keep the story interesting, and but for a  few points that seem a bit too contrived or unlikely, I enjoyed the book  and recommend it to Follett fans.  It's no &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot;  (my vote for his best work, and one of my favorite books ever), but it is  worth reading and encourages me that there is indeed life after &quot;Third  Twin.&quot;
0688152023|5.0|I acquired this book after a broken ankle made my usual exercise programs  impractical.  Most of the stretches can be done in a sitting position and  there is an entire section (floor barre) devoted to leg exercises done on  the floor - not standing.  My injury has made me very aware of finding  exercise programs for less-than-able bodies.  Though I've been out of cast  for seven months, my therapy is on-going to regain balance, range of motion  and so forth, but with this program, I'm able to begin to regain my  flexibility and lower body strength.  I would highly recommend it to anyone  needing a workout that can work around lower body injuries.
B000007XUQ|4.0|Finally both Carpenters Christmas cds in one collection! From traditional  carols to romantic Christmas gems, no one does it like the Carpenters.   &quot;What are You Doing New Years Eve?&quot; makes the listener wish they  knew Karen to save her from her lonely fate, while &quot;Christmas Song  (Chestnuts) explains why so many reviewers compared her to Nat King Cole.   Along with Richard's beautiful versions of piano selections, these factors  make Christmas Collection the ultimate CD for the season.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is absolutely a brilliant book.  Everyone should read it, whether  they like historical literature or not (I don't in particular).  Give it a  chance!  I loved it.  You'll meet some hilarious characters, and it's  unlikely that you couldn't relate to one of them.  I, personally, saw a bit  of myself in the chaplain.
1574531298|5.0|After 1983 NDE I have looked for an explanation of my experiences in the  Light. When I read the descriptions of the &quot;homecoming&quot;, the soul  groups the sense of belonging, the bliss &amp; peace, I knew I had found my  answer. The material will help dispel the fear of physical death, provide  comfort, hope and joy. I share the book freely with all willing to read it.
0425156842|5.0|Mixing the history of philosophy, with an engrossing plot.. I couldn't put  it down until I had finished it!
0399143904|4.0|This Clancy book was a good one, but several have topped it.  I sorry to  say this, but there are too many grammatical errors.
0399143904|3.0|Although I am a loyal fan of Tom Clancy I just had to put this book down.  Why you ask? For one thing the book was just to drawn out, possibly if he  had condensed the book a little more i would have liked it. It's also not  as realistic as some of his other books, the terrorist plots are just to  far fetched and the terrorist counterstrike team never seems to have  anything bad happen to them. Overall I'll have to give this book ***
0684800713|5.0|Magnificent.  Hemmingway has always been my number one author, but I had  not read this book until recently.  The descriptions are uncanny.   Everything from the Cafes to the Spanish sunsets are permanently embedded  in my mind.  I have never been to Spain or Paris, but after reading this  book I feel like I lived right there with Jacob Barnes, Brett Ashley, and  Robert Cohn for several years.  God bless the expatriate, World War I  authors and their books.
B000002GKT|5.0|Frampton was seventeen when he played the Fillmore with Humble Pie.  Guitarists will note his riffs are not blues oriented. Although he blasts his Les Paul Custom through the Marshall stack, his articulation is melodic, agressive and within the crotch rock context of Steve Marriots' arrangements. I can think of no finer rock adolescent work than Framptons's guitar work on this album. Of course he later became famous with Frampton Comes Alive. Sh*t, I wish I could play like that.
B000002L9J|5.0|The Smith's, one of the most influential of the 80's bands, reach their  zenith with The Queen is Dead. Released in 1986 to wide acclaim, this their  third album, cemented the Smiths' place in rock history.   The title track,  The Queen Is Dead, launches off  with a rocking assault on England's  monarchy.  The Smiths never look back. What makes this album a classic, is  the songs.  Most albums have one or two standout tracks-the rest are  fillers.  That is definitely not the case here. All the songs are topnotch.  The standouts include, I Know It's Over, There Is a Light That Never Goes  Out, and Big Mouth Strikes Again.  The Smiths broke up a year after this  release. It's no wonder, it is hard to top perfection.
0440131480|5.0|Wooohoooo! that rocked..I finished it today and it was amazing. I  specifically thought his views on race relations made me look at the world  in a different way..I'm not sure i understood the book in its fullest, but  i have yet to carry a conversation about it to another person who read it..  so I might change what i wrote hear soon.
B000003RCY|5.0|Well I first heard of Rammstein when one of their songs was played at a  Rock Club - I just HAD to know who it was by! Now I'm totally addicted and  I need my regular fix... 'Herzeleid' is awesome. If you want total  industrial heaven just get this album, now. Anyone out there ever heard of  Cubanate? They are a London based industrial techno band. Rammstein are  like a much heavier version of Cubanate with a Ministry-style bass line.   As 'Guitar' mag wrote in June '98:- &quot;For anyone who craves crunchy,  scalpel edged riffs, heavy electronic beats and strong hooklines, East  German sextet Rammstein is one of the most welcome groups to surface from  the darknes since Nine Inch Nails.&quot; If nothing else gets you to buy  this, that review will.
B000005ALP|4.0|The actual rank should be 4.5 stars, but 0.5 stars are not supported  here... The missing 1/2 star is for the pessimistic lyrics. I, personally,  am not expecting cds to depress me. You can find plenty of other reasons...  Other than that, this is truly a classic. Great musical ideas (not  necessarily original) and great sound and production. The songs are  pop/rock but loops and other 'electronica tools' are used here and there.  All of the songs can be considered 'quiet'. This could be a really 'fun'  cd, if the lyrics had been a little happier, but if this is what's on the  bands mind, so be it. There is a special edition with a bonus cd. You can  skip this edition without thinking twice and get another cd with the change  (like Laurie Anderson's strange angels, if you don't have it already).
B000002NJS|5.0|With ROL, Madonna has created an album that has a marked amount of  maturity and isn't as &quot;perky&quot; as some of her earlier works.  This  is not a bad thing, for the faster-paced songs are interspersed with slow  melodies that would almost be considered &quot;easy listening&quot;.   Betcha never expected that from Madonna, eh? (At least, before she starred  in &quot;Evita&quot;)
0441172717|5.0|Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune  the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written, it is the greatest novel  ever written. It introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world, more  realistic than any other in literature. Frank Herbert was a genius. Paul is  a little stiff, but at the same time, he is more &quot;real&quot; than most  people I know. This is the first novel that I've read that wore me out  reading it, that is how powerful it is. There are scenes that simply left  me physically exhausted after reading them. No book I have ever read before  or since has drawn me in like Dune does. Enough good things cannot be said  about Dune. It is pitiful that the Modern Library skipped this in it's  listing. Dune blows Ulysses, Gatsby and anything by Faulkner completely out  of the water.  Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, you MUST read Dune. You  will NOT regret it.
B000002UKS|5.0|Is there a band playing today that rocks harder than the Foo Fighters??    A wonderful record that gets better with each listening.
0399143904|2.0|The idea is good. Anyone who thinks that this cannot happen has their  heads buried in the sand. However, the story itself is weak. The &quot;good  guys&quot; win way too easily. Anyone in REAL spec-ops knows it is never  this easy. There is even some hints of plagiarism in this book. Tom, have  you been reading Dick Marcinko's Rouge Warrior books? If not, and I think  you have, you should, and you will see what REAL spec-ops personnel go  through.
B00000AFGM|5.0|A fairly radical departure from ACS shows that Manson is keeping true to hirself my not letting anyone pigeon hole hir.  The lyrics are deeper and actually sung instead of screamed.  We knew he could sing from the opening of Sweet Dreams, now we can get a whole album of it.<br />The sound is different, and some people won't like that...but then the Reverend does enjoy pi**ing people off.
B00000AFDW|5.0|I saw the review from someone in Boston and had to say to not believe it!  Psycho Circus is the BEST CD I have heard from KISS in a long time!! It's  gonna appeal to everyone. Diehard KISS fans who have been there since the  beginning will (and do) love it and it also will appeal to the people who  may have never heard of KISS!! YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!!!
B000000OQF|5.0|What is there to say about the debut album from Guns n' Roses?  Well for  starters, it's a fantastic hard rock CD.  It echoes with the sheer  immediacy of the music, the bombast with which the group attacks the songs  is astonishing.  The music doesn't have much to say, but when you rock out  as hard as they do, who needs impressive lyrics?  Besides, the lyrics do  have some tales to tell, and they revel in the shallowness that permeates  their native Los Angleles.  One of the classic and definitive rock albums  of all time, it is the king of 80's excess, driven to a height only masters  could take it.  Ladies and gentlemen, Guns n' Roses.
B0000033P0|4.0|Like the epic Brain Salad Surgery, two years later, this album features a  suite, spearheaded by Keith Emerson playing multiple keyboards (especially  organ and synthesizer). The remaining album has a good-time rocker (Are You  Ready Eddy) and a hymn (The Only Way) just like BSS (Benny the Bouncer and  Jeruselem). So if you like Brain Salad Surgery, you'll likeTarkus.
0440180295|5.0|add to the encomiums? The vast, modern anti-war literature contains but  one equal, but Celine required over 700 pages to say the same things.   Slaughterhouse Five wins the prize for economy; and for great story  telling. I never &quot;believed&quot; in science fiction until I took that  little trip to Tralfamadore with Billy Pilgrim and heard the Message about  the Golden Rule. Is it correct that the Golden Rule is not to be found  anywhere in the Bible? If not, then I can now understand why. When I lie  awake sleepless at night I sometimes pass those crazy hours recounting to  myself Billy's time on Tralfamadore and reflect upon the true meaning of  Charity. If all of the foregoing seems too personal a tale then I am able  to say with some certainty that the reader has never been possessed by a  book.
B000002HGD|2.0|This is supposed to be trail-blazing, genre-defining music? Sure, it's  more interesting than anything your parents are probably listening to at  the moment, but that does not make a great record. If you consider Puff  Daddy a more innovative rap artist than Public Enemy and Eric B. then you'd  probably also pick Moby over Aphex Twin, Orbital, Leftfield, A Guy Called  Gerald, The Chemical Brothers and plenty of other Brits who have done more  interesting, compelling things with this type of music.
B000002C1X|5.0|I really like this record because it is like one big long song, you don't  have that silence in the middle.  I am a &quot;child&quot; of 11 so I  especilly liked &quot;Brick In the Wall Part 2&quot; because of the lyrics  &quot;we don't need no education...&quot;
0385493622|5.0|The historical saga of Fermat's Last Theorem with incisive wit and humor  from Pythagoras to Wiles coupled with  a dash of  elementary mathematical  puzzles provides a perfect blend for a story.  I became enchanted with the  elegance and beauty of number theory. The most powerful aspect of the book  is the clarity of mathematical concepts that took centuries to develop and  the notable mathematicians that played key roles in the construction of the  final proof.  The only minor drawback reflects the narrative style that is  oftimes repetitious which reflects the BBC-Nova series for which it was  written. An excellent read.
B000002OR6|5.0|Bat Out of Hell 2 is awesome. Better than Bat Out of Hell (maybe).  Everything is sung with the emotion and soul that only Meat has, and as  usual, Jim Steinman's lyrics contain potent messages. Rock opera at its  very best. 5 stars is not enough...
0380018179|5.0|The Thorn Birds was the first miniseries I ever watched and I fell in love  with it completely.  Then I read the book and I enjoyed that even more. As  an amatuer writer myself I love the way Collen McCullough pays attention to  detail and makes you feel every part of the book.  The scenes between Ralph  and Meggie are charged with such energy that you can actually feel it.   This is my favorite book and I would recommend it to everyone.
B000002C4J|5.0|This C.D. has 2 definite problems . When I first heard&quot; I Hate You  Then I Love you &quot;, I burst out laughing ! And &quot;Tell Him &quot; is  total corn . Treat Her Like a Lady&quot; is a bit on the strange side   (Celine attempts rap ! ) but it provides fun relief from her slow-rythem  ballads .        The two cravits in this C.D. should not keep you from  buying it , though !
1573226521|3.0|I agree the book does begin well and very quickly draws you into the  story. I have some experience in the kind of travelling described  particularly in Thailand, so I desperately wanted to like this book. The  concept itself worked but I believe Garland struggled with a suitable  ending for the tale. I have to disagree with a previous reviewer who  reccomended &quot;Are You Experienced&quot; a thoroughly unlikable book  with no redeming features I can remember.
0964385619|5.0|Robert Kiyosaki through his insight has helped me to see the world a  little differently.  This book is a must read for anyone who has ever been  even remotely disgruntled with their life in the &quot;rat race.&quot;  He  is insightful, articulate and entertaining while provided clarity about why  it is so hard for people to succeed in this world by adhering to the  standard dogma. <br /> I am currently expecting my first child, and it is a  relief to know that I will be able to raise my child as necessary to  succeed in this new world instead of condemning him to the traditional rat  race of corporate america. The world has moved on, but so few people have  moved on with it.  Anyone who reads this book will be armed with the  information needed to move ahead and escape the traps of archaic  philosophies in this new world.<br />This books answers so many of the  questions we all ask.  It is a must read, a necessity for success.
B000002H97|2.0|I was very dissapointed with this recording. I am used to thrashing, in  your face, heavy and loud Metallica. I must say, this was a big let down.  It's great if you've just heard Metallica on the radio for the first time.  But, for someone who has followed them since they first got together, it's  sad to see that they've sold out to appeal the masses.
6304806442|5.0|I worked on this movie and was really proud to be a part if it. It tells  the story like it is, no pussyfooting. DON'T MISS IT.     END
B000000W5F|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't been said before? That it's a  collection of previously rejected material but doesn't sound like it? That  it's one of the most fun Stones albums you can buy? That it's a true  classic? I could very easily repeat all of that, but even being repetitive  in this case is worth it. Everything you've heard about this platter is  true. It's a guaranteed good time. Split neatly into a rock side and a  ballad side, it doesn't make a single misstep. I'm so crazy about it that I  don't even know what song I like best--I love them all equally. This is  quite possibly the best album to play for someone who isn't overly familiar  with the Stones and wants to hear a full Stones album for the very first  time. This is Mick and the boys at their best.
039472903X|5.0|rules still exist, examples still remembered, author still the best.
0345298349|5.0|This was the first time I read a book by Martin Cruz Smith and and I was  surprised by the depth of the book and the world he has written. Made me  forget where in the world I was since I became so absorbed in the story.    Each character comes alive with each word he wrote.  Definately one of the  best books I've read.
B000002NE4|5.0|Nick Cave has really matured with this new album. It seems heavily  influenced by Leonard Cohen. Every note is perfectly placed. The sound is  clear, simple, and soooo slick. You can picture him in a darkened studio.  The songs, if materialized, would become velvet.
B000006NPY|1.0|This album was really dissapointing as there were only 2, maybe 3, good  songs.  The rest of the album is so wussy I can't believe it's SP.  There  isn't a single heavy riff... SP has died.
B00000AFFF|5.0|David Marsh may have called Elvis Costello the most overrated song writer  of his generation, but his collaboration with Burt Bacharach suggests he is  indeed the Cole Porter of our generation.  Few popular artists emerged from  the punk scene and grew musically to the extent that EC did as the voice of  the Brodsky Quartet.  In the age of Retro, Costello proves to be an  original.
0399143904|1.0|Poorly written and thoroughly predictable. At one point I wondered if this  book was not written by TC since the style was miles away from 'Red Storm  Rising' and 'The Hunt for ...'. Then I wondered if maybe TC needed money  and it was therefore necessary to finish the book in record time. In any  case the next book from mr. Clancy that I buy will not be a hard cover,  instead I will wait untill the paperback version comes out. In short mr.  Clancy has been removed from my 'must read' list.
B00000273M|3.0|This greatest hits collection has what you'd expect, I suppose.  However,  I think anyone new to the Bangles would be much better off starting out  with &quot;All Over The Place&quot; and going from there.  That album is  virtually a greatest-hits collection by itself.  <br />This Greatest Hits  album also does not include their earliest (and many would argue, their  best) songs.  The raw exuberance of their first single, &quot;Getting Out  Of Hand/Call On Me,&quot; on Downkiddie Records, is not here.  Their  terrific first EP on Faulty Records is also not represented at all.
0131103709|5.0|This book is an absolute must for C programmers. &quot;K&amp;R&quot; is  the best book to learn the language, as well as the ultimate reference  manual around. You may need the hardcover because of the number of times  you'll reach for the book to look something up, but for the common  student/worker, the paperback is more than enough. The best C book around,  without any question.
B000002GB9|5.0|Castle Walls and Man in the Wilderness are two of the best, unheard songs  that I know of.  Just AWESOME!!!
B000006045|5.0|Much darker than their first two albums aurally, though I think that they  were going that way.  I just saw these guys live here in Seattle last week,  and they were excellent!  This is probably the most varied of all the  albums, from the pop meloncholia of &quot;Teardrop&quot; to the  Bauhuas-like &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot; to the atmospheric bluesiness of  &quot;Exchange&quot;.  Though several of the songs wallow in tension with  no release, the order of the songs, with a reprise of &quot;Exchange&quot;  as a finale, gives a balance and order to the entire album.  It makes you  wonder where they will go with their next release, as it may be their last  project together.
B000006045|5.0|This album takes a slight departure from Massive's earlier releases, and  slows itself down dramatically to a grinding beat more reminiscent of  Tricky's Premillenium Tension album.  The first track, 'Angel' is musically  fierce, yet the vocals of Horace Andy (along with the lyrics) smooth it  over.  The rest, well, just check the album out.  'Risingson' and 'Inertia  Creeps' are the highlights.
0131101633|5.0|Can't believe there's only a few reviews for this book.  &quot;K&amp;R&quot; is *the* book for C programmers. Not only useful in  learning the language, but also a a handy reference. Only complaint would  be the price (it's a thin book), but it's worth every penny of it.
B0000020C4|5.0|Only once in a while does a musical this wonderful come along, it's even  more rare to have such a specatacular cast.  Lea Salonga is almost as good  as Frances Ruffele, and with the exception of that abominable performance  from Judy Kuhn, it's absolutely wonderful.  I've been a Les Miz fan  forever, this CD just seals it for eternity
B000002A3T|5.0|I've been a Pink Floyd fan since I know I'm existing. What I liked about  them was inspiring me all the time.<br />The Division Bell tells me nothing  new, nevertheless this is unimportant. The music is fantastic, and I fell  in love with the soul-like sounds of Wearing The Inside Out (did you know  that Sam Brown who sang Stop! in the 80s is singing in it?). My other  favorites are Poles Apart and Lost For Words.<br />This album is highly  recommended for those who are new to Pink Floyd. For the other ones I  suggest A Saucerful Of Secrets. That IS Pink Floyd. This is called Floyd  too though they are far away from that mentality of the first albums.
B000002U9E|5.0|This album is truly the best one and it's the kind of cd that you can  listen to over and over again. The creative stories that she's trying to  share with you is unique and very original. If you need to listen to  something with meaningful lyrics and truly talented music this album is  perfect. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoy Peter gabriel or Tori  Amos.
B000002L42|5.0|IF YOU LIKE STEELY DAN, YOU WILL LOVE ALIVE IN AMERICA<br />     &quot;Music  hath charms to soothe the savage breast,&quot; Congreve wrote in Act One of  The Mourning Bride.  &quot;Music hath charms we all may find, Ingratiate  deeply with the mind,&quot; Matthew Green wrote centuries ago.<br />     Today  Steely Dan is classic and contemporary, music that is unique, music that is  inviting and intoxicating.  If you have not heard it, you should. Beg,  borrow, or buy ALIVE IN AMERICA and/or STEELY DAN GOLD to get a taste of  this uniquely American music.<br />     Listen to Babylon Sisters and Green  Earrings, and you will want to play your CDs over and over to please your  ears again and again.  The music can be exciting and erotic, inviting and  intoxicating to your taste.<br />     &quot;This is no one night stand.  It's  a real occasion!&quot; Tom Scott sings in Babylon Sisters.  It's true.  A  night with Steely Dan is special, unforgettable.<br />     If you are already  addicted, if Steely Dan is a habit with you, you love ALIVE IN AMERICA.   Bernard Purdie on the drums makes your heart beat to his rhythm.  Steve  Khan's guitar blends beautifully with the drums in Babylon Sisters.   Multitalented tenor and alto sax, clarinet , Tom Scott delights you with  his vocal and interpretive instrumentation.<br />     Green Earrings, a  popular classic CD, features Bernard Purdie again on the drums with Don  Grolnick at the piano and Donald Fagen at the synthesizer.  The mellifluous  melody will haunt you , make you hum and tap your toes to the rhythm.   Elliott Randall and Larry Carlton on their guitars add to the magical music  in this album.<br />     The songs by Walter Becker and Donald Fagen are  unforgettable. Their work makes an indelible impression on the world of  music.  This is the best in 1998, a unique combination of words and music  you know and love to hear.  ALIVE IN AMERICA and STEELY DAN GOLD CDs have  brought life to music in America in 1998.<br />Nancy Kobryn Copyright 1998
0767812778|5.0|This is the classic adventure/drama about the exploits of T.E. Lawrence,  the British army officer who organized the arabs into an effective force to  fight the Germans during World War I.  Peter O'Toole has the role of his  life as Lawrence.  The cinematography is absolutely stunning with most of  the footage being shot in the desert with sweeping scenes.  The music is  perfect for the movie and is captivating.  In my humble but accurate  opinion, this is one of the ten best movies ever made and is a &quot;must  see&quot; for anyone who has even a casual interest in serious, quality  movies.     END
B000001ZS4|5.0|I have followed Mssr. Jarre since 1976 when &quot;Oxygene&quot; was  released, (btw, an excellent piece of work as well.)  Jarre, in  &quot;Equinoxe&quot; (1978), is a &quot;Magnum Opus&quot;, and it's hard to  believe it is 20 years old!!  Jarre creates an aural landscape, or  waterscape (if your imagination takes you there) in a 'grand-symphonique'  style.  I know of no other composer in electronic realization that  tastefully utilizes the Theramin and the harmonium with analog synths as  he.  Argueably one of the best albums EVER created.  If you 'suffer' from  synaesthesia, or have a vivid imagination, this album will take you to  places only your mind can go.  If only he would have paid this much  attention to detail as in &quot;Oxygene 7-13&quot; in editing and  programming it would rank right up with Equinoxe.<br />Equinoxe IS A  &quot;MUST HAVE&quot; FOR ANY LIBRARY--PERIOD!
0783226837|5.0|If you are looking for serious horror or terror, you better pass over  Tremors; but if you are looking for a delightfully witty action film with  just the right balance of tension and comedy you will love Tremors.  Val  (Kevin Bacon) and Earl (Fred Ward) are two handymen doing odd jobs in a  tiny western town named &quot;Perfection&quot;.  When strange deaths start  occurring, they become involved in the investigation.  Soon they end up in  the battle of their lives.  The chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward  is wonderful; you never lose interest when they are talking.  And the  clever lines work perfectly with the tension and action (&quot;Here it is  Monday and I'm already planning for Wednesday.  It is Monday isn't  it?&quot;).  I've probably watched this movie a dozen times, and I enjoy it  every time.  The DVD version is well done.     END

B0000025L8|3.0|This album is weakest Clash album I own.  There is good material on it ,  but only enough for about one LP, not the three this album was originally  released on.  Get the album, but not before you've got all their other  stuff.
B0000057C5|5.0|Alright, I heard Du Hast on MTV and I said, well, that's a cool song, but  I don't know if I could take a whole album of it.  I WAS WRONG.  I saw  Rammstein live before I bought Sehnsucht and after that show I couldn't buy  the CD fast enough.  The opening song makes you want to either go dancing  or have sex and it just gets better from there. I love Kuss Mich and  Eifersucht (the laughing at the end of the song is evil and fabulous), Buck  Dich and Bestrafe Mich are songs you'll never be able to hear in English,  but once you know what they're about, you'll never get 'em out of your  head.  This band is fabulous live and on the stereo.  I really pity anyone  that has to follow them.
B000002C1X|5.0|I recently reviewed &quot;The Wall: Live in Berlin&quot; and would be  remiss if I didn't review the original album.<br />This was definately Roger's  best work and told a gripping story of a man who lost his father to a  horrid war, had an overprotective mother and became an international rock  star/wannabe Hitler.<br />This is taken from a lot of real-life experiences  from Roger and you can tell by listening to this that the pain was  real.<br />Bottom line:  If you never buy a Pink Floyd album or the live  recording of The Wall, get this album!

Although this is somewhat dated, I still think  that Triumph of Steel is easily one of the best MEtal albums EVER.  The  speed, aggression and dark lyrical content can only leave you begging for  more. The only problem I had was with that waCk-ass &quot;Demon's  Whip&quot;, but the other songs esp. &quot;Power of Thy Sword&quot; and  &quot;Spirit Horse of the Cherokee&quot; more than compensate for it.  Listening to this album just makes me wanna beat up Hanson, 3rd Eye Blind,  Semisonic and all those other generic formula wuss 'rock' groups.  VIVA  MANOWAR!
B0000027F8|4.0|The piano, guitar and other varied forms of instrumentation make this  album hard to classify. One thing's for sure; it's a far cry from Michael's  days with the pop-wave duo called Wham. The song &quot;Something to  Save&quot; is excellent, and &quot;Mother's Pride&quot; may be the best  anti-war song since the early 70s.  Excellent!
B00000D9TK|5.0|Ms.Dion does it again! Even though I dont speak French, I still LOVE this  album, the music is so beautiful, there is not a track that is not well  written, composed or sung!  As Celine once said &quot;Music does transcend  barriers&quot; (language barriers that is!!) A worthwhile purchase! :-)
B00000ADG2|3.0|I think Lauryn Hill's voice is beautiful.  I wish there were more R &amp;  B songs, and less rap.  And, I also don't like all the talking after almost  every track.  But, I love Can't Take My Eyes Off You.  She did a great job  covering that song!  I also like That Thing, and When It Hurts So Bad.
6304806442|5.0|Seriously disturbing and greatly amusing at the same time!  A classic,  thought-provoking, highly entertaining view of the highs and lows of heroin  addiction!  Worth seeing solely for the amazing performance of Robert  Carlyle (&quot;The Full Monty,&quot; &quot;Priest,&quot; &quot;Hamish  Macbeth&quot;) as disgusting brute &quot;Begbie.&quot;  The energetic  soundtrack CD's are also must-have items.     END
6302561868|4.0|Though it's not really fitting for a movie in the Alien series, Alien3 is  an interestingly done if monochrome-looking exercise in religious allegory.   Weaver handles the constantly changing role of Ripley well, combining both  the independence shown in Alien with the maternal aspects of Aliens.  This,  combined with the rest of the cast and some effective camerawork, makes for  what is at least an interesting film.  It must be seen letterboxed for it  to make any sense, however.  The end of the movie (and what should have  been the end of the series) is amazing, of course, and worth waiting for  even if you find the preceding two hours unbearably dull.  Give the film a  second look (or a first!), but again, in its original Panavision format if  possible; otherwise it becomes very visually garbled.     END
B000002J1L|5.0|This was the beginning of Genesis Live. The opening track &quot;Musical  Box&quot; with it's tale of Henry and Cynthia displays real passion. When  you hear Peter's voice, going up light and down heavy, like we were taught  how to write at school, you know that this is for real.  You feel the  hair's stand up in the back of your neck. This is how you feel each time  you hear this song, with Peter's remarkable voice. This type of magic has  stood the test of time. 26 years later the reaction is still the same, one  of sheer magic.  Some people may say that I am a nut, perhaps they are  correct.  From the Album, a group of people, collectively known as the  Hogweed Youth Movement appeared.  The Giant Hogweed spread and then Foxtrot  was born with it's own masterpieces. This album is all about passion of one  sort or another. A classic to begin, and one to end. Fountain of Salmacis  is an absolute delight.  Musically the band's brilliance is shown. Tony  Banks is amazing, and, the diversity of the band is shown when you listen  to all the different types of instruments that are played.  The album is  sprinkled with Genius from a classical music point of view, perhaps the  band were influenced by some composers e.g. Tchaikovsky or  Beethoven.<br />Make sure you get peace when you listen to this album.  It  will blow your mind.
0399143904|2.0|I am a long time (early) Clancy fan, I read the Navel Institute edition of  Red October, before his discovery by the general public.  I mention this  because Rainbow is not up to Mr. Clancy's standards. Probably 400 pages  more than necessary- sorry Tom.
0195073401|5.0|This text is brilliant!  Thorough, yet not quite comeplete, the phrase  'this is too adavanced for treatment here,' appeared much too often.   However, working through this book offers confidence and courage to the  otherwise meek student (just be sure said student doesn't kill herself  along the way). Kudos to the authors.  Though the typos can make it  tricky....
B000005IU2|5.0|In this album, Iggy Pop &amp; Co. displayed both the attitude and  the   primitive sound that would define the punk rock music that would come a few   years later. However,compared to the Clash and the Ramones and the Sex  Pistols and whoever came during the official rise of punk(as well as to the  other predecessors of  punk,the Velvet Underground) , the Stooges come off  as something absoutely frightning. They were violent,mean and nasty.  And,because they reveled in being so stupid(at least imagewise; he may  sound stupid,but we all know Iggy has  some intelligence in him, even  though he wouldn't show any signs of it until years later), they were   pretty funny at times.With this record and its equally great (though more  punky) follow-up RAW POWER,the Stooges  come off as the ultimate punk  band.Definitely one of the all- time greats.
B000002WYT|5.0|Together with &quot;Under the Table&quot;, this CD  convincingly  chronicles the reasons why DMB should be regarded as one of the most  innovative bands in the world. This is a classic, all the way.
0793518326|5.0|An amazing compilation. As a longtime Beatle fan and musician I can't say  enough about this astounding colection. Complete and accurate. A must for  any musicain that wants to know the Beatles
0964385619|5.0|I just want to thank the authors.  &quot;Keep it simple&quot; is the  message I got, along with the secrets.  My parents ARE the &quot;poor&quot;  parents in your book.  I knew these beliefs were up side down.  Now I know  I am not wrong in thinking beyond &quot;Keeping it safe&quot;.  <br />Thank  you !!!!!
0385493622|5.0|One complaint I've had to my professors is the lack of historical  background for the sciences.  After thousands of years of development math  had come to a dramatic complexity one forgets its humble beginnings.  This  book has inspired me a lot not to forget the importance of the human  interaction in search of a goal and the motivation behind it.  For the  non-mathematicians this book is not technical at all and incredibly  enjoyable!
B000009DUY|3.0|If you're looking for the Edith Piaf song that was used in the movie, it's  not on this disc.  The song is called Tu Es Partout and can be found on  Pearl CD 7820.
B000002AV5|5.0|This combination of Sade's music from beginning to end is only lacking in  the exclusion of any instrumental tracks.  In everything else, however,  this shines forth as thge Ultimate beginner Sade experience, as well as the  CD to take when you can't fit all 4 into the disc magazine in your trunk  without alienating the one's you love.  I highly recommend it!
0684874350|4.0|I listended to this on audio while driving in remote locations. If I was  looking for something to pick me up I found it. If I was looking for  something to depress me I found it. From time to time I wanted to stop  listening to this Irish voice but I could not. It was at times unbelievably  sad. This is a modern day autobiography that could have been about the  early 1800's. I am sure it happened, I wish it had not. I am sure it is  still happening all over the world, and I wish it was not.  And not once  did the author ask for pitty about his experiences. He just wrote about  them. A good read.
B00000AFGM|5.0|I think this CD is one of the best Marilyn Manson has created. It brings  out alot of his special technique and music style. Marilyn Manson has a lot  of talent,and he can create any type of music he desires, this CD proves  that his talent is only for people to judge. And he has lots of it, this CD  is proof.I love Mansons music and I hope everone out there can realize his  talent with lyrics and music composition.
0140042520|5.0|In &quot;On the Road,&quot; there were several points during which  Kerouac's unusual way of wording things inspired a certain feeling of  contentment or sorrow in me, but in &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; I really  lived those feelings. His descriptions of the scenes and events in this  book really capture the moment and preserve it for we unfortunate people  who weren't there. I found &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot; much more enjoyable  reading than &quot;On the Road;&quot; it doesn't go on pointlessly in quite  the same way. There's a clearer focus, on the religious, introspective side  of Kerouac's attitudes, and the storyline lets us know exactly what it was  like to be a Dharma bum.
B000002NHN|5.0|I was browsing through a small record store in Las Vegas (of all places!)  when this CD came over the PA - it was just wonderful! After the second  track, I just had to get it, now I'm hooked! My wife fell in love with it,  first play - rest assured, we'll be buying more of Ms McKennitt.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Never been a &quot;big&quot; Manson fan...but I have to say that after  hearing &quot;The Dope Show&quot;, I HAD to have this album.  Marilyn is a  master at manipulation (check out &quot;I Don't Like Drugs, but the Drugs  Like Me and &quot;Fundamentally Loathsome&quot;) and you'll hear it!   Easily the most accessible album from this group.  The glam get-up really  reminds me of the Bowie of yesteryear.  Buy this CD...you won't be  disappointed!
0375403477|2.0|I am a Tom Clancy fan. At least of his 'large book' series. I looked forward to Rainbow Six. I was sorely disappointed. The characters wrer colorless. The plot was bizarre and the action sequences were anti climatic. The ending was a drag.
B000002KIE|5.0|groundbreaking. I cant believe someone would give this band a 1 star  rating. As a teenager I played the guitar and when i heard this album I was  floored. Q: How did the guitarist get his guitar to make that weird noise  at the end of holiday in the sun? (I think its that one) A: He was flipping  between the front and back pickups, genius. There are alot of things on  this album that led the way for others. The screaming in your face vocals  that were still understandable. Unfortunatly many bands that followed just  went for the screaming and the message is lost...i.e. I havent listened to  the Crass or Exploited in 5 or 10 years. Well, I just wanted to add 5 stars  to this because it is worth it. This is one of those albums that are a must  for any collection. Husker Du-Zen Arcade, Clash-London Calling,  Minutemen-Double Nickels, and Pistols-Nevermind.....trust me on this, I  know what I'm talking about.
B000002JR8|5.0|&quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; is the heaviest and most aggressive outing  by the boys from Texas.  It far surpasses their major label debut  &quot;Cowboys From Hell&quot; and &quot;Vulgar Display of Power&quot;, not  to mention &quot;The Great Southern Trendkill&quot;, which has been  heralded as their heaviest CD yet.  But &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot; blows  these other ones out of the water.
B000002GB9|2.0|Once upon a time in the '70s when I was a foolish teenager, I bought this  album because it was megapopular at the time.  I quickly realized that if I  was ever going to like this album, I was going to have to get past Dennis  DeYoung's godawful voice.  It just grated on my nerves something terrible.   Well, I never could get past his voice.  &quot;Ieeeeemmm SAyyyleeeng  Ay-wayeeeee.&quot;  Arrgggh!!  Anyone for frisbee?
B00000AFWW|5.0|This CD is one of the best i've heard in a while. Love sounds really good,  and most of all sober. You know how people say we're always evolvin? Well,  they've evolved, they haven't left their punk heritage, you can still hear  it, just not as harshly.  BUY THIS CD, IT ROCKS!!
B000002LN9|5.0|This is Eric's best solo live album. It has a great selection of songs,  and the band backs him up perfectly. His blues band, with Buddy Guy and  Robert Cray, plays incredibly, especially in Watch Yourself. He plays great  versions of Cream songs, especially Badge, and from his Journeyman album,  particularly Pretending. This CD has his best version of Wonderful Tonight,  with beautiful backup singing by Katie Kisson, who is great in Bell Bottom  Blues, too. There's also Hard Times, one of his favorite songs, and his  heartfelt version is wonderful. Heart of Darkness is an odd choice to be in  the CD, but it's good too. All in all, a must-have.
B000006045|5.0|A warning to everybody: MEZZANINE is a great album, but you will have to  listen to it many times before you really appreciate it (especially if you  liked the other Massive Attack albums). In my view, their sound has changed  significantly since PROTECTION - it has become much darker and much more  mellow.
B000002G8L|4.0|This double-CD is not my favorite live Clapton (that would be 24 Nights),  but it's great anyway. Eric plays great guitar throughout the CDs, but the  band doesn't seem to be in the same mood as him. However, if you like  Clapton, you'll like this one, especially for great versions of Cocaine,  Lay Down Sally, After Midnight, and If I Don't Be There By Morning.
B000002MY3|1.0|Save your money and buy Joan Osborne's &quot;Relish&quot; instead.  This  overhyped, crass album is a sad excuse for musical freedom for women.   Alanis, do you kiss your mother with that mouth?  For an excellent album by  a female singer from (I believe) the same year, try (Austin's) Toni Price's  &quot;Hey&quot; or her even better debut album: &quot;Sail Away.&quot;
1573220485|5.0|The Beach was a book that stays with you long after you read it, and you  find yourself wanting to read it again when you are through. The main  character was complex but also seemed like a guy you might know, because he  seemed slightly arrogant but also insecure. Personally, I found it  interesting because I, like the main character, was born in 1974, and he  remembers certain things that I remember and sees things in the unique way  of people in their twenties. He wants to find a place that's perfect and is  too naive not to know that where there are people, this going to be  conflict.
B000002HRE|5.0|I think this is an excellent album, I've been a fan for many years and I  think this is the best album to date.  This album is for everyone, not just  Hard Rock/Heavy Metal fans.
B0000009RX|3.0|WOITFTM is almost universally praised as Zappa's best album, but to my  relatively young ears it hasn't dated well at all. Critics routinely cream  themselves over its potshots at the Flower Power generation, which  unfortunately have lost much of their satirical bite in the ensuing thirty  years. The CD reissue also boasts tinny sound quality, the worst of any of  Zappa's albums. By no means is it a bad album, but it pales in comparison  to &quot;Absolutely Free&quot; and &quot;Weasels Ripped My Flesh,&quot; two  of Zappa's genuine masterpieces.
B00000AFFI|4.0|Is This Desire is a great album. I only gave it four stars because it  lacks the emotion and integrity that To Bring You My Love had. I enjoy PJ  Harvey's roughness, such as on Long Snake Moan. This is no where to be  found on this album. The lyrics aren't as ambigious as To Bring You My  Love. This is a little different than I am used to from PJ, but it is still  excellent!
B000002UA2|4.0|I must admit it...I own every Pink Floyd album.  Due to what I imaged was  the sheer brilliance of most of their other albums I allowed this one to  languish in the background, spending more of my time with &quot;Wish You  Were Here&quot; and &quot;Meddle&quot;.  Now I see that doing so was a  crime.<br />&quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot; may not reach the heights of some  of Floyd's other masterpieces, but it conveys a certain indescribable mood.   It is a solid piece of music taken as a whole.  Certain songs that would  seem trite out of context are given meaning when one listens to the entire  album in one sitting.<br />This album is a great experience (and a good  purchase for someone seeking to explore music's boundaries), but perhaps  those listeners who only like Pink Floyd for &quot;The Wall&quot; and  &quot;Dark Side...&quot; will not appreciate its depths.
B000002C1X|5.0|I'm a Pink Floyd fan ever since &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; w/ The  Wizard of Oz playing at the same time ... and if I weren't hit with one of  Pink Floyd's bricks from his wall, i wouldn't say they would be kick-ass!   This album rocks from &quot;Run like Hell&quot; to whereever Pink Floyd's  runnin' to!
B000002GB6|5.0|if you like herb alpert with a twist of cheer. if you like good mood  music. if you like competent musicians showing their stuff. if you shy away  from best hits compilations and want to buy a great CD buy this one.
B000002U82|5.0|THE WIZARD OF OZ, MGM, 1939.  ... If it weren't for The Wizard of Oz or  Pink Floyd, we humans wouldn't exist!  Pink Floyd briliantly put their  &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; music to cover with the movie &quot;The  Wizard of Oz&quot;.  Now, don't forget to mute your TV, make popcorn, and  put on a lazerlight show, if you have them.  Go Dorothy!  Follow the yellow  brick road, but don't let that damn witch bother you!
B000002MY3|5.0|It's no wonder that Alanis is the biggest selling female of all time! She  is the most intelligent young women that I know of. Just listen to her  vocablary when she speaks, and the lyrics in her songs. She presents  herself beautifully. On top of her being the perfect role model, she has  the perfect album! &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; was released almost four  years ago, and I'm still loving it! I'm not just another fan attached to an  entertainer, I'm a human being that loves another human being, and not just  for her classic songs, but for who she is inside. I feel like I personally  know her. I since that she is a loving, kind-hearted human being. And I  think that because she is such a good song writer that people look past her  incredible, perfect voice. I'm her #1 admirer and I can't wait for her new  C.D, &quot;Sopposed Former Infatuation Junky&quot;!
B000002LMM|5.0|Angelo Badalamenti is the JazzMan! His unique combination of new-age and  jazz makes a startlingly eerie soundtrack which captures the essence of  David Lynch's TV series perfectly. A great listen...
0671867369|5.0|This book is far and away the greatest book I've ever read. As a student  of miltary history, I find this to be the best description of combat and it  takes me as close to combat as I ever want to come.
0385493622|5.0|If you studied Mathematics in university, you will wonder why you found  Mathematical History boring at that time.  If you are not familiar with the  subject, it's a very good introduction.
B00000D9TK|5.0|My husband and I saw her in Cincinnati and she performed the title track,  it was absolutely incredible. I know very little french but was still very  moved by the emotion the song radiates-- I am definately ordering a copy!!
0131103628|5.0|The book is concise and at times a little short on examples.  But it is a  reference more than a &quot;teach yourself&quot; guide (although an  excellent teaching reference when you have real teacher or guide to  &quot;fill in the blanks of real use&quot;).  The &quot;function  library&quot; sections at the end are indispensible when you want to  quickly (well under minute, usually, for me) find the return codes and  argument types for a function (and what functions exist!) without being  forced to read through 20 pages of textual description of the functions  just to get to the scattered pieces of required knowledge.<br />Well worth the  money!
B000002KET|5.0|Great Album for starters or longtime fans. Every track blows me away. This  album is very experimental in comparison to earlier material, but an  experiment that worked; even the keyboard based songs appeal to me.
B000002KFJ|4.0|Though short on full length songs, this album is worth a good listen. At  first listen to me, it seemed to lack the same fluidity that most Sabbath   Albums contain. To be sure of this, I listened to the album  a few more  times, and found myself wrong. Yes, some of the songs tended to run a bit  long, but the truth is that with Sab classics such as &quot;Symptom Of The  Universe&quot;, &quot;Hole in the sky&quot;, among others, things all  evened out.
B000002Q88|3.0|This is an odd collection of songs as compared to other albums.But, if you  are a fan of STEVE WALSH his vocal performance on this disc stands out head  and shoulders above his past efforts!Check out the tracks PREACHER and  RAINMAKER and I rest my case!STEVE WALSH is truly one of rocks greatest  vocalists of all time!Other note: FREAKS OF NATURE is a great disc,WHY  didn't it get any reconition?I liked STEETS music better than alot of  KANSAS' stuff.....
006016848X|4.0|The best endorsement I can give this book is that I took it out from the  library and I want to give it to my spouse to read.  When I read this book  I was apalled that I could be married for so many years and still have such  a poor understanding of women. This book gave me a lot of useful insights  into why she tries to be helpful and I intrepret it as nagging, or I don't  listen enough to her talk about her problems and she interprets it as my  not caring. The best parts are the sections that tell you &quot;When she  says... she really means&quot; and &quot;When he says... he really  means.&quot;<br />Although admittedly my spouse probably understands me a lot  better than I do her, I think this book will at least provide the  foundation for a more meaningful dialogue. Definitely required reading for  husbands! It gets an enthusiastic &quot;thumbs up&quot; from me.<br />P.S. The  woman who wrote &quot;Self Absorbed Males Get Excused Again&quot; totally  missed the point.
B000005J56|5.0|The musicianship is stunning. I read reviews and expected the collection  to be good but it's nothing short of sensational. If you can listen to this  music and not dance around the room, you're officially dead.
0312853238|5.0|Ender's Game is a startling tour de force of intense emotion.  Card has  written the best military novel, sci-fi or otherwise, of all time.  And  Ender Wiggin is my favorite literary character.  A brilliantly put  together, marvelously exciting and intense novel.  Of course, nothing can  beat Frank Herbert's incomparable novel Dune, but Ender's Game comes darned  close.  The sequels are also good, especially Speaker for the Dead.
0515123447|5.0|I enjoyed this fast paced thriller by first time author, Lee Child.  Jack  Reacher was a compelling character, and the plot was  interesting...Hopefully, Reacher will be @ for many more thrillers
B0000028M7|5.0|This album has defined who they are, and where they come from.  The album  is more of a true to life feeling of being a junkie.  They give more of  that point of view.  This album depicts suicide, drug addiction, and even  love in a manner I have never ever heard.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|After all these years Phil finally comes to his senses and releases a CD  of his best recordings.Every track on this album is a winner.If you're an  80's music fan then this long awaited CD of Phil's best is for you .
B00000AFDW|4.0|Definately worth the wait though I was a bit disapointed that so many  songs were written with outside writers, especially since Ace writes some  great stuff. On the whole though the album rocks and I'll be there front  row and center for the tour, in more than one city.
B000002GFT|5.0|It's a joy to hear the sounds of the Fairport Convention and Sandy Denny's  lovely voice again and again and again.  Listening to 'Come All Ye' brings  back the whole feeling of the Sixties and the spirit that moved me. It  moves me still.
0399143904|3.0|I agree with a lot of the reader-reviews I have seen of this book.  It does not come close to approaching Clancy's previous books. His characters have all become one dimensional killing machines, very similar to Hollywood's misrepresentations of Jack Ryan and friends. The story meanders and is guessable by the second quarter of the book, Clark and company will ride in to save the day!  It is also a weak repackaging of the storyline from Executive Orders, without Jack Ryan.<br />Another thing that bothers me is the editorial style of the book.  I counted no less than five spelling errors and a couple of technological mistakes.  Another problem is that Clancy will toss out a military acronym and not bother to explain what he is talking about. In earlier books, he very subtly would let the reader know what things were without talking down to them.<br />Lastly, what is with that picture on the jacket cover?
B0000029LG|5.0|This is the best of Jackson's. This is the best music CD I've ever heard.  It is meaningful, it is melodeous, it is unique. Michael, please keep  creating. Don't stop..Finally, someone had the talent to make a revolution  in music....although there is a budding band (Mars Accelerator), who is  starting to blossom...good luck to them too.
0440180295|1.0|To judge by your reviews, I'm certainly in the minority.  I read this book  for a reading group and the best thing I can say is that it was mercifully  short.  I found the style disjointed and artifical. True, it gave one a  desolate feeling about war and its follies, but cerainly other books have  done it better, certainly in a more attainable less tedious style.
B000002C4J|1.0|She has a greate voice..no doubt about that. I wish she would use it to  create something unique...in the music world.  What is this world coming  to...same old boring love songs..one after another. Don't get me wrong.  Love is essential. But, if we keep doing the same old thing, where is the  fun and excitement...Real talent is in creating something new with what you  got. For real talents,  listen to these CDs: Michael Jackson's History...  Mars Accelerator (a young new band from Seattle) and another artist who I  think is talented is Shiela Chandra.
B000006TSC|5.0|If you like progressive rock, you'll love this. The track &quot;Summer  Lightning&quot; has Andy Latimer doing some of the best lead guitar you'll  ever hear on a Camel album. As with all of their albums, this album has a  definite mood; it is sunnier than usual. Some tracks rock, others are so  laid back they are almost horizontal... Try the track &quot;Starlight  Ride&quot; as a contrast to the energy of &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;. The  production is OK, unfortunately the CD sounds nothing like the original  vinyl version and has some annoying &quot;ringing&quot; and  &quot;fuzz&quot; on the keyboards on &quot;Summer Lightning&quot;.
B00000ADG2|2.0|Although you could never say that this album is a complete wash, it never  even got close to tickling my mind, catching me off guard with a fresh,  unexpected turn of melody or riddim or sound splash.  It ended up sounding  way too cliche...and pardon the paraphrase...but...&quot;Everything she  dropped was so tired.&quot;
B000003PB7|4.0|Listen to the title track - Andy Latimer doing some neat stuff with that  lead guitar and making Carlos Santana sound like an amateur in the process.  The rest of the album is different to past albums in that it isn't as  esoteric. Some of it could almost be Alan Parsons Project (I suppose Chris  Rainbow on vocals on some tracks has something to do with that). As with  all Camel offerings, this album grows on you.
B00000AFDW|4.0|If you wondered where the past 20 years of KISStory went, you can hear  them hear.  It's like were back in 1978... and that's a good thing.  This  is the REAL KISS.  8 out of 10 songs kick ass.  Just skip the others  (Within, You Wanted the Best).  This is what all fans have been waiting  for.  Enjoy!
B000002IZM|5.0|I often hear people criticizing this soundtrack,not for it's content,but  for what it doesn't contain.After having heard several bootlegs of the  Blade Runner soundtrack I can honestly say the Vangelis original score is  by far the most cohesive and textured.&quot;One more kiss,dear&quot;,often  called the most out of place song on the score,seems to blend the  futuristic elements of the synthesized music with a 40's film noir  feel-this was director Ridley Scott's original vision!Overall this score  overwhelms the senses with the richness and power of the most classic  sci-fi/suspense crossover ever made...for the hardcore Blade Runner  fan,this soundtrack is essential.
B000002IAS|4.0|This is a wonderful live album featuring Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett,  along with Eric Clapton and Dave Mason.  In addition to the stars this is  the first time I heard this particular grouping of backup musicians, let by  Jim Gordon (drums), Carl Radle (bass) and others.  These musicians went on  to backup Steve Winwood in Traffic, George Harrison in the Concert for  Bangladesh, Joe Cocker on the Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour (with Leon  Russel) and Eric Clapton (Derek and the Dominoes, and his hit single  Layla).  A truly talented gathering, and this CD features hard-driving rock  and soulful ballads by Bonnie.  Enjoy!!
B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard helped to define not only the eighties rock sensibility, but  they also helped to pave the way for modern rock n' roll, and what better  way to celebrate than with all of their best songs. &quot;Pour Some Sugar  on Me,&quot; &quot;Hysteria,&quot; &quot;Love Bites,&quot;  &quot;Rocket,&quot; &quot;Armageddon It,&quot; and &quot;Animal&quot;  (weren't all of these on Hysteria?) are probably the best songs on the  album, but &quot;Photograph&quot; is probably THE best IMHO. the rest of  the album is vintage Def Leppard, and it all kicks ass! simply the best  possible collection of their greatest hits!
B00000099Y|5.0|The music of Tool is the kind that  grows on you considerably and doesn't   tire or wear out much like most of the music these days. A beautiful voice   combined with haunting music make this  a must have for any music  collection....
B000001E21|5.0|A collection of unreleased songs is always good for any band that has been  established as one of the hottest and biggest acts around. This is an  excellent compilation of Def Leppard songs that didn't make it. Both the  acoustic and electric versions of &quot;Miss You in a Heartbeat,&quot; and  &quot;Two Steps Behind,&quot; are probably among the most emotional songs  the group has ever produced. &quot;Desert Song&quot; has one of the best  solos Clark and Collen ever did, as did &quot;Fractured Love,&quot; whose  updated intro was simply incredible (being a guitar player myself, I know  nothing sounds as good as an E-Bow). Overall, the album is well produced  and compiled. A wise choice for Def Leppard to finally release it.
0553208845|5.0|You will enter into a complete state of willingness to be at one with your  world after reading this story.  It has given my life a spiritual lift and  has really changed my tone of thought.  I hope you'll pick this book up and  envelope yourself in it as I did, and love it whole heartedly.
B000002IZM|5.0|Vangelis is an artist...as such he makes an album according to his own  artistic statement. You won't find every bit of music he composed for the  film Blade Runner on this because he didn't feel like including it. You can  complain about it, but take this album as not a soundtrack to the film. but  rather as another album from a fine musician. The unreleased tracks he  composed in '82, &quot;Blush Response,&quot; &quot;Rachel's Song,&quot; and  &quot;Damask Rose,&quot; and the brand new &quot;Wait For Me&quot; are  absolutely incredible, as is the rest of the music. The famous &quot;Blade  Runner-End Titles,&quot; and &quot;Tears in Rain&quot; are the best tracks.  It is difficult to imagine that music such as this was made sixteen years  ago, proving that Vangelis is a man ahead of his time. His music is simply  enjoyable, moody, and hypnotizingly beautiful. Get this album, but remember  that you won't find everything that was in the film. Don't let this spoil  the experience.
0684800713|5.0|I had never read Heminway before though I always wanted to. I read this  book in a little less than two days. It really hooked me. An excellent  novel, but the characters are infuriatingly childish and irresponsible.  <br />If you are sick (like myself) of writers who take five pages to describe  an armchair (mainly because they're in love with their own writing) I'd  give Hemingway a go. His writing style is quite direct and unadorned. It's  lovely, to be frank.
B000002U9L|5.0|David Bowie complains that he sold out in the eighties. This soundtrack  would seem to prove him wrong. His music is so unique and enjoyable, and  Trevor Jones' score complements Bowie's musical and acting performance  perfectly. &quot;Magic Dance&quot; is one of the best tracks on the album.  the movie was incredible, and this soundtrack is right up there with  Legend, Dune, &amp; Blade Runner.
0060392584|4.0|This is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time.  In  fact, I'm going to read it again because it is just so chock full of  interpretation of nearly everything that can be philosophized, one doesn't  give every curiousity some thought .  Manson is a very good writer for  someone who is not generally a writer first.  He opens up the door to an  ugly &amp; harsh world that must be peered into to widen the horizons of  perception.
B000001DV2|4.0|Def Leppard is one of those few bands that manages to mix sex and  intelligence in their music and lyrics. With Adrenalize, the band shows  that they have not lost their intelligence amidst the pain and turmoil they  went through with the death of their first guitarist Steve Clark. Phil  Collen (always my favorite of the two anyway) plays all the guitar parts  with clarity and capturing Clark's essence without sacrificing his own  identity in the music. The songs are very listenable as well. &quot;White  Lightning,&quot; and &quot;I Wanna Touch You&quot; are the two best tracks  IMHO. Overall, Def Leppard made another good album...
B000002C4J|1.0|I would rather listen to a dentist drill for an hour.
B000001FKY|5.0|Indisputably Def Leppard's best album. &quot;Armageddon It,&quot;  &quot;Pour Some Sugar on Me,&quot; &quot;Rocket,&quot; and  &quot;Hysteria&quot; are among some of the best songs the band has ever  written, and they're all on this album. The real gem to me is &quot;Love  Bites,&quot; but the entire album just kicks serious ass!!! It is still  great to listen to today after over a decade.
0399143904|2.0|I want a discount on a future Clancy for finishing this one. Too many  scenes at the firing range. Too many undefined acronyms. Too many reminders  of what happened in earlier chapters. An incredibly insulting ending. I  chalk it up to author arrogance. A victim of his success. I hope he gets a  wake up call from his publisher and rebounds with something worthwhile.

B00000AFFF|5.0|Once upon a time, around ten years ago, I lived in a lovely apartment just  off Lake Merritt. As in most apartment buildings, tenants' could easily  hear other tenants' goings on. It was during this time, that in addition to  listening to quite a variety of Classical, Jazz and Pop, that I felt  impelled to re acquaint myself with some of the wonderful music I had heard  growing up in the 60's and early 70's. Namely, the music of Burt Bacharach  with a young Dionne Warwick. This glorious music, tunes like: Alfie, Are  You There (With Another Girl), The Windows Of The World, I Just Don't Know  What To Do With Myself and many others, seemed to play on happily and  continually for months. While I listened contentedly, my neighbors could be  heard screaming,&quot;Put something else on already!&quot; I could listen  on and on to these arrangements, orchestrations, and beautiful vocals, but  may have over estimated my neighbors' appetite.      Now I live in a  charming apartment in Bethesda, where the sounds of the new Burt  Bacharach/Elvis Costello release Painted From Memory, has filled the air  and begun seeping through the walls.I fear this may continue for a long  time. Painted From Memory was composed and produced by Bacharach and  Costello. In it they combine moving lyrics with tuneful melody for great  emotional impact. Gorgeous orchestrations of lush, sweeping and vibrant  strings, along with soul filled singing define these songs of love, loss  and longing. On tunes such as In The Darkest Place, I Still Have That Girl,  and This House Is Empty Now (the obvious sequel to A House Is Not A Home),  Costello pleads with former, present and future loves. This is an  exceptional work. A rare one, without misstep.      In the last year or so  a lot of attention has been paid to the music of Burt Bacharach. McCoy  Tyner and his Trio recorded a fine CD of Bacharach's music accompanied by  symphony orchestra. Bill Frisell, Joey Baron, Marc Ribot and other somewhat  avant musicians recorded an eclectic take of his music for a CD titled  Great Jewish Music: Burt Bacharach. And his influence is unmistakable in  the works of pop greats Pizzicato Five. Particularly on tunes like Fortune  Cookie from their The Sound Of Music CD. This music should be appealing to  you as well.      Along with Copland, Gershwin, and Ellington, Bacharach is  one of the most important and prolific American Composers of this century.  His collaborations with Warwick and Costello have been particularly  fruitful. So, if by any chance, you hear these sounds wafting in through  your home, pay careful attention. Better yet, run do not walk to the  closest CD shop and buy a copy or two. Pick up a new Costello and an old  Dionne Warwick. You will be amply rewarded.
B000002GY9|5.0|This is an incredible album, and a perfect introduction to his early  (pre-Swordfishtrombones) work. From the catchy &quot;Step Right Up&quot;  and &quot;The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me)&quot; to the hipster poetry  of &quot;Small Change&quot; to the larger-than-life romantic self-pity of  &quot;The One That Got Away,&quot; no one can turn a cool phrase like  Waits.
0380002930|5.0|A warm and wonderful book.  Sadness, happiness, defeat, victory, it is all  told in this tale of a rabbit community suddenly faced with disaster.
B000002GQK|4.0|Well, Their 6th album is great, but I wouldn't call it their best. I  acually find &quot;Procession&quot; to be a great, well, kinda-song. The  sounds are a bit frightening sometimes,though. &quot;The Story In Your  Eyes&quot; and &quot;After You Came&quot; are two hard-core, on the edge  rockers. &quot;Our Guessing Game&quot; is hauntingly gorgeous and  &quot;Emily's Song&quot; is okay. &quot;One More Time To Live&quot; is a  masterpiece and so is &quot;My Song&quot; and &quot;You Can Never Go  Home&quot;. Here is the album's biggest problem,- &quot;Nice To Be  Here&quot;, which may be Thomas' worst all-time song. It's so cheezy. It  sounds like a Sesame Street rip-off. Anyway, it is a great album, but not  really their best.   --NAA26921.907272220/online-7.amazon.com--
B000001EYO|4.0|This album is just like a Coen Bros. film. There's Coen Bros.  &quot;Good&quot; and Coen Bros. &quot;Great!&quot; This is Coen Bros.  &quot;Great!&quot; Eclectic. Unexpected. And that's what one should expect  from them.  From Bob Dylan's &quot;The Man in Me&quot; to &quot;Gluck Das  Mir Verblieb&quot; from the opera &quot;Die Tote Stadt&quot; to Townes Van  Zandt's &quot;Dead Flowers&quot;, this cd is perfect for those who  appreciate a broad variety of musical stylings. If you're pretty open  minded and a fan of the Coen Bros.' you'll love it. If you follow what pop  culture tells you what to think, stay away.  Thanks, Joel, Ethan, and  Carter.  Follow the muse, and keep us guessing.
0517123207|5.0|I started reading this book expecting to find offensive, disrespectful,  and vicious material throughout it.  What I came to realize instead, was  that people have criticized this book based on offensive, disrespectful and  vicious accusations.  I can't identify how people have linked this work to  God and blasphemy.  It has nothing to do with religion, faith, or creation.   This is a work of observation, logic, and adaptability.  It makes perfect  sense, and trust me, it is in no way offensive. <br /> To think that for a  century people have been debating, fighting, and cursing Charles Darwin  over this work seems comical once you read his book.  The book is written  in easy to understand common language, allowing the not so biologically or  anthropologically astute to understand it as well. Even if you are not  convinced by Darwin's observations, you will be convinced that there is no  threat to anyone's beliefs from this book. <br /> I found this work to be very  convincing and highly compatible with my faith in God.  It does not  threaten God, and it certainly does not require me to abandon any beliefs  even though I fully understand and agree with Mr. Darwin. Read this book,  it is worthy of consideration and it is only fair to hold judgment until  after you have read it.
0671004107|5.0|I love this book.  The movie was fantastic, but the book is better.  I'm  not going to explain to story to you because there are lots of people who  have already done that here.  I'm simply going to give it my highest rating  and let you read it to discover why.
B000002513|5.0|Without a doubt, the most creative, vibrant, life-giving album ever put  out be Bruce Springsteen.  His lyrics will transport you to the Jersey  Shore, walking down the boardwalk with Sandy, looking for Madam Marie.   From the first offering, &quot;The E-Street Shuffle&quot;, to &quot;New  York City Serenade&quot;, Bruce bombards you with an ensemble sound that  creates complex and intense music rarely found in today's recordings.  7  minutes with Rosy, and still I want so much more.  Of all the unbelievable  songs on this album, I recommend &quot;Wild Billy's Circus Story&quot; as  the one to listen to in order to appreciate the greatness of Bruce  Springsteen.  Then try and find a live version of Rosy(&quot;Live  1975-85&quot; will give you a good one), and you will understand all of us  that yell &quot;Bruuuuuce!&quot; any time we can.
B0000027DJ|5.0|One of Alice's best efforts.  About the time you think its going mellow,  he goes high voltage and really gets your heart pumping.  ROCK SOLID.
B000000WCX|5.0|After an upsetting silence, Bowie has returned with EART HL I NG, and I  like it. This album is perhaps one of the best Bowie albums ever.  &quot;Little Wonder&quot; gained a lot of attention as a result of the  bizarre video, but the song is much better on its own.  &quot;Looking For  Satellites&quot; is a bit boring, but not bad.  &quot;Battle for Britain  (The Letter)&quot; is a kick ass dance tune.  &quot;Seven Years In  Tibet&quot; is a disturbing and catchy ode to Tibet's state of crisis.   &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; is the only true electronica track, and it's a  great song (the others are more industrial).  &quot;Telling Lies&quot;,  &quot;The Last Thing You Should Do&quot;, and &quot;I'm Afraid Of  Americans&quot; are the trilogy of odd yet catchy songs, and &quot;Law  (Earthlings on Fire)&quot; is almost rave.  all in all, a classic album,  and a must-have for any collection.
0062502182|5.0|This is a powerful book because every reader can extract values and  fundamental advices from it , no matter where is he from, what culture he  has, better yet where era he is from.  This universal character of the book  comes from its abstract side dressed with a story of someone in the search  of a tresor.  This book applies to every person since all what it says  relates to the human nature.  No wonder it was translated to many languages  and made the bestseller in many countries.  It's a wonderful book.
B0000025DI|5.0|&quot;Changing of the Guards&quot;, &quot;Senor&quot; and &quot;Is Your  Love in Vain&quot; are all great tunes, but the rest of the album is pretty  darn good too.  I think this one was dismissed pretty quickly as a sloppy,  sell-out album.  Admittedly, some of it sounds like they were just rolling  tape during rehearsal and then said &quot;good enough&quot;.  Especially  the female back up singers, who sometimes don't seem to have a clue how to  synchronize all the syllables they have to sing.  But for me, that just  makes the album more engaging.  It hold up to multiple listenings as well  as virtually any of Dylan's classics.
B000002H4C|5.0|If you know the movie, you know the music.  Todate, the best soundtrack in  the heavy metal genre'.  Worth every penny and a lot more.
0060920084|1.0|This is the sort of book that prompts one to ask, \\"what is the purpose of  travel writing?\\"<br />Should it inform us about places we will never go and  people we will never meet? Amaze us with tales of grandeur and exotica?  Must travel writers seek out and celebrate the remaining pockets of  difference and distinction in a world all too quickly tending toward  homogeneity? Or should they seek to unite us, teasing out threads of common  human experience from beneath the misunderstanding and fear that so often  blanket us when we contemplate The Other. <br />Of course, good travel writing  -- from the journeys of Herodotus in a Mediterranean-centered world to Eric  Newby high in the Hindu Kush or Redmond O'Hanlon deep in Borneo -- does all  of these things, and entertains us in the process.<br />Not, alas, Bill Bryson  -- his highest aim is to entertain, and this he manages to do roughly on  the level of an extended fart joke. <br />In this book, Mr Bryson - an  American who lives in England - goes on a car journey across the  continental United States. He travels alone, staying in motels and eating  in restaurants. Some evenings he finds a comfortable bed or an acceptable  meal. These times, he is happy and he says nice things.<br />Much more often,  however, Bill Bryson isn't happy. He dislikes the big cities, which he  finds very big. He also dislikes the small towns, yes, for their smallness.  He despises equally the conveniences of tourist towns and the inconvenience  of towns that do not cater to tourists. He finds the East is too  industrial, the West too cold and empty; the South is unpleasantly hot;  there is too much corn in Iowa. On and on he goes. Everywhere, he finds  stupid people.<br />When Bill Bryson is unhappy, which is most of the time, he  vents his spleen on whatever town or city happens to disappoint him.  Occasionally, his invective is amusing; more often, it is predictable and  juvenile. A sample of the Bryson wit, picked more or less at random: \\"...  his name wasn't Mr Toerag, of course. It was Mr Superdickhead.\\"<br />As a  humorist, Bill Bryson specialises in easy targets. Overweight Americans are  particular favourites, as are those with regional accents. Here is a  conversation between Mr Bryson and a Mississippi police officer, both of  whom are in their cars, stopped at a stoplight:<br /> ... he said, \\"How yew  doin'?\\"  This so surprised me that I answered, in a cracking voice,  \\"Pardon?\\"  \\"I said how yew doin'?\\"<br />Bryson responds that he is fine,  and the officer asks if he is on vacation.<br /> \\"Yup.\\"  \\"Hah doo lack  Miss Hippy?\\"  \\"Pardon?\\"  \\"I say, `Hah doo lack Miss Hippy?'\\"  I  was quietly distressed. The man was armed and Southern and I couldn't  understand a word he was saying to me. \\"I'm sorry,\\" I said, \\"I'm kind of  slow, and I don't understand what you're saying.\\"  \\"I say\\" - and he  repeated it more carefully - \\"how doo yew lack Mississippi?\\"  It dawned  on me. \\"Oh! I like it fine! I like it heaps! I think it's wonderful. The  people are so friendly and helpful.\\" I wanted to add that I had been there  for an hour and hadn't been shot at once, but the light changed and he was  gone, and I sighed and thought, \\"Thank you, Jesus.\\"<br />So Bryson escapes  from his brush with the law, but not from his stereotype of the South (or  from any of the many other stereotypes of Americans). The above  conversation, almost the longest in the book, is one of the few times  Bryson talks to someone who isn't a waitress (another group he delights in  mocking).<br />Perhaps we should feel pity for Bill Bryson as he drives around  America, completely failing to engage with its people or to penetrate  beyond the its service industries and, occassionally, museums. But he gives  us very little reason to do so. Bill Bryson appears no deeper than his own  shallow lampooning.<br />For a part of this book, Bryson is retracing the  family vacations of his childhood. But in bringing these earlier adventures  to life, he relies on more of the two-dimensional caricaturing that so  fails to animate the rest of the book: his mother, says Bryson, spoke only  to feed the family (\\"Another sandwich, dear?\\"). His father, more fully  characterised, manages to be both the most interesting and the most  sympathetic person in the book. Every summer, it seems, Bryson senior would  load his wife and children into the car and drive off across the continent  in search of history, beauty or adventure. <br />Although rudely depicted by  his son as a skinflint, barely able to read a map, Bill Bryson's father  appears to have been a man who was passionate about his country. In one  scene, he is described spending an entire afternoon pacing off troop  movements on some historic battlefield (much to the boredom of his son, of  course). And, we are told, he frequently engaged in long, involved  conversations with the strangers he happened to meet. Bryson senior was, in  other words, a pretty good traveller.<br />Too bad he didn't write a book.
B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell has been given a great gift, and she has given it to us in  all of her music, especially this Masterpiece. Anyone who cannot get in  touch with their soul, while listening to Blue, simply doesn't have one.
0399143904|5.0|This book was fun to read.  It may not be the same style of book as past  Clancy novels, but then who wants to reread The Hunt For Red October every  time.  The only possible reason I can see for all of the negative reviews  is that some people probably agree with the enviromental wackos in this  book and had their feelings hurt because they  were the bad guys.
0449002632|5.0|While I am only 16, I bought London out of my own free will, and have  enjoyed it thouroughly! I found it gripping and I never wanted to put it  down. A great book (if you have alot of time on your hands!).
0671646788|5.0|I have read the portuguese translation of this wonderful book, and it is a  best-seller here in Brazil too. Once you read what Dr. Schwartz writes  about how important the way you dress yourself is, I am sure you will be a  winner !
0670880728|3.0|No, Bridget is not representative of all single women in their thirties.   No, this isn't one of those stream of consciousness yawns that some people  think of as literature (thank heavens).  Rather this is a wink and grin  portrait of life in the 90's and of all the silly, stupid, ridiculous  things we do when trying to manage our daily existence.  If you can laugh  at yourself, you'll get a kick out of it.  If you can't, you'd better pass.
B00000AFDW|4.0|Bringing old bandmates, Ace and Peter, was a tough one for me, because I  felt the previous drummer and guitarist (Eric Singer and Bruce Kulick) were  superior musicians who are much more interesting contributors to Paul  Stanley and Gene Simmons' songs. Check out previous--neglected--CD,  Carnival of Souls, great tunes that showed KISS continuing to evolve after  20+ years. Psycho Circus has some great tunes on it, the title track,  Simmons' tunes, &quot;Within&quot; and &quot;We Are One&quot;. Peter Criss'  ballad is such a wannabe &quot;Beth&quot; that it's sick. That's probably  the song that will be released. Ace makes a solid contribution to the  album, but I can't help wondering if this album would have been better with  the previous guitarist and drummer. Still, the CD lives up to  standards--KISS standards--pretty well.
B000000H57|5.0|I've followed the band since slow... and each time they get better.   Bloody kisses is the best and if I could give it 6 stars I would.  Rust is  very well done also though it is a little less gothic the guys still are  able to make a love song depressing as hell.  Just what we need.
B0000047CX|5.0|I heard 'Girl from Iponema' for the first time resonating though my  floorboards sometime before sunrise. An unmistakeable melody. Neighbors and  friends from college were dancing. Although I was still half asleep, I was  captivated and stayed until the sun rose. The MOST beautiful album I have  ever heard! Who would have thought twenty somethings would be slowly  dancing on a quiet night, especially for quiet stars that shone more than  30 years ago? Oh, how lovely...
B00000016O|5.0|this album is one of the reasons that i will never quit listening to rock  music (in any way, shape or form). albums like that appear very once in a  while but when they do the cool breeze they emanate, makes it worth the  wait. and, by they way, my favorite song is not the title song, is  &quot;New kid in town&quot; and then, &quot;Pretty Maids all in a row&quot;
B000000WFF|5.0|SPICE UP YOUR LIFE AND MAKE THE SECOND SPICE ALBUM A PART OF YOUR CD  COLLECTION. ADD A LITTLE SPICE TO GET THE PARTY HOPPING!! NO OTHER FEMALE  GROUP CAN OUTDUE THE SPICE GIRLS.

B000002UJQ|5.0|this is simply an amazing album. Exit music to a film is one of the most  brilliantly written songs in a long time...I'm not sure about the other  releases from radiohead though..Their upbeat stuff just lacks an emotion  that this album provides.
0679442790|5.0|To be honest, I checked out this book from the local library because the initial premise of a 15 year old male seduced by the 30-something old woman was so trashy and unappealling.  The book goes way beyond that.  It was necessary than the two central characters would actually represent different generations.  There is so much here.  How can people in a group setting get pulled along to do something they wouldn't ordinarily?  At her trial,she was rigorous about truth.  So much more. A book worth studying. I &quot;repent&quot;, and I look forward to purchasing this book for my permanent library
B000002LCK|5.0|There was a time when I lived the music that I bought.  Not that it only  formed my personality and gave a language to my emotions as music only can,  but I actually lived the songs which came through my headphones and into my  ears, and New Order's Substance 1987 was one of those albums that formed an  oft-visited auralscape of my adolescence.  The version I got (a tape I  bought after seeing them on 120 minutes) didn't include the B-sides and so  began with the youthful meloncholy of &quot;Ceremony&quot; and ended with  the almost-techno desperation and regret of &quot;True Faith&quot;.   Finally my own life is catching up with the progression reflected on this  album.  &quot;Ceremony&quot; must be one of the most beautiful musical  embodiements of sadness, and &quot;Temptation&quot; is one of the greatest  love songs ever composed.  &quot;Perfect Kiss&quot; and  &quot;Subculture&quot; were songs which planted seeds in my then youthful  and impressionable mind about club scenes in big cities like London and New  York.  In the present day of the New Electronica, New Order seems to be a  forgotten pillar and pioneer of this sound.
B00000AFDW|4.0|The second time I listened to it, it got me.  I like the faster Rock  songs.  The mellow ones seem to kill the momentum of the record. The title  track, With in, and Into the Void, stick out as the best songs.  You Wanted  the Best, Raise your Glasses, and Pledge Alligence to Rock n'Roll aren't  bad songs but they seem to be about the same thing, Kiss.  I stated on my  one-liner that there are no &quot;God of Thunder&quot; or &quot;Duece&quot;  on it because there nothing on it that is extremely innovative, it's hard  to believe that God of Thunder is a song from the Seventies.  And there's  nothing on it that will still kick your ass twenty years from now like,  Duece.  Anyway, I still can't wait for the Dodger Stadium show.
B00000AFFI|5.0|I have been anticipating Is This Desire? for some time now.  PJ Harvey  continues to astound me with a lyrical and musical depth that a lot of her  contemporaries completely lack.  I can't quite describe Is This  Desire?...it is simply fascinating.  It's great to hear PJ varying her  vocal style with each song.  I don't know what it is about her music, but  some of it downright scares me.  Angelene is a great beginning, too.

B000002G8N|5.0|Another Ticket is without a doubt Eric Clapton's best solo efforts.  This  collection consists of  many strong blues and rock n roll songs with Eric's  guitar at center stage.  In addition, Eric's songwriting prowess is at his  best as six of the nine songs were written or co-written by him.  I even  prefer this album to Layla due to the fact that these songs offer more  variety.  A definite MUST BUY!
B000001EMW|5.0|I wasn't sure how Metallica's music would sound played on cellos, but I  was totally blown away! I especially enjoy the versions of &quot;The  Unforgiven&quot; and &quot;Welcome Home&quot;. Can't wait to get the new  &quot;Inquisition Symphony&quot; which contains &quot;One&quot;, &quot;Fade  To Black&quot;, &quot;Bellz&quot;, and &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot;.
B000001F9E|5.0|&quot;Jailbreak&quot; is one of Thin Lizzy's best albums, and not just  because it contains the overplayed (but still great-sounding) hit &quot;The  Boys Are Back In Town&quot;. &quot;Romeo and the Lonely Girl&quot;,  &quot;Running Back&quot;, and &quot;Cowboy Song&quot; are all great tunes,  as well. Powered by Phil Lynott's teenage angst lyrics and a double lead  guitar attack, this disc rips from beginning to end. A must for any hard  rock enthusiast.
B000002E5J|5.0|Este DC de Shakira tiene una variedad de ritmos y demuestra un gran  talento vocal. Este DC tambien golpea la conciencia de quienes lo escuchan  por el profundo contenido de sus letras las que no se limitan a un solo  tema.
0553260111|5.0|I had to read it more than once! Hooked me on Ludlum.
B000002HJD|5.0|Even though the production of this album makes it the bastard child of the  Morrison legacy, it is the best of the bunch. This is an album that sounds  like no other. Morrisons overblown lyrics are wonderful... so many quotable  lines. The Doors often insipid sound comes across better here in the  context of background (or mood) music. The words and music are masterfully  mixed... the &quot;killler on the road&quot; section... the space of the  auditorium. But it is the writing and the voice that send this over the  top. Unless you cringe at the thought of spoken word, and you best enjoy  &quot;The End&quot; and &quot;When the Musics Over&quot;, this is the album  to buy.
6304711891|5.0|This is the greatest action movie ever and DVD makes it absolutely  amazing.  Three of my favorite actors: Nicholas Cage, Sean Conner, and Ed  Harris team up to make one darn good action flick!     END
B000002HMH|3.0|Many of the songs seemed good at first, but I tired of them after a while.   Still, I just love &quot;Bleeding Me&quot;, and can listen to it all day,  even if it's not &quot;classic&quot; Metallica.
B000005HO0|5.0|Wonderful recording from last The True MayheM's concert played together  with Dead and Euronymous. Almost impossible amount of brutal dark energy  radiating from this CD makes it A MUST-HEAR Black  Metal classic.   Extremity of this recording lies in Dead's vocals - sharp, fast singing -  and Euronymous' guitar. Those two were mighty Black Metallers - Hail to  them!
B000000OTU|5.0|I have to say that this has to be one of the best albums Aerosmith has  done.  I got almost all there albums, and none of them compares to this  one.
B000002U6E|5.0|I think L. A. Smith said it best in his review, when he called it  &quot;haunting, evocative and mysterious.&quot;  This CD is less about  music than about touching  sensual elements common to all human beings.  I  found it richly satisfying and look forward to future releases and similar  works from other artists. (if you know of any, e-mail me: javlin10@aol.com)
B000002O4X|5.0|From the first utterance of those words at the beginning of the movie,  John Barry's sweeping soundtrack is a feast of sound that accompanies this  most beautiful movie.  This is what orchestration is all about and I am  grateful to be living in a time that Mr. Barry has written music.  If that  sounds over the top or a bit melodramatic, just listen...
0399143904|5.0|Just when you thought Clancy has, and others in the Techno-War genre,  written every conceivable plot post WWII, a new interesting scenario pops  up.<br />Here you have an innocent bio-firm that has infiltrated all levels of  the American system, only to deceive us with a sinister plot to change the  face of the planet-- literally.<br />Its up to Rainbow, a covert  multi-national anti-terrorist team to unravel the many far-fetched but  related clues to stop this atrocity.  Led by the secretive John Clark,  Rainbow scours the political scene, sending his troops to disolve these  threats as they happen, before any more innocents get caught in the  crossfire.<br />Like all of Clany's works, the situations are highly detailed  and descriptive.  Many technological wonders are used, as well as luck and  detective work on a global scale.<br />The only thing missing from this book  was Jack Ryan, and I thought the conclusion was a slightly anti-climatic.
B000002N3N|5.0|I'm an Enya fan, to be sure, and this CD offers a nice  &quot;mix&quot;,(for lack of a better word) of styles. &quot;Pax  Deorum&quot; with it's chilling Latin refrains. &quot;La Sonadora&quot;  having a Spanish torreador ballad feeling, and the absolutely beautiful  refrains in &quot;Athair Ar Seamh&quot; display her vocal and writing  talents. And who can deny that &quot;China Roses&quot; is one of the most  smooth,sweet vocal pieces to grace a CD?? The Memory of Trees is a stellar  Enya disc!
B0000024U8|5.0|While Stills and Kooper evolve to greater, later works, Super Session  reflects the confusion of the sixties and should be savored as such.  An  era of undeclared war, getting back to nature &amp; going to the moon,  peace movements &amp; race riots, getting 'straight'&amp; waiting for  nuclear armageddon,   Super Session is pure wine of the times.  Initially I  felt dissapointed at the disjointed work. But as I listened it all came  rushing back.  This album is exactly what it was like to live in the  sixties: good, bad, scary and far out.
B000005RRF|5.0|The first Marillion-song I ever heard was a live version of Slainte Mhath  from The Thieving Mapie-album. I was hooked... That was 10 years ago.  Marillion is still one of my favourite bands, and the album that's still  most special to me is this one. I listen to it on my walkman a lot, walking  across town, on the train, or wherever... it doesn't really matter where,  because the music never fails to take me away to some different world. And  the lyrics... WOW... this is a man who isn't afraid to show what he's  feeling... Did this album change my life? Most definitely. Buy it!
B000001E7T|5.0|TO BRING YOU MY LOVE won virtually every Best Album award that could be  won in 1995 and won the prestigious Village Voice Pazz and Jop Poll (as  voted by several hundred top rock and music critics) as the Album of the  Year.  Polly Jean Harvey also managed the Rolling Stone Artist of the Year  Award on the basis of this album.  But the album is even better than that.  By any standard, the nineties has been one of the worst decades in the  history of rock, but this album stands as one of the glorious achievements  of the nineties, and PJ Harvey one of the few contemporary artists who can  stand comparison with rock figures from previous decades.<br />All of these  songs are about sex and sexuality, and not a very healthy sexuality at  that.  Despite the title of the album and opening song, love and its  healing power is completely missing in these songs.  What is present is sex  as obsession, as compulsion, as an animalistic force of nature, as  destructive, inescapable, and irrestible as a tidal wave or volcanic  irruption.  The album could as easily have been titled, TO BRING YOU THE  PLAGUE.<br />But the power in these demonic love songs surpasses that of any  other artist working in the nineties, and represents an exceptional  achievement by one of the few creative artists working in popular music in  an otherwise bland and banal period of time.
B000002OX7|5.0|This album should have been called Who's Best rather than Who's Next. It's  not a greatest hits album but if you thought &quot;Tommy&quot; and  &quot;Quad&quot; were the Who's Best, then you better listen to this one  now. Don't read any more reviews, just buy it!
B000005IRG|5.0|It is almost impossible to overpraise this album.  Tremendous songs,  clever lyrics, and extraordinarily cool guitar battles between Richard  Lloyd and Tom Verlaine.  Not widely known, but everyone that I have known  who was in a band (a couple nationally and even internationally known) was  a fanatic devotee.  Their influence on subsequent bands has been vastly out  of proportion to the number of people who know their music.  The album also  contains one of the best songs ever written about bad love, &quot;Venus de  Milo,&quot;  in which the singer laments that he &quot;fell into the arms  of Venus de Milo&quot; (for those who skipped art history, the famous  statue Venus de Milo has no arms).
0679745203|4.0|Reading this book, it's easy to remember that the author is mainly a poet,  not a novelist.  In fact, this is perhaps closer to an epic poem than to a  novel.  There isn't much of a plot, and there isn't really a theme or  message put forward by the author, but the prose is beautiful and a joy to  read.<br />Unlike most books, I would definitely recommend seeing the movie  before reading this book.  The reason is that the movie relies very much on  a sense of mystery- it's told in flashback, revealing bits of the story to  the viewer a bit at a time.  Much of the enjoyment of the movie (it's  pretty good, but Lawrence of Arabia it ain't) stems from wondering who the  characters are and what events led them to where they are, and discovering  the answers a piece at a time.  Having read the book will spoil the mystery  which is the heart of the movie.  On the other hand, the book is not about  plot at all- it's more a series of flowing images than a coherent  storyline.  The book relies on its beautiful language to entertain the  reader- having seen the events in the movie doesn't really detract from  that.<br />Again, if you're expecting a rousing adventure story in this book,  you will be sorely disappointed.  If you take it for what it is, a vehicle  for poetic language and an experiment in a different medium by a fine poet,  then you will be able to really enjoy reading it.
B000002KAT|5.0|This album has repeatedly turned up in the top ten of lists of the  greatest albums ever recorded, and deservedly so.  It can be listened to on  so many levels.  Sometimes I will listen to it while concentrating on the  lyrics.  Another time, I will focus on Van's phrasing.  Another time on  Richard Davis's inconceivably great bass playing (this is arguably the  greatest performance on bass on any album ever recorded for a rock  audience, even if the bass player was a jazz musician).  This is an album  that simply reeks of genius.  Simply put:  a masterpiece.
B000005H4F|5.0|cannonball gained a lot of prominenece with miles and here miles returns  the favours. just listen to him taking off on *autumn leaves*, ..the first  few minutes is more than money's worth for this fabulous CD. hank jones is  a bit sidelined but makes up for it on *one for daddy-o* and the title  track. blakey's spurt on *allison's uncle* is a good little lesson on post  be-bop drumming. This album is, by all means, a *****, if not more!! BUY IT  NOW!!
B00000AFDW|4.0|Great overall effort, however, this CD would have gotten 5 stars had some  of the songs not seemed so individualized and less like the KISS many of us  grew up with.  At times it almost seems like Ace and Peter were just  brought in to sell more records (say this can't be so).  The majority of  these songs are very listenable, however, there are a few exceptions.  Paul  wrote a song for Peter &quot;I finally found my way&quot; which I am sorry  to say is a weak followup to 'Beth', however, it does have some emotional  overtones which were unexpected. Ace recorded better songs than 'Into the  Void' on his solo albums. &quot;You wanted the best&quot; is about as hokey  as it gets.  However,with these few exceptions, Psycho Circus is a great CD  which I am sure that this will develop into yet another incredible tour. (I  took my country music loving wife of 10 years to a show on their last tour  and she walked away a KISS fan.  OVERALL THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ALL KISS  FANS!!!
0312965788|5.0|This is the first of a series of sort-of-autobiographical books written by  &quot;James Herriot,&quot; a real-life country veterinarian in Yorkshire,  England.  The first book covers his arrival in &quot;Darrowby&quot; in  1937, when new research and new technology were just beginning to change  both farming and veterinary medicine.  We meet James' boss, Siegfried  Farnon, and Siegfried's fun but irresponsible brother Tristan, as well as a  wide variety of local farmers and pet owners.  As good as the BBC series  is, the books are so much more.  I think readers of any age (these books  are perfectly suitable for older grade school age children) who like  animals will enjoy the stories here, as will anyone with an interest in  English country life, or stories of days gone by.
0151003084|5.0|I was first introduced to the glory that is Gorey through the courtesy of  my local PBS station, which, to fill time, would often show the Dark  Master's illustrations while someone read his &quot;storylines&quot; over  it.  Oh, I was SO hooked.  If you love Poe, Surrealism, Goya, death and  madness, endangered children, and sick humour in general, you will love  &quot;The Tinies&quot;, as well as any of Gorey's many and varied  masterpieces.  He's dark, disturbing, and hideously delicious!
B000000OAN|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the best albums ever made. Queen knew how to  do different kinds of music wisely, and this is the best example.  &quot;Bohemian Rapshody&quot;, the Freddie Mercury's opera magnus is the  great song of the album, but there's another brillant pieces like  &quot;Death on two legs&quot;, &quot;You're my best friend&quot;, 39',  &quot;Love of my life&quot;. Everybody like this work, and the quality,  vesatility, and the impressionant music make it the rock album of the  century. 23 years since it was released and still sounds modern!
B00000AFWW|4.0|If you're looking for &quot;Live Through This, Part 2&quot; you'll have to  keep waiting.  LTT was way more raw, unpolished, and loud.  &quot;Celebrity  Skin&quot; has considerable more production, and reflects the maturing of  the band.  The lyrics are still thought-provoking, and some of the music  could be described as Smashing Pumpkins meets the Go Go's - but not in a  bad way.  The only thing missing from this is more of the energy seen on  LTT, and even on the title track.  It could rock some more, but it is a  very listenable album, and I am not disappointed.  If I want the sound and  feel of &quot;Live Through This&quot; then I'll just play it.
0441003257|5.0|This book is wonderful.  Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down  (and I'm not easily hooked by books).  I've recommended it to all of my  friends and family, and they've all loved reading it, too.  The humor is  reminiscent of &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, but with an  imortality twist.
0880790121|5.0|This is my favorite Tarot deck so far. Although it relies on Kabbalah and  Rider-Waite, High Magick imagery, the art work is intuitively powerful and  compelling. Many of the images still take me by surprise with their power  and their complexity. A very pagan friendly deck, easy to work with. Close  enough to Rider-Waite not to require adjustments for most readers, but far  ahead in symbology, especially the re-working of the Minor Arcana, which is  unique in most cards.  Excellent for meditation and spell work as well.
0968236405|5.0|This book is much more than words. I actually experienced the energy  behind words as I read. It is quite an extrordinary book, and all the  people I know who have read it were profoundly moved. This is especially  interesting as the book promises neither fame nor fortune. It only points  the way to freedom, a state beyond the madness of the mind.
B0000026DJ|5.0|I had always admired Peter Garrett for walking away from the security of a  law firm to follow his heart. Until this record, I had found them very  good, but at the time, thought U2 was so much better.  This record changed  my mind.      This is the best album that I bought in the late 80's. It is  full of passion, anger, angst, and wonderfully crafted musical hooks. This  is what all people should strive to accomplish at least once in their  lives---- incorporate a deeply  rooted set of beliefs into a work of art.         Looking back at this album ten years later, it has lost none of it's  value. BUY THE DAMN THING ALREADY!!!!!
B000009PNY|1.0|I was hugely disappointed, with the effort brought forth by these artists.  Aside from the Cure, the songs were boring. There was no energy in any of  the lyrics or to the beat of the songs. How could they disgrace such a good  band with such a lousy tribute album.
B000001DYY|5.0|Tears for Fears is not your father's 80's band. They have developed into a  mature, adult band. No, no, I really mean it. They're not shadows of their  former glory, they are better than they have ever been - more  sophisticated, more passionate, more technically capable. I love Tears for  Fears. They are a fantastic band. I can't get enough of them, and that's  coming from a stern and ruthless music critic. Led by Roland Orzabal,  probably the finest popular musicians on the planet. Some of the critics  hate them. That's reason enough to give them a try. Since when were music  critics ever right?
B000000W6F|5.0|The smashing pumpkins were truly Billy Corgan on every instrument except  drums when this album was released.  Corgan's total control over the  playing of this album is evident to anyone who ever saw him perform live  before their Siamese Dream tour, or at least in the beginning of it.  I  think that the album is wonderful and is better than anything most bands  have accomplished.  Here is my song by song breakdown: I Am One- The song  that addicts you to this album, it rocks and you know that the band does  too. Siva-I love the rythmn guitar in this one...it kinda wants to rock  even more than it does the whole time and pulls the listener along with  it.(&quot;I just wanna get there faster.&quot;)  The exit from the soft  lyrics back into the guitar driven song is fantastic. Rhinoceros-I kinda  skipped over this one the first time I heard the album so many years ago.   Then this cool girl I know mentioned it to me and I listened and it quickly  went to the top of my list.  Don't know if it is the song or the girl. Bury  Me-Great song that gets by being scratchy cause of some creative adjustment  on the guitar by Billy.  His solo before he wails out &quot;She waits...to  bury me&quot; is really good.  Is worth the whole song right there.  Crush-I'm not sure what the band thought of this one, I love it.  If this  song ever gets associated with an event in your life it will forever define  that event.  It has a lot of emotion.  I feel his lyrics here are some of  the most sincere of the album. Suffer-Chill song that neither impresses nor  repels.  I am ambivalent on this one.  The end of the song seems promising  but never materializes. Snail-Another one that I skipped over on first  play...fortunately for me I quickly corrected that mistake and began  enjoying a wonderful song that almost sounds like Collective Soul wrote  it(sorry but it does) though since Billy and co perform it does really  well.  Only the excessive distortion hiss reminds you that this could never  be top40. Tristessa-I was never a big fan of this song.  But most fans seem  to like it and I don't want to turn anyone off from a song they may like.   I do like the guitar and vocal mix. Window Paine-This song is my personal  favorite on the album.  I like it cause it has a number of different parts  that all grow on you.  Jimmy really comes through with his drumwork on this  song and it gives you the pre-game jitters.   Daydream-There has to be a  bomb on every album I guess.     So, this album is in fact great.  I love  the personal feeling it has, pumpkins pre-arena sound. I'm sure that people  have left the CD running and heard Billy's last little bit...you gotta love  it. If you don't get this album you will go crazy.<br />WCH
B00000D9TQ|2.0|I suppose I can only give this album a 2 since (a.) many Phil Collins fans  probably already own most of the material on the album, dating back to  circa 1980s...Phil's heyday, and (b.) Phil probably just wants to  &quot;cash in&quot; on those past laurels, especially now that he and  &quot;Genesis&quot; pals Tony Banks and Mike Rutherford have apparently  parted ways!  His new directions -- playing drums with the &quot;Buddy Rich  Orchestra,&quot; and doing the sound-overs for a &quot;Tarzan&quot;  animation -- could either be a genuinely new &quot;talent trail&quot; for  Collins, OR a complete &quot;boondoggle&quot; for a performer whose best  days are now behind him!  Only time will tell, of course.  Either way, Phil  Collins' contributions to the Progressive Rock scene (via Genesis) and Pop  music in general are now the stuff of music history!  And we will all no  doubt miss the &quot;old&quot; Phil Collins sound...regardless of what his  &quot;new incarnation&quot; looks and sounds like!
B000002JS6|5.0|Back in Black is, and always will be, AC/DC's masterpiece. Even though it  was the first post-Bon release, there is still a lot of Bon in the album, I  think. Brian Johnson has taken a lot of crap just because he's &quot;not  Bon,&quot; that he frankly doesn't deserve. True, the man isn't Bon, but he  doesn't have to be. These have to be 10 of AC/DC's best songs: every one a  classic, absolutely NO filler, and each one has the subtlety of a kick to  the groin. Angus is still playing those four chords, but hell, he doesn't  have to learn anymore, cause he does just fine with the ones he knows!  There's nothing better than this album. This is the greatest single rock  album in HISTORY. And &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; is the best  single song ever written; it is THE AC/DC song.
0312857063|4.0|I have read many fantasy books, but it has been awhile since I have  purchased a book that I just couldn't wait to get back to.  <br />I originally  bought the book because of its size and the long flight I had waiting for  me.  I read through 1/2 of the book during that flight.  Over the course of  the next week, I went to that book whenever I had the chance.  I took the  book with me to places in hopes that I would have a chance to sneak in a  couple of pages.<br />I enjoyed the characters.  Being the second book in the  series and having never read the first, the characters were well developed  and well utilized.  The characters were pushed to the boundaries of the  scope of their world.  As they expanded, they did not give up their core,  but found ways to integrate their new world with their known world.  The  introduction of peripheral characters were well placed.  I enjoyed the fact  that once the peripheral characters had finished their place in the story,  they were not discarded, but brought back to flesh out the rest of the  novel.<br />Terry Goodkind filled the book with the right amount of harrowing  experiences, mystery, humor, and a smattering of foreshadowing that made  the book enjoyable and totally addicting.  This is one that I will happily  re-read for years to come.
B000002579|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums by any band, ever. Every song is a  masterpiece and they all work well together. &quot;Carry On, Wayward  Son&quot; is the most famous track, but not the best on this album.  &quot;Cheyenne Anthem&quot;, &quot;The Wall&quot;, and &quot;Miracles Out  of Nowhere&quot; are equally as good. The playing and vocals are amazing.  This is a must have album.
0060976624|5.0|Excellent, Excellent. I usually have to go British to find a funny book.  Not to be reactionary but the irony of a reader from DC knocking this book  for lack of insight or redemptive moral quality spurred me on. Thank  You...is great because it doesn't bother droning. Just good biting humor,  and from a true blue American. Why can't more American writers lighten up  and shoot off a spoof like this more often.
B000002U82|5.0|Every song on this album is fantastic. If you like Pink Floyd your gonna  adore this album.  I personally like the song &quot;Time&quot; the most but  I also like brain damage.  You won't be disapointed with this album, and  with that price I don't think you should pass it up.
B000006ED1|4.0|This is the type of stuff Savatage, Dream Theater and Fates Warning fans  go absolutely ga-ga over. This rock opera based upon J.R.R. Tolkiens's  &quot;The Silmariallion&quot; is simply an awesome recording. The music is  atmospheric and very gothic (in the good sense)-sounding, the lyrics are  well-written, the lead vocals recall Blackie Lawless, the guitar solos  recall Yngwie Malmsteen gone berserk, the backup vocals recall  Queen...<br />My only complaint about this album is that there are many  dialogue tracks, where certain scenes that take place in Tolkien's story  are recited. Not a big deal, but it geds kind of annoying when you put the  CD on shuffle and are foced to bear through a 30-second  &quot;Aaarrrggh.&quot; Aside from that, the fact that I can't read the  synopsis (it's in German) gets a bit annoying. But we're talking about the  actual music on the disc. The songs themselves are bleedin' awesome.  Personal favourites include &quot;Nightfall,&quot; &quot;Dead Winter  Reigns,&quot; and &quot;Into the Storm.&quot;<br />The Japanese version dof  this disc includes four stickers of the Blind Guardian logo (In red, gold,  blue and green) and Karaoke mixes of &quot;Nightfall&quot; and some other  song. Also included is an insert where the recitiations are printed in both  English and Japanese. It also comes in one helluva thick case. The German  version is in a regular jewel case, with only one insert and no bonus  tracks.<br />This band will appeal to fans of progressive and gothic metal.
0553269631|4.0|Carson McCullers showed unusual maturity when she wrote The Heart Is A  Lonely Hunter at age 23.  McCullers drives home the deep necessity within  all human beings to be understood by another human being.  She illustrates  poignantly, the lengths people go to, within their own minds, to find this  deep understanding from another.<br />McCullers deals extensively with  passion, suggesting we live in a society that systematically wrings  peoples' passions out of their lives.<br />Unfortunately, the excellent  thematic depth is couched inside a writing sytle that regularly becomes  tedious.  The book has much discussable material for a book group and would  be appropriate for a group willing to patiently wade through the repetitive  nature of the book.
B00000255F|5.0|bORN TO RUN IS ONE OF THE FINEST ALBUMS EVER MADE. i AM NOT A BIG  SPRINGSTEEN FAN, BUT THIS RECORD HOLDS UP NOW MANY YEARS AFTER IT WAS  PRODUCED.
B0000024K1|5.0|The power and anger I feel when I listen to this reminds me of the power  and anger I felt when I first heard the Sex Pistols.  If your idea of rap  is that Puff Daddy idiot, then do yourself a huge favor and buy this CD.   You'll understand that rap wasn't always about acquiring material  posessions.
0393314804|5.0|If there were six stars, i'd give it ten!  This book is bitingly honest  and unremitting.  Read this book.  The best book by anyone!!!!!!!
0898159156|5.0|This book should be on the &quot;must have&quot; list of any serious, or  even semi-serious collector.  Peter takes a look at the many genera of  carnivorous plants in sometimes-humorous, but always detailed descriptions  of the plants and how to grow them.  His experience in the field of  carnivorous gardening shows through in every page.  The descriptions are  wonderful, the photographs are magnificent and the growing tips should help  even the worst black-thumbed gardener get a start growing these fascinating  plants.
B000005JH5|5.0|This is the album to have if you love Kate Bush. This was a new sound that  no one else could have come up with.  Kate Bush expressed herself in such a  unique way that it caught everyone's attention.  I think that more songs  from this album should have been a big success like &quot;wuthering  heights&quot;.
0517122707|5.0|I loved it!!!!!! To put it bluntly, this has to be one of my favorite  books. All of the characters were beautifully described, and with each  scene, the reader felt that they were there. I wish that the author could  realize how much joy he brought into our lives by writing it.
B000005JHF|3.0|I think this album was still good and all, but it just didn't move me in  the same way that the &quot;Kick inside&quot; did. Still songs like  &quot;Wow&quot;, &quot;Hammer Horror&quot;, &quot;In search of peter  pan&quot;, and &quot;Don't push your foot on the heartbrake&quot; were very  good.
0060977493|5.0|A must read for the power, beauty and the horror of the human condition.   The beginning events can only culminate one way.  To have read the last  chapter without reading all that comes before would have been a BIG  mistake.
B000002H33|5.0|Master of Puppets is by far the best Metallica album to date.  I know this  review comes some years after its release, but I thought it still  noteworthy.<br />The song, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; was/is Metallica's  most profound contribution to modern Rock.  This is the most cohesive piece  of music that they have ever done.  The way the music is orchestated to the  mood of the lyrics is awesome.  It totally changes from the Master  dictating the tone of the music to the slave crying out in anguish,  wondering where the promises are that he gave his soul up for.<br />I recently  saw them in concert in Las Vegas (August 18th, 1998) and I must say, as a  Metallica fan from way back, that they have never sounded so good.  They  opened the show with &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; and closed it over 2 1/2  hours later with &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;.  They are still the number 1  metal band of all time!!<br />Rock on!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|As a huge Phil Phan I have been waiting and waiting for a hits collection  that isn't live (not that he isn't great live, but sometimes you just don't  want to have that cheering in the background) - still have yet to find a  studio recording of &quot;Easy Lover&quot; and so I can't wait to get this  one. Looks like a good mix of his best.
B000002UEB|5.0|Quite simply I believe this to be the best album I have ever listened  too......DeGarmo &amp; Wilton's fret board work is top notch....Tate's  vocals are, as usual, brilliant.....Rockenfield &amp; Jackson round off the  sound forcefully....If you haven't got this album you really are missing  out on a masterpiece!!!
0395759242|2.0|This could have been a very good book -- an historical exploration of a  little-known era and series of events in Africa.  The author certainly did  enough research to craft such a tale, and in spots the narrative is quite  interesting.  However, the author simply cannot stop trying to wedge this  story into a politically correct fable without any real justification for  doing so and keeps dragging in irrelevant things he admires -- Amnesty  International, pacificists in WWI, etc.  Well, it doesn't work and all this  does is gradually undercut the author's credibility and make the reader  suspicious of the other parts...Too bad, it could have been much better.
0670880728|4.0|i am from Venezuela,35,married,with children,thin,non-smoker,social  drinker and I don't have to work,so you may say that i'm more a Magda than  a Bridget,but I still felt deep in my heart very much like a Bridget.Her  sense of humor,her insecurities,her ups and downs makes her the perfect  anti-hero wich I sometimes feel myself to be(And I think i'm not alone).My  only problem with the book is a cultural one:Who are Douglas Hurd,Michael  Howard and Jim Davidson? What kind of party is a Tart and Vicar? There are  many elements of british pop culture that are lost to non-british  citizens.Maybe because it wasn't meant to be read by a venezuelan who can  hardly write in english,but still loved the book.
B000002N2P|4.0|I really like this CD because it has alot of good guitars and vocals.  The  vocals may be a little hard to hear over the guitars, but I like it anyway.  I know I'll be listening to it over and over again. It has a lot of variety  in the music and it is the classic 'I'm going to explode, sanity tolling  relationship, I'm hopeless' Green Day lyrics. It is not as good as Dookie,  but it's a close second. It has a really hard sound, harder then Nimrod or  Dookie even.  I like the songs &quot;Brain Stew&quot; and &quot;Geek Stink  Breath&quot;, but my favorite song is &quot;Panic Song.&quot; A must have  for any Green Day fan, or if you just like hard rock music.
B000002MUW|5.0|This album is very personal. With songs like &quot;Love tried to welcome  me in&quot;(My personal favorite), and &quot;Survival&quot;-Madonna bears  her soul. On &quot;Human Nature&quot;, Madonna gives her critics a chance  to look at themselves-all the while backed by a hot track.... This is an  album that you can listen to at anytime-Madonna fan or not.....It's a must  buy!!!!!!!!
B000003NA4|5.0|I must admit I had never purchased a jazz album in my life until I saw  Diana Krall on the Juno Awards (Canada's version of the Grammy's).  Her  version of &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot; blew me away.  I purchased her CD  and I was not disappointed.  Never did I realize jazz could be this good!   What a way to spend a romantic evening.  Proud to have another Canadian  singer shine in the world!
B000002NHN|5.0|The  vocals are enchanting and mesmerizing... at times erotic.  I  recommend this CD as a must have.
B000005IKX|4.0|This collection hints at what ABBA would have become had they survived as  a group.  The title track is a darker and harder edged ABBA sound.  It is  the sound of ABBA grown up.  Like An Angel Passing Through My Room repeats  the title track's haunting melancholy.  When All is Said and Done is a  classy toast and farewell from the group.  Listen to this one with the  headphones on in the dark.
B000002MT0|4.0|An album that does justice to Prince's superb musical talent, but one that  leaves you longing for more.  A solid attempt by an artist searching for  his musical place in history, Come represents in a sense both the ability  and the shortcomings of Prince's style.  At any rate, a definite buy for  anyone searching for that mix of funk, R&amp;B, and soul that touches in a  way only Prince can.
0380778556|5.0|I really really liked Rebecca.  I can't agree that the first half of the  book was slow, because I have a really short attention span and if the  first half of the book had been slow I would never have gotten to the  second half of the book.  I found it fascinating and involving from the  beginning.  And as I said before, it is creepy (almost gives the feeling of  a really subtle ghost story-in a way I guess it is), tense, (because you  really worry about the fate of poor Mrs. de Winter and Maxim) and  frustrating (because Mrs. Danvers is so detestable and the narrator is such  a wimp and lets Mrs. Danvers get the better of her over and over.)  But  it's readable and entertaining as well.  I really reccomend it.  Go for it.
B000002WYT|5.0|I absolutely love Dave Matthews Band, and this is definitely my favorite  album.  My favorites are &quot;Lie in Our Graves,&quot; &quot;Two  Step,&quot; and the always incredible &quot;Say Goodbye.&quot;
B000002PB2|4.0|In my opinion, the songwriting isn't as strong on Dawn Patrol as on later  albums.  The singing has improved somewhat too, especially on Neverland.   But, I don't think the playing has improved much in the intervening years;  I don't think there was much room for improvement!  They sound great!  I  give them 100% on execution.  It's the guitarwork that really makes this  album.  Well, the guitar work as well as the complete musical arrangements.
B000003FPN|5.0|To quote the back of the CD, Dvorak's New World symphony is &quot;one of  the most unreservedly beloved compositions ever created.&quot;  From the  brooding introduction to the powerful finale, the piece resonates with  emotion and beauty.
0792835980|4.0|Light, breezy and refreshing!!  Thats how I would describe this DVD  re-issue.  Cary Grant and Jimmie Stewart are excellent.  The supporting  cast is top-notch, and the dialogue affective.  Oh..yes..Katharine Hepburn  holds her own.  The DVD image is uncannily perfect.     END
B000002OX3|5.0|If you like British Invasion, Hard Rock, Metal, R&amp;B, Reggae, Polka,  Disco...I don't care.  You will love the Who!  Harder than the Beatles,  funnier than the Stones, the Who are an amazing band.   This may not be the  place to start but it is a great CD.  1966.  Moon never drummed better,  Pete never wrote or played better and the band was never this funny again  besides the next release The Who Sell Out, which is the best disc of the  decade. Includes, Happy Jack, Boris the Spider, Moon's crazy Cobwebs &amp;  Strange and so many great songs you never get tired of it.  If I could I'd  give it much more than 5 stars.
B00000AFWW|5.0|This is the best album I have bought recently.  Though for fans of the  Hole of yore, it might be a little too catchy.  It is more pop than punk  but immenently listenable for fans of both genres.
1572700173|5.0|This was the first Agatha Christie book I ever read!  I have read most of  her books, but this remains my favorite one of all time!  Excellent!  You  must read it!
B000002NJS|4.0|This is by far one of the best pieces of works Madonna has ever completed.   It really is a &quot;Piece of Work&quot;, the whole album fits together  perfectly (with the exception of the annoying &quot;Candy Perfume  Girl&quot;, which downgraded my rating from 5 stars to 4).   &quot;Frozen&quot; and &quot;Drowned World&quot; are absolutly fabulous and  stand out as the best songs on the album.
B00000BKI4|5.0|Album of the year?  Probably not, but its the best album I've purchased  this year and their strongest since their first.  I've been listening to  Mercury Rev since Yerself Is Steam and this album doesn't stray away from  the formula that made Mercury Rev the most original band in the past 10  years.
B00000634L|5.0|Its hard to say exactly what kind of music B.V.3G puts out... hip-hop is  the closest genre...but throw in some country guitar, the occasional hard  rock lick, some beautiful harmonies, a touch of reggae, and the  classification gets a little... muddy.  Somehow, it works, though.  There  is not a &quot;fast forward&quot; song on the album.  It grooves where its  supposed to groove and lays you back when the slow jams hit.  All in all,  in a short period of time, this has become one of my favorite albums.  I  can't wait for their next release!
B000002BE9|5.0|Unbelievable artist.  She is the most powerful voice out there.  I hope to hear more very soon.  This is one CD that may become \\"white\\"<br />with wear!
B000001F6N|5.0|classic british blues with the great Peter Green.  A great album.
B000000OPQ|4.0|Though such groups as Foreigner,and Journey are on the CD, it is only  Madonna's song Crazy for You, that truly makes this CD. While Crazy for you  brings to mind a very romantic and loving passoniate scene, the other songs  range the gambit and rearly if at all come across as songs that actually  know where they want to head. The only true reason this CD hs earned 4  stars is due to Madonnas Crazy for You song.
0684874350|5.0|Born in poverty in New York and raised in poverty in Ireland, McCourt  learned the lessons of 2 countries.  His account of his childhood and  desire to return to America, coupled with the deaths of his siblings made  for interesting reading and left me wanted to read a sequel to his book,  telling us how he came from absolute poverty and became a pulitizer winning  writer.
B000002L9S|5.0|Madonna who has had so many hits throught her musical career has one of  her best hits contained on this CD. True Blue, Madonna has had other great  hits but few have had the impact True Blue has had on people who have heard  it on dates and then again after. Possibly only Crazy For You has had more  impact on people in the romantic sense.
B000000WZ4|5.0|I had never heard of Depeche Mode before &quot;It's No Good&quot; was  released. At first, i felt that David Gahan was a Bono look-alike, and his  voice just sounded like every other brit-pop star. After awhile I decided  to listen to the whole album. I fell in love with the dark yet danceable  sound of &quot;Barrel of a gun&quot; and the gothic sounds of &quot;The  Love Thieves&quot; and &quot;Sister of Night.&quot; &quot;Freestate&quot;  is an exceptional track, but the whole album could really kick Robert  Smith's ass (though I am a big-time Cure fan too). Put simply, this is  Depeche Mode at their best.
B000002C4J|5.0|The song To Love You More, is excellently produced with relaxing music and  vilions in the background. The song itself is one of Dions best. Along with  all the other great songs on this CD, To Love You More and this CD will go  far.
B000002LK1|5.0|Depeche Mode kicked ass with &quot;Ultra&quot; so of course, their earlier  stuff started to fascinate me. &quot;A Policy of Truth,&quot; and  &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; are great, as is the rest of the album. Gothic  dance electronica is hard to find in good quality, and it's mainly because  Depeche Mode has done so excellent a job of it that nobody else can be  quite as good.
B000001Y42|5.0|Limp Bizkit is a refreshing new sound that mixes hard core rock with hard  core rap.  With this combination, Limp Bizkit creates an amazing sound that  has been ignored for too long in today's music industry.   If the  occasional flow of profanity doesn't bother you, then this album is well  worth the money.  After all, compared to Limp Bizkit, everything else is  &quot;about as real as a three dollar bill!&quot;
B00000D9TQ|5.0|After the not-as-great-as-we-were-used-to-be Dance into the lights, this  really is something breathtaking. This cd revives the Phil Collins that we  all new and all loved so much. In a time where almost every singer just  cares about the sound of his songs and forgets the importance of  meaningfull words to go with the song, this album is a 'fading light' in  the world of pop music. It anyway keeps me hoping...
0783225733|5.0|Ron Howard has done it again in bringing a fabulous pictoral to the big  screen.  Tom Hanks is superb as Jim Lovell.  The environment in which the  story takes place is perfect.  The reality of zero-G dispenses your  disbelief of this being a movie rather than documentary from 1970. One gets  a sense of really being there with the guys in the Command Module.  Talk  about heros! <br />A must-have for any DVD collection!     END
1878424114|5.0|Even a was-spiritual skeptic like myself can truly say that this book has  changed my life. It is now my Bible. Dr. Deepak Chopra gives an  easy-to-read spiritual guidance on how to live life in harmony with nature.  Dr. Chopra lists the seven spiritual guides to attain happiness and success  which is derived from the laws of nature. Although this is a spiritual  book, it is written objectively (the author used to practice medicine) for  the spiritually curious and the western mind that tends to view the world  as a materialistic, solid world. This book will help you realize why human  beings are stuck in the cycle of suffering, resentment, failure, etc. and  how we can follow the guidelines of nature to end them. We are born from  nature so it would only make sense to go back to its principle, don't you  think?  I highly recommend this book. You will refer to it over and over  again.
B000002BFZ|5.0|This cd totally missed the attention it deserves.  I heard &quot;Who You  Are&quot; like once 3 years ago and that was it.  It's a good change from  what they've done before.  If you listen, there are similarities between it  and Yield.  Anyway, this cd has tons of good songs on it. Hail Hail and  Habit are awesome songs to rock to (Habit reminds me of Tool), Who You Are  is cool cause I like Indian rhythms, I love In My Tree (one of my all time  favs) with all the polyrhythms.  Red Mosquito's a really cool one, really  Hendrix-y.  Present Tense is an all time favorite, too.  I am just so  impressed with the lyrics.  Anyways, to say the least, this cd should have  gotten way more attention than it did.
0385484518|5.0|This is an amazing and very powerful book that really makes you take a  look at your life and the things that matter most to you. It is very well  written and you'll find yourself caught up in the story before you know it.  I think everyone should read this book!!!
0345347951|5.0|This book is one of Clarke's finest.  Agripping page turner with suprises  at every corner.  If you liked this book, you should check out Earth: Final  Conflict.
B00000AFDW|4.0|This album totally kicks, man!!   I really like &quot;Into The Void&quot;,  &quot;Raise Your Glasses&quot;, and &quot;I Pledge Allegiance&quot;---my  only complaint is that the album just isn't long enough; more contributions  from Ace &amp; Peter would've solved that problem for me, but I guess  that's up to the producer...but as I said, it's the real KISS and it's great!!  :)
0446604844|5.0|This book is an excellent written book. Baldacci grips you by the collar  and doesn't let you go until the end. I was so intrigued with the  technological aspect of the story. He has just  the right amount of  characters so the reader will not get confused.  If you are in the mood for  a fast paced, wonderfully written book then this is the one for you.
B000002AZ8|5.0|I just bought this cd because I loved Ten and vs. so much.  I have to  admit, I was a little disappointed.  But, the songs that are good, they get  REALLY good.  The stupid songs or songs that aren't even songs that were  put on there should have been taken off like hey foxymophandlemama, that's  me, bugs, and pry, to, those shouldn't have even been put in there and  replaced with more good songs like corduruoy or nothingman or better man or  immortality (the 4 best songs on there).  Not For You's pretty cool, kind  of interesting.  Tremor Christ is really cool.  I used to think it was  sacreligious but found that it was actually pretty unsacreligious.  So all  in all, I give the album 5 stars because of those 6 songs.  But, I still  have to say, not their best.
0385421982|1.0|If there was a catgory for 0 stars, I would have selected that.  It's  depressing to realize that truly great modern literature is not being read  by people today.  Instead they read this boring trash and think they are  reading a book by a great author.  As a high school teacher, I am disturbed  that great books are not being published any longer and that movies are  actually being made using the garbage that is being published.  I couldn't  finish this book.  About 2/3's of the way through when I had figured out  the end, I asked my husband (who had read the entire book), if there wasn't  really a surprise ending.  He said &quot;no&quot;, and that I had figured  it out.  All I could think of was what was all the hoopla about.  I didn't  waste anymore time reading &quot;Pelican Brief&quot; and I guarantee you, I  will never read another of his books.  It's definately 8th grade mentality.
B000000WCX|5.0|What can I say?  This is a great CD, but then it is David Bowie, he rarely  does anything that isn't fantastic.
0399143904|4.0|Currently the United States and other major nations of the world are at  peace, so Tom Clancy has to look to new sources for conflict.  No, he  didn't go to outer space a la Starship Troopers.  Rather he weaves  international terrorism and a rich bioengineering corporation together in a  plot to make the world safe from man by basically getting rid of most  humankind.  Standing in the breach is a multinational anti-terrorism  strikeforce led by John Clark and Ding Chavez.  Mix together Michael  Crichton's Andromeda Strain, Stephen King's The Stand, Ernest Callenbach's  Ecotopia, and Clancy's own Patriot Games and Without Remorse, and you have  the beginnings of this book.  I found it to be a real pageturner, and I  kept stealing free moments to read it to completion.
B00000AFFI|5.0|It has been three years since Polly released a solo album. For those  die-hard fans much was expected of this work, and I for one was not  disapointed with what I feel may be her second best album (Rid Of Me cannot  be measured on a five-star scale). Her lyrics are as profound as ever and  her voice has more power than it ever has had. Although this album lacks  the force-10 hurricane potency of Rid Of Me, her songs have more energy,  true emotion and purity than any other artist in music today. Polly is  truly a force of Nature.
076781326X|3.0|I remembered this movie fondly from when I was a kid.  Looking at it now,  I'm awfully glad I enjoyed it then.  Now it seems awfully forced.  I dare  any adult to get through the numerous production numbers without chuckling.   But for kids (I suspect very young kids) this may be a completely  different experience.  With songs like &quot;Consider Yourself&quot; and  &quot;Food, Glorious Food&quot; it's hard to deny a certain hum-ability.   And there's the classic victim diva anthem &quot;As Long As He Needs  Me&quot;.  The presentation is first rate, with a widescreen (only)  transfer and a good &quot;making of&quot; documentary.     END
B0000025SB|5.0|This is deep. The right place to go after The Wall. One of the best Pink  Floyd pieces and a must-have for any fan.
0792833686|5.0|If you love musicals of any sort, buy this DVD!  The 50's colors come  alive in the DVD transfer.  You'll find it hard to believe a  &quot;classic&quot; movie can look this good on your TV.  And the movie  itself is so much fun; so much more than the justifiably famous  &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot; Gene Kelly number.  A great movie for kids  and anyone who wants to have a good time.     END
031286504X|5.0|After seeing &quot;The Omega Man&quot; on AMC I decided to buy the book.  It was a thousand times better.  The novel is an important work showing  what it is like to all of a sudden become the outcast in society. The main  character goes from being a average man to being a legendary evil in a new  world. Guarenteed to make you think.
B000002H2Z|5.0|this was the first cure albumn i bought.  now i own several and plan on  owning them all.  Smith is a brilliant song writer and a lovely singer.   although the cure's other stuff is dark and gothic, this albumn is rather  happy.  It's a glorius albumn, well worth your time if you even like the  cure slightly...
B000002W9Q|4.0|I think this is a great CD. I loved the movie, too. It has great songs,  especially I've Had the Time of My Life, Hungry Eyes, Stay, Hey Baby, and  Love is Strange.  I don't like Yes or You Don't Own Me.  All in all, I  think this is a very good CD, probably my favorite in all of my four CD  collection!  (That's a joke, in case you couldn't tell.)
0553473476|5.0|If you read the DIARY OF A YOUNG GIRL, as I did, you may not be prepared  for how moving this audio presentation is.  Winona Ryder brings Anne to  life in all her bravery and contradictions.  Hearing a young girl's voice  discuss the aches of growing up makes Anne seem even more like &quot;every  girl&quot; (albeit an enormously gifted &quot;every girl&quot;) and this  makes the fate of all those poor Jewish girls more poignant, more tragic.  What we lost!
B000000WA4|5.0|Billy and Co. have certainly crafted a masterpiece with this album.  They  took an idea, teenage angst, loss, and pain, and successfully moved it to  vinyl like no band since Pink Floyd.  The thing I love about the Pumpkins  is that they are one of these bands that in thirty years our kids are going  to be impressed that we were around to see. I am a big fan of the  &quot;album&quot; idea...so far as I like records that flow and are a part  of a grander scheme.  I have heard compliments to this record that it could  be mistaken for a greatest hits album, I'm not sure if I agree but if I did  that would be its only negative in my mind.  The tendency of this album to  wander occasionally.  The band hits its mark with &quot;Mellion  Collie&quot; and then into &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;.  One of the best  songs ever.  &quot;JellyBelly&quot; is a decent song that would be a  wonderful song by any other band.  One of the songs that too blatantly  pushes Billy's &quot;i'm a teenager, feel for me&quot; theme.  But I love  the final vocals and the guitars driving the song. I never really got into  &quot;Zero&quot;, it was a shame he always wore that silly shirt, c'mon  lets not kid ourselves.  But the song does speak for the album and it is a  good one to groove along with.  &quot;Here is No Why&quot; is a song that I  really enjoy.  The deadening of the riffs is something I don't always get  into but I like it here.  Another song that has a nice build-up of musical  emotion as Billy begins to crank up the vocals into the refrain.  Ten bucks  for anyone who tells me what a sad machine is.  BWBW is a good single that  has the perfunctary rage included.  Honestly, when I first heard this song  on the radio I thought that this album was going to be a bomb. &quot;To  Forgive&quot; is one of the few slow songs on the album but like the others  it is lovely.  The part where Billy talks about what he has forgotten is  incredible. Minimal guitars here and it works fine.  &quot;AnOde to No  One&quot; is an annoying song until you get over the initial reaction of  the song and look for the humor and truth in the lyrics of the song.   &quot;Love&quot; probably turned off a lot of listeners...but I find it a  interesting song and is a precursor for the later house sound that this  band would delve into.  &quot;Cupid de Locke&quot; is a song that must be  tolerated until it grows on you enough to listen all the way through...then  you are rewarded with Billy's words and the angelic host singing in the  background.  &quot;Galapogos&quot; was my favorite song on this album for  awhile and still showcases its beauty with the final emotional statements  that Billy poses at the end of the song.  A song that gives hope for the  future yet reminds you jkust how awesome a band we have here right now.   Often my biggest problem with Pumpkins tunes is that my favorite ones never  make it to the radio(really not a problem when you think about it because  it remains a personal song); however, this one made it primetime and I  couldn't have been more excited.  This is definitely a Billy song powered  by the lyrics and the distant strumming of a guitar.  Pretty much any  review of this album includes some boasting about &quot;Porcelina&quot; and  I am no different.  What a fantastic song that has all the spic dimensions  of past wonders like &quot;Silverfuck&quot;.  James Iha gets a chance to  sing lead on &quot;Take Me Down&quot; and at worst pulls it off much better  than D'Arcy in &quot;Daydream&quot; from Gish...and at best creates a  quasi-listenable song.  &quot;Where Boys Fear to Tread&quot; is basically a  primal attack on the senses that can be appealing depending what mood you  are in.  Quirky sound effects are present in this one like the atomic  dropping sound and the whiplash.  &quot;Bodies&quot; at first listen has a  pretty aggressive sound that may cause some to pass over but it is a  darling song that will have you singing along in no time. &quot;But  nobodies....&quot;  &quot;33&quot; is one of my favorites and has a lullaby  sound that made me first think I was listening to &quot;In the Arms of  Sleep&quot;.  This song evokes any and every important childhood memory for  me that relates to home, comfort and belonging.  A really well done song  with good maracas use.  &quot;Arms&quot; has this wonderful intro where you  can makes out each note as the first guitar chord is slowly plucked. This  is less comforting than the last and leaves the door open to that terrible  theme of never finding anyone.  &quot;1979&quot; is one of those popular  songs that you don't mind liking cause it is so good and makes you feel  like dancing or go driving.  The drum machine(to be honest I don't know  where Jimmy left off and Billy's use of computers took over) is really  cool.  &quot;Tales&quot; is way too intense for me and I never really got  into the vocal distortion...however, the guitars in this song kick some  booty.  &quot;Thru the eyes of Ruby&quot; is also on my favorites list and  is one of those songs I wished to here on the radio once and show off all  the skills of my favorite band to my friends.  This song has it all:  wailing guitars of the arena rock past, sad simple Billy lyrics, a song  that slowly progresses towards crescendo, and funky interludes.  I'm not  sure how most feel about &quot;Stumbleine&quot; but I think it is a nice  song.  The lyrics are interesting and keep ypu guessing about what he is  talking about.  The song has a very personal feeling with each guitar chord  being felt by the listener along with every word.  &quot;X.Y.U.&quot; is  another one of those songs that attacks and I often fight back by changing  songs.  Interesting parts to this song, some working as individual parts,  but as a song it doesn't work as a collage of these things.  When I first  bought this album I put the CD onto a 100 minute tape to listen to in the  car.  I missed these final five songs from the tape.&quot;We Only Come  Out at Night&quot; is a song I can see people not liking...however, I feel  this song could compete on the White Album of Beatles fame and has a strong  place in the Pumpkins library.  This song is very different for them and i  feel successful.  &quot;Beautiful&quot; starts out quirky but has a nah nah  kinda refrain which is very good.  Tends to fall apart at the end though.   &quot;Lily&quot; is also a song that I would credit the Beatles as  influence. Interesting song that combines an odd vocal track with a weird  drum line.  &quot;By Starlight&quot; is a great song that I wished the band  had ended the album with...has all the longing that should end any great  album.  Again, a simple drum beat that is vocally driven and has a guitar  to complement Billy's singing.  &quot;farewell and goodnight&quot; is  somewhat of a bland song and is a disappointing final song.  Too bad for  such a wonderful album that I think will be a must in any collector's  library as that person tries to gain a fixture on the music that defined  the 90's and hopefully beyond.
B000003NA4|5.0|Another excellent album from Diana Krall.  This makes an ideal companion  piece to her other trio compilation &quot;All For You&quot;.  Diana Krall  continues to dazzle and hypnotize the listener with her fluid, sensual  voice and sparkling piano playing.  She is ably accompanied by Russell  Malone on guitar and Christian McBride on bass.  &quot;Love Scenes&quot; is  a seductive pleasure form start to finish ... Highly recommended!!
B00000DC7L|4.0|It's been six long years since Brian May released a full-length solo  project and Another World almost makes it worth the wait. This disc is  pretty much a continuation of Back to the Light with explosive guitars, the  late Cozy Powell's monster drumming and (of course) multi-tracking to your  heart's content.  Stand-outs on the record include the live cover of Ian  Hunter's &quot;All The Way From Memphis&quot; and the poignient title cut.  Guitar legend Jeff Beck guests on the cut &quot;The Guv'nor,&quot; and May  crashes and burns on &quot;China Belle.&quot; Here's hoping the  loose-string king doesn't take another half-decade to release something  new, but in the meantime, Hey Brian, how about a tour of the States?
B0000039QA|5.0|I was not even familiar with Notorious until fairly recently when a friend  was playing his music.  I always had it in my mind that it was &quot;hard  core&quot; and hard to listen to.  His sound and beats are so intoxicating  that you  don't even realize you are hearing some of the the hardest lyrics  around...damn, I'm hooked. I ordered &quot;Ready to Die&quot; today.  The  world has lost a musical genius....
B00000AFWW|5.0|After reading over 40 of the amazon reviews, it became apparent that the  geographic influences on the album, obviously California and Seattle, are  also the epicenter of the album's fan-base.   NYC seems to shun the effort  as trite recycled 80s pop re-packaged (slightly).  As a long-time Hole fan,  i can tell you, i personally love the album but miss the desperation and  crude imagery of POTI and LTT.  on Dying, when courtney whispers something  dark and ugly about a cripple dance (?) i get a yearning for more of that  strange, dark poetry found in older songs like &quot;old age&quot; &amp;  &quot;best sunday dress&quot;. still, courtney's eerie clarity shines  through on Celeb Skin.  new york, lighten up, it's not meant to be a  revolution.  maybe y'all need more sunshine, go fly away, to Malibu.  it's  where you drown your scars.
0684874350|5.0|Frank McCourts' writing style makes it possible to laugh through some of  the most depressing and deplorable living conditions I have ever read  about.  His style also allows you to experience - as he grows from  childhood to a young adult - his increasing awareness of his family's place  in society.  As you read about all that he and his family endured - so  matter of factly - you wonder how McCourt managed to not only survive but  succeed as he has.  I did not want the book to end and recommend it highly  to everyone!
B00000D9TK|5.0|Each song has its very own character, with the taste of France. Though I  don't understand a word, but still like this album just as much as I do for  Let's Talk About Love. Celine Dion has done it again, and will forever do  that, and toutch the lives of people around the world. Thank you Rene and  Celine......
0786862408|4.0|This was my first Pearson book and it earned him another read in the  future.<br />The characters are unique and developed so that the reader  genuinely cares about them, even when their interests conflict.<br />The one  part that really bothered me is why Lou's wife, who actually conversed with  the not-yet-identified killer, couldn't provide any useful information that  would have solved the crime much sooner.
B000002ADT|5.0|Great for learning music.  It has artists that are so different and  dynamic playing together.  One of the best jazz albums that exist.   Everyone that has any interest in jazz needs to own this
0399143904|1.0|It's too bad that Clancy has become so powerful that he could tell his  publisher's editor to f*** off. If there was one thing this overlong book  needed was good editing and about five more re-writes. The result is a  boring, predictable, cartoonish tech manual. It was as if he wrote his  first draft as a story outline and went with it. Character development?  Forget it. There are no interesting characters in the book except maybe the  ex-KGB agent, who's too dull to figure out the obvious until just in the  nick of time. And, by the way, the &quot;nick of time&quot; ending is  obvious and unexciting. The heroes are mere vectors of action and have no  interest to the reader as human beings. I feel used by Mr. Clancy who must  have figured his reputation would sell a lot of books without really  working too hard. I doubt I will buy any more of his books if this is where  he is headed in his career.
0812931017|5.0|Branson uses his editorial skills and has come up with an autobiography  which is not dry and boring, but like his business, snappy and fun. Well  done Richard and remember &quot;no way BA/AA&quot;
0783819129|3.0|The format was vintage Archer--two &quot;heroes&quot; from completely  different backgrounds climb to the top of their field and become  archrivals.  Sound familiar?  While the alternating storyline style is  entertaining, perhaps it is becoming a little stale.<br />As usual, Archer  develops the main characters exceptionally well and introduces a number of  stunning women (how is it that his characters always find these women?).   But the myriad of minor characters could have gone farther.<br />Archer  continues to make the occasional mistake of having an American use phrases  that only a British person would use, but generally he gets it right.<br />I  was disappointed to find a couple of spelling mistakes (not the British vs  American spelling variety, but genuine mistakes) in a bestselling  book.<br />There were also a few underdeveloped storylines (such as the KGB's  role in Armstrong's life) or hurried and confusing lines (such as  Armstrong's dealings in Berlin that began his rise to power).<br />But the one  thing that bothered me to the end was that the Armstrong character, who had  been so attached to his mother as a boy, never once even THOUGHT of his  family much less tried to find them after he was forced to flee from the  Nazis.  How could he spend his entire life without knowing what happened to  them (or providing a better life for them)?<br />In the end, it was a good  story, but shallow in many ways.  I have read all of Jeffrey Archer's  novels since I was first captivated by &quot;Shall We Tell the  President&quot; but either I'm getting older and more critical or he's  failing to live up to his past successes.
0553280325|5.0|I didn't know what to read until my friend, Triniko Dutton, told me about  Something Wicked Comes This Way or something like that byRay Bradbury. I  figured why not. At the time I wasn't into reading and I went to an island  in Maine with no conviencence's and I could not put it down. Even after I  went to bed I would wake a 2 or 3 hours later wanting to know what was  going to happen next. An excellent book and my hat of to Mr.Ray Bradbury
0399142851|3.0|This was the first Cornwell novel I've read.  I have since read  Postmortem, her first novel.  I was disappointed to find some similarities.   The criminal sought to harm Kay, someone broke into her office computer  (which she thought was impossible--in both stories!), and there was a  conspiracy from within the government.<br />I also prefer to have the crime  solved with hard work and good old deductive reasoning instead of sheer  luck and a long shot (this applies to both books).<br />I'm going to try a few  more Scarpetta tales and I hope for a little more brain power and a little  less redundancy.
B000003NA4|5.0|Krall herself writes the best interpretation for what she is trying to  portray.  When, in the album jacket, she refers to romantic love as a  definite part in the making of this CD, she almost challenges the listener  to think of something more important.<br />Tough love speaks enough for a fan  about to sell the studio apartment on the East Side to see her perform live  in concert, buy every album, who thinks of her on the night shift, sings  her in the shower, plays her solo on the old stand-up.  Why would  &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot; hit platinum and send shivers down the spine of  every jazz-loving man-child?  Why?  Some people like the abuse, the  servitude.  <br />The opening track, &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot;, &quot;They  Can't Take That Away From Me&quot;, among others carry the rhythm and the  foundation of her voice she could cough, sneeze, or whimper and it would  still swing or sound funky.  <br />What Krall does, however, leads the ear to  believe it knows where it is going, but finishes words, sentences, thoughts  with a hardly noticeable consonant, a final twirl, or not at all, and just  lead to the next line in the same bagpipe-sized breath, phew, how's that  for a sentence?
0399143904|3.0|Good, but not great, book about a crack international team of  counter-terrorists.  They are prepared for anything, but unknowingly face a  plan to annihilate most of the world's population.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Ms. Hill really poured out her heart and soul into this album. I was  captivated by her sweet voice laying down deep, thought provoking lyrics. I  have always enjoyed her flava in any song, and was anxiously awaiting the  release of this album. I had no idea that Zion and ex-facto, among others,  would be so riveting that I would not want to hear any other music but  her's since it's release. If you have it, groove it. Recommend it! If you  don't have it, GET IT! I LOVED IT!!!!
B000002AQQ|5.0|This album is incredible : Has great bands and wonderful songs. I can say  that this album is great as the film My favorits artist in this album are :  Jefferson Airplane , Youngbloods , Buffalo Springfield and Lynyrd  Skynyrd<br />It must be on your collection
B00000AFDW|4.0|After almost 20yrs, the original members are back. Psycho Circus is one  their best efforts of the past decade and a half. Sure, there are some  clunkers in there, but in whole, the album is great. The stand-outs are the  title track &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; &quot;I Pledge Allegiance&quot; and  &quot;Raise Your Glasses&quot; The tour is a must see.
B00000420F|5.0|I've just fallen in love with a soprano, my next gift to her is going to  be this cd. I've just ordered it here. These songs really excell in there  intensity, the beautifull way Bartoli sings them and perfect interaction  between the romantic piano and her voice.
0670880728|4.0|I swallowed this book in a few, delightful hours, laughing out loud and  thoroughly enjoying my brief escape from reality.  Surely, there is a bit  of Bridget Jones in all of us.  (In my case, quite a lot.) I haven't seen  my actual copy of the book for weeks because it is making the rounds of all  the women I know.  Let's face it, we all could use a good laugh! Now, if  you'll excuse me, I'm going to tally my fat calories.......
0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is the best tool for becoming wealthy and wise  I've read.  The use of years of research from interviewing people who have  learned that they are in control of their incomes not the reverse.  I qoute  this book every day of my life and found the lessons displayed in this book  to extend to all walks of life.  I can say without a doubt that this book  has increased my personal wealth as well as my happiness.
B000002TPS|3.0|This is probably Megadeth's worst album.  It is not bad, though.  This is  also probably their most radio friendly album.  It just lacks the  excitement of earlier albums like Killing is my Business and Business is  Good, Peace Sells but Who's Buying, or Rust in Peace.  There are some good  songs on here, like Reckoning Day, Killing Road, and Victory.  A Tout Le  Monde is OK.  However there is nothing on this album that compares to  Megadeth classics like &quot;Rattlehead&quot; &quot;Black Friday&quot; or  &quot;Set the World Afire&quot;  If you like Megadeth, you should pick this  album up, but not before their great albums like Killing is my Business and  Business is Good, and Peace Sells but Who's Buying, or Rust in Peace
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is the screen adaptation of Philip K. Dick 'Do Androids Dream  of Electric Sheep' and although it differs slightly it remains true to his  harrowing vision of our bleak future. It tackles some difficult moral and  ethical questions that we will be forced to deal with soon. Nothing is for  certain.  END
B000002J1F|5.0|This is Yes' best album. &quot;90125&quot; gave them a hit, this album  gave them immortality. &quot;Roundabout,&quot; &quot;South Side of the  Sky,&quot; and &quot;Heart of the Sunrise,&quot; are three of the finest  tracks yes has ever produced. The shorter pieces in between are interesting  enough to understand the individual members (each of their solo pieces did  give insight into their later solo material and their personalities). This  album is still widely popular today. While it probably would not have given  them a number one hit as &quot;90125&quot; did, this music is just plain  good quality, intelligence, and talent. A milestone in the history of  prog-rock.
B00000AFFI|5.0|From the opening silence of &quot;Angelene&quot; to breathlessness of  &quot;Is this Desire?&quot; PJ Harvey's new release whispers with passion  and a muted rage. With this haunting release PJ has created a lovelorn  cousin to Nick Cave's The Boatman's Call. It is a unique addition to  Harvey's oeuvre. Harvey's songs are populated by those on the margins,  mostly women, who've either been cast aside or have somehow reached their  end. Not as apocalyptic as Tom Waits' Bone Machine, it conveys a similar  sense of unfulfilled yearning as the Waits classic. &quot;A Perfect Day  Else&quot; contains  one of the most unforgettable descriptions of  religious eroticism: &quot;God is the sweat running down his back/The water  soaked her blonde hair black.&quot; A stunning effort.
B000001E8S|5.0|After doing music like this, one wonders how U2 ever did POP. This album  is not entirely U2, but is mostly it is still much better than Zooropa and  POP. &quot;One Minute Warning&quot; is an exceptional track with probably  the most recognizable example of Edge's early echoing guitar. Bono's vocals  are more emotional on this album than most other U2 albums. Brian Eno and  Daniel Lanois make fine musical additions as opposed to being simple  producers. Pavarotti's opera vocal in Miss Saravejo melds surprisingly well  with Bono's (though not technically a duet). Adam Clayton does a vocal on  &quot;Your Blue Room&quot;, but overall the album is filled with emotional  mood pieces, electronica-based compositiongs (worthier than the trash on  POP), and even some up-beat ethno-music. this should've been U2's new  definitive album instead of POP. Marketing works though...so maybe this  album should've gotten moe attention.
068484267X|5.0|This is a truly marvellous book - it takes the reader along on a  rollercoaster of emotions -on one page the story being told will make you  laugh so much that it is difficult to stop, the next page you will want to  weep for the tales of harrowing poverty being so graphically portrayed. All  the time though the author's sense of humour and his truly wonderful  understanding of life comes shining through. This account of his, and his  family's, life in a succession of urban slum dwellings will lift the reader  so that by the conclusion you will wish to heartily endorse his final  statement.
B000002HH9|3.0|&quot;Want,&quot; &quot;Club America,&quot; &quot;Gone,&quot; and  &quot;Numb&quot; are reminiscent of classic Cure, while &quot;Mint  Car&quot; sounds a lot like an updated &quot;Friday I'm in Love.&quot;  &quot;This is a Lie&quot; is the best track on the album, but overall, this  is another standard Cure album. Gothic, yet with strange and upbeat  melodies. Odder than most Cure albums, but still decent. Not exactly one of  their best however.
B000002GG0|3.0|Lost my old album years ago, and can't find this in stores.  Thanks  Amazon!  It'll be good to reinstate it to my collection.  Can't give it 5  stars, due to lack of general popularity, but Foreigner Suite has  sentimental value for me.
B000002C1X|5.0|My first expirence with Pink Floyd was with The Wall.  It changed the way  I listened to music forever.  The movie is a must see if not before you  ever listen to the cd.  It is one of the most creative music pieces ever  recorded.  This piece of music will last generations.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead's latest album combines so many emotions and so many creative  juices into one album that it blows you back in your seat.  One listen and  you will be overtaken by the pounding beats, the wafty guitars, and yet all  this blends so sonically that one might not notice the overpowering themes  to this piece of art as music.
B0000026J6|5.0|As a fan who has every original Cohen album, this one is quite simply the  best.  \\"Songs Of\\" will always be a sentimental favorite but  \\"I'm Your Man,\\" from beginning to end is one the most  enlightening musical voyages you will ever take.   Lyrics have always been  Cohen's strong point but now we have a maturity in the music itself, laced  with just enough pop/rock licks and tricks that my Oldies-loving wife even  likes some of these songs.  How coincidental that his voice is at its  masculine best to match the penetrating lyrical expeditions.  No wonder a  new generation of music fans and performers alike fell in love with this  guy {re:  the tribute albums that followed}.  This album is the perfect  cure for the unidentifiable musical phlegm that is spewing from too many  radio speakers near and far as you read this.  Leonard Cohen is quite  simply too cool for the charts and too intense for the masses. Buy this,  spend a quiet weekend listening, and find out why.
0345315227|4.0|Although the actual plot left something to be desired, I consider this an  excellent book. Clarke's main purpose was, I believe, not to entertain but  to question. If you really read it and went between the lines, you will  notice the remarks about today's society. But Clarke couldn't write a whole  book just about that. He had to involve some plot to it, and decided that  the Space Odyssey series was the best suited. If you loved the rest of the  series, and if you like thought provoking works, I highly reccomend this  book.
B000000OXH|4.0|Asia's first album is impressive in its minimalistic approach...and it is  still an album that bursts with talent. The same can be said about this  second outing. Alpha is filled with the same kind of harmonies and musical  quality, and then some. &quot;Never in a Million Years&quot; has one of the  best chorus harmonies Asia has ever done, but the entire album is great.  Give it a listen.
6304711891|4.0|This film as I said is a very realistic one. This is because the commando  sent to alcatraz seems to be heroic but in the middle of the film nearly  all of them die. Only few of them survive [the main actors]. So it is not  the same story that the AMERICAN heros win in an way without being hit from  a bullet.  On the other hand their are some exagerations .. when the F-16  destroy Alcatraz...the flying trum. But on the whole it is a good film with  amazing screen shoots espacialy if you like war planes and a lot of  explosions...give special attention to the trum in the begining of the  film.<br />Nice Film REALY AMAZING !!!     END
0880389052|5.0|&quot;Homeland&quot; is possibly R.A. Salvatore's finest work written to  date, with the possible exception of &quot;The Legacy&quot;. A beautiful  story set in perhaps one of the most creative settings ever in a fantasy  story, this story both tugs at one's heartstrings and pulls at one's  imagination. Menzoberranzen is presented in such intricate, almost loving,  detail that one wonders if Salvatore has created the world or is merely  reporting on it. The morality of the book, so often overdone in many of his  later books, is perfectly presented in this story as the main character,  Drizzt, must begin to make his own decisions as to what is wrong and right.  Salvatore  as well, writes of a very intricate relationship between  Drizzt's father and his son, a relationship that is much more complex and  intricate than many in his later books. The characterization in this book  is superior to many of his other books, and the reader can come to believe  that the characters are real people in a real world, so vividly are each  painted. In general, this book is excellent in every way, a complex and  gripping story set in a detailed and wonderous world. Any fan of fantasy,  and many people who are not fans, will love this story. I recommend it  wholeheartedly.
B000002J20|4.0|People often wonder if Patrick Moraz's energy in the later album  &quot;Relayer&quot; would have made a difference in the overall dull sound  of this album. Rick Wakeman just wasn't interested in long pieces anymore  without any purpose. The music is exceedingly long, and bursts with  blandness. Not that it is a bad album, but one must wonder what the band  was thinking with this album. But, what the hell? Yes has never really  sucked...though they have had worse moments than this.
B000006OAM|5.0|Tigerlily is beautiful, Ophelia is incredible.  Natalie Merchant is ahead  of her time- this music never grows old or stale.  Put it on and turn it up  LOUD!
B000002KZA|4.0|Even in the days before Depeche Mode's transformation into goth-synth,  this album signified a darker side to synth-pop than most bands of the  genre. The music is akin to New Order, pulsing with danceable beats, but  with somewhat dark melodies and subjects. No track really stands out, but  the entire album is enjoyable and gets the blood flowing. Worth listening.
B000003CKH|5.0|About two years ago I went to the Conan O'Brien show in NYC.  The music  act for that show was this band called &quot;Cake.&quot;  As they emerged I  said to my girlfriend: &quot;Oh no, another one of these wimp Seattle  bands.&quot;  They then proceeded to play a song called &quot;The  Distance.&quot;  I was stunned....everyone there was stunned.  The sound of  that song is so penetrating and exciting and unusual...at last, some new  music that has true grab.  I had the CD &quot;Fashion Nugget&quot; within a  few hours and I truly believe it is an instant classic: it has breadth,  humour, sizzle and sparkle.  I give this CD to people all the time and they  are always emormously appreciative and become instant fans of this obscure  band from who-knows-where.  Where is their next album??
B000002L9M|4.0|The first example of DM's gothic synth music impressed me with its  innovation and musical quality. &quot;Black Celebration&quot; is an  appropriately dark piece of work, while &quot;Sometimes,&quot; and &quot;It  Doesn't Matter Two,&quot; were musically very interesting. The rest of the  album pulses with electronic depression that kicked me in the heart. I love  this band, and this is one of their finest albums.

1567184855|5.0|I have read and Passed on this book to MANY , who are also on a Search.   Like several of the other reviewers, I  have had a NDE.  The books that I  need seem to find me. This one was a spectacular find !  It's almost as if  I had &quot;remembered&quot; some of the information  within the covers of  this book. I found my life unfolding according to the Laws that Dr. Newton  presented.   The format of interviewing people , and then folowing them as  they take their Journey, after physical death, made it almost impossible to  put down. I also  find myself using some of the techniques in my own  meditation, with spectacular success. I am  looking forward to seeing  another book from this Author, as soon as possible !
B000002WYT|5.0|If you ask me Crash is the best of the best when it comes to DMB albums.   I've seen them live and listned to almost all of there albums.  This is by  far the best.  I'd call it a perfect album, however it is missing one of my  fav's Ants Marching.  But other then that you can't go wrong with this  album!
B00000AFDW|3.0|Bruce Fairbairn did a good job of production on this uneven effort,  getting a great sound out of the fab 4. Unfortunately, not all of the  material was worth the effort. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the  album. Cuts like &quot;Psycho Circus,&quot; &quot;Within&quot; and  &quot;Into the Void&quot; really kick. There are some other good moments as  well. It's similar to many other KISS albums where it seems that the boys  figured that once they had 5 or 6 good songs, the rest didn't matter as  much. All in all, I'm glad I bought it. It's a kick for a long time fan to  have something new from the original version of the group.
B00000AFHM|4.0|This Scottish octet is without doubt one of the best band on the music  scene today. This album puts most of the year's releases to shame. I feel  sorry for anyone who has yet to discover this group (that means most  people). Wake up! Stop listening to Backstreet Boys and Matchbox 20!
B00000AFFF|4.0|There's always a critical backlash against an artist that critics have  given either too much praise, or pinned too many of their hopes on.<br />Elvis  Costello is an example of a talented artist that has recently gotten the  short  end of the stick from critics that previously lauded his  work.<br />Yes, EC is not Bob Dylan, but Dylan was never Dylan either. This  fine album(which deserves 4 1/2 stars)is a very promising collaboration  between two influential artists of their generation and, while not perfect,  is quite exceptional. Elvis voice, although not really suited to the  material in terms of range, makes up for its roughness with the naked  emotion expressed with his vocals.<br />EC continues to impress because of  his desire and ability to experiment within a variety of different formats  and ranges. An exceptional album.
0787105686|5.0|This was an emotional rollercoaster.  The joy and pain of being deeply in  love is so well brought out by Mr. Waller.  I insisted  that my wife listen  to the audio book, since she finds in hard to find time to read.  She too  was overwhelmed with the story.  We have since mentioned the book to our  friends and have rented the video.  Although the movie was good, it could  not come close to the incredible story Mr. Waller has written.  <br />This  story is more remarkable when you take into account Mr. Waller's background  and the fact that it was an early, if not his first, book.<br />I look forward  to more of his work.
B000002B38|1.0|If David Gilmour wanted to continue making Pink Floyd albums, to take the  band in a new creative direction, fine, great.  He doesn't.  The 2  post-Waters albums and world-wide concert dates that followed were  approached like a bad Hollywood sequel.  They attempted to capture a  formula and harness a  band legend for profit.  Nothing unique or original  was ever attempted.  Just imitative drivel.  Perhaps nothing is more  indicative of their failure to produce anything worthwhile than the  immediate glut of live albums, two double-live offerings on the heels of  just 2 single studio releases.  The intent should be obvious:  to showcase  the original Pink Floyd material in the context of the now Waterless  lineup.  This second live release featuring Dark Side of the Moon in it's  entirety was, no doubt, a response to Roger Waters hugely successful  (televised live in every country except the U.S.) staged performance of The  Wall in 1990.  In both instances every lyric (and in most cases, basic song  structure and sound/visual effects) that passed into digitally-encoded  glory are credited to Roger Waters.  The crime here is not so much their  treatment of the Floyd legacy as it is their insistence on basing their  entire identity on creative juices not their own.  If you wasted your money  on this concert (like I did)  don't waste any more on this lavishly  produced and packaged instance of court-approved copyright infringement.
B000004286|5.0|The soundtrack to Braveheart is a perfect marriage between an important  contribution of Scottish history and the true meaning behind FREEDOM.  Americans, in particular, could learn a lot by its message which rings true  with the sounds that none other could equal. It was if they were made for  each other.
0812550706|2.0|I won't pretend that I know how a 5-year old genius' mind works, but I'm  pretty sure it isn't as depicted in this book.  Card prefaces the most  recent edition saying that many people are turned off from this story by  the way he characterizes the children; well, count me in.  I felt more like  I was reading about the thoughts and actions of teenagers.  Plus, I was  able to guess the ending approximately halfway through.  No real surprises  here.  It's a great idea carried out with little creativity, ala Michael  Crichton.
B000003BF4|5.0|If I had one Rolling Stones CD to take with me to a desert island, it  would be this one. Recorded live in 1969, it captures the raw gutsy sound  of Keith's rhythm guitar and Mick Taylor's mean ass leads. My particular  favorite is Sympathy for the Devil where Taylor belts out one of my all  time favorite guitar solos. Stray Cat Blues is another classic which  features signature guitar leads by Taylor. <br />This is the essential Rolling  Stones live.
B000003S5H|4.0|The intro song sets the tone for the remainder of the album.  The album  borrows its feel from the &quot;groovy&quot; bands of the late 60s and 70s,  including Traffic, etc. but sharpens the production to render an incredibly  slick album that isn't afraid to be both poppy and serious.  It is a  combination of many genres that evolves into a fairly unique final product.
B000000W3G|5.0|I think this is one of the best buys I've had! All singles come full of  songs, and all songs are very interesting not only in the lyrics, but the  music itself! There is also a mix between  acustic and almost metal...like  comparinh Zero single with Tonight, Tonight..there is also pop, like  1979...If I were to take on thing to a deserted island, it would certainly  be this box and a radio!Plus all the cool pics inside! They all did an  EXCELLENT job on this! I'm pretty happy to have it!
0684803356|4.0|The Book was well written.  It provided me with many hours of  entertainment.
B000002ITW|5.0|This is a great album for any person who would like to relive the great  days of the 60's.  Sure it is sloppy in spots and very idealistic but so  was that decade!  The guitar work can be great at times and some of the  banter brings you back to a much simpler time.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|It's about time Phil Collins had a greatest hits CD. I own several of his  albums, but this one includes his harder to find songs (Separate Lives,  Easy Lover) as well as his classic hits (Susudio, Another Day in Paradise).  Definitely a must-have for any fan of great music.
B000002B38|1.0|David Gilmour and the rest should stop trying to survive on past glory  which has only been achieved by the lyrical genius of Roger Waters
0399143904|3.0|The book reads like play it again Sam. Ebola threat but not as much hero  or terror as last Ebola threat. Too  long and too much time on the firing  line. I love the quality of the heros like those  in &quot;Lonesone  Dove&quot;. No doubt who is good or bad but the villians and plot requires  too much of a conspiracy to be believeable. Hope TC does a better job all  the way around if he does another Ryan-Clark-Domingo-character in a book.  His poorest effect!
B000002UB3|5.0|No group has EVER produced this quality of music before or since (and none  are likely to in the foreseeable future).  The Beatles always transended  beyond all other &quot;music,&quot; and produced an art form worthy of a  different classification.  There is not a track on this album that isnt   interesting, inovative and truly enjoyable.
B000002NAK|3.0|I am a Madonna fan, and I think she acquits herself quite well on this CD.   She also was fantastic in the movie, but the CD doesn't hold up on  repeated listenings.  First, Antonio Banderas can't really sing - he has  emotion and drama but a really weak voice.  Madonna's voice is stronger  than it used to be but can't measure up to the power and beauty of Patti  LuPone, who is a Broadway-trained diva.  Jonathan Pryce has a wonderful  voice which is so ill-used on this CD as to be criminal.  He doesn't get to  truly sing at all but rather sing-speaks a few lines here and there.  I  think in several years if you haven't seen the movie, you won't understand  why everyone liked this CD because it is, in the end, thin.
0399103422|5.0|The book that instead of blaming &quot;mafia&quot; for all the evil they  do, actually shows the reader why do they do it.   Plus, incredible  personality portrait. It is more psychological than criminal reading.
B000002TQV|5.0|I wish there was a sixth star available for this album.  Without a doubt,  one of the greatest albums off all time.  They set the standards of rock,  and then they set them again..and again...
6302136105|2.0|Val Kilmer has the moves down, and does a good impression singing like  Morrison...BUT...he does not have Jim Morrison's looks or charisma.  John  Travolta was slated to play Morrison, and HE has looks and charisma and  acting talent...BUT the Doors said, &quot;Travolta is a nice guy. Jim  Morrison was not a nice guy.&quot; So they vetoed Travolta. (Didn't they  see Travolta play a jerk in SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER, for which he received an  Oscar nomination?) I can't stand that Travolta is a Scientologist, but he  would have been better than Kilmer. The other problem with this movie is  that Oliver Stone is a lousy writer...and the script stinks. Norman Mailer  said in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;: &quot;THE DOORS is one of the all time bad  movies.&quot; And he was right. The only reason I didn't give this movie  one star is that the sound track is BRILLIANT. That goes without saying,  since it's all Doors music. So, while you are watching a bad movie, you DO  get to listen to great music. (Read Ray Manzarek's book LIGHT MY FIRE, and  you'll see that he hated the movie.)     END
B000001DTM|5.0|Probably not their biggest seller, but their best musically. After the  rampant ego of Rattle &amp; Hum (which isn't bad in spite of that) and  before the current techno phase, Achtung Baby caught U2 at the height of  their abilities. There really isn't a bad song on the album and several  have to go down as among the best ever, regardless of genre. If you even  sorta like U2, Achtung Baby MUST be in your collection
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica put alot of feeling towards this particular album but in all  acuality Marz Headlin used a suprizing 5 rifts in some these songs and also  five rifts in And Justice For All.
B00000AFFI|4.0|P.J. Harvey has been busy the last few years going out on a tangent and  making music (soundtracks, compilation albums, etc., etc.)but what we have  all been waiting for is now finally here. Polly Jean has emerged from the  studio with Flood right behind her and they have in their hands the latest  collection of dwelling, screaming, and storytelling from an original and  truly unique individual. It seems as though these two really learned quite  a bit from their last work together, because this album is definetly an  improvement. You might call it mellower than usual, as you will be hard  pressed to hear any guitars, but don't be fooled. You don't as much listen  to her as you do feel her, and there is a lot to feel here.
B00000AFFF|5.0|I seldom praise without restraint many releases, but, the recent 'Painted  From Memory' is a gem that belongs in any CD collection of any real taste  (David Marsh you can eat your words on this one).  This recording  integrates Bacharach's smoothness with the restrained edge of Costello  which produces a musical statement much greater than the sum of it's  indidvidual parts. Much like the collaboration and dynamics of a Lennon and  McCartney, (although do do not confuse this with a similar sound). One can  see where a different and unexpected twist takes us to a place we didn't  expect both melodically and with respect to the singing which Costello has  taken to a new level. Still having said that it will be interesting to see  what some talented covers of some of these songs will produce. Note they  have to be talented covers! Bravo Burt and Elvis (Declan). Standouts  include but by no means are limited to: Painted From Memory, In My Darkest  Hour, I Still Have That Other Girl, and of course God Give Me Strength  (which I've been listening to for two years). Encore..Encore
0385484518|4.0|Morrie Schwartz was a sweet, caring man who had a lot to teach.  The most  touching anecdote is his death bed regret for not forgiving an old friend  before the friend died.  It is a poignant lesson that even a sweet man like  Schwartz can lose a friend through pride.<br />On the other hand, Albom is an  annoying presence in this book.  He dutifully hates himself for his worldly  success, but obviously made a tidy sum on this runaway best seller.   Schwartz is too fond of Morrie's aphorisms (e.g., &quot;to learn how to  live, you must learn how to die.&quot;)  Morrie's recollections and present  sense impressions are far more valuable than the cliches that Albom thinks  so profound.  I also wish Albom had not waited until the end of the book to  disclose the financial relationhip that he and Morrie had entered into.   There is nothing wrong with it and, in fact, it was a noble gesture.  But  through most of the book there is no explanation of why Albom's visits were  such a high priority to this dying man.
0812550757|5.0|and then put it back together. This is a far better book than Ender's  Game, which I also liked. It's more thoughtful, more emotional, more mature  than any science fiction novel I have ever read. Novinha touched me deeply.  The scenes at the beginning of her at the funeral and then of her isolation  as a child and later an adult made me cry. Ender was also a more attractive  character in this book than in Ender's Game. I've read both of the sequels  to this book, but I don't find them as good as this one.
0140177396|5.0|This book moves me. I've read it probably 3 or 4 times growing up, and it  still finds a way to grab hold of me. Steinbeck's characters are the most  true, honest people in fiction, in my humble opinion. Anyway, read the  book. It's good.
0312955006|4.0|The Concrete Blonde is my third Harry Bosch's noval and the fifth of  Connelly's. After reading the two non-Bosch noval - The Poet &amp;  Blookwork - which are both absolutely excellent books, I started reading  Harry Bosch series and started from the latest ones (Trunk Music, and The  Last Coyote). Both, IMHO, are not so good. The Concrete Blonde, however, is  a much better book compare to those two. I wish I had started the series  from the earliest ones which sure would have made The Last Coyote that much  more interesting to read. (In some ways, The Last Coyote is not exactly a  stand-alone noval, which is more like the sequel of The Concrete Blonde).  However, I enjoy The Concrete Blonde very much - good plot, good characters  development, and as always, good story telling.  My advice is that if you  haven't started the Harry Bosch's series, don't start like I did.
0440131480|5.0|Probably the funniest book I've ever read.  Vonnegut always has something  worthwhile to say, but this is probably his best work ever!  A must-read  for everyone.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|All right!  After a lot of inferior &quot;Nuggets&quot; releases that  watered down the impact of the original 1972 Nuggets album, the original is  back!  And not only is the entire original album back, it is augmented by  another THREE more CDs of great stuff!  This is the most awesome collection  of '60s garage/psychedelic tunes yet.  Essential to anyone's rock  collection.
0671015206|5.0|Finally....the book that answered my questions about how average Joe's (or  Jane's) accumulate wealth in their lifetimes.<br />After reading, I sold my  $300.00 a month Nissan Altima for a '89 Buick (paid in full) and also  reduced my insuance costs.<br />I still find it tough to be a  &quot;tightwad&quot; like some of those people in the book but I'm  learning.  I work with a guy who actually fits the &quot;model&quot; of  many people in that book.  He owns 25 rental properties, gets excited about  49 cent Big Macs, drives a regular van, wears junky clothes, house paid  for, uses cash for everything....you would never guess his net woth is  around a mill...amazing to me.<br />I recommend the book highly. I'm waiting  for the cassette tape to come out.
B000001FMC|5.0|Swing Out Sister, &quot;Its Better to Travel&quot; It really is better to  travel. The CD is best heard when you are in Germany's Black Forest. Go to  Baden Baden and stand in the Stadtmitte (City Middle) and watch and listin  as art comes alive. This CD is Europe at is best! A must when you are  traveling.
B000002U82|5.0|How someone can't like this albulm is beyond me.  The flow of the music is  simply incredible, and nothing is to rushed.  The sound of the clocks in  &quot;Time&quot; and the money in &quot;Money&quot; fits in quite nicely.
B0000041Q3|5.0|I concur that this is one of the very best performances of Turandot.  The  music is breathtaking.  I get goosebumps every time I here it. My wife and  I were privileged to see Turandot at the opening night of the San Francisco  Opera in September, and Richard Margison was marvelous.  I look forward to  more recordings by him, but for now, Pavarotti is the best.  This is a must  have for any opera lover.
B000001GBJ|5.0|These songs have brought me to life and awaken my lost spirit in my secret  garden; the spirit which I have lost when my fiance has left me. Thanks to  the people who has composed, played and sung those secrets...
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore really understands superheroes. Better than the people who  normally write the comics. From the idealistic patriotism of the 1950's to  the disillusionment of the sixties and seventies, even environmentalism and  changing attitudes towards nuclear Power, Alan Moore is charting the  history of Western society through its comics. As time goes by, cynicism  shows the heroes in their true colours. Rorschach's extreme right wing  views and paranoia, and the comedian whose entire life is one tasteless  joke.
0786209798|5.0|As with all of DeMille's books, I couldn't put it down.   A very very  enjoyable read.
068484267X|5.0|Torn between wanting to reach the end and not wanting to finish this book,  Angela's Ashes was an amazing read, touching all my senses. I wait  impatiently to read about the 19 year old Frank in America.
0425107469|5.0|I read this a few months ago, and I loved it.  The dog was so lovable, and  so beleivable.  Who else, but Koontz, can make a dog seem so human like?  I  recommend this to dog lovers, Koontz lovers, and whoever wants a good read!
B00000AFGM|5.0|I love how MM has reinvented himself on this CD. The glam turn he's taken  is terrific. I can definitely see how he's grown as a person and an artist  since his last CD. His lyrics -- as always -- give a really clear view of  what is going on in his head at this particular time in his career. My  personal favorites are New Model 15 and Don't Like the Drugs, although it's  hard for me to just pick a few favorites. MM has taken some of the best  influences of 70s glam and incorporated them into his own style of music to  make a CD that is interesting, creative and (dare I say?) fun. Loved it!
B000002IQ9|5.0|I listen to this CD at least once a week.  The sound is so natural, and  the feedback from the audience adds greatly to the excitement of this CD.   Everyone should own this CD!
0385493622|5.0|Exciting and captivating.  I could not have imagined that I would be  reading a math non-fiction book with the same interest as I read a techno  thriller from Clancy. It is easy to understand and follow.  It actually  made me think that I could go ahead myself and tackle some of the maths  problems that are out there waiting to be solved (wishfull thinking!! he  he); however, readying the book made me feel smart and capable of doing so,  as I could understand everything.
B00000DBXL|5.0|Lotsa vintage Cake on this album, but not as many insightful witty songs  as the previous two.  Don't get me wrong, they're still the best rock on  the market.  A great album, especially the ones with their newer sounds,  like Never There and Hem of Your Garment.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt's, The Book of Secrets, is a hauntingly beautiful work  of Celtic music.  McKennitt draws inspiration from her own impressions as  well as from stories of the distant past.  The poetry, the music, and  McKennitt's voice creates a mood of nostalgia for things past and leads the  listener into a world now only found internally.  I am reminded of the  vanishing island of Avalon where magic still lives and one only need  imagine to find oneself there.
B000000XB9|5.0|If you want a quick smattering of this all time great band, grab this  record at once!  Almost all of these songs are true classics.  I started  with this one and was so impressed that I collected all their original  recordings.  The music is a good blend of Americana music at its best  between the late sixties and early seventies.  I prefer the eleven minute  version of &quot;Grapevine&quot; from Cosmos Factory and don't care for Hey  Tonight too much but otherwise this is as close to perfect as you can get.
B000002NJS|5.0|I love this cd it rocks everyone should buy it because you're guaranteed  to love it!
0805210393|5.0|This is Kafka at his best. An incomprehensible system with  incomprehensible procedure but a man, along with the masses, invest their  lives into it. The symbolism is obvious and its impact devastating. The  monomaniacal attempts to get entrance to the Castle are hilarious and  frightening at the same time. At one moment, you think it is so absurd, but  then you think how each event can so easily be trnslated into your  existence. A must read!!
0061092037|2.0|I have enjoyed many of Mr. Archer's novels, but this one did not seem to  be up to his usual standard. Like &quot;Kane and Abel&quot; and &quot;First  Among Equals,&quot; it tells the life stories of ambitious men who become  bitter rivals. However, the characters were not likable, which made it  difficult for me to identify with their struggles.<br />More damagingly, one  of the characters was from a Jewish background, but the novel is full of  the most elementary errors about Jewish culture. The author obviously did  no research in this area. I can't help wondering whether the book also  contains errors about Australian culture (the background of the second  character) which I was unable to spot.
0790734834|5.0|This movie had it all.  The screenplay was to perfection, the acting was  superb, and the actors were just right for their parts.  All in all, this  movie (by my opinion) should have won more than it did.  The screenplay and  best supporting actress was not enough for this movies excellence.     END
B00000AFWW|5.0|By now, most punk is either a retread of 1976 (conservative and  reactionary), or has become popped-up, while claiming to be  &quot;Alternative&quot;. The rock / pop on &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; is  accessible, commercial, and polished ... all those things that are supposed  to be unforgivable sins in the ossified, dogmatic world of late '90's  &quot;underground&quot;. Hole doesn't sound punk anymore, and they aren't  pretending to be. They are, however, clearly writing, playing, and singing  from their hearts and having a good time at last. God bless 'em, they  deserve it. And I, for one, will not begrudge them any success they find.  Selling out never sounded so good!
B000003BEV|3.0|The Rolling Stones take an interesting foray into the world of Psychedelia  and for the most part it is indeed very good.  What brings this album down  is the extended Sings This All Together piece and Gomper. The extended  piece would be better if it were considerably shorter and Gomper is nearly  completely atonal.  The other material works because the songs themselves  are filled with catchy hooks galore. Most of the material bears little  resemblance to other Stones work except for maybe the guitar riffs in  Citadel.  The 3D album cover is a treat in itself.
0380002930|5.0|Adams' eloquent tale of a band of rabbits searching for freedom and safety  can strike a chord with humans as well.  The bonds of friendship forged in  adversity are easily understood by anyone who has withstood considerable  odds and come out all right.  Adams explains the lapine world through their  eyes, complete with a &quot;Lapine Glossary&quot; for those not in the know  of rabbitspeak.  The protagonists are given very distinct--human, if you  will--traits and personalities.  Adams creates his own microcosm of our  world by bringing up themes familiar to our own world and the creation of  new civilizations: the development of leadership and structure, roles in a  society, and mutual respect for the members of a competent cadre.   Hazel-rah, Bigwig, Fiver, Blackberry, Dandelion, and the rest inhabit a  world not unlike our own.  This is an adventure, a fairy tale, a parable,  and the makings of a legend and a classic.
B000002KHB|5.0|Definitely this band's best record. Even though their style is limited, the seven songs on this disc are excellent.  Lazy is one of the major highlights with the searing spooky organ effects and the eventual heavy blues jam.  Blackmore shows off some great guitar chops.  Then there is the classic riffs of Smoke On The Water and Space Truckin'.  Ian Gillian is in top flight vocal form on the later track. Never Before is an overlooked gem.  Love the keyboard solo at the end.  A super disc indeed
006016848X|1.0|The entire contents of John Gray's books repeat the same tired old anecdotes and dogmas.  In his view, men are mute, dumb, inarticulate cave-men who can only comprehend mindless action-activities as a form of bonding, i.e., sports, butting heads, hanging out with 'buddies' over a beer, etc.  In the bedroom, they are rapacious savages-- demanding and poor at satisfying their partner's needs.  Men put out love in relationships only to get sex.  Women, in his view, are on the other hand moronic complainers, seeking a warm body to shelter them.  Women put out sex in relationships only to get platonic love and protection.  Women, in his view, far from being intellectual, want to pour out their feelings endlessly; we just want to talk, not act, according to Gray's quackery.  The solution, he holds, that will enable these two inadequate and polarized psychopaths to survive in a marriage, is MUTUAL SELF-SACRIFICE.  Men, be patient if she is a frigid, passive complainer who leans on your protection in return for love.  That is simply the nature of women.  Women, tolerate his ape-ish habits, patiently sitting through a football game, or washing dishes while he retreats mutely into his anti-social &quot;cave.&quot; As you can see, John Gray's... ideas do not represent serious phychology or serious research.  His ideas do not promote mental health and self-improvement, only mistaken characatures of men and women.  His feel-good psychology, which evades personality problems and psychotic behaviors, under the guise that they are merely &quot;masculinity&quot; or &quot;femininitiy&quot; is pathetic and dumbed-down.  Don't buy his books.  Instead, check out Dr. Ellen Kenner, Dr. Nathaniel Branden, or Dr. Edith Packer.  They offer solutions, not self-sacrifice.<br />His book should be renamed &quot;Psychopathic Women Are From Venus and Inadequate, Stupid Men Are from Mars.&quot; Don't buy the book if you have an above-average I.Q. or an effective, normal personality.
0449227421|1.0|I usually enjoy Follett.  His writing is generally intelligent and  absorbing.  I rented the audio version of this book and was BIG TIME  disappointed.  Did Ken Follett really write this thing?  It was  predictable, corny, contained shallow characters, shallow character  interactions, and was just a bad read (or listen).  I rarely do not finish  a novel but I got just plain tired of this.  I endured about 85% of the  audio but just figured, with as predictable as everything was, I could  probably guess out how it ended.  Don't judge Ken Follett by this book (or,  better yet, don't read).
B000002JEV|5.0|This is great live album for Zep fans.  It captures Led Zeppelin in their  early stages.  The performance is wild.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore's reworking of the superhero mythos is nothing short of  breathtaking, The story is captivating and each tightly scripted panel is  itself a work of art. Perhaps the best of its type.
B000002J09|5.0|This is by far the best Led Zeppelin album and possibly one of the  greatest rock albums ever.  Great songs such as &quot;Rock and Roll,&quot;  &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;  make this  album so outstanding.  And who can forget the classic &quot;Stairway to  Heaven&quot; which was Zeppelin's greatest triumph.  An all around great  album, worth almost any price.
B000002JB3|5.0|Phil never ceases to amaze me with his musical talents.  I LOVE &quot;It's  In Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Same Moon&quot; and the title song,  &quot;Dance Into The Light&quot; can't help but put someone in a good mood.   &quot;The River So Wide&quot; gets one thinking about life and his  rendition of &quot;The Times Are Changing&quot; is better than Bob Dylan's!   Let's not forget how gorgeous &quot;Lorenzo&quot; is and how he took a  chance with it.  And &quot;Wear My Hat&quot; is very fun.  Phil still  enjoys what he does and it comes through in his music.  He demands  perfection and works with the best and it shows!  A must for your Phil  collection.  If you didn't catch the concert, you can buy it on video,  &quot;Live and Loose in Paris&quot;  Great fun!
B000003CMC|5.0|It has always angered me to hear a critic compare the Allman Brothers to  the Grateful Dead. Especially with an album like Eat A Peach, an album that  should not be thought of as anything but a testament to rock and roll  music, and if anything influenced rock music as a whole for the following  twenty some years .  the dead have never produced such complicated and  perfectly tight improvised music.
B000000H4V|5.0|In The HEAVY Metal section of Music, Sepultura is the most rocking and  best[except for Carcass(check 'em out)] One of the best thrash metal bands  out there and thrash metal is the best music! Blows away any Death Metal  band--Die Cannibal Corpse! These guys got heavy riffs played fast, tortured  vocals, tribal beats, for an awesome combo--Sepultura bloody ROCKS!!
0385484518|5.0|If only we could have this insight at the beginning of our lives!  This  book definitely helps you see how simple life can be...if only we would let  it!  It made me put into perspective what is important!
B000002G87|5.0|A CLASSIC.  This album has everything... great songs, passion, virtuoso  musicianship, musical camaradie... Really everything.  Eric and Duane  together, egging one another on -- what can be better than that?  There is  not a single song on this album that could be left out.  What more can I  say?
0553378384|5.0|The information is inspired &amp; I believe the most important data one  can recieve &amp; utilize. I rank it the #1 book to come into my life.  Thank you, Jan Spiller. Review by Herbert Le Vine, Astrologer 32 years  (this time),
B00000AFWZ|1.0|I bought this because of Rolling Stone Mags' 5 star review. Obviously  someone is getting a kickback.  This collection really sucks. There is a  reason so many of the songs were unfamiliar. They never received playtime  nor should they have. There is a few of the good oldies but the vast  majority of the songs are worthless. I got took but I will never buy  another Nugget compilation. Save your money. There are much better  compilations out there at a much cheaper cost. Physchedelia my ass. most of  this stuff was bad bubblegum.
0670880728|2.0|I was so disappointed in this book.  It started out well but I got sick of  reading the same things in every entry.  Bridget goes on and on about how  fat she is, then reveals in one entry that her thighs are 19 inches.  I  just got disgusted at that point because it made it seem like all of her  hystrionics about the rest of her life's problems were all for nothing.   Yuck!
0060977493|4.0|I was truly impressed by the spectacular word-craft displayed by this  first-time author. This and the poignant underpinning concerning the twins  more than make up for other deficiencies such as a superficial title, a  cliched ending, and playing up to western fantasies of India! All said,  hearty kudos for this ambitious author and I personally expect more good  stuff from her.
051788710X|5.0|At first sight of Robert Moss's book Conscious Dreaming I thought that it  might be a book with a different approach to those dreams, usually called  &quot;lucid&quot; dreams, in which one realizes one is dreaming. I was not  disappointed. Such dreams have come to me since I was a child over 50 years  ago. I used to call them &quot;conscious&quot; dreams and have always  thought they were fascinating and worth serious attention. So much so that  I have devoted much of my life to their study. But Conscious Dreaming is  about much more than I had appreciated. The book could almost have been  called &quot;conscious living.&quot; Robert Moss shows how dreams should  play a more significant part in our lives than is generally appreciated.  His approach is from the earthy yet spiritual practice of shamanism. He  says that &quot;some shamans believe that nothing occurs in ordinary  reality unless it has been dreamed first.&quot; This is no lightweight  &quot;New Age&quot; fantasy book. Robert Moss provides us with detailed  instructions on how to develop the craft of &quot;dreaming true&quot;.  Illustrated with many lively and convincing stories from his own  experiences and those of others, Conscious Dreaming is a wonderful manual  for anyone who wishes to realize the hidden potential of dreams for  improving their lives. The longest and perhaps the most important chapter  is &quot;Dreams of Healing&quot;. It includes sections on psychic  self-defence and &quot;calling back lost souls&quot; (in connection, for  example, with childhood abuse) but also on more physical aspects such as  getting early clues to physical disorders. In Conscious Dreaming Robert  Moss conveys a strong suggestion that there really is another world, the  mysterious world of spirit, which materialistic reductionist culture  ignores to its cost. With 27 pages of additional notes, further reading,  resource addresses and a helpful 12-page index, Conscious Dreaming is a  scholarly as well as inspiringbook. And it reads, as Patricia Garfield  says, like an adventure novel. I have read numerous fascinating books about  dreams. Conscious Dreaming stands out as a triumph of deep understanding  and human warmth. - Alan Worsley, Caduceus #36.
B000000W5L|2.0|ROCKS OFF is one of the greatest rock songs of all time. But it's the only  great thing on this album. TUMBLIN' DICE is pretty good, as is ALL DOWN THE  LINE and SWEET VIRGINIA. STOP BREAKING DOWN isn't bad. But the other songs  are dull, dull, dull. And that leaves a lot of dull songs, considering that  this is a double album. When I first bought this album, and after being  disappointed in it (but not knowing yet that critics loved it), a friend of  mine said that he'd read that this was as good as the Beatles WHITE ALBUM.  (!!!) I sincerely thought my friend had read the review wrong. I never  thought anyone could consider EXILE a great album. But then I read the  critics myself, and most think it's the Stones' greatest album...why I  don't know. Even Mick Jagger and Keith Richards don't think it is their  best album!! Mick said as much in &quot;Rolling Stone Magazine.&quot; And  Keith said, &quot;A lot of reviewers trashed this album when it came out.  And then when they reviewed later albums, these same reviewers said, `To  bad they ain't as good as on EXILE'&quot; So even a lot of these critics  who praise EXILE didn't like this album when it first came out!!! I would  say their first judgements were the accurate ones. (And by the way, I am a  Stones FREAK, so if anyone is going to be biased in their favor, it is me.  And I STILL don't like EXILE.
0606040439|5.0|Ender's Game has long been the only science fiction novel I always feel  comfortable recommending to my friends.  Card uses the creative freedom  that his futuristic world offers him along with all the satisfying  characteristics of a great novel:  well-developed characters, a fascinating  plot, and ideas that last long after the last page is read.  This is a must  read for people who love literature as well as science fiction fans.
0140143505|5.0|Do we ever appreciate the here and now when we're in the here and now?   That's the thought that I was left with after reading this fabulous book.   The time after the war may have been tough for both Helene and Frank, but  those moments spent in correspondence were probably the best moments of  their lives--and they didn't even know it.  There's a lesson here.  We  shouldn't always look to the past or the future for our definition of  happiness.  We may be living it right now.
0446605409|1.0|A poorly written novel that is extremely predictable and has the feel of  something manufactured, not a story.  The first person perspective does NOT  work since the main character is not defineable and has no redeeming  qualities.   The books feels like several scenes were stretched out to hit  an editor's target like a lazy student trying to achieve a 10k word  essay.<br />Demille's Charm School, Cathedral, Rivers of Babylon are excellant  stories, and books I plan to re-read.  But Plum Island, (like Spencerville)  left me with a feeling I had been cheated.  A bad movie, I will walk out  on, but a book is an investment.  Don't make it on this one.
B00000AFDW|2.0|Why are so many people rating this album 4-5 stars...<br />I have been a die  hard KISS fan since 1975.  The various breakups broke my heart.  I was so  excited for this disk to come out.  I like what Ace has done on his own and  thought that the original 4 could recapture the magic of the 70's.  I guess  it wasn't meant to happen.  What is with all of these 4 and 5 star reviews.   This disk is no better than Animalize or Asylum.  These disks were good in  the mid 80's but I wanted the best but I got the 80's instead.  They still  rule in my heart, but theyt need to come up with something that isn't  simply done for the money as this seems to be.<br />Bluestar
B00000AFHM|4.0|Like picking your nose, &quot;Arab Strap&quot; is kind of a guilty  pleasure; you feel sheepish diving in, but because of Strap's zany, catchy  sound you can't stop digging.  With a sound that recalls the  proto-&quot;goof rockers&quot; &quot;The Beautiful South,&quot; B&amp;S  flicks off some delightful aural nuggets; the last track on the album is  especially juicy.  This monument to &quot;Prance-Core&quot; is extremely  satisfying but is best listened to in private.
B000000ZGO|5.0|I bought this album because I had heard it was good and I'm fond of Funk.  However, when I had the chance to sit, chill, and listen to this album in  its desired environment, the only thing I could say after the eighteen  minutes of &quot;by the time I get to phoenix&quot; was WOW! This album  greatly exceeded my expectations, in fact it shattered them to pieces. From  the classic guitar riffs in &quot;Walk on By&quot; to the deep groves of  the seemingly meticulously planned string and horn sections of all four  songs, Hayes encompasses his talent into something yet to be paralled.      Everyone should hear this album at least once, and few should have a reason  to dislike it. It encompasses genres from funk, to classic rock, to soul,  to classical, and always leaving you wanting more.
B000002I97|5.0|When I was much younger, maybe eight or nine, growing up in the 80's was  enough to make me sick.  My father would often times play his guitar for me  and what he played was John Prine.  Now, almost nine years later, I find  myself playing John Prine with my father.  My father has few Prine CD's,  most of his albums are in vinyl form and we have no turntable.  So, I  recently bought Prines debut album and have played it constantly.  His  first album has been a true inspiration in my song, poetry, and prose  writing and will always be in my collection.
0345409671|5.0|When I read this Rice novel, I didn't expect much.  I thought the Vampire  Chronicles were going downhill, so I didn't even bother buying this one and  instead borrowed it.  Boy was I surprised!  This is the best book I've read  in ages, and it definitely made me think long and hard about what I  believed in.  If you're looking for a quick, light read, this is not what  you're looking for, but if you like to explore the extraordinary and enjoy  using your mind, pick this one up!
0345403959|1.0|The career of David Eddings is a perfect example of how commercial success can take an interesting, innovative, naturally talented author and turn them into a pulp-churning hack, forced to endlessly reinvent the same story for a public hungry for quantity... no matter that every story he's written has the same plot, the same characters, the same jokes and banter between characters.<br />The rot set in around half way through the Mallorean and Ellenium... he was producing both of these at the same time, and it became obvious he didn't really have any new ideas for either of them. I stuck with them though, right through to the Tamuli. When that clunking, awkward clone of the Ellenium finished, it was obvious he'd completely run out of ideas... yet I still purchased Belgarath... Surely he could do something decent by focusing on one of the more interesting characters he's created?  Unfortunately not. The whole book feels rushed, and Eddings's once fluid and enjoyable writing style now feels forced and unnatural.
B000002UKS|1.0|&quot;There goes my career, watch it as it goes!&quot; would probably be a  more telling refrain, as this weak-*ss tune seems to capture perfectly the  listless vapidity of modern rock and roll. I wonder which band members'  little brother wrote such lyrics or which art-school dropout would actually  confuse this for real music. This song makes commercial gingles sound like  Leanord Cohen lyrics in comparison. I feel that listening to this album has  actually made me a dumber(yes, dumber) human being. It filled a much-needed  void in my life.
0399143904|5.0|I enjoyed this book alot. Not as deep as many of Clancys other books but  still a very good read.  I liked reading about John Clark and the Op Center  type dealings.  Good book worth the price.
0399143904|5.0|Clancy shifts gears slightly and forgoes his usual hi-tech and  multi-character beginnings that are difficult to wade through.  Begins with  a bang right from the start and continues at breathtaking pace until the  very end.  It's really hard to find a place to put this book down.  <br />In  this book, Clancy brings back John Clark, CIA operative, and Ding Chavez,  Clarks long time side-kick.  Remember Clear and Present Danger?  Clark  heads up an anti-terrorist organization made up of multi-national  &quot;best of the best&quot; soldiers. They take you through breathtaking  plot after plot.  At the same time Clancy weaves the master plot  throughout.  <br />This is a truly gripping novel you will thoroughly enjoy.
0393307050|5.0|I've now read them all and can't wait for &quot;The Hundred Days&quot; to  print in paperback.  A combination of Jane Austin and C.S. Forester's  Hornblower Series.  Simply great!!
0440937582|5.0|I read this book about a year ago, but I just read it last month &amp;  every time I read it this book gets better. I like how Sir Arther Canyon  Doyle didn't just tell you who the murderer is, he just kind of led up t.  And both times I read this book I could not put it down. After reading it  the first time he inspired me to read other mysteries.  Sir Arther  Canyon Doyle must have been a genus to make up a plot like the one in this  book. It also must have been hard to make up a story with some fanasy &amp;  some mystery.
0441172717|5.0|You must not fear either, to read Dune that is. It is a wonderful,  well-written tale and was and is very innovative and draws the reader into  the story. The detailed background of each place and character just deepens  the sense of reality gained by this knowledgeable book. My favorite!
0679441018|5.0|As my first foray into Anne Rice's world of the vampires, I can say  honestly how astounded I was with Memnoch. <br />The novel is absolutely  breath-taking in its scale, the colours it provokes, and the variety of the  characters you conjur in your imagination. <br />I recommend this book to  anyone who can read - it really is that good. There seems to be a lot of  negative reviews of this book, but maybe they didn't quite catch the  hook?<br />My only wish is that I had read the other chronicles before this,  but c'est la vie.
0517591812|4.0|This is the type of book for those of us who feel we didn't listen well  enough to our history professors and now wishes we had. London gives you an  amazing view of England with politics, religion, culture, family and sex  thrown in. It keeps you involved with the different characters who weave  through the 2,000 years and makes me want to read more of his work.
B000002C1X|5.0|The Wall is the Floyd's greatest work, definitely. I am known as Kefka  Floyd on the internet, because of my obsession with pink Floyd. If you have  seen the movie, you will really understand what The Wall is about. The main  character, aptly named Pink Floyd, is driven to insanity behind his  &quot;wall,&quot; a protective barrier that keeps him isolated from the  real world. This wall is built of &quot;bricks&quot; of his past, such as  his father's death in WWII, His overprotective mother, the forced  conformity of his education, and his older life of Sex, Drugs, and  Rock'n'roll. The album itself is very vague, but if you watch the film, it  all comes out in plain daylight. Pink's younger life is loosely based on  Roger Waters, and his adult life on Syd Barrett. I highly recommend this  album to any serious music listener. Some songs may confuse you, but it is  a great investment.
B000000W5L|5.0|What an album! Fantastically portrayed by those ministers of the  theatrical, the Rolling Stones. Every song like taking another sip out of a  bottle of fine chianti. This album takes upon itslef a beautifully  landscaped shape from the first pulchritudinous track. An absolute delight  for each one of the five sacred senses of the sultry, fiendish human body.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I have heard some of the songs of this cd and it is great! All of the  songs are like something you never heard before. Jagged Little Pill sold 28  million copies worldwide and is still climbing. This is going to be great.
B000002UAO|5.0|This is a full, chunky album with many deft grooves. It touches the human  psyche on many consistently wavy levels. The lyrics are positvely  replenished by the throaty vocals the band provides. I put this near the  topof what I call my &quot;Utmost Chart&quot;. One of the best Beatles  albums.
B000002UB3|1.0|There is not one good song on this album. &quot;Come Together&quot; is  silly. &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; is childish. The songs that run  together on side 2 are just pure drivel. &quot;i Want You&quot; might be  the worst song I've ever heard. The two most listenible songs are by  Harrison. That should tell you something. This album makes me vomit.
B000002Q7Y|3.0|...and volume. Power is the first release of a mid-80's reconstitution of  Kansas, featuring the return of lead vocalist Steve Walsh along with  stalwarts Phil Ehart (drums) and Rich Williams (guitars). The original  Kansans are joined by guitar god Steve Morse (Dixie Dregs) and Walsh's  Streets compadre Billy Greer on bass.<br />Power is a fairly straightforward  rock album, with none of the epic-length (or quality) material from the  band's heyday, and serves to illustrate why the value of a band's  songwriting team is almost always larger than the sum of its individual  parts. Without the more melodic and introspective presence of former Kansas  songwriter (and keyboardist, and guitarist...) Kerry Livgren, the balance  is skewed heavily toward Walsh's feverish, hell-bent-for-leather  tendencies, and while the results are certainly better than average, there  aren't any real standouts here. Giving Walsh his due, however, he was in  fine voice at this time, and Silhouettes in Disguise, Power (featuring nice  backup vocals from Greer) and Three Pretenders are pretty good, and he  shows some nice range on Taking In the View and Can't Cry  Anymore.<br />Ultimately, Walsh's voice carries this above your average, say,  Foreigner album, but you'd've thunk that combining Kansas and the Dixie  Dregs would have produced something a lot more interesting.
0425152251|1.0|Cheap, boring and simplistic. The story never gets going, the treatment of  the philosophers is as fun as a textbook on computer science.
B00000DBXL|4.0|I've been listening to and enjoying Cake since &quot;Motorcade of  Generosity&quot;, and when I saw &quot;Prolonging the Magic&quot; at the  store I picked it right up. When I popped it in, however, I was a tad  disppointed by the first two tracks, which seemed a tad on the sappy side  IMHO. After that, though, things got going and the rest of the album  doesn't disppoint.<br />Cake's sound has definitely matured over the last year  or so, and this album reflects it. A good solid release from a great band.
B000005843|5.0|Bolt Throwers music can be categorised as war metal.And you will get it  when you listen to it!  The drums are perfect(very fast sometimes), but the  best thing about the album(in fact all their albums) is the guitar solos.  They are just cool ,and really good performed. And i have listen to a few  guitar solos over the years! The riffs are very good ,and you kinda  &quot;got it in your head&quot; the very first time you listen to them.  There are just four tracks on this recording ,but it's definitly worth the  money. &quot;Armageddon Bounded&quot; is perhaps their best song ever.Check  it out! Bolt Thrower is maybe not the hardest band around ,but damn it,  they are the best!
B000005K9N|5.0|If you have never heard John Lennon's music this C.D will open your eyes  to another frame of mind. This some of John's best work , apart from the  beatles. This should have been done a long time ago, It's too bad that John  Lennon is'nt here to enjoy it with us.
B000001FDI|2.0|Six songs including one which badly overstays its welcome do not make a  classic album. However, Presence Of The Lord is one classic piece with one  of the best guitar solos of Eric Clapton's career.  Can't Find My Way Home  and Sea Of Joy are two other nice understated pieces.  However, there is  way too much limited material for this record to be worth anyhing more than  a bargain bin purchase!
B0000025BL|5.0|This is to anyone who has never heard Meatloaf and may be discouraged by  any bad reviews. Although I am personally too young to remember the  seventies, I can say with certainty that everyone at least heard Meat's  work. This album was aimed at young listeners, and no one has good taste  when they're young. Meat sings like a Broadway performer, and the  compostions lend themselves exellently to his rendering. The world needs  more piano rock like Steinman's. The songs still ring true with modern  teenage experiance, and so I recommend this album not only for nostlgia,  but for modern audiences as well. I like it, but you have to make up your  own mind.
B000000XCA|4.0|The second album by Creedence Clearwater Revival definitely opened the  eyes of the music world to this fine band.  John Fogerty's song-writing  abilities took a big leap forward with such classic as Proud Mary,  Penthouse Pauper, and Born On The Bayou.  The rhythm section of Stu Cook  and Doug Clifford provide solid support.  Only seven songs make this mildly  incomplete but the quality is top notch.
B000002J09|5.0|This is quite possibly Led's greatest album ever. If you are going to buy  one disc all year this should be the one. The music contained sets a  peculiar mood, one almost of a fantasy, particularly Misty Mountian Hop.   (Tolkien Readers can relate).
B00000AFGM|4.0|Manson's Pub is one of a kind and so is his new CD.  It is different from  the older stuff, a new sound a little mellower.  It is worth purchasing.
006016848X|5.0|It was a delightful, honest book.  I've read it several times;  each time  I read it, I cry.  There's so much to learn;  every page, there's a new  insight.  Even my once-skeptical boyfriend is reading it and is amazed at  the difference it has been making in our relationship.<br />I wish I could  thank John Gray myself!  His book has opened our minds and our hearts, and  it has fostered an even stronger love between us.  All the things that we  couldn't understand that caused us so much frustration are no longer  tearing us apart.  Even if you're single, you'll be amazed at the insight  of this book.<br />Reading the negative reviews, I don't agree with their  conclusions.  If they took the time to read the book back to front with an  open mind, weren't so blatently resentful towards men, and stopped to  realize that it isn't sexist, but rather an honest appreciation for the  differences between men and women, then maybe they'd be able to benefit  from this wonderful book as most of us have.
B000002LUB|4.0|After having been a Sabbath fan all my life since the (then newly  released) Paranoid, I must say that this is at least worth listening to for  the Iommi riffs alone. Geezer's bass in in top form but Ronnie's vocals  have gotten away from being melodic and have gotten too edgy. Saw this tour  live in Tampa Fla. and was kind of disappointed. The opening band, Danzig,  kind of upstaged them. Let alone the SORRY mistake of allowing an EXTREMELY  poor drummer like Vinnie Appice back into the fold... I mean, gosh, I could  play better. Would have had more meaning to me to hear Bill play these  tracks as he would have done it with much more style and talent. Oh well..  The opening crunch of &quot;Computer God&quot; has to make you beg for  mercy on your knees ! It's also too bad that Ronnie has forgotten to croon  softly. Does anyone remember &quot;Rainbow Eyes&quot; from &quot;Long live  Rock and Roll&quot; ? That was great stuff. Sabbath used to have a more  well rounded album experience when they offered softer tracks along with  the crunchers. Showed their creative and sensitive sides. Worth a listen,  though.
B000000OQ5|5.0|By far this is Tesla's greatest!!! Even if you've never heard of the band,  this album is a MUST HAVE ROCK ALBUM.  Album contimously flows from song to  song without disapointment.
B000002B7M|5.0|I read one review that this was &quot;the best heavy metal album of all  time&quot;.  Well, no.. there certainly were better albums. But this one,  as all first albums will forever have a place in my heart. It was  unbelievably creative and you could tell that this lineup gelled. Randy was  out to prove himself and most certainly did. Can't get much better bass  playing than Bob Daisley. And when I picked up the album and found one of  my favorite all-time drummers Lee Kerslake, of ex-Uriah Heep fame, well,  you've got one hell of a collaboration.<br />Being a major Sabbath fan since  '72, I was thrilled to see Oz out on his own. You can always tell the first  album by an artist.. its always the best. (Although &quot;Diary Of A  Madman&quot; was good too). After that, forget it. Only one song I heard  from Ozzy came close to those first albums and that was &quot;Waiting For  Darkness&quot;, the host album of which I cannot even remember the name  of....
0345403959|5.0|Belgarath was a great book.  I truly explained the story behind Belgarion,  Polgara, and Belgarath. It explained where things came from and it also  gave you a better perspective of Belgarath. David Eddings is an excellent  author who should add to  this grand adventure!!!
B000005RFQ|3.0|I REALLY looked forward to the potential of hearing one very excellent  lead singer, Ian Gillan have a chance of complimenting my Sab. Didn't  happen. Ian seemed to do nothing but scream and the song writing and  production were poor. Too many lineup changes (nothing to do with Iommi's  ego, I'm sure...) but it is worth a listen. When you compare the power and  presence of Gillan's vocals on &quot;Made In Japan&quot; to his screaming  on this album, you're kind of LET DOWN.
B000009PNY|5.0|When first announced, this album was to contain a remake of &quot;Personal  Jesus,&quot; by Trent Reznor(Nine Inch Nails).  I guess Trent decided to  focus more on his new album and so the song never made it.  Too bad I  though that would have rocked, but other great bands pull through and make  this a good album. Damn Dan
B000002A3T|2.0|Gilmour tries to keep the machine going. And quite successfully if you  look at the money income. Not so, if you want some music. :-( This album is  endless boredom. The only good parts are the first few minutes and the only  song Gilmour sis let out of his hands. Wright's &quot;Wearing The Inside  Out&quot; is really a piece of good work. I'm not the only one who dial 6  soon after he inserted the disc and shut it down after that song is over.
0380002930|5.0|Richard Adams must have had quite a fun time writing the adventures of  this merry band of rabbits lead by a rabbit called Hazel. He not only made  a book which is practically 99,5% populated by animals only, but he also  developed the so-called &quot;Lapine dialect&quot; and a whole foundation  ground of legends and mysticism in their world, with the daring tales of  their folk hero El-ahrairah, as recollected by the storytelling rabbit of  the lot, Dandelion. Its a magical book, for kids of all ages. Well  recommended!
0453008097|5.0|After about five minutes, you will forget that the only voice you are hearing is Emma. The characters comes alive as the story begins. You can feel the tension as the aunt argues with Margaret. And the relief when Margaret decides to stay home with her sick brother. The Brits know how to do this stuff.
B000001Y5J|5.0|This is the Nine Inch Nails loudest albums. Trent Reznor decided to take a  different approach then his first album, Pretty Hate Machine. He wanted to  prove to the world that he could rock, and boy can he. The songs on this CD  are loud, harsh, and make for some great moshing. The only that I don't  like is that it ended too soon. Then again, all good things must come to an  end.....
0393038912|2.0|Other hypotheses for the movements of power and civilization include:  <br />1. The English language is better suited to wise political discourse,  wise government, wise economic choices  Where the English have gone,  civilization has advanced. Why?  Is  there a survival value in our syntax?   Possibly. Good politics and good business need good interpersonal and  written communication<br />2. Aquatic life has a subtle preference for   swimming against the current, i.e. swimming \\"upstream\\". . The water strider  insects on my pond swim  against the pond currents,  for no evident  survival reason. There may be within human beings a subtle reptilian urge  to  swim up stream, against the prevailing air currents. The dominant wind  in both the Northern and Southern hemisphere are from the West. Our eyes  turn this way. This may at first seem facetious, but is not . I could write  a book such as Diamond's \\"proving\\" this conjecture.
0399143904|4.0|Clancy has improved from recent books that had more brain-numbing detail  than action. This book has some shortcomings, and the author's photo on the  back of the book is sickening, but the story allows Clancy to insert sudden  action-filled chapters that keep you moving. His best offering since  Cardinal.
B000002TP7|5.0|I grew up listening to hard core punk.  And one of the bands that I  remember playing at CBGB'S was the Beastie Boys with one of the girls from  Luscious Jackson backing them on drums.  They kicked ass then and they  still kick ass today!!!  One of the reasons why I listen to the Beastie's  is because they bridge that gap between rock and rap.  And they are  one of  the ones next to Rage Against the Machine Etc... who do it the best!!!
B000002UZ1|5.0|Disregard the naysayers on the blue album. It is true these songs are only  part of the great work The Beatles did, but what songs they are, and the  sound quality is noticably better than the other CD releases (at least the  ones that I have), particularly on I Am The Walrus, which sounds off speed  on the Magical Mystery Tour CD, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps, whose  abrasive chiming threatened to crack my speakers on the White Album  CD...both sound perfect here. And the guitar intro to A Day In The Life  (simply the greatest rock song ever) is isolated here, unlike on Sgt.  Pepper's, which helps it weave even more of a spell.
1563890119|5.0|Neil Gaiman, has taken a simple idea and turned it into the best commic  book series ever.  It opens ones mind to facets and thoughts one could only  dream about.(did not mean to make a pun) I can only say this if you buy  this book it won't stop here you will be pulled into the Sandman's Relm and  unable to escape until you have read all the books a few times.  Enjoy!!!!
B000002UA9|5.0|&quot;One two three four - well she was just seventeen, and you know what  I mean...&quot;. With this line, the most important recording adventure in  the history of rock and pop music was boldly launched. THe album, *Please  Please Me* stands at the beginning of the Beatles recording catalog, and  for that reason alone it merits our attention. However, even if the Beatles  ended their recording career right here and went back to performing at  small venues, they would have left an indelible mark on the history of rock  and roll.       This album, recorded in less than a day, could not be made  today. No teen-age angst, no posing or posturing, no stretching for social  relevance or self-justification, the world's newest and eventually greatest  rock band exude an ebullient optimism and joy of music that no band then or  now was able to convey with as much success or sincerity. The Beatles  joyful, playful, creatively brilliant but personally contained approach is  evident right here, an approach that would sustain them through six years  of endless and intense creative innovation. THe same spirit of joy and play  that we hear on &quot;Her Majesty,&quot; the last cut on their last album  (&quot;Abbey Road&quot;) is present in that line &quot;you know what I  mean,&quot; or in the whole mood of a song like &quot;P.S. I Love  You.&quot; The Beatles as artists changed more than any group on record and  in so doing helped to change civilization itself, but through all the  changes they remained exactly the same as performers - sincerely believing  in the promise of music as a way to a happier and simpler life, not taking  themselves too seriously while seriously loving the music they composed and  played without letting themselves become encumbered by narrow ego. Lesser  groups with more ambitious (but not nearly as substantial) artistic  aspirations (or pretensions in some cases) could learn a lesson from the  Beatles own humility in their approach to their music. Musically, *Please  Please Me* is a deftly produced mix of the Beatles as bright new composers  and as expert interpreters of tastefully selected standards. The stand-out  covers are as good as the new songs. &quot;Twist and Shout,&quot; surpasses  the Isley Brothers already amazing original - Lennon offers one of rock  history's most incredible vocal performances, supported by expertly timed  backing from Paul and George. Harrison's guitar work is artfully simple as  rock should be, and the entire band mesh perfectly on a track that was  recorded in just one take. &quot;Baby It's You,&quot; another cover, once  again demonstrates the emotive power of Lennon's vocal work. I tell my  daughter that if she ever wants to learn how to sing a song, she should  listen carefully to the John Lennon sings &quot;Baby It's You.&quot;  The  covers are complimented by the first set of Beatles originals - the best of  which is &quot;I Saw Her Standing There.&quot; Here it is Paul who turns in  a magnificent lead vocal, backed by the perfectly matched Lennon harmony.  This, the first song on a Beatles album, is one of their greatest. It is an  archetype of the rock form - fast driving beat impeccably led by Ringo,  energetic guitar work from both the lead and rhythm, quick and confident  bass work from the Paul, and youthfully assertive vocals driven without  apology or doubt and tightly wrapped around a very simple lyric that says  what it wants to say by not really saying it at all. In leaving the main  point unspoken, the Beatles already demonstrate a grace and subtle humor  that reveals both their perfect musical instincts as well as their  remarkable intelligence. No one writes this well today, and this is only an  early example of the Beatles just BEGINNING to learn their art. They would  do so much more in the few years they were together while placing light  years between themselves and everybody else. And here, we already have in  their first album cut, a masterpiece of pure rock and roll, a model for the  whole style and a song for rock purists everywhere to emulate(in this way  &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; is in the same category as &quot;You  Really Got Me&quot; by the Kinks, &quot;Satisfaction&quot; by the Rolling  Stones, and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; by Chuck Berry - all examples of  brilliant rock and roll at its purest and simplest level and all equally  great). &quot;Please PLease Me,&quot; there first number one hit, is just  as good, and together these two songs push rock forward and provide the  first underpinnings of a whole new generation of sound. A third Lennon and  McCartney original (or as the credits state, McCartney and Lennon)  &quot;There's A Place&quot; provides a feint hint of the Beatles  introspective abilities - introspection without self-absorption, inner  longing that is untainted by self-doubt, deception, or self-torture. As  early as this innocent song, recorded in the beginning of 1963, the Beatles  were already telling us in the clearest terms that the mind is where it's  at. (&quot;There's a place, where I can go,when I feel low, when I feel  blue; and it's my MIND, and there's no time, for feeling down.&quot;)  Again, while the Beatles would dramatically change as artist and mature as  individuals, their basic philosophy of life - which would add layers of  sophistication and intelligent articulation later - remained essentially  the same: embrace life, love what you are doing, keep an abiding sense of  humor and playful self-effacement,nothing is so important as to defeat you,  and above all realize that everything -everything - &quot;is just a state  of mind&quot; (as they would later sing in &quot;Rain,&quot; three years  and one galaxy later). They had a long way to go before they could express  this sensibility in word and song, but the feeling of it is already here,  in their simplest work - their debut album.
B000002OMN|5.0|I got this CD in March 1994, and since that day Ive listened to it almost  daily, and it keeps getting better all the time. My favourite songs are  &quot;I would do anything for love&quot;, &quot;Objects in the rear view  mirror&quot; (the best lyrics I know),and &quot;Life is a lemon&quot;. 10  stars wouldnt be enough....
1564428117|5.0|When I first saw halloween it scared me to death.  I was amazed how by  through the use of light contrast and music, a movie could terrify someone  without having to use slasher gimmicks.  As far as I'm concerned it's the  greatest horror film ever made.  END
0780622553|5.0|Well, the movie left me speechless.  Not only a riveting story with  gorgeous sets and direction, it touched parts of my subconscious that I  didn't know were there.  I would, however, warn that I have a particular  fondness for mind-power and artificial world themes as well as the  unearthly beauty that Alex Proyas has so deftly given us in such movies as  _The Crow_.<br />That being said, the DVD (vs. tape) purchase is worth a look  if you want background on the movie and the players involved, with a nice  UI in the darkly beautiful style of the movie.  The DVD also includes a  &quot;game&quot; of finding Shell Beach but I have found that this is  nearly unplayable.  Oh well, everything else was wonderful.     END
0385484518|5.0|This is the best book that I have read in a long time.  It is filled with  many lessons for us all and gives us a sensitive insight into the process  of dying for someone as wise as Morrie.  The world would be a much better  place to be if we all would take to heart the message that Morrie was  giving us.  I would love to buy this book for every person that I love and  care about and share a beautiful tribute to a wonderful man and teacher.
B000001EMW|5.0|I can't tell you how great this CD is.  For all Metallica fans, who  sometimes want or need to have dinner music  but can't stand classical  music.  This is the CD for you. You will find yourself humming and singing  along but you will truly be enjoying the music.  If you like Metallica and  you enjoy music I highly recommend this CD
0517122707|5.0|Vividly drawn characters of the lower class locals in New Orleans, LA  don't stand a chance against the gargantuan size, wit and appetites of  Mr.Ignatius J. Reilly. He's a comically tragic man/child who lives life  with mother in repulsively breathtaking self-absorbed abandon.  His days  are spent ralling against ALL offenses to his reason (real or imagined).   Results range silly to serious and are every bit as offensive as Mr. Reilly  himself. The ending is a cliff-hanging surprise (in tune with the  unpredictability of the characters) leaving the reader wanting for more.  <br />THIS IS A MUST READ. Rarely does anything come along that so richly  deserves the description &quot;unique.&quot;
038542471X|4.0|This tale of young Mark Sway is gripping to the very end. Grisham has a  writing style that begs you to continue reading. However, the book lacks a  great deal of realism. A eleven year old child outfoxing the most brilliant  minds working in the govt. is kind of hard to swallow. But then again, a  realistic plot wouldn't make much sense.
B000005JA8|5.0|I was the only kid I knew who liked Beefheart before this album I was the  only kid I knew who liked Beefheart after this album.  All my friends  borrwowed it, but none of them could get through all 4 sides.  I have  listened to this album on a regular basis throughout the 29 years since its  release.<br />I guess if I was listening to it now for the first time it would  not be so 'difficult'.  After all a lot of what is on it has been echoed by  other artists.  This record opened up areas for investigation by other  artists.  Others may have followed but Beefheart got there first.  This is  one of those very rare things, a truely seminal record.
0316779989|5.0|This book was my first introduction to Mr. Sedaris, and I know that I will  be reading more from him - soon. His wit is extremely sharp, and  entertainingly cynical. He uses the language of that intelligent class  clown that made everyone laugh in school, including the teacher. Further,  his writing is as frank, honest and comfortable as a letter from a close  friend. This book treads the common ground that most readers can easily  identify and find much humor with. From the brazen condemnation expressed  in &quot;Front Row Center&quot;, to the satirical, if not sarcastic  &quot;swiftian&quot; essay entitled &quot;christmas is for giving&quot;,  Sedaris keeps his reader's face suspended in a grin puncuated with out loud  knee slapping laughter.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is the best produced album Pearl Jam has ever put out. It doesn't  have that one or two blockbuster songs such as Jeremy, but from top to  bottom this album has quality songs. My personal favorite is In Hiding but  there are many other great ones such as Wishlist, Given to Fly and Pilate.  I think one thing that makes this album so good is that all the guys were  involved in the songwriting with Eddie then putting down the lyrics. If you  didn't like it the first time you listened to it that's a good sign. Keep  at it and it will grow on you. Music that takes a little getting used to  usually ends up being liked for years to come. The simple tunes that you  like right away sometimes get tired fast. Yield will go down as one of my  favorite albums and definitely my favorite Pearl Jam album, although my  favorite Pearl Jam song doesn't reside on this album. Happy listening.
B000002KHF|5.0|This album never grows old.  All the songs are gems, but  &quot;Moondance&quot; is quite possibly the most mature and beautifully  expressive song ever made about sexual love. Listen and dream.
B000001GK9|5.0|I write about music, including Mahler, for American Record Guide and have  known this music for more than 30 years. Yet, when I heard this recording,  it was like hearing the piece for the first time. Karajan gets the spirit  and life of this symphony onto discs like nobody before or since. The  playing -- though not note-perfect, it was recorded in concert -- is full  of intensity and beauty and the range of the piece is all there, from the  halting exploration of the opening, through the wit and nostalgia of the  second movement and the biting fury of the third. The finale, though, is  the jewel of the performance, gorgeous and heartfelt with a fiery bridge  into the closing pages, played here with a transfigured peace and deep love  and optimism instead of the pathos or sentimentality of lesser  performances. If you think of Mahler as a Woody Allen composer, weak and  vulnerable and passive, this is not the reading for you, but if you see him  as a strong, sensitive, but heroic creator, don't miss this recording.
0345350499|3.0|I began the book very interested in the alternative approach to the  Aurthurian legend, and appreciative of the intricate cosmology offered by  the author. By the middle of the book, however, I became disgusted by the  whining nature of all of the main characters. This is billed as &quot;The  Aurthurian legend from the women's point of view.&quot; But it suggests  that the major influence on women and their view of the world is whether or  not they are pregnant, when they are pregnant, who is sleeping with who,  and other Oprah-related topics. All of the women in the book were strong,  each in her own way, and yet at the same time  the major motivation for  each was petty and mean-spirited. By the end of the novel, I was distinctly  unimpressed.
B000003493|4.0|Update:  Rejoice!  The original Nuggets album is back as part of a box  set!  It does exactly what I wanted:  It leaves the original album intact  as the first CD, then expands on the theme with THREE MORE (count 'em) CDs  of great stuff.  For anyone that remembers BFD Records' &quot;Pebbles&quot;  series of cheaply-made vinyl albums that was obviously inspired by  &quot;Nuggets,&quot;  some of those classics are in the box set too, like  the great &quot;Going All The Way&quot; by the Squires.  Forget this little  album and check out the box set instead!!
0393312836|5.0|What a brilliant masterpiece Anthony Burgess created here. A Clockwork  Orange is a chilling version of what Burgess saw as the not so distant  future. He wrote the book during the time when doctors wrongfully diagnosed  him with cancer, in 1962. He lived until 1993, and with him died the  mystery and the majesty that is A Clockwork Orange.
B0000070QS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites!  Wild Seed is Morten Harket's only  solo  album in english to date and judging  from this, we can only pray he  will do  more in the future. His voice will make  you melt, the music -  soothe your soul.  There is just something for everyone on  this.  You  cannot listen to this and not  fall in love. Amazing, beautiful,  serious,  light hearted, touching, ,,it  runs the whole gammit of emotions. He  has  got one of the best voices ever!  Morten Harket please do not give up your   day job! I love Wild Seed!
0684833395|5.0|There is no author that can write a book as compelling both comically and  dramatically as Joseph Heller does with Catch-22. The pop-culture,  counterculture classic reflects the down and out 1960's through WWII. The  look of the world through Yossarian's eyes is hillarious at first, but at  second thought-sad. The fact that he believes everyone is plotting to kill  him reflects the horror of war. If you do decide to read it, beware. It  starts of with a rocket, and the first 100 pages are the funniest of the  book. After that, it slows down in the middle, and is a lot more meaninful.  But around the 220s the book gets going again and countinues to be funny  and horrific. The passage of with Snowden, especially. Bravo Mr. Heller.
B000002L9J|5.0|This album is probably the best place to start for the Smiths-uninitiated.   Comprised of the perfect combination of self-indulgent melancholy and  garish playfulness for which they have become famous, The Queen Is Dead  shows off the Smiths' for the expert musicians that they were.  Johnny  Marr's melodic riffs are a foil for Morrissey's woeful and biting lyrics.   Whether on a long car trip or just half-dozing in a darkened room, this  album fits--and often dictates--the mood.  I have listened to it regularly  for a decade and it has never become tiresome.  That in itself sets it  apart from its more contemporary competition.
B00000AFFF|5.0|this is, without hesitation, the most beautiful pop music i have heard  since queen's a night at the opera. no wall of distortion. no screaming. no  profanity. just gorgeous melodies.  gorgeous arrangements. i can barely  wait for a follow-up. the world can't handle something this good
079073639X|2.0|This movie starts off with an extremely fascinating plot: a vessel has  been located 1000 feet down on the ocean floor; its very large - a fin  alone is 100 feet tall; it has a perfect sphere inside. <br />These items  alone would give any competent film-maker the necessary material for a very  good movie.  Not-so the makers of Sphere.<br />A great deal of the movie is  spent dazzling the viewer with very good special-effects.  An equal amount  of time should have been spent including many of the dialogues, from  Crichton's book, the crew has with the alien intelligence. As it is, the  movie does drag. As compensation, of a sort, I did learn a lot about the  toxic properties of marine life on the ocean floor, and thats worth  something!<br />The DVD picture is beautifully clear, and the 6 (uh...5.1)  channels of digital sound will put your home-theater system, and your  neighbors, through their paces.<br />For a Science-fiction fanatic like myself  it was okay. It should have been Great!!     END

Hey, even someone as cool as Batman can get impatient and make mistakes. This story also revolves around Commissioner Gordon before he became comissioner... back when he was a cop.  Both Batman and Gordon are bad-a**, crime-fighting rookies who become legendary heros.  Read!
B000002UWF|5.0|I didn't know any of Louis Prima's work until I heard the Gap commercial.   The music was so great that I had to fine out who the artist was.  Once I  found out, I began searching for the right CD to add to my collection of  Big Band and Swing stuff. This CD fit the bill and it has not dissapointed.  I love every cut.  Louis and Keely are perfect together and Sam Butera and  the Witnesses can really swing.  Don't miss out on some hot sounds.
0790734850|5.0|This film is a work of art. It brings back the true noir of Hollywood. It  was based on the book by James Ellroy which he wrote so it could not be  made into a film. Helgeland and Hanson changed that around. A marvelous  spell-binding mystery that keeps you guessing to the final pay off. I loved  it!!     END
B000002HAF|5.0|Various alternative-indie rock bands can be said to be the band that paved  the way for what we now call &quot;modern rock&quot;.  The one band that  stands out from all the rest however, is the Pixies.  Each and every Pixies  album has its own feel to it.  Yet each and everyone could be nothing more  than the Pixies.  From the guitar work to the distinct vocals of Black  Francis, there is no imitation.    Many people say Nirvana broke  alternative rock by injecting &quot;grunge&quot; into the vein of  mainstream America.  Yet if it wasn't for the Pixies, Nirvana never would  of found that sound.  The Pixies can be heard all over the radio today, of  course it isn't the pixies that we are hearing.  Its bands like Better Than  Ezra, who you know were listneing to Doolittle when they wrote songs like  &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;Rosalynna&quot;.    Of course, this isn't a  review about what Pixies did for alt-rock.  This is a review about the  defining Pixies album.  Surfer Rosa.  While it is hard for a Pixies fan to  choose which is the best Pixies album, everyone has there own, and  the  Pixies wouldn't be the Pixies without there varying styles from album to  album.  Surfer Rosa is the one that defines them in completion.  Doolittle  may be the one that gave them that small spotlight that they have recieved.   Doolittle, the user friendly Pixies album.  Surfer Rosa is Pixies from  there core.  In all there rawness.  Sure you have &quot;Come On,  Pilgrim&quot; but if &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; never existed, the Pixies  would have been a failed experiment.  &quot;Come On, Pilgrim&quot; would  have just been a little release that got a smidge of college airplay, been  held highly in the hearts of the few people whose path it crossed and  faded.  &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; made it a totally credible Pixies album.   Made the Pixies a viable true to the heart indie band.  &quot;Surfer  Rosa&quot; is a must have for anyone who felt &quot;Doolittle&quot; in  there soul.  For anyone who looked beyond &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot;.   There are so many complete Pixies tracks on this album.  Yes, of course  &quot;Gigantic&quot;, but let's not over look &quot;Where Is My  Mind?&quot;, &quot;Cactus&quot;, and David Grohls favirote &quot;Tony's  Theme&quot;.    So I guess this isn't a credible review of a single  album.  But you have to understand, my love for the Pixies runs so deep, I  can't seperate the albums.  They are all one, a part of there short lived  history.  A history that came to a close at just the right time.  Right  before the Pixies could become &quot;just another modern rock band&quot;.   Their career was laid out perfectly and I hope a reunion never happens.
B000002UAX|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite Beatles album (after Abby Road of course)...  it has a wonderful variety of music, and once again prooves the versitility  of this incredible band! There is no other group like them, and there NEVER  will be!<br />If you haven't added this album to your collection, you should  definitely do so!
B000001FSP|2.0|I'm a big fan of Marianne's...but I was really disappointed when I  purchased this record... I would rather recommend &lt;20th Century  Ballad&gt; It's much better - you will see her maturity. This &lt;Broken  English&gt; is Broken piece of her fame. ;)
B000002KIE|5.0|&quot;Never mind the bollocks,here's the sex pistols&quot; is a punk  masterpiece!

630416923X|5.0|This 10-hour series is truly epic. If you're a Beatles fan, you should  just bite the bullet and order this before it's no longer available. It has  videos for Rain, Paperback Writer, Strawberry Fields Forever, Penny Lane,  Lady Madonna, and tons of other great songs, plus incredible live footage.  My personal favorite is &quot;Revolution&quot; from the David Frost Show.  And it's at least twice the length of the TV version.     END
B000002AEN|5.0|It was on the basis of these recordings that blues collectors in the '60's  made an attempt to &quot;rediscover&quot; Hurt. They found him by using the  lyrics to &quot;Avalon Blues,&quot; (&quot;Avalon's my home town, always on  my mind.&quot;)        They dug up an old road map, went to where  Avalon should have been and asked around at the first gas station they  found. Amazingly, the attendant pointed them up the road, where Hurt was  sitting on his porch as if waiting for them!       Even had they  not found him, these legendary sides would have been enough to secure his  place in blues history. They are some of the most hauntingly beautiful and  unique recordings in all blues.       Hurt sang of surprisingly  violent and frank subjects in a disarmingly tender voice, coupled with an  amazing technical mastery of guitar(there is a story that Segovia, upon  hearing these recordings, couldn't believe that Hurt was not playing with  anouther guitarist.)<br /> This music will stay with you and is often quite  moving and original, since it combines blues with elements and playing  styes normally associated with &quot;folk,&quot; due to the fact that Hurt  hardly ever left Avalon and so was isolated from the &quot;mainstream&quot;  Delta styles. There is a sort of spiritual calm and hard-won wisdom  reflected in Hurt's music and there is nothing else quite like it in all of  American music.
B000002UEB|5.0|This is by far one of the all time greats.  THis was queensryche's  breakthrough album that put them not only on the map but also into music  history.  It's best described as a cross between Iron Maiden and Pink  Floyd.  This is a must have for any rock or metal fan.  By far the best  Queens.. album of em all. (empire's not half bad though) Well worth your  hard earned cash!!
B000000W5P|2.0|This record is extremely overrated.  First of all, at least five songs are  written in the same key and have similar rhythms.  Second, the singles Miss  You and Beast Of Burden are cheesy pop/disco oriented songs that are overly  repetitive that are not appropriate for the Stones style.  Respectable,  Before They Make Me Run, and the Title Track are good songs and Far Away  Eyes is OK but the rest of the material is just dissapointing.
B0000062S0|4.0|Page &amp; Plant live and write songs for today, and don't pretend they  are back in the good old LZ days. I like the fact that they are artists  doing what pleases them and don't seem to particularly care about  recreating the megaselling LZ days.  Plant is in fine voice, Page plays the  atmospheric shadings and brutal crunch that will feel good to LZ lovers,  and best of all, the songs are almost all very good. Most likely you bought  this as soon as it came out, or never intend to get it, so reviews won't  matter much. But if you're of a mind to give it a chance, you'll hear some  good music by 2 guys who are masters at what they do. I'm glad they are  still at it.
B000002LEE|5.0|This is by far Jane's best work yet. Although Ritual de lo Habitual may  slightly edge out this album musically, it is really too close to call. The  one element that makes this album supreme is the lyrical and emotional  content. Perry Farrell is at his absolute best content-wise and in his  delivery of these incredible songs. The varying grooves on this album keep  you guessing, which is what Perry does best. As for the instrumentals, they  are absolutely soaring. The music literally takes you into another world  atmospherically. Jane does this like no other band...ever. As for Dave  Navarro, what can I say? He is simply the best around. Nothing's Shocking  is Jane's best work.
B000003TA4|5.0|Neil Young was right when he said that the 90's are the new renaissance of  rock and roll (or something to that effect).  What brought me back to even  bothering with non-jazz music was hearing Nirvana performing Heart-Shaped  Box on SNL. From there it was just a short step to finding Nevermind.  Cobain was very simply a genius. This recording is simply one of the best  ten of the nineties no matter what happens in the next 14 1/2 months.  &quot;Music Saves&quot; - Verve

0446347949|5.0|I discovered this book in 1994 and it changed my business life.  It opened  my eyes to a facet of marketing that is too often overlooked, and it's the  most important facet.  Positioning is more than branding, it's the key to  success.  Luckily, most companies don't do proper positioning, which is why  there's always room for new companies to start up, get it right, and be  very successful.<br />If you don't read this book, you're chances at success  are like everyone elses:  1 in 10.  Read and learn positioning, and the  odds are with you.  Simple as that.
B000002BQK|1.0|this album was a terrible dissapointment!!!!!!! i liked daydream, so i  thought this might be good, but it was boring, and she had to many songs  that she sang with rap singers, if i could i'd give this zero  stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000001EGA|5.0|I'd always thought &quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road&quot; HAD to be Elton's  best album until I heard &quot;Captain Fantastic.&quot;  While the former's  track listing reads like a greatest hits package, it is the latter that  will make you reach for that &quot;repeat disc&quot; button on your player.   From start to finish, &quot;Captain Fantastic&quot; is as solid an album  as anyone can make.  Autobiographical in nature, it captured both Elton  John and Bernie Taupin at their best, as illustrated by the songs  &quot;Meal Ticket,&quot; &quot;Writing,&quot; &quot;Bitter Fingers,&quot;  and &quot;Tell Me When the Whistle Blows.&quot;  Never heard of them?  Then  you are in for a great surprise!<br />I can't help but think of Pink Floyd's  &quot;Welcome to the Machine&quot; as &quot;Whistle&quot; winds down to  give way to &quot;Someone Saved My Life Tonight.&quot;  And I wonder  whether Freddy Mercury of Queen actually sang some of the opening lines in  &quot;Better Off Dead.&quot;  The musical styles in this album are varied,  but they vary in such subtle ways that the album as a whole is much more  than the sum of its parts.  As if that wasn't enough, this remastered  version includes &quot;Philadelphia Freedom&quot; and &quot;Lucy in The Sky  with Diamonds&quot; as bonus tracks!  Enjoy!
0440211727|5.0|This book was a great book on the law and the court. It started out with a  great beggining and ended with a great end. Don't think that this book is  like one of Grishams other books. I read The RAINMAKER and I thought this  one was significantly better. Grisham did a great job of showing us how  hard it is to be a lawyer in a small town in the South. He showed us the  hardships a young lawyer in the south who is trying to keep a law firm  alive. The book showed us how hard it is to make money in a little town.  One day you could have three thousand dollers come in and the next day you  could have nothing come in. He made it seem like you were there in the  court listening to the trial. Grisham accourtly showed us the racism in the  south angainst the African American race.  He was not afraid to use the  racial slurs that there is in the south to make the book more real. Grisham  did a great job of showing us in depth how it messes with your mind to be  in trial.      I was asstonished to how the lawyers reacted to the media.  They all want to be the one who gets to the cameras first. I did not  realize the rush to be the one who gets his name regonized first.      Overall I give this book Five stars. I loved it  and I hope you will enjoy  it to.
B00000AFFF|5.0|The new collaboration of bacharach and costello is a dream come true for  fans of popular music. Unlike the mc cartney/Mc manus songwriting  partnership of a few years ago, this is a fully realized effort utilizing  the unique talents of both artists. costello fans have long been aware of  elvis' admiration for bacharach,as he has previously covered two of his  compositions. Its no suprise that bacharach would love the music of  costello as elvis has always demonstrated considerable skill as pop  songwriter. the production reflects the classic sound of bacharach's great  1960's hits. &quot;Toledo&quot; is in the style of &quot;do you know the  way to san jose&quot; for instance. I have been listening to this cd  non-stop for 2 weeks !
0553208845|5.0|This is the portrait of a young Brahmin boy in India, who tries to explore  the real meaning of life. Hermann Hesse shows a deep understanding of the  Indian psyche in delineating the characters in the book.<br />Siddhatha, a  contemporary of Buddha, starts off with striving to gain intellectual  strength as a brahmin, gives it up as not being the path to truth. Then  explores mastering his body and will and mind as a Samana, as being the  right path for a seeker. He eschews it for the indolent life of a merchant  and lover. When he is  surfeited with excessive pleasure and material  wealth, and purged his being of pride, both of control and  intellect he  goes back to being a seeker. Now he experiences the childlike wonder of  every new discovery and sees that the nature can teach him much. Now he is  learning a lot from River Ganges....<br />The questions that torment a normal  householder also come to trouble him, though rather late in life. But he  handles his difficulties in the spirit of a Sanyasin. He has at last found  peace.<br />Hesse tells a tale that is almost a fairy tale in simplicity. But  the impact of the story leaves one dazed. It is a book  for everyone who is  introspective even to a small extent. The way Hesse defines control is also  amazingly simple  and at the same time hard hitting - 'I can fast, I can  walk, I can wait'!
B000003S5H|5.0|Dreamy and spacy, it's an album that makes you feel good about the world.  Obviously written on the piano, the songs are warm and quirky but it's  quality stuff that stands out above the rest of the French imports.The  highlight for me is &quot;New star in the sky&quot; - pure magic, not a dry  eye in the house. This album is simply superb !
0688152023|3.0|Good Photos,Very Exercises but how can i learn the Split? or other extreme  Exercises and stretches?
B00000AFFI|5.0|If this is Desire, then give me some more!  Eagerly awaited, PJ Harvey's  new album is just pure,strong beauty. There's actually impossible to pick  one song to list as &quot;the best track&quot; as all of them are  magnificent. The mood on the album might in some ways resemble the one on  &quot;To bring you my love&quot;, and those of you who got totally addicted  to that album, are destined to get hooked on this one as well. &quot;Is  this Desire&quot; is the best album so far this year, and I have only one  more thing to say: Buy it. Now!
0192834711|5.0|The Moonstone is a cleverly contrived tale of a stolen Indian dimond which  becomes the dangerous inheritance of Rachel Vendier.  When the incredible  dimond is stolen, for the second time, the seemimly simple case becomes a  masterpiece of mystery and suspense.  The novel entangles us in every page.   We become lost in the emotions of the 19th century characters.  When the  mystery begins to unfold, we delieghtedly press on, only to find that  Collins has outwitted us again.  Collins has an amazing talent for assuming  a variety of narrative voices, which keep the reader envolved with the  individual characters.  Each new clue elicits thousands of questions,  arousing in the reader, a desire to read on and on.  The Moonstone is the  most outstanding cassic detective mystery novel ever written.
B000005JXG|5.0|I bought this tape (when we had tapes, not CDs) in college and have almost  worn it out.  One of the all-time greates albums, ever.  Every song is  different and memorable.  My favorite has to be the title track - always  peps me up and gets me moving.  A sentimental close second is Fairytale of  New York - just twisted enough to actually resemble my life.  You must own  this one!
0060168366|4.0|Mr. Johnson's text ebbs and flows through the tale of the country.   Beginning before the United States of America was even concieved, he weaves  a fascinating story of America.  Though I do take exceptions to his  analysis in some areas, I did enjoy the study.<br />What makes this book  refreshing is his perspective.  It is nice to see a book written by a  conservative without presenting the liberal &quot;politically correct&quot;  biases evident in today's history books.  Taking time to dwell on important  subjects, he masterfully brings history home to his readers.<br />All in all,  this book is excellently written.  In fact, during the time I was reading  it, I took a longer bus route to and from work so that I would have more  time to savor it!  --- James D. Umbach
0425129586|5.0|The book really captured my interest!  The suspense of Agatha Christie's  work was really intriguing.  As a story of 10 people who come to a deserted  island to meet their fate, they really do fall.
B000002C1Z|5.0|The Animals by Pink Floyd is the most brilliant rock concept album ever  composed.  The message through music and lyrics is loud and clear.  The  album has a flow to it and the songs (and the subject matter) from one  track to the next naturally follow each other.  The music (form) conforms  to the lyrics (function) in the most beautiful manner. David Gilmour  displays his utmost sense of musicianship thru heartfelt guitar solos on  all tracks of this album.  Unlike most other rock guitar players, Gilmour  composes solos not to display his technical prowess, rather his music.  The  guitar solos are perfect, nothing can be added nor taken away to make them  better.  A lot has been said about PF and how Waters or Gilmour destroyed  the band or who is the real PF.  The fact is that the tremendos tension  between two very talented musicians, Gilmour and Waters, created the band  and its music.  Animals is a must for any PF fan.  Kaihan Ashtiani.
0061002747|5.0|This book by Agatha Christie is certainly one of the best.  You follow  along the plot, thinking everything is solved and clear, until a clever  twist comes and turns everything around at the very end.  It was very  surprising the way it ended and, like many other readers, I can safely say  this was a great book, for school or for pleasure.
B000002NHN|4.0|This is my first experience with Loreena McKennitts' music and I must say  I have very much enjoyed it !  The music itself is very rich and envoking  and she is an exellent master of her voice. My favorite song on this cd is  &quot;The Highway Man&quot; for this of you who have read the poem, you  know that it is very dramatic and sad, her voice and her music do this  piece of work justice. I do and have recommended this cd to friends.
0679409920|5.0|Like the previous reader, I'm no reader of cold war, James Bond type  novels, however I've always enjoyed Graham Greene's books.  This one is a  slight twist on the usual plot of good and bad guys, it deals with Africa (  the problems of apartheid), Soviet secrets and British intelligence.  A bit  hard for me (the non-thriller reader to get involved in) however the second  part of the novel was very absorbing  and kept you entirely involved.  All  in all a very enjoyable novel.  It would make  great plane reading.
B000002ITK|5.0|This album is filled with profound lyrics and beautiful guitar strokes.   It's like a beautiful autum day with the sun out and the birds singing.   And if you had any marbles, you'd buy it instantly.
0887331939|5.0|No one will doubt that Mary Shelly's Frankenstein is a classic of horror  fiction. It shows the horrific result when a man tries to play God. But  this version of Frankenstein features the chilling (but amazing)  illustrations by Bernie Wrightson. He truly brings to life the  self-loathing creation of Dr. Frankenstein, with his gory appearance and  enraged expressions. He expertly renders the landscapes of France and  Germany, where the book takes place. These illustrations compliment  perfectly Shelly's tale of the struggle between the man and his monster. A  must for any Illustration student or horror fan. Definitely buy a copy. Buy  two, in case you lose one.
B000000WA4|5.0|I luv this CD man!!!!!!!!!! My favorite songs are: ZERO, AND ODE TO ON  ONE, LOVE CUPID DE LOCKES, AND TAKE ME DOWN. I've been a fan of the  Smashing Pumpkins since I was in 5th grade. That was 4 years ago.
B000009CEM|4.0|This is the first Fear Factory CD I have purchased.  I had heard the first  one awhile ago and didn't really dig it much.  But I must say I like this  one alot.  Its heavy, groovy, and different.  Of course some of my friends  say it's FF's normal sound....well who cares do what works!
0880389052|5.0|Anyone interested in Advanced Dungeon and Dragon's this is a must read  novel! Only books that I have read that are better are in the same trilogy  or written as a sequel to the Dark Elf trilogy. Masterpiece.
B000002JR8|5.0|The most impressive album they have released.  It brings a new definition  to the work HEAVY GROOVE.  This album is easily one of the 5 best albums I  have ever heard. Even the lyrics have some serious themes going on....well  worth buying.
B00000AFWZ|5.0|The frustrating thing about this excellent collection is that it has been  doggedly put in one wrong category after another. From the packaging and  Amazon.com's own review, one might expect Jefferson Airplane-like songs. On  the other hand, there are endless references to &quot;garage-punk&quot;  until you think you're buying the Ramones.<br />The truth is that this is a  collection of rough, badly-recorded 60's pop songs inspired by The British  Invasion and LSD. It rocks like a Beatles or Beach Boys outtake. You have  to like the originals: Them, The Animals, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones.  If you do, these songs will be a delightful addition to your collection.  And in a few cases, you will be amazed: &quot;Don't Look Back&quot;, by The  Remains, is one of many standouts.
B000002I6T|5.0|David Crosby at his best.  This collection has it all - lyrics, melody,  great guest artists (Grace Slick, Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, Joni Mitchell  just to name a few) - music filled with heart.  Sit back, relax, let the  music carry you away.
B000000WZ4|1.0|I have seen the future of synthpop... and this is not it. Alan Wilder must  have seen the light and escaped while he still could. This is a mishap of  Air Supply boxset proportions (apologies to Dean Rasmussen).  Its only  mitigating factor is the fact that it towers over the negative-four-star  effort &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion&quot; and the  negative-eighteen-star live rendition of those tunes. Disappointment is not  the word. Advice for the band: get Wilder back, get Vince Clarke back, or  beg Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead to join up. It's your only hope.
B000002IWH|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the greatest soundtracks is The Crow. After seeing  the Great movie with Bruce Lee, I heard the soundtrack was really good from  a few friends who told me. They were right. I liked every single song on  this album. It's hip and pumped up. If you are ready for some great fun,  click the &quot;add to cart button.&quot;
B00000ADG2|5.0|I listened to the album again and again and again and it hit me this was  not an album. It was live , it touched my soul and mind and made me refect  on life. Buy this and enter her world.
B000002BYD|5.0|This is a mature disc by a great band that is at its peak. This effort  represents total teamwork by Pearl Jam.  For the first time, other members  of the band besides Eddie Vedder wrote songs.  The sound is as tight as  Pearl Jam has ever sounded.  From the simple yet incredibly moving  &quot;Wishlist,&quot; to the incredible &quot;Given to Fly,&quot; to the  epic &quot;In Hiding,&quot; to the rocking &quot;Do the Evolution,&quot;  and many other great tunes, this disc represents some of Pearl Jam's best  work to date.
0679735909|3.0|If you can pound your way through the first half of this book, you will be  rewarded by an engaging read.  It's greatest flaw is the attempt to create  a series of passionate relationships with really very impassionate,  peripherally-constructed characters.  <br />It's greatest enjoyment is the  creation of a cognative scaffolding by which an incredible tale may be  inferred.  Be prepared to inject your own emotions into this  well-constructed template.  Also be prepared to die of bordom during many  of the slow passages.<br />All-in-all, I'm glad I read this book, but it will  not be appealing to those who have little time to &quot;waste&quot;  meandering through alternately priggish Victorian &amp; florid  prose.<br />Yes, this book is over-rated, but still worth the trouble of  reading.
B000003Z4C|5.0|This CD perfect. My favorite is &quot;Loverman&quot;, featuring Satan (or  at least a rather frightening replica of his voice!). The best compliment I  can pay it, since you can't exactly say it's inspirational (unless you're  planning on becoming a serial killer), or snappy (if you're looking for  snappy, you'd be better off with Beetohven), is that I listened to it over,  and over, ....
0061002860|5.0|This book was written in 1926, (that means that it  is an early christie).  Some people who have read it hated it...and the is because of the end. They  claim that Mrs Christie didnt respect the common acceoted rules of writing  a detective novel...that was when it was just published, but it have some  very good reviews, and one even claimed it 2 be the best detective story  ever 2 be written. I say that the book is very good, one of the 3 best of  all A.C:s 55 full-length novells. Read it and enjoy!
B000000WFZ|5.0|Every time I need to reconnect with my soul, I listen to Ennio's Mission.  While haunting and mysterious, it is also joyous and spiritual, and I'm  amazed at how it never loses its appeal.  I've had it for quite a while and  treasure it as a cornerstone of my CD collection.  Sad, eloquent, simple,  and pensive, I save this for special moments in my life.
3931141802|5.0|In 1955, Swiss photographer Robert Frank traveled around the United States  on a Guggenheim Fellowship. The images he created were published first in  France in 1958, and then the following year in America. Highly  controversial in its day, &quot;The Americans&quot; gave us a much needed  outsiders view of who we are as a people.<br />Frank is an incredibly skilled  image maker, able communicate on many different levels with a single image.  Jack Kerouac is the perfect person to write the intro to this book. Both  artists worked in a similar way, using travel, speed and chance to  communicate fleeting, yet deep, feelings about our complex  culture.<br />Perfectly enjoyable by anyone with an interest in American  culture, but essential for those practicing documentary photography.
0701103019|5.0|Charlotte Sometimes is still one of my favorite books! About 3 years ago I  narrowed it down to two books, Chatlotte Sometimes and Jacob Have I loved,  now I have about 8 new favorites, but they can't knock the old ones out.  After years they're still number one, and number two.    Charlotte Somtimes  takes place in a bording school in the 60s, Charlotte trades places with a  girl from  world war I. It's one of the few YA books that cover that part  of  history.    I never knew ther were sequels until now! thank you to  whoever posted that information.
B000002KDO|4.0|This is the heaviest Christian Rock album I've ever heard-- songs of  redemption, perhaps tunes of contrition for the earlier Satanic-laced jams  on their first album (their best). Nevertheless, the riffs are heavy and  memorable. &quot;Sweet Leaf&quot; and &quot;Children of the Grave&quot; are  great, drug-induced and free of preaching. By the time of this third album,  Sabbath had clearly defined their sound-- psychedelic blues was long-gone;  Ozzy's nasal whine &amp; Iommi's top volume riffing had only begun (just  wished it lasted longer than a few more albums).
0345409671|1.0|I love the Vampire Chronicles, but this was just one giant prologue.  I  kept waiting for something to happen.  Finally it did, the book ENDED !!!
0380778556|5.0|I was highly pleased with the content. The setting allowed for the stories  characters to grow.  Although, it has been quite sometime since I have read  this book, I remember how involed I got as the plot progressed. REBECCA is  a sensational book of character suspense.  I really enjoyed reading  REBECCA.  I feel that if you have read  Daphne Du Maurier's book you will  want to read it again.
6305127638|4.0|Patrick Stewart was excellent in this movie, the costumes made them all  look like they were real.  The graphics were great!     END
0553260111|5.0|This was the first Ludlum book I have ever read. I thought I'd start it  before I went to school and found myself late for school! I was hooked, and  once I'd turned every page I began The Bourne Supremacy, and once I  fineshed thet I read The Bourne Ultimatum And after that I sat back and   realized I could breath again!!
B000000WA2|5.0|I love this album more than life itself.  Critics complain that it's too  similar to Parklife, but that's entirely missing the point.  Whereas  Parklife introduced a new songwriting mode, The Great Escape runs with it,  including everything that was great about Parklife and improving it a  thousandfold.  EVERYTHING about this album is brilliant.  My favorites are  Topman, Fade Away, and He Thought of Cars, but there isn't a bad track to  be found.  Buy this album or be doomed to forever wander benighted through  a wilderness of mediocre music.
B000003NA4|5.0|this is one of the best i've heard - a canadian talent who is very popular  here in France. a must have
0060920084|1.0|Mean-spirited meandering,  arrogant, and self-absorbed.... Confuses ridicule with humor.  Since Bryson moved to England and  &quot;became&quot; cultured, he appears to view  America as a vast  wasteland populated with cretinous unwashed bumpkins.  Try as I might, I  could not bring myself to finish this awful book. I strongly suggest you  find your reading pleasure elsewhere.
0393314804|3.0|I'm sure Irvine was surprised at the success of this book. Like most  people I saw the film first (because it's a British movie), loved the music  and was revolted by the toilet scene. Having bought the two CDs and read  the book (aloud for fun) I felt I had indulged in the alternative culture  it described. The truth is, the Trainspotting world is where nobody in  their right mind would want to go. Safely viewing this hell-hole through  celluloid and CDs makes us feel smug and safe. Very few of us have  experienced anything close to the lifestyle portrayed.<br />So why was it so  popular? Because it was different and shocking. On that score Irvine was  hugely successful and probably laughed all the way to the bank (with some  of my money).
B00000AFDW|3.0|The Kiss reunion tour was the first concert I ever attended. Since then, I  have become an even bigger kiss fan. This album, though highly awaited by  millions, is good at best. There are some good songs, but thats it. I mean,  I like the cd, but there really isn't one song that grabs you and screams  KISS. It's a ton better than Carnival of Souls, possibly the worst KISS  album ever, original members or not. &quot;We Are One&quot; , &quot;Psycho  Circus&quot; ,and &quot;Raise Your Glasses&quot; are probably the best  tracks. &quot;You wanted the best&quot; is probably the worst. I could have  written a better song that that. But, I will see them when they tour. After  all, they're KISS. ROCK ON
0553573403|5.0|I was browsing through the fantasy section and I  picked this book out by chance. I had never heard of George R.R. Martin  before so I said what the heck, I will give him a chance. I am so grateful  that I did. The book was incredible. There were cerain passes in the book  where I just got shivers up my spine. I am trying to do whatever I can to  pass my time until the A Clash of Kings comes out. It seems that everything  I read now just doesn't compare.
B000007RV5|5.0|This is the best. I listen to it all the time it never leaves my cd  player. The music is so powerful you can feel it in every bone in your  body. The instrumental at the end of the song Everything is awesome its  just relaxing. Im so glad i bought this it the the best use of my money.  Limp Bizkit will always be good no matter what
B000000W6R|5.0|&quot;A Girl Named Sandoz&quot; is one of my favorite songs.  This is an  awesome album...  Then again, anything Billy Corgan does is awesome!
B00000D9TQ|2.0|Although I am a Phil Collins fan, I must say that his new &quot;Hits&quot;  album is little more than a money-making collection of circa '80s hits from  a singer who hasn't produced anything new or significant in several years.   Since exiting the pop scene -- as well as the &quot;progressive rock&quot;  genre, having parted ways with &quot;Genesis&quot; pals Tony Banks and Mike  Rutherford -- Collins has spent most of the '90s living off his past  laurels.  Hence this &quot;Hits&quot; album is just one last stroll to the  bank for maestro Phil!  (Since most of his fans probably already own  serveral of his '80s albums anyway, why bother with this rehash at all?)   Collins' current ventures -- playing drums to the &quot;big beat  sound&quot; of &quot;The Buddy Rich Orchestra,&quot; and working on some  &quot;Tarzan&quot; movie -- point to a whole new direction for the one-time  singing sensation.  (Why is it that whenever one of these Super-Stars pulls  a &quot;swan song&quot; act, they always release one of these  &quot;anthology&quot; things?  I don't suppose it could be for the money!   Buuurrp...sorry, that must have been left over from the last  Budweiser-sponsored Genesis American tour!)  Nonetheless, whether Collins'  new direction will work out for him remains to be seen.  But one thing is  for certain: his contributions to the pop and progressive rock music scenes  are now fodder for the &quot;Rock History&quot; books.  So,  adios Phil,  we'll miss the &quot;old&quot; you...even though I think we could feel it  comin' through the air for awhile!
B000002KBA|5.0|One of the best, most devastating rock albuns of all times, IN ROCK offers  an almost magical experience for everyone who likes good-old HEAVY and  INTENSE rock 'n' roll.<br />I listened it for the first time when I was  already a fan of Zeppelin, Hendrix and Purple itself. What a thrill when  &quot;Speed King&quot;''s killer opening attacked my ears! And then  &quot;Blood Sucker&quot;... and &quot;Child in Time&quot; (Purple most  &quot;serious&quot; song)... by the time Lord and Blackmore were soloing in  &quot;Flight of The Rat&quot; I was just shouting &quot;yeahs&quot; of  approval  and thinking &quot;Why on earth people always mention MACHINE  HEAD as their best&quot;?<br />When &quot;Hard Lovin' Man&quot; ended amongst  an apocalypse of distortion, I was completely blown away.<br />Well, I was  seventeen then, but almost ten years later I still love this album and I  recommend it to everyone who likes Deep Purple and early heavy rock in  general.
0684874350|5.0|An excellent tale from that grand tradition of Irish storytellin'. Is this  his first book? As autobiography, 'tis grand, but I wonder if McCourt is  good enough to pen another smashing book.  I lift my pint to him.
B00000AFDW|4.0|I give the &quot;Psycho Circus&quot; only 4 stars out of 5 because I  believe that is the highest you can give a KISS album. KISS has never put  out a &quot;great&quot; album like AC/DC's &quot;Back In Black&quot; or ZZ  Top's &quot;Eliminator.&quot; Even &quot;Kiss Alive&quot; was made up of  songs from 2-3 star albums. Having said that, I have to say that I have  been a KISS fan since the &quot;Rock and Roll Over&quot; came out. I have  lived and breathed KISS for all those years and could not wait for this  album to come out. As a TRUE KISS fan, I love it from the first song to the  last. I say &quot;Let's Rock &amp; Roll All Nite &amp; Party Every  Day!!!!!!!!&quot;
B00000AFDW|4.0|I've been with you since 1977. My first record was Alive II. I WAS BLOWN  AWAY. Songs like Detroit Rock City, Makin' Love, Calling Dr.Love, Shock me,  Christine Sixteen, Hard Luck Woman, I Stole your Love, God of Thunder, All  american Man were songs that had that groove and punch that made me LOVE  YOU. Now, specially I loved tunes like C'mon and love me, Cold Gin, Black  Diamond, 100,000 years,Firehouse, Deuce, R&amp;R all nite, Watchin' you,  Room Service, and She. Except from She, all of the other songs I mentioned  had one thing in common. They were written by just you guys; the band  members. Why do you have to get people from outside to write your songs. Is  your fuel emptying? Jesus Christ!!! Guys, your best songs were written by  you!!! I don't know how to describe it but those songs had something far  out that you haven't found again. I guess your hunger made you kick ass at  that time and then you went out of focus. I understand. But my beloved  friends, why can't you blast me out of the face of the planet with riffs  like the ones you made. Your music has never been the same. NEVER. I feel  so bad for that. Why can't you find that groove? You had that EDGE. YOU HAD  THAT EDGE. You were unique and the best songs were written BY YOU. I  thought you were going to get that sound back. Don't get me wrong, I love  the album, but It's not the SAVAGE BEAUTIFUL GARDEN of songs that really  had that groove. I don't know how to describe it. OK I'll give it a try.  Compare  the songs Watching You with I just wanna. Compare the song She  with Heaven's on Fire. Compare the song Black Diamond with Rise to it.  Compare the song C'mon and Love me with Uh! all night. Guys I love you, but  tell me what are you missing. You had that street N.Y. sound and I bet you  didn't care much about making the song look pretty or cool. You had the  Magic Touch inside of you and I bet it's still there. Ace gave Kiss the  best guitars riffs. The melodies: Love Gun, Destroyer, C'mon and love me,  Rock Bottom. I can't begin to express my feelings when I hear you singing  songs that make me feel a little ashamed. WHERE IN THE NAME OF GOD IS THAT  MUSICAL FEELING FROM THE 70'S HIDDEN??? I was really hoping you were going  to let it all loose in here. All the demons out... Without having to answer  to no one but yourselves. It is pretty good but nothing like before.  NOTHING LIKE BEFORE. ANY WAY, I STILL LOVE YOU GUYS. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE  YOU. The only thing that I have really respected is, after Creatures of the  Night, Carnival of Souls and this one. But Carnival of Souls really made me  feel a lot better about you guys. Bruce had a feeling of his own. Really  trippy. He made me feel that he had something to give. It had feeling in a  sort of &quot;trip out&quot; way. Nothing like the Electricity and the  Melodies of Ace. Anyway, Carnival was something to be proud of. I expected  that with Psycho you would go to the streets where you came from to forget  all the flashiness and really lame melodies you had in some of your albums,  like Hot in the Shade, Asylum, Crazy Nights, even Revenge. Carnival is  something different. Anyway, Psycho has some nice moments and I enjoyed it  but it didn't made my heart pound. I was expecting Kiss, Dressed to Kill,  Hotter than Hell, Love Gun, Destroyer, Rock &amp; Roll over material. You  guys had really good songs. REALLY GOOD MATERIAL. I know you have a lot of  things to worry about besides making music. You like the flashiness and the  big bucks. I don't blame you. I envy you in a good way. I just wish  sometime in the near future you would give me my wish, go into the studio  only you four guys and give us fans an album with your stamp on it saying  &quot;this songs were composed by only us and they resemble and have the  nostalgia that our earlier albums had&quot; THAT DAY, IF I COULD TAKE THAT  ALBUM TO HEAVEN, I WOULD DIE IN PEACE... I love you guys anyway, you have  been human heroes for me. I know you are flesh &amp; bone too... But we all  have the spirit that makes us fly again if ever did fly at one time.... IF  ANYONE OF YOU READERS CAN GET THIS TO GENE, PAUL , ACE OR PETER I WOULD  APPRECIATE IT...  KISS FOREVER....sh &amp; bone too... But we all  have the spirit that makes us fly again if ever did fly at one time.... IF  ANYONE OF YOU READERS CAN GET THIS TO GENE, PAUL , ACE OR PETER I WOULD  APPRECIATE IT...  KISS FOREVER....
B000002MG1|5.0|It is a great album,different styles and a lot of songs that you just want  to play again and again.
B000002L5I|4.0|I love this album.  I didn't give it 5 stars only because I know once the  band grows, it'll be even better.  And, besides, I only reserve 5 stars to  the greatest bands (Dave Matthews Band, Radiohead).  But undoubtably KWSB  will get there someday!  The songs aren't just catchy, but well done.   Noah's voice is great, and Kenny's guitar rocks, as does the rest of the  band.  Yes, BAND.  It's not just Kenny!:-)  If you like blues-rock, go for  it.  If you don't ... go for it!  It's a great album for anyone to have. I  promise.
0394583892|4.0|I would highly recommend Plum Island to mystery lovers.  Nelson Demille is  hilariously funny as he describes his characters...though some women may  find his humor offensive in that the main character is very sexist and  quite horney throughout the novel.  The story itself is interesting and  provocative!  If you're intrigued by pirate legend and government  coverups...you'll enjoy this book!
B000000WFU|1.0|I bought this one because I loved the Pure Moods CD and saw that many  people had bought this one, too.  This CD is boring and uninspired; I  wished I hadn't bought it.  This one will be hanging as a tree decoration  in time for the holidays.
0060925000|2.0|I realized, about 900 pages into A Suitable Boy, why I wasn't enjoying  it.<br />1) It is horrendously overladen with distracting minutiae.<br />2) It  requires a compendious knowledge of Indian historical, cultural and  political context. The book could've been a vehicle to teach me about a lot  of these things (as I had hope it would be), but it really isn't at all.  After finishing it, I still don't know whether an SD is &quot;higher  up&quot; than an MLA or if a Minister of Revenue is more influential than a  Home Minister.<br />And my greatest peeve... 3) There is no real conflict in  the book. Yes, there are class/religion questions - most notably in the  relationship between Lata and Kabir - but there were literally HUNDREDS of  times in the book that I thought some interesting conflict could arise,  only to be disappointed. For example, Firoz and Imitiaz are twins, yet  Imitiaz is the elder, having been born first. Chance for sibling rivalry?  It's mentioned twice and never explored. For another example, Arun is harsh  to his brother Varun. Very little conflict is ever explored there either.  For yet another example, Meenkashi gets pregnant by an affair. OOH, that  could get juicy and embarassing. But she has a miscarriage and nothing more  happens. And perhaps greatest of all, a lot is made of the Zamindiri Bill.  If passed and affirmed, people would be thrown off their land and others  would benefit. YET THIS NEVER HAPPENS. It gets teased, but nothing comes of  it.<br />And even when thing DO happen, you may not know why. Mahesh Kapoor  suddenly quits the Congress Party and resigns his seat. Why? We don't  really know.<br />After about 1300 pages, one character stabs another. We  aren't quite sure why.<br />4) This book is consumed with festivals, holidays  and travel. This would be an interesting backdrop to things that are  happening - dramatic tension, conflict, ANYTHING - but there is painfully  little of that.<br />5) My edition was 1474 pages of slice of life. It begins  with a wedding; it ends with a wedding. Other than Lata's choice of mate,  there is no sense of narrative arc - the characters are essentially  unchanged.<br />6) Seth spends page after page after page on characters and  situations that seem unrelated to much of anything. New characters are  introduced almost up to the final 10-15 pages.<br />In short, it was a  rambling wreck. I only finished it because I had so much time invested  already.<br />I consider it my Ironman Triathlon (or my Bataan Death March).
B000002I6X|4.0|Stills 2 is Stephen's best solo album (his Manassas album is superior, but  is not considered a solo work by most listeners). This album is more  personal than the first album and not as burdened with vocal and  instrumental &quot;contributions&quot; from visiting super-stars. For the  most part the songs are well written, sung, and produced. &quot;Change  Partners&quot; and &quot;Marianne&quot; are real gems and rank among his  finest work.  Slower, more thoughtful songs such as &quot;Fishes &amp;  Scorpians&quot; and &quot;Singin' Call&quot; also hit their mark. The only  criticisms of the album is the use of horns and the trend toward  self-consciousness in some of the songs.
B00000AFWZ|3.0|Elektra Records'1972 NUGGETS double LP compilation occupies in legendary  place in pop archeology, as the first testimonial to the disingenuous  charms and reckless abandon of pre-hippie '60s rock'n'roll. For all the  significance attached to the original NUGGETS as a template for the punk  ethos, nobody I knew in the '70s had even heard of it, and I've only seen  one copy (for $25) in all my years of record scrounging.  Rhino picked up  the ball in 1984 with a NUGGETS series that has not been comprehensively  reissued on CD. In a state of digital-era confusion Rhino put out three  NUGGETS CDs that mixed the better-known cuts from the LPs with decidedly  non-garage numbers from the Monkees and the Chambers Brothers.  With  Elektra and Rhino both absorbed by Time/Warner, this four CD box set  combines the 27 original nuggets with 91 tracks culled primarily from the  Rhino series. <br />  NUGGETS doesn't represent a single genre; here you'll  find frenzied, fuzz-drenched psychedelia, Kinks-like frat rock slammers,  Beatlesque harmonizing, and overly affected, suburban R&amp;B knock-offs.   In a welcome departure from the upscale aspirations of Rhino's earlier  documents of the era, this collection mines the rich vein of psych/punk  ravers that previously only surfaced on low-fi compilations like PEBBLES,  BOULDERS, and the inimitably titled TURDS ON A BUM RIDE. The Third Bardo's  &quot;I'm Five Years Ahead of My Time,&quot; the Bees' &quot;Voices Green  and Purple,&quot; the Groupies' &quot;Primitive,&quot; and the Other Half's  &quot;Mr. Pharmacist&quot; receive better sonic presentation than  previously seemed possible.  Sound quality is excellent throughout, with  original mono mixes preserved where appropriate.<br /> A 100-page booklet  packed with vintage photographs provides erudite track-by-track annotation  by &quot;Ugly Things&quot; editor Mike Stax. The incredibly tacky-and  glaringly inappropriate--Peter Max-style cover art of the 1972 LP has been  adaptedfor the box set.  Max's tasteless reiteration of the San Francisco  poster idiom was a '70s excrescence entirely unrelated to the mid '60s  garage rock scene.  We had Peter Max placemats when I was a kid, and they  made me want to vomit.<br />If you own any of the NUGGETS LPs or CDs, you're  certain to be disappointed by the excessive familiarity of certain  selections, as well as by some heart-rending omissions.  While this set  reprises 26 tracks from the poorly planned NUGGETS VOL. 1-3 CDs, highlights  like Rumor's hypnotic &quot;Without Her,&quot; the Association's raga rock  confection &quot;Pandora's Golden Heebie Geebies,&quot; the American  Breed's power pop milestone &quot;Bend Me, Shape Me,&quot; and Cherokee's  &quot;Girl, I've Got News for You&quot; remain in vinyl limbo.  But for the  uninitiated, this collection will provide an excellent (if overpriced)  introduction to a short-lived era defined by exhilarating energy,  innocence, humor, and unalloyed adolescent passion.
B00000AFWZ|4.0|Thank goodness for programmable CD.  If this collection was available on  vinyl it would be unplayable.  The reason I rate it 4 stars is because out  of 130 songs there are at least 20 extremelyhard to find classics that rank  among the best of the Sixties.   Songs by Human Beinz, the Gants, the  Choir, the Blue Magoos, the Outsiders and the Electric Prunes (alas, no  Great banana Hoax) are worth the price.  The bands are all American.  We  need an equivalent British set -- HedgeHoppers Anonymous and Jonathan King.
0201633612|5.0|Generally computer langauages are taught with too much emphasis on syntax,  rather than the semantics. <br />This book helps to illustrate how an object  oriented language's behaviour can be used to solve problems at a higher  level of abstraction.
B00000DBXL|1.0|I don't know what these guys were thinking... I absolutely loved the  &quot;Fashion Nugget&quot; album, so I figured this one would be great too.   Man, was I wrong!!!  Track three is the only song worth listening to...  and it's not worth 12 bucks!!
B00000DBXL|4.0|This Cd is  filled with heartbreaking loves songs that will take time for  you to get used to, but when you do you will love them.  I was a big fan of  there second CD Fashion Nugget.  While I don't think this CD is as good it  is not a dissapointment.  They may have made there songs softer but they  are still great.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I just cannot place any other band next to U2 as far as the music and the  lyrics go. They are out there..unreachable. If you've been dumbed by the  American mainstream music (today's &quot;best&quot;) being poured down on  you by the craploads - then you won't see it... sorry
B000002NHN|5.0|I'm a fan of older rock and roll and have never listened to Celtic music.  I've had the TV on UPN recently and they've been advertising their new  series &quot;Legacy&quot;. The theme song caught my attention and every  time I heard it, I liked it more and more. I finally went to the UPN web  site, checked the Legacy page, which led me to the production company's web  site, and left e-mail. As soon as they got back to me with the information  on McKennitt, the album, and the song, I bought a copy of the CD and have  been hooked! I like all the tracks, although find the words to &quot;The  Highwayman&quot; almost too chilling to listen to. I can play &quot;The  Mummers' Dance&quot; over and over without tiring of it. It is one of those  pieces that makes me want to dance closely with a good dance partner, or  make love.
0060168366|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much I read it again.  Johnson's review of the  pre-colonial era and the role that religion played was particularly  interesting as it provided a keen insight into the underpinnings of our  nation's strongly democratic tradition.  His concluding remarks at the end  of the book were most stirring and eloquent.  A thoroughly positive and  uplifting message.
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon was about the best book I've read about Arthurian  legends. Seeing the incidents through the eyes of Morgaine and the other  female characters gave me new insight into what life could have been like  for a woman living in such times. It must have been incredibly difficult  for the women to watch their people turn away from the goddess based  religion to Christianity. Where once the women had power, the men began to  ridicule others who listened to their wives' counsels.         The truly  strong characters are, of course, the women of Avalon-- manipulative  Viviane, self serving Morgause, and rebellious Morgaine. These women use  their wiles and power to try to change events to accomodate their own  agendas. The book also ridicules Gwynhwyfar for being a weak minded  hypocrite who doesn't realize that by embracing Christianity so whole  heartedly she's giving up the very power that could make her strong. Notice  that, since she has turned away from the goddess based religion, she also  does not bear any children.         Arthur just tries to keep peace in his  household. He gives in to a hysterical Gwynhwyfar every time she simpers,  but looks to Morgaine for guidance that she's unwilling to give. He's beset  by enemies on all sides, and unwittingly sets the stage for the death of  Viviane.         I also found the theory that Merlin is a title, rather than  the name of a particular wizard, interesting.          This book was a  refreshing look at the Arthurian legends. Don't blame the characters for  using the tools available to them. Remember that in the time of Arthur, it  was extremely important to be able to bear children, weave, and partake in  \\"women's work.\\"
0684874350|5.0|Like one reader put it:&quot; I did not want for the book to end&quot;...  It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me want to know this man  &quot;Frank Mc Court&quot; now... What happened after his arrival in  America?...What happened to the rest of the Mc Court's? But my most  important question would be:&quot; How has this past life formed you to the  man you are now?&quot;
0399143904|3.0|I finished reading this book a month or so ago and couldn't even face  thinking about it until now.  This was like the Perils of Pauline  revisited.  Or, to use another &quot;old&quot; phrase, &quot;If it wasn't  one thing, it was another.&quot;  Where is Jack Ryan when you need  him?<br />I've always liked John Clark as a supporting character, and might  like him as a lead if Mr. Clancy hadn't put in so many disasters.<br />Mr.  Clark has found himself the head of a unique organization set up to fight  world terrrorists - but only when asked to help.  This man was busier than  the CIA during the Cold War.  It became too improbable, even for a diehard  Tom Clancy fan like myself.<br />The action was so non-stop, I began to ask  myself, &quot;Will this insanity never end?&quot;<br />I think there might  be a future for John Clark and his son-in-law as new crime fighting heroes;  they are both very likeable and talented.  Mr. Clancy just needs to calm  his exuberance and deal with one or two major world-peace shattering  terrorist events rather than 10 - one right after the other.<br />I was  exhausted after reading this one!
6302969352|5.0|This is the essential Kurosawa movie.  Each man involved is brought in for  different reasons, some not as noble as others,but honorable in each one's  mind.  A lot goes on in this movie between the characters and their  motivations.  Seven Samurai is just as much about samurai as it is about  humanity and brotherhood.  The band of samurai begin almost in a stand-off  amongst their  personalities and eventually become true comrades.  I could  go on about this movie and it's underlying themes, but that could last  forever.  It's a great movie and worth anyone's time.  It can definitely  draw anyone into it's story just by glancing at it.  Just for the record,  it's not a movie you watch in an attempt to draw something from, it flows  evenly through out and doesn't slow down or have dull moments; truly a  great movie.     END
B000005S5N|5.0|Of all of a-Ha's albums, this has to be the most accomplished.  No, the  lyrics don't make much by sense, but after the playfulness of Hunting High  and Low, this album is much tougher and musically more interesting.  I'm  not sure why I still listen to it over and over again 12 years after it's  release, but it is definitely one of my faves.  Best songs: 'The Swing of  Things' and 'Cry Wolf'
B00000D9TQ|5.0|In all the albums, Phil collins has inspired me in all of his work.  It  makes me happy to here him when I am in a stressful mood. Keep on making  great music Phil
B000002KET|5.0|First I have to say that if Black Sabbath doesn't make the Rock &amp; Roll  Hall of Fame it is a crime!  &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; is the  creme de la creme of early '70s subculture, a ripened band at its  smoldering, meltdown triumphant best.
0060916540|5.0|It you liked &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; you will love &quot;Touching the  Void&quot;.  The experiences of the author make the Everest expedition  detailed in &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; look like a cake walk.  This is a  quick, fast-paced read that you will not be able to put down.
B000002NHN|5.0|This CD is a must for any celtic, or folk music collector. Each of the  songs paint a hauntingly familiar picture, as each tell a unique story.  Most people have probably read the story The Highwayman in an english  class, or one of it's renditions, but none have been so realisticly  portrayed or told as that by Loreena McKennit.
B000002E5J|5.0|This is one of my favourite albums. Get the Brazilian version if you can -  it has FIVE extra tracks (two remixes and three Portuguese re-recordings).  Good stuff!
0425129586|5.0|I own over thirty Agatha Christie books, and this is my favorite. This was  my first adult book (I read it when I was 10), and Agatha wrote the book in  a way that was both intriguing and easy for everyone to grasp. The plot  itself remained true to the artist's trademark style, gathering a certain  amount of people and placing them in a life ending predicament. The ending  was of Dame Agatha's best, and this was without the amazing Hercule Poirot  to help us come to the conclusion. I reccommend any Agatha book, whether it  be a classic such as this, the Mousetrap, Murder on the Orient Express, or  even the more understated books... remember that Dame Agatha wrote almost  80 mystery novels, and each have twisting and original plots. Agatha  Christie is one of the greatest authors that ever lived... and I don't  think that anyone will contradict that after reading this novel.
0767802470|5.0|I liked the original version of Das Boot and the director's cut is even  better. The commentary track is as good as they get - informative and  funny. An A-list DVD along with Contact. Despite their shared genre, Das  Boot and Pvt. Ryan are quite different films. I liked both. Das Boot is far  less graphic, and probably for that reason I would watch it more  often.<br />Also, I disagree with an earlier negative comment on the audio.  The audio was completely remixed in a labor of love for this version and I  think it's fine.     END
B000002KIE|2.0|Okayokayokay, so it kicked off the Punk revolution and all--just because it's significant historically doesn't mean it's especially stunning musically.  Angry, yes, but unable to really coherently show that anger.  Most of the songs are near-unlistenable cacaphonies that show no real song-writing skill.  Just because you're going against the establishment doesn't mean you should be able to get away with having no real talent.  Okay, they're --- but you can't help but feel that they wouldn't be so angry if they weren't getting paid for it.  It all seems very self-conscious--&quot;look at us, we represent the voice of growingly dissatisfied British youth!&quot; And when specific targets are indicated for their wrath, they always seem so obvious and shallow.  Ooh, you're against corporate greed and self-centeredness?  Wow, that IS making a statement!  Gee, you're in favour of anarchy?  Gosh, that's a new and radical idea all right! All in all, you might want to buy this just for the historical importance, but you're unlikely to listen to it much.  Buy a Clash record if you want to see what Punk was REALLY about.  END

B000002UAC|1.0|I realize it may seem hypocritial of me to criticize the guy who gave  Revolver one star on top of all the five star ratings and then bash this,  but what I say here is my genuine opinion. This is far and away the  Beatles' worst album.  There just isn't much good I can say about it--NONE  of the songs are memorable.  I listened to this three or four times when I  first bought it, some five years ago, and I haven't since.  Only a  necessary purchase for Beatles completists.
B000002N2P|3.0|Really, GD didn't spend much time on this one to make it sound good  enough, but it still is Green Day and it still is a very good album.
B000002UB6|4.0|Those people who see fit to bash this album are obviously giving in to all  the negative hype surround it, without actually LISTENING to it with an  open mind.  Yes, a few of the songs--Dig It, Maggie Mae--are throwaways,  and yes, Dig a Pony is strangely mediocre, but all the other songs are  wonderful.  Two of Us is the perfect road song, Across the Universe is  hauntingly beautiful, and I Me Mine may be George's finest Beatles song.   One After 909, resurrected from the band's eariest days for inclusion here,  holds up very well--better than most of the material that actual appeared  on their early albums.  If you're a Beatles fan, you need this.  If you're  not, you might just need it anyway.  And hey, you can always read the first  three song titles as a sentence--&quot;Two of us dig a pony across the  universe.&quot;;)
0345350499|5.0|The Mists of Avalon is a book I have returned to again and again over the  years. I read the book for the first time more than 14 years ago, when I  was still in college, and it captured my interest and facination then.  Having re-read easily a dozen times, I am drawn to a new facet or twist  every time, and I come away with a new one of MZB's amazing life lessons  each 'visit'. For me, the traditional Arthurian legend was intriguing  enough but now the new telling has so-replaced the stereotyped characters  of old in my mind, that I have a hard time listening or reading to the  biased original tale anymore. This is a long book, but one that is  virtually impossible to put down. Once you are through, you find yourself  still 'reliving' each moment in your mind. I cannot recommend it highly  enough.
B000002A3T|5.0|As an ardent Pink Floyd fan, I was most pleased when listening to Division  Bell for the first time.  Over the last several years, it has become the  favorite of my collection.  Although the album doesn't try anything  radically different, it shows a level of refinement before unseen.  It also  returns to Dark Side era collaberation, producing some of the album's best  songs.
0553212478|2.0|Okay, I can see the romanticism that is covered with this book but I  cannot fidn the entertainment that is supposed to lie in every single book  upon this earth.  I am 15, and sitting here reading (and sleeping to) this  book was just an absolute waste of time.  The book was filled with constant  tautology (constant repition of the same thing, just in different words)  and filled  with chapters that were utterly pointless.  There is no horror  to this story at all...It is about a living creature, shunned by society  who eventually goes on the rampage.  Gee, like that hasn't happened before.  The story was generic, even for it's time.  I think Mary was desperate,  considering that the book wasn't even liked in the first place by the  original romanticists authors of that time.
B000002KIE|5.0|Just a few days after I wrote buy the Pistols, Husker Du and Minutemen an  amazon editor suggests buying Husker Du and the Minutemen, showing me once  again that the rag I work for isn't paying me enough. However there is one  noticeable problem with Minutemen on CD and that's the omission of the  cover of Van Halens 'Aint Talkin Bout Love' and the removal of at least 2  tracks of a VW bus trying to get into reverse...those who have the double  album know what I'm talking about. Still, the CD is well worth getting.  My  plan here is to put in enough 5 star reviews on the Pistols to wipe out the  one star reviews from 9 year olds that think the Ramones really are  brothers.

B0000024SI|5.0|There's a reason this album makes every best list and always gets the  highest ratings possible: it  works on every level. First, Bob wrote a  bunch of songs that have music that seethes with power and wordplay so  dense and amazing that I'm still trying to figure it all out - lots of  world weary poetic contempt going on here. Then he assembled a band that  plays this complex music with a kick ass passion Dylan didn't often have on  other albums. And to top it all off, Bob sings (really sings, none of this  whiny monotone stuff he's done in recent years) with such confidence and  power that he makes most other singers seem like poseurs. It's a  combination that's hard to touch. It's a version of the blues that doesn't  imitate anyone.  Enormous artistry going on here. The Bob album to have if  you are only getting one.
0812931017|5.0|My mother used to tell me that I could achieve anything, since  &quot;You're too stupid to know that you can't do it!&quot;. Eventually you  may come to believe it. Well, if you're feeling that way and think that  what you're about to do may mean that you'll be cast adrift in the Pacific  Ocean of business, here's the definitive business life raft! <br />If you've  been through anything like RB in business (I have, although on a VERY much  smaller scale) it's good to know that where you came unstuck, or close to  it, others like RB have done so too and triumphed. A brilliant collection  of stories of risking all for everything, time and time again. Mind-saving  reading when you know that you're right, or that you're too determined to  let the other person, or corporate, get the better of you. This is the  stuff that exceptional business people are made of, and in reading this  book you might come to realise that you could become an exceptional  business (and family) person too.

0399143904|2.0|After reading and enjoying every fiction work I was looking forward to get  hold of this book ... and was badly disappointed.<br />What I criticize most  in this novel are the repeating descriptions of characters and their goals.  It's really hard to reread something in only slightly different words  what's been 100 pages above.<br />The story: Good start but with every page  more predictable. Reading this book you wait for something to happen all  the time while reading repeating stuff. I used to be intriqued by his other  books, not wanting to take a break but in this book I had to otherwise I  wouldn't have finished it.<br />Next point is the language: I understand that  Mr. Clancy wants to make sure about the mental and emotional state of his  characters, but I think that the style he used is not what I expect in a  book but rather in some bad movie.<br />Another and minor point: There are  some words in german, or that's at least what I thought they should be -  but most of those were spelled incorrect. Maybe they have been  'americanized' and thus have been altered, otherwise I would interpret this  as being ignorant.<br />Bottom line: if you don't know the author read one of  his older works, if you know him - skip it!
B000001FS3|4.0|This is a good album, but it is not as &quot;spectacular&quot; as people  say. It lacks the emotion of their earlier albums, but does manage to keep  the listener interested. The songs are good, but their earlier stuff is  much better. Pretty good overall, but not even close to War, U2's best  album by far.
0140177396|5.0|If you did not read it in college take the time to read it now.
B000006045|3.0|This album is much less diverse and interesting than the previous two.  Despite the powerful presence of Liz Frazer, it seems that like fellow  trip-hoppers Portishead, they became too self-indulged. It's a fair album,  but not what I came to expect from a group like Massive Attack.
0790729644|3.0|Ok, first of all I'd like to make it clear I haven't seen the DVD. I was  going to purchase it and thought I would write a review before I did. I  watched the Pan &amp; Scan VHS version. I like Clint Eastwood a lot. Mainly  his older movies. The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly. For a Few Dollars More,  and Fistfull of Dollars, High Plains Drifter, and of course Hang Em' High.  <br />I watched this movie, and liked it a lot. It had a good story, ok amount  of violence. But it just didn't have enough action. I just like his older  movies where he is constantly pulling his gun, and fanning his trigger.  This movie is more of a realistic look at the 1800's. I did like this  movie, but it's just a little slow. It's not like his older movies, but  it's a damn good movie. I have to say 3 stars, is because I personally  didn't like it. But overall it had great acting and really excellent  directing.     END
B000003BDJ|5.0|I'm a Stones FREAK, and I'm probably unique for a Stones freak in that I  don't think--over all--that the sixties were their best period, but their  worst. Those early albums in the early sixties were pretty bad...but they  had some real gems on them. (The Stones started making great albums with  &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot;) And this album plucks the gems from those  albums and puts them together so that you have the creme de la creme. If  you are not a fan of this album, then you are not a fan of rock and roll.
0812550706|5.0|My Dad (an adventure book fan, not a sci-fi reader), brother and I each  read the book in less then a day and a half, and each loved it.  That was  several years ago, and I still think it is the most enjoyable book I have  ever read, and one of the most interesting characters I have ever met.<br />A  fabulous book for anyone who enjoys adventures, science fiction, or great  characters, or anyone who has ever been a kid with an imagination.
0887309372|5.0|I haven't even touch the book yet but I already know it's good.  Al Ries  (and Jack Trout)speaks like a psychologist, knowledgeable like a lawyer,  and authoritative like a CEO.  I've read most of their other books and for  most of what they preach, they back it up with sound, logical examples  (both from history and current business scenarios.)  I can't wait to get my  hands on this book.  &quot;Al Ries&quot;.. now that's a brand I know!)
B000002JS6|5.0|When people tell me that they only listen to Beethoven or Mozart or John  Tesh, I slap the headphones on their ears and give them a cranked up listen  to &quot;Given the Dog a Bone.&quot;  Before you know it, they've tossed  aside their dusty old recordings from long-dead composers  (or should be  dead composers) and are banging their heads with the best of them to the  real classics: Heavy Metal.  Poetry, pure and simple.  We even played  &quot;Shoot to Thrill&quot; at my wedding that's how heartfelt these tunes  are.  Rock on!!!
B000001DTM|5.0|&quot;Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses&quot; is one of the songs I play  over and over again.  Almost every song on this CD is great, the rest are  good.
B00000DBXL|5.0|This album was a bit slower than the previous two made, but still had the  same quality of music and effort. I especially liked NEVER THERE and SHEEP  GO TO HEAVEN for their fast  beat and lyrics. Only a few other artists I  know can keep up such a constant string of great music and fabulous albums.  ex, Eric Clapton, Nine inch Nails, Aerosmith, and Blues Traveler. Even  though it may take a while for each of the cds to come out but everyone of  them are worth twice the wait.
B0000033P2|5.0|&quot;The Endless Enigma Pt.1,&quot; &quot;Fugue,&quot; and &quot;The  Endless Enigma Pt.2&quot; make one of the finest progressive rock suite's  ever performed. &quot;From the Beginning&quot; is an intelligent and  acoustically brilliant song. &quot;The Sheriff,&quot; and  &quot;Hoedown&quot; make fine additions to the album, and the remaining  tracks burst with progressive energy and talent. the only album comparable  to this is the debut...
0345347951|5.0|Fantastic book! I almost wish this is what will happen to mankind  (especially if we keep warring and never get around to colonizing the  galaxy)! Listen up, reader, go out to your local used-book store and pick  up a copy.
B0000033OZ|5.0|&quot;Take a Pebble,&quot; &quot;Knife-Edge,&quot; &quot;Tank,&quot; and  &quot;Lucky Man&quot; are the best songs ELP has ever produced. This entire  album is filled with soundscapes of orchestral beauty...only with hammond  organs, moog synthesizers, guitars, and drums. Emerson's keyboards are  absolutely amazing to listen to, and Lake's guitar and bass is equally  impressive. This album marked the debut of one of classic rock's greatest  trios. Listen to this album for a taste of some bizarre, and a lot of  talent. Simply a classic!
B00000AFFF|2.0|Burt Bacharach's silky strings and lush orchestral arrangements clash with  Costello's creaky voice. The critics love it but I suspect the Bacharach  fans would rather have Dionne Warwick or Andy Williams singing, and the  Costello fans will hate the strings and heavenly choirs. A real oddity.
0440213525|1.0|This book, like most of Grisham's books, is based on an utterly asinine  premise.  A little kid learns a secret and the mob doesn't want him to  tell.  The protagonist -- an insufferably precocious and sensitive 11 year  old -- believes that if he does't tell, the mob won't kill him.  Its  absurd. So long as he keeps the secret, the mob has a good reason to kill  him.  This book was no surprise -- Grisham's other books, most notably The  Brief, are similarly flawed.  The story is contrived, the prose is mundane,  and the ending is predictable.
0385486804|5.0|I found Into the Wild to be a rare find. Krakauer's succeeds in composing  a tale which is provides the reader with a suspenseful adventure while at  the same time hitting on the basic questions of human existence.  Christopher McCandless' spontaneous rejection of what he regards to be the  superficial elements of life forced me to look at a world where materialism  is absent.  As a reader who tends to avoid viewing the world in such basic  terms, the sheer lunacy and severity of Chris' choices forced me from my  typical American viewpoint. Krakauer does an excellent job of not providing  closure to Chris' life and I left this book with a subtle sense of  obligation to find purpose in my own life.
0441003257|5.0|This was the best damned (no pun intended) book I've ever read.  It's  funnier than any movie I've ever seen.  I could not believe how much a book  could make one person laugh.  I embarassed myself in the most public places  laughing at this book.  From page one, there is nothing but pure Neil  Gaiman at his very best.  I cannot wait for this to be turned into a movie  so I can laugh at that too.
0345409671|1.0|Notice that the people who rate this book so highly (&quot;Best in this  century&quot; - Hah!) are also the people who say this is the first Anne  Rice book they ever read.<br />So why would so many people start a series a  number 5?  Because they heard it was a big load of psuedo-theological muck  that offends everyone.  They like that kind of stuff, so they seek it out.   Their review was written before they opened page one.  And what do they  praise?  Two things:  1) It  warps and distorts Christianity (and attacks  on Christians are always popular, count the number of instances of the  words 'religous right' and 'bible-thumper' in the review above to see for  yourself)  2) It has a distorted view of sexuality (as if oral sex during  menstration with a televangelist were somehow 'liberating')<br />The repeated  implication that people who hated this book just 'didn't get it' is  extremely stupid, and the attack on those who were offended as being  'closed-minded' is just as foolish.<br />The fact remains that the book was  just awful.  It failed as a VampChron because the characters and universe  were completely rewritten to be shaped around the agnostic diatribe that  composes the heart of the book.  It fails as literature because it was so  poorly written.  It fails as philosophy because it is nothing more than a  series of wild, unconnected, and inconsistent attacks based on a  misunderstanding of the faith which is being vilified.  It even fails even  as propaganda because it is so boring that it cannot even hold the  attention of the masses.<br />The thing that frightens me is the alarming  number of people who have posted that this book now forms the basis of  their moral faith (or at least an excuse for them to drop their previous  faith and embrace moral relativism).  Anne Rice as prophet?  Please  no!<br />If you read Nietzsche for entertainment (and are always looking for  more ammo to attack your friends who actually believe in something) then  this book is for you.  If you like complete sentences and a plot to go with  them, please stay far away.
B000000W5N|5.0|Anyone who is just begining to appreciate The Rolling Stones will quickly  be overwelmed with where to begin when it comes to starting a collection of  CD's.  Sticky Fingers is the standout CD any die hard Rolling Stones fan  will want to possess.  Recorded in 1971 (and w/ Andy Warhol's infamous  cover) it features classic \\"Stones\\" greats like Brown Sugar,  Bitch, Sister Morphine, and Dead Flowers (which were all featured in the  recent BTB Tour).  Sticky Fingers will surely inspire one to follow with  other great \\"Stones\\" efforts such as Bridges to Babylon, Steel  Wheels, Voodoo Lounge, Tattoo You, Some Girls, Goats Head Soup, and, of  course, Black and Blue.
B000003S09|5.0|I have known this group by my favorite Japanese singer who sang 'Epitaph'  on his stage, which was so beautiful, sad and enchanting. Now I listen to  the original songs by King Crimson on CD, and am impressed so much - it is  hard to believe that this song was produced almost 30 years ago!
0345423496|1.0|I keep hoping that this book would go somewhere or at leaste give you  something to think about. A best a poorly written unimaginative and already  done many times story.

0964385619|5.0|After reading this book, I decided to order copies for my 2 teenagers.   Mr. Kiyosaki has made the differences between assets and liabilities  exceptionally easy to understand. I wish I had had this book years ago.  In  my opinion this book should be used as a basic lesson in accounting.  Rich  Dad/Poor Dad definitely gets top rating with me.
B000002HRE|4.0|First Metallica album I actully purchased.  And was worth it.  I've heard  the other albums but never got real excited because there were only a few  songs that I liked listening to from each album.  Sorry you older fan don't  like the new one CD and feel cheated by the band.  If you ask me, it seems  like you're cheating them.
0399143904|2.0|I just completed Rainbow Six today and felt compelled to send out the  message far and wide to my fellow Clancy fans that aliens have apparently  abducted Mr. Clancy and left in his place an unemployed screen writer from  Hollywood!  How else can we explain Rainbow Six?<br />As with all of the  Clancy novels I picked up Rainbow Six the day it hit the streets.  I  trudged through the book wondering where had the Tom Clancy I have come to  know and love gone?  The story was uninspired, and lacked the depth of  technical insight and action that has made Clancy such a fun read. Every  previous Clancy novel has had an enjoyable balance between action and depth  of story. Each page I expected that the plot would thicken or the action  would pick up.  I finally gave up on this expectation at page 700. <br />There  is no sense in going on about this book.  It was ok, but, so far from the  caliber of the novels we expect from Mr. Clancy.  After Executive Orders  and all of the wonderful stories he has given us I can forgive R6, but,   please Mr. C come back and write a true Clancy novel.  I don't know if I  could stand another made for TV screen play reject.
0783801602|4.0|Good book, especially since it covers the inner workings of a  counter-terrorist team. (Isn't one of the major fantasies of American Males  to give the bad guys of the world what they deserve?) My only problem is  the plot line too closely resembles that of &quot;Executive Orders.&quot;
B000002I6T|5.0|Without a doubt this album epitomizes the easy and free-willed age of the  late 60s and early 70s.  Probably the best hippie-esque Gregorian chants  ever recorded.  A must have.
0345403959|5.0|I recently discovered David Eddings, and before I finished the first book,  I was at the library looking for others. This book wasn't the best he wrote  but very close. It answers all these questions about events that happened  thousands of years before Belgarion. It is rich in feeling and I could  hardly put it down. It is a wildly hilarious, witty story of Belgarath who  is one of my favorite characters. It also gives you a real insight to who  Belgarath is, and how he sacrificed himself for the Prophecy.
B000002JPA|5.0|This is one of the best cd's I know of DT. If you like a mix of rock and  some classic take this one.<br />Michiel
B000002HPV|4.0|This album is one of Bjork's best.  I thinky it's more electronic then  instrumental, but does not lack the beautiful quality of her outstanding,  and unique music.
0553573403|4.0|I was told by a friend to read this - he claimed that every chapter was  better than the previous.<br />This is a very complex book, and I can  sympathize with those who felt that their &quot;favorite&quot; character  was shorted, or for whom the number of characters was overwhelming.  Luckily for me, I endeavored to read this book quickly, and I found that I  did not lose the vast plot.<br />It is clearly set up for a long run - there  are at least three major plot points to resolve - although I must say that  Mr. Martin seems to be able to resolve extremely complex plots quite  quickly and in quite unexpected ways.  There is a lot to admire about an  author who will kill of a main character, instead of relying on some sort  of  annoying plot twist.  There is also a lot to admire about an author  who will spend multiple chapters building up what appears to be a character  and a sub-plot of amazing signifiance, and then suddenly kill the character  and end that plot immediately.<br />Highly recommended - but be prepared to  either read quickly or take notes.
6304873441|2.0|An unbalanced movie. Excellent score and story, good secondary characters,  impressive but impersonal computer generated backgrounds, poor villain  (including the white bat) and an antipathic heroine. The excessive use of  computer generated textures gave an artificial look for the movie. A  doubtful movie: it's a animated feature but looks like a full computer  generated movie. After all, it's a good work, but no more than it.     END
B000000WCX|4.0|What else has he to cover now? Opera? From the gut wrenching opener Little  Wonder through to the classic Dead Man Walking, and onto the weird souding  Telling Lies, Bowie proves he is as versatile as ever... Yet I feel the  album is shorn of that one classic track which all his fans would be  humming in 10 years time... nevertheless, a man for all seasons
B000002B38|5.0|I stopped listening to Pink Floyd about five years ago because I  &quot;burned out&quot; on them. I recently picked up this double disc set  and was at first disappointed: I didn't like the new songs, the audience  ambient noise annoyed me and I had this notion that Floyd sans Waters was  bad.<br />Boy was I wrong.<br />First of all, upon reflection and many hours of  going through their back catalogue of material, I realized that Waters was  not all he was cracked up to be. I've found that Gilmour more than often  saved an album with well-crafted songs with exquisitely poetic lyricism.  <br />Secondly, no expense -- monetary or effort-wise -- was spared in the  design, planning, production and performance on this double album. The  performances are top notch, the sonics are top notch, the packaging is  exemplary and quite stiking visually.<br />I have come to REALLY enjoy  everything about this set. The ambient crowd sounds are mixed in just right  -- not overbearing and completely fake like many other (so-called) live  albums -- to add a nice dimensionality to the recording. I have come to  REALLY enjoy many of their newer songs from &quot;The Division Bell,&quot;  especially &quot;High Hopes.&quot;<br />I would heartily recommend this disc  set to anyone.
0451169514|5.0|All of Steven Kings books are good but this is probably the best. I love  this book. A true depiction of what true friendship and courage can  overcome.
B000002G7E|5.0|Heh heh...this is a bloody amazing album.  After the departure of John  Cale the band kind of went downhill in my opinion, but this says it all.   Admittedly, you probably won't want to listen to The Gift repeatedly--it's  good for an incredulous laugh or two the first time, but it doesn't exactly  hold up to repeated listenings.  The rest of the album's good, but Sister  Ray is REALLY where it's at.  Can you name another Velvet Underground song  that was name-checked in a Final Fantasy game?  I don't think so.  It's  really simply stunning.  It'll take a few listenings to sort it out, but  it's quite the most amazing aural assault you're likely to experience.   Wow...
1573226521|4.0|This novel is captivating from start,downtown seedy Bangkok to finish, a  remote Thai island miles away from civilization.  Garland writes like he  knows what he's talking about--the find yourself youth travel culture and  the fine threads that keep a small group together or tear it apart.  This  novel charts the travels of a British male (Garland?) and two French  companions from backpacker row to an eerily familiar Lord of the  Flies-style remote island where pecking order will unite or destroy a  compelling group of characters.  A fabulous travel novel!
B000000WF0|4.0|I bought the album with fairly low expectations--rather predictably, all  I'd heard before was BSS, and I kind of had the feeling that, as with OK  Computer, I wouldn't like anything but The Big Single.  I was pleasantly  surprised, fortunately.  It isn't exactly an energetic album, but that's  not what it's about.  It's very hypnotic and trancelike; a good thing to  listen to as you're drifting off to sleep.  The songs have a tendency to  kind of blur together in my mind, but since nearly all of them are good,  that's not a bad thing.  Very nice.
B000002LK1|5.0|This album is a true gem and grows on you with each listen.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic is truly a one of a kind film.  The film is extremely accurate  technically as there are only a few historical flaws, and a few  chronological flaws.  The story of Jack &amp; Rose while fictional, brings  out  (and makes a statement about) the class distinctions of the time and  carries the viewer through the triumph and tragedy of the ship's short  life.  Without this story line, the movie would simply be another  documentary.  The only areas where the movie fails in my opinion are the  event's leading up to the building of the Titanic, the presence of the  Californian only 10 -19 miles away from Titanic at the time of its sinking,  and the immediate aftermath of the disaster.  Including these would,  however, make the movie about 4-5 hours long, but they're stories that need  to be told to the masses in my opinion.  The special effects are nothing  short of astounding.  The music bewildering.  The story triumphant yet  tragic.   The memory everlasting.     END
B000000WZ4|5.0|If you think depeche mode died after Alan left think again. This is DM at  it's best! Not to mention one of their best albums they've put out.
B000002KOJ|5.0|This is a wonderful album which preceeded her big hits but helped catalyse  her early career.  Her most popular song ever &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot;  is on this CD but perhaps preactively she put it last on the album so all  the other wonderful songs would be heard first.  An excellent piece of work  from an artist who would only mature more.
0684833395|5.0|This book has no organization, no real plot, just a plethora of strange  and demented people. I just loved it.  This one is a keeper.  It gets  funnier every time you read it.  I've read it at least four times, and  can't get tired of it.  Definately deserves to be above Brave New World in  the top 100 list. Keep in mind, in Chapter 39, the definition of Catch 22  is &quot;They have the right to do whatever we can't stop them from  doing.&quot;  That stands out better than Doc Daneeka's, but that seems to  stand out.
0140186409|5.0|Every epoch or so a book comes along that gives you a painful insight into  the nature of man in the face of suffering and the most abject of  circumstance.  &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is one of those books.<br />The  book exemplifies in each moment, between its powerful essays interlaced in  an intense story of survival and compassion in the face of the greatest  adversity.  Steinbeck defines the greatest elements of man, defining the  vital passion that separates him from his bestial predecessors.  And he  demonsrates his brilliance and the insurmountable power of his diction by  containing all the power and suffering that man must overcome in life with  the mere description of a turtle crossing the road.<br />I'm am a lover of  novels, perpetually immersing myself in books.  But of them all, this  shines as my favorite novel, and has changed my life in a way that I cannot  describe.
B00000DBXL|5.0|I've been anticipating this album for a mighty long time.  Cake's previous  two albums are amazing.  As much as I love Cake, my faith started to  crumble when I heard about the changes in the band - Greg Brown, who played  the guitar and wrote some of my favorite Cake songs, split, and if that  wasn't bad enough, the bassist was replaced.  I wasn't expecting much from  the band.  But that didn't stop me from running out to buy &quot;Prolonging  the Magic&quot; the second it came out.  And now I'm swarmed with guilt -  how could I have doubted the sounds of the best band in the world?  Cake is  singable, gushable, John McCrea's words have meaning.  This album is  perhaps better than the previous two - the band has matured, and the  changes haven't hampered their style.  They included many various guests  just add to the flavor.  Cake has a sound that is truly original - it can't  be compared.  The unusual guitar mixed with great trumpet solos, and a  voice that pierces through your body right to your soul -- it amazes me.   But the best thing about Cake is that there isn't a single bad song on any  of their CDs.  &quot;Where would I be?&quot; is probably my favorite, but  its a close tie with the perfection of the rest of this amazing CD.  The  world needs to support this band.
B000001EAQ|5.0|In an age where any album that sells or is popular has to be that crappy  excuse for music known as rap/hip-hop, thank God that U2 dare to put out a  dead perfect rock album.I really feal sorry for the youth of today, with  that trashy rap stuff consuming the shelves of Best Buy. Rock n roll is a  weapon,and U2 are it's wielders. Pop is an exuberant masterpiece by an  incredibly talented quartet. From the opening catchy guitar riffs of  'Discoteque&quot; to the sweeping balladry of 'If God will send his  Angels&quot;, to the lyrically stunning &quot;The Playboy Mansion&quot;, U2  both mock and embrace pop culture in a way no other band (or scrubby fad  aritists for that matter) could do. To this day, no one can write a song as  cleverly as Bono, and The Edge is the most inventive guitarist since Pink  Floyd's David Gilmour. Add to that Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen's  untouchable rythem section, and you have rock's finest band. Pop is the  best album by any artist since &quot;Zooropa&quot;, and no matter what any  brain dead critic says, U2 and that thing called rock will never go away.
B000000WCX|3.0|I bought this album only hearing part of the song &quot;I'm afraid of  americans&quot;. I knew it was techno based, but after listening to it, its  basically a rock lp with techno as the icing. Bowie has been better, and  being the rock and roll junkie that I am, this album just barely manages to  be listenable. But I give him credit for trying out new styles of music,  but lets face it-David Bowie and dance/techno are not the best mix. Give me  old Ziggy Stardust anyday.

0812931017|5.0|This is a great book!  I read an excerpt while in London and got it as  soon as it was available here.  I read it in 4 days, which is quite rapid  for me. <br />Richard Branson has lived an incredible life, and he details the  successes and failures in his business career and his personal endeavors.   <br />I think this book is highly entertaining and very useful to people  interested in bettering themselves.  Branson's business philosophy is  described through the work which opened my eyes to a number of  possibilites.<br />I only wish there was a volume two available that I could  look forward to reading.

0399143904|1.0|Quick synposis of the book:  Clancy builds bad guys out of straw and  shoots them in the head.    Poor characterization, zero character  development and a very predictable plot make _Rainbow_Six_ a tedious read.   The bad guys are written as just plain evil and seem to be a punching bag  for Clancy's political views.  The good guys have no flaws, are super  wonderful and never lose (or really even make mistakes).  Only  &quot;red-shirted&quot; ones we've never met get killed.  They seem to  solve all of their problems through lucky breaks and via direct revelation  from the author.  I'm expecting the next novel to be about evil, rabid,  Ebola-infected kittens which the Rainbow team will spend the novel running  over with steam rollers.  Clancy has done well before so I thought that the  awful _Executive_Orders_ might have been a fluke.  This one was even worse.   Maybe the problem is that Clancy is now so popular that he doesn't believe  in editors anymore.  _Rainbow_Six_ looks more like a draft than a published  novel.

I talked with Sylvia Browne  shortly afterword and she told me that Dad brought into this life, baggage  that he shouldnt have. that is a truth. I miss my mom so much, but i know  we will be together in our cluster, or our cone, or our kingdom. Come what  may. I am no longer afraid.

From the rock 'n roll sounds of What's The Story... to the psychedellic  epic that is Champaign Supernova, this is one of those few albums in which  each track could be released as a single.  A supreme achievement, and Liam  as I always thought proves that he is still one of the best male vocalists  in the industry.

B000000186|5.0|REVISED FOR 2010 APPLE/EMI REMASTER: \\"Straight Up\\" the band's best known and best selling album receives a strong remaster from the team that did the Beatles/Lennon/McCartney remasters at Abbey Road. This edition sounds a little more detailed than the DCC and has little to no noise reduction used on it (unlike the original Apple release on CD which was awash in noise reduction making it sound like a blanket had been thrown over the speakers). There is some compression applied to this but it doesn't sound as harsh as most modern remasters. Picky fans may or may not like some of the EQ choices by the mastering engineers here and some have complained it is a tad too bright (I don't think so) but I think this edition sounds fine and it is a strong alternate to the expensive DCC, infinitely superior to the original CD.<br /><br />We get new liner notes with comments about the troubled production of the album (the first edition was rejected, George Harrison came on board to work on the album as producer, had to leave and was replaced by Todd Rundgren who ultimately remixed or mixed the tracks that Harrison and original producer Geoff Emerick worked on)and how it turned into their biggest album producing two top 10 hits (\\"Baby Blue\\", \\"Day After Day\\" which features George Harrison playing slide with Pete Ham and Leon Russell on piano).<br /><br />The remaster is recommended. If you have the DCC you also might like this because it includes one previously unreleased song (although it has been available on bootlegs for years) the Tom Evans tune \\"Sing for the Song\\" which was originally slated for the first version of \\"Straight Up\\". The rest of the bonus tracks are the same as those found on the previous editions.<br /><br />ORIGINAL DCC GOLD DISC REVIEW:<br /><br />Most folks know the tragic story behind Badfinger(and if you don't I'd recommend picking up Dan Matovina's book WITHOUT YOU to discover more).<br /><br />This doesn't detract from the terrific music the band produced during their short, but productive peak period of 1970-1974. This album, along with NO DICE and WISH YOU WERE HERE represents the band at their best--melodic, riff driven power pop(similiar in style to contemporaries The Rasberries and Big Star).<br /><br />The sound is spectacular--this versions blows away the Apple/Capitol/Emi cd release(which always sounded compressed and muddy). DCC is to be commended and this remastered edition is worth every penny. The production by Todd Rundgren, George Harrison and Geoff Emerick (on the bonus tracks which were originally slated for release but re-recorded) is stellar.<br /><br />My only complaint--there are still two unissued tracks from the first version of STRAIGHT UP(the rest are represented here--alternative versions of songs on the final issued version). Also, while the liner notes are good, they are far from comprehensive in telling us who played what and the various inspiration for some of the outstanding songs.<br /><br />Straight Up ranks as one of the band's best albums (along with the criminally under rated Wish You Were Here). No Dice is an equally fine album with almost as many memorable songs and a slightly gritter sound than is found here. The gold edition still sounds the best of all the releases by this band. Steve Hoffman's remastering is terrific. One of the 100 best rock albums ever recorded, this is a great place to be introduced to the band and their unique sound.period of 1970-1974.

0688052304|3.0|This book is among the most problematical for me to assess.  On the one  hand, it seemed overwhelmingly &quot;honest&quot; to me when I first read  it.  On the other hand, I've read a great deal of philosophy since then,  and the initial book now seems trivial by comparison.  The book at least  provides stimulus to a reader's thoughts, but then once the reader has  grown, he may disavow the original catalyst.  The book is too serious for  the general reader but too lightweight for a serious student of philosophy.   The narrative of the cross-country motorcycle trip is alternately  compelling and lackluster.  The tone and style of writing is colloquial,  which may or may not agree with the reader.  Overall, then, I give the book  a three-star rating, mainly on account of its quality to stimulate the  general reader (and it is the general reader to whom the book is addressed)  into thinking about metaphysics and modern society.

B00000AFHM|5.0|The best alienated mellow boy pop since REM's Murmur. If you loved the  wishing chair by 10,000 maniacs and the good earth by the feelies and the  debut from the Smiths and Perfect Prescription by Spaceman 3 and REM's  Murmur, you MUST get this CD. Belle &amp; Sebastian are the real thing. The  best music in this genre in over 10 years. A masterpiece. An absolute  masterpiece.

B000001FMQ|1.0|Crazy Nights was Kiss' lame attempt at sounding like such  &quot;juggernauts&quot; as Poison and Great White.  Why the band moved into  this weak direction was beyond me.  Every song in this album sounds the  same and is limp.  I am so glad that Kiss does not put this material out  anymore.
0899663036|5.0|Recently, AMC showed the movie based on this book. I had read the book  many times when I was Francie's age, but had never seen the movie. Seeing  the movie led me back to the book, which I had not read in twenty  years.<br />What a wonderful experience I had in meeting the Nolans all over  again. There were parts of the book that had been tucked in my memory, i.e.  the part where Francie decides to read all the books in the library in  alphabetical order. Every time I go to the library, I have that same idea.  I just had forgotten where I first got the idea. It was like a light bulb  illuminating a dusty part of my brain.<br />Katie Nolan has become an even  more important part of the story to me now. I think this was helped by  Dorothy McGuire's exquisite performance as practical Katie. Being a mother  of two myself, I appreciate the way Smith captured the gradations of  Katie's feeling towards each child and her inability to express them to the  children themselves.<br />Goota go; my copy of MAGGIE-NOW is calling to me.
B000001FQQ|1.0|This album has absolutely no original songs in it.  Kiss hit its low point  with this album and the previous album.  Ace Frehley plays &quot;Hide Your  Heart&quot; more like Kiss than Kiss does.  Another low point in this  band's existance.
B000002KAT|5.0|The most phenomenal moving experience one can ever have is listening to  this recording from start to finish.

There is great vocal, instrument and arrangement work, it does  feel like a complete record. The Pet Shop Boys always surprise me, their  music is less self-righteous, more commercial, without compromising their  indistinguishable style.

1570422052|1.0|If Amazon would offer an unabridged audio version of this book, then maybe  I could give it at least two stars.  I have not read the entire unabridged  novel yet, but I read enough of it to know that this short audio version  cannot do any kind of justice to the original work, whether one likes it or  not, because only a tiny fraction of the original material is represented.   In fact, so much has been taken out that the story as it appears on this  tape doesn't even make sense.  To judge what bit of the story I could hear  on this audio edition, I actually thought it was pretty silly.  Many of the  characters seemed annoying, particularly Guinevere.  Many of these  characters whined a lot and were irritatingly overly dramatic.  That is not  to say that characters should be stoic; on the contrary, I do want to see  passion, but the way passions were expressed was laid on so thick as to  make me kind of sick.  The Arthur character seemed awfully weak for a high  king; he allowed his annoying wife to nag and hen-peck him; you just want  to slap him and tell him to be more assertive!  Another problem I had with  this book (and I know that saying this will bring criticism onto myself --  maybe some of it desereved, too) was the way that it was so very  unhistorical.  I know that it doesn't need to be historical since it is  fiction, but there is something about her approach which keeps making me  think that she is trying to write a historical novel, but all it really is  is a romantic fantasy.  Since I am really only reviewing the short audio  version here, it may be unfair for me to drag this in, but I did read her  introduction at the beginning of the printed novel, and she makes it sound  like a lot of historical research went into it:  she consulted with my  favorite Arthurian historian, Geoffrey Ashe; she sites my one of my  favorite Arthurian archaeologist/historians Leslie Alcock's  Cadbury-as-Camelot theory; and so on, making me think that this is a  well-researched historical novel, and then when I get to the story, I want  to get a red pen out and write words like &quot;incorrect&quot; and  &quot;highly improbable&quot; all over it.  Both Arthurian fiction and  Arthurian history alike are very controversial, so much so that it becomes  like religion.  People have these strange emotional needs to believe that  things were a certain way even when the evidence is quite against it.  My  point here is that if people enjoy this story and are deeply moved and  inspired by it, then that is wonderful, but as a history buff, it saddens  me to see that people will latch on to fantastical ideas and then believe  that fifth and sixth-century Britain were really like this.  Even Geoffrey  Ashe (the historian whom Bradley consulted when she began work on this  book) commented on _Mists of Avalon_ when he graciously sent me a personal  reply to a fan letter I sent him, saying that &quot;Arthuian Britain  couldn't have been anything like that.&quot;  I might note here that  Bradley's use of the word &quot;Merlin&quot; as a title is patently  unhistorical an indefensible.  This is no place for me to go into the  origin and etymology of the name &quot;Merlin,&quot; but I can assure you,  despite wide-spread popular belief, that it was never anyone's title.  And  no matter how much one may want to believe that the ancient Celts made the  Mother Goddess their cheif deity, and no matter how much one may want to  believe that there was a powerful college of druidesses at Ynys Afalach  (Glastonbury) when Arthur was alive, let me assure you that this is  fantasy, not history.
B0000028WD|5.0|Growing up being a big fan of the Bryds, how could one not enjoy listening  to Dylan played by some of the worlds finest musicians. There has never  been a better rendition of Mr. Tambourine Man. My Back Pages with Bob  Dylan, Roger McGuinn, Tom Petty, Neil Young, Eric Clapton, George Harrison  is also something special.<br />Stevie Wonder gets carried away with his intro  to Blowing in the Wind, but fast forward 2&amp;1/2 minutes and you will  miss the only misery of this CD. The end of this double CD has Dylan  singing. It makes you appreciate how special his music is when sung by  these top performers. It also shows off what Dylan does best - song  writing.<br />Wanna hear Dylan with an Irish accent? Buy the CD. I can't think  of a better way to spend 2 hours in the car. I own over 500 CD's and this  one is my favorite.
044651506X|5.0|I don't know what planet a couple of my fellow reviewers are on--the  couple of folks who hated this book. I live right where it supposedly took  place and the locations are very accurate. The main character has a  terrific style you may recognize and feel a kinship for if you've been out  there in the workforce for 20 or so years and have been around the block a  few times. You see, when you've been dealing with people for a long time  you get to spot personality types and have a very good feel for human  nature. Peoples egos, how they will react to how you craft what you say,  etc. It's precisely this ability that Plum Island's main character, the  detective uses to size-up the personalities he encounters in a very canny  and funny way. He handles his superiors in law inforcement as deftly as the  snooty lady from the historical society. And it's the detective's style of  dialogue that helps makes Plum Island so good. However, buy the book  instead of the audio cassette version. When they picked what to abridge for  the cassette version, they picked most of this wonderful dialogue. And they  removed the tour of Plum Island's labs, which you need to know about to get  a real feel for what they do there. I loved it. The only place that isn't  real by name is the Olde Towne Taverne...it's actually called Cliff's Elbow  Room. Living here, I can't tell you how many collegues from around the  country have called to ask about the locales from Plum Island. They all  enjoyed it, too, to a person. Sorry a couple of others hated it so much,  maybe they should have been out walking their rat.
B00000AFFF|5.0|A stupendous collaboration between Costello and Bacharach.  The haunting  lyrics serve as the foundation for this album, but the piano work, along  with input from Johnny Mandel will stand forever as a masterpiece in my  extensive CD collection.  Caution must be used when listening to this album  however.  Quite simply, its practically a cantata about the malingering  effects of unrequited love.   Damn music made me start smoking  again.....great album, really.  Goes well with multiple shots of Bourbon.
0393317552|5.0|Excellent, essential and very revealing ! Read &quot;The Third  Chimpanzee&quot; before you start this one...

B000002HHB|4.0|I love this CD!  My favorite song is &quot;Where I Go&quot;.  I can't help  but have my spirits soothed.  &quot;Wonder&quot; is my other favorite song.   It is a great self-esteem builder and makes you realize how special you  really are.  This CD is great to just relax to and make you feel better  about yourself.  You have to get it.
0446605409|4.0|Nelson DeMille is one of the true novelists. He writes novels and not  novelised scripts, neither novels for scripts. This one is a pure detective  story with noir hints as to the description of his characters, while  turning into an adventure some- where at the end and falling into a trap  for this latter (we'll speak about it later). Taking into consideration the  above, his plot is not original as conceived, but with some interesting  twists and uncovered slowly. In some points though he seems widening and  becomes very slow, but his reasons are character wise, not that we readers  can't pin- point this chatter. From a point an on (the ending chapters) the  plot becomes &quot;how will it end&quot; and not &quot;what is going to  happen now&quot; since the adventure element takes away the unexpected. As  to his characters, the main hero is mostly illumina- ted and you come to  love him: he's cynical, humo- tous, macho and most masculine, hidding very  well his sensitive side, trying to resemble Mickey Spi- laine's Mike  Hammer, thus the noir element. Then the most attention is given to the  women charact- ers and finally all the others become decorative characters,  receiving from the author the respect- ive attention. Characterisations are  deep but vey much focused. And DeMille's speech is of a pure novelist:  picturous but not overburdened and to the point, witty at times and real.  The reader is not tired by the speech, but by the widening (as  aforementioned). So, the scenes flow, not fastly, but flow; the tempo being  also of a noir (novel or film if you prefer). The trap that Demille falls  is of the &quot;adventure couples&quot;: the sidekick never stands aside  and appears like an ancient Greek tragedy God to save his friend/mate. It  is a very complete book, a tru novel, but these minor de- tails, fail it  from being a perfect book. An it is a pity for DeMille, who shows exactly  what he can achieve by his writting.
B000005S37|1.0|somehow i knew there'd be a few dorks who give this album 5 stars and  claim to enjoy it. i can understand that. i like crap as well as the next  guy. if something is awful but has a decent amount of originality or  creativity, it makes my list. this thing sure don't. as a middle finger to  fans, critics, and record company alike, this was a truly ballsy punk thing  to release. but come on, lou clearly didnt spend more than an hour making  this crap. i can respect his making and even releasing it, but there's no  way in hell i'm gonna put money in his pocket to OWN it. there's a whole  lotta more listenable tripe out there to waste your hard earned cash on  than this. the fools who said they loved it are posers who read lester  bangs' gushing (yet brilliant) essay about it and wanna join the out crowd.  packa nerds.
0812550706|5.0|Best book I have ever read.  I have read it 3 times already.  This book is  about a boy who has to save the world from aliens.
B000000W5L|5.0|Definitely an album that you want to be stranded with on a desert island.  Not as commercial as some of the Stones other releases except maybe for  Tumbling Dice.  The Stones explore new styles and perform them very well.  Rocks Off is a great song with gritty guitars, piano, and vocals.  Shine A  Light is an especially great tune with its gospel setting and the neat  underwater effect on the guitar solos by Mick Taylor.  Even some of the  weaker numbers have strong moments like the saxaphone solo by Bobbie Keys  on Casino Boogie.  An absolute purchase.
B000001DTM|5.0|This is an album on the verge of the band's major turn. The band became  more mature and less radical, but never stopped exlporing new stuff. Once  you get it, you'll discover what a fine line is all about!
0399142851|1.0|I've read some of the ellegantly worded reviews already, and I feel I'll just be repeating what the sharp and savy people on this website have already commented on about U.N.  Mind you, This was my first introduction to Pat Cornwell's work ... and let's just say that it was not a complimentary one.  Her main Dr. character is too tiring to follow, like some butch dyke superwoman is what I got as an immediate overall impression.  And, yeah, the book was way too technical for the level of interest the story really was able to sustain, plus the autopsy and landfill descriptions were definitely far too gross to serve the author up any further accolades as a substantive writer.  I had to drop the book back off at the library after the fifth chapter, as I was getting bone weary and irritated with following the antics of this phrenetic, sexually frustrated, borderline psychotic main character.  I mean, I work a private job that gets public more than I care to have happen, and I too have to occasionally root around in filthy trash to look for missing radioactive sources.  But that doesn't mean I feel to need to ply others with a slop-by-slop description of my experiences.<br />Observation: From other reviews that I've read concerning her other novels, it appears that P.C. is an uneven writer, and is allowing a favorite main character to grow into a nasty bitch that perhaps better belongs in a women's prison for the elitist, sexist, and aggressively haughty.  I don't believe I wish to follow the baby buggy-type bouncy mood swings in such an author's work. (Makes me want to reach for the ibuprofen.)  END
B000002N3N|4.0|Memory Of Trees definitely sounds like any other Enya CD you have heard.   The trademark sound remains intact from the days of Watermark.  Not much  has changed, other than the fact that these songs are a bit weaker than  those on her previous two albums.<br />Don't get me wrong.  I own all of  Enya's CDs, from the Celts on up to this one, and including some extra  stuff like her version of &quot;Silent Night.&quot;  While Enya definitely  sticks to one style, it is an incredibly GREAT style, and I buy every one  of her albums.  I was not sorry I spent the money on Money Of Trees.  It is  a wonderfully enchanting album, as are all of her albums.<br />But still, the  other side of the coin is the feeling that I am not hearing anything new  here, and the melodies just aren't quite as angelic and beautiful as her  previous works.  If you are an Enya fan like me, though, you can safely  forget these quibbles and buy this album without regrets.
B00000AFFI|5.0|This is definitely my favorite album that I've purchased in a long time  and is almost as great as &quot;To Bring You My Love.&quot; &quot;Dance  Hall...&quot; was not nearly as good and this album has such a variety that  you cannot stop listening to it. &quot;Angelene&quot; is one of the  greatest openers to an album that I've heard in a long while, &quot;The Sky  Lit Up&quot; is so catchy and quick, that it will be repeated often.  &quot;My Beautiful Leah&quot; is so eerie with the background of a dark  bass humming and &quot;A Perfect Day Elise&quot; is nearly perfect.  &quot;Joy&quot; and &quot;No Girl So Sweet&quot; have backgrounds that  sound equivalent to those of Nine Inch Nails, but no song is as scary as  &quot;My Beautiful Leah&quot;, which is so haunting, that you will be  hooked. Also, &quot;Angelene&quot; sounds like a song that would be a  chart-topper. This album is wonderful. It would be an understatement to  call this album &quot;PJ's Second Best&quot;. Great for any listener, but  especially PJ fans. It ranges from techno-beats, to the slow strumming of  an acoustic guitar along with a piano. Truly captivating. A+.
1572810408|4.0|The classic Tarot of Marseilles may be just that -- a historical classic  -- but it bores the heck out of many people with its rigid woodcut images.   This tarot deck captures the historical aura of the Marseilles, but  features much better art.  The artist has gently captured the feeling of  the Old English countryside in these images, researched from primary  documents.  Although none of the cards strike home the way decks with more  modern artwork approaches do, it still gives you a sense of the history of  the deck and discards most of the &quot;magickal&quot; detritus the decks  picked up in the twentieth century.  As in Brian Williams' excellent  Renaissance Tarot,  the cards have here returned to their true origin in  the archetypes of European medieval and renaissance culture.
B000006NPY|4.0|I love this album- combo of techno with rock.  Yes, it's different from  their other albums, but that's what makes them artist.  They constantly  redefine themselves.  Note that this album was produced the Flood who also  produced albums by Depeche Mode and others.  So, I suspect he had an  influence.
0880794968|4.0|Mary Hanson-Robert's coloring of the famous Waite-Smith images provides a  more soothing and eye-pleasing alternative to the often drab colors of the  popular Rider-Waite version.  Some may find these colors too soft, but I  find this deck quite striking, and you don't have to give up the intuitive  and easy to read images of the Waite-Smith system.  Great for beginners --  skip the Rider-Waite and grab this deck when you want to learn Tarot.
B000002UAU|5.0|Deserves to be called the greatest pop album ever. One interesting thing I  find about it is that Paul told John it was time to make an album. So John  had only 10 days to write his songs for this album. And so he had to scrape  for material by walking around his house. And the results were John's  masterpieces on this album. LUCY IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS he got from his  son bringing home a picture he drew in school with that title. BEING FOR  THE BENEFIT OF MR. KITE was taken from a circus poster John had hanging on  a wall. GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING he got from watching a Kellogg's corn  flakes commerical on TV. A DAY IN THE LIFE John got from reading that day's  paper. He didn't have to climb Everest, or hike through the Sahara desert  to get material to create great art. He got material for great art by  wandering around his house! And in only ten days, too! I think those facts  make the brilliance of this album all the more brilliant. Paul's and  George's songs are certainly brilliant, too. And if anyone thinks that the  Beatles would have been as great without Ringo, listen to the drumming in A  DAY IN THE LIFE. Those drums MAKE that song...one of the greatest songs of  all.

0679720200|3.0|Many readers ackowledge the quality of Camus' writing but question the  truth of existentialist philosophy.  Maybe this is because existentialism  is approached by some as they might approach a theology: as a description  of the absolute truth of existence or even a prescription for how one  should live.<br />As a devout Christian, I find these works to be valuable  illustrations of what happens to the person who cannot transcend his  neuroses via spiritual catharsis (see C.S. Lewis for such remedies). The  best lessons are learned from reflecting on ideas we find adverse to our  own.<br />The thoughtful reader must find Marsault to be a singularly  unpitiable character. One of many object lessons I take from The Stranger  is that to be preoccupied with oneself is to place one's soul in peril. Its  a sad story that perhaps could have been told with more depth if Camus were  more novelist and less philosopher. A good book; I would buy it again.
B000026156|5.0|I originally bought the LP of this in early 1974, having heard Holland,  Altschul, and Braxton in Chick Corea's band Circle, and of course knowing  Holland's work on some highly conspicuous Miles Davis recordings (In a  Silent Way, Bitches Brew...). I bought CotB under the impression that I  knew what I was getting myself into. I'd been wrestling with atonality for  awhile -- late Coltrane, Schoenberg, whatever I could find that seemed  reasonably &quot;important.&quot; I was not getting it. I had the youthful  faith that there was something worthwhile happening inside all that  cacophony, but I needed a Rosetta Stone to make sense of it.  &quot;Conference of the Birds&quot; was my Rosetta Stone. From the opening  bars of &quot;Four Winds&quot; I was completely captivated. It swings hard,  the improvisations are always coherent -- no matter how frenzied and  dissonant they sound, and Holland's compositions are outstanding. The title  song is a beautiful folk ballad that makes a perfect breather amid the  fiery uptempo rants and cryptic, avant garde soundscapes. This record was  the best education my ears ever had. Even though I now have it on CD, I  still have my battered vinyl copy of CotB, and hold onto it for purely  sentimental reasons.<br />Holland is without question one of the greatest  living jazz artists, and no bassist except Charles Mingus has ever matched  his all-around musicianship. I think Holland's output on ECM has been very  consistent over the quarter-century he's been recording for them, so it  might seem unfair to call this the best recording to ever come out under  his name, but he's never really topped this. Check out all of them, but if  you like CotB in particular you should also listen to the Dave Holland/Sam  Rivers duet records, particularly Volume One. Also, his solo cello CD,  &quot;Life Cycle&quot; contains his best collection of compositions.<br />To  me, this disc is the jazz equivalent of a Bartok string quartet, and in my  book, itdoesn't get any better than that.
B000000OAN|5.0|Queen's &quot;A Night At The Opera&quot; is to the seventies what The  Beatles' &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; was to the  sixties. A well written, well made work that continues to rock the world 23  years after it's release. It has something for everybody! The venomous,  heavy metal of &quot;Death On Two Legs (Dedicated To...)&quot;, the sweet  ballad &quot;Love Of My Life,&quot; and Freddie Mercury's magnum opus  &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody.&quot; Mercury utilizes his operatic, as well as  his rock voice. Brian May shows why he is up there with Clapton and Page,  while Roger Taylor gives Keith Moon and John Bonham a lesson at the skins.  The unsung hero of the album is John Deacon, he takes Paul McCartney and  Chris Squire's title of the greatest bassist in rock and roll. All and all  Queen produces a set that surpasses even Led Zeppelin's classic  &quot;IV&quot; album.
B000002MU3|5.0|Rem Came up with a winner here. They have come up with a compalation of 12  totally new totally rock songs. From the first chord of &quot;What's the  Frequency Kenneth&quot; to the closing feedback of &quot;You&quot; this  album will keep you rocking. The album is topped of with Stipe's tribute to  his good friend the late Kurt Cobain. The song &quot;Let Me In&quot; is  garenteed to leave a impression on you. Personally I think that this album  secured REM as one of the greatest bands of the modern era.
0553270435|5.0|I first got this book when I was 11 yrs. old.  It was required reading  along with other books from my Karate Instructor.  It completely change  everything, especially  the way I look at the world and myself.  It helps  me to keep learning; the book has a new  meaning everytime.  It would be  great for people to get together and keep learning what Dr. Murphy started.
B0000039QA|5.0|I think LIFE AFTER DEATH is the greatest rap CD ever came out. It is  filled with styles from Bone Thugs to Puffy. Normally a CD only has one or  two good songs, but every single selection in this double CD is the BOMB!
B000003B6J|5.0|This is a hip hop essential. No one can claim to know the essence of rap  music without hearing this.
B0000019PA|5.0|It's funny to come here and see this review, which I wrote 10 years ago.  An intervening decade has only deepened my appreciation for this record.  I still listen to it all the time.  -----  This is a stunningly original, powerful record that reveals its many gifts  over many listens.  The images in the lyrics are not only haunting and  surreal, they subtly echo one another from song to song, as do scraps of  melody and rhythm.      I've never heard a record that was at the same time  so earnest and so deeply strange:  Mangum is playing around a lot in these songs, but it's serious play.    For all the wild orchestration (the bizarre appearance of the uillean pipes at the beginning of the untitled tenth  track makes me laugh out loud), the finest songs on this record are the two  where Mangum sings accompanied only by guitar, in a voice piercing and  tender, passionate and surreal.    This is one of the best records of the last decade.
B000006E4C|4.0|This CD is a musical &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;: nothing happens. Yet  in that aura of nothingness is the entrancing secret of Reich's music. This  music works on a subconscious level, washing over the listener and drawing  the listener into its spell. Brilliantly intoxicating, this album is a must  for anyone who is interested in the world of ambient music.
B000002LK1|5.0|&quot;Policy of Truth,&quot; &quot;Personal Jesus,&quot; &quot;World in My  Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; are the best tracks  (especially &quot;Silence&quot;). The entire album is filled with the very  stuff of Depeche Mode, dark, mysterious, yet upbeat and musical. What more  needs to be said? This is one of the best albums Depeche Mode has ever  produced, and is ranked up there with &quot;Ultra,&quot; &quot;Black  Celebration,&quot; and &quot;Songs of Faith and Devotion.&quot; Definitely  worht listening.
B000002UAU|4.0|Musically, I don't find this to be the Beatles best album. Most  influential, perhaps. It is a good album though and everyone should hear  it.
0964385619|5.0|This author presented how to achieve finacial success from a lifelong  study of his real,&quot;Poor Dad&quot; and his friend's &quot;Rich  Dad&quot;. Finally the truth that education is not just teaching but  learning for yourself and making mistakes while following someone who truly  has reached financial success and not just teaching the practical knowledge  without personal experience. This is a true entrepreneurial guide to  finacial success that goes against most &quot;teaching&quot; today.  Congradulations ,Robert Kiyosaki!!
0399143904|1.0|As a die hard Tom Clancy fan from his first book on, how disappointing it  was to discover this re-hash of Clancy standard themes that is mostly fill.  I have my doubts if he did all the writing himself -- it smacks of  pay-by-word. The plot has absolutely NO credibility and is slightly silly  that he would ask us to suspend belief to this degree. Clancy was an  embarrassment on the Larry King Live show. He seemed to have absolutely  nothing to say -- just like his latest book.
0316286869|5.0|I loved this book!!!  I refer to it all the time.  I am a makeup junkie  and I am always looking to try new things and this book has given me the  courage and the amunition to do just that!! I have played with looks and  colors that I would not have ordinarily and now I swear by false eyelashes  when I need that extra touch of diva glamour.<br />Thanks Kevyn for such a  wonderful book!!!
B000002UAX|5.0|I think this one's the best Beatles album, and certainly one of the best  albums ever. The songs encompass a wide variety of styles. Hell, even Ringo  managed to write a clever one. You gotta hear this.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|A great starting point for anyone who's interested in hearing some others  of Collins' songs besides &quot;Sussudio&quot; and &quot;In the Air  Tonight&quot;.  My one complaint is that two of my favorite Phil Collins  songs are noticibly absent (&quot;Everyday&quot; and &quot;Don't Lose My  Number&quot;) while &quot;Both Sides of the Story&quot; is found in their  place.  Of course, the rest of the choices are excellent, especially  &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; and &quot;Two  Hearts&quot; A fun CD to listen to.
B00000BIBQ|5.0|I have owned this album for twenty years, and it is one of my most prized  possessions. They out Beatle the Beatles, and they do it while keeping  their hard rock qualifications. It is a roller coaster ride of dynamics and  harmony.
0002171856|4.0|Too bad this book isn't really &quot;handbook&quot; sized!  It would be a  great companion to any outdoor expedition if it weren't such a large book.   However, the information inside is invaluable.  Read it, memorize it, and  read it again!  It could literally save your life!
B0000028WD|4.0|I had the great honor of attending this concert and even getting backstage  for a brief period. It was great. I actually don't have the album, but it's  burned in my memory.The performances that really blew everyone away at the  time were Stevie Wonder (who was unannounced ahead of time) Eddie Vedder  (who was just beginning to get really famous) and Neil Young, who just tore  the roof down. I have never seen anything like it in a big hall since. And  to see George Harrison live was incredible too. I don't think he had played  live in the U.S. in at least 15 years prior, and I'm not sure if he has  since. The only part that was a letdown was the All-Star Jam at the end. It  was a mess. Those things always are. They should be illegal. Definitely  something worth owning. Who else could receive a tribute with such a  diverse range of artists, yet they all seem to belong there?
0812550706|5.0|I've lost track of how many times I've bought and given away copies of  Ender's Game. It remains my favorite not because of the grand scale of the  military sci-fi elements, but because of the grand scale of the emotions of  the characters. <br />Skimming through the reviews, I see that no one else has  commented much on the relationship between Ender and his sister Val. Their  love and devotion for each other across space and time can bring tears to  my eyes, and has instilled in me a longing for such a sister which I have  never been able to shake.<br />This is the power of Card's writing - the  ability to describe the experiences and emotions of his characters so  clearly and powerfully that we can feel them as our own, and incorporate  them as meaningful elements in our own lives.
B000002J2B|5.0|This is the second and last studio album Genesis made after losing  singer/flute player Peter Gabriel, and before losing guitarist Steve  Hacket.  This was a very creative period for Genesis (please see my  five-star review of _Trick of the Tail_) which featured not only amazing  lyrics (which often stand on their own as stories and poems -- many of  these by keyboardist Tony Banks), but also a great range of accoustic and  electronic sounds.  If you like variety, as I do, then you will probably  find the range of moods, tempos, and styles both impressive and refreshing.   Several of the songs are longer than most pop songs you would hear on top  40 radio, so it's got that epic rock feel.  Some tunes are instrumental,  and the vocal tracks, as on the previous album, show Phil Collins to be a  different singer than Pete, but arguably just as good in his own way.  Like  it's predicessor, this album ballances the heavy with the light, the bass  with the treble.  Mike Rutherford's bass lines continue to be powerful and  Phil's drumming is fantastic as all get-out.  At the same time, Steve and  Tony perform masterful melodies on top of compariatively complex chord  changes.
0399143904|5.0|Tom Clancy is at his suspense filled best. This time I really ask myself  how'er they (Clark &amp; Ding) going to get out of this one?  This makes  Flash Gordon, Tom Mix, Hoppalong Cassidy and John Wayne look like pikers!  If I had to pick which book was the most thrilling of the decade, I would  have said The Firm, until I read Rainbow Six. I found myself yelling at a  book! ...Look  out!  ...Duck! Get the long un-abridged version ...it's the  only way to out Clancy, Clancy.
B000002J29|5.0|After loosing singer/flute player Peter Gabriel, the remaining members of  Genesis (keyboardist/guitarist Tony Banks, percussionist/singer Phil  Collins, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford, and guitarist Steve Hacket)  thankfully decided to stick together and made two impeccable studio albums  (I gave _Trick of the Tail_ and _Wind and Wuthering_ five stars each).   This excellent live album is Hacket's last performance with them before  quitting.  Genesis is one of the best live acts around; they are tight,  polished, proffesional, and exciting.  Since Phil's show-biz sense told him  to perform his vocals mostly at the front of the stage (even though he was  pefectly able to sing and drum at the same time), this album allows you to  hear two other great drummers in addition to Phil:  Bill Bruford (Yes, King  Crimson, UK) plays on one track, and Chester Thompson (Weather Report,  Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention) plays on the rest.  You also get  to hear Phil play along with these other drummers during instrumental  passages and the result is fantastic.  It's a double album so there is  plenty to listen to.  They even dedicate a whole album side to a  twenty-minute masterpiece called &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; which  originally appeared a few years earlier on their _Foxtrot_ studio album.   It's kind of funny to hear Phil sing that one, because it was originally  sung by Pete (who wrote most or all of those particular lyrics) who really  expressed a battle of good vs. evil in some passages, while Phil's style of  expressing those same passages can sound very Vegasy, like Peter Allen  fronting the Rocketts or something, but you can't fault Phil technically --  he sings on key and (what else would you expect from a great drummer) has  impeccable rhythm sense.  This album features that trademark deep, full  Genesis sound that their fans love, with the keyboards being supplemented  by the string players' use of bass pedals.  The technical crew did a great  job ofcapturing the sound in a live setting, so the songs sound at least  as good as they did in the studio, but with the extra exitement that comes  with live performance.  Even the audiences at these shows were great; they  would shut-the-heck-up during the music and then burst into ecstatic  applause and cheers between songs.  The guitar and keyboard solos are among  the most beautiful I've ever heard captured on record.  I highly recomend  this album.
0441172717|5.0|Plots within plots within plots...  You'll never look at a glass of water  the same again.
B000002J27|5.0|Genesis has made many wonderful albums, some with Peter Gabriel, and some  without him.  This was the first one they made after he left them.  Every  song on this album is great, but they do not all sound the same -- and  praise the Lord for that!  There are fairly heavy pieces of rock, and there  are pretty ballads; some passages are vocal, some are just instrumental.   It is as much a credit to these guys as composers and poets as it is to  their abilities as performers.  Mike Rutherford is an awesome bass player,  and he also makes good use of guitar and bass pedals.  Steve Hacket is a  versitile virtuoso of both accoustic and electric guitars.  This was Phil  Collins' sixth album with Genesis, and on it he not only continues to be a  drummer/percussionist of staggering ability, expression, and taste, but he  also proves to be a singer who can express a great range of moods and  emotions.  Tony Banks, who was cheif song writer on this album, is both a  brilliant poet of song lyrics, and one of the most wonderful keyboard  composers and performers around in both accoustic and electronic media.  If  you like a variety of sounds, moods, emotions and styles, nice,  full-sounding arrangements, and strong melodies (both vocal and  instrumental) then I think this album is for you.
B000002VSN|4.0|Here it is: the gospel album she's discussed for years- and it is every  bit as good as we hoped it would be!<br />The Spirit moves while she wails  &quot;I Go To The Rock&quot;! And for secular love songs &quot;I Believe in  You and Me&quot; stands among her classics. Friends join her on  &quot;Somebody Bigger Than You and I&quot; and it satisfies the soul.  <br />A  couple of weak cuts by Babyface and Diane Warren keep this from 5 stars,  but this CD is a keeper!<br />Give us more gospel!
0812550706|4.0|With so many reviews on this fine work, there is little I can add, but  I'll give it a shot.  Orson Scott Card's `Ender's Game' is thoroughly  enjoyable and an easy read for both adults and young adults.  Card doesn't  fall into the `lavish and overwrought description syndrome' as do some  authors, thus, the novel is well-paced, easily accessible, highly  entertaining, and at times, packs an emotional wallop.  It is imaginative,  unique, and carries a very satisfying plot twist.<br />Much has been said  about the dialogue of young children...that Card totally missed it and  doesn't understand children.  While I concur to a certain degree, it did  not diminish my enjoyment of the novel.  Who am I to say that children in  the far future with astronomical IQ's wouldn't act, think, or talk that  way?  Would it have been a better novel if Card spent a little more time  viewing and talking to children whose mind is at the genius level?  It may  have had more depth if he explored this dichotomy further, but with a Hugo  and Nebula award, as well as a fanatical following, I doubt it would have  made any significant difference.<br />Here is a novel that can be read in a  day and will be remembered for years.  For those who don't read sci-fi, I  would highly recommend this book as a great place to start.  For those who  do read sci-fi, and haven't read `Ender's Game', I can only wonder and ask;  why haven't you read it!?  Between 1 and 10, I give `Ender's Game' an 8  (and a high 8 at that).
6302054230|5.0|As one can always expect from Python, a movie that is outrageous on the  surface, but also outrageous in its very depths. Those who know nothing of  Rome or Christianity will laff themselves silly. So too will those who do.     END
B000004286|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks that I have ever  heard.I truly enjoy it.When I listen to it, it sets a mood and sends my  mind soaring.I consider it as spazzy as the movie.This one is a great  accomplishment!I reccomend it to the sentimental and &quot;warm and  fuzzy&quot; personality types.
0446364495|1.0|A friend recommended this book, trembling as she handed it to me.  She  thought it was the best thing she'd read in years, and she told me with  tears in her eyes.<br />Of course there are male authors that can describe  what a woman feels and be pretty close.  But I felt this book was too  obviously a man's speculation and probably hope of how a woman would feel  in reading the story.  In short I was annoyed because I felt manipulated  and patronized.
B000002C1Z|5.0|I love this CD.  However Pigs on the Wing does sound alot like Wish you  were here. But this is an absolutely amazing album.
B00000DLUV|5.0|After attending the &quot;One Night Only&quot; concert at Wembley Stadium  on Sep. 5, 1998, I was able to purchase the CD in London on the 7th.  I've,  therefore, had a 2 month headstart on the enjoyment provided by this album.   30 years later and still going strong.  Its a must have for any Bee Gees  fan.
0887306101|5.0|Schwager's book uses an interview format to delve into the methods and personalities of top traders. Under Schwager's intelligent and acute questioning, some of the best traders of the 1970s and 80s reveal a multitude of trading tactics and strategies, as well as emphasising the importance of mental approach and personality. Despite one or two weak interviews, and the odd moment when Schwager's writing style begins to grate, this book really stands head and shoulders above all the other trading literature out there. The calibre of the traders is extremely high, several having turned small grubstakes into fortunes of over $100 million within 10-15 years. The material is wide ranging, from floor-traders/scalpers, through medium-term commodity speculators, to long-term global macro investors. In particular, the interviews with fundamental analyst James B. Rogers (who started the Quantum fund with George Soros in 1969), and technical systems trader Ed Seykota, contain many interesting and imaginative insights into the way financial markets operate, from completely different ends of the trading spectrum. I trade for a living, and these two chapters were a big influence on the methods I now use today. Schwager is also careful to ask quite detailed questions about how each trader raised the money to start their career, and how they coped in the early days (including how they dealt with going bust, in some cases). Anyone thinking of going out and trading for themselves will find these sections very useful indeed - if you're having a tough spell, it's inspiring to go back and see that how these successful traders dealt with similar problems, and how they managed to shrug them off and go on to greater heights. In summary, this book is essential reading for anyone interested in trading. I reread my copy several times a year, and cannot recommend it highly enough. This book is to trading what Warren Buffett's annual reports are to investing. Buy it now!
B000002NJS|5.0|Ray of Light is one of the best cd's I've heard in a while.  If you have  it on really low, it's perfect to go to sleep with.  The best song is,  well, I like them all and I can't decide! I love Madonna and her new cd.  Please go out and buy it!  It's totally worth it :-).
0451160916|5.0|This is not King's best, it's his third best. When I read this novel I was so hooked that I missed a couple of days from school just reading this book. I, as a big King fan, firmly suggest for you to read this incredible work. But expect the novel to have a different ending from the movie. I could see why King was so upset at Stanley Kubrick for his adaption. I would be upset, too. First of all, the movie was extremely boring, second of all, it seemed as if the movie was a whole different story.
B000002LIX|5.0|I wouldn't listen to too much of what Genevieve Williams had to say... the  song &quot;Three Days&quot; is an epic of almost perfect proportions. A  true musician understands this in listening to it. No one can question the  amount of energy these guys put out, and the talent behind all the  instruments and the poetic vocals make this one of the greatest rock bands  to date. I would strongly recommend this album.
B0000039QP|5.0|I only bought the remixes to the songs on &quot;Ready to Die&quot; because  they had a better flow than the album versions. The &quot;Life After  Death&quot; songs do not need remixes because they are so good and  inventive. Buy &quot;Life After Death&quot;(EXPLICIT LYRICS)if you do not  own either B.I.G. album.
B0000025H6|5.0|In many ways this album reminds me of Pierre Martique's haunting &quot;Le  Bin de Vous Beauchamp&quot; in that  reaches the depths of the soul of a  human in dire need. This album shows Watters' genius.
0694514799|3.0|There is some good work in this audio book, although, to quote a friend,  it's about 20 minutes of good information that they somehow crammed onto  two hours of tape.  The various points are belabored well past any argument  for helpful review.<br />But the real shame is that the narration is SO  terrible.  These guys may be researchers, but they can't read out loud.   The narration is bad to the extent that it simply hurts the book.  Business  audio, unfortunately, is such that you normally need to listen through more  than once, and it's just too terrible to contemplate in this case.  Why  Harper Audio did not insist on a trained voice to read this tape suggests  that, as a company, perhaps THEY aren't built to last.
B000002UAX|5.0|I cannot remember a time when a Beatles song was not a background to my  life. As a mother of a 10 year old son, I find I can share this music with  him. It seems that the songs from the &quot;White Album&quot; are fun, at  times very serious, but overall music I like played loud at home by my  kids!!!  My son will choose other bands(blues and R&amp;B) but more often  than not he will pick Beatles. My album is shot so now I am investing in  this CD for my home.
0887307396|5.0|Even though, Built to Last,  lacks of a definitive structure, as those of  The Seven Habit of Highly effective People or even the Fifth Discpline, as  one of the reviewer has pointed out,  it is a real and necessary warning in  this stage of mankind in which we all have the tendency to be driven by the  fashion of change instead of remembering that it is EVOLUTION what really  matters. By destroying twelve myths, Collins and Porras give us a good  reference of permanence in this age, and how those companies that last have  shown a great respect for their leaders as a basic nucleus; the way they  are open to change externally,  but at the same time,  internally they have  preserved the core by not changing what must not change: the nucleus. At  this very moment, the flatten tendency fashion in organization, perhaps  because of a partial interpretation of the Fifth Discipline have taken many  organization to destroy their nucleus.  Even though the metaphor of the  Clock Builder is a good one, it is not fair with reality, as   time tellers  as Westinghouse or Columbia Pictures, also made great contributions in  their fields, and that was their mission... As they tried to demostrate  with the &quot;and/or preposition&quot;, we need both: Clock builders and  Time tellers . Again the new emerging basic unit system concept in which,  the opposites can be complementary by immersing them in a comprehensive  whole, must be used by those interested in Management and leadership if  they want to have a good frame of reference.
B000002OXU|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums since the 1970's... it was and  still is a pinnacle of unfettered musical talent and energy, from the  fantastic lyrical and guitar skills of Pete Townshend to the explosive  drumming of Keith Moon. Not to mention the booming vocals of Roger Daltrey  (great shriek in Won't Get Fooled Again) and the unfailing bass of John  Entwistle. Does this sound like a paid advertisement?  Well, it ain't! This  is one outstanding album! Try it, you'll like it!
B000001EAQ|5.0|Look, if you dont own any U2 cd's dont start with this one (POP), go get  Achtung Baby, Joshua Tree, Unforgettable fire to start with.  those will  suck you in to the deep parts of U2's musical world. Every seroius music  lover must have some U2, Im a huge fan, but pop is a little experimental,  good, very good, but still worlds appart from their other materpieces.   Rock On!
0679410503|5.0|I thought the twisting plots and attention to detail were very good.   Lestat is a character anybody could learn to love.  He's witty and  uncontrolable.  Lestat is what makes these books bestseller material.  The  concept of the life of these vampires are amazing.  I haven't been able to  put these books down.   I can't wait to read the New Tales of the Vampires.   No doubt they will be just as good as the Chronicles.
B000001DTM|5.0|Life as you know it will change after you plunge deep into Achtung Baby.   I listen to all kinds of music, mainstream, undergound, dance, jazz, rock.  Achtung Baby deserves 6 stars out of five!  Wow, I cant tell you how good  this is, Ive been listning to it now for close to 7 years!, Im still  playing it NON STOP! U2 has somthing on the music world! I reccomend this  CD, more than I can tell you.  It is Topps, in a league of its own. every  song is magnificent!
0451167716|4.0|Hey hey! This was a good book. I was never really a fan of the films but I was a bit to young then. I guess I've grown up coz I couldn't put this one down.
0451191153|1.0|About 6 years ago, I read this book because someone with whom I was  co-teaching a course put it on the reading list.  I actually read it twice,  the minumum number of times I read anything I teach.  I would not have  finished it even once if I had not been paid to read it.   Don't get me  wrong--over the previous 20+ years I had read most of Rand's non-fiction,  and her play(s).  I had used essays by her in classes I had taught.  Her  non-fiction I find mentally stimulating, partly because I strongly agree  with some of her ideas, but definitely not with all; so it is a challenge  to disentangle them.  But reading her non-fiction first had warned me about  her fiction--for Ayn Rand is her very own favorite authority to quote in  her essays.  These copious quotations from her novels had given me the idea  that her fiction was non-humorous and greatly didactic. The Fountainhead  proved that Rand quotes herself fairly--it's gossly didactic and has little  intentional humour.  It is, though, a good example of camp--probably the  Hollywood influence on Rand--in the posturing of it main romantic pair.   Dominique, who I gather is supposed to be an ideal female character,  strikes dominatrix poses, but when it comes to the &quot;right&quot; man,  she's an enthusiastic masochist.  There's the notorious &quot;rape&quot;  scene, but even more grotesque is her marriage to someone else for whom she  feels no real attraction but who keeps in close contact with the  &quot;right&quot; man, and most grotresque is the scene where she  swooningly slashes herself--with shattered windshield glass, I believe.  This Aryan-featured female turns out to be the right woman for the  Aryan-featured hero, who is supposed to be an ideal man.  (It's interesting  that in a book set mostly in the 1930s and published during WWII, a Jewish  author would choose to make her two ideal characters both physical types  the Nazis would have approved of--surely Rand could have found beauty in  variety.)  Looks aside, one wonders if an ideal man wouldn't have loved  someone less perverse that Dominique. Rand also does not play fair  politically--in that the book does take on elements of the New Deal, but  doesn't seem to acknowledge the Great Depression, so that the New Deal  seems wholly perverse and arbitrary. The book does have some virtues.  It  describes non-organic things well.  It describes work--especially work  involving more than one person-- well.  The long trial oration is a relief,  because the ideas are presented openly and therefore Rand doesn't get so  gummed up in the demands of matters like plot and character or in matters  of irrational, incompletely examined sexual feelings. The main villian is  very boring--Rand avoiding a flaw that writers such as Shakespeare, Milton  and Dickens sometimes fell into, the flaw of making a story's main villian  more interesting and compelling that the good or heroic characters.   Unfortunately Rand' main villian has several subtantial scenes, which are  excrutiatingly dull. <br />shakespeare, Milton
0156141647|5.0|Anne Morrow Lindbergh looked to the sky long before she met Charles  Augustus Lindbergh.<br />Cloudscapes as pastel vistas; marvelling at the  wings of a gull in flight; nights lying in bed, looking straight up through  a tree to the celestial panorama overhead.<br />A young girl's vision of her  future?<br />In &quot;Bring Me A Unicorn, the Diaries and Letters of Anne  Morrow Lindbergh, 1922 - 1928&quot;, we get to meet the joyful, sweet  adolescent, and watch her grow into the young, mature woman, she quickly  becomes.<br />One marvels in seeing her through her own eyes...<br />...eyes  that are discerning: artful, considerate, contemplative, and forever  searching.<br />Eyes that are always examining her &quot;new&quot; and  hidden self, for some inner truth.<br />She reflects upon her  &quot;arrival,&quot; lacking confidence at first, before finding herself  expressed within the petals of lavender flowers:<br />&quot;I kept looking at  the flowers in a vase near me:  lavender sweet peas, fragile winged and  yet so still, so perfectly poised, apart, and complete.  They are  self-sufficient, a world in themselves, a whole--perfect.  Is that then,  perfection?  Is what those sweet peas had what I have, occasionally in  moments like that?  But flowers always have it--poise, completion,  fulfillment, perfection; I only occasionally, like that moment.  For that  moment I and the sweet peas had an understanding.&quot;<br />Daughter of  Dwight Morrow, U.S. Ambassador to Mexico, Anne was living in an upper-class  world of regal elegance, and experiencing that world in style.  Anne  describes a dinner on board J.P. Morgan's steamer &quot;Corsair&quot;, with  the great man himself greeting her and the Morrow family at the ship's  entrance.<br />&quot;The joy of being there almost invisible in this sparkling  world, able to watch and listen to the most brilliant, charming men in the  world, and a sense of the utmost fairy-tale luxury--everything done in  exciting, magnificant style, so much grander than a party of young  people.&quot;<br />Anne then travels to Mexico City, where her father serves  as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico. On the eve of destiny, she ascends a  staircase and turns toward the receiving line that awaits her and her  family, where she sees &quot;him&quot; for the first time:<br />&quot;I saw  standing against the great stone pillar--on more red plush--a tall, slim  boy in evening dress--so much slimmer, so much taller, so much more poised  than I expected.  A very refined face, not at all like those grinning  'Lindy' pictures--a firm mouth, clear, straight blue eyes, fair hair, and  nice color.  Then I went down the line very confused and overwhelmed by it  all.  He did not smile--just bowed and shook hands.&quot;<br />Awkwardness  sets in, as the mature young woman disappears, and the young waif returns  anew, seeking one moment, her entrance; the next, her exit; and thereafter,  a direction on a parallel course with his life.<br />This lanky boy, over  whom most fawn in adulation, is a curiousity:<br />&quot;He is very, very  young and was terribly shy--looked straight ahead and talked in short  direct sentences which came out abruptly and clipped.  You could not meet  his sentences:  they were statements of fact, presented with such honest  directness:  not trying to please, just bare simple answers and statements,  not trying to help a conversation along.  It was amazing--breathtaking. I  could not speak.  What kind of boy was this?&quot;<br />This boy--already  known as the &quot;Lone Eagle&quot;--was beyond &quot;alone&quot;; he was  isolated and trapped.<br />Charles Lindbergh had withdrawn into himself.<br />Charles was surrounded by admirers living in the  &quot;make-believe&quot; world of the Press, and still, had no one to talk  to in his own, real world...<br />...no one to share with, until Anne arrives  compassionately to his rescue:<br />&quot;We talked of going to Xochimilco.  We all wanted to go--would he go?  He wanted to, but then he said he was  afraid he might 'spoil our day'--a crowd would gather.  It was quite  pathetic, for he wanted to go.  I said, 'I feel as though the nicest thing  we could do for you would be to leave you alone.'  He smiled so kindly but  said, 'No, I'd like very much to go--very much indeed.'  We were off!&quot;<br />When they return, he takes them flying, and for Anne--like her  sisters--the experience is as much a revelation as it is a  first!<br />&quot;Let me be conscious of this!  Let me be conscious!&quot;<br />Joy and exhilaration overtake her:<br />&quot;We were high above fields,  and there far, far below, was a small shadow as of a great bird tearing  along the neatly marked off fields.  It gave me the most tremendous shock  to realize for the first time the terrific speed we were going at and that  that shadow meant us--us, like a mirror!  That 'bird'--it was us.&quot;<br />She watches him as well, observing his movements and features:<br />&quot;He was so perfectly at home--all his movements mechanical.  He sat  easily and quietly, not rigidly, but relaxed, yet alert.  One hand on the  wheel--one hand!  He has the most tremendous hands.&quot;<br />Man and machine  have made their impression.  She bids Charles farewell, believing she will  never see him again, then watches as he departs Mexico City in his Ryan  Monoplane, the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;.<br />...though Anne's love  for him has already begun:<br />&quot;The feeling of exultant joy that there  is anyone like that in the world.  I shall never see him again, and he did  not notice me, or would ever, but there is such a person alive, there is  such a life, and I am here on this earth, in this age, to know  it!&quot;<br />In the months that followed Charles' famous trans-Atlantic  flight, Anne was probably the only person he had met who spoke to him with  any sincerity...<br />...and she had simply offered to leave him  alone.<br />Weeks go by in pages, and they meet again.

1573226521|2.0|Ironically, I was travelling in just the area where this book is set at  the time I read it so at first it was very exciting to follow along (of  course not to the mysterious island).  Unfortunately, soon after the  intriging beginning, the book starts to go downhill.  It is realistic only  so long and then it gets stupid and unbelievable.  I found it a pain to  finish. The &quot;..Flies&quot; parallel is the only reason why it seems to  get any attention and I think that it is shallow outside of the copied  plot.
047158651X|4.0|This text is one of the best I have come across as an undergraduate  student and chemisty minor. It is at times intense and a bit confusing, but  in general it covers material well and illustrations are very helpful. This  is a good reference to keep around.
B000006NPY|4.0|At first, I was ill-at-ease with the lack of really rockin' tracks, but  eventually I warmed up to it.  I'm glad that Corgan did away with all the  big stadium-sized pretentions of Melon Collie, and concentrated on it's  best moments.  Perhaps the best thing was that Corgan's singing ablility  definitely improved, and we didn't have to hear his awful nasal screech,  which dominated Melon Collie even on quieter tracks like In The Arms Of  Sleep).  Adore really is a breath of fresh air.  Don't complain about how  it does't match up to Gish or Siamese Dream.  Just take it at face value,  it is a beautiful album.  Perhaps by the next time around, the Cherub Rock  stuff will come back.  I, for one, can wait.
B000001ES4|5.0|If I could have only one CD - this would be IT ! Tender, passionate,  beautifully simple. Always fresh, can be played over and over without ever  tiring of it. Absolutely the most tender violin ever played - by anyone!    The first album from Secret Garden was great.  Who would have thought they  could have outdone themselves with their second release but, in my opinion,  they have.  I wouldn't trade either album for works by anyone else.
B000002IZM|4.0|Like other reviewers here, I love this CD but am slightly bummed that some  of the best cuts from the movie are absent. I have various bootleg CD's  that do contain all of the music that is missing from the official  soundtrack, but the audio quality is poor. Since this is my favorite all  time movie and soundtrack I suppose I will just have to create my own  bootleg CD from the DVD audio tracks!

B000009QPG|5.0|This is the best Slayer album ever produced. Not only that, but I would  argue that it is among the best rock albums ever produced! No Slayer album  which was made before or since has equalled the masterful imagery and cold  precision of &quot;Seasons in the Abyss&quot;. I bought this CD in 1990,  when it was released, and have listened to it regularly since. This album  is truly the pinnacle of heavy metal itself, and it exemplifies the best of  the genre. This is serious stuff--not for the faint of heart and mind!!!
B000003S2K|4.0|A (very) quiet revolution on release, 'Music for Airports' is considered  something of an ambient classic nowadays. As such, it's not bad - a neat  manifesto that, in forty-five minutes, begats, explores, and exhausts the  entire genre. It's hampered by a lack of refinement (the first three songs  sound like sub-mixes of a larger piece), and it has a slightly tragic  legacy (witness countless sample-fiends disguising a lack of effort as  'ambient'). Still, it sounds mostly timeless today, and if it isn't quite  as good as Apollo that's because he had some practise.
B00000AFGM|5.0|It's been a while since a good album has been released, in any genre. This  album is amazing, because besides being the world's only surviving ROCK  STAR, Marilyn Manson has also gained a lot of musical skill since their  &quot;Portrait of An American Family&quot; Days. They still retain their  passion for rock and roll - Songs like &quot;Posthuman&quot; and  &quot;Don't Like the drugs&quot; bring back the glamour and grandeur of  rock back with a vengance. But these tracks are also pleasing to the ear -  unlike some of the more assaulting tracks on &quot;Antichrist  Superstar.&quot; Whether you're a fan or not, this album is a good  investment. It's different - but it also rocks.
B000005S37|4.0|Either a rip-off, a dated retread of early Stockhausen, or the most  inspired and true album ever, depending on your opinion. I like it more for  the idea (it's literally four sides of feedback/distortion/ring modulation,  with an endless groove on side four) that the execution, although track  three is quite nice. Lester Bangs (late, great rock writer) said all there  was to say about this in the seventies. Apparently it sold over 25,000  copies.
0425107469|5.0|This was the first Dean Koontz book I ever read, and it's still my  favorite after five years. Travis and Nora are three-dimensional and  believable, they don't fit any stereotypes, which is a common problem in  most horror fiction. the book is fast-paced, suspenseful, and never boring.  And as for Einstein, well what more can I say? I LOVE EINSTEIN!!!    The  perfect choice for those who are new to Dean Koontz!
079213690X|5.0|This movie had quite an impact on me -- so much so that I watched it  dozens of times.  To tell you the truth, however, this movie is much more  powerful on a big screen, but since that is not always a convenient option,  the video is the next best thing.  I liked every aspect of this movie: the  cast, the script, the music, the cinematography, the performance, the  editing, the costumes, the horsemanship, the sets.  It is based on a true  story, but is highly fictionalized.  I think a more accurate movie could be  made that would be just as exciting.  I'm glad that this film won so many  awards (e.g. Mel Gibson won Best Director from both the Oscars and the  Golden Globes), because I think it deserved to.  I didn't even notice flaws  in the film until I had seen it over a dozen times.  The story is extremely  intense.  It is very violent and graphic, but it still conveys some  messages on values, such as integrity.  I might also add that there are  some extremely beautiful women in this movie; the bloody war and politics  are offset by moments of sweet romance.  This film is as stimulating to the  ears as it is to the eyes, mind, and heart.  In addition to the great sound  editing, and beautiful music, you get to hear many interesting languages  and dialects.  Most of the movie is in modern English, but you get to hear  it spoken in interesting English and Scottish accents.  The man who played  Malcolm Wallace had the best, most exotic sounding Scottish accent of all;  I wished he was featured in more of the movie just so I could listen to him  talk.  There are small scenes in French, with subtitles, and a bit of  Latin, too.  There are words from the Scots dialect of English, and even a  few Gaelic words if you listen carefully!  The medieval world would be an  awful place to live (and die), but it's exciting to pay that world a small,  three-hour visit through a well done film like this.     END

B000002O51|5.0|To me it's a tough choice between the first Boston album and the Third  Stage album.  As an entire album though I would go with the Third Stage.   Great tracks  like,&quot;We're Ready&quot;, &quot;Cool the Engines&quot;,  &quot;A New World&quot; and &quot;I Think I Like It&quot;, Rock! Stay clear  of Boston's &quot;Walk On&quot; album what a turkey!
B000002MU3|1.0|Oh brother.  R.E.M. does grunge.  As if grunge needed another contributor  to its sorry genre. If you want to hear R.E.M. rock hard, get Dead Letter  Office and hear their version of Toys In The Attic.  Or better yet, get  Lifes Rich Pageant and hear Begin The Begin or I Believe. This album sucks.   Hard.  Really hard.  I bought it, listened to it once, and it has not come  out of its jewel case since. And this is coming from someone who was a big,  big fan of R.E.M. during the I.R.S. years.
0679457313|5.0|The poetic prose tells a disturbing and haunting story from the eyes of  children in India. The ending so unbelievably terrifying, yet undeniably  apppropriate.
B000002572|5.0|Perhaps the greatest appeal of Boston is the utterly classic sound they  have created in their first album. With the incredible harmonics of both  guitar and vocals, each song is a toe-tapper and never loses its powerful  allure. The first time I heard &quot;Rock + Roll Band,&quot; for instance,  I felt shivers down my spine, and the experience is paralleled every other  time I listen to it. If you like Classic Rock, then you should buy this CD  (and the others, as well!)
B00000DBXL|5.0|This CD is awesome.  The band sounds different, but most certainly not in  a bad way.  There is a mix of slow and fast songs, much like there is on  Fashion Nugget.  I especially like &quot;You Turn The Screws&quot; and  &quot;Sheep Go To Heaven&quot;.  This CD is one that I can listen to over  and over, because of the variety.  Two things remain though:  The trumpet  man still sounds excellent, and Cake has failed again to come out with a  single song I do not like.  I really recommend this CD!
B0000009UX|5.0|As a somewhat avid listener to Elvis Costello over the last 20 years, I  find that this collection of songs are among the most memorable.  Although  none of these songs had the top 40 support of some of his earlier works,  each song has the lyrical power of songs such as Watching the Detectives  and Allison but with an even more sophisticated slant.  This is my favorite  album to date.

0446605409|4.0|Nelson DeMille is one of the true novelists. He writes novels and not  novelised scripts, nor books for scripts. This one is a pure detective  story with noir hints as to the description of his cha- racters, while  turning into an adventure somewhe- re at the end, falling into a trap for  this latter (we'll talk about it later). Taking into conside- ration the  above, his plot is not original as conceived, but with some interesting  twists and uncovered slowly to its every piece or bit. In some points  though, he seems widening and he beco- mes very slow, but his point is  character wise, not that we readers can't pinpoint this chatter. From a  point and on (the ending chapters) the plot becomes &quot;how will it  end&quot; and not &quot;what will hap- pen&quot;, due to the adventure  element that takes away the unexpected hint. As to his characters, DeMille  illuminates the main hero and you come to love him: he's cynical, humorous,  macho and most masculine, hidding very well his sensitive side, trying to  resemble to Mickey Spilaine's Mike Ham- mer (and thus the noir element).  Ten the most at- tention is given to the women characters and all the  others become decorating characters, receiv- ing from the author the  respective attention. Cha- racterisations are deep, but very much focused  and do not turn the book to a heavy, psychological de- tective noir story.  And DeMille's speach is of a pure novelist: picturous, but not overburdened  and to the point, witty at times and real. The reader is not tired by the  speech, but by the widening a- forementioned. So the scenes flow, not  fastly but flow; the tempo being also of a noir novel (or film if you  prefer). The adventure trap he falls into is the one of the &quot;adventure  couples&quot;: the sidekick never stand aside and appears like a Greek  ancient tragedy God, to save his friend/ mate. It's a very complete book,  finally, a true novel with all its pros and cons, but these minor details  fail it from being a perfect book. And it is a pity for DeMille, who shows  exactly what he can achieve by his writting.

If your image of espionage is formed  by the cheesy gadgetry and high adventure of James Bond, then get ready for  one very rude awakening.

0790730960|5.0|This is the first Batman sequel, and the only good one. The story is about  the fight of Batman (Keaton in his best role) against the Penguin (a really  sinister DeVito), Catwoman (a splendid Pfeiffer) and evil businessman Max  Shreck (Walken in his best role since Deer Hunter). This is a dark movie,  with a sinister humour and some sad moments (like the Penguin's funeral)  but it is also a lot of fun.

B000002O4X|5.0|One lovely theme after another flows from this recording.  This Academy  Award winning score from John Barry takes flight (literally, listen to the  breathtaking FLYING OVER AFRICA) and leaves the listener almost breathless.   As in another of his Academy Award winning scores (DANCES WITH WOLVES),  Barry shows an amazing ability to capture the elation one feels at the  sight of a beautiful natural landscape.  For this is not just a story of  romance between the two main characters.  It is the story of Karen's (Meryl  Streep) love for Africa.  This is a score of rare beauty.

0606001743|5.0|I must have read Steinbeck's &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot; a half dozen  times since I first picked it up as a high school student.  The story of  the ongoing hope and determination of the displaced migrants, pitted  against the disdainful land-owners, highlights a 20th century conflict  between traditional values of inherent virtue and the interests of  business, economic efficiency, and the profit-seeking wealthy.  The first  few times I read this story, I saw only a tract that promotes centralized  state authority and socialist constructs as a solution to injustice and  poverty, as also appears in Upton Sinclair's &quot;The Jungle&quot;.  In  my later years, however, I have seen Steinbeck's prophecy against the  hypocrisy of those who would call themselves &quot;Christian&quot; and  &quot;righteous&quot;, then ignore the essential tenets of their faith to  serve their own interests, the minute they've left church on Sunday.  The  book continues to speak to our own age, when the well-to-do in the  &quot;winner-take-all&quot; competition of the modern marketplace find it  all too convenient to neglect the poor that remain.  Although history has  since proven the value of a free-market  economy, its &quot;winners&quot;  are just as human as  its &quot;losers&quot;, and cannot in good conscience  brush them aside, discounting them as products of their own failings.

0385493622|5.0|This book was everything I expected. I first saw it based on the BBC  programme and then had to read more about it. Although more about maths  than just Fermat and it's most recent victor, it offers a lesson in  humility and perserverence. A book highly recommended to anyone who  appreciates the hidden and often intangible world of maths.
B000009CEM|5.0|I love old FF, but this new album has hit a place in my heart.  The hard  riffs that smooth out into the more solemn beats impressed me deeply.   Decent and Resurection are amazingly put together.  The other songs also  bring up strange feelings in my gut.  I love this album and hope that more  like it follow.
B000000JO3|5.0|i won't say more than that these guys really tear it up so if you're  looking for some fast, fierce music, buy this with no delay.
0395860210|5.0|Absolutely intriguing! What more can I say. The Swede is such a carefully  created character.  I can sympathize with him at times, but Merry's actions  were the only way to wake him up to real life.  He created his own perfect  world, and she showed him that it was a farse.  It seemed like everything  was going right for him always, but even the Swede couldn't make complete  perfection.
0684874350|5.0|This was one of the most gripping stories.  He brought all of his  characters to life. It was terrific.  After reading the book, I desparately  wanted to meet his wonderful mother to see her strength.  She should be  canonized.
0486650677|5.0|I think this book is a wonderful reference for engineers taking a  Lagrangian mechanics/dynamics course. This book dives a little deeper into  the mathematics than most engineering oriented texts. It does so in a lucid  fashion no less.
078322737X|5.0|American Graffiti is a masterpiece of innocence of a time past. The cast  of characters and the wonderful script along with superb acting by its cast  has helped make this film a classic for future generations. The overall  texture of the film will leave an impression in you for years to come. You  cannot just watch it just once. You will find yourself watching it over and  over for a long time.     END
B000007NYS|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums I have listened to in years.  The  songs truely touch my soul!  Lucinda is a gifted and unique individual!
0898159156|5.0|After reading this book, the first thought in my mind is &quot;This is the  best book which I ever read.&quot; In this book, you can find anything  about how to grow carnivorous plants. And there are so many great pictures  in it, too. Thus, I think that if you are the person who never grow this  kind of plant, and you want to grow them now. This book will be your best  choice. Trust me, and you will make it!
0679735259|5.0|This intense book blew me away.  It could be subtitled &quot;Fear and  Loathing in Southeast Asia:  A Savage Journey into the Heart of the  American Nightmare&quot;.  The writing is reminiscent of Hunter S.  Thompson's hallucinatory journey into Vegas, but the setting here is much  more grim and deadly.<br />I just finished watching The Learning Channel's  multi-part series &quot;Vietnam:  A Soldier's Story&quot; and I was struck  how the bunkers at Khe Sang were just as I had pictured them while reading  Herr's book. (Obviously, I'm no vet!)<br />This book is as close as I want to  get to combat, I think.  (For an excellent account of the Vietnam  policy-making of the JFK/LBJ eras, check out David Halberstam's &quot;The  Best and the Brightest&quot;.)
B000002UEB|5.0|I bought the album in 1988 and have never tired of it.  It is my all time  favorite album and I'd suggest it to anyone.  Too bad they don't make such  good music lately.
B000002G87|5.0|Layla is simply a fantastic album.  From &quot;I Looked Away&quot; to  &quot;Thron Tree in the Garden&quot; its simply a classic.  I don't like  the title because it just seems like it's calling the rest of the album an  afterthought to the title track (which, of course,  is incredible).  These  &quot;other assorted love songs&quot; are some of the best around.

0399128964|5.0|The late, great, Frank Herber's \\"Dune\\" is a classic in the true sense of  the word.  I've read many wonderful novels (2001, Stranger in a Strange  Land, Foundation, Hyperion, Ender's Game, etc, etc.--classics all) that  will stay with me for life, but none `wormed' its way in so deeply as  \\"Dune\\".  Herbert's masterpiece works on so many different levels, it would  take another novel just to describe the depth.<br />I won't lie to anyone,  when I first picked up this novel many, many years ago and took a look at  the dictionary, I began to wonder what I got myself into.  This isn't a  `light' read.  However, Herbert hooked me on the first page and never let  go.  For me personally, this novel had everything a great classic should  have, including stunningly rich, vibrant characters (something most sci-fi  novels grievously lack).  Granted, there are many that may not like this  novel as much as I do, but I believe \\"Dune\\" is the standard by which all  science fiction novels should be judged, and the goal all authors should  try to attain--a quite daunting task, I might add.<br />After many years (and  a few failed attempts), \\"Dune\\" was made into a movie.  Now I know that most  people didn't like the movie (me included), but let's be fair.  How does  anyone make a successful movie of a novel that has so many intricate  layers?  While I thought the casting was first-rate and the costumes  authentic, the task before them was monumental (and, alas, the special  effects were `cheesy' at best).  The movie tried desperately to be true to  Herbert's vision, but it just cannot be done, and probably should never  have been attempted.<br />Between 1 and 10, \\"Dune\\" gets a solid 10.  This is  the only 10 I have given any novel, because no novel I have yet read  matches the artistic depth and richness of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\".
0812550757|5.0|This book made a very good sequel to Ender's Game. I liked it because it  had a very good plot.
0451450639|5.0|I don't think one can review this particular novel, without reviewing the  motion picture (they were created simultaneously).  Not many movies come  close to being as good as the novel.  \\"The Godfather\\" and \\"Jaws\\" come to  mind, as does \\"The Exorcist\\", but Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\"  (screenplay by Kubrick and Clarke) surpassed all expectations.  Young  viewers may not think so, but then, they have never seen this  ground-breaking film in a theater or in cinerama.<br />\\"2001\\" began early  production in 1964 and was released in 1968 at a cost of $10,000,000 (an  astronomical sum in those days).  After the initial release it was reedited  and shortened.  The version I saw at the theater had an intermission, and  during that intermission, the crowd's comments were almost as entertaining  as the movie!  \\"2001\\" was unlike anything that had ever graced the silver  screen before.  Sure, special effects have come a long way since 1968  (thanks to this movie), but it's surprising how well this classic has held  up.<br />As far as Arthur C. Clarke's adaptation of the movie (based on a  short story \\"The Sentinel\\", I believe), when I first read it, I was  mesmerized.  I read it just so I could get a few hundred questions  answered.  Fortunately, not all my questions were answered, and it is the  mystery that's at the heart of both novel and movie--the mystery of first  contact, written and depicted as never before, or since.  And who has not  heard of the HAL 9000 computer?  (Note: add one letter to the acronym HAL,  and it reads IBM).<br />It's been 30 years since I have read the novel, so I  cannot tell you how it has stood the test of time.  All I can tell you is  that when I read the novel, I thought it would become a classic.  Between 1  and 10, I give \\"2001\\" a solid 9.
B000002U82|5.0|This is by far one of the most creative and well composed albums of  contemporary music's history. A pure auditory delight, a sensory overload  of a mesh of vocals, insturmentals and outerworldly musical textures.  Beautiful music was made when the Dark Side was collaborated.
B000005ROC|5.0|I love this!!! I agree with everyone else!!!  If like Garbage even just a  little, you HAVE to buy this album!!!  I saw them in concert in San Diego  and they are a great live act too!!!
0399143904|5.0|Unlike some of Clancy's other books, Six reaches out and grabs you right  away. From beginning to end this book intelligently entertains the reader.  The missions of Mr. Clark's special counter-terrorism team will have you on  the edge of your seat, and will keep you turning pages. Rainbow Six is one  of Clancy's best.
0887309372|5.0|&quot;Positioning&quot; move over! This book is a classic -- as we all are  involved with branding something. I've recommended it to about 50 people.  It will direct a lot of people's minds to thinking about their companies  (or books or products or organizations) in a different way. Immensely  stimulating.
0684833395|3.0|What a disappointing book!  I had been told by so many people how funny  and amazing this book was, only to find it just okay.  Many passages were  chores to get through, and even Yossarian was annoying throughout the book.   I'll give it this much--it is very clever, perhaps it was revolutionary in  its day, and the last sixty pages almost make up for all the weaknesses  throughout the book.  I guess most people SHOULD read it, but it's a lot  like doing homework.
B000007T2Z|5.0|The nine-member group of Montreal musicians collectively known as godspeed  you black emperor! have produced what could be the year's finest effort on  Kranky. The CD has just about everything possible to offer the  listener(with the exception of ska and swing, thank god...)within the  framework of its 63 minutes. Comparisons? Morricone-esque spaghetti western  soundtracks, or the recent Labradford LP spring to mind immediately. But  there's SO much more on the plate to be tasted. And that's a good thing.  The beauty of this beautiful music is its ability to remain in the  room/house at all times. You can be happy or sad, the weather outside can  be sunny or cloudy, the volume of the disc can be loud or quiet, etc.  Whatever the circumstances externally/internally of the listener is of  minor importance here. The point is, it all WORKS. But go ahead, turn it up  real loud. You'll be glad you did. After repeated listens, I always feel  exhausted but invigorated. It's a terrific feeling. Kinda like sex...  Instrumentation will not be included here, as it's been done in other  reviews. Simply put, this is big. All hail gybe!.
006016848X|5.0|As a woman who failed more at love than anyone you know, this book was a  life raft.   I had no boundaries and couldn't begin to honor a man's need  for space or cave time.   This book taught me not to take it personally.  The best compliment I could get from my husband last night was this:  I  love you as my wife because you give me the freedom to be me.     Two  ex-husbands told me the opposite... You never let me have any time to  myself.    Thank you John Gray.  And its wonderful you're on Oprah on  Wednesdays now!  Linda Schiller-Hanna
0670880728|5.0|I'm fifty-something but found the book laugh-out-loud funny. It's perfect  for reading on the plane.  In fact, I had to force myself to save the  second half for the journey home. I believe Bridget represents anyone,  female or male, who has obsessed over a lover, and I have recommended the  book to all of my 21-year-old daughter's friends who take themselves so  seriously.
0606001743|5.0|This has to be the most real and emotional American novel ever written.  It's a book that intimately describes people to whom you'd never give a  second glance, showing them as intelligent, stupid, loving, hateful,  hopeful, and familiar.
0811806405|5.0|Cumpiano and Natelson have written a great book for beginners. In this  book are all of the details necessary for constructing your own classical  or steel-stringed guitar. The appendix is an indespensable resource with  lists of potential suppliers, wood types, and dimensions for every piece.  They describe the process with a minimum of technology used. If you do not  have a bending iron, for example, they describe what one is and how to  construct it. I am using this book as THE guide for the construction of my  first classical guitar, and have not found it lacking in any respect. -BLF

B00000637V|5.0|...whenever I got tired of unwelcome guests at my apartment I would put  this album on.  By the time &quot;The Kids&quot; came on only the coolest  people would hang around.  Sounding like a nervous breakdown on vinyl this  album defines degradation (and superior musicianship).  Twenty five years  after its release Berlin still sounds fifty years ahead of its time.  A  friend of mine told me once that the record company tried to promote this  as the &quot;next step&quot; after Sergeant Pepper.  Hard to imagine a more  inappropriate analogy.  Maybe more appropriate would be a comparison to  Celine's Journey to the End of the Night.  The best album of the 70's.
B00000AFWW|5.0|Not being a fan of &quot;Punk&quot; era, it thought this disc was one of  the best of '98. I know many accuse Hole of &quot;selling out&quot;, but I  say Thank God for it.
0812550706|3.0|I was sort of going through something when I read this so it was  emotionally exhausting for me. It is engaging and valentine (ender's  sister) is one of my favorite characters in literature. I am a little  unnerved by card's tendency to write about tortured children, but I've only  read this and Songmaster so maybe I can't judge.
B000002R6A|4.0|This double LP set was the last album by an Animals configuration until  the origianl band did the obligatory reunion album some years later. An  album filled with excess, bombast and extended tunes, and I love every  second of it. A great example of how the British invasion morphed into  psychedelia and ultimately self-destructed. Highlights include their  version of River Deep, Mountain High, which is a great companion to Tina  Turner's, and their loving Bee Gees tribute, To Love Somebody.
B000007ODL|5.0|The artist who inspired Eric Clapton and Mark Knopfler sure has the stuff  delivered on this. A Must buy
B000002KO3|5.0|Remain in Light and Sonic Youth's Daydream Nation were the best CDs to  emerge from the eighties.  Both earn this distinction because they are  timeless.  Remain in Light could be released today  and the music would be  just as relevant.  It takes some time to get used to, but don't all good  CDs?  Listen to this, dance, and then tremble.  A must own for any  collection.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends is an eclectic mix of back-distorting depression, portrayed by  subdued guitars and Thom York's frankly, amazing, unreproducable voice.  Fade Out (Street Spirit) the 'grande finale' of the album deserves the most  praise. A choir of fallen Angels from God's abode could not improve upon  the angst and confusion that this record acheives. This is stunning. This  is exceptional. This takes the greif and bordom ridden rock of the nineties  beyond the comprhension of anyone who takes the care to understand it.  Wonderful.
B000002MFE|5.0|This is the kind of blues that touch  the soul.  I never tire of listening   to E.C. classics like Travelin'  Blues, Alberta, &amp; Hey Hey, Know One   Loves You When Your Down &amp; Out.  The  quality of sound is fantastic for  a  live album.  If you dig the blues...  get this disc.
0399143904|2.0|&quot;They made me write it,&quot; or so Tom Clancy would seem to imply.   Perhaps he is disinterested with his past style, or maybe this book  fulfills a contract.  Rainbow Six is analogous to Beethoven played on a  Casio toy keyboard -- the talent is hidden somewhere, but the result is too  mechanical to be enjoyed.  Those who have read his other (very good)  stories must, of course, read this superfluously opinionated sermon/novel.   A word of caution: be prepared to bulldoze your way through every tedious,  exhausting minute of seemingly never-ending verbiage.  As a die-hard fan  waiting with sweaty palms, this book was most disappointing and  irritating.<br />Rainbow Six belongs at the grocery store next to the  &quot;Bran Flakes,&quot; with a stark white cover displaying in large,  black letters only the word &quot;CLANCY.&quot;
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Although, being a total Phil lover, I own all of the 80s albums, I  received this CD on Thursday and it's been driving my non-Phil-loving  roommate nuts because I haven't stopped playing it since I got it.  I  really miss &quot;Everyday&quot;, and I was hoping for maybe one more new  song (I love &quot;True Colors&quot; though), but I'm still so happy to  finally have my studio recording of &quot;Easy Lover&quot; and &quot;Two  Hearts&quot; at last!  Oh...Phil, &quot;Take Me Home&quot; does not HAVE to  be the end of every CD it's on.  But that's just nitpicking - it's an  amazing CD, and you just have to have it.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis' lyrics are biting.  I am amazed at the insight that she has at  such a young age.  I could listen to &quot;All I Really Want&quot;  endlessly.
0670880728|5.0|I will try and make this review short and sweet like our Miss Jones.  This  book is the funniest, sweetest, raunchiest most down to earth book  ever!!!!!  I have already recommended it to every woman I know.  It's good  to know that I am not the only crazy girl out there!!!
B000002TYX|3.0|One of the many, many brilliant things about the Beatles was the fact that  they somehow never failed to choose the absolute best versions of their  songs for their albums.<br />Therefore, the anthology series presents all of  the inferior alternative, demo, or half-done versions of the familiar  songs.  It amounts to an album filled with Beatles leftovers.  On the other  hand, this group's &quot;leftovers&quot; are easily better than 95% of  everyone else's &quot;main courses.&quot;<br />Anthology 1 is the weakest of  the three anthology albums, because it comes from a period before the  Beatles were purely a studio band.  Also, the recording quality of a lot of  this stuff leaves much to be desired.<br />However, for Beatles fanatics, it  is an essential document.  It also gathers up all of the unreleased songs  that have been floating around on bootlegs for years, and cleans these up  as much as possible.  A very good collection, for what it is meant to be --  a historical document.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I am a die-hard Phil phanatic and I have forever been longing for a studio  recording of &quot;Easy Lover&quot; and &quot;Two Hearts&quot; - Serious  Hits Live was only partial satisfaction.  That said, I guess this CD is a  tad bit redundant if, like me, you already have all the songs (except  &quot;True Colors&quot;) in some form or another.  But I still had to get  it, because now I can listen to the best of the best all at once.  And if  you just like Phil (rather than worshiping at his feet like I do), this is  the one album you wanna get.  My one beef: Where is &quot;Everyday&quot;?!   I think it's the greatest song he ever did!
0399143904|2.0|I used to be a Clancy fan.<br />This has changed with the last few novels.   Way too much repetition.  Rainbow Six has great action, a vaguely  believeable plot (you have to try!) but could easily have been written with  half as many trees!<br />I saw another review which commented that  descriptions were repeated - this is absolutely my impression as well.   Please Tom, if you have described something already, give your readers the  benefit of the doubt as to whether they will remember it!  Some of the  descriptions of plots/ people are word for word the same in multiple places  in the book.<br />Having said all that, I was vaguely entertained.
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore is definitely different from The Pumpkins' earlier work, but I, for  one, think it's a welcome change.  They wanted to do something new, and  they did it and did it well.  The Smashing Pumpkins are the best artists  that have ever graced the Billboard, in my opinion, and Adore's mellow  tones and the complex interweaving of melodies appealed to me.  I am a  musician, a composer, and a lyricist, and I can only dream of reaching  their level.
B000002UB6|4.0|Lest we forget that this album was not really a &quot;proper&quot; Beatles  album!  It was recorded before Abbey Road, then essentially abandoned by  the Beatles.  Phil Spector went through miles of tape, picked out this  stuff, dressed it up with string arrangements on some of the songs (and  against the wishes of the Beatles), and trotted it out in 1970, after the  Beatles had essentially broken up as a band.<br />Any album that has been  pieced together like Frankenstein's monster in this way is bound to have  its problems.  But then again, this is the Beatles we're talking about.   Though Let It Be is the weakest Beatles record, it still shines with  typical brilliance on many of the tracks.<br />The title track, Across The  Universe, I've Got A Feeling, The Long And Winding Road, and Get Back are  all more than worthy of the price of this CD.  <br />And, so sue me, I even  like Dig A Pony -- especially the &quot;All I Want..Is You!&quot;  part.<br />If you want the worst song the Beatles ever recorded, I'd say check  out &quot;Mr. Moonlight.&quot;  Or maybe &quot;Wild Honey Pie.&quot;  Or  how about listening to &quot;Revolution 9&quot; over and over again?  I  mean, the Beatles were ever-adventurous and sometimes that meant some songs  that were not up to their usual incredible standards.  But are they still  worth buying?  You betcha!!  The Beatles' (few) missteps are still more  interesting than most of the stuff out there nowadays.  Get it!
B000002AGN|5.0|I still have my old vinyl of Time Out.  I got it for Christmas 1962.  I  was in the 9th grade then and thought it was the greatest.  I still think  it is the greatest, I play my CD of it often.  It is age-less.
B000002UB3|5.0|Buy this album if you don't have it already.  (And if you don't have it  already, where have you been!???)  <br />In fact, buy all of the Beatles'  albums.  Every one of the Beatles' &quot;proper&quot; albums, in their UK  versions, are 5-star essentials -- with the exception of Yellow Submarine,  which included only four new Beatles songs.<br />I will be the first to admit  that this review is redundant and unnecessary.  If you don't know by now  that this album is essential to any collection, then you'll never know.
0140013997|5.0|I discovered this magical book in Corfu, where the story is based.  Thank  God! Corfu is incredible and so is this book.  The Rose Beetle Man alone is  worth the entire book..or how about the praying mantis mating scene on the  wall? Each character, human and animal is magically drawn and stays in your  mind for a lifetime. Not bad.  And its charming and funny and touching. I  have become an animal advocate, writing letters in support of whales, and  now have three wonderful pets, possibly totally as a result of reading this  book 30 years ago.  And again and again. Its very very good! Linda  Schiller-Hanna
0790737310|5.0|I just saw the movie last night and this morning I still can't stop  thinking about it. A tear jerker, a beautiful idea, a wonderful gift for  the eyes.

0671867369|4.0|Although the book loses its clarity at times(Ambrose seems to struggle  with the Battle of the Bulge), the solid beginning and heart-warming end  put this book on my must read list. Ambrose once again proves that he is  the master of oral history, a strong writer who puts war, on both a  strategic and personal level, into perspective. <br />   But the true strength  of the book comes from its wonderful sense of chronology. As you follow the  Company's triumphs and tragedies, from the training camp at Toccoa to the  mountains of Austria, you form a strange bond between yourself and the men  of Company E. Only at the end of the book, when a lonely soldier comments  that he is the last member of the original company, did I appreciate its  emotional influence.
B00000DHTF|5.0|At last,after waiting 15 years Bruce finally delivers the goods.Most of  the stuff as been around for years on bootleg,but now its coming out  officially,a dream come true for all Springsteen fans.Worth the money alone  just for the version of `Stolen car` and `Frankie`.
0684874350|5.0|This book, certainly one for the ages, tenderly paints an image of life  few who visit this space will ever know.  Yet the emotions Mr. McCourt  inspires are universal in their appeal.  I can't remember a book that  touched me like Angela's Ashes.  I could not leave these comments without  mentioning the stunning and compelling style with which the story is  presented.  Absolutely brilliant.  'Tis.
B000002KGT|5.0|Rumours is considered by many to be a classic, and for good reason.   Although Rumours climaxed Fleetwood Mac's popularity in the later 1970's,  it was also produced at the emotional bottom for many of the band members.   With the marriage breakup of John and Christine McVie, Lindsey Buckingham  and Stevie Nicks ended relationship and more woes for Mick Fleetwood,  Rumours ideally reflects their hardships during these times.  With each  song depicting the turmoil and impending hopes of the band, one can only  listen to Rumours and feel uplifted in their own way.  It is no wonder that  today, many songs off Rumours, including hits like &quot;Dreams&quot; and  &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, down to never released singles such as  &quot;The Chain&quot; and &quot;Landslide&quot;, is heard all the time on  radio, not to mention re-makes.  If you need something to get you through  the day, buy Rumours, put it in your CD player, close your eyes and listen.
B000002UCE|4.0|This is Lennon's white period, when he wore white suits, sat in a white  room, and played a white grand piano.  Perhaps he was trying to further  cleanse himself of all the demons that came out of him on Plastic Ono Band.   It is clear that the demons still exist -- in songs such as &quot;Gimme  Some Truth&quot; and &quot;How?,&quot; he is as bitter and uncertain as  ever.  <br />But the overall tone of this album is much more hopeful and  optimistic than POB.  There is a brilliant beauty to many of these songs,  such as in &quot;Oh My Love&quot; and &quot;Jealous Guy.&quot;  Truly  magnificent tunes, and musts for any Lennon fan.<br />&quot;How Do You  Sleep?&quot; is a poison-pen letter to Paul McCartney, attacking his  descendance into schlock songwriting.  McCartney's RAM album was out at the  time, and if you've ever heard that album and much of the Wings crap that  followed it, you'll know what Lennon was talking about.  And just in case  somebody missed the point, Lennon included a nasty postcard in the original  vinyl album.  The postcard depicted him grabbing the ears of a pig, mocking  the cover of McCartney's RAM album that shows Paul grabbing the horns of a  ram.  You just have to love Lennon's caustic wit.
B0000013GT|5.0|This was my first Outkast album, and I love it!  The lyrics are cool, the  beats are funky, and I never get bored of it!  I really like the intro  song!
0517591812|3.0|This is an interesting book.  The author takes the history of London from  the days of the Roman Conquest to the present by fictionalizing it through  the eyes of four or five families.  Each historical era is presented as  part of the continuing saga of these families.  The only trouble I had was  that the books jumps from one century to another, which necessitates  turning to the &quot;family tree&quot; at the beginning of the book in  order to keep track of the characters.  It was, however, a good book.
B000002HRE|4.0|I've been a Metallica fan for many years and the albums Load and ReLoad  are proof that they have true talent and versatility. Ok, so this album is  not for the immature, closed-minded &quot;fan&quot; who only likes heavy  metal, has no understanding of real music, and thinks Metallica  &quot;sold-out&quot;.  I'm sick of hearing you complain!  Open your mind!   Yes, the older albums will always be calssics, but how much entertainment  would you get out of hearing the same music style every album?   For the  rest of us true music lovers, enjoy!   Yea, it's different, but isn't  change a sign of maturity?  Decide for yourself!
B00000ADG2|5.0|When I first bought this CD I knew I loved her first single, but I wasn't  so sure if I liked all the tracks, once I started listening I realized the  Lauryn Hill had done it again, her music is SWEET its a combonation of  ethnic, r&amp;b, rap, gospel and pop music all rolled into one.  I think  the Fugees should do another CD all together because Pras, Wy Clef and  Lauryn Hill are such original and wonderful artists.
B000000WA4|1.0|I bought this disc not knowing anything about the Pumkins. Now I know  something; they SUCK!
0399143904|5.0|Another great story. I enjoy Clancy's original characters more than the  &quot;Op Center&quot; series, so it was nice to see another book featuring  them. The story is well written and the plot is something that could happen  in the here-and-now. Definetly one of his best yet.
B000000OU6|5.0|This is a great change from the crap that is dominating today's airwaves  (Backstreet Boys?, Spice Girls?, Puff Daddy? (like Slash said &quot;he  flies on borrowed wings&quot;), and on..).  This CD is very good and you  should check it out, especially if you are a GN'R fan.
0679443819|5.0|When I finally finished this book after many early morning reading  sessions (when I enjoy reading the most) I laid it down and stared off into  space for quite some time, trying to stay on my &quot;high&quot; as long as  possible.  Rutherfurd transported me so thoroughly, not only to my native  city but back in time.  Through his amazing research, I was able to picture  what my old stomping grounds of Clapham and Vauxhall (or Vaux's Hall) and  Lavender Hill used to be like, say, 500 years ago.  He taught me so much  about my city, my language, and my roots.  How many Brits. know that they  have perhaps more French blood in their veins than Anglo-Saxon?  Using  names such as Barnikel the Dane, Penny the Huguenot, or Meredith, descended  from the Welsh, I was able to keep the characters straight througout the  novel.  The Doggets and Duckets and Bulls were sometimes confusing but that  did not spoil my enjoyment of each little story within a story. I  thoroughly recommend this book!
B000002VMH|5.0|It didn't take long for this album to become one of my favorites, up there  with Sgt. Pepper and Dark Side of the Moon!  I call this record not just  simply marvelous, but as some actor said, simply mahhhvelous.  Maybe with  even more h's!  But that would take up space and detract attention. Keep up  the good work, Annie!  You're now my favorite woman singer!  Keep on  believing in the good vibration!
B00000AFHM|5.0|...I would need a replacement by now. I fully agree with most other  reviews, this truly is a monumental work in the genre. Pop albums don't get  much more infectious than this...
B000003RCY|5.0|Rammstein is a great band, lots of amazing sounds in this music. Their  live concerts are even better. They may sing about rather odd things, but  just because the cover of the album &quot;represents a superior race&quot;  as the improperly educated call it, and they sing about subjects that are  out of an average human beings comprehension doesn't mean they are Nazis.  Sure... They roll their Rs from the tip of their tounge like Hitler, but  that doesn't make them automatically Nazis. &quot;A music fan from  Hmburg&quot; ... A real German OR a real metal fan would not compare this  music to Hitler's speeches.
B00000AFDW|3.0|The way I see it, after 18 years apart, this cd was about what I expected.  Not great, but a start.The shining moments for me include, &quot;Psycho  Circus&quot;, &quot;Into The Void&quot; and &quot;Raise Your  Glasses&quot;.Kiss has never had an all the way thru great studio album,  and they still do not.You know what though, so what?!They still are the  greatest live band in the world. All these young punks out there today  should take notes,Kiss is what rock and roll(over)is suppost to be about.  No whiners allowed,long live the best, KISS!
B000002GOZ|4.0|love him or hate him, you can't deny Adams' talent after listening to this  album.  the quality of his songs, his eventual legacy, is proven by the  transition to the unplugged format.  no need to categorize this one as a  guilty pleasure;  call it what it is:  good music
B00000AFWW|5.0|Not being a fan of that depressing &quot;punk&quot; and &quot;grunge&quot;  era stuff, I bought this album after hearing only the awsome title track,  hoping Courtney and the band have moved on (grunge is dead,in case some of  you had'nt noticed). Well apparently they have, and have come up with a  five-star rocker.There is not a single bad song on this cd, and in  particular the songs &quot;Malibu&quot;, &quot;Boys on the radio&quot;  &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot; and &quot;Awful&quot; are some of the best rock  songs in years. This album also finally showcases the bands extrordinary  playing,Mellissa Aur der Maur's thumping basslines and Eric Erlanderson's  tearing riffs sparkle over Love' much improved vocals and Patty Schemel's  pounding drums. This is a far improved effort over &quot;Live through  This&quot;.
B000002H97|3.0|This is a let-down, since it was really hyped up. The only songs worth  listening to are Sad But True, Unforgiven, Nothing Else Matters, and  Wherever I May Roam. But it was almost a goodbye to their metal roots,  since they decided to bring out Load after. I would buy this cd only if you  want to hear the true MetallicA one last time.
B000002TQV|5.0|From start to finish this album puts me in some sort of blissful trance.  Everyone I've convinced to listen to it has thought it's incredible (except  perhaps my mother, but what did I expect). Thom just sings how and what I'd  sing if It'd been me, the music spirals and twists just like it would if I  was playing it, and if I could make an album it'd sound exactly like this.  Particularly strong songs are Fake Plastic Trees, Just (which incidentally  may have the greatest music video ever made), My Iron Lung, Bulletproof ...  I wish I was, Bones and of course fade out/ street spirit (arpeggiated Am,  C, Em with a descending D C B on the B string for any other budding  guitarists). Radiohead can blend spontaneity and structure like no other  band I've heard and that's what makes them so unique, brilliant and  endlessly listenable. Far, far superior to Pablo, and closer to the heart  than OK Computer, it's all good.
0671015206|1.0|It tell you how the millonares live, but it keeps repeting itself. if you  wanna know something new please don't get thisEND
B000008H1R|5.0|if anyone is thinking of starting a library of late 60's/early 70's  english-influenced album rock, this is the definitive place to begin. all  the tracks are classic, the arrangements superb and the instrumentation  pure.
B0000027F3|5.0|Many people who live in Alpena, Michigan all their lives never heard of  Judas Priest, but I've lived in California and Chicago, and I wasn't born  in HickTown, Michigan, so I know what Judas Priest is!!!!!!!! This is the  single best cd Judas Priest has ever put out!!!! The only let-down is  Battle Hymn. It was so short, I thought it was part of One Shot at Glory!  Anybody who has even the inklings of a metalhead, buy this cd!!!!!!!!!
B000009DUY|5.0|I must admit, I have not heard the soundtrack. Right here on the net, I've  heard 30 seconds (no more?) of Hymn to the Fallen. But I tell ya, that may  have been the most beautiful 30 seconds of music, I've ever heard ...  Theres something about it, that Williams-magic, you can't really descripe.  I'm looking forward to seeing the film ... AND GETTING THE SOUNDTRACK!!!
B000002TPS|5.0|Every song on here is great, and I mean every one. Sure, it's a little bit  slower than Killing is my business, but you can still feel the MegadetH  quality in it. The title song is the best, and I have a part of it stapled  up on my door. The Victory one always makes me nostalgic for the 80's, when  metal reigned supreme. Whenever they say, &quot;Not even close to  overdose,&quot; I know they will be kicking ass for a long long time!!!
B000002OR4|5.0|This ... this score is the most beautiful score ever written by anyone,  ever! &quot;Remembrances&quot; is so amazing ... I mean, holy ****! Get it  now, and forget everything else!!!!! PERFECT SOUNDTRACK!!!
0425152251|4.0|The thriller is good until we find out who Sophie is, although it makes us  think about who we really are. Anyway, the story really could have been  sustained to make a better book.<br />But the parts about philosophy are  great, explaining complicated theories in simple words. Specially as an  introduction to western philosophy, this book achieves its goal!<br />I  couldn't understand the review by Kirkus Reviews! Why do they think that  &quot;Gaarder can fool Norwegian youths into learning philosophy, but savvy  American kids won't be so easily hoodwinked.&quot;??? As I see it, he  doesn't believe that american kids can learn philophosy, an idea  from  which I totally disagree. They really were very unfortunate in that  comment!
B000002MJC|5.0|Same great DM sound with added guitars and live drums. This is their  hardest album to date. If you like Violator, then you'll flip over their  '93 set. Definately one of their best releases!!
B000002H48|5.0|I was very sceptical about ordering this cd, but I am very glad that I  did.  It is a must have or any James Taylor or Doobie Brothers fan.  Their  version of &quot;Taking it to the Steet&quot; is phonominal. Over all, it  is a great CD with an outstanding line-up of singers and the sound quality  is excellent.
B000000WCA|5.0|THE FAB FIVE DEBUT WITH THIS HIT ALBUM APPROPRIATELY ENTITLED  &quot;SPICE&quot;. ALL THE SONGS ARE TOTALLY &quot;SPICEY&quot;. THE BEST  SONGS ARE &quot;MAMA&quot;,&quot;NAKED&quot;,&quot;WHO DO YOU THINK YOU  ARE&quot;,&quot;SAY YOU'LL BE THERE&quot;,&quot;2 BECOME 1&quot;,&quot;LAST  TIME LOVER&quot;,AND &quot;WANNABE&quot;. THIS CD IS A MUST FOR ALL  YOUNGSTERS AS WELL AS ADULTS. BUY IT NOW!!
B000006NPY|5.0|This is really good example of quality, non-commercial music from the U.S.  On this CD I'm really missing faster songs, but Ava Adore's fine. I hope  the Smashing Pumpkins next CDs will be even better...
068484267X|5.0|My mother sent me the book and at first glance, I thought &quot;Oh no, not  another inspirational book!&quot;. But as I wasn't reading a book at that  time I thought I might as well see what it's about. Once I started,  however, I couldn't put the book down and sad as it was I didn't want it to  end either.
0553266306|5.0|This is not great literature like &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; or  &quot;Brother's Karamazov&quot; but it is the best at what it attempts to  be--possibly the most suspenseful, can't-put-it-down thriller ever written.  The tension is wound so tight that I actually HAD to put it down to collect  myself and catch my breath.  The guy who gave it one star is seriously  delusional and bitter.
B00000251N|5.0|What we consider a good album or not has to do with many factors, most of  them with what it makes us feel. Love, nostalgia, fun, sadness and on. But  then comes along the music that awakes the most spiritually side of our  human nature. I think Mr. Diamond achives in this superb album the joy of  existence, the magnificence of admiring life from its simplest form. I  really find it hard to listen to this music without closing my eyes and  just...BE.
0553275976|5.0|Yes, this is a very good book. I was completely absorbed by it, but I  didn't find it &quot;entertaining&quot; or funny, as most of the other  reviewers seem to do. It's full of a dark sort of humor, but this didn't  make me laugh very often. Most of the characters are as large as life and  very &quot;real&quot; and that makes the story even more painful to read.  After all, practically everything in this book goes terribly wrong, almost  all the characters fail to realize their ideals, fail to transcend their  own mediocrity and fail to live up to their own moral standards. They all  leave a trail of victims in their wake. It's a sad story, really, which  paints a very gloomy picture of modern society, a society whose members  have such a hard time finding some meaning in what they do and what happens  to them. The much criticized ending effectively deepens the pessimism,  since it offers us a glimpse into the future: a tunnel without a glimmer of  light at the end. I often asked myself if Mr. Wolfe sees any hope for us.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the record that blasted alternative music to the world. It is my  favorite alternative album and if I got stuck on a deserted island, I would  want to have this disc with me. If Kurt were alive today, he would be proud  of how this record has affected us.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I was a huge Alanis fan about two years ago.  After about three years  without a new album I thought she would be finished but after hearing her  new song, Thank You, I know she will be back bigger than before.   &quot;Thank You&quot; Alanis!!!
B0000046KM|5.0|I bought this CD because I loved the lyrics to so many of the songs included in it. But I fell in love with it because of Ms. Horn. Great renditions. Great style. Now that I've bought several more of her CDs I can say that -- without question -- this is her very best.Just a totally lovely, memorable, haunting effort.
0399143904|1.0|The 2 possible scenerios:<br />  1) Either Clancy didn't write this book, and  then was too busy to read it or   2) He fired his editor, and now we know  who the real talent is.<br />The book is unbelieveably repetitive: it could  have been written in half the pages.  There are technical errors not worthy  of a Clancy novel.  The re-use of phrases (&quot;faster then closing a  zipper&quot; and &quot;niggeredly&quot; were both used 4 times that I  counted) made me scream. And Tom, Richmond is not a borough of New York.   <br />This is the worst book of all time.
B000002HPT|5.0|When I first heard it, I was a somewhat dissapointed.  I thought it was a  bit mellow.  However, as is the case with all of their albums, once I  listened to it a few times, I truly began to appreciate the music.  Their  sound can be difficult to digest all at once, simply because of its sheer  complexity.  It takes a few times to hear it all.  Their prowess can be  best seen in the variety of their songs.  To be able to transition from  &quot;Just Let Me Breathe&quot; (one of their heaviest, most intense songs  ever) to &quot;Anna Lee&quot; (a slow melodic ballad) without loosing their  &quot;sound&quot; takes tremendous talent.  The song, &quot;Peruvian  Skies&quot; starts off sounding like one could dance a waltz to it, and  ends up as a driving riffy heavy metal song.  Unlike other progressive  metal bands who lose their edge after a few albums (like Queensryche after  Operation: Mindcrime), Dream Theater maintains power and intensity, even  through the slow songs (it doesn't have to be loud and fast to be intense).   Falling Into Infinity may be the band's most well-written and performed  album ever, and it certainly puts to shame anything else on the Metal  scene.
0553573403|4.0|If you're looking for the usual mixture of wizards (or Aes Sedai or  whatever) whipping spells at every little orc that runs their way, this  book is not for you.  This first installment of Martin's new fantasy -- a  potential classic -- involves  a feudal struggle for power among seven  noble houses -- some good, some bad, some both -- following the death of  the king.  Meanwhile, the deposed son and daughter from a deposed former  king plot in exile, and an invasion of (some) supernatural creatures from  the wintry North &quot;beyond the Wall&quot; looms ahead.  Fast-paced, this  story takes a number of unexpected twists and does not sugarcoat the  violence inherent in such a society.  As an added bonus, we have the  novelty of rooting for an entire family -- the hardy and noble Starks of  Winterfell who guard the North-- rather than the stereotypical orphan.  Subsequent volumes promise more traditional fantasy elements,  including  dragons, but the road Martin seems to have mapped out may avoid most  cliches.  An excellent story that I would heartily recommend to those who  have become jaded by the current state of the fantasy market.  This book  probably deserves a five, but I'm just trying to avoid dissapointment if  the sequel doesn't measure up.
B0000029DD|5.0|Listening to this incredible album is moving enough for the music alone,  but it is tough knowing that we won't ever get to hear what JB would have  done afterwards. JB's voice is a wonder as it covers a range of  styles...the music is intense, complex, dramatic and impossible to  pigeonhole...songs like &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot;,  &quot;Last Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Lilac Wine&quot;, and &quot;So Real&quot;  will leave you stunned and moved and will stay with you. Listen to it on  headphones to hear all the details of this excellently produced CD. There  are so few times when one hears a musical force who is the real thing and  can do it all, and when I heard these songs (and saw his concert) I thought  he would be one of the greats. It's still shocking that he's gone, but at  least this album is hear to stay.
0670848352|5.0|I first read Chickenhawk in 1984. I have read it several times since.  Those readings have allowed me to seem to know Mr Mason on a unique,  personal level. That feeling, and his writing style, made the book  interesting. While not quite the impact as Chickenhawk, there are stories  in this book, especially near the end, that, if you've read Chickenhaw, you  have to read Life After Vietnam.
038097617X|5.0|&quot;Watermelon&quot; is a wonderfullly touching and humorous book - and  it was so much fun to read!  The only problem is that when you finish  reading it - you feel like you feel like you are saying good-bye  to a  close friend.  I can't wait until the rest of Marian Keyes' books are  published in the USA!!!!
0811821846|5.0|If you love Chewbacca and cookies, then you will love this book.  This  book contains some hidden recipes that would even make Chewbacca growl  louder than ever.  What a great book
B000000OF6|5.0|This by far is Queens best album ever. It holds there most prize songs and  lifts them to the greatest platue.
B000000W3G|5.0|I've been listening to the Pumpkins since their 1991 release of Gish. This  box set of b-sides is a perfect accompanyment to the incredible works of  Mellon Collie. It gives an incredible look into the eyes of the Smashing  Pumpkins, along with a taste of James Iha's writing abilities.
B00000099Y|5.0|Was a little difficult to like after the awesome Undertow, but I've  listened to this one hundreds of times and it never gets old.  It gets  better.  This is in a category by itself.  Buy it.
B000002KZA|4.0|Gloomy,I wouldn't advise it to get out of a case of the blues, but I think  the flowing industrial energy of it rules.  The songs on the first side  kind of flow together, that's one element that gets my heart beating.  &quot;Everything Counts&quot; is my favorite track on the album; I  sometimes find myself humming that at home or school. It's a must for any  fan of 80's techno music.
0896760839|4.0|This book would have to be described as &quot;the bible&quot; of late 16th  century costuming.  It is a goldmine for anyone interested in the actual  creation of garments of the period. <br />I would not be without my copy; I  actually own two, so I can lend one out without having to be without  it.<br />The only flaws are that it is incomplete, lacking much of the  undergarments of the period, and that there are a few mistakes in some of  the patterning, which can have interesting results... certainly make a  toile of the garments first, but generally this book is a gem.   <br />Note:  this book assumes that the prospective sewer has quite an advanced skill in  sewing; if you can't sew without instructions, you might find it  challenging, and you need to expand the patterns up from the scaled down  illustrations
B000002SYG|5.0|It's unfortunate that personal tragedy linked to stardom caused this  group's demise. Culture Club's music certainly had staying power. This CD  still remains one of my favorite's from the 80's groups. I recently had the  opportunity to see the group live with all it's original members, and the  magic was still there. This is a must have CD if you were even remotely  into music in the 80's.
B000002JKA|5.0|Although some of the people who heard this album describe it as a  &quot;hard understanding&quot; or &quot;too much technique&quot;, we all  must admit that it broke the existing bariers in music and paved the way  for new kind of expression and understanding the music.
0609603086|3.0|After reading &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot; I waited eagerly for every  title since. Sorry to say but &quot;Hammer of Eden&quot; is one in series  of very disappointing novels written by Ken the plots are very obvious and  the characters you just wish they where more deep and detailed. I am  waiting for his next &quot;Pillars of the Earth&quot;. But still he is one  of my favorite writers.
0684847817|5.0|I was spellbound by Froud's &quot;Faeries,&quot; and I think this sequel  is even better!  If the descriptions of faeries from good to bad don't draw  you in, the beautiful illustrations will.  <br />Once again, brilliant--I  especially love the book's &quot;flip-over&quot; design that seperates the  good faeries from the bad (as well as the &quot;trick&quot; pictures  in-between.  A definite must-have for any fan of Froud or  &quot;Faeries&quot;
B000002KJL|5.0|I have owned this album for almost twenty years and it never gets old.   &quot;Down to the Waterline&quot; by itself is worth the price.
B000002UVX|5.0|Band of Gypsies is the album which truly expresses Jimi Hendrix's talent  and power with his guitar.  The baselines and drumbeats are steady allowing  Jimi to play with or transcend above them; the effect is mesmerizing.  You  can literally sit down, listen to this cd and be completely engrossed.  As  much as I enjoy such releases as Experience, Axis: Bold as Love, and  Electric Ladyland, they do not provide the true representation of Jimi's  skill that Band of Gypsies offers.  If you want to truely hear Hendrix, you  have to listen to his live recordings, and there's no doubt in my mind that  Band of Gypsies is one of the best.  If you love Jimi Hendrix or are just  an overall guitar fan, I garuntee you'll like this album.
0671015206|5.0|This book concentrates on the saving aspect and very successfully gets  across the message that you got to be extremely frugal in your habits and  try not to live up to the so-called high society Johns.  This book could  straight away save you thousands of dollars in case you are planning to buy  a car or a house.  This will also teach you that a bird in hand is two in  the bush.  But one aspect I feel that has been left out is that it hardly  concentrates on our abilities to increase our earnings and instead stresses  on keeping what you have got.  All in all a great book and the savings are  immediate.  Highly recommended.  (In case you want to read some inspiring  stuff try &quot;Every Street Paved with Gold&quot; by Kim Woo-Choong  [Chairman, Daewoo].  It will change your life - for better).
B00000DC4A|5.0|&quot;On a Day like Today&quot; is yet another masterpiece featuring not  only instantly catchy rock tunes but also beautyful ballads...it really is  a unique selection of songs that are sure to excite many and send shivers  down numerous backs! &quot;On a Day like Today&quot;, the first single, was  only a hint to what was waiting on the album... The first two songs on the  CD do kind of resemble the singe in the sense that they both include rock  and slow parts that blend into powerful songs. &quot;Getaway&quot; features  great guitar sections and is altogether a perfect rock song; as are  &quot;Fearless&quot; and &quot;I'm a Liar&quot;, which most directly strike  by their capturing choruses. Two other rockers remind of songs featured on  precious albums by Bryan: &quot;Before the Night is Over&quot; is in some  ways similar to &quot;One Night Love Affair&quot; and &quot;I Don't Wanna  Live Forever&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;We're Gonna Win&quot;. The  ballad &quot;Cloud Number Nine&quot; enchants as a truly cute tune.  &quot;If I Had You&quot; catches in a unique way and features guitar chords  that remind of U2. Another ballad worth mentioning is &quot;Where Angels  Fear to Tread&quot;, for which Bryan included string arrangements that  match so well with certain songs of his. All in all, Bryan has again made  an album that goes perfectly with his previous masterpieces and is going to  have his fans crave for hearing the songs live!
B000002AT6|5.0|Nothing else needs to be said.
B000002UJQ|2.0|1 or 2 good songs on this cd.  most of them are pretty much the same and  if you're into fast types of music you will not like this cd.
0380018179|5.0|Definitely a book for romantics, The Thorn Birds is vivid, exceptionally  engrossing, and just an all-around captivating thing to drown yourself in.   Colleen McCullough writes beautifully-absolutely beautifully-and her  finished product is gorgeous-there's no other way to describe it.
0399143904|2.0|Just finished 'Rainbow Six'. Big book. Big disappointment. I counted  probably 17 editing and continuity errors throughout the text. Apparently  there are also significant spelling errors, too. I don't expect this is a  $30 novel. It almost seems to be a ghost-written. Perhaps Tom is spending  too much time developing the computer game versions of his books? Even  worse, perhaps he's writing the books with the game in mind(!). Sorry but  this is one Clancy novel that is not worth buying. And I'll be reading the  next one in my local library.
0802130208|5.0|This book is nothing short of absolute genius.  True, it's hilarious.  However, it's hard not to notice the ominous parallels between the life of Ignatius and that of the author.  John Kennedy Toole saw through his eyes daily, the famed &quot;Great Folly of Man&quot;, and it made him sick.  Sadly,he took his own life to save himself from the barrage of corruption and blindness of the Truth. After a second reading, I came to a great realization.  Ignatius isn't Toole.  He's everybody whether they admit it or not.  Deep down we are ALL eccentric, and not that different from the &quot;crazies&quot; we shun.  We're all in the same boat, and nobody has ever expressed this in words better than Toole.  One thing's for sure: Toole is in a much better place now.  It's up to us to see through all the bulls*** we call &quot;normal&quot;.  Peace.
B000002GHH|5.0|While the up tempo numbers are great, its the ballads that are some of the  best I have ever heard.  What makes this album remarkable is that the tight  song craft is matched by spare and essential  playing from Jim Keltner,  Nick Lowe and Mr. Cooder.  This is how a four piece should sound, and this  is how it should be produced.  The producer is associated with McCabes  Guitar shop, where Hiatt honed his chops for these songs. He also put the  great Richard Thompson tribute together, also spare and restrained.   Other  Hiatt has always seemed less essential due to the darkness and economy of  this effort, so if you only by one Hiatt this is it.
6303443214|5.0|Interview of the Vampire was a completely provocative and exhilarating  book!  Unfortunately, Tom Cruise ruined the movie--he was unable to portray  Lestat's charisma, charm, desperation, or strength in a manner which would  be considered consistently believable. If I saw the movie first, I would  have NEVER bought the book.     END
0399143904|1.0|I have been a dedicated Clancy fan since &quot;Hunt&quot; came out way  back in 1984. It used to be that the only requirement to being a Clancy fan  was a desire to be entertained by a well crafted techno-thriller. Now, it  seems that you have to be a right-wing, anti-environment Republican to  enjoy his latest books. As a Democrat and environmentalist, this is the  last Clancy book I buy-next time I'm making a $25 donation to Greenpeace.  Unrealistic bad guys, a comic book plot, various elements taken from his  other books, and insulting pot shots at anybody who doesn't share his  political views all combine to  make R6 a real dog. Don't blow your money  on this piece of crap.
B000001DQI|5.0|Too bad there's only 5 star ratings!  This wonderful double cd is worth 5  times the cost!  There isn't a single piece that's not worth listening to  over and over again!  Truly their best work ever!
B000002G89|5.0|This is, along with Unplugged, Eric's most relaxed album. It's certainly  very &quot;pop&quot;, and it doesn't have as many guitar solos as most fans  would want, but it is a great effort. This album showed that Clapton could  make other kinds of songs, after the rock &amp; blues of Cream and Derek  &amp; The Dominos. The best songs here are the beautiful Let It Grow, his  cover of Marley's I Shot The Sheriff, Mainline Florida and Please Be With  Me.
B00000BKDV|5.0|Piece of Mind is the epitome of Maiden's sound. Speed bass and powerful  riffs are abundant, on tunes like Where Eagles Dare and Die With Your Boots  on. Probably Maiden's best effort, with Powerslave coming in at a close  second.
0688152023|5.0|I ordered 2 copies to GIVE AWAY to friends, &amp; I've shared this with  many more.  The exercises require concentration, and is challenging to  someone like me who has taken dance for a number of years, yet simple  enough for my unfit 70+years old mother to do. It's also been a great help  to me, as I've hurt my knee in a freak accident recently &amp; with these  exercises to choose from, I know I can get better without falling into  despair.
0060977493|4.0|i read this book like i am studying for some exam..it was hard to  understand the real meaning if u do a light reading..i think this book is a  best thing for literature students .. i like the way she describes things  to its minutest details..like about the yellow coloured chips..abt the  way..she repeats her words.. the story is not very new or different .. but  the way she narrates through the eyes of the kids.. is truly amazing. i  donot think she deserves the booker prize.. but she is lucky enough she got  away with it..
0136879721|5.0|Plain, simple common sense.  I have purchased about twelve copies of this  book to pass on.  Need I say more.
0385484518|5.0|I finished this book in one day, that is how good it really is.  I have a  hard time with the New York Times review by Alain de Botton who says that  the book &quot;finally fails to enlighten&quot;.  I disagree wholeheartedly  -- the book does not preach or does Mitch Albom think he he is changing the  world....the book places the importance on a man who really didn't know how  to live until he was dying. I think Mitch does a wonderful job of putting  that down on paper -- and it is up to the individual how much they can get  out of it.  Perhaps Alain just does not reflect on her life as easily as  the rest of us.  I ordered several copies, and I am going to give them to  my family and friends.  There isn't anyone in the world that couldn't  benefit from it.
B000003S5H|5.0|I was really amazed by the quality of this album and by the catchy tunes.  It really fits all kind of moods: grooves, pop and techno. My favorite song  in the album is by far All I need (beautiful voice). I would recommend it  to many friends.
044022165X|4.0|I have read a number of Grisham's novels and this was one of the better  ones. Rudy is a sympathetic lead character and his compatriots in the  sleezy law firm are humorous.  His distaste for lawyers again comes through  (don't any of his law characters have integrity?), but for a good read,  give this one a try.
B00000D9TK|5.0|This latest acheivement of Celine Dion, I think is her best thus far. With  oustanding musical orchestrations, and stirring French ballads, This is a  not-to-be-missed-attraction. It is true when they say you won't be able to  turn it off! It would be to diifficult to pick the best track, they all are  remarkable and unique.  This will transport you to a romantic France and  will envelope you in her superb singing in the French language! The one  word I would choose to best some up S'il Suffisait D'Aimer would be  &quot;FANTASTIQUE&quot;
B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic for the People is REM's masterpiece, which is saying something  from this band, who has consistently turned out great music.  From Drive to  Find the River, there isn't a clunker on here (although I wish they could  have found another track to replace the New Orleans instrumental track,  which is the weakest cut).  I believe that both Nightswimming and Find the  River would have seen the same success as Everybody Hurts had they been  released as singles.  As the saying goes, if you only buy one album...
B000002MFN|5.0|This is easily one of Madonna's best albums, interesting, provacative  lyrics but still fun to listen to.
B000002MU3|4.0|Monster was a drastic change for REM from their previous two CD's Out of  Time and Automatic for the People, which gave them their much deserved  superstar status.  People were shocked and have ragged on this CD more than  any other REM CD.  But REM wanted to lock the mandolins and keyboards so  prominent on those two CDs in the closet and make a rock and roll record.   And they did a very good job.  What's the Frequency Kenneth is one of their  catchiest rockers, while I Took Your Name and Let Me In are great car radio  songs.  I will say that REM's worst song ever is on Monster (Bang and Blame  - give me Shiny Happy People any day) which knocks this down to 4 stars  instead of 5.  Play this one when you've had a crappy day!
B000002UWF|5.0|Louis Prima collector's series CD is the best CD I ever bought!  From  &quot;Jump, Jive &amp; Wail&quot; (GAP Khakis commercial), to &quot;The  Lip&quot; ..this CD is packed with tunes that make you tap your feet and  turn the volume way, way up! For the best feel-good, big-time swing'n  sounds, this CD is a must...and will not disappoint you.   I also bought  Brian Setzer's CD with the Jump, Jive &amp; Wail track...don't bother...buy  the Prima CD...its WAY better.
0684847817|5.0|Never in my life have I seen or owned a book that moved and enchanted me  so much by just flipping through the pages to glance at the pictures! They  practically come to life right before your eyes and the beauty that they  all posess is just breath-taking! I have loved and believed in faeries ever  since I was born and the magick that Brian Froud can weave with his  paintbrush is so very inspiring and fantastic that I couldn't even begin to  describe it. From Honesty to Boon to the Green Lady and the Faeries of  Wisdom, the Faery Godmother and the Faery of Pure Joy and Morgan Le Fay I  was entranced. I couldn't imagine anything more beautiful to look at unless  it was the real thing, and I just wanted to thank Brian Froud for sharing  his gift and Terri Windling for putting words to the pictures.
0399143904|4.0|I've been a fan of Clancy since I first read The Hunt for Red October.   Without Remorse giving Clark's background was a winner.  I thoroughly  enjoyed Rainbow Six, and while Clancy seems to have gotten Dickens'  contract who cares?  Rainbow Six is exciting and suspenseful.  True Clancy  fans will enjoy the book immensely and still be waiting anxiously for his  next.  Clark and Ding's escapades will keep readers up until the wee hours  refusing to put down the book.  A must read.
0671867369|5.0|Ambrose tells history like a novelist and writes novels like an historian.   Band of Brothers lets the reader feel what war is really like.  Battles  are personal events, something that news accounts or historical reviews do  not convey. I have a much better understanding of the bonds that my father  had with his WWII buddies.  <br />This book puts you so much into the minds of  the men of Easy company that you can actually see the tracer bullets and  hear the incoming shells.  It presents the horror of war as something that  the world should avoid, yet it also shows how the indominable spirit of  ordinary citizens prevails even when faced with the possibility of instant  death.
0345347951|4.0|This is the kind of solid scifi that diminishes only slowly with the  passing years.  The book has a steady believability from page 1 that  continues all the way to the end -- a surprising feat considering the  subject matter, the final, natural conclusion of the human race.   &quot;Full of compassion&quot;, &quot;all the essentials&quot;,  &quot;classic&quot; are a few of the descriptions of this book that I would  agree with.  I'd be raving right now were this 1953, when the book was  written, but even now, the book is a great read.<br />There just seems to be  the right mix in this book:  just enough action, dialogue, technology,  commentary, prophecy, character development, etc. to keep a large audience  satisfied.  Everything you need is here.  There is an astounding variety of  topics that are briefly mentioned with astounding delicacy and tact:   Christian religion, mysticism, war, divine purpose, political power,  aesthetics, etc.  Although the book might not keep you page turning as fast  as some others, you'll be satisfied.  And probably, like me, you'll not  quite know why, but you'll recommend it to others.
0061091669|5.0|Spoto's research and treatment of Marilyn's life and death results in one  of the most fascinating biographies I've read.  It's excellent!
B000002UA0|3.0|This a surrealistic album!!! I began hearing to PF with &quot;Wish you  were here&quot;, than &quot;Dark side&quot;, than &quot;The wall&quot;.  Finally I got this. It is just not the Pink Floyd we admire. This CD is so  abstract and childish, but still funny, specially Gnome and Bike. Have this  in mind before gettting this: it is completely different from the newer  albums... COMPLETELY.
B000002J1S|5.0|This was singer/flute player Peter Gabriel's final album with Genesis, and  boy did he go out on a strong note!  The lyrics are almost all his, while  the wonderful, brilliant music was a group effort by keyboardist Tony  Banks, bassist/guitarist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Steve Hacket,  percussionaist/back-up singer Phil Collins, and Pete.  The lyrics tell a  surrealistic urban adventure story, and Pete's synopsis is printed in the  notes.  Not only is this Genesis' only all-studio double album, but it is  an opera and it was performed as such when on tour.  While it did not sell  as many copies as Pink Floyd's _The Wall_ (also a double disc rock opera,  performed as such on tour), it is as great a musical achievement, and just  as much a classic.  Like other great Genesis albums, there is a full range  of sounds, moods, styles, tempos, rhythms, vocals, and instrumental  passages.  Tony sounds like Rubinstein on the Steinway grand piano, and  like Rick Wakeman (Yes) on the ARP synthesizer, but really he sounds like  Tony Banks throughout -- a truly gifted composer/arranger and keyboard  wizard of the 20th century.  On &quot;The Waiting Room,&quot; an  instrumental piece, you might easily mistake Genesis for Chinese folk  musicians; you sometimes get the idea that there's no limit to their  musical abilities.  There are exciting rock anthems (title track,  &quot;Back in NYC,&quot; &quot;It&quot;) which get your blood pumping, your  spine tingling, and your spirit soaring.  There are soothing melodies which  can bring you to tears (&quot;Hairless Heart&quot;).  Even if you don't  understand the lyrics and the story that they tell, they still work  together with the music to provide you with a thrilling, entertaining,  spiritual experience.  If you are in the mood to hear something different  and interesting, then listen to this album.
B000002UB6|3.0|[NOTE: There are two reviews of \\"Let It Be\\". The first review was originally published on Amazon.com October 20, 1998, the second March 6, 2000]<br />----<br />\\"Review 1 - The Messy Let It Be Massacre, October 20, 1998\\":  I'm sure people (some of them, myself included) have heard all the negative hype about this record, and wanted to know what was up.  I mean, come on, it's The Beatles, only on very rare occasions did they misstep, so what's up with this particular one?  It's all live.  It's extremely messy.  There's studio chatter on a lot of the tracts.  Two of the tracks (\\"Maggie Mae\\", \\"Dig It\\"), one is 50 seconds long, the other 40.  They're two throwaways.  Then we get to the (in)famous contribution from the wall-of-sound guy Phil Spector. I, like most other people, think that what he did pretty much ruins it.  Across the Universe, it isn't that bad, but would have been better in its unvarnished state.  One thing I like is what he did with \\"I Me Mine\\", which is a great song.  The original is on the \\"Anthology 3\\" record (along with the original master version of The Long and Winding Road that Phil Spector ruined with his wall of sound.),  and is far too short.  What he did with that works. Long and Winding Road, I'm so glad they finally issued the original song.  It's so much better than the \\"official\\" version.<br /><br />This is a separate entity for the Beatles discography.  For The Beatles, yes it is sloppy, yes it is flawed, yes it was a mistake for The Beatles to bring in Phil Spector.  Despite all of that, it's a charming record.  It has to be appreciated in itself.  It's like an official bootleg.  You see the songs in process.  It's like part of the Anthology canon.  There are some very charming moments.<br /><br />One thing about this particular record tho', is though it gets bad hype all the time, this blows \\"Beatles For Sale\\" out of the water.  No comparison.  Whatsoever.  To me, that is by far the worst Beatles record.<br /><br />Oh, and whatever theysay about Dig a Pony, don't believe them.  It's one of my favorite tracks off this record, and I'm surprised that this in particular they pick on a lot.  \\"Two of Us\\" is good too.  Those two and \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"Let It Be\\" are my favorite tracks.<br /><br />Also, it has to be taken in context, The Beatles, forever trying something new, were challenging themselves to make a record without overdubbing.  It was all live.  After they made the record, they thought it was \\"rubbish\\" (As Lennon called it), and proceeded to record the masterpiece Abbey Road.  And they were fighting all the time.  George Martin walked at on this album because of the tensions between The Beatles themselves.  And still they recorded this.  Granted, it's a messy record, but any other artists who were going thru what they were at this time, there's no way they could record a record this good.  It's definitely worth having.  It's Raw, Its Live, Its Messy.  It's still really good too.  And remember, a substandard Beatles record is better than most others best work. You'll be missing something if you don't get this.  As one review once said, \\"All that said [talking about the problems I talked about], the album is on the whole underrated, even discounting the fact that a sub-standard Beatles record is better than almost any other group's best work.\\"<br /><br />It you want the Three Beatles Masterpieces, they're \\"Sgt. Pepper\\", \\"The White Album, and Abbey Road\\". It's amazing that one band can have so many classics in their discography.  It a band could reach even 1/4 of the genius of any of these three, they'd have a masterpiece. And here are THREE! And that's only the top ... they have so much more!<br /><br />-----<br />\\"Review 2 - The final official word from the Beatles...., March 6, 2000\\":  An interesting album as a whole. An interesting note about the production is that The Beatles shelved this album, and Phil Spector was brought in long after they had recorded it to sort through this mess and make a feasible album. I'm sure there is more stuff they could have included on it. The \\"Ain't She Sweet\\" off Anthology 3 was very good. There are many unreleased cover tunes from this era. Also, I think the single \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" should have been released on there too. But for some strange reason, it was on the single only, making it one of their many B-Sides.<br /><br />Another interesting thing is they totally got away from the point of this album. It was to play live. Well, they did, and I guess they thought it really sucked or something, because they sure as hell backed off and went to their usual recording style with their last album and their swan song Abbey Road. Interesting to note, however, that the last session they had as a group (with Lennon not present and not counting the Anthology session) they recorded I Me Mine, which was the very definition of all the problems plaguing The Beatles as a whole.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Messy, live, two or three tracks WAY over produced. We had to wait TWENTY SIX years to get a decent version of Across the Universe. (Anthology 2 is by far the best of the commercially available 3 versions)<br /><br />I'm the author of \\"The Messy Let It Be Massacre\\". If you find that helpful, or you do not like it, please put your vote here, as it will go on my review page.
B000001EQT|5.0|&quot;The Slider&quot; is the definitive blueprint for glam rock. It  sounds as vital today as when it  made it's debut in the 1970's.
B000000YG5|5.0|Rollins at his best!  This is one disk that any jazz lover should own.   Modern tenorists would do well to study his intonation, expression and  agility on this work.  Too often, he is overlooked by those who think that  50s and 60s jazz sax began and ended with Coltrane.  This recording  demonstrates otherwise.
0783226063|5.0|A long and confusing story? Perhaps so because it drags you into a  fantastic world that is complete; appearing to have few reference points in  this world.  Rereading or viewing the story again takes you back to an  increasingly familiar place rich with new discoveries.     Then it dawns on  me! This could have been written as a historical novel of a Russian dynasty  with the Orthodox church and trade routes to the orient etc. But it would  never have been as exciting and interesting without the Spice and the worms  and the galaxy far far........     END
B000002KKC|5.0|I didn't like this CD at first.  But I listened to it a few more times and  it grew on me.  I'm especially fond of Storms and Beautiful Child, which is  ironic because I generally don't appriciate Stevie Nick's songs as much as  on this album.  In context, it's rather different than a lot of the Pop of  the period (late '70s, early '80s).  I'm glad that it isn't just a sequel  to Rumors.
630233683X|5.0|This film is just flawless! I recommend it to everyone!     END
B000000WCV|5.0|excellent sounds insanely great rhythm
B000001GRZ|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of cello music ever made. Fournier  knows this music inside and out, and he probes the depths for what is  hidden in these suites. Furthermore, Fournier's sound and technique are  almost without peer. This album and the ones by Casals could be taken as  the absolute references for these works. The recorded sound is superb,  especially in this reissue.
B000002NBY|5.0|At the same time Peter Gabriel's &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; was popular, Paul Simon's &quot;Graceland&quot; captured the true spirit and sound of African music. The rhythms are complex, the instrumentation impressive, and it's Paul Simon.  What can you say? This is a great album!
B00000BKDS|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  There are  so many great songs on here like Phantom of the Opera, Prowler, Sanctuary,  Transylvania, Iron Maiden, well lets just say the entire album is great.   This is probably the most important album in heavy metal history.  If it  was not for this album, bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax,  Skid Row, and so many other bands might not ever have existed.  If they did  exist without the influence of this masterpiece, they would have sounded  completely different.   Every heavy metal fan should buy this album, and  every Iron Maiden fan should by this album, too because there is some  AWESOME multimedia stuff.  You get live videos of Iron Maiden and Prowler  from the Rainbow in 1980, and lots of other cool stuff like rare pictures  of Eddie, tour information and much more.  This is a MUST!!!
B00000AFFF|5.0|AS A LONG TIME BACHARACH FAN, MY FAVORITE BACHARACH SONGS ARE HIS  INSTRUMENTALS, BUT MORESO THE ONE'S HE HAS SUNG.  HIS VOICE IS LESS THAN  PERFECT, BUT JUST FITS HIS MUSIC SO WELL.  ELVIS COSTELLO'S VOICE IS VERY  SIMILAR TO BURT'S VOICE, BUT BETTER.  NOTHING HAS COMPLIMENTED HIS MUSIC  MORE.  I WAS NOT SURE ABOUT THIS ALBUM, AS I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BIG ELVIS  COSTELLO FAN, BUT EACH OF THESE SONGS GET BETTER EACH TIME YOU LISTEN TO  THEM.  BOUGHT IT TWO WEEKS AGO, AND HAVE LISTENED TO NOTHING ELSE.  CLASSIC  BACHARACH MUSIC SO CLOSE TO WHAT HE WAS WRITING BACK IN THE 60'S AND 70'S.   CANNOT SAY ENOUGH GOOD THINGS ABOUT THIS ALBUM, CAN ONLY HOPE FOR ANOTHER  RELEASE FROM THESE TWO SOMETIME SOON.
0688052304|4.0|I listened to this on tape and have to admit, I would have struggled to  get through if I tried to read it.  This book raised some important issues  and did it in an entertaining and thought provoking way.  I enjoyed the  back and forth between past and present, the references to Greek philosophy  and the telling of the journey itself. I cared about Phaedrus and his son.   After listening to it I did buy the book just to be able to go back over  some of the parts that had so many layers.  It seems people have a strong  reaction to this book because when I asked the bookstore clerk where I  could find Zen, another customer joined the conversation to tell me how  many times he had read it.  This book also caused me (and my books on tape  group) to listen to Lila, his follow-up novel which continues Phaedrus'  story years later.  It was also one of the books the group has listened to  that generated the most discussion.
B000009PNY|1.0|Can anybody really do a cover of a Depeche Mode song without literally  copying the song right down to each synthesizer riff? This album proves  both answers. Smashing Pumpkins and The Cure do decent and well-received  versions of two good songs, but everything else just doesn't say Depeche  Mode. DM has a sound that few can imitate, and this album only shows that  some bands suck at it. Did they really expect people to accept Rammstein  doing a cover of &quot;Stripped&quot;? It sucks so bad...as do most of the  other covers here. If the NIN version of &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; were  here, it might be a saving grace, but overall, get the original versions.  It is far more rewarding to listen to than this garbage.
B00000BKDY|2.0|This was the first Iron Maiden album which was not great. This album  marked a very big change in the band's music. On Somewhere in Time,  keyboards were very evident on the album. There are some good songs on this  album like Deja Vu, Sea of Madness and Stranger in a Strange Land, but  there are also some awful songs like Heaven Can Wait and The Loneliness of  a Long Distance Runner.  If you are want to get into Iron Maiden, don't buy  this one first I would reccomend KILLERS of PIECE OF MIND to start off  with.  If you already enjoy the early Iron Maiden albums, give this one a  shot.
0812548094|4.0|Well, I really did like this book.  However, it seemed to mirror another  author that I also greatly admire.  I am happy to say that he gets back to  some more original writing in later books.
B000001EPB|5.0|I am very much Scottish and this CD really captures the heart and soul of  all who is Celtic.
B000002BMD|5.0|Wow, is all I can say.  I'd never heard these guys before I bought the  album--all I knew was that they were supposed to be reminiscent of the  Clash.  Q gave this a rare five stars, and with good reason--it's quite  amazing.  I like everything about it.  Crikey.
B00000DGUG|5.0|Alanis follows her first hit single, &quot;You Ought to Know&quot; with a  new perspective captured in &quot;Thank You.&quot;  &quot;Thank You&quot;  is so alive with expression to say that over time, one moves beyond denial  and anger to a bitter yet wise reflection of what's happened from a hurtful  relationship.  Just when you think she's hit her peak, she consistently  bursts back onto the scene with something even better.  Thank you Alanis!
B00000DBXL|5.0|Get on down with some Cake. I have just let this CD be my theme music for  the next while, or as long as the can prolong my attention span....One song  tends to blend into the next and I can see that adding up what is usually a  legendary ALBUM when they are all good tunes.....At least in my  head....Also, I suggest to fans of Cake who don't know of the Mother Hips  and their new record &quot;Later Days&quot; to check them out if they can  find a copy...
6304681496|1.0|Note that in &quot;Con Air&quot; one of the leading villains, the right-hand man to the arch villain Cyrus &quot;the Virus&quot; [Malkovich] is a &quot;Black Militant&quot; [Ving Rhames].  In the beginning when the prisoners are being loaded onto the plane, we're told that [Rhames] is not only a militant killer of white policemen, but that he had also written a book praised by the New York Times as a &quot;wake up call to black America.&quot; Now when they talk about s--t flying, be sure this is it.  In not so subtle terms of the white-mindedness that makes the U.S.  infamous around the world, this film uplifts a friendly, passive Negro (I use the term politically) inmate [Cage's pal], who is not only too sick to do anything throughout the film but who seems all goo-goo-eyed at the heroism of [Cage], and who depends on the Almighty White Man to win the day and--as [Cage] tells him--&quot;prove there's a God.&quot; Of course, in the climax, this sick Negro stands in front of Cage and takes a bullet, and though he does not die, the moral of the story is clear: good black people should not only love white folks, they should be willing to die for them.  And the &quot;Black Militant&quot; character?  To be sure, he is a criminal and a killer, but he is the only sane, ideologically driven character on the plane--and that includes [Cage], whose only reason for getting involved in the airborne imbroglio is to save his Negro since--as the movie tells us--U.S. Rangers never leave a fallen comrade behind.  And laugh with me one last time: imagine the New York Times saying anything even remotely approaching black militancy as a &quot;wake up call to black America.&quot; Give me a break.  The people who produced and wrote &quot;Con Air&quot; obviously think that anything liberal is radical, and anything radical is bad--a common assumption of TOO MANY whites. In the end, the white hero and the good Negro live and all the rebellious prisoners die--with the exception of a psychotickiller and a homosexual in a skirt--which shows that the average white would rather have a serial killer running loose than a sane black &quot;militant.&quot; END   END
0399143904|2.0|After reading 3 times the other novels with Jack Ryan and John Clark, and  reading this one  as fast as I could, I just wish it could've been faster.  It seems that Clancy wanted to sell an Op-Center novel as much as the other  ones, and borrowed threats from &quot;Executive Orders&quot; and a villain  from &quot;006 7/8&quot; (doesn't even have a backup plan!). There's no  time to think, not for the heroes, who deserved better, not for the reader.  The new gadgets appear so obviously as &quot;I'll be used&quot; that you  may expect John Clark becoming Q in the next 007 movie. A pity that the  best character to appear in his books (the one who made &quot;Clear and  Present Danger&quot; memorable) is wasted in a us-and-them-(we're the best  of the best and we'll remind you every 60 pages)-bad-movie-plot. As  everyone who watched &quot;Jurassic Park 2&quot; knows, lack of a good plot  and characters can destroy a lot of good intentions. I hope that the next  book will bring us joy instead of this urge to scream : &quot;Why did you  disappoint us ?&quot;
0399143904|5.0|Tom Clancy, as usual, developed his plot with intense detail.  The first  2/3 of the book, exciting in spurts, was essentially boring.  The last 100  pages (of 740) was really exciting, giving those bad guys what they  deserved without being really nasty.  What annoyed me intensely was the  suck up to the FBI (&quot;we have to obey the law&quot; stuff) when history  records that the FBI has been the most flagrant violator of constitutional  rights of any organization except Bill Clinton's presidency.
