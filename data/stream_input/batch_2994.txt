B003WUYRGI|5.0|This is a great dictionary I guess. I mean all you have to do is look up a word and with the help of auto correct you can find the word your looking for.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Lots of fun!. Easy to play. The in app purchases kinda suck but I guess that's how they make money.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|Intense read, fascinating look back in time with murder, mystery, blackmail and love set in 1860s NZ. Loved it and found it hard to put down!
B0084ANCBC|1.0|This is the most ridiculously flowery, over descriptive, drivel I have ever attempted to wade through!  Do yourself a favor and let it be.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|I love Shakespeare, this is a brilliantly modernized play. And the geek factor of having so many actors forum past Joss Whedon movies in this was awesome. My husband and I really enjoyed this movie, great couples movie!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I loved this app.  It was great, one of the apps I ever had.  It told me what percent my battery was.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not enough services available at this time. Thought it would show all on computer to tv. Good price but did meet my needs at this time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|When I started reading this book it was dejavu from the Twilight Series.  Shy girl meets guy who is totally out of her league.  Strange did they say story takes place in Washington State?  When they touch its like electricity?  Please, I thought this was an adult book!!<br /><br />Oh well, after a while when we meet him again things get spicy (a little un-Twilight).  Still many coincidence that for me tie the two books together.<br /><br />By the ending I was crying and will have to probably finish the series just to make sure everyone is ok.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|I liked playing this game, it was a bit like others I had enjoyed in the past but I liked that it had a goal.  Only wish it was longer
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love all G5 games. They are wonderful for my pre teen girls to use their imaginations!! They try to solve every game by the first chapter.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm not a fan of sequels but Mr. King has done justice to this sequel to The Shining. I frequently wondered what happened to Danny and his mom. Now I know.
B003ZWDFWA|5.0|The transfer and extras are extraordinary. 1960'S PSYCHO is probably one of Hitchcock's best known film. Its images and sounds are indelibly etched into the psyche of our culture. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the Bates Motel, Bernard Herrmann's score, Saul Bass' main title designs, the shower scene and many other elements are cinematic icons. One element of this film that has not been given due recognition is Martin Balsam's performance as Milton Arbogast the private investigator. Balsam embodied the personification of professionalism and determination yet he was cut off in mid stream. I think there is a statement being made about the very nature of justice and fate and that life is not always fair. Being hooked a Hitchcock for so many years this was a great find.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Just a little disappointed I guess.  I expected more out of Ben Kingsleys character but a great movie none the less.
B000ZU2CHE|5.0|THE BIRDS metaphorically plays out the frailties of the human heart as befuddled humans' fears are visually juxtaposed against hoards of birds gone on a destructive rampage. Humans rebel against nature and each other as the birds represent nature in harmony turned against human progenitors who stand to disrupt harmony. Rod Taylor's solid performance, as the steadfast Mitch Brenner who gradually realizes (but cannot fathom why) that things are beyond even his control, is pivotal to the progression of the story. The importance of Taylor's performance has been long overlooked. This film is a masterpiece full of vivid histrionics running the gamut of human emotions.
1607066017|5.0|This is the most imaginatively entertaining piece of fiction I've read in the last 10 years. It's full of adventure, fantasy, magic, excitement, and romance that all melds together into one of the greatest comic book series of all time. Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples at their finest!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|REDS is a tour de force from writer and director Warren Beatty. This movie tells the true story of John Reed who was an American journalist around the time of World War I in Russia and his efforts to bring their ideological notions back to the United States at the time of the October Revolution in 1917. It entertains and informs and has commentary in segments of actual participants of these events. Fascinating stuff.
B004J09ONG|4.0|My 8 yo daughter loves the big cats.  I remembered this from my childhood and we watched it together.  It's a  great family movie then and now.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, recommended. The author does a good job telling the story. Now reading his other book. Worth buying !
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Since I can't go do dressage myself with a horse it's fun to do it for pretend. Plus my kids get a kick out of it.

B000I3P3EM|5.0|i have the first five Star Trek movies and i watched them in order. then i realized that i didnt have the next one so i rented it at Amazon. it was easy. i had no problems. i will rent again.
B00867HDTA|4.0|Don't make to much out of this,  great game helps pass the time and keeps you entertained. Have fun and enjoy.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|its a good movie, and i dont have it in my personal video library.and i wanted to see it. so it was very convenient to rent it on Amazon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow what a ending! Didn't want to put the book down once I started reading. I took it everywhere I went so I could keep reading.
B00E687MWQ|3.0|This is a very strange album from Satyricon. I've never heard a metal album that is so quiet and so loud at the same time. It's a bit boring and very slow and quiet in some spots, but still manages to have thundering bass drums and your typical downtuned black metal guitar licks. I'm perplexed. I recommend the Age Of Nero instead of this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My niece loves it!! She was very excited when I downloaded it for her :-) I hear it's all the rage with kids!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Logged out and wanted to log in but it said ERROR. Come try again later......<br />Came back 4 hours later....still not working. So annoyed by it. My friends are probably waiting. PLEASE FIX THIS APP NOW!!!  &gt;:(
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|The reason why fans were getting excited for this is that they were going to stop with the dubstep and go back to the roots. They actually did this. With Head coming back it sure did bring the band to a heavy side. This is their heaviest album since 2003's Take A Look In The Mirror (their heaviest album). This albums style is pretty simliar to Issues and Untouchables. It has those dark lyrics and dark vibes from Issues and the melodic vocals and chugging riffs from Untouchables. When I first heard Never Never, I was amped for the album but that single probably wasn't a good one for this album because it is kinda pop and Path Of Totality like. It should have been Love & Meth which is one of the standout fan favs from the album and is a pretty standard KoRn song. You can tell that KoRn will never ever change their original style and that's a good thing. But I know if Head stays with them, their music will get heavier. While it isn't the heaviest album they made, it is a heavy album for old and new fans alike. 9/10
B00F87A7HG|5.0|Kings never disappoint!!! Great album from Home boys that are as distinctive and original as anyone making music today!!! Rock On
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|First off, this whole album is heavy. The album is every thing we want in music. Great lyrics, heavy music, great vocals, lengthy songs. When I first heard the album, I was smiling because of how good it is. That is pretty much all that needs to be said about it. It's truly an amazing experience. 5/5
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Great automatic watch, +2 seconds a day! Face is a touch on the small side for my taste, but well worth the money.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|This game is mind tingling. In order to play this game you have to use your mind in order to make the right move within a sufficient amount of time. Love this game!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It is suspenseful and interesting.  Confusing at times and not as good as some other of his books.  Still a good read.
B003WKOU0G|2.0|Interesting approach but it could have been distilled down to 30 minutes, not sure why it was dragged out for so long.
B008R3EYZ4|5.0|This will make a perfect Christmas gift for my Father-in-law! Excellent condition, wonderful shipping, as good as expected. Thank You.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Amazing book with great details I had to go back and read it over again it was so great! I LOVED IT!!!!!!!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Wonderful Book - Very Worth Reading<br /><br />Gave me a new understanding of a seriously handicapped person's mind and wishes. And we should not pass judgment on their decisions.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Its very title stands as an act of defiance, as Miley incurs etymological wrath with the deliberate misspelling of \\"Bangers,\\" spitting in the face of propriety. Oh, how the Luddites bloviate at \\"thing\\" recast as \\"thang\\" and song titles scarred with hashtags! And just when you suppose you've finally seen it all, Miley arouses further ire by posing on the cover -- a mash-up aesthetic of Jan Hammer/Michael Mann, Robert Palmer, \\"Grand Theft Auto: Vice City\\" and Patrick Nagel -- with her back semi-turned to the camera, coyly denying detractors the pleasure of mocking the boils erupting ceaselessly from her reptilian neck. Her stance threatens potential twerk -- or maybe she's twerked already. It invites yet evades, revelatory in its secrets. It says, \\"You don't know me, you don't own me, you don't run my life, but for a toot of your molly, I'll surrender the meager bounty of my Disney-financed decolletage\\" (which she semi-obscures on an alternative sleeve, much to the delight of widow's-peaked liquor-store trenchcoat denizens throughout the dirty South).<br /><br />Some of these songs are explicit, which makes \\"Bangerz\\" super-relevant. The elderly Britney Spears lends her bus-station-restroom pipes to the title cut, acknowledging her own obsolescence by rapping, \\"I let them know the rent's due on the 1st / They can call a hearse\\" and leaping to her death in the fade. Future struts into \\"My Darlin'\\" to inform Ms. Miley that HER future's in Autotuned beehived weepers at her own amphitheater in Branson, Mo., with her one-hit father as perennial opening act (stick around for the chocolate-chip prime rib and \\"Achy Breaky 4x4\\" medley). Soccer moms continue to bump \\"Wrecking Ball\\" like they used to wolf down Tiffany's \\"Could've Been\\" in their mylar-ballooned boudoirs while pining for Jimmy in Algebra. Pretty standard robo-fare, but controversy truly explodes on the divisive \\"We Can't Stop,\\" driving older listeners to seismic levels of indifference to still another not-a-girl-not-yet-a-woman's convoluted concept of adulthood.<br /><br />Although her album is more mash than \\"Bangerz,\\" more gastropub than club, I must compliment the artist for her ongoing efforts to keep lonely deviants' skivvies warm during dry spells under dimly lit offramps.
B00FEJIVRQ|5.0|I usually have a problem with sequels, but not this one! I loved it as much as one and two!!
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I enjoyed watching this series again.  As a sci fi fan it's the possibilities of inhabitants and worlds beyond our own that keep any Star Trek series or movie a must see for me!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Followed all the directions several times. It failed each time.<br /><br />Be carefull before you buy. Its $35 dollars down the drain.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Not much to say about the cable.  It serves the purpose it was intended for to supplement the quick charge mechanism.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book had me from paragraph one!  Could NOT put it down.  Fast moving.  Did not want it to end.  Do not miss.  You will not be disappointed.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It is a very good book & had in mind to read all of Lee Child, books... If there as good as this #1. Although at $7.58 - $8.58<br />I really don't find it a good idea... On my kindle fire - I purchase the books & thats that &#62; I can not loan sell or give the book that I just paid for! Only option is to loan My kindle & that is'nt in my plans. So I am stuck with the book &#34; I just paid for, after readind it is just takeing up spsce in my kindle. I would think a company like Amazon &#62; would have a better option for there customers...?
B00DGNOMB6|4.0|Great movie but would not have billed it as a comedy.  Excellent cast and bittersweet storey on aging and one's passions.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Thought this was a hidden picture puzzle game, but loaded it up and sadly it was not.  No matter what you pressed, you didn't unlock anything.

B00338QENI|5.0|This is an incredible true story of an individual that changed our world of medicine.<br />It is a must read for everyone.  It is a book that I would never give away.  It has a place on the book shelf.
0316255580|5.0|Love the pictures and cute story line geared for kids.  Can't wait to share this with my grandson.  I think he'll love it as he loves balls which are prominently featured in this book
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I want to handle this review delicately and accurately, because I think there is a lot to say about this movie, good and bad. I don't know if I'm the only one who picked up on this or felt this way, but I thought the first 1/3 of this move was approaching brilliant. The stylized cuts and fast paced story and movement were kind of brilliant. If it could have maintained that kind of power and verve, this movie would have been as good as, or better than Baz Luhrmann's masterpiece, \\"Romeo + Juliet.\\" The first 1/3 could have been even better, but it was still pretty great.<br /><br />However, I believe, due to the story by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and the fact that Luhrmann sort of ran out of vigor, the last 2/3 seemed really pretty slow and like it was just trudging along. Luhrmann was handed a pretty bland 2/3 of a story by Fitzgerald, but he also didn't rise to the occasion, and make it powerful either. I don't think it's a plot spioler to say that the whole last 2/3 of this movie is waiting to see Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) just work up the nerve to tell a girl that he loves her. Kind of slow, no? The girl is played by Carey Mulligan, and she is beautiful, and has a great face for the role, but there isn't much there, character wise. Another thing is that I personally don't really think that the book \\"The Great Gatsby\\" was really a masterpiece. I've read it, and I actually thought it was pretty paint by numbers and the dialogue and characters were kind of cardboard cutouts. So the movie slows to a crawl waiting for Gatsby to tell the girl that he loves her, and then the ending is crammed with a bunch of completely improbable events. The story and movie are so crammed with fake situations and characters that you don't really feel much for them. It is such a shame because the beginning was so interesting, and if the whole movie could have maintained and capitalized on the mystery and intrigue that is built in the first 1/3 of the story, it could have actually been pretty spectacular. However, the book itself doesn't really tell the awesomest, most coherent story, and Luhrmann would have had to go pretty far off the page to tell a better story. I don't know what it was, but I didn't really care when we got to the climax of the story.<br /><br />DiCaprio (who I usually don't really like in roles like this) surprised me by doing a fair job. However, he really needs to drop that ever so slight New York (I guess) accent that he tries to do in so many of his movies. It doesn't sound subtle and believable, like I think he is shooting for, it just sounds like he made a half hearted effort to do a New York accent and gave up. He talks in his normal voice, and then every 16th word or so, he throws on a half New York accent. Yikes! It drives me crazy. However, in many scenes, he really showed some tension on his face, like his character was really trying to set things right, and that was nice. He didn't seem exactly like the brushed and polished mysterious figure that you'd want him to be, but overall he did a good job. He also didn't 100% nail the \\"old sport\\"s like you'd love it if he did, but he did good overall character work, and he was ok. I will, however, scream if he gets an Oscar for this role, and you know that somewhere out there, between Hollywood, London, and Australia, there was a better man who could have played the role of Gatsby.<br /><br />Overall, this movie dropped the ball on the mystery and intrigue, but a huge chunk of that was Fitzgerald's fault, and the first 1/3 I thought was actually pretty awesome. Overall, I give it a low B, C range for a grade.
0743270754|5.0|It was a gift for my husband and he raves about it.  Says it's the best book he's ever read.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It is a very good book it tells you a lot about true friendship. I loved this book it was a great read
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Fun but the controls are impossible and it won't let me move not to mention you barely get time to play
B003B02O0A|5.0|I have read it before and seen the movie.  There is something that grabs you and keeps you having to see whats next.
6305128952|5.0|Just a great movie, sad, but well but to-gether, if you like horses this is a must see, and lets face it Robert Redford ??
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|This new album by Alter Bridge is simply a masterpiece!! Its unlike anything they've done so far. Each song has its own unique rhythm and the entire album is pure ROCK from start to finish!!<br />Myles Kennedy once again completely nails the vocals while Mark Tremonti kills it on guitar. Marks solo on Addicted to Pain will shred your speakers!! Brain Marshall has an awesome bass solo on Cry of Achilles and Scott Phillips does a superb job hammering those drums!!<br /><br />Mark Tremonti is quoted as saying they \\"caught lightning in a bottle\\" with this record and he was absolutely right!! Its truly the most unique and straight up hard rocking album they've done so far!!
B004VMEILU|5.0|IF ANYONE WANTS TO LEARN MARTIAL ARTS............THIS THIS A MUST READ!<br />After BEEING A BROWN BELT And now 50 years old,with arthritis THIS BOOK INSPIRED ME TO WORK HARDER!<br />It worked!!!<br /><br />HAPPY COSTOMER!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Okay, here's the deal: I think King really did himself a disservice by claiming Doctor Sleep is a \\"return to balls-to-the-wall, keep-the-lights-on horror.\\" It's not that. Not even close. If you go into this book thinking it's going to be as scary as The Shining and that's all you look for in a book, you may very well be disappointed. Doctor Sleep has its scary moments, of course--or at least a few creepy ones--but it doesn't have the same build up of pressurized terror The Shining does.<br /><br />And that's fine.<br /><br />While Doctor Sleep isn't scary, it is intense, masterfully told, and a whole lot of fun. It's its own story, and I think it's one of King's best in many years. Probably his best since Bag of Bones. The plot is as intricate as it is satisfying, and it unfolds like a game of chess. Think Breaking Bad if you're a fan, only with the added bonus of supernatural powers.<br /><br />Because of what I can only call misguided marketing, this book ended up being nothing like what I expected, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the hell out of it. The nods to The Shining are there, and the unparalleled Stephen King style is there. That's plenty for me. If you like a good story, I think you're going to dig this one. Just go into it with an open mind, okay?
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This pushed update for the 7th is broken. Nothing is displayed on my wall on any mobile device (so it's not an issue limited to Kindle users). Blank wall, friends list is still in tact, but it is as if I had just created the page. Avoid this update for the time being.
B005FPT51K|5.0|We were given the AngelCare monitor when our oldest was born. It was the perfect monitor for newborn and infant, as the motion sensor pad and temperature readings allowed us to sleep well knowing baby was okay. We are expecting number 2 and have been looking for a good replacement monitor for our now almost two year old. The video resolution is great  and detail is perfect even though we have the monitor across the room from his bed. It was extremely easy to set up on our wireless and multiple devices. The sound is great - almost too sensitive if the volume on your device is up too high. All functions seem to be intuitive. Camera moves easily with a touch of the screen. Very satisfied and will likely purchase another one (or two) for our playroom and other areas of the house so I can peek in throughout the day.
B004XISI4A|5.0|I am still loving this series! Amazing that after all these books with so many twists and turns I am still hooked :)
B009CCBCU4|3.0|Pretty good read. Started out kind of slow. Lots of fighting, fear, blaming themselves and others. Finally learning to grow.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book has amazing and unforgettable twist and turns. It's so good , it dangerous. This book was the best nook I have ever read thank you Cassandra Clare for writing a wonderful story
B00F35B8F8|4.0|How do the writters justify the fact that the original crew of the Enterprise never knew of Kahn or thier history in the original series, yet now it is eveident that they at least met Kahn?
B008CYDD7I|5.0|Thanks Amazon my ex-wife and i enjoyed this particular movie really got my money worth send me more previews as they come in and many thanks again Amazon.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just an exciting read, with well developed characters so woven together.  Fast moving., sensitive, spanning &#34;lifetimes&#34;.  Each character was interesting and real.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this app. It has many levels with different challenges so it is not mundane. Challenging yet still a relaxing escape. Thank you.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Not too hard but a little challenging. I did the 10 square size and really liked it.  Younger kids probably wouldn't. have the patience. A++++++++++++++
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book I almost cried at the end because I was so happy. I'm dying to see the movie catching fore although I haven't read the book yet
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! My co-workers think I've lost my mind, due to the random laughing on my lunch break.<br /><br />Now, I'll have to watch 30 Rock!!!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I ordered 2+3 together, so I do not need to repeat the long story I just wrote, but Amazon was great to me and helped this technically challenged old person get what I wanted! Product arrived in perfect shape, quickly! Season 3 much better than 2!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I watched the movie first and then read the book. I was very surprised by how different the two were from one another. While I usually prefer the book over their movie, not so this time.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Season 2 not as good as 1+ 3, but Amazon great! I entered The Walking Dead in the search box and up it popped. I clicked on season 2+3 and gave my credit information and suddenly it said &#34;you can watch it now!&#34; I was so confused because I hadn't even chosen how I wanted them shipped to my home! Luckily, I was on Amazon! I'm old and not used to my new iPad or the ways of this advanced technology so I clicked on a customer support spot, clicked &#34;call me&#34; and my phone rang seconds after I clicked! The man took me through what I did step by step, gave me tips on ordering DVD's, and of course, fixed everything for me! He even waited each step, asked me what my screen showed, never once making me feel stupid, or at all like I was taking too long, he was awesome! The product arrived in perfect condition, quickly and I am very happy now using Amazon for more buying experiences!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I love this book because it not only shows the dedication of our servicemen but it shows what they can do after their service. Chris shows a great example of that. He is a leader not only in battle but to the vets that are having a hard time adjusting to life after coming home.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Very funny, creative!  It went from one fantastic situation to another, even more fantastic!  Delightful reading for one and all!!!
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|This, overall is a fun game. However, I encountered an error with one aspect of the game, which resulted in loss of a life, or game over:  on the level with the airplane, you are told to &quot;blow&quot; . The Kindle Fire contains no microphone. I have tested tilting, dragging and dropping and tapping and none worked, suggesting that you need a device that has a microphone. Unless I am in error, this means there is a flaw in one of the &quot;levels&quot; in the Kindle Fire version of this software. A suggestion to make this level passable would be: make the airplane controllable via dragging to keep the airplane steady for the Kindle Fire version.
B00498YZFK|5.0|Raw and intense.  The acting is amazing.  Many of the actors are in fact not actors but &#34;locals&#34; from the area where the filming was done.  Jennifer Lawrence does a good job as someone who finds herself &#34;too old, too soon,&#34; but with the core of someone much older.  The writer and director don't pull any punches in showing life in a meth infested area in the Ozarks.  Tough stuff but important.  It is a part of American life.  Watch it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Alright I love mincraft but hey my x box broke so I am stuck with this do you think game creates that you can make it like x box with the same  seeds and stuff with  towns people so you can get more stuff quicker that would be really nice because lots more people would love it  like people that want ibeextoycat on there's just so you know best seed ever well that just a recommendation  ps really cool app just it could be better

B00AF6MF9I|5.0|You n red to download this app best game by far.only thing is wish it did take so long to get your cash
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read the book just to see what all the hype was about.  I wish I hadn't have read it.  Christian is an abusive, manipulative guy and should not have been glorified at all.
B00EDOS6IC|5.0|My goodness. This is yet another incredible album from these boys. When I heard they were recording a much heavier album, I got really excited, but at the same time I worried they would rehash Tremontis solo album. Now don't get me wrong, his album is a huge favorite of mine, but I feared that it would sound too close to that and feel kind of watered down. Boy was I wrong. Heavy and experimental all at once, this thing is amazing. Best album of the past 5 years.
0064400557|5.0|I'm a 49 year old man who has been going back over the last year and re-reading books I read as a child.  Call it nostalgia, call it a second childhood, or just call it creepy, I've found I enjoy these books from my childhood just as much as an adult.  Charlotte's Web is a winner.  This timeless story of one naive little pig and a clever spider grabs you by the heartstrings right after you start reading it and doesn't let you go until you see how it all turns out.  Others have described the plot, so I'll just touch on that.  Basically, Wilbur the pig is being raised for slaughter.  Charlotte the spider decides on a plan to extend his lifespan indefinitely and writes words describing Wilbur in her web, like \\"Some Pig\\" and \\"Terrific.\\"  People see the web and take it as a miracle.  Charlotte keeps writing words in her web until Wilbur wins a prize at the county fair, and thus Wilbur is assured a long life and a merry one.  *spoiler alert*  Charlotte's death was almost as heart-wrenching for me now as it was when I was seven or eight and reading this book for the first time.  This story *really* sucks you in.  E.B. White was a great writer of children's literature, and suitable for adults as well.  Read it to your kids, or your godchildren, and enjoy every precious word of it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game! So fun and so simple. The game is easy to pick up and great for my grandparents and the children I babysit. I just wish there were more levels.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book started out well but just went on and on with too much unimportant detail.  I like a book to end, this one didn't until you read the epilogue
B00F91H666|3.0|Not very good, and the story was pretty far fetched.  Brad Pitt was off his usual good acting on this one.
B00338QENI|2.0|this is an interesting story. it would have made a better pamphlet than a book. it has a lot of unnecessary detail.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|I am a movie aficionado and this take on the fairytale is truly the result of a sharp mind and descriptive imagination. Just when you think you know the story, you get blindsided by a completely different and well thought out version of the original idea. The special effects are well done and quite believable.
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Great to catch up with Danny once again. He has grown into a fine young man, however we learn through Mr Kings brilliant writing that it was far from being a smooth journey.<br />I have had to wait over 30 years for The Shining Book 2, Doctor Sleep was worth the wait. I only hope Book 3 is already in the process of being written !<br /><br />Stephen King gets better with age. Hopefully he gets a little of \\" Rose the Hat\\"s, longevity. Hopefully I will to. Hate to die knowing there was more to read.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|This film shows Cruise at his best . He is no Swartzenegger or Cooney, but combine the two genres and you have Cruise. A thinking man's movie with a generous amount of hand to hand combat.
1476727651|1.0|....repeating the same thing over and over again, expecting a different result. AAhhh!!  why do I continue buying new Stephen King books expecting to read the \\"early\\" King.<br /><br /> Dr. Sleep isn't scary - its foul.<br /><br />Thanks for educating me on \\"how to use drugs\\" and \\"how to molest a child\\" Mr King.....
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Critical reviews of Oblivion were less than strong, and trailers for it emphasized guns-n-ammo type action. While Oblivion has plenty of action and excitement, it should be classed with the &#34;quiet&#34; type SF film, like 2001: A Space Odyssey and Solaris, not Star Trek or Star Wars. We found this a satisfying and entertaining film, and would recommend it, despite a disappointing lack of frontal nudity.
0545615402|5.0|I just got these in today and they are amazing.  I'm SO glad I didn't cancel the pre-order because I already had them separately.  The originals don't compare in my opinion, unless you got one of the collector editions of Beedle the Bard.  The first thing you notice when unwrapping them is how sturdy the set is.  The box is well made and covered in a textured paper that simulates canvas fabric with Gold printing on it.  As you pull the books out, they are made of the same solid quality and textured paper and are each a different color.  The spines have the gold printing too for the titles.  The text in the books seems to be intact from the original releases of these books and is impressive as always.  I had purchased these for our baby girl on the way but I think they will sit on my shelf next to the Harry Potter first editions because they are THAT nice.  I still might pick up a 2nd set for playtime because they really have that feel of actual schoolbooks.  If you have a Harry Potter fanatic in your life, grab a set, they will adore it!!
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This was an extraordinary film.  Whoever the horses were, they deserve academy awards. Seven more words required? Outstanding, visually unforgettable and good.
1607066017|5.0|Saga Vol. 1 by Brian K. Vaughan and Fiona Staples<br /><br />Suspension of disbelief: Noun. Something of a requirement in most creative media. Whenever we watch the latest summer blockbuster or read the latest issue of that comic, the logical part of our brains say: \\"You know as well as I do this is complete nonsense.\\" Yet we suppress and/or overlook this fact so we can fully enjoy the experience. But every now and then something comes along where the suspension of disbelief is not suppressed but completely obliterated. A story that almost from the first page, just reaches out, pulls you in, sinks its talons into you and doesn't let go. Saga is one of those stories.<br /><br />Warning! Minor Spoilers Ahead.<br /><br />As I have stated previously in my Amulet review, in medium that seems to be largely dominated by superheroes and the end of the modern world, anything that deviates from the norm is welcome relief. The initial premise of Saga is that of a space opera, an element that is sorely lacking in the world of comic books.<br /><br />The story takes place in a \\"galaxy far far away\\". Where there are two planets, Landfall and Wreath. These two worlds have been duking it out for as long as anyone can remember. The inhabitants of Landfall are winged humanoids with advanced technology, Wreath has humanoids with horns on their heads powered by magic. Already you can draw some analogies between angels and demons with this, but as the story goes on it is pretty much clear that there are not very many angels in this universe.<br /><br />We meet our heroes, Alana and Marko. Alana is a Landfallian soldier, Marko is from Wreath.  The hatred between the two peoples runs generations deep, yet they have fallen in love and have given birth to a hybrid child, whom they name Hazel. Branded as traitors by their respective governments, they are pursued by agents to kill them and take their child. Landfall sends Prince Robot IV of the Robot Kingdom, an ally of Landfall and Wreath sends a mercenary called The Will. The new family must cross a dangerous landscape to find passage off of the planet. They are accompanied by a ghost named Izabel who aids them in exchange for passage.<br /><br />As with many comics...the artwork, while exemplary, does seem `sketchier' compared to later volumes, but this is expected in comics as during the first issues, the artist is still trying nail down their style. As for the artwork itself, the most sufficient word for it is `stylish.' The art is freakin gorgeous.  Fantasy and Science fiction blend in this universe that creates a wonderfully unique setting. Ships made from wood, the ghost girl missing half her body, Giant Turtle Landships and Dragon trains, this is a beautiful story. Even the smaller things stand out. You can genuinely tell when a character is upset or happy just from the details on their faces.<br /><br />While there are drawings of nudity and sex in the story, such as Alana breastfeeding and The Will visiting a brothel planet, it is actually done in a tasteful manner and not sheer pornography. Though it is safe to say that this combined with the violence, makes this at least a PG-13 story.<br /><br />Story and Setting are great for any book but what keeps a narrative flowing is its characters and this is where Saga shines.<br /><br />Despite the fantastical and quirky setting, Saga is a very character-driven story and the characters are real...<br /><br />Marko and Alana are not heroes fighting against an evil empire. They are just people trying to raise their child in peace and let the powers that be duke it out and leave them alone. The two fight and argue and love on each other just like a real couple.<br /><br />Even though he's a guy with a television for a head, Prince Robot ( a personal favorite) feels very authentic, especially in his motivation. He was shanghaied into this task by his father despite the fact that his wife is pregnant with their first child.<br /><br />Even Hazel, surprisingly enough. The narrator of the story is Hazel telling the story from the future, and a little bit of her future personality bleeds through. The present Hazel is very well down, as she is just a baby. Throughout the first volume, she does what most infants do...sleep and occasionally she cries. There is a tendency in creative media to over characterize infants or really young children, most likely due to the fact that babies are not really that interesting as characters. This adds another touch that enforces the realism of Saga<br /><br />Another glimmering quality of the characterization is The Lying Cat. The companion of The Will, the Lying Cat is a cat-like creature about the size of a large dog. What makes her unique is that she is capable of telling when someone is lying. When someone tells a lie in her presence, she speaks the phrase, \\"Lying\\". That in of itself is pretty cool. What also makes her interesting is that while for the most part she seems like an otherwise ordinary cat there is evidence, especially in later editions and in the cat's body language, that she is much more intelligent than a cat. It remains to be seen as to whether the Lying Cat is capable of speaking more words other than \\"Lying.\\"<br /><br />The Stalk, one of the bounty hunters sent by Wreath as well, initially appears to be the villain, her actions toward the protagonists as well as her character design seem indicative of this, but as we follow her later through the story we see there is a more complex story behind her as well.<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br /><br />Saga is probably the only comic series I actively follow nowadays. It is classic, just classic. The artwork, the story and the absurdly creative setting are a testament to the power of the Graphic Novel and any fans of them need to hop on this wagon sooner than later.<br /><br />Five out of Five Stars
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|works well with kindle<br />I use it every day. It has a great display and easy to read features. The snooze. button is large
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Pretty much the same plot line as any other &#34;action movie&#34;, with the story line predicable and the special effects/action is better than most. I’d give it 3.5 stars.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|I enjoyed most of this game and had really looked forward to it because I loved quell, but sometimes the object was not clear and I did not ever figure out what I needed to do to finish the level. Beautiful graphics.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved the historical parts interwoven with the present.  Could not put it down.  I'll remember this book long into the future.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Bound to be another classic album. The pace f the techno beats dd slow dd a little bit n the 10 years since there last album to a nice melody.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|One of our favorites. Lots of action, intelligent storyline, and great acting. Could eatch it over and over again. Watch it!
B002ZG981E|4.0|I loved Inception - it contained one of the better original plots to come out of Hollywood in the past couple years. And that's saying a lot seeing how the theaters are now flooded with prequel/sequel/remakes, not to mention those 3D \\"re-releases\\". The fact that the writers did their research and incorporated decent amount of actual science into the movie (for instance, how we incorporate external stimuli into our dreams) was just icing on the cake.<br /><br />This blu-ray version of the movie contains three discs - the 1080P blu-ray main feature with DTS-HD and Dolby Digital 5.1, a special features disc, and finally the DVD version of the movie. The blu-ray transfer is very well done. Viewed on a 50\\" Panasonic plasma, the picture showed great saturation and very little motion/compression artifacts during the fast action scenes. The DVD version was a decent transfer. Nothing fancy like animated menus, etc. Can't complain though - I'd rather have the space devoted to the actual movie than extra frills.<br /><br />There's also an offer to a free digital copy of either itunes or Windows media format. You had to visit a site and enter in the coupon code inside the package. There was an expiration date of a few months after purchase in the fine print, and unfortunately I didn't see it until it was too late. So this is why I took off one star - WB should just offer the copy to the customer without strings.
B005974CNA|5.0|To me this album is in the top three best of dream theater. Theres a reason one of the songs got nominated for a Grammy. Not much else to say, I just wish their latest self titled album was as good as this.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I received my purchase in very good timing... This was a Bday gift.... Also, the price was very reasonable. I have been pricing this for awhile. Nothing was damaged. I gave this a 5 star cause of price and the fast turn around on receiving the DVD's...
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|I've enjoyed Sanderson's books in the past, the Mistborn books in particular written very well. However, I will have to say that Steelheart left me disappointed. I understand that the book book is YA, but even for this sub genre I was left with a plot that I could only wish had been in an edgier work. Sanderson has a promising theme: what happens when there are no heroes to stop the super villains? But using first character voice with an over abundance of rhetorical questions, awkward made up slang, and every other line with the main character mooning over the girl he can not get, makes for clunky reading at times. Add in all the &#34;action&#34; chase scenes, eccentric side characters, &#34;cool&#34; ultra modern technology, and costumed super villains and you have a book that feels much more like it was written word for word to set up story boards for a &#34;major motion picture&#34;. I almost with the film had come out and this was the novelization because that's what it feels like. Keeping it simple like this also prevented any world building, so we are confined to what we can get from our narrator.  The whole world has changed and all we have is one small glance at one city, and not much of a glance at that in any case.  I would have loved to learn how the economy runs, how trade works, how food supply chains work, how they even prevent everyone from getting rickets when there is no sunlight. Again, feeling like a movie set up, the only characters who matter are the six heroes. The villains show up to loom villainly, with little or no dialogue.  Sanderson even has the token &#34;ultra cool&#34; Asian villain dressed all in black and shadow, keenly showing his clever deduction skills.  In the film, I'm sure he'll look appropriately Matrixy.  The sequel is already set for next fall.  I'll probably borrow first, rather than buy.  I am still intrigued by what will happen to this world he has created. I just don't know if I'll be able to read the book or just skim it  to see how his ideas played out.<br /><br />I've seen from reviews of Sanderson's other YA book that he seems to falter when writing for this audience. I confess I can't find the same voice of the strong writer that brought me into the Mistborn books, Legion, and the culmination of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time opus. Except for a variation of one of the themes in Mistborn: consequences of revolution against a dictatorship, his voice is sorely missed here.  I have no problems with authors thinking about getting their stories to audiences through different media and making as much money as they can- they should be rewarded for a job well done. I can only hope that in the future Sanderson will think of the quality of the work rather than just how to get something past a film producer's desk.  Don't pitch us a story, Brandon. Tell us one.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book.  Confusing at first but it got soo much better!  Loved it very much-will recommend this book to others!
B009WHD3OW|5.0|GREAT MOVIE ENJOYED THE FIRST ONE AND THE SECOND ONE CANT WAIT FOR EXPENDABLE 3 COMES OUT NEXT YEAR THAT ONE I WILL PURCHASE ALSO STALLONES MOVIES ARE GREAT.EVEN WITH ARNALD HAMMMEN HAGGER IN IT.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|while a standard good-vs-evil genre, this was well-developed and fresh.  Will be downloading the sequels shortly.  Pity about the movie.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I love this app. It brings Wikipedia to my Kindle Fire, allowing me to have Wiki's wonderful resources when I need them, where I need them.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Very Creative!<br />I love a great twist to something as basic as 6-sided dice.<br /><br />Me and my groups can sit for hours and play this shaker upper.<br />I've even made my own BRAIN tokens to keep track of Marathon sessions.<br /><br />Brainssssss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app works really well for my kindle.  It will clean up your junk files and help make your device run faster and smoother.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I bought this game because I was looking for something different for my family and friends to play.<br /><br />WOW, was I impressed!<br />My 10 year old daughter was watching me set it up and explain it, and did not want to even play. (no touchscreen!)<br />However it wasn't 2 rounds into the first game with me and my wife before she was hooked.<br />About 2 hours later I got my 10th victory point and she was so depressed.  Not because she lost but because she had plans for 2 more settlements and a city.<br /><br />We played again the very next night and at about the 2 hour mark again my daughter &#34;accidentally&#34; scored her 10th victory point.  Again she was upset, literally to the point of tears stating, &#34;I don't care if I win... I just want to keep playing!!!&#34;<br /><br />Nuff Said!
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|A scary and fascinating read. Schossler does a good job making a non-fiction, somewhat technical book come alive.  Highly recommend.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I have this and the laptop version and use them along with a Logitech trackball. I tell everyone who will listen that I spend 1/2 the time maneuvering around in 3D using this device than I used to with a mouse and keyboard. I use AutoCAD, Inventor, MAX, and Solid Works for electromechanical design contracting and wouldn't be without these, they definitely, positively impact my companies bottom line. After over 30 years in front of a computer I don't suffer from any carpel-tunnel or arm-muscle pain. I credit this to changing my keyboard, controller, and mouse regularly, their type and location on my desk. This is my third 3D controller, part of my repetitive motion avoidance plan, and the best one yet. You will get the cost of this thing back, in time saved, the first week.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|A nice package of memories and a wonderful edition of my favorite movie. I could not ask for a better way to spend a rainy Sunday than with this sunny and sweet movie.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|This CPU was used to build a gaming machine.  It was a easy to install.  I came with a beefy fan, but I ended up using a water cooling system.<br /><br />The CPU itself actually ran pretty cool.  We ran a few intensive demo's and the cpu never got smoking hot like the older intel cpu's.<br /><br />Overall a great buy for gaming.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|An emotional roller coaster! I loved the story and the characters were so real.  Sparks makes you feel so deeply for the characters that you need to keep a box of tissue next to you while you are reading.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I like the movie because Channing Tatum is sexy as hell and I love Matthew McConaughey. But, not impressed by the story and the actress bugs the crap out of me! It is like a R rated version of \\"Step Up\\"... Boy is where he doesn't belong, Channing Tatum is a dancer and falls for a girl who is not his type, and has to make a life altering decision.... where can I get the copy of just the strip club scenes combined lol?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This app right here has helped me plan my day so many times. I love how accurate it gets and the detailed forecast up to the hour is incredibly helpful...not to mention the server weather alerts that pop up and help me plan out potential power outages.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Love Kate Morton - a great story teller!  It's hard to say which novel I love the most, but Kate Morton does not disappoint!
B004J64QSI|5.0|This was a requested present for my niece. She absolutely loved it! It was exactly what she wanted. The perfect gift.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Another rich book by a great writer!  If you loved the Kite Runner, you will love this book too!  Rich, rich history and well written!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Very good read. Would highly recommend, could not put it down, characters were real and story very well written. Loved the last paragraph.
B003U6HQGW|5.0|This is the third time I've read this book. Whether you choose to believe it all or not, it is a true story, and I actually knew the author. Definitely worth picking up and reading. Heartfelt, makes you cry, laugh, gives us all hope that if you want something badly enough, you can achieve it!
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Loved it. So glad regular series are coming up with new story lines. Can't wait til this Sunday for the new season to start.
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Love this album, Almost every song I can listen to over and over again. Sure, I wish she wouldn't rap but overall a good product.
B001XUPD94|5.0|It was great to see this movie again. I really enjoyed the final movie with the original cast, and now that some of them are gone, this is the last time to see all of them together on screen.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a favorite author of mine.  I enjoy his writings; suspense, drama, love his work.<br />I read this book on a Kindle which gave me the ability to read wherever and whenever and not<br />worry about holding a large book.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie is well written and all of the acting is top notch, from Robert DeNiro to Chris Tucker. The leads both held their own and then some.
B00FFS7AHS|5.0|I first heard Valentina Lisitsa play the Liszt Rhapsody No. 12 on her original web site back in 2009. At that time I barely knew her from adam, only a few vids on youTube. But the performance of the No. 12 convinced me that here I was listening to something amazing in the making. Since then Lisitsa has swept across the continents like a hurricane. Except that Hurricane Val only brings good things to distant shores. This album then is a kind of completion to what I began to follow back then. In the years since I have come to admire her greatly. As for her playing, she is truly non plus ultra -- the Queen of the Piano.
B003B96AOW|4.0|I just received this figure today, and although it's a great figure, the articulation is kind of a buzz-kill.  The arms can move up and down and side to side, but the elbows can only go up and down, but I'd still recommend it, but just for older teens and adults though
B00863CMZE|5.0|This is a treat! The recording is good quality, I love the songs, and the concert banter was fun and informative. i love that they write most of their own music.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My laptop plays through hdmi on every computer I own.  This rented movie would not output hdmi to the 47&#34; flat panel.  All I got was a black screen so wasted the rental.  I own the movie but wanted to rent it so a friend could watch it.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My son and I have had the best time playing this game over and over. The intricate details of how the whole puzzle pieces work together never get old. I am addicted to this game and<br />I'm ready for a new room.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works perfectly.  It is the same as all other iPhone 5 cables and I have not had any problems with it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved the characters in this book.  Their struggles, highs and lows felt real.  Looking forward to reading other books by Jojo Moyes as this was the best book I've read in a LONG time!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|it was fun. some challenging,  some too easy. would like skilled levels to last longrr and more levels in general really
B0036S4B6M|3.0|I fell in love with the show so, when I found out there was a book I just had to read it.  It was ok.  It was pretty much Piper's experience in jail.  It didn't speak to me on any level and I didn't feel like she did hard time.  It was more or less a discomfort.  She does acknowledge this though.  She continually states how lucky she is. I, as well as most people, believe our justice and correctional facilities need an upgrade of sorts and that's what I felt the point of this book was: to get people talking.<br /><br />The characters in the show are so rich and interesting and you find yourself feeling sorry for them but yet shaking your head feeling that some part of them got what they deserved.  There is none of this in the book.  There's is no connection between the reader and the other inmates.  It's just you and piper's perception.  It did tie up some lose ends regarding Piper and Nora, which I had been super curious about.  I don't feel like I wasted my time reading this but I don't feel like it will be a repeat offender.
B000X2H8G4|3.0|I got this unit for my mother, who needs to hear some better ( but refuses hearing aids), so I suggested these as a compromise, something to help.<br /><br />First off, I should say, these do amplify surrounding sounds quite well, and the included headphones seemed ok.<br /><br />Our problem was that the battery powered unit itself was just awkward to manage.  It's not tiny.  But there was no easy way for her to easily attach to herself and carry it.  A better belt clip would possibly have helped.  It was not sized to easily carry in a shirt or pant pocket.. And ladies clothes don't always have pockets anyway.  It did seem more geared to mounting on something like a tripod or gun.  I think it would be great for bird watching for instance.<br /><br />She tried it for several days, but Because it was awkward to manage every time she got up and down, she set it aside.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|If you like Star Trek you will like it...But even if your not a trekkie, it's a good movie. My husband even liked it
B000G6R7B8|5.0|I recieved this watch about a week ago and it has kept perfect time since. It is light weight comfortable to wear and with the  black numbers and hands against the beige dail it is very easy to read at a glance.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Hidden objects are difficult to find but not impossible. It can be frustrating when you run out of energy quickly, it would be nice if energy would last longer.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|This is the BEST WORSHIP album for 2013!!! I have always desire and always have wanna to see Darlene Zschech do a live worship album. I hope she will do more Live albums with just Her on it and it would be cool to see her do another song with Kari Jobe as well. All 14 songs has touch my heart. I wish Shout To The Lord<br />and Agnus Dei made it on the cd to. The dvd is always Best cause you get bonus songs and the songs on the cd are more Extended on the dvd which is AWESOME. It overwhelm me when i first heard of this album. Since 2008 Darlene Zschech has done only 2 worship live songs on the Hillsong albums but now now for 2013 Darlene Zschech has done 14 worship live songs. 12 of them are on cd the other 2 songs are only on the dvd along with the 12 you get on cd. The artwork is beautiful. I'm glad Kari Jobe is on here as well. I'm also glad Michael W.Smith was on here to. Darlene Zschech is truly knows how to be humble and Worship Jesus with all of her Heart!!! Darlene Zschech is truly my Fav in all the Christian Music Artists that's out there. I cant wait to see what Darlene Zschech brings next. DARLENE ZSCHECH THANK YOU FOR DOING A LIVE WORSHIP ALBUM!!! I love the title of the cd. I Love to see JESUS name be Exalted!!! I Love how you hear JESUS name in just about all the songs. Jesus is the Best Man I have ever known. I'm thankful Jesus is someone who has touch my Heart through Darlene Zschech music and songs and albums.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Loved all the characters in this movie.  Betty White did an exceptional job and funny as always.  Sandra Bullock again did a movie I loved watching.  I don't know that much about Ryan Reynolds but he did a good job.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I was using a kindle fire, maybe that was the problem. It would allow you to do anything you needed to do without purchasing the next level; and you could not make the choice based on what was available to try.
B005K8QIS0|4.0|I really enjoyed this mystery series based on the Kate Atkinson novel. The intertwining story lines are intriguing and keep you guessing. I didn't want this to end.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|At first I loved this game, I was doing pretty good, and I finally got enough coins to get a new house and the Dalmatian. When I buy them, I use all my gems to make the house come quicker. Then when I placed the Dalmatian, it said to come back  in 55 hours to get the dog. About three days later, I play the game to get my Dalmatian, and the house that had the Dalmatian in it randomly glitches, and the house is on top of another house and it won't let me claim the dog! So now I'm stuck with a house floating over another one, wasted all my gems and coins, and I can't do anything about it! If that didn't happen I would've given this game a 5 star rating.
B00051E906|4.0|Nice model, but need to read directions prior to using it.  Seems to work well otherwise, good ratings and well built
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|It is very addictive. You can pick what side you want to be on. Good or Evil...  The characters are adorable and love how you can buy other characters to join the battle field.  Challenge your brain skills.  Fun Fun .
B00821OX98|2.0|just started watching it, frist season, too many personal talks, cheap tricks, in some cases pure nonsence. I like sci-fi movies but this series has just too many unrealistic ideas to keep the story rolling.
B0094K1K8I|1.0|A hideous waste of time,  and I didn't even watch it in its entirety. Bad acting (they're trying too hard),  and a 'been there,  done that' plot make this movie a complete disaster. I enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity and that is where they should have stopped.

B003XRZZFM|4.0|Dimmu Borgir's ninth full-length from the studio, 2010's \\"Abrahadabra,\\" is the exact album that the Norwegian symphonic black metal icons should release following \\"In Sorte Diaboli,\\" as it is the perfect continuation of that 2007 effort. What this means is \\"Abrahadabra\\" finds Dimmu filtering in some dangerously clean vocal lines into the mix of what would otherwise be all-out chaotic black metal, riddled with brutal drumming, biting, Slayer-esque riffs, and croaking black metal vocals. And plenty of solid groove is included, here, too. The end result is a record that is easy to see fellow Norway black metal gods Immortal smiling and nodding at in approval.<br /><br />The point is that despite all of these extreme levels of intensity, Dimmu do bring back their trademarked melodic stamp for some of songs' arrangements -- but only just a big enough stamp to be memorable. They still have a full orchestra at their disposal, too, which they utilize flawlessly in the chilling album opener, \\"Xibir.\\" All bets are off, though, for \\"Born Treacherous,\\" which is filled with blistering surges of double bass and blast beats, and they are only occasionally interrupted by intermittent blasts of choir. And likewise, \\"Gateways\\" has female vocals trampled under-foot by a crushing and truly mind-boggling double bass and blast beat onslaught. Then, following the rhythmic, marching cadence of \\"Chess With The Abyss,\\" and the female-fronted fifth track (\\"Dimmu Borgir\\") comes one of \\"Abrahadabra\\"'s biggest standouts in \\"Ritualist,\\" an epic number with an impressive scope and dynamic contrast. It begins with a lovely, if morbidly dark-sounding acoustic guitar intro that blends perfectly into propulsive, machine gun drumming and heavy guitars. This song also boasts a guest spot from the Therion bassist, some odd keyboard soloing, and really memorable, chanted choruses, as well.<br /><br />An obligatorily slow intro aside, \\"A Jewel Traced Through Coal\\" plays like a piece of full-on Eighties thrash, albeit a symphonic-tinged piece, as it finds a choir/orchestra doing battle against crushing drum blasts, racing thrash beats, and blistering riffage (including some flesh-filleting tremolo picking). \\"Renewal\\" is also very thrashy, and it even goes so far as to adopt some decent guitar soloing (!) to go along with its fiery picking. But it is, once again, the drummer, Daray, that has the center stage, here, as he floors the tempo and annihilates his trapkit with jackhammer-fast precision. Next we get \\"Endings And Continuations,\\" which finds a very doomy vibe lurking in part of the song, which is partially slow, restrained, and brooding, and partially thrashy and propelled forward by an excellent, blasting drum fill. Some even more variety comes into play with the next track, the album-closing \\"Gateways,\\" a song that features some more female vocals and exceptionally-well done clean singing from Dimmu Borgir frontman Shagrath.<br /><br />\\"Abrahadabra\\" is not a perfect album because it does have a couple of boring parts (see the mostly unremarkable \\"The Demiurge Molecule,\\" for example). And plus, there is some musical cheese involved, here, too; but hey, you can pretty much expect that with any given Dimmu recording, now can't you? All told, 2003's \\"Death Cult Armageddon\\" might remain D.B.'s finest hour, but at the end of the day, this is yet another worthy inclusion in the band's catalog.ash, albeit a symphonic-tinged piece, as it finds a choir/orchestra doing battle against crushing drum blasts, racing thrash beats, and blistering riffage (including some flesh-filleting tremolo picking). \\"Renewal\\" is also very thrashy, and it even goes so far as to adopt some decent guitar soloing (!) to go along with its fiery picking.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|I read so many very serious works that sometimes I need a fun, interesting and easy read.  I always enjoy John Grisham's work and I've read all but two.  I recommend this book to those who find the law fascinating.  I always learn something new about the legal process when I read John Grisham.
B00BMTX2QM|5.0|2013 has been a great year for doom metal, what with new releases from the likes of Cult Of Luna, Amorphis, Intronaut, Black Sabbath, and Kylesa hitting store shelves. (And further releases from Eyehategod and Mastodon are also expected.) And, of course, no conversation about said topic could ever be complete without mentioning Cathedral, and their tenth album, \\"The Last Spire.\\" It is such a pity, then, that frontman Lee Dorrian announced (prior to his recording of this new long-player) that it would be his last. Well, even if that does indeed prove to be the case, then there is at least no doubt about the fact that Dorrian and Co. went out on a really high note.<br /><br />\\"Entrance To Hell\\" is a friggin' monster of an epic with a beautiful acoustic breakdown to offset its huge, grinding doom metal riff, thus making it feel all that more huge and brutal, and providing the song's arrangements with some much needed color, nuance, and contrast. Said tune also transitions through a surprisingly up-tempo section, before once again settling down into a sludgy, doomy dirge. And similarly, \\"An Observation\\" contrasts fairly devastating brutality (including some massive, pounding power chords) with startlingly quiet and ambient sections, and dirge-like breakdowns with musicianship that would not be inappropriate at a funeral. \\"An Observation\\" also segues through a part predominately occupied by keyboards before storming back in full force with brisk, and almost chainsaw-fast guitars. The end result is an epically epic piece, and one that might lead some listeners to believe it is actually two separate tracks.<br /><br />Elsewhere, \\"Cathedral Of The Damned\\"  augments a droning, churning riff slice with some abnormally good and ripping guitar soloing, and throaty, angry, Neurosis-esque vocals (from Death/Autopsy mouthpiece Chris Reifert); and \\"Tower Of Silence\\" lays delicately echoing-out vocals over a bed of densely crunchy, churning grooves. Next up, with its big, lumbering riffage, and Ozzy Osbourne-sounding vocals, \\"Infestation Of Grey Death\\" ultimately comes across sounding like an early Black Sabbath outtake. And even better still, despite utilizing some wah-wah guitar licks (and to very catchy effect), and a gorgeous breakdown (complete with jazzy melodic leads), the set-closing \\"This Body, Thy Tomb\\" is primarily centered around a momentously towering sludge riff and pounding skins.<br /><br />Although it does not quite dethrone Cathedral's second album, 1993's \\"The Ethereal Mirror,\\" \\"The Last Spire\\" does have all of the makings to be a great (or at least very good) doom metal record (i.e. memorable guitar chops, powerhouse grooves, sludgy bass lines, etc.), and even though this reviewer prefers the new Black Sabbath and Cult Of Luna efforts over \\"Spire,\\" it easily ranks as one of the genre's finest releases of the year.riffage, and Ozzy Osbourne-sounding vocals, \\"Infestation Of Grey Death\\" ultimately comes across sounding like an early Black Sabbath outtake.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|works fine with my phone and I love it. I get to read my books on the go and I am very happy about that.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely.. I watched it more than a few times, until I memorized the songs. I am one of those.. I'm never truly happy unless I'm singing, so this movie hit the right chords. And ANYONE would enjoy this. Amy (fat Amy, she calls herself, (from &#34;bridesmaids&#34;) seems to get the best one liners but the whole movie is just fun and you begin getting anxious for the ending, because you know it's going to be kick-arss! And it was. A movie everyone should have in their library. Also, I believe it will be and is Anna Kendrick's come out movie. Will be keeping an eye out for her and the blonde- Skylar Astin (from True Blood).  Her &#34;Too controlling&#34; attitude comes to a head, hilariously so when the red head- Rebel Wilson, goes for the pitch pipe. One of the best scenes and there are many. Don't miss this.<br />Opal
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|I just really love this movie. She is a great actress and the movie plot is great. It is a great lesson too.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|What you are going to see here is \\"Man of Steel,\\" not \\"Superman.\\" Actually it IS Superman, but not the one you knew in the past. \\"Man of Steel\\" takes itself very seriously, with the re-imagined DC Comics hero that is much darker than you would expect. This is not surprising after all because the 2013 film is directed by Zack Snyder of \\"Watchmen,\\" co-produced by Christopher Nolan and written by David S. Goyer, which is based on a story by Nolan and Goyer.<br /><br />From the very opening that describes the last day of Planet Krypton with spectacular visuals, you know \\"Man of Steel\\" is going to be different. After the promising start, however, the film's narrative gets more and more complex with frequent flashbacks to Superman/Kal-El's younger days. This might have worked with Christopher Nolan who effectively employs non-linear narrative to make his characters' back stories more intriguing, but Snyder only confuses us, making the film's pace slower than necessary.<br /><br />When the Kryptonian warriors led by General Zod (Michael Shannon) arrive, the action finally picks up, but despite the big and loud sequences (with flying cars and so many destroyed buildings), the effect-ridden climactic action becomes soon repetitious. No matter how fast and high he flies like a supersonic plane, Superman here (played by Henry Cavill) looks like just another action superhero, humorless and frustrated, and nothing more.<br /><br />Plus, there is a subplot about a Daily Planet journalist Lois Lane (Amy Adams), who meets Superman in the most contrived way. This is a visually dazzling re-imagination of the Superman saga that could have been much better with a more skilled storyteller.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love the music. The songs are great. I couldn't stop singing along once I knew the songs. I wanted to see this movie for a very long time and I'm so glad I finally was able to have the time to watch it.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Jeffrey Archer created a good story in the three novels that comprised the series.<br />There were enough twitches in the plot to keep a steady interest and leave you guessing about the outcomes.

B00190N4E4|5.0|I loved seeing the different phases Gandhi went through in his life, the people he met who influenced his decisions, and the internal struggles he faced along the way. Kingsley portrayed him as a motivated, but normal man who slowly matured into one of the most positive forces in the 20th century, but in ways most people wouldn't have known. I never knew how conflicted he was about many things he did, and his origins in South Africa seemed way more influential than I previously realized.<br /><br />Honestly, I also enjoyed the performance of all the actors, and they made me appreciate the actions of everyone who surrounded Gandhi. It seemed they all inspired him to embody their best strengths in his juggernaut-like stride toward independence.<br /><br />I recognize that the movie may not be biographically complete, but I learned enough about his life to respect it in its entirety.
B003GMJ9WO|5.0|It is hard to find the video that can be watched online. I am happy that Amazon.com has it for rent. My son watched his first Superman movie and were thrilled even though he did not have the dream that night that he was flying in the sky.
0684857219|4.0|I am an amateur bodybuilder who does small, local shows. This book offers great information on every major aspect in bodybuilding from training to nutrition. Although some ideas aren't backed by science, they certainly worked for Arnold, and I believe many frowned upon 'bro science' may actually give competitors a (mental) edge. This book does lack a bit of depth for competitive bodybuilders though- I was expecting more 'small tweaks in many popular exercises' to maximize stimulation and hypertrophy. It did a good job in this department in only the deltoids section.<br /><br />Overall a very complete bodybuilding book with solid information. If you are serious with bodybuilding though, I suggest using this with other sources too for more detail.

B00F91SCXC|3.0|I've never been much for zombie themed movies but this one was better than most. Of course Brad Pitt's acting skills, the special effects, story line and continuous action held my attention from beginning to end. The rental fee was steep at $4.99 for HD but I am certain it was better for me to rent rather than buy because I seldom watch a movie more than once. This was my first rental from Amazon and I like the instant streaming which I can't get from Netflix.

B00AA2I2NK|5.0|This music is beautiful, stunning, and no words could do it justice.<br /><br />As a fan of Ludivico's piano solos I was really looking forward to hearing him perform live when he came to my town. I deliberately avoided listening to any of his previews because I wanted to hear this live first hand. When I found out along the way that this album was not solo piano, I felt a little bit of disappointment. Why would he bring other instruments into his beautiful music? Because we're lucky, that's why! The concert was hands down the best musical performance I have ever witnessed. So much talent, so much depth, so much detail!<br /><br />This album is woven together so intricately and beautifully. There is so much in each track that every time I listen to it, my mind wanders to new places. I see new scenes, discover new art, and travel to new places, all while sitting in my car in rush hour traffic with this masterpiece playing.<br /><br />I got the CD at the concert and have since bought it for family and friends who have also fallen in love with this music. Ludivico is a brilliant composer and I still listen to him daily.<br /><br />This album in particular stirs my imagination like nothing else.

Paul McCartney at his peak on tour with Wings in the mid-70s. This is a powerhouse two-disc set with many Beatles songs heard live on this recording for the first time since that band broke up.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|I have been a fan of zombies and cheesy zombie flicks since I could remember. I've seen some good ones, not so good ones, and some very not so good ones. WWZ was on the better mediocre side. I'm not a fan of the digital zombies, but it's still a good story line and they make for good action and suspense. It's good enough to watch once or twice.

B0050N8N0Q|5.0|I bought the album (finally) after having heard the singles, which I loved. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find I liked the rest of the songs just as much, some even better. I can't stop listening to this album, and the super catchy songs are always in my head, which suits me just fine.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I got this app for the weather reports then let myself get roped into mpoints.  Using the Kindle app, you don't get all the features that are out there so you only get half the opportunities to get mpoints. I used to get extra points for watching videos after my &quot;achievements &quot; points were added in. Now - nothing happens when the start arrow for the video is activated.  It takes a long time to get enough points even for a $1 gift card. There are supposed to be more apps out there you can use to add more mpoints but they don't work for Kindle.  My recommendation?  Use as a weather app. Don't waste your valuable time on mpoints. Unless you're really lucky at winning drawings,  you'll just end up frustrated.

B00ESY7QXI|4.0|The director of this film did an excellent job portraying the constructed opulence written into Fitzgerald's classic work.<br /><br />Some parts of the story have been altered slightly to create a more cohesive film, including the elimination of the narrator's romance. These changes actually add to the mystique of the characters.<br /><br />The Great Gatsby is a must-see for any fan of the book, or anyone who likes a story with lots of heart-wrenching twists.

However, if you want a fun read, with interesting concept, a hint of innocence and blood then this is the book for you.  Sanderson never does things poorly so the book reads very well and it keeps you interested.  My impression was that it was written sort of like \\"Harry Potter\\" in style and format, but with a bunch more guns and death.  That would make a good jacket promo:<br /><br />\\"Harry Potter with guns and death\\" - Random Reader<br /><br />I will be looking forward to the sequel and buying it as soon as it's available.

It wasn't bad as in a terrible movie bad, it was bad as in tacky bad...I mean who would think to have a character bungee jump with a villians intestines? Robert Rodriguez, that's who. Can't wait for the second movie to come out on October 11, 2013!

They tried to tell me it was my phone but I tried 3 phones and 2 laptops, still told me something was wrong with my phones and computers. Google would not replace the chromecast which was clearly defective. Not worth the $35.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|****MAJOR SPOILERS**** While it was imaginative at times, it seemed like there were blatant mistakes throughout that just took away from the book. For example, Feithgold, a squire, gets kneed in the head during a fight, and the reader is lead to believe that the boy died. Later it is found out that he merely broke his leg. What? That didn't happen at all. It's mistakes like these along with inconsistent characters that really steal from the story itself. Another one that really bugged me was the fact that the king adores Thor, yet even after he hears his most trusted advisor proclaim that Thor is essentially the most powerful/magical individual in the kingdom, AND he sees Thor use magic to save his most trusted knight, AND sees several obvious omens of death which he himself believes wholeheartedly, he STILL ignores Thor and locks him up after the goblet was found out to be poisoned. Incidentally, his son, who he suspects  of a devious plot the entire book, declares Thor to be the poisoner, EVEN THOUGH Thor warned the king before he saved him from drinking  the goblet. What kind of murderer warns their target that they're going go be poisoned publicly and then SAVES their target. That was the climax of the book and it was the biggest plot hole I've read in a long time. Mistakes like this make an otherwise interesting story nearly unreadable.
0783227434|5.0|This movie is horror/comedy gold.  If you like B-movie cheese, you'll love this movie.  Play it in the background at your next Halloween party.
B008220D7S|5.0|Hilarious movie. my girlfriend and I saw it in theaters and felt that it totally depicted our life in the future and, maybe a little bit right now lol.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I never expected to like this book. I planned on reading the sample and moving on.<br />Somehow this author just hooks you.  The more you read the better it gets.<br />Then all of a sudden wham....didn't see that coming.<br />Fast read, gets you thinking, good book club book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Awesome action book and keep making  more awesome books after house of Hades like stories about cane chronicles and greek camps
B00ECTZKJ6|5.0|Clean Korn sound to rock too!  I personally think that Korn's music has progressed as the band has gotten older.  Fans have to remember that these bands become older and wiser so their music may change a little as they should to adapt to our changing times.  I really like the sound of this album.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|Best game In the world not damaged or defective perfect! ! You will love it too yes you will !
B003XREL98|2.0|I believe they did a TV series regarding this book which I did not see.  May be the series is more interesting.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I had a hard time following this because I was multitasking when I was watching it, but it had some nice twists on the plot.
B0010T56J0|5.0|Simple or as the say user friendly - a good one to see again and again and again and again.
B002EMESSM|1.0|This is a really boring movie.  I am a big fan of the old Star Trek series, but this movie is slow and boring.  I never realized how much so until I watched it with my daughter, who also enjoys the old series.  We did not even make it through the whole movie.
B003B02O0A|4.0|This book is one of the best I've read this year, perhaps because it asks one of the most common questions a parent would ask themselves. If my child were hurt, what would I do about it? I look forward to seeing the movie and comparing with the book. Grisham's characters are interesting (if sometimes archetypes) and the dialogue is enjoyable. It's easy to root for the good guys and hate the bad guys. What I found particularly striking was the gutsy, no-holds-barred manner that Grisham confronted the racial aspect of the book, from all points of view. It was a fearless approach, and worth the risk.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|My 7 year old has been on a superhero bender lately.  I was not very excited about Captain America (boring), but found that this was one of my favorite of the Marvel movies (along with the Avengers).  This is also one of his favorites.  So happy to be able to stream it to the computer for him.  Good action, clean fun and not boring.  If you saw Thor and were scared away, don't worry.  The areas that Thor was weak in (love interest, forced humor) are no problem for Cap.
B00BEIYMIS|2.0|I'm a bit mystified as to why this did so well at the box office. It didn't feature anything you haven't seen in a dozen other films in this genre (supernatural horror). The scares ranged between a mix of telegraphed \\"boo!\\" moments you saw coming ten miles away (hence \\"telegraphed\\") and the unfair (and cheap) tactic of having something suddenly appear out of the corner of the frame accompanied by a loud spike in the music. Come on--does that even count? My neighbor pulls the same crap every Halloween when he hides in the bushes and leaps out at trick-or-treaters. Of COURSE you're going to jump when something appears out of nowhere, we're human beings and it's in our physiology. Scaring people this way in a horror film is low brow.<br /><br />The performances were fine, no complaints there. The dialogue could have used some polishing, though. \\"Something awful happened here, Ed.\\" Sometimes the trite and corny lines feel like they came out of a Lifetime movie on the subject.<br /><br />The supernatural presence isn't terribly menacing once you realize this is a by-the-numbers horror flick and no one you care about is in any danger of dying. What you're left with is \\"shocking\\" footage of the entity dragging people around the house like rag dolls with no subtlety whatsoever. If you like your horror in-your-face and over-the-top, you'll love it.<br /><br />Make no mistake, this is a modern ghost story and it suffers every pitfall all modern horror films suffer from. Why it stood out of the pack this year, I have no idea. This is not some modern classic although it is VERY modern. It is another part of the \\"new\\" supernatural horror that seems to be taking over the box office and it has absolutely nothing original to offer.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, amazing that these kind of things actually happened and the poor orphans taken by train to parts unknown, not knowing what was in store for them. I loved how she related to a Molly in foster care.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|Great gameplay, but you will never get anywhere in the game without buying upgrades. Offers for you to &quot;insert your credit card&quot; are EVERYWHERE in the game. For example, &quot;Oh you just died [after having spent 30 minutes on a level]. Insert you credit card to be revived!&quot;<br /><br />The maxim &quot;buyer beware!&quot; definitely holds true here, but I am SURE there are disgruntled parents everywhere trying to get back the money their kids spent on this game.<br /><br />After spending HOURS on this game, and getting nowhere, I've uninstalled it, and say to you, &quot;buyer beware&quot;!
B00FN811SY|2.0|was able to download to these devices, but app wont open, not responding. does anyone else have these problems? thanx
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very good movie for whole family.<br />Funny from beginning to end waiting to see what they will do next. Wow
0833509454|1.0|I only bought &#34;IT&#34; because I am tutoring my 15 yr old grandson.  We chose a different book because the book was more explicit than the movie.  Way too much so for him.  He actually was dreading the reading of this book.  We have chosen 3 more appropriate books to read instead and he has almost finished the second one.  It is all for a points system in his school and I guess &#34;IT&#34; had 80 points out of the required reading of 100 points.

B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Really wasn't sure about this book, but I'd read the spin-off The Infernal Devices, Clockwork Angel and loved it. So I gave this a chance and I really like it, it must be due to Cassandra Clare's writing.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|Great game fun story mode but I.Finished the game and lost $2,800,000 I was  saving up other then that everything was great note you don't tilt like you do to drive in gangsters Rio it's opposite tilting.
0761169253|5.0|Delightful book to read. Was recommended by a friend, and I love this little book!  Great tips! Highly recommended! A+
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Some things are different than the beloved movie, but I enjoyed the book even more! It really brings you a more detailed look at the lives of the people of Whistle Stop.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I really like it. It kept you on your feet and it was really awesome! It's a great movie to buy.
B0064NTZ6W|5.0|Very realistic portrayal of life on a sub. I had a VHS copy of this movie .....glad I found this hd DVD version
B0035RFYT2|5.0|IT LOOKS GREAT YOU CAN FEEL THE FUR ON THE WOLF. THE WOLF WILL BE GREAT TO DO A DIORAMA.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Danny de Vito overdid himself in this children comedy, really absurd, that can make you laugh more to you than o your kids. is a very good moment to have. if you don't want to buy, rent it, but you're going to have a ball with this kids & their Walkyrie like principal
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Ive always loved this movie. Wanted to replace my cassett.  wore it out and can watch this many more times
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Matthew McConaughey is a cool dude to be sympathetic with<br /><br />I find him interesting to watch as an actor... it is just something about the way he manipulates his face<br />when he is in different charactors
B00594XOZU|1.0|It worked at first but now it won't work something about try again in a bit can someone please fix this issue I love this app and it would be awesome if somebody got this app fixed as I can enjoy it again.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am reading this book and doing the experiments with several other women and we are having fun sharing the results of our experiments.  It is definitely an enlightening book, written with humor and filled with great quotes.  But, the best part is the simple, fun experiments.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Super cool and addictive only thing i don't like is you have to pay for more gold<br /><br />Besides that its awesome
B000SEGSB8|5.0|A great read, a seminal work. Living in the United States, I knew so little of the European scene. Eight hundred pages, but handles beautifully on my Kindle. I consider it to be one of the most interesting and important books of our time.
B00ECTZKJ6|3.0|I was somewhat let down by this new CD. I had hoped with return of Brian that the record would've really taken off. I actually prefer their previous records without Head to this particular one. This will be the first time I will have to let a Korn record grow on me by repeated listenings. I'm sure I'll come back around and give it another star.<br /><br />After watching the bonus Reconciliation DVD, I have to admit I liked the songs better raw than how they were later merged with an electronics sound....and I was a fan of The Path To Totality! It just seems like a lot of the guitars were buried in the mix.
B00FKE3H0G|5.0|I was surprised myself, but I love this album. I love the ballad Adore you, and all of the faster paced fun songs such as her hit Can't Stop. I like the 4x4 song very much and my favorite is Wrecking Ball. I am glad I bought this album and find Miley to be entertaining and fun.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|If you're into literature or art, this movie is a must have.  I had to watch it multiple times to fully appreciate all the vignettes included so finally just bought it.  The music accompaniment is great and really suits the mood, and the way Gill is pulled into the time warp of 20s Paris is well done and enchanting.  The movie is perfectly cast with all the actors really seeming like the artists they play.  The modern day part of the story is funny and a good foil for the sidestory after midnight.<br /><br />I found myself more interested in pursuing some of the classics after seeing this movie which personalized the artists and authors.  The movie is so much more than just casual entertainment because it adds depth to our lives.  It begs us to think back to times we might like to have lived, and people we might have known then, and not just the good parts but the bad parts as well.  I consider it a real gift to those who yearn for the 'good old days' whenever one thinks they might have been.  This is a great movie that's so much more than it appears at first watching.
B0039RY3MM|5.0|This thing really works! Applied it between the die and ihs and temps dropped further 10c compared to NH-1... I don't know how it will perform on the long run but still... Awesome for now.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the book had a lot of sexual content but was very well written and the story line was great. Would recommend it
B00F8L2VO4|4.0|Easy to follow and learn from overall, and it goes at a good pace, but the audio for the French speaker REALLY mumbles a lot (unless that's just a French thing) I have no idea when it is speaking singular or plural and it can be very frustrating when I am expected to write what I hear, and it doesn't forgive mistakes. Still, I think I am progressing well. Recommended
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|I liked the two previous Iron Man movies and love comic book characters brought to the big screen. But this movie didn't make much sense and was really boring. The problems are that many of the action scenes are inconsistent. The movie is ok to rent but glad we didn't spend the money to see it at a theater. If you are a die-hard Iron Man fan then you'll probably like the movie but if you expect at least a minimum of consistency and expectations then you might be disappointed with Iron Man 3, we were.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|It's OK. I found it an easy read (got through it in a couple days). To be honest, it was a little boring, and nothing like the show.
B0000CFW87|5.0|We played our original CD so much that the sound began to reflect poor quality and so this purchase was for a replacement CD.  We really enjoy this Josh Groban CD.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My little niece & nephew LOVE this move. He is one & it pretty much is the only thing he watches, as soon as he hears the music start at the beginning of the movie he comes running. I'm so glad I was able to get this for them.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I chose this rating because everything was handled perfectly.<br />The children that visit will enjoy every moment of these DVD;s.
B00915G6MG|5.0|My husband is a BIG N.C.I.S fan & with this purchase he now has all of the seasons & after this season (11) I will but that for him also.
B00FAVRHBE|1.0|Where is Eccleston, the most underrated iteration of the Doctor? Smith and Tennant are ok, but Eccleston is where it is at. And no Captain Jack? No deal.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I love period piece movies & shows, this series is the BEST!!! I love it & I look forward to time by myself watching the lives of the often very colorful characters. Can't wait for season 4 to start.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i don't know how i managed with out my kindle. I recommended it, straight away to 3 of my bookworming friends and they feel exactly the same. ANY book/song/game/video/weather report/horoscope/subscriptions/reminder calander/etc, ANY time is too fantastic for words. I would NEVER be without one from this day forward. Thanx Amazon
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season is so good. Never a dull moment. Some shocking surprises of major characters being killed off. I'm so looking forward to season 4. I watch these shows over & over & never get bored. All the actors are wonderful, but I think Maggie Smith takes the cake!
B00000IZOR|1.0|The phone cord was way to short............................................ Not worth buying.... waste of money.... Did not like this toy at all
B0095VPAVE|5.0|this was a great APU it did what it was made for and I planned to buy a graphic card to crossfire for more performance.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying this if your on a budget and want play recent games that came out.
B003ZFVI8U|5.0|One of my all time favorite albums a complete joint from start to finish. Metal music with a groove and Neil Fallon's voice never sounded stronger.
B0087X1V6Y|5.0|Came fast and just as described. I didn't read the book but I watch the show. The book looks nice on our book shelf.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Really upbeat music.  Great to listen to when you're studying and don't want words competing with your thoughts.  Loved the entire album.
B008Y6Y1RA|4.0|Great movie great deal. I wanted to buy this for a while and it was on sale so I grabbed it real quick. Worth every penny.
B004YXE438|5.0|It's a great puzzle with beautiful pictures. Perfect when your looking for a quiet distraction.  I love being able to bring the full picture up again when I get stuck  And the check Mark when you've angled the piece correctly. Kudos!
B003VANOFY|1.0|These headsets are advertised as being 'for gamers' but they forgot the most important part -- lag.<br /><br />The headset disconnects frequently and unpredictably. One minute I'll be planning an amubush with my teammates, next minute no sound, no mic, no nothing. As a gamer, lag is pretty much the most frustrating thing in the world, so this headset will not work for me.<br /><br />Oh well, good thing for Amazon's return policy.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Imaginative and masterful story telling. I thought seventeen was young for boot camp! I could not put the book down!
B0012GMUPO|5.0|Two songs on this album hit #1 on MTV and radio for weeks. Must have for any Alice Cooper fan. :D
B0013ND30M|1.0|The package appeared to not be open but when i went to use the disney movie code it was already used by another user so they must open the movies register the codes and then pt them back as i bought 3 movies from the seller 2 of which should of been able to register but the coeds had already been used the 3rd movie doesnt even work.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Well worth the purchase to have! Great plot and computer generated graphics look amazing on this movie. Your kids will love this movie!
B000OLGCI4|1.0|The package appeared to not be open but when i went to use the disney movie code it was already used by another user so they must open the movies register the codes and then pt them back as i bought 3 movies from the seller 2 of which should of been able to register but the coeds had already been used the 3rd movie doesnt even work
0345530578|5.0|It was typical Grisham - an intricate plan, worked out over time, that finally comes together at the end.  It reminded me of  the ending to \\"The Firm\\" which they unfortunately changed in the movie.  Haven't read any of his stuff in awhile, but will check out another one after enjoying this one.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|The Eagles at their best, this blue ray concert is a must gave for anyone that enjoys REAL music. They don't make bands like this anymore. Highly recommended, excellent audio quality and good picture quality.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|The marketing information really changed the way I think about how to connect with my audience. Thank you! Highly recommended.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much! It was very educational. If you had asked me before I read it I would have said I knew a lot about Tesla. I discovered I did not know even half of what I learned in this book. Plus it was written in a talky style that made you feel the author was sitting in the room talking to you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love my pinterest, and use it daily. It's easy to use, it's easy to gain followers with the same interests as you. I just simply love pinterest.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD, and the airplane game works fine for me as there is a microphone (up by the camera). If you have such a hard time just turn it off in the options.<br /><br />I first played this on the iPad and LOVED it. Since then I very eagerly awaited its release in the amazon appstore. So happy it is finally here! What a great time killer. The game gets more challenging as you go, but that's what is the best about it. Awesome playability and you can go back to it again at any time for a short burst of fun. You never know what levels you will get so it is always something different. The characters are cute and you can't help but feel good when you save them!<br /><br />If they were to add more levels some day... I think I would yell with joy! Even with those already in, though, I know I will have many hours of fun!
0446310786|5.0|If you've never read this, read it! I've read it three times now and have seen the movie.  It never fails to move you.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This is far and away the best clock app for the kindle that is out there.  I have been using it for a year and it gets better with every update.  From weather to white noise, you couldn't ask for more!
B00E0SX118|5.0|My kids absolutely love The Croods.  They watch it over and over.  My wife and I enjoyed it as well.
B002N14GPE|4.0|Great movie, but weird at the end when the girl turned into a lady and was hitting on her father.  Creepy! But good
1878424319|5.0|The four agreements is a Inspiring book! I couldn't put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anybody that want to better themselves.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Got this cuz of a deaaaaaaaaal!<br />Aaaaaand! I got it the next day! And I chose the free shipping option so I was expecting it come in a week!<br />sooo worth it!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I was excited ordering this because we watch a lot of shows through amazon instant video so we thought this would be great in that we would not be limited in our viewing sources.  However, once we got it and hooked it up we quickly realized that it only streams YouTube and Netflix.  Nothing else.  I don't understand why .  I think this is a deal breaker for a lot of people.  I guess ours will be going back soon.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Very very adictive.  You won't be able to put it down.  Familiar game with a twist.  Just when you think you have it figured out,  something else gets added.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Sometimes we choose the easy way.<br />Sometimes we can make it fast and simple.<br />Sometime we make mistakes in wrong direction.<br />It is human but the mistake could be expensive.<br />If you want develop and growth your company, read this book.<br />It goes against common sense, theories, business plan and so on.<br />Simplify your business. Be practical.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I can watch Netflix with it on my TV without stuttering that is evident from my LG Bluray player with Netflix.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Having a hard time figuring it out.  I uninstalled.  Need better instructions and being user friendly.  Will revisit down the road.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love this show and this was the last season I was trying to get caught up on. This is a great show.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game for any hidden object fan,you can play with existing fb friends and add new friends via the fb fan page.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I loved the Special FX.The actors where great and the plot was good as well.I would recommend to a friend.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|This is no good..  don't waste your money! How do I get a refund??  Does not work on kindle fire HD...
B00D48BSBA|4.0|When I pre-ordered the book, I was not sure what to expect! But once I started reading it, I felt the same gripping, edge-of-the-seat feeling I had when I read the Day of the Jackal! This book is all the way a Fredrick Forsyth Classic!
B0012DT9VK|4.0|My kids watch this movie over and over again.  They really never get tire of it.  I can let them watch this while the rest of the family is doing something else.
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|Loved this movie!!Good message for kids. A great movie that I'm sure my kids will watch over and over again!
B000BF0D9M|5.0|love this cd and just saw him live, amazing!!! Will be ordering more of Jesse Cook's cd's. And more of other artist's.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Live the game I play it all the time my little cousin she loves it too!! This game is for everyone no matter the age!
1401938906|5.0|Awesome book. The experiments worked for me and a times freaked me out a little. I was very pessimistic about the book, but it's made me a believer 100%
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Really good show. I saw it twice. So it had to be pretty good.Kind of predictable, but I enjoyed it.
B008B1BL4E|5.0|It gets the goal of changing ideas about how WWI came to life. And it is very well written. The beginning is a real thriller.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was my FAVORITE BOOK OF ALL TIME IT WAS REALLY SAD AND FUNNY AT TIMES<br />I JUST REALLY LIKED IT
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Not typically the kind of book I would pick up, but this one was riveting. Twists and turns like crazy, and I'm still not sure what exactly was going on... But then again, that's why it's a series not a stand alone novel. Will def have to read the second book!
B007SZ0E1K|4.0|It is fast, cheap, and easy to overclock.  Beast of a cpu that is well worth the money.  Would definitely purchase again.  However, do yourself a favor and purchase an aftermarket CPU cooler with it.  I tried to use the stock cooler, but it was loud and didn't cool very well at all.  After I ran the stock cooler for a couple of weeks, I ordered the CM Hyper 212 EVO for about $30 and that thing works SO much better.  Knocking off 1 star for the crappy stock cooler.
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|I belong to a book club that suggested this book .  I am not into fantasy .  The author is well a respect writer and his books are selling very well.<br />It was simply not my style.  If it was to be like the Chronicles of Narniah  I didn't get it.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love the app! It works great! But it would be nice if we could have the Facebook messenger app for kindle fire.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is awesome. I cant remember life before it! the only bad thing is it is addicting. I love this game.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Great movie. Entertaining and unexpected turn of events. Some comedy which makes the movie the more fun to watch. I recommend this movie.
B00FJTWK0U|5.0|This is a great movie to watch with a date, and is not too cheesy or corny. The movie consists of mostly dialogue and does not have ridiculously moments consistently found in other romance movies such as the inevitable breakup scene, only to be reunited later. Just smart conversation, and none of the lame cliches and gimmicks.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|The entire premise of the production has a humor to it. I enjoy much of the juvenile humor that MacFarlane puts into every thing he writes. There are some dull scenes, but overall the movie is a perfect late night laugh
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Simply a great app. The Google store is good, but not nearly a bigger selection as Kindle. Somewhat a chore to download, but once figured out on the Note 2, simply worth it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's the closest thing you can get to owning your own horse. It never crashes and it keeps you intrigued to do more
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This volume, while enjoyable, left me feeling like nothing much happened. Slightly disappointed but enticed as well. Can hardly wait.
0785153942|4.0|Awesome book!  I wish it was longer.  I went to watch the movie begrudgingly and ended up loving it. Pacific Rim was my favorite movie of 2013. I would love to read more about the storyline before and after. I bought this as a birthday gift for my 12 year old daughter and she loved it.  Please write more!
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Enjoyable read but found it dragged a bit at the end. It was difficult to follow various stories and how they fit with each other at times. Again an insightful book into Afghanistan. 1000 Splendid Suns is Hosseini's masterpiece. It changed my view on refugees like no other information I had received before and I'm so grateful to have read it.
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|The detail, colors , and simply everything in this blue ray master piece is a worthy new addition to my extensive library.i have rescheduled an additional viewing with my wife and we will share  a bottle of champagne in my movie room , and escape into this magic world . Highly recommended...must be blue ray and on a large screen,with full surround
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and a Kindle Fire HD...this app works geat on both of them!  It's very quick and easy to use!
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This is the best book I have read on how we might really begin to help all children make better decisions in their life.  It is thought provoking and I hope that we can further study this and then figure out a way to use it in our schools.
B00ELD3MUW|2.0|This &#34;product&#34; was ok. It did not help much but give me hope that there is a flash for android.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Greatest game ever, just wish other developers would make cool games like this one. If you are a person who likes puzzles you will like this game. It also has awesome graphics. Thank you fire maple games and keep making games like this.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This was one of the best family cartoon movies that has been out in a while.  I recommend it to all!
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|Have not stopped listening to this album since I got it, it's an auditory feast from start to finish.  A nice variety of material too while still keeping within the NIN gritty, electro-funk-rock realm.  Hesitation Marks coyly keeps on the prettier side of gritty in terms of sound compared to previous material.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I recommend Amazon for all books & now movies they always come in  ahead of schedule.  Giving it to my husband in a few days for his birthday
B00FFHG6KQ|5.0|my first match most then known by 17 the second one. This game didn't takenskill it's just fun it's worth the pay Althought they are few  bug they are going to be updated
B0084HJE0S|1.0|This is content-free, wild rambling of an open-source zealot (nothing negative intended; some of my best friends are zealots) and was probably conceived after one-too-many at Starbucks and more than one delivery at your standard geek-fest. I thought this was a book about JavaScript or HTML5, and it really very little content about either other than a short one-mans-opinion history and some pep talk. I learned nothing other than Microsoft was the first to implement Ajax (I looked it up... it is true... imagine that). I want those 15 minutes back...
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|i love this thing! i wish i could stream sites from my phone onto the screen, but besides that all the features it supports work with out  a hitch! do need wifi though so keep that in mind if you got a wired internet set up.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|I am so in love with this album right now. I got to bed listening to it and wake up listening to it. Right now my favorite song has to be Rock City.
B000W21ER4|5.0|This album brings back so many memories of high school for me. There wasn't much to do in Arkansas so rocking out occupied many an afternoon/night. Thanks Weezer for making teenage years less painful.
B00E9P959O|4.0|Re-mixing this album had to be hard.  That was an album even Rush never thought would see light. There are several good songs but some technical issues as well as lubricating Rush's machinery to factor in. Truthfully some of the remixed are improved with cool notable changes, while some songs I felt were possibly removing parts I liked.<br /><br />Ceiling Unlimited blew me away at 4 minutes in. Reason for this was I love Lifeson solos and on this record there few and almost more like melodic keyboards parts. Still if you liked this song,  solo adds strength to that track.<br /><br /> I think this is more of a need for Rush to bring clarity to some good melidic songs and die hard Rush fans needing something to sink their teeth into.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|An enjoyable game for all ages Collect as many banana s as you can and catch the minions on the side to maximize your score Hours of fun for all ages amazing graphics
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I really wanted to play this game. I grew up with the old one. This game wouldn't even open. After I clicked on the icon it would try to open then it would go black and close.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|It was a really good movie.The script a master piece in horror and very exciting.Thank You,Guy's for your outstanding service.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have always been a Trekkie, watching all the TV series & movies.  I have especially loved the last two movies where we got to see how the team got together.  I loved seeing a more emotional Spock.  Being a Sherlock fan, I enjoyed the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch as the villain.  Now that the Klingons were introduced in this movie, I hope to see more of them in the next Star Trek movie..
B00BIVN82M|5.0|As with all Michael Buble's music it is a fantastic album. I listen to it almost every day. Highly recommend.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|was very surprised to see just how bright this little light is,<br />easily lights up a tent, will also work well in a power outage.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|Totally character driven and, certainly, not PC, I think it is one of the best TV series ever produced. Micheal Chiklis is phenomenal and Walton Goggins is his equal. The language is rough, very rough, and it is violent, but it is an amazing tour de force. There is nothing predictable about this series. A super charged rush. Highly recommended--but not for the faint of heart.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have used Duolingo previously on the computer and would highly recommend the service.  It is a completely free way to learn other languages and can even be used (for a few lessons) offline.  If you are looking to learn another language or brush up on a language you already know, check this out!
048629823X|5.0|Everyone should read this book.  This man found, and kept, such an amazing quantity of wisdom that's all still relevant two millennia  down the road.
B00BAXFAOW|2.0|I expect better from Mr. Gladwell.  He's always had some stretches in reasoning, but this... this was just ridiculous.  When you can't even enjoy reading something because the logic center of your brain is completely rejecting the plausibility.. well, then you might as well be watching or reading bad science fiction.<br />I give this two stars, mainly because the writing style is still excellent even if the content is a major letdown.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I found this book to be a page-turning shot of inspiration! The journey of imagination, fueled by a tenacious spirit has never been explained more eloquently. If you feel like creative rigamortis has set in, this is probably the book to shake you from that paralysis. Thank you!
B008D1RCI6|5.0|Discovered this in a Mojo review. What a wondreful recording!  Full, melodic and melancholy  Bill Fay is unique- a revelation
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love it, it works perfect for my kindle and it plugs right it to my computer, the length was just right aswell.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|The movie started out great then it took a weird turn, I don't think it was worth the money I paid.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Intricate plot,well developed and in many respects topical of what happens allover the world..Grisham always seem to come up with a good book.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|It sharpens all my kitchen knifes very well. However, one of the carbide side pieces keeps falling out. It appears it wasn't properly glued in.
B0000714BP|5.0|No one else had this movie, but Amazon did.  Too hilarious!  One of Patrick Swayze's less popular movies, but worth getting.  Couldn't even find it on iTunes
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is wonderful!!!It is easy to use and I use it 24/7!If you love Pintrest or you are interested, this is the app for you!I mean, you don't pay anything!It is 100% free!It has a tutorial to show you how to work it, and plenty more.In the end, this is a great app!Get it! :-)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Likes: fluid writing style, lots of philosophical insights, surprising ending<br />Dislikes: not much to dislike;<br />Looking forward for the movie !
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A brisk read with interesting characters and numerous twists. High action high drama with a hip style for younger audiences.
B005KIQDYE|5.0|My 6 year old loved it.  Pieces are of good quality and fits very well and the instructional material is very clear.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|it's not one of my favorite but I wanted to try it, I rather play the star wars more fun!<br />I don't care for space but it was free so why not try it!
B00FJTYDKK|2.0|It kept skipping. We had to continually reload the movie to get it to play. That was pretty frustrating and I wish to be refunded the paid amount.
B00AZMFJYA|1.0|I saw the movie at the cinema and loved it, so I couldn't wait for the DVD.<br />The problem is that the DVD is unwatchable. I live in Japan, buy DVDs from the US, and watch them on my computer.<br />I've never had a problem doing this until now. I can only assume that there is so much copy protection software in the DVD that is unwatchable on anything other than a US DVD player.<br />Shipping a US DVD player to Japan just to watch one movie is ridiculous, so I now have a useless DVD and will have to wait for up to a year for the Japanese release.<br />I hope the Japanese DVD will be watchable.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|After several recommendations and reading reviews, I started reading &#34;The Husbands Secret&#34; and, basically did not put it down.  The chronicles a week in the lives of three different character sets who are all loosely familiar with each other at the beginning of the week, but by they end of the week, they are all intertwined.  Cecilia, the Tupperware salesperson with 3 daughters; Rachel, the widowed mom with a grown son and murdered daughter; Tess, happily married mom to a young son.  As I started reading, the novel was richly written and wonderfully put together going into the stories that make up their lives then putting them all together.  Even when I thought I knew what was going to happen, I was wrong--happily.  I thoroughly enjoyed the novel and the aspects of life/moral situations/decisions that impact the direction life can take and how that impacts many others too.  My favorite part was at the end, when the author includes what might have been, if only...............
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I dont watch much TV...but when I do....It's Sons of Anarchy.  By far my favorite program, enough drama and action for me well written and amazingly portrayed by all actors and actresses. Thank Kurt for the awesome show!!
B00136Q1I0|4.0|love it. Been looking for a complete collection of springsteen collection. this disc is a great addition to any collection.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|Very entertaining with a few surprises.  No sex, and only one short scene with mild violence.  This movie is one I have enjoyed watching over again, so added it to my library.  Great dance scene.  Deals with a mental illness well.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|Bought it for my ex on his birthday, He loved it!!
B00AEFYK5M|4.0|An old favorite.  True love story between two people from very different upbringings and wealth.  Meet while at college.<br />Great casting, lovely music.
B00BEIYP8A|4.0|Humankind had seemingly spent its eons of existence trying to move from Point A to Point B faster since it first came out of the slime and hit the land running. Naturally if we are hard-wired to seek to go from Point A to Point B faster, be it via goat-cart of sleek spaceship some guys, and lately some gals too,  want to be the fastest kid on the block, and get recognition for being Number One. The Ron Howard film under review, Rush, takes a modern day look at one such competitive flash in the world of top-shelf auto-racing.<br /><br />Here Howard takes a look at the famous 1970s duel between Austrian Nikki Lauda and Englishman James Hunt (famous in auto-racing circles because I, frankly, was totally unaware of this competition). Both men in their respective ways were errant sons but both were desperate to be Number One in their chosen field, Formula One auto-racing. Number One at being the fastest kid on the block. Number One too in staring death in the face in a \\"human bomb\\" as one of them described it.<br /><br />Now to be honest I get a little nervous, and not just cop nervous, going eighty miles an hour in a very serviceable tank (a tank compared to the high-tech machines they raced in). I also admit to having no interest at all in auto-racing at this level, although as a teenager I rode \\"shot-gun\\" a few times on \\"chicken runs\\" down at the far end of old Hullsville Beach (Massachusetts) when the king of the hill in that locale and my friend \\"Stew-ball Stu\\" Larkin took on all- comer and took all the girls back in the day, he 1960s day (that was why I was riding shot-gun, to get Stu's \\"rejects\\" not to stare death in the face, hell no). But that was maybe at ninety miles an hour, tops. However this film grabbed me and grabbed my companion too who gets nervous when she goes over sixty.<br /><br />In the end the reason that it grabbed me (us) was the pure desire of both men to win at whatever cost, win to define who they were in this wicked old world, and to stare death in the face and not flinch, not flinch at all. To go the edge and back. They both had very different styles, Lauda the technician, the guy who has every angle figured out from design to the curves and Hunt, well, Hunt a throw-back playboy who just wanted a drive, wanted to drive something fast even if it is a go-cart, drive it desperately, drive it like there was no tomorrow. I would assume most audiences would cheer for Brother Hunt (especially women with his Brad Pitts good looks) but would not be unhappy to see Nikki cross the checkered flag first either for other reasons. Nice work.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Just a nice movie with great actors.  This is one I enjoy watching over and over.  I love the setting and the music, too.<br />No violence or sex.  George Clooney is perfect in this roll.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|So far I haven't had the time. I haven't had a chance to really use it. I think that it will be very helpful in the future.
B0063M22QO|5.0|A fun and entertaining game. Lots of strategies. I would love to have more levels. Enjoy the game a lot.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works like a charm. I wasn't able to open a lot of pdf'd on my kindle. After installing adobe its now OK.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Just bought the  full version and I love it... it works great plus I love how it looks and it shows the weather  awsome
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Brilliant writing. One of the best fantasy novels I have read. I would highly suggest it to any lover of fiction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I finally got this app it was almost like I was playing it on the computer if you like minecraft as much as I do this is a MUST HAVE app for you.<br />Experience my joy in this game and have fun while your at it also if you want to do more stuff on you unnecessary or get Minecraft Invetitor too. Thanks for reading my response on this awesome game.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Excellent quality, this is the second one I have purchased as a gift.<br />I need to buy one for me.  It looks expensive.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|I love Doctor Who and can't wait for the special! I know i'll be glued to TV, will you?<br /><br />YES! CAN NOT WAIT!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I liked how the story was told. It was an easy read! A good book about out actions and consequences! Loved it!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Setup is always looked on as a challenge. Google found a way to make this as painless as possible. Another surprise was when I moved it to a different location, the part recognized t and started the simple setup again. This doesn't always happen with electronic things so I was doubly impressed.
B0000067L2|5.0|In the mid 1960's when Rock & Roll was mostly &#34;white Blues&#34;, only one band took the Chicago Blues one step forward. Influence of Soul music and Urban Blues is very strong in this one, that makes it a fine psychedelic Rock and classic Rock music.  Clapton's guitar solos resembles Albert King guitar playing style, and Ginger Baker's African style drumming, makes this record very unique. This band opened new doors for Rock music.<br /><br />A must record for classic Rock and Blues lovers.
B004HD61KE|4.0|James Rollins (a pen name) is similar to Dan Brown, Steve Berry, Raymond Khoury and others who create a group of characters serving or retired from a Government Military think tank who uses obscure facts to mold his stories around. Readers who use a Kindle or iPad to access these novels might enjoy, as I do, slowing down and becoming sidetracked to learn more about the factual information and even relying on social media to share information they have discovered. I never joined a book club, but I imagine this to be what draws most readers. It adds and additional dimension to reading that eBook readers enjoy. One of James Rollin's Sigma Force novels took place in Denmark - virtually the same location as another Author's main Character Cotton Malone retired agent for the Magellan Billet. Now wouldn't it be interesting if their character's crossed a each author collaborated on a novel where an alliance is created to save the world from &#34;The Guild&#34;?<br />I've enjoyed the Sigma series and while I sit in my own comfortable reading location I can explore the world; past, present and future (and maybe even alternative worlds and times).<br />I gave it one star less only because it remains fiction and I'm not using the rest of my senses to participate the adrenalin rush!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Can't wait to start the next book,definitely worth the five dollars! I have read awful books that cost quadruple that amount
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Great Show as most of the BBC shows are...so good i watched them all back to back. Kept me in suspense until the very last episode...can't wait till next season..
B00BNW0DI8|5.0|I love this movie and the Blu-ray edition is very good.  This is a good buy.  And I'm glad to be able to get it.
B001TH16DI|5.0|My son is one of the biggest Trekkies of all!  He loved receiving this set as he is gradually replacing all of his dvds with blue ray versions.  Plus the price was great!
B009HUB40Y|2.0|this is not just for me but it is ok just does not old my att: stoll play it some
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch for my husband for Father's Day and he loves it.  Seiko has always made great watches and this one continues the tradition.  The face is the perfect size on my husband's wrist and he loves having the hands glow in the dark.
B009G41CG2|3.0|please change the background it is hard to see the tiles but a good game cant play long at a time
B002QE3CTY|5.0|The way this story is told in the first person, it is assumed the main character is alive to tell the story. this could be said this will ruin the story, but I like it done this way.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I'm a big fan of the show pretty little liars and I've always wanted to read the books. I highly recommend reading this. It's very similar to the show but more detailed.
B009C7JS14|5.0|My opinion about this amazing story is that...<br />It shows up on you notification checker.<br />It shows how the weather is and how nice it is or cold it is outside.<br />It's the best thing I've ever seen and so you can also upgrade for like 1.99 cents<br />So cone and get these new weather things buy it<br /><br />  Thank you
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|Just what the nutty scientist wanted. My precocious grandkid  8 put it together in about an hour.  Not sure he is ready for the adult themes in BTTF Part 2.
B00002SWEM|5.0|Watching this DVD transported me back in time.  As they moved through the streets of Cuba I was so moved by the beautiful architecture.  The cars and building made you feel as though you were back to a place which just felt like home.  I've never been to Cuba, but this story was so moving, so touching, I wanted to be sitting in a little caf&eacute; sipping tea. I wanted to sit by the beautiful water, and just listen to them play music, and tell their story.  I cannot speak Spanish, but this movie wanted me to learn Spanish, because the artist song with such passion I wanted to know what they were singing.  Just writing this is making me want to put the dvd in the player, and watch right now. This was excellently done, and so moving. I pray I get to visit Cuba one day. That someone will drive me along the road in a 1950's car and let me just listen to this beautiful music as I just watch the ocean as we are driving along and enjoy the scenery.  This movie won my heart.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|It is a wonderfull book. The writing is smoth and makes you fell the author was in the head of her characters. I was very sorry when the book ended.
B00DCRE8TW|5.0|When Duff Mckagan is involved in a band, you can be sure that band will be something great. That is the case with Walking Papers.<br />The best rythm section in the world, Duff and Barret Martin! The best album of the year!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This is a great little device. Cheap as. In Australia, you cannot get the Chromecast app or the Hulu/Netflix apps. You have to scour the web, find the apk's and then side load them. Once you overcome this inconvenience, it is not that bad, but still a little limited. If Google can get cracking on (a) dealing with the geoblocking rubbish and (b) making more apps Chromecast compatible, this could really give Apple TV and other streaming devices a run for their money!
0451530780|3.0|Seems very cheap book (which is the truth), if could, I'd like to buy another one with higher quality instead of this.
B002OHK7CS|1.0|Over glorification of violence, threats, lawbreaking, dangerous firearms use, and vigilante-ism as a solution to problems; we're supposed to cheer the \\"heroes\\", who are a gang of outlaw bikers. It's really over the top with gratuitous and shameless and moronic every problem has a threat or brute-force solution. This series reaches a new low for dangerous and total irresponsible firearms usage, and is exhibit 'A' why hollyrot should be banned from having access to firearms. Everyone (even the characters that start off \\"good\\") eventually resort to violence, carry illegal handguns, and/or are part of some under-handed lawless \\"solution.\\" Pure garbage for an ignorant trashy society. No wonder it's a \\"hit\\" in Amerika. Shame.
B008PZZV8S|4.0|This movie really kept you wondering what Matt Damon (Mr. Ripley), would do next. How he would get out the next problem he encountered with his psychopathic personality at its mostt dangerous...<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot for those that may have not seen it. However, I am left wondering if Mr. Ripley is gay. I'm assuming that he is supposed to be.<br /><br />All in all its a movie that I would not consider a five star, but a must watch in any case at 4 stars.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Really fun, it takes some time to garnish the skills but stick with it. This developer has many sports with the same controls, find yours:-)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I love this book! It kept my attention the entire time and I just kept wanting to read more. It brings up interesting issues.
B00DU77QP2|2.0|Boring.  Don't believe the hype that this is good.  It falls way below Twlight and Harry Potter.  Crap book, crap storyline.  I found this hard to follow and was disappointed that I wasted my money buying it.  Apparently the movie is supposed to be good but I don't think I would be watching it.
B007BLCJJ6|1.0|Boring and weak drama, It is about a cult or local weird family , not sure. messed up situation offered in a very weak drama
B008BM9L72|1.0|Crap really.  So many people rate this book and I hate it.  If you need this to kick your relationship up a level this is not the book I would recommend.  The plot line is poor.  The characters are crap and its badly written.  The people who love it really need their heads read.
0810971496|2.0|When I received the book I was DISSATIFIED with all the writing in the book. This was a waste because my granddaughter could not write in the book what she wanted because someone else already had. If you are stating that the book is in very good condition that is what I expected but not what I received. You should have stated that this book was in fair condition, not VERY GOOD CONDITION. The cover of the book was in very good condition but the inside had way too much writing on the pages. A WASTE OF MONEY...will watch out for this company in the future.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|I enjoyed this.  Its a long book but has great characters and a great storyline.  And while the good guys win in the end its amazing what lengths the evil characters go to.  The introduction of the Plague is interesting and you really feel for all the characters dealing with it.<br />A great story, great read
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end. Good acting, good directing, Giant robots, Giant monsters, and no stupid stuff thrown on top. This is a thousand times better than transformers!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A bit like Forrest Gump but in book.  Funny and full of lots of historical figures and crazy events.  I don't think I will ever look at an old person in the same way.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|Incredible set. Very detailed, fun to build, looks great on display. I'm 18 and I still love Legos, this set is one of the reasons.
B009WUBERW|1.0|This movie is a sequel but the dialogue is stilted and predictable.  How many times do we need to hear the former California governor say, &#34;I'll be back&#34; before any humor in it is lost?  When Bruce Willis says the line to Schwartzenegger who responds, &#34;Yippee ki-yay&#34; it was mildly amusing and probably the best exchange of dialogue un the movie which is not saying much.  While reality is generally suspended in these movies the fact that the band of &#34;expendables&#34; are apparently bulletproof and are therefore unexpendable.  While exchanging gunfire with their adversaries the stars cannot miss while the baddies cannot hit the broadside of a barn.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Very simple and quick to use and has too too many options for exactly what I want. I'd recommend it to everyone with and android
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game works great on my kindel. But I found that on my iTouch it froze up. Still love it though.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Excellent book! This book was the first book by Nicolas sparks that I have read, and I plan to read more of his books.  I had a hard time putting this book down. Would highly recommend to read.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Miss Sylvia day can write a book, i was so angry when i realize that the series weren't over yet than i imagine the endless possibility for the 4th book and squirmed,You better bring it on Miss Day.
B0068FYZ84|5.0|I adore this movie!  The &#34;look and feel&#34; is unlike any other movie I have seen.  It does a wonderful job engaging the viewer with the animal characters.  It is heartwarming and endearing.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|Uno!!! I love this game, i have the iphone version but it is so much better on a bigger screen.
B00ET47USI|5.0|I love this game when you move the cards the spades move like they are dancing, it's fun to watch and to play
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I am a big fan of iron man, i love the graphics on my kindle,its fun for everyone to play.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great kid friendly movie. Very humorous and the action was enough to keep us all entertained. Will watch this again
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Good movie. Great action. I just wish the ending would have been a little bit better. But overall a good action adventure flick.
B000002UCN|5.0|I had this CD on my Wish List since George Harrison passed away. This is a great CD, with a lot of his best-known works. Well worth it.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Ok - I admit it, I am a grown woman who is lapping up this clever, well developed caricature of modern high school life.  Caricature is probably a touch belittling a description - the characters themselves and the plot go a bit deeper then a the facade of the different stereotypical people you would see in a high school - and I think that's what endears me to this show more so than a show like Glee.  And at the same time there are laugh out loud very clever, funny moments.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|If you love music and/or romance, you'll love this.  WARNING: it does not have the &#34;happy ending&#34; so many people seem to require from movies.  Not all stories end with a &#34;happily ever after.&#34;  But the ending is honest. And the movie comes across like a documentary, as if someone just happened to film this happening. It's charming and entertaining and compelling.  So much so that they made an incredibly-successful Broadway show out of it.  See the original - it's SO worth it.
1402720602|2.0|This is supposed to be a step-by-step instructional book and at this it is a dismal failure. Too many errors, inconsistencies, and vague instructions. The plans don't agree with the book; even the paper plans and the acetate plans don't agree. I doubt many- if any- of the reviewers actually built a guitar using this book.<br />I gave it 2 stars rather than one because it looks nice. But it's a nightmare to try to build a guitar from.
0141345659|4.0|I bought this book for my son because it was assigned by his school. We always ran to the local bookstores where sometimes we are a little late and the book is sold out. Now we stay home and surf Amazon where its usually cheaper.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|just tried it, on my first book. so far so good. easy navigation. initially hard to find to purchase. enjoy
B005HP2J66|5.0|Cave of the Forgotten Dreams is an astounding film about the greatest art discovery left by prehistoric man. Yes 30,000 years ago primitive man proves to be not unlike modern man with a keen appreciation for his world and artistic ability to capture the beauty and grace of creatures long since extinct, on the canvas of cave walls. Who was or were the artists? Was it the art of Neanderthal or Homosapien? A film that captures the imagination of an all but forgotten world.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I absolutely love these books!  I have not come across anything like it!  It has everything you could want in a book with only a bit a dramatic emphasis lacking.  At times the author gets too caught up in details that do not matter, at least to me, and he starts to lose me for a bit.  However he usually grabs me back in quickly.  The last two have been riddled with way too much unnecessary info and not enough meat.  SPOILERS BELOW so DO NOT READ if you have NOT read or finished this book.....<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />POV/Characters - I love the story and the characters as a whole.  Character you just adore and ones you love to hate and then those you just aren't so sure of.  I enjoy how the author writes the chapters from different character's points of view but I don't care for the time in between them or the volume of characters .  Too many to keep track of and I start to forget where he last left off with them and this is with me reading the books back to back.  I can only imagine how it has been for those that have been on track with the releases.<br /><br />Plot - WOW!  I love the suspense of not really knowing what is coming next but the author should tread carefully with this or he will become too unpredictable by half.  He adds too much of stuff that does not matter and too little sometimes of stuff that does, at least to me.  I feel at times the drama is lacking with that \\"Moment\\" nowhere to be found - death of Ned Stark and how his family reacted, death of Robb & Catelyn and how each family member found out & reacted,  \\"death of Bran & Rickon....... I can't quite put my finger on it but for lack of better description I find the author lacking in emotions which I feel you need in order to keep attached to the story.  I don't really need all the detail of guts & gore.  Having watched the TV show somewhat helps in the dramatic emphasis department.  For example, the Red Wedding was more dramatic on screen than how he wrote it.  This author is NOT lacking in the imagination department though and I love the mystical magical part of it!<br /><br />Deaths-ok as I stated, I love the unpredictability of this author and how you never know what is coming...HOWEVER, if Jon Snow is really dead then I believe he will have become predictable at that point.  Can someone other than the honorable Starks die off?!  Yes a few retched characters have met their demise but not enough in comparison to the \\"good guys\\".  Jon's death would be the worst thing the author could have happen.  Jon is such a wonderful character and he seems way too important to the storyline as a whole that it would be senseless to kill him off.  He is by far the best character in the entire series to date.  Longclaw would be useless?  The importance of the direwolves would really start to go away.  The mystery of who his mother/parents are would seem pointless.  The Author would lose a lot of credibility with me if he is actually dead.  To draw you into a character for so long, make him seem so important and then just kill him like that without finishing his story would be a big waste of the story.  But alas, I do not actually think he is dead.  He will remain one of the most important characters to the end.  I believe the title of the series, A Song of ICE and FIRE, is telling.<br /><br />Length of & between the books - Length of books-GREAT!  Keep the story coming! Length between releases-horrible!  I have just found this story and am now all caught up realizing that I might have to wait a few more years for the next book to come out... really?  This will be torture!<br /><br />BTW-for those of you theorizing that Jon Snow is the son of Lyanna Stark & Rhaegar -- I love it!  Jon Snow is KEY in this story!  And I LOVE the shows choice of actor to portray him! :)<br /><br />Ending - DID NOT LIKE the Jon part - especially since we have to wait so long to find out his true fate.  In general the ending with Danaerys, et all was anticlimactic.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|itnis reallt fun and I enjoy playing it. but in the very beginning you have to wait for it to downlaod twice and that took a long time. and it is a little slow sometimes but fast the other
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app helps me get ideas for my artwork and it gives me a good laugh when i need one :) i can finally post my artwork on something other than facebook!! if you're reading this you should get this app :D
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I got the used first season super cheap and they're in great working condition, not a single problem with quality of merchandise or tattered expectation. Very happy. Already looking for the next season...
B008HK3QII|5.0|Fits like a Glove, beautiful workmanship. Love the black color, pretty dirt resistant.  Lovely red velvet like interior, interior seems to take out the smudges on the glass screen.
B007X1ZQSU|5.0|Great selection from thier glory years. Would have been nice if it have had some liner notes however the packaging is nice and the music is top notch. If you are just getting into Thin Lizzy pick up Dedication-the very best of. This box set is pretty much for someone who loves the band and does'nt have any of thier earlier releases.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I love the Enders Game Quintet.  Can't wait til it comes out on TV.  I hope the rest of the series is just as good!  On to book 3...
0316247545|5.0|The Elements of Harmony: Friendship is Magic: The Official Guidebook is perfect to any Brony fan of FIM. This book is so beautiful and the cover is the same from Twilight Sparkle's book from the very first episode of FIM also the introduction. This book had beautiful pictures, letters to Princess Celestia, all of the episodes, all of the characters, the map of Equestria, the lyrics from some episodes, and many more. As a Brony fan of FIM, this book is a must buy to you, my fellow Brony fans.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This is our third Bruder truck and I'm still in love with Bruder. There is no question about how good Bruder toys look... just look at the pictures online (may be even youtube videos). There is no better looking toy vehicle brand out there - period. Bruder trucks look the best. One concern that I did have initially was that these trucks may not be very durable. But after watching my son bounce these trucks off the walls just for kicks for last 1 year (and try to ride them and fill them with orange juice and transport it across the living room), I can now safely say that Bruder trucks rock! These trucks are assembled such that every time they take a heavy impact, the individual parts (wheels, doors, loader etc) simply pop off without breaking. Then all you need to do is pop them back in! Voila... good as new. German engineering at its best. I have become a HUGE fan of Bruder and will recommend this for every child.
B009CPE424|3.0|It is the 3rd installment of this movie so I didn't have very high expectations but my 8 year old had to have it at her party.  The 8 7-9 year olds at the party lasted about 20 minutes which is about double what I thought they'd last so maybe that says something about the quality.
159562015X|5.0|I have been subject to many assessment tests - either by desire or by force (the worst being a British version of team dynamics and skills that was inflicted upon me).  At first, not all of the strengths resonated. Upon reading the chapter in the book related to the strength, it could not have been more true.  I have recommended this book to those I manage and mentor as well as all of my friends. Leaders should use this in conjunction with Strengths based leadership to understand the outcomes for their team members and leverage those across the team accordingly.
B005EIS5IW|5.0|Perfect for the cat lady in your life.<br />I love this book :)<br />I am sure I will read it every time I need a little pick me up
B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather is always more accurate than the Weather Channel,<br />I don't know if it comes from the same company but Weather Channel's forecast is always lower during the hot days
B008J05EL8|1.0|This app will not download at all. The same thing as all the other people that purchased this.you've spent five bucks and have nothing.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|Works with iPad and Mac in the den or kitchen with receiver in living room, better range than I expected.
1468179993|2.0|Kind of thin on content - what did expect for $10.  It's all about summarizing what others did in their talk. Maybe I'll write a book - How to Write a Book About How To Give a Ted Talk. Watch a few Ted  presentations, better than reading this.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have had this for a few days now, but it does not reliably connect to my laptop via WiFi.  When it does the YouTube feature works great - even in Hi Def.  I do not have Netflix so I cannot speak to that.  The &#34;tab casting&#34; feature is Beta and does not work.  I have plenty of computer power and WiFi speed to meet the requirement, but the video freezes - reliably - after about five seconds while the audio continues just fine.  I'm sure Google is working to get this fixed and also adding more apps.  For $35 it was reasonable to purchase and investigate.  I would like to see it eventually be able to cast anything on my laptop to the Hi Def TV.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|&#34;Fortune favors the brave, dude.&#34;<br /><br />I love this movie.  Big O meets Godzilla.  Friendship, love, and giant f---ing robots.  It's awesome.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|great time killer. The game really impressed me after my wife showed it to me. I now have a schedule when to play diamond dash.
B0074QGGK6|1.0|Very very very basic stuff, kind of a self-help book with no insight. I do not recommend it al all.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Bought this for my grandson.  Second year I have bought it.  Only problem is the issue of them is AFTER Christmas so it is a pre order.  But, it is in time for his birthday in February.  He asked for this gift and loves it.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I LOVED  the man's perspective! It was a nice change! Really good and I have read way too many of this genre!
B00ED44HLC|5.0|One of the best double albums of the year. Every song makes me either want to go out dancing on learn new moves. This is one for the history books.
B004UPANAI|5.0|If you like the xmen movies you will like this.  I hope you enjoy this movie it was worth the rental.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I'm all about value for the dollar, and this is about as good as one can find. What's the difference between this knife and $300 variants? A nicer sheath, maybe, a bit more fit/finish on the scales. As for the blade itself, not much at all. This blade will perform. Recommended!
B005LJK3AC|3.0|The movie had some laughs but I found myself waiting for it to get over.  For the $1.99 rental it was worth it anything more and I would have felt taken.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Stumbled on a few of her songs on Pandora and had to go out of my way to purchase a CD- something that I have not done in almost a year- I ordered both Paradise and Born to Die- Paradise arriving first.  Her voice is a dreamy mixture of Mazzy Star, Jullee Cruise, Norah Jones and Amy Winehouse to name a few.  Blue Velvet is an absolute amazing cover- going back to one of my favorite movies:  Blue Velvet by David Lynch.  I love Lana's looks, lyrics and Americana style that is a far departure from a lot of the commercial crap that is out there today.  I would highly recommend this disc as I look forward to diving more into her music.

B00CT6EJEG|5.0|Perfectly restored and recorded. &#34;This Ripley  is so clear and pure in its restortation it like seeing in long ago in one of those dark palaces called Cinema Theatres. The stoy is perfectly layed until the tell tale climax. Brilliant performances and a haunting film score by Gabriel Yared.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|Loved it. Great YA fiction. Anyone who's going to college or has gone to college and can relate to all those feelings of insecurity, fear of making a fool of yourself, and trying to figure out who you really are should enjoy this. The story is laced with just the right mix of new friends, family drama, and romance,  all set within the first year of a young Nebraska woman's freshman year of college.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Brilliant...Beyond Words can discribe this journey. Beauty Bounds. Excitment excells. Every risk taken in performing the most unique film made this year.
B00F91H15W|3.0|Fell a little flat, but not bad really. Very different piece for Coppola. Emma Watson did a great job nonetheless.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This is my all time favorite book. Even though I have read it three times, I am struck by things each time. The characters  are gripping and the story is timeless.<br />And I don't know about anybody else who reads this book but the count is real!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Absolutely LOVED this book. Not the normal \\"mushy, love-at-first-sight\\" novel expected from Sparks... The mystery and suspense left me always wanting more!! Great twist at the end to tie it all together...<br /><br />The only bad thing about this book is that it's over!<br /><br />If you love Sparks and a nice, easy and suspenseful read, this book is most definitely worth the money.
B008Y212PI|4.0|A very fun game that makes you think. The puzzles are not too hard and there is a hint button for extra help. A very entertaining way to spend a few minutes.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out. I'm glad I watched it again. I got an entirely different perspective. Helen Mirren deserved five academy awards for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth. Movies don't get any better.
0812550706|4.0|I really enjoyed reading \\"Ender's Game,\\" by Orson Scott Card. The story is captivating and well written. Although, Card is Mormon he does not write overly conservative at all. I was surprised there was even cursing in the book at all as well as seems with naked boys wrestling with each other (which I think was symbolism, which to me there was a lot of).<br />There were limited parts that I thought dragged on occasionally, but overall it was a great book. Especially, that Card can write such abstract thoughts and events so clearly for the reader to understand.  I think the most interesting part of the book I had a hard time dealing with was the role of Ender's parents in the novel. I wish they were written differently and had that been the case I think the book would have been potential a stronger book. And the ending was to me a little flat too.<br />I would recommend read the book and I'm interested how they will portray a lot of the scenes into the movie coming out.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|The use of stark lighting and landscape enhance the feel of the movie. At times you may feel lost... it does require your attention to detail and information. Pay attention and you will see the weave and warp of the beautifully crafted fabric of this movie.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Excellent music from the legend himself, Ian Anderson.  It's another &#34;fairy story&#34; as only Ian's talent could imagine and create.
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|Graphics are very good, but controls are very sensitive.  This may make it more realistic, but makes it difficult to achieve the times required to move on.
B000TDGGRY|5.0|I love these books & I'm currently reading & re-reading some in order. I love the characters, the plot, & the scientific miscellany. I usually feel like the world makes a little more (or less) sense upon the conclusion of one of these novels. I recommend it to anyone who has the time & patience to continue through the (albeit rare) slower parts. Especially those who enjoy a little history in their thrillers. Get to the end. You won't be disappointed.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|This is a fun and well done game.  Nothing particularly special about it, but keep going back to it.  The &#34;hidden image&#34; sections are a little tedious, but easy and only come around every 10 levels or so.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is awesome for my kid&quot;s math. He gets math done in a few minutes. Get this app now right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As the author ages, so do his fears and nightmares. A fantastic mix of terror, from things that wait in dark rooms, to the real fears of addiction and regret.  A page turner with an amazing twist at the end. The only thing missing was Lloyd the bartender pouring Danny a drink and reminding him that His credit will always be good at The Overlook Hotel!
0525421033|4.0|I wish this book was a bit longer...so I could get lost in this world. Beautifully written and heartwrenching tale. Remeniscent of The Lovey Bones.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|I know that they are in a different timeline but going back and redoing plot lines gets me to comparing rather than paying attention to the story. Another thing, they are getting carried away with the size of the interiors. The casting is great, especially Spok but get away from the romance crap. I've enjoyed many of the TV episodes far more than this movie. Hoping for better in the future
B00942Y4IY|4.0|Stargate gave us a greater appreciation as to the expansiveness of the universe, and that it is possible to move from one dimension to another. It is a very creative film which is design to help us think outside the box for a moment in time.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I have enjoyed the app, and play it frequently.  It's challenging, but not to the point where it's too difficult.  I rarely have to use a hint.<br /><br />The only issue with the game are the placement of the paintbrush and hammer buttons.  They are too close together, and I'll click the hammer, and it actually thinks I hit the paintbrush button.  Maybe when viewing on a tablet, this isn't an issue, but when using a phone, it becomes more of an issue.  The two icons should be on opposite sides of the screen.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a good app.
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|Well written - plain spoken. I'm still learning but this book made it easier for me to understand. Other books didn't give me the details in a way that &#34;clicked&#34; for me.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I,'ve read all the bad reviews and their wrong. I'm sorry guys but MY kindle fire HD is able to handle all the `mini games` in it. And th  truth I don,t even have the most up-to-date kindle third is their is a new hdx coming out and I can handle this game better than mine.  I know this because my friend has it. I think this game is fun and addicting as ever.  Ever y kindle owner should have it its funny for kids and amusing to adults and you might be surprised how some older folks might take it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I enjoy these episodes over and over. Nathan Fillion and the cast provide a great combination of drama and comedy.  Susan Sullivan and Molly Quinn add another delightful dimension as Castle's mother and daughter.
B0091ICDHU|5.0|WOW 6 stars for this book I absolutely loved it. What a beautiful and powerful book!<br />I devoured it,the story sucks you in and doesn't let you go. Definitely a Must read!!!!
B0002NIRIC|5.0|It was described by some as making the guitar strings seem heavenly.  I would have to concur, best string cleaner/lubricant I've found so far!
B0049U4NQO|5.0|Freaking awesome. Me and my tractor could not be happier. We're on the diet pills and my wife is a tractor
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I really love this app but since i updated it, it keeps crashing..... plz fix i play with my dad and hes getting a bit &quot;nudgy&quot; ;)
034552554X|5.0|My daughter recommend this book to me.  I enjoyed the writing, plot and characters very much.  I also learned quite abit about the meaning of individual flowers that I never knew before.  I am going to lead my Reading Group in this book next winter.  I hope they enjoy it as much as I did!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I chose this book as my second Neil Gaiman novel after reading \\"Coraline,\\" which I found horrifying in the best way. It was nothing like I expected but I found it a thoroughly enjoyable read. Youthful in tone without being childish. Fairly short. A simple, extraordinary story of a troubled boy and the strange family of women who catch him as he falls. Need to know what it's all about? Don't. Just read.
B00F7YHDWC|3.0|Some of the levels are impossible. &quot;Blow to keep the plane up&quot; doesn't work and &quot;Block the blood with your fingers&quot; is impossible if there are more then two holes. It only registers two of your fingers. &quot;Tilt to keep the guy up&quot; is impossible. First off, you have less than half a second to read it so I lost that the first 10 times I saw it, and when I found out what to do, he just keeps falling. Even if I'm able to keep him up for a few seconds, he eventually falls and I lose. &quot;Clean up the puke&quot; is random. I can clean up the same amount of puke multiple times and its chance if I win or lose.
B008J05EL8|3.0|I have it and have never used it and it would be unfair to give it a rating other than okay.  Just not too much you can say about<br />something you have never used.
B0052QXAEK|5.0|Great movie. Read the book and the movie is different but still a good watch.would recommend to anyone who likes a good love story.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|Maybe it's just because I try to use the Jorte Calendar phone app with its cloud service AND the CLOUD SERVICE is where the issues are coming from.  New event entries give me issues.. events wont sync or can't sync.. when it does appear to work, the synchronisation causes duplicate entries which I then can't delete from my local phone calendar.. can't share with other users... Also, when viewing the months around March 2013, the dates and days don't line up correctly (Saturday thinks it's Sunday, etc).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A phenomenal adventure that will both bring you to tears and bring you joy. So much heart, friendship, and strength that will show you to never give up and to carry your self through all of the hardship of life, or The Hunger Games. This is my favorite book and I have suggested it to all of my friends and family. Enjoy!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Does what it's supposed to.  I haven't had any issues with how I use it.  I prefer to use an actual computer to a smartphone but there's nothing I'd change in the current layout for my phone.
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|I bought all three jeager action figures from this brand and each of them is simply stunning. This piece is better in flexibility than Gypsy Danger, it's the second best one among all three of them, in my opinion.
B00D0SA8I8|3.0|I really want to like this program but I don't find it user friendly or terribly accurate.  I keep coming back to it because it's not Google Maps or any of those other major brands, but comparing it to other map providers there are quite a few issues that make it to frustrating.  I originally was going to type examples here but there's just too many and it was getting overly wordy.  If you want to know my thoughts in detail, ask me.
0545615402|5.0|A beautiful series of book, looks simply mazing, also feels great. There are funny notes through out the book, feels like the textbook they use in that magical world full of witchcraft and wonders.
B000005H3R|5.0|Lots of variety of standard jazz played at a a very high performance level. Especially enjoy her duet with Geraldine Basset.
0316227706|4.0|It's incredible as a creativity can transformer simple things in a extraordinary idea.  I loved it!<br />I strongly recommend for all ages.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|Great movie lots of action. I can't wait to see the next transformers they haven't let me down yet. No more megaton. Lol
B005D4YGXK|5.0|The Keen Newport size 12M (American) fits my size 12 foot just fine.  I don't wear socks with these sandals.  The foot bed on this model conforms well to my somewhat flat feet and the sandal is very comfortable overall.  I own several pair of Keen sandals, both the Newport and the Newport2.  Although this footwear is made in China, product quality has been good on all my pairs, the sizing has been consistent, and each pair has held together exceptionally well.  However, the leather uppers seem to be more durable than the nylon uppers.  In my closet, the Keen Newport and Newport2 models are my favorite sandals.
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|It's cute. Too bad I'm not coordinated enough to appreciate this app.  I deleted it the first day I downloaded it.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This series is amazing.  Any fan of the late Republic period or just Ancient Rome in general will find this show very engaging.  It offers a nice balance between the larger-than-life historical figures and the more everyday kind of character while also staying relatively faithful to the histories.  The attention to detail from the costume/set designers is what really makes this series stand out.  Every set-piece and prop looks like it belongs and really creates a realistic atmosphere.  The first season is nearly perfect while the second certainly holds its own.  It was sad that they cancelled it after only two seasons, although historically speaking they didn't have a whole lot to keep going with (and keep the series interesting).  I would definitely reccommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|These little yellow twinkie looking things are cute and definately funny.  Great time waster to use while waiting on Subway to make you a sandwich.
B009HXG9UQ|2.0|Was a very WEIRD movie for me some scenes should not have been in movie ... I might have to watch it again to see if something was in I missed?! Certainly not what I expected  ...
B00DDXJRJG|3.0|This would be useful if I could figure how to operate the controls.  It may be capable of more but needs better instruction documentation.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is so cute. You have to be fast but it really is fun, so is the video. I think that everyone should buy this game.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This is the biggest nothing product I've ever seen.  If you've already got Apple TV or some other way to connect your tablet, phone or PC to your HDTV screen, skip buying this.
B007THA4FI|4.0|The book appears to be set in the early 60s and covers the effect that an &#34;Estate&#34; on the border of a nearby town has on a country village. There are no killings, the plot revolves around a death on the first page and the implications it has on the lives of everyone in the country village and the &#34;Estate&#34;, by creating a Casual Vacancy. I did not give it five stars because it plods along to a fairly expected end with hardly any real surprises or plot twists. It doesn't compare with the Roger Galbraith crime novel. It certainly brought back memories of my post war life when we had a council estate abutted to our upper class village, just round the corner from me, in a green belt village that currently is in the top ten for house prices in England.
B00FGEOA9M|1.0|What a way to BLOW a compelling and intellectually stimulating franchise well thought out in Season's One and Two!! Have seen the first two episodes of season three and if I have to sit through another episode of Claire Danes acting Uber Neurotic and a teenage girl finding her 'sexual' self I may be compelled to put my foot through the television screen!! Hope they get back on track in episode 3 of Season 3 otherwise I'm out of here, let alone pre ordering Season 3.........you've got to be kidding!?!?
B00594XOZU|1.0|Amazon fix the app its getting annoying i have complained way to much to u i know my kindles fine and that my wifis fine
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|Breathtaking imagery both beautiful and not presented with outstanding skill by the team that defined the genre. Time lapse has never been more stunning
B004FRX0MY|3.0|had issues with poor reception on LG phone. Now incompatible with Samsung phone...FRUSTRATION...Now Amazon account still reflects LG phone and won't update with new Samsung info...more FRUSTRATION... Now I can access music from cloud but only on pc ...then must transfer ... more frustration and irritation...
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Excellent distraction which keeps your interest.  Very well done and well acted.  Good stories, some very contemporary with current events.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|She is 7 and she plays this all the time.It is a great traveling game also.Grandma likes to play it too.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed the story and the visual effects.  The 3D was just okay; there was ample opportunities for things in the movie to fly out into the audience but that just didn't happen.  The giants would be pretty scary and disturbing for most small children but I think our 12 and 10 year old grandsons could handle it.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I think I liked Moriarty's other book - 'What Alice Remembered' a bit better but this was still an incredibly strong follow up for me for just reading a second book by this author.  I like the way the stories were interlaced and the way it came to a conclusion that was satisfying.  I also think this is a great book club book that is interstested in exploring the choices the characters made.
B007SOQBCM|1.0|I tried to watch a channel and is say I have to select the watch now...I did then it says what I tried to select don't exist but I went on the computer and was able to watch just fine.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great new direction for the Star Trek enterprise. I love how they've respectively modernized the characters and classic storylines. It's got the eye-candy for action junkies and an intelligent script. Can't wait for the next sequel.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Could not put it down. Get the tissues ready for the last 5 or 6 chapters!  Great ending, different from what I expected, kept sobbing afterwards!!!  Can't wait to see the movie!!!!
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|The complicated story of stone temple pilots has now offically hit a new peak with the release of High Rise. Unlike the previous try of the band minus Scott Weiland, Talk Show, the band chose to keep the name this time and move forward with a different frontman. When they went to pick, they chose the unexpected addition of Chester Bennington of Linkin Park. I was initally appauled at the idea, just didn't think it would work and thought it was actually a joke when it was first announced. Then they released \\"out of time\\", and the world knows now that the band means business. Although I don't think Chester's the vocals are as rich or as deep as Scott's, They suprisingly fit the sound that is STP, and what minimal tone is lost is made up for by the rejuvinated music, a fresh punch of the STP melody and lyrics reminicent of the Tiny Music album.  Only 5 songs though for now, await to hear more from this combination and see if a big tour follows. They change up the pace from the faster and harder \\"out of time\\", to the end and the more melodic tomorrow.  Again, would have wondered how it would have been with Scott, but this will do. Hope to hear more soon.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Loved the story. Writing was excellent. Liked the intertwined theme. Would recommend this book to my friend. Liked the writing style.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Cute fun game..I am on level 29 and it has become very repetitive . Also be VERY  careful tapping away collecting stuff. If you hit a piece of land you don't want or own and you have enough coins or acorns.....ZAP...resources are gone and a piece of land you didn't want is acquired.  There are NO confirmation screens...Also the amount of coins needed for land in later levels is pure ridiculous. Almost forcing u to buy coins which ....oh well..you will see
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The intensity of the the storyline brings you in and your don't know what the main characters are going next.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|This movie was great I am a 27 year old male and even I loved it.  I recommend this to everyone no matter what age.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|What a great cast and what a wonderful story line.  John Malkovich's character is wonderfully eccentric. Of course, Bruce Willis ends up being the hero as he should.  I would really recommend this movie and then watch Red2.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, couldn't stop reading till I finished the book! Now I am in book 3, I love Katniss Ever seen!
B00AEFXKUI|5.0|What can be sexier than Mel Gibson in long hair and wearing a plaid.  This movies has great characters and after the movie, you feel as though you have lost friends.
B00AGOGOLE|3.0|When I need it it says that it can not connect is stupid you can buy it I recOmmend you do not just me
031624662X|3.0|First, ignore the fact I am ranking this three stars.  If you love good science fiction then read this book.  I think it has the potential to be this generations Dune if the author can perfect the sequels that will follow.  The world building is great.  Amazing depth and freshness but at the same time full of interesting mysteries left to the imagination.  The technology of the novel is kept in the background allowing the plot to develop along the interactions of the characters.  The distributed nature of the main character is interesting.  I've seen it used in a few recent works; most notably by Peter Hamilton.  It is a new enough concept to be interesting and exciting.<br /><br />The one area the novel could have used a bit of polish is in its reliance on coincidence.  In interstellar empires with billions of people to run into someone you know from the past is suspect... once is amazing luck... more is policy.  This stretches belief a bit.  this plus the comparatively weak ending are why I am giving the novel three stars instead of four or even five.  I have no doubt that sequels will only be better.<br /><br />I am a poor reviewer but I have been reading science fiction for many decades.  This one is worth it and I wish nothing but success for the author.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Great game. The harder levels really make you think. All puzzles are solvable if you you pay attention to the clues.
0060594896|5.0|What an excellent book for any person striving to be successful at any traditional or home based internet business. Jack Canfield is an expert coach, trainer and leader and makes his lessons very casual and easy to learn.<br /><br />There is only one book or audio book that I enjoyed and am still learning an immense amount of common sense and useable knowledge is Outwitting the Devil, written by Napoleon[[ASIN:0060594896 The Success Principles(TM): How to Get from Where You Are to Where You Want to Be]] Hill in 1938 and still rings very true in present day, IT is a MUST READ or LISTEN for anybody that wants a better lifestyle and understand what is right and wrong in the world today.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Being a longtime Star Trek fan I enjoyed the story line. An old story improved upon. This second modern Star Trek was a smaller movie than the reboot of four years ago and a little less relevant. It skips the relationship factor almost entirely. Nonetheless I thought the film to be enjoyable.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|I love this movie!!!!! Glad to have it in my collection and love all the extras  for the diamond edition
B0091THRCU|5.0|really great product.  I use the little pocket on the side to put a few business cards in and it's a nice fit.
B00EMAGCJM|4.0|Whether you love or hate her at the moment, at least Miley has delivered what she promised:<br />Bangerz is loaded with groove-worthy songs, a unique mix of slow jams, energetic dance pop,<br />trip-hop, and hybrids that fit no known mold. Her familiar country twang also comes through<br />quite often, which makes for an interesting twist. There is not one genre here, there are many - and somehow, eerily, they work.<br /><br />Those who disliked \\"We Can't Stop\\" or \\"Wrecking Ball\\" won't find much (if anything) they like<br />here, but fans of those singles definitely will. Even the songs that will never make it to<br />radio are well-produced; unlike most pop albums, the filler tracks on Bangerz don't feel<br />half-hearted. Each song is lush and layered.<br /><br />One important thing to note is that Bangerz doesn't cater to Top 40 ideal. This is very much a<br />personal album, at times perhaps a little self-indulgent, and it's clear that Miley isn't<br />trying to create perfect pop gems wrapped in a sparkly bow. She is also not making music for<br />tweens anymore - very little of Bangerz is tween-friendly, as parents have (hopefully) figured out by the Explicit label.<br /><br />If the album has a significant weak point, it's in \\"My Darlin'\\" feat. Future, which samples<br />the classic \\"Stand By Me\\" and fails to do anything interesting with it. The much-anticipated<br />\\"SMS\\" feat. Britney Spears isn't a home run, either, but it's just catchy enough to work.<br />Miley claimed she wanted to make an album that people would still be listening to years from now,<br />and though Bangerz is bound to bring even more haters out of the woodwork, it is also bound to accomplish its goal.<br />The album is executed with confidence, and something about that confidence combined with excellent production makes Bangerz a pretty solid release.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Fantastic movie, regardless of if you're a Batman fan. Good, and lengthy, story. Very entertaining for multiple audiences. I would highly recommend this movie to most anyone.
B00BUADSMQ|5.0|If you watch this BD on a 7.1-channel home theater system, I can guarantee that you will &#34;feel&#34; it every time Bruce Willis brings down the neighborhood in this movie!  BOOM!  It is just what I'd expect from a Die Hard flick!  The picture quality is great (1080p) and the sound rocks!  The plot, well--action, action, and more action!  You be the judge!  Hey, it's great fun and for me that's all that counts when I sit down to watch a movie!  Great fun for the price.  If you like action, buy, buy, buy!
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Great character development and clearly multiple interesting, separate (I assume latter to intertwine) storylines. I can see the serie having a lot of depth.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|They should turn the concept of this movie into a TV series.  I think it is just that good!  I find myself watching this movie over and over (like I do with the Star Wars movies).  You can tell this movie was done with a lot of pride and attention to detail--that goes for the crew and the cast both.  And the musical scoring is powerful, in my opinion.  The visual effects--let's just say &#34;eye candy!&#34;  They're so excellent!  All of this is why I keep putting the disc back into my BD player for continued encore performances!!  The picture quality of this BD is stunning!  The sound quality is uber-fantastic if you have a DTS-HD Master Audio A/V receiver with a 7.1-channel surround sound system.  The soundtrack has great lows (the windows in the house vibrate on certain scenes).  I'd recommend this movie to anybody--especially if you like sci-fi and action!  This movie is underrated.  It's a glorious gem!
B00003CXDD|3.0|Maybe it would have been different if I had seen t back in the day, but this movie didn't really do it for me. Had some interesting parts admittedly, but I won't be watching again. The DVD does have some extras if you enjoy the movie
B008D30K7E|2.0|This book is not something I looked forward to picking up every day.  I probably would have long given up on it except that I read it for my book club.  I think the main problem was that I didn't like any of the characters - all completely immoral.<br /><br />I cannot think of anyone who I would like to recommend the book to.
1402726899|5.0|If you're looking for an overview of prenatal yoga or are a newbie, this probably won't be what you want. But if you want to learn more about the topic, keep reading! When I found out I was expecting, one of my concerns was how my yoga practice should be specifically modified. Advice from my teachers and online articles helped, but I wanted was a comprehensive, trustworthy resource to understand WHY I should or shouldn't do a pose. That is this book. There are highly detailed instructions for each pose, what trimester they're appropriate for, and sequences for beginner and advanced yogis in each trimester. There are also thorough chapters on diet, meditation, pranayama and more. As the other reviewers have said, the Iyengar approach does include a lot more props beyond the usual bolster-blanket-block combo. The book does offer alternative ways to do these poses, like using the back of a chair instead of some fancy gymnastics balance beam looking contraption. Or just skip those. This is a wealth of knowledge and I'm betting a lot of prenatal yoga teachers have this in their library. As a side note, I like that the photos are of \\"real life pregnant women\\", not like the prenatal chapters in other books I have with lithe celebrity yogi's who are not pregnant and  wearing very little - I'm sure I'll like the former the bigger I get ;-)
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It works!!! I only got this because my kids lost my other one that came with my Kindle! Connects great with my computer!
B009P1WES6|4.0|Incredible thriller with several twists!!  I couldn't put it down! It holds your attention from first word to the last!
B004OR1X6A|5.0|Listening to the live 2nd CD from Rory Gallagher's Notes from San Francisco makes me feel like I am attending this concert. This is my personal favorite live Rory Gallagher CD because of the outstanding blues rocking versions of the songs on this performance, especially: Follow Me, Bought And Sold, and Tattoo'd Lady, are so energized that I picture myself sitting on a seat at this performance watching it.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed the first CD as well since it has live studio versions of my favorite Rory Gallagher CD Photo Finish [[ASIN:B008KH8XRC Photo Finish]]<br /><br />I can not imagine anyone not being pleased with this CD Rory Gallagher's Notes From San Francisco. I highly recommend this CD to Rory Gallagher music listeners and to those who are interested in hearing his music who have not heard it before. This CD is a musical experience.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|The movie starts as any other. But if you pay attention to things around you and keep moving, you might make it. Zombies, not sure you could call them that, sure died and came back, or did they die?  It was not like the dead raised up but the living changed when bitten. They were very speedy and agile for the dead, and very strong. But as in most Zombie movies it is ready for a sequel.
B001CSQIMI|4.0|Pat Metheny is an outstanding and innovative guitar maestro, but a lot on the ethereal side. Given my penchant for harder rock and edgier artists I am somewhat surprised at my taste for him but I discovered him a long time ago anyway. Seeing him live (twice) gave credence to why. He is masterful with his medium and lyrical in its sound. Try him out.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Bruce Willis, what else is there to say!, except action packed with some good twists throughout movie! This review sucks because forces me to write more then I wanted, &#34;It is my review, not yours&#34;.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|I limped along through this story. It earned enough respect from me that I finished reading the book, but not enough for me to really consider reading the second book.<br /><br />I think that Patrick Rothfuss is an omnibus of fantasy writing technique. He throws out this obligation to a symmetry of threes which is repeated a number of times very early, as if he wants desperately for you to know he's doing it. He tosses out poem after poem right at the beginning, as if to say \\"yeah, I can do Tolkeinesque poetry too, see!\\" I stumbled through these parts thinking, \\"Okay, whatever, try to find your own identity.\\" I was a little put out that he needed to give his lead Rand Al'Thor-ish red hair and a Richard Feynman-like intellect, especially since the vast, encyclopedic knowledge the character has access to seems very ill-earned early on. A caricature of intelligence. I almost put the story down entirely when the character pulls the Law of Cosines out of his ass and, worse, uses it poorly even though the author presents him as using it correctly (yes, there are some people out there who know the Law of Cosines who are reading your books... and worse, some of them can use it in their heads and will check your math on the spot).<br /><br />Some of this was redeemed when the story hit its stride at the University. Kvothe's uncomfortably supernatural intellect ends up getting him in enough trouble that I was willing to keep reading. I liked the early encounters with the character Denna but was ambivalent about the author's continued blunt-fisted attempts to analogize her to the wind. I again almost put the book down when the author began pulling this crappy trick of trying to look erudite by misusing physical principles he clearly pulled out of the ether of google-U (No, gas does not have surface tension... you need to be able to form a surface in order to have tension in it and gases do not form contiguous enough structures, even if they do interact with themselves. I'll grant you viscosity, because they do have viscosity as they flow, but it's tiny and based upon bumping into themselves.) I would hold this garbage up as an example of what authors should not do if they want to hold a high-level audience; if you start using real things and phenomena in your stories, you'd better understand what they are and how they work because getting that wrong is going to cost you with people who know what these things are. And the mistake might be egregious enough to overshadow anything you've done correctly... the more times you try to fake it, the more likely you'll screw it up and people remember screw ups first.<br /><br />There was a long section where the author takes a major sidetrack away from the University in an attempt to regress back to what he intends to be the overarching plot of his series, I was happy with some elements here, but I was disillusioned that the only truly awesome climax of the book came ten percent before the actual end of the book and had no really clear effect on the story after that point. The character's long awaited clear use of \\"naming\\" after that was anticlimactic.<br /><br />While I know that there's an attempt at ingenuity with the story-within-a-story structure, the pattern reminded me a bit too much of Assassin's Creed, but without the clear direction. Some people will like this complexity and might feel that it brought greater connection between what Rothfuss was writing about at that moment and where the series may eventually go, but I thought it distracted from the pacing and flattened critical moments. It referred me too clearly to my impressions of Assassin's Creed and I felt instantly that it was not very creative. It also felt like some of it was added to try to respond to editorial complaints about story screw-ups in certain early sections, which was also distracting to me. As such, the plotting is very episodic and disconnected and meandering and does not feel tightly focused, which is more my preference in a story. My early impression of the character was one of dislike, which did not help. This work struck me as very derivative and written by someone who has spent a monumental amount of time workshopping and inbreeding his craft and learning what the \\"expectations\\" of the Fantasy genre are and is desperate to become a successful writer but lacks the something-something to really stand apart. Maybe obsessively hard work does get you someplace, but it may deposit you somewhere at 50th percentile or lower when compared to true greatness, like Tolkein or Robert Jordan or GRR Martin. I eked out the conclusion of book one, but I'm not going to pick up book two --he had his chance.<br /><br />(Written later: Having allowed the book to sit for a week since I finished reading it, I'm thinking this response is a little scathing. I still won't read book two, but I think it possible that people with less of my background may find this story more appealing than I did. My feelings on finishing this story were of betrayal of trust: I shelled out money for this book and it periodically showed elements that promised much more than I feel that I got. I kept reading it and kept limping through, kept hoping that this snappy piece of character interplay would lead to something to truly infect me. And it never happened. I limped through some 700 pages of typical hoping to see something I would fall in love with, but it never happened. If I'd ended after 50 pages, I would feel less betrayed and less negative, but I slogged through the whole thing, finding just enough warts to keep me from enjoying the experience. It certainly isn't the author's fault that the book is a poor fit for me in particular. You may see this in what I've written above.)
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Why I choose this rating?  because is a very good product.<br />What I like or dislike?  I like everything.<br />I recommend this product to everybody.

B00F2362IE|5.0|What a great combination of a rooftop run with a side-scrolling fighter! Brings me back to my childhood. The most fun I've had on my Kindle yet! Highly highly recommended!
B00FN811SY|5.0|Awson,  A blessing from Jehovah, all the beautiful features, love it.  Can't put it down.  Everyone should have a copy of the new bible.
B00EP0KBXM|2.0|I'm sorry to say I paid full price to see this movie in the theater. I felt robbed. I love science fiction and I am a Will Smith fan so what could go wrong? Everything. This movie was slow and the characters were not likable. The acting was horrendous and the plot....was there a plot, I can't remember I was so bored. I'm sorry to say I will never get that hour and a half of my life back. I'm giving it two stars because the special effects were decent.
B003ZSI9YI|5.0|With his own edge,he brings back the essence of several of the best artists of the era. For fans and collectors.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I respect the hell out of Stephen King, but could never really get into his writing.  I loved the TV Miniseries for the Shining and actually enjoy it MORE than the movie, especially knowing it's more loyal to the book.  So when I came across the sample for Doctor Sleep, I had a good reference point and an open mind.<br /><br />This book not only blew away my expectations, it fulfilled expectations I didn't even know I had.  The tone for Doctor Sleep is very much the opposite of The Shining, with triumph and intrigue replacing fear and despair.  As I say in the title of the review, imagine if Neil Gaiman had written the HBO series Carnivale, and you'll start to understand where this book could and does go.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I read the book in a couple days; it's a fun and easy read.  Pam Grout's style of writing is witty and funny and right to the point.  I did not try all the experiments; I tried 6 out of the 9, and 4 out of the 6 that I tried worked out exactly the way they were supposed to, in spite of the fact that in the back of my mind I thought they wouldn't  ;)  It's fun to do the experiments because when they work out the way they should it's freaky!!!  The experiments are just more (concrete) proof how much your thoughts really can affect your life.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show! I even have my boyfriend hooked on it now...  The sharp humor and sarcastic wittiness are so much fun!  The characters play extremely well off of each other and the script is very well-written.  More, please!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  There is a big twist and it really makes you think.  Everyone in our book club like it and it made for an interesting discussion.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|I loved reading the first book from the author in this series, and this second book did not disappoint. Bravo!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have now downloaded this app on my iPhone and iPad (and my Kindle) so I have it wherever I go. Lots of times in a Bible Study it is good to look at the same passage using different versions of the Bible and with this app you have most all of them.

B00DJWV11I|4.0|it took a little bit to get into it, but in the end it was worth it. love the story
B008YU0AOE|3.0|This app is pretty good but could be better It doesn't have all the buttons that an actual scientific calculater has but overall it os a pretty good app.  Worth the time to install:)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I love a good story!  This one is about a mysterious town that will keep you interested all the way through.  Great job Blake Crouch!  Love the fact that you also enjoyed Twin Peaks!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Loved it! The cast especially! Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto make the perfect Kirk/Spock match. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect villain!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|since the most recent upgrade,  this app keeps giving me messages saying it is having troubles with my newsfeed. it won't let me set newsfeed to most recent...only the popular setting. frustrating to say the least,  since I had it working perfectly fine before.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game 5 STARS! Lol omg! You have to download it , it's freaking addicting .. I absolutely recommend people to download this game (:
B00DL7TSAM|4.0|Bought THIS IS IT...got this to go with it.. Great addition to the experience of doing MJ sharing with kids.. Recommend this for a fun rainy day thing to share/dance & be silly with a Granddaughter...
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Being a long time trekkie, I am amazed how easy it was to accept these new actors in their roles.  The characterizations were so perfect.  Also, these two new movies were able to use a new timeline to make any outcome a surprise, yet interweaving the old plots from episodes past....ie Khan.  The special effects are amazing as well.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|Watched this on TV Special & had to buy one for Moi & one for my daughter.. This was her & her brothers era.. Fun to dance to, watch & great memories of dancing with my kids....
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The book is wonderfully written and is a must read for anyone interested in the shaping of America.  I knew the ending but I cried nonetheless for what could have been.
B00AQN09VQ|5.0|This is currently the best comedy on TV! I like how the creators/writers of the show keep it funny yet the characters develop and move forward with each season. It's very well written. The DVD/BR collection all work in my Blu-ray player and each season has a gag reel and behind the scenes extras. The packaging is compact and doesn't take up a lot of space.
B00D3LA71K|2.0|The movie frankly is boring. Most of the time it spends on pushing through some very basic morals, chewing them down to the state of baby food: stealing is bad, marriage is good, divorce affects children.... This is not a drama or action movie, this is something entirely different and probably should be aimed at middle school audience. I found the movie boring.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|The New Years Eve sound board mix is worth the price alone.  Add the 5.1 surround disk and the remaster of the original and the book that it comes in and you have a great package.<br /><br />I have always preferred this show to &#34;Last Waltz&#34; because of the horns in second set
B000GWE44U|5.0|This movie is a true work of art.  It has the gamut of human emotions; fear, humor, tension, anger, sadness.  It is incredibly beautiful and haunting.  While I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, what is most amazing is how absorbed I still become while watching, and I have seen it at least 20 times.<br /><br />I feel sad when people belittle Shelley Duvall's performance, as it is key to making the movie a success.  Some viewers want her to be a more assertive, modern woman.  That would not have worked.  She finds the strength within herself to do what needs to be done, and is in fact quite heroic, despite her mousy nature.  Jack really isn't crazy at the start, Nicholson just LOOKS crazy.  And he is definitely supposed to have some demons. An overly-sympathetic Jack would not have been interesting.  The ambivalence about what's real and what's imagined is a strength of the movie (and there is plenty shown to make the viewer aware that not everything, if anything, is imaginary) There are many classic moments in this movie, but nothing beats \\"Gimme the bat....\\"<br /><br />King purists can watch a (dreadful) version starring Rebecca deMornay and Stephen Weber.  King praised this version as more faithful to his books.  Honestly, none of the good King adaptations followed the book (Shining, Carrie and Misery being the three best) and those that did have been mediocre to bad.<br /><br />I never thought any movie would surpass Jaws as my all-time favorite, but the Shining is the best movie I've ever seen! (and I'm almost 50)
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|This is worth a listen for any fan of Stills or Kenny Wayne Shepard.  Tasty licks and good interpretations of some songs fit well with the originals
B00BEIYMIS|2.0|Seriously, I was so disappointed by this movie.  I heard so much about it, especially how it was genuinely scary without a lot of gore or cheap scares.  However, it is absurd.  There is a lot of unintentionally hilarous dialogue from the Warrens.  Once the demonic possession starts, things really go downhill.  I am tempted to give this one star, but I guess it isnt that bad... well, it is pretty bad.  Don't believe the hype, this one is boring and corny.

B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thought it was great.  thoughtful treatment of a difficult subject.  This was October's selection for our book club, and no negative reviews at all.  Something of a rariety for our group.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is about Nazi Germany and holocaust written in a different perspective from other books of this kind. It is also interesting that the narrator is death. It is simply beautiful and heartwarming. Definitely recommend it !

B008IJT0CE|5.0|great for bedtime!  I am so very happy with this app. lots of sounds to choose from and I love that you can blend them together and select each sounds volume Individually in the mix&lt;3
0316204366|3.0|On the positive, I will say that the book is thoroughly engaging and worth reading. He provides some fascinating class studies that give you some serious food for thought.<br /><br />With that being said, the entire tone of the book takes on the air of a billionaire playboy descending upon a construction site and muttering to himself \\"This work thing is rather fascinating. I should maybe try that sometime.\\"<br />It is abundantly clear that the author has never seriously struggled with any major kind of disadvantage, and has little personal appreciation for just how easy it is to become a statistic rather than a success story.<br /><br />I think we can all agree that if you, as a society, force your children to engage in duels to the death as a trial of passage into adulthood, the survivors will likely become extraordinary warriors. I would also hope that we can all agree that such a practice is incredibly inhumane, and should be discouraged. Gladwell's analysis reminds me of someone marvelling  at the strength of the surviving children, without condemning the practice of forcing them to duel to the death with their peers in the first place.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|A little slow but methodical.  I enjoy the genre so it didn't bother me.  If you like sci-fi it's a good one to watch.
B00C1BV9Z6|5.0|How could you not love this movie. My 7 yr old watched it for the first time and she loved it!<br />The quality and sound is great!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Great movie for music lovers. Wonderful acting. Maggie Smith is so good, and so are the other actors.  I really enjoyed this movie.
B00DW5IM9Q|2.0|After reading all of these great reviews of this album I picked it up to find the reviews better than the music.When Mr Dylan is on his form he's one of the best songwriters around.Whens he's not he's a &#34;song and dance man&#34; as he has named himself in Scorcesses's bio on him.There are some gems on the album,and it's interesting to see some of the choices of artists that he decided to cover from back in his old days : Tom Paxton,& Eric Anderson.But, there is a bunch of stuff that's just ok,on this compilation,and there are one or two do-overs as well.I was a bit underwhelmed.This is for folks who must have the Entire Bob Collection.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|So sad.  This book could not live up to what everyone said!  Not shocking . And easy  to guess what is next.  Don't wast up our time or money!
B00D7JGL36|5.0|For folks who listen to Country Music the title spells it our for you.There are people who like Nashville, some who like Texas,and others who love that Bakersfield Sound.Now me; I love Buck and Haggard, and their songs. Vince Gill has a great voice and does vocal justice to the sound and the material.But to be candid, I bought the CD because 1/2 of the sound on this CD is Paul Franklin, who has been left unfettered to play his gluteous max off.The pedal steel playing on this cd is up front ,in your face, in your ears,and melts in your mind.Mr Franklin is up there with the Steel Guitar Greats,and displays his chops with grace, fluidity,and a sense of ease.A wonderful album to llsten to ,and listen to,and listen to.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Easy read that was not shocking or hard to know where it was going.  Not impressed at all. A waste of my time and money.
B002NNA9N0|3.0|An interesting movie, great cinematography, amazing acting from some very big names, but the dialogue's strength hinged on stringing together expletives then shooting them at each character for an effect that left the movie overdone and heavy handed. Almost a great movie, but missed the mark.
B009LDCXQQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite series, so I own all 8 seasons and love them all.  Can't wait for Season 9.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|thank you Amazon and Kindle to make our lives so much easier. I am becoming a book worm LOL. GREAT
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|love that can change letter color, page color, size of lettering. cool looking memo pads that make grouping info fun, pretty & easy. . . and its free  :-D
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I read the first four chapters before getting a copy of the full novel.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this book.  I've heard quite a bit of hatred about it, especially since it won the Hugo, and I was expecting it to be very silly.  There were parts of it that didn't make sense, but on the whole it was delightful, and I also found it to be excellent social commentary.
0345535421|2.0|I thought this was a bigger soft cover / paperback book when I ordered it.  I do not like the size.  Thinking about returning it for the larger version if they you still have them.  I ordered the first Game of Thrones book through you and it was the size I wanted.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read!!!!!! Even adults should read this!!! It is a great book to read
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Again, Mr. King, you did it again! Not since I read the unabridged version of the Stand have I been so engrossed in your book that I couldn't put it down. Sadly, it took me only 6 days to read it, and like a truly good movie, I hated to be done. Thank you for ALWAYS writing the best!
B008E6I1K8|5.0|Extremely useful. Full of examples, advice, explanations. Well written, very well formatted. Extremely useful. Did I say that already? Let me repeat, extremely useful! But seriously, I use it all the time. Whether I want to learn new thing or just refresh my knowledge or I need some quick reference, this is where I mostly go. Sure you can find lots of stuff in the internet but here you have the quality assurance that you don't have online. Very good book for someone who's not all knowing pro but uses the language on a daily basis.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a fun game a. Bit more challenging then some of the other games. I always liked hidden object games with a story line
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Get ready by grabbing your tissues. Men, be careful, you'll cry too.  Its funny and very heartwarming!  A true story.
0143124544|5.0|Upon recommendation from the female relatives of a co-worker, I bought this book.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.  Warm, heart-wrenching, real.  Hope that a movie is made from it, but that they don't butcher it!  The Europeans should make it, not the Americans.  LOL
1416595236|5.0|I had a hard time putting it down.  Thoroughly enjoyed the twists and turns and can't wait to start the next one in the series.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|If you like the stage version, own this. The live recording style of film making in this movie is superb. Very moving.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This sequel to JJ Abrams' reboot Star Trek (2009) did not disappoint. The acting was good (especially Cumberbatch), the story-line was thought-provoking and there was plenty of action.<br /><br />Perhaps newer fans of the 2009 movie will enjoy it more than fans of the Shatner movies will. But I am a fan of both and I think Abrams and the new set of actors do the franchise justice. In my opinion, this is the best Star Trek movie made to date.
0307463745|4.0|A refreshing insight into the world of 37Signals. Don't buy this book looking for amazingly in-depth insights or a wonderful new in depth business theory. Rather, buy it to dip into and out of when you need a glass of ice cold water in the face to cut through the generic haze of corporate BS. Common sense in book form - also found on the blog. Keep it to hand when you find yourself becoming too \\"professional\\".
B008JFUUIA|4.0|fun da chool musical a quite enjoyable timee  watching the action. a little slow to b begin withgood good finishfinish
B00992CF6W|5.0|AWESOME APP.I love the external server capture the flag.My minecraft name is Tobygames.If you find me then your In luck.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is so easy and convenient! Never downloaded an ebook to my Ipad before but now I will all the time. I was so worried it wouldn't download where I wanted to go. (me not being very tech savy these days) Thank you! Books so far are amazing!
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|This is the best album Halestorm has ever made.I honestly,love every song on this album!My personal favorite is:<br />Break In,Here's To Us and Mz Hyde.I haven't listened to rock music in awhile with a female lead in a rock band in awhile.I usually listen to Evanescence,but these guys are amazing and so talented!
B004SIMNF0|5.0|Since I purchased this product, I have gone on several vacations and find it to be absolutely wonderful.  If you have a DSL R with a battery pack and a substantial lens you almost certainly know the feeling of being irritated with that giant piece of equipment hanging around your neck or inaccessible in a backpack.<br /><br />This product is substantial and makes it possible to go hiking and literally forget about your camera until it's needed.  (Well it might not be quite that transparent but it's close)<br /><br />you know the saying, \\"quality is remembered long after price is forgotten\\"?  This is one of those things - I had to think a little bit about paying 100 and some odd dollars for this outfit but every hour that I have worn it and not cursed the fact that I had a clunky camera hanging around my neck has been worth at least $10 and there have been a bunch of them.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|This is Halestorm's Debut album.There are a few songs I like,but it's not as good as The Strange Case Of.....It's still very good!The lead singer's voice Lzzy Hale.Is amazing!Also,her brother Arejay Hale is in this band and he's the drummer.They are so talented!My favorite songs on this album are:  Familiar Taste Of Poison,It's Not You and I Get Off.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|A great ending book to a great series.  Sanderson did a good job on the these last three (with notes/help/dialogue from Jordan).
1439156816|5.0|I've had this book on my wishlist for a while. I wanted it but not badly enough to just purchase it right away. Maybe I'd wait until I needed a few extra dollars on another order and then I'd get free shipping. I was curious to read it but not drooling, \\"I can't wait to get my hands on it\\" wanting it. I'm not a huge Stephen King fan but I will devour any good book on writing I can get my hands on. Oh my gosh! Now I'm kicking myself for waiting so long.<br /><br />I've read a lot of books about the craft but this one really got to me. I don't know if I just needed to hear some of these things a million and one times before they soaked in or if its the way they are presented in this book. Mr. King does a fabulous job of speaking to you as he explains simply how to write. I loved the background on his life and his wonderful stories about his life. Each story illustrated what he was trying to tell the reader. Instead of telling, he showed. How refreshing to practice what you preach in a book about writing.<br /><br />I haven't finished the book yet, but I will soon. For once I'm not wanting to rush to get to the end of the book - I want to savor each and every morsel of this delicious read. Yes, I've learned a lot about writing. And I've learned that I AM a Stephen King fan, too! Thank you Mr. King for such a marvelous gift. How amazing it would be to sit and talk to you about the writing. This book will have to serve as the next best thing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I think this game is fun because it tells you what you would have to do if you had a real horsebut it isn't the same as having a real horse
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|The acting was ok, but the storyline was a bit boring. There was nothing there to really captivate your attention!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I am really glad I finally decided to pay for this. A bit expensive but can't beat some old school FF. Keep it coming square enix. Also a FF from the 7-9 era would be REEEEALLY nice! You know people want it.
1847946240|5.0|Fantastic book with really interesting stories and research. At times the term 'habit' seems a bit of a stretch to define what is probably more like 'decision making' or 'addiction' but that's not too worrying when the book is taken as a whole...and when you acknowledge that it's not an academic text but rather an interesting read by a very informed journalist. I found it a very enjoyable book, read it very quickly and have recommended it to many people as it's something that's relevant and accessible to all, but has just enough research and rigor that it satisfies the nerdier among us.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|At this time it has completed the job that I purchased it for, if it holds up as well as the one that came<br /><br />with my kindle, I will be quite satisfied.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a fascinatingly passionate book. Give me more of christian gray and Anastasia. I read the book in 2 days I couldn't put it down
B009LOJK1Q|5.0|Really enjoyed finding out what happened to Danny after the Overlook incident. Liked the new characters, and was a very easy & compelling read. Definitely worth the purchase.
1401938906|5.0|LOVE it!  The experiments are fun and easy to follow, the insights gives you &#34;ah-ha&#34; moments, overall it's a great book.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Glad to see Christian start to love and hope he will learn to love himself.  Still feeling sadness at the pain he is in
B008EKOIN8|4.0|After reading this book I decided to start baking my own bread. After a couple of missteps, I now look forward to my weekly baking adventure. I think pickles are next.
B00633W614|4.0|I just love the Saga type book, it just keeps on going with all sorts of yummy situations. I wish it would have another book as a sequel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game.  Very addictive.  You don't have to be a kid to enjoy this game.  They need to make a movie with just these guys.
1455869899|5.0|I have never felt compelled to write a book review, until the fault in our stars.  It is absolutely brilliant and beautifully written.  I couldn't put it down and cried on and off during the entire book.  With 25% of the book left to read, i had a constant stream of tears till the end.
1419705644|5.0|Nuff said.  This book's amazing.  If you love Adventure Time you'll love this book-the artwork and the style are perfect.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|My kids LOVED it. They have watched over and over again! I have 3 girls, ages 8, 6, and 4….Its definitely watchable as an adult. Worth the purchase. They cant scratch it but they can watch it whenever they want!
B008Y5FNL4|5.0|Very good movie a classic. Stands up to the test of time and is still good today. Amazing cast also
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I thought it came with a blooper reel but I couldn't find it. Either way, the movie is brilliant. I am a bit disappointed at the unnecessary nudity of Doctor Marcus, and at the still ever abundant light flares but other than that, this is quite an interesting mirror-verse Star Trek.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Story of course is a classic. Loved this movie, acting, singing, everything. I highly recommend it. Gerard Butler was great.
B00F2P8ZDC|4.0|Great movie my daughter have been waiting for but it would be better to have the chance to get the digital copy directly to her tablet so she won't need to be connected all the time to enjoy her movie.
B00CHVIPP2|4.0|This is a great movie for kids and the entire movie. My 5 yo son loved the Belt toy (sloth).
B009UKUGXC|4.0|It is amazing to see that so many nearly disjoint ideas of maths came together, against so many odds, to help proving the theorem. Fermat's Last Theorem is among the victories of mind over matter! The book read like a thriller in that the development and the suspense keeps one glued to the book. One feels part of the glory of science is due to the great ability for human beings to come together, communicate and organize. The happiness is there in that in proving Fermat's Last Theorem so many people from different parts of the globe contributed.
0920668364|5.0|I had never read this book before but a colleague recommended for my new grandson.  I love the book and I was very pleased with the timely shipment.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|so far so good  does require decent hard ware to work  its not gonna  get ur iphone to concert hall
B008Y212PI|5.0|Starts simple so you have time to develop your logic. But then to get the bonus section you have to review it here or like on Facebook. Probably why there's so many reviews but I do enjoy the app.
1416583432|1.0|I read a review by who knows whom just raving about this book.  It is true that there are some interesting and insightful tidbits here, but they could have been conveyed in less than half the 300 pages of this tome.  The author tries to write in a homely style, but just comes across as being obtuse.  At times the reading was a chore, hoping that on the next page the author would actually get around to what she wanted to say.  This very rarely happens in this book.<br /><br />If you really want to understand your dog, try .

B00FJTYDKK|5.0|My 4yr old son and I were locked in from beginning to end. We absolutely loved The Croods! Great family movie...
B000SX9NAC|5.0|The CD version of \\"Someone Great\\" is nearly twice as long as the cool official video and has more of the intro you hear in the commercial.  Get the whole CD, lot of great songs.  Disco and New Wave from late 70's influenced. Other favorites are \\"Time to Get Away\\" and \\"North American Scum\\". Highly recommended!
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|It so awesome this app does everything if you enjoy any kind of  music this is the radio you want
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|Many negative reviews of this movie have struck me as little more than parroting of so-called expert opinions, and not at all thoughtful. In truth, there were elements that could have been done better--accents were inconsistent and distracting, for one.  Otherwise, I thought it was a good coming-of-age story acted believably by this father and son duo. I have five sons, and I am thrilled to have an option for them that is free of sex and cursing, where there is a strong father image, and where the young main character displays fortitude, efficacy, a sense of duty, and a deep love for and commitment to his family.<br /><br />12/14/13: Watched again with my boys, ranging in age from 9 to 17. They all loved it.
B00DURHYWC|5.0|I am glad I preordered this cd.  Pink Martini's music and songs cheer me up.  Overall this recording is a winner!  Storm Large is a wonderful addition to an already great group.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|The early portions of the book read like history and the grip of the novel was delayed long enough to propel the reader through the thicket of fiction
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Play with the settings to get all the background apps to close. Phone runs faster when everything is turned off
B000085RPU|2.0|I didnt realize it was Region 2 when I ordered it and it wont play in my xbox.  So now if I want to return it I have to pay to ship it back to england.. and that will cost me more than I paid for the movie itself.
0765365278|5.0|Simply put, this is the best novel to hit the fantasy genre in years. Everything Sanderson writes is great, but this particular book was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. I'd give it 1E99 stars out of 5 if I could. If you enjoy fantasy and haven't picked this up yet do it. Immediately.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|when I first got this game it was awesome then it wasent awesome it was crasy cool cause I love angry birds star wars.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Great movie for the family.  Funny and entertaining. One of the better animated movies to come out in the last few years.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Very different but also very interesting book about being not the same as others.  Intriguing  how the author has got inside the mind of the protagonist. I enjoyed reading this book. There are some great quotes.
B00005AWMF|5.0|CD sound quality is great. Great relaxing music for driving or just sitting around the house. I would recommend it.
B00CATSONE|4.0|The worse thing about this book is that there isn't more of it.  It's well written, poetic, and gave me a whole new appreciation for the genius of Nikola Tesla. Give it a read!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun yet challenging.  Keeps my son busy on errands and appointments.  I wish there were more levels to the game.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Trained a little bit with the team guys and Force guys, loved it.  Reading the book gave me a flash back to the gulf.  My condolences to the family.
B00BG5CXGM|3.0|Like the color, and easily snugs in. Feels very nice in the hand.<br /><br />But,<br />The cutout that the case provides for the mute switch is too small for my fingers.. I have to now grow nails on my pinky to toggle on/off the switch.<br /><br />Also, cant use my amazon basics charger, nor the apple 30-pin to 8-pin adapter... Thinking to cut the bottom part to make way.
1476727651|5.0|Maybe I belong in the King Addicts Anonymous meeting down the hall, but I loved this book. I highly recommend even the most Constant Reader go back and read \\"The Shining\\" again before this book. If, like me, you were a kid when you last read it, you will find a very different narrative this time. The book and the original movie had been fused in my mind and it was all about the ghosties. Now, as a mother, the horror was all about what happens when you can't protect your kid. I think re-reading \\"The Shining\\" first greatly enhanced my \\"Doctor Sleep\\" experience.<br /><br />I understand some of the negativity in the reviews because people are disappointed that Danny picked up the bottle. In a perfect world, we'd all learn from our parents' mistakes. For those who found the AA talk tiresome, remember that the whole premise of the book came from King imagining how Jack might have turned out if he had found AA, all other things being equal. AA is central to the story for that reason. There are those who are highly repulsed by AA and if you're one of them, you'll be turned off by the references. If you know someone who was saved by AA, you'll nod your head and smile.<br /><br />I will say that I have read everything King has published on the wide market. No, I don't own \\"My Pretty Pony\\" in the giant, stainless steel binding with a digital clock in the front, but just short of that, I'm a King nut. I don't love everything he writes without exception. I hated \\"Insomnia\\" as much as the next guy. \\"Doctor Sleep\\" is not better than \\"The Shining\\" but it is AS good, in a different way. This book is satisfying and runs deep. I am unashamed to say I devoured this in two days and cried at the end.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Pop some corn, suspend disbelief, sit back and enjoy. The only downside was the constant &#34;loading&#34; pauses. Strange is that it only happens on Amazon this frequently.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Absolutely amazing................love love love.  Exceeded my expectations.  My I Pad, I Phone and Kindle are all hooked up to E Print as well as both my computers.  I can't believe I can print from anywhere now.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Enjoyed all the story lines.  Thought the husband who thought he was in love with wife's cousins was a wimp.
B000687M48|5.0|I just purchased this item and I love it only it was missing the dvd. I listened to it on loop even! Just please be careful who you buy from. Don't make the same mistake that I did.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|I never expected this movie to be this good!  Great cast, great acting and a great period piece if you like movies from this era which I enjoy.  I highly recommend this movie....it was a pleasant surprise!
B008Y212PI|4.0|I have never really played games like this but I was willing to try this one and I as not disappointed in any way.  I could hardly put it down the first night I played it.  Such a wonderful game.
B008D37J6O|1.0|Would not work on my kindle. So I ended up deleting it off of my kindle. There was no need for it. So use your on discretion.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It used to be the best thing too,text my friends on but now I can't even sign in. I hope there gonna fix this up
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is so easy to use and I especially like the tax calculator. By simply putting in the amount of the sale + then the amount of the tax, tap the percent sign and you see the calculated amount at the top. Tap = and you see the total sale!  Great for figuring out tips and was particularly helpful at a recent sale we had at church where we were required to charge tax. Awesome!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|I greatly enjoyed the original series.<br />So when I first watched this pre-quell on cable I knew I had to add it to my collection.<br />The story before the arrival of Spartacus is well told & the acting excellent.<br />Enjoy.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I first saw this movie in a small rural movie theater. I was moved by the story and the actors. Both leading ladies say thousands of words just by the expressions on their faces. The cinematic views are impressive and unintrusive.
B0072OFM28|5.0|I will miss Andy Whitfield like all the fans of the series.<br />But Liam McIntyre, who I met at this year's DragonCon, does an excellent job filling his sandals.<br />The story continues & you never get bored.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dont pay attention to people who say it loses \\"steam\\" half way through. Those folks simply get sick of the story after we find out what Dan Torrance had been up too. The rest of the book is equally entertaining, with a great epic battle to cap things off. Wonderful, read it in 2 days (wish it were longer).
B00B52F278|5.0|The conclusion of the series does not disappoint & the cast delivers to the bitter end.<br />I recommend the entire series without hesitation.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|My daughter, 2 years old, play it a lot. Is a good game I recommend. I don't have more to say, but Amazon says that I need to put more words.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|...falling to the eventual demise of poor decision making by large movie houses that fail to see a good thing when they have one.<br /><br />That, however, was to the benefit of all Firefly followers around the world, as it allowed Mr Joss Whedon to create and produce this very entertaining movie as a means of bringing the short lived series to a close.  The series, as many know, was cancelled by a particular production house, because viewership wasn't what they expected.  Really?  The tons of fans would beg to differ.  They allowed some fairly aweful stuff to stay on television during the same period and yet this series was canned.  Makes no sense...<br /><br />...but alas, this is about the movie Serenity, not the overall issues with the franchise that singlehandedly killed it.  Serenity picks up where Firefly left off - sort of.  We finally learn about River's amazing skill set.  We see the &#34;man&#34; moving in to catch, return or kill her to prevent the secret from getting out - and we see human perseverance at its finest...or as it is well put in the film - &#34;can't stop the signal.&#34;<br /><br />That was the true beauty of this series/movie.  Not the sci-fi/western mix (which was an awesome concept btw), but the fact that this crew of &#34;outlaws&#34; did whatever it took to survive and did it without hurting innocent people.  Sure a few laws were broken, but when the laws are designed to make anything and everything you want to do illegal, then the people will revolt.  Besides, the characters, even the Companion, were all written and designed to be good people with morals, integrity, and conviction.  From all walks of life - preacher, companion, doctor, veteren, and gun nut - this movie had it all.<br /><br />And then, there is River - the main purpose behind this ragtag band of merry spacefarers travels through the universe (she's the girl on the cover art).  She is a young, gifted girl who was taken from her home by the corporation to exploit her mental capacity and refine her into a weapon - well, like all good weapons, sometimes they backfire, especially when mishandled.  And River puts that premise forward in some of the best possible ways during this movie.  Without spoiling anything - just wait for the final fight scene that she is in.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was a great conclusion to an excellent series that ended far, far too early.  The likelihood of this series coming back, especially with Joss Whedon's schedule (not to mention all the actors) is infinitesimally small, but that's all that most Browncoats (true fans of this series - and also the name of the resistance forces during the &#34;Great War&#34;) need to carry on...a little hope can go a long way.  Watch the movie - stream the movie - borrow the movie...or simply buy it from here.  If you like sci-fi or even westerns...you'll enjoy this one!ntal capacity and refine her into a weapon - well, like all good weapons, sometimes they backfire, especially when mishandled.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|I am convinced Nicolas Sparks starts each book by imagining different ways to get women to cry.  This novel has the same tear jerker traps as the other ones although not as sappy as some of the others.  While the writing is techinically good the story seems a little tired and over done.  It was a very quick read.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft pocket edition is a great improvement from minecraft computer edition. Mainly because of the cost, but it's not as bloody and killer as the pc edition.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I tried to keep an open mind as I read this book, aware that the reviews were not great when it first came out.  I thought the book was well written, almost too well written.  The descriptions are very detailed and lyrical but at times seem to slow the story down as it plodded towards the conclusion.  In the end I thought it was just ok - a rather depressing read that I will soon forget.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Absolutely beautiful. Kindle fits perfectly and is completely protected. I have received so many compliments on this cover. I highly recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful ! I love having the Holy Bible at my fingertips . Easy to use and understand. Would recommend to anyone
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This was the best book of the series.  Makes one wish the author was granted more time on earth as he was getting better at his craft.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|We rented this movie because of the cast--Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson...but the screenwriting was corny and none of the characters were likeable.  The four horsemen were particularly immature and annoying.  Not much chemistry between the actors.  Reminded me of Oceans 11 which was far better.  This felt like a movie about nothing.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|No deep philosophical meaning just a fast paced entertaining movie.  Yes some violence, but it won't cause any nausea or revulsion.
B00CTT9646|3.0|It was just ok that's about all I can say about it would not buy again 3 d is not that great
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|There aren't many things that the Chromecast can do, out of the box, but it does them all VERY well. Netflix and Google Play streaming work incredibly well, and Hulu Plus was just added to the party, as well. I have yet to try that functionality, but I'm sure it will be just as good as the others.<br /><br />For the price, I would definitely recommend one, if you're on the fence about it. If you have 5 other devices which will do Netflix and Hulu, and don't care about Google Play or the sketchy streaming from Chrome feature, it's probably not worth it. I don't have any video game consoles on my main TV, however, and the smartTV interface on my TV sucks, so this was a fantastic option.
B00ET47USI|5.0|The game is brightened by the animation. I just love it! It significantly reduces the pressure involved with attempting to win the game.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|I don't know what I can say here that hasn't been said, but buying the discs as opposed to streaming makes your family, friends and neighbors all love you when you lend them out!
B0072OFOM6|5.0|The loss of Andy Whitfield should have devastated the show as it did the fans. No one could take his place but Liam McIntyre brought a new layer to the character and he was great. Between the action packed fight scenes, the friendship/brotherhood between the characters, the journey to finding Crixus' lost love and the culmination of the war between Glauber and Spartacus the show did not disappoint. Thank you to the writers for not losing hope and giving up on Spartacus after the loss of Andy Whitfield. He would be proud of the show you put on.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|I love this game. It's a great time killer and very challenging. You just keep wanting to beat your score, or go farther. I can also see it being a great game for kids too.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|When I first heard they were going to do a prequel to Spartacus Blood and Sand I was not sure if it would meet expectations. But I was very pleasantly surprised. To see the history of Doctore and Crixus and the introduction of the character of Gannicus helped any disappointment the fans were feeling disappear. To see Lucy Lawless' character's love for her husband and desperate need to help him succeed gave a new layer of depth to Lucretia. And again, thank the Gods for the introduction of Gannicus.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I buy a lot of products from eBay and using this app just makes it more accessible.  I highly recommend it.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Starz outdid itself by telling the story about the slave who turned Rome inside out. Every episode was action packed. The cast was amazing. Having to recast the star is usually the death of a show especially when the star was as popular as the original Spartacus was but Liam McIntyre did the role proud. I would recommend and have recommended the entire Spartacus series to anyone.
B00FFL8ZMY|5.0|Every time this band releases something, it becomes the new best thing they've ever done. That's not easy, either, because everything they have done is pretty great and head and shoulders over the competition. So Fortress is here at last, and yes, it is the best album they have ever made. I love the intensity of the album, the songwriting, musicianship, production. I have been listening to it non-stop and can't find a single bad thing to say about it. It took a long time getting here since ABIII, but good things come to those who wait. Very good things!
B00AJLHULW|5.0|robben ford is one of the greatest guitar musicians of all time. for a change, he has horns on this cd and it is really out of this world. robben has such a feel for what he is playing it almost sounds like you are sitting in his living room watching and listening to him play.
B004JMY312|5.0|This is one of those movies that held up well over time. Sure, it has a hokey plot, but it's charming and suitable for kids and adults (who watched it as kids). The cast is great. You can't go wrong with the fiery Bette Midler and the endearing Kathy Najimy (I know her best from the Sister Act movies). And, I must admit, I even enjoyed Sarah Jessica Parker's lively performance. Give it a watch!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great!  It's fully functional, easy to use,  and easy to read.  especially a plus for those of us who are older and usually need reading glasses to use calculators.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|I have always loved the music in this movie and I am not one that really likeds musical. It's a cute story but does have a lot of sexual innuendos so I would say that it is not appropriate for young children.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this game is for individuals that are contend with playing for accomplishment alone. I love the unlimited lives and the individual accomplishment.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|I own quite a few watches I really love this watch. The red and blue color really makes this watch stand out I decided to leave the jubilee bracelet on the watch. It's also very accurate looks very nice on the wrist I have even gotten several complements its a really nice looking watch.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|been a fan of LEGOS since I was a kid and the same for BACK TO THE FUTURE so when I saw these to came together well I had to have it... this was a fairly easy piece to put together and the outcome is a really nice LEGO DELOREAN TIME MACHINE!!!!! this kit is worth the 34.99 2 day free shipping with prime... this kit looks great next to my LEGO ECTO-1.

0062225790|4.0|This is the first part of Richard Dawkins' memoir which initially takes us through his early years with his loving family in Africa. When he is eight, an unlikely inheritance sees them the owners of a farm in England and the family returns to the UK where his education continues with boarding school, Oundle (chosen, oddly, for its workshop) and then scraping into Balliol (to which he fails to win a scholarship). After two years in California at the height of 'flower-power', he returns to Oxford as a lecturer in zoology. Much of his educational life will be familiar territory to anyone who has read about prominent well-educated Englishmen of a certain age.<br /><br />During his happy boyhood years, there were no particular signs of genius - as Richard Dawkins himself would be the first to admit - though he was clearly a clever boy. There is also little in this period to point to the controversial figure he was to become, other than a refusal in his mid-teens to kneel in chapel. The author comes across as a remarkably modest and considerate man (American readers may appreciate his thoughtful explanations of English colloquialisms). Also a generous one: he is magnanimous in his praise of his tutors and colleagues. He explains some of his research work and tries to make it understandable for his audience but it is largely incomprehensible to the lay reader - or at least to this one! His personal life and his innermost feelings are hardly touched upon which will doubtless leave readers feeling a little short-changed. This is more of a memoir about the work than the man.<br /><br />The book finishes with the publication of [[ASIN:0192860925 The Selfish Gene]] and I do hope we will not have to wait too long to discover the life-changing effect this book was to have on him.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|I already own the movie, and love watching this film! I'm definitely a Marky Mark fan and Charlize Theron fan as well.  Great movie, and was re-done well, compared to the older black and white version.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|For the price this little game is great.  My grandson enjoyed helping me think.  Thank you for creating this game and offering it for free.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Not a big fan of the old ones, but can't get enough of this cast. This is a movie for anyone!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this app! played it on my phone before playing on my kindle fire. almost left a bad review because I didn't like the format on phone. but I play much better with all 4 cards right there.
0525478817|5.0|Only John Green could weave a story about teenagers dealing with cancer and create something clever, realistic, funny, sad and enjoyable without being maudlin or heavy-handed.  It was a delightful ride.  As usual, his characters are quirky and unforgettable.
1476727651|5.0|That's really all I can say about this book! It was great from cover to cover! Perhaps in the top 10 of his best work ALL-TIME! WOW!
015206057X|5.0|The illustrations and the text make this a darling book to read with young children.  I can read this book over and over again.  The illustrations are delightful, sweet and gentle.  I enjoyed its multicultural bent.

1476727651|4.0|The life of Danny Torrance after his escape from the Overlook Hotel makes an interesting, fun, and fast read. While the depths of alcoholic wretchedness didn't grip me as they might someone who's been there, this aspect of Danny's growth came across as entirely believable, in light of Jack Torrance's life and death. That Dan finds sobriety and sticks with it seemed uncharacteristically kind of King, but it is a welcome aspect of the story. The writing is solid and so competently smooth the pages flow past without any distracting quirks that might pull a reader out of the story.<br /><br />For those who don't enjoy ghost stories or hyper-violence, no worries! Early on a couple of ghosts appear--old friends isn't exactly the right term--but so quickly are they despatched even the most timid won't shudder. And what violence exists is subdued and, for the most part, off screen (so to speak).<br /><br />If I have any negative criticism at all of this story--and they are small--it's that (1) Momo struck me as a more fascinating character than Abra, so much so I wish she had teamed up with Dan in more ways than she does; (2) Lucy comes across as cipher, and an irritatingly emotional one at that; and (3) measles? This seems a bit of a cop-out, and while initially a clever device, a climax in which our heroes fight  a weakened enemy is a less fascinating and frightening than if The True Knot members were strong and juiced on Steam.<br /><br />These things aside, I read 'Doctor Sleep' with great pleasure. Like other reviewers, I wasn't sure what to expect in this sequel. It would have been so easy to screw up. I'm happy to say that King got it right. This is a book I believe most will enjoy, and I am going to steer clear of RVers from now on.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Upgraded to Samsung S4 from S3 and I believe this was the very first app I put on. Love the options to make it specific to me and the intuitive ssuggestions!

B00DJXSKWU|2.0|After 1st few maps it becomes overwhelming with minimal resources. Has potential yet this isn't a finished product. It's command and conquer  style with little resources to command with and enemy has abundant unequivocal resources. Unbalanced.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Other than the great set, colorful time period, the plot was implausible and the acting was not up to standard.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The game itself is quite good but the display of each card is unfamiliar. As for 5 of spade, the introduction icon shows 5 spade marks on a card as usual cards we play with but the card on real game show only one mark and number. It took some time for me to get used to the display.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I loved this series and would watch several episodes in one night. I can't wait for season 2 to start.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Although this game takes up a lot of space, it is very impressive bringing the console type of feel into a mobile device. With a great campaign and a outstanding multiplayer experience, I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys that fps experience!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is entertaining and I think educational - makes me think about where some of our puritan values come from.<br />I am anxious for season 4. I do hope that there is a medical miracle!
159413586X|4.0|I love this book. This book is my second favorite of the trilogy, my favorite is The Hunger Games. This book is the third book of the trilogy. Mockingjay has a lot of action in it, which I like. It is about Katniss moving to Distrtict 13 and plotting to kill President Snow, her arch enemy. This book has very good description and is action-packed. While there is no Hunger Games in this book, there is something just as exciting but I don't want to spoil it. I would recommend this book to a lot of readers who like great description and action. It is a great book!<br /><br />Kelby G.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Sooooo happy to finally own a copy of this movie! I absolutely adore works by Hayao Miyazaki and this movie is one of my favorites under his name. The movie itself is absolutely breathtaking in the adventure and the plot. The characters are very well developed by the end and without giving anything way, I definitely recommended this movie to just about anyone!<br /><br />This came in the mail fast, so I was definitely pleased with that and the disc was in perfect quality as I just couldn't wait to pop it in and start watching it!<br /><br />My best purchase yet!
0525478817|5.0|The book amazed me and captured my attention until the end.<br /><br />Hazel Grace Lancaster is a 16 year old girl with a rare lung cancer that makes her lungs \\"suck at being lungs.\\" Her mother thought she was depressed and sent her to a cancer support group, there she makes the aquantince of Augustus Waters.<br /><br />Throughtout the book she and Gus find a love for the same book. They travel to Amsterdam and meet the author for Gus's wish.

B00DXP7L88|5.0|Each season of Dexter followed a formula: Dexter has a foil who teaches him an important lesson, and a victim (who may or may not survive) who drives that lesson home. In season: (1) Brian shows the necessity of having a code, at Deb's expense; (2) Lila shows the evil of thrill killing, at Doakes' expense; (3) Prado shows that you can't teach the code, at Ellen's expense; (4) Mitchell shows that you can't pretend to be normal forever, at Rita's expense; (5) Chase shows that you can't have partners, at Lumen's  expense; (6) Marshall shows that religion offers no moral alternative, at Harrison's expense; (7) Isaak teaches him that home is where you can be yourself, at Hannah's expense. The beauty of season 8 is its misdirection. It appears that Dr. Vogel is there to show that you can't reform a psychopath, although we know by now that Dexter really isn't one. But Vogel isn't the real foil, who stays hidden for much of the season, and teaches a similar but more compelling lesson: you can't change your ways, at Deb's expense, which brings us full circle and explains the ending. All the lessons above are variations on a theme, which is driven home only in season 8, and made even more poignant by  maybe the show's best episode, Argentina, in season 7, which sets up much of season 8. All in all, I think this season was a satisfying ending to the series, and more subtle, I think, than many of the reviews here would indicate.
B003730LRY|4.0|Fun movie. My family enjoys it every time we watch it. As good as the original show.  Great for Halloween.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|They set up darkness very interestingly in their shot compositions. Story line is typical horror, I suppose. Overall, worthwhile, if you like horror flicks.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|Once again a great non gamer cpu.  Your just a compatible video card away from a better than average gamer machine with this cpu.  It has a low power requirement so for the casual surfer the system stays cool and isn't a room heater.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It gave me insight to love and relationships I have never experienced. I made a great choice in purchasing this book.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I like the unit. However the readings are all over the place. I can take my resting pulse and it will say 156. I retake it immediatly and now it says 76. I do like it keeping track of my sleep and physical activity. But if its going to keep track of that stuff, why should I have to buy the BodyMedia unit to also track exercise? The battery life is ok. But I only turn the display on a few times a day. Its supposed to have a 2-week battery life but I can't get more than about 6 days. Lastly, I don't like that the unit resets itself at midnight. It should reset by sleep cycle.  Some days I stay up past midnight and i'm not wild about the reset.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! I love how every few weeks they go to another city! its addicting! if your looking for games to get for free, get this one!!!!!!

B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wow!  Prepare yourself for an incredible and astounding account of the impossible.  Luttrell takes you through his ordeal high In the Afghanistan mountains in what is surely the single most harrowing story ever told.<br /><br />Thank you Marcus Luttrell for reliving this horror by telling us your experiences.  You truly define HERO.  And thanks to  the entire Lutrell family for raising not one but two SEALs.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|This is a really fun, fascinating, and very informative book.  You will learn many things by reading this book.  You will learn about the history of personal computers.  You will also learn a lot about learning.  This is a must read for all students.  If you are studying engineering, math, and/or computer science, you will especially like this book.  Steve Wozniak had a passion for learning, a natural curiosity and a tireless focus.  I found it difficult to put the book down at times.<br /><br />You learn about \\"the blue machine\\", \\"phone phreaking\\", and some wild ideas like creating a dial-a-joke line.<br /><br />Steve does clear the air about some common misconceptions about Apple's history.  You learn a bit more about the Apple II in Apple's history.  You learn that some at Apple have not always been given the credit they deserve.  Everything from reminding us that Ron Wayne, Steve Jobs, and Steve Wozniak founded Apple, to Steve Wozniak designing the Apple I and Apple II by himself, to the iMac and iPods being designed by Jony Ive.<br /><br />You learn about Steve's interests other than engineering.  Pulling pranks, flying planes, setting up and funding US Festivals (music festivals) and teaching the 5th grade.<br /><br />Steve offers advice for anyone who might \\"see the future\\".  If you are lucky enough to know what the next big thing will be.  Steve doesn't see the biggest & greatest ideas coming from a committee or some company.  As it was with Steve, he sees someone working tirelessly alone, that will produce the biggest advancements.<br /><br />It is an awesome and very interesting book.  One of the best books I have read in awhile!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|If you love war stories and the making of true heroes,  you'll love reading the accounts of this warrior.  What a remarkable life Kyle lead - SEAL, Hero, Father, Husband, Brother to his fellow veteran's and tragically a murder victim.
B009WUBERW|4.0|I liked the first one better, but this one was good. Too many tacky one-liners, but I didn't expect Oscar level acting from these actors. The action is good, and seeing all of these action stars together is kind of cool.
B00DWZHTOU|4.0|This movie is fun, exciting with above average cinematography and acting. The only reason for 4 stars is the ending is somewhat weak and in part anti-climatic. I'm certain don't regret buying this movie as it's a real keeper.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I was expecting a movie that followed the original more, but this ended up being a completely different movie than the Stallone original. You don't watch movies like this for great acting or complex plots, but there was a decent amount of action and plenty of gore for most.
1419705644|5.0|One of the coolest picture books out there. A must for anyone who considers themselves a true Adventure Time fan.
B00EQ30RVY|4.0|I liberated a copy from a local big box store. Ok so I have been a listener of Stone Temple Pilots for about twenty years, since I was 13. My girlfriend, a huge Pearl Jam fan, called me on my see-thru phone to say that Eddie Vedder was singing with another band, and he had cut his hair and to turn on MTV. Well, the song was Plush the Singer was one Scott Weiland and the band was STP.<br />So, all of the fans of Scott Weiland, the performer, (of which I am one) and STP as a whole band, may have some trepidation. First \\"It's not STP, it's Stone Temple Park, or STP feat. Ches. Bennington. Then there is the fact that we get an EP. Only five tunes here? Where's the beef? says one old lady at Wendy's? Finally, no Scott? What will this thing sound like?<br />Well, it's great. As an EP, it's great. With Chester fronting and providing his vocals (and I NEVER liked Linkin Park), it sounds great. And the loss of Scott, well we always have six monster records to go back and hear over and over.<br /><br />The tunes on this EP are all tight, modern sounding, driving rock. Much needed in this age. The vocals and the double tracking and echo that Chester delivers is very nice to listen to, sonically speaking. The lyrics are relevant, not trite and resound after you turn the record off. That has always been a benchmark for me, musically speaking. Do I remember and/or \\"get\\" the tunes after just one or two listens? On \\"High Rise,\\" I do.<br /><br />Eric's drumming is unique, powerful, and focusing. Robert DeLeo's bass is so deep in the pocket it could be surrounded by 1912 Buffalo nickel. His lines are melodic and simultaneously battering ram strong. Dean pulls nice and dirty off at the same time on his Les Paul-fueled signature rhythm figures. The pyrotechnics are set off on the last three tracks. Dean has always blended the melodic and minor/major tones with blazing articulation. The riffs on these tracks, like the rhythm track on \\"Cry Cry\\" is purposeful. The band is tight, period.<br /><br />The songs, even though there are only five, are worthy, says I. An EP can't be a huge deal, right? That is semi-true,cynically speaking. Well, consider Alice in Chains 1994 EP \\"Jar of Flies.\\" Many consider it their best work and by far the most innovative. I feel that way about Jar. I'm in no way saying that this comes anywhere close to \\"Purple\\"-that was the best mainstream \\"everybody-knows-it\\" record of the 90s. Of course STP is \\"putting their toe in the water\\" so to speak, before this unit makes this fling a long term deal. High Rise has risen. Now let's hope the other fans listen.r /><br />The songs, even though there are only five, are worthy, says I. An EP can't be a huge deal, right? That is semi-true,cynically speaking.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I was nervous about this book.  I loved The Shining, which I read around age 12 and have re-read many times, including recently in preparation for this sequel.  Stephen King has been my favorite author since that age, probably almost to the point of unhealthy obsession at times.  But I've found that I've not loved his more recent books, the last one I really loved being Under the Dome (though I also enjoyed Full Dark, No Stars). I have a great attachment to all of his stories I read as a teenager and I was very nervous about how things would turn out for Danny.<br /><br />I could tell from the first chapter that I was not going to be disappointed.  Unlike, say, Joyland, this book started off interesting right out of the gate and never let up.  The concept behind the book was interesting, but more important to me, the book was true to the characters and that that Stephen King \\"feel\\" that I can't really explain.  Those of you who love his books will know what I mean.  One of my favorites of his is Black House, because getting to see Travellin' Jack all grown up was an experience filled with nostalgia and emotion.  Though I was not as attached to Danny Torrence as I was to Jack (if I'd had a son his name would probably be John Benjamin), I had that same feeling of nostalgia reading this book.<br /><br />There were many twists and turns that I did not predict, and fascinating glimpses into the history of Jack Torrence, Danny's dad and a main character in The Shining.  I would actually love to see a prequel, going back to Jack's earlier life.  We learned much more about him in this book, even in small pieces, than we did in The Shining.  Doctor Sleep had everything I could ask for in a Stephen King novel, leaving me feeling like I can't read anything else because nothing else will measure up, and perhaps I should just re-read The Dark Tower, again.  For me, this is the greatest feeling to have after a book, satisfied and wrung out and bereft.  Strange, but true.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|every one of their albums is great and it exceeds one after another.  It has the death punch sound.  One of the main reasons that i bought this album is because i love ffdp and it is a two part series like guns and roses use your illusions series.  It will be collectable one day usually.  buy this album.  you wont be regret it.
B000FC146C|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I have seen the movie and read the book at least twice. It is a real page turner.

B0001I562I|3.0|Cute movie, outdated and hokey plot, but younger kids will love the friendly alien and the concept of time-travel.  The reason I didn't give it a higher rating is because there are a few swear words.

0762449306|5.0|Smallish, one of the stickers was a bit crooked, but overall a good replica and the light on top is a nice touch.
B001NFNFIK|1.0|DVD did not work at all. Tried in several machines. Junk. Amazing, since it is next to impossible to &#34;professionally&#34; produce a defective DVD. Not worth going through hassle of returning.  Finally got it from iTunes.<br /><br />Note: Movie was also junk. Had none of the artfullness of the book. Choppy and largely incoherent. A complete mess and a missed opportunity to produce a great film based on a really good book.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was having trouble with keeping my Kindle Fire charged, but now that I have this cord to go with my new charger it charges quickly and seems to be keeping charged for a longer period of time.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I thought this movie was extraordinary...of epic proportion. I don't really care for the story so much, but the movie itself was fabulous. Great acting, photography, special effects. Well worth watching.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Why on earth does a children's fight to the death story get such a world renowned following.  My friends all LOVE this movie.  I thought it was very well made and the acting and production quality was great.  Just a real cockamamie idea....
B005LAIIGW|5.0|\\"I hate space.\\" Ryan Stone (Bullock) is a medical engineer who is working in space on an experiment. She is up there with astronaut Matt Kowalski on his last mission and trying to break the space walk record. When ground control warns them of incoming debris Stone thinks she can finish before they are hit. She is wrong. When a rouge particle hits the arm she is on she becomes detached from the shuttle and her crew. Floating alone in space she does everything she can to make it back home safe. This is a hard movie to review. The main reason is because I don't want to give anything away. This is one of if not the most tense movie I think I have ever seen. Five minutes into the movie the action starts and doesn't stop until the end. I found myself white knuckled and holding my breath almost the entire time. There are very few movies that I have a hard time talking about. This is one of them. Words can't do this justice. This is easily one of the best movies of the year, an absolute must see and the best 3D movie I have ever seen. Overall, nothing else to say but WOW! Watch this! I give it an A+.
B00FE0FO7U|5.0|This is a wonderful album! Full of great music by a great man. Great sounds to listen to on your way to work.
0756407915|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I've recommended it to so many people and all who have read it have loved it too! Sensational. :)
B005WUHAX8|5.0|If you are buying this case, you will  probably only get one year of quality, but its a lot cheaper than buying a new iPhone.  Think about it.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I love how they made the 2nd instalment not the series but it needs the UPDATES if you guy agree then we have to get the people at Amazon to get up dates
B004K4IZ54|5.0|If you own a 3D TV this movie Showcases it !!  The movie is great of course, But 3D makes you there !!

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If you liked the first. You will love the 2nd even more. J.J Abrams is probably the best young director out there and<br />he did not disappoint with this sequel !!
B0058YPGSY|4.0|I like the brotherhood of friends and mates in club support and look after you. And i just like bikes.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My friends kept on raving about this drama being amazing so i caved and started watching it. Now i'm hooked!
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|It is shocking all the negative reviews for this album, because this is easily one of their best efforts.  The song writing is excellent and there is some amazing musicianship.  They have an amazing block of albums from IMAGES AND WORDS, AWAKE, METROPOLIS PART 2: SCENES FROM A MEMORY, and SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE.  While that block of albums is amazing, this self titled release is the best album since SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE.  The whole album is solid, but the standout tracks are THE ENEMY INSIDE and ILLUMINATION THEORY.  ILLUMINATION THEORY takes a page out of Rush's playbook with a very atmospheric movement migrating into a drum and bass groove that kicks the track into high gear.  I would not listen to all the negativity on this one as it is a solid effort worthy of the Dream Theater name.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|A great final season to an at-times over the top but enjoyable show!  The series finale ties everything up beautifully - you won't be disappointed. Recommended.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I was intrigued by the fact that via the language of flowers, a person's true feelings could be  revealed without saying a word.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|My kids love it and I have to endure it in the car. My 8 year old now has a nervous tick: She keeps clapping and tapping everywhere á la Cups Song. It's annoying. Irritatingly so. Then there's the whole Party in the USA sing along. Must I be reminded of Miley Cyrus and her hideous tongue twerks while I drive the treacherous stretches of the 101?! Never mind that Brittany Snow has an awesome voice... There's not enough mind bleach to wipe the heinous murder of Hannah Montana with a foam finger who's doll house we still own. Okay, so maybe Anna Kendrick's voice might just do it. She rocked the Breakfast Club theme song.
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|The Croods (in eye popping 3D) Bowling for Movies Score: 239.625 of 300<br /><br />On a cold, dark day in Houston, mid-summer, a dream was hatched - a dream of creating a way to organize a vast movie collection.  Oh sure, there are movie \\"critics\\" and manifold movie blogs and periodicals but these so called \\"professionals\\" often are out of touch with what I like to call \\"The Average Dude\\" - you know, your standard issue person on the street.  \\"Hey,\\" I thought, \\"I'm just an average dude aaaaand I have way too much time on my hands aaaaaaand an unordinary number of movies at my finger-tips - literally hundreds and hundreds - and I was endowed with a natural proclivity towards gab.\\"  This brain flower blossom and bore the fruit which is Bowling for Movies.<br /><br />Like a mad scientist in his lab, I sat down and created an entirely new system for ranking movies.  Utilizing a plastic spatula, I blended both modern and archaic technology in a synergetic explosion of quasi/pseudo-science which renders Hollywood magic down to a comprehensive (if not patentable) bowling score (which actually has nothing to do with bowling).  Should a movie be simple ok, not really good, not really bad it would receive a score of 108 of 300;  crest 192 of 300 and you've got a bona fidable GOOD movie; crack what I like to call The Hot 200 and you've got a real gem.<br /><br />The Croods - We own the Blu Ray 3D, Blu Ray, DVD, Digital Copy combo pack (dude, that's like every version of the film imaginable, crazy huh?)<br /><br />Synoptically Speaking - what's it about?<br />Nicolas Cage leads a star-studded voice cast as the over-protective caveman father Grug Crood in this beautifully rendered story about a family of cave-people who live life by a simple rule: Never be NOT safe.  When rebellious, and frankly quite selfish, daughter Eep (Emma Stone) hits that \\"know it all\\" stage the entire family's life gets turned upside-down.  Eep has a chance meeting with a \\"modern\\" human boy named Guy (Ryan Reynolds) who has a head full of `new' ideas and the ability to make fire... and naturally Eep thinks he's the best thing since sliced bread (which as I think of it probably should be the greatest thing before sliced bread on account of the prehistoric nature of the flick predating bread and therefore slicing of the bread by many millennium).  When tectonic plate drift set off sudden and ever-escalating natural disasters, the family is forced to leave the safety of the cave and set out, with Guy's help, across a strange and dangerous jungle full of every sort of fantastical animal one could imagine - absolutely outside of Grug's safety  zone.  Will the Crood family make it to safety?  Will Guy and Eep's relationship blossom while under her father's watchful eye?  Will Grug's cantankerous mother-in-law outlive them all?  Can a caveman embrace new ideas to save his growing family?  All these questions and more are answered in beautifully creative and masterfully animated 3D.<br /><br />All things considered I have to claim conscious interference when talking about the latest DreamWorks offering - I'm not too far off from a caveman myself and Little Miss Movie Dude's 14th birthday is like TOMORROW so I found myself identifying with Grug...  my little baby girl is growing up and testing her wings (which naturally means testing my patience) and, clich&eacute; of clich&eacute;s, I'm wondering where the time has gone.  I assumed it would be a good movie, DreamWorks has been moving towards high caliber stories for a while - and although they fall just short of Pixar's emotional impact level - this movie had surprising depth of character and more heart than I've seen this side of Disney/Pixar's \\"Up\\".  There is a rather delicate story here of the love shared between father and daughter and the literal evolution of Grug's role in Eep's life.  This subtle story is set during a period of climatic upheaval which lends itself to many funny scenes which is sure to keep younger audiences entertained.<br /><br />Hey, Movie Dude - what a gem of a flick, what did you like most?<br />~  Wonderful coming of age story that gently moves a caveman to evolve to greater heights of understanding and acceptance<br />~ A great blending of pure cartoon animation with incredibly life-like, photo-realistic surroundings<br />~ A top notch soundtrack is a staple of any great film but I have to take my hat off to DreamWorks for pulling together a marching band and other instrumental songs to punctuate the emotional soul of this film<br /><br />Ok Movie Dude, what did you detract points for?<br />~ I loved the film but it shared a rebellious frizzy haired girl who won't listen to her parents type quality with Disney's Brave - I won't go as far as say it's a Brave clone but I'll say this theme has been used (and used, and used) before<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly. I will be leaving more movie reviews with bowling scores so check out my other reviews. Bowling for Movies is in no way affiliated with Amazon nor do I have a website or other business interest - I'm just a dude who watches movies (and dabbles in quasi/pseudo-science) :] Want me to review a movie and score it in an Amazon review - I'd be happy to - if I have it, you'll get it.ertained.<br /><br />Hey, Movie Dude - what a gem of a flick, what did you like most?<br />~  Wonderful coming of age story that gently moves a caveman to evolve to greater heights of understanding and acceptance<br />~ A great blending of pure cartoon animation with incredibly life-like, photo-realistic surroundings<br />~ A top notch soundtrack is a staple of any great film but I have to take my hat off to DreamWorks for pulling together a marching band and other instrumental songs to punctuate the emotional soul of this film<br /><br />Ok Movie Dude, what did you detract points for?<br />~ I loved the film but it shared a rebellious frizzy haired girl who won't listen to her parents type quality with Disney's Brave - I won't go as far as say it's a Brave clone but I'll say this theme has been used (and used, and used) before<br /><br />Hey, if you have a question about this review, feel free to leave a comment and I will try to answer promptly.

0399255370|5.0|Hardback with cover.  This is a great book especially for those crayon lovers out there!  I bought it for my nephews because they love crayons so much just like there mommy!
0393343405|4.0|This book was not exactly what I expected it to be.  I kept waiting, chapter after chapter, for the &#34;Swerve.&#34;  Stephen Greenblatt gives a detailed backstory to the swerve.  It begins with 15th century manuscript hunters, moves back in time to describe Roman culture before Julius Ceasar and then moves even further back to describe the life and times of Greece in Epicurious' time before Lucretius wrote &#34;On the Nature of Things.&#34;<br /><br />My only critical comment would be that I kept waiting for the &#34;swerve&#34; that would make the world become modern.  Greenblatt built the foundation for the impact this lost manuscript would have on the world; I just thought he gave short shrift to the actual &#34;swerve&#34; in humankind's thinking.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the humanities and how its study came down to the modern world through the centuries.  It's a fascinating read.... sometimes difficult, but always well written.
0486274268|5.0|Very good book! Very educational to learn how to draw so many different kinds of animals and shapes. I enjoyed this book because it's easy to follow along in.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It was OK at best.  Not nearly as good as the ads made it look.  Glad I didn't go see it in the theater.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Very excited to see what's next in the series! Keep it up howey! I'll be recommending this book to friends and family
B00F91SCXC|4.0|Great zombie movie.  Action packed, fast paced and solid story.  I thought it was very convincing and wasn't distracted by forced love stories or over the top plot twists.  I would definately recomend this if you are zombie fan.
1476727651|5.0|You know you are in the hands of a master storyteller when you start a book at 7 a.m., before breakfast, and suddenly realize 150 pages later that you have been reading for three hours and that you have not yet eaten anything and that you are still in your pajamas. This was my experience.<br /><br />No matter what literary and/or intellectual pretensions you may have, I challenge anyone to quit reading this novel after 20 or 30 minutes. The action and characters suck you in so that it is almost impossible to stop reading. I read a great many novels at varying levels of literacy and enduring values, and my opinion is that Stephen King (when at his best) tells the most absorbing stories among modern writers.<br /><br />This is the story of Dan Torrance, the little boy in The Shining, when he is all grown up and has hit rock bottom in his attempt through alcohol to block remembrance and feeling. After tentatively eluding the demon of addiction through AA, Dan has come to be a valued employee of a hospice residence as Doctor Sleep, capable of guiding the dying to a peaceful end. Then he is contacted by Abra, a young girl with even more capability of \\"shining\\" than he ever had, and he is drawn into conflict with the True Blood, a group of semi-immortals who feed vampire-like off of children, not from their blood but from of the essence of their \\"shining,\\" their paranormal abilities.<br /><br />In less capable hands, this could be only a suspenseful and scarey story of good versus evil, but King makes it much more.<br /><br />It's about family--dysfunctional families, loving families, families formed without regard for blood connection. And it's about inheritance--what comes to us through genetics and what we choose to do about our inherited tendencies.<br /><br />And it's about substance addiction and Alcoholics Anonymous and its ability to help those who have trouble helping themselves. Those familiar with Stephen King's life story can readily see that this part, at least, is reflective of his life experience.<br /><br />In addition to moving along his suspenseful story, King inserts numerous little asides which seem to be such true aphorisms that one is tempted to be believe that they are folk sayings. For example: \\"Your mind was a blackboard. Booze was the eraser.\\"; and \\"When you couldn't sleep, when you were afraid to look around because of what you might see, time elongated and grew sharp teeth\\"; and \\"She was eighty-five and her sleep was as thin as her skin.\\"; and \\"...the good thing about being old is that you don't have to worry about dying young.\\"<br /><br />An additional plus: King's narratives of the guidance of Dan Torrance as he assists dying patients are especially perceptive. They are tear-worthy, but more importantly they seem true.<br /><br />For Stephen King fans who were looking for scarey, this one is not that frightening, but still you will never look at an RV park in the same way again. It is more theme-driven and contemplative than designed to provide chills in the night. I consider it to be one of King's best ever.
B008JFUO72|5.0|This is the best of all of the Iron Man Movies, it has something for every Comic fan.<br />lots of excitement throughout the entire movie.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I loved this book! It had the perfect amount of funny to go along with some pretty hot sexiness! I fell in love with Drew and loved how the story was written from his pov! This is my first read from Emma chase and after this it will not be the last!
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is a very good wireless headset.  I use it extensively (daily) for meetings and video conferencing (Skype, OCS, Adobe Connect).  They are comfortable to wear for extended periods of time and the voice quality is excellent.  I also like being able to wander around the office in my home while talking or otherwise attending the meeting.  The range in my home is at least 40 feet or so, and I can even wander down into the garage (my office is upstairs in my house) with little or no interruption.  If interrupted, everything returns quickly once back in range.  One thing, there does a appear to be a &#34;quirk&#34; in Windows and USB ports where the computer seems to &#34;forget&#34; there is a headset active.  When this happens, you just press a small button on the headset to re-establish everything and you are good to go.  Frankly, the choices on wireless headsets at a reasonable price are limited, and this one really fits the bill for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love Downton Abbey. Watched season 1 though 3. Almost addictive. Great, clean English drama infused w some of the British dry humor.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Like a book that keeps you on your toes-hard to figure out-this is that book.<br /><br />Be patient in the beginning, when the author is introducing all the characters,...  It will seem like a lot, but then they will all e interconnected.<br /><br />Good read.

B0045IPOPE|5.0|This superb rendering of the underbelly of the Vietnam War and the juxtaposition of both moral and political forces is worth the watch.  Martin Sheen,Marlon Brando and virtually the entire cast are in top form.  Lots to think about in this movie.

B00ER23V1W|5.0|Not since Jaws has a film score enhanced the terror and suspense of what's on screen than Steven Price's score for GRAVITY.<br /><br />Watching the film in IMAX 3D, the music immediately had me on edge along with the fantastic visuals. I had never heard of Mr Price before, but suffice it to say, I will notice him now.<br /><br />The score is a beautiful mix of effective action cues and more subtle, sweet ones.<br /><br />Destined to be a classic, just like the film itself.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am watching season 3 now -it is very intriguing. Each show leaves you wanting to watch the next one - here is always a surprise.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I love the new Star Trek movies.  Chris Pine is amazing and I love the interaction with the rest of the cast.  They have throw backs to the original cast but updated for todays technology.  Its exciting, and the humor is a great break from the suspense.

B001P06GX4|5.0|Our family ages 7 to 70 had a really fun time playing this game.  The little one was the first to see when a piece was placed incorrectly,  This was our favorite of the 3 new games we bough for summer vacation.  LOVED it!!t
B002VECM4K|5.0|I rate it five because it is a deep movie this happens in real life and people have to learn to have patient and believe their children when they said that someone is abusing children or grown adults I recommend this movie
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Mr Rollins always delivers incredibly interesting adventure stories with a dash of real facts entwined. He never fails to provide a great read with wonderful characters.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Sex and the city movies was good I enjoy the characters and  it was enjoyable that you can watch over and over again I recommend this movie if you love the shows you would love the movies too
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|This series is seriously intelligent, unpredictable and captivating.  You will not be disappointed.  I had reservations initially because I was afraid it would glamourize the destructiveness of Meth, but it actually shows the many reasons why you should not ever think of following this path.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Great movie , however, I had to watch it three times due to the great filming. Had to get into the movie when the 3d imagery is so good and your saying &#34;cool&#34; all the time.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book in a dog`s perspective.  All dog lovers would enjoy.<br />Heartwarming,relatable,and at times tugs at your heartstrings
B004SUWR2C|3.0|for some reason it just does not meet the chanllenges of the game when cards are actually held.  Hard to separate cards and play what you want.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Great, great series!  The original Star Trek with William Shattner will always be my favorite, but this is definitely a close second.  Patrick Stewart's acting is superb.  He will always be Captain Jean Luc Picard!!
B00CTSDDVO|4.0|I really liked this movie. Great action mixed with humor. Some may balk at the involvement of Khan (Which is apparently not a spoiler since it says his character name on the box), but I thought it was cool. The only thing I did not like so much was the 3D aspect of the film. The 3D was just OK, nothing to get excited about really.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 6 year old son and I love playing this.  Even though it's a &#34;game,&#34; it actually does teach.  Trajectories, cause and effect, basic motor-skills, reasoning, logic...a veritable cornucopia of things that a young mind needs to develop.  Don't believe me?  Give it a shot...it's a lot harder than it looks to get three stars on everything.  My ex-wife admitted she simply can't do it, &#34;It's too hard to figure out just the right angle to hit those bubbles to cause him to curve back in and then hit the second bubble to swing him back out, again.&#34;<br /><br />It's basic physics...with a touch of luck.  :-)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downtown Abbey is a fantastic historical drama. Bringing in real world era problems and explaining them to a public that otherwise have never know about historical events. The Amazon playback was flawless.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is the first camera bag I bought. It has enough space to hold two cameras. I can also adjust the space easily. The size is just right to me.
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|Love the Iron Man series but they're becoming too predictable. Also, Mrs. Potts role was entirely underplayed until the very end. Wish we would see more of that! Overall, it was good but I'm not blown away.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|This game is worth every last penny. I mean, for only $0.99, it is a great game. Basically you are a shine runner, a person who runs moonshine, crawdads, catfish, Peter pep, tobacco, and other assorted &quot;goods&quot; up and down a wild river. Great controls once you get used to them, excellent graphics, and all around fun.

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I decided to read The Husband's Secret by Liane Moriarty because it's been on the New York Times and USA Today list for weeks. I would call this the sleeper hit of 2013, much like Gone Girl last year. The Husband's Secret is women's fiction but it also has this chick-lit feel to it because there are moments of humor from the three main female protagonists. The Husband's Secret is all about the \\"what ifs\\", and what you would do for those you love. How far would you go to protect them, and if they did something so shockingly horrible, could you forgive them or make them pay for their so-called crime they swear was a mistake?<br /><br />The Husband's Secret begins with Cecilia who has found a letter written by her husband, John Paul. She was looking for something in the attic and came across it. It says for her only to open it upon his death. Cecilia is tempted to open it but she's afraid of what she'll read. She goes through various scenarios in her head (a very funny scene while she's in church where she thinks John-Paul may be gay because they hadn't made love in a while, and then she gets very horny wanting sex with her husband) but will wait to tell John-Paul (who is away on business and will return around Easter) that she found it. She loves her life and her husband and their three daughters, all under the age of thirteen. Cecilia is also a very respected and a beloved member of the community, including the church she attends and the school her daughters go to. She also holds fun Tupperware parties.<br /><br />Rachel works at the school Cecelia's daughters attend. Easter is a hard time for Rachel because almost twenty years ago, her sixteen year old daughter Janie was found dead in a park near a slide. She had been strangled and the killer was never caught. Her only son is married and he has an adorable two year old boy who Rachael adores. Her son and his family are moving to New York for a new job he has, essentially leaving Rachel alone. She's still filled with grief over her daughter's death and believes one of the teachers at the school, Connor Whitby, who knew Janie killed her. But she doesn't have proof and will make him pay because she knows deep inside he killed her because he looks shifty and has a motorcycle.<br /><br />Tess and her young son, Liam are living with her mother for the moment until Tess can decide on what to do about her marriage. Her husband, Will is in love with Tess's cousin Felicity, even though they swear they haven't had sex. Betrayed, Tess goes to lick her wounds and comes in contact again with her old boyfriend from high school, Connor who she is still attracted to. Does she start an affair with Connor to get back at Will?<br /><br />Cecilia, Rachel and Tess are all connected because of the people they know and who they come in contact with. There are two big mysteries here- what does the letter John-Paul wrote say and who killed Janie? Things are revealed at a very fast pace and you'll soon be hooked. We learn about the past and how that past has shaped and molded these three women's present. The writing is very straight forward, but then a quarter away from the end, there's a big heartbreaking shock you will never expect. The outcome is unknown, and those \\"what ifs?\\" come into play.<br /><br />The Husband's Secret is not just about the secret Cecilia's husband has, but the secrets we all keep within ourselves. We see this perfectly from these characters in their thoughts and actions. What you see is not what you get, and Liane has written a perfect character study regarding this.<br /><br />I urge you to read The Husband's Secret. The last chapter is very insightful and full of questions that don't have any real answers, but will keep you guessing long after you have finished reading.<br /><br />Katiebabsgrief over her daughter's death and believes one of the teachers at the school, Connor Whitby, who knew Janie killed her.

B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Good start to the revived Doctor Who series.  Significantly modernized in execution, but still deeply a Uk SciFi.  Well worth the watch if you like SciFi.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|Came just as described very happy with it. It came a lot quicker than I thought it would as well.
B00EMJBVAI|4.0|Enjoyed it - not much like the book (which was better) but a good movie. I would recommend it, even though it wasn't very scary.
B000W1YYEK|5.0|I really love the music on this album. If you're into Rush, you'll understand. Entre Nous is my favorite Rush song.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|When this movie was in theaters I honestly thought it would be just another crappy remake. However, after watching it on Amazon last weekend I was pleasantly surprised. I'll make it simple: good visuals, great sound, decent plot, believable acting. 5/5 would watch again.
B00785P2QC|3.0|its a great game except for the shameless self-promotion. I don't want to be roped into sharing on facebook ALL the time.
B00DJ80VMM|5.0|When Roadrunner Records released the single \\"The Enemy Within\\" prior to the release of the self-titled Dream Theater album, I was not impressed with the music. (However, check out the video and see how they honor U.S. troops, which is commendable.) To me, the single sounded like more of the same. It did not seem to me that the band was breaking any new ground. Friends of mine who are percussionists told me the song was great. Whatever.<br /><br />Or, so I thought.<br /><br />I have been a big Dream Theater fan since \\"Images and Words,\\" but there are some albums I do not listen to as much as others (like, \\"A Change of Seasons\\" and \\"Falling into Infinity\\"). So, I was going to buy this album any way in order to support the band. Let me say, I am glad I did. This is a great album, top to bottom. Yes, even \\"The Enemy Within.\\" When you listen to where it falls in the track order, it makes sense and fits in with a larger whole.<br /><br />What I like about this album is the diversity of styles of the songs. I think this might be the best songwriting since \\"Images and Words\\" and \\"Awake.\\" There are musical phrases throughout the album that remind me of earlier Dream Theater releases, yet it is still new. There is also a heavy Rush influence, too.<br /><br />When I first listened to the album, \\"The Bigger Picture\\" was my favorite song. Then, it was \\"Illumination Theory.\\" Now, it is \\"Along for the Ride.\\"<br /><br />If you are a Dream Theater fan, kind of a Dream Theater fan or a progressive rock fan, then get this album. If you are death or thrash metal, then you might want to stay away from this release.<br /><br />I might add, I am a Prime member, and I purchased the CD hours before the album was released, and I was able to download the mp3s on the day of release while waiting for the CD to arrive.<br /><br />Bobby

1400052173|5.0|Learned a lot about the HeLa cells and the woman they came from.<br />This was a &#34;Common Read&#34; for the college I go to and it really opened<br /> my eyes to the backstory of HeLa cells and how some people<br />were treated in the 50's. It shows how far we have come because of this one<br />woman and her cells that were taken from her unbeknownst to her family.<br />It tells how the cells grew when other peoples cells were dying. And how her cells<br />helped to develop vaccines and hopefully some day a cure for cancer.<br /> It was a great book.
0446547638|4.0|This product arrived promptly and was in great shape. Overall a great read. Definitely can't go wrong with any of Nicholas Sparks's books!!!
B00F35BV64|5.0|If you liked the first one, you will enjoy this one just as much.  Definitely rent is, and rent it again.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I definitely enjoyed this book! Written as a \\"practical\\" guide to ready yourself for the possibility of zombie outbreak, I kept having to remind myself that it's just fiction. However, the tone is so serious, I was starting to think I might need to follow the suggestions Max Brooks has written down!
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Just got it I love it better the more I listen too it.I've missed Head<br />its good too have him back in the fold! Gonna see them next month<br />Gonna were this Mother Fu ker out till then.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|The eventual payoff isn't that bad, but it spends a lot of time building and throwing around false leads, the eventual payoff is good but I'm not sure worth the investment. Lots of stylized, cartoonish violence and death, with lots of monotonous brooding in between.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Makes my heart speed up. It is fast paced. I can only keep up with three cards to get a possible BINGO. Four is too much to keep up for me. Also, if there is a problem or glitch, the game reimburses you.  They are good. It is a good game for waiting on something to bake or download or whatever. It has a chat room you can ignore if you want. BINGO around the world is cool too. You get to choose New York or Paris...etc. Beats boredom for sure. Make sure your wi-fi is on and parental controls are set. It can be linked to Facebook so you can share on Facebook. This game has different variations of BINGO like blackout and powerups and keys for chests that are on the boards. Buy powerups and keys with points that are won or with real money during game play. Chests contain puzzle pieces or keys or points or powerups.Powerups are cheats or an extra daub or two  or points or special things like one number is an automatic BINGO...etc. You get into Slots as well. It can be addictive but fun and fast.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I began reading the first book out of curiosity. Then the plot called for more and went for the second book, since I was wondering what happens next. Once concluded I decided to go for the third and final book to see where the story ends.  In this final novel the novelty of sm sex has already faded and frankly at times it seems repetitive and even boring and the reader is looking for something else. I was disappointed by the finale in this book. I mean it is a fairy tale after all, where beautiful girl, finds prince charming, they get married, have kids and live happily ever after. I was expecting something different and I must confess it has let me down.

B005NFJAT4|5.0|I was in this movie, one day I was a Union soldier defending Little Round Top and another day I was a rebel doing Pickett's Charge. All that reenacting aside, it is probably the closest anyone will ever get in depicting the Battle of Gettysburg as it was.  I would rate this along with Tora Tora Tora, Saving Private Ryan, and The Pacific as far as how it was. I have walked many of those battlefields.
B001DCZ4IW|1.0|I tried to watch this because it was on a reviewer's list of 100 best comedy films or something.  I stuck it out for 15 minutes then skipped forward a half dozen times and it was relentlessly the same:  An unamusing neurotic woman and her neurotic son.<br /><br />Not at all what my idea of funny is.
B001R4BTSU|5.0|Review based on 180 gram LP.<br /><br />It seems interesting that if a LP is on a 180 gram pressing it has a higher chance of being a history making or over the top recording. This is no exception; this being Melody Gardot's 2nd release carrying a late 1950ish Nat King Cole style orchestration of her own Jazz & Blues creations. The only song she didn't write was \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" but it has a jazzier kick to it than the original \\"Wizard of Oz\\". She was born in Philadelphia but why do I hear a little French rending of expression? The 1st song on side 2 is sung in French called \\"Les Etoiles\\" but I hear more than this; maybe it's her softness or semi-sexy voice? Maybe because she has been singing alot in Europe? Some negative reviews state that they want a more robust singer. Okay, than buy CD or LP of a robust singer. If you want soft sweet whispers at night then this LP is for you. My favorite song is the title \\"My One & Only Thrill\\" which is rather haunting & reflective that Melody Gardot perfectly sings the emotion. This is a pure delight to listen to & I need to start collecting her other 2 releases.<br /><br />No hiss or Pop on this LP with interesting background sounds sprinkled throughout. Recording is great with wide sound stage.<br /><br />I always buy my products from Amazon with free shipping & I was checking this shipment everyday. Well worth the wait.<br /><br />I am putting the beatuiful LP cover in a 12\\" Record 3mil Thick Polyethylene Outer Sleeve that I also purchased from Amazon. A match made in Heaven.
B0045NXMJE|5.0|Rich imagery, lovable characters, and an excellent tale of righteous revenge.  No French subtitles if you're using it to study French.
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|A great movie to watch. Such a great father and I really wished he could have survived as well. As is definitely makes a strong ending!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Set up was a bit of trial and error, but my son managed it after a few attempts. The install help is very rudimentary, it would be useful to make it a bit specific. I actually have it plugged into my receiver and now the sound system fully enabled too. I recommend Chromecast. I would like to see a lot more apps becoming available in the near future.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game. Super cute loved it. But the only reason I downloaded it was to be able to finish a quest in another game Epic but after I downloaded it my quest still did not register as complete and I don't know why or how to make it count.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|a great ap! does everything you would want an alarm clock to do! I would reccomend it highly to everyone! it can also be customized.
B006964E8S|4.0|A little far fetched in areas and the character is similar to another author but I enjoyed reading the story.  The story line kept me engaged even though every now and then it seemed to lose direction.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Melodic and thought provoking. Expertly performed and not bombastic at all. Reminds me somewhat of Gabriel/Hackett era Genesis. Also great to hear Dave Gregory (ex-XTC guitarist) again.
0446580848|3.0|I have all of Nelson DeMille's books and I would rate each and every one of them 5 stars.  Except this one.  And that is surprising insofar as he not only brought back two of my favorite characters in John Corey and Kate Mayfield Corey, but he added a hero from two of his previous novels, Paul Brenner.  This book should have sizzled from the beginning all the way through to the end.  It didn't.  Instead we are given a 575 page social studies lesson on Islam, Muslims, middle eastern politics, and shifting sands.  Instead of bonding immediately and forming a dynamic, uh, trio Brenner apparently decides he wants his mission to be to get Kate in bed.  That causes Corey to spend an inordinate amount of time fretting over his wife betraying him.  And Kate, although a college graduate, a law school graduate, and an FBI agent of several years experience, spends most of her time saying &#34;shut  up, John,  &#34;that's enough, John&#34; and &#34;I'm going with or without you, John&#34;.  A total waste of three good characters.  Get past the sexual tension Mr. DeMille.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Awesomeness fun. I hate all of the ad pop-up. Other than that great fun game. I would recommend to anybody.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from the movie because the books hadn't excited me that much. But i was surprised. This movie has a great story line, great actors who did their job and know how to play their characters, hilarious lines, and great action sequences.<br />  Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law have amazing chemistry that puts the audience on their seats waiting to see what they do next. Jude Law, who plays Dr. Watson,looks out for Sherlock Holmes, played by Robert Downey Jr. Yet at the same time, Robert Downey Jr. is the leader of the two. Sherlock Holmes is eccentric, quirky, weird, yet brilliant. Dr. Watson is almost the opposite of that, down to earth, realistic, and sensible. It is fascinating to see the relationship of these two paradoxical people who form the greatest detective pair of all time.<br />  This movie is absolutely one of the most funny movies I have ever seen. We've all seen Robert Downey Jr. do his thing in Avengers and Iron man and he brings the same type of hilarity into this movie. His sarcasm, irony and what ever else he adds to it is absolutely priceless. And contrast that with Dr. Watsons stoicism and you get unendless humor.<br />  This movie is also pure action. They have bombs exploding everywhere. Trees blowing up, canon firing, and gunfire through the whole thing. Not only do you have strong action, but you also have more subtly action such as poison, disguises, and brilliance. And most of the action is clean, which means no gore. The action in this movie is not tension filled action, the comedy plays into the action in an intriguing way which makes the movie light hearted, yet serious.<br />  Some people claim that Robert Downey Jr. plays Sherlock Holmes in a way that he shouldn't be played. But I disagree. True, he may not play the Sherlock Holmes that we all read about but should he? If Robert Downey Jr. played that Sherlock Holmes I think that the movie would be very boring. Robert Downey Jr. adds a twist to Sherlock Holmes that cannot be paralled in the movie industry.<br />  Buy the movie or rent it from the library to see if this movie is really as good as I claim it to be. Enjoy!
B009X01C64|5.0|After trying other covers, I finally hit the jackpot!!  I love this case.  It not only serves it's purpose as a stand but it is an attractive way to cover my Kindle Fire.  The strap to hold the cover together & hand grip are perfect for reading my books.  I love it and will recommend it to all my friends.
0061950726|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  I had never heard of the orphans sent out on trains to be adopted and since I read this one I bought another one with actual true stories of people that are still with us and told their experiences.  But this novel was great and I believe based on some fact.  The characters were very lovable and I got to like the two main women very much.  Great read!

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|Got used to RPN notation in college and find it much quicker than traditional arithmetic.  This improved version of the old classic has a back space and &#34;undo&#34; feature not on the original models in addition to additional calculation functions.  Great improvements to an old friend.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|this movie is just the answer to an insomniac's rummaging through a dark dark day. it is a piece of art, that takes you into a journey through your darkest times in a way that is completely laking any pathos or pity, and is insanely detached. lovely.
B00EP0KBXM|4.0|I really enjoyed this science fiction flick. Will Smith never disappoints, and, as his son Jadan grows up he is becoming a very compelling actor in his own right. I think it's telling as to whom this film was made primarily for that Jadan received top billing in the credits. I wonder if Jadan auditioned for Ender's Game.<br /><br />It's really just a pure sci-fi action flick without a lot of moral preachiness. Yes it takes place in a future where mankind has had to survive on distant worlds because Earth became uninhabitable although from the lush biota through which Jadan's character has to travel to fulfill his mission it appears ready for resettlement. The monsters that have wreaked havoc on the remnants of humanity is a purely Shyamalin creation and really ingenious. It makes human emotion the enemy and that's the only moral that I was able to glean.<br /><br />Will's character's stoicism, that other reviewers see as dead-pan delivery, is central to the story line. Fear is what draws the monsters to humans to kill them. By controlling his emotions he is able to conquer his fear. \\"Ghosting\\" is overcoming fear to the degree that the monsters cannot see you and thus makes them vulnerable to being killed by the ghoster. It's a great plot device that I think has been used before.<br /><br />Another thing that perplexes some reviewers is the accents. What did you think of Tom Hanks' and Halle Berrie's Pidgen English in the future distopia segment of Cloud Atlas? I think in both cases we are supposed to be reminded that in the distant future people will not talk like they do now.<br /><br />To agree somewhat with some of the negative reviewers about the technology portrayed I did wonder why no high powered weaponry. If you can build space ships with warp drive why is the only weapon a high tech samurai sword? If this was explained somewhere in the movie I missed it.<br /><br />All in all a good sci-fi action flick that shows off the developing talents of Jaden Smith with a little help from Dad. Good work overall and looking forward to the next project from the family Smith.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is a great product. it's slimmer than otter box and protects better. The only downside is that my car charger no longer fit using this case. Do yourself a favor and buy the extender for a few bucks so u can continue to use your car charger.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Noise Cancellation Issue:<br />When I first connected the USB receiver and turned on the headset, Windows attempted to automatically find and install the drivers for this headset. Because of this, the proper drivers for the noise-cancellation were not installed. Friends complained that they could hear every little sound in my room and even from 2 rooms over. I thought the noise cancellation was a false advertisement until a Google search led me to some forums where someone provided the proper drivers that i had to manually install. Those who are not computer savvy might have a hard time doing this. However, once I installed it everything worked great!<br /><br />Sound:<br />Very hit and miss depending on the audio source. Not many games today support 7.1 audio and because of this you will get a loud reverb effect with some games and even simple YouTube videos with the Surround Sound turned on. Thankfully, you can turn this off but in doing this I've noticed that in some games certain sounds (mostly ambient) would be HARD-panned to either headphone which felt really weird. Need to test this more with other headphones to make sure its the headphones and not the game itself. Audiophiles might not like this headset but it is actually pretty great overall.<br /><br />Microphone: Works really well once you get the right drivers installed. The mic itself is flexible (I actually thought it was stiff until I tried folding it, what a great surprise!).<br /><br />Overall:<br />Would have been a rip-off if this remained at $150 but its now $100 which I feel is a perfect price point for what it delivers: Mobility, durability, and features. I bought this at FRYS Electronics and got them to price match it. They still had it at $140! Nice try FRYS...

B00DURHYWC|4.0|I really like PM.  The recording sound is excellent.  Musicians are great.  As with most of their other albums, it will have to grow on me a bit.  I do not have a tune that grabs me yet off this CD like Little Tomato or Splendor in the Grass did.  The bass trombone grabs me right from the first.  I was thinking, alright!. I'm going to like this.  But, alas, I enjoy listening to the music and will listen to it over and over, but so far, it doesn't thrill me as much as I had hoped.  Sometimes PM is like good wine and gets better with age.  I'm glad I have to tunes and hate to wait more years for another release.

0812550706|5.0|Orson scott cards \\"enders Game\\" is one of the most eye opening stories I have ever read. Brings to mind \\"lord of the flies\\" but with much more inner questioning of ones true motives and desires. Fantastic!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|FREE TO DOWNLOAD BUT YOU HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY. DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT GEETTING IT...SCAM, SCAM, SCAM, SCAM.SCAM. SCAM.
B006S01GH2|5.0|A wonderful film.  Eccentric and arty as it may be, it is, at its heart, just a wonderful story.  Must see.
B00F87A7HG|5.0|I'm enjoying their music - this is the first album I have purchased.  They are excellent contemporary adult musicians.  Enjoy.
1439152810|5.0|This was a great story with some twists and turns.  The characters are very well developed and the author clearly captures how key emotions such as fear, regret, and love drive the most significant decisions in our lives.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. It starts slow. Be patient.  Don't be to quick to spend the dollars that you get to start. Save them you will need them later.
1416972242|4.0|Another success for Cassandra Clare! I am thoroughly enjoying the continuing story and am sure I'm going to feel sad and empty when I finish City of Glass - it'll be a long wait until Clockwork Angel's sequel comes out. I love the story line of Clary and Jace (but especially Clary) being extra special shadowhunters. I hated the story line of Simon becoming a vampire, but then he drank Jace's blood and suddenly he's out in the sun again - all the pros of being a vampire, but none of the cons (well not the most important one). I hope he keeps the ability, but doesn't have to keep drinking special shadowhunter blood (that could be a bit inconvenient, unless he ends up permanently with Clary).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoy this book so much especially the ending. This hunger games trilogy was wonderful, it catches my attention right away and I enjoy reading every moment of it. Thank u Suzanne Collins for such a wonderful masterpiece.
B00354YA4U|3.0|I found this book really hard to read. It's only 166 pages long, but it took me about 6 weeks to read it. It had a moderately interesting blurb on the inside cover and I had wanted to read an Ian McEwan book after reading the reviews of a couple of his other books, but I kept finding more interesting books in my \\"to read\\" pile, and so what should only have taken me an afternoon to read took me 6 weeks. I'm glad I perservered, as it got me thinking about how one little thing can change peoples lives. How being unable to communicate freely can ruin a relationship. A book that makes you think about your own relationships, and whether you've said or not said something that's changed the course of a relationship with a loved one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I purely entertaining book the has that element that makes the reader keep picking up the book. The best book in the trilogy
B00FN8FCO8|5.0|Press play and step away.  Listened to the whole album from beginning to end and was left wanting to hear more.
0446547603|4.0|Another good one from Nicholas Sparks!  I have read almost all his books.  They are a good relaxing easy read.
B009738XXM|5.0|I'm not a fan of Carly Rae Jepsen but I'm surprised that I liked a lot of her songs.  I consider this a good buy.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|These people can really sing. I like playing it in my car and singing along. Same as the movie so no surprises!<br />I enjoyed it very much!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This album is awesome!  I love listening to Bob Marley and this album is a must-own for all Buffalo Soldiers - One Love Mon!
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|Saw them on SNL and the Music Awards.<br />I enjoy this disc a lot.<br />Glad I purchased it!<br />I would recommend it to others!
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|I'm not really a fan of Ellie Goulding but I'm glad I purchased this album.  I actually liked a lot of her songs.
B0063IH60K|1.0|it would get three to four stars for being your perfectly standard run of the mill solitaire, but the adds... the adds that interupt the game absolutely kill the playing experience. the adds even stop my music from playing.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Streaming speed is extremely slow when casting from a laptop browser. The result is that you really can't watch You Tube videos or other TV shows cast from a browser without constant pauses. Maybe this will get better, but if you want to purchase it in order to have an easy way to watch videos from your computer on a TV screen this function is poor quality as of now.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|This is a strong fun song to listen to. Makes you want to get up and dance and sing along.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|Michael Douglas does an excellent job of acting - he's a divorced guy and recently unemployed defense engineer trying to reach his wife's home for their young daughter's birthday. En route he's blocked by a major traffic jam and, out of frustration, decides to walk. His next encounter is at a small grocery store where he wants to get change with which to call his wife. The clerk refuses ('You have to buy something'), and when Douglas learns a can of Coca-Cola is 75 cents he goes into a rage over the high price. Then it's one frustration/challenge after another.<br /><br />Meanwhile, detective Robert Duvall is on his last day at the LAPD - he's retiring early to accede to wife's desire to move to Lake Havasu Arizona. It's also obvious he's overly henpecked, and low on the totem-pole at the police station - on desk duty because of a prior injury.<br /><br />Their paths eventually cross, and Duvall regains his status vs. his wife and the rest of the force, decides to stay on the job, and prevents Douglas from killing his wife/child as part of his rage.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Definitely a must read serious! Sizzling scenes and yet heartwarming moments! Read book 1 then absolutely had too read the next books.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Brad Pitt does a good job in this movie.  Some have been disappointments, but he has refined and defined his career.  Good story line, good actors/actresses.  I've watched it several times.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the best games that I have ever played in my whole entire life because it works out the kinks in your head that you cannot get out on your own.
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|The game is fun and challenging.  My kids enjoy playing and do not grow tired of the different levels available.
B0014C0BMU|3.0|Showed it to my daughter the other day. Yep, that fight scene with the multiple Smiths is still to long and boring and I really wish they had just stopped after the first one
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|I love this game, it should have more just like it, i been telling every one / body about it this Candy Crush.........
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is an excellent app and a great calculator for everyone to use. It is worth buying or if you can get it free all the much better.
B0031R5K68|5.0|I have said it before that I am a Dan Brown fan and this book didn't disappoint me. A good storyline, fast paced, it had me interested from the start.  A good friend is reading it at the moment and he happens to be a Mason, so I will be interested to hear his take on it. I have looked up a few things from the book on Google and yes, they are indeed real. If you are a Dan Brown fan, you will no doubt like this book, as I did.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I thought this was a really good book. I thought it wouldn't be that good when I saw it. Now that I have read and I love it
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is fun and challenging. I've played many different hidden object games and so far this one is my fave. It's not too easy or too hard I think it's just right. There's more to it then hidden objects and that's what I like most about it. There's also a story to it I like that too. I recommended it.
B009X2CRMK|4.0|Historical fiction at it's finest - love and loss, friendship and fairytales.  Set across continents and generations - a brilliant read for young and old.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app it helps me a lot I think its a great calculator app you should get it is GREAT!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its so so so so fun but it has a lot of problems and it takes so long to download. &lt;3 :).
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Loved the album and all the &#34;Special&#34; arrangments and lyrics added.<br />Vince Gill's instrumentials are awsome!!  He brought to Life old favorites with his clever picking.
B00DJ6KYWQ|5.0|Great story very well written. The usual free flowing Frosyth novel. Have waited a while for this to come. Blah for more words.....
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved the book, and once I started reading it, I didn't want to put it down. Then I didn't want it to end.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|An entertaining read with glimpses into the workings of the Federal government and a strong main character. Still, I was left with the feeling I, too, had been cheated and fooled a bit myself by what was left out of the storyline as the tale was told.
B00C1GBOU6|3.0|I played this repeatedly, hoping it would grow on me--which it did. Nevertheless, I find myself playing their other recordings out of preference.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|But really so much more.  This s not A Cancer Book, but rather a love story, with two highly intelligent and slightly snarky teenagers in the main roles.  It is one of those books that has saddened me by its ending; I want to know more (not coincidentally a main theme in the book).  Read it and love it.
0783228007|4.0|Transitional stage of firearms development and their use in the evolving western storyline at the the turn of the century.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Very good but I just found out that there are 8 book to this series,I hope it does not turn into a soap opera.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Arrived on time, well packaged, and was a fun movie to watch.  I had not seen this in theaters but the Blue Ray version on my Sony TV was eye popping.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A fantastic and well written novel. Story kept you wanting more, absolutely could not put it down! Would recommend to anyone!
