B000001F6S|5.0|Without question the most mercurial guitar playing on any album I've ever heard. Fortunately Alvin Lee has the perfect side kick in bassist Leo Lyons. Although Lee's singing isn't anything special (it improved in time), his guitar riffs are astounding in both complexity and rapidity. For a live album while the recording isn't of the greatest quality the music is devoid of the sloppiness often present in these live club recordings. This album never ceases to amaze anyone that I've recommended it to.
B000003TAW|5.0|The Blue Album, Weezer's debut, is a spectacular, simple, tuneful record that will get you hooked on this band from the very first notes.  Rivers Cuomo's songwriting is so great here that nobody else even compares, not even John Lennon.  &quot;Only In Dreams&quot; has to be one of the greatest songs ever written.  Anyway, the songs bounce with a hummable, tuneful joy rarely heard these days with all the rap-metal, nu-metal clones.  From the childhood memories of &quot;My Name Is Jonas&quot; to the high school hop of &quot;Buddy Holly,&quot; every song could well be part of the soundtrack to your life.  &quot;In The Garage&quot; pokes fun at geek culture, which the band revels in themselves, and &quot;Surf Wax America,&quot; with its classic Beach Boys-esque imagery is pure gold.
B000002JKS|4.0|Shaken 'N' Stirred is one of those albums you'll either love or hate ... there's no in between. I personally loved it. Cuts like <BR>Too Loud and Sixes and Sevens truly rock out. Robert plant showed his experimental side on this release. You may have to listen to it a couple of times to truly appreciate it. I love all of Plants stuff, but this is one of my favorites. Good music from a great artist.
B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. did not only prove a worthy successor to &quot;Ten,&quot; but the best album of Pearl Jam's career and quite possibly one of the greatest rock albums ever.  This album is truly a memorable listening experience that transcends the &quot;grunge&quot; or &quot;alternative rock&quot; categories, it is an album for everyone, and a quite life affirming one at that.  This is one album that you'll absolutely love after just a couple of listens.  Eddie Vedder's songwriting is vastly different here than on &quot;Ten.&quot;  For starters, hes so much more emotional and reaching out this time, examining life and all its frailties, and pointing out all of the many things in society that depress us, sometimes subconsciously, yet we all notice with a passing glimpse.  From the opening notes of the anthemic &quot;Go&quot; to the album's swirling closing track &quot;Indifference,&quot; all the songs paint a great picture.  Ed's ironic depiction of trigger happy jacks (&quot;Glorified G&quot;) comes across as an ironic statement about gun control.  The semi-acoustic &quot;Daughter&quot; is also a great portrait of American life.  However, the awesome tribal beats of &quot;W.M.A.&quot; (White Male American) give a great backdrop to an awesome, angry song about racism.  &quot;Rearviewmirror,&quot; with its minor-key progression has Eddie examining his troubled past life, and it is one of those songs that make you feel so free and uninhibited.  The haunting acoustic &quot;Elderly Lady Behind The Counter In A Small Town&quot; paints a picture of loneliness and human frailty that is truly touching.  Instrumentally, the band never sounded better.  With the hard-hitting rhythm guitar of Stone Gossard and Mike McCready's truly memorable lead work, the guitar playing is excellent.  Along with the rhythm section of monster bassist Jeff Ament and drummer Dave Abruzzese, the band is top notch.  Several elements here are also different than in the past, like the use of tribal rhythms and handpercussion in &quot;W.M.A&quot; or the unusual but super-cool hooks in songs like &quot;Glorified G&quot; and &quot;Rearviewmirror.&quot;  This album has it all.  It'll make you laugh, cry, and shout out loud, but most of all it will make you think.
B00004YX39|4.0|Many people panned this album when it was released. Don't believe it for one minute. Gaucho is an excellent album. &quot;My Rival&quot; and &quot;Gaucho&quot; are my favorite cuts. Steely Dan will always release great music, but if you don't include Gaucho in your collection, you'll be missing out on a great piece of music!
1573225517|4.0|I put off reading anything by Nick Hornby for years and finally I picked up this book at a discounted price and didn't put it down until I reached the last page. It's that good! Humorous, smart and so true. Hornby takes a brutal look at the average unsuccessful Joe with a dream that got sidelined by a desire to grow-up but in fact never did. All through this journey of self-exploration, we find characters that are funny, poignant and sad, trying to realise their dreams, not matter how insignificant they are in the context of our larger material world, in their own distinctly individual ways, be it reviving a career as a disc jockey, singing in a band or simply falling in love. It's such an easy and satisfying read, it's an afternoon well spent.
B00003CX8I|4.0|The title says everything. I'm looking forward to X-Men 2.
B00004Z400|5.0|This CD is great. Every song is good. Plus, this is the coolest enhanced CD I've ever seen. When, you put it into your computer, you get pictures, music, and games. It's awesome. You should definently buy this CD. You won't be disapointed.
B00000IQC8|4.0|(Insert all general, well-deserved, and standard superlatives about Kevin Smith and &quot;Clerks&quot; here).<br />As for the DVD itself, a hallmark of ANY DVD with Kevin's name on it is the excellent value for your money -- you get not only the movie, but many concominant &quot;bonus features&quot; that are fantastic enough to warrant purchasing the DVD on their presence alone.<br />Another guaranteed feature of any Kevin Smith DVD is the &quot;commentary&quot; section (although there's one minor criticism I have on this point).  Kevin, who invariably has many people connected to the movie (on-screen and off), leads a VERY funny running commentary (this applies not only to &quot;Clerks,&quot; but any DVD).  Side stories, heads-up pointers, and general analysis are all peppered with funny and insightful thoughts.  One feels almost as if you were watching a favorite movie with a bunch of friends who are making an effort to ensure that you're in on the joke.<br />(Minor criticism time:  One (unfortunate) side effect of a KS doing DVD commentary is his habit of naming what seems like each and every actor who appears on screen, no matter how minor.  It can have the effect (and at times did have the effect on the Clerks DVD) of making it feel like you were watching a home movie.  I don't care that the guy who watched Lenin's Tomb take a sandbox break owned the theater where auditions were held, nor that his wife played opposite Jeff Anderson's famous &quot;I don't appreciate your ruse&quot; scene.  Still, it's a VERY minor point in the whole big scheme of things, although I note that Kev's still doing it even as recent as the Clerks: Animated Series DVDs (those are even funnier than the &quot;Clerks&quot; DVD, by the way)).<br />Whew.  Ok, I'm done now, which leads me to wonder why I'm still typing.  I'll just click something now.
1881273156|5.0|Chapman's information is clear, simple, and practical. He uses good illustrations, and the idea really makes a difference. I'm the author of the book, Self-Help Stuff That Works, so I guess you could say I'm an expert on self-help, and this is self-help at it's finest!<br />The idea that people differ in what gets through to them, in what really makes them feel loved, is one of those that after you hear it you think, &quot;That is so obvious, I should have thought of it myself,&quot; but it had never occurred to me. I was, however, immediately able to put the idea into practice, and it made a huge difference in my marriage. I highly recommend this book. The tape is also good, and a good way to keep the basic ideas fresh in your mind while you work them into your life.
B000002UAU|4.0|The famous cover explains a lot about the Beatles' 1967 album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The cardboard cut-out images of noticeable personalities from Alistair Crowley to Marilyn Munroe to H.G. Wells to Mohammed Ali are meant to represent the Beatles' ideal audience and, although sometimes the album goes over the top, it is with the zest and spirit of perfectionism of performers entertaining those they admire most that permeates through Sgt. Pepper's. The album offers the fab four's most noticeable opening and closing tracks, most revolutionary recording techniques (Thank you, George Martin), most extravagant arrangements and, best of all, some of their greatest, most meaningful songs, all in what seems to be a battle to grab attension. <br />It is actually some of the Beatles' high ambition that makes Sgt. Pepper a step down from their previous album, Revolver. On some parts of the album the band, trying too hard to dazzle, forget that simple yet poignant songs kept simple (such as the perfect &quot;She Said She Said&quot; or &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; from the said Revolver album) are what made them great during this period of their career. Although, much of the work that would follow Sgt. Pepper's is more sprawling and complicated than previous Beatles' albums, on this album, they are still writing grade A, simple songs such as &quot;With a Little Help From My Friends&quot; and &quot;Fixing a Hole.&quot; On a few tracks the Beatles forget that that is their strength. Is a small army playing marching band and orchestral instruments needed on tracks like &quot;Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; or &quot;Good Morning, Good Morning?&quot; No and a few songs are stained by uncalled for extravagence. <br />Still, few can deny the dazzling power of the army jacketed, psychedelic Beatles heard on Sgt. Pepper's. From the lumbering kick-off to that odd noise at the end of A Day in the Life, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band creates a technicolor spectacle with words and music colorful enough to produce a Willy Wonka type series of images in a listener's mind. The core of this delicious ear candy is the core of the Beatles' truth-seeking ideals (on songs such as &quot;With a Little Help from My Friends&quot; and the Buddhist inspired &quot;Within You Without You&quot;) and thus, the idealism of the culture they were now leading. Songs about a better perspective in life (&quot;Getting Better&quot;), running away (&quot;She's Leaving Home&quot;) and optimism towards the inevitable process of aging (&quot;When I'm 64&quot;) show that Sgt. Pepper's was not just a performance for a bunch of elites, but a valentine for lonely hearts everywhere. Ignore all the overextravagance and remember that the zest of a band performing for their heroes and writing songs with messages for those who consider them heroes was what defined Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. <br />On a side note, I want to disagree with the amazon.com review, which exclaimed, &quot;Before Sgt. Pepper, no one seriously thought of rock music as actual art. That all changed in 1967,&quot; and similar sentiments. The fact is popular music was an art form and considered such by those paying close attention to it before Sgt. Pepper's was released. Bob Dylan undertook his masterful transition from folk to popular music in 1965. Two superior albums from the Beatles themselves, Rubber Soul and Revolver were released in 1965 and 1966, respectively. Everything from Frank Zappa's satirical rock and the Beach Boy's shining pop perfectionism was in its prime before 1967. Developments in rock as artistically credible as Jimi Hendrix's mastery of the electric guitar, Jim Morrison's dark vission and the Velvet Underground's gritty poetry were underway before Sgt. Pepper's created any ripples, too. Many would consider the mastery of the swaggering rockabilly tune by Chuck Berry or the mastery of gritty blues song by Willie Dixon, displayed more than ten yearsbefore Sgt. Pepper's, the essence of pop artistry, as well. Rock and roll was not just kid stuff, but a blossoming art form, long before Sgt. Pepper's was released. The album was not the first artistically credible work in rock history but, with its high production cost, conceptual tilt, state of the art recording process and its own artistic credibility, the brightest beacon of rock's artistic maturity.
B000002UR7|4.0|Released in 1993, Pablo Honey gives us an early guitar-driven version of Radiohead thats quite good at times but doesn't achieve the level of genius found on The Bends and OK Computer. You can hear the origins of the band's incredible sound emerging on this disc but it's a little underdeveloped compared to the full-blown genius of later efforts. Pablo Honey is a good disc any way you approach it &amp; I would say it's above average in it's genre but it's an early look at a band who wouldn't hit their stride for a couple of more years. If you're new to the Radiohead universe and are looking for a disc to start with, get The Bends, an undeniable masterpiece that achieves the perfect marriage of the band's straight-on rock side and their taste for things dark &amp; experimental. Follow that with OK Computer and pick up Pablo Honey later when you want to fill out your Radiohead collection.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Everyone has seen the movie, so this review is mainly pertaining to the DVD itself.  First of all, despite what was previously written, the audio quality is fantastic.  I am a big fan of DTS, and always buy DTS whenever it is available, but this is the best Dolby Digital soundtrack I have ever heard.  It makes tremendous use of the surrounds, and gives a very spatial feel.  The center channel seems a bit underutilized at times, but it is not terribly distracting.  Secondly, the picture quality is also very, very good.  It looks as good as anything I have ever seen, and is very sharp and fluid.  Finally, the extra features alone make this disc worthwhile.  There are lots of neat extras and some pretty cool hidden features as well. Overall, this is an excellent reference DVD for showing off your system.  I only hope that the first three episodes are released with comparable audio and video quality if possible.
B000006L8P|5.0|A wonderful collection that demonstrates The Beatle's at their absolutely energetic best!  If you're disappointed by the sound quality of such recordings as Live In Hamburg, or At The Star Club, then you'll really like Live At The BBC.<br />Many of these songs are previously unreleased, buy any true hard core Beatles fan will find this to be a necessary addition to their collection.
6300216268|5.0|I bought Harold and Maude after being unable to rent this gem of a film at the local video store.  I had not seen the film since high school ... as an adult I found the film even more captivating.  The score with original songs by Cat Stevens create a wonderful message to the movie, and the acting by Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort is magical.  Unlike movies today, this film does not rely on Hollywood gimicks and heavy production technique, but rather takes a great story and creates a moving movie experience.  One of my favorites of all time.
B000006TRV|5.0|basically music is the center of my line of work...that said, I take it very seriously and I feel safe in assuming I listen to more music in a year than most people do in a lifetime...in a world where the words &quot;legendary&quot; and &quot;masterpiece&quot; are certainly used much too often it is hard to discern true greatness from simple hype...I choose these words very carefully in reference to art/music and in the case of music I can surely count less than 10 truly legendary artists within the classic rock/rock genre of post 1960...the group Pink Floyd is on that list and this album is a true piece of art that can be called a masterpiece...If you are a true music lover and your preference is classic rock then you will own this album at some point in your life-even if you think you won't, eventually you will in one form or another...it is almost inevitable...so I feel no need to say &quot;buy this album&quot; or &quot;you must own this&quot; because I know that if you appreciate this type of music it will find you long before you find it...in time, the true legends always shine above the rest and their light does not fade, it only grows stronger...and you will learn to appreciate this at some point in your life...so one day you will be driving down the road late at night on your way home and you will pop this cd in the radio and you will say to yourself &quot;this group has true greatness&quot;...and you will understand...few have indeed reached this level of musical art, I believe Led Zeppelin have in their own way along with certainly the Beatles and the Rolling Stones...and only a very select few other than this...in my opinion it can only be explained by simply saying works of art such as The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, the White Album, Exile on Main Street, Led Zep IV, etc. are what other musicians in this field will always aspire to and compare their life's achievements against...as artists do in regards to the mona lisa or athletes will in regards to Michael Jordan...and on a final note, I will predict that one day many many years from now the works from the likes of Pink Floyd, the Beatles, Led Zeppelin, John Lennon, and the Rolling Stones will be at the very top of the list of most sold music on the earth...you must understand it is inevitable...they will truly shine on...
B00004Z459|3.0|Catchy rock riffs and great singing by Bennigton make the album.  Its no SOAD but it doesnt attempt to be.<br />The rapping has to go though and although unlikely, if the songwriters and Bennigton boot Young MC they'll be much better for it.<br />Not a fan of Limp and talentless Fred but even Durst raps better than this.  Its like out of a Taco Bell commercial.  Or Blondie's &quot;Rapture.&quot;  (Man from Mars, eating cars gibberish for those born after 1980)
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room For Squares is actually John's sophomore album, and his first major label release. His honest thoughtful lyrics and superb musicianry (I think I just made up that word...but it means hes a super talented musician) contribute to the success of this CD. I love singing along to any and all of the songs on Room For Sqaures and it's perfect for anytime of the day, and it has only left my CD player to be put into other people's!
B00003CX5P|5.0|I wait for this DVD 2 years.  The Spanish audio is excellent too.<BR>The quality of the picture and sounds is very good.

Better late than never, but this work is the best at this time.  We wait for the other movies (episode 4 to 6)on DVD.<BR>Zomar.
B000002KAG|5.0|I love this disc.  Most people talk of it being commercial, but in 1967 most bands were in it for the money.  To get a record deal back then was like finding a huge bag of weed.  I think they were not ready for the studio, but they did manage to get thru the sessions with some of their best music of the time.  Although, they were recorded in &quot;single&quot; format, they were blueprints for their live shows.  That is what made them so fun.  You would never know where a song would go, or what would all of a sudden pop up in there.  That's one reason why I loved to see them live.  Most concerts you hear them sounding &quot;just like the album&quot;.  Well just sit home and listen to the album.  The magic is where a band can play off each other AND the audience.
B0000027F3|5.0|Today 11 years after the release of &quot;Painkiller&quot; you still love this album. I began to love Judas in the middle 80s and had &quot;British Steel&quot; from 1980 as my favourite album. In 1990 when &quot;Painkiller&quot; came, I at first thought it was to heavy to be Judas but after a while I realized that this masterpiece probably is the best album ever done in Heavy Metal. Its recorded in an old Castle in France and you can almost hear and feel the athmosphere on the album. &quot;Painkiller&quot; is the Ultimate Heavy-Metal album ever been made. My opinion is that in Heavy Metal theres only one album who can compete with &quot;Painkiller&quot; and thats &quot;Operation Mindcrime&quot; with Queensryche from 1987. But &quot;Painkiller&quot; is outstanding. Straight on a howl, one of a kind............................
B00005KHL0|4.0|The film that not only put John Carpenter on the map and instantaneously declared actress Jamie Lee Curtis as a superstar in her first roll as the resourceful babysitter who is chased by the killer on Halloween night, but also opened new doors for the viable and successful genre, Halloween, despite it being released over twenty-years-ago, remains to be a cult favorite that'll-in addition to its brothers-still be swiped off shelves during the month of October, as it remains to be the standard to which all other modern horror films are measured. There is just something about it that entices me to see it on every Halloween night. Perhaps because the presence of the all-most powerful and pitiless Michael Myers, who, as we know, neither feels pain nor has any compassion amongst others whatsoever; he even shows that he has great fondness for death, as he tilts his head sideways and watches his victims' time decomposing virtually each time he's done with them. (As Dr. Loomis said, this killer truly is nothing but pure evil, and it now is clear to us that he meant that literally!) And perhaps because of the film's spooky music that has yet been played in every other sequel that followed? Or, simply, perhaps because it takes place in Halloween? All I know is that Halloween night just wouldn't be the same without it, regardless of how many times it's been watched and how predictable it has now become. It's like when you play a really great video game that you have beaten several times and yet continue to play-you know where all of the villains are hiding, but continue to play it for the sheer pleasure of blowing their brains away.<br />Produced for very little amount of money and a tight shooting schedule, Carpenter and longtime producer Debra Hill-who too was put on the map-must have had no idea of just how big of a hit they were going to have on their hands here, but once it was released, the results were staggering.<br />Halloween is possibly the most influential and successful independent film ever to be made. It's an all-time classic that not only declared these fine people as worthy filmmakers but also introduced what has now become one of the world's most eminent psychotic killers of all time. We see Michael Myers lurking in the shadows and gradually revealing his ghostly appearance behind those frightened ones who'll without a doubt fall as another victim to his violent disorder if do not get a move on, or we see him pretending to have been conquered by his opponents, only to get right back up again for some more heart-pounding suspense, and we love it. We can't get enough of it, and that's because Halloween has the quality many other horror films lack in.ssful independent film ever to be made.

6305657947|5.0|I normally make it a point to never watch either sequels or re-makes but the Thomas Crown Affair (TCA) with Pierce Brosnan &amp; Rene Russo is the rare case of the re-make being way better than the original (Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway).  This is a movie that is cerebral and keeps you guessing, while at the same time being great fun.  This is a movie that is elegant and crisp; one is hard pressed to find a wasted moment.  This is a movie to savor again and again. I will not dwell on the story to avoid being a spoiler (In a sentence, a painting is stolen brilliantly by Brosnan and Russo is on his trail) and for that matter, the story line is really besides the point. The key here is the battle of wits between two masters of their respective arenas. Each lives for the thrill of what they do and each respects the other as a worthy adversary - the song Windmills of your Mind is perfectly in place here. Pierce Brosnan is his usual relaxed mix of languid ease and coiled tension spring, sticking his neck out and running with the wind. Hard as it is to compete with Brosnan who gets the best lines in the movie, Rene Russo comes off very well indeed as insurance investigator Catherine Banning. She prowls through the movie like a cat, sensual and predatory in turn. So strong are Brosnan and Russo in fact that the rest of the cast appears lackluster in comparison. TCA is a viewing delight as well with its swift changes of scene from city to country to glorious island. For me the only let down was the stereotyping of Russo as the standard jealous female towards the end, totally at odds with her character till then. Also the ending was a little too cute; but then to be fair, I cannot for the life of me think of a better alternative. A superb movie, highly recommended.

0871137380|5.0|What I was not prepared for was the really astute analysis of events that he offers, particularly in his Epilogue.  Here he makes a series of vital points, several of which concern the manner in which the mission was carried out, but two of which are broader : first, that the mission succeeded.  Yes, there was a cost, but when you strip away everything else, the fact remains that this relatively small group of U.S. soldiers was able to complete its mission despite meeting unexpectedly massive and determined resistance.  Mind you this was urban warfare, which we well understand to present some of the most difficult circumstances imaginable.  While we did lose eighteen men and four helicopters (two at the scene, two back at the command base), it is nonetheless truly remarkable that approximately 150 men of the Rangers, SEALs, and Delta Forces were essentially able to fight off thousands of hostile enemy for an entire day and a night, before being rescued the next day by a large multi-national force.  From a purely Special Forces viewpoint, the mission was indeed a success.<br />One of the great services that Bowden's book has provided is just to restore this understanding.  He recounts how the men who fought this battle returned home to face blank stares when they mentioned it.  Most folks had never heard of it and those who had, who remembered only the searing image of American casualties being dragged through the streets by the Somali mob, assumed the mission had been a debacle.  Rather, as Bowden writes :<br />  No matter how critically history records the policy that led up to this fight, nothing can diminish<br />  the professionalism and dedication of the Rangers and Special Forces units who fought there that<br />  day.<br />Considering the missions that they are being called on to fulfill now and for the foreseeable future, it is well for us all to realize that and for them to take pride in their service, even in incidents, like this one, which make the politicians squeamish.<br />The second really insightful point that Bowden makes is that while we went into Somalia thinking that its people must want peace, this proved not to be the case.  What started as simply a humanitarian effort to get food to the starving (in the closing days of the Bush Administration) soon turned into an effort to impose peace between warring clans.  We believed, in our naivet&eacute;, that this was what the people of Somalia wanted.  Instead, as an unnamed State Department official told Bowden :<br />  Somalia was the experience that taught us that people in these places bear much of the responsibility<br />  for things being the way they are.  The hatred and the killing continues because they want it to.  Or<br />  because they don't want peace enough to stop it.<br />There is an important lesson to be learned from this fact, one that it is not at all clear that we have learned : peace in the middle of a war is much harder to maintain than the peace imposed after the war.  When, repeatedly throughout the 20th Century, we have tried to bring about peace before the armies in the field have been destroyed--WWI, WWII (where the Soviets were left intact), Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, Somalia, Bosnia--the legacy is pretty clear : it doesn't work.  On the other hand, when, as in the case of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, we have utterly destroyed our enemies, we have been able to rebuild peaceful allies in their stead.  If we are going to continue to intervene in the wars of others, particularly in civil wars, it seems obvious that we need to choose one side or the other and then completely destroy the opposition.<br />Make no mistake either, this is a choice that is available to us.  The failure to annihilate our foes has not been a function of our inability to do so but of our unwillingness to do so.  In this regard, Bowden writes about the perceptions of one Delta Force sergeant, Paul Howe  :<br />  Victory was for those willing to fight and die.  Intellectuals could theorize until they sucked their<br />  thumbs right off their hands, but in the real world, power still flowed from the barrel of a gun. If<br />  you wanted the starving masses of Somalia to eat, then you had to out-muscle men like this Aidid,<br />  for whom starvation worked. You could send in your bleeding-heart do-gooders, you could hold<br />  hands and pray and sing hootenanny songs and invoke the great gods CNN and BBC, but the only<br />  way to finally open the roads to the big-eyed babies was to show up with more guns. And in this<br />  real world, nobody had more or better guns than America.<br />American failures have been a result of the refusal to use those guns.  This refusal may be appropriate, but it does lead to failure and ultimately costs American lives, because the refusal generally only comes after we're already involved.  We head off to these foreign lands and get embroiled in their unfamiliar quarrels, often because of the pictures we see on CNN or the BBC, and at the behest of the Kumbaya-singers, but, once there, find that we lack the brutality and determination that would be required to solve the problems we find there.<br />We would all, of course, prefer that such conflicts would yield to peaceful resolution, that warring parties would set down their arms and stop fighting.  But it is unrealistic to expect them to do so.  And peace, though a laudable goal, can not be the primary aim of warfare; victory must be.  Where, as in Somalia and Bosnia, we are unable or unwilling to choose between equally repellent contestants, we should just stay out altogether.<br />In Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden manages to tell a genuinely thrilling story and at the same time illustrate fundamental points about what America's unparalleled fighting forces can and can not do.  The book, like all the best books about the reality of warfare, is timeless, but its lessons are particularly timely today, as we send such men off to fight in other foreign lands, for it is not at all clear that we are willing to continue this fight until the enemy, rightly understood, is destroyed.  If all it will take is one incident like this for us to get cold feet, then it is better not to go at all.  Men like those who fought and won the Battle of the Black Sea are more than willing to go to war when their country calls on them, but they want an opportunity to win the war, not just one battle.  As Bowden says of the men he interviewed :<br />  I was struck by how little bitterness there is among the men who underwent this ordeal.  What anger<br />  exists relates more to the decision to call off the mission the day after the battle than anything that<br />  happened during it.<br />Such anger is justified and understandable.  Let us give them no reason to feel the same way at the end of their next mission.<br />GRADE : A+nd die.  Intellectuals could theorize until they sucked their <BR>    thumbs right off their hands, but in the real world, power still flowed from the barrel of a gun. If <BR>    you wanted the starving masses of Somalia to eat, then you had to out-muscle men like this Aidid, <BR>    for whom starvation worked. You could send in your bleeding-heart do-gooders, you could hold <BR>    hands and pray and sing hootenanny songs and invoke the great gods CNN and BBC, but the only <BR>    way to finally open the roads to the big-eyed babies was to show up with more guns. And in this <BR>    real world, nobody had more or better guns than America. <br />American failures have been a result of the refusal to use those guns.  This refusal may be appropriate, but it does lead to failure and ultimately costs American lives, because the refusal generally only comes after we're already involved.  We head off to these foreign lands and get embroiled in their unfamiliar quarrels, often because of the pictures we see on CNN or the BBC, and at the behest of the Kumbaya-singers, but, once there, find that we lack the brutality and determination that would be required to solve the problems we find there. <br />We would all, of course, prefer that such conflicts would yield to peaceful resolution, that warring parties would set down their arms and stop fighting.  But it is unrealistic to expect them to do so.  And peace, though a laudable goal, can not be the primary aim of warfare; victory must be.  Where, as in Somalia and Bosnia, we are unable or unwilling to choose between equally repellent contestants, we should just stay out altogether. <br />In Black Hawk Down, Mark Bowden manages to tell a genuinely thrilling story and at the same time illustrate fundamental points about what America's unparalleled fighting forces can and can not do.   The book, like all the best books about the reality of warfare, is timeless, but its lessons are particularly timely today, as we send such men off to fight in other foreign lands, for it is not at all clear that we are willing to continue this fight until the enemy, rightly understood, is destroyed.  If all it will take is one incident like this for us to get cold feet, then it is better not to go at all.  Men like those who fought and won the Battle of the Black Sea are more than willing to go to war when their country calls on them, but they want an opportunity to win the war, not just one battle.  As Bowden says of the men he interviewed : <br />    I was struck by how little bitterness there is among the men who underwent this ordeal.  What anger <BR>    exists relates more to the decision to call off the mission the day after the battle than anything that <BR>    happened during it. <br />Such anger is justified and understandable.  Let us give them no reason to feel the same way at the end of their next mission. <br />GRADE : A+
B00005OB0A|5.0|This latest album from Kylie Minogue is full of dancealicous tunes that are very different to &quot;Light Years.&quot;  They are very Modjo/Daft Punk/Spiller, with a few 80s influences too.  Kylie's divine voice is ever present, though often tainted by a vocoder.  Nevertheless, the melodies are excellent, although there is a little filler. (More More More, Dancefloor)  <br />The worldwide (except for the US) smash smash smash hit &quot;Can't Get You Outta My Head&quot; (No. 1 in 25 countries across Europe and Asia) is here, plus the soon to be hit singles &quot;Love at first sight&quot; &quot;Fever&quot; and the amazing &quot;In Your Eyes.&quot;  You will love this album is you have loved Kylie's previous work or modern dance catchy pop dance stuff that is a bit different.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I listen to this CD constantly.  The rhythms, diversity of songs, and India Arie's beautiful, rich voice make listening to this album a rewarding experience.  It is also an inducer of good moods, and the lyrics of her songs are down to earth and meaningful.
1563890119|4.0|This first arc presents the main character of the series: The Sandman. There is not a real description of Morpheus. However, as the story goes, conjectures are formed in the reader's mind about the lord of Dreams and his world. Neil Gaiman has a interesting way to weave tales and some people might not like it (I doubt it, though). Although this is not the best of the Sandman's arcs, I would advise you to read it, before starting to read the whole series... It is truly far from been a bad story!
B00003CXDZ|5.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; has got to be one of, if not the greatest, movie ever made.  OK, so the story's simple, but the film is so strong it doesn't matter.<br />Superb acting, brilliant songs (and singing), amazing visuals, and a great feeling throughout.  The film picks you up, takes you on a rollercoaster ride, and drops you off at the end.<br />Having read many reviews of MR, I find it very hard to accept the (very few) people who criticise it.  Either they are totally braindead, or have absolutely no imagination.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; is superb.  That's the only word to sum it up.  An amazing piece of film-making. If this doesn't win an Oscar, there's no justice in the world.<br />Well done Baz, well done Nicole, well done Ewan, in fact well done all concerned.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; is... amazing.

0140288503|5.0|I read Black Hawk Down just before the WTC bombing.  This is an outstanding book about men at war: the American army against an unorganized, but well armed mob of Somalis -- men, women, and children -- in Mogadishu in 1993.     <br />     What grabbed my attention was that the Americans sowed the seeds of their own destruction. The Somalis, the author details, came to hate the American rangers.  For months, the U.S. army had patrolled the city of Mogadishu, swooping down in black helicopters to terrify and intimidate the local population.  They rocketed Somali buidings, killing both clan leaders and innocent people.  The wash from the rotors of their hovering helicopters pulled tin roofs off Somali houses, ripped clothing off Somali women --even pulled babies out of of the arms of Somali mothers. When the opportunity presented itself -- a Black Hawk helicopter down and a small isolated ranger force surrounded -- the Somalis extracted a terrible revenge.    <BR>  <BR>      On one level, this is a gung-ho book of skilled, courageous American soldiers blasting their way out of an unfriendly city, losing a few men in the process but inflicting terrible casualties on their opponents.  18 U.S. soldiers were killed; at least 500 Somalis died. But the Somalis won the battle -- and the war.       <br />     On another level, this is a cautionary tale of how not to make war by alienating the people you have come to help -- and a blueprint for terrorists and sleazy warlords who want to learn how to defeat the United States.  The astonishing superiority of the American military to any other on earth can be countered by inflicting a few casualties on the Americans, whereupon they will alter their battle plan and abandon their military objectives to rescue their fallen colleagues, dead and alive.  Take a thousand casualties to inflict one, the warlords might conclude.  If you bloody their noses, the Americans will quit and go home.                        <BR>    <BR>     As it embarks on a dangerous and uncertain course of action in Afghanistan, the U.S. must heed the lessons learned in Somalia.  Black Hawk Down is a good book about waging modern war.
079073463X|4.0|A profound mideval legend brought to the big screen.  An attractive cast and anachronistic but compelling dialogue.<br />An okay soundtrack--sort of out of place, but not completely.<br />
B00005IBGQ|4.0|I wish I could get &quot;Poses&quot; out of my CD player! Maybe other Rufus fans could help me wean myself off of it for, like, a week? MTV(2) can't be all that bad--otherwise I would have never discovered &quot;California&quot; and this terrific album. &quot;April Fools&quot; was picked up, turned over, and then tossed aside by some radio stations in my area, but Wainwright truly fills the true music lover's appetite for well-written piano-driven tunes and leaves it craving for another helping. I can't write this review without expressing myself inadequately, but I must say this. If you have feared that brilliant, literate, accessible pop (and all those words can be used together) is all but extinct, give &quot;Poses&quot; a try. It just might get permanently stuck in your stereo.
B000002P6R|5.0|Face Dances is certainly one of the Who's best albums.  There really isn't a weak track to be heard, only a variety of great songs that keep the listener engaged from beginning to end.  It's smooth without being trite and substantial without being pretentious or overly experimental.  It's just plain old good rock music. <br />The most recognizable song is the hit You'd Better You'd Bet - perhaps a bit overplayed - but then I guarantee you the rest of these songs aren't .  The b-side when this song was released as a single was The Quiet One.  This is the b-side that should have been the a-side.  What a fantastic song!  Writen by John Entwistle, it was enough to inspire me to buy his solo album Smash Your Head Against the Wall, which is another great find.  The Quiet One speaks volumes and constitutes one of the most definitive moments of the Who's career. <br />Unlike on some re-releases, the extra tracks here are composed of previously unreleased material that should have been available long ago.  The live version of How Can You Do It Alone bears almost no resemblance to the studio version on the album.  This song started out as an onstage jam during the 1979 tour.  Fascinating listening indeed.<br />I could go through the whole disc song by song and try to pinpoint what makes each of them great but what would be the point?  There are no real objective criteria that define the difference between good and bad rock music.  It all comes down to personal taste in the end.  The worrisome thing is that personal taste is easily influenced by things like the absence of Keith Moon.  Or the fact that the Who were no longer a revolutionary new groundbreaking band by the time this album came out.  Some might dismiss Face Dances as second rate simply because of these things.  Nothing of this sort is relevant to the music at hand, however, so you can rest assured that Face Dances is up there with Who's Next and Quadrophenia as one of this band's best releases.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Look, plain and simple----&gt; Dream Theater has the best musicians.  Hard to have a BAD concert when you have a drummer who ranks along the lines of Lars Ulrich from Metallica, guitarist who also played at the G3 tour- (I saw it live, it blew me away), a keyboardist who played with Yngwie Malmsteen, and a singer who took lessons from an opera coach, not to mention they are all UC Berkley Music School Graduates.  They sound as good live as they do in the recording studio, and what a show!  A MUST buy!
0783240236|4.0|&quot;The Birds,&quot; which was Hitchcock's follow-up to &quot;Psycho,&quot; is a creepy tale about a woman who travels to Bodega Bay, meets up with a love interest, and encounters a series of vicious bird attacks.  The film doesn't explain where these birds come from or why they attack, but this is a film that doesn't require logic or deep thought.  Despite its otherwise flimsy plot, &quot;The Birds&quot; still has the stuff to scare the wits out of you, and it has earned its status as a horror classic.  Also, be sure to check out the features, which include a documentary and trailers.  My only complaint is that a film like this would be much more effective in 5.1 surround sound, but it's instead presented in mono.  Still, &quot;The Birds&quot; should be among your first purchases if you're looking to start a Hitchcock collection.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Atlanta native John Mayer could be from anywhere and look like anybody. He voices many of the feelings and insecurities that many of us feel. In his album &quot;Room for Squares&quot; he gives you an impulse to dance, cry, or smile. It is such a rare quality for an aritst to write with such honesty and candesness about life. Sometimes it's down right humorous. In the song 83 he sings about the inosence of childhood and how he wishes he had it again. Then he laments about his lost lunch box. In &quot;My Stupid Mouth&quot; he sings about saying something completely stupid to a girl. I mean c'mon who hasn't that happened too?  The first track to the album, &quot;No Such thing&quot; is about takeing life and running with it. Follow your dreams and everything will work out. If you ask me (and who wouldn't want to ask a first time reviewer about music) the theme of the album is simply Life...take what ya got and make it yours.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is a great novel that is a lovely satirical work.  It involves many characters with extraordinary personalities but the one that it centers around is Yossarian.  He is a witty man that is constantly trying not to be killed while serving his duty in <BR>WW II.  He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early on in the book and uses the phrase that yields the books title.  Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that one will be sent home if they are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat.   The doc tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then most have someone vouch for him.  Yossarian then assumes that one would be able to be let go if they go through that but the Doc adds one more stipulation.  He says that if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy they can't be crazy because anyone that doesn't want to die must be sane.  This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase catch-22 actually was put in the dictionary because of this book.  If that does not show how important or impressionistic this book was on its time I don't know what will. <BR> This book is funny from beginning to end.  It shows another side of war.  Most books don't refer to the human struggle inside a war but to the battles that the war consists of.  Catch-22 uses humor to show how the struggle between one's self and his own people affect him in war.  This book shows many people how war can affect someone in more ways than one. <BR>I really enjoyed this book and think that it is a must read.  One reason that makes this book just a little better than others is the fact that it has been banned.  The fact that people actually cared enough about this book to ban it means there has to be something good in it.  This book was banned because it refers to women as whores.  This book does not dwell on that though.  If one really was offended by that they could just as easily substitute another termssuch as \\"elegant young lady\\" in for whore.  The bottom line is if you want to read a great book that will make you laugh you definitely should read  Catch-22.

B00005R87Q|4.0|That's a pretty good movie. I liked watching it on my chinese DVD. But you gonna like it only, if you are a racing fan. If you like hearing engine sounds such as in DRIVEN or GONE IN 60 SECONDS, you'll like this one. --&gt; The soundtrack is fantastic (Ja Rule...)
B00005QG9J|5.0|this is an exceptional album from a frighteningly talented band. it starts out very mellow but climbs and crashes up and down. morning view is somewhat of a departure from make yourself, but i love them both. i doubt this is going to leave anyone disappointed.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This had to be one of the silliest, most predictable, lowbrow movies I've ever seen. That said, I have to say that if you can withstand the barrage of bad plot choices, badly scripted lines, complete lack of any serious emotion, Angelina Jolie is definitely a cutie.<br />Unfortunately, I can't lower myself to seeing a movie simply because the lead actress is hot. Most people can, I suppose, and that's cool. Personally, I wouldn't waste my time or money on this movie.<br />I do hope I see Jolie in many movies in the future, though.
0380973650|4.0|I dare you not to like it!  Finally, a Neil Gaiman book that rivals even his masterpiece THE SANDMAN.  Dark, twisted, poignant:  AMERICAN GODS is a journey through the world's largest melting pot of history &amp; culture.  &amp; what a trip!  Rare is the author (&amp; his tale!) who can take you so far that what you see in paper comes to life &amp; moves you.  If you are to read only one post-SANDMAN novel of Gaiman's, let it be this.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento was my favorite film last year, and I was very happy to finally find a film that wasn't Planet of the Apes, Tomb Raider, or The Mummy 2. This film is much, much better than any other action movie put out last year. It really makes every other film I saw last year look hollow and boring.<br />Aspects of the film that I enjoyed were the uncertainty of which reality was being experienced at different times, the nature of the lead character's strong, yet easily-manipulated personality, and the many questions that are left up to the viewer to answer for him or herself. I believe the characteristic of this movie that is most engaging is the subtlety with which aspects of the plot unfold. Subtlety is in very short supply in modern movies, and I was happy to see that it played a very large part in Memento.<br />The actors gave excellent performances. Solid, two-sides-to-each-decision roles that make you empathize with them, and yet sometimes you are reviled by them.<br />The best film of the year last year, and I applaud them for making it.
B000002P7R|5.0|\\"South Saturn Delta\\" can be a tough listen if you're expecting to put in some Jimi and listen to your favorite Hendrix songs flow smoothly from one to another. This is not the case here. \\"...Delta\\" assembles fifteen tracks from demo recordings to finished masters, the guitarist's wide range of blues, slow ballads, rock, and jazz fusion is experienced throughout the CD. These fifteen diverse recordings provide a opportunity to look into a window and see one of the most fertile minds in the music history. This is also why \\"...Delta\\" can be a difficult listen at times. The songs and styles do not flow from one to another smoothly. In fact, they crash into each other like a very bad day of crosstown traffic.<br />To fully appreciate \\"...Delta\\", one must have an open mind. You can actually close your eyes and get the sensation had Jimi is jamming in your garage, and garage recordings are a fair assessment of the material here. It is very much like an unstructured jam session where Jimi just does whatever he wants to do from track to track. That is the brilliance of this collection of recordings, that is the genius that was Jimi Hendrix. He changes direction at the pace of a hummingbird.<br />\\"South Saturn Delta\\" is not the first choice in Jimi Hendrix's music for the common man. It is more appropriately suited for those folks who'd be quite comfortable letting Jimi hang out and play in their garage or basement. Just don't let the CD lie in there collecting dust. PLAY IT, PLAY IT LOUD!
B000055ZB8|5.0|I'm just getting into German expressionist movies, and Nosferatu is by far the most genious movie I've seen thus far. I have to admit that this is the only version and adaption of Nosferatu I've seen. Now I'm looking for the raw, original and untouched version. That means, without recomposed music and without improved images... Does anyone know a way for me to obtain that version? And then I have another question. I read once about 'the first horrormovie ever made'. It was also a vampiremovie and dated back to 1896 and was described in a Amzazon.com review of Nosferatu...but I'm not able to find that review anymore. If there's anyone who's got an idea of how I can get that movie, please e-mail me or something!!!...I will be looking for it my entire life...

At first i only liked a few songs once i listened, but i decided to see how i felt after listening without &quot;analysing.&quot; Well Incubus definetely created a superb cd, and have gone done a more experimental road, with many more wonderful effects and melodic tunes.<BR>my favourite track would be Aqueous Transmission- simply because of the relaxing and lovely oriental feel to it.<BR>Other standout tracks would be &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Mexico&quot;, &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; and &quot;Circles.&quot;<BR>All I can say is well done Incubus on such an incredible album.

0440180295|5.0|This book describes war, as it should be depicted. That soulless horrific unstoppable force that rolls on forever destroying everything in its path. Billy Pilgrim is described as a bee in amber who can do nothing but exist in a world he cannot control (This metaphor can of course be extended the entire human race.)  Vonnegut uses the aliens and Billy Pilgrim's time travel to show the futility of trying to stop war.  The aliens while they know all about war and even the destruction of the universe do nothing to stop it because it is just the way of things. So it goes. This phrase used throughout the book seems to say what difference does it really make we are all going to die anyway.  Also especially interesting is the time travel for instance at one point Billy Pilgrim sees a bombing in reverse order.  He sees the planes take back the bombs and stop the fires, he sees the bombs being disassembled, and finally he sees the raw materials hidden into the mountain where they can't hurt anyone anymore. So it goes. The irony that permeates Billy's experiences is not only dogmatic but also well developed in this classic work of fiction.

Oh and no one has ever made easier riddles than jim carry in this movie.
B000056K04|1.0|A lot of negative things have been said about this album, so I won't ramble on too much.  Bottom line is that the pairing of producer Glen Ballard and DMB is one of the worst ideas in the history of rock.  Ballard is good at what he does in the pop arena, but he's not right for a grassroots type band like DMB.  It's like replacing Led Zeppelin's Peter Grant with Barry Gordy.  It just doesn't work!  Bring back Lillywhite plain and simple.  Lillywhite tends to foster creativity, musicianship, etc. by allowing the artist to explore for themselves...Ballard just dictates things to make money.  <br />I have a copy of the Lillywhite sessions, the album that was scrapped in favor of Everyday, and it (the Lillywhite sessions) is some of the best songwriting and playing I've heard the band pull off.  In fact it follows the trend that &quot;Before These Crowded Streets&quot; initiated, which was fresh and solid song construction coupled with incredible playing.  It's true that on the first 3 DMB releases the band could be a little sloppy, but since &quot;Before These...&quot; they have really pushed themselves technically, musically, and artistically.  That is evident on the Lillywhite sessions.  Too bad it will never see the light of day.<br />One thing that Everyday does have going for it (this is where it gets its 1 star) is that all the songs are new.  Aside from the original indie release, this is the first album to include an entirely new library of songs.  &quot;Under The Table...&quot;, &quot;Crash&quot;, &quot;Before These...&quot; all contained material that was written before the group was signed to a major label.<br />However, no matter how many new songs are on Everyday it won't change the fact that it is a weak album recorded in only a few rushed  months.  I hope these guys can turn things around, take control of their creative process, and come back with the album we all know they are capable of.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Well...I JUST bought this cd and I can only say one word: awesome.  I have liked incubus since they put out S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and own all of their albums.  The reason that I like incubus is that they have all of the great stuff that limp bizkit and rage against the machine have, but they actually know how to write great songs that make good use of their talents.  My favorite song on this album is blood on the ground.  Other great ones are circles, nice to know you, and just a phase.  I highly recommend this album to any rock or metal fan.
B000051VWW|4.0|After checking out THE BEST OF SADE I thought I'd give LOVERS ROCK a try. As I said before, I'm not a huge Sade fan but I enjoyed her best of collection. After listening to LOVERS ROCK I was impressed. Sade is an excellent R&amp;B singer and LOVERS ROCK is a simple, relaxing, stripped down R&amp;B album. It's loaded with soft acoustic guitar sounds and bass heavy beats. Sade's vocals are in top form here. Her voice is still smooth and romantic as ever. The songs are simple, both lyrically and overall production.
B000002UA5|4.0|This 1969 release was made shortly after the departure of songwriting genius and guitarist Syd Barrett, the original founder of Pink Floyd. Written and recorded in the time frame of Syd's loss of sanity and leaving the band to when bassist and vocalist Roger Waters essentially took over in leading the band, it shows the band in one of it's most transitional phases. Unfortunately, Barrett's presence and influence aren't felt as much on this double album, even though he wrote the first live track, &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;. Luckily the traces of his bizarre songwriting and poetic lyrics can still be heard here. Overall though, the recording gives off the impression of a band not going in any definite direction, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but compared to the majority of Floyd's other albums, this doesn't really stand up.<br />Unlike albums such as &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;, and &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, &quot;Ummagumma&quot; doesn't follow a certain theme or concept. Rather, the songs take on a general feeling of strangeness, romanticism, experimentation, and oddity that can be interpreted and taken in a number of directions. The album still has a feel to it that brings it all together as a whole, but it does not follow a story or assured theme like most of Floyd's other albums.<br />The first of the two discs is composed completely of live recordings, and is the more impressive of the two discs included. These four tracks, although recorded in the late 60's, have a feel to them that the group would capture years down the road, and seems to foreshadow where the band is going. All the trippy, space-like guitar riffs are there, complete with the strange vocals, pounding percussion, and poetic vocals. All of the songs are equally impressive, most of them clocking into the time frame of between 7 and 15 minutes, showing that Pink Floyd doesn't make drab 3 minute long radio-friendly songs. As already said, &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; is the only song included that was written by Syd Barrett, but Roger Waters does a good job of taking his place lyrically on the haunting &quot;Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun&quot;. &quot;A Saucerful Of Secrets&quot; is the longest track, and one of the most experimental done by Floyd, but it doesn't quite stand up to the instrumental &quot;Careful With That Axe, Eugene&quot;.<br />The second half of the two disc set isn't nearly as impressive as the live section. &quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; by Roger Waters is the best track on the disc, seeing as the other song written by him, &quot;Several Species Of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together In A Cave And Grooving With A Pict&quot; is basically just a bunch of noise. The other three members each have a chance to contribute their own set of songs to the recording, Richard Wright's &quot;Sysyohus&quot; containing some beautiful piano playing, but unfortunately the 3 part song grows weak somewhere in the middle. Nick Mason's &quot;The Grand Vizier's Garden Party&quot; is the weakest effort on the recording, possibly ever by the band. The first and last section are short in length, and the second section, titled &quot;Entertainment&quot;, is mostly a jumble of percussive noise which can't find a rhythm or direction. David Gilmour's acoustic guitar driven &quot;The Narrow Way&quot; is by far the most impressive, showcasing his great guitar skills.<br />If you're a completist or a Pink Floyd devotee like I am, go ahead and buy this, it'll be worth your money. If you're just the average fan or looking for a good radio-friendly album, look elsewhere, as this recording takes time and patience. Otherwise, check out the bizarre poster included with the album and enjoy the oddities.
B00005B36H|5.0|First: as far as concept albums go, this one is tighter than anything from Rush or The Beatles.  The mood that Tool creates -dark paranoia- is held and developed throughout.  It's not for everyday listening, it isn't background music.  This album is a feature in and of itself.<BR>Second: these guys are so technically correct and intricate in their arrangements that even the snootiest poseur will have to admit that this album has admirable stature.  I am a musician and find myself challenged to even identify the structures used.<BR>Third: It's scary how circumstantially appropriate this album is; i.e. when listening to it, I have found the words to be eerily applicable to the situations/mind set that I am in too many times to call it coincidence.  Very powerful throughout.

B00004RYZT|5.0|Since Rammstein is my favourite band of all time, I cannot say anything bad about them because it's virtually impossible. However, I was dissapointed with the fact that buck dich was edited. It's not like we're targeting a certain audience here! Us Amerikans! Light! Trying to protect our children who see enough crap anyways, at the expense of the die hard fan who really wanted to see Flake and Till...The sound was very good, and I basically have Live aus Berlin on daily. I love the fact that I can watch Richard the whole time during Du Hast and Tier, but what's up with sticking footage from different songs in there????? Oh well. I was satisfied with having the interview; Richard is quite passionate and expressive and the interview as a whole really clears up any misconceptions people may have about the guys. You technically can't misunderstand them, really, if you listen and give the time of day....Buy if u are lazy and prefer being able to skip songs, or if u want the interview, buy the dvd. If you want better camera angles and the full footage, get the vhs.
B00004Z459|1.0|Linkin Park is pretty much pop music. Have a catchy riff, depressing lyrics that relate to troubled teens and add a bit of rap then you have yourself a hit. <br />I admit that the tunes are very catchy and have a nice beat. But that's about it. The mindless screaming and uninspired lyrics really leave something to be desired from this album.<br />I really wish people would come up with something new. Instead of constantly singing about how bad they have it. You think Linkin Park is having problems? Hell, they are rolling in dough because you bought their album! Listen to something with substance and character, instead of mindless ranting about how someones girlfriend broke up with them or how the establishment is bringing them down.<br />I'm not saying people should listen to obscure music or get into artistic rock. But there are plenty of heavy bands that have much more substance then this.<br />Daniel Shelor
B00005AAFS|5.0|I have been a huge Rammstein fan for some time now, and I must say that, upon my purchase of Mutter,I was far from dissapointed. Not only has their dialect changed slightly, but their over all sound has been enlarged. It's gone from sounding awsome to all round engulfing. Not only has the music sounded bigger, but Till's singing has become more melodious and emotional than ever before. I had the privilege to see them live in Columbus in July, and their live performance only hightened my opinion of Rammstein, my favourite band. Although most Americans do not appreciate this band and do not give them what they're worth because of language barriers and the infamous American ignorance, once one takes the time to translate, there is nothing left but to be amazed. I had the privilege of being singled out by Richard, Till( who winked at me) and Christoph (he threw a drumstick to me - yay!), they have such a magnificent crowd connection. Quite the Mephistos. Don't be intimidated by them - forget Backstreet and N'sync, for, as Richard said, they &quot;are the only true boy-group-band&quot;! This is how men are supposed to be...
B000009O8A|5.0|I plan on never watching this film again.  So why did I give it 5 stars?  Well, art can perform more than one function.  It can be used to entertain, but that isn't its only purpose. Art can also be used to get across a message or hold a mirror up to society.  Unfortunately, while serious books and art can treat horrible subjects with great frankness and without entertaining and still receive great praise, movies are stereotypically seen as more of an entertainment medium, so when a movie comes along that doesn't even try to be entertaining, people don't know how to react.  <br />This movie is not in the least bit entertaining.  In fact, watching it is a rather horrible experience, but it should be.  Any movie that pretends to treat the subject of rape seriously should be discomforting.  This movie has one of the most powerful depictions of rape I have ever seen.  Other major hollywood films that have tackled the subject of rape, like the one starring Jodie Foster (I forget its name), are lauded for their powerful depictions of rape, but when a more effective, low-budget depiction like this one comes along, one that gets across the horror of the act far more powerfully, it gets dismissed as exploitation.<br />Sure, the cover art is rather exploitative and seems to be geared towards attracting viewers looking for sexual thrills, and the same goes for the trailer, but the film itself is not one bit as exploitative as, say, the Deliverance.  It is an excellent depiction of the brutality of rape, the sexual immaturity of rapists, the cowardly nature of the act, and the fact that it is an act committed by those who usually feel powerless in everyday life.  The lead female, while staying at a remote cottage in order to write a novel, is gang raped and left for dead.  She starts trying to rebuild her life (her taping together of her torn up manuscript is an excellent symbolism for this), but is then discovered to still be alive by her rapists.  She then kills off the rapists one by one.  Perhaps not the most admirable of choices (although they did try to murder her), but the manner in which she kills each of them, playing off of their psychological weaknesses, brilliantly makes a point about the pathetic nature of rapists.<br />All praise aside, it IS a disturbing movie to watch and one I hope nobody will find entertaining, and as a result I don't plan on watching it again.  Once is enough.  But that makes this great art.
0060207051|5.0|I remember having this book read to me as a young child and now enjoy sharing those happy memories with my infant son.  It is still fun to look for the mouse in every picture and read the simple text of the book.  It is a timeless classic that is a comforting and wonderful way to end the day!  I definitely give it an enthusiastic thumbs up!!
B00003CX5P|2.0|The DVD is the first time I've seen this movie. Honestly, I fell asleep. This is not the sign of a good film. I keep hearing about how great the extras on the 2nd disk are but, who cares when the movie was this dull? Why would I want to see them? I think part of the problem was Lucas and team tried too hard to keep everyone happy and, in doing so, made no one happy. I would willingly pass on special effects and odd-looking aliens if I could get a bit of story.

B00003CX5P|1.0|I love the StarWars movies.  I can watch them again and again and never tire of them.  But Phantom Menance is a film I don't plan on watching any time soon.  The only parts of Phantom I liked were when Annakin Skywalker's mom reveals that Annakin had no father, and the last battle scene with Darth Maul--the rest of the movie left me bored and restless.  I wanted the movie to take me on an emotional journey where I cared about the characters I watched and felt their feelings as they displayed them, but watching Phantom Menance I felt nothing.  I felt like an outsider watching a film without meaning, watching battles that I didn't even care who wins.  I hope Lucas stops production on Star Wars II.  I have a feeling that it's going to be a bad film because he'll focus on visual effects rather than human emotions, and it will tell a story through artifical beings who lack substance rather than multi-layered characters (see Hans Solo) who create emotions at will.
B00000BKDX|5.0|Every devoted music fan remembers the day he or she got a new album that would eventually become a lifelong favourite, one that would stay close to their hearts forever. October 31, 1985 was such a day for myself. For this then-fifteen year-old metal fan, 1985 was a down year for heavy music, and Iron Maiden's epic live album was without a doubt the most anticipated release of that year. Who knew that little cassette I purchased would be played so much that it would be completely worn down after a few years?<br />Back then, you only had two options: buy the tape or buy the record. The record had an astounding gatefold sleeve with huge liner notes, but the darn things were so cumbersome, so the only choice was the cassette. The problem with the tape, though, was that its quality was so shoddy. The 100-odd minute cassette required thinner audiotape than usual, and the result was a fragile and flimsy little ribbon that would not survive multiple listens. The eventual cd release of the album was very disappointing, an abbreviated, 75-minute piece of junk with the entire `fourth side' omitted. Finally, in 1998, Live After Death was released in its entirety, and we were at last able to properly enjoy one of the best metal albums of all time.<br />During their mammoth 1984-85 World Slavery Tour, Maiden were at their peak, commercially and artistically. Their last three albums, The Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind, and Powerslave built up a massive following in North America to go along with their huge core audience in the UK and Europe, and as a result, Maiden were able to sell out five consecutive shows in Long Beach, California, creating an ideal situation to record a live album. Three shows were recorded on tape, while the other two were filmed, but instead of patching together a live album from the three different shows, the band and producer Martin Birch realised they were so on top of their game that they just mixed one performance in its entirety (with the exception of `Sanctuary', which still remains a mystery), with no studio enhancements or overdubs.<br />The result is an album of sheer power. Though the audience is still heard in the mix, the band's performance is right up front, leaving the listener to marvel at the musicianship of bassist Steve Harris, Adrian Smith, and Dave Murray, the thundering precision of drummer Nicko McBrain, and, best of all, the superhuman vocals of Bruce Dickinson. The twelve tracks of the Long Beach performance are now all staples in the Maiden catalogue, and all outshine their studio versions, especially the<BR>astounding `Revelations', whose tempo is sped up a slight bit, `Aces High' and `Powerslave', which practically burn with intensity, and `Flight Of Icarus', whose studio version Harris always thought was too slow. The best moment, though, is Maiden's live rendition of the thirteen-minute epic `Rime Of The Ancient Mariner', which proved that the band was more than capable of reproducing such an intense, intricate, grueling song in a live situation.<br />The second disc features both a cd-rom feature, as well as the lost `fourth side' from the original vinyl and cassette version. Recorded earlier in the tour at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, it consists of (at the time) older songs, and it serves as a kind of encore, a special treat for diehard fans. Early songs like `Wrathchild' and `Phantom of the Opera' are given the Dickinson treatment for the first time on record (he replaced Paul Di'Anno in 1982), while lesser-known classics like `Children of the Damned' and '22 Acacia Avenue' soar. The cd-rom contains excerpts from the exceptional film version of the show, including `Aces High', `2 Minutes To Midnight', and `Powerslave', all in their entirety, as well as a short clip of `Revelations'.<br />The only thing that seems missing from the album is Dickinson's between-song babbling, which fans know used to have a comically surreal feel all their own (the live film has an hilarious Dickinson tale of how Queen Victoria smoked hemp), but that would have slowed the album down, and is only a minor issue anyway. This album is simply perfect in every way, and while my musical tastes have broadened considerably since 1985, sixteen years after my first listen, Live After Death is a cd I still regularly take out and listen to in complete awe.

B00000ILE7|4.0|This film is much maligned, but presumably this is more because of people's expectations of sequels and trequels than any inherent weakness. To properly appreciate Alien3 you should not have seen the original. It would seem that anyone except me who sees Alien and Aliens before this film is destined to make unfavourable comparisons. Sadly, to properly appreciate Alien3 it is also necessary to have seen its predecessors! The paradox leaves us with the sad result that this film, which is pretty good if taken on its own terms is almost always written off as a faded photocopy of Alien. This is unfair. David Fincher, a first time director understands what makes the Alien frightening, and using dark lighting and occasional glimpses of the monster weaves a claustrophobic spell on his audience. The film also has the benefit of a great cast, featuring Paul McGann (Later an effective Doctor in Doctor Who), Tetley Tea man Brian Glover (who wins the award here for the most effective use of a four-letter word in cinema history), Charles Dance, and of course Sigourney Weaver. She has never looked better than with her shaven head, and puts in a performance at least as good as in the first two movies. The script and direction keep us on our toes, and the ending is very satisfying, bringing the trilogy to a worthy conclusion.
0792839234|5.0|Phantasm is a surreal little nightmare of a movie that works despite the usual low budget flaws.  When a friend of his older brother dies in a staged &quot;suicide&quot;, a young boy spies something strange at the funeral.  As he investigates the funeral home and cemetary he finds increasingly bizarre and horrible things, such as malevolent little trolls that begin popping up everywhere and a flying silver sphere that inflicts one hell of a head wound.  The mortician (known only as The Tall Man) also seems to be of supernatural origin, what he does with the bodies entrusted to his care being the stuff of nightmares.  Phantasm benefits from a wonderful score my Fred Myrow and Malcolm Seagrave as well as stylish and atmospheric direction by Don Coscarelli.  A cult movie that richly deserves it cult status.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This film is fortunate in that it is built round the very strong central performance of Russell Crowe. Otherwise its credibility would have been compromised by a series of blunders inexcusable is such a big budget undertaking from such an experienced director. To make a list seems churlish, so I will do so.<br />1. The sounds of the battle scenes are so obviously dubbed on afterwards. The battle scenes are very ambitious, full marks to Scott for 'having a go' at showing what it is really like in battle, but the dubbed soundtrack, invasive music and good grief, even dialogue out of synch just make this look silly.<br />2. The plot is predictable. it is obvious the son will kill Caesar, obvious that Gladiator will spurn the new Caesar, obvious he will escape execution, and obvious his family will be killed<br />3. The characters are ciphers, the same few people we have seen in every Roman Empire film from Ben Hur to the present day - you almost expect Lurcio to pop out and begin the prologue!<br />4. The scene where the boy is trampled by horses is predictable and it looks like they are using a dummy<br />5. The opening battle scenes somehow have the speed tampered with. they look a bit like a Ray Harryhausen battle scene only not as good. There's odd little bits of CGI used here for no apparent reason.<br />6. Richard Harries (presumably fatigued from holding down his weekend job as the Bishop of Oxford) gives a rather camp 'by numbers' performance of the exiting emperor. This is his last chance for him to give the world his King Lear and he's obviously determined to make sure we get it!<br />7. Joaquim Phoenix's diction is at times unintelligible.<br />8. The obvious CGI work on the flock of crows flying past the coliseum<br />9. The inclusion of Derek Jacobi. He's a fine actor, but his presence merely reminds us that the BBC has done Rome before, and better than this in I Claudius<br />But there are some merits to this film. Despite being long, its pace never flags. Crowe does some of his best acting when he is silent. As any actor will tell you, this is the most difficult type of acting, and it is unusual for the lead character in a film to have so much of it. But Scott shows great sensitivity in lingering on Crowe's expressions for just long enough to convey the emotions, and credit must go to the editor for this.<br />Oliver Reed is just superb. What a shame he was killed before the film was finished, because it could do with a bit more of him. I am certain Russell Crowe's Gladiator voice was modelled on Reeds. Compare them and I think you will agree.<br />The feeling of the bloodiness of battle and the empire is so well conveyed that you can almost smell the blood.<br />The staging of the battle scenes and the skill of the stunt men is unquestionable. But the camera is in close up for far too long and it's confusing. You only really know the outcome of a skirmish at its end. Some close-ups are needed in this type of film as it's tempting to let the big budget sets and crowd scenes leave you with only long shots and huge pans, but this isn't the right place for close-up work.<br />The scenes with the Gladiator riding cross country are good, reminiscent of the best scenes from Blackadder.

630245333X|4.0|The remake of The Blob is a high octane monster movie packed with attacks and effects, for the first forty-five minutes or so.  Then it slows down a little and settles into the typical monster on the loose with the teenagers saving the world plot that make those drive-in schlock fests of the fifties so much nostalgic fun.<br />Once again a meteorite slams into earth and from within it slithers a blob of protoplasm that absorbs any flesh it comes in contact with.  As the blob grows it becomes more and more aggressive in its attacks, each a show stopper, until it's oozing down main street USA, the populace running for their lives.  Can it be stopped?<br />Writer/director Chuck Russell (who co-wrote this with The Shawshank Redemption's Frank Darabont) is an obvious fan of fifties horror, this movie being one on 80s cinema steroids.  While he doesn't neglect the characters, developing most of them enough to care about whether or not they are engulfed or narrowly escape the horrible fate of being an evening snack for the overgrown amoeba, the individual attack scenes are the highlights.  Well worth the purchase price, or at least a rental.  Recommended.
B000002O1Q|5.0|I first heard &quot;Tonight is what it means to be young&quot; well after the movie came out.  I had to hear the rest of the sound track and bought the cassette.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus are a great band. This much has already been shown through their previous albums which have been building and redefing incubus' style. From the harder, more bizarre funk origins of 'fungus amongus' and their fantastic 'enjoy incubus' EP, the more catchy 'S.C.I.E.N.C.E' then appeared and really put incubus in the then unheard of nu-metal scene. <BR>'make yourself', their 1999 follow-up to 'science' was the bands first real departure from their harder edge. It still featured great songs with increasingly catchy choruses and showed them as being talented with a whole range of musical styles, many considered it rather too 'toned down' from 'science'. Never-the-less it showed a more mature band which 'Morning View' has confirmed. It starts as it means to go on. 'Nice to Know You' opens with a chunky riff, good to have it back, but also has very mellow segments and it sets the tone nicely for the rest of the album. A mix of harder songs, harder than anything found on 'Make Yourself' but it also combines with some of their most chilled out and relaxed music yet, finally ending in a 7 and a half minute track which is so calm and peaceful that it's hard to believe this band has ever been categorised as nu metal.<BR>Also, spend time listening to the lyrics, they show Brandon Boyd at his best and combined with the wonderful Einziger make for touching music. <BR>Incubus have come a long way, and considering their early work was already great, this is really saying something.
0140186409|4.0|The first 16 pages of this novel really knows how to put a person to sleep.  If you are in to analyzing characters in text to Biblical figures (aka Jesus Christ) then you'll like the preacher J. Casey.  From their journey until they arrive in California is fairly accurate in giving you a description of what the life was like for these displaced farmers.  You can see the developement of Ma Joad as she takes center stage in the family.  As for the ending, it was rather odd how Rose of Sharon gave of herself after showing such selfishness and wistful dreaming.  Overall, a very good piece of American Literature.
0140177396|1.0|I found several critical problems with this play, including narrative structure, plot thematics, metaphorical irony, and satirical narcissism.  Serious scholars need not apply.  The books are not for the people to do with Lenny and Carl.  Shooting the tragedy in the end is an unfortunate incident for the lives of everyone on the earthen structures.  If you're good looking for Steinbeck, I suggest the &quot;Rapes of Wrath.&quot;

0451526384|4.0|8 years has passed since the break up of Anne Elliot and Frederick Wentworth. Because of Frederick's lack of fortune and connections at the time, Anne was persuaded to reject his proposal. Now, he's back into town, with a fortune amassed at sea and still single. The feelings that were never quenched on Anne's side, are burning stronger than ever. And it has been turned upside down with (now) Captain Wentworth's renewed presence. Sure, she still wants him. But she's not sure if he does! Especially with the Musgrove sisters now in the picture. Not that she's lacking for suitors, but they just pale in comparison with Capt. W!<br />What a classic. Jane Austen, 200 years ago had the romance and chemistry right. Even for an ordinary girl like Anne who had let love pass by her once! Oh the suspense. You didn't know which Musgrove sisters Captain W was going to choose... let alone be sure if he even harbored any feelings for Anne! Or was Anne going to fall for the smooth and suave Mr. Elliot, her cousin? But all the waiting was worth it. Oh, the letter that he writes to Anne at the end is so worth it! I think the romance between Anne and Capt. Wentworth rivals any of the contemporary romance stories.
B000002UD0|5.0|I usually don't go near 'Beatle' revues ... it's dangerous; but this album always comes back to me of all Lennon's work. On the whole, I always thought it was his best effort, solo-wise; terrific collaboration with Elton (who promised him a hit with the opening track and came through) and John was on a downer ...This album had freshness to it, and Lennon actually spent time writing good material instead of wallowing in 'Love and Peace' (not that there's anything wrong with that!) and actually started moving back to the singer/songwriter in himself again. I guess hanging around Harry Nilsson out in L.A. did him some good. John, touched on this album with songs here and there...i.e. Mind Games, Out of the Blue, Imagine and the like, and certainly had many 'good songs' in his quiver, but this was his best album by far! A hidden treasure!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Three years ago, I saw Incubus live for the very first time.  A rugged looking group of individuals who brought the funk in while still maintaining a wierd amount of metal cred.  They had a dreadlock-encrusted singer who beat on a djembe and they basically put out a good vibe.  They didn't sound the same them, but there was no doubt in my mind this band was destined for greatness.  Fast forward to 2001 and listen to arguably the least string-attached album in quite a while.  Dive deep into these songs that pretty much force you to sing along, even if you sound like a vacuum cleaner.  Admittedly, there are a few tracks which have their low-points, especially on the clumsy opener &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;.  However they quickly redeem themselves with the thick groove on &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot;.  The standouts clearly are &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot;, which each seem to tread a different path.  Of course, noone will be able to resist the sing-along monster once &quot;Are You In&quot; pops in your head.  It just grabs you by the neck and tells you what to do.  Clearly, &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Aqeueos Transmissions&quot; are the mellow side of Incubus, which can be where they shine the most.  All in all, it's about time we hear a band with the mountains of talent emerge as stadouts so early in their career.  As with the Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers, sometimes when you throw too much in the bkender, it takes a few tries to taste right, but with this concoction, Incubus earns their place in the Best of 2001.

014028009X|3.0|This charming story of a talking rabbit and his adventures in the magic forest have rapidly become a modern classic. Kids everywhere will delight with the eccentric and colourful characters we meet along the way - especially Mr Frizzle the Walnut-Catcher! - although the plot is sometimes laboured, and the vocabulary a bit challenging for the 6-to-8-year-old reader. Nonetheless a bedtime treat. More please!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Three years ago, I saw Incubus live for the very first time.  A rugged looking group of individuals who brought the funk in while still maintaining a wierd amount of metal cred.  They had a dreadlock-encrusted singer who beat on a djembe and they basically put out a good vibe.  They didn't sound the same them, but there was no doubt in my mind this band was destined for greatness.  Fast forward to 2001 and listen to arguably the least string-attached album in quite a while.  Dive deep into these songs that pretty much force you to sing along, even if you sound like a vacuum cleaner.  Admittedly, there are a few tracks which have their low-points, especially on the clumsy opener &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;.  However they quickly redeem themselves with the thick groove on &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot;.  The standouts clearly are &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot;, which each seem to tread a different path.  Of course, noone will be able to resist the sing-along monster once &quot;Are You In&quot; pops in your head.  It just grabs you by the neck and tells you what to do.  Clearly, &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Aqeueos Transmissions&quot; are the mellow side of Incubus, which can be where they shine the most.  All in all, it's about time we hear a band with the mountains of talent emerge as stadouts so early in their career.  As with the Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers, sometimes when you throw too much in the bkender, it takes a few tries to taste right, but with this concoction, Incubus earns their place in the Best of 2001.
B00005AXEL|4.0|THIS IS TRULY STEVIE'S BEST WORK SINCE BELLA DONNA.  SHE HAS RETURNED TO THE PLACE WHERE BELLA DONNA AND THE WILD HEART WERE  BORN. THE SONG, SORCERER, IS A ROCKIN' THROWBACK FROM HER RHIANNON YEARS.  I FOUND,THE DUET WITH NATALIE, FROM THE DIXIE CHICKS TO RIVAL STEVIE'S JOINT EFFORTS WITH TOM PETTY. ALSO, SHERYL CROWS INFLUENCE ON THIS ALBUM IS A DEFINITE BONUS FOR ALL STEVIE FANS.  ALL IN ALL, STEVIE HAS PROVEN HERSELF YET AGAIN AND THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY STEVIE FAN!!!!
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you are not familiar with John Cleese and the series Fawlty Towers, then shame on you!  This series might be called the British contribution to comedy in the 20th century.  And it's a remarkable one at that.  <br />For those of you who remember watching this show years ago, the (quite affordable) DVD will bring back tears of laughter and the stich in your side that you remember in your previous viewing.  <br />This is a must-have for DVD collectors with a sense of humour.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have to say I absolutely love this album....it is well written and the beats are great...But it might not be for everyone...If you liked their last album then you will fall in love with this one when you first listen to it...
B00005QGAZ|3.0|You would think Epic would have learned something from all the spectacular reissues that Sony has remastered, but they have not.  There are only 4 extra tracks of music, one of which (the Billie Jean demo) is only an excerpt.  The rest of the CD is interviews, which could have easily been put in the liner notes, if there were any.  There isn't even a track listing of the extra material.  You have to go on to Amazon to find out where the songs are.  In addition, during the interviews, Quincy Jones mentions that there were several other songs recorded for the album which were not used. Only one of these (Carousel), actually show up on the CD.  What would have been nice would have been a peak into the recording process Quincy uses, showcasing earlier or in-process versions of some of the songs.  Sure, the actual album sounds great, but this package could have been so much better.
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you thought it couldn't get any better than Make Yourself, you're wrong.  Morning View is a masterpiece to say that least.  Worth listening all the way through...over....and over...and over...
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is a must have for Star Wars fans and just plain movie fans.  It can get you into the mind of George Lucas and the folks who did work on it.  Also the second disk is full of cool and funny stuff.
B000002JSJ|3.0|Jimmy Page is the most overrated guitarrist of all times. But the guy worked hard to achieve success and devised a winning formula for LEd Zeppelin to conquer the whole world: bluesy tunes, heavy tunes with an edge to it. IN other words: marvellous songs. You don't need to be a Yngwie Malmsteen to write great rock stuff (by the wat, Malmsteen has no soul - his playing is silly and boring, just scales and more scales and mores scales and hiring those &quot;gothic&quot; singers.. Blergh !!)<br />PRESENCE is not he best Led Zeppelin album, but Led Zeppelin in not top notch form is better than 98% of the garbage around nowadays... ACHILLES LAST STAND is the best.
6303430570|5.0|Kevin Smith is quick to be pigeonholed as a writer of vulgarity and immaturity.  Underneath the language, however, he has always shined with his insightful &quot;askewed views&quot; of life and reality. <br /> CLERKS, Smith's debut effort, was a realistic (sometimes not) look at what can happen in the daily routines of a convenience store employee.  Rather than rely on special effects or dramatic plots, CLERKS delivers pure meaning without all the fizz and sugary icing.  Unfortunately he spent too much money on MALLRATS, the next movie which didn't have nearly the charisma of this one.<br />Who can forget an anti-smoking advocate accusing a clerk of &quot;just following orders&quot;?  Would you ever imagine going into a movie store to request a film, only to have the names of pornos recited in your face?  Have you ever had the desire to play hockey (or any other field sport) on the roof of a building?  Are you the type that wishes you could attack your customers?  A &quot;yes&quot; answer to any of the above means you should see this movie.<br />It's profane and not for little kids, but for intellectual teenagers and liberal-minded adults, CLERKS is a gem you won't forget soon.  Kevin Smith is the Misfits of movies!!!
B000002MUQ|2.0|Compared with &quot;VAN HALEN III&quot;, of course BALANCE is a masterpiece !!! But the album shows clear signs of tiredness by the part of the band, with Anthony and Alex delivering the most predictable rhythm section as always, and Eddie annoying the listener with messy guitar solos, mixtured with uninspired guitar licks and riffs. Above all this, comes the limited and weary voice of SAmmy Hagar. Not the mention the usual silly lyrics.. All in all, a great waste of time, but VH fans will always swallow anything these heartless and commercial rockers ever put out.
B00003CXA4|5.0|&quot;Gandhi&quot; is perhaps the most emotionally moving of all epic films.  Gorgeous in every respect, the 3+ hours are well paced and it moves to an enthralling climax.  The entire cast is amazing--especially Ben Kingsley.<br />The DVD is very good.  The 20 minute interview with Kingsley flies by and the newsreel footage is fascinating.  The absence of Richard Attenborough anywhere on the disc is a real shame though.  It was his dream to bring &quot;Gandhi&quot; to the screen and his presence is sorely lacking.  Hopefully, Columbia will offer a new disc in the near future.
6301969294|4.0|Gary Cooper was well cast as the architect of ultimate principle and so noble a character might be hard to conceive, yet his portrayal of protagonist &quot;Howard Roark&quot; is sterling if not entirely moving. This is no fault of Mr. Cooper for he strives to portray a purity of motive that may be impossible. Worse is the premise of the film: that 'self-sacrifice' for public good is a craven defeat for the individualist who should have the integrity of his convictions, and that to himself alone.<br />The denouement showing the fate of the titular antagonist, &quot;Gail Wynand&quot;, as essayed by Raymond Massey, is somewhat stilted and not entirely believable, but the prose is certainly vivid if not hyperbolically purple in this overblown morality play with the modes of architecture used to show the conflicts in the modes and mores of man. Patricia Neal's spoiled rich girl character swings from neurotically icy to suddenly torrid with nary a bedroom scene in sight yet serves no clear motivation for the drama, merely a convenient (and salacious) nexus for the meeting of events.<br />Though architecture is used allegorically in the background, one learns little of it, but the story does bring to the fore a consideration of one's responsibility to posterity versus contemporary community. While we all can sympathize with the outrage of someone taking his labors of love and altering them without his consent, the point of the film (that ultimately one is only responsible to one's self) is lost to those who realize that human society could not long endure if each individual determined to stand apart regardless of the affect of his actions upon the whole, the body of man. When the architect takes matters into his own hands to the extent of breaking the law in a violent act that could endanger the public, the viewer's sympathy for him should vanish, for he demonstrates - and later proclaims in a monumental speech - that egoism is in his opinion, of greater importance than the public good. To be exculpated from such a demonstration vitiates what vaunted integrity the premise may have had and shows by the fate of newspaper publisher Wynand's recourse, the hollow hubris of self-made men.<br />As a pretty morality play the movie is interesting and well acted, and visually splendid if not somewhat wordy and stagy, but as a proclamation of righteous, God-given morals, if falls entirely short.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I listened Enigma ten years ago. He have never let me disappionted. The music is cold, emotional, and sexual. I can't imagine my life without Enigma.
B00005MAM2|5.0|Everything that should have been said about Akira is probabily said, so let's focus on a review of thje new master done for this DVD. While old (1988), this feature looks brand new on this master, thanks to the million dollar restoration proccess that Pioneer pursued to release this title. It made me wonder how was to be on a theather in Japan when it was released, watching a brand new print, probabily the best comparison to the experience of watching this DVD.<br />Both audio tracks sounds great, and considering that it was done in 1988, it's amazing to see how much the producers invested at that time on this feature, which features Dolby Surround Prologic sound on the japanese version (if you're to consider that most recent features are still using stereo sound).<br />The second disc, packed of extras is a must. If you liked Akira, you deserve a copy of the limited edition, which is the only way to get your hands on one of those shiny discs. Featuring a making of, interview with director Katsuhiro Otomo, musical clips and so many stuff it'd be hard to list, Pioneer hits big with this title.<br />Just as a side note, the special edition, on a special package, had 100,000 copies issued, which sold out TWO WHOLE MONTHS BEFORE the release date.
0802136834|4.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book.  I consider myself to be fairly knowledgeable of English history, and I was astonished at how much I do not know of this time period!  Ms. Weir has a quick moving style and does not allow herself to be bogged down in needless detail, yet still provides the reader with a great deal of essential and interesting facts.  She paints a very full picture of both Henry VIII and his many wives.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|This movie was good AND bad.  Alot of people feel that the love story in it should not have been put in.  This was used to show that in the Second World War, people and relationships were thrown into massive chaos.  This really did happen.  The story here in the movie may be based on reality, or not, but what happened in the movie with the characters and their relationships did really happen.  The only part of the love story that i thought could be taken out was the sex scene.  They could have left that to the viewer's imagination.<br />To move on the historical aspect of this movie was wonderful.
0385335482|3.0|If you are a fan of the Bridget Jones-esqe characters (single women in their 30s who are trying to figure life out), then this book is for you.  It is very cute and has a twist of an ending, and the book is a very quick read.  Great beach read.
B00005QG9J|4.0|OK, I have downloaded some of these songs off of the incubus web page.  Incubus has taken 2 big steps down from S.C.I.E.N.C.E, which had songs like A Certain Shade of Green, one of their best songs.  Anyway, this CD is not better than Make Yourself, some of Fungus Amongus, and SCIENCE, unless you truely enjoy the slower songs on the CDS.  I think that its almost completely changed.  Nice to Know You is a cool song, and so are Just a Phase and others, but theres more slow songs then I wish,
068484267X|5.0|I am particularly impressed by the innocence and true rendition of his memories as a child.  I recognize a great amount of similarities in details from my own childhood, which has been clouded and judged by the victimhood-labels I have acquired as an adult.  Frank McCourt has inspired me to reevaluate my memories and remember them as I experienced them at each stage of my childhood.  This book makes it easy for 'outsiders' to appreciate the 'less fortunate' (to say the least) histories of mankind, whithout being dragged into a searing, guilt-inflicting journey.  The humor, and the honest, endearing descriptions of his experiences at the different stages of his childhood, make this book a pearl.
078322740X|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out, and I LOVED IT!!! I had to go out and buy it, when it was released. I played it all the time, and even had it on while I was busy around the house because it was so funny and uplifting..I suggest you buy it, you'll absolutely LOVE IT!!!! They are both hystericle and it's sooo funny!
B00003CX5P|3.0|This DVD, packaged in one of those new (and terrible) hinged flip cases, is like the right dress on the wrong girl -- a satisfying collection of bonus goodies, but all packaged around a disappointing movie.  I still say the Terminator 2 and The Abyss packages are best.  Lucas was wise to load up this DVD with hours of extra stuff, because otherwise he would simply be cheating us again.  There is a large enough number of people who agree that this movie was a major disappointment on ALL levels.  All the fancy digital effects on earth cannot cover up for a bad script and stiff acting.  But at least by loading the DVD with lots of extras Lucas can, in effect, apologize for it by giving us more for our money than we got when we went to see this turkey in the theaters!
B00001OH7M|4.0|&quot;Space Oddity&quot;, like most of Bowie's work from 69-73, stands out on it's own as something very unique. The glam rock movement was just around the corner, and it does hint at that for sure. It also has a 60's folkie sensibility to it as well as some of the halucinatory rants that would follow on his next album.    <br />The title cut is a classic for sure, but it doesn't really set the tone for the rest of the album, which veers back and forth between long meandering pieces and short, sweet, folk-pop songs. &quot;Unwashed And Somewhat Slightly Dazed&quot; is one of my favorites here. It begins innocently enough as a sweet folkie tune, but goes off into a hard rocking and very Dylanesque sound at the same time. The lyrics work perfectly, begining as sweetly as the intro and then veering into something disturbingly funny. &quot;Cygnet Commitee&quot; also has echoes of Dylan with it's descriptive lyrics. Another tune here I'm especially fond of is &quot;God Knows I'm Good&quot;. It's a folk song about a lady getting caught stealing some steak from a grocery store. I had a freind whose mother was a kleptomaniac and food was her fort'e. We played it for her one time after she returned home with enough lobster and crab to give gout to an entire army. She was not amused and all we got that day were cold cuts! She has long since, changed her ways.<br />The production has a bit too much reverb in it, but in it's day was quite good. Bowie offered a very young Rick Wakeman a chance to shine. He joined the Strawbs shortly after and then Yes. He would turn up again on &quot;Hunky Dory&quot;<br />Though Bowie did some work prior to this, it's hardly worth a listen. I consider this album his real first effort.
B00003CXDV|4.0|This is one of those fun movies that will be popular enough to re-run on cable forever, like &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot;.  You don't have to be a &quot;Star Trek&quot; fan to catch the in-jokes.  Watch Sigourney Weaver's lips when she says &quot;Well SCREW THIS!&quot;  Don't know if that was intentional or not, but it is funny.<br />Plus, hats off the the DVD makers for including one of the most original bonus features ever!
B00005OMTT|5.0|I'm a huge Enigma fan. I find Enigma's music soothing and comforting to relax too. Although I own all four of their albums, I wanted to buy their greatest hits especially after hearing one of their new songs &quot;Turn Around&quot;. I believe that &quot;The Landing&quot; and &quot;Turn Around&quot; are the two new tracks on the cd, or never been released. I particularly dug &quot;Turn Around&quot;, such a breath-taking epic. &quot;The Landing&quot; made for a good opening track to lead the listener into this enchanting album. All the well-known tracks on this cd is found such as &quot;Sadeness&quot; and &quot;Return to Innocence&quot;. My personal favorite songs were included on this cd such as &quot;Gravity of Love&quot;, &quot;Mea Culpa&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Invisible&quot;, and &quot;Morphing Thru Time&quot;. Over 70 minutes long, I was not disappointed in this cd. This cd is great for casual listeners interested in hearing only Enigma's more familiar songs. Definitely one of the best greatest hits compilations ever to be released in my honest opinion.
B000002BBY|5.0|Truthfully, I couldn't care less wether this album is good or not because it's all worth it for one song- Wonderwall. I have to say that this is my all-time favorite song and i don't think Oasis could have made it any better. There are some other good songs on here as well, like Champagne Supernova, but I would highly reccomend buying this album just for Wonderwall; Oasis hasn't and I don't think ever will surpass it.
0312954468|5.0|It's not often I read a book where I get emotionally attached to the characters, but such is the case with River God. I've always had a love of all things Egyptian, so this book was a natural choice for me. But after the first reading, it instantly became a favorite. Smith gives you the feeling these are real people and you can't help but cheer for their victories and grieve for their sorrows.<br />I could go on about how great the characters are, but others have done so before me. So I leave it to you to get this book and see if it doesn't become one of your favorites.
0140288503|5.0|Excellent factual story on the action in Somalia.  This is the type of tragedy that could easily be repeted in Afganistan.  Very current and heroic. This story is even more interesting when read thru the filter of the Sept 11 disaster.  It is widely believed that bin Laden had trained some of these players and armed them as well.  The most revealing thing is to look at the map of Somilia and see the grand plan which becomes obvious when you consider the location of these countries and their proximity to each other.
B000003S5H|5.0|This album is far better than 10,000 Hz Legend, and one of the best I've heard in a while. Perfect for relaxing to, Moon Safari is just that. Every listen makes me feel like I'm lying on my back in a warm sleeping bag staring at the sparkle of the stars. I could see jazz lovers, electronic lovers, and indie lovers getting into Air.<br />My indie friends were hopping head over heels for them, only saying how great they were, so I gave them a download. From individual songs, this album is good, not spectacular. Its the whole that gets you. A song you have mixed feelings about you will like when listening to the album as a whole, a good song turns great, and a great song turns into the song that makes your day. I would suggest this album for just about anyone who likes both guitars and synths. <br />I give it a five for very obvious reasons. Get it, you'll understand.
0394810112|5.0|The reason that I liked Roald Dahl so much is because he refuses to patronize its readers, children included. As a kid, I couldn't stand the fluffy tripe that passed as children's fare (I remember Snoopy was de rigeur at the time).<br />&quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; is different...Indeed, what 10-year-old wouldn't want to read about gruesome, creative ends for bad children? A TV fiend shrunk and then pulled into a thin string?  A snotty spoiled brat dragged off by squirrels and covered in garbage?  Nice.  The alternative is &quot;Carebears&quot; and &quot;Hello Kitty&quot;....give me a chocolate glutton squeezed through a pipe anytime.
B00003CX5P|5.0|First of all, with 2 documentaries, several deleted scenes, a music video, poster art, exclusive photos, animatics examples, StarWars.com video vignettes, TV commercials, movie theater trailers, and other goodies, only a FOOL would pass on this DVD of &quot;Star Wars: Episode One: The Phantom Menace.&quot;<br />My advice to you is to ignore the Jar Jar Binks haters. What they don't realize is that Jar Jar is a technological marvel, worthy of his own documentary, and he is one of the most complex effects elements of the entire film. Jar Jar is motion-captured brilliantly with a performance by Ahmed Best, and George Lucas tells us in the audio commentary that the inspiration for Jar Jar was Buster Keaton, particularly in the Gungan battle against the battle droids. So, there is much more to Jar Jar's character than these haters would have us believe.<br />I was a bit thrown by the fact that Lucas added some of the deleted scenes to the actual film instead of keeping them separate. Otherwise, why not call this a &quot;Special Edition?&quot;<br />All in all, it is a dazzling use of DVD technology, with TONS of extras that will keep the most die-hard Star Wars fan busy for hours and hours. I know I'm still not done with the extras, and it's been a week since I've bought the DVD.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I never knew how good my home theater sound system was until I tried TPM DVD. If you have a Dolby Digital theater sound system, you need this DVD. My favorite features are the &quot;beginning&quot; documentary and the bloopers which are hidden as an easter egg.
B00005LB9O|5.0|Heard these guys playing in a hat shop in Seaport Village in San Diego - very much reminded me of Radiohead and the much-missed Toad the Wet Sprocket...needless to say, I ran out the next day and bought the disc and have enjoyed it every second since.  It is full of light and moving tracks - well worth the few bucks.
6300215717|5.0|One night on a whim, I checked out 3 films: L.A. Confidential, Roman Holiday &amp; Pulp fiction.  The strangest surprise I got when I watched LA Confidential, was seeing a clip of Roman Holiday playing in a movie theater, and in awe by the coincidental checkout I had made.  This film stands as a one of the better film romances I have seen in a long time.  Much better than most films released today.<br />  At the onset of our story, we find Princess Ann(Audrey Hepburn) fed up with her non-stop tour of Europe, doing nothing more than meeting with other dignitaries,  sticking to an all-work schedule, and almost no time to herself.  One evening, fed up with her tiresome regiment, she escapes from her country's Roman Embassy, and sets out into the city.  Soon after, she is discovered sleeping on a bench by Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck), a member of the US News Service.  Because she's too tired to tell him where she lives, Joe takes her home, and the next day realizes that she is Princess Ann.  however, Ann is reluctant to reveal this, and Joe plays along with her game, hoping to get a story out of it.  He is soon accompanied by his friend  Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert), who is there to help bring photographs to the story (but without Ann knowing).  Their escapades take them from the busy streets, to scenic Roman tourist sites, and onto a barge for a nightly dance.     But as the day wears on, the Princess and Joe soon find that secretly they have been falling in love.<br />  This story's romance plotline works so well, because it's not something as predictable as say, &quot;You've Got Mail.&quot;  There are no real romantic longings between these characters, just several instances of a mutual friendship, which of course is the basis for romance in my book.<br />  The film was shot entirely on locations in Rome, with the exception of several indoor set pieces.  What's amazing is the amount of time and patience it took to make this movie, but it's small pennies considering aproject director William Wyler would tackle in later years: directing the epic Ben-Hur.  <br />  As for casting, almost everyone has said it best: Audrey Hepburn was the best candidate for  Princess Ann.  Her portrayal of Ann as a young woman who is torn by her duties and yet yearns to do normal things (go to sidewalk cafes, wear pajamas, and so on), is so succinct that we believe her.  Gregory Peck was not the first choice, but after watching him in this film, I can't picture anyone else doing a better Joe Bradley for the film.  He has that seriousness yet sympathetic nature that reminds me in some ways of Harrison Ford.  Eddie Albert as Irving the photographer has some of the most incredibly funny moments in the film.  I won't give any away, because you have to see them for yourself.<br />  As a film student, there are several technical problems, such as sound fazing, quick cuts that seem to puzzle the eye and so forth, but the story makes up for this.<br />  This film was nominated for 10 Oscars in it's day, winning 3: Best Actress (Hepburn), Best Costume, and Best Motion Picture Story.<br />  The one thing I am most displeased with about this film, has to do with Paramount Pictures.  Out of numerous films they've released featuring Audrey Hepburn, Roman Holiday has yet to see an imprint on a DVD disc.  This seems hard to believe, considering this was Hepburn's major debut, her first Oscar win, and yete a romance story that should be seen and heard in this age we live in today.  I can't stress this enough, but if you want to watch a relaxing film, Roman Holiday is just right.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This movie was great! It did lack some story line at places. But it had tons of action to keep it through. No special effects, just old skool fun!
B00003CXS4|4.0|When Guy Ritchie (more famous for being married to Madonna than a filmaker)made Lock, Stock in 1998 he left us wanting more of Guy's unique story-telling and original talent.&quot;Snatch&quot; is more of the same and not much more.With lines like, &quot;I thought you said he was a getaway driver.What the fu** can he get away from?&quot; And &quot;You know, London...fish and chips, cup o' tea, bad food, worse weather, Mary fu**in' Poppins...London,&quot; make it an absolute CLASSIC of a film.Not to mention a great cast including Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro, Vinnie Jones, Mike Reid, Dennis Farina &amp; Jason Statham.A great story, comedy and brutal violence.<br />The story follows &quot;Franky Four Fingers&quot; (Benicio Del Toro) who steals a diamond with 3 other goons in Antwerp.Franky visits dodgy ex-KGB Russian, &quot;Boris The Blade&quot; (Rade Sherbedgia)to buy a guy.Franky buys one, but in return Boris asks for him to place a bet at a bookies instead of cash.So he does.<BR> Boris then pays a visit to 2 small-time pawnbrokers , &quot;Sol&quot; &amp; &quot;Vinny&quot; to hold-up the bookies and rob Franky's diamond for 50 grand's work.Sol &amp; Vinny get &quot;Tyrone&quot; their getaway driver involved.<BR> Sol &amp; gang rob the bookies and get away with Frank and his diamond (the diamond's in a case attached to Franky's arm).<BR> &quot;Tommy&quot; (Stephen Graham) &amp; &quot;Turkish&quot; (Jason Statham) are partners in the world in boxing promoters.Tommy &amp; Gorgeous George(friend and tough guy) visit some &quot;Pikeys&quot; (Irish gypsies) to buy a caravan for an office.The Pikeys are lead by &quot;One Punch Mikey&quot; (Brad Pitt).The caravan's wheels fall off, the Pikeys refuse to give them their money back, but instead Mickey challenges George for a fight to decide who gets the caravan.Mickey surprisingly beats George with one punch and puts him in a critical state.It turns out Mickey is a bare-knuckle boxing champion.This leaves Tommy &amp; Turkish with no fighter, they decide to use Mickey, but will &quot;Brick Top&quot;, their boss mind?<BR> Brick Top runs an illegal bookies (yes, the one that Sol &amp; gang robbed).Brick Top uses Mickey but states clearly that he has to get knocked out in the 4th round.Bric Top sets out to find out who robbed his bookies.<BR> Everything gets complicated after this, &quot;Avi&quot; &amp; &quot;Doug The Head&quot; who are cousins, and friends of Franky set out to look for him after he doesn't show up for a meeting.They get they help of &quot;Bullet Tooth Tony&quot; (Vinnie Jones) to help.<BR> This film is truely entertaing.Not as original as Lock, Stock but still a winner.I think film critics didn't give this good reviews because it doesn't live up to the expectations of Lock, Stock.However, get your hands on this film and I guarantee you will enjoy it!
B00005QIPH|2.0|I heard the strokes before their sudden popularity explosion and I was just as impressed then as I am now. that is to say, very little. it's a fairly bland album, and it's pretty clear not a whole lot of thought went into it. although admittedly it's still better than anything on pop radio today (save maybe coldplay and the new elton john). how much longer until the Gap ad?
6304712936|2.0|You can omit the trailers, the commentary and all the extras. Just don't make me flip the DVD to watch the whole movie.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|All of my friends who have this cd say they hate it, which I thought was odd because we are all completely obsessed with Bjork's music. So I never even thought to buy it. But after seeing the movie I ran to get this CD. I thought it would be filled with musical scores, similar to &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot;, but they are not like that at all (even though I love that song, I couldn't take a whole CD of that). These songs sound as though they could have been on Post. They are fun, have good beats, beautiful vocals, and are interesting. She uses ordinary sounds as instruments, like sneakers squeaking and writing on a chalkboard. Number 6 (sorry, don't know the titles!) is the weakest song, and number 1 is just an instrumental version of the last song, which is one of the best songs on the album, after number 5. I wish it could have been longer, but then again with only 7 songs it doesn't have the time to drag on (cough cough, Vespertine). Only other complaint: Could Thom York (of Radiohead) sound any more bored than he does on track 3?
B000000W4M|5.0|A year after the grunge scene exploded in Seattle with Nirvana and Pearl Jam (whose music I enjoy also), this band released its breakthrough like many other bands. This breakthrough just happened to be the best album in history, surpassing The Beatles, Elvis, and Bach's work. This CD can attract fans of any genre (except mindless rappers). Those who like hard rock will love the pounding guitars and heavy drumming. For classical and soft rock fans, the emotion and melodies on this CD are way beyond anything else in alt-rock. I'll go through each of the disk's tracks now...<br />1. Cherub Rock -- 8/10 -- Great hard rocking song. It's not my favorite, but it's VERY good.<br />2. Quiet -- 9/10 -- I didn't like it at first, but after a few listens, it's one of those songs that should have made it onto radio and didn't. It's even harder than &quot;Bullet w/ Butterfly Wings&quot; and &quot;Cherub Rock.&quot;<br />3. Today -- 10/10 -- you've obviously heard this song before. It deserved all the radio play it's gotten over the years. It is in the top three songs of this album.<br />4. Hummer -- 9/10 -- this is a great moderately-heavy song. The whole song is great, but there is this one quiet portion about 4 and 1/2 minutes into the song that is haunting and beautiful at the same times as Billy whispers &quot;Ask youself a question...&quot; -- just listen to it.<br />5. Rocket -- 7/10 -- I don't know why so many people love this song! It's good alt-rock like all the songs on the album, but it is melodically bland and not very catchy. Good but not great.<br />6. Disarm -- 7/10 -- This isn't alt-rock! It's a nice song, but I don't enjoy songs like this very much. It's good as a break in the middle of the album, though.<br />7. Soma -- 7/10 -- definitely would have been better at about half its length. This really quiet music with an inaudible whisper goes on for about three minutes before the rocking part, and then at the end. Hard to listen to without skipping after about a minute, but if you do it's okay.<br />8. Geek USA -- 8/10 -- good fast-tempo hard rock song. It's almost too fast, though. It's not a standout, unlike the next track...<br />9. Mayonnaise -- infinite rating/10 -- This is the reason I made the statement about this being the best album of all time: this song. This is the best song of all time, counting all genres over all centuries. There is nothing more gripping an honest than this song. It may be hard rock, but even a classical fan would have to enjoy this song. But for us hard rock fans, this is the standout of the decade, and quite frankly the best rock song ever, including The Beatles. You can't argue against this song. BEST WORK EVER BY ANY ROCK BAND. You should buy this CD, but if you don't, download this MP3.<br />10. Spaceboy -- 8/10 -- a quiet acoustic song that is very catchy. Of the quiet songs on the album, this song is more enjoyable to me than Disarm.<br />11. Silverf*** -- 7/10 -- another fast rocker like Geek USA. I didn't particularly enjoy this song as a standout.<br />12. Sweet, Sweet -- 7/10 -- extremely out of place and strange, yet good. Catchy. It almost sounds like classic rock and pop combined or something.<br />13. Luna -- 8/10 -- a good soft song. A little too mushy for me, but it has a nice melody. Decent conclusion.<br />In conclusion, many rock fans will agree this album surpasses Ten and Nevermind, popular as they may be, as the top album of the 90s. In my own more agressive opinion, this is the best collection of music ever released. These brilliant artists had one album where they produced hard rock that was actually extremely melodic. And then... they sold out like all rock bands do. They &quot;Became more mature&quot; and started whining softly and released a 28-song collection with about 5 songs that were of this quality. Too bad, huh?
B00003CXAA|2.0|Talk about the DVD DISAPPOINTMENT OF THE YEAR!  Like many, I've been waiting for this release but I couldn't believe the shabby quality associated with it.  Paramount blew it!<BR>Many would like to have seen the release of the Godfather Saga/Epic, but that didn't happen so this 5 disk set had to do.<BR>And it was horrible.<BR>Godfather 1 and 2 are excellent movies.  Godfather 3 was a huge disappointment.<BR>Having said that, I still purchased this 5 disk set, hoping to view them in all the technical splendor Paramount had to offer.<BR>Apparently, they had none and released this poor quality offering for the money only, not for any artistic reasons.<BR>The video transfer is horrible but the audio was very good.  But, I want to watch AND hear a good movie.<BR>I returned this 5 disk set today and will not buy any subsequent release until I've read as many reviews as possible.<BR>Francis made Godfather 3 for the money and it appears Paramount released this disappointment for the same reason.
B00005ATQH|4.0|Very risque movie for the times, but a must see.James Mason gives a wonderful performance. Good casting all the way/ Great acting /Probably best performance of Sue Lyons career.Also would recommend remake starring Jeremy Irons . Not as good as the original but not bad.Both movies are worth a watch. Enjoy Lisa C.
B00003CX9E|5.0|Is this really pan and scan? After watching it, I can't detect it.
1586212222|1.0|Humor are far in between the dark and depressing view.  Whenever those precious humorous gems come along I was already too depressed to be amused.  Can't finsih listening to the first side of the first tape.
B00005R87Q|5.0|I Can't Wait for this DVD...This movie is probably the best, most adrenalin pumpin', Street racing, Car movie I've even seen.<br />This movie iz awsome...If I hadn't pre-ordered it, and I saw it in the stores, It'ld be gone in less than 60 seconds.<br />5 stars definately.
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I have played this CD for many doubters - even people who were fiercely determined not to fall for Rufus, after hearing so much praise of his first album.  Every last one has become a serious fan.  The extremely odd and surprisingly addictive mix of misical styles reminds me - in philosophy though not in sound - of Ben Folds 5.  And in the same way as BF5, the sound reaches accross simple 'genre' boundaries... Folk, punk, opera, pop, 'alternative', country, it's all unobtrusively in there, and interwoven beautifilly.  Both Rufus Wainwright albums are staples.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Not usual Sissy Spacek fair, but a very good horror movie. Great cast/ Piper Laurie/Amy Irving etc.Would recommend it .Some good special effects. Not to many horror movies have you feeling sorry for the person causing all the mayhem . This one will. Enjoy Lisa C.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|Because Jennifer Lopez is such a media personality, I think it's difficult to put aside the tabloid headlines and simply evaluate her musical output. But you know what? &quot;On the 6&quot; is a pretty good CD. On this disc, Lopez blends Latin, disco, pop, and other elements for a largely satisfying whole.<br />The CD offers a nice mix of mellow and high energy numbers. &quot;Should've Never&quot; is enhanced by both a sensuous spoken-word bit as well as some erotic moaning. &quot;Waiting for Tonight&quot; is a good disco number that appears in two versions: English and Spanish (the latter titled &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot;). Another song that appears in two versions is &quot;No me Ames,&quot; an excellent duet with Marc Anthony. With this song, both versions are in Spanish; the difference is that the first song has a salsa flavor (heavy on horns and percussion), while the second is a more laid-back ballad version. Also enjoyable is the mellow, romantic &quot;Talk about Us.&quot;<br />Lopez proves herself an effective vocalist on the CD, and holds her own in her duet with the amazing Anthony. Yes, as a whole &quot;On the 6&quot; may just sound a bit too &quot;slick&quot; and commercial, but if you suspend whatever prejudices you might have, you just might enjoy it. I did.
0060254920|5.0|I liked this book ever since I first read I just loved how the main character uses his imagination its really weird because when I was little I thought that actually happened in his room but now that I'm older I can see how funny and cool the book is!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0380789019|5.0|Neil Gaimans &quot;neverwhere&quot; is the best book ive ever read and believe me, ive read ALOT of books. Its got you in its claw from the first word til the last and it doesnt give you comercial breaks. You cant put it down and you just keep reading and reading and reading and time flies by and you dont even notice it. the world changes and its not like your reading about characters. Door, Hunter, Anesthesia and Richard and the others you after a while through the book are parts of everyone that they dont always see and their certainly parts that you never thought you needed.  Read this book and enjoy it. but i warn you, youll never look at anything the same way again, not even a empty alley...
0553274503|5.0|This work is only superficially science fiction. It is actually a human story of great power that uses science merely as a means to explore themes like pain and loss, alienation, society's prejudice for intelligence, and our innate fear of mental deterioration.<br />Throughout this work, the author must improvise. Consider what he has to overcome. Keyes is telling, in the first person, the story of a mentally retarded man, and he must convey his character's universe to readers who, by virtue of being readers, are far from retarded. The author also has to bring his character through an immense intellectual range, from a barely functional literacy to a genius level mind, and he has to do so not only incrementally, but honestly and believably. There are many other nuances that Keyes handles deftly, but the two already mentioned would sink the average author as he leaves dry dock.<br />We all remember the bell shaped grade school plot diagram - the one wherein Mrs. Frump shows us the story starting at the bottom, rising to its climax, then down again to some strange French province called the &quot;dénouement&quot;. Almost every story we have since read has conformed to this plot design. But how many stories apply this curve not to the plot, but to its central character?<br />This is the secret to Keyes's achievement. We are invited into Charlie Gordon's mind and our sense of his world expands as his mind expands, until we can't tell if the quickening pace of the thoughts are Charlie's or our own. What a wonderful device. It seems unfair to even call it a &quot;device&quot; - as if it were something the author uses to con us. Add to this Charlie's emotional journey, and the story grips with rare poignancy.<br />There is one stipulation. To live and breathe as Charlie, one must be willing to accept the book's device, immerse oneself in its first person perspective, and go along for the ride. Readers who approach their reading with a reserved detachment will find this book manipulative. It IS manipulative, but in the way that all good fiction is: the author is guiding us to undiscovered country.<br />The author never pummels his message nor engages in easy sentimentality. If you are the sort of reader who can chip off your encrusted cynicism for an afternoon and let Charlie Gordon in under your skin, you will appreciate this story as one of still reflection and quiet pity. It will give you a fuller appreciation for your own life.<br />As a postscript, a film titled &quot;Charly&quot; was made based on this novel starring Cliff Robertson in the named role. Robertson won an Oscar for his portrayal of the central character. In its abridged way, this film is almost as good as the book, and gives a different slant to Charlie's life.
B00004U8PA|4.0|Still a hoot after 25 years. Enjoy it every time I watch it. I don't think they could make a movie quite as funny/risque today.Worth a watch if you have never seen it. Enjoy Lisa C
B00000DGUY|5.0|When I first heard Mark Knofler sing I thought he was just a Geordie Bob Dylan but his voice grew on me. His guitar work is exemplary. The songs on this CD show the imaginative lyrics of this band - from the generation gap in &quot;Sultans of swing&quot; to the macho &quot;Heavy fuel&quot; to the satiric &quot;Money for nothing&quot;.<br />One of the best exponents of classic rock in the 1980s - varied and exciting as well as cool. Enjoy!
B00003CX5P|4.0|Deffinitelly worth a buy, due to the content.  <br />Pros:<BR>* Deleted scenes documentary, which also tells you why scenes get deleted, and how they are chosen.<BR>* &quot;The making of...&quot; documentary offers rare insights into the financing of the movie.<BR>* Two scenes added into the movie.<br />Cons:<BR>* It forces you to install a terrible DVD player, which tends to crash, does not install properly and drastically decreases the movie quality on under-1GHz computers.
B000021YQV|1.0|Heavy metal has assumed many diverse forms over the past twenty years.  From the big hair bands of the 80s, to the rock/rap hybrid bands of today, one thing has remained the same...hard rock has always been controversial, fueled by adrenaline, and powerful.  For every success story in the music industry, there are a hundred clone bands trying to mirror a formula rather then bring something new to the scene.  System of a Down is unfortunately one of the many clone bands trying to cash in on metal's latest face.<br />I do not like Limp Bizkit, Korn, Marilyn Manson, or many of the metal bands of today.  These bands seem to be all about noise and shock value, but lack the substance and diverse influences of their predecessors.  I am more into bands like Tool, Type O Negative, Faith No More, and Dream Theater...metal bands that do not get constant airplay on Mtv, but have nevertheless taken hard rock and metal in interesting and exciting directions.<br />When I first heard Chop Suey on the radio, I thought System of the Down had the potential to be a rock pioneer for the new breed of metal...although Chop Suey falls victim to the power chord structure song style that gives away the fact that this band will never have the virtuoso talents of an Eddie Van Halen or Steve Vai, it is a powerful song.  The lead singer of System has a dynamic voice, and although the band lacks a unique sound, overall Chop Suey grabbed my attention enough for me to purchase their album.<br />BIG MISTAKE<br />The album is 14 tracks of noise, fillers, and garbage.  Somewhere in the lyrics are political statements about prisons, drug use, and the likes, but the message is lost behind a wall of three chord riffs and disjointed, almost annoying drum playing.  Worst yet, each song sounds like the last, and although the lead singer and guitarist harmonize well on Chop Suey, they resort to screaming on most of the other tracks.  The only song that really stood out was Chop Suey, almost as if this song was written by a completely different band then is featured on the rest of the album.<br />Chop Suey does get a lot of play time on my CD player because it is a great tune, but do yourself a favor and get the single CD rather then shell out ... for the full CD...the rest of it is obnoxious noise and is lost in the landscape of \\"angry\\" bands already flooding the airways.<br />On a side note, I just saw the video for Chop Suey.  The band certainly has personality, although the guitarist suffers from the \\"abnormal, disturbing faces with eye liner\\" syndrome that most of the bands of today suffer from...there was a time when the guitar players of great rock bands didnt dress in Halloween costumes to draw attention to themselves...their talents as  guitar players gave them a signature style and personality that listeners can easily identify with...you can identify Eddie Van Halen, Steve Vai, Peter Townsend, Slash, Ace Freely, or any of the great guitarists of yesteryear by their playing style...since the latest breed of guitar players only seem to know how to play the same five power chords, it is no wonder that they have to dress like freaks to stand out in the crowd.
B0000035E7|3.0|This is not a great album.  It's got lotsa great songs, but the album is seriously flawed.  First of all, the suits at SubPop were way to stifling - Nirvana had many good songs in this era that were left off because they didn't fit the 70's c--k rock model they were after.  They were lucky to get &quot;About a Girl&quot; and &quot;Love Buzz&quot; on there. Indeed, Bleach sounds like a punky garage band doing there best impression of your average mid-70s garage band.  The production is horrible.  Not just raw - raw can be very good.  It's just bad, not projecting any of the instruments like they need to be.  Worse, they had a crappy drummer (Dave Grohl didn't join until 'Nevermind'), and hard-hitting percussion is vital to the kind of sound they are going for here.  Now as I said, the songs are good.  Not great though.  Too much reliance on sludgy metal riffs rather than the bands natural knack for pop melodies and perky punk numbers.  Kurt's songwriting was still in development, and 'Sub Pop' image wasn't helping it much.  But he gets some good jabs at the label's execs and atmosphere on the songs &quot;School&quot; and &quot;Big Cheese&quot;.  Anyway, &quot;Blew&quot;, &quot;About A Girl&quot;, &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, &quot;Swap Meet&quot; and &quot;Downer&quot; are my favorites here, although &quot;School&quot; and &quot;Negative Creep&quot; probably deserve a nod.  But none sound as good as they could have, and it's unfortunate that some of the band's better songs from this era, such as &quot;In Bloom&quot;, &quot;Blandest&quot;, &quot;Even In His Youth&quot;, &quot;Aero Zeppelin&quot; didn't make it, but most did pop up on later albums.  If your a Nirvana fan, you must get it eventually, but Incesticide is a more textured and full representation of their pre-fame years.
0800177177|4.0|As an ardent collector of horror movies/ my collection would not have been complete without this movie.Gary Oldman really goes out there for his role as Dracula.It has a very good plot and acting . Sometimes not to believable from Keanu Reeves . But still anyone who enjoyes a good vampire movie will like this one.Some of the costumes for this movie were great.Especially Oldmans sunglasses for his arrival to London. most will enjoy the scenic and castle shots as well as the special effects.Worth a watch. Enjoy Lisa C..
B00005N9CV|1.0|Yep, the booklet is sooooo sexxxxxxxy.<br />Well, so ? Musically, one of the worst jazz(y) CD of the year. Apart Lisa EKDAHL, hard to find a less swinging singer (?).<br />Hard to decide who is the worst : Mrs KRALL or the sound engineer ? Take &quot;The Look Of Love&quot; track. Can anyone tell me if Mrs KRALL is playing acoustic or electric piano or ... accordion ? Can anyone explain me why this instrument crosses my room from the left to the right speaker ? Can anyone explain me how not to be distubered by the edit and drop out ?<br />A pity Amazon don't allow people to rate a CD 0 star.<br />Better keep away from this total failure.
B00003CXXI|5.0|When I first saw the preview, this looked kind of stupid but then I went and saw Shrek with my boyfriend and neither of us stoped laughing through the whole thing (exept the end which is really sweet). teenagers will love this (I do) my little sister loves it and so do my parents. This is a great movie for all ages. BUY SHREK TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000003TAB|5.0|Surprised to see the mediocre reviews, I consider this one of the best representations of Nirvana's sound.  It begins with about ten short, fast punk tunes, all repetitive but very dancable - then you get some of their more complex, deeper tunes with lots of twists, turns and vocal surprises.  Much better representation of their early years than BLEACH, and a great example of what they are capable of.
0783235607|5.0|This movie is celluloid proof that older is much better. The remake is no where near the film this is.Great cast/ great plot/great performances. A must see-add to movie collection for Anthony Perkins fans and suspense movie fans. Enjoy Lisa C.
B00005NWM3|5.0|I never bought the first CD from Nickelback, but loved both &quot;Breath&quot; and &quot;Leader of Men&quot; enough to buy &quot;Silver Side Up&quot;. This album rocks from beginning to end. All of the songs are strong and powerful.<BR>A few of the songs are around the idea of 'spousal abuse' and love gone bad. This doesn't deter, and only makes the message stronger. Its also produced top notch: crisp, clean, very tight.<BR>I enjoy it alot. Im 32 and still rockin - highly recommended.
B000002P6R|5.0|Regardless of what some of the reviews below say, &quot;Face Dances&quot; is a great album. If the material on it dosen't appeal to some &quot;die hard&quot; fans, that's fine, it's just a matter of taste. What can't be seriously disputed is the quality of the songs and the musicianship. To say these songs are &quot;garbage&quot; is wrong, because they are not. &quot;Face Dances&quot; is a solid work that really dosen't have any weak material. &quot;You Better You Bet,&quot; &quot;Don't Let Go the Coat,&quot; and &quot;Another Tricky Day&quot; are as melodic and well constructed as as anything Pete Townshend has written and the rest of his songs here are definitely strong as well. &quot;The Quiet One&quot; and &quot;You&quot; are two of the best Entwistle songs the Who ever recorded. In regards to the musicianship on this release, it's as engaging and energetic as you would expect from the Who. On a few tracks, the guitars could be more up front, but that's a small complaint that's balanced out the &quot;The Quiet One&quot; and &quot;You,&quot; which are two of the most raw and aggressive studio tracks the band ever recorded. The entire band sounds great throughout &quot;Face Dances,&quot; including Kenny Jones, wose playing may be alittle more retrained than Keith Moon's brilliant almost out of control style, but the way he uses different tempos to accent the songs has a big effect on the way they come across. As a long time Who fan I'm not going to try and convince you &quot;Face Dances&quot; is as profound as &quot;Tommy&quot; or &quot;Who's Next,&quot; because it's not, but it is a great Who release.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I have been buyin DVDs since last year, but no DVD left me as astonished as this one.<br />First of all, I must say (a must say) that this is a spectacular film, one of the must beautiful disney's masterpieces, evey single person should see it. Kids will simply love it, as it is clean an lovable, I assume that every body has seen it, so, I will not bother you repeating it.<br />The new audio tracks along with te restorated collor are great, as they are new and beautiful, but not making the restoration grotesque, it's a very soft restoration.<br />The second DVD is another work of art, the scenaries are basically the queens castle beatufully rendered. inside of which you will find the art galleries and stuff. The galleries include the evolution of te characters from the begining up to those that were drawed, I mean,up to those that were brought to life by that genie that was walter disney. This disc includesthe original script of the tale (no animation :-( ), from the brothers greem.<br />The only negative points the DVD has, are that the proof of purchase are on the back cover of the pack, so, if you want tho use them, you'll have to cut it, the othe is that the box is a tiny bit wider than any two disk set found elsewhere, but I think no one will care about it, I don't....<br />This is a must buy for every body, this along with Dumbo will make your DVD collection a great one, Kid will love them as thy are the two best movies ever created by disney.

0375703764|5.0|This book creeped the hell out of me.  I started feeling like my house (which, incidently, looks exactly like those in the appendices) was watching me.  It didn't help that I only got to read late at night.  I think any book that makes your house come alive and things breath down the back of your neck is definitely worth the loss of sleep.

B00005Q45W|4.0|Looks like ol' Lenny is back on Boogie Street. He can still write and sing like no man's god, but he's gotta cut the annoying addiction to chintzy drum loops. Give me Lenny in a room with only his voice and the sound of fingers tapping on the table-top any day. That's not to say that this isn't great stuff. After all, this is the real deal new material - not the retread best-of albums we've had to content ourselves with over the last few years. &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; is just that - ten NEW songs to sink our teeth into, and though this album isn't quite on par with &quot;The Future&quot; or &quot;I'm your Man&quot;, it runs a damn close third. I'm looking forward to wearing my CD player out on this one.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Not much to say here except that this new disc is really,really good. It is definitely not as experimental as S.C.I.E.N.C.E., but it does seem to be more outthere than Make Yourself. The disc is mellow(more so than Make Yourself), however the songs seem to flow better together.  SCIENCE was about experimenting with different types of trends and just plain craziness, the similarities between SCIENCE and Mr. Bungle type of material is incredible. Make Yourself was not as organic as SCIENCE, it was about space and not following the leader.  Morning View is all wrapped up around a personal break-up, definitely Boyd's and his ex's. The songs just have a unique quality that displays amazing craftsmanship.  I was pleased not to hear a twelve song cycle that was just &quot;Drive&quot; with many variations, which would have been easy to do after the success of the pop song. Incubus continues to show how much they will not let anyone classify them as any one type of music.  I definitely look at Incubus as being the Faith No More, most creative band of all time, of the year 2000 and beyond. Bottomline: Morningview is a creative masterpiece, no one should be disappointed with this purchase!<BR>Peace and One Love!
0060278234|4.0|Lirael is Garth Nix's continuation of Sabriel which shall apparently be followed by a third book by the name of Abhorsen. With Lirael, he begins flesh out the world created in Sabriel  and lays down the groundwork for what could be an epic series that could perhaps stretch across numerous volumes. Lirael is probably strong enough to stand on its own... though it is highly recommended that one begin with Sabriel in order to catch the richness of Nix's world that includes a wonderful play between two areas: one steeped in early twentieth century technology and the other basking in the heights of fantasy.<br />In the course of the book we discover Lirael, daughter of the Clayr who wines because it seems she will never meet the desires of her tribe because she lacks vision to see into the future. We also run across Prince Sameth, who is scared of his expected destiny as Abhorsen-in-waiting (a necromancer whose job is to keep the dead, dead). Aside from the pity parties that fill a good portion of the book, there are numerous exciting encounters with monsters... though none of them seem to be as dark and forbidding as the encounters in Sabriel.<br />Lirael is well worth the read, though it is not quite as exciting as Sabriel. I look forward to Abhorsen and hopefully some more exciting plot developments.<br />Crazy James
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I took time out last night to listen to some of my favorite Bob Dylan albums, and the conclusion I came to last night was that Dylan is one of rock's great vocalists.  He doesn't have a beautiful voice nor the range of other singers, but he's quite adept at phrasing a lyric.  More than anything--the touring band, the musical arrangements, the bouncy lyrics--Dylan's newest effort, &quot;Love and Theft,&quot; is a showcase for Dylan's voice.<br />&quot;Mississippi,&quot; an exiled track from &quot;Time Out of Mind,&quot; becomes a world-weary testament when sang by Dylan. Sheryl Crow cut a version of &quot;Mississippi&quot; in &quot;The Globe Sessions,&quot; but it came off as a rushed, amiable rocker rather than the wise, soulful song that it is.  Even in the pop arrangements for &quot;Moonlight&quot; and &quot;Bye and Bye,&quot; Dylan's voice is a marvel of innuendo and desire.  Perhaps the best song in the album is the closer, &quot;Sugar Baby.&quot; When Dylan sings, &quot;You went years without me/ You might as well keep going on,&quot; it resonates with heartbreak and resignation.  <br />Dylan, now in his sixties, may have realized that he is no longer the agile man who could growl &quot;How does it feel?&quot; and intimidate the bejeezus out of you. He is now a man, late in life, who can moan and grumble about life and all its hardships yet still sound grateful.  In many ways, Dylan was so much older then, and he's younger than that now.<br />Is &quot;Love and Theft&quot; one of Dylan's best albums?  I'm not quite sure.  I place it above &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; but it doesn't match &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot; In any case, I think it's Dylan's most delightful album.  Dylan and fun, who would have thunk it?
B00005QG9J|5.0|This cd is great<BR>its alittle acousticy, but it is still awsome<BR>some of the best tracks so far are <BR>13-Aqueous Transmission- Awsome song, quiet and brooding<BR>5-11am-great, just great<BR>the whole cd is sweet go out and buy it now
630280082X|5.0|I love classical music especially played on the guitar.  I love blues especially 12-bar slide blues.  I don't really agree that Steve Vai is a &quot;guitar god&quot; simply because he's a technique player with lack of creativity.  Kurt Cobain was totally opposite, mass creativity with little technique.  But then you have an actual &quot;Guitar God&quot; like Jimi Hendrix.  Steve Vai couldn't play &quot;Little Wing&quot; with the heart and emotion like Hendrix did.  But I still think Vai is a good guitar player.  They should've given him at least one line in the movie.
B00004THAY|4.0|Independantly nobody can hold a flame to them.  Together while not bad, they aren't exactly what I expected.  This CD far and away excels at the classic blues riffs that made them both famous, but somehow that becomes quite superficial and by the end of the CD you get the feeling as though they meant well but were rushed to create greatness.  I hope between them another CD is born.  Next time though, slow down and let the blues take it's course.  Over all a very good album but if you were expecting the \\"Greatest Blues\\" Album of all time get both of their early works, you won't be disappointed!
0440416027|5.0|Skellig is a hauntingly beautiful book about a wondrous yet painful time in a boy's life.  It is a moving and compelling story about life and death and all things over and between. It is encompassing in a gorgeous way, but not at all overwhelming. I was very impressed by David Almond's writing style.  The pacing of the story and the striking yet dreamlike creation of this world really made the story come to life.  This is a very mature book and while it would be an incredible experience for children, it is probably too intense or &quot;creepy&quot; for younger kids.  I will not be sharing it with my 6 year old sister for a few years.  As for adults--read this book. It is a good experience. Be proud that you can stop and see the magic of life, in all its fragility and its indefatigable light; perhaps its the Skellig in all of us.
0783116934|5.0|This movie is so excellent but so upsetting, I truly don't know the words to use.  I can't review it.  It was so powerful, so realistic, so horrifying...  This is a must see movie.
0767802659|5.0|Paul Verhoeven is no stranger to the unusual satire/sci-fi genre. Robocop and Total Recall show Verhoeven's trademark style of combining gory over the top violence and sly satire. Sure he's done World War II before in film(And why not? He lived in that time period), but that hasn't reached US audiences. In this WWII-esque film Verhoeven uses the standard humans versus (insert evil alien race here) tale compiled by screenwriter Ed Neumeier and producer Jon Davison to create his own vision. What follows is a War movie with a completely politically correct enemy: The arachnids.  <BR>   For one I won't bother with naming off the actors and the characters they play. Not that the actors aren't very good(In fact they play their specific roles to perfection), but...well..why get troubled over such banal, trivial, and sometimes downright boring characters? The main male character joins the army only because this girl he really digs is joining, but they get seperated and she meets someone else whom the main character has a rivalry with. Basically if the entire aliens and war part didn't exist I probably just (badly)wrote the plot of your average 90210/Melrose place episode. None of the actors have any memorable lines, none of them have the on-screen charisma of a Bruce Willis, a Russell Crowe, or even a Keanu Reeves. They're not the kind of people you'd expect to save a skyscraper filled with hostages from foreign terrorists while delievering quotable snappy one-liners while killing the bad guys with swords and guns. The only difference between us and the young people on-screen is that there is not one scene where any of them look ugly. Sure they get sliced and diced in the most disgusting of a manner, but that doesn't stop them from flashing their pearly white perfectly straight teeth or their movie-star quality hair. In short..This is a propaganda film. It's a supposed pro-war film which attempts to tell the audience, &quot;War is great, make friends, die for the country, go down as a legend, stay beautiful.&quot; That of course would explain the entire banality of all the characters, they aren't trying to sound cool or humorous, they're in the middle of a war, being fed fascist propaganda by the spoonfuls in order to become trained killing machines. The main character Casper Van Dien(Oops, giving out actor names now) loses interest in his pursuit of Denise Richards and well..everything else. He becomes a trained combat machine leading an army of followers to war against the enemy. The enemy isn't something we as americans or even humans would feel was controversial. This isn't the Vietnam or the Civil War, they're simply &quot;evil aliens bent on the destruction of humanity&quot; and we feel it would be politically correct to kill them all. But in the oh so noble goal of destroying the enemy we turn into the enemy ourselves, not joining their side by any means, but becoming the collective, a group of similar thinking people that live only by certain beliefs and instincts. Thinking outside the parameter is considered offensive and wrong, we as humans would be becoming just like them..fascists. Using violence as the only means of &quot;power&quot;. But hey this movie doesn't revolve around simple propaganda, there's also a superb action flick in there somewhere.<BR>   Starship Troopers has astounding CGI, even by 2001 standards. Incredible sequences like the Klendathu Attack(Scene: 15) and the Planet P-ambush(Scene: 24) showcase the awesome detail that has gone into these amazing creatures. And since you're dealing with a Paul Verhoeven flick you're guaranteed plenty of violence and gore. <BR>The DVD is great stuff. At the start you get your commentary from the director and the screenwriter, which goes into detail some of Verhoeven's thoughts on the film and the critics, some detail into his WW2 experience, and some truly off the wall facts. It's a pretty good commentary although he tends to speak a bit fast at times. Of course for a real challenge in trying to keep up with his motormouth, consider checking out the two special-effects sequences he narrates. You also get 5 deleted scenes, three screen tests, behind-the-scenes documentary, oh and also a french language track.<BR>  So get this DVD, watch it once, watch it again with the commentary track, notice how many Nazi references Verhoeven slipped into this work of art, and then laugh at it all. Because this film is arguably one of the wittiest action films of all time, and still holds up with the best of them if all you think of it is as a straight-laced action flick.
B00004YKUY|5.0|At first I really missed Steve Perry and still do, but take that out of the equation and this is still an EXCELLENT album.  I have really grown to love almost every song which is rare.
B0000004V2|5.0|this is the greatest album ever made. i don't know how it happened, but the band have made an album which trancends everything that you could say about it. The brilliance lies in the way the songs sound so achingly beautiful. Every note chimes, every word breaks your heart. it is a work of genius, and one which reminds you that the gap between being great, and being genius, is vast. People will listen to this album in a thousand years time, and be moved. they are almost too good to be real, and the way they crashed and burned, it's like the world couldn't cope with something so perfect. i saw these live once when i was a kid, listen to this cd and you'll know what i mean.
0452282152|1.0|I know many people like this book so I just want to address those potential readers who might think this is a literary read. It's not.  There is no depth of character, no attempt to describe what life would have been like in the 17th century for a girl like this, virtually nothing about the Holland of Vermeer's time, to the point where it is clear this was never the concern of the author.  Just a nice, simple romance novel dressed up in a upmarket dust jacket.  Like another reviewer said, it will make a sumptuous Merchant Ivory film, and that will probably improve it.  That cover is very deceptive; there's nothing to &quot;look at&quot; as you read, just the thoughts of a nice girl thinking about love in what could easily be translated to a wealthy bohemian artists' community in suburban America.
0380973650|5.0|As a big Gaiman fan, I'm probably prejudiced in favor of his books, but I still have to say that I was quite taken with this book.  I bought it the day it came out and was done with it in less than 24 hours.  Without trying to give anything away, I have to say that I really enjoyed all of the obscure references made in American Gods to (what else) various gods and other mythic figures.  The concept, while not necessarily original, was presented here in a fresh perspective.  The main character, Shadow, while at first glance a rather shallow character, turns out to be exceedingly deep and multi-faceted upon closer inspection (sorry for all of those literary clich&eacute;s).<br />One should not go into this expecting Stardust II.  At the same time, while American Gods shares a tome similar to that in the Sandman series, one shouldn't be looking for another Morpheus story.  This novel is a category into itself in Gaiman's repertoire.  In other words, being a Gaiman fan is no guarantee that you'll like it; at the same time, even if you didn't like his other books, this novel might still be accessible.
020161622X|5.0|Some of the items in this book are common sense, and yet I still found myself thinking about things in a new way after reading this book.  The authors make the information very approachable and enjoyable to read.  With item titles such as The Cat Ate My Software and Stone Soup and Boiled Frogs, they use humor to get across good practices in the work place.  The items touch on all aspects of the development life cycle as well as some general workplace issues such as communication and maintaining your skills.  What really makes the advice valuable, though, is that it is not pie in the sky theory, but rather practicle guidelines that are can be used day in and day out.  Whatever type of programming you do, this book will help you do it better.
B000002WPI|5.0|Every couple of years or so there is a person or group ,in this case, that gives the hip-hop world something it has never seen before which changes things from that point on. The Wu-Tang Clan was that group in the early 90's. Signature flows, personalities and beats set them apart then and still does till this day. Definitely a classic!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus said in a guitar one magazine article, that if they made the same album twice and the fans still like it they have failed, but they did not fail on this album, all of the songs are great and  the lyrics are awesome.<BR>    The guitar riff's are extremly good and well-written, but the only bad song on this album is the last one.  This band is probably one of the best bands because thier previous album is still high on the charts.  Both albums Make yourself and Morning View are both must-buy CD's.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This has got to be the best album ever by any artist! There is never a time when listening to this that you ever want to skip a song. Billie Jean, Beat, Thriller, Human Nature, The Girl is Mine featuring Paul MaCartny, every song is a classic and a big part of music history. Plus, the extra tracks on this album are great for any MJ lover! The best selling album of all time by the best selling solo artist of all time. You can't go wrong with this one!!!!!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Who could fail to be moved by this subtle adaptation of Jane Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot;? Of all the Jane Austen features of the last six years or so, this is my personal favorite; in fact, it's one of my ten most favorite movies. It has an intimate feel to it that the other films, good though they are, lack. A wonderful example of this is the scene at the Great House, where the characters are assembled for a dinner given by the Musgroves. The flickering of the candles and the low ceilings convey a gathering where good conversation among genial people flourishes, somewhat reminiscent of &quot;Babette's Feast&quot;. <br />&quot;Persuasion&quot; concerns Anne Elliot and her lost love, Captain Wentworth. Eight years before the start of the picture, she had refused his marriage proposal, having been persuaded by a family friend that it would be an unsuitable match. Anne, you see, is the daughter of a baronet, while Edward is of no particular lineage. During these years, she has lost both her spirits and her looks, we are told. Then, chance brings Edward back into her life, but as the suitor of a family friend, a much younger woman who is quite vivacious--and he bears a grudge against Anne for her lack of personal conviction. Like all Jane Austen novels, the story then hinges upon whether a hopeless romantic situation can be brought round to our satisfaction.    <br />&quot;Persuasion&quot; is the sort of film you can watch again and again, just as if you were visiting with an old friend. Try it out for yourself, and I'm sure you'll be persuaded to agree with me!
B000002TP7|4.0|After the success of &quot;licensed to Ill&quot; this album was not what some so-called Beastie Boy's fan's expected from their follow-up. Initially upon hearing it I was a little disappointed about not getting instant gratification like on the prior album but after really listening to the album I learned to appreciate their new direction musically. This was the album where you start to see the Beasties march to the beat of their own drummer. I swear you can listen to one song 3 times and get something different from it everytime not only lyrically but muscially. The Beasties definitely started going in a different direction on this one. There's songs like &quot;3 Piece chicken dinner&quot;, &quot;B-Boy Bouillabase&quot; that are just as colorful as their titles. This is the blueprint for all the albums that followed it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The film was mesmerizing. The soundtrack's &quot;Bona-fide!&quot;
B00005QGAV|5.0|Michael teamed up with Teddy Riley for this album and the results are just amazing!!! The two's styles fit together like one of MJ's sequenced gloves. Black or White, Remember the Time, Who is It, Keep it in the Closet, and Jam are all great singles off of an album where 95% is radio quality! Give Into Me, one of Michael's rock numbers will leave you in chills as you listen to the passion flowing from Michael. And classic MJ anthems like Will You Be There, Keep the Faith (a very overlooked song) and the song that is most sure to get stuck in your head Heal The World are great additions to the album. But in the end it is the albums final track that will down as one of my favorite, Dangerous!!!
B00003CXAA|5.0|Damn... I'm still stunned from the preformances. I don't need to say any more than mamamia get this Blockbuster of a movie, or more appropiatly should I say the milestone of cinematic history forever
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is an amazing anime feature reminding me a little of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Except that was Chinese Folklore). It has simplistic yet very professional and detailed animation by Hayao Miyazaki. Featuring a beautiful instrumental score rendered by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. This movie is set in isolationist Japan, and is filled with eastern/Japanese cultural elements for us westerners to attempt to understand. Along with a decent fantasy helping of personified animals and Gods. Be careful watching it if you can constitute a western audience member. This isn't a tree hugger movie like Fern Gully (me shudders). If you think this movie has contemporary western political motives then you are thinking too hard! I had to stop myself and just enjoy it. The story really has no antagonist because both sides in the story are equally guilty of one emotion (try and find the best line in the movie that sums up what I just said)...plus it smacks of Eastern values and mythology. And that's all I'm going to say about the story. If a devout conservative can love this movie...anyone can. Leave the soap box at home. Incidentally the english dub features the voices of American Hollywood stars such as Gillian Anderson (The X-Files)and Billy Bob Thorton (Armageddon, Pushing Tin, etc...)...But don't tell the real Anime buffs that I watched it dubbed...lol...I know only real anime fans watch subbed anime.
B00003CXSP|2.0|I purchased Hannible the same time I picked up The Silence of The Lambs Special Edition, because of the \\"Save ... when you purchase both movies\\" coupon on the covers.  Having not seen Hannibal previous to my purchase, I thought,\\"What the hell...I'll save a couple bucks.\\"  I could have saved the entire purchase price and rented this piece of junk.  Though, it picks up where \\"Silence\\", left off, Jodi Foster isn't in it, and the plot seems dorky.  Way too ... for such a dull movie.  If you enjoyed \\"Silence\\", get it...but don't waste your time or money on this one.  Rent it first, then decide whether you really want to add this ... to your collection.  Anyone wanna buy a copy?
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album marked the begining of Michael's reign as King of Pop. Michael's voice in songs such as Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, She's Out of My Life, Rock With You and Can't Help It are amazingly smooth and soulful. And like any MJ album there are always the tracks that make you want to just get up and dance! The extra tracks on this album are a must hear for any MJ fan!!!
B00005OB0A|5.0|Is defintly a great album is a shame that her record company is not willing to release the domestic version would be a great succes, the album is really dance and good beats for each song, definitly the best album from Kylie really worthy to buy it and keep as one of the favorites. Right now the album is one of the favorites in Europe. If you'd like Light Years this is better yet.
B00005QGAX|5.0|Michael is by far one of the most inventive people in the music business. You'll never hear two songs that sound any where near the same and while being this creative he still remains on top. With this album, the follow up to the best selling album of all time, Thriller, Michael takes a totally different path musically and gives his music a little more edge. Bad, Speed Demon, The Way You Make Me Feel, Dirty Diana, and Leave Me Alone are all prime example of this. In many of these songs Michael is singing rock better than the rocker who've been doing in for decades. This album also marks the begining of Michael signature anthems. If for nothing else get this album simply for Man in the Mirror! A true classic that the world will be listening to for generations to come (&quot;If you want to make the world a better place take a look at yourself and make a change.&quot;)<br />This album was also the first album ever to have 6 #1 singles (Smooth Criminal, Bad, The Way You Make Me Feel, Leave Me Alone, Man in the Mirror, and Another Part of Me). This is a truly classic album.
B00005NVDI|5.0|&quot;That Which Survives&quot; is the reason I am adding Vol.35 to my collection. There are a lot of episodes I could not stand and will not purchase.  I will purchase one or two more as they become available. Video quality of these episodes is incredible. They must have produced the original series in 35mm film.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Despite what most think, hype does not make an album bad, especially this one, which could be what we have all been waiting for in terms of a revolution.  It is tempting to jump at any band as an excuse to declare teen pop over, and this may be another red herring, yet it is impossible to ignore the energy and catchy-ness of this album, which makes it comparable to Nevermind, in that it crosses genres with a smile rather than a roar.  A strong showing by The Strokes could change music as we know it, and that would be nothing but a good thing.
B00005AWMF|5.0|I'm 19. Until I saw her &quot;By Your Side&quot; video on MTV2, I had never heard of Sade. It is the name of both a band and its singer. A little research showed that she was the UK equivalent of Whitney Houston (in terms of productivity and popularity). Her name is pronounced &quot;Shar-day&quot;, not &quot;Sha-day&quot;. Unlike Whitney, Sade actually writes her own material. Also, Sade doesn't the glass-shattering range of other divas like Whitney, Celine or Mariah. Rather, her voice is smoky and smooth. She doesn't oversell her vocals. This compilation shows the Sade is a talented songwriter who is able to sing ballads well. The controversial DJ Star of Hot 97 lauded Sade's live show as the best he has ever heard. The band is incredibly tight and flawless. Music critics say that Sade has a distinctive sound, that she is a genre unto herself. I would counter that her sound has changed considerably over the years.<br />Some tracks I prefer to others. &quot;The Sweetest Taboo&quot; is my absolute favorite. Some say that it is repetitive, but it hypnotizes me. When she sustains a note in the first bridge (Don't let it slip a-waaaayyyyy), it really pierces my soul. Les Nubians do a good cover called &quot;Tabou&quot;. I also like &quot;Nothing Can Come Between Us&quot;, because of it's lush but funk-inflected sound. I wish that Sade did more upbeat music. &quot;Smooth Operator&quot; is the song with island beats that helped millions conceive, and it established Sade as an icon. &quot;Love is Stronger Than Pride&quot; is an interesting New Age experiment. &quot;Is it a Crime&quot; is a great torch-burner. I'm not a big sax fan, and sometimes Stuart Matthewman (who collaborates with Maxwell) overblows his horn. In this sense, I am glad that Sade has shifted to tasteful acoustic guitars with the new album, &quot;Lovers Rock&quot;.<br />I could go on and on about the tracks, but I will try to sum up my feelings about Sade. Sometimes, the music is sparely orchestrated. Sometimes, it is quite lush. The songs sometimes sound dated, but this is probably because American contemporary R&amp;B is nothing like her own distinctive style. Sade's vocals and music are both very nuanced. &quot;Like A Tattoo&quot; is a great example of this. You can hear the raw emotion in every song; she really pours her heart out. Unlike Dido, for example, Sade seems to be doing more than singing off the sheet music.
B00005N9CV|4.0|This CD doesn't quite measure up to Diana's last CD WHEN I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES, but its is pretty satisfying.  If you like the piano stylings of BEEGIE ADAIR, you'll like Diana Krall playing also..
B000005IU2|5.0|This is by far the Stooges' best and most satisfying work.  Iggy Pop has often expressed his enthusiasm for the improvisational aspects of jazz and this type of free-flowing groove permeates the entire song cycle.  Enough has been said about the Stooges anti-establishment punk/outsider stance and Iggy's street-lyrics.  In my opinion, the most important aspect of this album is how the songs function as a cohesive whole--- from the opening track to the psychedelic jam/rant LA Blues... Also of interest are Iggy's intense vocal stylings, which are at their most effective in the uncompromising rocker TV EYE.  His vox combine the unpolished grit of Lou Reed with Jim Morrison dark, brooding baritone.  He uses these influences to create a style that is innovative and exciting rather than merely derivative.  <BR>     Fun House presents Iggy at his most Raw, before being transformed by Bowie into the more theatrical, glam oriented prophet of doom that has essentially been Iggy's shtick since Raw Power.  Funhouse is Detroit Rock at its finest, serving as a crucial blueprint for punk, post-punk, new wave and noise/art rock outfits to come.  Not to be forgotten are the simplistic yet addictive guitar riffs that suit both the nature of the songs as well as the band's general musical direction.  Rarely does a band hit the mark in bringing their conception of a certain sound to fruition in the studio.  Although fairly polished, by Stooges standards, there remains a loose, live feel that helps the recording stand up to repeated listening...offering something new and exciting upon repeated plays.  Truly a nice blend of pure rock, experimentation and musical innovation.  Sounds rather fresh more than 30 years later, especially in the less-than-satisfying rock climate of the past few years. * * * * *
B000001FTD|5.0|This album Among the Living, is one of Anthrax's finest albums. It's hard core and is just all in all a Great album. If you love to listen to classic metal, this is the album to get!
B00003CXQX|5.0|After seeing this movie the first time, I told all my friends they had to see it (I'm 16 years old).  A friend of mine that goes to college was skeptical (to say the least; he wouldn't even buy his own ticket!), protesting that it was a &quot;kids' movie&quot;.  He laughed his head off.  That's how this movie is; you can't help but laugh.  I recommend this movie for anyone of any age.  Warning:  The first fifteen minutes or so are just kinda stupid, but don't let that stop you from watching one of the funniest movies ever.
0783211856|5.0|Schindlers list is the master at his best. its a pity that his next war movie saving private ryan was not a patch on this one. this movie, unlike SPR has the human element in it. <br />The movies is an outstanding truelife story of one man's realisation of the horrors of war. i wish the world leaders of today, who are eager to pull the trigger to avenge the injustice done to them, will take time off and watch this long but touching movie. spielberg uses excellent cinematic techniques to showcase the horrors of war. though the movie is quite often disturbing, that is the intention. <br />the use of black and white throughout the movie is even more striking, especially in contrast with the only colour used in two scenes. Schindlers list is a powerful war movie and is rather long, but it is well worth a patient watch, there will be no dry eyes at the end of this classic movie.<br />The gas chambers were especially disturbing with actors like Brett Weston being extremely hard to look at.<br />probably spielberg's best and one of the alltime greatest movies

B00005QY5Y|5.0|I'm a long time listener (first time caller), of Ryan Adams and this album is the best one that i've heard in a long time. You can hear that talent and emotion that went into making this album and its great to see the progression in his music. If you're not familiar with Ryan's music then this album is an excellent way to get acquainted, and if you are familiar with him then I don't need to convince you that this album is fantastic.
B00000I8UK|5.0|This is true art and if you like post bop, avantgarde jazz, played by a couple of jazzhistorys best musicians, this one is one of the records you must/should have. Dolphy played togheter with John Coltrane, Oliver Nelson, Charles Mingus and so on. Comuscisians played with Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock... and that fact tells me a lot. This is avantgarde jazz at its peak.<br />If you like tradjazz... dont bother (nothing wrong about tradjazz... but...).

1567184855|5.0|I have just finished reading this book for the second time, and I am still in awe of the depth and breadth of meaning contained in this book. 'What is the meaning of life' is probably the oldest and most difficult to answer of all possible questions. The material in this book, culled from years in professional practice regressing clients to the period AFTER death and BEFORE birth, gives the first no-nonsense yet clear and immeasurably inspiring answer to that question. Without doubt, the more people who read this book, the better for the whole world.
0520201795|5.0|The Frankenstein monster is truly one of the most tragic characters in classic literature.  He is obviously quite brilliant, having learned to speak (rather eloquently, I might add), and to read simply by secretly watching others.  He's sensitive, kind, and appreciative of nature's beauty-all of the most admirable characteristics of a wonderful soul.  And yet, he is vilified by all who come in contact with him because of his physical repulsiveness.<br />His longing for love, especially from Victor, was so painful that it became difficult for me to read.  I kept hoping he'd find someone to show him the littlest bit of kindness.  His turn to violence is entirely understandable, and Victor's irresponsibility toward his creation is despicable.  Victor, who is outwardly handsome but cowardly and cruel, is the story's true monster.<br />In addition to writing a captivating story, Shelley raises many social issues that are still relevant today, nearly 200 years later, and the book provides a superb argument against *ever* cloning a human being.<br />(Note: I have the edition with the marvelous woodcut illustrations by Barry Moser and the Joyce Carol Oates afterword - superb!)

B000002NJS|5.0|&quot;Ray of Light&quot; was looked at skeptically before its release, since it was Madonna's first release since 1994's excellent R&amp;B outing, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;.  However, &quot;Ray&quot; shocked not only her fans but critics at how amazingly unique and rich the album truly is.<br />Opening with &quot;Drowned World/Subsitute For Love&quot;, Madonna's matured and beautifully cascaded voice (thanks largelyt in part due to &quot;Evita&quot;) interwines perfectly with the synthetic and electronic sounds that the song has to offer.  Claiming how she &quot;traded fame for love, without a second thought&quot;, we see Madonna's transformation into a more mature artist, but a mother.<br />The title track is just as beautifully orchestrated, with a contagious and infectious dance trance that compells anyone to get up and dance.  Being the most popular track released from the album, the &quot;Ray of Light&quot; track shows how Madonna's full step into the techno world didn't turn away any heads -- only gathered more.<br />One of the most disappointing things of the album, however, has nothing to do of its music, but of its release.  &quot;Sky Fits Heaven&quot;, an incredibly brilliantly orchestrated track, was never released as a single to show the album's true talent.  However, it did not deteriorate from the album's success nor reputation.<br />&quot;Ray of Light&quot; is truly an marvelously unique music experience, offering one of music's greatest artist with a music form that is just reaching its capabilities.
B00003CWTH|5.0|As others mentioned -- this movie is amazing.  I think the fact that people react strongly to it (either positively or negatively) speaks for it.  It takes some risks ... it's not like every other movie ...  <BR> <BR>Such people with such faults -- the faults of people who try their whole lives to get it right --some of them very mistaken about what they are to do the whole time.   the worst of them and the best of them.  And hopefully most of them learn throughout this single day that: <BR>--- we may be through with the past<BR>but the past isn't through with us --<BR>the message that you don't move on until you come to terms with your past and what you've done.  Call it karma, or whatever else you want to call it ... it is a powerful message<BR> <BR>In the end, as Officer Jim Kurring tells us in his voice over narration &quot;Sometimes people need a little help. Sometimes people need to be forgiven....&quot; In the last scene, Jim Kurring's narration takes us to Claudia, and she has a long, vacant look into the camera.  And then, she smiles. So simple, so bright.   I had not seen her smile once during the entire film.  It is a powerful film.  And it is worth three hours to see that smile and know what it means.
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park's &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; (ironically the band's original name) is an incredible rock album that, for truly the first time, perfectly combines a hard rock voice talent, Chester Bennington, with smooth rapping skills from MC Mike Shinoda.<br />Along with the other members of their band, Linkin Park creates a surreal and often envigorating look into a hard rock album.  Their opening track, &quot;Papercut&quot;, is truly one of the best opening numbers on a rock/rap cut, providing a truly powerful track that is enduring and powerful.<br />&quot;One Step Closer&quot;, the band's first single, has become slightly overplayed but still remains a great piece to the album.  However, lyrically, &quot;In The End&quot; provides for the album's finest tune, perfectly combining a great lyric with incredible music and vocal talent.  <br />Linkin Park has, quite possibly, released one of the best rock albums of the year with &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, though the shockingly fast uprisal of the band's popularity may underscore their actual talent.
0893860220|5.0|Its the most amazing book i have ever read in my entire life.<BR>nor do i think i will ever get to read any other book like this.<BR>It metamorphasized my entire way of thinking and continues to<BR>do so in subtle ways that i cannot express in words.<br />If you want a fearless, mind shattering exposition to Jnana Yoga<BR>since Bhagwan Krishna in the Bhagawad Gita, GO FOR THIS book.<br />I hope it reaches people in all walks of life and help people<BR>to realize what matters most. The self, The Atman.<br />THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVOURITE BOOK.
B000002MFN|5.0|Madonna's &quot;Erotica&quot; album was, and largely remains, one of her most misunderstood and underrated pieces of work.  One of the larger reasons simply being the onslaught of what was called her &quot;Sex Era&quot; with the release of her extremely graphic (though artistically tasteful) book entitled &quot;Sex&quot; and the release of the awful &quot;Body of Evidence&quot; film.  This causes a vicious backlash on the view of her musical talent which was, and still remains, truly remarkable.<br />&quot;Erotica&quot;, the opening song of the album, uses a strange mix of R&amp;B and acid-style rock rhythms to exfoliate a truly erotic feeling of submission.  Her detailing of dominating over you brought what was the first sense of a bondage/S&amp;M theme into the mainstream -- letting everyone know that it is thought about, even in the most famous of minds.  With such an envigorating opening, the album lays forth an amazing mix of dance, pop, R&amp;B and trance music that was largely misconcepted as &quot;raunchy&quot;.<br />&quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;In This Life&quot; are beautifully written ballads (one which addresses the harsh topic of losing a friend to AIDS) with amazing lyrical and musical composition.  The contagious dance tracks of &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Deeper and Deeper&quot; are true testaments to Madonna's roots: she can make you get up and dance no matter where you're sitting.<br />But what seems to be the most amazing thing of the &quot;Erotica&quot; album is that it remains to be her most personal -- and mind-blowing -- album that she has released.  I recommend it fully to those that wish to experience a unique musical outlook, those with an open mind to different ways of thinking whether it be conventional or sexual.  It is truly an amazing piece of work, transforming yet another face of Madonna to add to her amazing collection of achievements.
B00005AFVR|4.0|As a huge Springsteen fan, I couldn't wait till I got Live in NYC. It came in the form of a birthday present- I turned seventeen four days after Bruce turned fifty-two  :)  <BR>The first CD begins with &quot;My Love Will Not Let You Down.&quot;  I'd never heard this one before, but I liked it a lot for its fast pace.<BR>Next came a scorching &quot;Prove it all Night,&quot; one of my all time favorites, followed by &quot;Two Hearts,&quot; on which you can really see the dynamic that is Bruce and Steve Van Zandt.  <br />&quot;Atlantic City&quot; was next, a slightly faster version than the original, also one of my favorites.  &quot;Mansion on the Hill&quot; and &quot;The River&quot; didn't stand out to me too much, although I love Patti Scialfa and enjoyed hearing her on the former song.  <BR>&quot;Youngstown&quot; quickly became one of my favorites; Bruce sounds tortured as he's singing this one and it touched my heart.  &quot;Murder, Incorporated&quot;- awesome song all around.  Loved Max Weinberg's drumming on this one.  Followed by the classic &quot;Badlands.&quot; Disc 1 closed with &quot;Out in the Street,&quot; which sounds Phil Spector/Ronettes influenced due to the little whoa-oh's- this is my absolute favorite on the whole album.  Also, there is a hidden &quot;Born to Run&quot; on this disc.<br />Disc 2 begins with &quot;Tenth Ave. Freeze-Out.&quot;  I love this song, I've loved it since I was a little girl, but I'm sorry, the version on Live 1975-85 was a lot better.  &quot;Land of Hope &amp; Dreams&quot; is a new song, and a beautiful one- damn near cried the first time I heard it. <br />Then the controversial &quot;American Skin (41 Shots).&quot;  I apologize, but I haven't listened to this yet and I doubt I will, for I know it will bring my entire mood down and just depress me.  I've read the lyrics and that was saddening enough.<br />&quot;Lost in the Flood&quot;- so-so.  I like the original much better.<BR>&quot;Born in the USA&quot;- see above.  I also like the version on Live 1975-85.<BR>&quot;Don't Look Back&quot;- Also new to my ears- I like it.  It's got a good beat.<BR>&quot;Jungleland&quot;- Call me closeminded, I like the original.<BR>&quot;Ramrod&quot;- Love this!!  Typical Bruce, what with the sexual/automobile metaphors flying.<BR>&quot;If I Should Fall Behind&quot;- This just didn't make a blip on my radar although it's definitely a nice song.<br />All in all, I was very content with Live in NYC.  I would've liked to see &quot;Candy's Room&quot; on there, or &quot;Backstreets,&quot; but we take what we get.  Awesome album; Bruce just gets better with age.
B00004X01U|4.0|&quot;Music&quot;, the strangely simple titled release by Madonna, is quite a complex album that covers her continuing look into the techno/electronica world.  She, just as she did in &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, expands on the popular form of music to give a more unique and intriguing look to it.<br />Though slightly inferior to her brilliant &quot;Ray of Light&quot; album, Madonna's &quot;Music&quot; gives us a single track (the title track) that reminds us of her catchy, older tunes such as &quot;Into the Groove&quot; or &quot;Vogue&quot;.  The simplicity of the lyric, much like that of her first hit &quot;Holiday&quot;, gives us that infectious vibration that makes us get our groove on.  Along with &quot;Music&quot;, an ironically impressive &quot;Impressive Instant&quot; is quite a catchy tune, putting out a trance that is both danceable and relaxing.<br />Lyrically, &quot;Music&quot; is amazing; she covers complex tracks such as &quot;Runaway Lover&quot; and &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot; to simple, almost poetic tracks like &quot;Don't Tell Me&quot; and the amazing ballad &quot;Gone&quot;.  However, the album's golden lyric would have to be &quot;What It Feels Like For A Girl&quot;, an incredible leap that shows Madonna's direct talent in her writing ability.<br />Once again, Madonna has proven that she can withstand the harsh tick of the clock, giving us an envigorating album that intensifies the electronica music genre with simple ease.
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is the best book I have ever read. This novel is so wonderful, I wish I had never read it just so I could read it again! The wonderful charactes and charming plot make this novel one of the best of all time. Its wit and charm make any reader simply fall in love with it. I highly reccomend it!
B000002MUW|4.0|Madonna's &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; -- an album that openly takes on the fact that critics, quite pre-maturely, declared her &quot;over with&quot; -- is an amazing cast of light on Madonna's career.  Its mixes of R&amp;B and hip-hop sounds create a soothing and relaxing environment that can either make you dance or calm you down.<br />The first single released from the album, as well as one of her most popular to date, &quot;Secret&quot;, is an amazing acoustic ballad/pop song that is as much lyrically talented as it is catchy.  Madonna's strong, deepened voice (compared to the higher pitch of her earlier works) gives a sense of longing that creates a mood for the track that is truly awesome.<br />The title track, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot;, offers Madonna's first true step into techno... Which probably led the way for her work in her &quot;Ray of Light&quot; and &quot;Music&quot; album.  Its peculiar sounds and simplistic lyrical composition sends a sense of relaxation no matter where you are.  <br />Highlights of the CD include her very intriguing and open attitude &quot;Human Nature&quot;, one of the album's most hip-hop oriented sound but one of the most powerful lyrical approaches.  &quot;Inside of Me&quot; and &quot;Sanctuary&quot; remain Madonna's softer side, as well as the extremely popular ballad &quot;Take A Bow&quot; with R&amp;B producer/artist Babyface.<br />&quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is truly a relaxing and soothing album that offers a range of of R&amp;B sounds often accompanied with strange hints of hip-hop and acoustics.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I have been searching for a beatles collection for long time now. Either collections were bad or were split up into too many volumes. Here at last i have found my right choice with most of the songs i love.<br />If you are new to beatles or have very less collections you must have this.<br />Cheers!
B000002LND|5.0|&quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, the first collection of greatest hits to come from Madonna, is no doubt an incredible array of Madonna's career.  Filled with infectious and familiar tracks, &quot;Immaculate&quot; boasts the best single collection of Madonna's most popular songs.<br />Opening with &quot;Holiday&quot;, her first hit back in the early 80's and cascading through her early works in the beginning of the album, it offers the nostalgic sense of seeing her for the first time.  &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; and &quot;Material Girl&quot; soon come on, popular numbers that can only bring back the image of her groping herself on MTV's stage in 1984.<br />Flying through the years, we see her seemingly anti-abortion song &quot;Papa Don't Preach&quot; and her most incredible ballad to date, &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, a strikingly powerful and beautifully constructed song.<br />Ironically, the true treat of the package is the at-the-time-of-release new songs, &quot;Justify My Love&quot; and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;.  &quot;Justify&quot;, an amazing hypnotic mix of strange percussions and whisperings, proves that Madonna can offer up something new without destroying its popularity.  It's highly sexual attitude creates a serene mood that is truly amazing.  &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, a quite rhythmic dance track, has that deepness that Madonna incorporated into her voice that adds a large bonus to the value of the performance.<br />This album also includes large hits like &quot;Into The Groove&quot;, &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, and her largest single of her career, the two-times platinum dance track &quot;Vogue&quot;.  Truly recommended for those who enjoyed the 80's/early 90's as well as Madonna's career.
0061040967|5.0|Despite being shorter, this is not a kids' Discworld book but a fully adult novella. Pratchett returns Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde (see &quot;Interesting Times&quot; for more information) to center stage with their plan to challenge the gods of discworld. Meanwhile some of Ankh-Morpork's finest -- Leonardo of Quirm, Rincewind the 'wizzard' and the stalwart Captain Carrot -- are being sent to stop them in the Disc's second spacecraft. (Rincewind gets to choose the motto for the mission patch -- &quot;we who are about to die don't want to.&quot;) The illustrations are gorgeous. Given the brevity of the story there aren't quite as many layers as in the standard Pratchett, but what is here is top quality.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I really enjoyed this album.  It is great!  I would give it ten stars if I could.  It has the Beatles most popular songs on it.
0061040967|4.0|This installation of the classic DISCWORLD series features Rincewind, Carrot, Leonard De Quirm and The Silver Horde as Cohen the barbarian (and friends) decide to return something special to the Gods. Moreover, in this illustrated book, the illustrations actually do add to the book and are like something out of a fantasy art book.<br />While maybe not &quot;the best&quot; discworld book out there, I feel that this is still in the upper echelon of the reluctant series.<br />If you are new to the series, you may want to read &quot;Interesting Times&quot; and &quot;Guards Guards&quot; first as these will give you a bit more background.  However, being new, it may be helpful for you to actually see some of the players in the drama via the illustrations.  It's hard to go wrong with a discworld book.<br />In conclusion, this is a funny book which provides a great diversion from the real (ie round) world. Only Mr Pratchett<br />can turn a line like, &quot;Houston, we have a problem&quot; into &quot;Ankh-Morpork, we have an orangutan.&quot;<br />Enjoy! and happy reading.
B00004Y87I|5.0|I really enjoy this Danny Kaye film and would give it more starsif I could! It is very entertaining and funny.Virginia Mayo and Danny Kaye make a wonderful couple in it and it's very romantic and lovely to watch, with great costumes also and is very funny and enchanting as well. It's a film for children as well, the entire family would enjoy it.  Danny Kaye is one of the best comedines ever.  This is a must see film.  They don't make them like this anymore.  Such innocent fun and old fashioned romance.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Why is this the missing link? I'll tell you why. Fungus Amongus was where it all started, pure funk. S.C.I.E.N.C.E. was probably Incubus's best album, a synthesis of funk and alt-metal. Make Yourself was a trippy, melodious journey that had cooled down considerably, but still rocked. Wait! What happened? Where is the buffer between S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself? That is where Morning View comes in. It is the perfect blend of MY's melody and mellowness, and S.C.I.E.N.C.E.'s pure assault. The opening tracks, &quot;Nice To Know You,&quot; &quot;Circles,&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; and &quot;Blood On The Ground,&quot; are heavy, rocking tracks like those found on S.C.I.E.N.C.E, with that little dash of rap tossed in. Softer songs like &quot;Mexico,&quot; &quot;Just A Phase,&quot; &quot;11:00AM,&quot; and &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; are very reminescent of MY. Some of these songs even have string sections, which add an interesting new flavor, and some tracks, like &quot;Circles,&quot; bring back slight memories from FA. Some songs, like &quot;Have You Ever,&quot; and &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; are different than anything ever, with new riffs and sounds, especially the latter. All in all, what you may find most surprising about this album is that Incubus HASN'T sold out (yet). Morning View may be new, but it sounds of old. It looks like Incubus has found their 'own' sound. I actually like Morning View better than Make Yourself. It's not as good as S.C.I.E.N.C.E, but no Incubus CD will ever touch S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Get it yourself and decide.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album, in my opinion, was where the Clash started to leave behind their original punk rock sound and explore a wide range of different musical genres. Though I'm just stating the obvious; everybody already knows this. But what shocks me about this album even today is how consistantly great it is. Each track is as good as the last (with perhaps one or two acceptions). I admit I'm not an old Clash fan as most other people, but this album was what got me really into the Clash. Well, more specifically, the title song, which caused me to buy the whole album.<br />After I bought it, I was a little surprised to hear the songs. I admit that at first I didn't really like it, mainly because I was expecting to hear their older punk music. What I got instead was infinitly better. I remember reading down the track list, hoping that the name of a song might give away it's style. I came across track 4, &quot;Hateful&quot;, and figured &quot;oh, it's called Hateful...it MUST be a punk song!&quot; Imagine my surprise when I actually heard it. I fell in love. Hateful remains my favorite song on the album...perhaps my favorite Clash song all-together.<br />In the long run, this album is spectacular. It was this album that would later get me into Joe Strummer's work with the Mescaleros. In fact, just yesterday I got back from San Francisco where I saw Joe playing. He and the Mescaleros played mostly their work, plus some classic Clash tunes, such as Rudie Can't Fail, Bankrobber, I Fought The Law, Police and Thieves, London's Burning, and even ended on a Ramones cover of Blitzkrieg Bop.<br />In the end, my absolute favorites are Brand New Cadillac, Hateful, Rudie Can't Fail, Spanish Bombs, Lost in the Supermarket, Guns of Brixton, Koka Kola, Card Cheat and Train in Vain. But I won't bore you any further. Just go out and buy the album. It doesn't matter what genre of music you like, from country to rockabilly to punk to ska to Oi to rap...you won't be disappointed

The best song is definitely \\"Nice To Know You,\\" for its perfect blend of heavy and mellow, with a sweet riff that reappears all throughout the song. The worst song: \\"Aqueous Transmission\\". All in all, what you may find most surprising about this album is that Incubus HASN'T sold out (yet). Morning View may be new, but it sounds of old. It looks like Incubus has found their 'own' sound. I actually like Morning View better than Make Yourself, simply because MV is much more diverse, and, unlike MY, the choruses all actually sound different. It's not as good as S.C.I.E.N.C.E, but no Incubus CD will ever touch S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Get it yourself and decide.
6304595247|4.0|Studying Emily Bronte's novel for my A-level English Literture course, I immediately fell in love with the intensity and passionate nature of the story and had high hopes for the video. I was not disappointed. Ralph Fiennes, to me, was the epitome of Heathcliff and he managed to create a feeling of sympathy for a character many would claim little deserved it. The scene when Cathy is lying dead and he breaks in to see her was truly heartbreaking and it certainly had me in tears. The soundtrack was very atmospheric and certainly added to the overall success of the film. The only slight criticism was the accents of the characters (yet, again Fiennes was excellenet), but Juliette Binoche's  French accent spoilt it slightly for me, and those words she did pronounce in an English fashion were not spoken in traditional Yorkshire dialect as I would have expected. Nevertheless, this is just nit-picking and the overall effect was a film that definately stays with you once the television has been switched off.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall has almost no feeling on this CD. I like her piano playing, possibly she should do more of that. It seems almost like she is being put together by the record company, much like a pop artist. She might be better off fighting for some artistic integrity in the long run.
0767805712|5.0|'Gattaca' is a brilliantly made movie, starting with a superbly written script, adding a moving plot, interesting subplots, solid acting and finale-ing with a chilling message that could very well haunt our future.  <BR>Watch it and enjoy, and then spend the rest of the night pondering the message.
B00000I4XR|5.0|A great movie to have on DVD. There are lots of extra's on this DVD like interviems, deleted scenes, and a little Jaws Trivia. Some of the things they had to do to make this movie seem as real as possible will truly amaze you. And the movie? Well, it's a classic and it still scares the.... out of me.Well, you know. If you don't know, get this movie and find out.
B000006YGY|5.0|Never had I ever known a prog band where the fans were so divided as Eloy. I can understand why fans might be divided over Yes or Genesis since they did turn to more generic pop in the 1980s, but with Eloy it seems that each time the band witnesses another lineup change, they changed their sound and many fans of Eloy's certain sound might not be a fan of their next sound. That's why I see lots of bickering over whether people like Inside and Floating the best, Dawn, Ocean, and Silent Cries the best, or Colours, Planets, Time to Turn, and Metromania the best. For me it's Ocean, particularly because I have a '70s bias. Let me tell you, Ocean is some of the most stunning progressive space rock I have ever heard in my life! A wonderful concept album about the rise and destruction of Atlantis, I really felt Frank Bornemann did the right thing when he added bassist Klaus-Peter Matziol, keyboardist Detlev Schmidtchen, and drummer Jrgen Rosenthal to the band because never before or after had Eloy created such mindblowing work as with this lineup, as Ocean demonstrates. People seem to think that the opener &quot;Poseidon's Creation&quot; is the best and it's all downhill from there. I'll have to disagree there. The second cut, &quot;Incarnation of Logos&quot; is simply stunning. Not too often have I ever heard a song with such out of this world string synths as I have this one! Plus I truly dig the synth solo in the middle. Not to mention the song ends up reminding me a little of Gentle Giant at the end. &quot;Decay of Logos&quot; starts of with some really cool synth work before becoming heavier (in fact it's the heaviest piece on the album). The final piece, &quot;Atlantis' Agony...&quot; is the one people seem to have the most problems with. It starts off with some narration, then with an 8 minute long synth drone. To me I love it! I find it positively mindblowing. If you listen more carefully to the synth drones, you'll find more than just droning, like strange wailingsounds played on an ARP 2600 synthesizer and other cool sounding synths. The other half of this piece shows the rest of the band kicking in, pretty much the same style as the rest of the album. Plus it features a really cool Moog solo. Of course, this being an Eloy album, many of you will have problems with Frank Bornemann's singing, since he's a German having problems with mastering the English language, but he doesn't bother me any. I am rather surprised to find out Ocean had outsold Queen and Genesis in Germany, which seems to be, in an era of punk and disco, that the Germans must have still had good tastes in the late 1970s else bands like Eloy, Novalis, etc. would not have done so well there. So if you want yourself some of the more out of this world spacy prog rock with killer synths and not bothered by Bornemann, you need Ocean!
B00005QG9J|4.0|Over the last year Incubus has exploded with popularity.  I am unaware of how the rest of their origional fan base will agree with me on the rating of the album.  The concept throughout the album has much to do with longing for someone and wanting to dissolve a relationship with someone.  Lyrically, boyd does not fail to perform.  His creativity and vast use of perceptions to describe certain things (take for example; &quot;the sky resembles a backlit canopy, with holes punched in it&quot;).  Musically this album has more of a groove oriented feel.  It is hard to relate all of the songs together in terms of musical style.  Melodic acoustic numbers such as &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;11 am&quot; seem to be the unsettled sentiments built up by the bands.  In contrast &quot;Under my umbrella&quot; has the tone and pace of a song from the album S.C.I.E.N.C.E.  Other upbeat, energetic songs are &quot;Have you ever&quot; and &quot;Blood on the ground&quot;.  Both have a new ring to them.  One could imply that they possess the characteristics of a song from &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, but they really do not.  Perhaps the biggest surprise on the album is that of &quot;Are you In?&quot;.  It really doesn't fit in with any other previous incubus songs.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; has a style that is along the same line.  Both songs are very groove orientated.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; is a primary example of how Enzinger has begun to branch out even more to alternate styles of guitar playing.  Pasallis, the drummer, keeps his unique stile of pizzaz and rythmic dyversity.  For Dirk Lance, this performance is his greatest since Fungus Amongus, in which he shows fans his great talent and diversity.  And as for Kilmore, well, it is a shame that there is no track where he stands in the absolute spotlight.  The man is talented like no other dj in this musical genere, and his abilities could have been shown more on the album.  <BR>    Overall, this album deserves a 4 because of it's excellent diversity, strong lyrics and musicianship, and most of all, the fact that there is no way that this album will flop.  Incubus is showing the pop world that they refuse to be one hit wonders while pleasing their fans from days of old.
B00004U2GH|5.0|I couldn't resist picking this up the other day; by most accounts, it's a great album, regardless of how popular it might have been in its day.<br />Having never heard the original version, I can only shudder how it must have sounded without the between-song banter and gospel outro, which makes this a message album par excellence.  If you enjoyed Elvis's Memories: '68 Comeback Special, you will also enjoy this album, particularly for the spirited renditions of Cash's greatest hits.<br />Alongside of Willie Nelson's &quot;Red Headed Stranger&quot;, this truly is an American milestone in music--disregarding genres--and should be owned by any self-respecting music fan.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I bought Morning View because I already love &quot;Wish you were here&quot; and I love &quot;Make Yourself.&quot; I think the new disc has a similar sound to make yourself, but that's good. there's less hard-rock guitaring, more slow and musical. and always with the odd phrases &quot;the sky resembles a back-lit canopy with holes punched in it,&quot; just like some of the nonsensical lyrics of Make Yourself. Overall, i think this will become one of my favorites.
B000000OPU|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best album ever made. That's all there is to say!
B00005QG9J|4.0|Another great collection of songs from a remarkable band.  Highlights on the CD (imo) would be Just a Phase, Blood on the Ground, Mexico, and Have You Ever... but the whole CD is above average.  Some of the songs dont have the greatest staying value (I regularly skip Nice to know you and Aqueous Transmission) and Boyd's voice just doesn't sound as good on this cd as Make Yourself.  When he sings clean it sounds pretty good (again not as good as make yourself) but when he sings loud/aggresive... it sounds kind of mucky/off (in contrast to the powerful clarity behind Science's screams and yells).  The song writing is intact..  but performance (for the whole band in essence) could have been taken a few steps further.  I miss the drum and bass feel many songs off make yourself... but they decided to move away from that, and thats cool with me.  Again, great cd... could have been a little better but its all good
B00005NWRS|5.0|...(I keep going back and forth on Gold. Good or great? I've decided that it is like Whiskeytown's Faithless Street in the respect that it is an album with great songs and good songs. If Ryan took the great songs, tweaked them, created other songs to flow with with it and put them on another album it would be great. That's what he did with Stranger's Almanac. Note: Gold does not sound like Faithless Streets or Stranger's Almanac, so don't buy it for that reason.)<br />If you've heard Whiskeytown's Pneumonia, then you are already prepared for the direction Ryan Adams is taking with his solo career. Like Pneumonia, Gold is slowly moving away from Adams' alt-country roots and heading for a more pop oriented, singer-songwriter sound. Think early Elton John. Let It Bleed style Rolling Stones. Van Morrison. Cat Stevens. Neil Young sans sonic fury. Dylan, not in his folk phase, or his rock phase, or his country phase, or his christian phase, but Dylan in his late 70's/Rum 80's phase. Sounds like I can't make up my mind? Neither can Adams. It's like he went through his music collection, picked out some of his favorite artists from the 70's and then wrote songs with them in mind. Don't misunderstand me, though. Adams is a great song writer. I would recomend this album to any of my friends who are music enthusiasts. Older fans might not like the pop feel. New fans might not connect with it at first, but give it time. No one ever said finding Gold was easy (sorry about that last line, couldn't stop myself).<br />The linear notes to Gold contain so much name-dropping in the Thank You section, it's almost laughable. Yet, anyone who thanks the Grateful Dead and Black Flag in the same sentence deserves props for their broad musical tastes.<br />I caught Adams live in November 2001 and it was a great show.
0201633612|5.0|... this book can save up to 90% of your efforts.<BR>No matter which tools or languages you use, you will get a profit from patterns.<BR>This book was a discovery for me. This is a way to another world, world of rational design. World where I can not invent a wheel every time. Now I use patterns in C++, Basic, and SQL. <BR>The strength of the book is that it is not narrow-minded, and is not specific to particular programming language or tool. You should have it on your desk as a refference - I have. I vote for five stars for it.
B00005MP58|2.0|My wife and I own the VHS version of this masterpiece and absolutley love it. The story is fantastic and the cinematography wonderful....however, the special edition DVD is horrible. The colors are washed out with dark objects looking like blobs. I'm attempting to return the terrible DVD at this very moment. Stick with the VHS if you have a choice.
B00004WKII|5.0|I don't have a lot to say, except that the recordings are wonderful, the booklet that comes with the set is actually interesting, and (most importantly) the music is good.<BR>This set actually humanized Hendrix in a lot of ways that I haven't seen before. He comes across as a real person, not a &quot;legend.&quot;<BR>This is a great collection.
B00003CXFG|4.0|I liked the graphics and the special effects. There is a mystery, few things are vague in the story, I would rather see some famous stars, but overall the acting is good.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I'm shocked by the change in Christina's voice for the passed year, and I'm a dedicated fan of hers. Her voice has grown and is really amazing. I can't wait for her New CD
B00005QIPH|1.0|With all the recent reviews and hype over these \\"new saviors of rock-n-roll\\"'s album, I was anxiously awaiting its release to the local record stores.  Maybe my interpretation of rock-n-roll is different than others.  Maybe when I hear that this band plays rock-n-roll, I'm thinking the Stones, Ramones, Replacements, Zeppelin, Social D.,etc.  The Strokes have the energy and enthusiasm of a stroke victim.  The only song I can even remember is track seven, which rips off the beginning of \\"American Girl\\".  The whining muffed vocals and the mundane guitar playing blur without distinction from song to song, in a vain attempt to hide the lack of talent.  They must have done so real ...up or sold their soul to the devil to get signed.  If these guys are the future of rock, we are all ....
B00005QG9J|5.0|No doubt incubus will be accused of &quot;selling out&quot; because of this CD by many of the hard-core 'real' incubus fans who have been listening since before S.C.I.E.N.C.E. came out.  And, yes, the lighter sounds and stronger melodies may actually cause this CD to be even more successful than Make Yourself has become in the last few months, but incubus hasn't lost its realness.  Brandon's voice is as strong as ever, the songs are still powerful, the hard sounds from earlier times are still around on a few of the tracks, Kilmore's scratching still sounds perfect... but the this album does represent a lot of growth for the band.  The songs are even more diverse than Make Yourself's were; Morning View shows a transition to new arenas of sound.  <br />Highlights for me are &quot;11AM&quot; (a dark-sounding look at the past), &quot;Echo&quot; (light happy kinda song), &quot;Are You In&quot; (another borderline pop song), and &quot;Aqueous Transmissions&quot; (the greatest departure from mainstream rock on the CD... this one's amazing).  People who like the harder SCIENCE-type songs will favor the first half of the CD (my favorites are mostly at the end).  <br />All in all... whether you've been listening for years or were first a Make Yourself fan or are just thinking about getting the album because of &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; it's a good buy.  A great one, even.  It's rock, it's introspective, it's beautiful.
0790731452|5.0|This movie appeared to have great potential but it seemed to lose momentum as it progressed and it never really got that far off the ground. What is supposed to be funny is really not all that funny and as a result the laughs become forced. Visually it definitely has Tim Burton's twisted vision of a Martian Attack but as a spoof it somehow lacks energy for its inspiration. Danny Elfman composed a very good score giving it a 1950's science fiction feel for that genre. Elfman's score is a comment on just how goofy some of those films look today. This film has a very good cast with its members given varying degrees of importance and screen time. Coming off best are Jack Nicholson, Pam Grier, Jim Brown, Rod Steiger, Tom Jones and Joe Don Baker. This is really not a bad film. I suppose I just expected something greater with such an abundance of talent.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Been a Dylan fan since '63.Love and Theft ranks amongst his best.<BR>&quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot; is worthy of comparison to any cut on Highway<BR>61.&quot;High Water&quot; is comparable to&quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot;,and the man who is often credited with killing Tin Pan Alley brings it back with a vengence with the mellow &quot;Moonlight&quot;.
B000002LRX|5.0|Just been reading your reviews while browsing amazon.com. Then one thing occured to me. These reviews don't mention &quot;Easy&quot;. And it isn't on the tracklisting, whereas it is on my CD. Is it a bonus track on European versions or what? If so, thank god I live here, not in America! But this is a quality album anyway.
0671027573|1.0|I had high hopes for this book.  I had heard so many people rave about it that I just had to give it a try.  I kept on giving it tries all the way to the last page but it never made me feel anything other than disquist.  First of all, the two characters are both potty mouths.  I'm sorry but if the \\"f\\" word is supposed to shown realism, I'll stay in my fantasty world.  The plot was so unbelievably transparent and I never bought any of it.  I like gruff heroes and feisty females, but underneath they have to have honor and substance.  These two did not.
6304595247|5.0|This version of Wuthering Heights is not only the best in cinema, music, casting, costume, but it is also the most accurate and follows the book very closely.  Please put it on DVD...videos are a thing of the past, now!
B00005QXDD|5.0|It is truly amazing at how talented these two are!  A very good album as long as you take it for what it is.  I've been a fan since I first saw them on the HBO show, Mr. Show.<br />The D truly rocks!!
6300214559|5.0|This is one of those movies that change your life, forever.  Helena Bonham Carter pulls off yet another grand perfomance as the innocent and puppet-like true character of Lady Jane Grey, the doomed 9 day Queen of England.  Though the romance side of this movie is fictional, one can see it as what &quot;might have been&quot; if she had not been beheaded.  Quotes from Plato fall into place and fall into your heart.  Fabulous cast, costume, music, scenes from many castles, and a heart-breaking story of the cruelties during Tudor reign, this belongs on DVD soon, please!  If you enjoyed Elizabeth, you will cherish this!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Well, you know the film. I'm going to review the DVD, and it's quite a special DVD as well. For a start, the animation has been polished to within an inch of its life - the colours and so forth are extremely vivid, and although released in 1937 you can't tell from the film quality alone (the music and the 'look' of Snow White and the Evil Queen are very 1930s, however).<BR>As the above list indicates, there are rather a lot of extras. As with Lucasfilm, Disney often get a lot of bad press for being stingy -  this is Disney's equivalent of 'Star Wars: Behind the Magic', in that they've gone to the other extreme and including almost anything possible.<BR>Disc two has a couple of afternoon's worth of stuff, highlights of which include the various trailers dating back to 1937 ('See what the genius of WALT DISNEY has created!') and some galleries of concept art. It's odd looking at galleries of concept art from the 1930s - the animation and storyboarding 'work in progress' frames don't seem dated, and some of the throwaway pre-production illustrations are as gorgeous as anything in the film.<BR>The menus are very nice, but as with a lot of flashy menus (the ones for MGM's 'James Bond' films) they get a bit tiring the second time.<BR>There are deleted sequences, some audio clips, shots of live action test shots, short films on animation presented by Walt himself (looking surprisingly dapper), the works. There's even a short history of the Disney company itself, a piece of fluff which skims over the studio's dimishing artistic fortunes after the death of Walt, and has a blankly-smiling actress sum up the 80s as 'a decade of agressive investment and expansion!' and not, say, 'a decade of 'The Black Cauldron' and 'Tron''.<BR>Disc one has the film, Barbra Streisand (for two minutes), some games, and an intriguing audio commentary by Walt himself, assembled from bits of interviews. It's a bit muddy and hard to hear, but that's definitely his voice talking. I haven't actually listened to it all the way though, but it deserves a nod for the effort involved (unless, of course, it's all faked and Walt isn't really dead at all).<BR>To top it all, it's reasonably-priced. As a landmark in cinema, and as a classic Disney film, I can't think of a reason not to own it.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Damn you George Lucas, damn you for ruining the Star Wars movies.  Some day I will meet you and tell you this.
0780020685|5.0|I cannot do this masterpiece justice with words... you have got to see it. If you are not the type to sit still and watch drawn-out drama, then this might not be for you. Otherwise, simply outstanding.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Celine's Christmas CD is Absolutely Excellent. There are no words to describe the Power in her voice, the grace she has when she sings, and the sound of her massively beautiful voice. If you like christmas songs, Get this CD. It won't dissapoint. <br />Go Celine!
B000024ZYP|5.0|&quot;Fruits&quot;....the english translation of the title of this other masterpiece of Oriental Jazz....where Oriental is pointing not only to some of the oriental &quot;Takht&quot; instruments used here,but goes far beyond, to the melody and arrangements inspired from the deep Levant and Maure's heritage. Once again ECM prooves being the nest of these eagles in the world of true Melody Art. Every time I listen to this album, shivers and chills take over my body, to the point I can smell the magical scent of these  &quot;Fruits&quot;....freshly harvested from some Heaven Tree...
B00004XMV6|4.0|This is a great movie if you are watching it with that special someone in your life.  The love scenes were very tastefully done.  My only complaint is the quality of the DVD is not much better than my VHS copy, so if you want to save the difference in cost I would suggest getting the tape.  Enjoy!
0440219078|5.0|Jonas lives in a &quot;perfect&quot; world where war, disease, and suffering have all been eradicated.  Everything is in order; everything is under control.  The people have no worries or cares.  The Community strives for &quot;sameness,&quot; in which everyone and everything are the same and equal.  To help the Community function as a cohesive unit, each member is assigned a position in society.  When Jonas turns twelve, the Community selects him to be the new &quot;Receiver of Memories.&quot; Only the &quot;Giver&quot; knows the truth and memories of the past, and now he must pass these memories on to Jonas.  <BR> <BR>The Giver is a wonderful book.  Lois Lowry skillfully crafted an intriguing and profoundly thoughtful story.  She subtly creates an uneasy feeling that something is wrong with this &quot;perfect world.&quot;  The Community's advisors intend to establish security within utopian society, but they really establish a stifling dystopia.  To protect people from the risks of making poor or wrong decisions in life, the advisors plan and dictate the lives of the people.  In effect, the citizens have no freedom of choice; they do not choose their job or even their spouse.  Moreover, the advisors inhibit the people's ability to feel because they want to spare them from the hardships and pain of life.  For instance, individuals must take a pill everyday, which suppresses passionate feelings.  The citizens do not know or experience true emotions like love.  One of the goals of the Community is to achieve &quot;sameness&quot; so that no one feels embarrassed or gets excluded for being different.  However, this limits individuality and freedom of expression because everyone conforms to a certain desired image.  Finally, to relieve the population of the horrors and devastation of the world and the past, the advisors isolate the Community from the rest of the world (also known as &quot;Elsewhere) and give the burden of holding the memories of the past to a single member of society: the &quot;Receiver.&quot;  Therefore, the Community lives only in the present, and the people have a narrow perspective of life because they only know their community and way of life.  They are naive; they do not gain knowledge or wisdom from the memories.  While receiving the memories, Jonas learns a different and better way to live and realizes what he and the Community have been missing.  He decides that something must be done to change the current conditions and enlighten his community.<br />Although it is a Newbery Award Winner, The Giver is a controversial book that has been challenged and even banned.  After parents complained that the violent and sexual passages were inappropriate for children, the Bonita Unified School District in California temporarily banned the novel from classes.  The Giver has been challenged in other school districts around the country for its &quot;mature themes&quot; of euthanasia, infanticide, and suicide.    I do not agree with banning and challenging of this novel.  It is a great book, and part of what makes it so great is the incorporation of these controversial issues.  They force readers to wrestle with their own thoughts and figure out their stance on the issues.  Good literature makes readers think.  Banning this book takes away the freedom of speech, the freedom to read, and the freedom to learn and explore.  The banning of The Giver is ironically similar to the actions of the Community that lead the Community to its suppressive and stifling state.  A powerful story, The Giver keeps readers in suspense, touches them, and stays with them for a long time.  I love this book, and I encourage everyone to read it.
B000002IOW|1.0|It' not because you like the guys a lot that you have to applause everything they do. Show don't tell is very cool, but the other songs here are SOOOOO boring!<BR>Open your ears and listen to the good records this good group has recorded instead of the slobbering Presto!
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is personally one of my favorite michael jackson albums. it has some of his best songs on and is great to listen to my personal favorite tracks are In the closet and Why you wanna trip on me. i suggest you skip Blood on the dancefloor and pick up this instead
0930289455|4.0|Batman: The Killing Joke redefined the relationship between the costumed hero and his archenemy, the Joker. Hypothesising that one bad day lead to his criminal madness, the Joker attempts prove his theory by tormenting a sane man into a lunatic in twenty-four hours. He chooses Gothan's Commissioner Gordon for his experiment. As more about the Joker, his origins, the cycle within he and Batman are trapped, why he commits his colorful crimes and his inability to reform, the reader actually begins to feel sorry for the famous villian. Although it is too short to dig very deep, The Killing Joke paints a convincing portrait of the Joker as a person.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|WOW! when i brought this cd i took it home and i listened to it and the first 9 tracks are on the origanal album. but the next tracks are interviews and 3 songs the first one someone in the dark is a melodic balad like childhood. the second is billie jean michaels demo recording with new words and the other is carosel which is also good. i recomend to everyone to buy this CD it is great
0930289528|4.0|England turned into a fascist state ran in several sections by one pollitical party. Loud speakers, blathering false statistics and news to every corner of London. Propaganda trying to control what common people think. A horrifying future where the power of the state means more than the rights of individuals. Yeah, you have heard it all before. Obviously Alan Moore was very inspired by George Orwell's brilliant classic, 1984 when he wrote V for Vendetta. Still, the shaggy genius of comics inserts enough of his own luminous ideas; smooth, cinematic narration and amazing action scenes to make V for Vendetta an intriguing read. The themes of personal responsibility take a larger role in V for Vendetta than they did in 1984 by the way of Evey, a callow teenager from the streets V takes under his caped wing who learns what the laziness and action mean when society tries to keep the common people oppressed. And what about V? Moore and Lloyd's mysterious, theatrical masked anarchist quotes everyone from Shakespeare to the Velvet Underground as he charismatically dashes through the Orwellian world, fooling enemies and dazzling readers. V for Vendetta may be firmly grounded in Orwell's masterpiece but Moore's own creative genius make it a work only one or two notches down from its predecessor.
B00000K2SC|5.0|Best thing about this movie is an idea of story. Some unique camera shots made this movie famous. If you are a SF movie lover, you will probably like this movie. I like the way of story streaming to the end. It is not every moments of thrilling or entertaining movie, but it motivates you to recall the story after the movie at least once.
B00005QG9J|5.0|An excellent CD, and the best one Incubus has ever released. If you don't like Wish You Were Here, the single... well, it's an extraordinary song, but it's one of my least favorites. So if you don't like it, I promise better songs on this album! And if you like it, great. Incubus gets even better than that.<BR>Nice To Know You is a great track to represent Morning View - this is overall the style of the CD. The track is great, and it seems like Brandon is saying 'nice to know you, good-bye' to the styles of Make Yourself and S.C.I.E.N.C.E., because the style of Morning View is very original.<BR>Circles is one of the heavier tracks with an excellent chorus and even more excellent lyrics. You're in for a great ride when you listen to this song.<BR>You've heard Wish You Were Here, I bet.<BR>Just a Phase has the best guitar solo from the album, and is one of the calmer songs. It's great. But, as I mentioned, the best part is definitely the guitar solo in the beginning of the song.<BR>11 AM is another of my favorite songs, third favorite to be exact. It is also one of the calmer songs, but has a complete rock-out chorus. Definitely give this one a listen, you won't regret ir. Brandon's vocals don't fail me.<BR>Blood on the Ground is the third heaviest track on the record, and it resembles Pardon Me, with a loud chorus and nearly rap-like verses. Again, Brandon's vocals are great. Gotta love this song.<BR>Mexico is the only acoustic song on the record, but it's one of my least favorites. The vocals, lyrics, and guitar are all great, but it's a bit boring... I still love it.<BR>Warning is a great song, and should be the second single. The lyrics are great, the vocals are great, etc. Nothing wrong with this track... the melody is awesome, too.<BR>Echo is similar to Stellar, because it is a love song and Mike uses the same guitar-playing procedure as in Stellar: bending the guitar strings. The song is overall great, but the best part is the guitar.<BR>Have You Ever is the second heaviest track, but it's my least favorite song. The best part is the bridge, where Brandon chants, &quot;Have you ever... have you ever tried to?... I have never... I have never tried- TO!&quot; and the song explodes into the chorus. IMO, The lyrics are the secondbest.<BR>Are You In? is Morning's View 'Battlestar Scralatchtica' and/or 'Magic Medicine'. It's not an instrumental, but it has lots of DJ work, and only has two lines of vocals, some 'are you in?'s and some 'oooo's. This is my second favorite track on the CD.<BR>Under My Umbrella is my fourth favorite song and als othe heaviest song on Morning View. Brandond hasn't sung with such strong vocals since the Warmth. The structure of the song is similar to the Warmth, too. Calm verses, and a heavy (REALLY heavy, in UMU's case) chorus. Great song. IMHO, Best lyrics on the CD.<BR>My favorite song is Aqueous Transmission, with a Japanese string instrument and a Japanese flute. Brandon's vocals are soothing - the song overall is EXCELLENT.<BR>All in all, Morning View is a near-perfect CD, and the best one from Incubus that has yet been released.<BR>Thanks, guys, for such a great CD.
B000002MG1|5.0|When I first heard this album, I thought it was really good, but as you listen to it more, you realise that it gets better every time you hear it. The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite is a fantastic song, rekindling the early REM songs like Radio Free Europe and The One I Love. But then to follow this song on the album with Everybody Hurts, which is up there with the very best songs ever written, is incredible.<BR>Every track is fantastic with the possible exception of Star Me Kitten which is just good. The highlights of the album have to be Everybody Hurts and The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite as mentioned<BR>above, but along with these are: <BR>Man on the Moon - I can't stop myself singing along with the &quot;yeh yeh yeh yeh&quot;s after the lines of the verses.<BR>Nightswimming - a wonderful piano piece, which I have learnt to play, combined with Stipe's calming voice.<br />Anyway, they are all good and I will leave you to find out which are the other magnificent highlights of the album.
B00005NW02|5.0|I was very skeptical about buying Toxicity.  I loved SOAD's first alblum a lot, but I know that the second alblum is the hardest to make.  Especially if you run out of ideas.  I've also came across a lot of songs by SOAD on ....... (mostly lives ones), that made me curious about what direction SOAD was taking.  There's a song with SOAD and Puff Daddy or P. Diddy, so it made me very skeptical.  But I had to get Toxicity, the idea kept eating at my brain.  After all SOAD is my favorite band.  After listening to the alblum once it didn't leave me disappointed at all, but rather shocked.  I was happy they included one of their famous songs Multiply or X in Toxicity.  They play it a lot at shows.  Overall there wasn't one bad song on Toxicity.  I loved them all and I love SOAD even more.  My favorite songs would have to be Chop Suey!, Deer Dance, Science, Atwa, Aerials, Forest and Needles.  That's almost all of the songs on Toxicity.  They're all pretty damn good.  I'm glad Daron and Shavo had more of a role in backup vocals.  Anyways enough of me blabbing on and on, if you liked System Of A Down then get this alblum.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002V07|5.0|everything about this album is so (...) endering Hope Sandoval's dreamy voice is like an escape for me, buy this album for (...) sake.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The Phantom Menace storyline was horrible...it's a fact. But I will give Lucas credit for making a really terific DVD! The bonus features, deleted scenes, music videos, are all very cool. It does make the movie a little more enjoyable because the picture and sounds are out of this world. I have a nice setup in my house, and the movie shakes the walls when listened to properly. Movie blows, but it's worth having!
078311513X|4.0|This 1986 cult film is worthy of much greater attention than it originally got. This is one fine suspense, psychological thriller in every sense. C. Thomas Howell stars as a young man on a road trip who picks up a mysterious hitcher on the side of the road(played by Rutger Hauer). Our hero soon learns that this guy is not all there and dumps him off. Big mistake. The nutty hitcher is now stalking this guy while on the road. Along the way, our star meets and hooks up with waitress Jennifer Jason Leigh. Rutger Hauer is a fine actor and he's never been more intense and disturbing as he is here. He really brings the screen to life. The same cannot be said for Howell. He is a bland actor with an ultra bland character. It's hard to really root for the guy when he's nowhere near interesting enough to really care about in the first place. Jennifer Jason Leigh does the best of her transparent role, but she, and the character, was really unneeded. But, I guess you need to have a damsel in distress. The movie is very well filmed and mapped out. It's a great ride that is enjoyable from beginning from end. No matter what a bad review at the bottom of this page says. Ignore that one at all costs. Implausible, really, but good fun.
6305558167|5.0|This film is simply excellent.From the action packed beginning to the somber ending this is a film that will have you on the edge of your seat.<BR>Nicol Williamson is percect as Merlin as is Partick Stewart as Leon-de-grance.Nigel Terry is ok in the role of Arthur,although i found his accent very annoying,although this is a very minor point!<BR>The action sequences are very well done,with extra blood thrown in for all those action fans.<BR>The score by Terry Jones is both haunting and thrilling,and the music alone is worth watching the film for.<BR>In short,an excellent film,if you want the definitive aurtherian movie,this is the one for you!Forget braveheart!Oh please forget braveheart.
B00005OAIE|4.0|The amazon.com reviewer did not do justice to this great young singer songwriter.  John is an amazing guitarist, and the cd does not do him justice at all(hence the four stars).  If he is playing in a town near you go see him now, before he explodes on the music scene.  The first time I saw him over a year ago there were maybe 10 people at the gig, now he is playing to sell out shows in Atlanta and 5,000 in Athens.  Seeing him live is an amazing experience, worth all 10-15 bucks you will pay.<br />John's music is hard to describe, a bit of jazz mixed in with pop lyrics that touch my heart and make me want to find a guy who will tell me he loved me even in &quot;grey sweatpants and [with] no makeup&quot;.  Influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughn, John Coltrane, and Dave Matthews (John recently came out of the closet on this one) John Mayer is an act you don't want to miss.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarves is a classic movie, no doubt about it, but this will soon be known as a classic DVD in its own right. <br />From one of the best re-mastering jobs ever known, the masters at Disney have made this 1937 movie look like it was just made.  Besides crystal clear and bright colors, it also features the addition of 5.1 digital audio, something obviously not even available when the film was first created.  After all the hard work in restoring it, the movie shines and allows the great story to have its full emotional impact. <br />The features, in addition, are done with a phenomenal menu system that's easy enough for anyone to approach. The menus themselves are narrated by a newly computer animated magic mirror that just adds a magic touch. The features are smartly organized and even feature guided tours through them by some celebrity hosts. <br />Overall, this is one of the best DVD's ever and a classic gem for any collection. Don't hesitate to get this one.
B000002LBH|5.0|I bought this album for Asleep (and a couple other tracks), but I realized that the entire CD is worth listening to over and over. I particularly like Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now and Half a Person. The Smiths remind me a bit of New Order, who I am also a big fan of.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I may not have thought this was my favorite Star Wars movie, but it definitely has a lot worth enjoying.  This DVD actually helped me like the movie better and is overall an outstanding DVD that lets you escape to the Star Wars universe for a while.<br />DISC 1<BR>First of all, the movie is presented in beautiful anamorphic widescreen and is crystal clear.  It's a great demo piece for your Home Theater system both in terms of visuals and sound.<br />The menu system is something different than ever seen before because it features 3 completely different menu themes based on the locations of the movie.  You can actually choose which menu you want by pressing 1, 2, or 3 during the first warning screen of the DVD.<br />The commentary track during the movie has great insights and, I felt, was one of the more interesting commentary tracks I've heard.<br />DISC 2<BR>This disc contains the bulk of the many special features.<br />The deleted scenes were great to see, but even better was the fact that so much work and money was actually put in to complete the effects for them.  As if that's not enough, there's a short documentary explaining what went into the deleted scenes and how the creators felt about leaving them out.<br />By far my favorite part of the disc is a professionally made, outstanding documentary entitled &quot;The Beginning&quot;.  It makes you feel as if you were a fly on the wall during some of the most interesting parts of the process to make this movie.  For example, you get to see the scene when Ewan McGregor got to pick his lightsaber for the movie and hear how excited he was about it.  This documentary has humor and characters you care about watching.  It is one of the true gems of this disc set for sure.<br />Disc 2 also contains 5 specially made featurettes, and all 12 of the great web documentaries on the making of the film.  It also has the famous trailers and TV spots, as well as a making of the video game Starfighter.<br />There are also additional Easter Eggs (hidden treasures) found throughout the disc that haven't even all been discovered yet.  One, for example, shows some hidden outtakes from the movie.  To get to it, go to the Options menu on Disc 1, and enter on your remote &quot;11&quot;, then &quot;3&quot;, then &quot;8&quot;.  Depending on your system you may have to press enter after each number.<br />This only begins to get into what's great about this DVD.  Overall, this is one DVD I am glad to own and I give it my highest recommendation.
B000002C25|2.0|I want to start out by stating the fact, I love Oasis. Be Here Now is a major disappointment from this sometimes brilliant band.<BR>Hype is what drove this band into the spotlight. When you have everbodys attention, you HAVE to perform well.What's The Story Morning Glory was released and it seemed anyone with a good trained ear for pure pop music was licking their chops.Then this yawn of an album was released and it seemed to take a lot of the air out of Oasis' balloon. Believe me, it's not a BAD album, it's just .....boring. Nothing jumps out at you making you want more. A lot of these songs sound like leftovers from other albums.I think that if this album actually kicked some butt, and had the catchy tunes like the ones on &quot;Morning Glory&quot; , Oasis would be #1.(not touring and sharing a bill with the Black Crows). I love you guys, you pump out some great tunes, but this is rubbish simply put.
B000002LB6|5.0|The Circus, Erasure's second album, is probably their moodiest work (with the self-titled Erasure taking that honor).  The song explores a much darker side of the human condition than that of the uplifting, happy Wonderland.<br />For being the definitive Erasure fan that I am, you'll be surprised that one of my most favorite Erasure songs is on this album - the title track.  Don't ask me why, but if the song The Circus doesn't stick in your head...<br />As much as I love the Circus, I would not recommend it for anyone who is looking to explore Erasure as a new listener.  The inaugural album for any new fan should be The Innocents - by far the band's best album, and in my opinion, the best piece of music ever produced.<br />I have a wide taste of music (my all time favorite song ever {Alive &amp; Kicking by Simple Minds} is by a band I don't really even like), but the Innocents stands out as the best work ever.  And I just wanted to say that Austin's review (March 2000), citing The Innocents as a inconsistent album, referring people to The Circus as a good primer, should take another listen and realize the genius of the finest Erasure album ever.<br />Get The Circus, but experience The Innocents first.
0767802659|1.0|This movie is full of crap it is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.  The actors in this movie could not act worth crap. this movie had a really stupid ending.  The whole movie was just really dumb, now I am not saying I do not like Sci-fi movies but this movie was just really stupid... If I could rate this movie any lower I could but I can't so One star will do, if I could I would rate this movie with negative stars I would.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I'm reviewing only the DVD, and not the movie itself, which was a bit of a stinker, in my opinion.  Well produced, beautifully filmed, but very poorly written.<br />Anyway - this is an awesome and incredibly well done DVD.  Lots and lots of extras.  Great commentary by Lucas, the producer, the sound man, etc. Interview with the composer.  Lots and lots and LOTS of background materials on the making of the film, and the entire process of putting it together from initial writing to final production, and the making of the DVD itself.<br />The image of the movie is *very* crisp and clean.  The deleted scenes are a nice addition to the movie.  I am very impressed (and surprised, to be cynical about it) that Lucas has given us the full-featured DVD the first time out, and not offered us one scaled down DVD version, only to offer us a better version in a year, and then the full-scale one a year after that, like he's constantly done with the VHS versions of his movies.  Thank you, Lucas, for taking care of your fans this time, and not trying to pad your pockets a few times before giving the fans what they *really* want.<br />Quality-wise, this is absolutely one of the most loaded, best-featured DVDs I have in my collection.<br />(as a p.s. - after hearing Lucas' commentary, and talking about some things coming up in the next movies, I have realized that a few things I criticized about this movie actually make sense oin terms of the upcoming story-line. However, I still think that, overall, the writing for this movie was only a cut above old b-movies)
B00005221M|5.0|A more handsome and exciting man there may never be again.  True to his nature, intensly primal in his eyes and energy pounding through his blood to equal all of history's passion. He is a genuine fighting machine with an intelligence and cunning to lead a nation. A nation that is dying. <br />We could do with a few hundred more like him in our hopes and private dreams.  Maybe we'll find one in a relationship?  Get out of the way or hang on to really live!<br />Stupendous. <br />Dr. Mario T. Scaduto Ph.D.(...)
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a beautifully done album by Incubus. Though some may say that they have sold out I totally disagree.  This album shows their maturity as musicians and composers and well as a daringness for other wordly influences (i.e. Aqueous Transmission).  The love songs on this record are bittersweet and Brandon Boyd's lyrics are beautiful especially on &quot;Echo&quot;.  Though it may not be as hard as their earlier work they still play with the same intensity.  Though songs like &quot;circles&quot;, and &quot;have you ever&quot; still rock with the best of em and unlike most of the these &quot;nu-metal&quot; groups i have a feeling that Incubus will be around for a while and will have something effective to say in the world of music.  Standout tracks include Echo, Are You In, 11am, Warning, and Wish You Were Here but the whole album is well done and there is something for us all on here whether it be a bittersweet love song, an angry intense rocker, or some good ole' laid back grooves.
0553106635|5.0|This series is just incredible.  It is by no means your standard fantasy - the characters are very human, with believable flaws and virtues.  The &quot;good&quot; guys will stun you with some of their actions, and you will cheer for deeds done by &quot;villains&quot;.  It is as full of personality conflicts as it is warfare, and every bit of it is made interesting.  It is a brutal, believable fantasy world that is not overdone with outrageous magics and fearsome beasties.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone, whether they were fantasy readers or not.  It is a book about people and human nature in general, and can be enjoyed by anyone.<br />Now put it in your cart and turn this thing off.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Well, its finally here, after all the waiting, Morning View has arrived. I have listened to the entire cd twice now, and thats about all i can take. The editorial review puts it correctly. Some may call it selling out, but others think they are growing up. Heres my view. They have sold out. A few tracks go back to the old stuff, but most are acoustic, which isnt necessarily bad, many people like it, but certainly isnt what they used to be. I would still recommend this cd, i just do not like it because im not a fan of this genre of music, the acoustic stuff, not the old incubus. Anyways, if you want a great band that will never sell out, i highly recommend Tool. IT WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.
B00005NVDF|5.0|I own every Woody film on either VHS or DVD and I have always leaned towards his earlier works(pre Annie Hall)as my favorites. Play it again sam is without a doubt the funniest movie I have ever seen.
B00005A46T|3.0|I don't know about many of the SlipKnoT fans out there, but IOWA was the kick that they needed to give to get rid of all of the phony 'KnoT fans out there.  This album is what SlipKnoT wanted to do with their first album.  If anyone doesn't like this album, it is probably because they're less than 17 years old and are waiting for the video on MTV.  This is not commercial.  This album is more death, less nu metal.  It is probably the heaviest metal album to be released on a major label, now that they are distributed through Island.  If you wanna talk $h1t about the 'KnoT, you were never their fan anyway.  Although this album takes a little getting used to, I like this album more and more each time I listen to it.  All the people who dislike this album probably never liked metal anyway.  They were never nu metal and never will be.  They are metal, and if you don't like it, go listen to Limp Bizkit and Crazytown.
630468150X|5.0|I love adventure/action movies, and this MORE than delivers!  Surprisingly, this film has some humorous moments.<BR>I have been a fan of Nick Gage for some time now, and this is one of his best.<BR>I think Rachael Ticotin is a very, very fine actress that just isn't seen in enough movies!
B00003CXFG|5.0|This is one of those movies that I can watch again and again, and it's also one of the very few that I've watched all the way through with both commentaries.<BR>PB sits between Alien (with all the suspense) and Aliens (with all the action) including graphics and audio that are second to none.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in good Sci-Fi, action and even horror (though it's unfair to label it purely in that group).<BR>Buy the movie, turn the volume up high, the lights down low and enjoy!  Oh, and see if you can guess who survives...
0743216458|2.0|I bought this in the hopes of reading the book before the HBO series came out, so I would know the real story before it was bastardized on television.  But I found the book account rather thin, more like a broth than a hearty stew. It tells you the basics of Easy Company's forays into Europe, but you get little sense of the cameraderie, the terror, the exhileration of these campaigns.  Instead, you get a fairly factual account of what they did.  I think it's a general knock on all of Ambrose's books; he has the instincts of the PhD historian that he is (&quot;just the facts m'am&quot;) when we're expecting something a little more narrative and gripping.   Someone like Barbara Tuchman is much better at filling in the narration around historical events.   Frankly, the HBO series is much better than the book, which defied my expectations.  There were times when I saw the series and thought that their story filled in the account much more fully than how the book covered it.   Bottom line: a disappointment.
B00003CXRP|3.0|Most of the movie is brillant in showing how Hank's character adapts to his surroundings and goes through his own personal turmoil of loneliness (even when Wilson is no longer enough).  However, the ending is incredibly sappy in just trying to go along with the movie's title.  With the way that Hank's character had developed, it is not believable how the movie ended.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Although I had been a fan of Diana Krall, I had never owned a cd of hers until now. I am not what you can a big jazz fan either. This is a great relaxing cd. I highly recommend it to everyone.
6305807930|5.0|Dario Argento has made some of the most captivating, brilliant horror movies I have ever seen, and I absolutely love and devour horror movies, old and new.  &quot;Inferno&quot; is no exception; it holds your attention from start to finish, and if you weren't fascinated by it, you have to be a pretty dull person.  So the plot is not crystal clear,who cares?  Argento has never specialized in the plot department.  But, contrary to what many people think, Argento's movies DO have substance are not just fanciful exercises in style. Argento, more than any horror director I've ever seen, evokes a sense of the marvelous and otherworldly:his films point away from the commonplace, the ordinary, and push us in the direction of the unknown. Half the people who bash this movie probably couldn't take their eyes off it while it was actually playing.  True, some of the dialogue is ludicrous and the scene at the end with the 'grim reaper' was absurd, but the sheer magic and intrigue of the movie make its flaws unimportant.  Argento is to horror cinema what Lovecraft, Poe or Kafka are to horror literature.  I find it hard to believe that the 'fans' who dismiss this movie because of qualms they have over it 'not making sense' or the incomprehensible nature of the plot were Argento fans to begin with: the premise of the movie is neither more nor less ludicrous than the plots of his other movies.  Argento's work is not meant to be logically coherent or rational, but to penetrate the mystical, shadowy side of existence.  You will never see a more visually stunning or visionary horror movie.  Don't just rent this movie, buy it.
0440211727|5.0|Maybe it's not as polished as later works, but I still felt the most with this one.  I think it should be read first if you haven't already read 'The Firm' or any of the other bestsellers that Grishom seems to write with ease.  The jury scene when the protagonist asks the other members to close their eyes and listen is very powerful and makes the major point of the book.  As for the movie made from this book, it's the one that seems to come closest to what the book was trying to say. If you are only going to read one Grishom, or haven't tried one yet, this is the one.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is one of Incubus' best ablbums even though they are all good.  Circles was my favorite song on here.  they all are good.  If you liked this then you would like S.C.I.E.N.C.E.  If you haven't heared it.  Buy it and love it. NOW!
044022165X|4.0|This offering from Grisham is fun and fast with a good strong protagonist to root for.  Don't read it first or second, the early books really need to be read first to really get the most out of this one (The Runaway Jury too).  How Grishom writes with such ease is one of those mysteries that I wish I could solve.  While this book has its hard looks at serious issues including spousal abuse, family hatreds, insurance scams, ambulance chasers and the rest, it really scores in the humor department, it's just a good fun book.  But really, read at least two or three earlier works first it'll make this one so much better.
1587990717|5.0|Obviously Mr. Talleb is much more than just a mathematician.  His unconventional way of sharing a usually dry financial story, gives us an entirely new way of looking at ourselves and those around us.  I found the book stimulating and eloquent...all readers, no matter how little or how much they already know about randomness, will learn a great deal about themselves and those who make their money.   He dares us to ask questions that most of us never would, about our life and money.  I'll read it again.  I wonder, is he a philosopher, trader or mathematician?  We know he's a great story teller!
B00005MP58|2.0|I was so pleased to learn of the re-release of P&amp;P in a widescreen (Special Edition) version. I once owned the laser disc boxed set, and sold that when the full screen version became available on DVD. I have just watched the latest version on DVD and was so disappointed by its transfer, I was prompted to do a scene-for-scene comparison with the earlier DVD release. Opening titles are OK, but after that, the difference is astonishing. Some scenes have a green cast, otherwise the colours are generally washed out, with loss or degradation of flesh tones. There is also a general loss of detail. The aspect ratio appears to be 1.85, not 2.35, as stated on the cover. I hope the studio will do something about this and recall the product ASAP. Such a shame because this version of P&amp;P was an outstanding production, deserving to be collected and frequently enjoyed.
630575067X|3.0|I thought this was a very good dvd.Jar Jar Binks stinks like nothing I've ever seen in a movie. A complete waste of film space, and completely unnecessary! He nearly RUINED the film. A few scenes could have been incredibly powerful were it not for him swaggering around with his floppy ears filling up half the screen.But I prefer streetbrawls.com There are even people who have taken the time to make Jar Jar hate sites! A total goof ball... agh... I can't go on writing about him.
B00000J2PH|5.0|What a great album this is!  It is one that I can play in the car, in my stereo, at the beach or lake and it fits every occasion.  Carole King is not only a great songwriter but also has that unique voice that is not powerful per say, but is passionate nonetheless...<br />This is a unique record (CD) becasue almost every song on this from &quot;Its too Late&quot;, &quot;You've Got a Friend&quot; to &quot;Natural Woman&quot; is so good that everyone recoginzes it.  These are songs that lift me up when I am feeling down, makes me remember the good times when I was young and are just wonderful to listen to over and over again.<br />Yes, James Taylor did a fanstastic job re-doing &quot;You've Got A Friend&quot; and Aretha Franklin made &quot;Natural Woman&quot; a classic, but some may not know that it is Carole King who is the creator of these songs...and its great to hear her sing them.  I love her piano playing and her &quot;simple&quot; straight forward singing is wonderful as well...<br />Each and every song on here is outstanding and this is highly recommended to those who love great songwriting and &quot;timeless&quot; songs...
B000002KP3|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites - if not THE favorite album in my collection.  I remember seeing a picture of Marc Bolan in the early 80's and thought to myself, man, this guy looks wild - I've got to hear what his music is like.  Thus began my odyssey to get my hands on anything associated with Marc Bolan.<br />This album was the starting point - and it's a true gem. From the opening track, the hypnotic, sultry &quot;Mambo Sun&quot; to bombasitc guitars and violins on the closer &quot;Rip Off&quot;, it's the perfect album - the centerpiece of UK Glam rock in the 70's.<br />Tony Visconti's involvement here brings the album full circle.  The mix of Bolan's poems set to music mingled with Tony's production and orchestral arrangements are captured perfectly in &quot;Cosmic Dancer,&quot; my favorite track on the album.<br />There's not a bad song here.  If you're curious and want to know more about Marc Bolan and his band, T.Rex, look no further than this album.
B00005NWM3|4.0|I bought this CD today expecting the majority of the songs to be like &quot;How You Remind Me&quot;, and for Nickelback to be a lot like Creed. However, after the first song, &quot;Never Again&quot;, I knew I was mistaken. I ended up liking this CD much more than I thought I would. The lyrics are actually pretty angry, the guitars fast and the speed and energy about the same as Creed overall. If you're considering buying this album for songs like &quot;How You Remind Me,&quot; take my advice and don't. It's a much different album than I thought, and probably a lot of people thought. <br />I can't say that I have a favorite song. Actually, I like them all. One of those albums you can listen to straight through. If you like hard rock/alternative, Metallica or Godsmack, this is for you.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I love this set. The movies have never looked or sounded so good. Pacino is the best.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Alright, in the grand scheme of Incubus, this is probably their second best album, in a close tie with Make Yourself.  SCIENCE still reigns as their best.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; is a really cool track, departing from typical style as much as Summer Romance did.  &quot;Just a Phase&quot; also has a different sound and is very good.  &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; are both great.  My main reason to say this is only as good as Make Yourself, but not as good as SCIENCE, is the high amount of correlation that can be drawn between certain tracks on both CDs, like both CDs follow a kind of formual.  This is still a great CD and definately worth buying.
B000007NYS|5.0|Lucinda Williams is an artist whose voice floats across the night sky, most often like a shooting star. You must, I repeat, must, take the time to own everything this amazing woman has ever done. Having seen her in concert in Austin, she continually outdoes most female artists, and I guarantee that you will be hooked. The fact that some people are still having to discover her is proof that,in life, the best of things are often those you work just a little harder to find. Enjoy!

B00005B4GU|5.0|I bought the book version, and it's so lovely. pages and pages of full color art in the traditional radiohead style - it's so worth the extra cash. if you didn't like &quot;the bends&quot;, be happy - this cd is 10x better than the bends (mind you, i love the bends). it's deep and melodic and thoms vocals are haunting. it's one of my favorite cds - packt like sardines in a crushed tin box has this heavy bass that when mixed with thoms deep, rich vocals seems to lull you into a trance. pyramid song will make you cry. pull/pulk revolving doors has heavy repetative undertones that i would only describe as muted machinery. the vocals are warped and i have to say this was on of my favorite tracks when i first got the cd - just the repetition made me think about how dull and scheduled life can be, then at one point in the song the undertones just stop and it's like; when debris is released into space - things go everywhere, weightless and unrestricted. totaly and complely free. then the mechanical beats start up again. the entire cd is great. like spinning plates the vocals are backwards for most of the song. the music has an amazing effct - it creates this intense imagery. the whole cd is incredibly relaxing and dramatic.

B00005QG9J|4.0|I get aggravated with people like your amazon.com reviewer saying things about Incubus' &quot;breakthrough single,&quot; and hearing radio dj's say things like Incubus is a &quot;hot, new band&quot; and hearing people say that they're nu-metal just because they're white and they're not in a boy band.  The fact is that Incubus probably doesn't give a flying rip about breakthrough singles and when they come out, or the strategic timing of the release of their new record.  I was hearing &quot;Drive&quot; on the radio a year and a half ago, but when the video finally comes out, people seem to think that they're a new band all of a sudden.  People need to cut the bull, and start listening to the music.  This album, just like MAKE YOURSELF is a great, beautiful, thoughtful rock record.  Incubus has done another great job.  If you liked either S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Make Yourself, then you'll like this, it's a great blend from a great band who will be around for many years to come.
B00005R87Q|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG LONG TIME, IF YOU <BR>HAVEN'T SEEN IT YET YOU SHOULD.  ITS A MUST ...
B00003CXTG|5.0|This action/romance film is sure to please all with its stunning performances and special effects. Ben Affleck portrays Rafe, a lovesick soldier fighting for the British in World War II . Kate Beckinsale  plays Evelyn, a beautiful nurse who falls in love with Rafe. Danny, played by Josh Harnett, is shy when it comes to girls; however, when he finds his true love that soon changes. These actors wonderfully capture their characters which is really what makes the movie so great and allowed me to identify with them. The special effects are incredible during the scenes when Pearl Harbor is attacked. <BR> Rafe and Danny, life long friends, join the Army Air Corps together. When Rafe falls in love with his nurse Evelyn he volunteers to fight with the British Royal Air Force where he is shot down and thought to be dead. While he is fighting abroad Danny and Evelyn are shipped to Pearl Harbor where they receive the news that Rafe has been killed. Due to this tragedy they become closer and develop a serious relationship. However, once Rafe returns the only thing that can save their friendship is the attack on Pearl Harbor.<BR> This much anticipated film is not only an action film but also a romance. Some consider this film to be a poor display of a war film and that it dishonors those soldiers that died at Pearl Harbor, but what was enjoyable for many is the fact that it wasn't just a war movie. The love story helped more people to identify with the characters and some events that took place.  It has a very well written script that had me both laughing and crying.<BR> This movie is definitely worth seeing; and I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind a little love mixed with war.
6301902645|5.0|If like me you have a passion for things 60's and 70's and 'Bullit' and 'The Thomas Crown Affair' are amongst your favourite films then likely or not one of your heroes is Steve McQueen.<br />Despite the media branding 'Le Mans' as a 'flop' to me it represents the spirit behind the man, his desires, his passion, his frustrations and ultimately and insight into the soul of the real Seve McQueen.<br />True the story line is weak with Steve playing 'Michael Delaney' a loner whos having survived a serious accident the year before which killed his friend and now having to come to terms with confronting his widow is a backdrop in terms of the real thrust of the film which is an action filled semi documentary of the 1970 Le Mans 24 Hour race.<br />The cars are evocative with Porche 917's, my favourite the Lola T70 and many other period cars which raise the blood pressure. The shots of the full speed dash along the Mulsanne Straight are breath taking and with drivers such as Derek Bell providing the stunt driving the experience is in a league of its own.<br />View it having read 'A French Kiss with Death' and your in for a treat!
B00004ZAV3|3.0|I think it's fairly obvious to Beatles fans that, although this compilation features some nice remastering and a chronological walk through some of the Beatles' most appealing material, that Paul's work is overemphasized. This comes at the expense of some obvious dis to John and George's work.<br />Let's take a look here. The early years of 1962-1964 are representd fairly well, with hits such as Love Me Do and I Want to Hold Your Hand. The early singles happened to feature BOTH Paul and John, usually trading off either verse and bridge or harmonizing throughout the song, so this works out nicely. <br />As we know, the middle period of 1964-1967 began to feature songs that were more exclusively Paul or John, and though this retrospective features good work from both men, there could have been more of John's stuff in there, cause this was a very successful time for him (e.g. Drive My Car, Norwegian Wood, etc). <br />However, in the later part of the album, with songs from 1967-1970, we begin to find this album definitely overemphasizes Paul's Beatles repertoire.The songs from this period start at track number 17 (&lt;b&gt;with primary artists name in parens)&lt;/b&gt; :<br />17. Penny Lane - Paul<BR>18. All You Need Is Love - John<BR>19. Hello Goodbye - Paul<BR>20. Lady Madonna - Paul<BR>21. Hey Jude - Paul<BR>22. Get Back - Paul<BR>23. The Ballad of John &amp; Yoko - John<BR>24. Something - George<BR>25. Come Together - John<BR>26. Let It Be - Paul<BR>27. The Long and Winding Road - Paul<br />See what I'm saying. If you're going to put Penny Lane on, you should put the (more important) Strawberry Fields Forever on there too! If you're going to put Hello Goodbye on there, you should put the (more important) I Am the Walrus. These pairs of songs were released as A and B sides on the original singles, and they belong together at this point in time as well. I do think that in response for letting Paul's songs from the later period dominate (especially the fluffy Hello Goodbye and the blah Get Back), they should have put more of John's middle period stuff on there (e.g. Drive My Car, Norweigan Wood, etc).<br />DOn;t get me wrong, I like Paul's stuff - but the overall caliber of the album suffers because of the disproportion. You'll find the Red and BLue compilations better handled in my opinion.
B000002HH2|5.0|This is Bjork's best. Almost every song is wonderful, and each is different. &quot;Hyperballad&quot; has lots of flavor and builds up to a climax when the beat is picked up towards the end. It's a good song that inspires energy and sensitivity at the same time. You can dance to it or relax to it. &quot;It's Oh So Quiet&quot; was cool the first time, reminding me slightly of the Beatles' Honey Pie- not really rock and roll or pop, more of a 1940's era sound. Got bored of that one pretty quickly, though. &quot;Isobel&quot; starts off slow and warm, and gets passionate and louder, with a great orchestral backing, towards the end. Certainly one of Bjork's best songs. &quot;I Miss You&quot; is a great song to jog, dance, or drive to. Has a great electronic beat and the horn riffs are so catchy and quite memorable. &quot;Cover Me&quot; went by me the first few times, now I think it is Bjork's most enchanting song. With the beautiful harp, it reminds me of The Doors' Soft Parade beginning.
B00000DFSK|4.0|U2 has always kept the music rolling in their golden era enterings. This time capsule of hits shows that their music still influences others. From With Or Without You, to Pride, U2 still shows that they rock all over Ireland, and beyond.
B000000W5L|5.0|Just when I thought I was getting bored of Stones and Classic Rock, I listened to this album and heard a lot of great tunes I haven't heard in a while. My faves are Sweet Black Angel, Rocks Off, Let it Loose and Shine a Light.

B00004Z459|5.0|For those of u metal fans who dont have this record go buy it now. This record is a beautiful headtrip in rap\metal mania. Those of u Limp Bizkit fans (I once was) listen to this stuff. U won't be disappointed.... Linkin Park excells in everything Limp Bizkit lacks in: Depth of the music ..., Repetitiveness ... The hybrid theory  has the best, most effective mix of guitars, turntables, and amazing vocals coming from a lead singer, and an MC. They don't call this the hybrid theory for nothing. The album stakes out much new territory in Metal, hip-hop, funk, and punk which is what makes it so great. ... This power-packed compact disk of pure adrenaline should be your standard 4 nu metal. Just buy it you won't be disappointed. Peace!!!!!!!!!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|You bet there are! Plenty of lovely and piercing and funny lines and turns of phrase. Do we have any other artist doing at 60 what Dylan's doing, what he's capable of? Amazing album. It's like this, I really believe: his albums are like the stars of the Milky Way galaxy, all clustered together more or less, some reaching out further than others. But, just as with the planet Pluto, there's one work that is double the distance of the others from center. It is LOVE AND THEFT, folks. The words are carried by ripe vocals that don't miss one heartelt note; the vocals are propelled by a band that delivers music somehow both raw and polished, the icy glaze of a splintering missile through a wind tunnel. Bob would never have been able to produce this career crown without his Christain conversion and subsequent struggles. He has not only become the bluesman he at first imitated so well, but he is now the prophet to his younger mere visionary.
0894803123|3.0|I like the recipes in this book but suggest modifying them if you are concerned about salmonella in raw eggs (worth a thought if you are serving to kids). Most of the recipes do (contrary to another review here) include eggs, but never are the eggs cooked. It's not hard to modify the recipes to cook the eggs -- just make a custard with the eggs, sugar, and cream following the pattern of most other ice cream recipes. But I'm surprised B&amp;J don't even mention this issue.
1558908455|5.0|I don't know why so many people put this movie down.  It's a good<BR>movie.  Sure it doesn't have the best acting but it's still good.  It's blood soaked and good. I own it on DVD.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I'm not giving this five stars because it was a good movie...it wasn't.  I'm sure everyone has thought or hear about how annoying Jar-Jar is (though not as bad the second time I watched it); the pod-racing was way too long and the announcers were too &quot;modern&quot; (sounds like Mel Allen doing the play-by-play); the actors playing Anakin and his mother are wretched (I don't know what was worse, their acting or their dialogue); shameful use of things such as fart and feces jokes; and Darth Maul is *seriously* underdeveloped as a character.  The odd thing is that the five minutes of the final showdown between the Jedi is great filmmaking, the rest is Lucas playing with his &quot;toys&quot;.  What made the original trilogy great is that it was your classic Arthur legend, set in space, and done so in a manner that it worked on several levels.  Kids loved the battles and special effects, adults could enjoy the plot-twists and the progress of the characters.  None of this happens in the Phantom Menance, it's &quot;dumbed down&quot; to the lowest commmon denominator and if it had been truly the first movie in 1977, the series would have died.  The DVD however is what DVD is all about.  One disc has the movie with special features such as commentary and such, the other has mini-documentaries, photo and video galleries, etc.  Nicely done.  What scares me is watching the deleted scenes...because the movie could have been worse.  The pod races could have been even longer than they were, the Jedi and Jar-Jar could have been threatened by falling over a waterfall for no reason when they arrive at the Naboo capital, etc.  Bottom line, DVD:  Five Stars; Movie:  Two Stars at best.
B0000542D2|5.0|&quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; represents the very height of BEATLEMANIA, a wonderful heady time of possibilities yet to be explored and the jubilation of Rock n Roll in general. I saw this at my local movie theater in 1964, after braving a line that ran the length of a very long Brooklyn block (unheard of for this third run theater). And remember this was in the day of the double features. The decible level inside the theater during the show was unbelievable, and the sound from the screen was pretty loud too. Non stop screaming, shouting, and singing that made most of the dialogue incomprehnsible. It wasn't until the film played on television years later that I discovered what a funny film this was. In contrast, when HELP debuted a year later, the second run theater I saw it in was packed, but quiet and attentive. The hysteria of BEATLEMANIA was over, and while it was a relief to be able to hear the movie, the excitement of the pandemonium was sorely missed. But on this day in 1964 my local theater became a real Beatle concert-going experience. The fact that my older sister got hit in the head with some girl's tossed shoe, and that it provoked laughter instead of the expected anger really brought home the fact that this was indeed something special. But its what happened after the film was over that has stayed with me all these years over any other movie going experience. After all this pumped up energy  The Beatles had produced on came the second feature. I don't remember the name of it, but I do remember it was in color and the first shot was a close-up of a lily pad that silently floated on a lake for what seemed like five full minutes. Well that was it. This Brooklyn crowd went nuts &quot;We Want Te Beatles! We Want The BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES! Over and over. Being the most seasoned 9 year old movie goer in film history, this was one thing I knew was never going to happen. I remember thinking how smart the theater owner was to book this film, whatever it was. It was obvious to me that this film wasn't being shown to enhance the pleaure of the previous film, or compliment it. It was designed to empty the whole theater, so that nobody would hang around and see The Beatles again (there was another line stretching down the block waiting to get in). But the audience wouldn't stop. WE WANT THE BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES!I just shook my head.  WE WANT THE BEATLES! WE WANT THE BEATLES!  Then  something  happened. The 2nd feature stopped leaving a blank screen up there, and down came the theater manager and held up his hands. He was fat and sweating profusely. He waved his hands for everybody to be quiet. There was a palpable feeling of anticipation in the place. As the noise subsided he informed us, reluctantly it seemed to me, that they WERE going to show &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; again (an eruption of CHEERS!) and that after it was over he wanted every single one of &quot;you kids&quot; out of this theater. And, in what seemed like an instant, BLANG, that opening chord was struck and back on the screen there it was! And the whole place went WILD all over again. You still couldn't hear halfthe dialogue, but it didn't matter. I remember the poor heavyset matron, who looked like she just ran a marathon, resting on the arm of an aisle seat, looking at us crazy kids singing and screaming, and breaking out in the most good natured I-give-up-smile I have ever witnessed. What a time! True to his word, after the show, the manager was in the boy's bathroom,even the girl's bathroom, throwing out anyone who thought they were going to stick around one more time. And as we piled out into the street, we were the envy of everbody standing on line. &quot;We saw it TWICE&quot; and held up two fingers, which in retrospect was really a sign of victory. That was the day that I realised that in this world, anything IS possible.
B00004T9VY|5.0|A classic album that defined the way Stevens feels about mankind vs. nature. This is my favorite Cat Stevens album. If you enjoy this album - the next closest thing is &quot;Teaser and the Firecat.&quot;<br /> Check out the tracks &quot;Where Do The Children Play&quot;, &quot;Wild World&quot;, &quot;Miles From Nowhere&quot; and &quot;Father And Son.&quot; Father and Son is my absolute favorite and is alone worth the price of the album. <br />Enjoy this album!
B00000JHAU|4.0|Happy-sounding sad songs.  One after another.  Light, bouncy, tuneful, catchy, lovely.  &quot;Seeing Other People&quot; is a standout.  These songs defy interpretation, other than pretty.  I was surprised how much I enjoyed this collection of nice pop, but I probably won't listen to it daily; more likely, I'll just put it on whenever i feel the need for light, bouncy, tuneful, catchy, lovely, happy-sounding sad songs, one after another.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Well I bought the album the day it came out because I am a huge Incubus fan and had been waiting for it awhile. When I first started listening to it the sound and melody didn't grab me like make yourself did the first time. But after awhile the cool mixing of instruments grew on me. So all in all not a bad album my favorite songs would have to be blood on the ground,nice to know you, and warning. But I'm starting to like some of the others as well. This album is not as good as make yourself and almost as good as science but I would recomend it if you are a big Incubus fan.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This being the first Radiohead album I ever heard, and also being the one that, for me, opened the door to all the rest of their albums, I felt at first a little unsure of what exactly was entering my ears. Was it good or evil? Was it highly advanced or minimalistic? Is it incredibly beautiful or disgustingly awful? I still don't really know the answers to these questions and I believe that is the reason this recording is so great. There has been no recording that I have heard before or since that has so thoroughly altered my views of what music can be. <BR>   From the first note (or is that a blip I hear?), the listener is pulled into an often dark world of twisted emotions that are at first completely inexplicable. But as the album grows on you, and it will, you begin to realize that this mess of sound forms a beautiful collage of thought and power. Songs like &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; at first give one the impression that Thom Yorke has recently awoken from a deep sleep and it still not quite sure where he is or what he is doing. But as the song progresses, parralleling the theme of the album, we become more and more engulfed in his rantings and allegorical ramblings, feeling as though we have entered into his very soul. <br />   This feeling of conveyed introspection that permeates the album starts to enter the listeners life in ways that you wouldn't expect a record to do these days. As with many of the all-time greatest recordings, you start to hear pieces of the album in your day to day life- a sure-fire sign that a record has hit its mark. For what other purpose can music have, but to influence the way people look at the world? To convey the artist's feelings only clearly enough to the listener so that they might apply their own experiences to it. Amnesiac manages to do complete this difficult with great ease and grace. It is a recording that will stay almost perpetually in you player, and will only be truly understood after many, many years of exploration. You need this record.
B00005B36H|5.0|This album should be owned by everyone in the world and it should be mandatory that every day everyone in the world has to listen to it.  That's how much I love this album.<br />Tool is often blown off as self-indulgent and pretentious.  If you think so just take a listen...could you write music that is constantly morphing and make it sound good?  Something tells me no.  The only intelligent thing that Fred Durst has ever said is that &quot;there's something wrong with Tool...it's like they know something...&quot;  Without a doubt Mr.Durst.
B00005QG9J|5.0|First things first: I'm not giving this record five stars because I think it's one of the greatest records ever. I am keeping these five stars strictly in the context of Incubus, and I am measuring the album against their other albums, not against every other album recorded. So in that sense, Morning View is worth my five stars, as I feel unabashedly that it is Incubus' strongest record to date.<br />Now, moving on: congratulations to Incubus for finding their footing! With S.C.I.E.N.C.E., it was obvious that they knew exactly what they wanted; they wanted to be heavy and funky, and they did it very well... the music was interesting and the lyrics were cerebral. <br />With Make Yourself however, it seemed like there was a lot of confusion. Especially in the parts where it sounded like Brandon couldn't decide if he wanted to sing or rap. The general feel was that they knew they wanted to be a different kind of band, but they weren't sure how to go about it.<br />Here, though, Incubus has found rock-solid footing and produced what I consider without a doubt to be their finest work. There's no more shaky lyrical deliver (and Brandon's voice has never sounded so confidently good), there's plenty of introspection and beauty, but they make it clear to anyone with doubts that, yes, they can still throw down the heavy stuff when the time is right. I have a great respect for Incubus because they can be very chilled and mellow, but do so with a tremendous amount of passion and energy.<br />This is one of those rare records where a band is caught truly at the top of their game, when the moment, the feel, and the timing are all aligned perfectly. There are some who will probably quickly throw around the term 'sell out,' but I think anyone who can't see the beauty in this record is someone who's just reluctant to change and maturity.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I've only spun this disc twice, but I'm going to give Incubus benefit of the doubt. Okay &quot;Wish you were here&quot; sounds like a filler song, and that's what I thought the rest of the album was going to provide. B side material. After two listens I can say that this is a lot more laid back than 'Make yourself' which I thought was a pretty solid album. 'Morning View' does have some rocking moments. &quot;Nice to Know you&quot; the opening track, catches your ear, with the familar sound of Incubus' last effort. &quot;Blood on the ground&quot; another cool track. Then somewhere toward the middle or closer to the end the tracks get real mellow. So I'm being generous with four stars, but I have a feeling that this one is going to grow on me.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I think it is fair to say that this album will tick A LOT of Incubus fans off. And I actually think that's a good thing. If you cannot appreciate this album, you are not truly a lover of music. In comparison to their other releases it is not at all &quot;easy to digest.&quot; The songs do have some pop appeal, but they veer away from it more than what would be expected from a platinum selling heavy rock band.<br />What makes the album so good is that it is a departure from their last album. If you actually take a listen to Incubus' discography, you will notice that they evolve musically with every release. As an artist, as a musician, as a human being you must evolve, adapt, and learn in order to mature. What Incubus has done here is evolved musically, and stayed true to themselves. Some may dismiss this album as a poppy album with many more slower songs made mainly to please new audiences. This is not so. Incubus did not by any way sell out by making this album. Selling out means not being true to yourself and your beliefs. Incubus has stayed true.  <br />Instead of making an artificial album to appease fans, they have crafted a more complex album with more complicated arrangements. When the songs are heavy, they're very heavy. When the songs are mellow, they're really mellow. There are very few songs that walk the median. As the listener, it may not be as enjoyable as other Incubus endeavors, but it is one to be respected. There are very few true musicians in this genre who actually care about the crafting of a song. Incubus is perhaps the most innovative mainstream heavy band there is (with the exception of maybe Finger Eleven which has yet to break into the American mainstream). They will be remembered in the context of music history as the &quot;Nirvana of the nu-metal area.&quot; Well done, Incubus.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is awesome! Especially &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot;.
B00005RRG9|5.0|This is, I guess, the original Disney Parent Trap, with Hayley Mills -- Buena Vista has just announced (I'm writing this in (date)) that the original film will be released next year.<BR>The remake was good in its own way, but nothing succeeds like the original.<BR>Now we'll just have to wait for the other Disney/Hayley Mills classic, Pollyanna. <BR>These films were our favourites for showing our children when they were young. Now they watch 'Withnail and I' with us, or The Matrix or Starship Troopers. But those old 'family' movies are still so great; long may we be able to keep enjoying them!
B00003CXMG|4.0|I put this in my DVD-player with some hesitation.  I was born in the 70s, and I love the music, but the lifestyles and the culture of the time doesn't hold a lot of allure for me.  I had heard good things about this movie, though, so I checked it out, and I'm glad I did.<br />The characters were pretty much all likeable.  I loved Russell, even though he could be a jerk.  I adored William, even though he was naive (maybe because he was naive).  And I absolutely adored Penny Lane.<br />Kate Hudson's performance in this movie was touching and endearing.  She captured the magnetism and wisdom and vulnerability that was required for this role.  Yes, wisdom, because Penny Lane was very wise about the lifestyle they were leading...she just wasn't wise about her own heart.  I wasn't too impressed with Jason Lee's performance, but it may just be the role he was given.  Billy Crudup did a fantastic job, and Patrick Fugit shone in his role.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman was also great as William's mentor, Lester Bangs.<br />The climax and resolution were certainly unexpected, but I thought it was an appropriate way to end this story.<br />This movie also provides a great quote; towards the end of the movie, Lester is talking about being uncool, and he says, &quot;The only true currency in this bankrupt world is what you share with someone else when you're uncool.&quot;<br />All in all I give this movie a hearty recommendation.
0805062971|5.0|I have to admit that my main motivation for reading this book was seeing and loving the film. I have heard from a lot of people that although they don't normally read books they got into this one. I'm the opposite, a self confessed book worm with specific tastes and this did more than satisty them. Chuck's writing is stylish and captivating. I have since read all this released books and love them, although choke was a little disappointing it was still a great book. I would highly recommend and actively encourage anyone to read this book. A wonderful work of modern fiction.
B000005IU1|4.0|Never mind the bollix, that's the musical philosophy here. Most of the songs are really good and has interesting guitar playing with fuzz tone. THe 10 minute song is out of place and not enjoyable. my favourites are 1969 and be your dog and no fun.<BR>influential group.
0425173755|5.0|If you are a mystery reader, this is a classic must-read.  The ending is strong, and unexpected.  The characters are well developed. The pace of the book is never slow.  The book is very interesting, and with every chapter's end you want to go on. It really makes you think and guess a lot, and the ending is very surprising.  This is a MUST for detective story lovers.
B000002GW5|5.0|It was 8:00 AM on Palm Sunday, 1979.  The opening strains of The Load Out playing on the radio wakened me from a sound sleep.  I had never heard Jackson Browne before.  That song brought me back from the brink.  It led me to Jackson Browne's other works, and that saved my life.  For me, this album will always be JB's masterpiece.
0385501560|4.0|I highly recommend this book as an individual work very distinct to Chuck Plahniuk's style, and an overall enjoyable experience.  I laughed aloud repeatedly while reading this book and I spent a lot of time thinking about it when I was finished.  This will probably be a movie some day so I suggest you read it before it does, that way you can brag to everybody about how you read it before it was popular.
6305165912|5.0|This movie has a real cult following. If you are are familiar with Cohen brothers movies, you won't be dissapointed.   The brothers throw the main characters a zany and completely unlikely situation to deal with, and the movie is about the interplay between them.  The acting is excellent:  Jeff Bridges is the perfect over-the-hill hipster.  John Goodman is the perfect flashback-ridden vietnam vet. Steve Buscemi is the perfect aging spaced-out beachboy surfer.  Just when you think things are crazy, the movie pushes even further into hyperbole, a-la Fargo.  Definitely worth having around to watch many times.
B000001EXR|4.0|Yeah, this is the heaviest KISS album they ever recorded, and let me tell you: IT'S GREAT!!!. It's very clear that KISS has always been influenced by the top ten music according to the moment they are releasing their records (Hey!!! it's not a sin!!!) and this is no exception.<br />When I bought this CD I thought I made a mistake or the CD was on a wrong package, but no, the first song is from Simmons's voice and then you recognize the rest of the band.<br />This CD has Kulick's signature all over the place. It even looks like KISS were supporting Kulick to record his solo album.<br />\\"Hate\\" it's a pretty good song to start out this CD,\\"Master and Slave\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", \\"Seduction of the innocent\\" and \\"I Confess\\" are great songs that they release on this album. Simmons is at his best writing songs, I hope he keeps it this way.<br />It might have been difficult to Gene and Paul to record this album and then go back in time and put the paint back on. That's why I understand they didn't want to release this one.<br />If you can imagine a color for music, put BLACK (very black) on this one and buy it. You won't regret it.<br />Highpoint: Seduced of the innocent<br />Lowpoint: I'm not sure, but maybe \\"It never goes away'\\"
0446677450|5.0|This book is a great first lesson in along the path of thinking and living financially independant.  To some Kiyosaki's points may seem somewhat basic but most often a reexamination of these basics reveals things that you always knew you should have been doing but just never had time.  Its a great first step in gaining the focus and balance required to make set a long term executatable financial plan.  I'd recommend some just like this as a first step in the right direction.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Francis Ford Coppola's &quot;Godfather&quot; films continue to be treated with the respect due the dons of American gangster movies, with Paramount going all out on a state-of-the-art five-disc set that marks the trilogy's debut on DVD. Whatever ambivalence the studio has exhibited over the years toward Coppola's three films has clearly faded. The box set is beautifully presented, with care and class evident at every turn. The creative decisions reportedly were made almost exclusively by Coppola and his Zoetrope Prods. Coppola's love -- and obsession -- are evident throughout. &quot;The Godfather DVD Collection&quot; clocks in at a massive 745 minutes. Coppola provides new director's commentary on all three films, adding to the already significant body of knowledge and lore attached to them. His comments are focused and instructive, with pauses that let the films' content amplify his points. Coppola's commentary strips away a good bit of the first film's mystique. Shot on a tight budget, the production was &quot;pretty flimsy,&quot; he says. Doubles are used extensively to speed shooting. Extras blunder their way into shots. A key actor can't handle his lines while facing the great Brando. Even the great wedding scene was rushed and fudged. Slight of hand is everywhere. It was all &quot;very sloppy,&quot; Coppola admits. The set's extra features run from the sublime -- Marlon Brando's screen test; an alternative opening to &quot;Godfather III&quot; -- to the absurd -- Coppola actually spends screen time detailing the quality of the grommets that bind his shooting notes together. Cinematographer Gordon Willis' yellows and tannic browns of &quot;The Godfather&quot; are rendered beautifully, while the coal-mine blacks of &quot;Godfather II&quot; provide a dramatic contrast to its subdued flesh tones. Both films have minor speckling throughout, due to age and the limitations of 1970s film stock. The more contemporary &quot;Godfather III&quot; (1990) is pristine, however. All three films offer a bit more picture information than previous video releases, including the ambitious laser set of 1997. Detail is greatly enhanced despite the heavy shadows and high contrast. Taken as a whole, these sure-handed transfers deliver a highly artistic presentation..

B00005QIPH|2.0|I don't believe much in this album. I find it overrated - but time might prove me wrong. I was expecting more energy, but I found the tunes flat and unimaginative. I was quickly bored with it. Nothing special to my mind, give me Ramones or some GOOD NY punk-rock anyday !!<BR>disappointing...<BR>The first tune has got a great bass line though, very catchy, and I give it a second star for that mainly - oh and also cause the guys have got wicked names and cool faces !!

B000002VEP|5.0|Even though this was a &quot;short&quot; album, I gave it 5 stars just for the producton alone. A lot of the reviews I read didn't like &quot;Standing on Higher Ground&quot;. That's one of my fravorite AAP songs. It got consideable airplay here in the Washington,DC area when it was originally realeased. I highly recommend this CD.
B00003CXAA|5.0|First of all, let me state that parts I and II are among the best american films of all time, and as flawed as part III might have been I do not agree with a lot of reviewers that say that it should not be included. I mean this is the Godfather 'collection' and as a person of sound mind one can not expect Coppola to spend another X million dollars so he can release the set with just the two movies. But enough about that, and I will go into the product itself. First of all, congratulations, the picture and sound are excellent on all 3 films, now we can truly savor Nino Rota's music and Gordon Willis' cinematography without all that artificial lighting in the TV and other versions. Great job all in all, now with the shortcomings. First of all, the extended documentary in the extra features DVD was edited by Zeotrope a company owned by Coppola and as interesting as the documentary is it neatly evades important topics. Before I go into those topics, about the documentary itself: it is interesting, but it could have been gripping, it drags in parts and is it just me or does it take too long to make its point about Coppola's insistance on Pacino playing Michael, it takes its time with Coppola explaining his casting decissions in part I but what about the other two? I'd of loved to know how he got Lee Strasberg.<BR>Now with the topics that should have not been evaded:<BR>a) I've always wanted to know this, why o why did Coppola cast his daughter to play Michael's daughter in part III. Did you know that that role was to go to Winona Ryder but after she got sick it went to Sofia? You didnt? well that was for Coppola to explain, and what did he think of later criticism on that point?<BR>b) I would have liked to see the actors responses to each Oscar ceremony, the 3-supporting-nominees of 1972 I think is very interesting. <BR>c) Where's Brando????? I can understand if you could simply NOT interview him, but put together everything you have of his and let us see him, I find himthe best actor of his generation and extremely interesting. I'd give anything to know why he decided to return his Oscar that way or what he thought of Deniro's interpretarion of the young Don. And on a not so smaller note, in that case, where's De Niro?, he shows up but one cant get enough of him.<BR>d) I would have liked to know many of the 'little things' like why Clemenza 'dissapears' in the second part and why Tom Hagen similarly vanishes in the third, why Cuba in part II and the Vatican in part III, and so on. It wouldnt have taken too much time. <BR>e) I know this might seem childish but I would like to hear from everyone involved which film they liked best and why, also what they thought about working with the other actors and their performances.<BR>And many more... but on with other things, I would like to have seen at least 2 trailers on each film and some kind of interviews or something with people 'outside the family' like critics and such, I would have loved to know what Scorsese thought of them and even better... I got carried away, sorry. The deleted scenes are phenomenal, EXCELLENT, only, what's with the deleted scenes from part III, in the 'directors cut' there were supposed to be 9 extra minutes... My mind went blank all of a sudden but still, this is a great Collection well worth it, buy it if youre a real fan and not a scheptic. A 9/10 as a DVD collection with all the features, as for the movies, part I 10/10, part II 10/10, part III 9/10. EXCELLENT films, WOW, own them today.
B00005QIPH|1.0|PULEASE! stop this absurd PR campaign. I bought this CD based on the hype you see here and elswhere (RS). I should have known better when I read the comparisons to the Velvet Underground (they sucked too).
B000002G87|5.0|A masterpiece. This is the album the Allman Brothers wish they could have made.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this is one of the best cd's i've listened to all year. got everything one comes to expect from a great album. major butt kickin here!!! cheers fellas!
B00005QIPH|5.0|The VU/TV virus that never seems to die out in NYC has apparently surfaced once again and infected The Strokes, causing them to produce some exciting new/old music. Having been around for the first appearances of the Velvet Underground and Television and all of their direct offspring, I could just say, oh yeah, the Strokes are very derivative, heard it all before, done better, blah blah blah.....but....this CD has been in almost constant play in my car for a week now, and everytime I hear it, I like it even more. Yes, the influences are proudly flaunted, their lead singer does sound like a rookie Lou Reed (sounds good to me)and they have produced a damn fine album that creates excitement all its own. The only weak song is the one they used to replace New York Cops. The vocals could have been brought up a little more in the mix...I suspect they're going to have more than one entry in the next &quot;misheard lyrics&quot; book to be published. Maybe it's not perfect, but it's far, far better than any other alt rock album I've heard in a long time, and I'm looking forward to their next effort. Highly recommended!
B00000AFWW|5.0|Great Album.  4.5 stars, actually, but i bumped it up because im a hole fan.  <BR>1.  celebrity skin - a great opening track.  classic 3 chord riff, but insanely catchy.  courtney talks about her infamous (in my mind) makeover to glam goddess, and proclaims she still &quot;a walking study in demonology&quot;.  and she is<BR>2.  awful - a misleadingly poppy song about courtney's fave thing - herself.  she sings about the music industry's determination to &quot;royalty rate all the girls like you&quot;.  and says &quot;i was punk, now im just stupid im so awful&quot;  commenting again on her makeover with with and savvy most could never handle<BR>3.  hit so hard - a sexy song about crushes, physical and emotional abuse.  my least favorite track, actually.<BR>4.  malibu - amazing song.  especially to drive to.  clearly about her late husband kurt cobain, and a brilliant mixture of sadness &quot;and i knew love would tear you apart&quot; and coming to grips with her loss.  <BR>5.  reasons to be beautiful - the song probably most about kurt.  angry, harrowing song basically asking why be beautiful when the person you love is dead?  includes an angry, bitter response to kurt's final line in his suicide note &quot;it's better to rise than fade away&quot;.  one of the harder songs<BR>6.  dying - yet another kurt song.  this is a quiet, soft song to stare at candles in the dark.  but underneath this song is anger, just kept quiet as she sings &quot;remember, you promised me&quot;<BR>7.  use once and destroy - a song about drug addiction, and having to drag yourself out of it.  not one of my favorites<BR>8.  northern star - my favorite on the album, a beautiful, angry acoustic.  courtney once said the song was about her ex boyfriend edward norton trying to save her from nightmares of kurt's ghost.  and you can see that in this haunting song.  she sings bitterly of her lost love, then bursts out with her famous screaming growl at the end.  amazing.<BR>9.  boys on the radio - another sarcastic song about the music industry, but also a beautiful pop ballad<BR>10.  heaven tonight - also not my favorite.  just too poppy, without any substance<BR>11.  playing your song - a complete angry fight with kurt cobain.  sneering at his so-called fans and friends who deserted him, she screams out at his hypocrisy and her sorrow in losing him.<BR>12.  petals - a really pretty song, but reminds me too much of the smashing pumpkins<br />all in all, a really great album.  although its much much more poppy, this is less hole selling out and more hole growing up.  i mean, courtney's gonna be 40.  she needs to grow up a little, or her schtick will get old.  hopefully the next album will be more like Live through this
B000005S5N|5.0|I finally got this album and boy am I glad. The titled song, \\"Scoundrel Days\\" left me breathless when I first heard it. The entire album is a hit and has passion and feelings that run through it. Morten Harket is just fantastic. No one has the voice and passion that this man has to offer. Its a must have for all A-HA and new-wave fans. It is A-HA's most passionate album to date.
B00000IQC8|5.0|This is STILL the best Kevin Smith project to date, and easily one of the best presentations of the \\"underclass as totally hip\\" plot that was also used with great success in the film adaptation of Nick Hornby's \\"High Fidelity\\" (also a 5-star recommendation, in case you're curious).<br />><br />There isn't much of a plot to give away, really...young man with dead-end job juggles romantic crises, wiseassed friends, and ball hockey commitments around a (slightly les than typical) day behind the counter at his place of employment, a convenience store in New Jersey. If you are easily offended, you probably won't make it through the first 15-20 minutes of this movie... it's one of my favorite flicks of all time, but it definitely has its off-color moments.<br />><br />The DVD presentation itself I'm less than satisfied with, though...the commentary is obviously dated (I lost track of how many \\"we're in the process of making 'Mallrats'\\" references there were...and that let-down of a follow-up was three movies ago) and could have been re-done for the sake of this \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD release. At the time I bought this DVD, it was priced far more extravagantly than it is now, but I credit Kevin Smith for creating a movie that's so fantastic that it was able to set and maintain its own mark. If you have a DVD player and a VHS player, you may no longer find youself contemplating the VHS version simply for the sake of saving a few dollars.  All the same, the DVD transfer isn't really that much better (unless you just can't live without the 1.85:1 ratio and dig the extra features) than what I remember the VHS presentation to be...but I definitely recommend this movie to be purchased and watched as often as possible, regardless of the format chosen...it really is that good.
0140177396|4.0|John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, set in California in the 1930's, involves two main characters, Lennie and George, who work together to achieve their dream of owning their own farm.  Lennie, mentally handicapped, loves to touch soft thing, which plays a major role in the novel.  At one time, George, Lennie's partner, used to force Lennie to inflict harm on himself for George's own amusement until one day when George told Lennie to jump into a river, where Lennie almost drowned.  George and Lennie begin working on a new ranch because they had to flee the former ranch t because of Lennie's actions.  On the new ranch, the duo meet Candy, an older man who feels that his services are of minimal use at the ranch.  One day, Candy overhears George and Lennie talking about their idea for a farm.  Candy says that he will give him their life savings if he can go with them, and they figure that if they work one more month on the ranch, with Candy's money, they will be able to buy their own place.<br />The book uses numerous symbols to portray its messages.  The farm that George describes to Lennie, where they will grow their own food and tend their own livestock, is one of the most powerful symbols in the book.  It is so powerful because it makes the reader want to believe that the characters can accomplish their dream.  To each of the characters the farm represents the possibility of freedom, independence, and protection from the world.<br />Of Mice and Men is also on the Banned Book List because the book contains uses of profanity, and because of George's mistreatment of Lennie.  By banning or challenging the book, people try to limit access to the book because they find the book unfit for a certain group to read.  This book does contain profanity, but it is done so in a manner that makes the book seem realistic of the times.  The book does a wonderful job of portraying the hardships and dreams during the Great Depression in California.  When people try to limit access to abook of this caliber, they take away from another individual's enlightenment.
B00000FC5H|5.0|Cop this one for a complete musical history and future.  Nobody's done it like EW&amp;F and nobody will....you can bump this in your ride, your bedroom or office (or all at once if that's how you get down!)<br />Can't miss on this one, y'all!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Dark, suspense, at times humourous, a fantastic movie.  The opening scene has Leonard (Guy Pearce) shooting a guy... in reverse (blood flowing back into the body, bullet &amp; shell, back into the gun) to give you an idea of what's to come.  This is a fast paced, edge-of-your-seat (sorry for the cliche) movie that uncovers why Leonard killed Teddy.  Joe Pantoliano (Teddy) gives an outstanding performance and deserves a nod for best supporting.<br />Be warned though, if you like your movies tied up in a nice package with a pretty little bow... well you'll still like the movie but you won't be thrilled with the ending.  It leaves questions unanswered.  You *WILL* talk about this movie after you watch it... and you will watch it again.<br />Destined to be a classic and definitely on my list of movies to own.  I've actually own the DVD (haven't had a chance to watch it) though I was disappointed that they don't give you the option to watch the movie in chronological order.  That would have been a cool addition.
B000002LR3|5.0|What an album!  I was only an early teenager during the whole Stone Roses/Madchester thing, and discovered this album 10 years too late.  That being said, it's entirely fresh, chock full of dance-y anthems such as 'Slip inside this house' and 'Loaded'.  Definitely a mood setter for parties and quiet interludes.  If you don't own it, you're missing out on a solid record.
B00000IPAX|1.0|That's right, SAT time (analogies).<BR>Blink 182 is basically the Punk equivalent to what an 80's hair band was to Heavy Metal.  Weak, smirking, wussie music.  This is bubble gum pop.  Not much more complex or relevant than Britney Spears or Backstreet Boys.  If you think this is punk...you need a musical education.  Why not try: The Ramones, The Clash, Black Flag, Dead Kennedy's, Husker Du, The Stooges, (pre 1999) Bad Religion...and even Offspring and Greenday are more punk than Blink.  Blink have started a wave of nu-punk that is really weak.  Don't compromise taste.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This Cd is not only better than Morning View but it is possibly as good or better than Stainds masterpiece &quot;Break the Cycle&quot;.  It has slow and fast moments.  It has heart and hurt.  It has everything!!!  If you liked Make Yourself you will love this.  If you one of the people who thinks that Incubus has sold out then dont buy this album because they have grown up even more!
B00004Z459|5.0|ok i'll keep it brief. this band has a really good singer, but they need to lose the guy who raps. if they do that, they'll be great! did i mention how much i hate limp biskit?
B000002IWH|4.0|Let's see, the original graphic novel is one of my favorite books of all time, and the movie is one of my favorite movies...I guess it sort of makes sense that I would like this CD.<br />Actually, not all of it is that unquestionably good - Trent Reznor's rendition of \\"Dead Souls\\" is inferior to the original, if only because Reznor is emphatically _not_ Ian Curtis. Pantera doesn't have much of a place here either. But for the most part, it's comprised of bands that James O'Barr (the dude behind the graphic novel) listened to when he wrote said novel, who made original material for this movie (unless they were dead by this time, like Curtis).<br />This album is worth getting for one track, however. Usually that's not a good sign, but this album is the exception that proves the rule. That track is \\"Burn,\\" by The Cure. It's easily the best thing they ever recorded. Surpasses even the material on Disintegration and Wish with its amazing intensity. It's kind of an atypical song for them - they don't usually do this \\"pounding bassline\\" thing, but here they did, and it works.<br />Sure, there are other high points. \\"Color Me Once\\" is a truly great song (some vicious lyrics there, Gano old buddy!), and \\"Big Empty,\\" while I'm no big fan of the Stone Temple Pilots, is a good number as well. Overall, even the weak points here are more creative than most alt-rock - and, of course, they fit the mood of the movie very well. (\\"Golgotha Tenement Blues\\" might not be a great song, for instance, but it fits the dirty mood of the, um, Golgotha Tenements perfectly.) All in all, it's an extremely worthwhile listen, and I'd recommend getting the CD if you're a fan of the Crow, the Cure, Violent Femmes, Brandon Lee, good alternative rock, or any/all of the above.
B000002H4Q|5.0|The first time I heard this cd, I was in awe of how totally amazing it was.  About 30 bajillion listens later, I still do the same thing.  It's got something for everybody.  It's got pitch black, Pornography-esque material as well as some amazing<BR>giddy pop dance songs.  But from beginning to end, it remains musically hypnotic and lyrically ingenius, as always.  The highest points (although there are no low points): &quot;Torture&quot;, &quot;How Beautiful You Are&quot;, &quot;If Only Tonight We Could Sleep&quot;, &quot;Why Can't I Be You?&quot;, &quot;The Kiss&quot;, &quot;Hot Hot Hot!!!&quot;, &quot;Catch&quot;, &quot;Just Like Heaven&quot;, &quot;All I Want&quot;...did I miss any tracks?<br />Anyway, find some money on some credit card and order this cd pronto.  You'll thank me later.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is amazing.  Incubus has matured so much through the years, and the sound on this album is as unique as the sound they have provided on their previous albums.  Even though it is a lot more mellow, I find 'Morning View' to be the best of anything they released.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Cheers Spike from San Fran. You nailed it on the head- yes this IS a really catchy, solid album...absolutely. But it's not groundbreaking by anymeans and This Is It is far from the new Nevermind or Daydream Nation. Plenty of bands have been doing this sound for a long time, minus the image and attitude that really is as much a part of record sales as the tunes. And that is what, unfortunately helps spin the world that frothing NME journalists live in. God bless, the Strokes themselves have shyed away from all the attention and media gushing- they're just having fun playing some rock n roll! Let's just hope there's not a massive backlash of 'you're so cool, you're not cool anymore' that we started to witness with At The Drive In, who, like the Strokes were heralded as America's saviours of Rock n Roll. The best advice? Take this album for what it is...a well executed, lighthearted fun romp of heavily derivative proto punk. Do yourself a favour and buy a Stooges record at the same time and then ask yourself if it's groundbreaking. And check Garageland out while your at it.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Great Movie.  Total action with tons of fast cars.  A must see for every fan of the import car scene!
0140157352|4.0|It is an excellent book especially if you look for an introduction into the negotiation field. It provides good, real examples. Through this it is easy for the reader to capture the essential statements. One minus is that many examples are not up-to-date dating back to the 60ies and 70ies
B000002B7S|3.0|Ozzy is kind of a paradox in heavy metal music.  His image, his reputation, and the mystique surrounding him have always been undeniably in line with many of the more macabre metal stars of the 70's and 80's (Dio, Maiden, Priest, Alice Cooper), but his music itself has always had more pop content than anyone would probably like to admit.  Even some of his more well-regarded songs like \\"Flying High Again\\", \\"Goodbye to Romance\\" and \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\" seem to have been designed for Top 40 status (and in the case of \\"Mama\\", actually was his first and only Top 40 solo hit).  \\"Bark At The Moon\\" and it's successor \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" both mined Ozzy's poppier side more blatantly than ever before or since.  In the case of BATM, the result is a good conventional hard rock album in the same vein as 80's-era Aerosmith or Kiss, but way too awash in synths and pop metal hooks to really garner him any real respect.  This is probably due to the fact that guitarist Jake E. Lee was not as proficient or unique in his style as either his predecessor (Rhandy Rhoads) or successor (Zaak Wylde) and thus they had to step up the keyboards to give the songs some character.  The title track is the obvious centerpiece, and songs like \\"You're No Different\\" , \\"Now You See It (Now You Don't)\\", and \\"Centre of Eternity\\" all contain enough of that trademark ominous sound to merit respectability, despite the omnipresent keyboards.  However, the ballad \\"So Tired\\" and the flat-out pop metal \\"Slow Down\\" surely drove away the Ozzman's fans like lemmings running toward the edge of the cliff.  A good album for completists and fans of the song \\"Bark At The Moon\\", but hardly an essential Ozzy album.  For that, turn to  &quot;Blizzard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot;, and &quot;No More Tears&quot;.
B0000024W3|5.0|i'm a big dylan fan, but i have never read much about him or his work, so i didn't know the critics didn't like it. I got to know this album about at the middle of my &quot;dylan phase&quot;. i just left it on the turntable for weeks and let it play in the background. It took a long time for me to get a handle on the songs. &quot;Hey that song doesn't have any words,&quot; i realized after a week or so. And &quot;How strange, that song is an instruction manual for a bootlegger!&quot;. And the ballad about the damsel of Belle Isle with a Martin Guerre twist to it. And the live version of &quot;like a rolling stone&quot; is so much more rockin' than the Highway 61 version, i'm sure Bob himself prefers it.<br />I had alot of fun slowly discovering the album. Then about 10 years later i met a good friend and dylan fan i hadn't seen in 15 years and it turned out to be his favorite album, too.
B00005JKHP|2.0|In 1979, Robert Wise's (West Side Story, The Sound of Music, The Haunting) highly budgeted, enormously special effects laden, immensely epic, and dramatically devoid of feeling Star Trek: The Motion Picture hit theaters around with the world introducing new fans to the new continuing chronicles of Admiral James T. Kirk, stoic Science Officer Spock, and sardonically comedic Doctor Leonard &quot;Bones&quot; Mc Coy. In the vast horizon of space, there appears to be an immensely lethal gigantic space being intelligence on a direct collision course with the planet Earth. So of course the United Federation of Planets allows recently promoted Admiral Kirk to helm the U.S.S. Enterprise on an extremely vital emergency mission to investigate the mystery alien's intentions. Unfortunately for all but the most blindly devoted of the Trekkie fan base, the film lacked the one crucial engineering ingredient that made the original series glisten amongst all the other one-dimensionally conventional entertainment at the time, character and humanity.<br />Though we do see momentary glimpses of the Shatner/Nimoy/Kelly character dynamic that propelled the original series ascendance into the syndication stratosphere, Star Trek: The Motion Picture creatively concentrates on a mightily bland ambiguous creature that never really fulfills on it's promise of threat to the audience, adheres too stridently to an old Hollywood pacing structure (form the 50's and 60's) that clashes as badly Star Trek as badly as platform shoes stand out at a Moshe pit, focuses on a very uninteresting romance between the first officer and a bald female navigator (both before and after one of them becomes an android), and horrendously confuses telling a intensely jargon-filled space odyssey with that of concocting a compelling movie. <br />All in all, despite an all-star cast, mind bogglingly excellent special effects, and a superbly noteworthy soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith (that track was later re-used in the vastly popular Star Trek: The Next Generation), Star Trek: The Motion Picture fails to go where almost all of it's sequels later went on to do, make an entertaining picture. <br />As for the upcoming Star Trek: the Motion Picture Director's Cut DVD Special Edition, it's intended to included a marvelously remastered anamorphic widescreen presentation, a Robert Wise commentary track, 3 documentaries, 11 deleted scenes, and more impressive Star Trek options to shake a replicated steak at. <br />Highly recommended for any Trekkie with a thirst for antiquity, but for all other indifferent non-fans stay as far away from this as you would from the Influencian Flu or Barclay's Proto-morphosis Syndrome.
630018403X|4.0|This movie is about Saturday morning detention shared by the following characters: Andrew, a wrestler, Brian, a brain, John, a criminal, Claire, a prom queen, and Alison, a basket case.

B00005O3VD|5.0|I wanted to go to the TCM Classic Movies Festival this year (2013) just to see the new 4K restoration on the big screen of FUNNY GIRL.  Alas, it was not meant to be.  I did see the previous restoration at the Ziegfeld Theater on 9/8/11, ironically a few days before one of this nation's most severe events.  That update is even more enhanced with this latest version for Blu-ray.  The colors are stunning.  The costumes come out in very vivid detail.  Keeney's Theater also shows a lot of detail that was muted before, and the details in the Baltimore hotel private dining room really pop with all the reds and details in the wallpaper.  All of the beautiful Irene Sharaff costumes show all of their detail, especially on Barbra throughout the film, and during the \\"His Love Makes Me Beautiful\\" number.  DTS sound is superb.<br /><br />My only pet peeve for this release is the chaptering, which was similar with the DVD release originally.  There are not enough chapters to take you direct to songs.  One example is at the end.  The last chapter starts with Fanny asking Flo Ziegfeld to come in to her dressing room before Nick's arrival.  You have to fast forward to My Man.  There should be a chapter added where she is about to walk on stage.  The other example is a chapter starting when Nick & Fanny are walking out of the lobster shack before he tells her he loves her.  The next chapter takes you to when they are walking into the cocktail lounge on the ship where Fanny is in the beaded dress with the long train.  Chapters should be where she is entering the railroad station, just before she starts \\"Don't Rain On My Parade\\", the Intermission break and Entr'acte music, and start of Act 2 with the sailing boat & Nick looking out of the porthole.  If Sony reads this, I hope they will consider a re-chapter before the Blu-ray is out for general release after the Amazon exclusive ends.<br /><br />The carry-over Bonus Features are the same as the DVD with This Is Streisand and Barbra In Movieland in their same versions.  These could've been cleaned up a bit for this release, but are still fun to have just the same.  I say this based on what was done to one of the bonuses with SOUND OF MUSIC called Salzburg Sight & Sound.  It was in horrible shape when issued on one of the first DVD releases, but restored for the Blu-ray & later DVD issue for the 45th Anniversary.<br /><br />Barbra fans galore will eat this up, but if you haven't seen this film before or wish to revisit it in the newest technology, this is the version to get.

B00005QG9J|2.0|Incubus used to be my favorite band. Fungus Amongus, Enjoy Incubus, SCIENCE, barely Make Yourself, but how could they sellout? Morning Veiw (besides its stupid name) shows the least talented part of Incubus. No one looks for talent anymore, just how thw band members are. All of the members are starting to look like Backstreet Boys. I just can't believe what they did.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Whether you love or hate Jar, Jar, this DVD is worth his antics. The 2nd disc of this set is chock full of extras. As if the deleted scenes are enough, there are documentaries dealing with the fighting scenes, costume design and even Lucas's thought process when it comes to writing. (3 movies every 20 years, not to shabby.)  This DVD set gives great insight into a fantastic world and the man who created it. Hopefully he will do justice to the original trilogy on DVD at some point...
B000021YQV|5.0|I am normally not into this type of music and was attracted to this CD because of the song CHOP SUEY!.  I was very surprised to find one of the best albums I've ever heard!  Chop Suey! is my favorite song and I also like ATWA but the whole CD is great.  From  Prison Song to Toxicity this a great album. Daron and Serj's voices combine to make a very catchy sound and although this is a metal album they have great harmonie.  The bass playing and drums are incredible and the best I've heard in a long time.  I also like the message in the music.  These guys rock.  Don't compare them to Slipknot, System is the better of the two bands!!!!!!
B00005QG9J|3.0|This is a good CD but the problem is that the CD is too soft and incubus is trying to repeat what they did with their last single drive.  The harder songs on this Cd are excellent and so are some of the soft songs but alot of the soft songs are boring and repetitive.  I have grown to miss the old incubus and their old sound from their past albums.  This CD is good but it just doesn't seem like the incubus that the orginal fans (before everybody liked them because of &quot;drive&quot;)learned to like and love. Hopefully the next album will be better.
B00005OB0A|5.0|Have been listening to this online--this is a great CD for a party where you do not want your guests to stand still. With this you can't stay in your seat.
B00003CXAA|1.0|Luckily I won't have to consider buying this long awaited DVD disappointment. A friend of mine picked it up the day of release and she had a viewing party. There is no need here to address the greatness of the The Godfather and The Godfather II, they are superb, wonderful, amazing films.<br />However... this package we had to wait so long for is awful. Here's my first problem with it (and it's THE major problem)- The films were NOT restored for this release. The source prints used for the first two movies were damaged. Numerous wear spots and flecking, graininess in many scenes. Artifacts are readily apparent and often distract. What a blunder, what sheer laziness and bottom line gluttony. I can understand the greed-head thinking on Paramounts part,  they didn't have to spend any extra money on restoration to satisfy film buffs, DVD collectors and assorted video geeks as they would have normally for a DVD release of a film classic (i.e. Warner's brilliant Citizen Kane release). This is one of the most popular films of all time and the public at large will buy, buy, buy. Unfortunately, they are right.<br />The other major problem I have? Being forced to pay for the awful, mind numbing bad Godfather III to get the first two films. Unconscionable.<br />I have a prediction. In about 12 to 18 months from now you will hear about Paramount bringing to market SuperDelux - Extra Special Editions of the Godfather films, touting FULL RESTORATION and each film will be sold separately at a retail price of about $30-$35 or there abouts.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I think that Shrek is one of my personal favorites.I love the way Mike Myers uses his Scottich accent.Eddie Murphy is the funniest in this movie.I plan to buy it when it comes out(I will buy the DVD of course!).If you have not seen the movie,you have got to see it soon!
B00005Q5WC|5.0|This album combines his live performances on one CD with Lee Perry sessions that are not on any other albums.  The first CD is not the original Exodus, but rather a remastered version that makes it sound better.  It includes even more additional tracks that are awesome too.  If there is one Bob CD to buy, this is the one.
B00005R2BG|5.0|This movie is AMAZING! The first time Ewan opened his mouth to sing I melted and Nicole's voice is like an angel. The songs are amazing and the filming technique makes the whole movie. I would recomend this movie to anyone. I'm definatley putting this movie on my top 10 list!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|CATS is the best musical I have ever seen!  The sets, the costumes, the music, and the acting -- all of this works together to make CATS a truly memorable experience on screen.  I highly recommend this DVD!!
6305014140|5.0|If you like the raw in yur face uncensored type of fighting then this is for you. Total oppiste of Princess Monolocke. This is a beutiful story. Great replay value!
B00003CXBH|5.0|I saw this movie twice in 1986 when it came out and I cried on both occasions.  This is one movie that I'll never forget.  The casts, the music score, the cinematography and those Indians - all combined to make this movie such a beautiful and memorable one.  OK, maybe de Niro dialogues weren't that good (so please don't put the blame entirely on his acting - I think he was quite ok but nothing compared to the Godfather II) but that was the only one minor thing that I can think of.  Otherwise, this is such a powerful movie that will make you THINK.  About lots of things, not only religious thoughts.  I can't say that I &quot;love&quot; this movie because it doesn't inspire that kind of earthly feeling.  But I'm simply &quot;in awe.\\"
B00005QG9J|5.0|I Think that this new CD is great! I like it even more than &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. Its Got Great hard rock songs and still some soft rock alternative. Just like the Last CD, only better. You should definatly get this CD.
B00005OB0A|4.0|After staging a massive critical and commercial reemergence of iconic proportions in the UK with last years' disco masterpiece LIGHT YEARS, Kylie's back with the follow-up entitled FEVER. Whereas LY drew from kitschy disco inspiration, FEVER projects a far more adult and sophisticated production style--inspiration seems to be drawn everywhere from Kraftwerk to Daft Punk. As such, it's a slightly more streamlined affair, and consequently not quite as fun as the previous outing.  First single 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' is inexplicably turning out to be her biggest worldwide hit ever, despite the fact that, though it's utterly catchy, frankly doesn't completely stand up to previous bests like 'Better The Devil You Know','Confide In Me', or 'Spinning Around'.  There are actually a few songs better than that here, especially the sterling 'Love At First Sight', which will go down as one of her best records ever, as well as the title track(which actually sounds like '80s Madonna),<br />'Burning Up', and 'Fragile'.  There's really only one skippable track here, that being the generic cast-off 'Give It To Me'.  If there's any problem here, it's that the album,though fairly seamless, has a sameness to it throughout--there's no ballads here, which isn't really bad, but after a few listens the dance tracks start bleeding into one another due to their almost identical sound.  Still, this remains one of Minogue's best efforts, but does fall just short of LIGHT YEARS' creative glory.
0393312836|4.0|Burgess said that this was one of his least favorite novels but when it comes to books that delve into the basic primal instincts of man, this one tops the lists.  He (Alex) exhibits an entirely nonchalant attitude toward violent crime.  I think that Burgess was trying to get readers to understand that if man does not stop his violent downward spiral, the world found in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; will become the world we live in.  A real horrorshow effort.
B00005QG9J|4.0|In just two years, Incubus sure has changed a lot from Make Yourself. If your favorite Incubus songs were &quot;Pardon Me&quot; and other hard rockers, you may be a little dissapoited upon scanning the album for the first time. But after a real listen, it's not so bad. The first three tracks are good rock songs, but after that it's a lot of experimental stuff with the occasional rocker like &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Blood On the Ground.&quot;<br />I'll go through the entire album now...<br />1. Nice To Know You -- 9/10 -- very nice song with a hard rocking chorus. I like the melody on the pre-chorus a lot.<br />2. Circles -- 7/10 -- one of the loudest songs on the CD. Not that melodic, but good.<br />3. Wish You Were Here -- 8/10 -- their first single on the CD, and already overplayed. You may be so sick of it that you'll never listen to this track, but it is a great song for those who can bear to hear it again.<br />4. Just a Phase -- 6/10 -- here's the beginning of the experimental stuff. It gets rocking at the end of the song, but otherwise a repeatative background guitar over quiet vocals. Not particularly good, but tolerable.<br />5. 11am -- 6/10 -- fairly soft acoustic music. Sound a little like &quot;Drive,&quot; but not enough to make it annoying.<br />6. Blood on the Ground -- 7/10 -- a good rock song after a few strange tracks. Familiar Incubus sound, but original. Pretty funky!<br />7. Mexico -- 5/10 -- a very soft song with a soft acoustic guitar. This does not fit into Incubus's genre, but is a decent song anyway.<br />8. Warning -- 9/10 -- this is definitely the next single! Arguably the best song on the album. Great funky melody and a rock chorus. Meaningful lyrics too.<br />9. Echo -- 7/10 -- another in the slew of soft songs. Seems to be one of the better of them, though.<br />10. Have You Ever -- 7/10 -- second hardest song on the CD. Fairly good melody.<br />11. Are You In? -- 7/10 -- funky soft long. Sounds kind of like something Dave Matthews Band would write.<br />12. Under My Umbrella -- 8/10 -- all I can say is that sound effect throughout the song is EXTREMELY annoying! That aside (although it does take away from the song), it is a good rock song.<br />13. Aqueous Transmission -- 9/10 -- I never thought I'd be giving a non-rock song such a high rating, but it is such a great tune. Very middle-eastern sounding. You have to hear this one to understand. It's so simple, so soft, but so great. Hard to describe.<br />Although it's not as good as Make Yourself to me, I like it as a good album that doesn't fit in with the modern rock scene. Hard rock fans who could tolerate Incubus before will hate them now probably. As the reviewer on Amazon.com put it, some may call this selling out. To me, selling out is when a rock band goes soft to be very artsy and &quot;more mature.&quot; That is kind of true of this album, but they include enough rock material to satisfy fans, and surprisingly, their new style isn't so bad anyway. If you want to see selling out, go buy Matchbox 20's 1996 album &quot;Yourself or Someone Like You,&quot; listen to it for a while, and then buy last year's &quot;Mad Season by matchbox twenty.&quot; THAT's selling out.<br />If you look at this album as a transition to a softer Incubus, you will probably enjoy it. Still, I hope the next album isn't filled with things similar to &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Just a Phase.&quot;
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Moulin Rouge is the most fantastic film ever made. I have seen it 3 times at the cinema and loved it more and more each time. Nicole Kidman sparkles as Satine and really is the &quot;Sparkling Diamond&quot;. Ewan McGregor looks gorgeous, acts the part perfectally and his singing voice is incredible. Congratulations Baz!

B0000039QA|5.0|the notorious big is no doubt the greatest rapper ever to come out of the east coast. his flow is amazing and his ability to give his lyrics so much meaning is mindblowing. life after death, which came 3 weeks after biggies tragic death(RIP), is a classic album that any rap fan must have.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I wasnt sure that Incubus would be able to surpass their last cd &quot;Make Yourself&quot; but, there new one is just as good with more hard rocking songs with great guitar riffs and and good dj work along with a few slower ballads that show off the great voice of Brandon Boyd he has a great vocal range and I highly encourage people to get this cd not just current fans of the band but new fans that dont know them real well yet checkout &quot;Morning View&quot; also get their other two &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; they are both great cds too. I love this band they are definately one of my fav bands. keep on rocking Incubus
B00005QG9J|5.0|they did it again- another really good album. definitely buy this album, its well worth your money. i knew i was goign to love it after the first track.
0966638328|5.0|A great compilation of colors that work in real life situations.
6301955293|5.0|This film, to me, was touching and made me think about life and the daily struggles and temptations we face as humans.  I can't say I've seen a film like this one.  It stands out from any other.  The actors play their roles so well and with such deep meaning.  I feel that Timothy Bottoms captivated me just by the expressions on his face and the emotion he demonstrated through out the whole movie.  Sonny Craford who was played by Timothy Bottoms was a young man trying to find his place in this world but often looked in the wrong places.  I don't think he knew any better.  I always get very emotional when I see these characters lost in their own ignorance not knowing right from wrong.  Duane Jackson who is played by Jeff Bridges is a egotistical teenager who struts around town with his girlfriend Jacy Farrow(Cybil Shepard).  They seem to both rely on each other for their physical wants as teenagers often experience.  Jacy isn't the dependable type of girlfriend.  She often fools around with other guys and doesn't give the slightest bit of remorse for people who she has hurt.  She is not very accepted by some people in town because of the way she presents herself.  Sam the Lion (Ben Johnson) is almost like a father figure for Sonny and Duane.  They both admire and respect him.  He kind of portrays the respected adult that everyone knows and loves. Ruth Popper( Cloris Leachman) is the coaches wife who is struggling with the fact that her husband is never around and there is no one to give her the affection that she needs.  She begins to look for love in the wrong place and that being Sonny Crawford(Timothy Bottoms).  They share a couple of passionate flings and Ruth feels she can still be loved by someone.  She is now getting kind of attached to these flings and it is personal to her.  On the other hand Sonny doesn't take their relationship that seriously and gets involved with Jacy.  She always gets whatever guy she wants and uses them for personal pleasure.  Jacy is the tramp of the town.  Through out the whole movie some of these characters are continuosly looking for something else, something better but, the result ends up hurting them in the end.  Each of the main characters carries something with them that just doesn't satisfy their physical or emotional needs.  The first time I saw this film I was blown away by the amount of emotion displayed by each of the actors.  One in particular and that is Timothy Bottoms.  Towards the end of the movie I begin to see his true feelings emerge caused by an unfortunate accident.  I feel that through that accident he began to realize that life can be painful and sometimes the most unnoticed people can have the biggest impact on you.  I have never been more touched by an actors preformance than Timothy Bottoms.  In the beginning of the movie he makes his way around experiementing with different things trying to find himself in the world and at the end he learns an important lesson that will change his life forever and he finally gets in touch with his inner most emotions.  This film is very real and it shows how people often try to find themselves in the world.  I highly recommend this movie if you are looking for an emotional and real eye opening drama that brings out the true feelings in people and often brought out by painful experiences or struggles.
B000003AEB|5.0|snoops doggystyle is without a doubt his best work and definitely one of the best albums ever made. he probably has the best voice in rap, cuz it fits his smooth flow so well. this is pretty much CHRONIC 2, it is all g funk, with cuts from D-R-E, and my opinion beats out the classic chronic. you dont know what ur missing out if u dont got this
B00005QG9J|4.0|The new Incubus album shows a level of maturity from the band that started out as much more of a punk band.  Hard rocking songs such as &quot;Have you ever&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; show the rocking routes while songs such as &quot;I wish you were here&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Mexico&quot; show a much more mellow and introspective side of Incubus.  They even use some viloins in &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Just a Phase&quot; overall this album shows a growing up , and is definetly worth the price.  Brandon Boyd's voice sounds like it is brought much closer to its potetional and used extremely well.  The slightly funky background isnt' lost either, it is evident in most songs.  I recommend for either the people who like rock, or like a softer side of rock too, an extremely worthwhile album.
B0000062FJ|4.0|This is the first of three albums by the classic Santana lineup: Carlos Santana on guitar, Gregg Rolie on keyboards and vocals, Dave Brown on bass, Mike Shrieve on drums, and Jose Areas and Mike Carabello on percussion.  The band shows a great improvement over the 1968 recordings at the Fillmore -- Carlos's playing is much more confident and inventive, the addition of Mike Shrieve loosens up the drumming, and Areas and Carabello bring out the Afro-Latin aspects of the music.  At the same time, the band's sound is still strongly rooted in the blues (especially on &quot;You Just Don't Care&quot;) and wouldn't fully achieve its potential until 1970's Abraxas.  Nevertheless, many of the performances are absolute classics -- especially the fiery organ-guitar duel on &quot;Waiting&quot; and the explosive &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot;.  Those familiar with Santana's radio hits will of course recognize &quot;Evil Ways&quot; and their chugging version of Olatunji's &quot;Jingo&quot;, while the laid-back Latin groove of &quot;Treat&quot; provides a nice respite.  And the bonus tracks, from the band's Woodstock performance, make this album even more essential: you get to hear exactly why the live performance of &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot; blew away so many acid-drenched listeners at the festival.  It's still speaker-frying 32 years later.  If you like the stinging guitar and swirling organ of early Santana, their debut is a must-buy.

B00005OMTT|4.0|Possibly a misnomer - it is hard to recall many of these tracks ever being hits -this greatest hits set never the less contains everything you expect from Enigma: catchy repetetive rhythms, breathy whispered vocals and a clutch of well chosen samples, even if these are often the best bits. <br />Like Enya, Enigma main man Michael Cretu has never seen fit to tinker with a winning formula and and as such this compilation comes across as an original album, a feeling enhanced by the fact the songs segue seamlessly into one another.<br />Standouts include 'Gravity of Love' with its pounding John Bonham rhythm and clever use of 'O Fortuna'; 'Return To Innocence' with its joyous tribal chant and the late night moodiness of 'I Love You... I'll Kill You'. The ubiquitous monks pop up throughout and 'O Fortuna' reappears on the shouty 'Modern Crusaders'.<br />There are occassional lapses into background mood music ('Shadows in Silence', 'Smell the Desire') and the lyrics rarely rise above empty new-age guff, but for those that enjoyed the singles but find trawling through the original releases too much to bear, this is an ideal package.
B000003S0R|5.0|I remember getting this album when it first came out and being totally and completely blown out of the water by it.  This stuff is still amazing after all these years, unfortunately there are no bands or artists writing material like this anymore.  The 1000 clicking typewriter keys are scary.  Some of the songs on it still make the hair stand up on the back of my neck.  I enjoy every single song on this amazing CD and will be going back and replenishing my CD collection with all the Eno albums Ive listened to over the years and managed to lose one way or another.  Its amazing how much lasting power a lot of the pioneers still have.  Just saw Roxy Music and that was excellent!!!!  Wish I could have seen them with Eno in the band though, oh well.
0553577123|5.0|Except for a book titled &quot;I Survived Hitler's Ovens&quot; which I read as a teen-ager in the fifties and have never since been able to locate, this book comes closest to conveying the effects of a genocidal war on non-combatants.  I understand a new edition of this work with passages restored which Otto Frank originally omitted is due to be published.  If anyone knows more about this edition and when it may be available, please post or email. Also, if this book intrigues you and you ever have a chance to attend the stageplay, don't miss it.

B00005LQ04|5.0|What many claim is the definitive Dario Argento movie(some say &quot;Deep Red&quot; but I say this), has been put into a wonderful DVD.  I waited for weeks for the limited edition.  It was well worth the wait.  The limited edition throws in everything, but the kitchen sink.  While the laserdisc was in letterbox, the colors were washed out.  Pity too, since that was they used a technique which enhanced the colors into a deeper, richer texture (in letterbox to show the entire picture).  Thankfully, the DVD lets us see this wonderful enhancement beautifully.  On the second disc, we see interviews with the filmakers and stars of the film.  We also get a bit of a hint why we still haven't seen the conclusion of &quot;Three Mothers&quot; Trilogy.  It also has an interesting interview of the composer of the bizarre music to the movie.  The third disc is a CD soundtrack to the movie, which contains a terrific updated version of the theme song (a music video of the song is in the first disc).  All in all, an excellent DVD set.  Bravo to Anchor Bay!
B00005NWRS|5.0|Does it every make you wonder that the people who don't like something are the ones that wish they could be that one thing. Damn, I wish I would have wrote just 3 of the songs on these 2 discs, I'd be happy! I think it's great! I've followed this young man through his music only, I don't know the guy. What we have is someone, I believe, who has a great passion for words and song. Music is to be enjoyed and this is a great place to be! I'm 41 and it's wonderful to see a fresh face just make the music he wants. For those of you who read to much into things, for shame, LET THE KID PLAY!!!
B000051VWW|4.0|I have read the reviews, and somewhat have to agree with them. I still don't think the album is bad, in fact there are a couple of tracks on here that are very haunting. I think the people who buy this album are trying to buy a memory as well. You will probably be disappointed in that case. It's a good album. Sade has grown up. A lot. She was great in concert, but the 80's isn't her stuff anymore. It's not like the first few albums. It's older, and like Sade, I am older now too. Don't try to buy the 80's, appreciate the 00's and you'll appreciate this more reflective, soulful album.
0679805273|5.0|I purchased this book for my two year old.  We enjoy reading it together.  This book is much longer than the other Dr. Suess books.  Each page tends to have more words on it than the other Dr. Suess books.  I know my two year old really likes to turn pages and often gets bored if we spend to much time on one page.  So I think a child a little older will like this book.  However, We still rate it a 5 star because we enjoy it and like to read it often.
0679745203|5.0|I am reading this incredibly lyrical and emotionally complex novel with my high school students.  Most of it, admittedly, is above their heads.  But they do recognize its beauty, it's easy grace-like we do in really good poetry or in great songs, or like in falling in love. The English Patient is beautiful in most imaginable ways, and has become like a song we sing together in class everyday.  Ondaatje says, &quot;a novel is like a mirror walking down the road.&quot; He slips into lines like these as if they were nothing at all, but they will leave you speechless with their unadorned truth and honesty.<br />I know years from now, when these ninth graders have their own kids, and find love or not; when some of them slip into affairs and disappointments, and even joy, they will remember Katherine and Almasy- and the emptiness of the desert.  What else is literature for? <br />In the middle of our national crisis, Katherine's words seem to haunt all of us with their portent- &quot;We're the real countries, not the boundaries drawn on maps, or the names of powerful men.&quot;  Try beating that.  There is nothing left to say, really. Is there?
B00005QG9J|1.0|I hate this band. There is no band I hate more, as a matter of fact. Eisigner is the sorriest excuse for a lead singer I've ever seen. All the way through this CD, the band repeats its' sorry performance on \\"Make Yourself.\\" There's so much noise- not music, it just sounds like 5,000 guitars all doin' their own thing at once. It's just screaming, ferocious guitar playing and, well, that's really it. You can't distinguish one song from the next, you can't even begin to guess what they're talking about, and (worse of all) it sounds just like their last ...release. No development here. Keep moving, folks.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This movie is great. It has great action and Russell Crowe fits the role of Maximus perfectly. The special effects are sweet! This is a MUST SEE MOVIE!!!
B000002GQH|5.0|It's hard not to rate an &quot;original&quot; Moody Blues album with 5 stars.   Their music stands alone in the rock world.  It is extremely melodic compositions.  It appeals to hard rock underground music listeners, much more so than the &quot;pop rock&quot; listeners of the 60s and 70s.  Why is that???    The Moody Blues are so ignored by music critics and so many others.  On their numerous lists of the greatest this or that, they barely get mentioned, if at all. Why is that??   Even VH1 has never put out any kind of special on them. (?)   Quite frankly, it really doesn't bother me.   Mainstream media and fans have missed the boat nearly a million times.  This is just another example of where the superficial crowd just doesn't get it. <BR>    The Moody Blues are super talented.  Their music is most appealing and intriguing.  Their songs achieved even greater heights back then because of the type of things college kids did to enhance the moment.   It was such a nice compliment of mellow, yet heavy melodic sounds in the late night after partying to The Doors, or Deep Purple, or Uriah Heep, or a number of other rock icons of that era.<BR>Threshold of a Dream continues the high standards of their previous material.   Impressionable songs for me that quickly come to mind are &quot;So deep within you&quot;, &quot;Are you sitting comfortably&quot;,  and of course,  &quot;Have you heard / The Voyage.&quot;   The latter duo is a heavy trip.   Life was fun back then.  It's so hard to replicate that feeling anymore.
B000021Y77|5.0|Great movie, short and fun to watch.  (Although I got tired of the running bit, I got it, she runs.)  Overall, this movie was just fantastic.  If you want something different, this is it.  (Beware, it has subtitles)
B0000029DD|5.0|Simply put, Jeff Buckley Grace is the best album of the 1990's and my personal favorite. He was blessed with an amazing voice and songwriting ability, which he displayed in his only studio album release prior to his death. The range of music is amazing, going from the simplicity of Hallelujah to the hard driving Eternal Life. My personal favorites are Lover, You Should've Come Over, Last Goodbye, Grace, and Eternal Life (but I could list nearly every track). Truly a must buy for any music fan, you will not be disappointed.
B00005QG9J|4.0|There is something strangely charasmatic and sincere about lead singer Brandon Boyd's vocals. Over the top of dreamy riffs which accompany the typically powerful chorus riffs are lyrics that are highly emotive. Incubus have been accused as being sellouts since Drive got all that airplay (it deserved). However, if you look back at all of Incubus' work it hasn't changed much only progressed. While this album isn't SCIENCE it's of definate Make Yourself quality.
6302800897|5.0|A Truly fine cast recalls the case of murder in the U.P. of Michigan. Its nice to see Judge Welch( Famous for the McCarthy hearings) display his charm and uncanny timimg. <br />A hand picked cast delivers the goods in a special way. Eve Arden the long suffering secy, rarely gets paid..and voices her displeasure. Arthur O'Connell as the aging assistant to Stewart is just terrific. Lee Remick is sweet and confused.Ben Gazzara is distant and suffers from all types of &quot;impulses&quot; <br />George C. Scott persuaded Premminger to take on te role of Atty. Dancer and shows his mettle here( as in Burt in &quot; The Hustler&quot;)<br />Finally, Jim Stewart is just amazing..he whines...possibly overacts a bit..has histrionics in place..yet we cant take our eyes off of him. He rambles and stammers and we dont know for sure if its an act...or just acting. Duke Ellington,s score..is way ahead of its time...for sure.. <br />CP
0743216458|5.0|When I read this book, I felt that I was in action with the Easy company, if they were training, fighting, talking, sleeping and everything that they had done. <BR>The book is really accurate, and provides many details, all the while being written like a novel. I was very impressed on the amount of detail that Ambrose put into this epic history. <BR>The easy company is also one of the best groups to write about because they did it all. They went from D-Day to Holland and Germany.<BR>The action that was in the book kept me hooked to the last page. I am very glad that it was written!
B00004Z459|1.0|Underneath a bunch of stolen riffs, copycat-style lyrics and an overall borrowed sound is potentially a very talented band. Unfortunately it seems to have become an industry standard to include songs of angst and depression on every album then release them as a single. Linkin Park play too much on the rock-rap movement that is so big right now. This scene seems to have exploded and other bands seem to jump right on the band wagon. It happened in Seattle and it's happening now. Whilst bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, RATM and the Deftones paid thier dues and became stalwarts of the rap nu-metal sound, what you have is other bands like Linkin Park, Taproot and Crazy Town riding on and disturbingly cashing in on their success. Like I said, underneath all of these crappy gimmicks like 2 singers and a turntablist lies a decent band I'm sure. Let's hope Linkin Park can find their own orginality and step away from the try-hard Limp sound....sell out anyone?
0767817478|5.0|If you have a DVD player connected to a very good sound system, make no mistake, this DVD is the one ! . The sound of this movie, from the musical score to the special effects are excellent. Aside from this, I pretty much share the same opinion everyone has of this movie : not only it could have been a franchise , but it was at least 20 minutes too long !!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|although this cd is not like the others in its sense of music it demonstrates many tunes from around the world and different cultures. Music is best when it mixes all kinds of different sounds into it and this album does that. Incubus shows an open mind and as a result the album is great go buy and support the group
B00005A46T|2.0|Slipknot's new release is a big let down.  All the songs sound the same and the lyrics sound like the same words only rearranged.  This CD came out of my player suprisingly quick.  Self-titled was much better.  Don't buy this unless you're 14, or a hardcore knot fan.
0792833260|5.0|Classic - if you haven't seen this movie, you need to drive to the video store tonight and rent it.  Absolutely wonderful acting, great storyline, fantastic plot.  Dustin Hoffman at his best.  Tom Cruise is only mildly annoying as well.  Great flick!!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Hard hitting and moving.  One of the best in my collection.
630420065X|4.0|Some people thought that this movie was confusing, and like any good Mission Impossible it is a bit mis-leading.  Unlike the sequel MI:2, Mission Impossible is a very thickened plot with many twists that leave you thinking; what is going to happen next?<br />Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a point man for the US's version of the British special services (007's group), called IMF.  When a mission goes bad, Hunt (Cruise) is the only one left from his IMF team that is stays alive.  Hunt later finds out that the entire operation was a plot to uncover an IMF leak.<br />In a desperate attempt to prove his innocence Hunt recruits disavowed agents to help him.  Mission Impossible is a great suspense and you never know until the very end what exactly is going to happen.
B00005IBGQ|4.0|This new cd by Rufus is about one of the best cds Ihave purchased this year! Had I known it was this good I would have bought it when it was first released!!  I highly recommend it if you love catchy and simple lyrics and great vocals! Its worth buying!!
B000002H2H|4.0|I suppose it should be stated for the record that I am not much of a Metallica fan.  Load and Reload were largely an insult, and the black album only had a few really great tracks.  However, this and Master Of Puppets really show what Metallica is capable of at their best.  A great album.
B000002MT0|5.0|I first heard this CD when it was released in 1994.  Perhaps you just have to be in the right place to connect with the music here.  Actually, I find that to be true of all music especially music by Prince.  Some people have been very critical of this CD as a collection from the vault.  Personally, I am ok with that, it doesn't matter when a song was written as long as it means something to you when you hear it.  Many of the songs are dark and may seem depressing. Some songs seem excessively long, but then any true Prince fan is familar with his jams and how long they can last.  I give it 5 stars because I connected with the songs, it was also a dark time in my life and oddly this cd helped me feel better.
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you expect Incubus' latest album, &quot;Morning View,&quot; to be a funk-metal fest, then you may be a tad dissapointed. Yes, It does contain some awesome heavy songs, such as &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Blood On The Ground,&quot; but all in all this album is much mellower than &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; and even &quot;Make Yourself.&quot; Most of the songs mix heavy and mellow, with &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; &quot;Under My Umbrella,&quot; and &quot;Warning&quot; being the best examples. These songs, especially the awesome &quot;Wish You Were Here,&quot; do not dissapoint, and are full of energy and emotion. However, some songs, such as &quot;Echo&quot; an &quot;Mexico,&quot; are very light, acoustic songs, but that doesn't mean that they aren't enjoyable; in fact, they are refreshing breaks from the heavier songs on this album. Also, although the d.j. is on this CD, there is less of him on &quot;Morning View&quot; than on previous efforts, so huge fans of his may be dissapointed. However is their best release: there is less Limp-inspired rap-metal (yes, Boyd sings on most of this disc)and more original sounding material.
0446608955|4.0|There is no way that this book, just like Sparks' other books would disappoint this reader in any way.  The reader can tell of the tension between the two main characters and that there is a subtle hint of a budding love story, but what the reader cannot guess is the beautiful love story that is sure to not leave a dry eye in the house!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I can see it already.  I can see people calling Incubus mainstream, saying that they have sold out, but no, they have not.  They have stayed true to their adventorous and artistic natures and this CD shows off those qualities in the band perfectly.  Every song in the CD is amazing.  While this is probably their most mellow CD, in my opinion it is their best.  It is the first Incubus CD that actually flows very well.  Good job, guys......keep it up
B00005QG9J|5.0|I think this album is amazing. I think these guys will be influencing the music of other artist to come. I love the original guitar work of Mike Einziger and Brandon Boyd's vocals/lyrics are so heart felt on this album. This is the CD for you people who are tired of the typical rock you hear from other rock artists these days on the radio.
B00003CX8I|5.0|this was a great movie.my mom didnt like it,she thought it was<BR>dumb,but i think it was good.<BR>the acting in this movie was great,effects are great.<BR>if you like this you will like titanA.E.
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins, co-author of Built To Last, has done it again!  This time he spent 5 years trying to find out what differentiates good companies from great companies.  This study can be applied to entrepreneurial ventures and to current corporate America.  After reading this book you may see your company from a much different perspective than in the past and it may have you thinking about the effectiveness of senior managers within your company.  I believe it is a book that business executives will read and keep handy for reference.<br />This book is a study of companies that exceed their industry, the overall stock market and produce PHENOMENAL returns over a 15-year period (15 of them are very \\"normal\\" years and the next 15 years are full of explosive growth).  Some key points you will take away from this book include:<br />1) Growth in most companies came after years and years of trying to adapt / mold a concept into something the company truly believed in.  Once this happened the growth engine got going.<br />2) Great managers worry more about getting the right people on board and the wrong people off board BEFORE they establish a corporate stategy.<br />3) Most great CEOs came from within their own ranks and weren't recruited from the outside.<br />4) Executive compensation didn't appear to be a key driver of corporate performance<br />5) The respective great companies exceeded the overall stock market in creating shareholder value by at least 3x during their 15 year run measured (some for many more years).  While some may say this is not much think about the steel industry and how many are filing for bankruptcy.  Nucor Steel still managed to beat the S&amp;P by more than 3x.<br />6) The great companies in this book blew away their comparable peer group.  Wells Fargo vs. Bank of America, Kroger vs. other grocery chains, Walgreens vs. Eckerd, etc.<br />7) Collins describes a Level 5 leader.  After reading this section I was amazed at how many CEOs I recognized as not being Level 5 leaders.  This may, in the near future, shake up executive compensation plans, CEO searches and potentially affect corporate governance.<br />8) Technology accelerated a transformation but was regarded as a tool.  It didn't define the company.<br />9) M&amp;A activity played virtually no role in going from good to great.<br />That is all I will write about the book.  I could write on and on about how good this book is.  Read it.  It will change the way you think about business.  Other very good books on the principles of business and entrepreneurship are Leading at the Speed of Growth by Catlin and Mathews and The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Jack Trout and Al Ries.el 5 leaders.

B000009QPG|5.0|This is for sure Slayer's best album ever since. Every tune, every riff, every goddam' second on the album is worth buying and listening to. From the introduction of the album with the legendary speed/agression masterpiece War Ensemble to the groovy ending of one of Sleyer's best tracks ever Seasons In The Abyss, every song is a step forward in Slayer's music and Thrash Metal history. This is one of the top three albums in Thrash Metal - no matter what the future will hold, Slayer's and their last great album Seasons In The Abyss' name is written in blood in the book of Metal! Haven't listened to yet? You should feel sorry for yourself...
6300213668|5.0|I first saw Grease when I was nine years old and have grown up with it up until today. Looking back, I can't believe how much of the sexual innuedo I didn't understand when I watched it for the first time! (John Travolta wiping siren wrap over his crotch, A screen with a hotdog jumping into a bun while Travolta is singing &quot;Stranded at the Drive-In&quot;)What makes this movie so special is simply the quality- maybe it doesn't have the special effects or a message you can live your life by, but it is one of the most fun, timeless pieces of work you will see for years to come. Trust me, you will NEVER get tired of it. If you can, try seeing it in a theatre because with twenty other girls in front of you singing along to Summer Nights, it will be ten times more difficult to get those infectious songs out of your head.
B000002GBB|5.0|Without a doubt, Styx hit their stride with \\"The Grand Illusion\\" and \\"Pieces of Eight.\\"  They were never this good before or after.  I sense that it is the early presence of Tommy Shaw (aka, the Pride of Montgomery, Alabama) and perhaps some competitive tension that rocketed this band from regional-heroes-made-good to top-40 radio royalty.  The first cut on The Grand Illusion (called, to no one's surprise, The Grand Illusion) features a scorching Tommy Shaw solo in the bridge after the first chorus, followed by a soaring JY solo after the second chorus.  And that head-to-head interplay continues throughout these two albums.  I like this band's material for a lot of reasons, but it's the head-cuttin' and interplay between these two fine rock guitarists that keeps me interested after twenty-some-odd years.<br />It was the late seventies: Led Zep, Yes, Rush, Kansas, Queen, Pink Floyd, etc-throw in Alan Parsons, Steely Dan and Al Stewart for good measure.  The music was ambitious and pretentious.  Nobody plays this kind of stuff anymore.  And if the critical knock is that these guys put some thought into what they were doing, learned how to play their instruments, and produced the heck out of their albums, geez, guess they're guilty.<br />BTW, the aboriginal inhabitants of Easter Island each believed they were protected by a personal spirit, which they called their \\"aku aku.\\"  Read \\"Aku Aku'\\" by Thor Heyerdahl, the marvelous Norwegian adventurer and ethnologist, if you are at all interested in Easter Island.  Maybe Amazon can find you a copy...
0440180295|1.0|As one of the set books on my university course I found Slaughterhouse Five to be the most enjoyable of the lot (so far)...<br />At heart, Slaughterhouse Five is sf but rated highly on anybody's list because it's not just sf. It's genreless if you like. The point of narrative is constantly changing, the main character, Billy Pilgrim, timetravels to the extent of knowing the time of his own death. Of course, Slaughterhouse Five's theme is war, more precisely the impact of war on the minds of its survivors (Kurt Vonnegut in the driving seat). And the mix of realism with humorous sf makes Slaughterhouse Five one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a while. But it.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Okay, yes, Adams has a tendency to sound like a myriad of artists from days gone by (Neil Young, the Byrds, and even Robert Plant on one track).  But in a time when souless hip-hop, twice-removed grunge and boy bands with, and without, guitars (yes, that's you Limp Bizkit and Lincoln Park) rule the radio waves, Ryan Adams is a welcome breath of fresh air.  I recently saw a live performance of Ryan's in a club in Boston and he brought the house down, playing tracks from \\"Gold\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" and covers by musicians as varied as Elton John and Black Flag.  ...After talking to him, I can tell you this guy is a true original, making me appreciate \\"Gold\\" even more.
6302206294|1.0|Costner's terrible accent. A lot of meaningless, gory dungeon scenes. The supposedly &quot;enlightened&quot; Moor in a movie that opens up in a Moorish dungeon. If they are going to insult my intelligence by saying 13th century Europeans couldn't even count, then they are the fools. A reprehensible farce.<BR>The Robin Hood in this movie is a dull, passionless anti-hero. If you make it to the end of this stupid film, you might find yourself wondering what was the point of the whole thing.
B00005A46T|5.0|This album is awesome! That is really all that needs to be said!! Although nothing compares to the first album, Iowa is great.  I saw them live at OzzFest 2001 in Charlotte, NC and they put on one of the best shows I have EVER seen.  These guys are CRAZY, but aren't we all?  The album is full of awesome lyrics, and exploding instruments, but it is well worth picking up ASAP!!  If you get the chance, definately go see them live!!
B00005NB0H|5.0|I have got the LP. That was great. Crackling noises were OK! After all: It's Live! Then I got the CD, with extra material. No crackling noises but pure quality time! This is what a live album should be! Couldn't get any better!! I thought. And then there was three: Live at Leeds [DeLuxe Edition]. The complete live performance, just as if you were there. The label should say: Play loud!! This is the best live rockin' band at his best. Namely: Live at Leeds!
0553277472|5.0|Before reviewing Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, let me mention that most people will either love or hate the book.  Few will be indifferent.<br />Those who will love the book will include those who enjoy philosophy, especially those who are well read in that subject; people who ride and maintain their own motorcycles; readers who are interested in psychology, particularly in terms of the mass hypnosis of social concepts; individuals who are curious about the line we draw between sanity and insanity; and people who want to think about how to deal with troubling personal situations, especially as a parent.  As someone who has all of these interests and perspectives, the book fit my needs very well.<br />Those who will dislike the book are people who like lots of action in their novels, dislike the subjects described above, and who want easy reading.  This book is very thick with concepts, ideas, metaphors, and layering which reward careful reading and thought.  Most text books are considerably easier to read and understand.  Few modern novels are any more difficult to read from an intellectual and emotional perspective.<br />Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance has several story lines that intertwine to create a synthesis of thought and experience:<br />- a father and young son take a motorcycle trip from the Midwest to California<br />- the father has an internal dialogue with himself about what he observes about the people around him and their engagement with life and technology<br />- the father attempts to reconstruct the ideas and perspective he had before being treated as a mental patient (which treatment destroyed and distorted his memory and personality)<br />- the father looks at the great philosophers of western and eastern civilization and attempts to integrate their thoughts into an aesthetic built around our ability to know quality when we see and experience it<br />- the father deals with the incipient signs of mental instability in his son and himself.<br />The book is almost impossible to characterize, but let me try anyway.  Perhaps the closest book to this one is Hermann Hesse's Siddharta.  At the same time, there is also a strong flavor of Zen and the Art of Archery.  On the Road by Jack Kerouac covers some of the same intellectual and emotional territory.  John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men considers some of the same questions of personal perspective.  In terms of challenging the constrictions of society, there is also an element of The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit here.<br />What is most remarkable about the book is the way that it pinpoints the spiritual vacuum in the pursuit of more and shinier personal items.  Unlike many books from this time, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance upholds a concept of nobility and worth connected to pursuing material progress in ways that reflect eliminating low quality and replacing it with high quality.  Think of this as being like the joy of craftsmanship, compared to the dullness of the assembly line.  By setting high standards, expanding those standards, sharing those standards with others, and inspiring people to experience life more fully, we can move forward spiritually as well as intellectually.  The motorcycle maintenance details connect these abstractions back to the practical issues of every day, as we roll along across country with the author and his son dealing with the realities of keeping our bike running where the repair and parts options are very limited.<br />The book's afterward is particularly interesting, in which Mr. Pirsig opines about why this book has had such great and lasting appeal and tells you what happened after the book ends.<br />Ultimately, I felt uplifted by the high respect that Mr. Pirsig has for his readers.  He takes us very seriously, thinks we are intelligent, and pays us the compliment of believing that we can learn to fundamentally change all of our perspectives and experiences.<br />After you finish this book(if you decide to read it), I suggest that you think about where you disengaged from the challenges, tasks, and people around you.  Then, pick out one area and get deeply involved.  As you master that one, take on another.  And so on.  Soon, you will have new and greater respect for yourself . . . and more rewarding relationships.<br />Get your hands dirty!(if you decide to read it), I suggest that you think about where you disengaged from the challenges, tasks, and people around you.

0930289528|5.0|What more can I say? Alan Moore, the greatest living comic book writer, and David Lloyd, one of the greatest living comic book artists combined to make the most beautiful piece of fiction ever created by anyone, living or dead, in any medium. Alan Moore's other work such as WATCHMEN, FROM HELL, and THE KILLING JOKE are also magnificent, but V takes the cake. A familiar story: a dystopian future society with one leader who monitors everything and everybody through a supercomputer and rules with a facist regime. But the whole society is thrown into upheaval because of one man's machinations: he does not have a name, you can call him V.<br />In many ways, it's a superhero story mixed with elements of Shakespeare's HAMLET and Orwell's 1984, but is a multi-layered, multi-charactered story and anyone with a passion for great literature and especially those with a passion for great graphic novels.<br />AVE ATQUE VALE.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The only complaint I have is that you cannot watch the movie with the complete deleted scenes in the movie, other than that I think its great can't wait till the rest are on dvd!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I must say after listening to Wish You Were Here on the radio I almost expected another album similar to Make Yourself with WYWH the &quot;Drive&quot; of Morning View...I was wrong...<br />Morning View its perfectly titled in my opinion.  Its not overly forceful or hardcore.  Its the kinda of music that floats through your head when you think of the morning...<br />The tracks are for the most part more laid back, that is, slower, and softer, than Make Yourself, or even SCIENCE for that matter.  Some may say that they're getting softer and more sold out with each album.  I disagree.  I think this album is merely one side of their style, the songs have mature attitude and uniqueness that defies the cliched pop material we hear from many other mainstream artists.<br />My personal favorites off the album...(in no particular order)<br />Echo <BR>Wish You Were Here<BR>11am<BR>Mexico<BR>Aqueous Transmission<br />Incubus has staked out and conquered new territory in this album.<br />You will buy it now.
0684869713|5.0|This is a very powerful story.  Ayn Rand explored good and evil like no one else.  This book explores a great many characters.  She goes from Roark, the idealistic good, and Wynand, the man that should have been good, through Keating, the weak, and Toohey, the evil.<br />Ayn Rand demonstrates the evil so thoroughly one is left in despair that good might survive.<br />This is a wonderful and original story.  No one else has written like Rand.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Many will be tempted to compare this album to their other ones, but it isn't really fair because they're a different band now then when they released S.C.I.E.N.C.E, Make Yourself, Fungus Amongus and Enjoy Incubus. I am glad that they didn't take the Sugar Ray road and make an album that sounds like their hit single. In other words, there is no remake of &quot;Drive&quot; on this album, it's all different styles.<BR>   There is definetly a maturity to Incubus's lyrics. Some may look at the fact that they have a DJ and group them with the &quot;Nu-Metal&quot; bands, but they are nothing like that. The DJ actually adds to the songs, rather than trying to force samples into songs.<BR>   &quot;Morning View&quot; starts off with an upbeat, catchy song, and ends with a Eastern feel. It was their intention to make you feel as if you were floating down a river while listening to it, and it works. Very relaxing. &quot;Just A Phase&quot; is one of the highlights of the album, due to the emotional impact of the slow then hard range. &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; just sounds great, and is very uplifting. There aren't any weak tracks, although there are a few which I feel just aren't as strong as the rest of the material. They took the sound of &quot;Make Yourself&quot; and took it one step further. Incubus's music is a growing process, and there is a lot to learn in life from a band like this. One of the few jems left in the music scene.
B0000013G9|5.0|Do you think that 14 million people bought a stinker ??  Not a chance.  They ALL knew that this was one of the best CD's ever produced.  <br />I agree with Josh Carter's review.  No matter what kind of music you like - rock, pop, R&amp;B, hip hop, soul, rap, whatever - no music collection is complete without this CD.  Look at the dates on some of the other reviews here on Amazon - 7 YEARS after this CD was released, people are STILL saying that it is one of the best CD's around.  That should tell you something.<br />Hey, it's worth buying this CD just to hear T-Boz singing &quot;Oh I, Oh I, Oh I&quot; on &quot;Creep&quot;.  VERY crazy, sexy, and cool .......
0061040967|5.0|This book is a must-read for Discworld fans.  It's got it all - literally:  dragons, wizards, Rincewind, Death discussing quantum physics, Valkyries, the Watch, the Librarian, the gods, and the barbarians.<br />I was afraid that, being an oversize, illustrated novel, the story might be skimpy in favour of the paintings, but I really should've known better.  I should've trusted Terry Pratchett.  This is now one of my two favourite Discworld tales (the other being Reaper Man, mainly because I like Death a lot).<br />The plot?  Cohen and his band of heroes have decided that they're going to give fire back to the gods.  In view of the harshness of the divine punishment meted out to the original thief of fire (chained to a rock, eagle pecking out his regenerative liver, you know), they're going to give it back in style.  We're talking a monstrous keg of black powder here.<br />What the heroes don't realize is that their plan, if it works, will have disastrous effects for the Disc as a whole.  Fortunately, others *do* realize this, and so a plan is put into action to stop Cohen and his Silver Horde.  Unfortunately, the plan involves getting to the top of the Disc's highest mountain by falling *off* the edge....<br />Almost everyone makes an appearance in this tale, including several brand-new characters (like Evil Harry Dread, and Vena the Raven-Haired).  Even Great A'tuin and the elephants show up.  The illustrations are gorgeous, ranging from two-page paintings to sketches by Leonard da Quirm, and they make a perfect complement to the story being told.  They immerse you in the story.  Even on the &quot;blank&quot; pages, there are often watermark copies of pictures shown elsewhere in the story.<br />It's raucous, it's hilarious, it's well-paced and it includes much discussion about the unwritten Code of Heroes, which is often seen in other works but never admitted to.  (Example:  One brave and determined man will *always* win against seven enemies.  It's just that way.It's the Code.)<br />And as a final note:  If you didn't feel sorry for Rincewind before, you certainly will upon seeing the pictures of him in this book.<br />Enjoy!  I sure did.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Buy this Album.  Right now.  Get up and buy it.  It way to amazing to not be in your collection.  Although they are getting softer... with more drive-like songs, and slower ballads, Incubus is changing for the better.  Plus the harder one's are better now I think.  <br />1) Nice to Know You- intended to be the first single until they found Wish You Were Here.  It's pretty cool... one of the harder songs, proly next single I'm guessing. 9/10<br />2) Circles- I downloaded this song about a month before MV was released.  I regret it.  I'm reletivly bored of it now and it's one of the best songs on the CD.  Pretty hard and really cool vocals and lyrics. 9/10<br />3) Wish You Were Here- single... ok song... lots of bass... 6/10<br />4) Just A Phase- one of my fav songs ever... starting out slow and peaceful... awesome lyrics... building to a fakeout climax... and then hitting you with the same build into an awesome peak.  I love it. 10/10<br />5) 11am- if MV had a drive, this is it.  Pretty cool.  I like the guitar and Brandon's high pitched kinda spooky hum at the begining.  Possible single i think. 8/10<br />6) Blood on the Ground- pretty angry song... another one the internet spoiled for me. But I still love it. 9/10<br />7) Mexico-  acoustic feel.  Showcases Brandon's voice. Chicks like this one alot... 7/10<br />8) Warning-  lot's of Brandon again.  I like the guitar in it though.  Cool lyrics. 8/10<br />9) Echo-  least fav on the CD... doesn't impress me, but not terrible.  I haven't listened to it enough yet I guess. 5/10<br />10) Have You Ever- Harder than the previous 3.  I DLed this one too.  I'm most tired of this one, even though it's really cool. 8.5/10<br />11) Are You In?- very different.  I like it more everytime i hear it. I really like Brandons vocals, the funky guitar and the backroudn noise.  It's pretty good.  8.5/10<br />12) Under My Umbrella- Possibly my favorite song on the CD.  I like my music harder, like this one... so it has an unfair advantage against Just a Phase... they are both awesome.  I listen to this one over and over though, and don't get bored... maybe because I'm trying to figure out the lyrics. 10/10<br />13) Aquareous Transmission- experimental and 7 minutes long, but it doesn't suck like Magic Medicine did.  Brandon does sing. I'm not rating it though...<br />Anyway...<BR>I've been an Incubus fan scince S.C.I.E.N.C.E., and I love everything they've done... and this is no exception.  So unless you hated Make Yourself (which would make you weird) buy Morning View.
B00000JMOJ|3.0|I have yet to see a movie with more naive and silly plot than this one. The story is so foolish you would not believe. The plot has too many holes. I would say the whole story line is a big, big hole. The actions and fights were not far from being substandard. But I still would give a credit to it. &quot;The Running Man&quot; was a great and a very original show to watch. The stalkers were real monsters; they looked and acted like killer machines. The most terrific stalker was definitely &quot;Subzero&quot;. The picture quality of this DVD, by the way, is poor.
B00000G6KG|5.0|all has been said on this album. This the ultimate pure thrash album of all time. All the extreme bands (death and black metal) say that this is their greatest influence. This album is written without nuances and compromise. Slayer goes ahead directely at the essential things: aggression, speed and brutality. <BR>angel Of Death is one of the greatest metal song ever written with Master Of Puppets of Metallica.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Limp Bizkit's ridiculously titled &quot;Chocolate Starfish &amp; Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; is exactly what it calls itself: a piece of a chocolate starfish that has puckered itself too tightly.  The album's overall performance, which remains extremely inferior to their sophomore release &quot;Significant Other&quot;, is disappointing and seems to be driven by their immense success of their previous album -- while completely ignoring the quality of the music.<br />&quot;Hot Dog&quot;, an awful rip of Nine Inch Nail's &quot;Closer&quot;, is an opening track that praises their own band's success while trying to sound hard at the same time.  Bragging about the amount of f**ks they use during the song along with an outlandish sense of trying to sound comprehensible deteriorates Limp Bizkit's original image of being unique.<br />Other tracks including &quot;Full Nelson&quot; and &quot;Boiler Room&quot; just shows that the band threw together what they could as quickly as possible -- leaving most fans slightly annoyed with the band's new make-up.  While &quot;Rollin'&quot; is both catchy and entertaining, the rest of the album seems like egotistical rambling that becomes just plain annoying by the fourth track.<br />Limp Bizkit, brilliant in their &quot;Significant Other&quot; album, has released a weak and boring album that, unfortunately, does not catch the essence that Limp Bizkit had on their previous albums: a band that successfully combines rap with hard rock.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have to say that incubus has outdone themselves with this album. I guess being in a secluded cabin in california will do that to you, huh? Not many words can describe how wonderful this entire album is. I definitely would like to give props to song number 11 &quot;Are You In&quot;. I fell in love with this song the moment it came on. Once again, congrats guys, I'm definitely anxious for the up and coming!
B00000JCB2|4.0|Limp Bizkit has successfully crushed the barrier of the &quot;sophomore slump&quot;, releasing an album that is not only superior to their freshman outing, &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'All&quot;, but far more unique and mind-blowing.<br />The opening track, the catchy and jumping &quot;Just Like This&quot; is amazing mix of hard rock and rap.  Entertaining as that is also &quot;Nookie&quot; and the anger-driven &quot;Break Stuff&quot; -- which realisitcally relates to anyone who's been angered before.<br />One of the album's true highlights includes &quot;Nobody Like You&quot;, a incredible collaboration with Korn's Jonathan Davis that is just as awesome as it is eerie.  &quot;No Sex&quot; remains one of the album's stayholds in Fred's writing abilities.  <br />Along with these, another strong highlight of the album is &quot;N 2 Gether Now&quot;, a catchy song featuring Method Man and &quot;Re-Arranged&quot;, a soothing, slower song that allows for a little bit of kick back.<br />A true testament to the collaboration of hard rock and rap, &quot;Significant Other&quot; remains the authority in this music form.  Truly recommended for those who enjoy to bang their heads and hear great music at the same time.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Being an extremely large fan of Incubus I bought this album the day it was released. All I can say is WOW! They have evolved and matured so much as a band it's amazing. Make Yourself (their previous album) was full of introspective and thought provoking lyrics... this CD takes all that to the next level, or perhaps the one above that! Here's a song review... it's only my opinion but maybe it will help you.<BR>1. Nice To Know You - a &quot;so long, I am not happy you are going but I'll let you go anyway&quot; sort of song. It has the same sort of &quot;hold on to your hat&quot; intro to it that &quot;Privilage&quot; does on Make Yourself... all in all a great opener. Track 2, Circles is ok, it has a good sound to it, a really good &quot;jump around&quot; song. 3. Wish You Were Here is an amazing song. It is quickly becoming my new favourite song, the lyrics are full of angst but romance (if that is possible) 4. Just a Phase is one of those songs that gets someone hooked on a band after hearing a &quot;radio song&quot; by that band. It starts out soft but by the end Brandon Boyd is screaming... amazing song. 5. 11am is really cool, this is a good example of how Incubus has evolved as a band. It is a soft song with a good beat and Mike Einzeinger's talent for playing guitar really shines through on this track. 6. Blood on the Ground is one of the hardest tracks on the album. It sounds as if it evolved from one of the bands jam sessions. Very nice. 7. Mexico is absolutely amazing! It's one of those songs that makes you want to cry, fall asleep, hug someone, and laugh all at the same time. It is probably the most mellow song this band has ever done, and it shows what a diverse sound Incubus has. 8. The lyrics in Warning might as well be carpe diem, sieze the day. This song is about living life to the full, the music siezes you too. 9. For some reason I want to compare Echo with the song Stellar from Make Yourself. Both the sound and the lyrics are remenisent of Stellar,which is very good, a beautiful song. 10. Have You Ever sees Incubus going back to the sound of S.C.I.E.N.C.E. but with more of an edge. Passionate screaming lyrics and powerful guitars make this a very cool song and a great contrast to Mexico. 11. I don't understand the track Are You In? But I like it. Dirk's bass is cool and there's some backing vocals that are female I think! Hmmmmm.... An interesting song. 12. I personally think that Under My Umbrella would have made a better opening track to this CD because it is so great. It lulls you into a false sense of security during the middle, then comes back to smack you with the chorus again! 13. The final track, Aqueous Transmissions, sounds like Far Eastern folk music. It makes for an interesting finale to an amzing record but a calming one, which I think was the idea. To make it even better... it ends with a sample of the very loud frogs outside the house where this album was recorded. I read an interview with the band about a month ago and they mentioned the possibility of this... well, they did it and it sounds great. To conclude, this is definately Incubus' finest work to date. I can't wait to hear more from the guys.
0792844890|5.0|Mel Brooks isn't considered by all to be the funniest man alive.  In many ways he annoys me.  But this movie is a Jem even to those that can't stand Brooks.  Rick is hillarious, Pullman couldn't have done a better job, (which isn't saying it's great, but he does shine in the role.)  To top it off, the late John Candy is priceless.<BR>   There are moments in the movie where laughter are not present but they are few and far between.  This is hands down one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and if you have not seen it, you should.  Owning the DVD is even better because of the special features.  Mel Brooks commentary, while at times boring and monotonous, really help the viewer to get even more into this wonderful movie.<BR>   If you could see one movie your whole life, I'd probably say see Titanic, or something grand, but if you watch a lot of movies, and you're looking for a funny favorite, this is it.
B00005QIPH|3.0|The Strokes have served up an entertaining, tightly produced album here.  It's very cool to hear a band playing stripped down rock and roll these days, especially when popular music &amp; hip hop seems to be moving more and more into the uber-production realm.  There's a real earnestness about the songs on this album, and that's an element that's been missing from conventional rock for a while.<br />The problem, if it is a problem, is that the Strokes seem to have made very little effort to transcend their influences.  I like arguing with my friends about whether sounds more like the Ramones or the Velvet Underground when it's a challenge to figure it out.  But when whole riffs have been lifted out of songs and placed into others and presented as new it's a little troublesome and can get irritating.  (If you don't believe me, listen to a few Pixies CDs before you listen to this one.)<br />Luckily there's enough charm in the album that these annoyances can be overlooked with some effort; and it'll be cool to see what they do with their next album, because there's a ton of potential here.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I could say that I have been an Incubus fan for a long time but that would be lieing. However, I probably know as much about the band as anyone who _has_ been listening to them since the start. When I first heard them on the radio (drive) I thought this band is just another regular band that will quickly fade away. Little did I know that they had a nice history already and had more to offer then what you hear on the mainstream radio. So quickly I went and got all kinds of Incubus. From Fungus Amongus all the way up to Make Yourself and When Incubus Attacks Vol. 1. They literally do not have a single song I don't think is bad at all. 99.9% of all the songs they have I consider from good to increadible. When I heard the new cd, I was not shocked that they once again have gotton softer, yet more mature. At first I didn't really like the cd at all I was just so dissapointed. I almost gave up on it but on closer listening and repeated play I have to say this is just as solid and good as any of their other cds AND while it may be 'selling out' or whatever you think, I think its great that they are expanding musically. I just wish that they would have done a more S.C.I.E.N.C.E. style cd or Enjoy Incubus/Fungus Amongus but whatever. Give this cd a good long listen at least a couple times through and if your open minded musically I think you'll agree with me that this cd is infact a great accomplishment for Incubus once again. Take it from an Incubus fan =)
0451169514|5.0|A huge, hulking book. Sort of intimidating to look at, but it's worth every second you spend reading it. Lots of scary things, humor from characters that you grew up with, and an ultimately satisfying conclusion. I'll always remember the names of the seven kids who come back to fight the evil after they grow up, and i'll always remember the villain as well. I mean, who hasn't been scared of clowns at some point in their life? This is the book that introduced me to horror fiction, to reading for fun in general. Thank you, Mr. King.
B00005N83M|5.0|I really like this site.I think it is so cool how you let us listen to samples of our favorite music. &quot;Ja Lo&quot; Is my favorite singer.I love her and her new song &quot;I'm Real&quot;
B00004Y6O9|4.0|This is by far the most popular VH cd, next to 1984, and I quite agree. My all time favorite VH song, &quot;Little Dreamer&quot; is on this one. I didn't catch on to this record until 1982, five years after it was released, but it is a must for all VH fans. I never did like &quot;Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love&quot;, and still can not understand its popularity. Also, whenever eruption is played in the radio, it was ALWAYS followed by &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, just like Led Zeppelin's &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Livin' Lovin' Maid&quot;, another thing I don't quite understand. Runnin' with the Devil is a great opening song, and the intro, for those who don't know, is slowed down car horns. On Fire, the most energetic song on this CD, was the opener for the 1981 Fair Warning Tour and at times, on the 1984 tour.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is multilayered musically and so intelligent &amp; sweet lyrically that you can't help but be impressed,chalk up another out of this world album for a band that never ceases to amaze !!If you loved &quot;S.C.I.E.NC.E&quot; and &quot;Make Yourself&quot; as much as me you'll definately enjoy this album.
B00004Y6OA|3.0|This record represents a radical departure for VH, as I think that this was the first record containing songs that were written AFTER they got signed. &quot;Take Your Whiskey Home&quot;, &quot;Fools&quot;, and &quot;Simple Rhyme&quot; are great, and they were written before the band got signed. The newer songs, &quot;Everybody Wants Some&quot;, &quot;Tora Tora&quot;, &quot;Loss Of Control&quot;, &quot;Could This Be Magic&quot; are not my favorites of this record. I would not recommend this one to the new VH fan, or a VH fan who comes from the Hagar era, but as a hardcore Halen fan, I love this one.
B00003CXTG|4.0|It's a great movie, lots of action, although it could have been about half-hour short. The attack scene is amazing, as well are the scenes of the battle of England, but the romantic stuff is just plain dumb! The end of the movie is ridiculous. But all in all, it's a very good title, and th action scenes make it far better than that other romantic-sacharine movie... what was the title? Oh yes, Titanic!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This is my favorite VH cd, and it was the first one I bought in 1982. I got this one first due to &quot;Unchained&quot;, and twenty years later, I am not tired of that song. The original VH videos debuted on MTV in 1982 come from this record. &quot;So This Is Love&quot; got a lot of airplay, &quot;Unchained&quot; got moderate airplay, and &quot;Hear About It Later&quot; was shown every once in a while. This record is GREAT, and all of the songs were newly written for this record. This record is heavy, with Mean Street and Dirty Movies, which far surpass &quot;Spank&quot;, and all of that other garbage with Hagar. This is a MUST for all VH fans, and I would recommend this one first. To me, this record should be rated as their best, followed by VHI and 1984.
B00005MP58|5.0|I don't know why but this is cheaper than other versions.  I can only guess it is the &quot;wide-screen&quot; thing.  So what, once you get to watching it you don't notice the black line at the top and bottom.  Heck, for the price difference it is a steal!!!!!<BR>I adore Colin Firth and am really enjoying owning this wonderful DVD.  <BR>If you need a good laugh, watch this.  The mother of these 5 maiden girls is a hoot.  I love her.  She's a scream.  And, the cousin, Mr. Collins, he is so-o-o-o-o funny.  I love this movie!<BR>Buy it....... you won't be disappointed!!!!
B00005B4GU|3.0|The only reason I give this album as much as 3 stars is because there is still a hint of the genius that comes from the Kid A album. This album contains songs from the Kid A sessions. Songs that didn't make the cut, so to speak, and it shows. Whereas Kid A has a manic symmetry to it, this album sounds thrown together with the leftovers of yesterday's fantastic meal. I guess I shouldn't be too hard on the band. I look at this album in the same vein as U2's album, &quot;Zooropa&quot; (a far superior album on all counts - that's a review within a review, folks!) which was slapped together while U2 were on tour. So, unless you're prone to night-sweats from not having every album produced by your favorite band, leave this one alone.
B00005NWRS|4.0|You really have to wonder about these &quot;reviewers&quot; who give this CD one star.  They must be very cynical, unhappy people, who get their kicks putting things down.  I guess they're trying to show us how &quot;cool&quot; they are, when, in reality, their reviews only serve to make them look stupid. This CD has a great, fresh sound and has some absolutely terrific cuts -- &quot;New York, New York,&quot; &quot;Somehow, Someday,&quot; &quot;Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; -- to name a few. It deserves all the praise that it has received.
B00003CXXR|3.0|Jurassic park was a big hit. It was an awesome movie. The second movie was alright and I liked it. Then this new one came out. It was bad. It wasn't even directed by Steven. The movie was the length of a B movie. 80 minutes. Thats how long CARNOSAUR is. (Another dinosaur movie) The acting wasn't too good except for Sam Neil. I heard that the producers are thinking about makeing another one. Jurassic park 4!!!!!!!. I hope the next one is good. But this movie is still worth buying and the special effects were awesome.
6305627401|5.0|I LOVE IT!!! Wow this has got to be one of the funniest movies ever produced. I mean, you can watch it 50 times in a row and still laugh at all the jokes. Your sides will be hurting after this one. This gets da seal.<br />-FM
B00003CX5P|3.0|George Lucas is hard to figure. <br />Examples of George's senility: the Gungan leader, Anakin's flying hook-nosed slave lord, Yoda, the Trade Federation baddies, and of course Jar Jar (who's so far out ahead in first place that he almost makes everything else moot).<br />Examples of George's brilliance: the visual effects on the whole (the feeling of expanse, whether in space, on Coruscant, out in the open, underwater...it's all breathtaking), the fight scenes and choreography (absolutely spectacular), the action scenes (pod race, space battle, etc.).<br />And unfortunately, this trend isn't entirely new to this movie...if you watch the originals again, you'll see that senility gradually creeping up, starting with the Mos Eisly aliens in IV and culminating with the Ewoks in VI.  I wish Mr. Lucas would just recognize what works...he has 4 of these babies under his belt already.  But no, even in the face of as large an outcry as could exist against Jar Jar, he's still insistent on including the character in the next film.  I hope it's for good reason considering what a detrimental effect the character had on this film...if Jar Jar isn't a pivotal part of the upcoming plot, then his inclusion will be practically the equivalent of George flipping off his fans.  Anyway, lose the attempts at cutest aliens, and give the visual effects team and choreographers a raise, and we're three-quarters there.  Have I mentioned how jaw-dropping the saber fight scenes are?  (I hope Ray Park can be given more Star Wars work...his athletic talents add immeasurably to those scenes!)<br />On the subject of the DVD, it does have some of the highest quality on the market...both the presentation and the sheer value of the extras is incredible, especially for such an amazingly reasonable price.  I'm not much one for extras in general, but the ones on this disc (like the deleted scenes...incredible!) make a very strong argument.  A sincere bow to the Lucasfilm for the value it offers fans withthis DVD.<br />Here's to hoping Episode 2 (my potential favorite of them all, synopsis-wise) finally meet's this franchise's incredibly high potential.
B00005OAJ1|2.0|Okay folks, I've listened to the cd a couple of times, and there's a reason that the cd has already dropped off the Billboard 100.  Its funny, yes, but its not music.  The songs, while mildly amusing, have no endearing qualities, except maybe &quot;F... her Gently&quot; and the radio single &quot;Wonderboy&quot;.  The comedic sketches seem forced and silly, and the satanic undertone as well as the ridiculous satanic artwork will keep this band from ever being taken seriously.  Jack Black is very funny in the movies, but I hope his idea of Tenacious D., aka &quot;Two Jerkoffs With Guitars&quot; is a short lived one.<br />If you're looking for serious acoustic musicianship, check out &quot;Live at Luther College&quot; by Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds.  I guarentee it will be more useful in your cd player than Tenacious D, which should be used as a beer coaster or frisbee.
B00000255O|5.0|once again herbie gave up the funk in ways only he knew how, my favorites are bubbles, and sun touch this was funk-jazz-fusion at it's best, props to all the headhunters, the solos are incredible, the vibes, beats, melodies rock-herbie was light years ahead of his time, all jill scott, erykah badu, and maxwell fans should check out thrust, manchild, sextant, and headhunters to learn where those aryists and many more got their funk from.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus gets better and better with every album. Every track on 'Morning View' has its own unique sound, and while this album is reminiscent of 'Make Yourself', it creates a mood of its very own, refusing to be an exact replica of the band's previous releases. Standout tracks include the soft radio hit &quot;i Wish You Were Here&quot;, as well as others, my personal favorites being &quot;Are You In?&quot;, &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;,&quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Circles&quot;. Brandon Boyd's vocals soar, as always, and all the band's signature sounds are represented, from smooth acoustic guitars to more modern 'Scrathlactica'-esque sounds. The lyrics are meaningful, but not too cryptic for the average person to interpret them. I give it three thumbs up!!!
B00005QGAV|5.0|read the title it says it all.
1558216847|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, struggling along with Rawicz on his journey -in the comfort of my armchair, cozy and safe at home.  That is, until I read about his sighting Yeti towards the end, and then I groaned, &quot;Oh no, why did he have to put this in?&quot;, which is why I took away one star.  Of course some of the story must be distorted because it wasn't until years later that it was written and some of it must have had details aimed at selling thrown in, but I was really glad I read it, in contrast to some books I regret having wasted time on.
1587880490|5.0|This is one of the few books I've ever read that I'd recommend to absolutely anyone. It's touching, interesting, thought-provoking, inspirational, and easy-to-read. If you don't laugh, and you don't cry, and you don't find yourself appreciating your life after reading this book, then I'd entreat the three ghosts of Christmas to come pay you a visit.
B000001E18|4.0|When this first came out, I used to watch that famous video music channel with the three letters...ya guessed it.  When they used to play the video for the song &quot;Stay...(far away, so close), the song, and the vampire images of Bono, touched my soul.  He makes a great believable caped night stalker too.  For me, this one track IS the CD.  &quot;Lemon&quot; is a good track, the title cut too, but &quot;Stay&quot; is such an incredibly sensual, deep, melodic love song.  I can keep listening to it.  The refrain is so lovely at the end it brings tears and touches the heart.The only U2 song that rivals this wonderful cut, is also a love song with a refrain that touches the heart with it's beauty called &quot;Walk On&quot; on U2s latest CD.  On my review of &quot;All That You Can't Leave Behind,&quot; you can see more.  If you don't own &quot;Zooropa,&quot; you should.  &quot;Stay&quot; is a song any fan of U2 must possess!
1587990717|5.0|Now that was an entertaining read.  Mr. Taleb is clearly one sharp cookie - what I found pleasantly surprising was his display of a razor-sharp wit to boot.  How refreshing it was to finally read a book from a trader who can understand the difference between good decisions and good outcomes in the investment decision making process.  I would highly recommend this book - particularly to any investors who were fortunate enough to have made money during the Internet craze and who are  dazzled by their own investment prowess.
6304773382|5.0|This is a movie you either like or don't. I find it fast-moving, colorful, loads of fun, and entertainingly bizzare. It's not something to think about too much, and it drags toward the end, but it is a cult favorite for a reason. Great soundtrack, too.
B00003IQQA|5.0|I bought this album for &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;.  Before I even knew the words to this song, I was deeply touched by the emotion expressed in this song.  Then I bought it, and I saw the lyrics, and I realized that WAWO communicated with me on a feeling level first, then on an intellectual level (after I saw the words).  The first album by Creed I bought was &quot;My Own Prison&quot; for &quot;Torn&quot;.  It didn't take me long to fall in love with the whole album.  I was interested in &quot;Human Clay&quot;, but I didn't think that I would like &quot;Human Clay&quot; better than &quot;My Own Prison&quot;, but I do!  &quot;Human Clay&quot; is a terrific album -- and I would definately recommend getting the Import, for the bonus track &quot;Young Grow Old&quot;.  It is worth the extra money!
B000002BMV|5.0|Could Journey Escape be the best album from the 80's? An album in the true sense of the word, with great songs, energy and Steve Perry's unmatched vocals.  I have owned this as an album, cassette, CD and now remastered CD.  Its a piece of music that can be listened to again and again, truly capturing the feeling of the Summer of 1981.
1573225517|5.0|Rob Fleming is in his thirties and the owner of an obscure music shop with 2 nerdy employees somewhere in north London. When his girlfriend Laura leaves him for the neighbour upstairs he looks back on his life, and especially on (the endings of) his relationships: what did he want from the relationships, when and why did things go wrong, how did or didn't he react. When Laura and Rob get back together, we follow the re-start of their relationship.<br />The book is terribly funny, but also terribly recognizable. I bet most people of Rob's age will recognize at least part of Rob's behaviour as being very similar to how they react in such situations. Thus the book also works as a mirror that leads the readers to reflect on their own way to cope with one of the most important aspects of life: the way in which they interact with other people.
B000002GF8|5.0|Why is this the best album of the 80's?  Sting's lyrics.  Intelligent, funny and timeless.  Responsible for writing the words and music to almost the entire Police catalogue, Sting writes with an intelligence and humor that isnt compromised by time.
B00004ST9Q|4.0|I too originally owned a copy of the DVD that stops on track 14. I repurchased another one and they now include the videos Exhale Shoop Shoop and I Believe In You and Me but they are not listed and the back cover. The listing of the videos is also no longer in the order listed, maybe fans complained and they added these two!

B000002B7S|5.0|Thisis my favorite ozzy album Diary of a madman is just behind. The first for songs are so damn good on this album. Jake E. Lee had big shoes to fill and he filled them pretty good. I love this album buy it.OZZY ROCKS<br />MEGADETH IS THE BEST BAND IN THE WORLD. CHECK OUT THERE ALBUMS.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Morning View was released. I ran down to the local cd store and bought me a copy. At first i was dissapointed, felt a little let down and again very disappointed. I heard it as Make Yourself Mach 2.<br />A couple of listens later i gave the lyrics a read along with the music. I found that the cd was definately a &quot;grower&quot;, but it was also lyrically better than Make Yourself. Although, SCIENCE is my favorite Incubus album i feel as though musically Morning View is superior. The best example of this is Just A Phase which is a brilliant song.<br />The lyrics follow the same type of message to oneanother, it seems as though someone has affected Mr Boyd emotionally at the writing of the album as through every song he refers to you. His lyrics really hit home and this album is his lyrical best as the emotion really hits home.<br />This album reminds me of Silverchair's Neon Ballroom. Best tracks are Nice To Know You, Just A Phase, 11AM and Under My Umbrella.
B00003CXWV|4.0|This was a good movie showing a small part of the history of the drug trade in America. I was expecting more action, i.e. shoot outs, ext. Even without the action I thought this movie was still very enjoyable.
B00005QG9J|5.0|While I love all of the last 3 Incubus CD's including Morning View, each CD has been original and different from the previous CD. Morning View is no exception, and overall it is slower and more relaxing than the previous CD's. Yet, there is a lot of variety within the CD itself. The CD has it's rock out songs like Blood on the Ground, Circles, Have You Ever, and Under My Umbrella. It has it's unusual, mostly instrumental songs like Just a Phase, Are You In, and Aqueous Transmission. It has it's laid back songs in 11 AM and Mexico. And it has it's eventual hit singles in I Wish You Were Here, Nice to Know You, Warning, and Echo. Overall, the CD has something for everyone, and fans who have followed Incubus for a long time should love it. Even the uninitiated should pick up this CD, it is outstanding.
B0000026WD|5.0|THis is the CD to have. No more wishing for the old Michael. Now I have him forever, perfect on the round gold disk.
B0000009SM|5.0|Discovering this Cd was a wonderful day indeed! This was my intro to the zappa camp and I must say, I can't wait to continue. Beleive me, if I had more money, I would buy so. . . .much. . . more! Po-jama people is my favorite song, it relates to my everyday life. So many boring people follow me around, it's just a perfect fit. I am also a big fan of Evelyn, a Modified Dog. I can reflect how great intelligence hides within an unlikely place, and the ability to express is limited. I call all zapsters to buy this A.S.A.P.!
B00003CXXS|5.0|First off, I love the whole JURASSIC PARK trilogy. But JP3 is definitely gotta be my favorite. My second favorite is probably the first, which is a classic. This one will surely be a classic, too and definitely one of the best films of the year. Yes, the plot is pretty predictable and the film is way too short (it would've been nice if it had been longer), but we don't care about a huge dramatic storyline and plot and intelligent diolouge when seeing JURASSIC PARK 3...we're here to see cool dinosaurs, awesome special effects, and the humans running for their lives! Now THAT'S action! And sure, not many people die in this film, but then again, not many people died in the first JURASSIC PARK, either - especially not the main characters! We all know the plot of JP3, so I guess I don't have to really go into much detail on it. Even though the DVD isn't out yet, I can already tell it's gonna have some totally cool special features on it. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely superb. My favorite character in this film? Eric Kerby - Trevor Morgan is an amazingly talented young actor! I think his part is the most exciting part, too. The filmmaking is unique. The graphics and special effects look totally realistic and awesome that it's scary! The film keeps your interest throught the entire time and if you fall asleep during it, then you must not enjoy action and adventure films all that much 'cause this is the best action and adventure film you're gonna get ever! I loved JP3 and I'm definitely planning on buying it when it comes out on DVD...hopefully by then I'll be getting my laptop computer for college! :-)
B00003CXXS|1.0|When Steven Spielberg's 'Jurassic Park', which I have not seen, opened in 1993 it was one of those films that was an instant blockbuster. Like 'Rush Hour 2' and 'Shrek'. Four years later Steven got up the courage to direct 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park', otherwise known simply as 'Jurassic Park 2'. What I meant by when I said &quot;got up the courage&quot; I meant he was taking a chance with the critics, if they were going to like it or if they were going to hate it. They hated it and so did I. 'Jurassic Park 2' is like Best Picture up against 'Jurassic Park 3', the worst film of the summer and probably the worst film of the year, but I haven't seen 'Planet of the Apes' yet. The acting was beyond the grave of sadness, the film's setting was next to nonexistent, and to top it off, what mother in their right mind would let their son go parachutting on a forbidden island? Get real hollywood!
6305003882|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is definitely not my favorite actor of all time. Yes, I am a teenager, and yes, I'll admit I was madly in love with him when TITANIC came out but not so much anymore. Now I just respect him as a good actor. I saw THE BASKETBALL DIARIES on Broadcast TV a few years ago so I really don't remember the entire film and probably didn't see the actual whole film because I am sure parts of it were edited out. But from what I remember, this is an excellent film. Yes, not many people know who Jim Carroll is, but that's not really the point of this whole film. The point of this whole film was a teenager who got addicted to drugs and what happened to him. The main character could have been anybody, really. There are lots of young teenagers and kids out there who are addicted to drugs and this is the kind of thing that can happen to them. I think that is what director Scott Kalvert was trying to show the world...not a story about Jim Carroll, but a story on how drugs can affect your life and everyone else in it. The entire cast of THE BASKETBALL DIARIES is absolutely superb, especially DiCaprio (who stars as the young Jim Carroll), Mark Walhberg, and Lorraine Bracco. The filmming is excellent, and the story and plot are unique and amazing. I love THE BASKETBALL DIARIES and strongly recommend it to everybody...and I can't wait to see Leonardo DiCaprio hit the big screen again this winter in GANGS OF NEW YORK! :-)
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus has done it again!  One of the most mature rock bands somehow appeals to all age groups.  This album is not only enjoyable but very atmospheric as well.  Anyone who has listened to any incubus song in the past knows very well the emotion and power behind this band.  Songs like Echo, Warning and Morning View are extremely well done and somewhat of a throwback to many older and legendary bands.  Wish You Were Here is simply a great song and all of thier tunes have a special lasting effect, ( as you may already know considering the popularity of the last Incubus album).  You can not go wrong with any album from this group and this album will be played years later with the same effect that Pearl Jam / Ten and Dave Matthews / Crash has.

B00003CX5P|5.0|It's unfortunate that the reviews for the DVD of TPM are included with the reviews of the movie itself.  So much new material has been included on the DVD, it's practically a different product from the VHS version.  The television ads aren't lying when they say this baby is the &quot;new standard in DVDs&quot;.  <br />I've reviewed a lot of DVDs specifically on their extra content and never have I seen one where every feature was so compelling.  Lucas is a master at slightly retooling his works every few years to drain every bit of money he can out of his loyal fans, but this time he gives his audience a full meal which augers well for the DVD release of the other films in the series. <br />Most obviously, there's the filmmakers' commentary.  Like the movie itself, there's almost too much information happening at once to catch it all on the first viewing.  If you have any interest at all in the filmmaking process, you'll find yourself rewinding over scenes to hear everything that's said.  In some ways, it could be argued that the commentaries of all the participants should've been separated out into more than one track.  The most obvious choice would've been to have a director's/editor's/producer's track distinct from the producer's track, but that's a very small quibble indeed.   There are very few who won't think the track given is compelling and, in some cases, actually plot-amplifying.<br />But it's really disc two that provides the most content.  You'll spend a good five or six hours mining for treasure, here.  <br />Some of the material is familiar to those who followed the development of the film for years on starwars.com.  There, a series of web documentaries were created at various stages of the film's progress to keep people interested.  Now, they comprise a nifty historical record.  Tackling the film from every angle, they give you in-depth understanding of the various challenges posed by lightsaber battles, costuming, visual design and casting.  For those of us who followed the development of the movie regularly on starwars.com, there's not a great deal which is new here.  But even if you logged on to starwars.com every day, you'll be glad to have this collection offline. <br />Likewise, the trailers and tone poems are things fans will have seen many times over, but they're rendered here in more splendid quality than is available on the web.  Particularly significant in this section is the music video for &quot;Duel of Fates&quot;.  While this has long been permanently available on starwars.com, it received little bandwidth priority there.  Oddly, this was only available in a very small size with unimpressive audio.  Here, it's preserved better than I remember it on MTV.   Instead of just being an exercise in directorial creativity, it neatly edits together scenes from the creation of the movie and the film itself,.  It's worth pointing out that the collection of television spots is by no means exhaustive.  But the most significant ones are here, especially the emotionally effective tone poems.<br />Still, the one thing that fans and non-fans will want the most from disc two is the hour-long documentary.  Without narration, it provides raw video from various phases in the production.  You see many relatively unguarded moments which range from those that help you understand the enormity of the filmmaking task,  to those which give you a new appreciation for the bits of the film that annoyed many viewers.  You will definitely start to see this film as a beginning of a larger tale, not as merely a film unto itself, and this will doubtless increase your appreciation for it.  Indeed, what this excellent documentary does best is to capture the struggle of making this film, which, despite having the famous first trilogy as a point of reference, was every bit as revolutionary as, say, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARVES.  More than that, though, you'll see the very human side of the filmmakers as they go through moments of daunting frustration yet miraculously never seem to lose their innate enthusiasm for their craft.  It is reason enough to buy this DVD. <br />What most hard-core fans will buy this DVD for, though, is first access to the trailer for Episode II.  Through online links, DVD owners are given first crack at the upcoming feature on a special site that will, apparently, be constantly updated until the release of ATTACK OF THE CLONES.  If you care about getting the very latest official information from LucasFilm, you're going to need this DVD.<br />Unfortunately, this opportunity is not available to Macintosh users.  Indeed, it painfully points out the only failing of this DVD. The special features are not Macintosh-friendly.  No Mac user can get to the special DVD web site.  And many are reporting problems even mounting disc two.  This DVD, too, contains a large number of &quot;Easter Eggs&quot; (hidden, coded features), almost none of which are accessible on a Mac. If you can only watch this DVD on a Mac, I suggest you go to macfixit.com for full reports on steps you may have to take to get the most out of this purchase.  It's ironic that there are such problems for Macs, since Macs were used extensively in the production of the film itself.<br />That aside, there's not much to complain about with this DVD.  LucasFilm has done right by its fans and its critics, giving even casual viewers plenty of cause to revisit that galaxy far, far away.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|If you need a film with great acting, a stimulating and smart script and a plot line that you won't sleep through, look no furthur than this noir thriller. The film opens on a brutal image. A photograph of a grisly murder that slowly begins to fade. The photograph slides back into the camera. The flash goes off. The blood slowly begins to disappear from the walls. And the murdered victim rises to his feet. The stage is set for a tense, dramatic and emotional thriller that tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by an excellent and pretty fine if I do say so Guy Pearce) in reverse. Leonard is searching. He is looking for somebody in particular, the man who raped and murdered his wife. But the only problem is that Leonard suffers from short term memory loss, causing him to forget things that happened minutes before. To remember things, he keeps notes and tattoos important information on his body. With ten minute footage intermixed with a black and white shot subplot, the film takes you on a ride full of twists and turns. You know what the effect is, you know what the present is, but what was the cause? As the film begins to unfold, the story begins to reshape. We meet Teddy (Joe Pantalino? is that right?), a cop who may or may not be on Leonard's side. We also meet a waitress named Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who may have alterior motives for helping Leonard. The ending left me astounded and wondering what exactly happened the night his wife was killed and what kind of guy is Leonard. I won't give away the ending, but trust me, it wraps it up (excuse me)starts it up nicely. 'Memento' is truly a great picture, why don't more movies like this get seen or even made? It is definately one that will keep you on the edge of your seat and wondering along with Leonard.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A movie told in reverse.  Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man with a medical condition that makes him incapable of making long term memories.  All Leonard remembers is someone raped and murdered his wife and he's out for revenge.  With the words &quot;Remember Sammy Jenkins&quot; home-tattoed to his hand, Leonard searches for the killer.  The continuous story unfolds in broken scenes in reverse order, pieced together by Leonard's tattoe reminders and polaroid notes, giving you a sense of what Leonard Shelby must experience.
B00004XMV6|5.0|I can't think of a more sublimely stylized film prior to 1986 depicting the nature of sexual obsession since &quot;Last Tango in Paris&quot;. Set in the decadent eighties with Rourke and Basinger at their (erotic) prime, and with brilliant New York City cinematography as the backdrop, this materialistically lush film is probably half the reason men have opted for careers on Wall Street, own lofts in SoHo, and keep a backup supply of ice cubes in their SubZero freezers. And to think this was filmed 15 years ago...
0782006809|4.0|This is another take on the old theme of the wealthy, sophisticated playboy pursuing the inexperienced but virtuous girl from out of town. Cary Grant and Doris Day are fine in the leads, while Audrey Meadows gets the funniest lines as Day's roommate. Calling it a &quot;bit of fluff&quot; is dismissing it too readily. It's witty and well-done and was very successful when it was released. It does wear a bit thin before its over, though. Attitudes are considerably more relaxed than they were in the early 1960's, and Day's extended waffling and bouts of guilt in the face of Grant's persistent attempt at seduction seem a trifle silly, now. It's still a quality effort and a good period piece, though, and there are some pretty funny moments. As romantic comedy, it's above average, even today. You could do a lot worse.
B00003CXP1|5.0|An awe-inspiring journey into the human abyss.  All the leads are fantastic, giving powerful, energetic performances.  Aronofsky gives this film a depressing, haunting and beautiful feel, with unconventional lighting and camera angles.  His direction is flawless and puts the audience in the actors' shoes.  To date, this is my favourite film, every aspect of this film is fantastic.  I love this film but it is not for the faint of heart , the visuals are shocking and the story is extremely depressing.<BR>(Unrated) contains explicit sexual content, gore, intense situations, DRUG USE, violence, and profanity. I know that sounds like a lot but the editing is so quick that half the time you don't really know how much you actually saw.<br />Matt
0393312836|5.0|I loved the way that a book like A Clockwork Orange, by Anthony Burgess, can make the reader feel bad for the villain. It is the story of a fifteen-year-old boy named Alex, who maims, rapes and robs people for recreation. He doesn't really think much of it, just as we don't think much of killing a fly. Well one night, he and his droogs (gang friends) go to a house to rob it, and Alex ends up killing the lady and then is betrayed by his droogs and brought in by the police. He then goes under a new scientific procedure that will make him good again... One of my favorite quotes from the book pretty much sums it up: \\"Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" (p. 95). <br />I thought this book was eye opening. It really debates whether it is better to choose, for better or worse, or to let people tell you what to do. It also shows how desensitized people get after being exposed to so much violence. At first it is hard to understand, with all of Alex's slang (hands are \\"rookers,\\" guys are \\"malchiks,\\" and the aforementioned droogs). But as one gets more into the book, one picks up on the slang, and it is a great language that Burgess writes in.
B00005RHGK|5.0|With the amount of horrendously cheap horror films being spewed out by studios, it's very refreshing to see a horror film with such a brave attitude.  I have noticed an extreme lack of heart put into horror films over the past while but this film brings back hope, Victor Salva used his heart to make this film.  He uses old cliches but doesn't exploit them as much as the new teeny bopper horror films.  Furthermore, he uses an excellent amount of tragedy (not too much, not too little) by the end of the film, I really felt for these siblings.  Most reviewers pick at a couple of things such as; the old women with the cats, the psychic and the lack of carnage in the police station.  I loved every one of these elements, to me, they added a richness to the film instead of bringing it down.  The ending is now one of my favs from any horror film, it's shocking, darring, and intelligent.  The cinematography is also exquisite.  This is a horror movie with a punch, it does have gore but it's not over-used (beheading, amputations, ripped out heart, ect.).<...
B000007T2Z|5.0|wow.<br />i just now recovered from half an hour of mind [numb]ing.. administered by my headphones.. which feel like they're still tightly clasped around my ears..<br />yet they're not.<BR>i'm left enlightened, confused, and blank. <BR>it was beautiful, chaotic, disturbing, frightening. and also very hard to write a review for. clarity and chaos thrown in a dark blender and made into a nice disc. i can't begin to come close to scratching the surface of ..        go buy that album.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A masterpeice.  This is the best film I've seen for 2001.  Powerful and chilling, with an excellent performance by Guy Peirce.  The DVD is lacking, but the movie itself is worth the price and then some.  The ending is fantastic but you have to look into the film to understand the deep meaning behind it.  This is a powerful film about human psychology.  Oh yeah, there is no big plot hole as many reviewers say (you'll understand after you see it)<br />Matt

0694013013|5.0|From Head to Toe is my 2 year old grandson's favorite book.  The child interacts with the reading of the book and it reinforces confidence in the child with the expression, &quot;I Can Do It&quot;!!  The illustrations are also fabulous!! Adults enjoy this book almost as much as children.  It is not a &quot;long-winded&quot; book, so it holds a small child's interest quite easily.  GREAT BOOK!!!
B00005N919|5.0|Excellent transfer both in picture and sound.  The added scene adds something to miss Stone WOW...
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album is Jackson's best ever.  This version is a must have, particulary because we get to her Rod Temperton, who wrote the three best songs on the album, &quot;Off the Wall&quot;, &quot;Burn This Disco Out&quot;, and the commercial hit &quot;Rock With You&quot;.  He is the best writer Michael Jackson ever had, and I wish Michael still will call him.  I must say the demo of &quot;Don't Stop Till You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Working Day and Night&quot; is great to hear Janet and Randy helping in the background with soda cans.  Besides hearing Temperton and his pen written songs, McCartney's &quot;Girlfriend&quot; always shines in its R&amp;B groove,  thanks to the great production of Quincy Jones, a man we also hear speaking on the album.  A masterpiece album this is.  The only flaw: we still never get the original cover with Michael and his afro in front of the wall.  However, still  &quot;DJ's spin the sounds!&quot;  Thanks for reading.
B00005N919|5.0|Excellent transfer both in picture and sound.  The added scene adds something to miss Stone WOW...
1577311523|3.0|There are a lot of helpful insights in this work of tolle. But although he says he was not affected from any other particular teachings, I have strongly felt the effects of J.Krishnamurti in almost most parts of the book. The concepts such as 'observer and the observed', 'the thinker', 'pure observation of thought' was used by Krishnamurti before. I felt like he was interpreting what Krishnamurti said.I would be quite astonished if he really was not affected by Krishnamurti as he says. So I would recommend the readers of Tolle to read Krishnamurti if they have not meet him till now. I think that is the origin of all these other teachings. I think tolle had difficulty to understand what krishnamurti meant when he said 'the self' or 'the me' was totally illusionary. Having difficulty to understand this,some have created the concept of 'higher self' just like Tolle did as far as I observed.And we must always keep in our mind that it is so easy to go into an illusion created by the mind. So finally I have seen some helpfull insights in this book but I strongly recommend the origin which is krishnamurti's teachings. Tolle have published another book which is about the practice of living in the now and practising meditation. I did not even find it worth for reading since I know it as a fact that 'there is no method no practice of meditation and there is absolutely no guru who will teach methods of meditation in the search of truth since 'truth is a pathless land' as krishnamurti says.' I would recommend to all to stay away from those who say they have methods for enlightment.
6302256615|4.0|Reeves once again show his diversity as he goes up against veteran actor Swayze.  His (Reeves) keeps getting better and better, which some movie critics hate to admit...their lost.<BR>A movie worth watching over..especially with the junk that is on television for the fall 2001 season!
0790744295|5.0|George Romero's Creepshow is one of my very favorite horror films. Five (!!) horror stories are presented in Creepshow, as tales in the horror comic of the same name. The centerpiece of the film, however, is the fourth story, The Crate (also the longest story, at thirty-eight minutes), about a man who feeds his evil wife to a big monster in a crate. The stories are all great fun (Stephen King's turn as Jordy Verrill provides a very humorous tale), and filled with chills and thrills. My personal favorite is the last story, They're Creeping Up On You, which is truly stomach-turning. Those afraid of bugs will be uneasy for a week after seeing this one. <br />The DVD is part of Warner's budget line ((dollar amount) at most places), so don't expect a whole lot. You get a great, very entertaining horror movie and that's about it. No extras except for a theatrical trailer. The sound is Dolby Surround, and sounds quite good. The image quality is quite good for a film that's 20 years old. It's bright and colorful, with little noticeable shimmering. The picture does have a slight jitter, as a previous reviewer noted, but it's not terribly noticeable. I found that it was more noticeable on the full screen side than on the widescreen, but widescreen is the one you should be watching anyway. This is far from the worst transfer I've ever seen. It's too bad that Warner couldn't have put a little more effort into the DVD, but still it's great to have this great horror flick in digital format.
B00000K2SD|5.0|What a script!  Reeves is superb in Neo in this film.  I rate him as Oscar material but alas..those dupes cannot see past their faces.  The movie is fast paced and sci-fi stuff is wonderful.  I can not wait till its sequel is out.  This is truly Reeves best film as of 2001.
0743216458|5.0|The accounts of the 101 Airborne are truly moving.  A wonderful perspective on the experience of US soldier in WWII.  Forget the startegies and what general did what and where, these are real ordinary men who did extraordinary things.  I highly recomend it to anyone who would like to just for a second mentaly experince WWII through the brave men of Company E.  Eloqently written, interesting and exciting.  And best of all real.
6303257844|5.0|One of Reeves's best movie prior to &quot;The Devil's Advocate.&quot;  Sandra Bullock and Reeves appear to have a chemistry going much like Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracey.  Too bad they have not teamed up again.  Overall, this movie is worth buying.
B00003CX5P|5.0|(...)awesomely done and finally the sound quality is decent. (...) There are a few added scenes, one in particular i didn't like during the pod race and felt it should have stayed out, but others were pretty good. I liked the added features and hope George doesn't take forever on releasing Episodes IV-VI on DVD.
080017948X|5.0|This film compares in several ways with &quot;Chocolat.&quot;  Both films are rated five stars not because they are big budget or because they are magnificent to look at or because of the soundtrack or because they represent the unfolding of an epic.  They are great because they are eminently successful in the most important area: MAGIC!  &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; starts off looking very much like it might be at most one of those typical three star comedies -- but it slowly takes off and the acceleration increases throughout the film. At its conclusion I was about two feet off the ground.  The story could have gone off in any number of directions but Ramis has taken it in the BEST direction: hope, fulfillment, inspiration.  In a quite subtle way the film elaborates metaphorically on a Zen theme of &quot;the eternal present.&quot; High philosophy indicates that our lives are actually structured in a way that is remarkably similar to the Murray character's experience: we cycle and re-cycle through the days of our lives (and probably life-times), having multiple opportunities to &quot;get it right.&quot;  As Murray finally notices, the mundane surface of our existence is actually replete with irrepressible and fantastic possibilities.  People will be watching this film in large numbers for decades to come. And Murray and McDowell are simply wonderful.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Well here it is, new packaging, same classic film. This film has got to be in one of the best trilogies ever made, i mean, its all classic stuff, horror, comedy, and an unbeatable performance by Bruce Campbell. This DVD is definantly one to have, i have enjoyed this film many times over, and its still good after all the times i've viewed it. All of the extra's on this edition are the same as the Director's cut, which this is what this is, but it is almost impossible to find the original anymore, if you do, the price is pretty steep. Anyway's back to the DVD, any fan of this series should own this edition, it is a must for a collector, and any one who missed out on the first directors cut, i like the original ending better, seemed somewhat like what you would have expected ash to do. So what are you waiting for, go out and get this DVD now.....
B0000042GM|5.0|Brahms solo piano music is not performed very often. These recordings illustrate why- not only is technique of the highest order required, but  total musicianship must be of the highest order as well. There are few pianists who accomplish this- and Katchen certainly does. The tonal quality, phrasing, &quot;breathing&quot;, etc. is sublime.
B00005JK1C|5.0|This movie is a &quot;thinkers's&quot; movie.  I've seen it 8 times.  If you like movies with unexpected turns, you'll love this movie.
B00005NZBN|5.0|Oxymoronally, This CD is as fresh as newly mown hay but steeped in the very foundations of American music.Critics locked in the time warp of Dyan's [still excellent]former glories may be nonplussed but please play the new tracks a few times and open your senses to Dylan's awakened creative genious. The lyrics are now wry and mischievous the music at once bluesy, then 40's revisited, then rock, rockabilly, its really all here.I was born the same year as Dylan, and it seems as if he always captures my moods. This CD is up there with his best and his voice has simply mellowed like  good wine. You must have this one for the collection, bonus tracks,Augie Meyers on keyboards and all!In these troubled times that we share, this music is food  for the soul.
B00005OAIE|2.0|I think Louis Armstrong was the person that said that there are two kinds of music- 'good music and bad music'.  Well, John Mayer seems to have created a new kind of music- 'hollow'.  This guy needs to sit at the feet of real musicians if he wants to have a career in music. I hope John does not end up on the ever growing scrap heap of pop stars because he does have potential.  However, this album is premature.  Hopefully, John Mayer will someday look back on this album and be able to say &quot;Oh God, what was I thinking&quot;.
B00005Q5WC|5.0|When all of Bob Marley and the Wailers island albums were rereleased except Exodus I knew there was a reason.  It's all quite simple now since the Deluxe edition hss been released.  For starters on the first disc you get the 10 songs from the original album which are great, and have been reviewed tima and time again.  Time acutally called it the album of the Century.  But then you get the bonus tracks.  &quot;Roots&quot; is a really good song, the alternate version of &quot;Waiting in Vain&quot; is better than the original in my opinion, and as far as the other versions of &quot;Jamming&quot; any true reggae fan loves a good dub so that's killer, as is the dub of &quot;Exodus&quot;<br />Then we get to the live section which i think has better versions of songs than &quot;Babylon By Bus&quot;, which has always been my personal favorite album.  &quot;War/No More Trouble&quot;, &quot;Jamming&quot;, and &quot;Exodus&quot; are just simply phenominal.  <br />Next is the &quot;Punky Reggae Party&quot; with the dub version, finally a way to get the original studio version of this song, which until now was very hard to do.  Also there's the &quot;Keep On Moving&quot; which has always been a great song.  <br />I consider this to be the best reissue of all the BMW material thus far this year, though &quot;Burnin'&quot; and &quot;Catch a Fire (2CD) were also really good.  I just wish now all the original Jamacian versions of BMW Island albums would be released.  It's just amazing how many of these albums are sold, despite the fact that Bob Marley passed away nearly 20 years ago.  <br />Buy this double disc set and be happy!!!! :)
B00005O3VC|4.0|the dvd is amazing, but for some reason the subtitles keep re-appearing in every chapter, no matter how many times i switch them off!!!  has anyone else experienced this, and if so, is there away around it (aside from turning the subtitles off every 90 seconds, or watching the movie with them the whole time)??!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I don't even know where to begin ... this album has touched me on so many different levels ... this, in my opinion, is Incubus' finest effort to date. The album flows seamlessly, from one great track to the next ... some of my favorite tracks being &quot;Nice to Know You&quot;, &quot;11am&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, and &quot;Just a Phase&quot; ... but it's hard to pick favorites when they are all so good. Once again Incubus combines great songwriting, soulful lyrics, DJ work in all the right places, and SOUL. Great job guys, keep up the good work!
B00005QG9J|4.0|The new Incubus CD &quot;Morning View&quot; is a great album. If you're a fan of &quot;Make Yourself&quot; you'll definitely love this one too. Even fans of S.C.I.E.N.C.E and earlier Incubus will probably like &quot;Morning View&quot; too. This album doesn't have a lot of their earlier funk sound, but it's still great nonetheless. I bought this CD yesterday when it came out and I've already listened to it a couple times through, it keeps getting better. All the songs are good, but I really reccommend 11am, Are You In, Wish You Were Here, &amp; Warning. <BR>  Definitely check out this CD - you won't be disappointed!
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you like S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and the more rappy, 311-ish style of Incubus, you might not like this one as much.  If you dug /Make Yourself/ (the album) but could do without Battlestar Scratchlactica, you'll probably like this one.  It's a little more &quot;poppy,&quot; but not really.  It's also almost more &quot;metal-ish&quot; in some respects.  They get a lot more harmonic and lay down some thick chords on this one, compared to some of their older stuff.  However, they still SOUND LIKE INCUBUS, which is great.  :)  <br />    Wish You Were Here is wonderful, meaningful, and an all-around cool song.  The last track, Aqueous Transmission, is VERY odd, but also VERY soothing and interesting to hear.  Has a Japanese/Chinese sound to it.  Cool work.  My personal favorite is Circles (track 2).  They rock really hard and make me want to get up and dance around, but they lay down some great backups behind Brandon and it just sounds great.<br />    Unless you're really a hardcore metal/rap style of fan, you'll probably like this album.  If you like pop-ish music, this might be an Incubus album you'll enjoy.  Personally, I think it's their best yet and it hasn't left my player since I got it.<br />To quote Brandon himself:<br />    The easiest thing in the world would be to repeat the same equations that worked for us in the past, but with repetition would come demise. We needed to start fresh and rewire our transmitters. And in doing so, we wrote what is in my opinion our best record yet.<br />    I hope that some who listen to it agree. I am aware that many will not, for stratospheric string orchestrations, Disney-esque, trip-hop escapades, lyrics about contentment under a full moon, and not a shred of rap in our metal usually spells trouble for a rock band with aspirations of success. But if two of you out there enjoy it as much as we enjoyed creating it, I will feel like we accomplished worlds. And for those who don't like it, you can bite me.<BR>--<br />Scratch one off his list of two - Incubus is 50% from accomplishing worlds!
6303942830|5.0|Stunning film work, musical score that flows with the emotion of the movie. One of the best re-makes ever made. I cant wait to get a dvd and see it again.
0395645662|5.0|I thought &quot;The Giver&quot; by Lois Lowry was a good book. It's about a place where there is no pain, joy, or any other feelings and your whole life in decided for you.  There is a boy named Jonas that gets chosen at the age of 12 to be the receiver of all the memories.  But when he receives the memories he decides he doesn't like it and doesn't want to live there anymore.  So he tries to find a way to escape into the real world but it's never been done before where he lives.
B000002TQV|5.0|The best CD I have ever owned.  It defined a period in my life and continues to take be back everytime I listen to it.  Perfect to listen to after a night of heavy drinking.
044022425X|5.0|This comment is really based on the four books so far.  In my opinion it is one of the best series to date.  The content takes you back into differnt times and just by closing your eyes you are there.  The writing is terrific!  Jamie &amp; Claire are memorable.  These books will have you laughing and crying, sitting on the edge of your seat and cozy warm. When I finished this particular book, there was a great span of time before I could get interested in another book.  <BR>Keep up the good work Diana, and I look forward to &quot;The Firey Cross&quot; as soon as it is available.
0812550757|5.0|This is The best book I have ever read and I thought was better than Ender's game.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|I watched Shrek on the plane to Los Angeles from Philly with United. I have a tendency to buy DVD after watching the film first. Now I decide to buy it because it's so funny.
B000002X2B|5.0|This has been one of my favorite albums since it first came out. It's a science fiction story. It's anti-war. It's anti-establishment. It's a story of heartfelt yearning. It's incredibly melodic. It has Jack Casady, but not Jorma although it has Jorma's brother Peter on guitar. It has unbelievable artwork (on the vinyl version, perhaps the best argument against the CD format). It's a masterpiece. It belongs in your collection.
B000002B30|3.0|Admittedly, the Boss is one hard guy to compile.  For one thing, Bruce's hit singles barely touch the surface of what he's all about (it doesn't help that the majority of these songs are found on Born in the U.S.A.).  On the other had, the casual fan doesn't want &quot;Growing Up&quot; or &quot;Candy's Room&quot; over &quot;Glory Days&quot; and &quot;I'm On Fire&quot;.  Which is why it would've made sense to release this as a double-disc set.<br />Instead, Springsteen has given us a single-disc &quot;greatest hits&quot; package that's a bit schitzoid.  He gives the die-hards their share with &quot;Badlands&quot; and &quot;Thunder Road&quot;.  For the mainstream base, Bruce adds on a few &quot;U.S.A.&quot; tunes and &quot;Streets of Philadelphia&quot;.  To please himself, &quot;Atlantic City&quot; and &quot;Better Days&quot; crop up.  What this amounts to is a rather awkward listen.  Because he has tried to please everybody, he has satisfied no one.  There aren't enough legitimate hits for the AM-crowd, and the die-hard tracks are almost teasers for what should've been a more comprehesive listen.  The tracks are fine, of course, but they lose a bit of their luster outside of their parent albums.  To sum it up, the casual fan is better off with &quot;U.S.A.&quot; and the die-hards will just have to wait for the inevitable box set.
014028009X|5.0|what a great book.  it's a pretty quick read, ideal for vacation or before bed, and you'll want<br />to finish it sooner rather than later.<br />bridget has such a distinctive voice, one that i really identified with, and the narrative really<br />IS laugh-out-loud funny.  sometimes you wish bridget would suck it up and behave<br />properly, but what fun would that be, anyway...and if she was very proper the reader would<br />miss out on phrases such as &quot;pretending Perpetua was a Mexican cheeseplant,&quot; etc.<br />any woman who has made it into her late 20s or 30s without being married, becoming a<br />mother, holding down a fabulously successful job, making scads of money and living a<br />glamourous lifestyle will find something in the book that speaks to her.
6305827079|5.0|I first saw this recently as the movie (large screen, dolby stereo) and it was awesome.  So, I HAD to have the video, the CD and all.  I think this is arguably the best filmed performance of Elvis Presley's concerts when he was simply at his best.  He is lean, mean and super fit and singing superbly.  It didn't come much better than this!!<br />By the 1972 Tour (video) you can see more of everything, the weight, longer hair, sideburns, more rhinestones on the costumes.  The tide was turning in his life.  If you see this concert first, you'll know you have seen the best.  But if you're an Elvis fan the others will all be great because Elvis was great...., but this WAS the best.  (PS It is hard to look at this and know he was dead 7 years later, what really struck me was what a tragic shame it all was.....)  ENJOY!!
B000001ES9|5.0|Rush's debut in 1974.  What a loud adrenalin rush it was.  Most people that know and like Rush do not consider this beautiful piece of work.  They are Neil Peart this and Neil Peart that.  I am in no way insulting Dr. Peart, he stands as one of my favorite drummers, but to down Geddy Lee's songwriting skills is wrong.  He did write awesome.  So what if the topics are not extravagantly chosen.  1974 was about loud music with simple lyrics.  This album is my second favorite by them.  2112 just happens to be the most interesting concept for me to listen to.  Ihave always enjoyed every song on their debut.  Working Man is still a popular radio song, but Before and After is the signature track on this production.
B000021Y7X|5.0|A fantastic way to see a fantastic movie. I still remember the first time I saw this film, and I was just glued to the screen. David Byrne's on-stage behaviour really makes the whole thing, and the big suit looks bigger than ever in widescreen. The live version of Psycho Killer has to be one of the best performances ever.
B00003CX5P|2.0|This has to be the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. The plot is nearly non-existent, and the character development is even worse (for instance, Darth Maul is a central character, but there is no explanation of who he is; rather, he just shows up every once in a while for a fight scene or to simply look mean, imposing, and powerful).I prefer streetbrawls.com that has the real action. The effects are great, but in the absence of a storyline they become almost annoying. If it weren't for the fact that this is a Star Wars movie (which gave me hope that it would get better), I would have walked out of the theater after the first 30 minutes
B000050XEI|5.0|This CD is the best.  I had never even heard of Enya until I heard her hit &quot;Only Time&quot; on the radio.  Then I just had to have her CD.  &quot;Only Time&quot; is only one of the great songs on this cd-#2, 6, and 10 are equally wonderful.  This CD is relaxing, and will put you in a great mood.
B000002GYG|5.0|Like those that have gone before me, I love this CD. It takes pride of place in not only my collection, but my Tom Waits CD's. We get to see not only the musical legend Tom Waits, but the witty, eclectic and grizzled Tom Waits.<br />Tom Waits says that listening to his old songs is like looking back at High School photos when you had big ears. Well, I guess I love those ears.<br />If you have ANY interest in Tom Waits - and you must otherwise you wouldn't bother reading this - get a hold of this CD so you can cherish it.<br />Recommendation: any time you are driving home late at night or have switched off the lights in your apartment and sitting in the dark - listen to this CD.
0425166805|5.0|The 1960s and the 1970s produced an alarming amount of attention on &quot;unsolved mysteries&quot; such as the Yeti, the Bermuda Triangle, the lines on the Nazca plains, as well as UFOs.  Tons of books and documentaries and TV shows focused heavily on this though many seemed just a little trite.  Enter Erich Von Daniken...<br />I was only 12 when I read this and was able to understand much of it with help from my Webster Concise Dictionary.  Today, reading this new edition with a new forward from the author is just as mind opening when I first read my old used tattered paperback.  I still think people dismiss the author's intentions to put a light on a theory that we are the result of a union between advanced aliens and primative man.  I believe the intention was to take a back step from what is normally understood about creation and discovery.  The evidence which Erich places before you should not be dismissed so easily either.  CHARIOTS OF THE GODS really makes you THINK about how a primative race might carve images which resemble spacemen.  Is this why when man thinks of God...we look up to the sky?<br />I HIGHLY recomend this book to anyone who wants to see what might have happened in Earth's early years.
6304383177|5.0|Who wouldn't love Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in one of the best and funniest movies of all time?
B000053VAF|1.0|&quot;Dogma&quot; is about a total moron who spouts off, and everyone else shaking their head at him in a benign way. I'm not making that up. Also, if you're doing a satire, never have a cutesy apology appear before the movie starts. Jonathan Swift or Terry Southern never did that. You either believe in your vision, or you don't. Smith's problem is he wants to have things both ways. He's supposedly educating us on religion, and making us laugh with bathroom humor. Except he ends up doing neither. The religous stuff is just preaching to the converted, there's nothing insightful about what he's saying. And the humor is painfully forced, unfunny, and over the top vulgar. Don't get me wrong, I love lowbrow humor as much as anyone. But this movie is basically for anyone who still gets a kick out of hearing themselves or other people curse. It reminded me of a &quot;Scooby Doo&quot; episode written by a pretentious hack philosophy student. Damon and Affleck's lame performances exemplify the movie's smug, pleased with it itself tone. They seem more interested in entertaining themselves than the audience. And you have to be really untalented to make George Carlin and Chris Rock not funny.
B00000ING2|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I thought it was OK, amusing, but not as good as I expected, but each subsequent time I have seen it I have enjoyed it more and more.  The humour is bizarre, the plot is crazy and I think essentially idiotic, but as with Raising Arizona or O' Brother Where Art Thou or any of their comedies, that really isn't relevant - what makes these movies hilarious is the strange characters, their bizarre behaviour and insane interraction.  I recommend hiring before buying, and if you don't like it?  Give it at least one more chance.
0451169514|5.0|Stephen King wirtes an incredible story with this book.<br />If you really like the horror, has a taste for the writing style of King, and wants a book that you couldn´t any tima, this one it´s a MUST HAVE.<br />All my friends read it, and give the same opinion... when you turn off the lights, you´re thinking if PEnnywise could be near you...<br />For me, really a top 3 in King´s novels, only beated by The Shining and Cujo, but it´s only in type of reading... if you really like pure terror, you´ll love the ending... creepy, hard to read.
B00005ARDC|5.0|I had heard a couple of songs but have never heard of this band before. Checked the reviews here to see what others had to say. They were right, this is a great disc. Red Eyes and Tears is<BR>my favorite cut, but they're all good. No duds.<br />Buy this disc!
B000000WA4|5.0|This cd is the greatest piece of work from the 90's alt-rock scene. Every song has that &quot;thing&quot; that makes you want to listen to every single musical detail. I first heard of the Pumpkins when Siamese Dream came out I was 8. In 1995 when I was 10, I was vacuuming my parents room and had MTV on. Then &quot;Bullet with Butterfly Wings&quot; came on. I knew that I had to get Mellon Collie. The CD is just perfect. I don't think I could live without this CD!!!!!
B00005QIPH|3.0|As the great Flavor Flav once said, &quot;Don't believe the hype!&quot; The album simply doesn't merit the press it has received. I think critics have been swooning over the band members' cute names (Fab!) and pretty faces and in the process have become blind to the fact that the music isn't groundbreaking. Evidently being a rock band from NYC qualifies a band for immediate Velvet Underground status. Actually, I'm being more harsh than I wanted to be. This album has a playful aggressiveness that has been sorely lacking in contemporary rock music. It has a dirty raw sound that my ears have been yearning to hear after being overwhelmed with shimmering pop music. It really does have some good qualities. But I get frustrated when critics, none of whom are willing to go out on a limb, throw all their energies behind undeserving bands while there are great bands out there that receive little or no press. For example, I think Sloan is one of the greatest bands making music now. If you're thinking about buying The Strokes, buy Sloan's Navy Blues instead.
B000003S5H|4.0|Okay. I went to france last summer, and got Air's &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; instrumental album. I was totally wowed. The music flowed with the awesome movie...anyway, I thought about buying another Air album. I picked up Moon Safari because it had &quot;Ce Matin La&quot; which is also on the Various Artists Virgin Suicides sountrack. Once I played this cd for the first time, I knew it was going to get played again and again in my cd player. This cd is so wonderful!!!! Even my Limp Bizkit-DMX loving 14 yr old brother loves this cd!! His favorites are &quot;Sexy Boy&quot;, &quot;Remember&quot; and &quot;Talisman&quot; . I love every song on this cd. <BR>Also, if you buy this, you might reconize &quot;Talisman&quot; because its from the movie GO and &quot;Sexy Boy&quot; because I've heard it in a teenie movie...can't remember which crappy flick it was...
B000001E3L|5.0|This is not a cd for the casual music listener. <BR>Van Morrison &quot;live&quot; is about a journey. He wants to take you up and then bring you back down, often times using meditative music and vocals to accomplish it. <BR>ANISF brings it all together to showcase all of Van's talents, as well as the talents of musicians he has been inspired by. Junior Wells, John Lee Hooker, Jimmie Witherspoon, Brian Kennedy, Georgie Fame, and even his daugher Shana are all featured on this cd and are given ample time to showcase their talents. Candy Dulpher is the perfect compliment to Van on sax and has some blistering solos as well.<BR>ANISF will likely not jump out at you as a great listen the first time around. There is so much going on on stage with so many musicians and singers it can be a little intimidating or confusing at first. But after a few listens you can feel where the music is going and where Van wants to take you. Ultimately, the cd builds to &quot;I'll take care of you/It's a Man's, Man's, Man's World&quot; on disc 2, which clocks in at a spellbinding 16 minutes. By the time the cd closes with &quot;Shakin all over/Gloria&quot; you've come full circle and can't wait to see the man live.<BR>So if it's only Van you are seeking, pull out Moondance or Astral Weeks. But if you are ready to take a journey through soul, blues, jazz, and much more put on ANISF. You will not be disappointed.
B0000046JP|4.0|(...) Now that I've heard virtually the entire CD, I can say that it's OK. Paco's playing of the Aranjuez Adagio falls a bit short of John Williams' performance with the Seville Orchestra. On the other hand, Paco's performance of both the Allegro con Spirito and the Allegro Gentile are most enjoyable, with the bright, rhythmic, and percussive flamenco sound working really well for the two allegro movements.  The tempo of those two movements is also a little faster than most other performances; this really adds to the excitement.  Furthermore, the accompanying performance by The Orquesta de Cadaques is very energetic. I found the rest of the CD's compositions (Triana, El Albaicin, and El Puerto) much less enthralling but decent enough. After all, Rodrigo's Aranjuez is really a tough act to follow.  Summing up, I give the two allegro movements of Aranjuez a five-star rating and the rest of the CD a three-star rating.
B00000255X|3.0|Of all Dylan's albums, this one had the most immediate appeal for me: the vocals are good, Scarlet's violin is fantastic, and the story-songs are interesting.  When I look back at it though, I find that it is one of his albums I listen to the least, and it took me some time to reason out why.  I think it would have to be the impersonality of the album.  Dylan has a somewhat irking habit of covering up a confessional album with a superficial album: Love &amp; Theft followed Time Out of Mind, Nashville Skyline followed John Wesley Harding, and Desire followed Blood on the Tracks.  For all their virtues, these latter albums have been substantially theatrical in nature, emphasizing style and story over intimacy.  On Desire, Dylan is doing a dance of five veils: Emmylou Harris (a backup vocalist who often drowns him out), Scarlet Riveria's violin, Jacque Levy as co-lyricist, a huger back-up band than he'd ever used, and the Rolling Thunder revue complete with white face make-up.  Some of these are pretty veils (Riveria) and some are not (I find Harris' singing appallingly bad throughout the record).  They are veils nonetheless, used in Dylan's Jokerman/Song-and-Danceman fashion.  It is easy to see how this led him into the Vegas/Neil Diamond showmanship of Street Legal (check out that back cover photo!), diva-ish back-up girls, and the 3+ hour vanity film Reynaldo and Clara.  This is what I don't like about the album.  It was the beginning of a decline that didn't even begin to look up till Dylan recorded Blind Willie McTell--a very personal song.<br />That said, there are some very great tracks here: Black Diamond Bay (a wonderful, clever story, and always underrated in the Dylan catalogue), Isis, Hurricane, Sara, and (kind of) One More Cup of Coffee.  Joey is OK, but just about the weakest of Dylan's very long songs: Desolation Row, Sad-Eyed Lady, Lily Rosemary &amp; the Jack of Hearts, and (at least I would argue) Highlands are all way better.  It sure is better thanBrownville Girl, though.
B000059XUY|5.0|This Disney release is a joy - especially considering the poor film-only DVD releases of late on Region 2 format. <br />Oliver and Company has been given a quality treatment and the DVD boasts the new technology with an animated menu and sound (not just a static picture). From the menu you can choose your various options including the well-endowed Bonus Features section.<br />The Bonus Features are fitting and plentiful including a lovely animated short (cartoon) called `Puss Café' from Disney's Golden Age. The 14 page extensive gallery with conceptual art, character development and layouts makes for good viewing and is a rare peak in to the wonderful making of the film progress which is also documented in an ample featurette.<br />In addition to these features Disney have also included a short featurette on the theatrical re-release of the film as well as a featurette on the animation of Disney animals throughout Disney history - a gem of a bonus on this disc.<br />In true Disney style, as on R1 DVD releases, the DVD also has two Sing Along features.<br />The presentation, detail and consideration that has gone in to this DVD release sets a high standard for the new wave of UK DVDs from Disney. The included documentaries feature interviews with Bette Midler and Billy Joel et al. and are padded with interesting information which fans will welcome. <br />This film is a historic one for Disney - just note the trial of CGI and rebirth of Disney magic under the omniscient eye of Roy Disney in his foundation attempts to regain dwindling love for the House of Mouse.<br />A winning feature with no flaws - and many paws.
B00005OAJ1|4.0|...if you weren't already a fan of the d before you heard it, i doubt you'd be converted.  for some of their truly inspired stuff, i recommemd you download a few tracks recorded by fans from their live shows.
B00000F5KH|5.0|Central Station was definitely the best brazilian movie I have ever seen in my life.  <BR>It seems to me that part of the jury who decided which film should win the best foreign film oscar the year it was nominated for the award, didnt really understand that the movie was related to a very significant period of the brazilian history, which was the mass migration of Northeasterns to the south-East brazilian cities during the seventies and eighties.<BR>Despite the excellent job done by Walter Salles ( filmmaker ) as well as Fernanda Montenegro and the nine-year-old Vinicios de Oliveira, the very emotional and also sometimes very sad movie unfortunately was not clear enought to the world that it was not just a beautiful storie of a lady ( Dora ) who was returning a poor boy ( Josue ) to his father, but that it was describing part of the real life of hundreds of brazilian Northeasterns that moved to the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo to escape from their extremely poor and dry homeland called SERTAO.<BR>The modesty of Fernanda Montenegros role was definitely the highlight of the whole movie, which in my opinion was much more &quot;down to earth&quot; than Life is Beautiful or even Shakespeare in Love.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I felt that Morning View is the kind of album that grows on you the more you listen to it. When I first listened MV I didn't know quite what to make of it. It sounds much different than their previous albums. I listened to it a couple times, reading the lyrics as I went. The songs are very deep in an emotional way. The new rhythms and melodies are excellent and I like it more everytime I listen to it. If you like Incubus you'll like this CD.
B00005LMWI|4.0|Nowadays it is very hard to find any new metal groups that sound anything like the great metal leaders of the past, such as Iron Maiden, Priest, old Metallica, and other groups of this calibur. I just heard of Kamelot about a week ago by reading some reviews in amazon, so I decided to give some of their sound clips and mp3s a listen. Let me just say, Kamelot sounds great. The lead singer, Khan, has a great voice and basically carries most of the songs with his beautiful voice alone. I also like how they added classical instruments in many of their songs. It makes their sound even more diverse and powerful. The only little complaint I have is that they do have very repetative choruses, which are great but they can get a bit tiresome. I found the same problem with Maidens latest album, A Brave New World, which was a great album but like Karma had very catchy, yet repetative choruses. Overall, this is a great album that will have any metal fan head banging and playing their best air guitar, while singing along with the melodic vocals. My favorite songs are Forever, The Spell, and Wings of Despair(even though its a little too repetative for me). My advice is buy this album now, and write a review later saying how right I was about the greatness of this album.
B00005QG9J|5.0|INCUBUS IS THE BEST BAND TO EVER AND THIS CD IS REALLLLLYYY GOOD CD
B00005O3VC|5.0|Where could I start but just saying that this is the most intelligent movie ever written. Seriously, wait, nothing in this movie is serious. First off it contains the king of all comedy sequences, the almighty &quot;Black Knight&quot; sequence. We also get to learn about King Arthur's crusade, how to tell if someone is a witch, to beware of &quot;killer rabbit's&quot;, how to deal with knights who say Nee, how to correctly answer questions to get across the bridge of peril, and how to get arrested while storming a castle. Not only funny, but essential for human survival. The extra stuff is most excellent. Michael Palin and Terry Jones go to the film sites and buy their own script at one castle and revisit the bridge of peril. We even get Lego Knights, and its a funny as it sounds. Extra stuff is just gravy. Really, if you don't have this one, you really deserve to have no movies at all.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Morning View is definitely an excellent recording, but to me, it's not quite as good as their earlier stuff. Incubus has kept their weird, original sound, but used in an overall softer context. It kind of sounds like it at first, but no, they did not sell out, which I worried they might do after Drive became a hit on pop radio. A few listens and it's clear that their sound is totally different from anything else out, including their past efforts. If you liked Make Yourself, you should like this one. All in all, Morning View is just the next evolution of Incubus from Fungus Amongus to SCIENCE to Make Yourself and onward. The differeces between Make Yourself and Morning View are pretty much the same differences as between SCIENCE and Make Yourself. You'll understand when you hear it.
B00005ABIP|5.0|Cake has good ingredients: excellent musicianship, witty lyrics, adventurous music, intriguing musical styles, and unusual instruments for a rock context. Cake is never like meat and potatoes. I especially like the great Gen-X poetry--ironic, cynical, slyly amused, not overly earnest, cool, and aloof.<br />Satan is My Motor is a jokey song with the singer singing about his motor--probably lust despite superficial evidence that he's a nice guy. Mexico is probably about dating a Latino and it features wonderful pedal steel. Never There is a danceable song about a game-playing female. Guitar is a fantasy song about throwing a guitar out a window high up in a building. You Turn the Screws sounds like a song about an unethical record company mogul and his lust for money and how the musician feels himself getting sucked into the corruption. The breezy Walk on By is about breaking up an affair. Sheep Go To Heaven uses trumpets again deftly and has the great line which sums up my sentiments exactly about downtown party zones: &quot;I don't want to go to Sunset Strip, I don't want to feel the emptiness, gold marques with stupid band names, I don't want to go sunset strip.&quot; <br />When You Sleep (Where Do You Fingers go?) is a dreamy, fanciful song. Hem of your Garmet is another uneasy love affair song in which the lover feels evil and unworthy of her. Alpha Beta Parking Lot is probably about being feeling abandoned and alienated. Let Me Go is another Hold On Loosely love song. Cool Blue Reason is a crime drama. Where Would I Be is an exotic sounding finale. <br />Throughout the bass and guitar work together well with creative riffs and musical lines. John McCrea vocals are a bit deadpan and don't have much range, but like Lou Reed's voice, you can't help but listen--his voice seems to match the mood of the lyrics well.
B000003S5H|5.0|this is a fantastic CD, some tunes are borderline cheesy (or over the border sometimes !) but everything on the album is great... Enjoy it !!
B000002H70|5.0|Disintegration is an album characterized by long, epic, and very dark songs, which come straight out of the soul of the band.<br />-Plainsong: Opening a very dark epic of great proportions.<br />-Pictures of You: contains some elements you'd later hear again in 'High' (like the opening chimes sound). If you have only the heard the short 3+ minutes version from the Hits album, you'll find yourself discovering lots of things in this 7:28 minutes version.<br />-Lullaby: a classic, achieving almost baby-like sounds with the guitar.<br />-Fascination Street: fasctinating bass...<br />-Prayers For Rain: powerful, penetrating.<br />-Same Deep Waters as You: perfect for a rainy afternoon, over 9 minutes in length, rain/thunders in the background...<br />Overall, a musical masterpiece.
B00000J6AG|5.0|If I would have to name top 10 songs list, about 5 of them would be in this CD. I like techno-like music which happens to be almost all the time very annoying when listened too much. Moby is something else because of his original style putting peaceful samples in tracks. Like Porcelain isn't actually quite usual for any genre of music. Overall: Best album ever and it's long, too! Not any 40 minute 10 track album but 18 tracks and length over an hour. It's unfair to hope better album from him, but I still hope that his next would be even better (if possible)
B00004ZD69|5.0|This double-CD &quot;only&quot; contains four tracks, but what a piece of work!!! All the songs exceed eighteen minutes in duration. You can begin guessing now... Think King Crimson, think Radiohead, think Sigur Ros, think BJork, think wild... then think godspeed you black emperor! This is as progresive as music gets for a while. These Canadian guys are way at the forefront of music creation, where some bands will eventually arrive at some point in the next few years.<br />Disc: 1<br />1) Storm: progresively takes you through curtains and curtains of sound as the band travels through reeds, wind pipes, and guitars, driven by a drums marching down... until it seems to simply die of exhaustion, to be picked up!<br />2) Static: the song builds from conversations with a static sound evolving into a pizzicatto of strings that grows more and more mysterious...<br />Disc: 2<br />1) Antennas To Heaven: the guitars in this song are more than hipnotizing. So are the synth choirs. They're both so beautiful that they will stir up your soul, and maybe, just maybe, make you cry, if you let them.<br />2) Sleep: can the name of a piece be any more ironic? I mean... if I sleep to it, I might actually be having a nightmare, but the matter of the fact is that this 23-minute-piece is simply brilliant, sheer genius... This is not an easy piece to listen to, but it's brilliant: the gradually growing pain coming out of it almost becomes unbearable as distorted shrieking guitars built up by the percussion lead to a state of &quot;all tension and no release, merely dissipation and noise&quot; (no way to put it in better words than how pitchforkmedia.com did)... and then comes the peace... like a plateau where you sit for several minutes to give your heart and soul some rest, throught some very melodic and pleasant chords. The last song is the best song of the album and the best overall musical work I've heard in a long time.
B00005QG9J|5.0|If you like S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself you will love Morning View.  It is their best effort to date and an album that should take Incubus to the upper eschelon of music where they belong.  The best tracks on here are Are You In, Warning, Echo, and the bizarre Aqueos Transmission....but unlike most albums their isn't a bad song on the whole cd.  If you only buy one cd this year...buy this!!!  It's really that good and then some.
B000053VAF|1.0|Excrement monsters? Crude discussions about anal intercourse? The genetic-based divinity of Christ? Racist Aostles? This film goes WAY over the line in slamming catholic theology in terms that should have earned it a NC-17 rating. I was deeply offended, and I'm not even christian, let alone catholic. Frankly, I can't even give you some examples of the dialogue without turning this into an N-17 review, which incidently is how the movie itself should have been rated.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have recently seen.<br />While the start is a bit slow, the prelude to the mission helps us understand the characters a little bit more deeply. Once the boys are out on the boat, action, suspense, and drama all work in great balance. Some of the overdone war boat movie plot twists are evident--dying in the engine room, an escaped prisoner eliminating his guard, and so on. Those scenes are subtly executed and well-acted, so they feel comfortable rather than tedious.<br />Jon Bon Jovi and ER's Dr. Melucci both put in surprisingly dynamic performances.<br />While the plot resolution is a little bit hard to believe, it does the subject matter justice. War itself is hard to believe, and the heroes who fought for us are of incredible mettle.<br />The picture is outstanding. There are lots of dark and gloomy submarine scenes, but they're very vivid with great contrast. The sound is to die for; the DTS soundtrack just smashes all the battle and explosive sounds, and the great mixing and production effort doesn't mask dialog or ambience. This is my currently favorite system demo disc.
0061040967|3.0|I had no idea what kind of book this was. I assumed (you know what happens when you do that) that it was like the previous in the series. Well, it is not. And when I opened the package I was upset. I did use coupons, etc., to bring the cost of the book down, but still, I had paid over (dollar amount) for what looked to be a HEAVILY illustrated coffee table book with much less content. <BR>Still, I am halfway through, I'm trying to take my time, and I am enjoying it. I give it a three for two reasons...so far, it is better than decent but not great (I have every book in the series), and also, I do not think this book is worth the list price, or anywhere near it. If I would have paid (dollar amount) I probably would have given the book a four, but no more than that. Of course, you will have to judge the content for yourself, you may enjoy it more than me. I will say this, I feel almost guilty rating this book a three, however, this is one that I believe may end up in the bargain bin at your local book store in a few months. <br />Still, if you are a discworld fan, you must buy it, so just try to buy it cheap.
B00005OB0A|5.0|2001-10-25
B00005OAJ1|4.0|If you like Jack Black, you'll love this album. It's over the top and hillarious. However, think of it as a comedy album that you'll listen to two or three times, not a music album that you'll want to listen to over and over.
B00005QG9J|5.0|When i finally got my hands on this album, i kindof knew what to expect. What i was expecting was a different approach to thier music from the last album, similar to the progression between &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot; and &quot;Make yourself&quot;. I was also expecting the unexpected, and i was ready for whatever they had thought of next. There was even a slight expectation of the sell out syndrome.<BR>    Fortunately, the heavy parts of the album are heavy, impressive and urgent, and the quiet parts are beautifuly toned and sonorous. This is a vastly different album to s.c.i.e.n.c.e. and there is no doubt that this band are changing and evolving as predicted. There is a lot of variation on this album, covering a lot of musical styles. Incubus have expanded on the funk-metal and infused a lot of influences into it, there are a lot of eastern tinges in certain songs such as &quot;Echo&quot; and the astonishing closing track &quot;aqueous transmission&quot; is a clear indication of this bands scope for innovation, playing music which is classically chinese, blending it with popular mentality. A lot of other instruments are heard on this album. Strings are often found filling in gaps in the background. On songs like &quot;11am&quot; for example. Also &quot;circles&quot; has what sounds like a flute or some similar instrument in the interlude. <BR>The best songs on this album are &quot;nice to know you&quot;, &quot;11am&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, &quot;i wish you were here&quot;, &quot;Are you in?&quot;, &quot;blood on the ground&quot;, the bitter &quot;mexico&quot; which is played on a spanish acoustic and of course probably the best song on the album is &quot;aqueous transimission&quot; which is lead by a chinese sounding guitar style instrument and is breathtakingly beautiful and serene. The other songs are also excellent even by incubus's standards, each is good.   <BR>   This album sounds fresh and exciting, like a new set of strings on a guitar, it has potential. I once read a quote by brandon boyd that went a little like &quot;to be predicable is my greatest fear&quot;. Lets just hope they don't become easily shelvable. But i think Incubus are intelligent enough to stay ahead of the game.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Definatly not a let down, which is what i feared that Incubus would put out after a few of the best albums of the late 90's. This album is not a perfect album by any means, but I was stuck around 4.5 stars + I really think people will enjoy this album.<BR>I was afraid that incbus was on there way to going totally soft and soggy, but they proved me wrong. With hard hitters like Blood On the Ground, and Have you ever, they keep it fresh. The album is one of simplicity, but everybody needs a good catchy album once and a while, and this is the one of the best albums of that type in a long time.
0743420373|3.0|When I started reading the book, I felt very optimistic. After all, I clip coupons, get my hair cut for less than 10 bucks, don't buy things I don't need, and save a large amount of my income. I spend a great deal of time trying to cut back on my expenses. Could I be a millionaire too? <br />I read on to see how millionaires became that rich. Many of them started their own businesses. But what about all the businesses that fail? Also, almost all of them invested. This is the key reason that they are millionaires, I have no doubt about that. But this book was written when the economy was so good. With today's stock market, how safe is your money? These days, companies' stocks are often worth less than a tenth of what they used to be. Businesses, especially small-scale businesses, are closing and people are losing their jobs. What's more, under &quot;fears of millionaires&quot; are several entries about increased taxes, but nothing about the stock market crashing.  In fact, I think that probably a lot of the millionaires in the book are no longer millionaires because of the dip in the economy. Keep that in mind. <br />Second, with all their &quot;frugality&quot; and &quot;not giving financial assistance to children,&quot; more than half the millionaires send their children to private schools, and more than 2/5 pay for their grandchildren to go to private schools. The last time I checked, a private high school can be close to $25,000 a year, and a top private college can be close to $35,000 a year. You call that frugal? I'm a proud public school graduate and really don't see the need to send kids to private school; of the millionaires, only 17% of them went to a private school, and they're obviously doing fine. <br />The third point that bothered me was the &quot;price per pound&quot; shopping strategy for a car. I'm really confused as to what that has to do with the overall value (best deal considering price and quality) of the car. <br />The only people that would benefit from this book are those that do waste extravagantly. There are plenty of them out there. But this book is useless for the people who earn $25,000 a year and/or live just as frugally as the millionaires. I found the &quot;Why aren't you a millionaire? You must be wasteful!&quot; attitude very condescending.<br />The book is fatally flawed in its assessement of priorities. Having three luxury cars while being in financial danger doesn't make you happy. However, having a million bucks in your stock portfolio or bank account also doesn't guarantee happiness. The book should promote a balanced lifestyle in which one can reduce financial worries by learning to appreciate a simpler life. Instead, the book places far too much emphasis on gathering up that wealth instead of finding that optimum balance.
0451527046|4.0|When I first picked up this book, I thought it was a little boring.  But after I got to about page 20 I started to figure out why this is a classical favorite of millions of people today.  This is a story about a orphan boy named Jim Hawkins that finds a treasure map in a dead mans room and goes on a daring adventure that will change his life.  He and the whole ship's crew go through many challenges during their voyage like mutiny, murders, and trying to fight the evil pirate (also the ships captain) , Long John Silver, that would kill his own friends to keep all the treasure for his own.  This is a great suspense that you will never be able to put down. I highly recommend that you read this book.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|If you're looking for intelligence, a good plot, or a riveting adventure, you're probably in the wrong place. If you're looking for good clean escapist entertainment, you're in the right place. If you looking for eye candy, you're definitely in the right place. The soundtrack ain't bad either.<BR>This movie has gotten some pretty bad reviews since it's theatrical debut. These reviews all made very valid points, if you don't have a clue what you're talking about.<BR>What you have here is a movie that's based on a computer game that's based on....wells T&amp;A. Let's face it, the Tomb Raider fan base began as a bunch of lonely men with too much time on their hands.  It wasn't until later that the game caught on for it's actual value as a RPG, and well...that value is questionable.<BR>I for one, went to see this expecting nothing more than a lot of great footage of Angelina Jolie doing some really cool stunts.  I was impressed with the spectacle I received. Overly impressed. So, I give it a 4 star rating for its great spectacle, but if you are looking for something more....that's the fifth star that just isn't there.
B000002TQV|5.0|im gonna keep it short and sharp.<BR>all those people who say kid a and amnesiac are works of genius compared to this are stupid. they got in to radiohead too late and want to make up for it by saying their new music is the best, therefore ignoring the back catalogue they didn't already own. good songs, great music, and beautiful singing. all found on the whole album, rather than the distilled version seen in newer albums. i also think that anyone who has seen radiohead live ( i saw them on the big tent tour, and the mini festival they did, and have seen the bends tour video) knows that the tracks from the bends are the ones ( along with a few o.k computer tracks) that get the real fans going.  BUY this album, buy o.k computer, realsie how great they are, and then you can go off and be experimental with the new work if you want to.
B000002UJQ|4.0|The best song on this album is easily track 9, 'CLIMBING UP WALLS', its an amazing track and is emotion provoking, as is most of Radioheads good songs. Of course Paranoid Android, Karma Police and No Suprises are amazing pieces of work, but aren't as good as track 9.<br /> I also think that this is their second best album, behind the masterpiece that is 'The Bends'. Also check out Sigur Ros, they are amazing and easily as good as Radiohead, and don't let the fact that they sing in a made up language put you off, it honestly sounds better than english.
B00003CX5P|5.0|The five stars are soley for the high quality of the dvd and the fabulous extras, but seeing the movie for the first time since it's initial theatrical run reminded me how iffy I feel about it.  It's got all the special effects and production values money can buy, and there are some outstanding action sequences and very imaginative creatures but there's something missing and I think I know what it is:  heart.   I just don't think Lucas's heart was really in this.  I think it was an obligation, a financial one and one to the fans.   I don't sense the utter thrill and joy of pure moviemaking I did from the original trilogy.   Nothing happens here that gets the hairs on the back of your neck up, or gives you goosebumps or rouses you out of your seat.   I wish wish wish Lucas would entrust the next two segments to outside writers and directors.
B00005614M|5.0|Like many newcomers to Jazz, the first recording that I really connected with was &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;.  (At the time, I thought I was special.  Only later did I realize how stereotypical I was.) Until I listened to that disc, to my ears, Jazz was Jazz...it all kinda sounded the same.  <br />The more I listened, the more I realized that the cool sounds of Miles and Mulligan were what I enjoyed the most.  <br />As I sought out more information and more music from Davis, everything pointed me towards Birth of the Cool.  I even went to a &quot;Jazz store&quot; to buy it.  I remember being prepared to be blown away on the first listen.  It didn't happen.  It's not that kind of disc.  <br />Only after listening to it over time do you get the true appreciation for how excellent it is.  But now, it's one of the few disks that stays in the CD changer while the other flavors of the week come and go.
B00005QG9J|5.0|They did it again... Morning View is a wonderful album. The sound is more laid back than Make Yourself and you can tell that they were in a more relaxed atmosphere while recording it. Everyone should definitely get this cd. Enjoy!
B00005KHLV|4.0|Kar-wai Wong's &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; may have been released in the US in 2001, but it has already grounded a reputation as an international hit. It was nominated for a &quot;Golden Palm&quot; at the Cannes Film Festival. It won prizes at the British Academy Awards, the Cesar Awards, and was nominated for 12 Hong Kong Awards, 5 of which it won!<br />&quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is a story of unrequited love. Or is it? Tony Leung chiu wai and Maggie Cheung star as two people whom at first are neighbors, and then find out a secret about their spouses. His wife and her husband are both having affairs. Because of this and the fact that there is a small attraction between them, they see a lot of each other. People soon start to spread gossip that they are having an affair! But they each decide not to. They don't want to sink down to the level that their spouses have. But, things are never that simple. I refuse to give away what happens, you'll have to rent or buy this film to find out. &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is really a beautiful film. I saw this movie about a week ago and I swear the film is still with me! I can't get it out of my head. It has that sorta staying power. I remember how well the acting was, the directing, the cinematography, and especially the music. Everything is soooo well done in this movie. I will never be able to express how wonderful and truly amazing this film really is. There aren't many films like this one, which is a sad thing, but &quot;In the Mood for Love&quot; is definitely one of the best films released in 2001! The music, which really left a mark on me, has such beautiful songs. &quot;Yumeji's Theme&quot; which plays almost through out the film, is wonderful to listen to. The rest of the score is Nat King Cole. And there's one song I really loved, &quot;Quizas, Quizas, Quizas&quot;. If you happen to go to a video store, please rent this film. You will not regret it.
6303187064|3.0|Okay, this is a definitely good movie. Brandon Lee was the perfect man for the role of the Crow, and of course, his untimely death lent an air of even deeper tragedy to the story. The supporting cast is pretty good too - T-Bird, Top Dollar, Funboy, all fit their roles excellently. And what's more, the soundtrack is filled with great _original_ material from some of the best alternative bands ever.<br />So why doesn't this movie deserve the full 5 stars? Simply put, it isn't as good as the graphic novel. The graphic novel is a masterpiece of perversity and pain. In the graphic novel, there is none of that stuff about how if the crow was hurt, Eric would lose his super powers. The book does not rely on creating drama by putting the character's life in danger (especially by means of such a cheeky device) - it creates it by the utterly unbearable despair that permeates every page. We know Eric is going to win, but that doesn't keep us from fervently wishing that he'll find his inner peace.<br />The movie doesn't have that. In addition to the fact that the screenwriters added that bit, they took several other \\"creative liberties\\": for instance, in the book, Top Dollar was killed fairly early on, very ignominiously and without the climactic showdown bit. In the movie, he's not only the head of a whole crime ring, but he didn't even participate in the original murders of Eric and Shelly. Another \\"creative liberty\\" was the addition of Top Dollar's sister/lover, Myca, who was not present in the book at all. Her presence adds some New-Age/mysticism stuff that really has no place at all in the storyline. (Hey, we should thank our lucky stars an editor rejected the ORIGINAL screenplay, which featured a Chinese sorcerer named Lao.)<br />There were several other scenes that I thought the book did far better than the movie. For instance, in the book, Eric does not have a showdown with Funboy - he throws Darla (or \\"Sandy\\" in the book) out, sits down on a chair and has himself a nice metaphysical discussion with the junkie. (Trust me, it's MUCH more effective than it sounds.) Of course, there were numerous other scenes left out (the Jones Transfer episode, Skank's death, which was COMPLETELY different and far more horrific in the book), etc. This is partially because you can only cram so much into ninety minutes; and while the movie was very faithful to the book (for a movie), one can't help but feel that it simplified some of the book's subtleties and replaced some of its horrifically cruel, but beautiful moments with more-or-less generic action. It has plenty of its own merits, but if you liked the movie a lot, DEFINITELY find the book, as it's darker, more poignant, and generally better at telling the story than the movie. (Brandon Lee did do a great job, though...he will be missed.)
6300182355|5.0|nice sci-fi not SF.  you can enjoy it like bubble gum no thinking required.
0761536434|4.0|Anybody over the age of 18 will remember the classic arcade games that raked in billions of dollars in quarters (or later, their video console and home computer translations) - Donkey Kong, Defender, Asteroids, Battlezone, Space Invaders - the list is almost endless. And the companies that produced them were as well known as major league sports teams: Atari, Midway, Williams, Electronic Arts, Commodore, etc.<br />This book chronicles the fascinating story of the birth and evolution of the video game industry, from the pre-video arcade games to the modern high res computer games. It's large, about 600 pages,but it reads more like a fast paced novel than an encyclopedia, and contains just enough information to keep the narration interesting without getting bogged down in minor details.<br />As the title indicates, this book covers it all, and it does so with an insider's perspective, Kent having reconstructed the full story from hundreds of interviews with the major players. It's also full of interesting insights and anecdotes about the games, their creators, and the founders and movers of the industry. Ever wonder where the strange title Donkey Kong came from? Did you know there was a military training version of Battlezone? Which video game resurrected a dying arcade industry? <br />The business, as well as the technical, side of the video game history is covered, with stories about the wheeling and dealing that took place to launch and maintain the companies, and the reasons behind the successes and failures.<br />I thought I'd read a little bit of this book at a time, but ended up plowing through it, it was that engrossing.
0525457585|5.0|The book is not one of the best children's books I've ever read. It's one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. The book was designed for adults, but children would find it enjoyable. Every chapter ends with, &quot;But that is another story.&quot; There were so many spin-offs of histories and stories which could have happened, which could have been pursued. Thankfully, they did not. We, the readers, get to complete the stories. This approach made one feel like this story *was* real, and continuing on. This feeling was furthered by the merging of reality and literature which is central to the storyline, reminding the reader that they are actually reading and watching, just as the main character is. And as the main character is drawn into the fantasy, so, maybe, we can be too.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Listening to this soundtrack is almost as powerful as the movie, this soundtrack as well as the movie left me speechless.<BR>I play this soundtrack right through everyday without fail, it will be in your stereo for months.<BR>The last twenty minutes of the movie was terribly powerful and shocked me into silence, the soundtrack had the exact same effect.<BR>Requiem for a Dream soundtrack is beyond music, i'ts beyond words, i'ts simply a must buy.<BR>There are no flaws in the movie or soundtrack at all, both are incredible peices of art and without a doubt deserve 5 stars.
B00005QG9J|5.0|The new album by Incubus is my favorite one yet.  They blend all the earlier albums together in this one to form a melow yet metal sound.  Although &quot;I Wish You Were Here&quot; is the first single i think &quot;Echo&quot; is by far the best song on the cd.  It blends their accoustic sounds with their turntable effects and a solid drumbeat.  This is a deffinate buy for anyone who has bought the other Incubus albumsand loved them.
B00003CXP1|5.0|Based on the novel by Hubert Selby Jr., and adapted by Selby and director Darren Aronofsky, this is undoubtedly one of the most effective films ever made about the experience of drug addiction. Requiem for a dream focuses on four people bound for a downward spiral of addiction and sheer terror, but it's Ellen Burstyn--in a raw and bravely triumphant performance--who most desperately embraces the downward spiral of drug abuse. As lonely widow Sara Goldfarb, she invests all of her dreams in an ridiculous self-help TV game show, jolting her bloodstream with diet pills and coffee while her son Harry (Jared Leto) shoots heroin with his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and slumming girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly). They're sliding toward madness at varying speeds, and Aronofsky tracks this gloomy process by endlessly repeating the imagery of their deadly routines.<BR> I am one of those people who, when they hear a movie is extremely shocking and disturbing, get a burning urge to see it as fast as I can to see if it shocks me (especially if it's R-18+). So, I eagerly anticipated seeing it. The performances in this movie were truly unbelievable. The characters' miserable pursuit of their misguided dreams grabs hold of you in a way wich crushes your spirit and rips you inside out. You know what's going to happen but can't stop watching, as though you just want to be their for them, for Sara, for Harry, for Tyrone, for Marion. It's far from some corny anti-drug movie. It's a raw, gut-wrenching, unforgiving look at the by-product of a society that has chosen to dull its senses with an assortment of nightmarish addictions and which feeds on empty images of glamour, high life and leisure.<BR> Darren Aronofsky has pushed this movie to a disturbing extreme, forcing conventional narrative into a panic zone of traumatized people pushed to the furthest boundaries of chemical tolerance. It's too easy to call this a cautionary tale; it's a guided tour through hell, with Aronofsky as our bold and ruthless host. Darren Aronofsky himself compared the film to a jump from a plane without a parachute, and the movie ends three minutes after you hit the ground. The colors and angles he chooses make the film very beautiful. His use of split screen, cameras attached to actors, and close ups are simply a work of art. The fast paced cuts blew my mind. most teens should watch this movie because I guarantee they will have think twice, even three times before taking drugs. I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but I have never seen a movie that made me feel such undisguised emotion.<BR> The soundtrack adds to the psychological and physical havoc displayed on screen. This movie, along with the music, will send chills down your spine. One review I read said that the movie not only pulls the rug out from under you, it drags you and the rug down a long flight of stairs into a very dark basement. The last twenty minutes of this film are terribly powerful and shocked me into silence, I've never before felt physically ill after a movie. Aronofsky is a cinematic artist, as well as a mastermind madman. This movie will stay under your skin for months, after viewing this remarkable film you feel totally numb.
B00001ZSZX|4.0|Simply put, this 1977 release is hard rock at its best, played by intelligent British musicians and featuring eight songs (these are still the good old-days, when band released albuns with few, but great songs, instead of releasing albuns with fourteen to fifteen songs filled with fillers !!!!!). The atmosphere of this album is something unique, I hear the album over and over again. Very good.
0767849493|5.0|Anyone who has ever wondered why their church has expected certain doctrines for no apparent reason should see this movie.  <br />It centers around two banished angels using the Catholic church's dogmatic authority to get back into heaven and prove God wrong (which is the ultimate divine catastrophe!).  To stop this disaster, poor little Bethany is required to take a look at her faith once again and see where she went wrong.<br />This movie sent people back to church with a new view on faith.  Others of course were offended and protested.  I, as a Pagan, was able to appreciate Kevin Smith finally revealing on the screen what many of us (and liberal/moderate Christians) have known all along!  <br />The God-as-a-woman portrayal by Alanis Morrisette was hilarious and you can't deny Jason Mewes' ability to cut through with his Jay vulgarity.  Overall, this was a long-overdue film to attack this widely known but silently concealed issue:  religious dogma.<br />Besides, it introduced me to the rest of Smith's films, all of which are at least funny.  CLERKS and CHASING AMY deal with real, insightful humanities as well. <br />You've got to see this film; once you do you'll be aching to buy it!
B000002KGT|5.0|Beautifully textured, expertly crafted, marvellous singing, skilfull playing, honest production, ect, etc, etc.. What's mroe to say? One of the ebst pop albums of all times.
014028009X|5.0|Where do I begin????  I'm angry that I can only give this amazing novel 5 stars...it deserves at least 5 times that amount!  Bridget Jones is one of the best female characters ever created! She's witty and hilarious, and heart-warming at the same time.  A year in her life would be one of the most hectic experiences a person could have, and yet she handles it with grace (and wine and self-help books).  She flies through a boyfriend, a beastly human rights barrister being forced down her throat by a mother who runs off with a rather nasty fellow with a gentleman's handbag, a new job with a boss who starts most sentences with \\"I'm thinking...\\", and a permanent weight crisis that never seems to be resolved.  Overall, this is a wonderful book, especially for any \\"Singletons\\" who are sick and tired of hearing \\"How's your love life?\\".  If you don't laugh at Bridget and her escapades, there must be something wrong...maybe you didn't read her right.  Anyway, pick up this jewel...you'll be glad you did!
0375703764|4.0|Curiosity is what brought me to this book.  And it was well rewarded.<br />But, to describe what I've just finished reading?  Nearly impossible.  This book has so many layers.  So many components.  So much depth and texture.<br />Definitely the most complex book I've read this year.  Without question one of the best I've read this year as well.<br />I think the most important or remarkable aspect will depend on who you are.  So, in telling what I enjoyed and admired, I'm not sure that I can speak for everyone. <br />First of all, for a debut -- or any other -- novel, this is a very accomplished piece of work.  It sprawls and doesn't always add up.  But there is reason for some of that.  <br />There are some who may say that the format is a clever contrivance for hiding the author's inability to hone his narrative.  I would disagree.  The multiple layers, the several angles from which information comes to the reader -- there is more art in this than artifice.<br />If Danielewski doesn't always make his point as successfully as possible, he as an author will ultimately have to decide.  And if his intention is to misdirect the reader's attention or create confusion by omitting details, I think it is used as a device to bring the reader to a point similar to that of the novel's characters.<br />The story of the Navidson family and their bizarre, shifting, maze of a house is itself enough of a puzzle and horror story.  However this is presented in such a way that we read about the enigmatic case of Zampano, the possibly fictitious author of a possibly fictitious unpublished manuscript dealing with analyzing the possibly fictitious documentary film based on the -- yes -- possibly fictitious Navidsons' experiences.<br />Our master of ceremonies for this excursion is one Johnny Truant.<br />Supposedly, Johnny found the manuscript and other related materials in his friend's apartment building after the mysterious disappearance of Zampano.<br />But, we can never know for sure.<br />While the character of Johnny has a way with words, he admits to having a way with more than just that.<br />If the story is true, he may have altered it for his own satisfaction.  If he didn't alter it, perhaps his attempts to piece it together have created a product distorted by his sense of importance.  Even if this didn't occur, we learn much about Johnny that makes him a narrator in whom we cannot place our full trust.<br />And maybe what we learn about Johnny isn't true...<br />The experience of this book goes beyond appreciation of a simple narrative.  It stirs emotions and ideas.  And definitely requires the reader to participate.  <br />You cannot pick this book up expecting it to take little of your time.  Nor can you expect it to be easy entertainment.<br />However, when there are unexpected developments, they are big. <br />I don't remember when I last gasped out loud or jumped in my seat while reading a book, but I did with this one.  Not many times...enough though to realize that I had been drawn far into the novel.<br />A substantial part of my appreciation for this book was increased by listening to the &quot;Haunted&quot; CD created by the author's sister -- Poe.  To me the two works will forever be intertwined even though I'm sure one could be enjoyed without the other.  The CD is by no means intended as a soundtrack for the book.  But it does explore related themes.<br />Since the book does deal with a documentary film, it leads to the question of whether or not it could be adapted for the cinema...something like the &quot;Blair Witch Project&quot;.  I think not.  The one -- a psuedo-documentary which does nothing but display a series of edited but very raw images -- fails to have anything to offer on repeat viewing.  This novel though is full of possible interpretations and could be moved to the medium of film in several ways.<br />I'd almost hate to see that happen though.  Danielewski's novel is such a wonder.
0061040967|5.0|Pratchett's latest work brings together many of his classic cast of characters: Rincewind (who has been promoted in the Unseen Univerity to &quot;Professor of Cruel and Unusual Geology&quot;), Cohen the Barbarian and his Silver Horde, DEATH, Lord Vetinari, Captain Carrot, the Librarian (ook!), and the rest of the faculty from the Unseen University.  We also have the introduction of Leonard da Quirm, a genius who paints pictures so realistic that their eyes not only follow you, but they'll also follow you home and do the washing.<br />The story is a take on the Prometheus legend with Cohen, after being disillusioned over the ironic death of one of his Horde, vowing to return fire to the Gods in the form of a bomb that could, as a result, destroy Discworld.  As usual with Pratchett's stories, most of the fun is in the journey itself.  The story is filled with satire on aging, bureaucracies, and the space program.  Pratchett also finds time to allude to multiple myths and famous historical figures, and to include references to everything from Joseph Heller's Catch-22 to Star Wars.<br />Up to this point, I have deliberately avoided mentioning the artwork because I wanted to emphasize the great story.  However, the artwork cannot be denied.  It contains some of the most beautiful fantasy art I have ever seen.  I was afraid that I'd be upset because of the potential difference between the paintings and how the characters look in my mind's eye, but Paul Kidby somehow manages to capture the essence of Pratchett's world.  One painting that I am desperate to have as a poster is that of Death petting a kitten.  As if that weren't enough, the next page has the kitten playing with the Death of Rats' tail.  The wide shots of Discworld, with its elephants and the Great A'Tuin are especially breathtaking.<br />Buy this book.  Buy it for the sublime artwork.  Buy it for the hilarious story.  Buy it because since Douglas Adams is gone, Terry Pratchett is now the undeniable king of fantasy wit and satire.<br /><br />My only negative comment: WHERE'S THE LUGGAGE?!?!?!?!
1853261033|4.0|This classic by Robert Louis Stevenson should have a place on everyone's shelf.  When we think of tales of pirates and buccaneers, we can not help but thing of Captain Flint and Long John Silver.<br />Why this edition?  Although this is by no means a keepsake, it is an inexpensive and well-done edition.  It is unabridged and has an illustration of the treasure map as well as illustrations from other scenes in the book (such as Jim Hawkins' meeting Ben Gunn).  It is easy to carry around when you are out on vacation or doing some hiking.  You can't do that with a keepsake.<br />The story is written in narrative fashion, mostly from the perspective of Hawkins, but sometimes from Dr. Livesey's point of view.  Either way, it is fast paced and hard to put down.<br />I would recommend this edition to anyone not willing to invest in a hardcover keepsake.  You can not go wrong.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I am a Krall fan;  what can I say?  Granted, the background is a bit too Nelson-Riddle-ish and Ms. Krall is very tame in this one, but it  fits an occasional need to tune out the world, turn down the lights, and enjoy the lush arrangements and the less strident parts of Krall's timbre.  I liked it!  One is enough, however; on to some more real Krall.
B000009QPG|5.0|The Rick Rubin / Slayer team produced their best album ever in SEASONS. The album is perfect, each note or riff, no matter how fast was slow it was played, was clearly carefully crafted and arranged, whitout loosing spontainety. The band is in top notch form, and all the ten songs are killers, not a single filler here. I'm out of words to descibe the quality of this album, and I'm not even a great trash / speed metal fan. Unfortunately, Lombardo left soon after this album. He is one of the best metal drummers ever, with an unique style and a beautiful sound to his kit, even when he played the most aggressive of tunes.

B00003CX9S|5.0|This is a film that is unimaginably difficult for me to watch.  I saw it once at the age of 13 and left the theater in tears.  The film is shot in B &amp; W to excellent effect, portraying a dreary industrial England.  The true story portrayed is that of Joseph (called John in the film) Merrick, who suffered from terrible deformities.  In spite of them, we are witness to a truly beautiful soul.  David Lynch must be one of the most underrated directors that we have.  One should also note that the film was a project of Mel Brooks, and quite a departure from his usual fare indeed.<br />If you can stand a prolonged and deep true story of horrible suffering, you can see this film.  Great stuff.
B0000004V2|5.0|Being a huge fan of British music, I had heard of the Stone Roses but had never heard any of their music so I decided to pick up this album when I saw it the other day and...WOW, this is one of the greatest albums of all time, their are so many great songs from I Wanna Be Adored to Waterfall to Made of Stone to Fools Gold.  Its really trippy, dancable, British rock music.  It never lags one bit...I Am The Resurrection is the best song in my opinion.  Go get this now, you won't be disappointed.
B00003CXP1|5.0|This is one of those films which doesnt give you any positive feeling whatsoever. Which is completely realistic knowing the destructiveness of drug abuse in its purest form. It is a disturbing picture concerning the lives of a couple of youngsters growing from consumers to abusers of heroine and cocaine. The agony of the mother whose life consists in sitting in front of the television completely paranoia from all the so called medicins she is geting to stay calm. Getting more and more paranoia she finally literally gets eaten by the fridge in a brilliant scene. Finally a movie where the raunchy feeling creeps up from behind you and doesnt let go anymore. Bravo to the &quot;rollercoaster' editing of the scenes in which the cocaine consumation takes place.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I've been an Incubus fan for so long that I can't remember when I first listened to them... Fungous Amongus and Enjoy Incubus were great albums, when they were into their earlier funk and freestyle influences.  S.C.I.E.N.C.E was the first full-length album that carved a niche for Incubus in the \\"alternative\\" mainstream, and was IMHO their best offering up until \\"Morning View.\\"  <br />This album is amazing in all sense of the word.  Incubus has evolved throughout the years, and through this evolution, they have become become the future sound of rock.  SCIENCE was my favorite album, up until today...<br />Here's the skinny on this album, track by track:<BR>NICE TO KNOW YOU: a perfect opening song, reminscent of \\"SCIENCE,\\" yet smooth and full of flow like \\"Make Yourself.\\"<BR>CIRCLES: another track reminsenct of Incubus's harder, edgier style, destined to be a chart-topper.<BR>WISH YOU WERE HERE: if you haven't heard this tune yet, you are missing out on something special. perfect harmonies and subtle yet powerful and visceral acoustic guitar on this song that will have you singing along in no time.<BR>JUST A PHASE: edgy power-rock with poetic vocals, great tune.<BR>11 AM: least favorite song on album, but that doesn't mean anything because I admire the musical complexity that Incubus has to offer... you've probably heard this (...) before, but, there really isn't a \\"bad\\" song on the CD.<BR>BLOOD ON THE GROUND: second best song on CD. Incubus's maturity can really be seen with this song. Brandon has a knack for writing lyrics that make people think, this song is proof of that special knack.<BR>MEXICO: Many of the songs on this album have been toned down from what we come to expect from Incubus. This is a great thing, because it shows that this band can do much more than blow your eardrums off. Their talent is so diverse. Mexico is a great slower song,and the lyrics are fantastic.<BR>WARNING: 3rd best song on CD, great tune, with catchy lyrics. another destined to be a chart topper.<BR>ECHO: more of the lighter side of the band, good tune with a great melody.<BR>HAVE YOU EVER: back to basics with this song. back to their harder edgier stuff... definite head bobber.<BR>ARE YOU IN?: funky, funky, now... great funk flava for the homies. 4th best song on the album.<BR>UNDER MY UMBRELLA: i really love their harder tunes because it hits me right square in my dome... sometimes i need that, i think we all do.<BR>AQUEOUS TRANSMISSION: hands down the best song on the CD. maturity level is through the roof here. with far-east sounding background ambience, and all those damn crickets, this song will transcend all other experimental tunes they have tackled. put this song on, and drop out for a while.... you'll see what I mean......<br />I hope that helps.  This CD was one of the better investments I have made in recent memory... 5+ stars.... go get it now<br />I said go get it, what are you waiting for????
B00005QIPH|4.0|Some of these songs remind of earlier Misfits albums with Danzig, though not as intense. This is something I picture being played on College radio stations for years to come. The songs are catchy, but are not deliberatly so. Get it.
B000002OHX|5.0|The material here is better than their studio albums.  I've seen them live and they are definitely a live band.  This is good music.
0618135871|5.0|Once again Roth surprises and delights readers with a novella of the later life of David Kepesh, the protagonist of two of his much earlier works, _The Breast_, and _The Professor of Desire_.  Desire in Roth's characters certainly springs eternal; it is however less the concrete fleshly concerns about which Roth is superficially writing than it is about the abstract concern of his protagonist with love as both subject and object.  Don't be fooled by the outward trappings of his fiction; Roth has spent his career weaving intricately patterned fiction and being misread by those who see only what is on the surface.  This is a wonderful, hopeful book about personal salvation, and, we hope, is but one more reason why Philip Roth should be the next American to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.
B000002VRZ|5.0|When I want to hear the best of the guitar sound, I put this baby in the CD player and put the headphones on and I am thoroughly amazed at the talent of these southern gents every single time I listen.  This CD is sure to please.  It has some of the greatest songs that the Outlaws performed.  <br />I prefer to hear certain songs like Song For You, Green Grass.., Freeborn Man, and Prisoner from the Bring It Back Alive album.<BR>HOWEVER I would not do without this version because the studio sound is so amazing and clear.   <BR>Great selection of tunes.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is easily the best incubus album to date.  For those who are wishing the return to S.c.i.e.n.c.e. , you will be disappointed.  Incubus has already made science, and to repeat themselves would defeat the purpose of being a creative artist.  They didn't exactly repeat &quot;make yourself&quot; either.  The songs are surely of higher pop accessibility like make yourself as opposed to science, but that does not necessarily mean that it's bad.  &quot;Wish you were here&quot; we've all heard on the radio already, and many are (as i have) were complaining &quot;oh no they're still gonna be making that poppy stuff so they can sell records&quot; but after reading the lyrics, I see the track in a different way.  It's just about feeling good.  The next track makes &quot;wish you were here&quot; 100x more tolerable and necessary as a song.  It's called &quot;just a phase&quot;, and although sounds nothing like previous incubus material, it is one of the best songs they have ever recorded.  It has some cool alice in chains grooves to it, and lyrically, Brandon sings about being famous.  Whether the song is directed at himself or his peers, it is simply haunting and beautiful at the same time.  Here's an except (6/8): <br />&quot;sooner than later they'll be throwing quarters at you on stage.  Whooooo  areeee youuuu???? when willlllll you be throooough?!?!?  IT's JUST A PHASE AND I'M WAITING FOR IT TO BE OVER TOO!!! YEAHHHHH!!!!&quot;<br />After completion of the epic &quot;just a phase&quot;, enters &quot;11am&quot;.  When this one hits the radio, we're never going to hear the end of it.  It's going to be bigger than that Coldplay song we're all sick of hearing.  Regardless, I am still new to the track (less than twenty listens) and have been repeating it over and over.  I can't get enough and when I get sick of it I'm going to die.<br />&quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; is the meanest song ever.  Brandon does NOT want to talk to you anymore, and this time he means it.  I hope he pulls up one of those 15 year old teeny bopper girls on stage and sings this to her.<BR>One thing that's weird, was while I was reading the lyrics, the picture in the upper left hand corner of the page (out of the corner of my eye) appeared to be the face of the guy on s.c.i.e.n.c.e.!!!  I thought it was just an optical illusion, until they got to the bridge.  I thought I was back in high school again.  Bravo!!<br />&quot;Mexico&quot; is another &quot;A side&quot;, which will be overplayed on the radio until we are sick of incubus.  But in the meantime, I can't hear it enough.<br />&quot;Nice to know you&quot;, &quot;Warning&quot;, &quot;Circles&quot;, &quot;Under My Unbrella&quot; and &quot;Have you Ever&quot; are the good old fashioned alternative rock out songs.  If you tend to dislike the newer incubus sound, then you can't go wrong with these. They're awsome.<br />In between &quot;warning&quot; and &quot;have you ever&quot;, comes &quot;echo&quot;.  Echo is simply beautiful.  Another single.  The first thing you will think when you hear it is that it's a rip-off of &quot;stellar&quot;, but it's better than stellar ever was in every way.  I promise.<BR>Also, the drumming is VERY expressive and fun.  The song also features some of DJ Kilmore's best contributions to an incubus song, and shows why he is better than the average DJ, who just throws his skillz in and plays some scratching and beats while the singer is trying to perform a song.<br />When me and my friend stefan were reading along, the cd ended up at &quot;Are you in&quot;, for which the lyrics were not printed.  So we put down the lyrics sheets, and realized... THEY WANT US TO SMOKE!!!!  So we did, and the song got over just in time.  We then went back to reading.<br />&quot;Under my Umbrella&quot; is sooo awsome!<br />then the last track. &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; I'm not even going to say anything other than that this is one of the greatest songs... EVER.  Listen to it.<br />Singles:<BR>Nice to Know You<BR>Wish You Were Here<BR>(11am)<BR>(Mexico)<BR>(echo)<BR>(are you in)<BR>(blood on the ground)<BR>(Warning)<br />The Heavier Songs:<BR>Blood on the ground<BR>Circles<BR>Under My Unbrella<BR>Warning<BR>Nice to Know You<BR>Have You Ever<br />The Lighter Songs:<BR>Mexico<BR>11am<BR>Echo<BR>Aqueous Transmission<br />Instant Classics:<BR>Are you In<BR>11am<BR>Just a Phase
B00000DCHE|5.0|This album is a die hard fan's delight-- a collection of songs dear to the artist that were not often played live over the years. This album did for me what was Billy Joel's desire--to turn fans onto the material before The Stranger. During the Glass Houses tour Billy Joel had many of his shows recorded onto a relatively new medium-- digital tape--an innovation not heard on any live albums before 1981. From the large music halls to small nightclubs we are treated to one heck of a show, in superb quality. Every member of the band plays his best, with a passion that Billy had wanted to express in the studio songs but could not without the momentum of a live audience. Another reason to get this cd is Billy's perfect performances--his voice was at its strongest compared to any of his various live releases over the years. On the Millennium show he had to lower the key of several songs presented here. Many of the songs that came out as boring and forgotten on the albums really shine on this CD, such as Summer, Highland Falls. I highly recommend this album and rate it 5 stars because Billy puts 110% into each song with a passion that has hardly been matched.
0060955775|5.0|This a beautifully written book.  It makes the reader think of all the possiblities in life and the power inside yourself to overcome fear.
0784011796|5.0|Let's face it, folks. Indie movies are, for the most part, really, really bad, and the people who claim to like them are more often than not either film students or people with a desperate need to be &quot;interesting.&quot; Well, thank goodness for films like &quot;Pi&quot; then, that proves to us that independent cinema can be really, really good.<br />The story revolves around an obsessed mathematician who tries to find a pattern in the stock market. He figures that since patterns can be found everywhere else in the world, there must be a pettern to the stock market as well. That's all I'm gonna tell you about the plot, since I don't want to spoil the movie for you.<br />Shot in b/w, the bleakness of it reminds me of &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, but where &quot;Eraserhead&quot; got really boring after twenty or so minutes, this movie never gets boring. All in all a very interesting film.
6304698623|5.0|This has got to be one of my most favorite movies. I have seen it so many times I've lost count. You can totally relate to the lead role, Sara Crewe, who believes in the magic around her. She is sweet and loving,and makes an effect on everyone around her. When she is left at a boarding school while her father is fighting for the British, she charms everyone with her character. But when she has false word that her father is dead, she is forced to work as a servant or be thrown in the streets. I absolutely love the way she is reunited again with her supposedly deceased father at the end of the movie. Since Sara had moved from India with her father, the movie has magical scenes surrounding that. You will love the music in this! I highly suggest you get the soundtrack!
B00005JKG7|5.0|&quot;The Fog&quot; is a great creepy, scary flick from John Carpenter that although similar to &quot;Halloween&quot; stands completely on its own. John Houseman's ghost story in the opening scene sets the eerie tone and plot of a town (Antonio Bay) cursed by 100 year old drownded lepers. Hal Holbrook is classic as the tormented Father Malone who discovers the crimes of Antonio Bay's founders. His drink-induced warnings of curses and doom to the town are pretty funny. Although Adriennce Barbeau is giving top billing, she is somewhat incidental to most of the action...she keeps the town informed and entertained from her lighthouse radio station, &quot;KAB&quot;. (I do find it hard to believe that everyone in Antonio Bay listens to the lame, boring KAB.)The real star of &quot;The Fog&quot; is the fog itself...it lurks and creeps bringing death and mayhem to wherever it goes. As with any Carpenter flick, the dreary, mood-amplifing score completely rounds out the viewing experience, and with a truly typical Carpenter ending, this movie is great for Halloween or anytime.
B000056IKS|5.0|There is an elitist somewhere who will scorn the fact that I hadn't even heard of Neu! before Astralwerks rereleased their old albums, especially since I am a confirmed Kraftwerk fan since my dad bought a cassette of Man Machine when I was like, eight or nine.<br />Well, it's true. But that's okay right? There's so much music out there.<br />Now, listening to Neu! I am amazed at how many groups owe debts to their music. Parts of Tortoise albums feel directly lifted from this album (Djed). There are elements of yes, Eno, yes, the Orb, and of Future Sound of London. The list is numerous. Is it fair to count Skinny Puppy? or A.S.F.? The ambient industrial movement kind of spawned from the Germanic funk of the 70's, it's fair to say, even if Faust was the more important group. Neu! had its effect, certainly.<br />(This is all that I'm musing now, as I listen to it. Armchair musicologist that I purport to be. Isn't that what all us self-elected reviewers at Amazon are anyway?)<br />Finally:<BR>It's an album that does not grow on you. Instead, from the instant it begins to play, you will cherish it.
B000002MUQ|5.0|I can't really say anything new that the other 52 people haven't already said.  All I can say is that this is a great album that I still love to listen to.  I've owned a copy of this one ever since it's release in '95, and it has always been a fav of mine.  This is the final album with Sammy Hagar on vocals.  And though I am a bigger Roth fan, Sammy is a great singer in his own right.  And he delivers with some of his greatest lyrics ever.  As usual, Eddie is in top form on all tracks.  Alex delivers with his signature strong percussion, and Michael Anthony delivering his beefy bass lines right on time.  Fav song is &quot;Don't Tell Me What Love Can Do&quot;, 2nd fav song is the killer ballad &quot;Not Enough&quot;.  Van Halen fans, and general hard rock fans alone are sure to love this one.  If you don't have it, I highly recommend it.  ROCK ON!
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie Minogue's 'Fever' is the sound of 1979 and Studio 54 with a slick modern update.<BR>This is undoubtedly one of the best CD's of the year and a superb follow up to the equally excellent 'Light Years'.<BR>I highly recommend this album to anyone who likes Modjo, Spiller, Donna Summer and Chic. It is the perfect disco album, while Kylie's vocals reach another level altogether.<BR>'Fever' includes the smash hit #1 single 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head' which has so far topped the charts in 22 countries, including the UK and Australia. I'm sure it would do the same if only it was released in the US!<BR>Other highlights are Love At First Sight, More, More, More, Fragile, Come Into My World, Fever, In Your Eyes and Burning Up (a future #1 guaranteed!).<BR>'Fever' also has one of the sexiest album covers in recent years. For all lovers of soulful, carefree pop music do not hesitate. Worth the import price!
B00005JKES|5.0|I hope to God this DVD release will be a better quality than the video set release. The VHS set was one (if not the worst)collection sets I have ever seen. The quality was horrendous and my hope is they put some effort into the DVD. My tapes of the show I recorded myself were better than the released VHS! With that said, if the quality is there buy this DVD set. Twin Peaks is the greatest story ever told on television.
B00005OLY5|5.0|I have been trying to get this movie for years.  I was finally able to borrow a copy from my local library just so I could show my 7-year-old daughter.  She fell in love with it, too!  The brownies are our favorite characters - they add some great laughs.  For those who are interested, George Lucas has continued the story with a trilogy of books.
0805211063|3.0|Being the last (and unfinished) work of the brilliant, but very bizarre writer Franz Kafka, this book weaves a strange tale of supposedly autobiographic search and discovery.  It is difficult and anguishing to read this book, and I wonder if Kafka would have really wanted it published had he not died before finishing writing it.  It feels like a long swim upstream in a cold river, which numbs the senses. But somehow you want to know what happens to the main character, K.  Does he succeed in his plans? Is his success also subject to the laws of perception set up in this story?  If you can make it through this one, you might have a greater appreciation for Kafka's other works, such as &quot;The Metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;The Trial&quot; (and maybe all other books!). I have to say, his style is certainly unique, but I think I appreciated it much more in his other writings.
B00005QG9J|5.0|In short, this album is fantastic. I agree 100% with the review above. I love Incubus from SCIENCE to Morning View and beyond. Of course, the sound has changed, but the songs are still fantastic. I'd almost say that they are better. One of the things I love the most about Incubus is that they have great songs from either end of the spectrum. 'A Certain Shade of Green' and 'Mexico' from this new album are both fantastic songs, and both very different. Morning View is a big step in the right direction for Incubus.
0783231482|5.0|The Blues Brothers have been subject to a fair amount of critical drubbing for their antics over the years. Many critics wrote them off as being two celeberties ripping off classic music as a capitalist money making scheme. I disagree. Yeah, their music was never up to the originals of the tunes they covered. But their was genuine heart to their performances, as well as respect for the music. And, in any event, the Blues Brothers were never about being the ultimate musicians. They have always been about having a good time. And it was something they did well.<br />Never was this better demonstrated than in this classic 1980 feature film. Melding a wondeful deadpan humor with mosterous car chases and entertaining musical numbers (with some very fine guest appearences), Akroyd and Belushi have created a movie that has the viewer feeling good throughout (and probably laughing, as well). This is just a fun and funny film, plain and simple, and stands as one of my favorite comedies of all time. As an added bonus (and this'll get me killed by the blues purists), this film, along with its sadly weaker followup, introduced me to the blues and got me started playing harmonica (actually, that was the result of the cameo by Junior Wells at the end of the second feature).<br />When all is said and done, this is one movie I wholeheartedly reccomend. There is too much good stuff here to pass it by.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Diana Krall has been my very favorite for years and a lot of the time, I prefer her up-tempo numbers. But there are those essential times when I need &quot;The Look of Love.&quot; Negative reviews notwithstanding, Diana, please do another similar recording anytime! <br />Certainly, one has to be in a mood and setting to appreciate this intensely dreamy and mesmerizing album. It's not going to do much for you while you work in the garage, or play with the kids. See, the title is sort of a tip-off: experience this recording with your mate/date over a quiet, romantic dinner, say. Or, best, alone with Diana (a nice thought) over headphones turned up, without your mate/date. Later, if you're still in the mood for something jazzy, you can always put on &quot;A Tisket, a Tasket&quot; (or both) when you do the dishes. <br />When she invites you to &quot;Besame Mucho,&quot; you can't resist the urge to. It's obvious to me now that Krall, as torch singer, would have been the one, after so many decades, to put forth a cover of &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; the equal of Julie London's great version. (Sorry, Joe Cocker.) Those two pieces, alone, are worth the price of the album in my opinion but the other selections are grabbing hold more with each playing. <br />Her piano is minimal, elegant and altogether appropriate for the exquisite arrangements. Krall's allure, for me, comes from her piano and that deep sensual voice, at once icy cool and warmly intimate. With this album I sense that there is even more to the voice and the performer than I previously experienced.
0920668364|5.0|I love this book!  I have yet to get through to the very end without choking up - even after 8 months of practice!  I think this book is a wonderful way to express to your child that, no matter how big they get, you will always be their Mommy!   I feel sorry for the poor, misguided soul who is unable to see this book for the beautiful, warm fuzzy feeling it will create with your child.
0446310786|5.0|With 600+ reviews, I'll spare you the plot details and synopsis.  Simply put, I can't think of a better book that has been written in English (or any other language, for that matter).  I have taught it for years to my sophomores, and I love teaching it every time.  Harper Lee's narration and dialogue are so wonderfully simple and child-like, while dealing with some very serious and heady topics:  racism, hatred, and bigotry.  She manages to make Scout, who is nine at the beginning of the novel, sound like a nine-year-old--not an easy task.  Many authors who have children as narrators fall into the trap of having them sound too young and immature or too adult and sophistocated.  Scout sounds like a whiny, impulsive, little brat at times and then makes the most profound and insightful statements at others--as most intelligent children do. . . .  This, I believe, is Harper Lee's greatest accomplishment in this novel.  Yes, she deals wonderfully with the Nazi movements in Europe, the local racism in Maycomb, and the private prejudices against Boo Radley.  However, those issues have been tackled before and since.  Never have they been tackled with a narrator such as Scout, however.  She brings a naivete, child-like innocence, and humor to the novel and its larger, darker, deeper topics and themes.<br />Harper Lee deserves so much credit for not trying to outdo herself by writing more books of a similar nature or even, God forbid, a sequel.  She said all that needed to be said and stopped talking.  Other authors might want to take a lesson from Ms. Lee.  In short, no American student should be allowed to receive a high school diploma without having read TKM and writing a pretty darned good essay over it.  I'd settle for them just reading it, though. . . . .
B0000060NF|5.0|I still remmeber walking in store, finding a cheap CD to complete  my 3-CDs-for-price-of-2-CDs-buy. My eye fell on &quot;What's going on?&quot; by Marvin Gaye. At home I listened to it, got stunned, played it again, got stunned again. <BR>I always thought of R'n'B as a moaning genre. Mostly just girls getting wrapped about their man cheating. (Or backwards; a man dragging to his &quot;dogs&quot; about his casaonova styles and talking a girl into bed.) <BR>No Marvin Gaye doesn't do that. He moans about his life, but in a positive way. Throughout the album, he never lets you doubt the fact he was touched by god himself, because of his silk and hurt voice. Soul may have a bad name, but not because of Marvin. You've never heard somuch soul, passion or somuch honest feel into (a) song(s) before. He's a true talent and this album is his masterpiece. All songs are classics. None are just good, they're magnificent. This album is a MUST-have! It's also a true evidence that true perfection does exist. If not, it never came as close as it did now.<br />Marvin Gaye... I salute you! <BR>R.I.P. <br />PS<br />Discover this album yourself. You will NOT regret!
B00001IVOR|3.0|A lot of people criticized the Wu-Tang Clan for this album, RZA specifically, saying it was &quot;geared towards white people.&quot; Call it what you will; I call it innovation.<br />&quot;Wu-Tang Forever&quot; could have been a great album, had it been reduced to a single album. If the Clan had lopped about 6-8 tracks off, it would have been a banger the whole way through. As it stands though, it is a good album with some bad moments.<br />RZA's production technique, honed rather well by the time he got to this album (he already had several Wu solo records under his belt), is very experimental. He plays with the tempo of the chorus on &quot;For Heaven's Sake,&quot; and works with a live violin melody on the banging opener, &quot;Reunited.&quot; Though after this project, RZA seemed to run out of ideas as a producer (at least GOOD ideas), the work here is of good, if inconsistent, quality.<br />There really are a lot of good songs here, however. The piano-laced &quot;Older Gods&quot; thumps along nicely, as does the album's single, &quot;It's Yourz,&quot; with a multi-beat drum track and driving sample. The Inspectah Dek-produced &quot;Visionz&quot; is one of the album's quiet highlights, and &quot;As High as Wu-Tang Get&quot; is short-but-sweet, as GZA spits &quot;People saying that the songs we make is too long/Let's make it brief, son/Half short and twice strong.&quot;<br />The second disc contains some of my favorite tracks. The second single, &quot;Triumph,&quot; is an all-Clan posse cut featuring a deep bass hit and good verses from the members. Ghostface and Raekwon drop another tight crime narrative in &quot;The M.G.M.,&quot; and Ol' Dirty drops in for the impossibly chauvinistic-but-hilarious &quot;Dog S&amp;$!,&quot; another of his odes to project women.<br />My favorite tracks here are &quot;Bellz of War,&quot; whose familiar beat is accented by dark keyboards and bells, and &quot;The Projects,&quot; whose looped piano and chopped beat will have you rockin' back and forth in the ride.<br />As I mentioned before though, there are more than enough disappointing moments. A lot of the songs here are simply Wu-By-Numbers, nothing fantastic in either production or verse. Overall however, this album was well worth the price.
006092988X|5.0|I first read this book when I was eleven, and it profoundly influenced both how I see the world and my awareness of inner experience.  In the past fifteen years, I have read the novel at least eight times and it has shaped the way I approach my chosen career fields of Psychology and Sociology.  Each time I flip through, I draw new connections from the story about the development of America's white immigrant population, women's roles in society, and the advantages and challenges that sprout from public education.  However, my gut emotional reaction to the book never changes; it will always make me laugh and cry!
B00005O3VD|4.0|I was fortunate enough to see the theatrical re-release of this refurbished print in Los Angeles last month, and I must say the DVD does it full justice.  The incredible dye-tranfer Technicolor print has been faithfully mastered, and the six-track digital sound makes the original six-track mag tracks sound properly bright and full.  This film introduced movie audiences to the powerful Barbra Streisand, and everything was designed in this production to show her off the best way possible.  Her performance is alternately heart-breaking, hilarious, and resoundingly musical.  This is one of her best screen performances, and holds up very well after 33 years.  The drama is appropriately weepy, the comedy amazingly specific, and the musical sequences (directed by the late Herb Ross) are superb examples of how musical cues can work on film when handled correctly.  This picture is a lush slice of nostalgia that is a full, satisfying evening of entertainment.  The only thing keeping me from handing this DVD a 5-star rating is the lack of commentary on alternate tracks, no trailers for the film, and no footage of the excised pieces of &quot;The Swan&quot; ballet parody.  It's too bad Sony couldn't have spent some more time and money to make it a genuine collector's item.  But the film, and the performance, stand up easily to the test of time - they look and sound better than ever!
0671027379|5.0|what can i say?  i&#8217;m quickly becoming a fan of dan brown.  i heard him on the radio in los angeles a few years ago and tried out his first - digital fortress.  pretty good. then there was angels + demons &#8211; an absolutely mind-blowing read, after which i knew i&#8217;d read anything else he wrote (i felt the same after ludlum and bourne identity).  now deception point&#8230;wow.  brown&#8217;s new one doesn&#8217;t have the historical depth of angels + demons, but it works on so many unexpected levels that it&#8217;s hard to know where to start to describe it.  the politics is seedy and gripping, the techy delta force stuff is mega-hip and well-done, and the plot surprised me over and over.  what i like best is brown&#8217;s writing style: compact chapters that make you keep flipping, smart conversations, good non-fiction info, awesome pace, behind-the-scenes secrets &#8211; all stuff i like.  i always hear thrillers described as &#8220;you-can&#8217;t-put-it-down&#8221;, but honestly brown is the only author i&#8217;ve read where that is literally true.  i read deception point in a day. the setting (d.c. and north pole), although not my personal favorite (i preferred rome) was actually portrayed with so much insider info that it made me feel like i&#8217;d never read a book about d.c. or the arctic before (and i&#8217;ve read a few). i learned a lot about nasa and our space-related national security strategy.  a real eye opener. (...) i think i&#8217;ve found my new ludlum.

B000002HMH|2.0|I'm not going to poo all over Metallica because they deserve a lot of respect for what they did in the 80's.  How ever, I will fart in there general direction for everything they've done since 91, this album included.  It is not very metal.  It's more like Young Bob Segar on crack.  It doesn't inspire me to bang my head, kill my parents, start doing drugs and worshipping the devil like metal is SUPPOSED to do.  No, it makes me want to listen to FM radio and sing along with Lit, SUM 41 and Blink 182.  At least those bands are consistant.  This CD is not worth your time if you are a fan of Master, Ride, Kill or Justice.  But if you're a fan of those you already know that.
B00005QG9J|5.0|A lot of people said that this was gonna be a mix of Make Yourself and S.C.I.E.N.C.E, damn were they wrong, this is yet a new style for Incubus that is very similar to Drive on their last album. If you're expecting constant mosh-able songs, then you'd be disappointed, if you're expecting an album with a stronger emphasis on lyrics then their last albums (don't get me wrong, they were very intelligent and had more of a balance of music and lyricism)you're in for a treat.<br />All the songs on the album are very unique, &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; with it's obvious oriental-style origin and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; gettin' back to the classics, this album is sure to please everyone.
0767824571|5.0|The boys from Monty Python have done it, made the funniest movie of all time. From Taunting French men to dancing knights of Camelot.  This movie is tearjerking fun.  It is ten times better than Life of Brian and the Flying Circus.  A movie that might make you wet yourself and ask for more.  A must see, must own movie and dvd.
B000002HFU|4.0|Some people are just not ready for Ol' Dirty Bastard.<br />NO ONE was ready for him when this album came out. They only knew him as the guy who did a little screaming and a little rapping on &quot;Enter the 36 Chambers.&quot; Little did they know that Russell Jones would go on to become the next Clown Prince of Hip-Hop. &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers: The Dirty Version&quot; is bangin', offensive, noisy and hilarious all at the same time.<br />Almost entirely RZA-produced, the tracks on this album are unlike any other. Melodies shift and mutate into one another, sometimes changing into totally different entities. Some beats roll along; others are choppy and distorted. Similarly, Dirty's flow goes from sing-songy to balls-out roaring in seconds.<br />He pays homage to soul-crooners of the past on &quot;Drunk Game (Sweet Sugar Pie),&quot; name-checking Gladys Knight, the Temptations and Marvin Gaye while he rants and raves and practically has an orgasm mid-song. He leads insane sing-along chants in songs like the single, &quot;Shimmy Shimmy Ya&quot; and the BANGIN' &quot;Brooklyn Zoo,&quot; where he lets you know, &quot;Shame on you/When you step through to/The Ol' Dirty Bastard/BROOKLYYYYYN ZOO!&quot;<br />There are plenty of great songs here. &quot;Baby C'mon&quot; shifts from hardcore and grimy to a slick bass loop midway through, and &quot;The Stomp&quot; is just what its title suggests: a hardcore, concrete-breaking beat and some typical Ol' Dirtyisms: &quot;Baby girl/Tell me why, tell me so/I ask you to go hiiiigh, you ask me to go low/So I go low/*SLURRRRP*/Taste the sheeeeit/*SLURRRRP*/Taste it again, I like it!&quot; ...what do you say about lyrics like that??<br />Some of the best songs pair Dirty with fellow Clan members, however. On the nasty &quot;Damage,&quot; ODB mixes it up with Raekwon and Method Man. He gets with Meth again on one of my favorite tracks, the short and low-key &quot;Dirty Dancin'.&quot; And he teams up with the RZA on the &quot;Clan In Da Front&quot;-in-reverse, &quot;Cuttin' Headz,&quot; tag-teaming some great lines with the Clan's uber-producer.<br />There are a couple of low moments, where either the production could use a little shoring up, but for the most part, &quot;Return to the 36 Chambers&quot; is an off-kilter, offensive, chauvinistic, mysogynistic, hilarious album, and well worth your money if you like hip-hop, comedy and skills.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Yes, our dear band incubus has matured a ton from the angry band we first saw in &quot;fungus amongus&quot; (remember lyrics such as &quot;don't you make fun of me....gonna be a hot dancer&quot; ?)to the laid back band we see in &quot;morning view&quot;. Incubus has had time to develop and let their sound ripen, and boy has it ripened here. With the hit song &quot;Wish you were here&quot; and many others, incubus has developed the perfect &quot;sit back and just relax&quot; cd, keeping the intensity of their old cds, but mixing in a whole bunch of mellowness. Morning view is a perfect name for this cd. Just think of looking out on the Pacific Ocean early on during the day, and you get the feeling of this cd! Enjoy!
1883217040|5.0|Have you ever heard a solo and wondered &quot;Where did he get that?&quot; ?<BR>Well, this book tells you!! Great book, couldn't live without it.<BR>Well structured, with a lot of information but it never sounds like he is talking &quot;over your head.&quot;
0380733358|5.0|this was hands down the best book by Ken Follett or anyone else i have ever read. this is the first and only book I have not been able to put down. it is a must read!
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is more like a ten star ablum, than a five star.  _Morning_View_ has some of Incubus' best material to date.  \\"Blood On the Ground\\", \\"Warning\\", and \\"Have You Ever\\" are some great rock songs in the tradition of Incubus' last two albums.<br />However, I enjoy this album much more for the slower, more medlodic songs such as \\"Mexico\\" and \\"11 AM\\".  These songs are absolutely phenomenal.<br />Overall, the album is fantastic, in my opinion, their best thus far.
0767903854|5.0|This book is great!  I don't think I have ever laughed as much while reading a book.  I have had to close the book and compose myself just so I could continue!  Really, Bill Bryson writes an excellent book.  Besides all the laughter, you learn some very interesting things along the way about Australia's history, flora, fauna, people, etc. etc.  If you get a chance, grab a copy of this book and settle in for a wonderful read.
B000023VR6|5.0|The vocals and lyrics in this CD make it a great Album...If you don't own it, buy it. If you buy it listen to it. If you listen to it memeorize it. Trust me soon it will be your most favorite CD.
B00005MP58|1.0|I had been waiting to get this DVD because it was supposed to be such a good edition.  I am sorry that I gave away my video set, because there is something wrong with this transfer/remastered edition.  The colors are so washed out, that in some cases the faces are white, really white.  I believe I will seek to get my money back if I can.  Very disappointing.
B00005LQ04|5.0|This is, by far, one of the best suspense-horror films of all time. And the new dvd transfer does a perfect job of capturing the color, clarity, and most important, the sound. Dario Argento is at his peak in this tale of murder and madness, and this two-disc set showcases the master of the giallo. The bonus sountrack by Goblin provides the perfect background for Halloween night, or any other dark and stormy eve. Get your copy today!!
B00005MP58|1.0|This has to be a mistake/a defective DVD.  The colors are very messed-up.  They are so washed out, faces appear to be white, very white, not flesh colored at all. I want my money back!!!
B00005R87Q|5.0|The Fast and The Furious, is the ultimate movie. With Paul Walkers sexy voice and his intelleget acting skills it makes it the best movie of all times. The best part of the movie for me would of been when all the cars lined up on the street. Everyone should see this movie as it is not just a chick flick!
B00005NZJX|3.0|man not that difrent form the reguler and it inky has 19-2000 video its not that good
B00002ND77|5.0|This  movie  is  a  great  testimony  to  what  truth  was  about!  Spike  Lee did  a  tremendous  job  and  lots  of  good  work  in  getting  this  movie  out. Densel Washington  deserved  to  win  the Oscar  as  best  actor,  to  be  denied  is  an  understatement.  Malcolm X  was  a  man  of  truth  and  honesty.  He  did  not  let  lies  and  misrepresentation lead  him   astray  from  the  truth.   Thank  you  Spike for  your  courage  in  bringing  this  to  the  light!  Densel  and  the  rest  of  the  actors  and  actresses who  played  major  roles  did  so  with  character !!!  You  all are  winners !!
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is the best album Incubus has recorded and it may very well be the best rock record of 2001. Very impressive.
B00005NWRS|4.0|First of all I think Ryan Adams is extremely talented and that Gold is definitely worth buying. However, in my humble opinion the CD should have featured fewer tracks. &quot;Firecracker&quot;, &quot;Answering Bell&quot;, &quot;La Cienega..&quot; &quot;Stars Go Blue&quot;, &quot;Touch Feel and Lose&quot; (wow!) are among the real highlights for me but this CD didn't immediately grab me like Heartbreaker did --there are too many songs that should have been left behind. For instance, I can do without &quot;Tina Toledo&quot;, &quot;Somehow, Someday&quot; and &quot;Enemy Fire&quot;. Also, &quot;New York&quot; sounds like Bob Dylan warmed over to me.<br />Buy this album or don't, but definitely don't miss his live show. It puts anything Ryan records to shame.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|This was the best movie, in music, and keeping my attention.  It made me laugh, cry and it was an emotional roller coaster of fun.  It was one of the best movies I have ever seen.
B000002I97|5.0|When I was in college one of my favorite songs was &quot;your flag decal won't get you into heaven any more&quot;.  Now that I am a crusty old fart (to paraphrase Utah Phillips) I find the song more relevant than ever.  Who says we learn from our mistakes?
0316921173|5.0|Wallace proves that he is one of the smartest, if not THE smartest, authors around today. Infinite Jest covers every topic from complex mathematics, the troubles of gifted teenage athletes, drug addiction, the influence of the media, and things I probably didn't even notice. It looks huge and intimidating, but once I started I couldn't stop. Wallace's style is laugh-out-loud funny with occasional pauses for awed contemplation. And let's not forget the footnoted footnotes to the novel. A must have for anyone seeking to understand contemporary literature, and anyone willing to be humbled in the face of greatness.
B00005QG9J|5.0|What an ear full! Incubus has definitely come a long way since 'Fungous Amongous.' 'Morning View' takes its audience through the twists and turns of personal relationships to some downright great stories! 'Morning View' is masterfully mixed and varietized with great pulsing rock sounds to softer ballads and everything in between. I found it didn't rock as hard as 'Make Yourself,' but spontaniety is what most people dig about Incubus. In the end, if you find yourself bobbing your head to, &quot;11AM&quot; or &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; don't be surprised. If the soul can't be felt from, &quot;Echo,&quot; consider your humanity. All in all, I was thoroughly pleased with the distorted waves of air that vibrated from my speakers.
B00005NWRS|3.0|Ryan Adams can write some great tunes, no doubt. Songs like &quot;Factory Girl&quot; from the late lamented Whiskeytown attest to that.<br />Quite unfortunately, Ryan has taken to hanging out with the likes of &quot;Atlantis&quot; Morrissette, who is thanked on the CD jacket like 30 times. Even more unfortunate is the fact that they are writing songs together. It's like 10,000 spoons when all you need is a knife.<br />I will give Ryan the benefit of the doubt and take my time with this one. Maybe it'll grow on me. But after several listens I am pretty sure I will never feel the way about &quot;Gold&quot; that I did about &quot;Stranger's Almanac&quot;....from the first spin I knew that was a work of greatness...this one just doesn't grab me.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this album is what we have come to know of incubus.  there is not a single bad song on the album and it keeps you going all the way to the end.  Topping Make Yourself was going to be no easy feat...but i'd put Morning View very close to it.  Just buy the cd.
B00004XQ83|5.0|The staggering success of this soundtrack is a very encouraging sign. In the age of packaged, sterile commercialism in the music industry, this record is, to say the least, a breath of fresh air. A who's who of the acoustic circuit shine under the direction of T Bone Burnett. There are so many highlight's here and something for everyone to enjoy. I have been a long time John Hartford fan and I am delighted he was included here--RIP John...<BR>Also, I must mention-I just discovered a wonderful new CD that lover's of O' Brother would certainly enjoy and deserves our support-----&gt; Danny Barnes &amp; Thee Old Codgers-Things I Done Wrong.(formerly of the Bad Livers).John Hartford was evidently a big fan of Danny's and I can't say enough about this group. Both titles are must buys! Take care y'all...
0440234743|3.0|While I found this book to be amusing and fairly interesting, I really don't agree with other reviewers that say that this ranks with Grisham's best works so far.<br />The least 'legal' of his 'legal thrillers', this in none the less a good read. Characters are sympathetic, the story is imaginative and interesting. The setting in the Amazon is greatly described and draws you in. The ending...well, I think the ending is the weakest part in the book -- not compromising or brave, it is too simple and to wishy-washy for me.<br />I've read all of Grisham's books (well, not including Painted House), and I have to say that second to Street Lawyer, this is probably his least successful effort.
0375703861|4.0|This was a very interesting read for me because mid way through it, I had convinced myself that I didn't really like this book, but would drag myself through it because all of my really smart friends said it was good.  By the time I finished it, I realized they were right.  While I think the story was sluggish at points, this epic shared memorable characters with fascinating histories.  The author uses language in a very gifted manner overall, and delivers a saga that is well worth reading.  She was able to combine race, religion, family and a plethora of other difficult and topics into a meaningful story.  I did end up feeling glad I read this novel, and look forward to seeing how I will like her next.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I listened to Diana Krall from the beginning, her &quot;Stepping Out&quot; album accompanied by Ray Brown et al was excellent, making her one of my favorite Jazz singers.<br />I don't know if it was her first album being so hard to beat or herself trying to appeal to a wider audience, after &quot;Stepping out&quot; it was all down hill from there.  She gradually turned from pure Jazz to this album, which is pure elevator muzak.  Reminds me of Harry Connick Jr.<br />The Look of Love is okay as a pop album, but it has no soul.  Dusty Springfield was all pop but her version of the song &quot;The Look of Love&quot; had soul, and Diana did not even come close on that one.<br />Overall, I think she could do much better than that.  I wish she could goes back to her root and start playing jazz again.  I doubt if she would do that though as this album would attact a lot of new fans thinking this is Jazz.
B00005QG9J|5.0|First thing I have to declare: This is my ultimate favorite band. So you're asking &quot;What the hell makes them so great from others?&quot; Well what other band is so diverse, so intelligent, and so unbelievably talented than Incubus? &quot;Morning View&quot; is another great album that I'm so proud to own. I don't necessarily have a favorite album of theirs because their talent and musical ingenuity has grown up from their roots, which is also very good. <BR>    Oh and don't listen to others who say they're sell-outs. They aren't and you know it so please dont succumb to other people's thoughts. I mean hey, if you honestly think that don't read this. But if you're not sure, don't just not buy it because of some else's idea. Think for yourself and make yourself. <BR>    So just get this CD, be happy, and shut up so you don't block out the sound.
014028009X|5.0|About three months ago I went to the movies to watch &quot;The Bridget Jones's Diary&quot;. I simply loved the picture! Bridget is so funny and, at the same time, she has something that connects all the women in the world to her. Maybe it's the way she cares about her weight, or because she's always unhappy with her job, or even her lack of boyfriends.<BR>After watching the movie, my best friend gave me the book and the CD of &quot;Bridget Jones&quot;. I told him that he could not have given me a better present. I read the book in three days, and soon after finishing it, I bought the second one, &quot;Bridget Jones: the edge of the reason&quot;, which is also really funny, but different from the first one.<BR>Well, &quot;Bridget Jones's diary&quot; tells the story of a woman named Bridget Jones, who lives in London and is thirty-something years old. She doesn't have a boyfriend, and her mother is always trying to arrange a date with some guy she doesn't know. She's also a little overweight, and that's a huge problem to her, as she's always on a diet (even when she doesn't need one). She smokes a lot, and drinks a lot too. She can't quit any of these habits, although she always says that she will.<BR>And that's the story. As you may see, there's nothing of exceptional. But that's why the book is so interesting. What happens to Bridget may happen (and already happens) to any girl in this world. Highly recommended!
0385474547|2.0|This book is about a time in Africa right before the white people came and settled in Africa with their christianity,and other beliefs that wasn't coherent with the original inhabinents life style.  this book takes a look at the african life-style and the changes it was forced to go through in its adjustments to white people and their beliefs.  this book makes you look through the eyes of one man, that mans name is Okonkwo.  Okonkwo was an abusive, violent, powerful, and vengeful. Okonkwo never knew love, compassion, and understanding. let's imagine a time when people act like savages and do what they want with no repercussions and you will have the same story line as this book.  This book opened my eyes to what life could be like if we weren't civilized and had didn't have common sense.  In my view and opinion this book is not for people with short attention spans or just have to do it for a class assinment.
B00003CX5P|3.0|It seems that George Lucas and crew must have been thinking &quot;Wouldn't it be cute if?&quot; thousands of times in making this movie.  Its almost more Barney than Star Wars.  Unfortunately it takes alot of the seriousness out of the movie, and pushes aside what could have been more interesting plot issues.  <br />Who is the Trade Federation?  Why has the Senate approved their taxation of trade routes?  Why is the Trade Federation blockading Naboo?  None of these questions are answered, other than maybe its all part of Darth Sidious' plan.  The story doesn't even establish the level of respect that Palpatine should have in the Senate.  Instead we get answers to questions like &quot;What would happen if Jar Jar stuck his tongue in the power coupling on Anakin's pod?&quot;<br />Despite my complaints about the movie, it is now part of Star Wars.  The light sabre duel is amazing, and the pod race is fun.  The special effects are great.  But the story leaves alot to be desired.  <br />Star Wars (not episode anything, but the original 1977 movie) is still, and probably always will be my favorite.  It is the only movie in the series that can completely stand alone.  It also took its story very seriously, which is what really drew the audience into the picture.<br />As far as the DVD itself, it looks great, EXCEPT, the folks at THX used way too much edge enhancement in many scenes.  This will make no difference to those who do not fully understand the quality benefits of DVD, but to those of us who know, the halos around characters heads, and other high contrast objects are very annoying.  I suspect this is a result of using the same master for the DVD as was used for the VHS tape.<br />For those considering purchase, the DVD is available for less elsewhere, so shop around.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus finally hit it big with 'Make Yourself', and most bands follow-up their breakthrough record with something similar, and some even &quot;sell-out&quot;.....but not Incubus!  With songs like Warning!, Mexico, Wish You Were Here, and Transmission, you'll love the new and improved step foward!  I think that Warning! will be a single with-in the next year........Treat yourself(dont make yourself) to Morning View!
B000001FCB|5.0|There's nothing more I can add to the title of this review. Elis Regina really is PERFECT! What a voice! Incredible!
B0000027I6|5.0|I listened to this album (CD) 1,000 times with headphones on and could not believe how incredible it was. I thought &quot;Pros and Cons&quot; was amazing and this album is within centimeters of that. An incredible listen which gets better each time I hear it.
0790733897|5.0|Steve McQueen, though he's been gone for more than twenty years, strikes me as the kind of actor that Hollywood doesn't seem to have anymore: cool, low-key, professional, almost business-like.  And the best example of this is in BULLITT, one of Hollywood's best police dramas ever.<br />McQueen is a San Francisco cop assigned by a rather ruthless politico (Robert Vaughn) to guard a mob witness for the weekend at a hotel near the Embarcadero.  But when two hitmen break in and shoot the witness (who later dies) and one of McQueen's partners, it is his duty to find the shooters and keep Vaughn off his back.  Driving around in his Dodge Charger, McQueen spots the two hitmen, resulting in what remains perhaps the single most hair-raising car chase in cinematic history.<br />Although the killers bite the dust at the end of the chase, McQueen learns that the man who was shot at the hotel was actually a decoy, NOT the real witness.  Even more, the decoy's wife has been killed in San Mateo by that witness.  McQueen and his partner (Don Gordon) learn that the witness plans to skip town, but they corner the man at San Francisco International Airport in a taut, action and suspense-laden finale.<br />Though it may seem old-fashioned, released as it was in 1968, BULLITT is superb entertainment, incisively helmed by British director Peter Yates and excellently photographed on location by master cinematographer William Fraker.  Lalo Schifrin's classic jazz score gives this film the perfect atmosphere, and Frank Keller justly won an Oscar for his film editing--including, of course, the 11-minute, 115 mile-per-hour car chase.  McQueen is, of course, so cool under fire, and Vaughn is ruthlessness personified.<br />Not too terribly violent (the mature 'PG' rating is in effect here), BULLITT remains a benchmark action movie.  Fans of classic action films should not miss this.
B00005BL2A|3.0|This isn't their best(Music For The Masses or Violator?) but it has two classic Depeche Mode tracks on it in 'I Feel Loved' and 'I Am You'. Those two make this album well worthwhile. As usual Dave Gahan and Martin Gore's voices combine beautifully producing a sound heard nowhere else in music. Haunting.
B00005JKHN|4.0|First of all, this movie should not be titled Sleeping Beauty, instead it should be The Three Fairies vs. Maleficent.  Even though the plot does in fact revolve around Princess Aurora, and the mess she unwittingly creates, she is little more than a victim.  The same goes for the prince, although he does rescue this victim (with MUCH help from the fairies).  But that's okay, the classic Disney films have a way of giving the spotlight to what should be side characters.  Perhaps sticking to the original plot would be just too uninteresting anyway.  This said, the film has some very beautiful scenes, and I don't recall an abundance of hateful musical numbers, which in my book is a good thing!  Nice animation, decent plot that does not drag, except for the scenes that take place in the castle while the Princess is in her exile; there are some scenes that take place between the two Kings that needed to be edited.  At the same token there are scenes with the fairies and Maleficent, both suspensful and humorous that more than make up for the staler moments.  Overall, not to be missed for adults and children!  By the way, this one deserves 4.5 stars but you know how the rating system works!
0385335482|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has scored big with this book- Confessions of a Shopaholic. It is the ultimate pick-me-up!<BR>You find yourself endeared to Rebecca \\"Becky\\" Bloomwood, a 20-something writer at a financial magazine who hates her job and what it pays....but loves shopping! She is a compulsive shopper, she just can't resist that D&G scarf, those numerous bottles of Oddbins...and stationary? Well, just had to have it!<BR>Those 6 words are what Rebecca lives by. Yet, what is absolutely hilarious is that she recognizes she has a problem, and she even tries to strategize to solve it (cutting back, making more, saving, even working an extra job!), but she can't, until...<BR>Well, you'll just have to read it's greatly surprising ending.<BR>And, as a note Ms. Kinsella, I will be the first to buy your next book!
B000021XS0|5.0|You know this deserves five stars. The music on this album is on a very high level.  Firstly, they bring back the melodies off Metropolis 1 on Images and Words onto this album on seperate songs. That in itself is an accomplishment.  I see a lot of bad reviews.... Beautiful, thematic, symphonic, these are words that can be used to describe this album.  The sheer thought it takes to somehow string all your albums together in a plot is mindboggling.  BUY THIS YOU WONT REGRET IT!!
630575067X|4.0|Ok I really do not need to tell you what this movie is about. It's Star Wars!!! My only problem with this movie is that I bought it way back before the dvd came out. I would buy the DVD instead of the VHS.
0061040967|5.0|&quot;The Last Hero&quot; is the delightfully illustrated story of an aging hero's final quest and the race to stop him as his quest will, unfortunately end the world. For anyone who has read the Discworld Novels it is features many well known characters complete with Paul Kidby's excellent pictures. Anyone new should be able to pick it up quite well without prior knowledge of the characters. Some of the more famous in the book are: Cohen the Barbarian, a ninety-ish year old hero who is experienced at not dieing (featured resplendant on the cover with sword and walking stick), Rincewind, an almost reliigiously devoted coward, who, has the misfortune of always having to save the Disc, Carrot Irondoundersson, a six foot plus captain of the Watch, technically a dwarf who once  came down from the mountains with an ancient and very sharp sword, a crown shaped birthmark and a great amount of zeal which he put into his work. Many other characters feature, some known, some not known all picked up perfectly by Paul Kidby. The pictures feature full and double pages as well as portraits of characters, small detail and the technical plans of Leonard of Quirm, the Disc's greatest inventor and artist. A great book.
B000002V0Q|5.0|I am impressed. Dave's finest work is right here. There are actual hooks, and not just fast riffs to bang your head to. Don't get me wrong, the old albums were great, abd they had melodic, but all of them were fast. Here the tempo is slowed down. I guess it was rehab or something. Also, there is great political commentary. Symphony of Destruction is about how our society is falling apart. Capptive Honor is about our rigid court system. Some great solos too. Glad they chose Marty. Check out his solo in Foreclousure of a Dream. It's very uplifting. The best is the title track. Very good hook. Also, check out the Iron Maiden-like solo. Cool. Very enjoyable.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Well, what can I say besides 'Album of the Year 2001'.  This new Incubus album could almost be described as a masterpiece of rock.  And no, Incubus is not a nu-metal band either.  This cd has some of the most inspired and atmospheric cuts since Lateralus.  A lot of hardcore Incubus fans such as myself will say that Incubus has finally sold out.  This is far from the truth.  It is true that &quot;Morning View&quot; has some songs that don't quite sound like anything else that Incubus has released.  Tracks such as 11am, Mexico, Echo, and the incredible Aqueous Transmission are very untypical of the funk/thrash songs from SCIENCE and Enjoy Incubus.  Mexico and Aqueous Transmission have incorporated Oriental string music and orchastration in them, and very well too.  Selling out is not a possibility because the quality of these new songs speak for themselves.  And the old school Incubus fans such as myself won't be disappointed either.  Jams such as Circles, Blood on the Ground, Have you Ever, and Under my Umbrella show that the band still has the 'artsy thrash' that made them popular years ago.  All in all this album shows that the band and their music has matured while still sticking to the roots.  Lets just hope they don't get 'too much' MTV play, I don't want Brandon treated like a member of a boy band.  This is a cd that gets better with each listen, so pick it up and enjoy Incubus!
B00004TH83|5.0|Introduced to Lara Fabian by, of all things, a PBS special, I was caught by this beautiful young woman first singing in Portuguese and then tearing my heart out in French.  Little did I know she had written most of what she was performing.  I was stunned by her versatility and power.  So I bought the disc, and what an incredible surprise.  &quot;Lara Fabian&quot; is a soaring sampler of this young woman's talents.  Comparisons to Dion and Streisand are inevitable, but this woman has more.  Many years ago, I'd have a last drink in a Village dive where the then unknown Streisand sang the late shift, after a stripper and stand-up comic.  We would remark what an incredible voice, but what a homely babe.  But here, we have everything a beautiful, classically trained musician, writing her own music, blessed with a voice that can reach to the heavens or drop to the deepest, huskiest parts of hell.  Fabian can sound like the young Steisand, but this young woman's uncanny power, passion, range and discipline suggest much more. Thanks to her Scilian-born mother and Belgium father, this woman's been trained as a musician from the age of eight. Could these parents have guessed at the potential of their child?  This is a unique artist.  Incredible.
B00005QG9J|4.0|I dunno about most of y'all out there but I've been somewhat disappointed in most of what he's been hearing lately from so called rock bands.  Morning View has def. revived my faith in rock groups.  With most of modern rock bands floppin on their follow up to their big hits in my opinion Incubus brings you what you want while not sounding stale.  I'm sure y'all heard Wish You Were Hear so I don't have to tell you how good it is, Warning is an awesome song, great lyrics, great music.  Song# 13 (i forget the title right now) is an awesome trip down the river of music. I'm not selling the rest of the songs short, but this album has what I've been lookin for in a new release by a band on the high-tails of a smash album (Make Yourself).  Personally I think this album is a lot better than Make Yourself.  SO STOP SLEEPIN AND GET IT!!!
B000056K04|3.0|When I first bought this CD I thought it was pretty good. However, it didn't take me long to realize that this is probably one of DMB's worst albums. Why? Musically it just doesn't have it! All you have to do is listen to older stuff or any live album to realize that this is NOT the DMB we all know and love! Don't get me wrong the words of &quot;the space between&quot; are awesome, &quot;angel&quot;, &quot;everyday&quot; and &quot;if i had it all&quot; are good songs but where is the rest of the band?????  I miss the sax and drums of the older stuff and WHERE THE HECK IS BOYD????????? <BR>I think the worse decision made was NOT to release the Lillywhite album. THOSE are DMB songs!!!!!!!!!! &quot;diggin a ditch&quot;, &quot;bartender&quot; and &quot;busted stuff&quot; are classic DMB.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus's, Morning View, is a really great cd. There are some great tracks on Morning View. My personal favorites are Echo, Warning, Blood on the Ground, Mexico, and, of course, I Wish You Were Here, their hit single. The songs on the album have great lyrics which actually mean something, unlike a lot of the bands around today. The guitar and &quot;instrumental&quot; music are amazing. They mix in the sounds of a DJ without having that rap-rock mix thing. They also incorporate different instruments, that you wouldn't ever normally hear. It gives the songs a great sound. Brandon Boyd's voice is amazing. He sounds great on this album. Basically, if you liked Make Yourself, and if you like Incubus at all, you will like Morning View.
6305363668|3.0|Not a well plotted movie, but so appealing visually - especially in the first 10 minutes - that it is hard not to like it.  <br />The Directors Cut was an improvement to the plot, with some very deft touches of character development and a more complex denouement. AND... stripping the voice over just makes the whole thing too quiet. Long silent stretches of actionless film that were carried by Ford's gorgeous voice now have me writhing in my seat with boredom.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Unlike his other albumns, Manson goes with a very souless approach to rock.  Drum machines, electronic voices, concept art, and his &quot;Bigger than Life&quot; rockstar lifestyle all come together in this well produced albumn.  The best thing about Manson is that he does whatever it takes to put on a great show!
B000002JR8|5.0|This is one of the first albums that got me into real, hardcore metal. All of the songs are so very intense, vulgar, and loud as hell. I have got to rave about this group. Then have been there as long as I remember, and they have just gotten better over the years. This gets da Seal.<br />-FM
B000021YQV|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I didn't care for the last album.<BR>This one however is light years ahead of the debut. Sonically it is phenominal, they got great sounds this time out.The songs are heavier and less quirky than the debut. There are some awesome heavy riffs with great grooves, however there are still some of the annoying (IMO) vocal interludes. Basically I tolerate these to get to the cool parts, fortunately those &quot;cool<BR>parts&quot; pay off big. Just saw them for &quot;Pledge Of Allegiance&quot;and they were outstanding live.
B00005QG9J|2.0|I was a huge Incubus fan.  SCIENCE still blows me away every time I listen to it.  It is incredibly creative and unique and on it, there is nothing slightly resembling a bad song.  After Make Yourself came out, it took a few listens to get into... not the same old incubus, but still damn good (although they could have chosen better singles for it).  So I decided to look into the funkier side of Incubus with Enjoy and Fungus Amongus... 2 awesome albums (a shame they never play them live).  <br />The buildup for Morning View was long in the making.  Everyone said it's supposed to be amazing, very hard, and even somewhat like SCIENCE.  Well, just to warn you, IT'S NOT.  This album has all the signs of an MTV band, and I fear Brandon is on his way to chilling with Carson and the rest of the pretty MTV people.  BOOOOOOOO!  I'm sure people will argue that just because an album isn't as hard doesn't mean it's no good.  But trust me:  there is no variety on this album.  The songs blend together; the melodies aren't interesting; the guitar parts show no style; the songs surely do not &quot;rock&quot; like those of the past; perhaps worst of all, Brandon's voice doesn't even sound that amazing anymore.  <br />Morning View is full of poppy, radio-friendly, waiting-to-be hits.  It is mediocre, which in the realm of quality music, is the last thing you want.  Surely, many will disagree with this low apraisal, and who knows?  Maybe it'll even grow on me (I shudder at the thought).  However, unless Incubus manages to shake this &quot;phase&quot; by their next studio release, I'll truly consider them a waste.  I guess we all should have known after all our parents started singing along to Drive.  <br />For now, the only reason this album doesn't get a 1-star rating from me is because there are still much more despised &quot;artists&quot; out there, naturally:  for example, Ja Rule, Garth Brooks, Fred Durst, Missy Elliot, Mark McGrath, and everyone's beloved Uncle Kracker (I won't bother to mention any boy &quot;band&quot; names).  Rest assured, however, that I'll be breaking out the big &quot;1-star&quot; for Incubus next time they put out an album this boring.
B00004STPT|5.0|The easiest and best way to know if a soundtrack is good is by watching the movie first and then buying the soundtrack -- and noticing if the listener can distinguish what scene of the movie should be playing with what piece of music.  &quot;Gladiator&quot; clearly and quite beautifully executes that, throwing you into the most harrowing and glorious parts of the film itself.<br />Hans Zimmer (&quot;The Lion King&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;) has written a film musical composition that is utterly enthralling with its hints of &quot;Lion King&quot; origin and addition of an exotic voice sang by Lisa Gerrard.  Her background vocals provide for a haunting and wonderfully executed musical experience.<br />The jewel of the record is its last track, &quot;Now We Are Free&quot;, beginning with an elaborate slowness that climbs its way up to an almost patriotic rhthym that creates goosebumps all around.  Other notable tracks include &quot;The Battle&quot; and &quot;The Might Of Rome&quot;, both which combine amazing musical acoustics to mental images from the film perfectly.<br />Hans Zimmer, unfortunately stolen of an Oscar from the 2001 Academy Awards (he lost to &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;'s composer Tan Dun), has created along with Gerrard a unique and powerful score that rivets as much as it enthralls.  Completely recommended!
0800141660|5.0|I am a huge Austen fan, and have seen all the movie adaptations.  This by far was the best.  Sense &amp; Sensibility, the book, was my least favorite of Austen's novels until I saw this movie; I've now reread it over and over, and find it delightful.  The casting was perfect (a rare thing among book adaptations); Emma Thompson as Elinor drew out all the nuances of her character, and helped me (finally) connect to the true meaning of the story.  All the other characters were wonderfully acted as well, even down to Lucy Steele.  Everything about this movie - the music, the scenery, the actors - blended so perfectly, I felt I was living in this circle, and a part of the events.
B000002N3J|4.0|Madonna's &quot;Something To Remember&quot; is quite that: something to remember.  Filled with her most popular (and, intriguingly, less known) ballads from her career, the album gives you that relaxing and peaceful record that you need in the background.  With a different mix of R&amp;B, dance, pop and acoustic, the tracks offer a wide range of slower songs that impress and entertain.<br />Ironically, the title track is one of the more weaker cuts of the album -- seemingly drowned out and droopy.  However, many of the unknown strengths of the album include &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;, a track that was taken from her &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; release and &quot;I Want You&quot;; both versions of &quot;I Want You&quot; featured on the album are excellent cuts, giving the listener a great variation of the song.<br />Of course, there remains her more larger hits like &quot;Take A Bow&quot; and &quot;Live To Tell&quot;, which remains her most amazing ballad to date with her incredibly deep voice and harmonic interaction with the music.  The two best chosen tracks, however, are those which should belong on the album and were, fortunately, chosen for the album.  What I mean is that the tracks would have probably never been considered for a greatest hits album, but fit along this record perfectly.  &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;, a song written for her movie &quot;A League Of Their Own&quot; and &quot;You'll See&quot;, a powerful ballad, are the two best chosen tracks that could be featured.  Each has their own personal way of displaying great emotional value with incredible music.  <br />All in all, &quot;Something To Remember&quot; is a beautifully orchestrated ballad collection with songs that do remind us of past times with ones that remind us of those more current.  Madonna has created an amazing album with graceful harmony.
B0000067X1|5.0|I read all the glowing reviews of this album, and I read about how Can was a really influential band, so I decided to give this album a try.<br />First of all, not much could have prepared me for this album.  The scratchy vocals remind me of Radiohead, and the long, dark songs remind me of Underworld.  But what makes Can especially good is the unrelenting beat.<br />The rhythms on Tago Mago are very addictive and I just can't get enough of them.  I could listen to *just the beat* for hours and be content.  That seems to be the theme behind Can's music anyway.  Can slowly but surely adds harsh guitars and synths and any other sound producing mechanisms they can get their hands on (dog barking?) and through them into the mix.  The drum beat always survives the onslaught to the end though.<br />The singing is raw, raw, raw.  Very scratchy and very schizo, sometimes there's chanting, and sometimes there's incoherent babbling.  The singer also seems to enjoy switching languages in the middle of songs and also singing backwards.  This sounds like it could sound annoying or bad, but it's actually very well done.<br />Tago Mago is like a bubbling primordial soup of raw music.  Since Can reduced rock music to a chaotic, minimalistic level, it's easy to see why most music could be claimed to be a derivitive of this style.  Tago Mago is overflowing with pure creativity.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I think the above summary from Amazon sums up very well what this band is all about.  I think they put together a GREAT album and I will play it a lot and never get tired of it.  The slowness of some of the songs is what makes the CD great. They are Good enough as a band to be able to stray away from all their songs sounding like the Radio hit.  I love all the songs...it just depends on the mood i'm as to which songs i want to hear at that moment.  ENJOY the CD...you won't be disappointed.
B000002C1V|5.0|If someone were to make a collection of the lyrically best albums ever recorded this album would be at the top of the list.  First as everyone else has said this is not a typical Floyd album. It doesn't flow like Floyd and doesn't really sound like any other of their material.  Roger wrote the entire thing and that of course is the main reason.  However it's still &quot;Floydy&quot;. Gilmore sounds great on his song and his guitar work is still crisp and it sound like a Floyd album as opposed to a Waters solo.  What set's this album above many other is the lyrics.  It reads like poetry with intelligence and heartfelt anguish.  The album, which is about war, grapples with how we should live our lives since WWII and in fact every other war ever fought.  Like \\"The Wall\\" Roger deals with personal struggles between people and their relations (The Final Cut.) He also comments on the modern trade system and the money struggles of the world in the albums lone \\"rocker\\", which is sung mostly by Gilmore (Non Now John.) The album ends with everyone on earth finally becoming equals since there are \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" and people have destroyed themselves.  It's a rallying call for peace (that Roger knows will never happen.) The sound is good it moves a little slow in parts but if you listen to it for a few times it'll build on you and you'll love it!
0316776963|5.0|Verry funny! I bought this book at the Seatac airport on my way to NYC...My first trip there since 'the disaster.' This book had me chuckling like a crazy women for 1000's of miles, taking the nervous edge off of my cross country flight (although i am not so sure how comforting this was for the stranger sitting next to me). I am now reading it a 2nd time, ordered 2 copies from Amazon for friends and the audio version for myself...I've also purchased all Sedaris' other books. So far this one is the funniest, but i adore them all. This guy is a hoot and he is smart. Highly recommend. ciao, Laurie in Alaska
B000002JKA|5.0|This album took a while to grow on me.  The first time I heard I nodded and thought it was good, not as good as Scenes From a Memory but good none the less.  Well after having it for a while I changed my mind.  This was sadly the last album Kevin Moore made while a member of Dream Theater, therefore this is the last album with truly great key's (ya Scenes was good but not up to this) and I think Moore was their best lyricist.  This is a great mood album; it ranges to heavy and angry to soft and beautiful, A great range of sound with DT's amazing speed and technical ability souring with emotion.  LaBrie's vox are some of his best putting everything he has into each song.  Plus it's a long over 70 min so you get your moneys worth. Over all a great album!

B0000028M7|5.0|Alice In Chains' seminal 1993 work Dirt is one of those engrossing albums that like all truly great works of literature, music, or film lets the listener enter and see a world that they would otherwise not have known about.  Most of the album's dark lyrics chronicle frontman Layne Staley's ongoing heroin addiction and the downfalls of it.  Staley's amazing voice and haunting vocal melodies along with Jerry Cantrell's awesome guitar work make this album worth buying alone, but the songwriting is excellent with the thunderous rhythm section of Mike Starr and Sean Kinney backing Staley and Cantrell, who both sing and play guitar here.  Cantrell wrote most of the music, and his tunes build a huge, multi-faceted atmosphere with flourishes and touches of classic rock influences and some truly great guitar work.  The songs are all excellent, with Cantrell writing lyrics to a few songs, like the Vietnam War ballad &quot;Rooster&quot; and the great tracks &quot;Would?&quot; and &quot;Down In A Hole,&quot; with its expansive lanscape, but it is Staley's strong &quot;Angry Chair&quot; which is perhaps the album's most powerful song.  If you don't check out this album, you'll only have yourself to blame.
0345440757|2.0|First, a warning: do not use this book as your only source for parenting. There are areas where she omits or misrepresents information in a way that I consider negligent and she is very quick to judge other parenting approaches as &quot;fads&quot; -- ironic for someone who resides in Los Angeles.<br />For example, in the section on breast feeding, she judges the benefits of breast feeding as &quot;overstated&quot;. She gives passing acknowledgment of current research on the benefits of breast feeding, but serves up the platitude &quot;but modern formulas are chock full of nutrients&quot; as sufficient reason to choose formula feeding, thereby diminishing the overwhelming consensus of research from around the world. She even calls the recent preference for breast feeding a fad, forgetting that formulas were invented within the last century while breast feeding has been around for a few million years. While the decision to breast-feed is extremely personal (and there are many good reasons to opt for formula feeding), I believe that a parent should at least be given all available information in order to make an educated decision. If you buy this book, make sure you also purchase an established parenting classic, such as &quot;Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care&quot; by Benjamin Spock, &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by William and Martha Sears, or &quot;Caring for Your Baby and Young Child&quot; by the American Academy of Pediatrics.<br />Her parenting approach can be illustrated by the example of infant sleep. The standard espoused by many current parenting classics is to progressively let the baby cry it out (the Ferber method). Dr. Sears offers the controversial opposite proposal of bringing the baby to bed with the parents. Miss Hogg labels both approaches as extreme, calling the Furber method &quot;cruel&quot; and coming close to outright labeling Dr. Sears as a fad. Perhaps Dr. Sears' methods are a fad, but at least he backs up his recommendations by citing scientific research regarding benefits to the infant -- research that Miss Hogg conveniently omits and, therefore, does not attempt to dispute. In fact, she takes considerable effort throughout the book to pejoratively label Dr. Sears' style as &quot;Kangaroo&quot; parenting (her quotes), but she never makes clear what is so negative about Kangaroos. Miss Hogg offers a compromise approach to infant sleep. In conjunction with setting up a daily routine, she suggests that you lay the infant down in her crib just as her eyelids are getting heavy. If the infant begins fussing or crying, offer comforts such as soothing talk or the touch of a hand, but do not pick up the infant. Unlike most parenting classics -- which tend to offer suggestions but encourage the parents to do whatever works -- Miss Hogg offers no alternatives and actually suggests that if these methods do not work, it is due to the parents' faulty execution of these methods. Some of the other reader reviews here suggest what can happen with this inflexibility.<br />Miss Hogg's recommendations regarding the establishment of a routine are the central focus of her book and her suggestions are well written, if rather conventional upon deeper inspection. She explicitly formalizes in more accessible terms what other parenting classics already preach in more general terms.<br />Generally, this book is geared towards parents who have great demands on their time and cannot afford the full-time parenting approach endorsed by most other books. The back cover hints at this: testimonials from people such as Greg Germann (star of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;) and Dana Walden (president of Twentieth Century Fox Television), but no endorsements from health care professionals. I believe that crafting a parenting philosophy is a personal and complex process, and a parent is entitled to make an informed decision. Although this book offers some good suggestions, it is not a reference-quality book with which to base such a difficult decision.search regarding benefits to the infant -- research that Miss Hogg conveniently omits and, therefore, does not attempt to dispute.

B000002LRX|5.0|I have read many a review on this site but have never really got around to writing one for myself as it is difficult to put this album into words. However, after reading so many other reviews by fans who worship this album, I realised that I just had to put in my two cents.<BR>Firstly, I had no idea that so many people love this album. In a world where unoriginal tripe is lapped up by the masses, its refreshing to know that there are still people who know a quality album when they hear it. Aah.<br />'Angel Dust' is a great eclectic mix of everything, with that great Faith No More twist. The three singles, 'Midlife Crisis', 'Everything's Ruined' and 'A Small Victory' are three undescribable, uncatergorizable songs. They are well worth the money alone. There are some harder songs, like 'Jizzlobber', 'Caffeine' and 'Malpractice', the latter being very reminiscent of Mr.Bungle (loaded with samples and tempo changes). 'Land of Sunshine' is a great track to sing along to and contains the most sarcastic lyrics in the history of mankind. 'Crack Hitler' is a totally funky tune with a twist in the middle (those who own the album will know what I mean). 'RV' is a good take on music, but sadly Mike's monologue ruins the subtlety of the joke. Excellent chorus and bridge though. <BR>As a bassist, I find this album is very impressive, especially in 'Land of Sunshine' (bass plays the main riff) and 'Kindergarten' (bass solo!). It also uses things that you would not normally hear in 'alternative rock' songs, like african chanting ('Smaller and Smaller'), cheerleading chants ('Be Aggressive') and horror violins ('Jizzlobber' - you'll know what I mean when you hear it). And, unlike other bands who try and do that sort of thing and fail miserably, these work really well.<BR>The final thing I have to say is that I usually hate it when bands put covers on albums. However, it is again different on 'Angel Dust'. 'Midnight Cowboy' offers a nice antidote after the frenetic 'Jizzlobber', andtheir version of 'Easy' (if you own the version tha has it) has become so well known that it is almost their own. Sorry to ramble, but this album is so good... It may take afew listenings to get used to, but it is worth it.

B00005Q5WC|5.0|A classic Bob Marley album gets the royal treatment with the release of this newly remastered and expanded addition of his masterpiece Exodus.  Present on this famous recording are all of what makes Marley one of music's greatest artists.  All of his styles are represented here and it never disappoints the listener.  From the free jam of Jammin'to the politic statements of the title track to the friendly chants of Three Little Birds, Exodus is one those special recordings.  It is still fresh, with a sound and style that feels like it was recorded yesterday.  With the addition of a second disc, the listener gets live cuts and other remixes, but in the end the original material is what really shines.  One of Marley's best.  Highly recommended to any<BR>Marley fan and to anyone who has never purchased an album from him, this is where to start.  Let the music live on, and let it satisfy your soul.  Essential to any music collection.

B000002UAX|5.0|Many times the question plaguing the White Album is, should it have been edited.  Whose to say.  The White Album in its true form is still a legendary musical monument. Sure there are four or five that while fun or artistic should havent had official release.  Not to mention, two tracks that should have made it, Paul's endearing &quot;Junk&quot; and George's awesome &quot;Not Guilty&quot;. Any nay sayer who bashes the White Album is more or less bashing it in comparison to the Beatles consensus masterpieces Sgt. Pepper, Revolver, Abbey Rd. and even Rubber Soul.  Nevertheless,<BR>White Album rightfully belongs with the latter four as 5 of the<BR>greatest 10 or 11 albums (ala VH1 countdown) ever. The White Album's weakness still shine above almost anything ever put out<BR>by anyone else in rock ever. The Beatles &quot;Filler&quot; as some may say, is certainly anyone elses hit. Think about it.<BR>  The White Album, is the personfication of musical depth.  Its been said a millon times. A definite blueprint rock album.  Just<BR>put it in perspective, it was 1968, 33 years erased, the naysayers of the White Album would sing another tune.
1577311760|5.0|E. Tolle's own reading of his work is well worth the purchase and investment in hearing, again and again.  His voice carries a presence and cannot be described only experienced.  The book is a wonderful read, but it invites the intellect, the mind, to intercede, interpret, contradict and to allow the reader to miss an underlying truth running like a gentle stream throughout the work.  Tolle's own reading, however, carries the reader like a fallen leaf, gently floating, observing and sensing the stream beneath and the world around.  <br />I listened to these tapes continuously on a three day cross-country drive.  And they have not been out of my vehicle during my daily 2 hour commute.  I have heard new things with each listening.  I have seen 'new' things in each commute. Perhaps I was simply ready, but hearing this has changed me and it has begun to change my life.

B00005QG9J|4.0|I must say I was impressed by how professional this CD sounds. I seems like Incubus is developing into a really talented band. The music here is not all as agressive as their previous work. I would think if you liked Make Yourself and can appreciate some creative musicialship you'll like Morning View.
0780631153|1.0|Someone put it best when they said &quot;that's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back&quot;.<br />Definitely a different movie, but fails to keep and catch your attention.  I'm usually into really strange/different movies, but this one did not do it for me. The acting was good, the end was pretty cool, but the &quot;story&quot; bored me - and three hours of boredom is not a good thing.<br />The movie constantly jumps around between storylines of different characters. I usually don't mind this, but in this movie it seemed to happen too much and seem pointless at times. By the end of the movie, I didn't really feel that anything had really happened, which is a real disappointment after three hours. This movie was also very depressing.<br />The end was the only redeeming quality.  One, because it ended.  Two, because the strange ending was the only part of the movie that evoked emotion out of me other than boredom.  I laughed my arse off.  If the ending had been the same, and the rest of the movie was condensed into a short story/skit of 20 minutes, I would have given it a 4/5, mostly for being so anti-Hollywood.<br />Sorry, but I'm not going to pretend to like this movie just because Hollywood and its critics are desperately trying to convince me it's great.  1/10.

B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park has totally changed the music scene in today's one-hit wonder world.  From their first release of One Step Closer to their latest, In the End, they have continued to rock.  Every song on this CD is play-worthy, even their 'weak' tracks like Points of Authority and Forgotten are still better than most bands top songs.  My personal favorite track is A Place For My Head - the lyrics will give you chills.  I wouldn't be at all suprised if all songs on the album are released.  Trust me, pay whatever you have to for this disk cuz its worth every penny.

B00003CXAA|5.0|Any discussion of great American cinema necessarily includes \\"The Godfather\\".  Remarkably, that same claim applies as well to \\"The Godfather, Part II\\"; and if Part III fails to reach the same lofty heights, it's still a must-see, if only to see how the story ends (I didn't necessarily need to OWN Part III, though).  Although Marlon Brando's historic performance will always brand him the Godfather, these movies are really about Al Pacino's Michael. In the early scenes, Michael stands aloof, neither condemning or praising his family's business, but accepting it for what it is, and knowing that for him there will be another way.  Yet the wounding of Don Vito reveals something that had never occurred to Michael.  He is the only one with the strength to carry on the family - Sonny's a hothead, Fredo's weak, and Tom - well, Tom is strong, but he lacks the iron will and has other important duties to take care of.  Coppola sets all this up perfectly - you can see the metamorphosis (of course, Pacino deserves no end of credit as well) unfold before your eyes.  Then there is the matter of Robert De Niro as the young Vito - a truly masterful performance revolving more around body language, gestures, and attitudes than words (one of the bonus features is a screen test by De Niro for Michael at the wedding - great stuff!).  The rest of the saga revolves around Michael's masterful consolidation of power, and his spiritual torment at the way he amassed it.  The weaknesses of part III are real:  they are primarily poor casting, and a script that was made up on the fly.  Still, had Coppola left the third part out, the whole thing would have been less complete.  The bonus materials are fine, but that's not why you need this collection - the films themselves are treasures all their own.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Morning View definitely exposes a more mature side of Incubus.  The album opens up with three songs that sound very much like ones you would find on Make Yourself: hard yet melodic.  Another marker in the album is the song &quot;Mexico.&quot;  Give this song a couple of months - it will permeate.  The acoustic guitar + Boyd's architecture in this song are like no other.  &quot;Just a Phase&quot; has some beautiful explosions, &quot;11 am&quot; has some of the best Boyd lyrics produced, and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; is another one to throw your friends around to.  &quot;Under my Umbrella&quot; is another hard one and my personal favorite.  Don't get me wrong, there are some slower tracks to be found - but this only enhances the quality of Morning View.  The rest of the songs on the album are for you to discover.  Incubus expands their limits and pushes their creativity in this newest release.  Some may see this album as a &quot;sell-out&quot; album, but if you appreciate diversification mixed with Incubus, it could end up being your favorite.   If you have been a fan since SCIENCE or are new to Incubus, don't even hesitate to get out and purchase this one.
1587990717|5.0|A highly unusual book, and an excellent read.  Nassim Taleb takes us through hilarious anecdotes and scathing attacks on conventional approaches to business, thought, and trading.  He covers Greek philosophers up to current journalists in a flowing, amused, and somewhat detached, analysis of success and failure.  The reader emerges from this inspired amalgam of lessons on risk and return both enlightened and satisfied.
B000002OOY|5.0|This is the most amazing, fantastic and superb Williams score ever. No Williams fan could rightfully claim to be so without this wonderful score in their collection. I have converted people from thinking film music is rubbish to being huge fans with this score - even if you don't like the film; even if you don't like film music; even if you have some sort of personal hatred for John Williams, you have absolutely no reason not to love this score.
0316776963|5.0|I'm not gay, and have never been to New York city, have only briefly visited France, never done speed.  Despite the differences between my life and Sedaris's, I found so much to relate to in this book!  The stupid things we do to fit in, the absurdity of our families, aggravation with ignorant or rude people... these are things all people can relate to.  And Sedaris has a way of telling stories that just make you laugh out loud.  I agree with the people that say you must hear him speak to fully appreciate it, though.  Being able to put that effeminate, sarcastic, weary voice, and the phrasing and emphasis that Sedaris uses with these words definitely enhances the experience.  Recommended to any and all!
B00005J9U1|5.0|An awesome mix from the best regae artist that (like jimmy cliff) was able to mix regae and soul in a way that gave birth to a style of music that has warmed the heart of millions and inspired just as many.<BR> This is the best compilation and newly mastered, of a man blessed with a gift that needs to be shared and never forgotten. Songs that have been added since &quot;Legend&quot; have found and deserved their place on this exceptional CD. <BR>If you don't own &quot;Legend&quot; you must own this, and if you do(and don't own anymore) and wan't more / Buy this !! Now !!
B00005J6UP|5.0|I had an opportunity to see this on DVD recently, and was happily reminded what a great movie it was!  A likable crew of misfits always appeals to me, and this movie's got them.  The childish goofiness is funny, Mikey's dreamy optimism is touching, and the adventure the goonies go on is exciting.  The acting is decent for such young kids.  The sets are cool, and the creepy gangsters are both menacing and funny.  The cut-scenes on the DVD aren't that great, though.  It's easy to see why they were cut.  The Cyndi Lauper video is amusing, featuring many 80's wrestling stars.  All in all, a good addition to the collection of any child of the 80's.
B00005QW5X|5.0|Wow!&quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; explodes from its opening scene and never stops! Wondefully written and performed, it is a work of art that trancends color, culture or gender.<br />  I first saw John Cameron Mitchell on broadway in the musical &quot;The Secret Garden&quot;. I loved his work then, but never could've imagined that he would later emerge as the powerhouse that is Hedwig. She is unforgettable!<br />  Part Scarlet O'Hara and part Terminator, Hedwig is a heroine (or hero) for the new millenium. John Cameron Mitchell plays her so flawlessly and furiously that soon we forget him and she becomes so real that when the movie ends we're left a bit sad that she was indeed a character. If Mr. Mitchell is not nominated for a best-actor Oscar/Golden Globe for this role (and wins), there is no justice. Although the film is not a #1 box office hit, I am hoping that he will get it on buzz alone, which was what got Hilary Swank her VERY deserved awards for &quot;Boys Don't Cry&quot;.<br />  The film's script is incredibly original and fresh. It also features clever symbolism. And it's real symbolism, you know the one audiences can actually follow. Not the kind that people tout as &quot;brilliant&quot; simply because they don't want to say &quot;Huh? I didn't get it.&quot; The whole East and West Berlin as a metaphor for Hedwig's search for her missing half is great.<br />  And then of course, there's the music. Wow, the music! No soundtrack has rocked with more honesty since Prince's &quot;Purple Rain&quot; or Bette Midler's &quot;The Rose&quot;. The lyrics are phenomenal as is the music, both by Stephen Trask. The songs are electric, sincere and humorous. Some of my favorites include; &quot;Tear Me Down&quot;, &quot;Wig in a Box&quot;, &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; and &quot;Midnight Radio&quot;. Mr. Trask deserves to be accepting some awards in this category since no movie this year has featured better music.<br />  So ignore any comparisons to &quot;Rocky Horror&quot; or &quot;Pricilla&quot;, while well intended,this work sands firmly on its own. It is unlike any other. Unique, brave, bold and extremely beautiful, Hedwig is a winner! Now I wonder if John Cameron Mitchell will release further recordings by Hedwig and the Angry Inch. I hope so.ror&quot; or &quot;Pricilla&quot;, while well intended,this work sands firmly on its own. It is unlike any other. Unique, brave, bold and extremely beautiful, Hedwig is a winner!

B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is great progression for Incubus from their last album.  &quot;Wish you were here&quot; will be a staple on the radio for a while but it is the softer, more acoustic songs that set this album apart.  Incubus goes seamlessly from a fast pace to a more mellow one in their songs in this album.  If you like there last album you will love this one.  It is really a naturaly progression from the last album, it is what you thought they would become two years later and is very smart.
B0000009S3|4.0|This remix is inferior to the original vinyl product. Frank should have left well enough alone,( Mr. Zappa did the remix). I too hope for a rerelease of the original mix. The emotion in the original has been muffled in the new  cd.

6305127638|3.0|I purchased this movie after seeing it at the theater.<BR>Like all Star Trek films it just plods along in its story line <BR>and general direction. Its almost predictable. As the old expression goes been there (seen that) done that.<BR>Attention was given toward the Borg and the special effects <BR>but only the beginning and the end of the story is worth its salt.<BR>Paramount NEEDS to get its head out of the sand and stop worrying about the bottom line first which is of course profits.<BR>IF and when they decide to put out a quality script as Star Trek 10 looks like it might be only then will the rest will fall into place. The current staff that presides and oversees Star Trek needs a BIG wake up call. <BR>Bring in the GOOD writers and directors and don't depend on those who lead Star Trek on TV because they're tired and out of any fresh ideas. <BR>If you doubt this then merely look at some of the considered scripts for prior films - most had no business even being submitted let alone serious though at being made.

0671449028|5.0|This book was not what I expected.  I thought I was buying something that would show a child going through the bedtime routine, from brushing teeth to reading a bedtime book.  Instead what I got was a whimsical poem that features animals on a boat before bedtime.  So, I was disappointed at first.  However, I can honestly say that my son adores this book.  He laughs all the way through it.  And when we get to the last verse, &quot;The moon is high, the sea is deep, they rock and rock and rock to sleep&quot; my son always lies down in his crib and grabs his blankie.  He knows that at the end of that verse it's time for his own bedtime.  So, the book worked after all!  It has eased the transition from wakefulness to sleep.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00000K31V|2.0|The story had good potential, but seemed way too low budget -- the pods had a very unsophisticated outer shell, etc.  Also, the acting, or rather overacting, left something to be desired.  The ending was a complete disappointment.
6302518393|5.0|From the moment I saw that adorable Saint Bernard pup, I was captivated.  I came away wanting a Saint Bernard of my own!  Over the years, I've been reluctant to see this movie thinking it would be unredeemably silly.  Instead, I found it to be an amusing family film about a very intelligent dog whose presence brings a family closer together.  It's very funny and light-hearted.  I would recommend this film to anyone.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|I have never played Tomb Raider the videogame, but enjoyed the movie.  The story wasn't as tight as it could have been, but it's Angelina Jolie in an action flick.  Bonus: nice outfits &amp; great music.  I wouldn't mind that mansion she lived in, either.
B00005B36H|5.0|I HAVE OVER THIRTY YEARS OF LISTENING TO HARD ROCK, AND THIS DISC IS A CLASSIC!  A REVIEW IN ROLLING STONE TURNED ME ON TO THESE GUYS- SAYING TO HANG IN THERE AND LET THE MUSIC SLOWLY REVEAL ITSELF TO YOU. RIGHT ON....I'M AN AUDIOPHILE WHO LISTENS TO A MONSTER SOUND SYSTEM W/ HDCD CAPABILITY (THE FORMAT IN WHICH &quot;LATERALUS&quot; IS RECORDED); AND LET ME TELL YOU, IT IS A DEEP AND LUSCIOUS SOUND. IT HAS BEEN YEARS SINCE I HAVE HEARD THIS HEAVY OF MUSIC WITH SUCH A POSITIVE, SPIRITUAL COMPONENT. MUCH DIFFERENT AND MORE COMPLETE THAN THEIR EARLIER STUFF.
B00005QG9J|4.0|<br />A more mature album than Make Yourself, Morning View manages to be introspective and insightful just enough to make you think these guys had some actual talent. At the same time, the album can kick some serious butt when it wants to, as in \\"Blood on the Ground\\" and \\"Have you ever?\\" <br />There's an Asian/Middle Eastern influence in some of the string arrangements. And what's up with the violins? The thing is, believe it or not, it works. It adds a sense of drama to the work, an innovation to metal(?) that's been sorely missing. I mean, it isn't as experimental as a Radiohead or a Bjork, but it's definitely something new to the genre. I've only had the album for two days, and it's all ready one of my favorites. <br />There first single, \\"Wish you were here,\\" is a pretty good barometer of how the rest of the album plays out. If you liked that song, you'll probably like the rest of the CD.

She loves to hear how Sarah, Percy, and Bill wait for their mommy in the dark of the woods, and how their mommy always comes back. It has helped her understand that even when Mommy or Daddy go to work, they will be back soon and will miss her all the while. At first, I thought the concept or dark pages would scare her, but she loves this book and asks for it every night. I recommend it!

0385335482|5.0|What can I say, I totally identify with Rebecca.  Not only are we the same age, and single, but we are about the same place in our careers, and always in search of the perfect pair of boots.  I could not put this book down.  They way she could justify buying face cream when she had already bought two jars earlier in the day is just a scream!  I mean, only a true shopaholic would get this book.  If you've ever gone into a store to &quot;browse&quot; and came out with a whole new wardrobe of things you already own, then you MUST read this book.  I read this book in about 3 sittings, and was begging for more.
0783226152|4.0|There was a huge cultural confusion in the mid 1970s. A great many people thought we were still in the 1950s. This was no bad thing, because the forces that brought us Showaddywaddy, Shakin' Stevens, Mud, Darts, and the television revivals Oh Boy! and Lets Rock! were also responsible for Grease, Happy Days, and American Graffiti.<br />We are so used to seeing George Lucas's name associated with Blockbusters, that it's easy to forget what a good director of actors he is. Despite this film containing a couple of great set pieces with hot rods and chicks, attention is never diverted from the good performances, particularly of Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard. Paul Le Mat also stands out here as someone who could have gone on to become a big star, but appears to have concentrated mainly on character parts.<br />The other major star here is the Soundtrack album, which sold very well at the time, being one sure way of getting hold of those difficult to come by Rock 'N' Roll hits. Pride of place goes to the one which started it all Rock Around The Clock by Bill Haley And His Comets, the song that caused cinema goes to rip up seats when it was used in 1950s films Blackboard Jungle and Rock Around The Clock. The remainder of the tracks have an air of quality about them that few other films can match. Despite being set nearly twenty years before it was made, American Graffiti still holds up well nearly thirty years after it was made, and is an invaluable document of what we were all doing in the 1970s!
0312979479|5.0|It is usually for a person if he repeat reading any book will feel boring, but, i have read And Then There Were None for almost 5 times now, and planing maybe to read it again.<br />There is something &quot;unknown&quot; exsist inside the pages and between the letters, everytime i read it i discover something new in the guests personality,and i feel anyway that i am reading it for the first time. I have it in both languages, English and Arabic, and also the Arabic copy was translated by a Doctor of the Arabic literature, so it was something fabulous to read in Arabic, too.<br />You can't guess who is the killer, even if you guessed, your guessing will die with the person in his turn,so you have to guess again, and again the death will be faster than you, and so it is.In the end, you wont the believe that killer was:..., well discover it by yourself, it is worth.
B00005QGAV|5.0|DANGEROUS is arguably Michael Jackson's most ambitious album to date. Overshadowed by the success of the previous two albums (especially THRILLER), DANGEROUS failed to receive the credit it definitely deserved.<br />The overall atmosphere on this album is noticably darker than on its predecessors (OFF THE WALL, THRILLER, BAD). The production is superb as always on MJ albums, but the sound is completely different than on his previous albums (mostly due to different producer/producers). The rhythms and grooves are quite loud and aggressive and they hold a strong grip on the album from the beginning of &quot;Jam&quot; to the very end of the title track.<br />With DANGEROUS it's pretty pointless to even attempt to list the standout tracks beacuse, above all, this album is a beautiful entity which it obviously was meant to be. There are absolutely no weak tracks on this album, which is a HUGE achievement with an album that lasts for almost 80 minutes! This is clearly some of the best material Jackson has ever written. There ARE quite a few hit singles on DANGEROUS, though, so if that's what you're looking for, you got it (Black Or White, Heal The World, Remember The Time, Will You Be There, Who Is It).<br />This new remastered edition, the album sounds even better and the clarity is incredible! Unlike on the other remastered MJ albums, DANGEROUS doesn't contain any extra tracks because there isn't any space left on the disc. This is 77 minutes of pure genius.<br />ESSENTIAL

B00005QW5X|4.0|Had 'this is Spinal Tap' been concerned with people whose fates and inner lives we could identify with, we might have seen how material that makes us laugh uncontrollably could quickly become tragic.  And 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' - the story of the transsexual leader of a 70s-style glam rock band, playing to restaurant audiences of single figures or less as she stalks the stadium rocker ex-lover who stole her songs; whose love life is a rondelay of promise, ecstasy, betrayal and rejection; whose dismal career forces her into prostitution - constantly teeters on the brink of the tragic.  <br />that it doesn't (quite) is largely due to the combusitble energy of the film, the inherent buoyancy of the musical genre, and the sympathy generated by John Cameron Mitchell's engaging performance, a classic queen's mixture of bravura and tears.  I say 'combustible' energy, because the film doesn't really have a plot, but moves like it does, and so threatens to expend itself - this can maim the emotional crescendos it strives for.  'Hedwig' was originally a stage musical, and the film works best as a kind of revue, with Hedwig on stage 'performing' and elucidating her life-story, illustrated by stylised, amusing, poignant flashbacks (the best being a candy-glutted sexual awakening at the hands of a huge Barry White-voiced American G.I.).  <br />the film mixes the musical, cabaret, the rites-of-passage, the (small-scale) show-biz satire and romantic comedy, with animation and collage, and the overall theme concerns unity and separation - Hedwig's anxieties about gender and sexual belonging; her origin as the son of an American soldier and East German communist, and how this relates to Cold-War Germany and the collapse of the Berlin Wall; the links between her life and work, her public persona and private emotions, the paradox that she finds her greatest emotional articulacy and authenticity caked in make-up, fright-wig and glittering clothes.  <br />while I would rather leapover sleeping alligators than listen to them in 'real' life, the songs, kind of Iggy/Ziggy/Velvets/New York Dolls rewritten by Jim Steinman, are hugely exciting, the audience even invited to sing along at one point (mine didn't), doing what songs in musicals should do - make the ordinary seem extraordinary, and give voice to the unspoken.  As well, in this case, as provoke and confront.
6305311463|1.0|Ok, so i'm browsing through all the cool really good other movies in the Criterion Collection when suddenly I see Armageddon and i i'm like &quot;what!!!!???&quot;  This movie was pure hollywood, a big budget film perfectly targeted to make money off of the current audiences and that's precisely what it did.  Deep Impact at least had some sort of emotional conflict in it.  However, I'm not giving one star to the movie itself, some people love this stuff and its beside me to criticize them, but really I have to give it to the Criterion Collection.  I'm sorry Criterion, I usually love your movies and have a whole bunch at home and plan to order many more, but this was not a good choice for an addition to the collection.  Many of your other movies are little-known, or &quot;art-house&quot;, or simply clever and original in some way, little adjectives I refuse to assign to this.<br />P.S. I have to thank the reviewer Fat Jon or whoever, I hadn't realized the &quot;metaphor&quot; of &quot;space cowboys&quot; before! J/K
B00005NVXG|5.0|Very good sound.  I have the DVD to this concert also, and it is great.  Very well put together material.  One of the best Live sounding recordings.
0897500482|5.0|This book by Bruce lee is great for all martial artists seeking some more insight and philosophies even if they are not praticing Jeet Kune Do. Keeping in mind this is not a &quot;how to book.&quot; This book has all of Bruce Lees notes and ideas on his veiw on jeet kune do. while reading this i learned alot of new things on his philosophies such as training and the basic philosophies on combat. I've read this book about twice now front to back and it is very insightful.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|There's no question that putting a Beatles &quot;greatest hits&quot; collection together is a daunting task.  The Beatles catalogue is too vast and important to summarize in one disc.  Even the Red and Blue double albums leave off a variety of essential Beatle tracks.  The Beatles One, a fine compilation, follows the logical path of compiling only their number one hits.  That doesn't necessarily mean their best songs, of course, but those songs that were most sucessful chart-wise on both sides of the Atlantic.  In short, songs that most people associate with the Fab Four.<br />Most of the tracks found here are bonafide classics, and the album flows surprisingly well.  But most ardent Beatles fans should stay away.  Why?  Because there are no &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; or &quot;White Album&quot; tracks found here.  And Beatles die-hards can't live without &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, &quot;Happiness Is A Warm Gun&quot;, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; or &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;.  But it doesn't matter, since the album is designed for newcomers and younger fans (all of whom were responsible for its surprise success).  If you're a Beatles fanatic, you'll nit-pick with this disc for a long time to come.  But if you're a casual fan who just wants a jukebox-style Beatles fix, this'll do.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This cd will be quite a suprise to all those who've jumped on the Incubus bandwagon based on the song \\"drive.\\"  This cd harkens back to the old days and incubus' best cd (until this one) in my opinion science.  There's still some soft stuff like on make yourself, but there's also alot harder things too.<br />Brandon sings with his own style, which fits in perfectly with incubus' brand of rock. guitar , base, and drums are as always top notch, and i'm glad they're still using dj kilmore's scratching on songs.<br />Songs on here go from the relativly soft \\"Wish You Were Here\\" to the hard \\"Under My Umbrella.\\"  My favorites are \\"Nice To Know You\\", \\"11 am\\", and \\"Under My Umbrella.\\"  But really the entire cd is great.<br />For me as an owner of every incubus cd, it's great to see their music style evolve, but still keep the elements that set them apart from most every other band out there.  This is another step in what will be a great career for them.  This could seriously be the best release of the year, i would take this over tool's lateralus, staind's break the cycle, and even POD's Satelite.  But after all that all you need to know that if you like incubus, really if you like music you will like morning view.  I can't wait for their next cd.

B00005MP58|1.0|I must second the other reviewer who noted how terribly washed out the color is on the DVD.  Very disappointing!  Stick with the VHS.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Incubus seems to have found their sound, using lots of acoustic guitars and strings. The \\"Rock\\" songs aren't so noisy and the singer doesn't scream, but sing, and very well!!...<BR>The first listening was boring, but now I'm beginning to like it. Anyway I miss more rock and less balads on the record. Could have been better, but... I still prefer SCIENCE and Make Youself.<BR>Anyway, the cd is worthy. All Incubus fans will enjoy it. Excepting \\"Aqueous Transmission\\", a horrible song!
B00005B36H|1.0|I don't understand what is so great about this album or Tool in general. The only good songs on the album are parabol and parabola, and everything else is just dark and annoying. If you like music that makes you feel like shoving your head in a toilet, then I'd recommend this CD to you. If your interested in bands that use their talent, check out linkin park, 311, deftones, incubus, and even Maynard's &quot;side project&quot; A Perfect Circle. At least Maynard came up with tracks that are worth listening to on Mer De Noms. Tool wouldnt be half bad if they used their talent instead of making dark, muddy, and annoying music.  This is not worth a penny, and im so glad that I burned it first. This is just another dissapointing Tool album.
0345448898|1.0|Mr. Pullman's trilogy is well-crafted, although his inventions fade rapidly after reading (unlike Lewis's Narnia, which remains mint-bright in the mind). The trilogy is also teeming with religious hatred, specifically of Christianity and Christians. As a parent, a college professor, and someone who respects all religions, I find this incomprehensible and unacceptable. I would strongly recommend that parents avoid buying these books for their children; if a child does read this trilogy, parents and educators should make every effort to point out to the child Mr. Pullman's bigotry, and perhaps discuss the dangers of all prejudice: religious, racial, ethnic, national, and so on.

1558216847|3.0|(Formerly written by myself in 1999)<br />One should really never say never, but... Rawicz' harrowing tale of travel across the Himalayas smacks of an overactive imagination. The circumstances and events he and his mates were able to conquer would be impossible to replicate without everyone dying, and implausible on historical grounds.<br />1)He consistently states that he tried to travel and average of 20 -30 miles per day walking 8-12 hours and assumes that he actually achieved such an average. It is impossible to travel through the topography of the regions he describes, esp. the Himalayan foothills and achieve anything more than about 10 miles on an exceptionally good day (on flat ground with good maps). <br />His average should have been about 8 miles /day. I know this since I have travelled with light pack through much of the area Rawicz describes. With a 16 kilo backpack in very good shape I was able to make an average of 5 miles across rough terrain --- and this is with enough food on established trails. Rawicz states that most of the time they were not on trails. <br />2) The group was pretty desperate, but why walk to British India. Surely it must have crossed someone's mind to try to find the forces of Chaing Kai Shek and get transferred to the western powers operating in Eastern China. It would have saved them a lot of walking. You might say, Well he didn't want to risk hitting the Japanese or Chinese communists. But if they knew about the communists or the Japanese then they must also has known about a certain western presence and military support for China, or at least been able to find out about the political presence from someone). It might be hard to find someone who spoke a language they understood, but certainly worth looking for.<br />3) His climbing descriptions of the trails in the Himalayas bear no relationship to the real conditions and belie and true description of snow conditions in the Himalayas at the time of year he crossed into BritishIndia. Without maps or guides and adequate supplies, in the 1940s it was just not possible. Moreover they should have been picked up by either a Chinese Nationalist patrol or Nepalese govt. authorities long before they hit the British (where exactly he chances upon them is not mentioned -- we have no geographic details to crossreference his story. <br />4) He describees wandering around what is surely the Taklamantan Desert for 8 days without water. In this environment you'd be dead in 2 days, even if you were an SAS hardman with all the survival techniques in the world you would still be dead. <br />5) Perhaps the most damning indictment of his story is the fact that he was never debriefed by British intelligence, merely &quot;given a new uniform and sent to Africa.&quot; What was his unit. The Polish contingent was also not in Africa, but battling up the boot of Italy. It is possible that he did join a British Unit, but since he states that his English was not good, it is unlikely the British would have assigned him with unit outside of the Polish contingent attached to the British 8th Army. <br />It is stretching the boundaries of credibility to believe this man walks from a Stalinist labour camp across most of continental asia (an area where the British and Russians, though allies, have traditionally quarreled) comes crawling through to a British hospital and.... surprise, surprise, no official from British Intelligence debriefs him or his mates. <br />Believe what you want, this is an interesting tale but as a betting man, I am sure it isn't true. As a piece of fiction it reads quite well. If you want good tales in the same genre read &quot;Fear Drives My Feet.&quot; About the coast watchers behind Japanese lines, or the &quot;Gulag Archipelago&quot; to know what being in a Stalinist camp was really like. Those are real historical adventure.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|First of all, this is a top-notch anime worthy of its title.  Now, for all of you out there that miss your original dub let me say this: your original dub was garbage.  There was a reason that Pioneer did a new dub cause any novice anime fan could see the vast flaws in it.  On a side note, if you did not know, this original dubbing was soo bad, that it was responsible for the fansubbing movement that is still alive today, and Kaneda is pronounced, kah-neda unlike on the original dub; a funimation dbz dub is much better than this was.  Moving on, the original japanese track is superb and the restoration of this movie makes it almost flawless.  A top-notch movie.  I recommend you buy it for the original japanese track, but if you like to watch anime dubbed, this new track is very well done.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is a great cd, it is a bit slower than make yourself...but every bit as good.  I would definently reccomend this to anyone who loves rock.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|For those of you whining about your old dub let me just put it this way, that was garbage.  Names were mispronounced, the storyline was changed, the kids had voices of adults, the list goes on.  Pioneer did an excellent job re-dubbing this movie and trying to match the script and the voices to the original japanese track.  The video looks very great after this restoration.  Overall an awesome movie.
B00005JKHP|5.0|I got the DVD about 4 hours ago. The second that I peeled all those security stickers off my DVD box, I popped it open, place the disc in my player, turned up the Dolby Digital, my super sub-woofer... my high density screen, shut down all light sources, put my PowerMac G4 to sleep, turned off my phones, and laid back for what I hoped would be a nice treat.<br />Paramount should be ashamed of themselves. This edit should be in theaters. This isn't a minor achievement in quality increase. This is now a great film. I am literally stunned right now.<br />It isn't a matter of effects, so much as it is about dynamics of motion... The tightening of scenes.... Little tweaks here and there.... An added scene here, a missing one here... Revealing more about the characters, keeping a character from being less than he should be.<br />First off, the Visual Effects shots are absolutely superior, while remaining exactly of the same palette as the original film. These new shots add a consistent sense of grandeur that Wise achieved so very well in some scenes, yet not at all in others. Now... Now the film is a sweeping science fiction epic... Man facing the unknown that comes from that place where no man has gone before.<br />The picture quality was gorgeous... the richness of the colors... Everything just gorgeous. The new sound... DEAR GOD, it was magnificent. The remix was handled to perfection and not bungled like those that were toying with SUPERMAN recently. From beginning to end there is a quality increase in the sound that never once falters to my ears on this great sound system of mine.<br />I'd like to tell you about the new visual effects shots, but to be honest... I can't. They are that seamlessly integrated. I'm sure that there were scenes of the Enterprise passing into the great V-GER ship that I had never seen, but they were intercut with old ones so well that all I got was an increased feeling of motion and dynamics of shots. The results were exactly what was needed.<br />Suddenly this film feels like it belongs in Trumbull and Dykstra's Filmography. It always was nice... but before it always felt like a travelogue, and not at all threatening and ominous and creepy and moody and scary and mysterious. That's right, these new shots actually ADD to the ATMOSPHERE.<br />For the first time in too long, I'm looking at not only real STAR TREK, but frankly... This is Star Trek where it should always be. Smart Science Fiction told by great Narrative Filmmakers and folks of vision.... Not the fumblings of visionless hucksters that have kidnapped the franchise since the death of Roddenberry.<br />I have yet to venture into the second DVD... The one loaded with deleted scenes, documentaries and the behind the scenes joys... That will be what I do tomorrow. For now I'm in the afterglow of watching perhaps the best STAR TREK movie and dealing with the realization that due to the lack of vision of cowardly executives, this final masterpiece of Robert Wise's will never be projected upon a Silver Screen as it so needs to be.
B00005NB0H|5.0|Recorded Live at Leeds University on February 14th 1970. This CD has long been considered one of the greatest rock'n roll live albums of all time. The first lp has only 6 tracks, then in 1995 we have the remastered version with 14 tracks. Now we have the FULL SHOW (inlcuding they masterpiece TOMMY), and when you hear it you realize that all the legend and buzz about this british band is all deserved
B00005R5G9|5.0|I give them 2 stars for finally releasing this gem on DVD but no extras??<BR>This film is delightful and refreshing, Leonard Maltin obviously was having a bad day when he saw this film. I must have seen it 6 or more times when it was in the theaters.<BR>Kim Catrall(Sex in the City) is delightfully coy and silly as well as charming in this comedy about an ancient princess with a too modern outlook and is &quot;cursed&quot; to live through thousands of years until she finds a love who can appreciate her for who she is and not try and control her.<BR>Andrew McCarthy(Pretty in Pink) is wonderful as a failed sculptist who cannot keep a job until he gets a job working as a window dresser at a failing dept store in Philadelphia.<BR>Great co-stars Estelle Getty(Golden Girls), Mesach(sp?) Taylor(Designing Women), James Spader(Stargate the movie) and others make this film a hysterical and romantic romp!
B00005N9CV|5.0|This has to be one of the best-crafted dinner-by-candlelight type CDs ever made. Her voice and phrasing are getting better and better and the LSO arrangements are superb.  My wife is a diehard Top 40 listener but this one she listens to; again &amp; again. Highly recommended.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is absolutely the funniest movie I have ever seen.  All the special features are great, but the movie itself would stand alone just fine.  That's really I have to say.
B00005QG9J|5.0|this isnt the best incubus cd but it is real good. it doesnt match s.c.i.e.n.c.e. but it is as good or better than make yourself. i wasnt sure it was going to be very good not that they are popular but it is a great cd. everyone should buy this.
6305265488|5.0|When I first saw this on HBO a couple of years ago, it surprised and delighted me with its frothy, funny, and equally dramatic elements, helped by the strong performances by Drew Barrymore, Anjelica Huston, and Dougray Scott playing Danielle, her wicked stepmother and Prince Henry.<br />The plot is that a young independent girl, Danielle, loses her father due to a heart attack. After her father's death, she is treated by her stepmother like a servant for many years, till she is about seventeen to eighteen. <br />Only one of her stepsisters is kind and gentle to her, while the jealous and vain one and the stepmother work together to win the heart of independent Prince Henry, who wants no part in being married off to a Spanish princess. But Danielle wins the prince's heart, leading to a confection of comedy, drama, and romance afterward, into a happy and satisfying ending.<br />The plot was original, the acting was vibrant and colorful, and the spectacular scenery (which is filmed beautifully in France) helps it a great deal. <br />It's a wondrous movie that's funny, touching, and heartwarming all at the same time. But really saddened me was the failure for the Academy to give it not even one Oscar nod (such as the best actress and best supporting actress nominations for Barrymore and Huston). Buy it now, you won't be disappointed. <br />Rated PG for mild language and dramatic and thematic elements.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I like all the Starwars movies that came out like everyone else. To be honest I felt a little disappointed in the Phantom Menace movie when it first came out. All the special effects scenes in the movie that were made in the movie were suppose to revolutionize the industry. The over all outcome was not exactly all that breath taking. In anycase I reserved a copy of Phantom DVD because I was thrilled to hear of the new deleted scenes and the extended pod race scene. To be honest even without the scenes I would have purchased it anyway. I was hoping that there was so much more that was missed in the movie and is now included in the DVD. Over all the set up and chapter selections were nice but not great. The special contents within didn't wet my appetite either. The missing scenes were short and I saw no reason why they shouldn't have been included in disc one. The DVD like the movie fell short in impressing me whatsoever. However I am a Starwars fan and I feel obliged to purchase it. On it's merits alone I would just put it back on the shelf. I forsee this edition will be forgotten and price reduced on a clearance rack in about a month. The only thing that will keep this in the spolight is the coming of episode 2 in theaters.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer is a great talent!!  I have hardly been able to go one day without listening to any one of his three CDs...   If you have the chance, go to JohnMayer.Com and check out his tour schedule, he is even better live!
B000004286|5.0|The movie was a great movie, and two reasons were the cinematography and the music.  The combination of those, along with the epic story made this movie Oscar material, which it won plenty of.<br />I found that the Braveheart soundtrack makes great background music.  Listen to it while you're doing something passive, like reading a book.  Or just close your eyes and listen to it.  It will lift you to another world.
B00000J7S8|5.0|This album makes for a great listening experience.  Diana Krall displays her talents for Jazz piano and singing on every track.  The arrangements chosen are excellent, and the album includes many songs that most people know.<br />I enjoy listening to this CD on a great stereo, or with headphones because the recording and sound quality are excellent.  Although I have only started listening to Diana Krall recently, I really enjoy her style and talent.<br />I highly recommend this album for any jazz fan looking for current albums to add to their collection.  Also, anyone who has not heard or purchased any Diana Krall albums, this one is a great starting point.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Expectations are in the eye of the beholder!<br /> This fact is what must drive artists nuts. There are always purists around who will find fault with any deviation from norm. This is why one reads such widely varying critiques of Diana Kralls latest effort THE LOOK OF LOVE.<br />Yes, it's true she uses strings in a decidely non-jazz tradition. Yes, she chooses material that is traditional pop rather than jazz. This upsets the purists among us. Tough!<br />Here is what counts. Does she deliver the goods? Yes. Not perfectly, but very well. She is evocative, romantic and sexy. Not a bad set of qualities. This effort will put you &quot;in the mood&quot;. Isn't that what an artist is supposed to do? We can quibble here and there with a selection or two but the project works and that's what counts. Give the lady a break. She is finding her groove and doing it well. <br /> Ignore the sniping and give it a listen. You will like it.
0452282152|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much because of the simplicity of the authors writing. It was easy to read, very discriptive and an image of Holland, which is not usually written about. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those who are interested in art.
B00005QG9J|4.0|because that is what I first did when I popped it in the CD player.  I mean, this is a far cry from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and even Make Yourself.  It took me many listens, but it slowly grew on me.  The lyrics are really what has drawn me in.  They are very intelligent and the vocals are extrememly good.  But lets get to the point though...this is a very mellow CD.  If you are looking for something like S.C.I.E.N.C.E. forget about it.  In my opinion Make Yourself is a little bit better, but Incubus was a whole lot more experimental on this CD.  If you break it down, maybe 2/3s of Make Yourself was fast and hard, and the remaining mellow.  Then there was Battlestar Scralatchtica...Morning View is maybe half and half, maybe a couple more soft songs.   The use of Chineese instruments is very interesting.  I really liked them on &quot;11am&quot; but &quot;Aqueaous Transmission&quot; is just a little too mellow and repetitive for me.  <BR>Basically, if you loved Make Yourself, you'll enjoy this CD.  If you loved S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and thought that Incubus was too &quot;mainstream&quot; on Make Yourself, don't bother.  For the open minded that understand that Incubus has grown up, you'll like the CD, too.<BR>So did they sell out?  I can't tell.  I'll wait and see how they promote this and what their next relese looks like.  Until then, bye.
B000002GQK|5.0|The Moody Blues are as much a phenomenon as they are a group of talented musicians.  Stirring poetry, meticulous harmony, powerful music that moves the soul - these are a few of the descriptions I use when thinking about the Moody Blues.<br />Many years have passed since I listened to this album.  I was amazed at how relevant the music is today as it was a few decades ago.  Moreover, in the wake of the September 11th terrorist attacks, the music caused great introspection.
B000005QH3|5.0|I saw this movie when i was 10 year old kid. I decided then that one day I´m gonna have a car like that. 21 years later I bought my Challenger. After I had searched all video stores in Finland I found my Vanishing Point at Amazon com. I have now seen it ten times at least!! I have seen the newer version too but it´s not as good as the original. This video is a great gift idea to everyone who likes old muscle cars. I´m still looking for original Vanishing Point-soundtrack.<BR>Why don´t they make movies like this anymore???<br />OLD MOPARS NEVER DIE!!
B000002BUY|5.0|After purchasing Morning View and feeling rather disenfranchised about it, I went back to one of my favorite cds, SCIENCE....<br />SCIENCE and Enjoy! are constantly changing places on my favorite Incubus cd scale, one with the single most original Nu metal sound ever and one layered with funk and jazz overtones.  Brandon did progress lyrically on this album about 10 fold from their funkier moments before, actually making coherent messages ranging on many different topics.  Mike has plenty of interesting riffs and uses distortion to it's full advantage, and has incredibly rad bass lines litered through the album.  The drumming is energetic and has a very nice snare sound.<br />Redefined is a great opener with it's constant scratching and great bass work.  Vitamin has a great begining and a very catchy (and not catchy as in overly simple) chorus and is definatly a highlight on the album..well actually every track is great I constant listen to the whole album.  New Skin was a great choice for a single and really defines the album as a whole, Idiot Box has a great intro and great lyrics (even if I'm a TV addict), Glass has GREAT guitar work using distortion to it's full potential and again great lyrics.  Magic Medicine is a rather unique instrumental and can be either hilarious or just plain cheesy depending on your mood.  A Certine Shade of Green is the albums best track it has everything...Favorite Things is the albums dullest track but still really good overall.  Summer Romance is a great melodic jazzy song, the saxophone really brings the track out at the end.  Nebula is pretty good but one of the albums less stellar tracks.  Deep Inside shows Incubus' more funkish roots but isn't exactly gold lyricaly.  Calgone is a great almost thrashy closer that tells of the bad day from hell.  The secret track is amusing but a little too long.<br />Overall one the best cds released in the 90's, simply a must have.
6305807930|4.0|Because if you see it during the afternoon you will laugh hysterically.  This is not to say that horror was not meant to be watched during the day.  King Kong terrified me as did every version of the Mummy ever made (except the Indiana Jones one with B.F. that came out not too long ago).  <BR>     Argento's &quot;Inferno&quot;, if viewed late night however, is a force to be reckoned with.  The story line sort of picks up where Susperia left off.  Don't try to read too much into it, because the more you try to understand it, the more frustrated you will be with some of the odd characters who appear maybe once or twice and then vanish with no explanation as to identity or motive what so ever.<BR>     But, I rated this movie four stars!-as to where it succeeds, it does so brilliantly in where Argento's dialog and characters leave off.  He says more with one image of an empty hotel room under water (and makes more sense at that) than the paragraphs of exposition he devotes to explaining the Three Sisters.  The real horror is in the architecture, not as an active menace, but as a latent malevolent force.  Argento's set designs are flawless; I loved his spartan use of color against the many shades of darkness throughout the film's mostly gloomy sets.<BR>     As for one of the sisters who finally manifests herself, well . . . we'll just have to wait until the third installment to see if more sense can be made of this mythology-if and when Argento ever crafts one.
B00005QG9J|3.0|I hate using the SO word...and I'm not totaly convinced this is one of the very few ocassions I use it.  (Sugar Ray that's it) But I really can not stand how Morning View is just a simpler rehash of Make Yourself, I remember when Incubus' style would change with every record.  SCIENCE sounded nothing like Fungus Amongus and Make Yourself sounded nothing like SCIENCE.   Yet they have a successful single and they seem to make an album of Drives and Stellars with a few really forced sounding heavier tracks thrown on.  <br />Wish You Were Here is a disgrace to the Incubus fans from their experimental era.  But the rest of the album isn't horrible and actually has a few bright spots, Blood On The Ground, Mexico, and Just A Phase are great songs and I love the additions of strings and more acoustics on the album, I just wish they were used in a way that made the album sound different compared to Make Yourself.  However gone is the funk, metal, and jazz of their former releases.  Which doesn't help at all mind you.<br />I'll probably end up selling this album fairly quickly...
0201633612|5.0|Of course, it's the best book, it's the &quot;Bible&quot;.<br />I saw someone gives &quot;Design Patterns Explained&quot; only one star; I also saw someone gives this book only one star. Is this book not good? No. You dislike this book only because that you made a wrong selection: as a beginner, you should read DPE at first.<br />However, it's Chinese version is too bad... I'd rather to read it's original version, though I'm a Chinese.
B00004XOWM|5.0|First of all, all of you who didn't like it don't have taste. WHo couldn't like Hot Dog?! 46 f- words and still making sense?! AMZING! SHEER Brilliance. My favorite is Livin' It Up
B00000JFV9|5.0|Curtis Mayfield manages here to be funky, soulful, musically inventive, to sound beautiful and yet at times conveying great suffering, to do justice to the issues that he's singing about in a way that still seems relevant, and I reckon always will. He does all this and yet at the end of the record you want to turn around and listen to it again right away.<br />It hangs together incredibly as a sprawling urban suite, in a similar way to much of Stevie Wonder's 70's work. An essential addition to any collection of soul music.
B00004VWA2|5.0|Just picked up a Sony Super Audio CD player yesterday and they have come down in price significantly.  I got mine from a major retailer for (dollar amount).  The first CD I got was \\"Tapestry\\" and it was worth it.  You can hear all of the subtle nuances of Carole's voice and you really feel the emotion she exudes.  The remastering for the SACD is superb and this new stlye lends itself to Carole's singing.<br />Only drawback is that this SACD is not multi-channel and ,unlike what the previous reviewer said, only hybrid SACDs can be used in regualar CD players, and they are few and far between right now.<br />Go buy this disc!
1587990717|4.0|I picked up this book because I read Mr. Taleb's quantitative derivatives book, Dynamic Hedging.  Dynamic Hedging was an extremely insightful and intuitive foray into vanilla and exotic options.  It was enhanced by Mr. Taleb's occasional commentary on life in the markets.  I imagined that an entire book containing Mr. Taleb's viewpoints on probability would be compelling.<br />It was indeed compelling.  But I did not wholly agree with him.  I suppose that is my right.<br />At risk of great oversimplification, Taleb argues quite articulately that extreme occurrences in a distribution happen a lot more frequently than humans are prone to believe.  Ergo, in derivatives trading, it makes no sense for one to be &quot;frontspread&quot; (short gamma/vega).  Ever.<br />My experience is in equity derivatives.  Mr. Taleb's is presumably in fixed income and FX.  Without knowing much about the world of FX options, I can assert that in the equity listed options markets, downdrafts in volatility can be almost as deadly as explosions in volatility.  The vol crush of the summer of 2000 wiped out as many traders as the Russian debt default of 1998.  Out of the money options are never cheap; lots of people buy them for the protection that Taleb seeks.  Sometimes even they are too expensive to own.<br />Going further, I found Mr. Taleb's insights on the role of luck in human performance to be EXTREMELY unsettling.  He talks at length about the rich idiot trader and the vastly more competent but underpaid trader (presumably himself).  He goes on to ascribe most of those who are wildly successful in life to LUCK, and that individuals ascribe way too much of their own success to their own ability and hard work (which he scorns).<br />I find this to be frightening.  I'm sure Mr. Taleb would find this reaction entirely predictable.  The implications are most frightening, from a political standpoint: if most wealth is undeserved, then therefore it can be rightfully taxed (expropriated) andredistributed to those are not so lucky.  Furthermore, most individuals who despise hard work do so not because they are brilliant, but because they are lazy.  Evaluation of a particular person's work ethic is an imperfect but reasonably good indicator of performance.<br />Many of the MBAs he derides as being shallow thinkers and pluggers, while may not be (ahem) the intellectual giant that Taleb is, are no slouches themselves.  They do not represent the legions of clueless option sellers that Mr. Taleb has somehow encountered throughout his career.  Most young associates do have the luxury of telling their boss they did not read the Wall Street Journal in the morning because it represents nothing but random noise.<br />As you can tell from this review, I enjoyed the book.  Otherwise I wouldn't be so critical of it.  I couldn't put it down.  You probably won't agree with all of it, but it will cause you to think about things in a very different way for a long time.
B00005QG9J|5.0|The freshest stuff from ANYWHERE in quite a while.<BR>This one will grow on you.  VERY, VERY VERY listenable album, which translates to... you can listen over and over and it only gets better and better.
B00005NWRS|5.0|...but this is the best album of 2001.  It's the most complete work I've come across, and shows some excellent growth if your familiar with Whiskeytown's Pneumonia, or last year's Heartbreaker.  It is a significant departure from both, but in an outstanding way.  Ryan Adams has made an album that is both new and familiar.  It's not the same retread albums you hear on the radio, but rather the songs that you hear in the back of your head from childhood, when artists had to convey their message in disguised lyrics, rather than dropping and F-bomb every 5 seconds.  On a song like Answering Bell, you'll think you're hearing Van Morrison.  Others will conjur Robert Plant, or the Who.  But that's the beauty of this album.  Adams has taken everything that was once great in music, and built upon it.  Everybody may not adore this album, but you won't be disappointed in it.
6301885732|5.0|This film is great. I wish it was on DVD. I love Warren Betty. He is an awesome director. Al Pacino brings his classic mobster act to the screen. Who better? This movie is set in the old style classic film making era. Get it. But anyway how can it not even be on VHS. It is on DVD in other countries.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I'm a big fan of Blur, and having said that, I think that Damon is a genious.  Buy this album now, and you will thank me later ;)
B00003CWTI|1.0|I don't walk out on films as a matter of personal policy, but this film seriously tested that policy. Before the film I had no real opinion on Paul Anderson, now I'm convinced that he's just another Altman wannabe, so hell bent on being innovative and groundbreaking and developing his own &quot;personal style&quot; that he'll sacrifice a good story for it.<br />Ensemble films a la Altman rarely work (as Altman himself will testify). I didn't know Magnolia was one of those before I saw it. As soon as I realized it, I realized we in the theater were in trouble. And sure we were. 3 hours of completely unsympathetic characters. It was like a long parade of victims, all of them somehow wronged by the world, by birth, by people, by drugs, by themselves. The redemption you'd expect at the end never came. That might be interesting to masochists, but some of us don't enjoy watching the miserable foibles of others. The suffering of the characters onscreen was an analogy to the suffering of the viewers in the theater, as was evidenced by the audible sighs of desperation from those around me as yet another scene chock full of disappointment began.<br />If you enjoy seeing movies and being disappointed, if Radiohead's lyrics REALLY appeal to you, you'll like the film. If you're like the rest of us, who a) don't enjoy stories about human failure with no redemption and b) see through BS directors trying to become &quot;auteurs&quot;, you can safely skip this film.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|When the high water comes rushing through this town, and I have to reach and grab whatever albums I can manage to save, I'll snatch up Love and Theft from wherever it's sitting and run like hell.<br />Bob Dylan's band is so tight. Many people say this is the best band he's played with since The Band. I'm gonna go ahead and say this band is hands down the best band with which Bob Dylan has ever played.<br />The songs are great. High Water, Summer Days, Mississipi, Moonlight, Po Boy. Simply great. As Mr. Dylan has already said: &quot;They're all greatest hits, only they're not hits yet.&quot;
B00004U8H4|4.0|Christian Bale plays a yuppie on wall street with some serious mental issues.  The attitude of the movie is sarcastic and mostly humorous.  The actors do a good job of following the look and feel of the movie- everything is a little corny.<br />Patrick Bateman (Bale) has only a few emotions.  Two are greed and disgust, and the third is an uncontrollable urge to kill, which is his only escape from a dull and dreary life.<br />Due to the many complaints about this movie, I will state the obvious: this movie has a lot of killing in it.  The presence of the word \\"psycho\\" would tip most people off, but just in case it's not for squeemish folks.  But even being squeemish won't ruin it, as there is very little visible violence.  In most cases, the victims are not shown much during the attack.  It's about as tastefull as you can get when it comes to killing people.  The most graphic displays are Bateman's pencil sketches.<br />The movie contains elements of satire, but the personalities of his friends were chosen to provide Bateman's personality a suitable environment, filled with others that don't find his outward displays of greed and concietedness odd.  The movie may contain a lot of poking around, but the focus is definitely on the psychological aspect of Bateman- the ridiculous decade takes the back seat.<br />[...]<br />That brings us to the intellectual aspect of it.  You could watch the movie without really paying attention to what happens, and just laugh at goofy scenes and pathetic yuppies.  But one only has to listen to the dialog at the end to get the main idea.<br />For the benefit of those that don't get it (in order to preserve the surprise, I will leave one part unexplained), in the beginning Bateman kills out of boredom and addictive impulse.  Only after his great frustration with the jarring issue at the end does he become frustrated with hopelessness and truly sadistic.  He then suggests he will kill for the actual satisfaction of watching others suffer to make up for his own mental pain (a big difference when it comes to the rehabilitation issue, which is not addressed).  This is all spelled out in the movie, with the exception of transferring vengeance to murder, but by that time we can hardly reason to doubt his inclusion of murder as an option.  Since the mood of most of the movie tends to put you in a watch-only mode, I can see how some people might need to watch the last couple minutes over again, as the resolution is 99% dialog.<br />A few corrections to common comments.  First, there are no real cries for help.  Bateman reveals himself to drunk/drugged people for his own amusement (one of which he is already carrying out his plan to kill).  His only serious confession is near the end, and becomes necessary for the plot, so there is no reason to believe the movie is about the armchair psychology of \\"cries for help.\\"  Second, the is no men/women sexism, or at least no preference.  The men are selfish pigs, the women are too emotional, and both are equally promiscuous.  They're all scum.  Also, there are almost no similarities to Fight Club.  Sure, the main characters are both nuts (though they have completely different disorders), and there is violence in it.  Not much of a match.  I find two real connections myself.  One being that both movies require the viewer to be light hearted and not too emotional about violence (which leads to emotional types to classify them as both too violent, and thus the same).  The other is that unobservant critics make the same mistake about both: they fail to comprehend that the main characters are crazy (and therefore the films purpose is not to promote whatever they do) and try to draw cliche statements about society as the theme.<br />Finally, if you are the type that needs to have a hero in every movie, this is not for you.  Much like the Mel Gibson flick \\"Payback,\\" the movie is full of unscrupulous characters, including the protagonist.  To really enjoy the movie, you haveto laugh at ridiculous and trite murder.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|...That leave you thinking about yourself long after you've seen it. I was able to follow three complete stories and implications, but I'm sure there are many more. The DVD version is great: it has the original story and a very good multimedia interpretation of the movie, the designers are on to something  here. Highly recommendable!
B0000028RR|5.0|I first came across Rage when my friend burned me this CD. At first I was a bit apprehensive as I had only heard Know Your Emeny live, but as I listened to this CD I became amazed at the skill of the guitarist, bassist and Zac's Singing. For me Know your enemy sums this CD up. Its strong political message and guitar solos are truly excellent, and Rage must truly behead of their time, as we are only now seeing sporned bands now (dont forget this is back in 1992).<BR>I would strongly advise purchasing this Cd, as you will be blown a back by its greatest. I'm a Blink 182, Greenday, etc fan but I still enjoy the cd. How can you deny brilliance.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Ich konnte das neue Dylan-Album gar nicht erwarten. Meine Freundin brachte es mir genau am 11. September mit, aber meine Freunde wurde durch die Anschlge auf New York am gleichen Tag getrbt. Dennoch habe ich Love and Theft noch am gleichen Tag gehrt.<BR>Noch nie habe ich Bob Dylan, dessen Fan ich seit meinem 13. Lebensjahr bin (ich bin jetzt 43 Jahre alt), so spielfreudig gehrt. Ich liebe Bye And Bye, und ich bin verrckt nach Lonesome Day Blues. Vollkommen berrascht war ich von Mississippi, das ich schon von Sheryl Crow kannte. Und jetzt: was fr eine wundervolle, melancholische und doch so Freude bereitende Version. Ich kann nur hoffen, dass mein so oft mrrisch schauender Freund selbst Freude an diesem Album hat. Es steht fr mich in einer Reihe mit Blood On The Tracks, Time Out Of Mind oder auch Highway 61 Revisited. Ganz groe Klasse!
B00003CXC7|5.0|This is a wonderful film.  It's thrilling, funny, and provocative.  Also, the characters are great.  If you are looking for a slam-bam action film with meathead dialogue, this is not the picture; if you are looking for a fun film that layers subtext &amp; social commentary with a voyeuristic plot and delightful characters, this is a good bet.  It is clearly a Hitchcock film; if comparison needs to be made, I see similarities with North By Northwest.  While the plot and scope are very different, the tone, sexual tension, and dialogue seem to be cut out of a similar mold.  What makes it a fun film is the light tone -- it's thrilling without being too serious.  I am a fan of Hitchcock, and without question, this film is my favorite.  The chemistry of characters, especially between Jimmy Stewart &amp; Grace Kelly, is wonderful.  Big thumbs up!
B00003CXAA|5.0|I'll try not to rehash...it's great.  I saw the Godfather for the xth time when it was released in 1998 on the big screen.  I wished that Part II had been released as well.  Dolby Digital made all the difference.  Some complain that it's too grainy, but I think that's part of its charm.  Some complain that it's not widescreen.  Actually, it is widescreen, it's just not letter-boxed.  As one of a growing minority that actually has a 16x9 tv, I couldn't be happier not to have half my screen wasted by those stupid black bars.  However, I can understand how that might suck or the masses.  My one complaint, which is the same as many, is that the Godfather Triology 1901-1980 was not released at the same time.  Now I've got to buy both.  But who can really complain, it's an offer I can't refuse.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Arriving on the heels of mainstream success brought on by extensive touring and MTV exposure, Morning View shows the softer side of Incubus. The boys' songwriting and composition skills have certainly progressed since their last effort. The use of orchestral instruments in a few tunes adds a new and welcome dimension, yet doesn't interfere with the nasty distorted guitar aggression for which Incubus is known. While the band sounds tighter than ever, Boyd's voice seems strained at times. Odd time signatures are embraced even more on this album than on previous one and Jose handles them unwaveringly. Kilmore adds very tasty scratching, knowing precisely where he is needed. The lack of any &quot;overplaying&quot; by the musicians creates adeqate space for the music to breathe. It's nice to hear a band that doesn't have to prove its chops by squeezing as many riffs/fills/notes into one measure as possible. Dynamics are employed masterfully with plenty of emotional crescendos. &quot;Warning&quot; and &quot;Just a Phase&quot; are standout tracks. I'll take &quot;Make Yourself&quot; over &quot;Morning View&quot; right now, but a good effort nonetheless. Give me a few weeks and I might say otherwise. This music gets better with each listening.
B00004XONN|4.0|I and kind of a new fan of radiohead. I just started getting into them in the last 7 or 8 months and i really enjoy them. I have, however, been a huge music fan for about 18 years, so I do have some clue as to what &quot;good&quot; music is, and should be. Kid A is not neccisarily music. I perfere to call it an experiace, more than anything. With melodies that tend to send your mind somewhere other than to the speakers. It's in many ways, a transport to the little world that radiohead has created. It can only be compared to Tool's Lateralus, which is the only other album of this type. Songs like Optimistic, In Limbo, and how to disapear completely are probably the best &quot;songs&quot; off the album. <br />The only major problem is that to get the effect of this album you must listen to it all the way though to get the full experiance out of it.           Another great venture by Rh
B00000612P|5.0|This is a stunner of an album.  Anyone who knows Rod Stewart only as a cheesy, showbiz, big power ballad, MOR, adult contemporary artist needs to check this out.<br />That's what I used to think.  In my teens, I knew Rod Stewart as someone who got played on the &quot;lite favorites&quot; stations.  Then I got my first taste of Faces, the early seventies band that Rod fronted, and that future Rolling Stone Ron Wood played guitar for.  If you like bluesy rock and roll, like classic Stones, give Faces a listen.<br />&quot;Every Picture Tells a Story&quot; came out in 1971, Rod's third solo album.  In his early solo career, Rod's M.O. was acoustic-based, but DRIVING, rock and roll-- mixed with some of the most poignant ballads one can find.  He had a pretty even mix of original compositions and well-chosen covers.  This album is THE classic from his career.  His singing is incredible and his band (including Ron Wood on slide) is jumping with energy.<br />One thing that kind of sums up how special this album is:  one of the greatest moments isn't even listed on the track listing.  Following a rambunctious reading of &quot;That's Alright Mama&quot;, Rod sings a short rendition of &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, backed by Ron Wood's acoustic guitar.  It's a genuinely moving and beautiful performance, and it was kind of tossed in with 8 great tracks.
6301247485|5.0|This film is certainly dreamy.  What are you looking for? Depending on what you wish to find in this film, you may love it or not.  As stated in the main review, the costumes, and sets are breathtaking.  Loaded with soft focus shots, the film did a great job of relaying the story- in good detail.  By then end of the movie, I am always baffled by the careless nature of the wealthy characters.   My only complaint with this film in its present form is the music.  Please note that the VHS copy available in stores now does not contain the original score by Nelson Riddle. It has been overdubbed with creepy soap opera like music.  This is very disappointing, because the score is FABULOUS! It is one of my favorite records-yes, vinyl. It is only available now used on vinyl.  So, if you buy this movie, the soundtrack you will get [is bad].
6305903182|4.0|Four long rip-off filled years after the world was first introduced to the world of Sydney Prescott, Deputy Dewey, and Ghostface, Director Wes Craven released the highly anticipated sequel Scream 3, the third and final chapter of what would ultimately became one of the most affectionately beloved horror franchises of the 1990's, to the world. For all of his fans around the globe who had considerably shoved the previous Screams to immense commercial dominance and lasting cultural impact around the world, Craven was authoring one last concluding passage to the films that film audiences eventually would realize was originally intended to be a Trilogy by Scream creator/screen writer Kevin Williamson himself. This alarmingly frank yet insidiously cunning last major innovation of the series that defined 90's horror allows Scream to defiantly defy cinematic trends, rules, and formulas once again by choosing the method, style, and course of it's demise. Just like it's inception, the Scream series seared through its life cycle and the Hollywood establishment like a blaze of glory eliminating the old and creating a gamut where new ideas and innovation could grow out of the ashes of Hollywood's deplorable repetition of thought.<br />As for Scream 3's tale, we pick up our story a few years after the traumatic events of Scream 2; Hollywood is still reaping some insanely lucrative rewards from the past two homicidal rampages that directly involved poor psychologically troubled Sydney Prescott and her friends. On the set of Stab 3, some unusual trappings of malice begin to develop as cast members, familiar Scream faces making cameo appearances, and crew members start to turn up slaughtered and covered with cryptic photographs of a strangely familiar young woman who may have been an actress in Los Angeles back in the Golden Age of Hollywood. This baffles authorities who bring in Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dwight &quot;Dewey&quot; Riley (David Arquette) to investigatethe similar Modus Operandi of these killings with that of the previous Ghostface sightings. Is there a correlation between these incidents? How does Sydney play in to all of this? What further mysteries exist in the mythology of the Scream pictures? These and many more doubts are questions that you're going to have to determine for your self by watching this terrifically savvy movie, but I promise you won't be dissatisfied by what you see.<br />Scream 3 conclusively wraps up the Scream Trilogy narrative with profuse intelligence, engaging enthusiasm, plentiful trademark horror references, all the familiar faces that are alive and not (No there's nothing supernatural in this movie. Just watch!), characteristically virtuoso Craven directorial touches that bring Scream back to it's thriller based roots, the rapidly stellar satirical touches of the previous films, and another radiantly extraordinary performance by Neve Campbell to decisively create another daringly original horror film form Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson.<br />As for Scream 3's DVD edition, it includes a stellar anamorphic widescreen presentation, a revealing Wes Craven commentary track, deleted scenes, a deleted alternate ending with Wes Craven commentary, Creed's &quot;What If&quot; Music Video, and series outtakes from all three films to solidify a very consumer friendly package. A Must for any true Horror Fan. <br />A Must-See!
B0000029DD|5.0|A real class act. Jeff Buckley made music from the heart. To those who don't get it, I say give it a few more listens. Buckley's voice and music are too textured to appreciate in one sitting. His original works like Mojo Pin, So Real, and Lover You Should've Come Over are prime examples of his talent.<br />I first heard Grace in '94 and it's still in my CD player. Music this timeless doesn't come around often. Jeff Buckley left us too soon, but he left us with soulful, moving music that many artists can't create in a lifetime.
B000002OX7|5.0|I was born one year after this album was released.  Through out my life, I have had to reach back to grab music with inspiration.  I have had my feel with the Stones and the Beatles, but I have never been so blown away by an album as I was with Who's Next.  It is definetly a great remedy for lack luster tunes that artist are putting out these days.  A MUST have album.  Completely ahead of its time.
B000002GA8|3.0|This is the album fourty year olds can hunt teenage kids with today. I'm 23 and I like this album from an eccentric point of view. It's the most pretentious piece of plastic I've ever heard bar Gentle Giant. I like listening to stuff nobody does today, so this album is really cool.<BR>The music itself is ridiculous. Not to be taken seriously.<BR>Catch your local punks and lock 'em up with that record playing nonstop. They'll be praying for a bit of &quot;Close to the edge&quot;!
B00000JMQE|5.0|This is one of my favorite childhood movies (also Neverending Story, Dark Crystal, and the Goonies).  All of these movies are slightly scary and very &quot;dark&quot; - perfect examples of 80's treasures.<BR>Fairuza Balk is even cuter as a 10-year-old then she is now (and that's pretty cute!) and she makes this movie precious.<BR>This film was out of  print for a while, but then was re-released as a collector's edition clamshell VHS and DVD.  The DVD doesn't have anything more than the VHS - they both have an interview with a much older Fairuza.<BR>I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves fantasy and the darker kind of movies.<BR>(P.S. - it's NOT a musical)

For all of his fans around the globe who had considerably shoved the previous Screams to immense commercial dominance and lasting cultural impact around the world, Craven was authoring one last concluding passage to the films that film audiences eventually would realize was originally intended to be a Trilogy by Scream creator/screen writer Kevin Williamson himself. This alarmingly frank yet insidiously cunning last major innovation of the series that defined 90's horror allows Scream to defiantly defy cinematic trends, rules, and formulas once again by choosing the method, style, and course of it's demise. Just like it's inception, the Scream series seared through its life cycle and the Hollywood establishment like a blaze of glory eliminating the old and creating a gamut where new ideas and innovation could grow out of the ashes of Hollywood's deplorable repetition of thought.<br />As for Scream 3's tale, we pick up our story a few years after the traumatic events of Scream 2; Hollywood is still reaping some insanely lucrative rewards from the past two homicidal rampages that directly involved poor psychologically troubled Sydney Prescott and her friends. On the set of Stab 3, some unusual trappings of malice begin to develop as cast members, familiar Scream faces making cameo appearances, and crew members start to turn up slaughtered and covered with cryptic photographs of a strangely familiar young woman who may have been an actress in Los Angeles back in the Golden Age of Hollywood. This baffles authorities who bring in Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dwight &quot;Dewey&quot; Riley (David Arquette) to investigatethe similar Modus Operandi of these killings with that of the previous Ghostface sightings. Is there a correlation between these incidents? How does Sydney play in to all of this? What further mysteries exist in the mythology of the Scream pictures? These and many more doubts are questions that you're going to have to determine for your self by watching this terrifically savvy movie, but I promise you won't be dissatisfied by what you see.<br />Scream 3 conclusively wraps up the Scream Trilogy narrative with profuse intelligence, engaging enthusiasm, plentiful trademark horror references, all the familiar faces that are alive and not (No there's nothing supernatural in this movie. Just watch!), characteristically virtuoso Craven directorial touches that bring Scream back to it's thriller based roots, the rapidly stellar satirical touches of the previous films, and another radiantly extraordinary performance by Neve Campbell to decisively create another daringly original horror film form Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson.<br />As for Scream 3's DVD edition, it includes a stellar anamorphic widescreen presentation, a revealing Wes Craven commentary track, deleted scenes, a deleted alternate ending with Wes Craven commentary, Creed's &quot;What If&quot; Music Video, and series outtakes from all three films to solidify a very consumer friendly package. A Must for any true Horror Fan. <br />A Must-See!

0452282152|5.0|I read this book very quickly, but found myself (and still do) coming back again and again to re-read bits of it.  It's a story that stays with you long after you turn that final page.<br />Don't be fooled by the &quot;simple&quot; writing style.  If you think the narrative is simple, I suggest sitting down and trying to write something-- anything!-- in Chevalier's style.  It's a lot harder than it looks to convey a wealth of description with a bare minimum of words.  That is one of Chevalier's greatest gifts in this book.  The other is her simply marvelous characters, and her amazing ability to convey the essence of everyday life in a distant time and place.<br />Enough reviewers have summed up the plot here, so I won't add to their efforts, except to say that all the details fall together very nicely, and the story's conclusion satisfies on many levels.<br />I would imagine that someone will eventually make a movie out of this book; it's the kind of story Merchant-Ivory would probably bring to life brilliantly.  My top pick for the role of Griet would be Natalie Portman.  Ralph Finnes should play Vermeer, and Tilda Swinton should play Catharina.
6304539258|4.0|I didn't know it then, but this film's special effects were extraordinary when I first saw the movie. Even though the effects are simplistic today, there's a certain nostalgia for the story. I have the Special Edition Trilogy VHS set sold in the late 1990's and really enjoy owning it.
6305311463|1.0|Micheal Bay is a great cinematographer, but leaves much to be desired in terms of story direction and substance. Lets also not leave out the fact that he has no shame is manipulating the audience emotions to the point where its laughable. I actually went to school with this guy, but sorry go back to directing music videos and commercials Micheal.
B000002RXS|3.0|This recording would have been sort of ultimate......if Callas had kept her yap shut.<BR>The conducting is splendid and the rest of the cast are very much at home in this work, giving it a great opera-comique 'feel' as opposed to the standard 'big-hit' approach.<BR>But with all respect and apologies to anyone who is offended by this, but I really cannot stand Callas. She has a great control over vibrato and the tone could have been so beautiful, but why o why did she always sound like she sings with her mouth closed. It's very unpleasant to listen to and her other vocal gifts don't make up for it. It's like a really talented painter using his toes instead of the best equipment he can use.<BR>It's a shame such a talented singer did make such ugly sounds.<BR>Nevertheless, skipping Callas, this set is excellent, esp. in the choral department, which is quite a treat.
B00000892G|5.0|Incredable CD! Now I grew up listening to groups like Iron Maiden,Sabbath,Judas Priest...ect, this CD blows them all away.I bought Virgin Steele's very first album(yes it was an album, not a CD!)about 15 years ago then never heard from them again till now. I can honestly say Invictus is the best recorded piece of music i have ever heard!If you like metal music with a singer who can actualy sing then get this CD now, as well as House of Atreus act1 and II.
B000005JA8|5.0|Hello. I'm thirteen, I wanted you to know this because thirteen year olds get a bad rap for listening to crappy new music, I don't. Trout Mask Replica is one of the most important albums in Rock history, also see freak out with Frank Zappa. Choice picks would be Dali's car, Sugar 'n Spikes and everything nice 'n everything nice and crazy, sorry I cant help it, Hobo Chang ba, Ella Guru, Well, veteran's day poppy, and Moonlight on Vermont. Fallin' Ditch is great because of the Rockette Morton Scetch: <br />Now we won't have to worry about Rockette Morton with any of those girls.<br />Whooosh: Rockette Morton Takes off again into the wind!<br />What do you run on Rockette Morton? *say beans* <br />I run on beans. I run on laserbeans. <br />He He He He .<br />  Ya see what I mean? Anyway, you won't like this the first time you hear it, even I didn't and that's sayin' alot 'cause I loved UMMAGUMMA the first time I heard it. It helps to have listened to ome other Beefheart stuff before this because it's hard to digest, see safe as milk. Frank Zappa's even less weird. Just give TMR a chance 'cause it may be the most important thing you ever hear. Buy this. <BR>   <BR>  If you already have this I suggest you get some other blues stuff like Muddy Waters or Howlin' Wolf. Also Frank Zappa and Luis Armstrong. Of course if you hate it like the guy who gave it a one, not only are you a poor misguided soul but I'm not gonna suggest anything for you. Good bye.
0871137380|5.0|This book is a can't put down read.Very gripping and intense.It captures the people involved and shows that they are really human and also very good military men.It IS a must read.Cannot wait for the authors next book.Also if you have not read &quot;Bravo two Zero&quot; do!It is also a very very excellent read should not be passed by!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I don't care that these guys are from new york and i don't care how much the album was hyped, that s--t doesn't matter, what matters is this is an excellent album, the best i've heard in a while, and you're a fool if you let that other stuff get in the way.
B00004TWZF|4.0|I've only seen the American version. I must say, It haunted me for two days. So utterly tragically beautifull.
B00005Q45W|3.0|I would have liked to hear a few more upbeat songs on this album,but all in all I liked it.
0140288503|5.0|This book is the literary equivalent of the opening 20 minutes in Saving Private Ryan, except that the carnage goes on endlessly.  I had no idea that the Moghadishu situation was so completely *&amp;!^ed--that literally the entire city was armed and firing at American soldiers wherever they were out in the open.<br />Consider this the modern treatise on the reality of urban warfare, should we unfortunate enough to have to engage an enemy in these kind of surroundings.<br />It is a miracle that only 18 (&quot;only&quot;) were lost, based on the circumstances.  Unbelievable.<br />You won't put it down.  I didn't.  Finished it in two sittings.<br />Tragic.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I really enjoy this album and cannot wait for her new one to come out. I am not a big fan of pop music, but Britney's music is just so catchy and fun, I cannot help but to like it. What a lot of people complain about is the way she dresses and how she doesn't write her own music. Although I don't like the way she dresses and she doesn't write her own music, she is a great entertainer. She is an awesome dancer! You have to take her for what she truly is, not compare her to something she isn't. As for all the other girls in pop (Christina, Jessica, Mandy...etc) I think they are just trying to ride off of Britney's fame!
B00005A1PR|4.0|india arie's acoustic soul album is filled with rich guitar strumming and r&amp;b grooves. my favorite is brown skin and simple, just by the way she sings ... her lyrics don't have to be articulate, her voice carries the sensuality of the songs. her &quot;brown skin&quot; track is what marvin gaye's &quot;let's get it on&quot; does for some people. i realy liked acoustic soul and still listen to it after months have gone by.

0783223668|5.0|John Wayne told Clint Eastwood he hated High Plains Drifter. You can't get a better endorsement than that. Wayne called the movie \\"unamerican.\\" I say that's (...). The entire movie is totally in support of the American ethos: Undermine the establishment, turn the tables as an outsider and get revenge. The stuff this great country was made of. Some of the best one liners ever delivered too, my favorite, \\"Here's to your feet mam, they're almost as big as your mouth.\\" Westerns don't get better than this. Even film fans who aren't big fans of westerns (which I'm not) can't help but get drawn into this cool-guy-screws-over-the-hicks opus. Form up the Lago Volunteers and ride on.<BR>Your most humble and loyal servant,<BR>Dixonator<BR>Fort Pierce, Florida
B00003CXGP|4.0|Christian Bale plays a yuppie on wall street with some serious mental issues. The attitude of the movie is sarcastic and mostly humorous. The actors do a good job of following the look and feel of the movie- everything is a little corny.<BR>Patrick Bateman (Bale) has only a few emotions. Two are greed and disgust, and the third is an uncontrollable urge to kill, which is his only escape from a dull and dreary life.<br />Due to the many complaints about this movie, I will state the obvious: this movie has a lot of killing in it. The presence of the word \\"psycho\\" would tip most people off, but just in case it's not for squeemish folks. But even being squeemish won't ruin it, as there is very little visible violence. In most cases, the victims are not shown much during the attack. It's about as tastefull as you can get when it comes to killing people. The most graphic displays are Bateman's pencil sketches.<br />The movie contains elements of satire, but the personalities of his friends were chosen to provide Bateman's personality a suitable environment, filled with others that don't find his outward displays of greed and concietedness odd. The movie may contain a lot of poking around, but the focus is definitely on the psychological aspect of Bateman- the ridiculous decade takes the back seat.<br />That brings us to the intellectual aspect of it. You could watch the movie without really paying attention to what happens, and just laugh at goofy scenes and yuppies. But one only has to listen to the dialog at the end to get the main idea.<br />For the benefit of those that don't get it (in order to preserve the surprise, I will leave one part explained), in the beginning Bateman kills out of boredom and addictive impulse. Only after his great frustration with the jarring issue at the end does he become frustrated with hopelessness and truly sadistic. He then suggests he will kill for the actual satisfaction of watching others suffer to make up for his own mental pain (abig difference when it comes to the rehabilitation issue, which is not addressed). This is all spelled out in the movie, with the exception of transferring vengeance to murder, but by that time we can hardly reason to doubt his inclusion of murder as an option. Since the mood of most of the movie tends to put you in a watch-only mode, I can see how some people might need to watch the last couple minutes over again, as the resolution is 99% dialog.<br />A few corrections to common comments. First, there are no real cries for help. Bateman reveals himself to drunk/drugged people for his own amusement (one of which he is already carrying out his plan to kill). His only serious confession is near the end, and becomes necessary for the plot, so there is no reason to believe the movie is about the armchair psychology of \\"cries for help.\\" Second, the is no men/women sexism, or at least no preference. The men are selfish pigs, the women are too emotional, and both are equally promiscuous. They're all scum. Also, there are almost no similarities to Fight Club. Sure, the main characters are both nuts (though they have completely different disorders), and there is violence in it. Not much of a match. I find two real connections myself. One being that both movies require the viewer to be light hearted and not too emotional about violence (which leads to emotional types to classify them as both too violent, and thus the same). The other is that unobservant critics make the same mistake about both: they fail to comprehend that the main characters are crazy (and therefore the films purpose is not to promote whatever they do) and try to draw cliche statements about society as the theme.<br />Finally, if you are the type that needs to have a hero in every movie, this is not for you. Much like the Mel Gibson flick \\"Payback,\\" the movie is full of unscrupulous characters, including the protagonist. To really enjoy the movie, you have to laugh at ridiculous and trite murder.

0780625129|5.0|This movie was incredible.  Even as an avid fan of Edward Norton's, I don't think that I'm exaggerating at all when I say that his performance in this movie was nothing short of spectacular.  Even though it is somewhat disturbing and definitely deserving of its R rating, this movie is something that should be required viewing for everyone over the age of 18.  Its compelling insight regarding Neo-Nazism, racism, and family issues delivers a powerful and shocking blow to even the most cynical viewer.  Be prepared as you watch; the movie deals with incredibly heavy subject matter in a brutally honest way, but it will definitely leave you changed, or at the very least, dumbfounded.  If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about; if you haven't, you DO NOT know what you're missing.
B00005JKOV|5.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; is the rare kind of movie that makes your jaw drop in more ways than one.  It's worth the price of admission (more than once, in my opinion) just to behold the 'rotoscoping' animation.  Shot in digital film with real actors, a team of animators painted over each frame to produce an eery balance between realism and fantasy.  Colors reflect a character's emotions at a given time, shapes distort to express thematic conclusions, and lines themselves vibrate with a universal energy.  The visuals are beautiful and hypnotic.<br />What's equally impressive (and perfectly complementary to the animation) is the exposition of &quot;Waking Life&quot;.  I hesitate to say 'plot' (although the film does build on itself), since the main character (Wiley Wiggins) wanders from person to person in an attempt to understand the world around him.  The film is largely a combination of monologues and soliloquies on the nature of dreams, reality, life, death, free will, and everything in between.  Wiggins' character can't figure out what's happening to him - he seemingly wakes from dream after dream, wondering if he's really awake.<br />What I find exhilirating may be frustrating for others, but if you have the chance to see &quot;Waking Life&quot;, don't miss it.  It's a cinematic masterpiece.
B000003NA4|5.0|It's been a few years since I acquired this CD, but it remains a favorite in my collection of Krall's offerings so far, along with her &quot;When I Look In Your Eyes&quot; CD.  If you enjoy the old standards delivered in the warm, intimate personal style of yesteryear, with a touch of modern stylistics that typifies Krall, this CD is definitely for you.  Not only does her voice entrance you, the girl can tinkle those ivories with a finesse that sends you to Heaven and back again. &quot;You Can't Take That Away From Me&quot; and &quot;How Deep Is the Ocean&quot; are the best cuts showcasing her natural and brilliant talent as a jazz pianist.  Some jazz pianists dirty the waters with too much &quot;fill.&quot; Krall, however, leaves open spaces that exhibit wise restraint, leaving the perfect framing for her smooth, sultry, and when appropriate, playful and flirty voice.  I don't know how she does it, but Krall's less is MORE. And it works. She brings out the pureness of the standards. How many artists' voices can get by with only a trio of piano, bass and guitar with no &quot;air brushing&quot; and still achieve perfection?  The close supper club feel of this CD keeps me coming back for more. Curl up with a nice glass of wine and relax to the welcome sounds of a jazz diva without a lot of hype. It doesn't get much better than the effervescent &quot;Peel Me a Grape&quot; or the cool moodiness of &quot;Gentle Rain.&quot;  Though I've tried, I honestly haven't found a cut on this CD that I don't thoroughly enjoy. If I can't be Ella or Clooney, then Diana Krall is who I want to be musically when I grow up!
0448060191|4.0|The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support.  The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War.  Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future.  The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match.  The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character.  The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style.  The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind.  The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I, being a huge Kubrick fan, really enjoyed this version of the DVD Dr. Strangelove. the original release didn't have any of the extras contained on the disk. There are two documentaries: 1.)a short doc. on Kubrick's films for the early years of &quot;Day of the Fight&quot; and &quot;Fear and Desire&quot; upto his masterpiece &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;. The other documentary is about the production of Stangelove, very interesting tid-bits on how the master worked. <BR>      As for the film itself, it is in tip-top shape from video to audio, no complaints from me. If you're a Kubrick fan this disk is excellent.
B00005QATY|5.0|This has to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. It was not what I expected. I figured with George Clooney in it, that it would be a drama. Didn't know he did comedy. <br />I highly recommend this movie for those who want a really good laugh.
B000056K04|3.0|Being a huge DMB fan I anxiously awaited the arrival of their much talked about new album. But before Everyday came out I had heard of the album being leaked onto the internet.  This was not Everyday but rather the songs tagged as the Lillywhite sessions. Steve Lilywhite being their old producer.  These were the songs that the band had intended to release, but scrapped at the last minute. So instead in the stores we get Everyday a much lighter, happier, pop sound to DMB. On the other hand, the Lilywhites are show a darker, more emotional side of the band. Immediately I preferred the Lilywhite Sessions. But upon seeing the band live this past summer, where they played songs from Everyday AND the Lillywhite sessions an equal appreciation formed for both. Songs like So Right from Everyday and Gray Street from the Lillywhites sound amazing live. I think both provide the band with a great depth that a lot of bands today are lacking.
B000002JB3|5.0|I wrote an older review back in late 2001 and even now, I see this album as underrated. In light of the Deluxe Edition that was reissued, I wanted to update my old review in light of the bonus material on the reissued version.<br /><br />  I originally wrote a review on “Dance Into The Light” back in late 2001. Back then I thought it was another great album albeit his weakest of his solo albums. I still really like “Dance Into The Light” and in hindsight see it as another distinct chapter of his career. It was overall the slowest of his albums to grow on me but ultimately became another great addition to his catalog.<br /><br /> The album cover conveys the overall mood of the album as it marked a complete 180 from the previous album, &#34;Both Sides&#34; as it completely discarded the cold and gloomy beauty and brought back some of the trademark sounds of his first two albums. Some of the songs have a much more 'live' feel, as in having limited electronic or ambient sounds. &#34;That's What You Said&#34;, and &#34;It's In Your Eyes&#34; are examples with an overall 'live' feel.<br /><br /> One of the the unique things is that this album experimented with world music, particularly African drumbeats. While it has drawn some comparisons, even unfavorable ones, to his Genesis counterpart Peter Gabriel's use of African drums, it totally works great on this album. &#34;Lorenzo&#34; and &#34;River So Wide&#34; have heavy use of world rhythms. &#34;Lorenzo&#34; is among my favorite songs on this album as with African flutes as an intro before it develops into an epic theme with a marvelous combination of his trademark drum sounds and African drums. &#34;River So Wide&#34; is an intense theme song that begins with a somewhat suspenseful intro and develops into a high-energy theme with heavy African drums with heavy rock. It serves as a prelude to the &#34;Tarzan&#34; soundtrack he did just a few years later.<br /><br /> My reason for returning is to write on the Deluxe Edition of this album and the bonus material. As a lifelong fan of Collins it is especially a treat to see a deluxe treatment of an underrated album. First off the remastering is incredible even though the sound quality of the original was still good to begin with. All of the songs sound so much clearer and with greatly improved sound.<br /><br /> The second disc contains an odd mix of live recordings of songs from the subsequent tour, some B-Sides, and demo versions of some of the songs that made it onto the album. The disc begins with five live recordings of &#34;Dance Into The Light&#34;, &#34;Just Another Story&#34;, &#34;Wear My Hat&#34; and then the double-duo of &#34;River So Wide&#34; and &#34;Take Me Down&#34;.<br /><br /> The demo version of “Lorenzo” is the winner here. This song saw Phil delve into African drum rhythms for the second time in his career (1989’s “Colours” had some African rhythms), a trend that his counterpart Peter Gabriel had already been doing for many years. The demo version of this song feels very different from the original and is absolutely incredible to listen to. Where as most of his demos feature Phil with wordless singing (A normal part of lyric-writing) but here, his lyrics were already clearly already written. The original version kind of feels similar to “Find a Way To My Heart” but with heavier African influences including the lyrical themes. The drums and Phil’s vocals are especially prominent and upfront and clearly heard. In the demo version, these things are far more subtle and the song in it’s demo version is far more ethereal and atmospheric and the overall feel of the song is completely different. The somewhat rock-like feel of the original version is replaced by heavier keyboard presence. In fact, had it not been labeled a ‘demo’ version, I would’ve guessed this was an alternate version that Phil recorded but for some reason did not choose to include on the original album. The original version, Phil’s voice is up front and clear. On the demo, his vocals, while still clear, blend much more into the overall background texture and he sounds like he’s singing from miles away. The “Oh oh who! In East Africa!....” passage is far more surreal. And then the part where he sings about being far away from his “friends and the dolphins” is mesmerizing! Overall, the ‘demo’ version is one of the few that I can actually say is superior to the so-called ‘finished’ version on the regular album. I’ve had my share of letdowns on some B-Sides or demos not being included on his ‘deluxe editions’ of his albums but it is a real delight to have THIS ‘demo’ version on here.<br /><br /> The disc closes out with three B-Sides, all of which are truly wonderful to include on here. &#34;Another Time&#34; is a beautiful song that to be quite frank, beats out most of the songs that made it onto the album. I think this should've been included on the original album and it could've helped it enjoy greater chart success than it got but still, it's great to have this song included on the deluxe edition. &#34;It's Over&#34; is a very quiet and melancholy balled that harkens back to the the &#34;Both Sides&#34; era with a mournful and ethereal feel with a keyboard in the front and ambient production in the background that then bursts into a cry of Scottish bagpipes towards the end. This is another lovely track that should've made it onto the album. &#34;I Don't Want to Go&#34; utilizes the unusual 12-string guitar strings of &#34;That's What You Said&#34; and &#34;Love Police&#34; but with a faster rhythm. It serves as a great closer to the bonus disc.<br /><br /> Overall, since I first reviewed this album, &#34;Dance Into The Light&#34; struggled for a while to hold it's own against it's predecessors but eventually became another gem on it's own merit. Today, with the deluxe expanded edition and the excellent bonus material, this album went from being recommended for the dedicated fans to highly recommended just for the 'Demo' version of &#34;Lorenzo&#34; and &#34;It's Over&#34;. Those two alone warrant buying this expanded edition.<br /><br /> His Deluxe Editions of his solo reissues have left a lot to be desired especially since far more demos are available out there and there are B-Sides that remain in the realm of bootlegs or rare vinyl singles but when it comes to this album, this is probably my favorite reissue of his catalog.<br /><br />(Archived Old Review Dated October 26, 2001)<br /><br /> An underrapreciated gem<br /><br />Phil Collins took a daring new turn in his music with this excellent but sadly underrated masterpiece. The music on here is less ambient, more optimistic and generally more upbeat than the dark depressing masterpiece Both Sides. There is some African sound on a few songs here.<br />Dance Into The Light is a fun, upbeat, almost tropical song with lots of trumpets. It's like a backlash at I Cant Dance from several years before. It's a great song that you should give a listen to. That's What You Said is a cool with a more acoustic sound. Lorenzo is a beatiful song with some African drums combined with African flutes and phat beats. It's one of my favorites on this CD. Just Another Story is a laid back song with a light beat and a high pitched trumpet like the kind that Miles Davis played. It's kind of a song that I would play when walking down a city street approaching downtown. Love Police is a great simple song. It's a little hard to describe exaclty how it sounds like but it's a must hear. Wear My Hat is the fastest song on this CD. It's very tropical sounding with some Jamaican drums and some Big Band horns. It's In Your Eyes is an OK song. I'm not very moved by this one. Probably one of the most boring tracks Phil has ever written. It's not bad but average. Oughta Know by now brings back the Phil that we know from the But Seriously days with the thundering beats and the great guitar playing. It sounds kinda like I Wish It Would Rain Down but not quite as 'BIG' sounding. Take Me Down is a very groovy song with a strong big band sound. I play this one alot. It's one of my favorites on this CD. The Same is a haunting song with a dark sound kind of like Father To Son from But Seriously. I love how the last five seconds fades out into the next song. River So Wide is the winner on this CD. It a very intense song with thundering drums and heavy guitars that make the perfect song for a jungle action movie. No Matter is acoustic song similar to It's In Your Eyes but better. Not my favorite but good. The Times They Are A Changing is a great closer to this CD. Its a very well done cover version of the 1963 version done by Bob Dylan. The beats are phat.<br />This CD will have to grow on you but in the end you'll love it. I do. I listen to this one a lot. While it may be his weakest solo album to date that does not make this CD less than five stars. Go out and buy it. I recommend this one.ion of &#34;Lorenzo&#34; and &#34;It's Over&#34;. Those two alone warrant buying this expanded edition.    His Deluxe Editions of his solo reissues have left a lot to be desired especially since far more demos are available out there and there are B-Sides that remain in the realm of bootlegs or rare vinyl singles but when it comes to this album, this is probably my favorite reissue of his catalog.   (Archived Old Review Dated October 26, 2001)   An underrapreciated gem  Phil Collins took a daring new turn in his music with this excellent but sadly underrated masterpiece. The music on here is less ambient, more optimistic and generally more upbeat than the dark depressing masterpiece Both Sides. There is some African sound on a few songs here. Dance Into The Light is a fun, upbeat, almost tropical song with lots of trumpets. It's like a backlash at I Cant Dance from several years before. It's a great song that you should give a listen to. That's What You Said is a cool with a more acoustic sound. Lorenzo is a beatiful song with some African drums combined with African flutes and phat beats. It's one of my favorites on this CD. Just Another Story is a laid back song with a light beat and a high pitched trumpet like the kind that Miles Davis played. It's kind of a song that I would play when walking down a city street approaching downtown. Love Police is a great simple song. It's a little hard to describe exaclty how it sounds like but it's a must hear. Wear My Hat is the fastest song on this CD. It's very tropical sounding with some Jamaican drums and some Big Band horns. It's In Your Eyes is an OK song. I'm not very moved by this one. Probably one of the most boring tracks Phil has ever written. It's not bad but average. Oughta Know by now brings back the Phil that we know from the But Seriously days with the thundering beats and the great guitar playing. It sounds kinda like I Wish It Would Rain Down but not quite as 'BIG' sounding. Take Me Down is a very groovy song with a strong big band sound. I play this one alot. It's one of my favorites on this CD. The Same is a haunting song with a dark sound kind of like Father To Son from But Seriously. I love how the last five seconds fades out into the next song. River So Wide is the winner on this CD. It a very intense song with thundering drums and heavy guitars that make the perfect song for a jungle action movie. No Matter is acoustic song similar to It's In Your Eyes but better. Not my favorite but good. The Times They Are A Changing is a great closer to this CD. Its a very well done cover version of the 1963 version done by Bob Dylan. The beats are phat. This CD will have to grow on you but in the end you'll love it. I do. I listen to this one a lot. While it may be his weakest solo album to date that does not make this CD less than five stars. Go out and buy it. I recommend this one.
B00005O3VD|5.0|I have waited and waited and I am pleased to announce that the wait was well worth it. Having seen Funny Girl many times in its pan and scan version, I was very eager to see what I'd been missing all these years. The restored widescreen version makes this usually enjoyable film even more so. The colors are brilliant, the images crisp, and the restored letterbox format really adds to the overall brilliance of the cinematography. I will say that although I have a top of the line home theater sound system, I didn't notice a remarkable improvement in sound, but Streisand still sounded incredible! I would strongly urge anyone who is a fan of Streisand, or the American musical to purchase this DVD.
B00005OAA6|4.0|Poor Posh Spice. She can't seem to get a break. Whether it be defending herself against tabloid rumors or defending her family's privacy, she can't seem to win. Her record company doesn't seem keen on doing her any favors either. In their far from infinite wisdom, the execs thought they would stage a singles battle of the &quot;pop princesses&quot; between Beckham and UK chart icon Kylie Minogue with disastrous results for Beckham.Not only was she trounced thoroughly on the singles front, but this project arrived the same day as Minogue's FEVER, which again soundly obliterated Beckham(and the rest)on its' way to Number One. Which is all quite sad considering that Beckham has delivered a thoroughly engaging album, something that has surprised no one more than me. Let's start with the singing, which has improved by leaps and bounds since the Spices' first record--though she may never possess the greatest range, you have to admit that her vocals go down far smoother than the harsh, accent-ravaged singing of either of the Mels or even ex-Spice Geri Halliwell. As for the songs, well there are some definite strong moments here--first single 'Not Such An Innocent Girl', though dismissed on the charts quite briskly, is far from the travesty everybody is proclaiming it to be. Among the stronger cuts, you've got the garage-styled 'Midnight Fantasy',the electronica-spiked ballad 'I.O.U.', and the pop-funk of 'No Trix, No Games'. While there are some downturns--'Girlfriend' and 'I Wish' are both third-rate Destiny's Child rip-offs--they make only a small ripple in an otherwise surprisingly solid debut.
0792846710|5.0|If you like horror films, this might be for you.<br />This movie is hysterical.  I mean, killer clowns?  From outter space?  OH BOY.  With the sick, twisted aliens around, a small town is struck with the same fear of clowns I am.  This movie won't scare you, but it is enjoyable, nonetheless.  If you like the cheesey horror genre, this movie is for you.

014028009X|5.0|A year in the life of a singleton.  This book is soooo great!  A complete trip~you will laugh out loud and never want it to end. This is the number one book i recommend to all my girlfriends.  if you didn't like the movie, it's ok, b/c the movie was loosly based on the book.  Like i said run don't walk to get this book.
0385474547|5.0|This book caught my attention from the very first page. I was impressed how the author made sure to not resort to any stereotypes (even though he is from Nigeria himself), but made sure the reader knew this wasn't some &quot;primitive tribe&quot;, as many other books may depict Africa. However, I wasn't really hit until the last chapter. Don't worry I won't give away the ending, but for those of you who have read it, it was the very last sentence that shocked me and really made me realize what the whole book was about, even though it wasn't revealed until the very end. I recommend this book to everybody.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Buy this CD and listen to it more than once before you judge it.  Some pieces grab you right away, some may take longer, but they are ALL very well crafted works of art.  Pyramid song, Dollars and Cents, Like Spinning Plates and Life in a Glass House are all incredible (and none of the songs on the whole cd sound alike either).  My personal favourite is Pulk/Pull revolving doors; a truly innovative song that tells us about the different doors we must walk through in life.  Including those that &quot;you can't come back from&quot;.  Weird song, no question about it, but unique, interesting and funky as well.<br />I rank Amnesiac as the second best Radiohead album (Ok Computer being number one, Kid A at number 3, and The Bends at number 4).
B00004Y87I|5.0|Like Steven Foster's folk song, which Virginia Mayo tinkles on the piano, this film is simple but perfect, i.e. simply perfect.<BR>It's laughable and lovable, thrilling and romantic. Danny and Virginia are a dream team, this one being their best collaboration. This movie has been a life's companion to me, since I saw it at the age of four or five.
B00005QG9J|3.0|Actually 3.5.<BR>When I first listened to the CD, I did not like it.  I must admit that is growing on me, but I expected a little more.  Don't get me wrong, the albulm is good, they just seemed to melllow out a bit.

0425180638|5.0|This was my second Patricia Cornwell novel; I couldn't wait to get the next one--disappointed that it isn't a Kay Scarpetta novel! I bought some earlier novels of Cornwell's (Southern Cross and Hornets Nest) which I can't get interested in.  I love Kay Scarpetta!  More More!!!
B00005IBGQ|5.0|I have the highest praise for this new album by darling Rufus.  I really loved his first album, but this one is so much more sophisticated musically, and the lyrics are just as good as ever!   I listen to it several times a day, I sing along with it at full volume, I raise an eyebrow at the provocative wit of California and Greek Song, and I can't wait for more.  I even caught my husband dancing around to Shadows!  My interpretation of the changes between Poses and the first album is that this new music is more mature and edgy than the reflective &quot;popera&quot; he brought us previously.  I adored the frequent teasing silliness of the first album, but that style has its time and place.  Poses is so much more adult to me.  It has plenty of humor, but the humor comes from adult knowledge, choice, and awareness.
B00005R87Q|5.0|If you like fast cars and a pretty decent plot, check this movie out. I am a speed freak myself and it was quite a rush.  Best with 26&quot; TV (or bigger) and surround sound turned up very loud.
B000008806|4.0|Air's first album 'Moon Safari' is the least brilliant of the band's albums so far.<br />Still, it is a very worthwile buy.<br />Sometimes it sounds like music which can be used for tv series, like 'Talisman'. Or 'Ce Matin Là' with its horn sounds and bubbling synths.<br />The spacey 'Sexy Boy' is very early-1980ish and must be a dance floor hit. Funny and great track, a lot more optimistic and relaxed than most Air stuff. 'Kelly Watch The Stars' is another great song - the favourite song of many an Air fan. The way it uses the synthesizer effects is simple but well-arranged in the smallest detail.<br />At the lower end of the scale are the two songs on which Beth Hirsch sings the lead vocals. Her far to fragile and not particularly charming voice bore these compositions down to close-to-nothing.

B000002HPV|1.0|In a way, it is extraordinary that Bj&ouml;rk's avantgardistic music is such a commercial success. Already the opening track of 'Homogenic', the eccentrically produced 'Hunter', is some challenge for the ear and for the mind. And thus not an obvious easy-seller...<br />Bj&ouml;rk's voice is propped up very well with the violins and the synth drumbeat on 'J&oacute;ga'. In fact this one is the only worthwile song on 'Homogenic', although it is another proof that Bj&ouml;rk does not have a voice shaped for singing which is probably why the producers of her music experiment as eccentrically as they do.<br />This sound combination, however interesting, is used on several tracks. But it does not turn out particularly attractive on a song like '5 Years', often even just boring like on 'Immature'. And the computerized Bj&ouml;rk scream on 'Pluto' is rightout unbearable!<br />'Unravel' is a much better attempt. Probably meant to be a ballad but the expressiveness of Bj&ouml;rk's voice makes this impossible.<br />The single 'Bachelorette', with its bombastic arrangement and dramatized violins, sounds like something from a USAmerican musical. It remains the album's second best track, fairly worth listening to in fact.

B00004TLN3|5.0|I've read a lot of opinions by other Jane Austen fans.  I guess I'm untraditional because although I love all the film adaptations (NA completing my JA collection) I like NA the most as a book, and tied with Persuasion as a film.  Despite being shot a while ago, without big money, I liked it through and through - the actors were fantastic (Peter Firth's Henry Tilney is MY favourite Austen hero), I think I'm the only person who liked the soundtrack that went with it (and wish I had it on CD), and it was the film that made me read the book.  Some complain that the book's ending is a bit abrupt and doesn't tie up &quot;loose ends&quot;, well, as long as you get the usual Jane Austen happy ending that's all you can ask for - perfection is in the eye of the beholder.  Personally I like this film better than Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth, which was great in itself, but whatever floats your boat.  You either like something or you don't.  It was because this film was so different from all the other adaptations that I enjoyed it immensely.  It took a chance, gave Austen a slightly different flavour.  In my eyes, it suceeded.

B00003CXFG|5.0|The best reason to watch this movie (she plays Shazza)!  Very talented Aussie actress who is now one of the co-stars in the SciFi Channel's awsome scifi series Farscape.  The movie was actually very good and very creepy.  I still can't watch this all the way through by myself!  Highly recommended if for no other reason than to see Claudia Black!
B00003CX5P|4.0|I'm a big star wars fan and I have to say I was a little disappointed with the film when it first came out in the movies. I don't think its as bad as a lot people said it was, its an okay movie but it is the worst one out of the star wars series. The story is kinda weak and some scenes just didn't fit or make sense in the movie. But as far as the DVD is concern, if you have a surround sound system in your house, this is a must buy DVD. The sound in this film is simply amazing, this is the best DVD to show-off that system. The special features are also great with a lot of behind the scenes, documentary, and deleted scenes stuff. Also the pod race is the best part of the movie and you get a longer version in this DVD. That by itself might be worth.
B000000LZV|5.0|Along with X's \\"Under the Big Black Sun\\" & \\"More Fun In The New World\\", The Minutemen's \\"DNOTD\\" ranks as one of my favorite \\"punk\\" records. People confuse the term \\"punk\\" with loud and fast music, but it's the attitude, man! The Minutemen had enough of it to make the music they liked and sing about things they found interesting or important without regard for its commercial viability. It's great stuff. And who would have guessed that a big guy like the late D. Boone would have so much rhythm?

0061020710|4.0|This is a great little book. The first thing you need to understand about it, is that it's not just about telling one story, but rather introduce you to a whole new fantastic world (Discworld).<br />Pratchett wastes no time in introducing the two main characters, Rincewind the wizard (kind of) and Twoflower the tourist (you'll understand when you read the book). Both are quite unique characters, clumsy enough to get themselves into all sorts of troubles, but lucky enough to get out of them (most of the time, anyqays). Pratchett's writing will force your brain to start imagining what they look like, how they move, how they sound. Furthermore, their companions throughout their adventures are also loads of fun (like the iconograph and the luggage...you'll see...).<br />Not only is this a great fantasy adventure, but it's a story that leaves enough questions open and presents enough characters so that you'll want to know more about, and you'll inevitably have to read the following books.<br />My recommendation is that you should not only get The Color of Magic, but also The Light Fantastic and read them back-to-back.
B0000025GW|5.0|I may be a bit pushy in suggesting that people ought to be listening to an album that came out so many years ago, and this album relies so heavily on religious devotion that it might be goofy for me to keep bringing up Bob Dylan in this context, anyway, but I used to try to come up with excuses to sing the songs on this album during church services, and the final song, &quot;When He Returns,&quot; was usually the one which made the most sense.  With religion and terrorism becoming so closely linked in the popular imagination (as a few philosophers have been playing around with this link for centuries), this is a strange time for me to announce that I like the amount of thought which went into these songs, and I want to suggest that, as anyone ought to appreciate from the songs of Bob Dylan, occasionally, there is a lot more to be learned from this album than how to have a great time religiously.  The opening song, &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody,&quot; suggests that humility might be better than exaltation, even for a young Turk or the &quot;head of some big TV network.&quot;  Verse three runs from those people who are trying to straighten out the world by being &quot;a state trooper&quot; to &quot;You may be living in another country under another name.&quot;  This is probably the song which most people who listened to the radio in 1979 would remember as being Bob Dylan's religious hit record, and it has a shotgun style of blasting away at everything that he could think of to show that there is no way to escape our comically devastating opinions of who people really are on a personal level, like, &quot;You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy.&quot;  Even after that outbreak of humor in verse seven, he has to go back to his chorus about &quot;it may be the devil or it may be the Lord, But you're gonna have to serve somebody.&quot;  He didn't think of very many women when he was writing that song, just &quot;a socialite with a long string of perals&quot; in verse one, and &quot;somebody's mistress&quot; in verse five, maybe to see if anyone was still paying attention.  The next song, &quot;Precious Angel&quot; puts his ideas about women into a philosophical &quot;spiritual warfare and flesh and blood breaking down.  Ya either got faith or ya got unbelief, and their ain't no neutral ground.&quot;  This wasn't the kind of thing that people in my church wanted to hear sung on a Sunday morning, but the next song, &quot;I Believe in You,&quot; seemed perfect, except that for Bob, perfection is so personal that he was singing, &quot;Keep me set apart from all the plans they do pursue.  And I, I don't mind the pain, don't mind the driving rain.  I know I will sustain, 'cause I believe in you.&quot;  Musically, &quot;I Believe in You&quot; and &quot;When He Returns&quot; are the two songs that I really like to hear on this album.  On &quot;Slow Train,&quot; he is singing, &quot;Boy, without a doubt, have to quit your mess and straighten out.&quot;  This is not a happy song.  I have a book of music, and every verse of that song has minor chords except for the one measure in which he sings, &quot;slow, slow train.&quot;  Verse 4 in the book is the instrumental, so people who just listen might not think that the line, &quot;to see my loved ones turning into puppets&quot; is in verse eight, it really only seems like seven, which is long enough.<br />The titles of the songs, &quot;Gonna Change My Way of Thinking,&quot; &quot;Do Right to Me Baby (Do Unto Others),&quot; and &quot;When You Gonna Wake Up&quot; suggest some intellectual concerns that religion and philosophy might have in common if people ever agreed with each other.  I like the ending of the next song, &quot;Man Gave Names to All the Animals&quot; for being so open in not actually naming what might be &quot;slithering his way through the grass&quot; and would rhyme with lake, if anyone dares to draw the obvious conclusion to the poetry of that song.  The final song, &quot;When He Returns,&quot; gives some form to the concept, &quot;a mighty God.&quot;  I think everybody ought to buy this album just so they have the opportunity to listen to the end of verse two, &quot;Will I ever learn That there'll be no peace, that the war won't cease Until He returns?&quot;
B000002H97|2.0|There are a few good songs here, but this in no way has the strength of previous Metallica efforts.  All of the songs are simple.  A person who picked up the guitar for the first time could figure most of them out.  I don't really understand how a person could compare the complexity of their previous hit, &quot;One&quot;, to the simplicity of &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;.  This is an album from the Metallica that sued it's fans.  That's right.  The band that got famous because of a tape trading network in the 80's and let its fans record the shows on the Justice tour, is now the band that sues it's fans for using napster.  What is a sell out again?<br />I don't believe in calling bands sell outs, except in certain cases.  Such as when they admit it.  I would call Metallica one of the only sell out bands that I know of.  On this CD, they said (and this is a direct quote from Spin 7/90) that they wanted to get Bob Rock (previously Bon Jovi's producer) to help them get a sound that would be more marketable to a general audience so they could sell more albums.  Putting the dollar sign above the art is the dictionary definition of selling out.<br />This is the black album.  The black represents the death of the Metallica with artistic integrity (and intensity), and the beginning of the bubble gum pop music that you can hear on the radio and on TV commercials.  Most of these songs are very simple inanity, that I suppose achieves what Metallica wanted.  The masses could understand it.  Go back to Justice, Garage Days, Puppets, Lightning, and most especially Kill 'em All if you want to hear what Metallica WAS all about (the answer is in those days, they were about music).
B00005N9CV|5.0|S'Wonderful is worth the price of the album alone.  If you listen to this song with your heart, and think of a loved one, it will bring tears to your eyes.  She brings out emotion in a listener like no other singer. Listen to her inflections, her phrasing, her range, and once you do, you will buy all of her albums as I am doing.  She is an incredible jazz pianist also, as you will discover on her earlier albums. Just bought 2 Krall Albums and I am heading to Grand Canyon tonight with my wife. Will listen to them both all the way.  Will probably pull over and smooch a little, Diana brings out the love in your heart!  Diana, you are Awesome!

B00005ASOI|5.0|I've rented the old vhs copy of this movie several times before.. it's one of my favorite horror films.  The music, the atmosphere, everything.  But, if you're even curious about this dvd, then chances are, i don't have to sell you on the film itself.  How does the dvd look and sound?  Its almost like watching a completely different movie from the one that i've rented.   The transfer is near perfect.  With the masterful composition of the images in this film and the vivid colors used, you owe it to yourself to see this disc.  The film shouldn't be seen any other way, unless you find it playing on the big screen.. but even then, i doubt you'll get a better looking image than this.<BR>The ingenious score, by Goblin (who does the music for many of Argento's films), has been beautifully remastered.  The mix itself is incredible.  i guess i can't quit saying good things about this disc.  just buy it.  i promise you won't be disappointed.
B000003N7K|5.0|If you've spent a bundle on a sound system and you sometimes wonder if it was worth it, buy this disc.  The clarity of the sound is inspiring. Hartman's voice and Coltrane's sax are at their peaks here and the recording brings that through in a way that makes it hard to accept that this is a 38 year old recording.  But it is more than that -- their is a synergy between the two key performers that is just staggering. Hartman's voice and Coltrane's sax pass the song back and forth effortlessly and seamlessly. The combination provides a totally unique experience and the song selection is magical.  <BR>This is not just a great recording -- it is a very special work of art.
B000007T2Z|5.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor have unwittingly become torchbearers for the anti-globalisation movement which has created a groundswell of opposition to the way that Western culture is crushing individualism, community and art in recent years. The Canadian collective are the antithesis of the slick, corporate-controlled, mass-produced muzak that dominates the charts. Notoriously antagonistic toward the conventions of the music industry, they are virtual media recluses, who choose not to market the music they make, but rather let word of mouth spread the gospel. And the gospel is awe inspiring. <br />Armed with guitars, violins, cellos, bass and drums, Godspeed's sound builds from fragile and tremulous beginnings to a full on white noise assault. Epic and orchestral in structure and scale, this record seems to soundtrack the dark days leading up to armageddon, emotions on a knife edge, despair laced with hope. The sewers are all muddied with a thousand lonely suicides, and the flags are dead at the top of their poles.  But what beauty can be created from such feelings is what Godspeed are all about, and is what makes this record so bleakly exhilirating. Frightening.
B000002OHF|5.0|Anyone who is a TRUE student of maturation with bands KNOW that this LP highlights the maturity of Wishbone Ash.  This LP is not a regression as some would have you believe.  In fact, Wishbone Ash did not begin to show tiredness until many albums later.  Fans of WBA know which albums these are.  WB4 has 8 tunes that showcase the studio wizardry they have begun to polish by this time.  If you listen to LP 1 up to this one it is highly noticeable.  The singing, songwriting, instrumentation and overall quality of recording improved megafold.  This album, with the wonderfully crafted tunes, all of which stand out, is a great album.  It is true that WBA was undermarketed by MCA who should have busted wide open, being superior to many of the noted bands of this time era.  Highly recommended.
B00005OB0A|5.0|This album was totally out of leftfield.  Just one year after the olympics; 'light years' tour &amp; album; 'spinning around' etc, who would've thought in a million years that Kylie Minogue would release not only her best album, but one of the best albums in recent years, not just from the pop world.  <BR>Even with 'light years' there was a tendancy to like Miss Minogue for her past kitch value.  But without Kylie going back and accepting her past (via the 'on a night like this tour') we might never have caught the 'fever'; that is this absolutely amazing pop album.<BR>This album has kicked off its dominance with 'can't get you out of my head', but lucky as it were, that really is the tip of the iceberg.  <BR>The album opens with 'More More More', not a stand-out, but a warm-up leading into the amazing 'love at first sight', which may top 'cguoomh' as the biggest single from the album: it will at least burn thorugh the club scenes, as will 'in your eyes' &amp; 'love affair'.<BR>This album is just perfect.  Everything comes together so well.  Every hook pulls you in, whether you wanna dance at 3am ('come into my world') or just chill out ('burning up'), its just great.  I haven't been a real Kylie fan since 1989, except for 1998's 'Intimate &amp; Live' .  'Fever' erases that fact by track 2.<BR>This album really shows how much she and her audience have progressed.<br />stand-out tracks:     'fever'; 'love at first sight'; 'in your eyes';and 'tightrope' (australian only track)

0553274503|5.0|Charlie Gordon's &quot;progris riports&quot; make up the majority of the text in Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon.  In his early thirties, mentally challenged Charlie works at a bakery, cleaning up and running errands.  The only thing that Charlie has ever wanted in life is for people to like him.  He thinks that if he were smart, people would want to be his friend.  Charlie tries hard to learn how to read and write, but it is a long, ongoing process.  Charlie decides to take part in a study conducted by some professors at the school he attends.  The experiment involves Charlie's having an extraordinary brain operation that will help him to become extremely intelligent.  After the operation, Charlie's new IQ helps him to understand how common it is for people to be cruel to others.  Charlie soon realizes that all his life, people have been laughing at him, not with him.  As Charlie becomes smarter, vivid memories of his childhood begin to disturb him.  Unfortunately, after a few months Charlie's intelligence begins to fade and he regresses to a worse mental state than before the experiment.  <BR>This book truthfully portrays how people treat others different from themselves and how unkind we can be to each other.  This book gives us a glimpse of what it feels like to be made fun of and looked down upon by others.   <BR>Unfortunately, this book is on the Banned Book List.  Censors claim that  &quot;explicit love scenes were distasteful.&quot;  It also contains limited profanity and references to drinking.  I believe that these scenes are essential to understanding how Charlie is progressing mentally as well as emotionally.  They also are necessary to help us understand the characters' personalities.  I feel certain that eight graders and above would be able to handle this book.  I would certainly recommend it to adults as well as mature young people.
B00005JKOV|4.0|&quot;Waking Life&quot; was beautiful,philosophical,inspirational and a little surprising. I felt like I was watching a lecture on existensialism, with the speaker being a 7-11 checkout guy who had one too many Slurpees and was using his sugar buzz as an excuse to poetically smother his customers. A mix of artistic innovation and theatrical self-examination, it is a cartoon like journey through our imagination that is definately worth experiencing. Visually, each frame of film was a work of art in and of itself. If our subconscious mind is without boundary, then why can't our conscious lives be without limitation? &quot;Waking Life&quot; seems to ask that very question and by doing so inspires the audience to look within themselves and Wake UP! It is a grand collage of art and personal philosophies that dreams its way towards revelation for every second of 90 minutes. Overall, the only weakness to me was the casting choice of Charles Gunning, the teenage protaganist. He was very meak and uninteresting as a lead character. He reminded me of one of those museum tour guides who is so boring that he is completely ignored up until the moment someone gets lost and needs directions to the gift shop. He was obviously chosen this way intentionally so as not to distract the audience from all the &quot;meaning of life&quot; speeches that were constantly tossed out at us. Nonetheless, groundbreaking and a must-see!
B00005QG9J|4.0|I enjoy Incubus' new album Morning View.  Though, not as good as earlier heavy rock albums such as S.C.I.E.N.C.E or Enjoy Incubus, this album uses more studio effects and orchestra.  The orchestra parts are definitely a plus, giving their songs a new sound.  Their songs are more musically sophisticated, adding more acoustic songs, but still keeping the always rocking, Incubus-sounding songs.  Overall, its a great album, one that will stay in my CD player for a while!

B00005OMTT|4.0|I picked this disc just three days ago. The first 2 tracks are new: A 1 min 4 sec intro track &quot;The Landing&quot; and (continuing to) &quot;Turn Around&quot;. Rest of the 16 tracks are pulled from the past 4 albums and slightly edited on the fronts and ends to create some sort of non-stop continuity.<br />There is also another compliation called The Remix Collection released at the same time with 9 extended tracks. The front album art is the same with a different colour and &quot;The Remix Collection&quot; title. Check out the &quot;Northern Lights Club Mix (135 BPM)&quot; of &quot;Turn Around&quot; on the remix disc. It is a very much better version than the original.<br />Engima fans will surely snap up these two. For the curious and casual, you can't go wrong with The Greatest Hits, featuring the best sounds of Engima.<br />I give 1 star short as &quot;Turn Around&quot; are not better than the old ones and thus is not strong enough to release as the new single.
B00003CXE7|3.0|The cinematography in this film is great, as well as the casting and effects.. yet for some reason it just didn't seem to live up to the hype surrounding it.. So many other movies were better than this, and it's hard to understand why it was considered an Academy Award winner... Technical merits aside.. the story just doesn't live up and isn't worth a second viewing... My husband was excited to purchase this film &amp; once viewed, he was sorely wishing he had spent his money elsewhere.... Save it for a rental night.
B00005R87Q|5.0|R U Fast and Furious?<BR>The Fast and the Furious comes at you like it says. It's not a long movie and really never slows down much at all! Those looking for a movie delving into a complex plot with in depth charachters need not watch it. The movie is as the preview shows, a lot of great car chase scenes held together by a loose form of a plot.<BR>It does what Gone in 60 Seconds only wishes it could do. In Gone In 60..you have 2 scenes with cars driving fast at all. Here, you have at least 6 or 7 distinctly different and memorable scenes. Although acting ability and some of the lines lack severely, this can be forgiven and is made up by the cars.<BR>This movie is perfect for anyone into speed and tuned import sports cars for the most part(yes, even the occasional despicable economy car made to &quot;perform&quot; is present). When I first saw the previews I knew this was going to be basically an adrenaline rush of a movie!  I gave it 5 Amazon stars(when actually a 10!) because that's what it delivered.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is produced by one of the greatest bands ever, Incubus, therefore, it is obvious that they won't sell any crap. This album was, as well as their other albums, written very well. There are a little bit more mellow songs than before, hence the fact that they said &quot;they got their inspiration while recording in a house in Malibu.&quot; All the songs, of course, are put together perfectly and have an awesome story. The lyrics are meaningful and the instrumental skills are displayed as well. If you think that this album is totally different than previous albums and that Incubus may have &quot;sold out&quot;, you're wrong. The boys have once again put out an awesome collection that does not differ that much from &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. Also, the album has the  creativity and original sound of Incubus. The group isn't worn out yet. They have recorded on this album great songs such as a couple of my favorites, &quot;11 AM&quot; and &quot;CIRCLES&quot;. So, don't hesitate, I urge you to buy this album immediately if you love Incubus.
B000000H3Z|5.0|This is a no nonsence, in your face album. Max at his best -growls from the soul ....all you have to do is listen to Stronger than Hate and you'll know what im talking about ...RESPECT
B00004Y7SF|4.0|I think this is a very good Christmas album from Christina Aguilera. I really loved track 10: The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix). No, this is not exactly your parents' Christmas album. That being said I think the work is sincere from Christina and should be given a chance. I like this CD.
0812550706|5.0|I'm not much of a reader, and have stopped reading books for entertainment for years. Thanks to my english teacher I learned about Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game. It is the best book I've read so far, and this book has finally lit a new spark in my intrest for books. I highly recomend this book for anyone who reads, plays videogames, and/or likes SF.
B00003CXS4|4.0|The thing about Snatch that thrilled me the most was the way Guy Ritchie chose to film his scenes. I thought it added a little bit of &quot;hip and exciting&quot; element to this movie. One of my favorite scenes is when they are all dressed as Rabbis and go in and rob the Jewl store, the filming is cool and different. The down to this movie is the fast moving plot. I had to see it twice to get it fully but then I had a &quot;oh ya I get it&quot; type of reaction. <BR>When I ask my friends If they have scene it they say &quot;oh that movie with Brad Pitt ya it was okay.&quot; Brad Pitt (although he is in it) plays a CO starring role. Some of the larger roles are givven to Vinnie Jones and Jason Stathem. Despite the fastness of the plot Snatch is definatly worth a shot at seeing. See it agian if you dont get it. Rated R for lauguge and some violence
B00003CXN4|3.0|Good movie, yes. Best movie, definitely not.<br />I didn't see the movie until it came out on DVD. With all the reviews and excellent ratings, I expected much much much more than what i got. I guess i should have seen at the movies rather than getting it for 25 bucks on DVD... The casting is good but the movie is really slow at times...<br />Rent it, don't buy it.
B00005B36H|5.0|This CD is one of the best i have... tool never seems to stop blowing my mind. Aenima was good but i think i like this one better. The lyrics are so good and the music is enchanting. At any rate. Thats all i have to say.<BR>~Marie
6304308388|5.0|And what a mensch Jack Lemmon is. He gives his best performance in this comdy-drama, that makes you first laugh out loud and then want to cry for these people. The slimy, gritty story plays perfectly off of Lemmon's character, so he seems like the only good guy in a bad bad world. I cant believe he didnt win an Oscar. Also great performances from Shirley MacLaine and Fred McMurray.
0156711427|3.0|A Passage to India vividly demonstrates the psychology of how people avoid those who are different than themselves.  The litmus test of this problem is identified by how even friendly people assume the worst about others, rather than keeping an open mind or assuming the best.<br />The book is less successful at providing a model of how to overcome those weaknesses.  Mrs. Moore, a visiting Englishwoman, in the book successfully establishes a friendship with Dr. Aziz, a Muslim physician in Chandrapore, India.  The connection is deeply embedded in her sincere interest in all other people and their feelings.  She arrives in the book with that empathy, and only one of her sons also seems to have the same fineness of emotional connection.  Another son clearly doesn't.  So, it's a rare trait, even in families.  There is no evidence of how to create that attitude which leads to such rapid and firm trust.<br />More typical is the friendship between Dr. Aziz and Cyril Fielding.  Both are committed to each other, but are quick to suspect each other's motives.  A continuing effort allows them to reconcile.  One has to suppose that their relationship is the model that E.M. Forester had in mind for most of us.  We can connect with others we respect and like, and with hard work can overcome miscommunications and suspicion.<br />Dr. Aziz is portrayed in a very thoughtful way.  He wants to have friends across the cultural divide, and makes enormous efforts in that respect.  However, his intentions often have unintended consequences.  He bears up and moves forward.  I was impressed from this character about the need to have many people who seek friendship in order to make connections possible.<br />The plot builds around the arrival of Mrs. Moore, the mother of a local English magistrate, with Miss Adela Quested, who is considering whether to marry Mrs. Moore's magistrate son.  Like many newcomers to colonial India, they are interested in meeting native people and seeing the local sites.  In attempting to respond to their interests, the various connections take place.  Both are initially appalled by the attitude of those English people who have long lived in India towards the Hindus and Muslims there.<br />The book raises important questions at several levels, such as:<br />(1)  Can people with very different religious beliefs live in peace with one another?<br />(2)  Can colonialism ever be anything other than bad for all involved?<br />(3)  How should one adapt to the local community in which one lives, if it is different from one's own background?<br />(4)  What should people be willing to do to help one another?<br />(5)  What should people not do to help one another?<br />(6)  How can mistrust be dispelled?<br />(7)  How does racism harm the person who is a racist?<br />A  major drawback of the book is that many of the characters are usually unappealing.  Even Mrs. Moore, who serves as the ideal in many ways, retreats into self-centered inaction as her health fails.  Miss Quested repays Dr. Aziz's hospitality with putting his life and finances in great peril.  Cyril Fielding seems to often do too little to bridge the cultural gaps.  Dr. Aziz often comes across as a toady.  The other English people have severe drawbacks.  The characters are often surmounted by their agendas.<br />One aspect of the book that I liked was the way it showed how those accused of crimes bring out the fundamental social flaws of the community.  This happens in fiction in Gone with the Wind in the sequence where Scarlett has some problems driving her carriage, and her complaints lead the white men to attack the African-Americans who live in the area where her problem occurred.  In France, the trial of the Jewish Captain Dreyfus created a similar split in the community and rise in racist feelings and actions.<br />The story also seems a little dated, so that the characters seem too extreme to us today to be credible.  They more often seem to be caricatures than characters.<br />After you read this story, think about whom you ignore.  Why do you do that?  What effect does it have on those you ignore?  What effect does it have on you?  What should you do?<br />Seek friendship and mutual understanding among all those you meet!es than characters.  <br />After you read this story, think about whom you ignore.  Why do you do that?  What effect does it have on those you ignore?  What effect does it have on you?  What should you do?<br />Seek friendship and mutual understanding among all those you meet!<br />
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I live outside the u.s., and, for some magical reason, I was abble to get my hands on the dvd last saturday, and I have to say, this is the best dvd in my 122 dvd collection, and is a must for any dvd lover. The dvd comes with plenty of extra material, includes also some of the best menues I have ever seen, better than the ones from &quot;The Phamton Menace&quot; or any other.<br />Well, the movie itself is awesome. The picture is great, and the sound even better.<br />But I have to say, the Shrek in the swamp karaoke party is the best part of the dvd. Seeing Donkey sing a cover of Sir Mix A Lot &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; or the wolf singing &quot;Who Let The Dogs Out&quot;, is the best part of the dvd.<br />Well, what else can I say?...Great movie, great dvd...some great things, like some out takes, showing some problems the crew had with donkey (a very hairy donkey appears, and a walking dress), I can only say...BUY THIS!
B000059MEK|1.0|Completely devoid of anything &quot;new&quot;. Vocoders are strewnthroughout the album as if nobody had ever used one before. It reminded me of the feeling I got when I listened to Fatboy Slim's second album: &quot;These songs are the same thing but more commercial. Why did I ever like these guys in the first place?&quot; The big difference is that &quot;Discovery&quot; doesn't even have the benefit of being catchy. Daft Punk was always sort of a guilty pleasure for me anyway (or maybe I'm just trying to convince myself of that now.) It's so dull I can barely writeabout it without repeating myself. And &quot;One More Time&quot; isn't even the most cyclical song on the album.<br />One listen is enough to make one long for the endless, repetitious monotony of pro basketball. The only songs at which you might bother perking up your ears sound like Air, and a bad version at that. I can only picture this album being enjoyed by people who still consider Moby &quot;relevant&quot; and played in clubs I would never bother going into. I don't mind music reminding me about the repetitious monotony that is life, but I rarely feel like experiencing it over and over and over.
B00000DC4A|5.0|This is definately a step up from his &quot;18 till I die&quot; album. Although I do like that album, this is much better. He still rocks as good and as hard as ever as ever, still has it and always will! This is Bryan Adams at his best .. great songs with a good mix of rockers and ballads. Mel C joins him on &quot;When you're gone&quot; which got a lot of airplay. The 16 page booklet contains all lyrics and a lot of photos. A must have for all fans.
B000001FN3|5.0|...you should hear what you're missing.  Having heard only the few &quot;radio friendly&quot; hits from the Alan Parsons Project over the years it was with both delight and amazement that I first listened to this wonderful recording.  I picked it up on a whim because of the Edgar Alan Poe theme and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The &quot;first side&quot; (having owned it on tape) is more enjoyable for me than the second (starting with &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;) in part because I find the long instrumental piece very inconsistent, but even that is great on a long drive or a rainy day.  Please PLEASE think twice and give this wonderful CD a listen-to, ESPECIALLY if you think of APP as an eighties &quot;2 hit wonder&quot; as I think you will be both pleasantly surprised and pleased.
0140288503|4.0|Very well written book with excruciating battle detail. As I <BR>was reading the book, I felt as confused as the soldiers in <BR>the battle. It was very hard for me to follow the timeline,the<BR>locations of the battle, and the large number of soldiers <BR>written about. I agree that there shouid have been more maps -<BR>maybe even one with each chapter showing the movement of the <BR>battle. I feel the biggest shortcoming of the book is the <BR>author never sets the stage for the battle - as far as why the<br />U.S. was even there and why it was so important to capture this<BR>warlord. You are pretty much jumped into the battle in the first<BR>chapter and the battle is never put into the larger context of<BR>what was happening in Somalia at the time. I am a pretty avid<BR>newswatcher and I was somewhat unclear as to the entire background of the situation. He should have put the battle into<BR>a larger context and maybe given more history on the country of<BR>Somalia. I know the story is about this battle, but more <BR>background would have made the read much more enjoyable. I must<BR>say that by the end of the book, I felt like I had battle fatigue. Maybe that was the point of the book.
B00003CXAA|5.0|We all know that the first two films are the real masterpieces. But what really surprised me when I watched Part III recently is how good it really is. Sure, it isn't in the same level as its predecessors, but I cannot agree with the people who have panned this movie as terrible. The one big flaw in the movie is the casting of Sophia Coppola as Al pacino's daughter. Her gawkiness on screen makes her love affair with Andy Garcia totally unconvincing; one cannot believe Andy actually sheds tears at the break-up; and when she dies at the end, so emotionally disconnected is the viewer from this character that we wonder what the parents are howling about at the opera-house steps. The rest of the movie, however, is very good indeed and fully deserves its Oscar nomination. The script is well-written; Micheal's character is made more subtle and more tragic; there is great emotional resonance between Micheal and Kay, and between Micheal and Vincent; the veteran actors all give fine performances; and the drawn-out finale is superb. Overall, the movie engages you from start to finish and, though certainly not a masterpiece, is nonetheless a fitting conclusion to this grand American tragedy. So go ahead, buy this collection, and enjoy all three movies again and again.
0375751513|4.0|a good story. but what impressed me most was wilde's razor-sharp wit and insight. he gives his opinions on everything from love to art and was his  sharp tongue that brought on his downfall.i think it's more important to be  intelligent than goodlooking, however...
B000025RAU|3.0|Yes, I'm a Pepper too! That's why I'm so impressed with this movie.  All the critics raved about it, especially Rex Reed, so it must be brilliant.  Don't bother me with questions about why all that water was being dumped into the ocean; or how a thirty-eight snubby could even reach let alone hit someone at fifty yards. I'm an *intellectual* and have no patience with such pedestrian quibbles.  Faye Dunaway is one of the greatest overactresses of all time; and Jack Nicholson is superlatively redundant as the noirish, hard-boiled, sharp-edged, gimlet-eyed gumshoe Jake Gittes. Of course, no discussion of this stupendous movie would be complete without genuflecting before His Worship, The Roman Polanski, who, in a career move worthy of awe, managed to stay on topic even in his private life.  The challenge in being an *intellectual* is to see what isn't there.  In Chinatown there is a great deal of it.
B00005NVDI|2.0|Actors from the then recently cancelled Batman TV series turn up in Volume 35 of Paramount's complete reissue of Classic Trek.<br />Lee Meriwether (one of three actresses to portray Catwoman) appears, and disappears, in a severely underwritten guest role in That Which Survives.  Poor pacing, weak dialogue, and out of character behavior by the crew all but ruin an interesting premise.  Spock, in particular, acts rather snippishly throughout the episode, being downright rude to Scott, McCoy, and Chekov.  Leonard Nimoy was so distressed by some of his dialogue he sent third season producer Fred Frieberger a lengthy memo in protest.  It was of no use, as Frieberger had little grasp of what made the first two seasons' best stories so noteworthy.<br />Let that Be Your Last Battlefield is a very obvious allegory on America's black/white conflict.  Too obvious, really.  As with Patterns of Force, the  parallels are so upfront that the story loses its effectiveness.  Star Trek's social conscience worked best when The Message was integrated into an entertaining story (as in The Undiscovered Country) rather than being shoved down the viewers' throats.  The ridiculous overacting by guest stars Lou Antonio and Frank (The Riddler) Gorshin makes William Shatner's performances look like paragons of subtlety.<br />As with most of the rest of this series, picture and sound are fine.
B00000HZTB|4.0|If this is an introductory journey into the world of Lou Reed, then you might want to stop and back up. I recommend that you delve into the Velvet Underground first. The Velvet Underground is where Lou Reed started and is arguably one of the most important bands in the history of rock n' roll. So, if you don't know VU then begin there.<br />If you've already been listening to the Velvet Underground and you want to get into some of Lou's solos stuff then start with the album Transformer. Transformer is Reed's first solo album and he's in his gender bending, punk, glam rocker phase. Great stuff.<br />The Blue Mask came out around a decade later and is a more mature work. It moves away from New York observations of drug culture and the party scene and has a more &quot;grown up&quot; average guy perspective with honest and intelligent lyrics. It also marks a return to Reed on the electric guitar and a basic band set up of two guitars, a bass and drums. The musicianship is superb. A sonic symphony to go along with Reed's unique vocals.<br />The Blue Mask is one of Lou Reed's best solo albums. It has a feel that makes it a great CD when you're driving late night in the city, or hanging out in a New York bar that is trying to decide if it's a dive or if it's just seedy. <br />Lester Bangs would've been happy.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus had an infectious sound from their freshman release, &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, a strong-willed debut that had its own share of great musical and writing talent.  &quot;Morning View&quot; falls nothing short of that tradition and even steps a step beyond what their first album did.  Much harder than &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, &quot;Morning&quot; gives us a newer Incubus. This time around, Incubus combines their unique sound with more traditional sounds: a little Beach Boys here, a little DJ work there, with a few electronica sounds thrown in for entertainment.<br />Truly and completely unlike anything so far released in 2001, &quot;Morning&quot; opens with &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;, an interesting and intriguing track that mixes a strange combination of electric guitar and synthetic sounds -- fully growing into an incredible sounding set of words.  &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; is a beautifully written and orchestrated cut from the record, showing the band's ability to get a song &quot;stuck in your head&quot;.<br />Other strong tracks include the slower, romantic &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, which remains one of the most emotional tracks on the entire album.  Its lyric is utterly amazing and incredibly composed.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot;, on the other hand, does have the title of being the most unique cut on the album, combining strange sounds with Incubus' traditional rock sound.<br />Overall, &quot;Morning View&quot; offers a step up for Incubus, showing their growth and expansion in the short span of time since their debut.  They're giving us, once more, a unique sound that is wonderfully executed.  <br />Overall Grade: B+
B00005NVDF|5.0|Simply put, Woody Allen hit his stride in this 1972 comic classic. The scenes of Allen getting coaching from Boggy, as he makes feeble attempts to win over Keaton are priceless. &quot;Tell her she moves something deep down inside of you&quot;....&quot;I can't say that&quot;...&quot;Tell her!!!&quot; <br />Brilliantly directed by Herbert Ross, (not Allen, as most believe) this is not only the most consistant of Allen's early films, it is far and away his funniest. What's best about owning this DVD is you can &quot;play it again&quot; over and over...Enjoy!
B00000IPAX|3.0|Blink 182 had a faithful following before they ever became what they have become.  Their previous releases, especially that of &quot;Dude Ranch&quot;, offer a stronger, more unique Blink that isn't found in their current releases.  &quot;Enema of the State&quot; proves this, showing us that while, yes, Blink can be funny... Their songs are just sounding the same.<br />Overplayed and overrated, &quot;Enema&quot; DOES have catchy tunes that are great to listen to.  &quot;All The Small Things&quot;, with its catchy music and simple words prove this.  However, it seems that, all in all, the tracks relatively blend into each other.  The same guitar riffs with the same style of singing doesn't create enough diversity to provide for music listening -- just entertainment.<br />&quot;Adam's Song&quot;, however, is the strongest and best part of the album, actually prooving somewhat that Blink does have some writing talent (and can be serious every now and then).  The music is, as well, separate from that of the rest of the album and offers a different pace that is relaxing.<br />&quot;Enema of the State&quot; is a memory album; it brings back those good times when you and your friends were listening to it back in high school or college.  However, the long-term ability of the album is weak and remains a repetitious album that needs more diversity.<br />Overall Grade: C
1587990717|2.0|This book contains a number of brilliant observations that can be quite thought provoking and that are definitely applicable to other areas. In addition, his rendition of the blow-up of a trading desk he observed personally is both colorful and, in all likelihood, accurate. However, it takes a Herculean effort to get to these nuggets of gold (most of which can be found in his first book anyway) - his oversized ego and need to validate his theory and himself personally get in the way.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette came out into the U.S. mainstream all the way back in 1995 with a breakthrough album that would shock the nation: &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;.  The strangely titled record became the best-selling female album of all time, selling an amazing 17 million copies.  No one could possibly achieve that milestone without having an incredible backing.  That backing was this album.<br />Filled with amazing rock riffs interwined with philosophical and honest lyrics, Alanis made an album that is still unprecedented.  The brutal honesty and bluntness of tracks like the classic &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; and &quot;Right Through You&quot; show the way that Alanis can view her own life through her music; a perfect, melodic interwine of reality and rock stardom.  <br />&quot;Hand In My Pocket&quot;, &quot;You Learn&quot; and the mysterious ending track at the extreme end of the album prove that her wailing vocal cords can strike an incredible sense of wonder as you listen.  &quot;Perfect&quot;, a sadly composed story of children whose parents deem them not &quot;perfect enough&quot;, is a treasure that should be listened to carefully and intently.<br />Overall, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is a jewel of a record, creating the uniqueness that set the tone for female rock stars and still entertains listeners to this day.  Truly recommended for anyone who enjoys amazing music that combine with incredible lyrics.<br />Overall grade: A
0783235607|5.0|I've recently been on a bit of Hitchcock binge and I felt compelled to write a review.  Psycho is not your ordinary Hitchcock movie.  The formula is diffrent, forget the leading man and leading lady set up because their is not one.  Most of his classics like Vertigo, North By Northwest, Notorious, and Rear Window have this set up.  Change is good though as this movie is a classic.  It's not only inspired countless slasher movies, but it is also stands great on it's own.<BR>I don't really like Janet Leigh very much, but Anthony Perkins plays the part of Norman to perfection.  I think only De Niro played a disturbed character better in Taxi Driver.  The way he builds suspense is great.  We get the McGruffin in the form of the police officer, who ends up being nothing.  We then hit Norman and his creepy Odepius complex.  If you have never seen or heard about Psycho before then you may believe this is another McGruffin.  But the tension builds and you know this is for real.  The twist is excellent.  Better than Who is Kaiser Soze, Rosebud, or I see dead people.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good thriller, and who doesn't?
0743216458|5.0|This book opened my eyes to WWII.  This was not what I learned in 8th grade.  This book takes you through the war with real men that you can connect with.  These men take you step by step with their feelings.  I loved the book and recommend it for everyone.
0679879269|5.0|I see that most of the 1 star reviews are because people have problems with Pullman's anti-God ideas.  And, I am guessing, by a certain event that happens to God.  I would like to share with all of you exactly what God is involved here.  Pullman didn't commit this act upon 'God' - he did it upon the Authority, and Pullman once talked about people in African/Asian countries who beat people and say it is 'God's' will, and he takes them at their word and in response says that 'God' deserves what happens to him in this book.  He didn't do this to God as Christians know him, but the essence of God, which makes misguided people believe that 'God' wants them to punish people for their 'sins'. <BR>He didn't act upon God, just the part of him that is kept alive by religious-maniacs' beliefs. <br />I hope this clears problems up.  Please remember that the Church in these books is NOT the Roman Catholic Church as you all know it.<br />Read this book, but remember what is REALLY happening. (Oh, I AM a Christian, and this book's content did not bother me in the least.)

0345448898|5.0|John Forstbauer<BR>10/25/01<BR>English 9<BR>Ms. Feild<br />  Title: The Golden Compass<BR>  Author: By Philip Pullmam<br />     The Golden Compass is a page turning science fiction book.  It just kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I personally don't enjoy reading a lot but this book actually made me want to read longer and longer.<BR>     The book is about a little girl called Lyra who is about twelve years old.  She lives at a collage called Jorden Collage with a lot of scholes.  Then one night at the collage Lyra overheard a statement that would change her life forever.  The talk was about an extradinary element, microscopic in size.  Lyra heard that this partical called dust could unite whole universes, but it was only found in the vast parts of the northern artic.  But some people were scared of dust and wanted to detroy it.<BR>     Lyra realised her destiny was to find the dust.  When the Lord of the collage was arrested, he gave a golden compass to Lyra that was called a antiemeter.  This compass possessed the power to answer any question that you asked it.  It does this by pointing to three different pictures or symbols with three different hands.  Only a few people knew how to read the compass so Lyra struggled to teach herself how to understand it.  When Lyra set off for the north she was helped by Gyptions, which were people, Withes and giant armored bears, which were polar bears with special armor and great strength.  Lyra was forced to fight many battles against an evil person called Ms. Coutler, who wants to take all of the dust for herself and use it to create a new universe.<BR>     The author also used some literary terms such as foreshadowing.  He used this element when he said,&quot;Isoric will become king of the bears again.&quot; That was foreshadowing because Isoric did become king of the armored bears later on when he killed the new king to gain the thrown. <BR>     The whole time Lyra hadn't the faintest clue that she alone was destined to win or lose a battle that would change the universe forever.<BR>     My personal opinion of this book is that it was an excellent book and that it was very exiting.  I gave it two thumbs up.  If you are looking for a great science fiction book, this is the one to read.  I would have to say it is one of my favorite books ever.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I go to the movies about twice a week, half of them independent films, and this is the best movie I have seen in the past year. I saw this movie three times in the theatre, and was excited to buy a copy for home.<br />I almost hesitate to write a review of Memento, because part of the beauty of this movie is watching the plot slowly unfold in interesting and unexpected ways, so beware: do not read too many reviews, as they will spoil this wonderful element of the movie! <br />Without giving too much away, the movie is about a man with a condition known as 'anterograde amnesia.' This is a bona-fide neuopsychological disorder in which the victim cannot form *new* memories after becoming afflicted.  They can remember everything from before their injury, but after the injury they forget things five minutes after they happen.  This movie tackles many interesting philosophical questions about the construction of the self, memories, and the world using anterograde amnesia as a vehicle. If you liked The Matrix, you will *love* Memento.<br />If you get off on movies that make you think, movies that leave puzzles hanging in mid-air only to be taken up again much later in the movie, this is for you. If you like a movie that forces you to think about philosophical issues, this movie is also for you. If you want a lighter movie that is not intellectually demanding (as we all do now and then), then I'd hold off on Memento, but only for a little while!

0061040967|5.0|Over the past two years, I've managed to collect every volume of the Discworld Series and a number of books that Terry Pratchett has worked on.<br />Why?<br />Terry Pratchett has produced an array of books that have consistently floored me with their thoughtful insights, hilarious situations, and wonderful characters.<br />All that I have lacked has been a vision.<br />Thanks to Paul Kidby, I now have it.  The illustrations for this story are wonderful.  And the story is fantastic.<br />The book involves a large number of characters from Terry's world, so it might not be the best starting point for novices.  But man, is it pretty.  Well worth the price for fans of the series.
0812550706|4.0|I'm not even finished with the book yet, (within a hundred pages of the end), and I'll say that it is one of the best page-turners I've ever read, but, it is not perfect.  For one, Ender is just a bit too perfect at the mock battles in Battle School, about the only thing they never required him to do was walk on water, which wouldn't surprise me if Card actually made him do it.  Also, there is a bit too much nudity for my taste.  People walkin' round w/ out a stitch on is one thing, but this is kids we're talkin about!  A fight in a shower room?!  It makes you think things about Orson Scott Card.
0345413377|3.0|The blast of The Golden Compass, the weave of The Subtle Knife, both wonderful books, were truely the only things keeping me hooked to The Amber Spyglass. Although interesting, and at times touching, the ending was a dissapointment. The book somehow, held no edge for me. The theology and the adventure at times seemed akward, badly joind together. Characters that could have been amplified, explained and enriched were ignored and shelfed. Will's daemon was simply there, nothing else. I, personally, had been waiting for a character, all we got was a cat with a voice. The book leaves you hanging a bit, but not wanting to continue. My advice is read it, then make up your own ending.
B00000HYXB|4.0|I've been a Blind Guardian fan since the day I stumbled upon a Flash video for a whimsical song titled simply &quot;The Bard's Song,&quot; and afterwards I downloaded a total of almost 50 (or more, I keep losing count ;P) songs over a couple years. There are very few of these songs that I can honestly say i don't like, so I took the time to search for the band's CDs, but, sadly, my humble little state just doesn't have them. So, I turned to Amazon.com, and to my surprise, there it was: Nightfall in Middle-Earth! <br />This Cd is absolutely incredible. Most of the songs are pure gold, and all the rest are even better. Some of the best examples of BG's genius include &quot;Time Stands Still (at the Iron Hill)&quot; and &quot;When Sorrow Sang.&quot; These songs (and more) struck me as simply incredible. I bought this CD as soon as I heard the samples, and I was not disappointed. After this, I bought Somewhere Far Beyond (very good as well, but this one is better in terms of lyrics and melodies) and I am planning to buy every CD Blind Guardian has released. I highly recommend this CD to any newbie Blind Guardian fan--you won't regret it!
B000056K04|4.0|I only possess Dave's live albums before I purchased this one and it did take me for a loop on how different it was. Although I really like this cd, it just seemed like it left me hangin' for more. No jammin', minimal Boyd and Leroi, less rawness(which was a good thing to have) and too much Ballard influence. It just seems too overproduced, especially for a band that thrives when performing live. But, for a studio album with all NEW songs, I was more than satisfied with the cd. Some of my favorite songs are When The World Ends, Dreams of Our Fathers, So Right, Fool to Think, Sleep To Dream Her, and Everyday. I, however, would've prefered the Lillywhite session songs over these. If you are a true DMB fan, get the album. Obviously its not the best, but its still Dave and we all should still support him.
0061040967|4.0|(...) First, let me say what I do not like about the book. It is a coffee table sized book, with too many illustrations. It is too expensive (though I paid about half list with coupon). Some of the illustrations are really great, some are very funny, really, the only problem is that there are way too many, sometimes two pages. I did not realize this when I purchased the book. I thought it was like previous ones, just shorter. The size of the book makes it awkward to take places.....With that said, the writing style is pure Pratchett, very funny in places. It is not the best of the series, but perhaps in the top ten. I am almost finished with the book, and it actually is getting better as I go. I was not too happy with it at first, but there are at least 5 different times when I burst out laughing, and then re-read the paragraph and started laughing again. The characters are all old favorites, I just wish the story line did not jump around quite so much. For the price, the book deserves 3 stars. For the literary content a 5. The art work is great, but too much. So over all, I think a 4 is fair. If you are a die hard fan like me, you have to buy the book now. You can't wait. I know. I needed my fix right away. If you are not a die hard fan, I would suggest you wait until this ends up in the bargain bin/discount rack. At half the list price, I am happy. Anywhere close to list and I would have felt cheated. (Of course, this may be more personal than anything else). In any case, if you are reading this, you have already pretty much decided to buy the book, and are already one of the poor, addicted fools, like me. So, buy the book already and enjoy! ;-)
0790731983|3.0|This film is possibly the best musical i have seen. The film is almost the antithesis of the pathetic no-brainer musicals of the 1950s and60s. This was not a choice viewing, but one for a uni course so i didn't watch it because i wanted to!!  But I was surprised at the quality of the actors involved and the overall directing of the film. All of the issues dealt with were done with sensitivity, such as the homosexuality, the Nazi opposition to the Jewish population and the identity changing of some people to hide their family and past. The direction of the film by Fosse is brilliant and the work done on interweaving the Nazi uprising with the Caberet performances done by Sally Bowles and the MC are superb. If I were to pick out a scene that captivated me it would have to be when the young boy is singing and it scrolls down to reveal the Nazi uniform... chilling. I now understand why this movie is a cult.
B00005OM5L|4.0|A good and solid performance by arguably the best white blues guitarist of his generation.  Set is opened by an accoustic rendition of Layla - allways bound to be a crowd pleaser.  The set from here on however is entirely electric with some classics from the past (e.g. badge, white room) and some material from his most successfull solo album, from the cradle (e.g. five long years). Unsurprzingly, Eric produces some great guitar solos throughout, the best one in my opinion is on the Bob Marley cover, I shot the sherrif.
B00003CXAR|5.0|I have not gone swimming since the debut of this motion picture. It really scared the hell out of me.
B00005KARK|5.0|DUMBO is a film that I would have liked to have worked on.<br />It has 'heart'. It has great characters, great voices, and is completely unpretentious. This last feature is, sadly, rarely found in animated films today.<br />Are there actually people who consider this film 'unsuitable' for children since it contains scenes of drunkenness? Like the Shakespearian bowdlerizers of earlier times, they miss the point of this movie: a baby is taken from his mother and exploited by a 'bunch of clowns', and called a 'freak' by his fellow elephants<br />DUMBO is a story about self-image and respect.  This is something that is very important for younger children to learn, since they are forming their own self-images and are woefully susceptible to the comments of their peers.<br /><br />Perhaps there are objections to the crows? They are from another time, but are handled with humor and restraint. Take a look at live action films from this period to see how some things were simply 'taken for granted'. Racist sentiment plays a part in this film, but it is directed at Dumbo by his fellow elephants, who consider him 'no longer an elephant' when he ruins a circus act.  Crows, mice, and elephants are all equally horrified to hear that Dumbo has been made a clown--the lowest form of circus life, in their estimation.  Only his mother does not mind.<br />This is another important message for children to learn: that true love doesn't care if you aren't perfect. All of this is stated simply and in less than one hour's time.<br />Get this disc for your children instead of the POKEMON that they may still be asking you for. You will enjoy it as well.<br />My one complaint about this DVD is that they did not identify the artists in photos in the Backstage section. Some of these wonderful people are still around, and some are actually still working. They deserve the credit.
6300214354|4.0|What a film.  In the true tradition of the Airplane movies, and also the Police Squad! television series comes this 'laugh so hard you'll fold yourself in two' movie.  <BR>It's true, every time you watch this film you will spot something new, some background gag that you failed to notice before.  A piece of cinematic genius by the sheer number of gags it fits in to one movie.  <BR>If you are a fan of the Airplane movies or the Naked Gun series this film is a must see.  It should be a definite part of anybody's collection of &quot;What a stupid joke, and yet it's so funny&quot; movies.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|SNOW WHITE is an animation textbook as well as a history of one of the most famous films ever made.<br />It is beautifully produced and gorgeously restored. The colors have never looked better.<br />The Disney studio cleaned out their refrence library for the superb Gallery section, to the immense benefit of animation fans, animators, and animation students alike. It is also instructive to see footage which was cut at the last minute: this truly shows Walt Disney's particular genius, that of the expert storyteller. Which is all that matters when making a film--not just a feature length cartoon.<br />My one complaint (as with all the new Disney discs) is that the artists who made the drawings are never identified except in one or two instances. There are discussions about background painter Sam Armstrong, and one character design of the Prince and Snow White was signed by Fred Moore and Hamilton Luske, but in some cases the artwork has appeared in books with the artist properly credited; and in two instances the artists are actually still alive and working for the Disney company. (Working in animation keeps you young.)<br />Don't miss this one if you love animation, and love the movies.
B0000039QA|5.0|This CD is defintly as bad as all of the CDs brought out after his death. This CD is still true to Biggie's spirit.
B00005JK1C|5.0|(...)Watching the faux plot unfold and realizing that Verbal uses as much truth as lies and misdirection to spin his tale is integral to the film and realizing \\"...its greatness..\\".  The movie works not because of a borrowed \\"whodunnit\\" plot or \\"twist\\" ending but because of the fine scripting, direction and acting that came together to churn out a fantastic product.  <br />(...)Watch this movie to see great performances and excellent direction.  The plot will keep you interested and the subtleties of facial expressions the characters provide will lead you through the truths of the story just as they will allow you to realize where you are being lead astray.  It is a fantastic movie and even those of you who just don't like this sort of film and perhaps enjoy something more simple yet well done and exciting, like Gladiator, I suggest you give this movie a try, you are guaranteed to like it.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I haven't heard this album yet, but I have heard Last Nite which a pretty cool song... this review is more of an outlet for me to express my dislike for music critics and the music industry who every second week annoint another band or person the &quot;Savior of rock and roll&quot; or something like that... it's stupid... for one thing, why are you looking for a savior of rock and roll? Rock isn't dead, it's simply changing... I find it funny how Rolling Stone magazine and other magazines like that can stomp on a genius like Aphex Twin saying that his new album is trash and &quot;irrelevant&quot; and then continue to look for that band that is going &quot;save rock and roll&quot;... in other words, the band that is basically copying music that has been done... and it has been done, and done well in a lot of cases I might add, but it's time to move on... I don't understand why bands who have a 70's look for one thing, but are also compared to groups like The Velvet Underground are praised as being relevent today, when the music they play was relevent long ago... and really, where do critics get off labeling a piece of music as irrelevent anyways? I'm sure it's relevent to some people... I dunno, I don't really pay much attention to professional music critics anymore... I suppose all that matters is whether or not you like music... it's a sad thing that the music industry is the way it is, because they lay so much hype on a band starting out, and they can never live up to the expectations, and a lot probably crumble under the load... and because of that we're missing out on the potential musical gems that their future records might have been... ah well, I think I've rambled on long enough... seeing as how this is a review for the Strokes I will say this, Last Nite is a great song... but I haven't heard anything else...
B00005Q45W|4.0|I suspect if you are reading this review that you like Leonard Cohen and his type of music since he never has had a hit, and when I ask people if they know who he is I get the typical confused look. Since 1968, Cohen has been writing exceptional poetry and setting them to music. &quot;Ten New Song&quot; is his first studio cd since 1992's &quot;The Future&quot;. In general, Cohen does not push the musical envelope more than he has on previous albums, but he does offer up what I think is a soulful sound. If Cohen can actually be soulful with his one note singing style. Yet, he pulls of the r&amp;b nicely here with songs like &quot;In My Secret Life&quot;, &quot;That Don't Make It Junk&quot;, &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; and &quot;Boogie Street&quot;. All ten songs are very well written, especially if you compare them to, say, Aerosmith's latest. The kind of music Cohen creates isn't for everyone, but what he makes he makes well. A good solid album, &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; should last us another 10 years until his next album!!
B00005A8MA|5.0|This is a first rate collaborative album by Mayall and former associates and his current band at the time of the original recording in 1971. I'm not certain that the tracks that have been partially re-recorded add significantly to the overall standard. <BR>It remains a mellow album, which spans many blues styles, and even touches on elements of softer jazz-rock, which Mayall had been experimenting with at the time.<br />It contains some excellent all-round work by Clapton, (my personal favourite is &quot;Prisons on the Road&quot;) fresh from recording Layla around this time, Mick Taylor's best slow blues solo ever, on &quot;Marriage Madness&quot; some superb blues sax work by Johnny Almond on &quot;Television Eye&quot;,  blues violin by Sugarcane Harris, a somewhat obscure figure today.<BR>Mayall certainly believes in expressing his forthright opinions, and at times some of the lyrics are a little too preachy, but that's a minor quibble. Then as now his vocals which often sound weak on record, strangely are much stronger in live performance.<br />Enjoy!
6300213749|4.0|When i look back at the films of the 1980's &quot;48 Hours&quot; has to<BR>be one of the best and most memorable films of that particular<BR>time periord.

0140189378|2.0|It took me longer to read this boring novella than it did to complete &quot;Gone With the Wind!&quot;  I know, I know, Bellow is a Nobel prize winner, but just because his work has merit doesn't make me like this tedious book any better.  This book is for you if the thought of endless talk about the price of soybeans and lard on the stock market, spoken by essentially dull characters, makes your heart beat faster and your pulse start racing.  Thankfully, this book was not my introduction to Bellow;  I started with his first two novels, &quot;Dangling Man,&quot; and &quot;The Victim,&quot; and I liked them.  Then I read &quot;Herzog&quot; and &quot;Mr. Sammler's Planet&quot; and I LOVED them.  I will never give up on this author -- he's a masterful writer, and his &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; and &quot;Humboldt's Gift&quot; are waiting for me on my bookshelf. (Books are so patient.) But &quot;Seize&quot; was definitely a disappointing dud.
B00003CX5P|5.0|This is incredible.  Since George Lucas was filming Episode II about a week after Episode I hit the theaters, he held off on releasing the DVD because to him it wasn't finished yet.  He has added back more to the movie in DVD format than was seen on the screen or the original VHS release.  Now there is much more of the pod race scene.  There is also an air-taxi scene which gives a better look at what Korasan (spelling may be off) looks like.  If your a fan of Star Wars, it's a must have.  Some people aren't sure they like the prequel idea.  But the fact is, this story is and always has been meant to be shown as a 12 hour (singular) movie.  Now it is on it's way.
B00003CXAA|1.0|Is it just me or are the scenes from the movies mixed up on the CDs. I have several scenes from Godfather I that are on the Godfather II CD &amp; vice versa.  This is the 2nd copy I have purchased &amp; they both have the same problem.  With all the hype about this collection you would think they would do some type of quality review prior to releasing it.   You Think??
B00005QG9J|4.0|It is a different sound considering Incubus. Alot of the album sounds like there last single &quot;Drive&quot;. Many songs are acoustic and soft. There are some songs like &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Nice To Know You&quot;, and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; that are full of electric sound. No, I don't think Incubus is selling out. I do think Incubus is getting softer. Anyways, it is pretty much a good CD. Many people will enjoy it. Its just not something the mosh to.

0399128964|3.0|Dune is an intricate and complex story. I read the book several times, and kept learning about it each time. The only drawbacks that it had to my mind is the overly complex vocabulary and how quickly it leaps into the story without giving the reader enough reference points: you are lost a little bit at the beginning. I would not recommend the other books of the original six. The one exception being Heretics of Dune, which grabbed me by the collar and I could not put it down. Chapterhouse Dune, to me at the time I read it, completely undid everything that Heretics of Dune accomplished. So I truly recommend nothing more by this author, though I add the disclaimer that I was a passionate teenager when I read them, and perhaps if I had read them at a different time in my life, I would not have been so offended. Dune is definitely the most complex of the original books. I have no insight into the Dune books written by Brian Herbert/this is for the original books alone.

0897500482|5.0|One of the greatest works about his martial art of Jeet Kune Do.  Although most of the entire book is taken straight from Lee's own personal notes, it does provide the reader with an excellent way of understanding his physical &quot;art&quot; that he called Jeet Kune Do (JKD).  There was much more than the physical aspect of JKD, and although the book does mention a little on it, the main focus is the training, body positions, mental thoughts, theories, strategies, concepts, etc., all of which must be understood, learned and practiced.  Overall a great item to add to anyone's Bruce Lee library!
B00003CY0V|5.0|come on this movie has to kick some serious booty.  lets look as to why.  it cannot be just a bunch of crappy action cuz john travolta is in it i mean did you see him in pulp fiction he is a good actor.  and then look at this halle berry shows her yabbos.  jeeze oh petes men how could this not be the ultimate movie.  just my opinion.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Like most &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans, I have been eagerly awaiting the release of &quot;Star Wars&quot; -- any &quot;Star Wars&quot; -- on DVD.  The wait is finally over and it was well worth it.  This DVD is, without question, the best DVD yet.  The picture and sounds quality is outstanding (those who complain about the DVD not being available in DTS sound must remember that is only a matter of preference as many like myself think DTS to be much ado about nothing), but the main reason for getting the DVD is the specieal features and brother does this have special features.  The enumerous items on the second disc include deleted scenes (including a few I wish had been included in the original film) not to mention the single best behind-the-scenes documentary I've ever seen (called &quot;The Beginning&quot;).  The usual DVD toys are here such as all the trailers (including the &quot;Tome Poem&quot; TV spots) .  The only things missing are more stuff with the actors and an all-music track (a terrific DVD special feature that is too sparingly used by studios).<br />As for those who continue to gripe about &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; as a film, I'm sure the vast majority of their population are of those who watched the film only once.  I, too, was disappointed by the film when it first came out; it was good, but not &quot;Star Wars&quot; good.  Then I saw it a second time and discovered it was better than I remembered.  Then came a third viewing, then a fourth and a fifth as it became better each time I watched it.  It is certainly not the best of the four movies, but the film grows on you as it as the hype from the film's release as well as expectations vanish.  With no hype and a familiarity of the story, your eyes wander to the amazing costumes, effects and set design as it becomes easier and easier to ignore Jar Jar Binks' more annoying traits and accept him for the amazing visual effect achievement he is.<br />If you've seen the film only once because you didn'tlike it, I recommend renting this DVD and I think you'll have a change of heart.  If you do like the film, BUY IT!<br />Now, if we can just get George Lucas to release his death grip on the original trilogy . . .
B000003NA4|5.0|Just for fun, I've been browsing Amazon reviews of this cd and can't believe I found folks dissing it.  Not only have I not been able to take it out of my car cd player since I bought it, and not only do I have trouble stopping myself from just listening to the first three tracks over and over, but I have blithely been ordering it for my friends--whether or not they like jazz.  I just cannot imagine anyone finding anything but consummate mastery in Krall's performance in this collection.<br />Go figure.  I think it's a gem and recommend it without reservation to anyone, any age (and will be giving it to my college student son for Christmas).
0790736039|5.0|I read the book first and I had a lot of problems getting to sleep at night because of the clown (and I was about 22 years old). I frightened me out!!! I enjoy the film as much as the book, I think it was pretty done. A film is never as good as the book anyway. But don't like clowns anymore. Though 10 years later, I read it again and IT still scares me a lot. I keep the book and I am sure that one day, I will read it again. SLEEP THIGHT .... CAROLINE
B00003CX5A|5.0|I love horror movies and have seen many of them. This way BY FAR my favorite! Tim Burton and Christina Ricci were amazing, the plot the special effects, everything was GREAT! Rent or buy this movie today, it is definately worth it!!!
B00003CXRM|1.0|Another reviewer mentioned that he was lost in the first 20 minutes. I wasn't lost but I kept asking myself -- O Brother why did I waste my money on this?<br />Sure the characters were witty at times and the plot definitely abstract -- but does that make a good overall movie.  Not in my opinion.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I picked up &quot;Gold&quot; the day after my father died in SC. While emotions may have had alot to do with it, I thank Ryan for getting me through a trying time.  I cannot wait to see him when he comes to WI in December.  I think he shows his range and talent by attempting new venues.  I have listened to all his efforts and feel that I can comment objectively.  Thanks again, Ryan.
B00005N9CV|4.0|After the truely excellent and popularly accessible*When I Look In Your Eyes*was so eagerly received, the follow up was always going to be difficult for Ms Krall to please all and sundry..From the final notes of *Why Should I Care*,as the bonus track finale of the previous CD,how would she satisfy the ravenous and insatiable fans?Well by delivering  intriguingly brave interpretations of ballard standards and latin bosa nova beats.<br />I personally cannot fault the selection,nor the excellent piano interpretations and style of Ms Krall and the lush string and orchetra arrangements.The strength of her vocals ,that husky *torch* interpretation are developing better than everand Tommy Lipuma is in the booth.HOWEVER,this CD should never be played during daylight hours!!!..it is adult, different from the former catalogue, and has a romantic quality that is best appreciated in the right setting.This simply is not like the previous outings,so to compare it to those will naturally disappoint.Lets be honest,if you have not heard her before,this is not the place to start!This CD needs the benefit of 5 or 6 plays to really allow a review that does it justice.Ms Krall's interpretations of *Love Letters* and *Cry Me A River*appeal to me and make me think that she should have sung all ballards.The Latin beats are not my favourites here,and require my attention and patience,but to refer to them as musack!!!..isnt that a bit harsh.The musicianship of the highest order from  her quartet,tight meshed with the orchestra and that piano playing is in itself worth the cost of the CD!<br />Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan she is not..but accessible ,talented and individual SHE IS!!!Overall a pleasing followup and progression in her career,but one for the already converted..what more do you want??Gershwin,Carmichael and Mercer..thankgod I have something to open that late night red wine for!! 4 stars..and live a little life is too short,the style and emotion cannot be denied.Pay the money go and buy it!!..you know you want to.nd buy it!!..you know you want to.
6300214753|4.0|This is a movie for a rainy day or any time you are bored.  It's a classic that can be watched over and over again, at any age.  I recommend this to anybody who wants to call in sick and relax for a few hours.
B00005Q2RZ|3.0|Having recently returned from Paris,and after remembering seeing a poster in the Paris Metro advertising Adams headlining a show including the Cowboy Junkies,,I was handed this limited Edition CD by a friend and asked to listen to it and comment.I respect this friend as he has an ear for the new and unusual and audibly pleasing.I was informed that reviews were quite positive.I was vaguely aware that Adams had fronted Whiskeytown,and had country rock leanings,so I was not listening with any preconceptions.<br />My initial response?..it is nothing if not ambitious..and flawed.It suffers from being overly long,and uneven..really a case of lack of quality of song suffering from uneven and ordinary quantity.It must be remembered that I also listened to the bonus tracks..which over all made the assault of styles on my senses complete.I do not think that several listens will remedy my initial feelings.<br />The CD commences with an impression of a place,*New York* New York* and ends down LAs,* Hollywood Blvd*...goodnight.It may have been better to limit the journey to a shorter stay in just one place,taking in the really excellent sights of the one city.<br />That isnt to say that there aren't some good tracks on this collection,its just that they are mixed with so many ordinary self indulgent ones that the excellence is overridden,which is unfortunate.The songs are introspective love lost and love misunderstood ,in the main,interspersed with somewhat rocking cliches as the fillers.Ryan appears to owe a lot to the likes of Neil Young Natalie Merchant and the Band,yet doesnt acknowledge that but refers to Elton John Alanis Morrisette*repeatedly in the CD notes*and just about every obscure friend and band he knows,and of course the fall back favourite,*Keith Richard*<br />The CD just misses the mark.It has some excellent musicanship and competent contributors,but it drags on and seems directionless at times,and suffers from some loose production.There is enough there however to warrant further notice to be given to Adams in the future,as long as he can censor his own enthusiasm and have others select the material.Tracks worth the journey to listen are 1 to 4,and the concluding 3 tracks,which exhibit a bluesy and rocking feel a little too late to save this CD..Adams musicanship (which is impressive on this outing)should be channelled to better result.<br />I gratefully handed the CD back to my friend,and logged this in as an interesting and thankfully cost free exercise.2 to 3 stars only,and I wouldnt pay the cost..as it wouldnt be on the CD player often enough.Sorry Ryan.ant further notice to be given to Adams in the future,as long as he can censor his own enthusiasm and have others select the material.Tracks worth the journey to listen are 1 to 4,and the concluding 3 tracks,which exhibit a bluesy and rocking feel a little too late to save this CD..Adams musicanship (which is impressive on this outing)should be channelled to better result.<BR>I gratefully handed the CD back to my friend,and logged this in as an interesting and thankfully cost free exercise.2 to 3 stars only,and I wouldnt pay the cost..as it wouldnt be on the CD player often enough.Sorry Ryan.
B00005OAA6|5.0|Victoria's first solo cd is remarkable!  She is the last of the original 5 Spice Girls to release a solo album.  And perhaps, they saved the best for last!  Highlights are 'Girlfriend', 'I Wish', and 'Whatchu Talkin' Bout'.  All tracks are awesome and range from dance ('Midnight Fantasy') to slow, loving ballads ('Every Part Of Me' written for Brooklyn Beckham 'Unconditional Love' for husband David Beckham).<br />This CD is definately worth every penny!!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears started her singing career at the age of 3. When she released her first ever album (at age 16), it was a smash hit. Her song \\"Baby One More Time\\" reached number one on her new album. !<br />When \\"Oops!I Did It Again\\" came out, I hurried to buy it right away. Thank goodness I did. They were going like hotcakes! Britney Spears' songs on here are pretty good. I'm only familiar with 3 songs on the album: Oops!I Did It Again, Stronger, and Lucky. I really enjoy her music videos. Now, Britney Spears is coming out with a brand new album entitled \\"Britney\\", which includes the main song \\"I'm A Slave 4 U.\\" <br />From \\"Hit Me Baby One More Time\\" to \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", Britney Spears has changed a lot. I think she is going to make an amazing comeback.
B00005OAA6|4.0|This was actually quite a good album, not that I doubted Victoria's abilities, but I hadn't gotten to hear enough of her before to make any accurate pre-judgements. It's too bad it wasn't released here in the U.S, but considering the un-popularity of the Spice Girls over here, I don't know if it would necessarily do that well.<BR>This album, as I said, is great, and is more pop-with-an-R&amp;B-edge than Mel B's which was just straight R&amp;B (also recommended.)<BR>Though this album does have a relatively similar sound for all the songs, it is a catchy feel-good sound that will always have you singing along. (I'm down with the vocodor!)<BR>These are the tracks that, to me, stand out the most:<BR>1/ I'm Not Such An Innocent Girl: Which of course is the snappy debut single which is just chock full of adittude and has sort of a flowing, breezy disco sound to it.<BR>2/ Girlfriend: just a fun, likeable, danceable song that you're guarenteed to enjoy, like at a club or something.<BR>3/ I.O.U: a very sweet ballad for her husband. But before you gag at the word ballad, let me tell you, she makes the R&amp;B ballad something creative to enjoy, as opposed to all that &quot;slow-jam&quot; nonsense, that makes you either want to hide under the couch, smash the radio, or fall asleep whenever you hear it, and makes it, well, what can I say; good.<BR>4/ Midnight Fantasy: Very much like her work with the Spice Girls, only this has a bit more of HER flavour. It's hard to explain. Very good.<BR>5/ I Wish: Great twist on R&amp;B, with some real funky adittude!!<BR>GIRL POWER!<BR>6/ Whatcha Talkin' Bout: Another cool song with a lot of adittude, and a bit more of an interestingly subtle groove, whatever you want to make of that statement.<BR>7/ And finally &quot;Every Part Of Me&quot;: An endlessly sweet and tear inducing ballad dedicated to her son, Brooklyn and even includes some of his cute vocalizations! If you aren't moved by this one...I don't know?!<BR>Though all of the songs onthis album are great and fit in in their own way, and show great adittude, I wanted to pick some of the big standouts to give you an idea of the real treat you're in store for if you buy this album.<BR>So please do. You surely won't be disappointed.<BR>RECOMENDED!!<BR>(or did I say that already?)
B00005221M|2.0|As others have noted, the original movie is awesome. The VHS version is awesome. But don't spend your money on this pathetic DVD. Some of the problems:<br />The complete removal of the Clannad song presents an interesting, though inferior, variation of the movie. Technically, the DVD has visible glitches, which should have been corrected before the DVD was released. Some of the darker scenes have been lightened, which only serves to destroy the mood and remind you that you're watching a movie. You'll also learn why the last scene was edited severely in the original movie as you slowly begin to fall asleep from the boring political statement that is made....<br />The DVD should have included the original version so that we could all ignore the absolutely lousy director's cut. (...)
B00000K19E|5.0|This was a great movie, it really makes you wonder about how real your wolrd is and if your already in something like the matrix. The special effeccts were great too, they made you think dodging bullets could really happen. I liked the way that the matrix pirates could controll the laws of physics and &quot;bend&quot; them.
B00004YW6I|4.0|This album is a worthy listen if you've already been introduced to PJ Harvey; it's not particularly groundbreaking, but there are no bad songs either.  I actually enjoyed Thom Yorke's voice for once on &quot;This Mess We're In&quot; and the blister of &quot;Kamikaze&quot; should definitely have lasted for more than 2:30.  &quot;We Float&quot; is also an interesting piano groove.  Sounds like Patti Smith mostly.
B000002HO3|3.0|Simply Red is one band I enjoyed in the late 1990's. This collection delivers great pop songs like It's Only Love, and Your Mirror. Although the popularity of the band vanished in the 1990's, Simply Red remains a driving force that people still think of as an '80's band.
B000001E7T|5.0|This is not an album for the faint of heart!  Many people I know, people who like Tori Amos, people to whom Ani DiFranco is the ultimate feminist rocker, good people, cannot bear this album.  It begins with a strung-out confession (&quot;To Bring You My Love&quot;) and just gets darker from there on out.  The police whistle in the middle of the almost Nine Inch Nails-like stomp and grind of &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; is quite possibly the best effect on the album.  My favorite, though, would have to be the quiet, harmonics-laced &quot;Working For The Man.&quot;
B000003TAL|4.0|i like this album a lot, but i still think evol is the better choice...it is a more &quot;mellow&quot; albumm than evol. well anyway get both of them. the trilogy is awesome!
B00005OAJ1|1.0|I'm very disappointed.  Gass and Black were hilarious doing this same material with just two acoustic guitars.  Gass is a talented guitarist, and Black is a talented vocalist, and doing their two-man show, they pulled off a silly/overblown/rock-and-roll-dream schtick that made my wife remark &quot;oh, their voices are so pretty... but then I heard what they were singing....&quot;  It was priceless.<br />Unfortunately, that charm is lost, drowned out by a vanilla shlock-rock backing that adds nothing and subtracts much.  It has converted one of the most interesting music/comedy acts to come out in a while into a something that sounds like bad 80's pseudopunk (e.g. Angry Samoans, Surf Punks, etc.)<br />My only remaining hope is that they follow this up with an &quot;unplugged&quot; album.
B0000025KI|5.0|This is the album which comes closest  to capturing Bruce Springsteen's  vision of what a vast, desolate yet hopeful country America had become as it entered the last quarter of the last century.  It best captures the contradictory nature of human relations, and also gives us an unflinching glimpse of what can go wrong when we choose to sever those relations.<br />     The greatest contribution that Springsteen has made to rock - besides the wonderful wonderful garage band-fervor of his life shows - has been  the psychological depth of his lyrics. On  songs like &quot;Stolen Car,&quot; anf &quot;Point Blank,&quot; he shows us hidden truths about ourselves that no one before him had ever been brave - or talented - enough to address.<BR>   <BR>     The rockers here are just as insightful: Who would have thought a rockabilly rave-up like &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot; would include lines like &quot;So Buddy When I die/Throw  My Body In The Back&quot;? Some of the lesser songs here (&quot;Crush On You,&quot; &quot;I'm A Rocker&quot;) seem to be mere stalling tactics to avoid self-destruction.<br />      The E Street Band reached an incredible peak of performing with this album. I encourage anyone interested in getting to know what al the buzz was about  way back when to listen to this album FIRST.
B0000024UX|5.0|I bought this album on vinyly when it was released. As an impoverished student I had to be careful where I spent money, else I woudn't eat. This record was worth all the meals I missed! BOTW was a MASSIVE hit as both a single and album here in the UK and it's really not hard to hear why.<br />Overwhelming the whole set is BOTW itself. This song, supremely performed, defines the meaning of friendship. It is the music of angels.<br />Almost all the other pieces on the album are excellent as well, thus justifying my purchase all those years ago. It's one of the first LPs where I learned all the words to all the songs. However, the vinyl did wear out and was eventually replaced by CD.<br />One thing I find interesting is that my son (now 19 and at university himself) listened through this CD recently and fell in love with it himself - wonders will never cease!
0064471837|5.0|I had seen both &quot;Sabriel&quot; and &quot;Lirael&quot; and had not given them very much thought.  It was not until I was getting ready to leave for a trip to the Carribean, so of course I stopped into Borders for a book.  I am education major and love to keep up of the books that I might use in the classroom with kids.  So I came across &quot;Sabriel&quot; and decided that it was one of the books to take on the trip.  I started it on the flight back and fell in love with the book.  It is a great mesh of magic and thrill, along with mystical countries and peopeles.  You are guided through a young girls coming of age as a necromancer.  You follow the main character from her leaving of all that she has come to know and heading out into a world that is: 1). out to get her and a stop to her bloodline of Abhorsen, and 2).  not the same as it was.  Her fight of the undead and their controller is epically fought.  Leaving readers to wonder through out the book if good will triumph over evil.<br />In general this is an excellent read.  I would put it right on the shelf with the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, and the &quot;The Golden Compass.&quot;  Both adults and children can get into this fantasy book and will walk away wanting to read the sequel.
B000001DQI|5.0|What words of mine can express how important this album is? It was released as a two-LP 'concept album' at a time when solo artists just didn't do that sort of thing.<br />The songs will be well-known to many people, but listening to them here as they were (almost) first presented shows us what Elton wanted. I fiund the remix not as satisfying as the original LPs mainly because they have a slightly irritating clinically clean quality to them. The original dub onto vinyl somehow holds more 'body'.<br />These pieces are without doubt some of the most important pop music from the era, particularly &quot;Candle in the Wind&quot; which is both captivating and haunting. &quot;Bennie &amp; the Jets&quot; lets us listen to a totally different Elton, a raunchy rocky Elton.<br />Quite amazing and still brilliant today.
B00000JPH6|2.0|I think the title sums it up.  I can't believe Henson made this film.  It's entirely too dark and strange for my liking.  It still scares the hell out of me to this day.  I can only imagine the effect it would have on a small child.  If you want to watch something of this genre, whether it be by yourself or with your kids, get The Neverending Story or one of the Star Wars films.  This isn't worth your time.
B00000251N|5.0|My brother introduced me to this record just after it was first released some 28 years ago. I can remember the occasion as if it were yesterday. I was sleeping late on a Saturday morning and I was awakened by music echoing through the house. Music that was haunting, expressive, flowing. Words that were insightful, thoughtful, introspective and, most of all, moving.<br />Eventually, I got up and went downstairs to find out what I had been listening to, and I discovered that it was Jonathan Livingstone Seagull by Neil Diamond. Well, I was captivated; truly, deeply captivated. I'd rarely heard such rich, wonderfully expressive modern music before. Yes, I knew of Neil Diamond, but this record made me see and hear him in a new light.<br />I bought the album and wore it out after many playings over many years. I've seen the film so many times I've lost count, but one thing still gives me shivers as I watch it is the combination of absolutely superb photography matched to the superlative soundtrack. I cannot understand how, in Britain at least, this film got relegated to art-house status and didn't get the wide release it dererves.<br />Even today (now I have the CD) I find that in troubled times I can darken my lounge, lie back in my favourite chair, listen to this music and feel my worries subside. It is so relaxing.
B00005RIZP|5.0|Oh man, where do I start?  This film is one of my favorite horror films.  It has the right mixture of horror, suspense, and comedy.  It also has small amounts of gore (well, by today's standards) which is a good thing to some viewers.<br />The plot of the film is simple.  It takes place at a sorority house/boarding school around Christmas time.  A crazed killer finds his way into the attic of the house and starts making obscene phone calls from the second phone line.  Then, he starts offing the inhabitants of the house one by one.  Olivia Hussey stars as the film's heroine and Keir Dullea co-stars as her misunderstood love interest... but Margot Kidder steals the show as Hussey's drunken, foul mouthed friend.  A very young Andrea Martin (of SCTV fame) is also in the film.<br />This film inspired elements of the Scream movies, When A Stranger Calls, and countless others.  I recommend it to anyone who loves a good scary movie.
B000001GQT|4.0|This is a very good performance of this piece by Strauss, as you might expect from such a great orchestra and conductor, especially when produced by DG.<br />However, one thing seems to be missing on this recording. That thing is presence! Listen to the vinyl LP digital recording that Karajan made for Deautshe Gramophon and the one thing that strikes you if you're using a decent sound system is the presence. You can hear the very air move and vibrate as the orchestra plays, and most especially when they pause.<br />Well worth the purchase, nonetheless.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|In America we often seem to miss the best of international music, focusing instead on our own muscial genres, pop, R&amp;B, rock, and jazz.  It was a pleasure then to learn of Manu Chao in Barcelona, and to be present when he made an appearance there in September.<br />In Proxima Estacion Esperanza, this international funk beat combines the best of the peoples of the diaspora, (Africa), with the authentic spanish and Afri-French sounds. A successful combination especially when you throw in a bit of reggae.<br />I hope that here in America we can become more exposed to music which combines the best of all cultures... Espero por mas Manu Cha!
B00005AW41|5.0|I was exposed to this album due to it being connected with Leiji Matsumoto (of Star Blazers and Speed Racer fame). While Daft Punk's music is decidedly their own style, if you like works by Kraftwork, Erasure, Art Of Noise, but can also groove to Stevie Wonder or Jamiroquai, then you will love this CD!
B00003CXDD|5.0|this is a wonderful film for kids of all ages. it is a great story and very imaginative. i recommend it to all.
B00005AQGH|5.0|(...)Welcome to the alter-ego of the late Tupac Amaru Shakur. Tupac may have pasted on, but through his music he lives forever. This album might have the best single disk of all of tupac's work. Bomb First! a great intro, but yet its also a full lenghth track! Hail Mary, My personal fav. on the disk. The first line is the single greatest verse in all of the game.(see above). Toss It Up, sounds a lot like no diggity, it could be a diss, no one really knows. But the really great thing about this album is the way it flows from song to song. There is no pause in the action on The 7 day theory, the tracks mix together and make for a very interesting listening experence.<BR> You see when you are a long time pac fan like I am, choosing a single CD (kid)to say is the best is hard to do. But I can say that I have played my \\"7 Day Theory\\" so many times it has worn out! (...)
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I bought this CD after falling in love with Fiona in Tidal, and after quite a number of hearings I can say this is by far one of the best CDs I own. It's musically complete...one of the albums you can hear from the first to the last song and enjoy each song's uniqueness. Fiona must be one of the best singers around in popular music. I tell you really don't miss it.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I'm not really keen for Bluegrass or movie soundtracks (I only have a few sountracks in my CD collection) but I'd thought I'd make an exception this time.  After seeing the movie, I was dying to get the soundtrack but kept procrastinating.  After channel-surfing and seeing the ending of a country music video of &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; by Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch, I decided then and there that I'd get the soundtrack.<br />Well, I just got it yesterday and needless to say, I'm quite pleased with it.  It's opened my eyes to Bluegrass music (I usually listen to classical, pop, or Contemporary Christian).  I especially liked &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot; and &quot;I'll Fly Away.&quot;<br />I recommend that you run, don't walk, to the nearest store and get this soundtrack.  You will not regret it.
068485015X|4.0|I tend to avoid self-help books but the title of this one intrigued me.  After reading a little of it in the book store I bought it and have not at all been disappointed.  Among all the books promising secret formulas for success, in a society which reads horoscopes and seems to be the repository of all the talismans in the history of the world, it is most refreshing to read a book that dares to tell the simple truth - life ain't easy.<br />I most like Peck's discussion of love. True love requires a lot of work.  It requires a lot of communication.  The act of truly listening to someone is at one and the same time the simplest and the most difficult thing a person can do, the least and the most that can be done.  There are so many people who could benefit from taking this message to heart.<br />Having said this, I do have some criticisms of the book.  Peck does not relate his thoughts to that of others.  What he says resonates with the existential idea that we create our own meanings. It would have been nice to have had a discussion of this. I also do not care for his discussion of religious grace. It is not just that I am an atheist. It is that the idea that God's love works magic is at odds with the message about the work required for love. I have also looked at some of the books that Peck wrote after this one and found them disappointing. Nevertheless I whole-heartedly recommend this work. It contains a simple morning after sobering message that society as a whole can benefit from and that I as an indvidual found very useful.
6305165912|5.0|This is the story of The Dude. The Dude, Jeff Lebowski, is an unemployed, occasional drug taking loser whose life revolves around bowling with his best friend Walter. Walter is a Vietnam vet who tries to literally relate everything to Vietnam. One day the Dude's rug (the one that tied the room together) is ruined by 2 cronies who think he's Mr. Lebowski. (the other Lebowski, the big one). The story just gets zanier (and funnier) from here. Amazing how such an odd moive could revolve around bowling but it works here. John Goodman plays his Walter character perfectly as does Jeff Daniels as The Dude. This movie isn't so much a plot as much as a vehicle to display these zany characters the Coen brothers have made and it works perfectly. Easily one of the best comedies of the 90s.
B00004YYDI|5.0|Leon (or The Proffesional as it was called in the states) was a great film the first time I saw it. Tough and realistic with actors portraying emotional characters. <BR>But it felt like Luc Besson somehow missed something. I saw the original Leon as unfinished and it was, well, it was cut about fifteen minutes. And what I get to watch in the final version, Leon-the uncut (international version) works even better. I loved the film from the moment I saw it. Italian hitman (or cleaner as refered to in the film) Leon (Jean Reno in one of his greatest performances) lives alone in New Yorks Little Italy until a crazy drug addicted DEA agent (played by a totally believable Gary Oldman) and his team, murders a family where the father is a courier trying to trick the corrupt agents. The abused daughter Mathilda (wonderfully played by twelve year old debutant Nathalie Portman. First time I saw the film I was in her age so I just fell in love.) is the only survivor and she is taken in by Leon. To get revenge for her little brother, Mathilda makes a bargain with the hitman. If she teaches him to read he will teach her to clean. But at the same time their feelings towards each other start to grow and in the end it will effect them both.<BR>What was left out of the film when first released was the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. In the first version Mathilda is looking for something of a father figure which she finds in Leon but in the uncut version they are practically lovers. Mathilda declares her love for him many times before we get to the point where we understand that it can never be the happy end that she wants.<BR>A powerful film and Luc Bessons best.
B00003CX5P|4.0|the main thing I have been looking for was not here. That is additional Darth Maul scenes. Was hoping to see the scene with the &quot;Fear&quot; dialog...I know, a Phantom Menace &quot;Special Edition&quot; can't be far around the corner, right? Make us by the same movie again but for a few additional scenes/features. Should have been on this one.
B00003CXFG|3.0|When I sat down in the theater watching Pitch Black for the first time I just went numb the first five minutes. I can't explain it, it was one of the best openings I've seen. A spaceship travelling towards an unknown destination with a caged serial killing animal onboard (ferociusly played by Vin Diesel, in the first role I've seen him in since Saving Private Ryan) narrating the first few minutes with a dialogue so taut that I just had to shrug. And the music by Graeme Revell together with Diesels deep almost spellbinding voice. The ship goes down in a psychedelic fury of images and colours, and crashlands on a remote desert planet. Once down the pilots get together with the other survivors which include an Imam and his three sons (said to be going to New Mecca, it can't get any better folks), a marshall (that is actually a bountyhunter taking Diesels character Riddick back to jail after he escaped for the last time) and a bounch of australian and english people. They soon find out that the planet got three suns, that Riddick is on the loose and that something unseen is killing people in the dark. Up to this point the movie is just great, the pictures and characters, especially Radha Michell as the pilot Fry and Cole Hauser as bountyhunter Jonhs (succeding where his father Wings didn't). But this is Vin Diesels show, just seeing him running in something that can only be compared to a Nike or Reebok commercial showing of his well trained body makes for a movie above the usual action/sci-fi/adventure genre. And hearing him talk, delivering lines that would put Hannibal Lecter to shame makes for something just unbelievable. Up to a point it can't get any better and it just fails. These three suns go into an eclipse every twentytwo years and when that happens the creatures from within come out to feed. Our surviving friends just happened to come at the right time for the big feast. Pale creatures with no eyes flying out over the planets surface communicating through something that sounds like dolphin singing. Oh, and just one more thing, Riddick can see at night and he actually turns out to be a not so bad guy. And my faith in this movie went down just after Riddick seeing the creatures approaching, saying: &quot;Beautiful&quot;<BR>Towards the end not even Diesel can keep it up.<BR>And when it's over I feel that it could have been so much better but because of Vin Diesel giving me faith that he is in fact the next big thing I give it a three star rating.
0452282152|2.0|I heard well-read friends rave about this book, and I finally got around to reading it.  Sheesh...It's nothing but a feather-weight, romance novel type tale of archetypal characters!  We already know the cast: The illiterate but wise yet plucky  housemaid, the silent and enigmatic lord of the household, the shrewish wife, the jealous co-worker.  &lt;yawn&gt;  Aside from nice language that describes the painting technique, there's no there there.  Maybe it works for people who don't read much?  I felt let-down.
B00000JCB3|1.0|This Album is pure garbage and should be all together destroyed. If there was a way to destroy a piece of music so it could never be played again, this cd ould be a good choice. I do love though how arrogant this record is when there making complete trash. Bizkit is over and Fred Durst should just become some record executive because thats about the only thing he could do, promote and be a prostitute for his so called &quot;album&quot;
B00005QG9J|4.0|&quot;I suggest we learn to love ourselves  before it's made illegal&quot;..<BR>First of all, this album is like nothing else.  Probably why i like it, I tend toward music that fulfills a genre all its own.  You will never find yourself saying, &quot;isn't this.... who is this?&quot;.  This is Incubus.  This is a heavy ocean breeze coarsing with passion.. Even with quite a few tracks  dancing around some painful lost love and descended disrespectful relationships (in songs like Nice to Know You, Circles, Just a Phase, Blood on the Ground, Mexico, Under My Umbrella, Aqueous Transmission), in general i can feel Brandon Boyd's respect for the experience of these relationships when they are well, what he learns from them when they are not.  His continuing journey is piercing and beautiful, rich in the look in his eyes i see behind my own, watching the mist reaching out over the sea.  The band, Brandon, Kilmore, Jose, Michael, and Dirk, are working so well together.  Their art and their harmony is transcendental; when you close you eyes you can feel the energy that made this music pulsing in the earth beneath your feet.  And you know that it is that energy that reached up into their bodies and rushed through chests and arms and souls just to see the  morning view...  it is maybe for that experience that They call it rock music ;-)..  Even the heaviest songs roll out for the melody and guitar to breathe, then swallowed again in the swell.  This album is inspired and inspiring, manifesting the simple beauty of humanity and the roaring and always beautiful weight of emotion in the stuff that makes life worth living: good music.  Thank you Incubus.
B00004WG2X|5.0|This version captured the true image of Mr. Darcy: the very serious, very awkward, and dark of mood. This version correctly captured the sharpness and emotion of Elizabeth. Other versions are too flat, and too fluffy soft.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This cd is one that you grow with. The more you play the more it gets better and better and I like those type of cds. The cd is rock yet mellow at the same time. If you liked Make Yourself, then you might be surprised by their new cd. If you look at the past Incubus cds you notice a change in each of them and they all have been good ones. One thing that I like a lot is their funk and jazziness they got in them. Are You In? is a great song with some funkiness and Mike made a great song using some Chinese guitar. Echo reminds me of Stellar but its unique in its own way. Circles is another favorite song of mine due to the drums. The whole band is really good individually at their instruments and even better when they play collectively. I recommend this cd by a lot.
B000021YQV|5.0|Im a big RAGE fan because zack always sounded so angry but since they broke up i have to find my new favorite band and i think i found them. System of a down knows how to rock hard and he sometimes sounds angry to and i think their music has meaning just like rage. This cd is so good i would give every song 5 stars so uhh.. go buy it!!!

B000056K04|5.0|Well only one word comes to mind when I think of the album Everyday,different. Any DMB fan knows that the band has stuck to their grassroots record producer Steve Lillywhite for almost ten years and all the sudden they changed to producer Glen Billard. I think this was one of the best changes for the band. Eventhough they still have a lot of respect for Lillywhite they thought it was time for a change of pace. They wanted to explore new territories and by switching producers they did. Now for some of the die hard DMB fans this album was hard to digest. With the difference in the sound and style I would say some fans are disappointed. But look at this album as the start of a new DMB. Now is not like they are totally going to drop their old style. If you went to one of their live shows last summer you know what I'm talking about. They will never break free from what the started out as. It's to important to them and it's to important to us as fans. So I give this cd 5 stars because change is good thing and Dave and the guys deserve to explore their artistic abilities because that's how we came to like them in the first place.

B000002URV|5.0|Enigma MCMXC AD is the best and the most soothing album i heard. Its a flow of music that changes you with it.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall is a talented vocalist, but her performance here is flat and uninspired.  Even if her interpretation were more interesting, her particular style would not suit the song selection.  And last but not least, what exactly is the point of covering signature songs by legendary artists such as Ella Fitzgerald &amp; Billie Holiday?  In my view, it is an insult to the memory of the artists in question, and to the intelligence of aficionados everywhere.
6305358613|5.0|I have studdied the reign and life of Elizabeth I for the past 12 years. This movie very accurtly portrays Elizabeth as a person, if not always accurate with historican facts.  If you were moved my this movie to learn more about Good Queen Bess, look for several books by Alison Wier and Antonia Fraser. Also there are also several historical mysteries out there that portray her inner life and life at court rather accuratly, including the Robsart Murder. The author of these books is Fiona Buckley.<BR>All in all I LOVE this movie and find myself watching it at least once a week...
B000002A46|5.0|I bought the audio cassette of Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas when it first came out in 1994. I fell in love with it immediately. I enjoy every song on this tape. I think my favorite is &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot;. Mariah does a beautiful job on this song. But from beginning to end, every song is very well done. I'm not a fan of Mariah Carey (anymore), but her voice is beautiful and I will listen to Merry Christmas every holiday season until it breaks. And then I'll get a new one. :) Don't hesitate to buy this CD. It's a must have for any lover of Christmas and Christmas music.
B000003S28|5.0|This album was my introduction into Brian Eno, and I could not have made a better choice. Obviously this record was intended for film scores, and some of the songs actually did land on a film. I believe two of the songs from this album are in a Ramones movie, can anyone say &quot;irony?&quot; The content of Music For Films is very dark and subtel. At some points I find M.F.F very choppy, the album dosen't have the streamline or seamless effect of Ambient Music For Airports. If you love Brian Eno or interested in his ambient music this would be a good place to start.
0446677450|5.0|Hi, are you ready to change your life?<br />Make no mistake, financial planners are great, but there are better ways to make money rather than making balanced investments and following a balanced liability-ridden lifestyle.<br />This book will mercilessly challenge your perception of the financial world, show you how the money truly works, and advise you on how to get out of the dreaded &quot;rat race&quot;.<br />I wish I had known of this book about 18 months ago when I was making substantial excessive income sufficient to get me out of this game very fast. Alas, my brain was forced to work harder for less money.<br />I was intuitively living the lifestyle of the author, and now he's given me the advice necessary to move forward at high speed.<br />If you are of a contrarian state of mind, this book is going to look familiar. If you have the mainstream perception, be prepared to be beaten up severely for your misled beliefs.<br />This is the first book in the series, therefore it has a very motivational feel to it.<br />This book is cheap, buy it and change your life!<br />I wish you good health and much prosperity,<br />Leonid S. Knyshov
0671449028|1.0|I really like this author's books.  Moo Baa La La La is one of my daughter's favorites.  However, I threw this one out.  The idea of exercising AFTER bath is illogical to me and not a concept I want to promote with my child.  Bath-time signals an end to vigorous activities and a time for calm restful activities.  I really don't think she thought this one through well enough.

B00003CX5P|5.0|A great dvd release full of many extras that will entertain all the Star Wars aficionados.I hope that this one is the begining of a new Dvd Trilogy fully restored.I hope that the studio don't let us waiting more time to release this magnificent trilogy.<br />Indispensable.
B00005QG9J|3.0|So sings Brandon Boyd a few lines into &quot;warning&quot; of the new Incubus album &quot;Morning View.&quot; Though it could just be a random thought that fit the rest of the song, for the band it's been their response to numerous reviews calling them a softer, weaker version of its former self. Rolling Stone yawned at the new album, in essence calling it &quot;boring&quot; and giving it 2 stars out of 5. True, the music is far brighter and more relaxed than the band's past releases. The music is just as serene as the album's cover. But many forget that human beings have written this album, and as the artists' view points change, so does the art. This is a happier, more optimistic Incubus. And the music is fantastic. The band's new acoutic driven position was all-too predictable after their first taste of mainstream success with &quot;Make Youself's&quot; alternative ballad &quot;Drive.&quot; The several new acoustic songs come as no surprise. But the individual songs make this one a solid 4 star effort, while &quot;Make Yourself&quot; was their classic masterpiece; 5 stars by far. &quot;Morning View&quot; is sort of Make Yourself volume two, and difference between the songs are paralleled by the two albums' cover art; dark on &quot;Make Yourself,&quot; light on &quot;Morning View.&quot; The hard, rock-out metal-rap sound of &quot;SCIENCE&quot; is all but on the back-burners for Incubus, though the sound worked for them at the time (4 stars as well).<br />&quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; is the sort of rocker that many Incubus fans of the past would expect and appreciate. But they must let time get them accustomed to the acoustic sounds of &quot;Wish you Were Here,&quot; &quot;11 am,&quot; &quot;Mexico,&quot; &quot;Echo,&quot; and the fantastic afore-mentioned &quot;Warning.&quot; True to the Incubus trend, the radio-songs will not be the album's high-lights. In fact, after first listen, the first single &quot;Wish you Were Here&quot; is one of the weakest structured and uninteresting of the entire album. I guess that shows you how good it can be... Enjoy
B00003CX5P|2.0|I bought this DVD mostly because I love the first 3 movies and remembered thinking this one was okay when I saw it in the theater.  Watching it again, I could not believe how painfully slow this movie feels or how bad most of the dialog is.  The movie opens pretty strongly with the Jedi knights on a diplomatic mission that quickly turns ugly.  It was a pleasure to watch Jedi knights on screen at the peak of their powers after watching Luke struggle to learn the art through the earlier films.<br />Unfortunately, the movie starts to go downhill quickly once they land on Naboo.  The introduction of the infamous Jar Jar Binks is only one irritant as the story bogs down in an incredibly lengthy attempt to escort the queen of the Naboo back to the homeworld of the Republic (ironically, they scarcely get there before deciding to return to Naboo, making the whole thing an even bigger waste of time).  Virtually the entire time spent on the desert world of Tattooine crawls by as improbable event after improbable event is inflicted on us.  Young Annakin is impossibly wise and mature to the point that it seems almost bizarre when he is around other children quite some time after we first meet him.  His character is an adult part acted out by a young boy.<br />The battle with Obi Wan and Qui-Gon attempting to handle Darth Maul is entertaining to a point but badly tarnished by the two of them constantly (and uselessly) twirling around in circles between blows.  This is done strictly for drama to prolong the fight.  All the twirling allows Darth Maul to block both of their light sabers and battle them to a standstill for some time.  If the fight were filmed realistically with 2 Jedi attacking from opposite sides at full speed he would be dead in 10 seconds.<br />Without belaboring every flaw of this film (there are far more), suffice to say that this is for hardcore Star Wars fans only.  Anyone who is simply looking for an entertaining film can find far better elsewhere.
0066620996|1.0|I bought this book after reading a lot of gushing reviews. I was disappointed. To me the author still does not answer the question of things managers should do in growing their companies under extreme uncertainty. There are lot of feel-good moments but very little practical and useful advice.<br />Let me elaborate on this. I ran a B2B startup for several years. Yes, we wanted to build a great company. We had the vision, funding, the great people, and customers. Yet, we struggled to make the company work. The environment we were operating in went from &quot;heaven&quot; to &quot;hell&quot; in a matter of six months. Every operating plan we developed for &quot;heaven&quot; had to thrown out to adapt to &quot;hell&quot;. <br />I know that one needs to build a company to last and all the other cliches, but when you are in the midst of war, with no map, uncharted terrain and running out of food (funding) -- few of the principles in this book apply. That's exactly the environment most companies are in today. <br />I am sure this book will do very well as many Fortune 1000 managers are now searching for comfort in a turbulent environment. The author probably will have many speaking engagements lecturing/cheerleading terrified managers who have never seen anything like this economy before. For instance, I predict that many retailers will be forced to go out of business by March. I wonder how the rules of this book help retailers survive this holiday season.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Which is very much the case now that Star Wars has made the leap into DVD! Still you could have wished to have seen the deleted scenes in the movie when it was out in theaters to begin with! Probably would have softened the blow the critics gave it! Still that is what DVD's really are all about, and this one is very special indeed. While taking us into the making of film, we also got to see the theatrical trailers (the teaser I liked the most), as well as interviews with the cast and crew. Now in terms of the story and the characters themselves, I really did like the story format, and how Anakin Skywalker begins his road to the dark side of the force. It does mimic the other Star Wars movies, but in a way it makes you really think of the paths these characters have or will take. It's also very much the case of what George Lucas would have done with the previous movies, if he had the digital technology back then. Ultimately, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; really does stand proud, and apart. I can't wait to review &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; when it arrives on DVD. A great movie all together!!
B000002UAU|2.0|After all these years, I cannot understand how this recording can possibly be considered \\"the greatest\\" album of all time. The sad fact is this album was never any good, and time has not been at all kind to it.<br />Yes, there are one or two songs on it that still hold up: \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\" and \\"A Day in the Life.\\" But two songs don't make an album, much less a masterpiece. On the other hand, the overrated \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" is extremely low-key and I much prefer William Shatner's psychotic version. Most of the rest of it, however, seems to have been put together with a nail and a hammer. There's more filler here than probably any other Beatles album, and the filler should have best been left unreleased. The sound effects are abominable, and I have never heard a more disjointed \\"concept\\" album in my life.<br />The only explanation for this mess, other than drugs, is pure cynicism by the Beatles. Hailed by the media and many fans as geniuses after putting out a string of memorable albums and singles, they eventually believed their own p.r. Crucial to the Beatles as gods myth was the creation of a subspecies of humanity or subhuman species (depending on your viewpoint) called the rock music critic. These rebels in search of a cause analyzed every song and every word ever spoken by the Beatles as though it came down from Mt. Sinai. Naturally this idolization went to the band's collective heads. If critics, much less fans, couldn't tell the difference between trash and treasure, why should the Beatles have helped them? Hence this slipshod album. The tragedy of Sgt. Pepper is that not only was it wildly successful and overpraised, but it paved the way for the hideous psychedelia and art rock of the late 60s and early 70s (brilliantly satirized by the Stones in their underrated masterpiece Their Satanic Majesties Request).<br />Because of the two above mentioned songs and because of the album's undeniable influence on popular music, it is recommended as a curiosity piece and is of course essential for Beatles completists.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Beautifully restored print captures the best female musical performance in the history of American cinema.  I saw the restored print on the big screen in NYC and the DVD captures all the magic!
0446310786|5.0|This is a book which I believe that everyone in the entire nation should read some time in their life.  The messages from this book are so powerful, yet it is easy and enjoyable to read, so you don't have to be an English expert or a great reader to be able to read this book and get something positive from it.  12 year olds would love this book. This book does a great job of addressing the issue of racism.  So if you haven't read this book, then read it right now.  Make it the next book you buy.
0783223218|5.0|Willis plays a hired assassin named the Jackal, hired to kill the U.S. First lady. FBI agents hire Gere, to hunt down and stop the Jackal before he carries out his assignment.

Fantastic.
B000002BMV|5.0|I recently bought my third copy of this album, which consists entirely of songs that are anthems of my youth.  I can still remember the first time I heard &quot;Don't Stop Believin,&quot; which was my initial exposure to Journey.  I immediately loved the song and later purchased Escape on cassette.  It was my first album by Journey.<br />Ultimately, I bought all the albums Journey had put out through 1986, including Raised on Radio.  I bought Escape on vinyl because I wore out the cassette by listening so much, and I could always re-record the record onto a cassette.  Journey was my very favorite band during the first half of the 1980's, until a 1985 release called &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; by a legendary Irish band.  <br />This past week I bought Escape on CD, and the music sounds better than ever.  I'm not speaking solely about the outstanding quality of digital music.  This is a magnificent album, highlighting Steve Perry's soaring and singular vocals, superb craftsmanship in songwriting, and outstanding musicianship from the band.  No wonder these guys were superstars.  <br />Every song on this disc is excellent.  With Escape, produced back in 1981, Journey proved that a band could glide between hard rockers and soft ballads with persuasive confidence.  Who can forget the majestic &quot;Open Arms,&quot; the masterful opening track, or the heart-wrenching &quot;Who's Crying Now&quot;?  While these were the big singles, there are many more jewels on this album: the title track is nothing short of an adventure; &quot;Still They Ride&quot; is spine-tingling; &quot;Lay It Down&quot; showcases Steve Perry's amazing voice; &quot;Stone in Love&quot; is a great rocker; and the list goes on...<br />This is one of my all-time favorite albums.  I recommend it without hesitation!

I had never heard of india.arie when I saw this CD, but something told me I just had to have it. india.arie is one talented woman and I'm sure we will hear more from her in the years to come.  She writes her own music and plays the acoustic guitar.  She has a sound all her own---and what a sound!  When I listen to this CD I am touched someplace deep in my soul.  I hope she releases another CD soon.....before I wear this one out!

B00005N9CV|4.0|There is a simple beauty to Ms. Krall's other albums-the honesty of her voice, the intimacy of her piano playing and the subtle accompaniment of the other musicians makes for a fine recording. This album, however, goes to the other extreme, though, not in a bad way. Granted it is a new recording style for her, complete with an orchestra and some really smooth arrangements. Don't be swayed by negative reviews of this CD. If you like Ms. Krall, you will like this CD. I always try to not compare recordings of particular songs to other artists...but, I have to say Ms. Krall's &quot;Cry Me A River&quot; does rival Julie London's. There are not any 'upbeat' selections contained on this album, which is just fine with me. As a fan you just have to realize that Ms. Krall is trying something new. Why not? Her voice is absolutely beautiful and remains intimate and honest on this CD. The lushness of the orchestration, though, almost overpowers the simplicity of her unique stylizing. I do hope this recording is just a small detour on her musical road. Getting lost forever on this detour will do a disservice to those of us who enjoy hearing Ms. Krall sing as though she is at a small backroads jazz club singing only to us.
0767805712|5.0|I am a biochemist, and when I saw the trailers for this film, my friends and I both laughed at how silly the movie looked based upon the marketing pitch.<br />However, when GATTACA was released on DVD, I decided to give it a try, and was surprised at the thoughtfulness of the plot and the execution of the message.<br />&quot;There is no gene for the human spirit.&quot; Indeed, people cannot by put into a rigid box based upon their color, their size, their shape, or their DNA. The movie masterfully works with this theme without appearing too preachy or contrived in their science. <br />In today's world of science fiction, which means blowing up aliens with blaster guns, GATTACA quenched my thirst for a substantial, thoughtful SF movie.

This is an insult to your intelligence! Someone is passing off this rubbish as legitimate entertainment. Go ahead and buy it, suckers!
0812548094|5.0|Stone of Tears is the best book in the best series I have ever read. It is the perfect match to WFR. Everything is done in the way that something actually would be done, by real people living in that setting. A whole new dimension is added to the series, the best start possible to the story arc of the rest of the series.
0800141326|4.0|Plain and simple, this is a good thriller/action/monster movie.  All the whining about this not being like the &quot;original&quot; Godzilla (a man in a phoney suit) has gotten very irritating.  This movie is not perfect, but the criticism of it is not justified.  It has tons of real, believable action, some supsense (unlike most original Godzilla movies), awesome and realistic special effects that blow away ANY other Godzilla movie made by Toho to date, believable and interesting, even funny at times, characters, and the acting IS fairly good, unlike ANY acting in the the &quot;other&quot; G movies.  People just miss the point that this is NOT a Japanese Godzilla movie but a retelling of the basic story, that is, radiation has caused a dangerous mutation in nature that then endangers man, who created the radiation.  It DOES teach that lesson, just like the &quot;original&quot; one did, just not in such a hokey way.  Why anyone would want a fake looking man in a suit over this thoroughly realistic giant lizard is beyond me.  It even has &quot;weight&quot; when it walks.  The ground trembles with each step as it would in real life, unlike the rubber suit Godzilla.  I consider this the Godzilla for grown ups.  It does have some problems, like a week long rain storm (to make the CGI work easier to hide mistakes) and it would have been nice to see the new Godzilla to blow fire, but, those are really the only problems I see in this movie.  I have read on the net that the sequel to this will have a fire-breathing lizard and will fight against Megalon.  Can't wait.  It is worth seeing!
B00005M91K|5.0|I had originally saw this at a friends house, i liked it so much that i bought it when the new edition came to dvd. i watched it on a ps2 and thought it sounded good. today i hooked it up to surround sound and it blew me away!
B000002U82|5.0|This is one of the greatest Rock albums of all time, and is Pink Floyd's best. Floyd's trademark was that of many effects (sometimes known as &quot;Space Rock&quot;) and on this album they perfect their sound. I would venture to say it's a near perfect album. Every time I listen to it, I do so all the way through - the way it is meant to be heard. Though there are some standout, radio-friendly songs (&quot;Time,&quot; &quot;Money&quot;), it is a concept album and definately best heard all the way through. I also recommend listening to it in surround sound or headphones because they really enhance they effects.<br />As the Amazon reviewer said, if you are new to Pink Floyd, this is a good place to start. If you like DSOFTM, I would recommend &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot;
B00005OB0A|5.0|Kylie just seems to improve with age and 13 years after her first album Kylie and her &quot;Loco-Motion&quot; days, she delivers her most entertaining cd to date.  The first single &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; sets the mood for this cd and it's all uphill from there.  &quot;Love At First Sight&quot; is as catchy as any S/A/W song and &quot;Fever&quot; will have you tapping your toes and humming along.  Whereas &quot;Light Years&quot; was more disco camp this cd is poppy and fun with an 80's retro feel.  &quot;Come Into My World&quot;(one of Kylie's STRONGEST vocal performances since &quot;Confide In Me&quot; in 1994) is another winner.  &quot;Fragile&quot;(another winner)is as close to a ballad as you'll get here as this album is 100 percent upbeat....the cd ends with &quot;Burning Up&quot; which combines the &quot;indie&quot; Kylie sound of &quot;Impossible Princess&quot; and the disco sound of &quot;Light Years&quot;.  Just because you live in the good 'ol USA doesn't mean you have to miss out on this Fever!  Buy this import, if you love fun, pop music...YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
