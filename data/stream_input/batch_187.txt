B00QZ67JYS|5|these are great,  much better than the older style
B0095JFWK0|5|Love this hair brush!!!! My daughter hates to have her hair brushed, but with this brush there is no fight anymore!!  I just had surgery and couldn't get a comb or brush through my hair because it was matted. This brush did it!! Highly Recommend this brush to everyone!
B00S48YZ4C|5|Noice. 9/10 would buy again.
B00HGTPMH4|4|Ive been using this before and its was a good quality for any hair types... it helps to restore the nutrients of your hair. only the cons is the product should be lesser price, but still its okay good quality...
B005OU4J6C|5|I'm a medium/light skin color Caucasian and I mix this with two squirts of BOOTS 7 moisturizing and SP15 day cream and slather it on by hand and then egg shaped sponge to get it even.  I find it works all day as a great sunblock.  And my skin is all one tone, which is nice because without this my skin is a million different dots and colors and patches.  I like a unified face!  lol  My last canister lasted over a year and the makeup was good and did not go rancid or separate - super product!
B00KGZS3K8|5|Wonderful product...
B000P9IEN6|5|A1 product and delivery service
B00PYK2UI6|5|Its hard to get the battery compartment open but once u get that taken care of its a wonderful tool. Luv it
B00JPJTQAW|5|Plant Therapy has done it once again with this essential oil. If you are new to the essential oil scene just do yourself a favor and stick with Plan Therapy because they are consistently great, all of their oils go through 3rd party testing and they always pass with flying colors. Best of all, their prices are definitely some of the best I've ever seen.<br /><br />Now that I have that off my chest, lets talk about coffee.<br /><br />I am a coffee addict. I love everything about it but most of all I love the smell. For the past couple years I have been on a quest to find a way to make my house smell perpetually like coffee without having a pot going 24/7. I've tried candles, waxes, and essential oils and all of them have smelled like coffee but had some kind of harshness that was completely unpleasing. I had almost given up until I ran across a way for me to get a discounted bottle from Plant therapy as long as I agreed to test it and leave an honest review. So I figured what the heck, I had already wasted a good amount of money on my quest and Plant Therapy is always on top of their game.<br /><br />Man am I elated. This stuff smells PERFECTLY like coffee. I'm ashamed of myself for not checking out plant therapy in the first place since they are my favorite essential oil makers. I just didn't know they made any.<br /><br />Now coffee essential oil is supposedly good for bug bites and other uses but for me its aromatic only. Why waste my little bottle of coffee oil on a bug bite when I have tons of tea tree oil? But if thats what you want it for, to each their own.<br /><br />So if you are looking for the perfect coffee smell, look no further!
B00X8OK4DS|5|best razor ever but found it cheaper at Costco
B0029VGE8U|5|I have always liked this companys products just wished they would offer more affordable pricesd items samples will enjoy the item though
B0084A5S6O|5|I love the full coverage this item provides without looking like you plastered your face with makeup. Looks natural.
B00D3M0CRS|5|Great product leaves skin so soft.
B000QYEK88|4|This is a good DE razor, meets my needs. Just one thing as you shave since it has a slick top it tends to get dried out and the blade does not flow smoothly. Other than that it does fine.
B00ANH56BS|4|I sent this as a gift to someone,so I have never used this item before ,I hope they liked it!
B009PIJLMQ|5|WIFE LOVES IT
B004ND6DCO|5|I've been using cream on my face since little on following the advice of my Mother.  The cream I loved the best was made by Coty - an Advanced Vitamin and Mineral Cream.  Coty, however, discontinued making this product, so I began searching for another of comparable quality.  Finally, after 15+ years of trying various creams, I have discovered it in this product.  Excellent texture and creamy feel.  Leaves my face feeling refreshed and supple.
B007XTGR62|5|Love it
B006F98EIA|5|Great
B00479FP4Q|5|I bought these years ago to travel with but now use them every day.  Very convenient and better than a wash cloth.
B000P276TQ|4|Patience pays off!<br /><br />I have been hunting for the perfect summer tea for me for an oolong time and so many times I've been let down. The Elizabeth Arden teas are good, not great imo. I wanted great.<br /><br />Then comes along Th&eacute; Rouge (Red Tea). Encouraged by a flurry of reviews & a forum post about figs elsewhere online, I bought it blind. I'm a spice & woods lover and I adore Bvlgari Omnia, so the buy was easy.<br /><br />It's an oriental lite with rooibos &  yunnan teas, sweetened by fig. Th&eacute; Rouge is right up my alley. Summer fresh yet seasonless. Complex & deep yet light & airy. Unique & non-cliche. And it's pretty cheap! Lasting power is as expected for an EdC.
B0089FEFJU|4|Love this sent!
B00H4W38JC|2|The color doesn´t last for more tan 1 week.
B0032039K8|2|Way lighter than  the one my wife got in a store(they don't carry it anymore,of course).
B005EVOLI2|4|I have been using the product for two weeks so far and it seems to be a nice moisturizer with a good cucumber smell. The one strange aspect of my experience is that after spraying it on my face and waiting for it to dry, before applying lotion, it really tightens my pores and seems to dry me up at times. However, I am attributing this to the fact I am using some acne medication that has dried my skin out in the past.
B00J2AP842|5|i recieved this razor from Gillette and it is by far the best razor that I have ever used. In the past I used the earlier versions of the fusion razors and was very satisfied with them.  The Gusion proflide silvertouch razor with flexball provides the smoothest shave that I can remember having and I have been shaving for over 40 years.  The blades and lubristrip are more comfortable, than earlier versions. This is an outstanding upgrade to what was an excellent shaving product.
B00J2APR98|1|The cost of refill cartridges is OUTRAGEOUS!  $4+ for one cartridge?  No thanks!  Go with a double edged razor and pay just 10¢ a blade if you know where to buy.  Don't want to go the safety razor route?  Look for a Dorco system with $1 cartridges.
B000GF7BZG|5|Keeps your face soft and free of wrinkles
B00AIDDKXI|5|Love this...! Bronzer is darkening
B0083I2DU6|3|Works, but may have a negative side affect or could just be me.
B00R31J4H4|5|I'm in my mid 30s and have had hormone related cystic acne issues since my mid 20s. I've always used benzoyl/salyctic acid products and find them largely inneffective. Retin A and antibiotics only did so much, and the Retin A was extremely irritating. This last menstrual cycle killed me. Cystic bumps everywhere. I researched alternate solutions and found this. Two days of using the soap and salve have made an enormous difference. The spots are still red, but flat and most non hormonal related acne was eradicated.  The difference is really miraculous....and my skin feels soft as a babys bottom. Recommended. I was very surprised that is was effective on my cystic acne. Nothing else has ever touched it. The ointment does smell like burnt matches or burned out tire rubber...but a temporary inconvenience for sure.
B001ES6Y4S|5|Smells good and pretty.  Love how it moisturizes.
B000CJPFW2|5|Paul Mitchell Shampoo One is extremely causative and less expensive here than what it retails for in Sephora. Good Deal.
B00RUJNUNI|1|I would have given this no stars but I couldn't right a review unless I at least chose one! I really don't understand why something like this could tell all this crap about how it can transform your wrinkles into smooth skin! It should be against the law to be able to lie about this product. SO BUYER BEWARE DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY IT IS ALL A LIE!
B001ECQ5DO|5|We think this one of the finest hair-care products around.  I ordered some sent to my wife and some to her best friend.  Arrived way before promise date.
B006ZBP8NM|5|I like it. Pores look smaller the day after but be sure to read direction so as to not burn your skin.
B00VSF4T26|1|worst product
B0018S8NNE|4|I've been using this product for almost 2 months now and I can honestly say I noticed a difference within 2 weeks. My under eyes are not as puffy. They seem younger and brighter and tighter. I'm almost 30 years old and I heard at my age it is best to start introducing retinal products to my skin to help slow down the aging process. I will be ordering this product again. I am definitely pleased with my results.
B00AG4QCAM|1|I was so excited to try this pulsar and I'm just disappointed after using it for 2 times don't waste your money !
B001K1GP7A|4|This is my second one and it works great.
B006ZOEU42|1|I read all the reviews before ordering, some warning about pain and others saying it wasn't too bad. I have a pretty high pain tolerance so I wasn't too concerned. But all I can say is OUCH.  It feels like tiny needles rolling across your skin, and it didn't work as well as I hoped, either. The first few times, I figured maybe that was just because I hadn't gotten the hang of it yet. Because some of the videos I watched said in time you get used to it and it doesn't hurt anymore, I continued to try it day after day after day, eyes watering, wincing the whole way through it. FInally I realized my little tiny itsy-bitsy face shaver did a fine job, as does any depilatory or bleach - and with no pain. If anyone wants mine, I'll be happy to send you this little instrument of torture for free.
B000067E30|4|I've heard a lot about them on television and on the internet, but I never gave them a try.  I'm one of those people who thinks that ALL producers simply come up with some new gimik to steal my hard earned money. <br /> <br />I finally met someone (with a great smile) that used them and she recommended them to me.  Gave really high reviews about them.  So, I decided to give them a try (still skeptical though.  Maybe she had a great smile to begin with). <br /> <br />I guess I should have taken some pictures to be sure, but personally I didn't notice much difference.  They were a bit whiter I think, but that could have been the lighting, or my imagination. <br /> <br />When I was done with the product, I still wasn't satisfied until I started getting compliments from all sorts of people.  People were asking me what I did, because my teeth looked really white.  Still skeptical, I ignored the first 4 people, but over 10 people can't be wrong.  Bottom line, the product does work, the \\"constant shade\\" of my teeth was all in my head and came from inspecting them every day. <br /> <br />PROS: <br />Product works.  Even though I skipped a couple days, still seemed to work.  Just don't inspect them so much every day, because since the difference is gradual, you won't notice much. <br /> <br />CONS: <br />The stupid strips are TOO SHORT.  What was crest thinking? I guess I just have to control my smile so that it's not too wide, because now I notice how yellow my back teeth are.  Hey, I may buy 2 boxes next time and try overlapping strips. :D <br /> <br />Does leave your gums and teeth a bit sensitive if you apply to strips too much on the gums. <br /> <br />Takes a bit of getting used to, no doubt.
B00BAZOXDE|5|parfait
B000C1UDPO|1|Only 1 out of 4 smelled good. The packaging and containers are neat though. My husband actually thought I bought him cigars for Chritmas.
B0016P8XZC|4|I do like it as I think I'm seeing nail growth. But in the beginning I was not liking it because I saw my nails being very fragile and broken like every  day.I'm using a nail thickener underneath.
B0094DH1RE|3|They are okay for the price I guess. Not much longer than my actual eyelashes though. They are very fragile so I don't think they are really reusable.
B00GMPTTJA|5|very good.
B000NPOYF4|5|You will love this! It has a real lavendar smell, because it is made with lavendar essential oils, so unlike all of those other products that say \\"lavendar\\" this is the real deal!!
B00CDDUY6M|5|love this
B004MKFY3W|1|Dont work at all.
B00AZBWPSO|5|These are really cute. They didnt stay on my nails that well, but its hard to get something that does.
B001GNBW0W|5|I have long eye lashes and always have trouble finding the perfect mascara. I am extremely sad Max Factor is no longer making them. The 2000 Calorie is the 'perfect' mascara and I even get comments on the streets. Please don't stop making them!!!
B009WCLNZI|5|I'm never going to use that red thingy, but it doesn't matter.  This is a great deal for all the other implements.  I bought two already, and am soon going to buy another.  The cuticle clippers and cuticle trimmer on the implement seem to both be very sharp.  Careful you don't overdo pushing back your cuticles when you gleefully set to work with this set like I did.
B00H7KTEZ8|5|Great product!
B0058E3XJI|3|Since I purchased this for my daughter, i gave it three stars.  She uses it and apparently likes it because she hasn't stated differently.
B005CK3GIQ|5|I like this item so far, it starts working great after the first wash! I have lost a lot of hair since surgery, and I am starting to tell that my hair is looking healthier and fuller!
B000HRVIMU|5|This is a great product for the prevention of razor bumps. I used to buy it regularly at WalMart but they discontinued it. It's a great product and it's a shame it's so hard to get.
B007IFY254|5|These work great as boot clips!
B000VPDJOI|5|This is hair gel that is easy to use, not sticky and has a nice hold for my very short, very thick hair. I rub in a small amount after shampooing and style. The gel holds the shape and leaves a shine. There is no flaking and if I just wet my hair in the morning, the gel again holds the shape without reapplication.
B008ZGTDFY|2|It was just ok, I like the other products in the line better.
B00006RVJ3|4|If you just want a loose style.  It's easy and fast.  It came with a bigger brush head than my last one, but I just switched out from the old one.  It was compatable with new curler.
B001E6P6MQ|5|I have dry skin and dry scalp. For years, dandruff has been a problem, especially in the dry dry winters. I've tried Head & Shoulder, but I didn't like the scents, too slippery and too much suds, plus, it felt like as soon as I stop using it for few days, hair dandruffs came back, and tripled. Anyways, so, I've decided to try this after reading the glorious review on Amazon...and yep, once again, Amazon reviewers were right!<br /><br />So, not to repeat other reviews-- Yes, it really works! I can see improvements after the first wash, and it takes appx 3 uses to rid all hair dandruffs (I'm using Nature's Gate's tea tree conditioner too) . It is very light, and leaves hair clean and soft. I want to mention its smell and consistency is comparable to Aveda's Rosemary Mint. They don't smell exactly the same, but it's got the similar earth herbal smell, washes off easily, and it's so much more economical compare to Aveda. Love it!
B000TGEUHY|5|excelent
B00BB8ZIQQ|2|I've been a fan of heated curlers for most of my adult life, and 3 of the 4 sets of curlers I've owned were Remington.  This, in theory should be the best, but it is most definitely not.  Why?  Because the rods that heat the curlers and clips get hot enough to melt the clips.  The curlers are therefore a bit hot to handle, even for people like myself, who have high tolerance for heat.  But to make matters worse, the plastic on the edges of the clips melts onto the heating bars.  I can't quite figure why this happens with only some of the curlers and not all.  But I have to cool the unit down completely, then take a kitchen knife to scrape off the red plastic.  If I use it long enough I'll either have red tipped hair or all the clips will be 'clipped' and short enough they won't continue to melt.<br /><br />What I like about it: It heats up in 90 seconds (perhaps that fast heating is why it also melts in 90 seconds).  If Remington would solve the 'overheating' problem, this would be a great appliance.
B000C1W5AA|5|I have been wearing this for years. Great product and it smells amazing!
B000Q6SU3C|5|The new braun pulsonic shaver is a marvelous product and has more than lived up to my expectations.  the many small irritations from previous models have all been eliminated.  My complaint is that the day after I bought it, I received a $50.00 coupn in the mail
B003HUNEZI|5|Wonderfully refreshing scent!
B00AZ0FJB0|5|Good variety, fast shipping. The only thing is that I was expecting the heart shaped studs (as shown in pic) but I got a different shape instead. Other than that, Im very happy with my purchase.
B005EFNXBY|5|i bought this brush for my 5 year daughter who has very long hair and hates when I brush it.  I was hoping the brush would be friendlier to her hair then the current brush we have and it certainly is.  My daughter says it doesn't even feel like I'm brushing her hair.  I used to really have to pull through some big staticy knots in her hair but now hair time is much easier.  I recommend this brush to anyone with long straight hair.
B004O2J5EM|3|Its ok, you can see the clippers starting to loosen up after a while and the cuts are'nt the most precise in the world, but it serves its basic purpose, just ond expect any frills wit this kit.
B009WI0VFK|5|It's dark, very red and looks good on my skin tone. I'm pale with yellow undertones.
B0077PLNNE|3|good
B000158OI4|1|Didn't like it.
B001ABLKK2|5|I'm glad i found this product. Before I purchased this product, I watched videos/reviews on YouTube and read some reviews regarding this. This totally changes my face because when in just one try, I can feel that my face becomes so smooth. In addition, as I rinse my face, I see that it brightens my face and adds glow to my face. It does not irritate my face and I do not get breakouts. I put this product on my dry face and let it sit for about 15-30 seconds, then rub it gently until I can see and feel the dead skin cells. After that, I rinse it with warm water thoroughly and begin to put my facial cleanser. I use the Beauty Facial Extreme Vitamin C cleanser because it got five star reviews and begin to love this product along with this Cure Natural Aqua Gel. I will totally repurchase this product. Give it a try and you will totally love  this.
B008HOFLWS|1|Very confused sellers pls do not purchase
B003U83I5I|5|I've been on the hunt for a good concealer that will not only brighten under my eyes and my eyelids, but will also give me that extra lil' kick. I've wasted hours of my life researching and I've wasted even more money that I'd ever care to know trying to find the perfect concealer by way of giving every one a fair chance. It got to the point that I just started buying any/all that were recommended to me in department stores because it's all about a numbers game, right? I dunno. But what I do know is that winter/spring/summer/fall...hot/cold/snowy/balmy...this concealer is all I need. It doesn't make my lids oily. It doesn't make me feel like I have to check on it. It's reliable. It brightens me and I swear I bought it over a year ago and I don't have to buy a new one any time soon...the thing is still half full!!! During these hot summer months, I can just use this around my eyes and I'm set to go. I love this concealer and can't say enough about it. It's become like trusted friend.
B0009QZXXE|4|This is a great light-weight gel that isn't as much for hold in styling, as it is intended to tame curls into shape so they don't frizz out (hence, the name of the product). My husband borrowed some one day and wasn't pleased with it, but he's not the intended audience. I use it on a daily basis and enjoy the low price and great results.
B004D2C50Y|3|Have very fine, colored hair.  I love this shampoo.  It does not weigh my hair down.  My hair is looking very healthy.  The cap wasn't screwed on tightly enough, so product leaked out during delivery -- very messy.
B004SZU84Q|5|This file works great and is a life saver for those of you that have dry problem feet.  I ordered 6 of these so they will last me forever!  One day it is on the market and the next day it is gone so I am hoarding!  I use this once a week standing in the shower - dry.  I have even sent one to family members.  It works well!  I first saw them on Good Day America and decided to try it out.  The best thing is you can do the whole side of you foot in one swoop as well as the heel area....resulting in very soft feet. Go ahead and indulge in this one!
B001XUHFJU|5|Always leaves hair feeling soft and moisturized..plus smells great.<br /><br />The big bottle is a great value and you can refill your small squeeze bottles using the pump on the large bottle.
B002XAUH2G|5|Lovely little massage kit.  They smell great and glide on smoothly with a nice feel and finish.  Just like a professional massage.  :)
B0015K9BXQ|4|Bottom line: I've used mine for 1.5 yrs to maintain my buzz cut with a trim every 2 weeks or so. Just now it seems my power brick died, and I don't mind buying another for $25 on Amazon.     One downside that I find quite annoying is that it doesn't work at all while plugged in. Why the heck is that? So if you're in a pinch and the battery is dead, you can't plug it in and use it. You have to wait until it's charged.     I was also hoping they'd have upgraded the model in the past 1.5 yrs, but apparently now.
B0034MZGCS|5|I use this in baths and wraps to sooth aching muscles. Good for feet after a long day.
B00LNOV8JO|5|This is a great product. I've been using it for a week and my skin already feels smoother and firmer. It is not at all greasy. The smell is very pleasant compared to other rose hip oils I have tried.
B009YE6JSU|5|satisfied.
B000H6QLNM|5|perfume smells good and stays in the body for long ... I love it. Although it must be used sparingly because the smell is very strong and can be cloying ...
B009JVVRK8|1|I ordered this after having my nails painted with it by my manicurist.  I received it and it is suuuuppper runny, not at all the consistency of the same polish at the salon.  It was thin and runny and the seal was broken, which made me wonder if it had been watered down or was a second quality. Seller stopped responding when I asked for a replacement.<br />Order it from someone else, that would be my recommendation!
B00MHVHPBM|1|Very streaky.
B0002DTV0K|5|Love it, makes your skin very soft.
B00A51P1VC|5|bought this for my daughter I was worried because she is very selective on her brushes since she is a hair stylist and she just love them.
B002JV24EI|1|Well, I believe the tubes I received today have been filled with another product. I have been using the Skinceutical skin care line for 3 years now and the one I received is not the same texture, feel or scent of the Skinceuticals eye complex cream I have been using. This is definitely a knock-off and I am extremely disappointed. When I figure out the scent of the product it was filled with I will share with the consumer.  I am very disappointed that this person seems to be selling knock off Skinceutical lotions.<br />Also, just like the other reviews, my tubes are half filled which would make sense that they are being filled with another product and not being filled fully.<br />I should ask for my money back and buy from another seller.
B00CTAMCI2|2|A great perfume, a great smell lasting nearly all the working hours.<br />A was afraid that I would not get it on time. But the seller did a wonderful job... Thanks keep on doing the good job.
B00E56I6M4|5|Love the many colors that get reflected in this polish. Use it for pedicures all year long but especially love it for summer.  It goes with everything.
B004ZD2M6I|5|Very easy to use, microdermabrasion system leaves my skin feeling soft and glowing.  I'm very happy to with this product.
B001UGF6U2|4|Cleans well left my hair very smooth, does have a very strong perfume smell.
B00VAY88S6|5|I’ve been using this for a couple weeks now and there is a noticeable change in my skin. I tend to break out when I get stressed, and also suffer from dry skin in some areas. Few products work for both issues, but this has been working for me so far. I was worried using an oil would make me more prone to breakouts, but the tone and feel of my skin has definitely improved. Best of all no breakouts! I use a few drops in the morning and night and my skin feels hydrated and my complexion is now smooth and glowing, I am extremely satisfied with this product, and wouldn’t hesitate to repurchase.
B00008BFXK|1|The product, when it works, seems like a miracle, as at those times, it is doing a very good job and that's why many dentists do recommend it.  However, please read through many reviews and you will read about the same experience that I have had, namely, that they wear out (specifically, the battery won't hold its charge) so you have to buy a whole new unit after the very limited-time warranty expires.  It would be so very easy to manufacture these units in a battery-replaceable fashion.  Readers should also pay VERY close attention to the date of the review.  If the review is a rave review and is within the last few weeks or months, just wait .... till the battery fails.  Readers should also pay close attention to the very large number of \\"new models\\" that keep coming out.  I would feel better if they made ONE model that consistently performed well, rather than adding this or that needless bell or whistle.  Also when the new model comes out, all of the reviews from the previous almost-identical product become unsearchable and the whole cycle starts from scratch again. Someone buys one and two weeks later they put up a five star review.  Then more people buy them.  Then, a few months later, people start having a different experience.  Time to introduce yet another new model!  Thus cleaning the slate with all the bad reviews missing.
B00Q7KZO30|2|I'm not crasy aboug this eye cream.  First of all, it's pretty watery/thin, not rich the way I think a cream should be. It's more like a lotion (but even then it's pretty thin).  Also, it has an unpleasant smell.  On the plus side, it has a pump, which keeps it cleaner (I'm not a fan of having to stick a finger in a pot of eye cream).  I'll go back to Aveena.
B00PYK2UI6|5|This is such a great set to gift to others and even yourself! First off I love how this set is packaged and sealed keeping the set protected and clean. The brushes are soft so using them on my face and other areas of my face is perfect and does not scratch my face. The stone to scrub the dead skin off of my feet is the perfect size, helps get in to the small areas of my feet and toes. The motor is not too fast or too slow, the speed is just perfect to get the dead skin off and also exfoliate my face. The handle is wide enough to hold with easy and maneuver. This is definitely a spa in a box and I highly recommend everyone to have this set in your bathroom, great using this during your showers or long relaxing bathes.
B00U1NREHI|5|The smell is as yummy as it's name ( I got the warm vanilla sugar; scent reminds me of ginger snaps!)! Crème Brûlée is worth every cent. Creamy, not heavy, provides great moisture, nourishing my hair - soaks right in. Have had this product for only 2 weeks, used for a twist out with water and Indie Ultra 10x and got the best results ever - soft but well-defined twists with great sheen, with very little frizz (a definite thumbs up, because frizz and my hair have been well acquainted! LOL). So glad I found out about KeraVada's products!
B000GAT6JU|5|seamless transaction. great price.
B002ZFTES2|5|This one is really nice too! I have only used it on my hands though. Smells real good. All of their products do.
B00JRCFKR0|5|Been using this a whole year now! Im 63 years old! I just use this at night id all Then in daytime i dont use nothing I get so many  complement s Saying my skin looks youthfull!! i use nozema to by the way!!! Between zoxema. & this Making my skin very nice  No pimples. Zoxema helps that! This is small Thats why i only use it at night!! It takes 3 months for your face to know ths diffrence!! I jusy bought more! Love it!
B00197623M|5|Bought this brush in October 2012 because I needed a new one. But I wanted a durable, GOOD brush, not one that would give out in a year or so. This Denman model is IT.  I love it! Plus it feels good against my scalp after I wash and brush my hair. Yay!

Also neutralizes free radicals<br />* Phenols: antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, powerful against fungus and bacteria, activates blood circulation and activates Vitamin C<br />* Triterpens: restructure cells, is anti-inflammatory and slows down cell aging<br />* Squalene: suggested to prevent against skin cancer<br /><br />I really liked the Argan Oil. I noticed a difference in my skin, hair and nails almost immediately. It is the perfect moisturizer and it's great at smoothing things out.<br /><br />Another wonderful product from Eden Allure is the Beauty Bar which is available in Grapefruit or Lavender.<br /><br />I almost felt like I was washing myself with pure oil. Some may not like that idea, but when you have extremely dry, sensitive skin, it's amazing when you find something that cleans you and leaves you feeling fresh instead of dry and flaky. I love this stuff!
B002E32CHA|1|Within a day or two my whole face was COVERED in little acne bumps. Forehead especially, but basically this stuff made my entire face have the texture of a basketball. Definitely did not make my face smooth. Will not buy again.
B001TDL4AW|1|*i bought this product for Brazilian waxing<br /><br /> I decided one day that I don't want to pay anyone for my Brazilian waxes anymore and that it was simple enough to myself. WRONG. I've done bikini waxing using soft wax on myself before and have used hard wax on others (I'm a licensed esthetician)<br /><br />With all of my experience and training, I thought it wouldn't be a big deal to try and do my own. It was horrible. Not only did it take forever (15min total with varying intervals) for the wax to heat to a consistency to be applied, but it wouldn't go on smoothly. Then when I attempted to pull the wax, it broke off. Long story short, I had to use oil, scissors, a mirror and my mom to get the wax off.<br /><br />Never again. I DO NOT recommend.
B0015TIFV6|5|Great
B000B6T8X8|4|I like it a lot.  Really does work to keep the feet warm on our cold concrete slab of a floor.  Much more comfortable than the space heater I have been using for three years.<br /><br />Pro:  Quiet, low power ~100W operation.  More effective/comfortable than a space heater under the desk.<br /><br />Con:  It smelled a bit the first day of use.  It comes coated with what I assume is mold release compound which makes it rather slippery.  Tried scrubbing down mat with industrial strength cleaner, then rinsing well with water (unplug and let dry thoroughly before use), which helped reduce only some of the slickness.  Compound makes the soles of my shoes squeak when I walk around the office.  Mat slips around under desk so am still pondering how best to anchor the mat.<br /><br />For this item, under Customer Questions & Answers...  The answer is wrong, it does not come with a high/low switch or adjustable temperature controller.  It just has an on/off switch and the built-in (non-adjustable) temperature controller.<br /><br />Q: Is the &#34;switch&#34; mentioned in the title a simple on/off switch or a high/low temperature switch similar to the one found under &#34;Customers Also Viewed:&#34;<br />A:<br />I'm not sure which mat you are looking at in the &#34;Customers also viewed&#34; but this mat includes an adjustable temperature controller.
B002ZNJU06|4|great color lots of complements
B00CZ9ZT0K|1|It died after only 2.5 months due to battery failure and is not returnable to Amazon
B00GSASKWQ|5|Great
B005IR3GUQ|1|the hair in this brush fall out constantly and get stuck to my face every time I use it. This brush is inexpensive, but invest in a good quality stippling brush
B004CDA3VW|5|Addicted to these toothbrushes! I thought I must be crazy ordering special toothbrushes online but it is totally worth it. Love Love Love them, The black bristles are so cool and different. They make me happy.
B00ATS24EI|5|Love this product!  It's the first facial peel that I have felt actually works for me.  After using this then using the facial creams my face feels the smoothest ever.  I highly recommend it!
B001DEYP8K|2|I have been a blade shaver for years.  I had only used rotary shavers in the past, and had bad experiences with quality of cut.  So, I decided to try this Remington model.  First, the shave is excellent.  In less than 10 minutes, I have a very smooth shave.  With just a few passes (gentle, circular motion) it rivaled what a blade did.  I did have to work on my neck some with it, but I have to do that with a blade, too.    I noticed from the start that the pivot head pivots very easily and gets looser with use.  The foil covers must be removed for cleaning daily.  After two months, the plastic housing for the covers broke apart when I took them off to clean the razor.    In the end, this would be a great razor to see if foil shaving is for you, but as the saying goes, you get what you pay for.
B00OL9OGZG|1|My screen was cracked.
B00N4JC0V6|4|They get the job done.
B002Z7CMK2|4|Love this fragrance. This was a bargain compared to department store pricing.
B007SZCG0C|5|I have long silky hair. Recently, I began to notice that my hair started falling out, more and more hair left on the comb, on the bathroom floor, on the clothes, in the bathtub, everywhere I go! I was desperate!<br />I was just lucky enough to try Hair Surge Shampoo before I spent hundreds of dollars on other products that may be ineffective. I am so happy with my purchase. After just a week of everyday application I already can see that my hair became stronger, hair loss decreased significantly, there is less hair on a comb, which means that more hair left on my head after brushing. Too early to talk about the growth of new hair, but I can confidently assert that the use of this shampoo significantly reduced hair loss.<br />Hair looks strong, silky and healthy.<br />Shampoo smells good, it is economical, just two clicks on the dosing head is enough for me, even though the fact that I have long hair.<br />A great remedy for those who lose their hair.<br /><br />I’ll keep you guys updated on my progress.
B00NK65R5O|2|Ok..haven't noticed much difference. Dissapointed after the supposed high reviews.
B00M9F1SWS|5|Great buy.  I went to the retail stores for this cologne and it retailed for $120.
B00JG0R1B6|5|I live by this stuff, keeps acne, redness, and face dryness in check. 6 pumps before bed, i see the difference the morning after. I only with it wasn't so whitening on the skin.
B00AC3G0ZY|4|Bought this from Sun Tan City (it was on sale for $14.99 only reason I bought there) anyhow, I just used it for the first time and my skin is so silky smooth it's amazing. Scent is tropical and delicious, light lather(hence the tiny bubbles title) so I suspect that is one of its properties that will be tan preserving. Only reason I gave 4 stars is because I've only used it once... But I trust the product as it is a designer skin product. I would recommend this to any tanner, especially good for summer to keep moisturized and preserve your glow!
B00DVSELOO|5|I love this product.  Was very skeptical as to the quality but this is just as if not more amazing than some of my professional products that you cannot buy over the counter.
B00KK62714|1|I am saddened to write this review. I had very high hopes for this product,  all reviews taken into consideration & an Amazon best seller! There are pros....BUT serious cons.<br />Pros: subtle scent, not overwhelming; & did make smoother skin in about a week.<br />Cons: after week 2, no further results; worst of all it made me break out in head to toe HOT, itchy, fire-like, random hives. A week and a half of searching for allergen triggers-mind you I am not a person that has ever had allergies over seasonal/occasional. And I have never had hives. With the help of my practitioner, we finally deduced it down to the application of this product. I have been on several prescribed medications over this past week for hives (urticaria) ...and prednisone,  benedryl and no avail. I got the hives to go away, before I figured this out, and then boom 2 days later I applied this product again, and hives...nearly instantly, all over the application areas.<br />Please be advised when purchasing, even for folks who have never had these issues, as I am new to hives; I wouldn't wish this misery on a worst enemy! BE AWARE of ingredients, any reactions or sensitivities you may have....and use in an inconspicuous area and have benedryl cream ready. I am so happy some have found a great product here, however, after 3 weeks of continued use, sadly I tossed nearly 3/4 a jar out. NOT worth it to me to continue suffering with this.
B004LWAJB8|5|I love this little palette and I had heard about it from a Beauty Guru on YouTube. Great palette with fun colors!
B001XZF8JY|5|Great
B000FP63M4|1|I bought this product as a cheaper alternative to replacement if my electric shaver, but what the seller does not tell you is that replacement requires soldering, which the average person is not set up to do. All-in-all the product is misleading in its advertisement and I would discourage anyone from buying it.
B000EZU948|5|[[ASIN:B000EZU948 HABA SQ Squalane Moisturizer (Purified Squalene) - 30ml]] Very pleased with this product. It goes on smoothly and dries completely without leaving your face feeling like there is nothing on it at all. I have noticed that the lines around my eyes have faded and that my skin is much smoother. This is a very reasonably priced product compared to all of the higher priced products that indicate they disolve wrinkles and age spots.
B000ICRDSW|5|I use this twice daily and I can really see a big difference.  I would tell anyone to purchase it and see the results themselves. I love the way it will lift up the brow line also.
B0089MUOOS|5|Within the first day I was already seeing great results! I've tried many different things to clear the acne up and this by far is the best product out there! The transformation has been amazing and I can't wait to get my hands on my second bottle!
B001V9OWNU|4|The sulfur has so far seemed to work. The chiggers haven't been much of a problem since we started to use the sulfur
B003ZP5GFQ|3|This is satifsfactory, though not superior as I would have expected.  Hurts somewhat, but not significant.  A useful tool if nothing else works.
B00D62LDNW|4|Nice
B00CC14S5S|3|When I purchased colored liners I generally expect them to be color rich. These are not. I have to apply multiple coats in order for my eyes to actually look lined. The colors are beautiful once I get them to show up well, but I was a little disappointed at the added time it takes to use these.
B003NV9R2U|4|Got it on time<br />Love the smell.!!!!!<br />(Wish the scent could have been a bit stronger)........<br />Will buy it again.
B001E9P87G|2|fair
B00KECQ8BY|3|I got these because I heard remineralization was good for your teeth after whitening, but I cannot really tell if anything is happening. My teeth do not really burn after whitening, but they are sensitive to cold. After using 2 of the 8 syringes, I cannot really tell any difference in the sensitivity of my teeth, which is a bit of a let-down since I had such high hopes after reading some other reviews.
B009WI3RZQ|2|Ok. While this is a fairly good idea... it's totally not worth $7. A normal translucent powder, pressed powder, or loose powder applied with a small brush would suffice. Also, it's SPARKLY. What? No! The whole point of wearing concealer is to cover any imperfections in an area, not to draw attention to it!<br /><br />Also the brush is poopy.
B003US5XNI|5|I must wear sunscreen bc I get spots very easy.  This is sunscreen is amazing. Feels great when u put it on and smells good too.  It's worth the price.  It has worked better than obagi and most dermatologists and plastic surgeons believe in obagi 100%.  I love this product.
B001VEK1HQ|5|great price
B002RO5ZHK|5|Very good product I have been suffering from hip pain and with these in my shoes I find the hip pain is lessend
B0029OSN4U|1|Don't waste your money. I have been using the tria laser for 7 months. I used it on my legs and bikini area. I have fair skin and dark hair. I used it every two weeks like instructed but after 5 months with no results I started using it every time I shaved, now I am trying every other day. Guess what still very little to no result. The pain is terrible I have to use it on 2 sometimes I try 3 but I can't stand it. Let me put it this way... my whole back is tattooed, my wrist and my ankles and feet, I have sat 4 straight hours with a tattoo needle pounding at my flesh that I could stand this laser I can't. My husband asked \\"How bad can it be?\\" so I  zapped him on his arm with it one day on high and it left a circle burn on him ( he didn't didn't shave first ) I really thought the safety feature wouldn't let zap him, but it did and he got burned. I am now trying it with a skin numbing spray I used to use when I waxed, it still hurts. I would put the money your going to spend on this as a down payment on professional electrolysis.
B00ZU3C2BM|5|I had ordered this toe nail nipper for my mom’s birthday. My mom is a housewife and don’t get much time to go out after her daily household work and pamper herself with some manicure or pedicure. So for her surprise I gifted this one and she is totally happy with the product. With the product I could even do different nail arts.
B004SUHGM8|5|I have been using the DHC Mild Soap for several years.  I use it daily with the face brush.  I keep it in the shower in the large plastic case.<br />The bar I bought before this one, I put the date I started using it.  It lasted me one year and 3 months!  That's with everyday use.<br />My skin looks and feels great.  I highly recommended this soap and will continue making it a part of my daily routine.
B002SZVNMY|5|Very fast shipping! Just as described! Thanks!
B001646U94|5|Light and creamy, just wish it had more SPF and perhaps a hint of a tint. I have been unable to find it at the local chain pharmacy.
B00HE67BC8|5|So far this has been great.  It diffuses for 10 hours which is so convenient!  I do love this diffuser, but I originally gave it 2 stars after purchasing 2 just like it that quit working (one after a few months and one after a few days.)  My husband and I each have one on our night stands and we diffuse all night.  I'm trusting this one will keep working....
B00W69JLFI|5|its really amazing product
B00KXHI3G8|4|It was exactly as described. The service was quick. Pleased with it.
B00BNWOBH2|5|I love this balm!  It's great for dry skin and fine lines!
B000V1QTBM|5|really nice is makes my hair soft and shiny.
B001EDHAU0|5|I had nearly run out of primer that I bought from Sephora for far too much money.  So I checked here and carefully looked at the reviews, this seemed to hit all my requirements and then some:  it had to work, it did not need to be expensive, and it had to smell nice or at least not have a funny smell.  In addition, this has sun screen which is a sensible addition, why don't they all do that?  The product works extremely well, just as well as any of the far pricier primers I've used.
B001FB5OAO|5|I have found these in certain stores for up to $6 each, so I was glad to find them for a bit cheaper in a 6-pack. I am allergic to aluminum, so can't use most deodorants. This one works great and I like the faint smell of apricot too. My hubby has asthma, so can't have scents around, however this is light enough that it doesn't bother him. It is a deodorant, but not an anti-perspirant. Works great for me though!
B0062GZB9G|4|Ok, let's start off by saying it REALLY does lasts 24hrs! I'm still deciding if thats good or bad. I do love that it doesn't weight down my eyelashes after curling them, but if you're not carful it clumps up....BIG TIME! However, I do LOVE how long and full my eyelashes look! I just wish it wasn't so clumpy!
B0000AFUTI|3|I purchased this mirror thinking it would be the exact same mirror I purchased a few years ago.  The quality was not the same.  I noticed the side hinges on the new mirror were looser.  The mirror barely holds it's position.  It is also a lot lighter than the older version.  Other than being cheeply made, it does do the job, mirror is not distorted and folds nicely for travel.
B0018QE3ZS|1|Buyer beware when purchasing makeup through Amazon.  I purchased a 3-pack of this mascara, as it was more cost-effective, and only one showed up!...for the price of $18.00.  Amazon graciously refunded me 2/3 of what I paid, however it should have been the full amount.  I've been using this mascara for years, so am very aware of what I'm going to get.  I immediately noticed the tube sent to me was not filled completely filled, so this product lasted me about a week. Instead of the normal month.  Never purchasing mascara from Amazon again, as it can't be trusted.
B000JNQSIQ|5|This has worked great so far and I am 3 cuts in.  The hair is removed with great precision and the color coordinated levels of cut make this product very easy to use.  The only tough parts are cutting the sides and the back.  The area around the ears is a little tough to get.  My wife just helps out with that and there is no issue after that.  This is a great product for the price.  The razor is about the same price as only 2 haircuts!
B00022DP08|3|I like this eye brown product but the color was a little darker than I expected. And the brushes are very small. Would have preferred a longer brush rather than the two tiny brushes.
B0009MFUPO|5|The price is excellent  and the product is excellent and the service is first rate I don't have to go and look for the bladea
B003FBG88E|5|I like it
B002CSPKSU|5|I've used exposed for a few months, and it out-performs Murad, and of course proactiv.<br /><br />If you follow the steps religiously, including the weird step where you let your skin air dry instead of pat dry, it works wonders. It also smells unbelievable!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this if you can afford it!
B0016L0VHE|1|It may be a great product but I did not intend to order this product.  They description was not what I thought I was getting.  I will be sending it back.
B000I2HY2C|5|Love this brush cause your hair does not get caught anywhere on the handle!
B002N0OF9M|4|A great product from a great company, but way too strong. And a bit involved to mix to dilution rate. Would buy the premix the next time.
B000R7DJ72|4|I've had this for over a month, and it gives a good close shave.  I have also owned panasonic and remington shavers and this is very good at what it does in comparison.  My shaving method right now is to use this shaver in the shower (with shaving gel) and then directly after my face dries clean up any loose whiskers and things I missed in the shower with my Remington MS 900 (also apply Remington Face Saver talcom stick).  Overall it takes about 7-10 minutes to get a close shave, and I would say that this is about the best system that I've devised in 15 or so years of shaving.  Almost as good as a razor but without the razor burn.    I can't comment on the longevity of the Sanyo at this point, but right now it looks good.  Holds the charge well, cleans right in the sink.  It does seem like the blades have gotten duller (to be expected eventually of course) and I haven't had this for that long.  Hopefully I'm not buying a new set of blades every month ( I don't even know how much or how hard it is to get them, and that would be a consideration as Sanyo isn't one of the big Shaver mfg).  The beard trimmer doesn't work great in the shower, but its fine dry.  If you have sideburns, be careful not to have the trimmer facing up when you shave under them or you might inadvertantly trim them when you didn't mean to (trimmer blades seem to run all the time).  Overall though, I'm quite happy with it - a bargain for the shave.      One last word of advice, I have cut myself with it when in a hurry. I would probably attribute this to user error however, since then I let the MS900 handle the area around my adams apple.  Anyways, you really don't need to press down too much with this shaver, just go light and take you're time.  You won't be sorry you got it. Hope this helps someone.
B000C1W70S|5|What can I say?  I've been wearing Paris since I was seventeen.  I am now forty-four.  It's a classic.  And a few years ago, a colleague was standing by me and I thought, wow her perfume is really pretty.  I asked her what it was, and guess what? It was Paris.  After a laugh, I realized that I obviously made a good choice way back when I was in high school.
B0016LPK7U|5|Favorite
B00B7UQXLC|5|This has been my favorite shampoo so far out of any that I have previously used. I purchased this with the conditioner and the treatment (which is like a second conditioner). This shampoo makes my hair feel wonderful. For some reason, my slightly wavy hair dries completely straight when I use the trio, which spares me from having to use a straightener. The smell is quite pleasant and it doesn't overpower the perfume that I regularly wear. I am definitely dedicated to this product from now on.
B00DDXUZ2Y|5|My daughter swears by it. She says the makeup bloggers all loved it so I ordered one for her. She says it works great. The only complaint would be the packaging. It arrived in a box that was squashed and the tab openings were torn. Looked like somebody ran it over with a cart or something.  Other than that, it was a good gift for Christmas.
B004BD8QEO|5|Good
B0086BAV4K|2|machine is fragile and cheap, you become scared to tighten the screw for fear of breaking it - you DO indeed, get what you pay for with this machine.  although it arrived in record time, the seller has nothing to do with the fact this machine is simply no good.  if you, like me are using it as a test run to see if the real one is a good purchase (straying from coils) then yes, give this shot - the light weight design takes some getting used to.
B001RV00OC|5|Love this soap had ordered more of these but in a smaller size I do prefer the bigger bar this soap has the best scent not over powering or offensive just a nice natural clean orange scent .My husband uses this daily as he is trying to stay away from products with all the chemicals this is paraben and gluten free No propylene glycol, NO laurel or laurel or laureth sulfate and not tested on Animals this has rolled oats for gentle  exfoliation .Doesn't leave skin dry or irritated  anyone who gives this a try would agree this is a awesome soap and good to know there are no bad chemicals.
B0009I4MBQ|5|This product works great without leaving a residue on your hair!  Keeps hair in place all day, will definitely buy again.
B001ABLKK2|5|Works just as its said. Retail is still pricey but totally worth it, I do highly recommend it to anyone who wants a deeper clean feeling.
B001TJXI78|5|I absolutely love this product and get so many compliments on it, and then NYX discontinued it!  Regardless, the jumbo eye pencil is great and long lasting and goes on like butter.  I haven't used any other colors and hope they bring Lime back as it looks great with my eye color.  I am also allergic to a lot of makeup, and no issues with NYX pencils in general.  I've been using this product since 2012 and my only complaint would be that it tends to fall apart a bit in the sharpener, which would happen with any of the colors I presume.
B001TXFMD2|4|While this is not a miracle product, which ones are, it does give my nails some protection.  I love the high gloss shine.  TIP: keep the bottle standing upright when not in use otherwise its almost impossible to open once the product seeps into the lid.
B0015I4LUQ|5|Closer shave after using this product. Face too.
B0006GZAKI|1|This shampoo did a number on my hair! My hair is curly and this product made my hair feel sooooo dry and damaged.  Lets not talk about the smell, OMG! It was bad, please dont buy this stuff.
B001JQLNCS|5|Wonderful price for four razors!<br />I've used only one this month, perfect for when you don't have shaving cream available.
B005EMOFGE|5|The colors are very beautiful and the box is nice, though it can be a little difficult to put on and off quickly. I would highly recommend this palet :)
B00IOAUE0E|5|I love this toothpaste and am so disappointed that P&G has discontinued the flavor once again. I like many things with the vanilla flavor, and it is hard for me to find a good toothpaste that isn't too minty or just leaves a nice taste in my mouth. I really did like this one and will definitely miss it when I run out of my stockpile.
B003S4XC2I|2|This is perfect for what I wanted it for.  Used to trim the hairs above my upper lip and other areas of my goatee.  Haven't had it long enough to say how long a battery will last, but not worried.  I'd recommend this.<br /><br />Follow up review 3-22-2014:<br /><br />Starting to slow down despite new batteries.  Sometimes won't start.  Turns out this is a poorly engineered device not worthy of another purchase.
B00NTTQ5BW|3|Good quality but don't put heat on them. I curled the ends to blend better with my hair. The tool I used was on low heat so I wouldn't accidentally damage them. Somehow they still burned and now the ends are crisp and raggedy. I'm scared to wash them because I don't want to damage them any further. When they first arrived, I was impressed from the great quality. Now they're just okay. I no longer wear them because they make my hair look crazy. Clips are comfortable. Very unlikely to purchase again.
B004N7DQHA|5|I make my homemade lavender salt scrubs and was buying small amounts of Epsom Salts from my local store. I dcided to invest in buying in bulk and came across this product. I loved the ease of ordering in bulk, the suprior and great quality of these salts for my scrub and the shipping was fast. Great product and will be my go to vendor for my salt scrub in future.
B00021DPFE|5|I was surprised how well this brush works.  You never have to pull your eyelid and the line is even and thin for a subtle daytime look.
B001BLMNBG|3|Switch was cracked upon arrival. Cheap plastic. Taped together and kept cause I needed to use it right away. Would have sent back otherwise. Light and mirror are sufficient.
B000GBID20|3|It has been my first sonic toothbrush, so I might not be the most knowledgeable person in this area, but here we go.    For me it doesn´t seem to do much, just vibrates with moderate power.  However, battery and everything else is working great
B00336EUTK|5|I've been using it for about 5 days and have noticed some change. I've read other reviews and noticed people saying the sensitivity is insane! I have a suggestion for that though. I usually put the strips on while I'm taking a shower, why you ask? I noticed that when my mouth is filled with liquid, the pain increases greatly. Also if i breathe in with my mouth there is also slight pain. So what I recommend is to put the strips on while your taking your 15 mins shower and keep spitting and also breathe in with your nose. As a result, I now feel almost no pain. It makes leaving the strips on your teeth for 30 mins much much easier. My girlfriend has noticed my whiter smile, so I gotta say this product does work. ITS CHEAP TOO
B0053HB130|1|I love this shampoo. Works great.<br />The only concern is it's price. In mid 2013 I bought 3 of d 44oz for less than 20 $ each. Now I c it's actually doubled (40$).. Isn't it too much? Totally unfair..!!
B001AVY6ZS|4|I purchased this product at an Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa about 6-8 years ago and have been on the hunt for it ever since.  It makes your skin feel tight after using,, which to be honest I'm unsure if that's what a clarifying mask should or shouldn't do, but it makes my skin feel squeaky clean after usage!<br /><br />You can also use this on a developing blemish and it will neutralize it.
B00J9O533M|5|If you haven't tried Phytoceramides yet you are missing out on a great skin care product. These little pills make good on their promises. My skin and I am so glad we gave these a try.
B00375VWJS|5|Unfortunately Redken is no longer going to manufacture Contour 08.  I have used it for years and love it, so I looked  for someone who had stock.  The delivery of the product was excellent.  I wouldn't have any trouble purchasing any  product from this supplier.
B002N7SD0M|1|Do not use these kinds of products without consulting your doctor. I had severe abdominal cramps and stomach upset after using this product.
B006B7XHMY|3|super glitter perfect for parties . i love it as can wear it alone and it sure sparkly to get u noticed.
B004O3YCLC|1|The lipstain is more like a washable marker. It doesn't color your lips whatsoever and the little color that does appear is washed away after fifteen minutes. I suggest trying Covergirl's brand instead. It stays on for almost 6 hours without rubbing off.
B000C1UD4K|5|I've been wearing Happy for Men for as long as I can remember. Well over ten years. I've never really told any of the women who ask what it is. It's a hidden gem in my arsenal! I've never met a woman that hasn't said 'WOW. What cologne are you wearing?? I love it'. Simply put, it's worth the $50! The 3.4 oz bottle lasts me usually 1.5 to 2 years. Never loses it's scent or potency. Great stuff!
B001DHI0R4|5|Possibly the BEST Amazon vendor I've ever dealt with.  Great product, great freebies, all packed sweetly, with suggestions on use.  Morpho went above and beyond when my package came late, which is so rare!  Plus the lipstain's great, looks wonderfully natural, and LASTS  (just let it dry a moment to set).  Love this color and plan to buy more soon.
B005POFVNC|2|I didn't realize how long these are.  They may be OK for little girls, but not for babies.
B00C4PG53K|1|The necklace arrived in two pieces. I got my tools out to fix it. It is flimsy and poor quality. It is not the large beautiful necklace it claims to be.
B001MVXU7Q|5|This is the third jar I have bought. I love Sea of Spa Black Pearl products. Hand cream, body lotion, face creams, they all have a wonderful fragrance, leave my skin soft, provide good moisture, and yet do not irritate my sensitive skin.
B00LJDDKH2|5|I couldn't be any happier with this purchase. I love all the brush and the free sponge is a plus. Would definitely recommend this.
B00ARAPTUY|5|I was happy to find these rollers because I have used them for many years.  Mine were old and breaking up and I couldn't find any<br />in the shops around here.  They are the only ones that will stay in my hair so I was getting desperate.  I decided to check Amazon and there they were in all sizes .
B003Z4OD24|5|I don't usually post reviews but this product is amazing! It leaves my skin feeling so soft.. The smell of lemon wakes me up in the mornings.
B007HKZNXK|5|Great product with the same formula I used to be able to find in the US.  Happy to see Max Factor again
B009PMWXSG|1|I couldn't return this mirror that arrived cracked because it had hazardous material and it looked so flimsy that I did not want a replacement.  Not a recommendation.
B00OP22VXI|1|I have dark coarse hair. I left it on my hair for over an hour and wish the color would show up more, nope it did NOTHING. Will not buy again.
B006D0PTPM|4|I LOVE the Dove Clinical line of Deodorants.  I sweat quite a bit, and Dove always helps to combat odor and perspiration.  It doesn't leave any markings on my clothing, it doesn't feel powdery like many similar brands.  It also doesn't feel drying.<br /><br />Every scent and variety I've tried always smells fantastic, and this one is no exception.  I love this deodorant all around, except for one thing.  It claims it can alleviate darkened/discolored skin caused by shaving, and I noticed no difference in over a month of using it.  That's the reason I gave it four stars instead of five.  Its biggest claim seems to be a dud, at least for me.<br /><br />Outside of that though, it's a fantastic deodorant, and is everything a great deodorant should be.  I love products, and my less-than-expected results with this particular one won't deter me from continuing to buy them in the future.
B004DTPKNQ|5|Love this product and so do my two children ages 1 and 2. They love being able to put the soap on themselves since it is foamy.
B00IP42FBA|5|This product was used by my wife, and this review reflects her comments on the product:<br /><br />This was my first experience with using Rosehip Oil. The bottle was received well packaged for safe transport. My immediate first impression was that the quantity provided for this price is outstanding; Four ounces is a substantial amount that will last for a long time. The InstaNatural bottle is a thick, dark glass that feels of very high quality. The bottle top is a dropper that makes the product very easy to dispense.<br /><br />I am very impressed with the moisturizing abilities of the Rosehip Oil. I really like that it is a &#34;dry&#34; oil; my face never feels greasy when using it, and it seems to absorb very quickly into my skin. A small amount goes a very long way; just a few drops is enough to cover my entire face, the coverage is great.<br /><br />One thing I would mention to potential purchasers of this product, is that it is recommended to keep the bottle in the refrigerator between uses. Not a big deal, but it certainly adds another step to the process of using it. Not a big deal though; and the cool temperature helps to make it all the more refreshing to use.<br /><br />All in all, very happy with the product and the moisturizing properties of the Rosehip Oil. This is my second InstaNatural product (also have used their Rose Water), and my experience has been great on both counts.<br /><br />I was provided a sample for purposes of writing a review. This reflects my unbiased commentary.
B00OE36KJO|4|This is great.  It works well albeit it takes some getting used to.  The epilator is useful, and the brush appears to be good too.
B000C1W3J8|5|I finally found the green Polo for my husband. For some reason it is harder to find since the came out with other different fragrances.
B00GTFE1BO|4|This is the BABY Jai Ose.  The photo is wrong.  Still worth the price.
B000C1W70S|5|Excellent Product!
B00S5LB08W|5|With my aging skin, I really needed something so in doing research they say that the Vit C serum was the best.  I've been using this for a little over a week now and can really see the results of tighter skin and smoother complexion.  The bottle is a nice size and I can see this lasting me for a while since you just use a little.
B00E5Q3JN0|4|Smells great! My wife loves it.
B00FZESMKG|4|I enjoyed the product
B0054GBXOW|1|It made my underarms peel, sting and gave me a rash after i stoped using it, save your money & do NOT BUY!!!!!!!
B00DSCFWGY|5|A great essential oil for many uses.
B00TGPF84I|2|Had to throw 1 set of heads away.  It would pull the wiskers, not cut them!
B00D0Y6L88|1|My mom bought this for me for my birthday. Imagine my disappointment when a shabby box was withdrawn from the shipping box. I'm fairly certain this unit was purchased and opened, then returned by another customer. The foot pedal is missing, as are one of the drill tips, the package containing them had already been opened and the twenty sanding bands are missing. The so called instruction manual was a single sheet with not very useful info. The drill itself spins very slowly or not at all. Yes, I did insert the bit correctly. My mom is embarrassed and angry that her gift was a flop. I'm just kinda sad. My mom is going to give it another chance by requesting a replacement because the unit itself feels well made, just used. And yes, a new one was ordered, not an open box. If the replacement makes me happy I'll submit another review.
B004S06QUG|5|I purchased Sensodyne to prepare my teeth for the crest whitening strips which normally give me a toothache.  I was pleasantly surprised, I did NOT get a toothache!
B00K5NIJIC|5|Very cute, they came just as pictured. No problems
B0000536M2|5|I have health &#34;stuff&#34; going on and this mascara is the only one I have found that doesn't irritate my eyes or flake into them.
B00CNOUZE2|1|Worked once and fogged up ever since -- sent it back
B001ECQ53E|3|Degree Clinical Protection is a great product.  I bought the wrong scent of degree.  The Powder Motion Sense is a little overpowering for me.
B006GQYSGO|4|This razor was used by my 18 year old brother in law; it was his first electric razor.<br /><br />It took him 2-3 weeks to get used to the razor, and he was able to get a close shave with it right away. It's quite, easy to use and easy to clean. The battery is very long lasting; he was able to get about 2 weeks of use from it before having to recharge.<br /><br />The only issue he had with it was that it was not terribly comfortable to hold at first, but that issue somewhat resolved itself as he got used to using it.
B00E9IQUKI|5|no problems
B000UB23WW|2|Lift and separate. That's what most of us want. But within a very short time, the product was clumpy and dry. It's not inexpensive either....bummer. The search for the better mascara goes on....
B00330SBTQ|5|This stuff is great on pork as a rub, cures athletes feet, and when sprayed on money(if you have any left) makes it shine after you wipe your posterior with it.
B000ULLPBM|5|Helps my sore scalp and smells like mint. Arrived in good shape and right on time.
B00IKTD6EK|5|Beautiful brown instant tan. Not orange, doesn't streak and it works instantly. I apply 2 or 3 coats to get the desired color. Not ideal for someone who sweats or is going to the pool as it's not waterproof and is meant to rinse off. If you want an actual spray tan, try BOLD Sunless Tan in a can. This serves it's purpose as a temporary, instant bronzer and I love that it's a mousse foam.
B00ISF9XQ6|5|LORD HAVE MERCY on your a** when you get this in the mail! I've been reading a lot about natural  ways to deal with colds, infections, and viruses…which lead me to this bad boy. You can do your own research, and find out what I am talking about….but this product is no joke. It came sealed in a small bubble wrapped lined envelope, and I could smell it when I opened the mail box. I thought for sure the bottle had broke…..until I opened it, and saw it was wrapped three more times in bubble wrap, and sealed in another plastic bag. No…it wasn't broke…its like garlic acid. I don't know how to describe it.  I opened it up to take a whiff of this at full strength, and my nose hairs fell out! Just kidding lol but they might as well have.  I am using this to fight off colds and infects. So I placed about five drops in an 8oz glass of water…I was feeling ballsy….and chugged it down.  It slightly burned going down, and burned even more when I burped.  This is super ultra concentrated garlic healing power at its best.  If you want garlic therapy screw eating raw garlic, or spending money on some pill. This is so ultra concentrated for such a good price this little bottle will probably last me over a year!
B004QO300I|5|I've used this product , as well as Icy Blast soap, for years. It has a lasting &#34;just stepped out of the shower&#34; scent. Perfect!
B006SVCY6I|2|The big brushes shed like crazy. The smaller ones are a little bit better, but they are still pretty bad quality. I guess that's expected since the kit is pretty cheap...
B00756HQNQ|5|Excellent product. Best thing ever for my feet. Get one. You won't regret it.
B00639DLV2|5|ENG: Gentle on the skin, non-greasy and non-sticky. Gives you an immediate feeling of silky, smooth and soft. Its fragrance is pleasant and, even after a bath, it remains on your skin. Your body is protected from the sun safely and for 12 consecutive hours.<br /><br />ITA: Delicato sulla pelle, non unge e non appiccica. Ti da immediatamente una sensazione di pelle setosa, liscia e morbida. La sua profumazione &egrave; gradevole e, anche dopo il bagno, rimane sulla tua pelle.

B001ET6Z3M|4|This shampoo has such a nice fresh scent with noticeable, but not overwhelming, hints of both grapefruit and ginger.  The smell isn't the only great part of it, though...it gives my hair a very nice shine.  My blonde hair has salon-added highlights so it needs a shampoo that protects the color.  This shampoo is great for chemically treated hair and rinses clean, leaving only shine behind. While it doesn't produce quite as much lather as some of my other shampoos, it makes enough to get the job done and rinses well.<br /><br />Other things that I like about it is that it is cruelty-free (no animal testing), sulfate-free, PH balanced, mostly organic, and made in the USA. For those who like to know just what all ingredients are in the products they use, the listing is as follows:<br /><br />Ingredients:<br />Water, Pelargonium Graveolens (Rose Geranium) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract*, Salvia Sclarea (Clary) Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract*, Disodium Laureth Sulfosuccinate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, PEG-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Decyl Glucoside, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Extract*, Zingiber Officinale (Ginger) Root Extract*, Helianthus Annuus (Sunflower) Seed Extract, Vaccinium Macrocarpon (Cranberry) Fruit Extract*, Punica Granatum (Pomegranate) Fruit Extract*, Euterpe Oleracea (Acai) Fruit Oil*, Actinid
B000VQEUK4|1|There are lots of side effects
B003JT8PKQ|5|I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT HELPS WITH ROUGH AND DRY SKIN
B0057QZOEY|3|The tortoise pattern is more a dark brown not much of a pattern. The molding also has sharp edges where the mold lines are. They need to be filed more smoothly. They lock together well. I use them everyday.
B00BQ2D75Q|5|I love love love this product. It appeared in my Ipsy bag as a mini version, but seriously, this product is amazing for keeping my hair healthy.
B00LICKHOS|5|Excellent product, amazing at how different a brush can make.  I have used many and this is by far the best, and excellent service too.
B004XNEH9U|3|It defines curls but it leaves a film on your hair which I don't like. I don't think I will buy this again.
B0098JU8TC|3|I think it works, but the smell is little nauseating.
B003GDKH9C|4|I like the fact that I can get a fresh mouth guard every week.
B0009QZZ4Q|5|Works great as advertised, I just wish the conditioner effect lasted longer!
B003AYEUEA|1|After using this toothpaste for about two weeks, I noticed a sore on the side of my tongue. I also had a burning sensation all over the top of my tongue. At first, I did not attribute this problem to the toothpaste. I was in misery for about three days, barely able to eat, swallow or speak. There was actually a white sticky coating all over my tongue. I finally remembered hearing about someone who had a similar experience after using a toothpaste (not this brand). I wondered if it could be this new cinnamon toothpaste I had purchased. One night I brushed my teeth with nothing but water. The next morning I noticed a remarkable improvement. It does not seem to bother my husband as of yet. Beware to those who are sometimes sensitive to products. This one might cause a problem for you.
B001E769BM|5|I have been searching for a natural liquid hand soap for quite some time and discovered this one at a fancy B and B we stayed at for our honeymoon. A lot of people don't realize that many soaps labeled \\"anti-bacterial\\" contain triclosan, most of which gets washed down the drain and back into the environment which is a bad thing (very bad depending on your point of view) and those soaps also generally feel harsh on my skin. Soap IS already anti-bacterial, so I just wanted less chemicals in my home.<br /><br />Very happy to have discovered EO soap. It smells great, is easy on skin (can wash many times a day and not dry out), you need to use less of it because it works so well, and it only contains friendly natural ingredients. We do the Amazon subscription thing for this item set for once every 6 months. It's a worthwhile investment!
B00MMO72B2|3|I like the smell. not sure yet if this aids in minimizing facial hair growth.
B00F5GZQ76|5|I love it! You can't put much in it, but it's novel and I probably won't use it enough to wear it out. It's not TOP quality, but it's a cute bag! (and it only cost 14 bucks so I'm not expecting much, lol). Can't wait to get more pieces like the back pack or tiny tote.&#60;3
B001ET7JGE|1|The mascara was dried out.  What I could get out of it worked great.
B00LARBK7E|3|The shipping was on time but I had a missing item. It was replaced quickly and sell answered emails within 24 hours. The set itself is adequate for beginner practice. I personally do not like the quality on my nails.
B00QSSEC3O|5|This eye cream is great. I have two young kids, the constant no sleeping gave me very dark circles. After applying this cream for about a week. I can tell my under eye circles and dark circles are disappearing.<br /><br />** I received the product with a discount and to provide a honest feedback in return
B0030HMQTS|3|I'm glad I didn't spend too much on these brushes. They're good for the price and great for when I travel. I like the little pouch but the mirror is cheap. I wish the brushes picked up more color. Other than that, it isn't a bad buy.
B006L81SYW|5|I REALLY love this tanning lotion!!!! This is probably my 3rd or 4th time that I've purchased this lotion. Now, I've read some reviews about people complaining that it's too greasy. Tanning lotion is usually greasy. Hello!?!! Lol. I would rather it be greasy and protect my skin and give me great color than to complain about it being a little greasy.  Haha.<br />Now, I want to give customers a few pointers when it comes to tanning products containing DHA. At first, it's going to act like a sunless tanning product. Meaning, it will make you appear darker than you actually are. But after a while, it will start to soak into the skin and sort of stain your skin. BUT, and most IMPORTANTLY, YOU NEED TO LEAVE IT ON FOR LONGER AFTER YOU TAN!!!!! Don't gotaking showers right away. Leave it on until the next morning. This will help it soak into your skin. Also, it depends on what kind of bed you use when you use this lotion. I think it works better for use with bronzer beds than with the regular tanning beds. And if you are like me, and like bronzer beds better, we all know that you can't come home and shower right away. So usually not showering right afterwards isn't a problem for me. I'm not saying don't shower, just shower a little less. That's all.<br />I wish everyone the best with this advice and this lotion. I absolutely love it. I hope you do too.
B000KPO99I|4|I have used this before . Great success....!  Came back for more..
B00H5A513O|5|I am in love with this little roller.  I must warn that it stings while using, but I have extremely sensitive skin so perhaps it would not be uncomfortable for someone with normal skin.  However, the results are wonderful.  Having lived for a decade in AZ, my skin turned into a saltine cracker.  This little roller plumps the facial tissue and helps so much with absorption of serum and lotion that it looks like I've just had an expensive facial every time that I use it. While I have not seen a great difference in sun spot size, I have seen a dramatic reduction in wrinkles.  Despite the slight discomfort, I am anxious to use the roller and will continue its use forever.
B00009OL72|5|This cleansing mousse is wonderful for everyday use. It feels lovely, cleans well, and is gentle on my skin. Great brand!
B001E8GHKY|5|cheaper than WHOLE FOODS
B00AQG1UBG|1|Measurements were 2 sizes off. Was not true to size and was cheaply made. Holes were not cut out fully.
B00COSI7K6|2|I thought this color was going to be a little darker. I ended up giving it to my niece. She likes pinks.
B000Z7TZRM|5|I love Rosebud Lip Balm. I just put it on at night and my lips feel wonderful all day long at work. I am not constantly looking for lip balm as this works!
B001E0C9LI|3|researched for days!! wanted something like this & got it!.<br /><br />it doesnt shave very close and the sides scratch the heck out of your legs.<br /><br />its well worth it for a quick trim, and its super tough.
B00VLOKASQ|5|Very cute
B0080IHY58|5|I love Dax Coconut Oil!  My aunts tried mine and wanted some of their own...so I ordered them Dax for them and they are now fans too.  Great product!
B0017BI80K|3|I bought these because I was tired of always going to sally's for more nail tips. These tips are OK, but very very flimsy. They are super thin, and not what I was used to. I'm going to finish using them, but I wish I had a different brand, that came in bulk. Also, the sizes are a bit off (The 2 largest nails aren't around the same size..the largest is WAY too big, and the next smaller size is too small for my thumbs, so I have to file down the largest size to fit which is kind of a pain). For this price, the quality should have been better...
B00DPYJYQE|4|It works really good, ilove using the revitaluxe cream it leaves my hair really silky and soft ;)
B00L1HGGUO|4|When I buy saddle plugs I buy a size down because the flare is almost always too large. I don't recommend doing this if you are going to wear them long term and not replace them once a day with your actual size. I'm at 0g and I bought these in 2g. I love them. I've been wearing them every day since they arrived and they're exactly what I wanted. The flares make them look like 0g even though they're 2g. I put my 0g silicone tunnels in while I sleep.
B006JYMHW0|5|I love it! It covers great, it covers while it treats dark spots at the same time. I have Lupus so i have to use sunblock & be careful w the sun.. Well with skin 79 orange color I don't have to worry! P.s. I'm on my 5th one
B00ANFYEQS|4|all plates were neat no scratches and it really has nice designs good mix of all variety of designs
B0047HYF7Q|5|I love this lipstick. It stays on a long time. One note: if you are older, according to an article I read, a dark color can make you look even older. That's because it somehow makes the lips look thinner. So you may want to use it with a matching lip liner, which is what I do.<br /><br />Aveda is a reputable company. No need to worry about lead in the lipstick!
B003987CL0|5|The Gillette Fusion ProGlide Power Handle has to be the best handle on the market. Its design is sleek and fits comfortably in your hands.<br /><br />Gillette was kind enough to send over this bad boy so I can try it out and spread the word. Well good news, the word is good.<br /><br />The biggest thing I have to mention is going in to this, I have always been very skeptical of the whole \\"power vibration lifts the hair for an easier shave\\", well I don't know if maybe I am still skeptical and don't want to believe it as I am trying to justify why my shave left me smooth and in one swipe. My frame of mind is that the blades are sharper or at a better angle, or maybe it does work.<br /><br />So as any scientist would do, I waited a few days and decided to turn off the power and shave. To my surprise, and probably even yours as you read this, it did provide a difference. It was minimal, but sill the vibrations did help with the shaving.<br /><br />It was mind-blowing and because of that I have to say all in all, it's been great and Gillette has made me a fan. They truly are \\"The Best a Man Can Get\\".
B003G5V6TU|5|I just received this the other day, and I could not be happier :) I absolutely love the colour, texture, taste and smell of this product. I would definitely recommend.
B0014E3XSW|5|I've used Obagi products a lot over the years and this one is great if you have dry skin. In the winter my face gets really dry and no other moisturizer will help relieve it, but this works wonders and it's not too heavy or oily.
B005MZNMUI|3|Maybe need to used this mask every time but from time to time no any results .
B00MBPFKKM|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this product! I have been using this product for about two weeks. It made my face feel smoother and seems to be clearing up small breakouts I tend to get around the edge of my face. Buy this if you are considering it you won't regret it!
B008FZ562E|4|A little bit goes a long way. It sinks in and makes the skin feel nice and soft, not sticky or tacky like some lotions do. I have not really noticed a really big difference in a change in lift in the skin or reduction of wrinkles. Does it take more than a month to notice any improvement? I know OTC items are not as strong as RX when it comes to wrinkle reduction. I will continue to take care of my skin. Sunblock and reduce my exposure to mid-day sun and lessen my chances of sunburn. I don't smoke or drink so my skin is not in terrible shape. All in all I'd give it a C+ like most OTC items. If you want drastic results you need to see a dermatologist.
B000GX77NO|5|This product is great.  Use it three times a week and you will see the difference in the smoothness of your skin and a clarity.  Excellent service and price.
B003J5JM84|5|After using these tweezers for the first time I was really impressed by how well they work.  Absolutely worth the $20!
B0017BD4RC|5|My nails were so bad, pealing, breaking and actually the tips of my fingers actually were hurting.  This moisurized my nails and they are growing stronger.  I used some vitamin-type things too.
B004GZRQKM|1|I ordered from a popular auction site because the shipping to my location of the Amazon Market Sellers were crazy high. I have fine hair a little past the shoulders. I typically dry my hair with a hairdryer and then use a curling iron to curl the ends a little. I was hoping to get rid of my curling iron, but I still use it. The curling iron attachment is to short, but I guess it would have be a really powerful dryer for it to heat up a longer curling iron barrel. The circular brush attachment is too thin for my preference. I would prefer a circular brush the size bush shown attached on the picture. Right now I only use that attachment and try to give the ends of the hair a slight curl. If I want more of a curl, then I use my curling iron. Also, it no longer stays on unless I apply pressure to the button. This was after only about a week of use. Overall, I would not recommend.
B001B7CJDM|5|I prefer to not wear color on my nails but still want that shiny polish look for my nails.  This block works perfectly for that.  My nails look as if they have clear nail polish on them.  The block is simply, quick, and easy to use.  You do have to replace them after time so I keep several on hand.
B00240MO2G|5|I have used Oral-B Glide dental floss for years and first time ordered online. When delivered the packaging was the same as shown online and in tact. I will order in the future.
B001EUS8G8|4|The best creamy cleanser I have found at such a reasonable price. As others have said the packaging needs improvement. I have found it to leak.  Not enough of a problem to cause me to stop using though.
B0013NB7DW|4|IT WORKS
B001O4EOSU|5|Found this product on vacation last year and loved it.  I was afraid I would never find it again but I found it here and it was cheaper!
B002HPBF32|4|If you don't know which tones match your skin color, you want to try this mini set first, because after using, I only liked one of them (the bright pink one). Other samples were too shiney (really) or too thick. Glad I didn't buy any in full size.
B001MA0QY2|4|I've had it for a few weeks and I like it so far. It's a great deal for the price, and the quality is good. It heats up fast. My hair is long and thick, so it's always a pain trying to find a new straightener that does a good job and this one does! It straightens my hair at 415 degrees, so I don't even need to put it at the maximum temperature in order for it to work. I do wish the iron was a bit thicker, but I can deal with it. I especially like the red carrying case it comes in, although it's a bit difficult to fit the cord in there with it. Nice gesture, either way.
B00NVMQ3YQ|1|The metal coil that goes into the water bath, turns rusty after the first use, thus the water ALWAYS turns brown!! I
B0033DPIGW|5|Smells wonderful and scent lasts a long time, and for me, lasts longer than the perfume. I would buy it again.
B004N73POE|5|Great color.  Lasts for days
B0086LC49K|5|The cutest things ever .. All 20 were different :) I had absolutely no complaints about my purchase. Thank you
B000WZIVEA|5|As always, just right for my gal!
B00L04A0WI|3|Not in-love with this soap. It has coconut/yogurt scent which is great. The bars don't last long 1 bar a week per say. After 5 bars did not see dramatic radiant/ glow effect that it claims. I gave it 3 stars for the scent.
B000RJUZMW|3|Not a fan of this model. Decent shave, but I hate how short and slick the handle is.
B00J2AP9F0|5|Thanks to Gillette I got to try their new Proglide Razor with Flexball Technology for free!  I really enjoy the FlexBall technology, it contours really nicely to my face and has helped me get a cleaner and smoother shave! This has been one of the best razors I have used whether I use shaving gel or just water. I would highly recommend trying this razor out, you will not be disappointed.
B00E9PPH00|5|switched over to maxfresh from my old favorite. The taste is perfect and my mouth feels and smells so fresh for hours after brushing. I love the strong powerful FOAMING action. plus it is very easy to find in stores. cool scrub with the green stripe  on the box(this one) is great!!
9502737628|4|This comb is a piece of art.  Very pretty.  I wanted an anti-static comb so I got this one.  It is somewhat static free but hard to tell as my house is so dry during the cold weather. It fits well in my hand but the tip of the handle is a bit pointy making it not as comfortable as it could be.  It could also be a bit more pointy  at the tips of the teeth section.  It is a little hard to get the flat tips  of the comb through my hair. Maybe it is just my hair. I gave it 3 stars for functionality and an extra star for how pretty it is.
B00390DN34|5|This is such a cool product.  It's a very light powder that does surprising things.  My hair is a short, messy cut - blonde and fine.  With just a little of this product sprinkled at my roots, I can twist and turn my hair exactly how I want it.  It gives it great volume and really lets the texture show.  Don't use too much - it can feel chalky.  However, if you have oily hair, this will help you get another day out of your do!
B001HKR6WM|1|These brushes are of poor quality! The hair comes out all over your bathroom vanity. My fiance always asks what the hell I do when I put make up that it makes such a mess. DON'T BUY!
B000068PBT|3|Disappointed in sharpness.  These heads are only a little better than the ones I replaced.
B000BIXP5S|5|I have a lot of hair; it's very thick, and often frizzy. This product smooths out my hair without making it look greasy. You only need a small amount (less than dime size amount) for it to work. Don't get discouraged by the price-- it will last you a long while!
B001KYO1MI|5|These wipes work on my stubborn mascara - I'm a fan!
B0009EILAS|5|Great mild smelling body wash, my favorite.
B007YQURGU|5|I have been looking at LED UV lamps and they are so expensive. This kit comes with everything you need to do quite a few manis out of the box plus a LED UV 7 watt lamp. yes, you can only put 4 fingers in the lamp at a time, but big whoop for the price. I'm very happy with my purchase. The lamp works well with all the benifits of LED. The lamp beeps at 30 seconds and turns itself off at 1 min. The kit comes with basic instructions on application and everything you need to start as soon as you open the box. I love it. I was looking at buying a cheap lamp with replaceable bulbs until I could afford a LED this kit has fixed my problems with waiting.
B003S517E2|5|this groomer works great. It has quite a few accessories that all add to its value. Remington a good name and this item proves it.
B00IP42FBA|5|I have been using Insta naural Rosehip oil for about a month. I noticed the change after I used it for a week. My skin is very sensitive and I have to pick the face products very carefully. Thanks to rosehip oil. After using it, I forgot all my night creams. I just put rosehip oil at night. It is a great product. My skin is glowing and I see a change in my under eye wrinkles. Thanks, Insta Natural!!!
B0009S9ZTA|5|This  great
B005EMO0HS|5|Love it!
B00LMH79JU|5|I really love these tooth brushes and was only able to get them when I went in for my semi annual cleaning
B0009KPML8|2|However the same exact smell is achieved by Suave shampoo, so the $16/$1 comparison is a little harsh.   I won't be buying this product from Philosophy again, but there are many others that are great.
B00AZR5IGE|5|My lovely wife was honoring my fantastic handlebar moustache by getting me some of my favorite Colonel Ichabod Conk Mini Moustache Combs. I don't know if this wax came free with the purchase, or if she just got it on a whim, but it is fantastic. Holds well without being stiff, smells great, and is easy to use.<br /><br />Great product I recommend it for anyone looking for a little lift in their curls.
B0002VG6RI|5|so happy to receive it - so far the product works great.<br />Excellent condition and delivery time!  Thank you!
B0094G3LRK|5|It matches my skin very well (medium brown skin tone) and lasts all day. I also use powder because I have super oily skin so ti looks chalky at first but blends in within 30 minutes.
B00JCZVJYU|1|facewash wasn't really a facewash, it was more a cleansing fluid because it didn't foam up at all.  The moisturizer stung my skin a lot.  Product was only enough for 1 use.
B001MA0QY2|5|great and does not over heat
B006C2XH1E|5|It's hot and tingly and works really good.
B00FRDPQ54|4|I received the Glossing shampoo, conditioner, & creme  complimentary, for testing purposes. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. My expectations weren't high. But after using the trio on my daughter's thick, curly, often dry mane, her hair was noticeably softer, easy to comb through & as claimed... Shiny! It didn't appear weighed down or oily. Just a natural, healthy shine. I'll definitely keep this in our rotation! (Did I mention that I'm a bit of a product junkie?)
B00KCYTQ1S|2|Arrived on estimated date. Looked good. Except one the gems fell off. So had go buy super glue to fix. For price of product. Expect it to be fully intact and not needing repairs upon opening it from box. Overall worked good. Comfortable. Got lots compliments.
B000RZLL38|5|Used one in a hotel and it sure was convenient.  No cords to tangle and no laying on counter to cool off prior to putting inside cabinet.  Has been a pleasure to use.  It works as good as any hair dryer I've ever bought.  Recommend
B00I9K0YSQ|5|I've used these products for 2 years.  This anti-aging facial serum, packaged differently until just recently is the best I've tried.  I am am a 59 year old male that is routinely mistaken for being in my late 40's.  Light and smooth to apply, Customer service is terrific and they are very helpful in helping you determine what is best for your particular skin.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this product more.
B00D9NV2D4|5|Great
B005DJ4O2I|4|I purchased these socks for my sister who is currently going through chemotherapy. She said the socks aren't shaped like a typical foot shaped sock at all so they are difficult to wear and keep on. They aren't very comfortable. She also said that the socks are fairly small and she's got small feet.<br /><br />October 2013 Update: The seller reached out to me and sent me a replacement pair. Please note that these socks do come in a tube form. They will fit your feet snugly; I tested them out myself and wear a size 10. They were comfortable to wear and held the moisture pretty well. I washed them once and they kept their shape.
B00CDE35CG|5|The best spray bottle.........
B00GS4Z7LO|5|Love the argon oil for my hair. Can't beat it with any other hair product for quality.
B0009EXOP0|5|This product works great and not too gluey like some other similiar products
B007KTWNOA|1|These bottom lower false lash did not meet my expectation. They difficult to handle & didn't looked natural. I would not recommend them. Sorry
B00BH2EC04|5|I love Shu Uemura Products
B003VZPTAC|5|Very impressed was using others for years and came across this and for the price you won't find better. The guys at the gym could not believe how good this product performed and smelled not to sting but very pleasant. Don't forget to buy yourself a badger brush you will never turn back,
B003ZX32ZO|4|This set was an overall good value. The blush brush, eyelash/eyebrow comb, concealer brush, and angled eye liner brush were just what I was looking for. Although the eye shading brush isn't bad and I do use it, I have another ecotools brush that is more rounded and fluffy as opposed to flat, which feels nicer on my eyes and is much better for blending. The angled liner brush also has the same sort of scratchy feeling, but works well. I actually have an e.l.f. angled liner brush that came for free with one of my orders that feels softer and works the same. The brushes don't shed on my face, or when I wash them (and I wash them a couple times a week). This sent isn't perfect, but for the price it's really great.
B007MJVWIG|5|This GREAT bag exceeded my expectations by a mile. I have looked all over for a bag like this, in every type of store, and they were either not what I was looking for or cost a million bucks. So I googled black quilted cosmetic bag and came up with this. I wanted a largish cosmetic bag to go in my new extra large Kate Spade tote but did not want to spend Kate Spade prices. This is just the ticket. The material is quilted nylon. The zipper is high quality, and the size is perfect...and maybe best of all, the price is right! The inside is plastic with some small pockets and even a tiny mirror, and is obviously designed for holding cosmetics. This is the LARGE size. So pay attention to the measurements, because some might find it too large. I want to get one in the smaller size too for my other smaller handbags. It ships to you free right from China, (even to Hawaii) so maybe that's why they can keep the price down. I can't recommend this great find highly enough. This is why we love Amazon!!! Five stars!!
B000S7ZVHW|5|I use this for ingrown hairs on my thighs and body acne. I spray it after shower in the morning and again at night. After 3 weeks my skin noticeably cleared up. It takes time to clean out old pores but this definitely works and I highly recommend it!
B001ET76EY|5|About a year ago, I was diagnosed with Vulval Dermatitis/Excema.  Any contact with soap or shampoo would cause severe itching followed by severe dryness, cracking sometimes to the point of bleeding.  Needless to say, I was desperate to find a soap or body wash (and shampoo) that doesn't cause this horrible allergic reaction.  Nothing worked.  After months of agony I finally found an article that recommended contacting a chemist or pharmacist to find a 100% soap and fragrance free soap alternative.  My pharmacist said that dermatologists recommend Cetaphil or Ceravae.  I called a local dermatologist who echoed the pharmacists words.<br /><br />I just happened to have a big pump bottle of Cetaphil Gentle Cleaner that was given to me by my mother who passes things on to me when they were free and she doesn't want them.  Lucky me!  I washed my hair over the tub to ensure no contact with shampoo.  Then I showered and washed with the Cetaphil.  I was disappointed that there were absolutely NO suds.  But after using it just once, and for the first time in almost a year, I am not suffering!  There was absolutely NO allergic reaction after contact.  I will never have to try another soap or cleanser again.  I am SO happy with this product!  I highly recommend it to anyone with Dermatitis/Excema or other problem skin.
B001T8I108|1|To begin with, this thing makes my hair look awful.<br />It's also difficult to apply and hasn't made any noticeable improvements.<br />I've tried using it immediately after showering and a day after showering, and it just makes my hair look gross.<br />Maybe this is because I have oily, straight hair to begin with, but this product is lacking.
B005TKZS76|5|These are nice brushes..Super soft. I really like them. The only problem I have is that I thought that they were gonna be a little bit bigger but they are portable. Works just as well.
B000FS05VG|5|excellent hairdryer. Dries my thick hair fast.
B000E7STWK|5|Nice item and works great! If you are considering buying one such thing, this one must be a good buy.
B007CY2C76|3|This is a pretty basic clay masque. It absorbs oil, tightens pores, and feels cool and refreshing on the skin. I like the scent, but something in this burns my face. I have to blow dry the masque once its on because for as long as it is wet, my face feels like it is on fire. Long term benefits of this are minimal for me. I don't see improvement in my acne or overall complexion and my skin is as oily as ever the day after. Overall a decent mask, but not my favorite.
B001E766LU|1|First ingredient listed is propylene glycol! Yuck
B00A8NVWFG|3|The bow is a nice size and does look like the picture but it came bent up and for the price that kind of sucks.  I have not been able to wear it yet because it is pretty much stuck in that bent position.
B00KDO2HTK|5|Its very useful
B004TQOVBK|5|Picked this palette up at walgreens for. $2.99  and 25% off sale.  Very pigmented and gorgeous.  I received Lots of compliments wearing this trio.  I went back and bought two more for me as back ups, one for part of a friend's bday gift and one for my niece.  I highly recommend but find at a lower price if able.  Walgreens.com offered for $2.99.
B000MN63CO|3|Item does the job but is fragile...unexpectedly a hole will develope in foil with unpleasant results. Note: have replacements on hand.
B004F4GQF0|5|The product came exactly as I expected. I had been searching for it ever since I used some at a friends house. Imagine my horror when, after falling in love with the scent, I was informed that it was discontinued. Who does that? And who replaces the void with a cheaper smelling concoction? Anyway, I guess all that matters is the fact that I smell sexy again, my skin has a sexy sheen, and well, I'm just sexy and I know it....
B008PO6VSI|5|As advertised and prompt delivery!
B00117FOXE|5|I was using henna for many years, first Hennaluscent Sunset Glow, then Light Mountain Fox, and now this one. It does cover the gray, it adds shine and volume, it leaves you with bright red hair. I mixed both with boiled water according to instructions and waited for an hour. Applied first, waited for 10 minutes, rinsed, applied the second, wrapped the enclosed bag around the head and waited for 1 hour. Rinsed with conditioner (do not use shampoo to let the color set for 24 hours), brushed and voila! - no gray, vibrant red color, grassy smell and perfect volume. Excellent product. There are several colors in this line [...]
B0049LUI9O|4|Does it's job. Just be careful it's one of those that can get turned on on accident.
B008RODQFM|5|This diffuser has been running non-stop since I got it three weeks ago! It really pumps out the essential oils and runs until the water is gone. I would recommend using this in a bedroom no larger than 300 square feet. I'm looking for something as reliable as this one for a larger room. Can't beat the price!
B00BN7FCU2|5|hardly know you are wearing makeup!
B001ET76AI|5|Great product
B00021DLY4|5|Guys, listen up. <br />Although this is simply MY personal opinion, I'd like to share it with you, scince you took the time to read this.  I have been a user of Chrome for over 4 years now and to this day I still love the scent.  This scent simply described as authentic.  Clean, masculine and well defined.  There is not other scent like it on the planet.  Very few people know about it, which is why I'd like to spread the news.  I wish I could describe it better for you, but you've just gotta smell it for yourself.  Well worth every penny, this bottle will LAST.  Most colognes fade after about 2 hours after application.  With one spritz, several hours later you'll still smell heavenly, and trust me, the ladies WILL notice.  Take a chance, you wont be disappointed.
B004FPPVV4|5|These colors are beautiful and vibrant.  The price us very reasonable. I love the way it goes on. It arrived very well packaged and not one was broken. I will be ordering more. They are a good size too
B007134WGC|5|Great price & product. My wife loves this product. The only polish she uses on our furniture. Try it you will like it.
B003DKU3CY|1|If you have thick,straight and silky hair expect these to be a big pain in the butt! I am seriously better off with the regular hair ties that stretch quickly, snap and when used tangle in your hair! Hell for that matter a rubber band would be more suitable than these pieces of crap!    My hair is long enough not to be short but short enough not to be long. Couple this with the fact that my hair is very thick, very straight and very silken this is a total bust of a product!    When an ad/package says no slip 1 would expect it to be exactly that! No friggin slip!
B006LU4P68|1|Wasted my money. it's supposed to heat up. I thought it was a moist mask treatment. don't buy this.
B000SSDTOS|5|Bought as a gift for someone with thick toenails. He said they work really well. Definitely better than the cheapies.
B00CV919AI|5|This is by far the most realistic-looking and cutest wig I have ever owned. I recently went through chemo and have bought quite a few wigs, some more &#34;high end,&#34; others cheap and obvious, and then a few that ended up being inexpensive, but wonderful (like this one!).<br /><br />I honestly think this wig looks better in person than on the model picture. I actually wanted to post a picture of how great this wig looks, but couldn't find the place in the reviews section to do so. I have received so many compliments on &#34;my hair&#34; since buying this wig and despite being so inexpensive, you can truly use this for everyday wear (I know I do)! This is probably the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon. X&Y Angel is a great company overall, but this wig is perfection!
B00BH3OBUO|5|This is an awesome product.  Smells wonderful.  Would totally buy it again.
B00FU1YOZQ|4|This mirror does what it needs to and seems to be plenty sturdy - should last a long time. The light on it, however, is not bright enough for me to be using the mirror without also using a good ceiling or desk lamp on my face.
B00G7SCI7C|5|Love it. Fills in the thin spots. I feel so much more confident now that I can cover my thin spots.
B00QU3EFXO|1|it didn't work out for me.
B003UZXTAU|5|Great color...hard to find in drug stores.
B0044IZ7SO|3|Excellent electric razor for about 3 months. Then it starts to wear down and you either chop up your face or you buy a new attachment of blades. Gets expensive after awhile.
B002CSPIKA|4|It REALLY works and works fast! Very gentle too.<br />One of mine favorite products is the scrub. Makes my skin so smooth and even less breakouts!
B001BQXTQO|5|Ordered 3 bottles of Loves and I couldn't be more happy with the purchase! The packaging was great and the scent was just like I remembered from when I was little. I will definitely re order when I run low!
B006F9HUJE|5|Really, really love the travel brush! Just what I was looking for! Not as successful with the flosser part, but maybe I am not using it correctly.
B00LNOV8JO|5|As a college student who grew up in California and is now faced with the blistering east coast cold, this oil has been so helpful. The dry, dry winter wind usually gives me scale-like dryness on my face, and no matter how many moisturizers I apply, the scales remain. Oil to the rescue! Here's my routine: every night, after washing my face (with a gentle soap), I apply a couple of drops on my face. Once it soaks into my skin (just give it a couple of minutes), I apply a tiny bit of shea butter to really lock that moisture in. My face is glowing despite the harsh cold! One warning: the oil is a sort of light brown color, and it does stain clothes, so be careful with it.
B00DWAOTUC|2|This stuff is really sticky and makes my neck skin pucker like a piece of dried fruit. I had to use regular lotion over it for my skin to look normal. Not sure what it's supposed to do other than act like glue drying on your skin. I used a small amount around my crow's feet and under the eye - just like the 90 second miracle  - and it worked better than on the neck. I'm only 44, though so maybe it works better on a really saggy neck. I just have a little gobbler so this product didn't work too well for me other than as an eye cream. When I put it on the long front part of my neck it made the skin look much older because of the dry puckering. Strange effect.
B00G9XOX8C|5|Great product and love the way it made my hair feel.  My hair had bounce again.
B005NVG4UQ|2|I recieved this lipstick today and I'm dissappointed in color, texture & everything else about it.<br />It looks darker than the picture on-line. It's dark brown/orange and its a creme color. It feels greasy and comes right off after trying twice. In the on-line picture it looks so pretty, almost like a coral pink/orange thats why I bought it but let me tell you that is not at all what it looks like when you recieve it. I guess it was cheap so I'm not out to much money but I would'nt buy it ever again. I wish I had'nt in the first place. Oh well.
B00212H2ME|1|This products t is terrible and misleading. The items received were not the brand shown in the image. The quality was terrible.
B0009ML9FY|4|needs a pump top as the lotion is thick and hard to get out of the bottle half way through.
B000GLRREU|5|My husband had me buy this for him after a less than fantastic trip to the dentist. I had used one regularly as a child/teen and was very happy he finally decided to humor me and get one. We both love it. It has also proven very useful to use one our son who goes though chemotherapy. Some side effects are very hard on the mucous membranes and lining of the mouth and sometimes a regular bristled brush is just too much and flossing is certainly out of the picture. Both the brush and the pik heads have really come in handy for those times. It is also very fun for a seven year old to have a very tiny water machine gun and makes it oral care the highlight of the evening.
B00411B4CC|5|Best acne treatment ever!!!!!!!! If you have a stubborn pimple apply it and leave it overnight and wash in morning and it will dry it out! Will buy again!
B00JWXDFO4|5|LOVE THESE! So slim and nothing slips off, all other hangers are obsolete in comparison!  No idea why I didn't buy these sooner. The price is a total steal too.
B006WKQO4I|5|This perfume stick, not only smells absolutely wonderful and fresh, but also looks quite adorable on my dresser! I highly recommend.
B005OKVUTG|5|I am in love with this CC Cream! I have very pink undertones and have a hard time with creams that come off too orange or red with my skin tone. This CC Cream covers nicely, while still feeling light all day. I usually start with some smashbox primer, the Mary Kay concealer in Ivory 2, then finish with the CC Cream. Adding a light translucent powder leads to the best looking skin I've ever had. I get lots of compliments, even if I just use the CC Cream, that my skin looks so fresh and smooth. I would definitely recommend this CC Cream. My favorite on the market.
B00CLC0ZVY|5|Just as advertised, speedy delivery.
B005C2NAO4|5|We love this brand!  No toxins on your skin...just natural moisturizers! I use it on my children and for myself.  I also use the shampoos and hair products!
B00G2IK7B6|5|Best hair products I've ever used. The shampoo isn't harsh so it won't strip your hair of natural oil but it cleans your hair & scalp incredibly well. Rinses out clean; doesn't leave any residue stuck to you hair so it won't weigh it down. Best thing I've ever used for my curly hair
B0081DRPPQ|5|this sent is the one I like the best.  I have had difficulty finding it in the stores as deodorant only
B003M31O52|5|There was one change.  There used to be a glossing conditioner (which I loved) but the current conditioner is good.<br />I do love this product over some competitors.
B0030ZRS8Y|4|good for waxing
B00AFI6N9E|5|I have always used cushion grip since I have had dentures and it was getting hard to find,so I chose Amazon and they had it.I rely on Amazon as I can always rely on them as they usually have what I am lookiing for.
B004OFYMW4|3|it's okay nothing special
B009WS6MVW|5|My 7 year old daughter and I use these all the time.  We love them!  Great, easy way to do your hair.  Look &#34;regal&#34; and elegant with minimal effort.  We add pretty flowery pins or bows, and it just tops it off perfectly! VERY HAPPY with these
B00D1UHYQY|5|This light is great to declutter your work station the light attaches to the opi led lamp and plus in the back - hence the two plugs back there so no extra cords to trip on! Also the light is a true white so it keeps the true color or the polish and skin instead of adding yellow hues to it like normal lights
B00152QRVS|5|Elixir Des Merveilles Perfume by Hermes smells so yummy that I can wear it every day it is not over powering it just smells delicious. I was in Las Vegas and came across this Eau De Parfum in the Hermes store. Just had to buy I loved it so much, it has become my signature fragrance!
B003CJP13W|1|It's been about a month since I started using this gel. I didn't want to purchase it because of the price. I bought two of them, I used it twice daily because I started seeing cellulite on my left thigh. I don't understand how one thigh is bigger than the other. I noticed after two weeks my thigh looked worse. There are more pothole sized dimples on the side and back of my left thigh. I now have to do uneven amounts of repetitions of thigh exercises when I workout now to correct it.
B007XA49O8|5|I use in my hair and it does great for voluminization. Thick yummy oil for face moisturizing too.
B001VD6JX2|2|Let's face it, \\"aluminum\\" deodorant products are bad for ones health, but they work - that's the unfortunate thing! This product has promise because it hasn't any aluminum or artificial ingredients, it smells  masculine, but it falls short because although the ingredients initially smell great, the body odors eventually come through and in the end the product doesn't work too well. Since this product doesn't have any aluminum ingredients to kill the funky body smells, you will have that funky hippie or European underarm smell at the end of the day, and applying more of the product isn't going to help you a bit because it will probably make the condition worse! Maybe Burt can add some type of alcohol or menthol or tea tree solution to combat that \\"Woodstock\\" hippie or that \\"Europeans who don't like to wash too much\\" odor? And there's also now this issue with the shirt staining. Back to the drawing boards on this one Burt!
B000HQ0L2E|5|The MANGROOMER worked exactly as it said it would.  I have no trouble using it on my body.  It does help to be in front of a mirror to be able to see what you are doing.  It did not chafe or irritate my skin at all.  I am glad I bought it.
B008RODQFM|5|This thing is considerably smaller than I expected. About the size of my elbow to my wrist. Works great and I would recommend but works best in a smaller room.  Very easy to use and clean.
B004691EYM|4|Fairly decent scent, not my favorite. Just one to add to the collection to change it up a bit.
B008R1GPZ8|2|I have 4C hair, that's coarse hair. And i started using this product and it did not help. It made my hair dryer,, I was looking for a moisturizer and this did not help. I would not be trying this product.
B002XHADYG|4|This product is smooth, creamy, does not sit on skin to slide off later. Does not dry out your skin. It is very easy to apply. The only con is it is a medium coverage, might need to use concealer for really hard to cover areas.
B0058AGBYG|2|I bought this hoping it would help with facial hair but found that it doesn't remove the hair as it says it would do.  Don't waste your money; not worth it and doesn't work.
B00RPJZMUM|5|I always purchased very expensive blow dryers.  Thought I would try this one because of the reviews.  So far, I love it.  Dries just as well or better than anything that I have purchased.  It is not loud.  Heat and power are excellent.
B00CGR26B6|5|So far I love this.  Works wonders on my dry hair and smells great too.
B000N5WT2O|5|Does the job but without that obnoxious menthol smell of other products
B00IGPCEPK|5|Wonderful toothbrush.  My first sonic toothbrush so can't compare to others.  Love the stand that it comes with.  Took it on an extended trip and the cap that it comes with came in very handy.  My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have!
B000F4Z9NY|1|The Interplak WJ2CS Compact Rechargeable Water Jet works well for a short time 3-4 weeks. Then they do not work well. I have had two of them so I have some experience with them. Don't they make things well anymore?    Ronald P Peroff MD
B001E96LDQ|4|I've been using this product for a couple of years.  In recent months I have visited three or four drugstores where I had previously purchased it, and could not find it.  As often happens, I remembered to ask myself, \\"I wonder whether I can get it on Amazon?\\"  Of course!  Thank goodness for Amazon, saving me countless fruitless shopping trips.
B00ICVJTAG|5|Fabulous
B000IMJS0S|5|Very good soap! I used it to wash my face and was very pleased!  Purchase it! You wont be sorry!!!
B000FS05VG|4|Met my expectations for the price, however, doesn't blow quite as hard as the hair dryer I used to own.
B00021BKT2|3|Lovely, very fresh and citrusy,  would have been perfect day-time fragrance, BUT, it does not last AT ALL. It completely disappears in a few seconds.
B00FH692PQ|5|Great shampoo! I have noticed a bit of regrowth and I have only been using it for a couple weeks along with the matching Pura conditioner. Highly recommended!
B00U63AWR2|5|One of the most interesting options I&#34;ve tried for acne scars and my dandruff problem. I applied the oil directly to my skin, and was able to feel a cooling effect. Over time, I saw a return to normal. Eucalyptus is an interesting scene overall, which is one of my favorites. This one is strong, and it is concentrated to the point where you're going to feel a slight tingle when applied correctly. I have recommended this to my friends, and family, and they too have seen the benefit. This is a good oil for anti-inflammatory skin issues, and has a very compelling scent. I love the smell of Eucalyptus leaves anyways, but this really brings out that scent to me, I love it. This is a great oil to use for skin care, which is why I used it, but there are so many other options to consider this for. A great buy.
B00JGN1NHQ|4|Great brushes - I wish they had come with information on what each brush was for - because I am not a makeup guru!
B00NO3G1IA|5|For the last couple years, I've been getting a Brazilian Blowout. I know what you're thinking, but this is another form of straightening. It involves a smoothing agent, better for your hair. Well I've been using the same blow dryer for years now and my hair really never seems the same as when my hair stylist blows it out. So I was offered this Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer from PRODRYER for a great deal to share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered one.  It arrived and I was thrilled to see that there were 2 different attachments (honestly not sure what, but like a vacuum, I'm sure it great), and a cool shot for styling. I was delighted, as was my arm, that the time it took to dry my thick hair was literally cut in half!!! Also, the heat was off the hook!! It is way hotter than my old useless blow dryer. I think sticking my head out the car window might be faster...lol. Another perk was that my hair was nice and smooth and FLAT!! I usually need to do some straitening with my flat iron, but this hair dryer took care of that. If you are looking for a great Hair Dryer, I definitely suggest buying this Ionic Ceramic Professional Hair Dryer from PRODRYER. It is beyond worth it!!
B008XBGVUQ|5|People looks at my nails all the time and asks me where I got them done! does that says it enough?
B00CHO2DIE|5|Gave this product as a gift, and my girl fried really loved it!
B0058SY1XQ|5|Purchased as a gift for my son and to replace an old Wahl rechargeable pro trimmer #8900 purchased in 1993.  He likes it, says it works well and looks good too. [[ASIN:B0058SY1XQ Wahl 9818 Lithium Ion Stainless Steel All-in-one Groomer]]
B006YC3UP0|4|I received the product and everything for awhile was great until a few brushes came apart.<br />They do the job but clearly are not well put together,
B00DEFAG0W|5|I love buying these anniversary or deluxe sample sets lets me try out a bunch of stuff for way cheaper than usual.  1) face wash- great.  Exfoliates and leaves me with a renewed glow.-- moisturize though if you are in a dry climate; 2) the face peel (silver tube)- love this stuff!  This sloughs off all of the yuck that i get from city smog and starts the process of bye bye blackheads for me. 3) camu camu (orange bottle)-  I have redness across my nose and always look for brightening serums to help calm this.  Definitely has helped keep my redness to more of a gentle flushed looked, aka healthy. 4) laser free eye serum-  this is a god send for my dark circles.  not overnight, but it is amazing.  5) daily defense-  don't know if i'm ultra keen on this.  smells too sunscreeny for me to want to put this on my face everyday and a bit to slippery for my taste.  I stick more to Josie Maran for  sun protection with the daily spf moisturizer she has, it smells more like spices than suncreen.
B001MP0RLY|4|These clippers are an oddity.  They are described as \\"straight edge\\", but actually are curved out.  To me, that doesn't make sense for clipping nails. I didn't expect any clipper could clip inward, but that was my oversight.  They are well made and sharp, though.
B003ULVNNE|5|Leaves my hair silky & soft.  I only have to use a small amount & I have long, thick, naturally curly hair.  It smells like skittles.
B004GWEG76|5|Were looking for a deodorant for our daughter, she has such sensitive skin and nothing worked until we found this product.  So affordable, and she loves it.  Highly recommended
B009PQ8P6Q|4|A manicurist in the Middle East used this awesome stuff on my over dry and cracked cuticles.  I looked at the bottle so I could get more. Made in Anaheim USA!  I've got two bottles in strategic places to keep my cuticles in really nice.  I've used a lot of other products this is the only one that helps me
B001DNE3KQ|4|This razor works wonderfully and does as good a job as some that cost as much as $190 (which I think is a ridiculous price for a razor).  It gives a nice close shave with very little effort and holds a charge for a reasonable amount of time.  It can be used either wet or dry and cleans easily with cold water when done shaving.  I would buy this product again and recommend it to others.
B00K6CNJXC|2|These are worthless, threw them away.
B0041TGPMI|5|I like it, it is beautiful.
B0034F9KEU|2|I'm 38 and I have very fair, sensitive skin. I've used this cleanser a few times and unfortunately each time I experienced dry, itchy, red irritated skin a few hours after I used it. I'm disappointed because I really like the minty, invigorating feeling when I washed my face with this cleanser. It does feel like my skin is getting a deep cleansing, it was just too harsh for my skin. I don't recommend this for people with sensitive skin, but for people with normal skin, I think they may really like the minty tingle of this cleanser.
B000KOHTQ4|5|great price, shipped promptly, love this product~~worked great a covering my gray hairs and easy to use much cheaper than going to salon, and Highlights look great!
B000AA5VUE|5|This is the third item I've purchased months ago from the M-n-T line that I'm content with. For a 32 oz. bottle that runs between four and six bucks you will get your money's worth. I tend use it when my hair is thirsty for some protein. I know it's perfect for my hair type since I'm a bit protein sensitive. I also use it as a leave in for a quick style and go.  I do like the smell and how manageable my hair response to this product.
B001JOYDRM|5|Every single time I spray this on myself or in the room as room spray my boyfriend never fails to tell me how good I smell or the room does. I would highly suggest getting this. It smells SOOO good!
B00MYRXIOM|5|Good for when you can't get hair wet. Works well.
B000YT6VZ0|2|The product smells terrific, but I can't help but feel like it was the biggest waste of money with the packaging design. From the first pump, it is incredibly difficult to get the product out. I can only imagine how hard it will be when I near the end of the serum. Don't waste your money on this one.
B0074EI6CE|5|Love these masks. They keep my skin moisturized and smooth all day long. Unlike other brands' paper material I have tried, these masks are transparent and 100% cotton material. Highly recommended!
B0016JHJW6|5|Excellent product that I have used for years and years and at a lower price than the Aveda salon.
B00006IV46|5|Great
B00HYLVSO0|1|Horribly cheap and a waste of money. Got it to comb my beard and it just pulls. Teeth are too close together and short for even my regular hair.
B000X9UI2I|5|Best length for me.  Ordered it after I got the 30&#34; and 32&#34;.
B000ALCJR6|5|I was a little hesitant to spend so much money on a blow dryer and then have it not live up to its claims, but I have to say I am delighted!  My long, curly hair was dry in 7 minutes,  and was soft and not frizzy!!
B00EZWSNGM|5|My skin loves this stuff! I have combination mature skin, and I use this product every night.
B00DZ3YTGK|3|Used it for making SPF 15 lip balm.  It gives your lips a light white coat (which I found appealing...looks summery)<br />Was suppose to try DIY suncreen lotion but I'M sure looking &#34;summery&#34; all over my body won't look as appealing as just my lips :(
B000WHWIWO|5|If you have thick hair and cut it yourself, then this product is a must.
B0025U19SA|5|I am not a professional hair stylist but I do cut my family's hair and this set of scissors is sharp & feel very durable.  I think I will have them for a long time.
B00GV277DE|5|nice
B005CFE27A|1|At first it seemed like a good product and worked well, however after a short time it fell apart, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!
B001NILLAG|3|What I like most about this is the price I paid ~ $31.47 for a \\"Last Chance Open Box\\" deal.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there's obvious reason that this was previously returned by another customer, hence why the product box had seen its better days well before it came to me looking worse for the wear.  These things are expected when buying USED / RETURNED / DEEP DISCOUNTED items, & that's the leap of faith you may choose to take ~ knowing in advance & being 100% confident in Amazon's Return Policy, I took the plunge ~ YMMV.<br /><br />I have to wonder if I received D. Hoppe's return ~ the \\"LOCK\\" position is initially verrrrry stiff ~ so stiff, we expected it would break ~ it did not break, & w/ use, it's becoming easier to operate (the right brake is still a challenge for me though) ~ I guess you could say a 'breaking-in period' is required for the brakes ~ overall, the whole thing has a \\"stiff\\" & \\"tight\\" feel to it that's indicative of a new unit.<br /><br />THE BIGGER ISSUE (IMHO) is that the seat is off center ~ that's a quality control issue that I would be highly annoyed with, had I paid full price.  It's important to note that rectifying the seat's placement is mostly a non-issue (someone else has to do it for me, I don't have the name-I-can't-remember tool) ~ it's just a matter of undoing & sliding something, then re-doing it, so there you have it.<br /><br />Beyond all that, assembly is a breeze ~ it's mostly already assembled on receipt ~ partial dis-assembly was necessary for shipping in as compact a manner as possible.<br /><br />SUMMARY:  At the current listed full price ($76.99) no, No, NO ~ I'd be one very unhappy camper.  At the discounted price ($31.47) I got my bang for my buck.  Compared to what I think the average price range is on these contraptions ($60-ish range) I would not recommend this particular brand to anyone unless they too can get it at a deeply reduced price.<br /><br />EDIT TO ADD A CONSIDERATION THAT JUST OCCURRED TO ME:  The wire basket makes this less user-friendly than those units w/ the soft nylon bags that are semi-permanently attached.  The basket is what it is & has to be removed when folding this unit for storage, transport, etc. ~ the units w/ nylon bags remain attached (unless you choose to unsnap & remove for cleaning) & have a loop inside on the bottom, which is intended to grasp & easily pull the unit into its folding position.<br /><br />This is, IMHO, an important consideration depending on whether others may be doing the folding for you vs. your particular mobility issue(s) & whether you need minimal hassle for the very same reason(s) you require assistance in the first place.  For this alone, I'm adjusting & reducing by one star (to three).the soft nylon bags that are semi-permanently attached.

B004FJV9FC|5|Love this scent.
B007M81B4M|1|I think the prodact is face. I had the worst reaction. My face filled with red spots and itching. I dont recomend, it appears that the product is manufactured in foreign country and not us. Like olay product should
B00EWNOK5C|5|Great value!  I would like to buy another one!
B000V70MWS|5|The BEST.
B00H8YF1VE|5|Wow! This Argan Oil transformed my hair into a shiny soft and bouncy head of hair. I never used Argan oil as a Pre-Shower Hair treatment but I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />The Oil is 100% Pure and it penetrates deep into your hair giving it the Moisture it needs to make your look and feel healthy bouncy and shiny. I air dry my hair and it did not look weighed down or greasy at all.
B00016QSPO|5|Good product
B002BWOY3Y|2|I have used this product in the past and has worked wonders. When I started using this one though it made me break out HORRIBLY! I don't know if it's different than the ones I've bought from the store. My boyfriend uses it as well but it's been good to him (that's why I give it 2 stars) I had to stop using it because I was getting embarrassed of all my break out. I went from having one or two occasionally to my cheeks and chin having several.
B000ZFRRNS|5|I was thrilled to see Prevage on Amazon.com.  I had used the product before so I know what it can do for my skin.
B0007DHH7Y|1|Bought this as my first electric shaver.<br /><br />After spending a frustrating 20 minutes trying to shave 3-day old stubble, only to find it had only shaved a few patches, returned to the instruction manual, assuming I must be doing something wrong. Re-read, attempted again, same problem. Read these reviews and realised that this shaver is, essentially, a waste of money. For an item that touts itself on its flexibility, this is nothing short of a rip-off.
B001WAKUUC|5|This is the best lash growth serum ever!<br />In one month my eyelashes grew a lot. They are fuller and longer and beautiful. No side effects at all.
B001DKRMB6|2|The magnification is fine, but the mounting system is very shoddy.  There were NO instrustions included, which I didn't need, but would be helpful to some people.  The plate that fits over the actual mount is loose and moves whenever the mirror is adjusted for use.  The exterior screws won't tighten the plate.  &#34;Cheap&#34;, is what I would say best explains this Jerdon mirror.  I would not buy another Jerdon product.  I also had to use my own screws and anchors.
B001ADSI3C|5|love it!
B00FXHPEI8|5|Serina!! You are truly amazing! Not only are your fragrances wonderful (and this is my new favorite!) your shipping is lightning fast!!! I will continue to refer new customers to you! May your hands and heart be blessed! The world smells better with you here~ I have given many of your oils as gifts and will continue to do so. A big shout out to you of THANKS & keep up the great work
B0036Z469M|5|I love this color and it looks spectacular when applied. Have had many compliments and questions of what color is that? I wear it on a daily basis and it goes with just about anything I wear. Best color ever and the quality of the paint is great!
B00ALR6VK0|3|This is beautiful but it is so thin that it tends ti poke and itch my skin when wearing it.
B002DPUY56|1|When I received this product it reeked of petroleum!  Others had commented that it also smelled bad so I decided to call Burt's Bees myself and they told me it should not smell bad.  They asked me for the barcode on the package--which the seller conveniently covered up--which only raised my suspicions.  I carefully removed the sticker w/o destroying the barcode.  The barcode revealed the product was manuf. in 2008!  BB told me it has a shelf life of only 3 yrs. so this product had long expired—3 years past the use date; hence, the reason for the rancid odor.  Burt's Bees is a reputable manuf. and King of Deals is tainting their image by passing off expired, foul-odored merchandise.  DO NOT let this one seller dissuade you from buying BB's products.
B003WR3QSG|1|I was satisfied, but not amazed by this brush. It worked well enough, although I thought the bristles were too stiff.     Then after about 3 months use the glue failed and the bristles came off the handle.
B001BHGB8Q|5|Love it.
B00H9CFCSC|5|I love this bead. It fits my pandora so well. I wanted a simple bead that shows my support for the navy, as my boyfriend is in the navy. Overall really nice bead
B00FHR3OFY|2|The applicator fell apart the fist time I tried to apply the eye shadow. .  Obviously old
B00VSKLX7A|5|A treat for your skin
B00IOTXKWO|5|These are honestly the best tweezers I have ever used. I purchased them for my friend and my daughter and they absolutely love them too. Precise and easy to hold. Perfect for ingrown hairs too. Highly recommend these gems.
B002B9V7MS|4|For my upper lip I love these, as the sticky stuff left behind washes off easily. True wax strips tend to rip off some of my skin and the goo is difficult to remove afterward. I'm glad I could find these strips online!
B00I81IS70|5|While a little pricey for only 8 clips, these clips work great with the Devacurl system of products
B0046FRYJK|5|I am so glad that I was able to find the same flat iron that I had before. This is the best flat iron ever made! Received it brand new in a box.
B000P22TW0|5|Awesome
B00UI3OHG2|5|This smells amazing and feels good on my skin.
B004SGKMA0|5|These are my second favoriate blades (Feathers are the 1st), but for the price you can change blades after every shave if you want.  I normally get 3-4 days out of each blade.  Good all round blade for someone just starting out on DE shaving, but order a sample pack with different blades to try before you order 100 blades.
B000A3ZN7M|5|Arrived on time and as expected.  No excitement, just practical. They want ten words so here we go, seriously now?
B007635Z04|5|Great coconut experience !!!
B00KB9Q8GU|5|Very good product that I'm using with Derma Rollers. It is truly an amazing serum. My skin feels softer and I believe it's helping clear my skin up as well!<br /><br />I'm definitely buying it again.
B005UFN3VS|3|Not bad, gets tangled easy...
B00HZDYHGI|4|These plates are great, all around good designs. I wish the plates were bigger and some of the design prints where a bit big for my nails. This set has some great scroll/flower designs which I like and for the price, all around decent stamp plates.
B000AMRIIK|5|We just ordered two of these as replacements for the Sonicares that we have been using for the past few years, as they were approaching the end of their useful life - battery-wise.  Replacing the batteries is not an option, and it is the primary expense. <br /> <br />For anyone that has not tried a Sonicare - they are wonderful!  It sounds corny, but even my dentist could see the difference - honest.  Once you get accustomed to using one, you don't want to use ANYTHING else.  Ours always go with us when we travel. <br /> <br />They are not cheap, but you only have one set of teeth - if you take care of them.  Find something else to pinch your pennies on instead.
B00B02XG08|1|DID NOT WORK AT ALL
B00310X1I4|5|This has become my new favorite scent.
B005DKKBTC|5|This is the best electric shaver on the market period. It is built for professionals.<br />It is light, less noisy, easy to use with outstanding shaving capability due to very high rpm.<br />It is far superior to anything available at a very reasonable price.<br />Go ahead an purchase one for yourself with no hesitation. You will see the difference.
B00L5BXG36|1|Recieved a totally different product.
B00FQPOPNW|2|T'eo has this really nice, fresh citrussy scent.  It's exactly what I'd like a deodorant to smell like.  Unfortunately, it is not exactly how I want a deodorant to work.  One's armpits must be absolutely dry before using T'eo, as it's basically a bar of compact powder, otherwise the bar gets a gross layer of hardened powder on top and doesn't work.  It also has the potential to sting, especially after shaving (been there, done that).  Too much bother for me, and it wasn't really all that effective.
B008N3GTDS|5|great deal on a now hard to find item, thanks
B002N5MI2S|5|Excellent hold and manly smells lasts all day until you remove it showering but does the job!!!
B004BQGVK2|1|I have short hair...Cute item, but for gals with larger heads or long hair will benefit.  Prefer smaller shower bonnet with no brim.
B0037G4ROE|5|Hilarious and perfect for the office worker who likes a break from the usual Post-It notes.. Just be sure to not hand them in on those TPS reports
B00BB8JY20|5|It certainly does what it says it will. I am darker than ever and I am very fair when not tanning. Not too crazy about the fragrance but it does work.
B00KOUALMS|5|I have been using Kleem's Vitamin C Serum for a little over a month.  As a beauty blogger, I receive ton of products that work (some that don't) so when I receive a product I am totally critical.  I must say Kleem is one of the best Vitamin C Serums I have tried.  The serum has a great consistency, it is easy to spread on, dries quickly and is not greasy nor feels like it has left a residue.  It works great under moisturizers and regular makeup applications.  As far as results, the results are amazing.  My dark marks are fading, my pores seem smaller, and my overall skin just looks healthier and clear!  I seriously recommend this product and it has become a staple in my beauty regimen, and I recommend it to all my clients.
B0024H42E2|5|very nice smell
B000ACR93E|5|This product has been out longer than I can remember. My mom used to use it on sister and me. No fuss, no mess and especially no burning! And you know how some of things can make your head smell like your on fire , this doesn't. Trust me on that part, I live in Florida , lol . I'm really glad that it's still available on the internet at least. I have wavy baby fine hair it leaves it looking genetically straight, shiny and soft. No need for curlers , ceramic irons or blowers. I hope you have more in stock real soon!
B001M1JC6O|5|It was a replacement for an old one that died. Hubby is using it and has no complaints. He's especially loving it on these cool mornings.
B000BIZSYO|5|excellent shampoo performed as expected will order again when I can find it on the site do have to take time to find it
B00NP4YJG4|2|Not bad
B00EOB0042|5|haven't been able to find a natural deodarant that worked until now. I'm really impressed! Love this stuff!
B002757CS4|5|My hair was very thin in the front. I've been using this product for about 6 months now. I wash my hair every other day. But put the recovery serum on twice a day. I have lots of new hair coming back it. I am thrilled.
B000GCSD60|4|Great smell. I love it. But it doesn't last that long. I love lemon scent and it contains it.
B00A086MGI|5|I have ordered more - perfect!! Also given as gifts to my daughters. My makeup stays on all day!
B000C217U8|1|This perfume smells diluted. FAKE FAKE FAKE. I advice all amazon shoppers not to make an attempt to buy this fake diluted product
B00P1QC0Z6|4|Their ok.  Was hoping they were fluffier.
B00TUGVHHK|5|Greatest product ever!! Love it .. Not only do I use this in my highlights ( bleach) I use it as a stand alone for in between .. My hair is platinum bleach blonde.. It's never been in better condition.. Hair feels like silk.. Must try.. So worth it
B00HSE4WJG|5|These brushes are so good! Nice and soft no fallout. Would recommend!
B000B8YZQG|1|it made me itch on the areas I applied .<br />maybe, ok to other people but did not agree with me.<br />I tried to a play it several times just to see if it was a coincidence, but each time it made my arm itch.<br />I wasted my money, not sure about the return policy.
B001E96OE2|5|Amazing product! I have really dry hands in the winter, and this really works, I only need to apply it once or twice a day, and it works immediately!
B00KLJYTIY|5|I love this product!  It's exactly what I was looking for at a fabulous price!  It is light not sticky feeling, it is sheer but with more than enough colour.  I hate thick, goopy feeling lipsticks and this is the opposite to that.  Even if you have to apply it more often than the thick war paint out there, this feels great to wear.
B000BR766S|4|I like this shampoo and conditioner.  It makes my hair shine and feel like new everyday.  The only reason for four stars is because for my hair and I have straight hair, but it doesn't give a good detangler. I have to spend about 10 minutes brushing it out because it almost seemed to make my hair more tangled. I am not good with cosmetic products so there may be something that I missing. Anyways, I did enjoy the product.
B001E6KB4Y|1|I used this three times before it broke. Although it didn't give a very good shave, I tried to be fair and give it time, as the instructions said it took a couple of weeks for your face to adjust to the blade.    After three days it stopped working. I thought it needed to be recharged so I recharged it for a little over six hours (the instructions say charge it between five and seven hours). But the charge didn't help - it won't work at all. Not through batteries, and not through the power supply. I guess I could try to get back my money or else a replacement, but why bother?     Follow-up on 6/12/09:  I was mistaken: my claim of premature death was greatly exaggerated. In fact, it does work. When I pushed the lever all the way up to \\"On\\" to power the razor, it didn't work, but if I move the level slightly down, it does work. I apologize for this and would therefore raise my rating from one star to four stars if I could (but can't seem to do this) mainly based on the razor's portability and ease of use. The shave does actually get better through continued use and it also seems to work better if you don't press it too close to your face but let it glide over your skin. However, I doubt it would work very well with a heavy stubble -it seems best for light shaves. Still, it is great to be able to shave on the run - saves me a few minutes anyway.
B001QA2IB2|5|If you have curly dry hair you need to get under control, this is the product for you.  It helps with dry fly aways.
B008GOR6O0|5|I got this for my girlfriend.  The first time, it never arrived though it showed as being delivered.  They refunded my money.  The second one was great and I think this is kind of an amazing product for the price.  ($3.79)<br /><br />The matte black finish on the outside looks and feels sleek and modern and she uses this almost every morning for work.  I can't really speak toward the feel of the product on my face as I don't use it, but this looks and feels in your hand like a higher value set of makeup.
B00GTW0VUW|2|Hair does not actually stay in place.
B00DGRDQC8|1|This is the second item that I have bought in 8 years from Mangroomer company and the second time their products have been defective after I followed the instructions on how to charge it.  I suggest never buying this brand ever.  Mangroomer is a horrible product.  I bought from them again to see if they had fixed their issues but I was fooled twice now.  This product is crap, does not charge properly, breaks easily, and I highly recommend never purchasing this item.
B00899FAP4|1|I have done 4 bottles now after waxing my back but all the hair is growing back within 2-3 months. It was obvious that it was a scam but I thought that I would give it a try anyway because I couldn't find any bad reviews. But now I am warning you do not throw your money away on this crap, and all good reviews comes only from people who are involved in this scam buissnes.
B000ZPHQZM|5|My father used this and saw a noticeable difference in severely dried and cracked hands in as as little as a week. We tried everything before ordering this, and this worked better than anything else. Even better than anything the doctors prescribed! Great stuff!
B00112HQT4|5|Color was nice must most of all it does stay on my lips longer than my old stuff did. Didn't have a problem of lasting to long, just long enough.
B004KRVEKO|5|As a nail technician, I have found that this product is perfect because it doesn't chip easily.  It holds up to daily activities very well and strengthens nails with continued use.  Very difficult to find in stores at the present time.
B0081NLR8M|3|Did not repair much
B0010OKF7S|5|I've been using this hair spray for many years and would not change it for anything else. It just keeps your hair in shape in a soft and natural way.
B000C1Z19C|5|Pure was the only fragrance I would wear several years ago.  It got difficult to find so I switched to something else. But I am ecstatic that Amazon has it!  When I wore Pure, I got many compliments & was often asked what it was.  I fell in love with the scent when I found an advertising swatch inside a magazine.  I don't like anything heavy & musky, but I also don't want to smell like a rose garden.  This is a great fragrance regardless of your age.  Try it! (Also if you get a gift set that has the soap in it, put it the drawer with your \\"delicates\\".  It makes them smell wonderful.)
B007BLN17K|5|My daughter love them
B005FB8I94|3|The initial smell is kind of cheap and tacky, but once it dies down, it's pretty nice. It does keep your skin oily and moisturized though.
B004KJMAP0|5|good
B000143C0K|5|My goto clippers to shave my face every 2 or 3 days. Razors break my face out. Have your barber lineup the blade to get you a closer shave with the clippers.
B00TU2JZLE|5|I love this coconut  oil. You can use coconut oil to moisturize your skin, remove the make-up, it's  also a remedy for  small cuts..It's a must-have in my house. highly recommend it!
B006RFWFPK|5|I had seen the technique of cupping on a TV show, so ordered this set to give it a try.  I have some pain while using these, like some of the other reviewers talk about, but it seems to break up the cellulite and it gets absorb back into the body.  My thighs not look much smoother, and fell much better.  I am continuing to use these and recommend them to others.
B002FBT6M0|3|The base needs some weight to prevent it form being easily knocked over/falling over. Very top heavy. But can't hold bottles, so glad I purchased this nail polish holder. holds the bottles high enough to see a big drip coming to prevent it.
B00I3VHFA6|5|My wife loves it.
B000FS05VG|3|I purchased this dryer back in April of 2012. I set it aside until the dryer I was using at that time began to lose blowing power. That is the most important factor to me. With that, I was a tad disappointed in this dryer because from the onset it did not have the power that I like in a dryer. At this point it is even more sluggish. I am shopping for a new hair dryer, not a Revlon. It did the job, dried my hair but it was no better than OK.....
B0026IBSVE|5|Serves my purpose for a trim
B002I6FP9A|4|This fragrance has a sweet, violet fragrance that is not very strong, but is definitely pretty and understated. Like other Adidas fragrances, it's not an all-day lasting fragrance, but affordable enough to reapply often!
B004MTZV1S|5|I chose this train case because it was large enough to carry my makeup.  When I got it I fell in love with it! I had purchased another train case from another website and it was way too small and not good quality like this one.  This purchase was well worth it and it was cheaper than purchasing it in the store.
B00292BR9A|2|We bought this to replace an old Wahl clipper set.  It looked nice, felt nice to hold, and had a lot of accessories.  The battery needed to be charged for about a day, and then we used it the day after that.  The battery didn't hold the charge and sounded like it needed to be plugged in halfway through the haircut.  My husband was also disappointed that the clips weren't adjustable (His old one can be switched to a \\"closer\\" setting for each clip.)  The 1 and 2 clips were so different in length he had to cut his whole hair at a 1.  He ended up switching back to his old clippers.
B007XC9YQY|5|The brush by Emilio Pucci matched very nicely with my Guerlain Emilio Pucci designed meteorites/Illuminating Powder-Pure Radiance. GREAT BRUSH !!!
B00UV4AC30|3|Product is ok but you have to use a lot of the  product on the area around the nails.
B00J2APD0G|5|I have used the Gillette Mach III for many years and was ok with its performance. When I used the Gillette Fusion Proglide I received from Gillette, I was blown away by the difference in performance. It was a much smoother and closer shave. I was so impressed that I decided to try shaving with only hot water to see how that would be. Again, I was stunned with how it performed even without the aid of shaving gel. No nicks, cuts or scrapes, just a smooth shave. I would definitely recommend this product.
B004D04Q8U|1|This is not a lip balm or anything! it leaves chucks of the colors in my lips and it looks very bad. I am not sure what to think of it, I throw it out!
B00EV1ULB2|5|This soap lasts so long. One bar lasts about 2 months. I use the soap everyday. It has cleared up my skin & fixed a lot of hyper pigmentation I had during pregnancy.
B008LDFU26|5|I'm on day 5 of a free trial of this product. Take a look at my photo. This is only after 2 days! This stuff rocks. I am not only sold on the product but also the business plan.  I plan to become a Nerium Brand Partner ASAP!
B00BOJ9MIM|5|Also one more thing, try to change the name you listed as \\"Tabacco Vanille\\" to the correct \\"Tobacco Vanille\\". Consumers might think its false from the spelling. ;)
B00752ZD5I|5|I love these flex twist rods! I got these because I hate heat products and I like to have nice hair. My hair type is hard to describe, it's long. It's a mix between straight and Curly so I could wear it either way. It's not thin but it isn't too thick either. I only got one pack and it's all I need. I separated my layers and did three on each side of my head and it came out very pretty. I youtubed videos on how to use these but I ended up doing it my own way. Maybe if you want extra big hair you may want more rods. I doubt these work for short hair. My hair turned out very beautiful. If you want natural looking loose curls I feel like these are the way to go.
B00161JJK4|5|I've used this product for a year now and so glad I found it. It corrects my skin tone and helps make-up smooth on easily and evenly. I have dry, often flaky skin and without the photo finish primer, my make-up used to apply unevenly and clog up in crevices, but this gives me a smooth finished look.
B00KF996T2|5|as described, thanks!
B000GLRREU|5|Great product.
B0085RZLVS|2|Does a poor job of cleaning . The Flosser requires a great deal of effort to obtain minimal results of cleanliness.
B002WLWX82|5|I love this machine.  I have been wanting one for a very long time and am completely satisfied with this machine.
B004L5Y5C4|5|I love this hairspray!  I have been gradually changing my body care products over to natural and organics and I decided it was time to try it for my hair care as well.  I have been using salon products for years and have a hard time finding products that work as well as they do.  I stumbled upon yarok on the Amazon website and decided to give it a try.  It holds well, smells great, and lasts all day.  I only wish it weren't so expensive.  But as I don't have to use much, it should last a while - and my health is worth the expense in the long run.
B001V2XMOW|5|This product works very well I've only used it a couple of times but I love it! I was using designer skin Halo lotion with tingle but after a while it wasn't working for me anymore so I thought I'd give this one a try and the tingle is HOT it lasted for like two hours whereas the other one I was using stopped working. I was also a lot darker with just a couple of tans. I love this product and I would recommend it to experienced tanners that use tingle products.
B0088D9R5K|5|I use these to fit the 9 1/2&#34; opening on both ends of my telescope.  I have the cap for it, but it still collects dust inside.  These work very well for this.
B009XRM1QW|5|I have just past should length hair that is very fine straight on top and curl from the ears down.  It has been a struggle all my life until my atitude about my hair changed & just accepted that I'd always look like a I had a growing out perm.  This product is the perfect weight for my hair - it is light enough to not weigh it down, yet strong enough to hold the curl or wave (day depending ) all day without looking crispy or drying out my hair.  I wash, condition, & rinse well with my head upside down with whatever shampoo & conditioner I have chosen from my stash, then brush right side up & blow dry the bangs.  I only slightly dry the longer hair scrunching my hair as I do that, then when my hair is about 1/4-1/2 way dry I use only one pump of this product rubbed between my hands & scrunch it into my curly hair.  I do use a clip to hold my hair up for a while which probably also helps the curl of the day.  LOVE IT!!
B005TJ8WSY|3|The price was to high I could of got a bigger bottle for cheaper price but it's good conditioner
B000H4EI4S|4|I like it, can't say I love it as I expected it to be a little hotter than it is. The good thing about this hair dryer, different than the others I had, is the weight. If you are doing your own hair with a brush and taking your time you don't want to end up with a sore shoulder. Makes a huge difference!
B001PUP3JM|5|Love this night cream. Smells nice, is not greasy and does it job.
B000L596FE|5|I don't usually take time to write reviews, but this product is amazing. I have three little girls and long thick hair myself. It just combs right through the knots. We use it on wet hair or just wet the brush for great results.
B00IALDHDI|4|A good mascara is a necessity for every girl so getting it to try for free from Influenster is amazing. I was surprised how big the tube is but I also feel it's a good value with the 2 different looks you can get from this product. It held up to my expectations as far as waterproof goes. I wasn't a raccoon after getting caught in the rain, it was smooth going on and easy to take off.
B005DKKBTC|5|Been using electric shavers for 30 years. This is the closest yet.
B005F7IWFI|1|These were purchased to do eyelash extensions. They are plastic like and cheap just thew them away.
B000C1Z192|5|Really nice
B0001EKYL0|5|I have never used a line of this product yet that I haven't seen results............ Highly recommend.
B007OU499W|5|Curling iron has different sizes for your days preference. Your hair stays curly even after sleeping on it. Love it!!
B00GOBPDAG|5|It came on time and it is quiet and works fast. My boy really needs it.
B001LQY1X4|5|Cheap and enough for normal use.
B00I92N6UM|2|I returned the item and replaced with one not lighted.  The light coloring was too blue tinted and made applying makeup difficult.
B00194GUZA|5|Love this product.  Cleared my elbows--- doctors could never seem to have the answer.  Started using very diligently for<br />approximately three weeks. It has cleared up took two bottles.  Sounds expensive but I have spent for several years never<br />any results.  My niece told me about the product.  Works great!!!!  Do not purchase the cheaper oils made out of USA<br />not the same!!!  This is a great product for insect bites etc.
B002R2E16S|1|My skin broke out. White heads surrounding my ink. Could be a mixture of product irritation and irritation from the dry shave. I tried this after Tattoo Goo irritated me. Soap and lotion for me now.
B004UL0GTK|3|makes my hair really dark looking
B007VSVNQO|5|I've had mine since late 2011 bought at Target on sale. It's been used and abused multiple times - I vacuum every other day on a rotating room schedule with two cats and a dog it gets every other day, vacuumed out my SUV after camping multiple times, picked up stuff \\"professional\\" vacuums didn't, I've moved twice and had to do a complete home run without issue. I brought it over to a friends who's vacuum stopped working and they were amazed by how good it worked.<br /><br />I do disassemble mine every other month and do a full cleaning of the internal parts, HEPA and other pieces to ensure it keeps working. It takes less than 15 minutes to soak them in hot water and a drop of dishwashing liquid in a bucket. I'm not sure about the negative experiences / reviews. I can only speculate that either people are NOT maintaining it properly which would explain early failure (the six month people) or perhaps the newer models are made someplace different now with lower quality control, maybe in China?<br /><br />Personally I don't know, but I know I love mine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) So far it works like a champ (For under $100 over 3 years - Plus one star)<br />2) The suction is really strong (NOTE you need to keep the filters clean and can emptied)<br />3) It's be fairly durable, surviving 2 moves, a fall down the stairs and other mishaps<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) The can is small and needs to be emptied a lot. SERIOUSLY A LOT!<br />2) Also the power-wand part is completely useless for anything (Minus one star) other attachments are okay.<br />3) VIP - If you do not keep the filters clean and free of caked on dust the unit will overheat. I am assuming this maybe leading to motor burnout for some of the other people.<br /><br />Note: I did drop the can part on concrete when emptying it a few months back and the flap is cracked which makes it harder to empty, but it still works and maintains suction pressure.
B00593ESW4|3|I love Rimmel's Stay Glossy Lip Gloss and have it in so many colors, but this one is not my favorite.<br />All of the glosses in this line are easy to apply, feel non-sticky and last for a relatively long time. They usually have a great color.<br />This color is a shade of grey that looks a bit washed out, not as sparkly and fun as the other ones. Definitely wouldn't call it &#34;Black Diva&#34;... You could wear it over a strong colored lipstick, I guess, but if you prefer the lightweight feel of a lip gloss, then this may not be your favorite... I bought it for special occasions, hoping for an edgier look, but this one is not it.
B00DYHA3J4|3|Great design and fit well the face but it brook easy.
B00GTAZPFK|5|Happy to see Amazon has my normal shade.<br /><br />It's perfect.
B007WS1GQA|5|Great product, but since I am a tall gal with lengthy finger, the short tabs are too small.  Why don't they have them in medium, as other vendors do?They would be perfect.
B000GKJRSU|2|Although the shampoo was unscented and without sulphates, it left a residue on my hair.  I have thick hair so this was problem.
B006319L8C|4|My hair is getting stronger with each use.
B00GD854L8|5|Very convenient to save time in applying shampoo and conditioner separately.  It also seems very effective in stopping dandruff.  A little goes a long way and I would certainly purchase again to kill two birds with one stone.
B000RI6RIE|5|THIS IS THE BEST SMELLING AND THE CREAMIEST SHOWER WASH THAT I HAVE EVER TRIED. IT TAKES SUCH A SMALL AMOUNT TO HAVE YOURSELF COVERED WITH A CONDITIONING CREAM AND AFTER YOU DRY YOURSELF YOUR SKIN FEELS AS IF YOU JUST APPLIED LOTION. I ALSO LOVE THE FACT THAT IM USING A 100% NATURAL PRODUCT ON MYSELF AND MY WHOLE FAMILY. MY HUSBAND HAS SUFFERED FOR YEARS WITH CRACKED SKIN ON HIS HANDS, HIS FINGERS WOULD BLEED. BUT NOW THAT I CHANGED TO OUT OF AFRICA PRODUCTS HE HASNT HAD A SINGLE FLAIR UP.  THANK YOU OUT OF AFRICA FOR YOUR WONDERFUL PRODUCTS!
B000XTFP0I|5|Great Price and Fast Delivery!
B00IYMJCL4|5|the directions are really vague.<br />-- &#34;apply evenly to hair&#34;.<br />how much? do I have to apply while hair is wet?<br />I've looked all over for a review on this product.<br />couldn't find one so I decided to review it.<br /><br />I was given this at Sally's Beauty Supply as a member perk.<br />I put a dime sized amount to my hair after getting out of the shower. Distribute evenly, smells great!<br />when my hair dries it feels soooo soft and manageable. I recommend this for anyone who needs a little something extra to protect from the elements. (styling, over washing, coloring, harsh weather) it's weightless and doesn't buildup.
B00LH2BROS|5|Cute Designs (:
B00021AWV4|5|Been in love with Insense for a long time. So glad I've found it at a good price. I'll be buying more soon.
B002QG6P9G|5|This is the best product I have found yet for my hair.  It makes it so soft and so shiny and not oily at all.  Plus, it smells great.
B001RVJBD8|5|This smell so good a must have it is light and last all day I will recommend to all my friends
B0009MFUPO|5|very good product it works great product I started to have problems with the original that came with the shaver but I bought this one put it in and it was like brand new
B001KYQ3DS|5|Bought this as a bronzer brush and it holds the bronzer really well! Blends really nice on my face and feels soft and smooth!
B00CDDNQDA|1|It's so hard to put these on. I recommend the sticker oned
B0086VIA3O|5|Came faster than expected which is always nice.
B008FXFH66|4|great little product for the price.
B0036YMVEU|3|The term 'mascara' should not be in the name of this product.  It does tint the eyelashes, but it does not take the place of mascara.  Great marketing - so when you read 25 applications, you think - 28 day mascara and 25 applications!! wow it's worth it.  No, it isn't.
B00FFAMYW2|5|Great product.
B001ET76CQ|5|Every so often my teeth get sensitive to cold drinks.  Thank heavens it is not all the time but when it happens I start brushing with Sensodyne® toothpaste and it really works.  It takes about a week or two but the sensitivity begins to diminish and eventually stops.<br /><br />My dentist recommended this to me years ago and I always have some on hand.  I don't have to use it all the time as my sensitivity does go away but if I had to use this toothpaste all the time I wouldn't mind.  It works well, cleans my teeth properly and will freshen your mouth.<br /><br />I recommend this if you are having issues with cold, hot, or sweet drinks!
B00006FRW9|5|It works great and leaves your skin clean and soft. It clears skin and removes makeup easy. I love it better than the clothes.
B006GQYSC8|5|I have very tough whiskers and relied on hot water, shave cream and a razor for years. Very time consuming. This gives me a very close and comfortable shave in no time at all.<br /><br />For those clueless individuals who have downgraded it for the battery life here's how it works: unplug it, shave, clean it out, and plug it in until next time. Problem solved.
B000VUO8VG|5|This moisturizer is the best overnight treament for AA hair. Prevents breakage and does not over moisturize so hair still has body.
B004H3QCPS|5|Slowly fades scars.  Just started using for a week so too soon to tell.
B0027WPJRI|2|For the price I really expected more, was disappointed and won't be buying this product again. Too much money for doing nothing.
B009HVG6KQ|5|Love it!!  great price, and a really nice scent.
B009AVFFWI|3|I am a Yes to Carrots fan from long back. But this particular formula has a kind of medicinal smell. Still say Yes to Carrots - just NO to this one.
B000NB5AWY|5|Love this soap! It smells so good!
B004ISZWLC|1|I have very curly hair and this product did nothing to control my curls and just left my hair frizzy. Will never buy again.
B00CUCNID2|1|I rate this a 5 star because over all it's a nice wig . The price was good and i got exactly what's on the picture. I wasn't happy about 2other wigs I bought .this is the best one so far !!
B006GKHIHQ|5|love them
B000143C0K|5|Cuts well fresh out the box. The motor could be a little stronger but it is a great addition to my collection.
B001U9M2EW|5|Works very well , Just don't over apply.<br />takes out the frizz and my hair never looked better<br /><br />Thank you for the product !
B00VUGXD8O|5|Great communication response. Great accommodation, the inches is order was out of stock but instead I was given 12,16,16. I order on a Thursday and received my order by Monday. The hair is very soft and beautiful. Great appreciated it well purchase in the near future.
B007HU6ND4|5|Best compact powder blush on the planet. They don't make it any more.
B001E95G6Y|1|This thing cost me fourteen bucks in the beauty supply and it is garbage. I knew that other clairol color was bad but I thought this product would be different. It didn't even get my roots. I have 3 toned hair! I feel so cheated. I've bought less harmful and more effective products than this garbage. The order of ammonia was so strong that I had could not breathe and had to hold my breath or step out the bathroom. It said nothing about being that harmful on the eyes and nose. I had trouble applying, but when you pay 14$ for something you use it. It never even tingled or itched my scalp and that was after forty whole minutes of waiting for it too. I had black dark brown hair and now have yellow brown and copper hair. Bleaches the darkest of hair my ass. This thing suxxxx.  I should've never been unfaithful to my l'oreal. The only thing that can save me is going black and I really wanted to be blonde:(
B003YJAZZ4|5|very good
B001GS6OB4|5|Awesome epilator. Quick and very effective.
B005TA8RV0|5|The package shown in Amazon's picture has the colors in the wrong order and so they are mis-labelled:<br />* \\"Wocka-wocka\\" is in the correct slot and is an opaque red/magenta.<br />* \\"Designer...de Better!\\" is a silver paint with a smattering of pink glitter.  It's the second from the left in the picture shown.  \\"Designer...de-better!\\" is a denser glitter coat as opposed to the sparkle polishes in the rest of the Muppets collection (e.g., \\"Rainbow Connection\\", \\"Fresh Frog of Bel Air\\"). It is nearly opaque with one coat and fully opaque with two.<br />* \\"Excuse moi\\" is incorrectly slotted in the picture; it's actually the pink glitter color shown in the far right in the picture.  \\"Excuse moi\\" is pink paint with pink glitter throughout.  It is nearly opaque with one coat and fully opaque with two, like \\"Designer...de Better!\\".<br />* Finally, \\"Warm & Fozzie\\" is a rich and light brown color with gold and brown glitter.  It's the third from the left (or second from the right) in the picture shown.<br /><br />As far as the colors they picked for this mini-collection, I'm actually a little disappointed.  The Muppets collection includes several sparkle coats that are awesome, specifically [[ASIN:B005R4TO6K Rainbow Connection]], [[ASIN:B002IFHVMA Fresh Frog of Bel Air]], [[ASIN:B002HXX7WQ Gone Gonzo!]], [[ASIN:B005RFI1YK Divine Swine]], and [[ASIN:B005SH0PLE Gettin' Miss Piggy with It]].  Of the group of colors in this mini-collection, I like \\"Warm & Fozzie\\" and \\"Designer...de Better!\\" the best.  A layer of any of the sparkle coats over \\"Designer...de Better!\\" is really pretty.<br /><br />If you're the kind of person that constantly wants a new nail color, the mini-collections by OPI (like this one) are perfect.  If you're like me, you rarely use a bottle of nail polish more than once or twice.  In that case, you'll have plenty in each of these bottles.  I have yet to make one of them run out.  The one complaint I have is that the applicator brush in the mini-bottles is not the same level of quality as OPI's brushes usually are.  What I suggest is, before you throw away an old bottle of OPI, take out the brush and clean it thoroughly with acetone.  Then, you can use that brush with your mini-bottles and just clean it with nail polish remover after each use.  That way you can get the full coverage of the normal OPI brush while using your (cheaper) mini-polishes.<br /><br />For holiday gifts, it's a great idea to buy these mini-collections and break them up to distribute to a group or use as stocking stuffers.  I do that every year for the women in our family, and we all trade the colors around until we each have ones we like. Keep in mind, though, that the individual mini bottles are not labelled, so people won't know what color they have.  You might want to use a gift tag to label the bottles for your recipients in that case.PI's brushes usually are.

B00138VIOK|5|I've only used this for my arms, so I can't say how it works for other areas.  Also, I have not tried other creams so I cannot say how it compares to other products.<br />But for arms, this thing was great.  I was able to mix cream and smear it on both of my arms, and still have plenty in 1 bottle for a couple more applications.  It only stung my arms a little toward the last minute. I followed the requirements and wiped it off exactly when it said.  My hair was bleach blonde the night before my vacation.  No red on my arms the next morning!  I loved it.  It's now 3 weeks after my vacation and many of the hairs are still blonde.  I will be using this again because it works and makes my arms appears as if I have do not have arm hair. Thumbs up.
B00K2AU3PU|3|Don't let the lack of thick & creamy fool you! With this lotion, less is more & you can almost feel it absorbing into your skin. A double coverage leaves you feeling soft, fresh & pretty! Noticeable difference in lines/wrinkle appearance after two days!
B00SJL6J8E|2|Wish I could say I saw a difference. Tried it a week later, same results. Nothing.
B0081PFD2Q|5|Easy to apply, I use as is, or as a topper over a darker lipstick.  Smooth.
B001CRZUXC|5|This is a wonderful product it smooths the surface of your face and neck. I live in a very dry climate but this plus the other Signiture A products has finally given me hope...Thank you
B003RJ165Y|5|Great for your skin snd smells great
B0015TG1JE|5|Bismoline powder is the best powder on the market.
B000AUIFCA|5|this works to clean my teeth.  Ill buy it again.  the yellow pieces are hard plastic, but i don't notice it when i brush my teeth.
B0002Q8W9I|4|Nice base coat. My nails chip very quickly, so I'm always looking for the best base coat I can to help remedy that. Although it wasn't a miracle cure to my nail chipping (I'm not sure if anything will ever be), it did help in preventing major chips. For anybody who isn't hard on their nails, this would probably work much better for them.
B004HZS0B0|5|I have used Hempz products including the regular lotions for any years, their line of products are excellent. Would recommend these products for all.
B0050QJHTO|5|AWESOME!!
B006ZN1B1S|5|Fabulous product ! I have really thin hair and  Tried a lot of thickening products and love this one . Worth the money !
B000RKZ5F8|5|This lotion was recommended by a cousin who is a dermatologist while washing dishes on Christmas Eve. She uses it and I needed it. I couldn't find it in stores and the docs get it from their drug rep, but it is worth buying through Amazon.  Non greasy!! Really.  Thick and helps my dry winter hands so much more than any of the other high end lotions I've bought.
B003F2T0M4|4|It is a great tool to add to my arsenal of styling aides that I use as a professional hair styles.
B003U8ESI4|4|Some hair fall but most of it get sucked. But its awesome (not water resistance).
B00DGW9ODS|4|I found it moisturizing, but the texture was a bit too runny for me.  I think this problem came about after I had it for a while, but I just prefer lotions with a thicker consistency.
B001QXBWY8|5|I've always loved Estee Lauder Youth Dew and worn it for years. It was nice to be able to save a few dollars by buying a tester. I couldn't even tell it was a tester. It was full and had the lid. Great buy and quick delivery!
B00C55ONAQ|5|Excellent
B004VBISXU|5|my favorite razor, love the longer handle, I don't like the shorter handle razors for some reason, just got used to longer handles I guess, I'm 5'10&#34; so not like I'm a 7' giant.  I was a little surprised at the rake edge that goes across the face, my other razors are flat edge all the way under the blade edge, don't know why it's designed that way, perhaps to allow closer shave, which it does do.  You can feel the rake tips going over the skin, but it's not a problem.  I like the screw in handle and solid top rather than the butterfly opening razors, this one holds the blade in place, very few moving parts, easy to clean, no hinges to get gunked up, just my preference.
B000RDHLKW|4|I have found the gel pads to be much better in support than the older style foam pads. These are very easy to clean after each wearing.
B004BIZ69W|5|They must have improved the brush that many of these reviews complain about because this is a very delicate one. It is soft but it is easy to use and works for lining and details like cat eyes. It is also a shorter brush for control. Great texture on the liquid also, amazing pigment! Doesn't smear easily and dries very fast
B002SZO5LU|5|Looks GREAT! Only issue it that it sheds a lot of hair.
B001LFK0RG|5|Will order more.  Love this cream.  From the old days of youth.
B005D5LFVU|2|Product was nice for the price, but poor packaging. When I opened my package the oil leaked out of the bottle and was all over the other products.
B00FZGZ79I|5|Stays on feet with out leaving residue on bottom of feet! they come wrapped as a pair...very professional packaging!
B0010Y1KYA|4|I have always had issues when it came to shaving.  I suffered from razor bumps on my neck and some ingrown hairs.  I've used fancy disposable razors like Mach 5, then switch to an expensive electric razor, and still had the same problem.  I finally decide to go old school and try a safety razor.  I receive the package promptly as expected, it was fulfilled by amazon after all.  It was well packaged.  The razor, bowl, brush, and stand all look great and have a good weight to them.  The soap was an almond scent and smelt great.  I never used shaving soap before but I've gotta say it's not too bad at all.  The razor shaved great, very smooth, and so far no bumps.  It will take a little getting used to if you currently use a disposable razor.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that the brush was not the quality I was expected.  Some of the hairs started to come out after the first use.  I had to purchase another higher quality one.  However, overall it was a great purchase.
B001B2RRRU|4|I use WEN Lavender Hair Cleansing Con, and thought I would try this.  It is nice to add to loction, but I would not use on my hair.  it is a bit much.
B008B2Z94Q|4|Small but durable and does it job
B005MR89L8|5|Went natural three years ago. A lot of curly hair which challenged me. Frizz was a major consideration. Stumbled on this product and WOW!!!!!!. Don't have to wet my hair everyday. Hair is soft and moisturized.
B00AWR9HGO|4|Good product.
B0046VGPHQ|4|This is the best tanning product I've used so far. The only downside is it's really intense, and easy to mess up. There is a right & wrong way to do it... I get the best results when I exfoliate for a few days before using it & the day of, then use it after taking a shower in the evening & putting on NO lotions or anything [except for a little argan oil or something like that on my elbows, knees, ankles and face]. I would never go out in public directly after applying it, it gets SUPER dark and SUPER intense brown/orange right away, so I go to bed like 30 minutes after applying it, let it deepen overnight, and then when I wash it off in the shower it looks amazing like a real tan! Just be careful not to rub your face, especially around the mouth area. I gave myself a five o' clock shadow the first time I used it lol. Overall it's a pretty great product & I'll be using this for a while.
B0079R6BD2|4|I really love this shampoo! After only 3 washes I feel like so much less hair is coming out!
B002PBEBPM|3|I personally did not like this product, although I do like their powder. I don't need that much coverage, so this was probably a bad decision to buy it on my part (but I wanted to try it out). It came of easily whenever I touched my face or anything brushed it. The first day I wore this product, my sister commented that I looked really pale, like I was sick, not something that I wanted to hear. The color just did not seem to be the same as the powder. The roller applicator is only good for maybe your cheeks and forehead, but incredibly difficult if not impossible to use around your nose and eyes. I'm not going to waste it and throw it away, but I do not believe that I will be buying this again.
B0085RZLQ8|5|I made the mistake of purchasing the generic heads and they were garbage, ended up throwing them away.  Stick with the Philips brand heads. I LOVE my Sonicare toothbrush.
B00B0RHZQ4|3|I works like any other shampoo, I feel this is nothing special. Was hoping it was like it use to be but don't think so
B001BR2OGE|5|Is the Aftershave that I have used for many years. Perfect for me.
B00538TSMU|1|Maybe it's just me, but they don't seem to be lasting very long. however it is a good thing that there is 20 pairs.
B002QI2TPI|1|Very small size, and my kit was broken in pieces when I got it. Very unhappy
B000C1ZDVS|5|The product is fine, but it doesn't come in the short, flat-top bottle as shown in the photo.  Instead, it is the full, tear-drop shape as seen here:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000JR4UQ4/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i00<br /><br />So if you are ordering this, thinking it's something different, it's not.  Also, it's 3.3 oz, not 3.4.
B00008BFXL|1|i must have somehow got 'knock offs'!?!?<br />the first one out of the package made a real loud noise but the brush didn't move!  the second one in the pack malfunctioned quickly.  the magnet rusted, not something that happens to the real sonicare heads, and the brush didn't move much.  how did that happen?!<br />when i get these at the drug store, i love em, they work well for ages.
B001J6O12W|3|Easy to replace the old foil and blade set with the new one. Works okay on short hair but takes a few more passes on longer leg and underarm hair. Not as comfortable as a disposable razor but there are no painful nicks. Price is high as the replacement costs almost as much as buying a replacement razor.
B000VIBPXW|1|...it's against Arbonne's policies and procedures to sell it's products on Amazon.  They are only available through the network of Arbonne independent consultants.  I'd be concerned at the freshness of this product.  If someone is willing to take part in unauthorized sale of a product, I'd be concerned about when and where they got it.  Got to Arbonne's website and Also, this particular product has been discontinued.  It is available on the website and discontinued when gone.  I wonder if this unauthorized seller has back stock that they are trying to clear out?  Buyer beware!!!
B0081PEO0S|2|I love the product, but it took way too long to get here. I might as well go to Sephora and pick it up in person, I suppose. I just hate going in there sometimes... there's so many expensive temptations.
B000JL7WQK|5|Perfect.  Exactly what I ordered.
B000C1W70S|5|I have been using YSL Paris Eau De Toilette since 1986 and this is my favorite potency - The Parfume; (more powdery) is not my personal taste - The Eau De Toilette; is more lively, crystal clear and tenderly pretty and lasting - Full of roses and violets, well blended with ripe berries, all wrapped in vinyl - I will always remember the first time I smelled YSL Paris Eau De Toilette and it will always be at the top of my list
B00BWD00CM|4|I used the product alone consistently for over a year back in 2011 when my hair fell out after surgery in Oct 2010. I did not notice any new growth until after 3 months but I kept taking the product consistently and saw a lot of new growth. I had to get my hair cut because the ne growth made me look like I had a helmet head, but it did grow back. I underwent 2 more surgeries a year ago and my hair fell out again. I'm about to start the program again with hopes that it continues to do the job. But it worked for me, so I will continue to use it.
B001E5E29K|5|My Dad's favorite for years. Very happy I could fine just the aftershave without having to buy other items along with it that he won't use. Delivered right away and the packaging was great.
B0000ZLEKK|1|This has absolutely no honeysuckle scent to it at all.  So if you are looking for that clean sweet smell, don't bother with this stuff.
B000NL0T1G|5|Do you go to the store and shudder at the price for razor blades or disposables?<br />Get one of these and a pack of blades.  It saves you money in the long run and works just as well if not better than what you're getting from the store. I have very thick facial hair and this just glides through.<br />Get yourself some shaving soap, a bowl, and a boar hair brush and you're set.  There is something nice about an old school shave.
B000PXYAJ4|2|The dryer works great, although I would have liked to use it safely at both speeds.<br />Note that (according to the instructions) the dryer switch must be in and remain in the \\"low\\" operating position when using 250 volts... Too bad!
B004Y9H1QO|4|Came in on time. Was very good yet I dont like how it turns my lips red.
B00410B5A4|3|Do not go for it because of the low price, to me at first sounded to good to be true but I went for it. The scent does not last at all & honestly does not smell what it has been advertised & smell like cheap over the counter fragrance. I know the type  of skin & chemistry of body effect is different, I am crazy a bout perfumes & spend lots of  money on them & kind of can tell what is worth or not. But it is ur choice & I just wanted to share my experience with u all, good luck!!!!!
B000L978FU|5|HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT IN THE PAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO.  IT IS GREAT AND DOES NOT LEAVE A STAIN.  PERFECT FOR TRAVELING WITH.
B007FWEDQ8|5|Arrived on time, Very good package and easy to open.<br />Good and rich foam. I feel my face really clean after.<br />I am very happy I bought this Cleanser and I truly recommend it
B0009MFUOA|4|Easy to use, holds a long charge, easy cleaning and storage for a cheap price
B001AZWCF0|3|Expensive for what it is.  Basic functional design.  The handles of newer razors are too big to fit.  The quality of the metal and manufacturing is fine.
B002QIEI8O|4|Bought as a present, I think he must have enjoyed it, have heard no complaints
B0046NG48E|2|Every time my stylist does my hair, she finishes w this product, and it looks amazing, and every time I try to replicate and I end up looking like Ethan Hawke in Reality Bites. I LOOK GREASY, PEOPLE! It's disgusting. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. Maybe I'm using too much, but obviously I'm inept and unable to use this spray can of oil correctly.<br /><br />So maybe steer clear of this or be better at application than me. I admit, I am no hair professional.
B0018CEDVQ|5|The way this incense smells is heavenly. It's rich, has tonality and burns cleanly. Like other incenses made by Auroshikha, this incense contains no glue or charcoal, and the scents are fully real (no synthetic phony perfumes added like cheap incenses.)<br /><br />The vanilla \\"true to nature\\" incense from Auroshikha is just divine, the smell is so sweet, lingers around for a while, and helps create a pleasant setting.  (I use it for enhancing the sensuous qualities of a room, or for celebrating special days, or when preparing sweets in the kitchen).<br /><br />Simply, a must-buy :)! This is what people should be burning instead of the acrid synthetic \\"glade\\" or febreeze. It's also so visually engaging and pleasant to have around, lit next to a candle, in the bathroom, or wherever, always uplifts me.<br /><br />5/5 stars
B00Q301WXK|4|seems to tighten skin - don't know if the retinol is the strength that is stated or if my skin is just adjusted to retinol from using Neutrogena retinol - thought this retinol would be stronger than Neutrogena, but don't know - like the product for the vitamin c
B00GQJKPJU|5|These are great for traveling!
B00019DTOY|5|the clippers are great, but the seller put misinformation on the web, it said it had two sets of blades one for cutting and one for shaving on a shaving blade came
B003V265QW|4|It really works... Just watch out cuz u will burn ya skin off quick lol
B00021C1NG|5|This product came in a very timely manner and was excellently packaged.  I also love the feel of my skin after using it.
B008EWH9MI|5|These Flexi Rods Gives Me  Perfect Big And Juicy Curls.  The Rods Arent Hard to use , I Recommend You Place the Rod Under The Hair Youre Wrapping , And When You Finish , Fold It Up Into A &#34;U&#34; Shape.  Crossing the Ends Almost Like A Circle And They Should Stay Put 😊
B00K5RZIKA|5|Very well made tools! Love it.
B000FLUDBK|5|I purchased this for my wife even though it says it's a man's cologne. We both love it on her.
B001H3ZUKE|2|I tried this as a teenager and it didn't work very well but thought I'd try again as an adult but still no results after using it for 3 months.
B000GG146C|1|Contains parabens, which the EU believes to be cancer linked.
B000E80EB8|5|perfect color and application control
B002D463HA|5|Awesome product but be careful. Start slow and work your way up to recommended dosage.
B009P6D5LG|5|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  The quality seems durable.  The design is adorable.  I recommend it!
B000C1ZDTU|5|Have worn this perfume for a long time. Love it! Fresh clean scent, not overwhelming. Received my order quickly and am very pleased.
B00GGZR9ZW|5|I love this!!! The color is true to the picture. It looks so rich.
B0000535UN|5|I use both the shampoo and conditioner.  They really do make your hair thicker.  And your hair feels great.  Buy it, you'll love it.
B0037LMKF2|4|Pros:<br />It's sheer,lightweight,fast absorbing,unscented, non greasy but moisturizing,with helioplex in it.<br />Cons:<br />small tube only 1.7 oz., comparatively too expensive at $16.26 and only SPF50.<br />I prefer Neutrogena Sport Face Sunblock lotion SPF70 2.5 oz.for $9.92.
B00NT8DMZU|5|Amazing
B000141G94|5|This goes on smooth, and the green tea is soothing. I really like that it has SPF so I can prevent further damage to scarred skin. I think it would work better if I had the patience to rub it in for the 2-3 minutes as recommended, but I am seeing results even without doing that. It works the best on newer scars.
B004TA8DR4|4|Product came on time, but not sure it is helping with my hair loss.  I still see a ton of hair in my sink, unfortunately.  Will keep trying.  Have only been using it for a couple of weeks.
B009LNYSIM|5|Can's stop using this product, especially on my lips.  It keeps my lips SUPER moisturized.  I also placed some drops in my night time moisturizer & I love the feel of that on my skin as well!  I think this is a fabulous product!  I've heard complaints about it;s scent, but the scent does not bother me at all!  LOVE LOVE LOVE and VERY highly recommend!
B000EZYKTS|3|This product was too painful for me to use as an epilator.  HOwever as just a regular razor it's fine, but the real delight is the built in light.  Find haris you didn't even know you had.
B000VI1190|5|These are a much higher quality than I expected.  The lids screw on very smoothly & the plastic is quite thick.
B000O2TBEK|5|I love this product and came back for second order after receiving great value and service on my first order.
B000K7H1Y6|1|This didn't fit well on my head; the teeth don't go flat into my hair, so it didn't really grab my hair the way I wanted it to. It felt precarious, not solidly in my hair.
B00HYEXLNS|2|does not work on me.
B005605A9A|3|I had done a lot of research on this product and although the jar is small you get a large amount with one swipe. The color isnt dark enough to cover my scars but i like to use it on my face. It doesnt make it look flawless but it a big improvement from no make up or my other foundations. Its not creamy like i thought it would be but it decent as a face foundation.
B007ADJZC4|5|Moisture for very dry skin without being greasy
B0026QQDMK|1|I LOVE this brand of soap, but do not buy from this seller.  What I ordered (according to the description listed here) was a glass bottle of the Figue soap, with a pump as shown.  My soap showed up in a cheap plastic bottle, no pump and the inside of the box was all soapy from a broken seal. I'm so sad, its going back today.
B006L1DNWY|5|These arrived quicker than expected. Only one of them was bent. Good deal for the price.
B009CRUAXE|5|I bought two of these for my daughters for Christmas, they love it, and it was at a good price
B00017OV9S|4|I use this to clean my face with a cotton ball.  It is supposed to be stronger than the other commercial types of witch hazel.  I'm happy with it.
B004EDDTVG|3|I as hoping for a few  bubbles....none.
B00J4WT8NA|4|i think i got this last month and until now im still using it.. its nice it makes my skin smoother.
B00EVV29RG|5|Love them! They don't tear up your gums while cleaning your teeth and they don't fall apart like other natural bristle brushes.
B009374CAU|5|Boys will be boys and my nephew is definitely an angry bird kind of kid and loves every angry bird product !
B00C8YCFU4|5|In love with this mask. Will definitely buy more in the future. Great product and I highly reccommend
B001B0YMB6|5|I needed a place to get ready in the morning, due to a small bathroom in current apartment. This works very well and keeps everything organized and easy to get to. I was very suprised about how big this actually was. I thought it was going to be smaller. I got it based on the price and other reviews. It's very heavy and sturdy too. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs one.
B00HQNEB04|5|Having alopecia  spots, I have tried alot of products this is by far the most natural looking.<br />Alittle bit goes along way.
B005JZB84I|4|I have fine, 3a/3b naturally curly hair, and I regularly use gels or creams to define and hold my curls throughout the day. When I first used this gel, I used it on day 3 hair and it seemed to dry out my hair and it made my hair frizzier. I gave it another try on freshly washed hair and it gave me the best hair day that I’ve had in a long time. With learning this, I only apply the gel on my freshly washed hair, under a leave-in, serum, or oil, and while my hair is still damp. It provides great hold and definition without getting crunchy or flaky. I don’t like gels that are too strong, and this one is perfectly light; it gives just enough hold, but I do use a lot despite what the directions say (use a small amount) since I have long hair.<br /><br />This gel is just like most gels, but not very watery; it’s a little thick in consistency and the gel is blue. I really like the ingredients added, and I like how they put a quick note on some of the listed ingredients to be a little more informative. The bottle is a decent size and can last a long time since I only use it on wash day, so maybe 2 days out the week. This says it has a fragrance in it made with essential oils, but I don’t smell any at all. It just smells like gel with no added scent, just straight gel; it doesn’t smell bad, it’s just plain. I add a little bit of orange essential oil to give it a light orange scent.
B00HH3W1IC|1|I love this bronzer !!!!!!
B00106AC24|2|I did not like the results of using this product. I kept it in as instructed and it turned out dry and bushy. I have naturally curly and silky hair and wanted to thin it out some. Bad choice.
B001ET764E|5|CRYSTAL IS WONDERFUL.  I AM ALLERGIC TO EVERY PRODUCT ON THE MARKET.  BEEN USING IT FOR 15 YEARSS. AND IT NEVER GIVES OUT.  .. I AM PROTECTED FOR 48 HOURS.
B00UJ3Y4WI|5|This 7-piece set of makeup brushes is just about all an average woman would need for flawless makeup application.  Soft synthetic bristles are firmly attached to varnished pink wooden handles, and I especially like the shorter length (5&#34; - 5.5&#34;) because it allows more precision than longer handles (at least for me!).  Included are brushes for powder, blush, foundation, 2 eyeshadow brushes, lip brush and eyebrow brush.  This collection comes in a pretty pink tin, but also includes a purple mesh bag for more portability.<br /><br />This set would make a perfect gift - any woman would love receiving a set of nice makeup brushes.<br /><br />I received a complimentary Acevivi makeup brush set for testing and review. I wasn't asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for giving my honest opinion.
B002Z6G8UI|3|I like the case itself and I think the idea of the LED light and mirror on the side was cool.  The color is very pretty.  HOWEVER...once I applied the gloss, my lips started stinging as though I applied Vick's to them.  And there was a menthol smell to it also...a little disappointed.
B005UHS4PG|4|If you need cheap nail buffers in bulk, his works great. You'll save money. He grit isn't super fine so it's a little rough IMO but like I said, you if you need bulk without breaking the bank, these are great. Wish they made them with finer grit though!
B00N30SE3E|3|I've owned a Sedu flat iron for the last 7 years and absolutely loved it.  Always worked great and never lost heat.  When the electrical element finally started getting a little spotty (it would still turn on, I just had to mess with the On button a bit), I decided to see what else was out there after so many years.  I have lots of friends with GHDs who love them, so I read a ton of reviews, watched some cute little teenagers trying to do comparisons for their 10 YouTube followers (I think those are hilarious...poor girls have no idea how to formulate a sentence and flat iron at the same time).<br /><br />In the end, I decided that not much had changed over the last 7 years in the technology, but I thought I'd give the HSI, GHD and Sedu all a fair shot and compare them myself. So I got them all, let my hair air dry (it's naturally curly...and not in a pretty way...like in a frizzy, wild, scary way) and then used them all. Unfortunately, the HSI didn't even come close to GHD and Sedu, so I didn't include it in the running, but if you want to read a comparison of GHD and Sedu, here's what I found:<br /><br />Price:  GHD $121, Sedu $100 (if I had gotten the black Sedu, it would have been $178, but I actually like this dark purple)<br /><br />Material: GHD has a rougher feeling exterior, the same as my old Sedu, which would attract dirt and hairspray like you wouldn't believe.  I can't tell you how much time I spent scraping caked on hairspray off of it.  Anyway, the Diamond Sedu has a smoother exterior, which looks like it'll be easier to clean.<br /><br />Style/Options: Both 1&#34; (Sedu has more curved edges, which I find easier for curling the ends of my hair under); both heat up quickly (GHD was seriously 5 seconds, Sedu was about 30...I can handle either of those times); both have an auto shut-off (Sedu just added that to this Diamond version), Sedu has a temp control where GHD doesn't (it's supposed to adjust to your hair, which seems to work well)<br /><br />Use: They both straighten really well...one run over a section of my scary curls totally smooths them out. They're both SO much better than the cheaper brands I've tried (the HSI got terrific reviews, but there's really no comparison to these two). The big difference is that the GHD would catch and pull on my hair a bit...not much, but enough to where I have to think about it.  The Sedu doesn't catch at all...super smooth and I can go over any amount of hair that I want to. I also found myself going over the GHD side with the Sedu as I was finishing and styling without even thinking about it...that right there kind of made the final decision for me. :)<br /><br />In summary, I'm sticking with the Sedu and returning the GHD.  Both are quality products, but the Sedu edged out the GHD and if it lasts as long as my first one, I'm happy to pay a bit more than the cheaper straighteners for what I'm getting.  Hope this review helps someone else who's looking to buy!
B008JSJ9HU|5|It burns a little for a second or two and has to be washed off in 20 minutes, which is a pain, but other than that, I am pleased with the product.
B00066LD72|5|I ordered a lot of this product.  It does what it says.  I stopped ordering because I can no longer afford it.
B00GLS58OS|2|...I think it made my hair more red??? I didn't think that was possible :/<br />It looks pretty, but not what I expected at all.
B000068PBT|5|This is a great price for these replacement heads.  And, a few weeks after I purchased a set, my wife was shopping Amazon on Black Friday and picked up a another set for me at an even lower price ($16.88), with an on-line $5 off from Philips that Amazon automatically provided at checkout.  These replacement heads are made by Philips, for their Spectra line of razors, and are not aftermarket.  They correctly fit my Norelco Spectra model 8895XL electric razor (side note: my model is the &#34;James Bond special edition&#34; with a &#34;Die Another Day/007&#34; logo on it, that I purchased in 2002).  Not sure how long Philips is going to make replacement parts like this for a 14 year old razor.  [One slight difference from sets i purchased a few years ago.  The original ones were stamped with &#34;8-SERIES&#34; and these are stamped with &#34;Double-Precision&#34;.]
B00VKOHS2I|4|The chemical in the product stings my eye a little when applying to lashes. But it when I use it as a base it pumps up the volume of my mascara and helps prevent smudging during the day.
B0019ADP7K|5|Love this sponge
B002G7L0GI|5|I would order from this site agian. Seriously. I would order from this site agian. Seriously. I would order from this site agian. Seriously. I would order from this site agian. Seriously.
B005HF15UM|5|I love this product.  Great to travel with.
B001QB9A4Y|5|perfect. this is what I needed
B001D4FF66|4|So I started using wen about a year and change ago when I started transitioning back to natural - curly hair. The product was great. It prevented breakage, it protected my curls, it made my hair soft and manageable I love it. However I can't imagine it working well on straight hair that doesn't need any added oils. Otherwise its great. I don't use WEN alone, I use another organic shampoo first (like organix) and then use wen as a second shampoo / deep conditioner. I find this works best for me. I've tried just using the WEN alone...my hair was relatively clean but not as clean as I would like it.  I highly suggest making sure you shampoo once, with another organic shampoo before putting wen in.
B00OQQGDBY|5|This is one of the brands of sunscreen that my family used over the summer. This works great, protects against burning and is perfect for the beach or any outside activities.
B000P20PSU|5|Makes you feel feminine and desired. Absolutely adore this natural scent of a fresh tea rose. It awakens sweet memories of your childhood and youth - the years of happiness. I love,  love this perfume - lots of thanks to its creators!
B0019J4R6Y|5|I really like this product! It doesn't really have a smell or feel sticky and it really does give my hair volume that lasts! I have a decent amount of hair, but it is thin. I like how my hair feel when I use this product and how long it lasts. I also like that it doesn't make my hair feel weighed down, greasy or full of product. I will definitely continue using this product.
B009SBMRXK|3|Bought this at macys, this could have been my new favorite perfume, the smell is divine, a great floral scent, unfortunately it doesn't last long, i didn't realize it was a toilette spray which is similar to a mist, so i will be exchanging for the viva la juicy  perfume tommorrow,I hope the le fleur becomes a pefume soon, which lasts longer and not just in toilette water
B005DKKBP6|5|Let me first say I have a really thick beard and sensitive skin . Not easy to get a good shave even with the best blades .Because of all the \\"nooks and crannies\\" in my face ,cuts would always be a problem even with an electric razor .I have used Reminton and two different models of Norelco Shavers .My last shaver was the Panasonic es8249 which gave one of the best shaves to that point .The es8249 did create some irritation but was the closest shave so far . Then I heard about the LV-81k . Read all the reviews and it looked like it would be lot better than my 8249. Well with Amazon's return policy I figured I would give the LV-81k a chance even with the high price .<br />I have to say I have never had a shave as close and irritation free as I get with this new shaver .Absolutely amazing .<br />With the lv-81k :<br />I have shaved dry and it was very good . I have shaved with lectric shave and it was even better . Then I shaved wet using King Of Shaves Kinexium oil and got great results . Yesterday I wet shaved using Nivea gel and all I can say is WOW ! Usually by five pm I'm looking like Richard Nixon on a bad day ,here it is a day later and my face is as smooth as it would normally be a few hours after shaving using other shavers . There is a lot of talk about how great the Braun 790 is and it is a lot cheaper . It does not shave wet and when you clean it you have to use the self cleaner that comes with it . The Panasonic gives you the choice of putting a little liquid hand soap on it ,putting it in turbo mode and running it under water . This will save on buying cleaning cartridges and gives you more flexibility .<br />If you have the money you will not be sorry buying this shaver.
B00H93NJLS|4|I purchased this product after coming home from my stylist one day with super soft silky hair. I found out my stylist had placed several drops of this oil in the conditioner.  It is amazing!  I have started using it on my skin and nails and my skin has a glow/shine and is super soft.  I also use this product on my son's hair.  He is a swimmer and refuses to wear a swim cap so after 4 days of water polo his hair is straw.  I started mixing some of the Organic Argan Oil in his conditioner and it has worked wonders.  It makes his hair soft and we can actually run a comb through it.  We both use it directly after getting out of the shower and absolutely love it.  It is not greasy, it has a very pleasant aroma and neither one of us find the need to use lotion anymore.  This is all you need and I love that the product is organic.
B003KD5A68|4|I really love the clip less curling iron! It's so simple to use and it gets extremely hot, 450 degrees Fahrenheit! Though it is fairly unclear in the details, it's two inches, huge. Now if you have longer hair this is geat for loose flowy curls. It also has a cord which is covered in a type of red netting no difference in the quality though, just a minor detail gone unmentioned. This product though is probably better as a second curler simply because it has such a large barrel if you're just starting out with a clip less. The price is phenomenal though, just look at that list price! Got to love Amazon!
B0009QZZ32|5|good
B001T8P1DI|5|I bought these for camping and hiking. I use the bar soap which works wonders on my skin at home and thought this would be the best bet. I have minor eczema and require sensitive detergents and soaps. I was a little worried about the fragrance of these as I have allergies to most fragrances, but these didn't do any damage being so close to my nose. They did seem to attract some insects while my face was still drying from the scent though, but I am a friend to bees and insects so it did not bother me in particular. I also was able to use these on my armpits and genital area without a problem although this is not what they are intended for. The seal doesn't like dust, so keep a quart sized plastic bag with you to store it and it will stay moist.<br /><br />Overall, they were very cleansing and I am happy to have gotten them.
B0009EILL2|5|I used one of these last night and was appalled at what it pulled out of my pores! I thought that my skin was pretty clean, but even after my facial last week I still had so much junk in those pores. These strips work very well, they were easy to apply and remove and didn't break me out or anything. Great product!
B009DUJCVQ|5|Works good for me. Helps me with my make up. Instead of using my hand to put the liquid
B006GQPCB4|4|Pretty color
B0026S9OQK|5|They are good, thank you.
B00400A5HE|3|covers some bald spots.flakes too much,expensive.
B000068PBT|5|Great Seller. Oem heads arrived quickly and as described. Thanks
B009KD0X00|1|This towel warmer did not work out of the box. You know you have problem when it comes with a paper telling you &#34; you may have to buy new fuses if this doesn't work&#34;.  No response from manufacturer when notified.
B0065NEQ9M|4|I do like this blush, but it's not what I was expecting. The image shows a swatch that seems much lighter and more pigmented than what I received. This blush (Charming Lily) goes on much darker - I'm very fair skinned, so it's not my skin tone - and could almost be used as a bronzer for me. I have to mix in some pink blush from another company to make it look more like a pink blush.<br /><br />While I don't dislike it, it's just not the color it appears to be. It does work well for warm skin tones, though.
B000HLH7ZS|5|Just a little strong but I like it
B004CNH5FY|4|Good product.  Daughter loves this brush
B0092PL1RA|4|I have been through 2 &#34;Wahl Chrome Pro's&#34; in the past year. I have also used Conairs in the past. I bought them from a large local retailer for roughly half the price of this item. The ICON is leagues better than what is offered at the store level. I'm no expert at motor or blade configurations, etc...but I do cut my head every 2 days to maintain a short stubble. This clipper along with the 1/2 guard are just perfect. The cutting experience is much smoother now. There is no pulling and I've noticed I can go about 20 minutes before it begins to heat up at all (the Chrome would heat up after 5 minutes).<br />  I docked 1 star because the maintenance directions ask you to apply oil to the blade after every cut. I find when I do this, the oil sits there and makes the entire head assembly much dirtier than it should be as hair &#34;sticks&#34; to it. Also, the cord is heavier than I thought, and is too long for my taste. NO deal breakers here so far though. Bottom line: If you looking for the next step up, you'll be very satisfied with this clipper.
B002PHN5BM|5|great scent...
B0091IJ4C2|5|Not much a uv coat in my opinion, because it comes off with a cotton ball and polish remover, but I love that it's quick dey and high shine, and drys all the polish layers underneath
B001MS79TO|1|Cd was not inside the box?!
B00C7DYBX0|5|Finally a product that does what it says.  My skin is very sensitive and this is the first serum that does not burn or irritate.  it dries very quickly so that it is not an issue when I apply my makeup on over it.  I actually use it on my hands and neck area as well and it has made a big difference!  You have nothing to loose with this product and I am a big skeptic of items advertised.  This isnot ne of them.
B00IID8SBY|4|I have so far used a 30 day supply. It is packed with vitamins and I think it is helping with my hair loss. I am also using a shampoo to control my receding hairline. I think both the products being used together is helping. I have not noticed any side effects from this product. I will post another review in a couple months and will update on any noticeable progress.
B0053L2E1O|5|This is a fabulous soap! My girls and I love it. Lasts a long time. I cut it into bars, wrap it in wax paper to store it to use in the future.
B004FY1ZAQ|1|It's started working really good the first week then after the first week it started to fade to rgat not back now I have to buy another one until I can find a new brand
B002GZQJSO|5|I bought 3 bottles for Xmas presents,everyone loves the scent.it's the real deal not a knockoff ,and way cheaper.product came fairly quick also.
B0067F28ZW|2|The only brushes I use are the eyebrow one and the foam one because the others don't work at all. This to over a month to ship. I got it because of the good price and if they were more than 5 bucks I would have returned them....
B0009OAHIM|5|I saw this as the top rated cologne on a website and decided to order it without even smelling it first. I am really happy with my purchase because this cologne smells great! I would also recommend Dolce & Gabbana Light Blue Cologne.
B0002L93N2|5|Love it! Works perfectly
B003QMY6GI|5|This is an amazing cologne. I would recommend it to everybody that wants to have a great experience with a cologne.<br />Thank you!
B00B60GA6G|5|Deodomom works as advertised.  Lasts for 12 hours, and doesn't leave stains in my clothes.  I definitely will continue using it.
B005CIG1K8|5|I will say it worked because I passed the test. It's not bad to have it for how cheap it is and I overnighted the package. I did stop smoking for 2 days prior and listerined the heck out my mouth. I also brushed 2 a day like normal and sucked on strong cough drops because it gives you that layer and film throughout your cheeks if you have even had a bad cold. I think everything else was why I passed, but eh I would get it again and next time try it buy a test a try before and after use. Hope this helps.
B00LNQGSGA|4|could be richer in color but its ok.
B000ZWS4WY|5|These are great but overpriced. Watch for them on Ebay for much better pricing.  They really help with congestion!! Great!
B001AMMSGQ|1|I did not like the Natural strength Putty because of the smell. I ordered the Organics Sculpting Putty from Amazon but they substituted it with the Natural Strength Putty...?
B00021C1LI|5|I u this with my Clarisonic and it does a nice job of cleaning off products gently and thoroughly. My skin feels clean, but not too dry father use. Did not clog pores or cause acne.
B000ORV3NC|3|I was a bit disappointed.  The fragrance was little off putting, and the lotion a bit sticky.  Was highly touted, but not for me
B001VHZXOE|5|My friend told me to get this mirror instead of buying a big expensive one.  It works really well and I can travel with it.  Great value, very recommended.
B000KNHJ5G|4|i only recently learned about dry body brushing and decided to take the plunge to try it.  bought a facial brush and two body brushes.  this brush is too much stimulation for the more tender skin on my stomach and sides, but is great for my feet and legs up to inner thighs and hips.  i use the Sublime Beauty Skin Brush for mu upper body, and the Bass Face Brush on my face and neck.  i really do like this dry body brushing.  have only done it for a few days now, but it may be that i will stick with it.
B003AYEFOA|5|Loved this color!
B00HSFAHT4|5|I ordered this wig like a week ago and wasn't expecting it to get here this quick at all. I'm going to a con all weekend where I wasn't planning on doing an Aoba cosplay (because I didn't think I'd have the wig in time) but now that it's here i can! It's super soft and the length and color is great and it's pretty much pre-styled. I really love it, there's not much work that needs to be put into it at all and wow just super super fast shipping. Thanks!
B005BTCPRG|5|The colors are great and got exactly what I wanted. The nail polishes do come individualy and not in a box.
B003PL2D6A|5|-Combination skin<br />-Dry skin<br /><br />I've tried clean & clear and Neutrogena and neither of them worked as well for my skin. It's winter here, and my skin has been getting painfully dry and flaky. I went through about three moisturizers that always had something wrong with them (neutrogena--not heavy enough, but had spf so i used it; neutrogena natural--too heavy, and clogged my pores; clean & clear--dried and irritated my skin; ambi--not heavy enough). This moisturizer, in combination with an aveeno nighttime moisturizer, have turned out to be the perfect combo for me. I was worried about the salicyclic acid in it because that's what the clean & clear moisturizer that I bought had in it, but whatever else is in it is very soothing. I use this moisturizer as a \\"first coat\\" because it is not very heavy, and i need something \\"heavier\\" to lock in the moisture (what the aveeno is for). However, I have put just this moisturizer on without the use of aveeno and it felt good/not drying. My face has never felt tight, irritated, or oily after using it--even after exfoliation when my skin is most sensitive. I feel confident that in spring, especially summer, this moisturizer would still work well (without the aveeno). I have been using it for a couple of weeks and my skin is doing well.
B004OOBSA4|5|I am very pleased with this product. After researching many different products online I went with Melabel cream. I began seeing results after one week of use. I would recommend this product to anyone who is seeking an affordable skin lightening cream that works.
B00J2APFMW|5|It works better then the basic Fusion.
B00021CD2A|5|Finally found the perfect eyeliner. I have asian eyes and eyeliner tends to smudge, lasts all night and doesn't smudge! Needs waterproof makeup remover to get rid of but color lasts and lasts. Worth the price.
B0046AAVR2|5|I didn't realize how much of a difference it makes replacing your brush head. I'll be honest, I didn't replace mine for a year because it was visually OK. But now that I have with these guys, it makes a world of a difference. Better go get me some sensodyne though because it was a little intense the first brush!
B0000AFUTL|5|Perfect! Thank you!
B00CHJ34P0|5|My grandaughter picked this bag for her new laptop and absolutely loves it.  Would recommend to buy to provide class to your laptop.
B00HB2JQ2S|5|I'm a woman and I use it, love it
B004D268RA|3|Ok, this cleanser works well enough for me (I have combination to oily skin that tends to be on the sensitive side, just for reference), but the &#34;how well this product works for me&#34; department is not where my issue lies. What I truly have a problem with is the immensely poor packaging. You probably know how normal pump dispensed products work, you just push down and twist a little, and you're good to go, right? Well, that was certainly not the case here. I tried twisting, I tried pressing down, pulling up, and endless combinations of the three, but to no avail. I just could not unlock this pump, so I decided to seek help elsewhere, by enlisting the assistance of my brother. After maybe five minutes of using the techniques I had already failed with, he pressed down really hard, so hard that both he and I thought he would break the bottle, and the pump finally gave way. Needless to say, cleanser exploded everywhere, much to my brother's displeasure. So, like I said before, it is a good cleanser, but after that whole pump fiasco, I doubt I will be so quick to recommend it.
B0079R6BD2|5|I've been using this shampoo once daily for hair loss since October 2011. I also use a laser comb 2-3 times weekly and NuHair Thinning Hair Serum after the laser treatment. It took me a few months to begin to see a difference in hair loss. But after one year of continued use, the combined results have been very noticeable.  If you're trying to combat hair loss, ignore the negative reviews and stick with this shampoo for year.
B00CD1QU80|5|Affordable and fast shipping. It's cheaper than going to walgreens and does the job.<br />If you don't know what this razor does, you don't need it.
B0052AHNBW|5|I love this product, the smell of lemons in the morning is a wonderful way to start the day off.
B00TLW5LDY|2|These bottles are terrible quality. The caps don't really fit the bottles. They're also not childproof.
B0009EXP18|2|First of all my product came w/two sets of patches (4 total), no box, just loosely packaged, so read the fine print.  Second --i'm not sure the did anything.  My eye area felt tight after, but also very sticky.
B00AFCPAAS|5|Best price ever found happy saving days ever since better new design I had the first model in the market still works but Is so old that I had the need for this more clean appealing color<br />Luis
B002N0T8GW|4|The only minus I have about these is that they have a tendency to slip down or off while working out. Other than that, I love them! They keep my hair out of my face, which was the point.
B000C1W38O|5|The bottle looks awesome, and the cologne smells very good!  Would definitely recommend to anyone looking to buy a high quality bottle of cologne at a good price.
B001V6QL5K|5|I love this conditioner, but it pricey. It's worth the money if you have dry hair and you won't something that is guaranteed to work.
B009GHHW5Y|5|I love this oil...not too fond of the scent, but it kept my hair moisturized and extra soft.
B00HHYLF6U|4|Great price for what has become very expensive to buy in the store.
B005XQ8DE6|4|In the mall near my house they sell this straightener for around 200 dollars. So when I saw it on amazon for less than half the price I ended up getting myself, my friend and my cousins one. This company has some of the cutest patterns and the shape and size of the straightener is a lot like a CHI. This straightener does a great job of smoothing your hair but for people with thicker hair it can only handle a small piece at a time. For somebody with thicker hair like myself it becomes very time consuming using such a narrow straightener and I end up having to do a lot more passes through my hair. However the PYT straightener works fantastically for my friend who has much thinner hair then myself and she has had it for 2+ years and it is still working fine even with everyday use.<br /><br />Although this straightener hasn't been great for me I would still recommend it for somebody with thinner hair. The prints are even cuter in person and it has been reliable after daily use. Your hair will come out straight and be very smooth. For girls with thicker hair it will take a bit longer to achieve but as long as you are patient you will be happy with the results!
B00MCVLDRY|5|A beautifully scented perfume. It's light, elegant and not overpowering. It's one of my favorites!
B005NZG1J6|4|Each night at part of my face washing routine...the last thing I do it put this on my eyelashes....after about 4 weeks I have notices my eyelashes have gotten longer and I am seeing additional growth. I am a mature adult and my lashes had gotten quiet short and sparse. They are almost back to where they were 10 years ok. Of course another change I made was to stop using waterproof mascara and that may also be playing a part....but my daughter has been using it also and her lashes have gotten thicker with additional growth. So I say it works. Will update later if it turns out I am wrong..but very pleased so far.
B00M5TAEFU|5|My wife and I both love this cream. She uses it for stretch marks. I use it on my feet.
B00NFR1040|4|I requested this product hoping it would dry my hair and give it a little more volume. I found that it takes way too long to dry.  I still have to dry it with a regular blow dryer, then use the curling iron for volumizing.  I did not find any advantage over a dryer and round brush, and it takes much longer.<br />I hesitated to take a star off because it seems to be a very high quality product, and works like advertised.  It is simply for people who do more to their hair than I will ever do.
B000ORV3NC|5|My favorite hand cream, it is very soothing for dry hands.
B00PV15BPW|4|So far, the peppermint oil seems to be quite effective at repelling spiders. I put some on the thresholds of my cabin and it seems to work. I don't have any data yet on how long it may be effective, but (damn) my outdoor space smells nice!
B000GCKALQ|2|I found it uncomfortable and scratchy around the edges
B002N5MI2S|5|Great product - doesn't smell, not oily, etc. I've been using this product since last November and it's the only thing I buy for my hair now.
B00AXRHVYS|5|Came in excellent conditions.very good product,can't wait to have my braids on
B0095IMNI0|5|This is a wonderful product!  It is easy to use.  I have had other flossers and the tank was always difficult to get off to fill.  This is perfect.  And I absolutely love the toothbrush.  What a pleasant surprise.  It has a timer built in so that you spend 30 seconds in each quadrant of your mouth.  Love the carry case for the toothbrush.
B008L3ERZM|4|My Girlfriend was buying this shampoo and conditioner for over a year, from her hair stylist, convinced that it was sold exclusively through her salon.  I looked it up on Amazon, and to our surprise, Amazon sold it at almost 1/2 the price her salon was selling it to her for.
B00336EUTK|5|good
B004RANK5Q|4|Great soap for brightening your skin, I like it a lot! I saw an instant glow to my skin. Definitely getting more
B000141O6E|5|bought this for minor dandruff that I have, this works really well and leaves my scalp and hair smelling great.  Way cheaper here than at Great Clips which is where I first learned of it.
B00DQSVZ8E|5|This is second time I've purchased this product. IT WORKS. If you are used to Latisse, it does not grow new lashes, extends the ones you already have. Great alternative to expensive products (I've done my research!). I've actually bought it for my mom and a family friend and they were impressed.
B001BSH2E2|4|Works as expected.
B00JCCAV8I|2|Lovely soap but heavily scented - I couldn't use it because of the fragrance - no mention of scent on website - seller refunded money with apology
B002N5MHLK|2|After reading some of the reviews of this product, I guess I got my hopes up. I've been looking for an electric razor that would at least give me a decent shave. Unfortunately, this isn't it. I read the literature that came with the shaver and gave it the time necessary to \\"acclimate\\" from razor to electric shaver shaving. After shaving with this razor for about 3 weeks, I have gone back to using shaving cream and razor. I thought that (because of the PRICE) and the reviews, that I would be able to use this shaver as my primary shaving tool. I was wrong. One of the reviews stated that once you started shaving with this shaver, you'd never go back to a blade....WRONG!
B005F1IMFO|5|I have been using this product for years. I have very fine and thin hair, this treatment keeps my hair in great condition and looking full.
B00DVATEB2|5|Nice stuff
B00016XJ4M|5|Great toner. Not harsh and very moisturizing.
B0034W4PWK|3|I purchased for a pedicure/manicure gift basket but haven't heard any complaints yet...but the ladies was sure pleased that it was included in the basket.
B00OM1LRB4|5|Loved it and I received it before estimated delivery date ! Definitely purchasing again once this one runs low !
B003987CL0|4|My skin is very sensitive.  It nicks easily, and I can suffer from a breakout if I end up with razorburn.  The Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor really helps with this!  I thought that the buzzing was just a gimmick until I actually tried it.  I now go through one time all downstrokes, then a second time through going up, and with that little vibrating thing (doesn't it seem like that would not be a good idea, for the razor against your face to shake really quickly while you're using it?) does the trick.  Not much pressure is needed for a very close shave with no nicks or burn.  Definitely a great product. I took off a point because the cartridges are ridiculously expensive, but that's to be expected.
B00J4TCO8O|4|It works, without any fuss. Recommend for traveling.
B00ISLBS9A|2|Old and half quantity!
B00JJAEQ5C|2|Pretty. They were great for a while. Then they stopped pumping. So useless now.
B000RO6ZDA|5|Ths is a great mascara! Very thick, but not gloppy! I would buy this mascara again! Makes your lashes pop!
B003YMJJSK|1|THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PARABENS WHICH CAUSE CELL DEATH WHEN EXPOSED TO UV LIGHT.<br />In other words it kills the skin cells on your face.<br />Don't buy this product.
B00C7DYBX0|4|The serum worked fast and really well. Unfortunately it ran out after about 10 days of use. I had to reorder and got another brand that was supposed to be stronger, but unfortunately it doesn't work as well. I am going back to the original product, and will just have to order in larger quantities.
B002B8VE4U|1|I gave it one star because there are none lower.  It did not work in Israel even though we had top of the line converters.  In America, it was wimpy and hard to hold.  The voltage switcher on the dryer did not really exist.  Find another one.
B0036QFZ46|3|This is nice, I like Hempz brand and it has a nice light scent.  However, the pump did not work from day 1, so I'm not happy with that.  I have to keep the lid unscrewed and use it that way.  I should have returned it, but didn't want to bother.  I hope this was an isolated incident!
B00CCYTSBE|5|Origins charcoal mask is pretty effective for clearing the crud right out of your pores. It works best, IMO, after it has been used a couple of times. I didn't notice a big difference until about a month of using it 1-2X per week.<br /><br />The texture is a little different than what it appeared in the tube. I thought it would be heavy so I was surprised when I used it and it wasn't. I apply it with my fingers and it feels a little thin, but I do put it on liberally. I don't notice any sensations on my skin unless I have an open pimple or sore. Then it tingles a little.<br /><br />My skin is pretty oily and my face is dotted with, mostly, little black heads all over. I have noticed that there are less blackheads and my pores are smaller since I started using this in January (about 3 months ago.) I use it in combination with the Origins Zero Oil moisturizer, and Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with the results and will continue to use include it in my skin regimen. I did not use it once and wake up with a fabulous face, but I have noticed a good improvement over time, so I am sticking with it.
B0092RRNKW|5|I'm a new devotee too this brand. I absolutely love the keratin products. This dry shampoo smells amazing and leaves hair feeling clean. And most importantly the sprayer never clogs!!!!
B002XQ1Y68|5|I like it
B0009MFUO0|2|The shave delivered is OK. Probably a bit better than average. After a period of time (the unit decides this and not you) the 'change the blades' light comes on. Until you do this the light stays on, effectively killing the battery life until you buy new blades. When I called Phillips on this they expressed 'surprise' and replaced my razor, but how can this be when others in this review process report the same thing? Phillips really screwed up on this one. Do NOT buy this unit!
B00L3UXPQW|4|I thought this was a barrette. It looks like it in the picture. Had I read the description a little more carefully, I would have understood that they are separate flowers, each attached with a little pic. The flowers are beautiful. I just have to figure out how to put them together so they will stay in my hair.
B0064FYZ5G|2|Didn't seem to keep me skin moist. Regular lotion worked better for me and kept my skin feeling less dry ...
B0006PLP6W|4|I like this product very much.  It does a good job.  However, a particle on the rough side has<br />already fallen out, for this I am disappointed, so gave it four stars.
B0031OOHB0|5|Subtle scent and high-lather cream that allows for a very close shave.<br /><br />I usually use the hard shaving soap, but wanted to try something a little different. I was not disappointed in this purchase. Use a shaving brush to apply this stuff and you can't go wrong. All you need is the barest hint of a dab on the shaving brush and you can produce a massive lather. Based on that, I expect this tub to last many months.<br /><br />The only thing better would be a TSA-compliant size that I could take with me when I travel. :)
B00V2OOOU0|1|Don't really care for it.  It leaves a crust under your eyes.  Doesn't look natural!!
B006RXJLKE|5|I was looking for a eyebrow stencil kit and this product met all my needs.<br />I would recommend this product.
B00F98E4IC|5|The beige/ivory stand works well and matches my Old Spice soap mug and bottle of Old Spice after shave.
B0058PCTH4|3|product is of decent size and seems to be well made. I bought these for mu \\"tween\\" nieces. I would have given this item more stars, but the keys for one of the cases was missing. It's a LOCKING case, it kinda defeats the purpose of being a locking case if there are no keys with it.<br /><br />and before anyone comments, yes, I realize it is a crappy little lock that you don't \\"NEED\\" keys for, but, NO i am NOT going to teach my nieces how to pick a lock.
B00F029RNY|5|I'm really happy with these and will get tons of use out of them for a very long time, very good quality
B002N4HS8I|5|My twelve year old son actually had this in his collection first.  He has good taste.  Chip off the old block!
B00009YJSJ|4|Works great though the night light is kinda useless.
B00B3JN4DW|5|I purchased this brunette soft crayon.  Exceptional eyebrow filler for sparse eyebrows and hate to say it  but NO brows - it works !!!<br /><br />Brunette is actually a medium brown shade that compliments Ash Blondes, Light Brown hair; also complimentary to frosted platium and blonde wigs.  This shade brunette is a great shade to start out with if you are unsure.  It agrees with my brows but I had to learns to apply it.  This is not like the old fashioned bit of just drawing lines on the eyebrows.  This is a technique now-a-days.  I watched U-Tube and the gal demonstrated the perfect eyebrow and MAC was the eyebrow liner she actually used.  I must have watched this girl 4/5 times and I am still learning.  Guess, that is why the celebrities have a make-up artist.  It takes time to learns the technique.<br /><br />I am improving and I see that 'so called arch' which we all striving for and incidently isn't that easy to achieve.<br /><br />The CON to this story is this liner much too expensive with this seller.  I paid $19.95 with NO Shipping and Handling charges at Nordstroms.<br /><br />Great product girls - catch you all later.
B009QZJDJO|5|Great product it is very informative on how to exactly put this eye shadow on and which color goes where. I love how the colors go together and I would agree this makes your eyes Photo ready.
B00JLAOP3S|5|Works exactly as advertised!
B00KYUXIOG|5|After three days my skin already feels better !
B000C1UFHU|4|good
B000TA6PVY|5|This is such a great idea for make-up lovers. You can mix and match all of your colors according to the season, your travels or whatever whim. They really don't move once they are in so you are safe to toss them in your bag if you're on the go. Easy to clean and very slim. Love it!
B00ICO345O|1|Unless you have a blowtorch handy, this wax is more than difficult to warm into a moldable paste suitable to put on your face. I tried warming the wax several ways, including a very hot blow dryer and could not get the wax to melt enough to spread evenly in my hands or on my beard. Even vigorous hand rubbing did not get suitable results. Maybe this is better left for those in warmer climates but here in the Rockies, I've gone back to other waxes that are more pliable. Others seem to have better luck with it but I feel like I wasted my money on this purchase.
B001ET7LAI|5|I use this with Light Mountain Natural black to cover my grays and give my hair a beautiful shine. Since I'm only using the henna on my roots, I can do three or four applications with one box. I mix the entire box up, then freeze what I've not used in an application. I wrote a detailed review on how to do this on the Light Mountain Natural Black page.
B008RJFO6Q|5|I have been using this for awhile as my main Moisturizer for my face.. Love it.. Its lite and does not go on oily.
B00070QQ88|5|This soap is so smooth and wonderfull and it leaves your hands, face, etc. so soft and smelling fanstastic.  All of my houseguests absolutely love it, and the price on here is amazing!  I recommend to anyone!
B0009ML9FY|4|I really love this lotion, it's really think but not greasy at all. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I was hoping it smelled like the soap but the scent is really really nice but not overbearing. I love that the subtle smell which mostly lasts all day long. Great for dry skin and oily skin as it deep moisturize without adding that greasy oily feeling.
B009661Y2M|5|I splurged on this item for myself after seeing that this is a crucial item my sister owns.<br />Her skin is fantastic.<br /><br />We are both in our early 30's with no real wrinkles or noticeable signs of aging (...yet!),<br />however we both suffer from terribly sensitive skin and are fickle with skin products.<br />We agree that this cream is great in that it doesn't irritate the skin and you almost wake up<br />with a glow.  The cream itself does not feel heavy or greasy which is a plus.<br />The scent is also lovely!
B005F3VMLS|5|Lots of lather, beautiful soft scent
B0009DT39C|5|I had peach fuzz I wanted to get rid of on my face so decided to try the facial trimmer.  I had seen the No No advertised on TV but once I read reviews and saw the price I decided it was way over priced.  This handy little trimmer does a great job and well worth the price.  It arrived quickly.  Very happy with my purchase.
B0008GRS60|5|This little sponge (too bad you can't get it bigger than 4 inches) is a gem! You won't be disappointed! This little sponge is gentle yet extremely effective. I use it with the Alba Hawaiian pineapple enzyme facial cleanser and it cleans my face well. It's amazing how much product this little sponge can hold. Rinses out well and dries quickly. Good use for makeup application too.
B000VAWZ2U|5|Great product. Great price. Trouble free transaction. The is the value in a shaving soap on the market. If you haven't tried, you don't know what you are missing.
B003BL7M7E|3|Broke after 3 months of using it every other day.
B00BB1TEV8|5|This is one of my favorites. Since I grew my hair longer for my husband of 26 years, he loves the clips & headbands I pick out.
B008HSIIDS|4|I love this powder! I gave it 4 stars only because it took almost a month in a half to get to me and I feel like the color I ordered was just a bit darker for my skin tone. Other than that the powder is very light and goes on very smooth. I have Asian fair and acne prone skin and so far this product has worked very well with my skin. I do recommend this product and will be ordering again but in a lighter powder.
B003X3S26U|5|This stuff is AWESOME!  I had really damaged my hair with over-bleaching, then I decided I wanted to grow it out long and darken it.  I didn't think I would be able to do this because it was so damaged.  First I bought the oil and loved it.  Then I got the mask and used it along with the oil.  I leave the mask on for 10 minutes to an hour about once a week.  Then after washing it out, I smooth on a few drops of the oil.  It has worked wonders and people are always telling my how pretty my hair has gotten.  Little do they know my secret weapon.
B009WWLCTA|5|I was having issues with my facial complexion, pimples and ingrown hair from shaving.  Since using this product, I have not had any issues at all.
B008CC3SMK|5|Amazing deodorant. Got a free sample from Secret to try out. Normally hate gel deodorant, but since it was free thought I would give it a try. The gel dried super fast, and the deodorant works better than any I have ever tried. Kept me dry, even during exercise. The deodorant has a nice scent to it, and kept me odor free. Would for sure purchase in the future.
B007HU9ZV6|1|The elastic around the waist is already coming loose from the pants. This is definitely not up to Baby Pants standards.
B00L2REOC0|4|Purchased these to add to a bachelorette favor bag to add one more thing to make it a fun girly bag.  I picked these lipsticks over the others I saw online due to the great reviews.  The girls were impressed with the quality of the lipstick and even more impressed at the fact it came from amazon.  It rolls on with a medium pigment tint, and the colors blend well if you use two together to make it work best with your skin color.  I randomly had given them to the girls without taking their skin into consideration and everyone was still able to make the colors work for their makeup look.
B0001OOEKC|2|I had high hopes for this, but it just didn't do much, other than smell better than the usual treatments.
B0009W7MG4|2|I shave once every two days and decided to try M3 Power Nitro (black). It attracted my attention by innovative idea of combining regular razor with electro-vibration, thus making a hybrid.  <br /> <br />I'm not impressed with it at all! I don't like it for several reasons. Vibration actually is mostly reflected on a handle so I felt uncomfortable because it was making my hand too shaky and I'm 26 years old and not a drinker! It doesn't cause cuts or burns but it felt really annoying to my hand while shaving and even a few minutes later! <br /> <br />Due to a better lubricator-strip it glides better, softer than regular Mach3 but shaving performance is about the same. Handle grip is OK but a bit worse than regular Mach3 because it doesn't have fully rubberized handle bottom.  It can be used with Mach3 cartridges, I tested and shaved. While shaving I was concerned about not getting wet its battery compartment.   <br /> <br />I would rather use it as regular Mach3 razor, with vibration turned off, but would NOT buy another! Why pay more for a \\"fancy\\" but in fact useless/annoying vibration function if regular Mach3 does practically the same, if not better, job?! <br />
B009LNFMMI|5|I finally found something that gives my thin hair volume!!!!! Love it!  Only suggestion, make it smell better.  It currently smells like glass cleaner~  :p<br />UPDATE--- I purchased this in March of this year and paid 23.00. This product now costs 49.00!  Are u kidding me?! A 26 dollar increase in under a year!!!  GREED is what I think!  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing this again!
B0012OM1MS|5|Great set for a Cosmetologist. Peanut is the best!
B0094KPK70|4|Does a nice job of defining curls and keeping hairstyle in place.
B00KVFQ9MM|5|works great
B003H146PY|1|Need I say more? it smells like piss and it has other fragrances that make it hard to mix with other colognes to get a better smell. I don't recommend. My friend bought some other pheromone colognes from a sex shop and it smelled much better so it's not just pheromone colognes in general that smell bad.
B001KYVXR4|5|Excellent service and product!
B0001Y74VS|5|I absolutely love this stuff!  There is nothing better for my curly hair - and that's even in the damp humidity of Florida where I live now!
B0051VE5DQ|5|I ordered this to make a face moisturizer. B3 is suppose to be really good for skin. I make small batches that last 1 to 2 week because I don't use preservatives. So far I'm on my 2nd batch and I can tell the difference in texture, decrease I how frequent and how extensive acne breakouts are and improvement with old acne scars
B006FPGRA6|5|This is a great product. I get professional results each time. I mix this with 508- med natural blond- and get an amazingly natural blond color. I get complements on my hair all the time. Easy to use, even though I do the color myself.
B0014YDIZU|5|Moisturizing and refreshing mist. I use it morning and night. It eliminates that tight feeling of just washed skin.
B0065PISWQ|5|The Best :)
B003G1K1RW|5|This scent is sweet and noticeable. Priced very well!
B00DPE9EQO|5|I have been using this product for 2 years and it works.  I have ZERO wrinkles and no skin blemishes.  During the first 30 days of usage I noticed some peeling and redness.  However, this product cleared up all my hyperpigmentation and brown spots within 6 months and it is absolutely the best Vitamin C Serum I have ever used.
B001063NY8|5|Good price and shipped on time!
B00EQ6959Q|5|Have used it for about a year. Love it. Just not easy to find in stored
B008S6IQP4|5|Perfect, just what I was looking for.  The handle is not too big, easy to grip.  Cord doesn't wind up or get tangled
B002VLZHLI|1|I can't tell you now that this is effective against hair loss but I am sure it never dries once one applies it into their scalp! It is something ridiculous. It does not dries for hours! You have to use a piece of paper though.<br /><br />I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING IT.<br /><br />I LOST MORE THAN U$ 20,00!!!<br /><br />COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED!
B005KEQ3CA|5|Good.
B001VNMHJM|4|Good stuff!
B00641UCY8|5|My hair feels so luscious after I apply this. I use this product only when I am wearing my hair curly/natural. Never any tangles when use this. The water runs right through to detangle without even the need of comb in the shower. I use a lathering shampoo once a week, but for daily washing I use this product and a conditioner. I also sometimes apply a small amount as I style.
B00QJTEHWS|5|This is by far the best leave in conditioner one could use, smells great does not weigh your hair down and it smells awesome!<br />Tom`s wife
B0085RZKRI|5|My son has braces and he just dosent know how to brush properly so i bought the toothbrush. I saw an improvement in his teeth in a week
B005JDHHPO|3|No better than other  products. I notice no difference .
B00152QN2G|2|I bought this cologne without a box but somehow the scent only lasts for about 30 mins. I wore one that my nephew has and it lasted an entire day. The scent is even different to the one I purchased. would not be buying any colognes online again.
B000OUBC8A|5|This is the best brush I've found to get rid of the tangles in my hair. It detangles very easily and gently. It's a great, well made product that does a wonderful job :)
B0001MROQA|5|Hot Tools are the best!  They are durable with a wide range of heat options; I need some real heat when curling my long hair and I can always count on Hot Tools irons to do the job. I've noticed most of the stylists at my salon use Hot Tools irons as well...
B005V5SRUE|2|The travel kit I though would have a more variety of its product. The wipes they provided I won't use, I would have preferred a key ring spray size container.
B00L2SWF7K|5|I LIKE THE OZ MOISTURIZERS-- ONE IS SEA INFUSED AND THE OTHER IS JUST AS NOURISHING WITH DIFFERENT<br />INGREDIENTS.  NO ONE RECOMMENDED USING THEM BOTH AT ONCE I  JUST DECIDED TO ON MY OWN.  I APPLY ONE--WAIT A BIT AND PUT ON THE OTHER.--THEY FEEL SO GOOD ON MY FACE
B001MA0QY2|5|I love this flat iron! Heats up evenly and quicker than I can get my hair blow dried. I have long, layered hair that is wavy and somewhat coarse and it gets very dry and frizzy. This leaves my hair soft, smooth and -no frizz! Easy to flip and curl with. My hair stylist uses this exact same one on her clients so I looked it up and found it super cheap! This is an amazing deal on a really good flat iron ladies!!! I definitely recommend it!
B00BH3OBUO|3|Some people might like this, but I don't. I bought it because it was recommended to me for staticky hair. It doesn't help. It's an aerosol can so it surrounds your head with a foggy cloud when you spray it. I also thought the smell was overpowering. It certainly doesn't stink, it's just a very strong perfumey smell. I gave it to my daughters, they seem to think it's ok. Really though, I'm pretty sure it's just perfume. They just put it in an aerosol can & say it's for your hair.
B008F11ZDC|1|Did not work well, peeled off right after being placed on lips.
B005CUHGVE|5|It did what I needed it to do. I was a nail tech in training back when I purchased it. :) And after a year, I still have some left.
B00012FK0C|2|this did not work well for me so i  will keep trying to find the right thing for me to use.
B00A6YIZZ2|5|These oils are absolutely fantastic - and they taste good too!  We have even experimented by mixing flavors!  I recommend them whole heartedly!
B00AGG3MNU|5|Love these blades. They are sharper than most, so be careful.
B00C0HF1J6|5|I went to great lengths to be sure this was certified as another I was using that I bought from Amazon was originally certified organic and pure and after 2 yrs  I wasn't seeing ecocert on their bottle. I found the import documentation where Mogador is listed so I have no doubts about what I am using. Hopefully they will keep product true to form.
B00E8432OU|1|I got a bottle that was old. Been trying to figure out how to return it.<br />Womanity is supposed to be light pink and this one is yellow.
B001AJ8YGC|2|I've had a Norelco 5601X for almost 10 years, worked great and never needed to do much more than clean it and change the blades when they got dull.  After a while, I decided to upgrade to the 7340XL.  Now that I've had it a year, I can say I am highly disappointed.  This razor seems very underpowered even when fully charged, and although I do not have a heavy beard, it takes a long time to get a clean shave.  This is such a problem that I am bringing back the old 5601X into service and will replace the blades and use it as my primary shaver again.  I'm not sure what happened in the past ten years, but I don't see myself trying another Philips Norelco shaver for a while.  This one's not that great.
B001A38Q52|1|Not a fan. Was super excited to get a bunch of bobby pins since I go through them like crazy but these pins STINK! Literally. They smell old and a little 'off' for lack of a better word. Great price but I've had this container of pins for a year now and have yet to use any of them because they smell so bad.
B00TBSY0PS|5|Excellent. My eyelashes look amazing. Longer and fuller.  As a bonus it cleans off really nicely too.
B0001LQGPG|5|this is the best shaving razor i ever used. i found it even better than my Gillette fusion system. it almost cost double than the other cheap brands of same type like bic or wilkinson. but after using this u can feel the difference easily.    pros    smooth and close shave.  it is real easy to clean which i like about it the most.  the blade sharpness last quite a while.   head is flexible which means you aint gonna cut yourself unless u press real hard. be gentle and let it do its work.   grip is comfy.      cons    i wish the replaceable cartridges are cheaper. the are almost the same price as buying the new thing.
B0092OG9AU|5|The best nourishment for any type of hair out there.  I use it one a week and love the way my hair feels.
B000EGMBO8|5|I love this stuff!  I started using it when I was 16.  I love it!  It works great for me.  I have varily light skin and it was extremely hard to get any color.  I would just burn and peel back to very pale.  Once I started using this, I can now tan and get some color!  It is not a sunscreen and I do not use it in a tanning bed. I've only ever used it outdoors but it helps.  I would recommend this to anyone to try at least once.
B00T28A7L8|5|I am really enjoying my case.It stands very well and looks very nice.
B000Q96AHM|5|I've had my razor for over 1yr now and thought I'd never use the cleaner, but just plug it in to the wall. After trying it for the first time though, I was hooked. Just the thought of it being all clean/disinfected plus that smell, and there's no turning back.    I only charge/clean it once a week and just shake it out daily. This seems to last 2-3 months per refill. I think that's acceptable. Try it, you won't be disappointed.
B002ULA2Y6|5|Great brush for winged eyeliner.
B00G5L867C|5|Great toothbrush. The adults in our home use this model.....we don't need all the bells & whistles. As long as you can live with the sounds played 4x to remind you to switch to brushing a different part of your mouth (meant for children). So impressed with the high number of vibrations/minute.
B0051ASNCQ|5|the color was just what I was looking for nice and smooth without the sticky feelingplus it was the right price
B000Z89TZ4|5|I have well water and I started noticing that my blonde was very brassy, and gold. My stylist told me that my hair was soaking in all kinds of minerals from the water. I got on Amazon and started looking for something to help. And let me say THIS is it! I've used it twice now and won't ever stop. My hair is so soft, and is so much more manageable. It does not lay flat, ( I have thin, fine, short hair). I used this with my toning  shampoo and My hair finally looks and feel great!
B001BQZFVQ|5|Nice
B000H0SCCG|5|Great product.
B00331LFOI|5|I wish I could find more large duck-clips like this - I LOVE this clip! I bought one for my Mom and she loves it too!
B0050ZAYC4|5|love the scent!! Great baby shower gift. Packaged well and delivered on time.
B009T6RRW0|5|They're mini claw clips, as described. The colors are cute. My daughter has lots of curly hair, but it's very fine, so big clips slide right out. She loves these, and they keep her hair out of her face.
B0064EJ4OE|5|Love this blend/shade. Live this makeup altogether and how it makes my skin look/feel. There's time I just need to put foundation on...before heading out!
B00333F4AM|5|I love this product! Wish I could get in the stores but have always been<br />able to find it at Amazon. I love it!!!
B008OEZ0N6|1|I would give it zero stars if I could but unfortunately that is not an option. I bought this product because it was dual voltage, and it not only burnt in the first time I used it, it also caught fire. I strongly do not recommend anyone to buy this product.
B0073XQP6K|5|love!
B00KPF3B9C|5|I rate it 5 stars! The shipping is so fast! The quality is amazing! Blended perfectly! &so easy to use! Its a must buy! I definitely will  order more from here if needed!
B0035LT8WM|5|From reading reviews on both shades of this product, I feared that this might be too light...it was the perfect shade of salmon to help hide my dark circles!
B00BCHME3G|5|Very easy to use. Simply soak your feet in water prior to the treatment ( no more than 5 mins). Slip on the booties and pour the liquid. Use one satchel per bootie as instructed. Don't try to be a cheapskate by using only one in both. Keep the booties on for over an hour. I kept mine on for 90 minutes and watched a movie in the meanwhile. I remained in a sitting position to avoid spillage. Worked wonders on my feet. If this didn't work for you, you either didn't follow the instructions correctly or have plain stubborn skin( sorry)
B000O3OCQG|5|I am so glad these are back in stock on Amazon!  These are the best of any of the individual sanitizing wipes on the market.  They are large, soft, moist, durable, and don't stink.  I have even trained my husband to use them.  I keep several in my purse, my makeup bag, my traveling tote, and my luggage.  Since I am afraid of these going of out stock again I bought extra boxes to keep as backup.
B00427WJVK|5|Love it, love it, love it!  This is my absolute favorite perfume (next to Angel).  I highly recommed it! All you need is one spray.  At first the smell is very strong and by about an hour it tones down to a great smell that is hard to describe. There is nothing like it on the market.  I found out there is caviar in it before I smelled it and the thought of that kinda grossed me out. You  can not smell it though.<br /><br />I suggest you go to your local department store first and try it on, since perfume smells different on everyone. Also, department stores sell it for $98.00...which is where I got my first bottle.  I was so happy to find it on amazon for $48.00!<br /><br />Thierry Mugler you are  the best! I am looking forward to your next prrfume!
B000XPC8MA|4|Wife loves it.
B000P20R8I|1|I purchased thinking I was getting a great deal, but after a couple of days of use, the bottle started peeling and I noticed that the fragrance lasted only a few hours! Paying top dollar does not always ensure that you'll get a better product, however perfume may be the exception.
B0016LY7UQ|4|I think this smells good for what it is, though I am not partial to scents of this kind. It smells mainly of roses. It also smells like Cannabis (ahem? not that I would know or anything).<br />I didn't notice much complexity other than that. It does linger for awhile, fresh makes a good perfume. I am partial to the Pink Jasmine.<br />If you buy it make sure you stay far from sniffing distance of any police officer, oh I'm kidding... sort of.<br />A friend of mine said it smelled like earthy floral perfume, did not mention the Cannabis scent (and I am sure they would have, had it been noticable).
B0063YF0BG|4|Got item. Thanks
B002DMK0IU|4|Love this product, love the smell especially.  I use it as a leave in conditioner, rather than a pre-poo because my hair is pretty dry.  I use this mainly on my ends so they are protected.  1 tube lasts a long time because you only need just a little.  I put it in oil moisturizers that I make with a shea butter and coconut oil base.  My ends and edges love this stuff.
B00008Y1BE|5|I have tried many, MANY mascaras over the years and I always wind up back with good ol' Maybelline Great Lash. It's dark, easy to layer, easy to apply - perfect.
B00G36LANQ|5|Love this bag
B00I9X3UKM|5|I went from using the Benefit Porefessional to this and I like this way better. It doesn't clog my pores up and makes my face look better even if I don't wear makeup on top. Keeps my makeup looking great and matte all day. Only complaint is I'm not a fan of the smell but it's not too bad.
B000MAMRHM|5|Like this shampoo..need more
B001GTICH2|5|I tried this at a Brookstone store this fall. Usually my hands get really dry when I'm outside in the cooler weather but they stayed soft all day.  Definitely a product I am going to use this winter!
B001BBLMX6|5|My wash days consist of me oiling my hair first before washing. Also if I need extra moisture for my ends I use a tiny bit of oil that I mix myself. This shampoo is a perfect compliment to my regime!!! It cleanses very well, but it doesn't strip my hair. My hair is left feeling soft, and looks very shiny. I would highly recommend this product.
B00ODG7H4E|5|Bought 2 and installed them on a 2014 Honda CTX700 and 2012 Suzuki DL650a.<br /><br />Product works great and after a years use love the safety they add bring Car / Truck driver's attention when you need it.<br /><br />PRO<br />1. Stock horn will work for short friendly parking lot beep beep horn sound<br />2. When you need to be noticed for major safety the HORN is LOUD and the HEADLIGHT will flash<br />3. Well made product with quality components. Mount out of direct rain flow to ensure water drains out of horn.<br /><br />CON<br />1. Do some internet research to look at where others have installed the horn. You may want to buy one of the 3 brackets sold by Screaming Banshee (Clearwater, Florida)<br />2. You likely will need to read the wiring schematic for your bike to ensure the connections are correct. Otherwise you will need a VDM to check for the correct connections. For my two installs on the above mentioned bikes, each install took a couple hours, once you have done your homework.<br /><br />Overall<br />You will enjoy a level of sound alert safety that is often missing from most stock motorcycles.<br />Would buy again for any bike I or my wife rides.
B003HYPVM8|4|On the whole, I love it. It is the first product I've found that is actually light enough for my skin tone. It provides ample coverage, which can be built up to cover any problem areas. My only problem is that, on its own, on really hot muggy days, it tends to melt and slide. So use a primer, or setting powder or spray, on such days. Otherwise wonderful.
B003CP12O8|1|I have been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I floss twice a day, never smoked, drink water, reagular visits to the dentist, I do what I can to keep my teeth healthly and my teeth look like they are decaying!! With this product staining so many people's teeth, why is Crest Pro Health still on the market!!! I would have not given this product ANY stars if I could!!
B00OJCMPK8|5|These brushes are my wife's new favorites. Great selection of different types and uses, and she really likes the way the bristles spread the powder or blush (or whatever she uses) on her face.
B00DBTLXWG|1|Cheap and poorly made, also even though ordered 2 weeks prior to Halloween, they showed up two weeks after Halloween.
B000RLULLA|4|I love mac cosmetics, but the Mac zoom waterfast is better that the splashproof mascara.  This mascara will run.  It is good for everyday use.
B00D14AGGU|5|This product increases your antioxident levels. Pharmenex has a scanner which &#34;reads&#34; the carotinoid levels, shown on Dr. Oz. Very effective product. Important for your health  if your levels are less than 50k.
B00DWF4CZO|4|I would order it again.
B00G54NPWK|5|Holy crap I didn't realize how s***ty my previous curling pad was until I put this one in.
B005XRTOYI|4|I've used this tanning lotion for about 2 years now and I love it. It's not overpriced and gets me tan fairly quick. I decided to order it on here because it was about 20$ cheaper than what I normally pay in my salon. Although it arrived sooner than I expected, when I received the lotion, the cap was off and lotion had exploded into the package. The lid apparently hadn't been screwed on correctly and the seller had only placed a small piece of Scotch tape over the lid. The tanning lotion itself is great and worth buying but I didn't like that half of the bottle was emptied into the package before I even got it.
B00II2FF3E|4|I have used other brands of bruise creams these past few years, and Zak's is the best of the bunch. I have very sensitive skin, and am a blood thinner taker due to various heart problems. I'm also in my late 70s, and although very active, and very young at heart my skin just isn't the same as it was when  was younger.<br /> Zak's is good as mentioned. better than most, as mentioned. It honestly helped, yet my skin bruises take a long time to literally &#34;go away&#34;, if the ever do. I will continue to use it, and yet at the same time will continue to look for other creams so to speak, that will possibly do a better job.<br /> I say this because my arms ( for the most part), look like I am an ad for Coumadin Poster Man, and being vain, bothers me.<br /> Thanks for your inquiry.<br /> Arthur
B00008ZPGA|5|I have used this product for years. I have tried others but this serum works the best on my skin. In the winter, moisturizer alone is not enough. I need the serum underneath.to make my skin not feel so taut.<br />I was so happy to find this product at such a fair price. I saved quite a bit of money from price at the drug store. I will order again through Amazon.
B00V6HTURU|3|[[VIDEOID:8f0829997b00e2695a8fb359dd9d2b64]]The reason the review went from 5 star to 3, is because the integrity of the company. If they aren't going to keep their word to blogger's; heavens to Betsy, I cannot imagine what they do to the buyer, that has no voice, with an audience that reads their blogs/social media outlets.<br /><br />Shame on them, disappointing my winner, and me, as someone who worked hard for them for free....now here's my review of the product alone...<br /><br />Oh how I enjoy a facial steamer! I have been without one for almost three years, due to downsizing my life, and selling Belle Phiz (my former beauty spa business). I've been doing the old-fashioned steams, with hot compressed towels, from the microwave and/or crock-pot.<br /><br />You must know, NOTHING compares to a good steamer!  This my Flocker's is a great little steamer!!  It's very compact, which is perfect for me, since my space in Jimmy Lee, is limited. Plus, it's pretty as a petaled flower...get it...it's got a flower top?  Forget it...let's continue.<br /><br />It's very easy to pour the distilled water in the reservoir, without making a splashy mess. What's nice is it comes with its own spouted cup for aid in pouring. The reservoir is almost hidden, and this helps with the spillage issue.<br /><br />I like that it's level, and the cord isn't in the way when setting-up. Tearing down is a breeze, and can be done within minutes. For the novice, newbie, or old-pro like me, it's a great little steamer, and you're going to love your skin for getting one of your own.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this product at a savings price, or it is supplied to me in exchange for the purposes of a product review. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest & unbiased opinion. Yours may differ from mine.
B0080CO2F4|5|Short version, it's perfect, the beautiful colors, stays in hair, always get compliments. ordering more today for family and friends.
B003VL0RWG|5|good quality needles for a lot less then i pat for the same items from my regular supplier.would highly recomend.fast shipping
B00097AKEK|5|I like this because I can put it where I want it. Especially around my ears and face. You can't do that with a spray.
B007P7U8S0|5|This polish makes me think about lounging by the pool, fruity drinks, summer music blaring, and Hawaiian Tropics. Everything I love about summer! The color is amazing and bright, a happy neon! This is my third order of this color. It's my signature polish and everyone loves it.
B00OHZ0Q08|5|I got this as a sample in my January Ipsy  subscription and it is by far the best moisturizer I have ever used. Even better than murad. It smells fresh goes on smooth and light and a little goes a long way. Love love love!!!
B001SZ3K4Y|5|Unfortunately it looks like they've discontinued this shade.
B000G014X6|5|I have used this shampoo for quite a while now and I really like it.  I am not able to get it at Super Target now so I was pleased to find it here.
B001AUOXP2|1|The product arrived but did not foam. I shook it up - still did not foam - a defective product, unfortunately.
B00BRGR752|3|The nail polish set came in the mail just fine. The overall product is nice. Nice colors, stays on quite a while, good selection, etc. I got the set as a Christmas gift for my sister and she was happy with them. Only problem I have/had is that I did not get the pink color or the earring gift that was included with my purchase. I did not notice the earring set when I originally ordered it, but in my confirmation e-mail it included the earring gift, so I guess it should have been included.<br /><br />I e-mailed the Kleancolor company over 10 days ago and have not received a response, unfortunately. That I don't like. Hope to get the pink color & earrings soon. The polish itself is real nice though.
B00APUM972|5|there really easy to use my daughter loves them,she wants me to order her sum more I told her after she uses up them first
B00MTCT7XS|5|This is one of the best lip balms I have used over the years. I will continue to order this product.
B009NNFB0O|5|I've been using this conditioner for roughly the past 6 months, daily, while I grew a beard from scratch.  It works wonderfully and smells great.  Now I can't go a day without.
B00FOBOTD4|5|Love the 2 speed levels and the texture of my skin. In addition, the travel kit is fabulous as I move from home to the gym to work and back to home with ease.
B005IEK3SC|4|I really like this product. The color is a perfect color match to my natural color, and covers very well. The only negative I have is  the seller. It  three weeks to deliver.
B006UET4XE|5|it is sooooo good~<br />i can hardly find an eyeliner which i can apply smoothly on my eyelids, but this is an exception!!
B007RYVFC4|5|Gillette Clear Gel rocks. I got no stinky pits.<br />Mjk
B000K7J1PI|2|I have been using this product for over 10 years. My first unit lasted about eight years no problems. I've had to buy two units with in the last four months because the first one did notfunction properly and broke within a month and I got a second unit recently which I'm hoping will have better productivity. I do believe in the product. I'm just very just appointed  in the latest manufacturing process obviously the quality control has been greatly diminished.
B00DJTSTVQ|5|Beautiful color especially for nail stamping
B00AR2DNMS|4|The chapstick overall was good but was very chocolatey. I know chocolate is a main ingredient for red velvet, but I felt the chocolate was a little over powering. Would be better if it had hints of cream cheese frosting in there too.
B0026IBSVE|5|If you know someone who needs/wants their hair cut frequently, this kit will save you many trips to the barber. The clipper is high quality with self-sharpening blades. It's easy to use, easy to clean. And the accessories, soooo many accessories. Cutting guide attachments for various lengths, angles, sides of head, eyebrows, around ears...combs, clips, scissors, and it all packs up inside a convenient and sturdy carrying case. We think it's super awesome.
B004IBVW86|5|Literally the best eye shadow base/primer I have ever used.... I have always loved nyx products and this tops it off. My eyeshadow stays on all day with no creases or smudging
B002N93ZIA|2|Okay scent, but melted too quickly.  Now I am being required to enter 14 more words.  So here you go.
B00U87LCDE|5|It's beautiful and functional. Great buy!
B008B2Z94Q|1|Got rid of it got the real beauty blender
B0052GJ0I0|1|Production date is 2013.Don't like it. Not worth the price!
B00512CT56|5|this thing works very nice.  on human ore on heat safe wigs its wonderful.  comparable to more expensive ones.
B001H64OTE|4|It's a shower cap. It keeps my hair dry. That's what I needed. Actually, it's much bigger than I thought it would be which is a plus because sometimes I take showers with rollers in my hair and the cap fits over the rollers. Added bonus!
B005PUZZR8|5|It works great, my husband loves it.
B009FP3CRO|2|These are just to dark, and a little &#34;fuzzy' looking- you can't see any of the details. I don't use them.
B0012XO2W6|5|I am very pleased with this product---just the right shade of foundation coupled with excellent protection.  I've been using Elta MD products for years now at the recommendation of a dermatologist and they are effective, smooth, and non-greasy.
B0014P8L9W|5|I have tried several different brands and this one works for me. I noticed my freckles have decreased and my skin has become softer.
B000GDC4J6|5|I am 33 and I used the cream for 20 days. I noticed the obvious wrinkle line on my forehead disappeared. Hopefully it is because of this product.
B001FRPC8M|1|Nothing like the original, this version is a waste of money.
B003MTCY8W|5|I first tried this scent at Nordstrom last year and was blown away at how light the fragance was and how very long lasting it was. I could still smell it on my wrists the next morning! I've received many compliments from others that speak to how subtle yet alluring the scent is. It is truly my all time favorite and very hard to find it seems. The nordstrom near me stopped carrying it.
B000GCSA8G|1|I ordered the perfume and received it very quickly, but sadly found  it to be 'rancid'.  I don't think the company had any idea, as the packages were sealed, so this wasn't deliberate. The really great  thing was the fantastic refund policy the company I purchased it from and from Amazon (I received a full refund with no questions asked).  I will continue to do business with both, as they were super!  I couldn't ask for more fairness in trade, I truly am a satisfied customer, and will continue to shop with these great folks!
B00I1PK62S|3|The product is good. but everything written on it is in japanese.....no instructions in English on how to use the product.
B00GJ1ZNXI|5|I've bought many of these over the years. None of them have had the ball-bearings which makes it easier to roll over your body. Because of these, I don't have to have use it in the shower with soap when I'm wet. Love the concept.
B00SIHJLAC|5|I love these stamping plates. I wish they had more to offer.
B002NYERPU|5|This was a gift for my daughter in law who really loves it.
B0003009NK|5|Love it!
B00GBI590Q|5|After a lot of research I have decided to try this product and I was not disappointed. It feels great, absorbs quickly and leaves the skin smooth and soft. After having used the serum for almost 3 weeks, my skin has definitely improved and I strongly recommend this product.
B000052WYQ|1|I've been taking hair vitamins and noticed I was getting peach fuzz on my face. Tried this 5 times... I used the recommended time and it burned my face. Had to put aloe Vera because it hurt....it took the hair off my face though but every time I used it...it burned and I would only leave it on for 5 minutes. The 5th time I used it I noticed a brown mole on my face...then I noticed two more moles. I never had moles on my face before. It scared me that this product was damaging my face! I stopped using it. I'd rather shave my face then mess up my skin cells. Just sharing what happened to me...
B00ACMHJY6|3|These barrettes are great for thin hair.  They work for me.  I was a bit disappointed there were not more colors.  But, overall, I like them.
B004FJ3QQM|4|This is a high quality and solid haircut but not much of a beard trimmer.. If you are looking for a great hair clipper, this is the one for you. Please don't buy it if you are only getting for beard trimmer.
B00XWFPQB8|5|I love this kabuki brush!  The bristles are very soft and feel very good on my skin.  It applies my powder perfectly and seems to minimize waste of the powder.  I do wish that the brush was retractable or had a cover to protect it, but overall I'm very happy!
B0043TYRGM|5|This is a great color, and I love that it's available on Amazon. It's the exact product used by my stylist, but now I can save money by coloring my own hair.
B000UY9OKS|5|This is a very mild cleanser which when used does not leave the skin feeling dry. It is a product I would repurchase and highly recommend.
B001FYZLPE|5|I bought this shower gel because I wanted something that's as close to natural as possible (i.e., without sodium lauryl sulfate and the other chemical stuff), and is not so strong that it irritates the skin.  Although I don't wrestle in the sports sense of the word, I do wrestle in the game of life, which can leave one just as vulnerable to nasty critters like MRSA, ringworm, etc.  I do work with animals, and sometimes if there's a ringworm breakout among the animals, it can easily get transmitted to humans!<br /><br />I love this product because it's exactly as advertised.  It's very gentle, and has a nice smell -- it's not overbearing in this regard!  It keeps my skin soft, and it has a nice, gentle tingle, thanks to the tea tree oil and eucalyptus!  My husband had MRSA once during a hospital stay, and now I also have won him over, since he has a compromised immune system.  This stuff is great!  And the price is right!  I will be ordering again -- it's well worth the peace of mind it brings!
B006L1DNWY|4|good quality
B0092OUOJ2|5|I LOVE this color! And it's OPI so of course it's a good polish. It's a great winter color too!
B000WHNI2I|5|Work great. Best toothbrush on the market. Practically flosses for you. Would never use anything else now. This toothbrush will clean your teeth like the professionals at the dentist.
B000094ZDX|4|Small and convenient and works well.  Good value for your money.  I recommend this to travelers wishing to save space.
B004BVYT2Y|1|Complete waste of money. Did nothing AT ALL. Ended up in the garbage.
