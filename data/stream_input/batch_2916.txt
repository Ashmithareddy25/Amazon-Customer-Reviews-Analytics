B004AW64CM|5.0|Beautifully done...we loved having the words  to sing along! My granddaughters wanted to watch it again...immediately!<br />It's a real keeper!
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|Found the book very inspiring and I would love to believe it but my experiments didn't really pan out..going to keep working on it though!
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I've read just about all of the Scarpetta series.<br />This book just didn't make the grade.  This<br />series seems to be getting worn out and boring.<br />I actually didn't finish it and that is so not me.<br />I don't think I'd buy another Scarpetta story.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I found the information concise and very helpful.  I was able to follow each step without a problem. It was worth getting!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I started reading this book with my granddaughter because it was required summer reading for her. My 91 year old mother, her great grandmother came into the room and joined us. My mother explained things in the book she remembered from her grandparents. So we had a book club with three generations. I think the older two generations enjoyed it the most.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|The book goes through different stories for some of our favorite characters so seamlessly. We see a more human side to the lead character, Pendergast.  Another great book in the series.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Downloaded this app for my child who is crazy about horses. Other than annoying ads that pop up every few seconds it's great.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Just a very fun read from beginning to end. Story caught my attention and never let go. Recommend to anyone looking for a great story that you don't want to put down.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very well written for the layman, but with copious references for the academics.  I picked up some useful new concepts re Christianity, but this is not new information (how none of those who saw the empty tomb recanted, even under torture, and the Jamesian vs. Pauline factions of the early church). Arslan's account provides a memorable account because it is so well written!
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Departures is an academy award winning Japanese language film that revolves around the concept of death and how society reacts towards it. The story revolves around Daigo, a cellist who has dreams of becoming a professional musician in the orchestra. When the small orchestra he is a part of is disbanded, however, he finds himself without a job or any way of supporting himself or his wife Mika. In order to save money, the couple decides to move back to Daigo's hometown and into his old childhood home. While looking for work, Daigo discovers an ad in the paper that he thinks is for a travel agency only to find out that the job is actually for funeral services. Desperate for money, Daigo takes the job and tells his wife the job is for a travel agency. The film shows how society views working with the dead and yet how important the task is as well as how reverently it is handled. The film takes on some dark subject matter, but it does so with an intermingling of humor that creates a balance that makes the movie exquisite and completely deserving of an Academy Award for best foreign film.<br /><br />One of the best parts of the film, however, comes from the amazing score. The music throughout the film is hauntingly beautiful and inspired. It is composed by Joe Hisaishi who has composed music for several of famed Japanese director Miyazaki (i.e. Kiki's Delivery Service, Castle in the Sky, Howl's Moving Castle, etc.). Hisaishi is a master composer who creates breathtakingly beautiful pieces that fit the story so eloquently.<br /><br />I had to watch this film for a college sociology class on death, grief, and caring. I was apprehensive at first since it was completely in Japanese and is not dubbed so you have to read the subtitles. In the end, however, I'm truly glad my professor chose it because the story is exceptional and will make you both laugh and choke you up. The storyline is beautiful and I strongly recommend not letting the fact that it is a foreign film discourage you from checking it out and giving it a chance; you'll be truly glad you did. I'm not usually the type of person that likes foreign films or even really indie films for that matter, but this movie has made me want to give them more of a chance in the future.ge you from checking it out and giving it a chance; you'll be truly glad you did.

B008602KQI|4.0|This film kept my attention at  all times.  There were really no times in the movie where there wa a dull portion.
1419847309|5.0|Christopher Reeve IS Superman !! Great DVD Just wish Warner would give us the Salkind International Version Next on Blu Ray
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I watched it once out of curiosity and am now hooked!  I have watched the first four seasons in about a week and a half.  It is exciting, very violent, language is pretty rough but it has not deterred me.  I am on the edge of my seat most of the time it is on and cannot wait to watch the next one.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you have been looking for the perfect dystopian, MMORPG, 80's homage thriller, look no further than Ready Player One. Part YA Sci-fi, part immersive virtual RPG, part conspiracy, and all sorts of 80's &uuml;ber-geekery, this book is one of a kind. Perfect for the 30 - 40 something crowd and just as perfect for the teen reader looking for something a little different. Not sure you get how awesome the 80's were? Pick up this book and educate yourself.
B00BBW14YC|5.0|Definitely worth watching!!  Great story, great acting.  After a few minutes we were no longer aware of the subtitles.  Lots of funny moments and some that really make you think
B007F1SE46|3.0|Well it was a typical Gary Marshal movie, very sweet, entertaining and star studded. Nothing exceptional, but a sweet movie nonetheless .
B00BP3DPJY|5.0|This is an incredible album. Each time I listen to it, i have a new favorite song, This is the first Phosphorescent album I purchased, and I am definitely picking up the back catalog!
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I STARTED WATCHING THIS PROGRAM WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. IT WAS VERY INTERESTING AND CONTINUED WATCHING IT THROUGH ALL OF THE SEASONS.  I DID NOT WATCH THIS SEASON ON TV BUT AM EXCITED TO WATCH IT.
B00DHQ208Y|3.0|I think this is a good album, but not a great one.  My main beef, which has not lessened from the first listen, is that many of the songs sound the same.  This album does not seem to explore the range of sounds that other &#34;psychedelic&#34; bands such as The Black Angels and Rose Windows do.  I still think it was a decent value at five dollars.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|SAW THIS IN THE MOVIES ON BIG SCREEN.  WOW.  I COULD NOT WAIT UNTIL IT CAME OUT ON DVD SO THAT MY HUSBAND AND SISTERS CAN SEE IT.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Quick read. Easy to follow, with some pulp detective novel clichés, but enough suspense and surprises to make it interesting. Mainly read it to get an intro to the series.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|I would recommend the read to anyone great insight on what people are thinking. This is a must read for anyone who deals with the public daily.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|If it were not for Stan Lee and his partner there wouldn't be any Marvel comics or movies. My husband and I have enjoyed all the Marvel movies.  The more action hero's in the movie the better. Robert Downey Jr. is not slouch either!

B000VWMUMS|4.0|This is a good concert. Clapton Is good but not at his best. I'm glad Townsend got him out and back on stage. Don't get me wrong there are still some strong performances on here. If your a Clapton fan I would definitely include this in your collection

B00AIBZJS4|5.0|Amazing, music took us away on an amazing journey. We all Loved it :) hope to buy more Cirque soon.
B00AF6B22E|1.0|It wasn't stated by my seller, at all, when I purchased multiple copies as gifts, that this edition had NO slipcover!  That is a HUGE part of any purchase as it adds SO MUCH to the &#34;presentation&#34;!
B000FC146C|5.0|If you've seen the mini-series many years ago, this is the book for you. It gives you all the back history and fills in some of the gaps. If you don't like saga novels, this one is not for you. It is definitely a saga.
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|An artist at his peak of his career. John Mayer is second to none with catchy tunes recorded at the highest quality.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved every chapter of the book, the characters and you could really visualize how things looked, kept you on the edge.
B000P6PVLC|1.0|Not even worth a detailed review summary.  Brad Pitt does act well; however, the story line is poor...and I am being nice.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|By book two you are absolutely hooked on trying to figure out the characters and what will happen next very exciting book

B0097BTSSS|5.0|I love this album, I have her albums digital but wanted to have it on vinyl. I got it really fast and was happy with my purchase.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|This movie had a good concept, but at times the over the top use of CG seemed cheesey.  Parts of the acting were great and Morgan Freeman as always was genius. Woodie was cool too. I.Fischer is a treat as always.  Overall, a fun film.
B000000992|5.0|got this as a gift for a friend. Its one of my favorite albums. Need to buy this for myself. I ordered it and it go here so fast I love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a good game can get more horses easy<br />Loved to play this game<br />you can choose the name of horse quickly<br />this game is perfect for all ages from 5 to any age
B005EEQN8A|5.0|I love this record! Sounds great, no problems with it, and it got shipped in a very great and fast paced manner.
B006VJMZXY|2.0|Here we go again following the relentless pursuit of a fathers ambition, not for his daughters but through them for himself.  Phillipa Gregory writes this very now familiar plot over and over in different guises that usually stand up. But this time it just seems like a rehash to me.  Same story, slightly different characters, nothing new.  I'm a fan of Gregory's but this book was one I could easily put down.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Loved the original Judge Dredd so I had to watch this. I was under Prime so it was Free and the move was good! Lots of cool shots and a good plot. There is even a good set up for more movies to come.
B00CCX9DUG|4.0|Have read most of Phillipa Gregory's historical fictional novels.  It's improved my knowledge and understanding of that era of British history many fold.  I liked the White Princess better than most because the main character was more likeable than some of the other heroines.  It was refreshing to have her marrying for love and mothering her children.
B00D5YNQWM|5.0|If you are an aerosmith fan just about anything they do is good, love this band and this dvd,it's great
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This is my favorite RPG for a mobile device, if you are familiar with Diablo  it is a slightly different, much cheaper, not as gory, version of that. I really, really, REALLY enjoy it...but there is one major problem, you only have the r potions, and once you use one it takes 2 hours to get it back, or you can use gems to buy more, however you start out with 100 gems and spend 20 each time you want another potion...if there was a way to pick up potions from enemies that would be great! Please think about that for the next update :) other than that, the game is EXCELLENT!
B003VA3JUO|5.0|This is one of those older movies that's still god to watch over several times, arrived on time and in good condition
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome because it is fun and very affordable to have a good idea that we can get it to have a good time anyway to have a good time for their

B00422LESO|5.0|Enjoy reading all of Shannon Hale's books and I'm not a young reader of fiction.  Author develops characters so the reader can visualize them.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|The abuse and atrocities occurring in N.Korea are unimaginable... Take the time and read what's going on. I couldn't put it down.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am in live with this game. the graphics are great, the runs are fun and how can you not love the minions! Love the new beach update. keep up the great work!!!
B00E6887H0|3.0|Ry Cooder fans like me will want this in their collections, but it's not one of his best albums by any means.  There are some great moments, but also some rather weaker stuff and the live sound isn't great.<br /><br />Good bits first: there are cracking versions of Vigilante Man and Crazy 'Bout An Automobile and there is, of course, some really fine guitar work in plenty of other places.  The opening of Volver Volver is wonderful, for example...but the rest of it really isn't up to much, including some pretty dodgy tuning in Juliette Commagere's vocals.  And that rather sums up the album for me - great in places but pretty ordinary overall.<br /><br />Part of the problem is the sound, which is woolly, boomy and indistinct a good deal of the time.  There is also a lot of intrusive audience noise, including a lot of that whooping in completely inappropriate places which is all about drawing attention to the whooper and nothing to do with appreciation of the music.  It really needed to be mixed down because for me it spoils quite a lot of the quieter bits.<br /><br />I've loved Ry Cooder's music since I discovered Bop Till You Drop in 1979 (better late than never) and I'll certainly listen to anything by him, but I can't se me playing this very often.  I suspect I'd have loved it if I'd been there, but as a record I can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is fun!<br />And the horses are beautiful!<br />Competitions are the best!<br />I love it!<br />So many choices of food!
B001NHNG64|3.0|The plot was interesting although I'd prefer a few more twists. The concept was new involving crime on an national scale. Lee did bring in a taste of variety and that's why I kept on reading.<br /><br />I love Jack Reacher however the action needed a boost.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Action is good, I think the portrayal of life on earth when there is not much around is pretty good. Concerning the cloning of humans I think it shows that human cloning could cheapen one's view on human life.  If a person dies well I just go make another one.  There are other ethical issues involved but I won't go into them here.  I only want to say the movie was good.  The acting is good too, plus there are some surprises too.  I usually enjoy movies when Tom Cruise or Morgan Freeman are in them.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Unfortunately, Yahoo mail has been getting worse over the last couple of years.  Ads that are designed to actually make it look like mail to you and &#34;Trick&#34; you into opening it...yes...designed by Yahoo to do this.  If I was starting new, I would not sign up for Yahoo mail.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It is a very good game just make stuff a little easier to get. Because right now things are kinda impossible to achieve .
B001JYEMOQ|1.0|The only people that got fooled in this movie were the viewers hoping this wouldn't be a waste of time. Ripley is a sick and twisted character. Why would anyone write this book, write a screenplay, make a movie, or like a movie about a lying, thieving, murdering sodomite?
B0084670FU|1.0|I can't believe I even followed this one to the end.  Aside from the fact that it's boring, the conclusion is just a big political statement about illegals, terrorists and gun control.  I don't like movies that have an agenda, but it's not even entertaining in the process.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|I would have given this a 5 star rating, but the manual to install it should have had more written instructions for how to install it. It took me two hours to get it right, the pictures didn't help much. My 4th gen I7 stays right around 91 degrees fahrenheit.
B00932A4XE|4.0|All scenarios of expectant motherhood are seen here represented by the different lives of different women.  It's fun to watch and I really enjoyed it.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|One of the top 3 teacher novels.  Really enjoying this one.  Can't put it down and really don't remember many this well written
B0015DRPJU|5.0|A good distraction, great story flow and at times a fun read.the characters are developing nicely and there are no unnecessary side stories
B002WY65VU|5.0|This is a superfun movie you can watch over and over. Great to lift your spirits and make you chuckle. One quote &#34;a big B.M.&#34;
B00F1BFRA6|1.0|1. Anemic drama. Drama is agon or contest, conflict, clash, disputation, etc., between pro- and antagonist, one of each at least. Even when one side is hostile fate or what the gods, God, history, society, etc., fling, throw against the promulgated hero and his cohort. Even when alleged lackeys and other social inferiors, impudent or inept, pester our dear noble sire, they will have some purpose, cause, justification, inspiration, cleverness, or whatever it takes, to make them worthy opponents, make the drama dramatic.<br /><br />But in \\"Downton\\" all potentially dramatic conflict is glossed over, brushed aside, too easily, unconvincingly, like dandruff on the Earl's tux. Even the deaths are convenient. The show is more infomercial than drama -- a soft-core selling of certain country mansions and owners. Has tourist traffic there increased? Do more good citizens see the glamour of the top 1% and understand that they deserve more power? That little people should be happy to serve?<br /><br />2. Strange rituals. A grown man dresses in a tuxedo to visit the bedroom of another grown man and help him, although he is able-bodied, get dressed into a fancier tuxedo, then finishes by brushing dandruff off the man's tux. Solemn, serious, like a religious ceremony. And this today has a fan-club.<br /><br />3. Hollowness of mind. Indicated by the apparent dominance over the Earl of contact language, the function of language we use when we ask the most asked question in our language, \\"How are you?\\", and give the most given answer, \\"Fine, how are you?\\".  Yes, necessary to some extent to establish that both sides know the language and its little rites of etiquette and are quite willing to obey these for the ease of relations or simply to get going. But what if all other functions of language -- and therefore thought and imagination -- and all social issues become mere extensions of this petty procedure and its superficiality, insouciance, and never go past these limits? When all questions and all answers are only repetition of formalities, customary chit-chat, ritualized trifles, signifying nothing but delusional shine around a hollow core or sordid mess? Call it entropy of spirit. What would Hamlet instead say, in mockery? Or Lear's bright fool?<br /><br />4. The Earl's rite of dinner and coziness of mind and the social hierarchy must not be disturbed -- as if that's the height of all human endeavor: dinner impeccably served. Through the 19th century aristocrats were already portrayed as more often useless or feeble-minded or archaic than not, as educated philistines or hollow costumes on parade, yet still with dangerous power over others, and then were blamed more than others for the blinkered narrow-mindness which led to the disaster known as the Great World War. Yet all this is swept under the fancy rugs of Downton Abbey. Where is the Spanish Inquisition when you need it? And aren't these the people who inspired Monty Python?<br /><br />5. Two antidotes to \\"Downton\\": [[ASIN:B000S6EKXE The Remains Of The Day]] and [[ASIN:B000305ZYS Fanny and Alexander (The Criterion Collecton Theatrical & Television Version)]]. In \\"Remains\\" the butler and housekeeper come to recognize that their superb efforts on behalf of the lord of the manor were wasted due to the latter's sheer banality of thought and imagination, too fogged to clearly see the realities confronting him. \\"Fanny and Alexander\\" presents drama about European urban haute bourgeoise civilization at its height near the turn of the century, a family engaged both for and against aims beyond smug dinner every day forever.<br /><br />6. Fellini was a master of Dinner Disrupted. I'd love to see what he might have done with one long Downton dinner not going smoothly. When polite chit-chat and haute ritual pigging-out and obedient servants are confronted by something more substantial and subversive, with humor. My imagined scenario: one or two of the daughters on a trip to London meet a gang based somewhat on the Bloomsbury group and associates, and invite them to Downton where dinner then features the Earl and his family and other proper lords and ladies on one side of a long table, and on the other side characters loosely based on Virginia Wolf, her lover Vita, and Lytton Strachey, J.M. Keynes, Clive Bell, Bertie Russell and Alfie Whitehead, and T.S. Eliot and Aldous Huxley, and Lydia Lopokova too . . .  After more than a few drinks, the guests become impudent, more lewdly loquacious, confrontative and rambunctious. It will end very badly of course, interestingly so. Set it in that cruelest month, April.<br /><br />7. There are many buildings more admirable than Downton Abbey n&eacute;e Highclere Castle. The Scrovegni Chapel in Padua was financed in hope of atonement by a wealthy family famous for usury and therefore fearing punishment in Hell; Giotto's frescoes there offer a vision of Christianity at its best. The Palazzo dell'Accademia in Mantua was built, organized by aristocrats and other eminent citizens to promote knowledge and cultural advancement; its beautiful theater featured science demonstrations as well as art performances (the first musical evening presented a prodigy named Mozart). One can visit houses where Leonardo painted, Beethoven composed, Kafka wrote --all more admirable than the doings at Downton. Or sit in the Theater of Dionysus in Athens, or stand in front of the remains of Simon the Cobbler's shop where Socrates (not well-dressed) and his gang annoyed passers-by and talked of matters, questions unwelcome at Downton Abbey. I'd like to see more dramas set in these places, about these people. And the Baltimore housing projects in the first season of \\"The Wire\\" hosted more interesting conversations too.<br /><br />8. \\"Tell me what you pay attention to and I will tell you who you are\\" -Jos&eacute; Ortega y Gasset. The spiritual crisis of our age is revealed by our difficulty in differentiating between low and high, the slimy or stupid and the sublime, the tacky and the transcendent.

B009CRJLHU|5.0|This book is so good which is why I gave it a rating of 5 stars, it is well deserved! I finished the whole book in 2 1/2 days. It kept me on the edge of my seat, very interested, & not to mention I simply couldn't put the book down! The title is what got me to buy it & the first chapter kept me going until I finished it. Now I'm reading &#34;Walking Disaster&#34; the sequel to &#34;Beautiful Disaster&#34; so far I'm hooked.
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you have any interest at all in some of the biggest hits in the past 30 years, you'll really dig this documentary. It also gives you a bit of technical insight as to the tools that can be used to create hit records.
B006LSZECO|5.0|couldn't put this book down and it's not my usual genre............<br />macabre and calculated..........what some people think they can do and get away with................
B002EDH0FE|1.0|i remember the trailers being intriguing when it came out. i fully regret my actions. everything in this movie is annoying and nonsensical: the plot, the growling narrative, the cheesy action sequences, and the feeble attempts at humor or depth, where different cast members throughout the movie were guessing at where the punchline was. none of them found it. the ending made no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />avoid this movie like the plague.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I live these books. The love story is incredible. Honesty can not wait for the movies. It is a great escape into the erotic unknown.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Exactly as described... fits my purpose. Great length to charge my kindle ... Not too short... Not too long. It is just right....
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This is a great bag for the price.<br />The quality is not bad at all.<br />Enough space for basic amount of SLR camera gear and accessories.<br />It is quite strong and cushioned, comfortable to carry around.<br />I would buy it again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There is nothing I can say about this other than I love it!  Sometimes I find myself saying &#34;Are you kidding me?  Are you really doing that after he just told you not to?&#34;  Then I laugh!  This is a suspenseful thriller of a series and I can hardly wait for Season 4 to start!
B004U8VX2M|5.0|The granddaddy of Downton Abbey. Rich in characters and story lines. Steeped in the history of turn of century England and beyond. Beautifully presented. Do yourself a favor and watch it again or for first time.
B00CJ1C7UO|5.0|Awesome album for any Amorphis fan or fan of melodic metal.  Great mixture of clean and growled vocals.  Strong and heavy quitar riffs.Favorite songs are Hopeless Days, Shades of Gray, Mission and the Wanderer
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This is a survival story about the man and the cat. They each had something to give and together formed and unlikely team. Bob is a smart cat and James needs a reason to help himself out of drugs and a bad life. Bob is his reason. Bob seems to know James needs him and Bob needs the home James has to offer.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|The title says it all. This is a great game, and a great app. It's not always as in depth as I would like, and it's a shame copyright is always in the way with titles like this. But, regardless, this is an exceptionally fun game for the tablet.
B008ROZAQU|5.0|Great Music, photography, action, humor, and John Wayne. Always one of my favorites and I love it every time I watch it. It was fun to see it on my Kindle screen and I felt more up close to the beautiful animals and scenery of Africa even though on a small screen. Sound was great and I will watch it again and still come away with the same GREAT feelings and enjoyment!
B0094KT9Y0|5.0|When my daughter loved to watch toystory and now that I have another young one he really enjoys it! Thank you!
B007FKI9G0|5.0|Absolutely one of the funniest movies of all time. The first mockumentary may still be the best.  Rob Reiners directorial debut, but with Christopher Guest and gang, it really seems like a team effort.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome!!!!!!!!!! the graphics are great the minions still look like taters tots and it is toatally awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />you will not find a game this awesome that has taters tots with hair
B009X01C64|2.0|I returned this stand, altho advertised to fit Kindle Fire 8.9, it did not hold the fire securely. Too bad
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|What were they trying to accomplish with this movie? If it was unusual visual effects that are really neat then they hit a home-run. If they were trying to create a great storyline with a nice climatic ending then they failed miserably. I won't get into the physics of why things are like they are on their planet(s?) or the anti-big-oil undertone that may or may not have been intentional. The theme of forbidden love has been beaten to death. There was no depth to the characters. Nearing the end of the movie, I found myself not caring what happened to either one of them. I was getting bored with the effects because I started thinking about how beautiful our planet is. I'm thankful I don't have to look up and see a city-scape in the sky. It's really a two star movie, but I gave it an extra one for making me appreciate our world more.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Wow I downloaded this app and I thought it was fast but when I tried to watch a vid it was a super slow loader
B00CATSONE|4.0|Very nice<br />A fast read.<br />He gives insights into Tesla that others have not revealed that are interesting and noteworthy.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|We enjoyed this movie.  It showed  that racism isn't necessary!  They both played an excellent part in the movie and portrayed love to each other.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this series!!!! I would recommend it to everyone (of mature age and mind that is). I have become addicted.
B00F35BV64|5.0|This movie was a lot of fun and I really enjoyed the revamping of the Wrath of Khan story as well as the many references to the original series. The producers did an excellent job of choosing the cast.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game.  Even after you solve levels you can still challenge yourself to improve your score.  I also like the hints so you don't get stuck and give up.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|after \\"The four steps to Epiphany\\" and \\"The Lean Startup\\", \\"Running Lean\\" is a king of summary of the two previous books with a lot of new things as well. Definitely worth reading.
B0017P520U|2.0|The animation was &#34;sub par&#34; Ray Winstone carries the film- is the only good aspect of the movie. Hollywood ruined the epic story by including women as temptress - it took a hugh leap to modernize a classic epic poem...why?
B00CL0J99K|4.0|Watching it upon release, I was struck by how different this film was in pacing, storytelling, and maturity. Initially, I was taken aback as some of the disappointed reviewers were. To say \\"Iron Man 2\\" is a superior film is sour grapes...that movie meanders, is too long. All three movies lack a spectacular finish, but \\"Iron Man 3\\" dares to not repeat the formula of the first two: metal on metal mayhem. IM3 explores the relationship between a man and his life priorities as he matures (somewhat late). In the comic books, the hero almost always chooses duty over love. In this movie, as in real life, things are not so simple.<br /><br />As for the Mandarin, you cannot in 2013 bring that character to the silver screen as is. Sorry, that is just how things are now. This isn't a Jess Franco/Christopher Lee movie from the 1970s. I thought it was handled as best it could. I did not feel the impact of the other adversaries in the movie, maybe that was more effective in the comic book storyline.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie is tightly and expertly constructed and moves quickly. The funny moments are very humorous, Robert Downey is charming and multi-dimensional and less of a caricature than in IM and IM2. A really fun, solid action film that just happens to feature superpowered characters.
0375869026|5.0|This book was wonderful!  Everyone should read it, especially children in middle school so they don't let fear of someone different trump kindness, empathy and thoughtfulness.  One of the best books I'<br />ve read.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|I got this controller a couple of month ago and upon opening it I found the joysticks were VERY stiff at first yet the more you use it gets loose like my xbox360 controllers. This game will ONLY work with a select 8 gameloft games if your device is not jailbroken, if your device is jailbroken (like mine) you can go into cydia and download an app called blutrol which will allow you to use it with any game.<br />id say if you are a serious gamer this a must have for you!!!!!<br /><br />PROS:<br />easy to use<br />easy to set up<br />great price ($6)<br />friends are jealous of you<br />long battery life<br /><br />CONS:<br />NOT A LOT OF GAMES WORK WITH IT<br />joysticks are VERY stiff at first<br />smaller than expected<br />joysticks don't move as fluidly as xbox controllers
B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book. It's a bit confusing but it makes perfect sense in the end. It's one of my favorite books. I wish it was longer.
B00E978FGQ|1.0|What a piece of crap, my God! I forced myself to keep watching since I'd paid for the rental...When I reached the 42 minutes I sad \\"That's it. I'm not wasting any more of my time on this garbage!\\" No dialogues, TERRIBLE acting and idiotic plot. Seriously, not even worth it for the special effects. I cannot believe Morgan Freeman is in this movie! After the failed attempt to watch this piece of junk, I watched the trailer and sure enough they show a mixed of scenes that, when put together, it makes it look like it's gonna be an awesome thriller...Boy, did I fall for this one! I finally stopped the movie and watched a Stephen Hawking's documentary on Amazon Prime about the origin of the Universe (free, btw). It was an hour and thirty minutes long but it went by like in 5 minutes. So fascinating and mind blowing...I truly enjoyed it, even though I wanted to watch a good flick. A well done documentary with great special effects can be 100 times better that a movie with Mr. Caine and Freeman...Unbelievable.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|All these months and now I have an annoying ad every single time I load the game. Yes, it is a 'free' app, (remember this is Disney)unless you actually want to progress in the game in less than a year. I think I've purchased enough pearls to no longer call it free. It is shi**y that now this ad is inserted. Had it occurred in the beginning, I never would have continued the game and I certainly would not have purchased items in the game. I would rather pay for the game at the onset than to be marketed to continually.
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|pretty cool app for my kindle fire.  Now you can boost up the base and high end the treble. Or choose pre set modes.  IE. Concert.<br />--Jeeves
1416972242|5.0|Better than City of Bones. It was amazing and a quick read. I can't wait to read the next installment of this amazing series and I hope it happens soon or else I'll explode!!!
1400052181|5.0|Great book. Must read for everyone. I will pass this on to my daughter for her school reading. Thanks for the fast shipping.
0812550706|5.0|Who would have thought I would have loved this book so much? This is one of the only books that I have read and have believed it deserved any of the awards that decorate its cover. This book was superbly written. The characters were relatable, lovable, hateable, and mainly just plain real. (And I say this as a fourteen year old girl who knows nothing about commanding forces.) I loved Ender, felt sorry for him, routed for him, and yelled in outrage at what they were doing to him just in the unfairness of it all.<br />This is a timeless story. It was exciting with twists and turns every page. It went quickly and only took a few days for me to finish. This has become an instant favorite for me, and I know that this will not be the first time I will read this marvelous book. It was such an amazing book! I would suggest for anyone to read it, no matter their age or gender.<br />My one and only fault in this book is the last sentence. Is ending was great but the last sentence... It was mildly frustrating.<br />Such. An. Amazing. Book.
B004V9MU86|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it was an interesting perspective on the 2nd world war, well written, emotive and just fabulous. Sad and uplifing - I highly recommend it.
0316077046|4.0|This book is a classic sequel. It was worse than the first book, by far, yet it was still a good book. In this case, the majority of the book was just sad. The recipe for Beautiful Darkness? Beautiful Creatures+ sadness= Beautiful Darkness.<br />All in all, it was a nice book. Not a lighthearted beach read, but still better than the average book. The first hundred pages or so could have been a little more condensed than they were, but I am not complaining. I enjoyed it. Enough that I read it in two days.<br />I still love Ethan. How could there be a more pleasant guy to narrate this book? He's a super awesome character who's extremely lovable.<br />The plot was engaging and fast moving (after about the 100 pages of setup).<br />All in all, if you read Beautiful Creatures, go ahead and give it a shot. You'll probably like it.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Love this game. Some levels are easy and some are very hard. It is fun to see how you measure up against friends.
1416955070|5.0|A great book with a nice pace. Various twists and turns leave you begging for the next book. (And to watch the new movie once it comes on the big screen!) All in all, I am very glad that I ended up reading it :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is so nice to have the Bible at my fingertips.<br />Easy to download.  We like have the choice of the Bible on out Kindle Fire.
B00BP0O7QW|5.0|This book... I'm not sure how to describe it. It was anywhere from laugh-out-loud hilarious to I-am-seriously-crying depressing. It was a roller coaster of ups and down, lefts and rights, but I feel impacted having read it. The many quotes you hear from this book plastered everywhere are not even the good ones. This book makes you think. About the good and the bad. And I can't imagine anyone reading it and not appreciating life even more than they already do. Charlie is, without a doubt, the person we all think we are. (Whether we actually are or not). All in all, if you are considering reading this book, read it because you never know and it might make you an even better person than you already are.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|If your a line cook, READ THIS BOOK! If your not but your intrigued by the restaurant industry then by all means read this book. If your just a fan of Anthony bourdain then you will love it. But being a young line cook/aspiring chef myself I couldn't put it down, and I mean that literally, I read this book cover to cover in one sitting! If you don't love this book then it's just not for you, but if your even considering it (which at this point I assume you are) then stop thinking and just read it, I promise you wont regret it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A contorted saga on the way to a reunion of unknown family and long forgotten love.  All in difference to the realities of their world.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|So touchingly honest and brave.  There are more good people in the world than bad, but this book shows how when placed in certain situations we have to make a choice which we will be--every time.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|Mud was a movie that lived up to more than its previews. With in-depth character interaction and a few twists and turns along the way, Mud was a really solid two-hour piece of entertainment that I will definitely want to watch again.
0786886811|5.0|I promised my friend I would wait til she was back to crack this open but I couldn't wait. It has so much good information about the food.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Great popcorn flick, especially if you have some interest in Star Trek. My family and I enjoyed it very much.
B005SEYOXW|5.0|One of the best shows ever. I wish they could bring it back. The character development is one of the best I've ever seen. By the end of the first episode, the hooks are in you. By the end of the third, you're a browncoat for life!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater and I knew I would add it to my collection at home. Tom Cruise may have a &#34;unique&#34; personal life, but I think too many people use that as an excuse not to give him the credit he deserves as a serious science fiction actor. But I want to commend Amazon on the way they handled my lost package. The postal service lost it and Amazon had a replacement in my mailbox the very next evening after I contacted them. As long they keep making this kind of effort in customer service I will keep buying from them. Thanks
B00BXZ3D6Y|4.0|I am not sure how to access the recordings I've saved...there is no obvious button to push once you've moved on from a recording.  But I know there is a way, and I will research it to find out.  It has been such a help to me with my first ever acting class.  I can say my lines and experiment with different interpretations and get instant playback to see what I like and don't like about my delivery.  And it's free!!  Highly recommend.  The only reason for 4 stars is that they didn't make it easy for clueless non-techies like myself to access the old recordings...and my Nexus 7 sound is not very good, which has nothing to do with the Voice Recorder.

B00821OX98|5.0|This is what could happen with any invasion, alien or human.  This can be a survival teaching tool for any attack.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|I was hoping for lighthearted comedy, I instead got unbearably stupid. The humor made me cringe. I think there were moments where I found myself embarrassed for the movie, if such a thing is possible.
1451627297|5.0|This is the very first book by Stephen King that I have read.  I have always been turned off by his horror type books/movies.  I ordered it without realizing who the arthor was upon the reccommendation from GMA one morning.  The book is really great.  It pulls you into the time and holds you to the story and you can't let go.  Since finishing the book I passed it on to 3 other people who do not read his books.  They loved it too.
B0044WQHA2|4.0|A fun classic. I remember watching it in the theatre when it came out. Man am I old?!  Copolla and Lucas got their start w this one. Must see
0375869026|5.0|Would recommend this to be on everyone's kid's bookshelf! As a mom of a little boy with a craniofacial syndrome I wish everyone could read this book. I'm currently reading it to my daughter who is almost 9 and she identifies so much with Auggie's older sister in this book. Please take the time to share this with your kids or your classroom, well worth the read :)
B002APU580|5.0|Love this movie.  Can't wait to get my copy so I can watch it over and over. Try it yourself!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Omg! I loved this book so much. All though you will cry a lot. Happy Hunger Games! And may the odds always be in your favor.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Love the simplicity but I dislike the adds at the beginning of every round may be once every 5 or so but the game was easy to use and navigate I gave it a liberating because of the adds
B00992CF6W|5.0|Good for thrilling God  is  Good to us<br />Turpentine is hated in minecraft pocket edition good pocket editor minecraft is cool
B009OJ01HA|5.0|Intelligent, gripping, twisting. I'm amazed that this film is not recognized more widely. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant and Ryan Gosling is the perfectly matched foil.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game in the world the updates are.aswesome I liked the beach won I have a high score so what updates are there gonna be
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The right one and I am enjoying my Kindle again so its great so I hope that this helps you with your service
0670014893|5.0|Just finished A Delicate Truth. John Le Carre at 81 has really perfected his ability to create genuinely human -and engaging- characters, to devise intricate plots with slowly revealed, surprising complexities and reversals and to write with so many accomplished and varied narrative techniques and a nuanced, polished and almost poetic prose.<br />At 81 he also wants  -once more- to make clear his anger and disgust with the Intelligence/Crass Politicians/Corporate mercenary security and combat forces that shape and control our perceptions while they steer us into their wars.<br />May remind of Dickens, but the one small individual who may, by his whistle blowing, in some ways alter or disrupt their powerful grip on us , has many modern parallels in the Assanges, Mannings, Snowdens, the leakers of the Abu Ghraib photos and many others.<br />I think I'm going to read it again right away.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Arnold is like Stallone in Copland, but less burned-out and more aggressive.  Clint Eastwood with old muscles and an Austrian squint.  He can still kick butt, while the young punk drug lord can drive the bejesus out of a tweaked ZR1 vette.  Action with a tried and true premise.  Five-stars and six-beer rating.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|Francine even got through to me - an avid hoarder.  Great ideas and great philosophy- highly recommended.  Even if you have no aspiration to become a minimalist.
B00EL8JCGU|3.0|This reminds me a lot of Independence Day with Will Smith, whereas you have a killer cast and huge budget with an old story.  The difference is that Independence Day didn't pull this maddening camera crap, whereas they get so close and spastic that you can't tell what is happening, even with replay, slow-mo, enlargement, and a translator from the production crew.  And are we through with zombies yet?  Now that we tweaked them to run, why not drive cars and fly planes?  How about a major wrap with hybrid zombie vampire werewolf whatevers?  Digression . . . the film holds your attention and has some fear factor - Pitt is always watchable - but it wasn't worth an early fee I paid for being hooked by enticing trailers.  To quote Pitt in Killing Them Softly, &#34;It's not a country, just a business.&#34;  Now gimme my money back.  Lesson learned.  Next time I'll wait till the fee drops.
B008LH4YYC|4.0|Pretty good companion for the ES3 File Explorer program. I use File Explorer on my Vizio Vtab1008 tablet.<br />Since I have a few users in my household I've password protected the File Explorer to avoid accidental mishaps, like, someone deleting the operating system, for example. :~(<br />But when using the ES Task Manager I found a back door to the File Explorer bypassing the password screen.<br />While in ES Task Manager simply tap the File Explorer icon and you're in the ES File Explorer - no password needed.<br />Task Manager is not password protected, if it was than I'd have no problem with this feature at all since you wouldn't be able to gain access to one program without a password for the other.<br />The other thing that bothered me was Advertisements! Come on guys! You have 2 really good utility programs, File Explorer does NOT have any annoying ads but this program, Task Manager, does.<br />These are the two reasons you get 4 instead of 5 stars.<br />Task Manager itself is a good stable program and has lots of useful features - some features that I can't access in the default task manager on my tablet are accessible through ES Task Manager.<br /><br />Would I recommend this program? - Absolutely I would. It's a very good utility.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game. It has some glitches sometimes but I still love it that way. It is the best game ever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it it is fun for the whole family all ages enjoy playing it and do so often love the new levels
B004X80QNG|4.0|I like the calendar, task planner and the fact that when I have an appointment I can actually pull up a map with directions.

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Constantly disconnects, unable to play paid for rented movies from Google Play or even watch Youtube videos.<br /><br />*Updated direct from Google's technical support: \\"I appreciate your response, for the Chromecast to work its best it is recommended that it be within 20ft of the router with one wall of distance between. \\"<br /><br />My Chromecast was 30 feet away from my WiFi base and had severe connection issues. I bought a Roku to replace the Chromecast and the WiFi works just fine now.<br /><br />If you're more than 1 room away from your router, pass up on the cheap Chromecast and get another solution.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie is a live comic book, remember back to when you read these as a kid with amazement and awe.<br /> for those of you who haven't read a comic book in your lives , I'm sad for you , but look at it as off the wall imagination and you'll<br /> love it.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you enjoy standard songs from an older period, you'll love the album.  It lives up<br />to its name and you will recognize most of the songs.  You are already familiar with<br />the stellar voice that Susan Boyle has.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|This book is fantastic. Plenty of twists and action. I don't generally read often but I could not put this series down.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I read these books at least annually - so upset when he passed away.  Books are funny, sad, and a real feel for the area they are set in and the life of a country veterinarian.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book was excellent. It shows that even in the midst of war there is humanity. The story brought both sides of the war to life. I would definitely recommend this book
B000W93CHC|4.0|I have enjoyed reading the book. Although it is long, it is easy to read. I have become very attached to the characters and their stories which are woven throughout the book.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very addicting<br /><br /> game , it is hard to get cash without paying money. There needs to be a way to get cash for free to expand.
B00A285OOW|2.0|I was disappointed in<br />The White Princess. It was very repetitive and I just wanted the author to &#34;get on with it&#34; and stop repeating the themes.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|I bought this for my little sister and we both sat to watch it and I actually really liked it. If you like or don't mind watching My Little Pony this you'll like this movie they came out with. And they music is very catchy
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is the best game ever just wow. The best game in history. I plan on playing this game forever
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|enjoyed the actors and script - am looking fwd to viewing season 3. also liked white collar, drp dead diva, walking dead, Friday nite lites, justified. on Netflix when the end of one episode ends, you can watch the next one without having to go back to the beginning to select the intant , suits, and finally episode. wish prime was set up that way.
B00CO6QGCE|3.0|Self explanatory title please. Oh and also I love how you edit your own songs from your own library instead of using some lame preloaded loop crap.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|Wonderful film.  I know that I will watch it many times and marvel at the special effects and the avatars. If anyone enjoys fantasy films, this is the best of the best.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|At least the original Dredd was campy and had Stallone in it. This more modern version retains the violence of the original but lacks the hope of the older film.<br />In a word it was Dreddful.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I constantly use Feedly, seemlessly across desktop, iphone, and kindle.  Easily the best rss client I've used.  I'm glad Google forced me off Reader:)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Have had this headphones for 4 years now and they are still working great. no problems with them other than that the ear pads started to get worn down so i bought some new ones, the sound is just amazing in this headphones and i would buy another pair of them when my other ones break down. This headphones can really take a hit, I have been using them weekly for 4 year and I usually just trow them in my backpack without the protective bag around it, and they still work well. the cord is doing well and like i said earlier they are still working like they wear new. The sound quality on this ones are also amazing, if you want anything close to this that i have tried you need to go 2-3 times the price.<br /><br />I use a lot of time traveling around and if i sit in a car or flying i will use them for hours at the time, I can easily wear them for 5-6 hours at the time listening to music, listening to audio books or watching movies, they work great for everything. It don't matter if it is loud music in the car or you are on the plan. The headphone block out most of the sound. At the same time you can play the music as loud as you want to without the guy next to you hearing anything.<br /><br />I would recommend buying this headphones to every one. they are maybe not the most stylish ones, but they are dissent looking and if you care more about the look then the sound than you can spend your money one a lot of other headphones, but this headphones have the best sound in there price range. unless you a looking for a pair $200-300+ you this is the headphones for you.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I loved learning how incredibly talented Tesla was!  Unfortunately, the Robber Barons of the day took such advantage of him.  Tesla should have died a multi-millionaire rather than a relatively poor man.  However, as much as they &#34;did him wrong&#34; several times, his talent shone through.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I have watched only a handful of other TV shows because most of them are just okay. But Smash is entertaining, artful, surreal (real life in Hollywood style) and refreshing all at the same time. Really enjoy the show.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|If you like solitaire games, you will almost certainly love this one. This adds a unique twist to the old-fashioned card game.
B00AAQHP66|4.0|This movie is a true story! Well done! Not every movie can have happy ending because, its about life & life can present many challenges. The film suggests that this young man lived a full life, doing what he loved, in the time that he had.
B007JNWJMI|3.0|So I have a kindle fire HD and I bought this app. Everything was going fine but when I tried to add text it wouldn't let me save the text to the picture. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it, except I can't get out of the paddock... Overall it is really fun and you really get the feel of caring for your own horse.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Riveting.  Completely riveting from start to finish.  Even if you are not a King fan, this is a must read.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Not great but not terrible.  The plot was fairly weak but it had its fun moments.<br /><br />Glad we rented it versus paying a crap-ton at the theater (or buying)
0062255657|5.0|It's been a long time since I can't put a novel down.  Magical fantasy is not something I normally read and I'm not sure if I would have read this book if I had known the premise.  But once I got started I couldn't stop.  It's a short story, only a few hours of reading.  But definitely worth it.  Well written and entertaining.  Appropriate for any age.  I could see this made into a movie.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I watched this movie for an American History class. I wasn't too excited at first but it turned out to be the best part of the class.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I enjoyed this game so much I played it several times. Wonderful music (would love to down load the romping good tune when you're doing easy searches. Almost don't want to find the last item so I can hear more!). I enjoyed the characters and story line. Love  Nevosoft games. Especially when the characters talk so I don't have to read - old eyes. (sigh). A lot of subtle humor in this game. I also like the interaction with opening cupboards or moving plants. Great stuff! Please keep 'em coming!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This will challenge your thinking.  Meticulously researched.  I suggest you read the chapter notes as you conclude each chapter.... Fascinating.
1594203334|5.0|The author does have a sense of humor despite what her husband says.<br />Her book illustrates how bringing up children has changed since I was &#34;being brought up&#34;.<br />It would certainly be useful for all those planning to or actually bring up children.<br />Read it and see.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I own all his albums and love how they are constantly evolving from pop, to jazz blues and now even a touch of country. I like how you never know how is next album will play out. With Mayer you either like him or you don't. He's an amazing guitarist with soothing vocals.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I sort of grew out of Sci Fi but really enjoyed this.  No spoiler but it was gripping to the end.  But I loved the sardonic hero's tone.  None of the still upper lip I used to read in the old days.  As  hero, I would like to read another novel with Watney in it.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I ordered disc and watched the blue-ray disc. In the middle of the disc it stopped and lost picture and sound and became soratic for the rest of the disc.  I returned and exchanged for a new disc and it came quickly, but when I watched the new dics it also stopped in the same spot and would not move forward.  I returned it.  I think Amazon got a bad batch of discs on this movie.  Love Amazon.  They are always great they took back both discs and refunded me.
B0093QHWLC|4.0|I was surprised to see this movie only have an average rating of 3.5 stars, considering that Sean Penn and Tim Robbins give great performances. I think it's at least a 4 star movie and possibly even better!  I like it and recommend it.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Love loved it!! High action, edge-of-your-seat nail-biting suspense, smart...a total must-see!!! The special-effects, make-up and especially the sound will knock your socks off! Best zombie movie ever!
B00AC8ZJ6K|5.0|I really like this.  We will never get a Halo movie but this is SO close.  It is a little dark but still fun to watch.  Lot of kids get killed so may be appropriate to consider it a M rating or at least PG 13
B009EE7NQ2|5.0|I'm much too old to be able to connect with these kids... and yet. This is a fairy tale version of HS life and to quote the tag-line, \\"the bumps along the way.\\" Just a beautiful story. Ellen Page and Michael Cera are at their best (Ellen is *always* at her best!). The supporting cast are just perfect, too.<br /><br />I thought the music fit the movie perfectly. None of it is anything I would have been listening to naturally, yet it fit so well, I found myself drawn to it, and bought the soundtrack. I've seen arguments about whether it's right for the kids and their time, etc. Who cares? It fits the story. Reality can get its own soundtrack!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|It is an 80s action movie.  Fun to see the old guys back in action.  I wish it was a little less 'spray n pray' a lot of blood that I thought was gratuitous.  It would be more fun if it was a little less gritty and a little more precise.  That is what I like about the Halo Forward Unto Dawn and Black Hawk Down.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Get it. Watch it. Live it. Love it. :-)<br /><br />The first time I watched this movie, I just wasn't ready for it. Years later, after hearing constant references and quotes, I watched it again. It took living with the hard knocks of life for more several years to get to where I could appreciate The Dude's attitude. Good stuff.
B000SC245E|3.0|Got this for my MFC.  It worked but in all I think the replacement parts were a waste. I've since switched to an inkjet MFC and am much more happy.
0470913029|4.0|It takes some getting used to the diet, if it was just me eating, it would be a lot eaiser.<br />I know it is the healthy way to live.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|When I am waiting in line for something or for someone at an appointment, I pull it up and read. Why only 4? I would like a scroll option rather than page turning.
B006C452HO|5.0|I really enjoy this very unusual story, I love the combination of cowboys and aliens, in which I am a fan of both.
B003G4W49C|5.0|After a couple of friends recommended this to me, I decided to give it a whirl. It is smart,  fun, and interesting. Plus it was easy to pick up and read a little at a time, which is essential for a mom of a 6 month old!
B005K01VZS|5.0|This is the first book I have read by Mitch Albom.  WOW, I have been missing out.  I plan to read all of his books now.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|One of the most beautiful games I've ever played. Beat it in about 1.5 hours. Then spent another hour playing Flow, and another after that playing Flower. Just a spot-on collection.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Should be a must read for all kids entering high school!! Had all 3 of mine read it it is eye opening
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Gave me a new outlook on things. I tried the tests, and they worked. It's an improvement on The Secret. I have recommended this book to others.
B000IDEORY|5.0|I have always loved this movie.  Am so glad I now own it!!! Patrick Swayze at his best.  Love it!
B00CATSONE|4.0|I learned a lot about a man who is one of history's greatest underappreciated geniuses. The author's insights about creativity and imagination were very thought provoking. I also learned that Thomas Edison was a horrible person, not worthy of the praise and admiration he has acquired through the years. What an ass.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Have wanted this CD for some time.  When I received a gift card as a gift, this was the first thing I thought to purchase.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Very satisfying to work through this game.  I like the &#34;hint&#34; function, score keeping, etc.  Keeps me trying and engaged.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I am crazy about this movie, it was very well made, it doesn't hurt to like some of the players, I watch this over and over.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You will cry. You will laugh. You will most defiantly want Augustus Waters as your boyfriend and Hazel Grace as your best friend. It's a must read.
1594744769|5.0|This story is really a good read, it  holds you attention and you have to really have to wonder if this story is true.  I  have been wanting to read this book again  It's a fast read.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|My sixth grade grandson was required to read this for school While I think it may not be appropriate in some areas for a sixth grader, it does prompt a lot of good discussion questions about society.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|Even though the subject was weighty, it was written in a romantic fashion.  I did enjoy the read though be it very improbable.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|Much thanks the Marcus Luttrell for his bravery and the way in which he has honored his friends in writing this book. What an amazing story if friendship, honor, persistence and sacrifice. Thank you.
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|I was hesitant to read this thinking there would be a repetition of an intense cruelty and violence as in 'The Kite Runner' but even thought the human cruelty was present, in this book the focus was on the amazing intertwining of the lives of the characters. A page turner, a great writer.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read lately. I laughed, I cried, and I didn't want it to end!!! Very highly recommend!!!!
B005544V6A|4.0|An engaging and intelligent show. Characters are complex and likeable. Season 2 was even better than the first. I want to watch more and more.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters are relatable and it's a fun story line. I looked forward to each book in the series.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Loved the story line.  Really great actors.  Had a twist that none of us expected. Most definitely recommend it!  Will be watching it again.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Season 2 continues with the same as you will have come to expect from season 1! This is an awesome show and season 2 doesn't disappoint!
B00AEFY66U|5.0|I had seen it years ago when it first was shown and it is a very beautiful film based on a great story
B008U3NU38|3.0|Guess I didn't read the description close enough, or maybe I read it too closely.  I thought this was going to contain *everything* that The Clash wrote and recorded together.  Consequently, I was expecting \\"Cut the Crap\\", and even the relevant tracks from Ellen Foley's \\"Spirit of St. Louis\\" to be included, but they weren't.  Cheeseburger.
B00594M53M|3.0|If you have time and nothing to watch then watch it, but in my opinion there was something missing in the movie.<br />I have seen better French movies.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Every professional woman, actually everyone, should read this book. Very well written. This was eye opening for me and has me definitely leaning in more.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I'm surprised this book hasn't become very popular. It was a sweet well-written love story. Obviously the chapters, about life in the orphanage and with the foster family, were difficult to read. However, I truly enjoyed this book.
B008M7BQHE|5.0|My favority ....bring they back.<br />You guys need to add the final season...please.<br />They keep on air so many BAD shows...but this one was AWESOME and they stop.So wrong.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have heard and read stories of near-death experiences over the years.  My deceased father-in-law told me of one he'd had.  I like to think they are true.  This book was very detailed and discussed in length by a medical professional that experienced much more than just a fleeting glimpse of the near-death experience.
B001EYK54W|5.0|Yes, I know you can critic this film to bits. It's dated,very apparent flaws, the way it's filmed - split screen, graphics that interrupt,the plot is implausible;but it is still the work of two of the undeniable best actors of all time. Full, round characters that do not fail to give juicy color to the script. The look, the smile, the quiet pause. The new one is good, but for my money it's McQueen, and Dunaway.  Enjoy
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've loved every book Colleen Hoover has written. I'm upset it took me this long to read it.<br />I don't want to give too much away...<br />This is a story, that happens way too much in today's real world than it should. Female character is Sky. She is your typical 17 year old girl, but then again she's not. She has been homeschooled since she was adopted at age 5. Her mother doesn't believe in technology. Therefore Sky has grown up without TV or cell phones. She has convinced her mother to let her go to public school for her senior year. Before she even starts school, she has a reputation.<br />Male character is Holder (Dean). He was sent to live with his father in Austin after beating some guy senseless at his school. So after living with his father for a year, he comes back to live with his mother and meets Sky at the grocery store. Except he calls her Hope. He had no intention of going back to school to finish his senior year, until he meets Sky. They start dating. And then Sky's world falls apart.<br /><br />I urge you, if you do decide to read this, have tissues, chocolate and a glass of wine (or bottle), take the day off from work. Becuase once you start reading, you will not be able to put it down.<br /><br />Be sure to read Losing Hope after you read this. It's from Holder's POV and it's amazing!<br /><br />Happy Reading ;)
B0064Z62R0|5.0|Great collection of Hawaiian music! Up to par with the amazing quality of the movie and novels themselves. Features a collection of different styles that add to one another and combine for a great experience. Great driving music!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire game is really fun to play! You can play it without really thinking about it too much. It's great to pass the time with while waiting for appointments, etc.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Even in the middle of reading this book I started recommending it to any one who would listen. Well written, funny and touching all at the same time.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoyed season 1, and season 2 has not disappointed.  Got my wife watching, and she is totally hooked.  Have not missed an episode of season 3.  Liked watching on Amazon, because we could binge on watching episodes on the weekends.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was not sure if I wanted to read this being about cancer.  These are young people facing big decisions big problems in there life.  The warm and caring made this book a joy to read.  You will cry, laugh and feel great about the human kindness you see.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Terrific writing and acting.  Never watched it as a regular series on TV, but was intrigued by the ratings that Suits received on Amazon.  It was enough to get me started, and I have not stopped watching.
B000B8QF14|5.0|Bullet In A Bible takes you behind the scenes and shows a little of the great production that goes into the fantastic live Green Day performance.  A must have for every Green Day fan!
0307476073|5.0|I could not put this book down. I hardly have the time or inclination to read much these days: I am a busy mom of three home-schooled kids, I am pursuing a masters of law online, and I have cows, chickens and 6 acres- I am busy. Yet, I found myself sneaking off mid-day to read Wild. I stayed up until 3 am reading this book on more than one occasion! I had dreams about Cheryl's adventures...I lived her adventure.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Very smart, affords great protection to the tablet and it fits the Kindle Fire perfectly.<br />A must for anybody that wants the protection without the weight and very affordable.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Unlike other similar games, Wonder Zoo let's you do things...a lot. I enjoy catching and later releasing animals, hunting through different scenarios...from desert over jungle to river scenery (Have not unlocked all areas yet). I can put some animals in storage, in case I want to catch, breed and then release a different type first, in case there in no more space for their habitat.<br />I love the graphics in the different wildlife scenes: the beaver swimming and diving to escape the hunter; birds flying away; animals running away in the mountain area (which I unlocked a while ago), etc.<br />This certainly brings out the inner child in me. Not that this is difficult to do. The graphics are made for younger players, but that does not take away their charm.<br />I definitely have a lot of fun playing this game and will be doing it until I have run out of wilderness scenarios to explore or I get bored. When will that happen? Not any time soon. And did I mention there is also a space ship for catching animals from the dinosaur era? They will be beamed up. Ha...so much fun!
B003F1WM2K|5.0|I just loved this book. I will read it again as I do for all my favorite books. I have loved her since the Seventies.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|It tracks activity well, but other measurements are not so accurate.  The pulse measurement can be wildly off -- 125 upon awakening, when their own blood pressure cuff says 56!  Sleep tracking is iffy because it doesn't always record trips to the bathroom as awake time, and if you lie still, it will think you are asleep.  But worst is the customer service -- or lack thereof.  I have sent three messages to them through the website, and none of my queries have been answered after several weeks.
B003IDMURM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the mixture of the tales of different lives, and the twists and turns of those lives from a community
B000I8ERVC|5.0|This movie brought back memories of that time period. It was fun watching most of it! Until Jack Nicholson died.. But still it tells of an era in America - People that look different are not tolerated.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|Deleted it. Can't remember why but Swype was better.  The was it suggested words was annoying. It tries to think for you and I'm smarter than it thinks ;)
B005GFPZYK|2.0|It portrays our military servicemen in a poor light.  The seals are portrayed as elitists who feel that all other military members are subservient to them which is obviously inaccurate.  It is too bad that the author didn't put more thought into what he is saying.  Many young people will be negatively influenced by the book and will get a biased opinion of the Navy Seals.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book outlines in simple language how to alter one's life is clear steps to achieve peace and spirituality.  We read it out loud in a small group setting and all were moved by the readings and the experience.
140006922X|4.0|I enjoy history, so found the book interesting.  Seems like the more things change the more they stay the same.  Have we really progressed far from the violence and tribal hatred that existed two thousand plus years ago?  It seems  we've only developed bigger and more deadly weapons to attack each other with.
B001DJ7PR8|5.0|It's great the story line was pretty exciting. I love Scarlett johansen.<br />I'm glad I ordered it. Thank you for having it in stock..
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie is long. But worth it. Twisting and turning, intertwining lives throughout time. It's an awesome movie that keeps on giving!
B0040I09RM|4.0|The Shield may be lamentably gone from TV, but prominent alumnus Kurt Sutter seems to have taken it upon himself to carry on its legacy with Sons of Anarchy, and if the show's first season is any indication he's more than up to the task. Anyone who enjoyed The Shield's combination of intelligence and testosterone will certainly find a lot to like here, as SoA quickly established itself as among TV's most unique and consistently compelling shows and only got better from there.
B00DULWFZE|5.0|Jamming all day, every day! Backstreet boys are forever in my heart! I'm so glad they are all back together again
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was gravely disappointed in this book! Many have said you have got to read this, it's so alluring and exotic! Phhhh please, I've read books in the past that were more intriguing for a woman to enjoy and put in her fantasy mind! Is not the worst ever written but its just not believable enough even as a fiction written book! A business tycoon as the character is would live in his own home not an apartment in Seattle! Wearing flannel pants that re supposed to be business suit like slacks, HELLO! And sneakers are converse shoes LOL a virgin 21 yr old who so inexperienced at many things suddenly can orgasm every other page it seems, come on! It's very misleading to younger women who will read this book! If a British writer is going to write a book in an American scenario, make it more believable! It's sure is not all its cracked up to be.... Very disappointed 40 something woman!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I played it and all u do is build. It really sucks because it costs a BUTTLOAD of money. Man did I really  pay that much money for nothing.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|Amazing album! I love the themes in the songs and their meanings. They don't ever disappoint their living fans. Definitely worth purchasing
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The storyline was great.  The ending was a surprise.  Ruffallo is good.  I recommend this movie.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|I am a big fan of this movie because it takes place right near the town where I grew up.  I even own the game and enjoy playing that as well.  Have not watched it yet, but plan on watching it this weekend.  I am certain I will be very pleased.
0812550706|4.0|I was inspired to read this book by the number of positive reviews obtained by this book.  I found it to be original and very entertaining, I read it in only a couple of days.  I am over seventy and know it will connect better with young people who are closer to the ages of the main characters.  I have now started to read the next in the series, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\" and am hopeful that I will enjoy it just as much.
B00B9366VO|5.0|This was a wonderful documentary by Dave Grohl.  It was an enjoyable look into the music world over the past 30 years with lots of wonderful interviews along with interesting history.  Anyone who is a music fan (casual or serious) will get something from this film.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wonderful show!  Though I don't love the sad parts, I appreciate the interesting storyline and great acting.  Keep them coming!
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I have to admit I was a little hesitant to read the book from the title alone, but I have to say that I absolutely loved it. The poetry was beautiful and tasteful, something I found refreshing and imaginative. The author really has a way with words. He easily paints a picture for the reader with his rich vocabulary. I would recommend this work to any adult interested in reading some very expressive and creative poetry.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|All those great episodes you watched as a kid are back, but improved! The HD versions are crisper and clearer, with great sound and re-touched special effects. The images of the Enterprise in the &#34;whoosh-by&#34; sequences and the planet orbit scenes are totally new and so much better than the original art department shots. There are some oddities, as in one scene with a sister ship, the sister ship's designation is a rather slap-dash NCC-1017 (or there abouts) - semi-mirror of the Enterprise's NCC-1701 designation. Some of the special effects are so good they are a bit distracting for this long-time Trek fan- Hey, look at that! That's improved! New folks to the Old Trek may not notice these items, but everyone is going to notice the 3/4 aspect ratio dub onto a 16:9 display- not much can be done to fix that, however. The acting is always fun to watch, and that, coupled with the freshened special effects should keep people entertained for decades to come.
B002PEP4EG|5.0|amazing, it comes on the time and look very nice and no scratch. i really love it so much and I will get more
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|I bought this for a game for small group time in children's ministry. The kids lived using a game that they live playing and relating it to Gods Word.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|i fell in love with it and it is just like the play. excellent. thanks so much. I am enjoying every minute of it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a smart and entertaining series. So hard to find in the glom of reality shows on TV today.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've watched so many consecutive shows that I'm beginning to think with a british accent!<br />One more season and it's bound to come out in my day to day conversation.<br />Mr. Carson is my favorite.  Would love to have a &#34;spot of tea&#34; with him and chat (with my british accent, of course).
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love Tubemate! I can't remember how I got by without it before! Definitely a lifetime product for me and my family!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It is a tool girl, but very important for the house, when the knife edge no more, this tool is the solution, and no space
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun lots to do. Quite an adventure. Never a dull moment except when you run out of energy. Love when they let you hunt!
B0091REZMW|5.0|If you enjoy 'I Spy' or 'Where is Waldo' you will definitely enjoy this game! It is exactly what I expected and more!
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|I made a mistake by continuing to watch this movie. When I picked out the 7 of diamonds at the beginning of the movie from the card trick, I should have known then this movie was weak. The movie starts in a way with each actor playing their usual characters in other movies, with mediocre acting at best. And then the characters never really grow on you. The story line is a stretch and the ending is make-believe. The movie peaked my interest in the beginning because the story line had great potential but sputtered to nowhere. The actors had no emotion, the magic was not explained but it was performed like it wasn't a movie about magic, and the villain turned out to be practical. They try hard to make the movie suspenseful and dramatic with the magician's music playing in the background but it just gets annoying. Amy Adams is not the leading lady Hollywood wants her to be and Morgan Freeman's character didn't even make sense in the movie. This was a ridiculous attempt at doing something different. I want my hour and 45 minutes back.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Seriously if you need a headset just buy this its honestly incredible, the buttons are SUPER easy to program and the 7.1 surround sound is INSANE. For real though i had this headset for about a month or two without the surround sound then i finally got around to downloading it and its so worth it. all in all i will always buy logitech!
B008YRVW0I|4.0|This game is alright. I really get great pleasure in building my own fish tank.<br />I want to buy this right now.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|You should play this. Parents some kids don't have games in there life. This is a game you should let your kids play. My mom downloaded this on her iPod and her kindle fire. Parents reacomend. let your children/child play.This is a 5 year old game through adult. Please let your children play. If your child doesn't learn in school that means if you let them play they will learn in school. I am over 13
0670021652|5.0|I can sympathize with not wanting to get married again; to be told you 'have to' in order to keep your relationship (in this country) would put the fur up on my back, too. And then, in Ms Gilbert's authentic style, one sees how relationships of all kinds grow only when nourished and cannot be contained or explained any easier than the human experience is. Each person is unique, so it follows each relationship will be, too. This book comes from a place of love, tempered by truth, mellowed by her own soul-search into fear and being defined. Another great read by Liz Gilbert!
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Nothing more  or less. First of all thanks to my friend Farhan Ahmed who told me to read this book. And then to the Amazon Kindle Team
B00026WU82|5.0|Had to buy this to replace the one I lost in Mexico in a bad car stereo. Obviously one of Bob's best.
B00COCY67A|5.0|I love this collection.  The outtakes, the jokes the behind the scenes Elvis is fabulous. The  70's songs are my favorite.
B000002LJW|5.0|This purchase was simply to replace the original that I wore out. Great album, great songs, great band. One of EC's very best.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Not inception but this Movie is definitely worth watching. The end is not as shocking as it should be but again it suprises you. A definitely must watch.
B000G73UEU|4.0|On this soundtrack you'll find cover versions of many of Leonard Cohen's best songs. Well-known artists such as Rufus and Martha Wainwright, Jarvis Cocker, Nick Cave, Teddy Thompson are among the contributors, and several of the songs are given interesting new interpretations. However, apart from Teddy Thompson's great version of the relatively obscure song \\"Tonight Will Be Fine,\\"  I think none really surpass Cohen's originals.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Very well done!! Would be a 5 if there was online multiplayer. Love the fact that you can create and edit your own decks. Graphics are great. Runs smooth on Kindle Fire HD.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I was looking for something plain and easy to read or my long nights nursing my baby, this is a good book to pass some time being entertained. Nothing mysterious in the story so it's quite fast to read.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The Outlander series continues to amaze and enthrall me with this third book in the lineup. While they have all led me on an incredible emotional journey, Voyager really has some nail biting and rapturous moments. Without giving too much away, if you have enjoyed the series so far then you will be thrilled with this one. The adventure continues with lots of action and suspense. I am eager to start the next book....Drums of Autumn!
B00EQNYOYU|4.0|Not old school NIN, but still well done.  It's a NIN album for old NIN fans.  But drug addicted Trent is better than a sober Trent.  Sorry.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Stunning look at the role that the big investment banks played in the financial crisis.  Lewis is very good at making nonfiction read as easily as a good novel. Warning: this book might seriously p1$$ you off.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This game is actually great but I've had nightmare problems with it. Posted on android and it reset about 5 times and I lost my hp, stark credits and some nice armour. So I'm here on kindle version and its not the latest version of the game that last played on android 2 weeks ago. What gives?
B008XG1X18|2.0|this app recently started force closing when I try to pin something :( every single time. I cleared all the data, that didn't work so I reinstalled it. still not working. why??!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think that this is a nice game. You really have to use your mind and try to piece every thing together.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|PERSPECTIVE<br />OK, here we have what Star Trek fans hope for.... a continuation of Star Trek.<br />From a production stance, this effort is mindlessly easy since the entire scenario is not only previously created but there really is no restriction upon imagination.<br />All that was required is the key to unlocking a means or method to re-create the saga using the same characters in ANY story line.<br />That key was in the first new Star Trek movie where a new Timeline was introduced.<br />ALL previous characters, both hero and villain can be utilized with total poetic license.<br />POOF!, no limits on creativity and a huge pre-existing fan base.<br /><br />Are the new Star Trek movies \\"good\\"????<br />That question is purely based upon opinion and useless and invalid in terms of quality product.<br /><br />Let's talk quality product instead of opinion.<br /><br />There IS a serious quality problem in both the new Star Trek movies that renders them annoying at the very absolute least.<br />Unless you are morbidly blind and somehow mesmerized into a hypnotic trance that cannot observe reality, then you know what this technical problem is.<br />Lens Flares.<br />Question is.... did you notice that lens flares are being Artificially Generated in the CGI scenes?<br />PLEASE!!!!.... explain why.<br /><br />Reality check....<br />Do YOU go through your life observing lens flares occurring in your sight picture in reality????<br />If so, you have either cataracts or nyctalopia.<br /><br />Look closely at the end credits and witness for yourself, artificial lens flares using the exact same pattern AND including a water spotted lens effect.<br /><br />WHO in their right mind would go to the trouble of creating artificial effects that do not represent or suggest that you are observing a real image or scene?<br />Feel the need to argue?.... watch ALL the other Start Trek movies and Series and count ALL lens flares COMBINED.<br />The number of lens flares will not even come close to the number of lens flares in either one of these new Star Trek movies individually.<br />This is VERY POOR QUALITY since every other movie or TV show you watch goes to great technical lengths to eliminate those ANNOYING LENS FLARES.<br /><br />Evidently....<br />J.J. Abrams has lost his mind and has been viewing reality through a camera lens for so long that he has brain washed himself into believing that all of reality is one big lens flare after another after another after another after another after another after another after another after another after another... and so brain washed that he has added lens flares to computer generated scenes because he thinks this adds a touch of reality.<br /><br />So,.... do you like the movies?<br />Who cares what your opinion is?<br />Is this a Quality Product?.... absolutely not regardless of an opinion.<br /><br />Before you engage in a losing argument that will ultimately ask what you see with your own eyes in reality rather than through an optical lens..... go back and watch the movie again and this time, OBSERVE the lens flares instead of a camera close-up that chops off the top of an actor's head due to a wacky 2.4:1 aspect ratio.<br />Do this and you will agree that the production is not a quality product.<br /><br />The lens flares have to go.
B002S45V32|5.0|It was a Saturday afternoon -- and what other to do than watch the classic Pretty in Pink. Watch it!
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Considering its aimed at teens and I am an adult, I am enjoying the book. Wanted to read it before the movie came out.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|It's Star Trek so of course I love the Star Trek movies and still watch the re-runs. Action packed and good actors.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|The movie was good, but not what all the hype led it up to be. I enjoyed watching it, but expected a bit more out of it.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|it is very compatible with the first kindle fire and the game is well made.. aside from the controls to look aroun walk and shoot its a very good game. I feel that minor things like d/c should lower the quality of this game since offline missions are still very fun
B002Y0MQ6A|3.0|It's could have been a lot better the ending sucks<br />U should<br />Not<br />Watch<br />It<br />World<br />War<br />Z<br />Is<br />Way<br />Better
B005PK553C|5.0|While I am not a fan of horror stories, I was able to get through the entire season. Fantastic story! Jessica Lange is marvelously creepy. Connie Britton is fantastic.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is awesome it is sad and funny. I loved wonder it was absolutely incredible  book I believe that everyone should read this book.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Recently read this book for our book club meeting.  Sister Fliss and Lottie find themselves in opposition when Lottie unexpectedly reconnects with an old flame.  Fliss regards the hurry up engagement, and vows another of her sister's poor decisions.  Fliss matches up with Lorcan, a  friend/business partner of the groom.  Together they set out to throw a kink in the plans for the honeymoon. Who would imagine so many troubles would befall a honeymooning couple in a world of hotel luxury? In the end, a stage is set for a part two.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Great cast and good story line. Worth an evening. Might be nice to have a bottle of wine with you.
0307352153|5.0|Ms. Cain has written a thoroughly engrossing book that personally helped me understand behaviors I have had my entire life and wasn't every sure they were normal or not; the need to get away from people and recharge after large gatherings, my distaste for team building activities, being passionate about chasing knowledge, etc.  I encourage anyone with an introverted child to read this book so you can help champion and shape a happy life for them.
B00030DEQE|1.0|Like many others I bought this because it was a well known brand name. Well, it was almost impossible to get working with Windows 7, but after fooling with it for the better part of a day, it somehow started working, I don't know how. But after less than 2 months, it has quit working and my computer does not even register that it is there. As for drivers, there are  none available. Website says \\"in box\\" which means they had to come from the computer maker pre-installed. POS as far as I'm concerned.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Another update, another failure to take care of the problem of the news feed properly sorting the most recent posts.  They still are showing up with older posts above newer posts, regardless of the fact that I have &quot;most recent&quot; selected in my news feed options.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is the funnest game I have played.  It even beats Angry Birds for me!!  The only problem is that it had to end.  I am ready for the next phase!!!  Hurry Yippee!! ;-)
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and I liked it more than the first. While it had its serious parts I enjoyed Bones and Scot's comedic relief.
B003VWU2WA|1.0|Won't work with it, Griffin has made not effort to update their driver and have announced they have not plans to.
B000MQPKVG|5.0|If you've got an afternoon to spare, and you're a Kubrick fan, then it doesn't get any better. This was shot using only period lighting, so candlelight for any night scenes. Just awesome. Pair it with The Duellists for a nice Napoleonic double feature.
B00F6N4GGK|5.0|As I began to read this book of short stories, my mind immediately thought of my ten year old son. This delightful book is ideal for young children who love anything silly. Just as the title suggests this collection of stories is amusing and adults you have to suspend your seriousness to enter.<br />My son laughed aloud at the exploits of Billy and Bob as they weave their crazy way through life. Share in the antics of this strange duo as they travel to strange places and take on the world. Don't take anything you read seriously and you are guaranteed a good laugh.
0446699616|5.0|I loved this book. I bought a copy for my husband and daughter. Great novel and I love the main character's sense of humor.
B00BQ1D7BQ|1.0|I'm a fan of Kenny Wayne Shepherd and have seen him live twice. As much as I like him as a guitarist, I always thought he was a dismal singer and the fact that he sings frequently on this album really ruined it for me. Moreover, it's more of the standard, same old same old. Nothing impressive at all. None of the songs stand out and I hear little to no musical evolution since Ledbetter Heights. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|This is the classic Arthurian legends with a twist.  It is told by the female characters with a pagan perspective.  A must read!
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Anything daft punk is amazing. this is super fun to dance and move to. I love everything about this song
B008JGSM6G|4.0|started out easy and I thought it was going to be dumb.  But then I got really competitive with my self with it started getting harder!  very addictive!
B008HK3XOU|3.0|I think it will be very useful as I get to know my Kindle. If you are going to contimue to tell me what to say and write, then I want you to remove me from your e-mail screeds. (how are those additional 8 words!!HUH
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Got hooked on Sons when it started and still like the show very much.<br />  Especially Jax and Gemma. But in all fairness the entire cast is great!!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Wonderful music for a vacation near the beach or just sitting  back and relaxing to..  I loved the movie so i knew this would be an awesome purchase.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I played this game and it's awesome. I would surely recommend this game to all my friends and be sure that they play it
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Are you kidding me?  This is worth the $4.99 and is infinitely better than the free version.  The world's radio stations in the palm of your hand without having to go through your browser.  Out of 100 stations I tried, only one didn't stream -- and I blame the station.<br /><br />Miss an episode of World Cafe?  Find a podcast in a fraction of a second and listen - or record and listen later.  I can listen to the same stations as my on-line pals in Glasgow, Kansas City and Sydney.  I can listen to Radio Habana Cuba.  Bravo!
B005544TRQ|4.0|My husband loves &#34;Suits&#34; and I thought it to be quite entertaining.  I enjoyed watching the female character's outfits - some were pretty classy and others were great but not for the office!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think this game is very fun and addictive. I honestly don't have any problem game. It has great graphics and anyone can play.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|What a great addition to my Kindle.  I was able to see and hear a big difference in the quality of sound, and the ability to change the settings to suite my desires.  I would recommend this app for all Kindle users that want to greatly improve their sound experience. Kudos!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This is a good action movie, doesn't try to make anything too complicated. Its a good movie to relax and watch.
B004SUDPWI|5.0|Good quality blu-ray transfer.  Looks and sound great.  Excellent movie with superb acting and script.  Great performance by Alec Guiness. Would recommend this movie.
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|long time no see this good movies, it will scare you I am sure. For years I haven't see movies like this scary.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Very practical and available for anything you want at the spare of the moment. From fashion, to garden, art, make up, hair, food and much, much more! I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Once downloaded, i could never get it to open up. It looked like it might be fun....but, i never got a chance to play. I just uninstalled the app.
0345529057|5.0|These are great books in perfect condition and in a nice box set. I am looking forward to reading all of them.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The entire trilogy was great reading. I thoroughly enjoyed all of them. I only wish there were more to read.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|David Grohl takes you on a ride through music history with an end of redemption. The list of rock stars involved with this project is awesome.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This books has you thinking where you are going in your life.<br /><br />  Shows you how to get back on track to finding happiness.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is a must buy u guys are lucky it isnt 10 bucks this game is a practically a steal! It's like black ops 2 on kindle trust its worth the money
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|First time game player,,, screen prompts person what to do until the game is set,, good feature.... Not sure where the game will end or how long it takes,, but it is entertaining for me.
B003477DVK|5.0|very entertaining<br />why insist on waiting my time with this crap that is why I never give a review or feedback
B00ARF92HK|3.0|Not one of your better movies. Just shoot a run. Too many movies are coming out like this. Not a good story line.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME IS BANANAS!!<br />It's awesomely Cray !! I love the minions and the graphics are great !! Download it you are gonna love it!!
1419705644|5.0|I really liked the explanations given of the characters and their easy to understand and comes on top is beautiful
B004NELBPC|3.0|I really enjoyed this app on my Kindle Fire HD until it was recently tweaked. That iconic \\"daisy\\" is no longer a help in finding an article and/or seeing them in appropriate groupings. If you tap \\"ALL TOPICS,\\" you get \\"HEALTHCARE\\" instead -- in fact, none of the petals work as they did before the app was improved and many simply do not work. Bah, hiss.<br /><br />10/31/13: HUGE APOLOGIES! Anyone familiar with the newspaper apps available for Kindle, etc., surely noticed that I gleefully (and inaccurately) trashed HuffPost when my criticism clearly was of the tweaking of NBC's app, not Huffington Post. There is no daisy on HuffPost. Mea maxima culpa.
B001AZI1W8|5.0|The package came quick. It was nicely packaged. Music was amazing!! It allowed me to travel back in time if only for an hour. Great concert. #RihannaNavy #Chrianna
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Well done, quite funny...good, light entertainment. Brooklyn Decker (a comic revelation! she has improved amazingly) and Elizabeth banks (sooo good) are awesome...well directed and written...nice ensemble cast (except for morrison and Lopez). &#34;Dad&#34; group is funny, and love mangianello in his small part.
B00BY8DIT2|5.0|Awesome music, could not be happier. Everything about this is great. Shipping was on time and price was fair. Everyone needs this CD.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Groundhog Day is more comic than romantic, like most romcoms. This makes my current list of the top 10 romcoms. The fantasy premise of the film leads to some very funny bits, which are realized very well. The themes are human. Murray's acting has already been praised, but I'll give him one more vote.<br /><br />The repetitive shot of the alarm clock, used as a backbone for plot, was slightly tiresome, but I understand the film makers' expedient.  The exuberant variety of what amounts to a collection of skits made up for this minor defect. Perhaps they didn't realize just how good the film was?!<br /><br />I recommend this film highly!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|What can I say ? Sabbath is back. I am so glad I pre-ordered this CD as it fits right in with all the early Sabbath material I have in my collection. Like metal , buy it !
B009WO7NQO|5.0|If you like Angry Birds and LOVE Star Wars like I do you will have a hard time putting this down.  May the force be with you!!!
B00CL0J99K|4.0|I thought the individual Marvel films might seem insignificant after The Avengers. That's not the case. The big moments are still there. The giant action sequences are still there. More importantly Robert Downey Jr. is still there. Tony Stark says he is Iron Man, but I think we just see Downey Jr. strutting his stuff, and I'm OK with that. Downey Jr. fits Iron Man like a glove ... that blows things up.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|this movie kept me on the edge of my seat all the way througth non stop action definetlly one i would say is a must see i watched it 4 times and i am looking foward to watching it again soon johnny t lafayette la.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This is a fine game, except there is an ad between every hand.  It takes at least two strokes to get rid of.  It was so annoying that I deleted the app.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Random Acces Memories. Many words can describe it but wow. This album is no doubt the best album of the year. Daft Punk known for creating a new and amazing type of music delivers and a improvement. Back in 1996 or 1997 Daft Punk's first Studio album Homework came out and people were like, Wow, this music is amazing. Then in 2001 Daft Punks Discovery delivered amazement of the future and past, becoming one of the most famous albums of all time. In 2005 Daft Punk delivered their 3rd studio album Human After All which was quite odd but very amazing. 8 years later they finally come out with there 4th studio album, Random Access Memories. When I first saw this album I was like,\\"Daft Punk is back?\\" And I got excited. I knew I had to buy this album. I heard about it on iTunes. The first song of theres on the album was \\"Get Lucky.\\" Instantly it became my favorite song and seems to probably be my favorite for another 3 or 4 years or even MORE! Unless Daft Punk came out with another amazing song. Get Lucky made me feel good and made me want to love music more than I already did. The album cover for this was probably the coolest album cover of all time. I mean, who doesn't like the robots helmets? The album for me was a little disappointing but incredibly not disappointing! I was a little dissapointed because it wasn't like them BUT there no music is absolutely amazing. There new music is a improvement and is overall the greatest music I have ever heard. Daft Punk is my favorite artist and it WILL stay that way forever. The music has a tune that is unique and absolutely beautiful. It makes you feel so good. So here is the reviews on all the songs.<br /><br />Give Life Back To Music - The song is about how Daft Punk wants to bring back the music of the past and the music of the future. There not liking this society of Pop music and they want to change it up a big. Nile Rodgers is truly an amazing guitarist and makes the song feel groovy and nice. The old Daft Punk voice is init and makes the song sound just like a robot and a unique singer. (10/10)<br /><br />The Game of Love - The Game of Love is a nice peaceful song which reminds old Daft punk fans of Digital Love. Just more love. (9/10)<br /><br />Giorgio Moroder - A very odd song because the song is just talking and really cool background music but hey, the guy has a awesome ascent! (9/10)<br /><br />Within - Nice robot singing Daft Punk, nice singing. A nice and relaxing song. All though I do miss there rock and roll style. (9/10)<br /><br />Instant Crush - An amazing song. I love it. I love the background music and the lyrics. Plus Daft Punk's Robot talk. Very nice! (10/10)<br /><br />Lose Yourself to Dance - My 2nd favorite song in the album and one of my favorite songs! Lose yourself to dance is so catchy. The lyrics are a little random but Pharrell is a good singer and thats a good reason why the song rocks. An amazing song and a must buy! Sounds like the 70s! (10/10)<br /><br />Touch - Touch was probably the hardest song of all to make. It has a lot of recordings in it and is a nice song! Great and classical! (10/10)<br /><br />Get Lucky - Words can not explain this song but I will try, This song is my favorite song of all time and will stay that way for a long time. I've never liked a song this much before and thats amazing. This one inspired me to make and love music more than I already do! Incredible! Fantastic! Best song ever to exists! Yes! This isn't no ordinary pop song! This is real music. If I had to listen to any song for the rest of my life I would listen to this. Daft Punk has created a song that makes people feel amazing. It gives life to all people. This song is just not about, \\"Getting Lucky,\\" Its about lliving life like we should. Nile Rodger ahs a epic Eletric Guitar solo at the end, a awesome bass line, nice piano music, and great drumming! And Phareel sings like no tommorrow. Incredible! Amazing! The Best Song Of Our Time! Bring back the future and bring back the past! WOW! (10/10)<br /><br />Beyond - A nice song. Really wants you to go Beyond! (10/10)<br /><br />Motherboard - A pretty good song. No singing but its got a nice tune. Sounds like something that would me in a movie soundtrack though. (9/10)<br /><br />Fragments of Time - Todd Edwards sings great in the song. I like this song its catchy and very classical. Awesome! (10/10)<br /><br />Doin' It Right - Really catchy. Panda Bear is a awesome singer. I love this song! My 3rd or 4th favorite osng on this album! It deserves to be in the top somewhere on the itunes chart!<br /><br />Contact - A very interesting song but weird. Well it's Daft Punk what do you excpect? (9/10)<br /><br />So yeah. Those are my opinions on all the songs. There is no doubt Random Access Memories deserves the best album of the year but it's also one of the greatest albums ever made. Daft Punl's are the gods of music. They are incredibly popular now and they are uique and that's all that matters. Nice job Daft Punk. You did well. Incredibly well.<br /><br />Random Acces Memories (10/10)
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Loved the script which followed the original story, but was updated for out time. Characters follow our beloved Star Trek family. Love the romance between Ohara and Spock. They should definitely give that more play time for us gals
0790729342|5.0|One of the fun cult-classic films of my youth. I remembered renting this one on VHS. Hell, we even had to rent a VHS player back in the day before we all owned one. My friends would get together at our house and rent the machine, this &#34;tape&#34; and a few other cult films. We'd drink beer and laugh and watch the Aussie apocalyptic tale of struggle to beat the odds against a stronger foe. Great villain lines  which we all still use in our vocabulary, &#34;.... you puppy!&#34;<br />If you don't have this one in your collection, buy it. If only for some ideas for how to drive better, faster and without fear. lol
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I am enjoying the convenience of a paperless book,and the cost of the books,easy to down load and pay for
B00008G7UF|5.0|I love this movie. It's adorable. I love the setting and scenery and I love Meg Ryan and Kevin Kline in these characters.  I love ending.  Great movie.
B003INBOE2|5.0|I Like the move<br />this one is in english<br />i dont have to read sub title<br />one of the best move
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|This movie takes a lot of twist and turns, you have to watch closely to figure it out. I really liked it.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|The Fountainhead<br />My Dad love this move -- it came ontime and as directed<br />I took it to his house and watch it with him
B005DZ35RC|3.0|I bought this for my 4 yr old granddaughter, but it didn't seem to keep her attention.  The movie is kind of boring for her age.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|i looked at calculater apps and they are all crap but this one us actually good and this calculater app doesnt lag nor is it a piece of crap like that others
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Goes on and on. Tear out every other page and you won't miss much. I even learned later that the friend who recommended it never got past page 70.
0786956291|5.0|Let's face it. The only way people can get into D&D is by knowing other people who are already into D&D. It's pretty impossible for someone to just become interested and begin playing - Until now. This red box is great for people who are just starting out. It walks new players through the process of creating characters and playing a small adventure, and even taking on the role of dungeon master. I've gone through it a couple of times and had a lot of fun. I even got my wife to try it out. Now we are planning on getting together with a small group of our friends to play. This is simple to use and it's fun. Even though an adult might actually be able to have more fun with it, I reccomend getting this for kids (not too young) to enhance their creativity, develop team work and problem solving skills and become better readers. Unless you have stupid kids. Stupid kids who don't have imaginations won't like D&D. If you have stupid kids just stick with cable tv and hope for the best.
B005544V6A|5.0|The best show I have seen since Breaking Bad... Waitttt. No but for real I like a lot of shows and I have seen a lot in my life, but this is so entertaining because it mixes a serious profession with suspense, humor, love and relationships, and of course interesting/even slightly educational cases.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome and I even have the xbox version!you should get it if your new to it,you get creative where you can make anything with all the blocks,and you can fly.on survival you have hearts and there are mobs like cows,chickens,pigs,and,sheep.on survival you also have to get the materials for weapons like a sword,this game was made for creativity,fun,and awsomeness!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|The storyline was good, it was very enjoyable to watch! The characters were well played and the special effects were good. not all supernatural movies can pull it off but this one did! . :)
B009WO7NQO|4.0|when I got the new update yesterday,it had this moon thing now,there's a another update today and it deleted the world! this is the only problem I'm having.other than that its a fun game :)
B001DUDKEY|5.0|The characters are charming and deviant with a real human quality to them. I can watch this movie over and over again!! :)
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I am still reading this fascinating book.  It is one of those that are too good to hurry through.  The author presents a view of the world that Jesus allegedly lived in, its culture and its mores.  I am not offended if another view than the Biblical one is offered, although I know that could be the case if one took a literal view of the Bible.  I'll continue reading and amend this semi-review when I've finished.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Excellent. I would recommend this to everyone. I can't stop watching. I will hate for this series to end. Best show ever
B00D4PDJMY|5.0|Any Phil fan will love this album. Brutal, raw, real, heavy with unmistakable Phil's vocals. Like fine wine he gets better with age. you can hear the years of smoking and drinking but that's the magic of this visceral masterpiece that will pierce your core. every track kicks ass. A must have album to be enjoyed<br />on full blast \m/
B0089XH38M|1.0|Started to set it up on my Nexus and it said something about charges so I deleted the program.<br />I did not even get to try it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|A compelling & believable story well written.  I liked the way it flowed back and forth in time frames so easily.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This app is SUPER fun please download!!!!!!! :) :) :) only costs like 1.99 for full version. Still is totally fun with the free versoin

B00A17C316|5.0|If you don't have this one, let me say the price is right, the voice is magnificent and the music is great.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|It really piss me that an author starts a saga with a wonderful, interesting, and entertaining book and ends up not knowing what to do with his story. This book has no sense, comes and goes and I never understood what was the main theme. It really sucks, and I really disappointed with G.R. Martin.
1451695195|5.0|PROOF OF HEAVEN is a very well written book. One must suspect that editor Ptolemy Tompkins played a strong role in the structure and writing of this book. I say that because one would not expect a neurologist to have the skills to write a breezy, colorful account of his near death experience. An account that is a joy to read. Whatever, this book is another addition to the growing list of books in which authors describe the memories of what they experienced during a state of unconsciousness. In this author's case, that state lasted for roughly six days. The cause was a serious case of E. coli meningitis, and the patient nearly died. The author goes to great lengths of effort to establish that the story of his illness and his recovery is absolutely true. And, I for one, think he told it the way it really happened.<br /><br />What we learn is that our author had a long history of participating in the medical profession, and, for virtually his entire medical career, had been associated with very prestigious institutions of medicine, including Harvard Medical School. He is also author, or co-author, of many articles pertaining to the field of neurology.<br /><br />In the early pages of  his book, he begins to describe in words (his best efforts) what he remembers of the experiences he had during a time that his outer brain layers were totally inactive. I won't try to use medical terms for this occurrence.  His experiences were not an exact parallel to those of others who have also told of near death experiences. But, perhaps that makes his account all the more interesting. His story, and the many similar accounts, show that a world exists that is on a higher level than the dream world we experience as we sleep, or the world of daydreams, that we all occasionally enter, when we are awake. It is a world that is in many ways \\"very real.\\"<br /><br />Now clearly, the author believed that, during this short time of six days, several times he entered heaven and indeed was in the presence of God (Om),<br /><br />His quotes, \\"The (false) suspicion that we can somehow be separated from God is the root of every form of anxiety in the Universe, and the cure for it - which I received partially within the Gateway and completely within the core - was the knowledge that nothing can tear us from God, ....\\" (Chapter 14) and, \\"I did not just believe in God: I knew God\\" (Chapter 32) shows us that he believed that he had indeed had a meeting with God Himself. So, we perhaps tend to say to ourselves, \\"If his experience was on a much higher level than a dream, then his perception that he met God must be correct.\\" But, recall that Christopher Columbus believed that he had discovered India, and the fact that his boats were real and his crewmen were real and the wind was real did not change the fact that his conclusions were all wrong. So, we must be careful totally believing, or totally disbelieving, the visions that Eben Alexander experienced. What seems most obvious is that he does his best in his book to describe his experiences during his state of unconsciousness. And his memories show us that we humans must, in the years ahead, push farther into this shadowy area of human knowledge.<br /><br />Another quote also gives us insight into Alexander's spiritual happening. \\"The Spinning Melody - up to then my ticket into these higher regions - would no longer take me there. The gates of Heaven were closed.\\" And, \\"On the day that the doors of Heaven were closed to me, I felt a sense of sadness unlike any I'd ever known.\\" (Chapter 22). Thus, clearly we meet a man who recalls an experience of entering heaven.<br /><br />But, as we consider this book, and others that tell similar stories of entering heaven (for example, \\"Heaven is for Real\\"), we must consider that a great revelation is available to us in the form of the Christian New Testament. In that book, we learn that the kingdom of heaven does not allow souls that have sin in them to enter heaven. This is made obvious to us in that we are shown a God who is now busily working to destroy the sin in the souls of our Universe. And when he succeeds, \\"clean\\" souls will be brought into the real heaven. Now clearly, if souls that are sinful could enter heaven there would be no reason for God's efforts to cleanse us all of this thing called sin. So it becomes apparent that these near death experiences, while much more \\"solid\\" than our night dreams, often even involving clairvoyance and other paranormal phenomena, are not the ultimate thing that our souls can expect to someday experience when we enter heaven.<br /><br />A last quote, \\"....Om knows what we have forgotten, and understands the terrible burden it is to live with amnesia of the Divine for even a moment. (Chaper15). Here we can see clearly, again, that our author experienced something that was to him a true meeting with God. And his view, after his near death experience, is that he, and others, at some time in the past have enjoyed a closeness with God. This view conflicts, of course, with many scriptures of the New Testament.  I will mention that a book I recently downloaded at no cost presents nearly every scripture in the Bible that discusses the subject of entry into heaven. Many members of Sunday school groups have been sending a flyer around the whole country listing the days when this book can again be downloaded free. I suggest to those who may read and enjoy Proof of Heaven that they should follow with a careful reading of Heaven is in Your Future (DuRocher). That book is not a quick reading experience, but it is down to earth and focused on an almost new age view of the Christian scriptures. Those who like books detailing near death experiences will probably enjoy it because it is not a dry old school view of the meaning of the Christian Bible. It will be free again, according to the email flyer I just received, on Sunday September 22nd, and Sunday September 29th (Amazon Book Store). Download it on your computer and compare it to these new age books. It will be a task that will \\"strain the brain.\\" But, it will be fun.

B0024FAG62|5.0|Kevin Kline in a western!?! Great movie the cast is fantistic well written. When this movie came out in the theathers there wasn't a western made in years, granted there was some great westerns on TV but not on the big screen. Every part of this movie is great.
0545265355|5.0|Saw the 1rst movie on a fluke and immediatly ordered these. I read them all non-stop. The books were in perfect condition and I am anxious to hand them down to someone who will enjoy them as much as I did. Thanks!!
B00DZP3KJ0|4.0|I keep this on my Kindle and it's handy when using Lightroom. Nice reference book. Has all that I need..
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Better than I thought it was going to be. I enjoyed the special effects and the story as well. Better CGI on the giants would have helped but they were entertaining. Entertaining action/fantasy flick and must watch if there isn't anything better to view.

B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Absolute wicked movie. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. One of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time. Was refreshing to see an R-rated horror flick (a dying breed). Haven't seen the original flick as I understand some fans (a friend of mine for one) are comparing the 2.

B004GXZ69W|3.0|I have wrist pain from working on the computer too long, so I decided to splurge on this rather pricey mouse. I've been using it for several months now, and it certainly helps the pain a bit (I also purchased the ladies wrist brace--awesome!), but I can't hold it as it should be held. I find it too slippery to hold how it's been designed, because you can't pick it up if it needs replacing on the table or mousepad. The surface is smooth and doesn't allow for a good grip. A terrible design flaw. If there were a better product, I'd send this one back. Especially for the cost. But in the end I kept it, mainly because it's better than nothing.
B00COCY67A|5.0|great CDs  loved it would buy it again  would recommend it to others  I would rate it a 10+. ok
061891868X|2.0|The trouble with The Trouble With Physics, in my opinion, is that I don't think it will help those outside of physics actually understand the issue.  Their scientific take-away might me limited to something along the lines of \\"Some of these theoretical physicists think that what some of the other physicists are doing isn't on the right track.\\"  I just don't think that Smolin adequately explains the science to non-physicists.<br /><br />There is also, in my opinion, a conspicuous over-emphasis on the glamorous aspects of the life of a theoretical high energy physicist - there is page after page about conferences overlooking the Mediterranean and so on.  There is really too much text devoted to this sort of thing, and frankly, it could feed attitudes against DOE and NSF grants.<br /><br />On the positive side, the book does capture the pressures and politics within high energy physics academia, which I'm sure find reflection in other fields.  This is something that the public could stand to be more aware of, because in large part they are quite confused about what the role of an academic is and what it takes to pursue the career.
B003ITZBW2|4.0|I didn't think they'll be able to pull this off especially with the whole Superboy changing reality by punching the wall from the comics, but they left that out and still told a great story of the red hood. and btw jensen Ackles was awesome.

B00E7L83MK|5.0|This review refers to 'The Grapes of Wrath&#34; (Library Edition Audio CDs) (L.A. Theatre Works Audio Theatre Collections)<br /><br />If you are looking for a straight reading of John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath, you should look elsewhere. However, if you have already read the book, and would like to listen to an excellent performance of the story, you will find this full-cast stage production a fabulous listen.<br /><br />The play is based on the novel and like any play or movie it is adapted; this edition, for audio theatre and presented with a live audience. The emotionally wrought, depression-era journey with the Joads from the Oklahoma to California in the hopes of a better life, will have you on the roller coaster of highs and lows.There are moments filled with anguish and pain and moments to make you smile and even chuckle. The cast is impeccable;they bring Steinbeck's characters to life. The performers include Shirley Knight(Ma Joad), Jeffrey Donovan(Tom Joad), Francis Guinan(Jim Casey) and Emily Bergl(Rose of Sharon). It is directed by Richard Masur and adapted by Frank Galati.<br /><br />There is some folksy music, that makes you want to sing along;original music is composed and performed by The Joel Rafael Band. The sound quality is superb. You will hear crickets and the rain in the background that puts you right there with the Joads. There are 2 CDs and total running time is nearly 2 hours.<br /><br />If you love this story, or even if you are looking for a play to present, don't miss this take. It does absolute justice to Steinbeck's study of the time, place and characters. When the audience gave a rousing ovation, I knew exactly how they felt.<br /><br />Bravo to L.A. Theatre Works and thanks for a wonderful listen.....Laurie<br /><br />P.S. There is some mild language in some of the tenser moments. It's nothing to to get shocked about; it just makes the characters all the more believable.
1455522597|2.0|In DeMille's past books with John Corey as the main character, I have laughed until I cried at Corey's dry humor. The stories have been suspenseful and entertaining. I am terribly disappointed in The Panther. I'm halfway through the book and frankly it's not holding my interest and I doubt that I'll even finish it. Where is the suspense? And the great humor? Where is that? The humor that does exist in the book isn't funny and I've gotten very tired of the \\"humorous\\" questions that are greatly overused in an attempt at humor. It's sad to think that DeMille's great writing may have come to an end, but I personally won't be purchasing any new books written by him after reading The Panther. I find it hard to believe that The Panther is a Nelson DeMille novel. Or is it?

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When I first downloaded this game, it wouldn't work at all. It updated and it finally downloaded and I am so happy. It's super fun and addictive.
B00F35BV64|4.0|As a general rule we do not rent HD streaming content except for big action special effect movies like this one. However, to be a bit cost conscious we rented this one as a standard definition, non-HD stream. It was sub-par for SD streams. The resolution really was horrible for any SD movie. The images were far more obvious digital blocks than any streaming Amazon movie we have ever seen. The quality was so far off it really effected the enjoyment of the movie as a constant annoyance. I even check streaming of other SD video content from other sources after the movie, it was not my equipment or my internet, it was from the Amazon source.<br /><br />The movie itself was a good one, even though I hate the change in time-line that started with the last movie's destroying of Vulcan and now the Enterprise captain Pike's fate has changed that time-line.

1476734941|1.0|Returned our purchase.<br /><br />All recipes and charts are in European metric measurements, requiring that every item be translated into US weights and meausres standard... a time consuming and inconvenient process.<br /><br />Recipes are unimaginative and unappealing compared to other books based on this diet. No Photos either which we consider a significant shortcoming.<br /><br />We were not inspired by this book. Publisher needs to do a serious revamp for the US market! Perhaps with changes we'd take a look again.
1451695195|3.0|I loved every other chapter basically.  The parts I loved were Dr. Alexander's supernatural &#34;experiences&#34;, but thought he elaborated way too much on the scientific and personal  information.  I had to reread and find the part where he &#34;went to heaven&#34;. It is still a powerful book but for the more spiritual/creative brains too much technical/personal and not enough Holy Spirit! However, God works in mysterious ways and I  believe that Dr. A will reach many in the scientific and medical arenas.  May God continue to bless him and his family.

B002TYZKIM|3.0|We saw this in the theater. It's a great movie. It was worth what I paid for it. Same great movie however there are a lot of ripples, lines and it was grainy off and on.... just a general bad recording of the movie we saw. It is watchable... just don't think that you will receive a version for this price.
B0073V7YTY|5.0|I normally use a hardware meter ([[ASIN:B001THX3M0 Mini Digital Sound Level Meter]]) and decided to grab this one for my Samsung Galaxy Note II in case I needed to check sound pressure levels and did not have my hardware meter with me.<br /><br />This one is actually fairly accurate and provides the same results as my hardware meter. Do note that both this software and the hardware meter have limitations. For this the mic on your phone is not designed to pick up a full range of frequencies or amplitude since it is designed mainly for the human voice. According to the web site for this software you should not expect it to be accurate above 100 dB (in fact my phone is cited as accurate up to 91 dB). Take that into account.<br /><br />For me absolute accuracy is not as important as setting relative sound levels for music. This meter is easy to use and is very responsive in changes to sound pressure levels from a stationary point (volume increases), as well as changes as you move closer to away from the sound source. Since I am using it for music volume the latter is important because many local ordinances have restrictions about sound levels that apply to the entrance of a venue. For example a common threshold is at the property line.<br /><br />Another issue is this is A-weighted, which means that this will filter out some of the lower frequencies. This should not be a problem for most folks. In fact it's a plus in many circumstances, but since I am using this as a way to measure SPL for live music this means that some bass notes can carry beyond a property line at a higher SPL than this meter indicates.<br /><br />There are some features that I love. The first is the chart that shows relative sound pressure levels and how they relate to ambient noise and sources. Second, despite the limitations of a phone's mic you can configure this app to display upside down so you can point the mic directly at a sound source and read the display correctly.<br /><br />Bottom line: for quick and dirty measurements this is a nice tool. Do check the developer's web site for specific limitations for some phones because you will need to factor those in. While this is free at the time of this review you are still bloating your phone with every app you install. For me this is worth it, but is no substitute for my hardware meter. And while this does have a calibration mode it has its own limitations, the most glaring of which is because of the mic in your phone.for quick and dirty measurements this is a nice tool.

B00DCX08MW|3.0|I have enjoyed playing this game and enjoy the graphics but there seems to be a problem with the Kindle operating system because it will hang up and shut down the entire device.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I was looking for the game itself not a guide. very complicated to get the game. Why don't they just have an app for the game itself?
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I have a love hate relationship with this game. I like that it truly is free. However, don't believe the review that says you can play for hours at a time. While it's true that you get more energy at higher levels, it also costs a lot more energy per &quot;puzzle&quot; at the higher levels. I can get about 20 minutes of play if I start with fully charged energy. That is by playing a random assortment of &quot;puzzles/boards.&quot;<br /><br />Some things I've noticed:<br /><br />Because you repeat the same boards multiple times, the AI uses many of the same hiding spots for items.<br /><br />The AI will change the color/shading of items to blend into the background to make them very difficult to find.<br /><br />The AI will hide the items behind other objects in a scene. So sometimes you will only see the top of an object, also making it very difficult to find items.<br /><br />The AI will rotate items to make them harder to find, especially when the color is changed and it's half hidden behind something else.<br /><br />I have had to use the hints a lot. So far I've only bought more with game money. As soon as it wants me to use real money, I'll be done with the game because most of the puzzles at higher levels are to hard to finish without using at least one hint.

140006922X|5.0|From the very first sentence, Aslan grabs the reader and doesn't let go til the end. As one who has studied Judaism at the time of Jesus I appreciate his understanding of the culture and the language which was not always translated correctly to the Greek. He presents a true picture of the man Jesus, who was a man of peace when it was appropriate and very much a zealot when provoked by the tyranny of the Romans. He refers often to the writings of Josephus to provide clarity to the life and times of those living in those perilous times. I highly recommend this book as one to add to your library.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|For anyone who's veins course with geek blood this is a must. A rivetting read and I could not recommend it more.
B00011D1OA|5.0|I bought this Special Edition and as I watched the ending I thought I would review it. I just had to get this out of my system. Although it is one of the best musicals ever made by Jack Warner studios et al and I did watch all the special features on the second disc, however I feel that they should not have made Henry so chauvinistic in his relationship to Eliza Doolittle. And even her last name created a stigma for her as a flower girl turned into a Fair Lady. I feel he treated her horridly bad. The ending really shocked me. When she comes back to him after not marrying Freddy the handsome, jobless Casanova, singing \\"Here on the street where you live,\\" Henry simply asks her in a smug manner, \\"where are my blasted slippers?\\" He is sitting in a wooden chair with his hat pulled down over his head and his back to her instead of getting up to embrace her with a hug and a kiss. How awful! What a wonderful ending that would have made. That is the ending that would have endeared millions and myself to this lovely story. But as it is, I think it rather stinks for that reason and the writers missed a marvelous opportunity to make all women more loved and respected in America. I feel that film started an attitude in the minds of men that women are just for slipper fetching, dinner making and sex. This is my own opinion but I am sure I am not the only one who saw that and cringed. But over all, it was well done and the acting is superb. I am sorry Audrey did not win an Oscar that year the her performance. I heard Julie Andrews say that her Oscar \\"was a sympathy vote\\" for not getting the role of Eliza in the film when she has made it famous in the Broadway Musical for over three years running with Rex. So sad! I recommend this 1994 restoration DVD with wonderful special features. Five stars!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. too bad it cost money to get the good things. but its still fun to play when your board
B000I9WW6I|4.0|I watched this over and over. I really liked it in a sorted sort of way? And it took me a while to see the relationship between the two women that was more than just friends. I also was shocked by the barbequing of Frank Bennett, Ruth Jamison's Klu Kluxing, wife beating husband. I read the Kindle book after seeing the film version and there is little similarity. They left out most of the best parts. The book is 415 pages and so detailed. Fanny is a wonderful writer but somewhat sinister in this one. Most of the good humor was felt out of the film with some violence left in. The death of Idgie's brother Buddy at the very beginning, using a train, was so sad. It turned Idgie into a masculine woman so that she never married and ended up felling in love with Ruth, a family friend.<br /><br />At the end of the book Idgie is still alive, in her eighties, living in the woods with Julian, her oldest living brother selling honey out of an old store or so it seemed. In the book version Ninny Threadgoode died while Evelyn is at a fat farm  and she does NOT go home to live with Evelyn and Ed Couch. To go that far away from the original story is a real stretch and if I were Fanny Flagg, I would have never allowed that! The film made for a happy ending and we all love a happy endings, but it wasn't true. So much of the movie was not in the original book but Hollywood is famous for destroying so many wonderful books. It seems to be their mission in life to ruin really good books and turn them into money making enterprises which is just what they did here. A pretty good movie if you didn't read the book. But read it anyway just for a better story.

B0055MI8K2|1.0|I used these sandals very lightly and on both I noticed a deep crack started to form on the sole in the same location where the shoe would fold by normal walk... I had them only for a year (I normally average 3-5 years on shoes) the sole has minimal to no wear on it. My old 10 dollar sandals are more durable.<br /><br />Additionally after a short walk the shoe would fill with nasty smelly goo that I remove later on once it hardens... not sure if that's from the glue that holds the shoe together?<br /><br />I was expecting an exceptional sandal for the $70 I paid, I was very disappointed. will not buy again.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is my new obsession! Cassandra Clare is a fantastic author! I will say I wasn't sure about this series at first. I have read a lot of series kind like this one, the first one I read was The Twilight Saga Series and loved it, the I read The Vampire Diaries Series it was just ok. I say this all because this series is so beautifully written it becomes a world you want to be apart of yourself and you want to be the characters in the story! I would recommend this book to everyone who wants a place escape to and dream. By the was Jace and Clary are ment to be together!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Action, a decent plot, and excellent actors, all without losing the humor and irreverence that was a trade mark of the original series.
0385345054|4.0|Well organized in 5 sections, flowers, materials, skills, how-to, and templates, this book offers a lot of variety when it comes to paper flower projects. I confess that before I opened the book for a first quick glance, I was somewhat doubtful I would get much out of it, but to my surprise I was proven wrong. The flowers you can replicate are (almost) as varied as there are flowers on the planet and with the helpful and thorough instructions given this book was a breeze to go through. Want to make a mobile? Create realistic looking foliage? How about a fascinator? Delft & Flow blue flowers, anyone? Easy peasy with the handy how-to instructions.<br /><br />So why 4 stars and not 5? The overall design of the book left me a bit wanting, wanting for more variety in photography and color styling. Now don't get me wrong, this is a brick of a book and you get a ton of value/info for your money, no doubt about it. But for me the projects started to blur into each other after a while of flipping through them, the whole color scheme of the book was a bit too over-designed and matchy-matchy for my taste - too much of the same colors and photography. It's like eating cake for 3 days, on day 3 you get kind of over it and all you want is a BLT sandwich for a salty change. However, this opinion of mine should not deter you from getting this book if you are looking for an inexpensive way to spruce up your home, make deco for a really nice party or simply create some beautiful gifts. If you like paper and flowers - this book will give you everything you could want and more. Great buy.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|game's great and all but the adds stink they always have to interrupt<br />you in the middle of the level I hate that so much it really stinks  other than that though it's really fun please buy
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have no idea why I like this show so much. Maybe it's the great acting, or the interesting time period(s) in which the tale takes place. It could quite possibly be the idea of viewing what the life of the privileged was like, with the ups & downs that the family has to go through and the realistic storyline that is portrayed. For whatever the reason may be, this season is a great addition to the story of the Crawley family and Co..
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is really awesome and for you people that have the 7.5 version pe a diamond seed is herobrine. Make a new world and for the seed put in herobrine
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Love it!!! The entire sg-1 series is awesome. Richard Dean Anderson is hilarious. I could spend a week watching the entire series
B004P1JEXE|4.0|If you're looking for continuity in the story of your favorite characters, this book is not for you. What you will get though is a pause, by &#34;pause&#34; I mean a diversion from the main stories. The lesser characters from the previous books get their chance they're used as a bridge to illustrate the passing of time between the previous book and the next. I say this as someone who hasn't read the next one yet. The shocks are fewer but the stories are just as good.
B006L1TT8G|5.0|I love all the songs on this cd. I do kind of regret buying it since a day or two after I received the CD their album was available on iTunes. Ah wells. Their music is fun to listen to.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|I love this movie. It was funny and sweet. I love the relationship between the two main characters. I did not mind reading subtitles. I heard that they're going to do an American remake of it but I don't see why they need to. Just watch this movie. It is a heartwarming movie.
B006QNDDHW|1.0|I bought this book hoping to gain some insight and tips on slide design.  Unfortunately, reading it on the Kindle was difficult at best.<br /><br />The book's layout may be amazing in print; on the Kindle, it is unusable.  Two-column layout and fidelity to the book's graphics were maintained, but little thought seems to have been given to what it would look like on an e-reader.  The experience was more like trying to read a pdf rather than a native Kindle file format.  I've given up after a few tries.<br /><br />This may be the best book on slide design in the world, but you will never know if you try to read it on the Kindle.  The author and publisher should never have allowed it to be published for e-readers.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this book for your Kindle.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|This is the best work Selena Gomez has produced thus far. The album shows her maturity and development as an artist over her previous albums. The album has a consistent sound yet a range of unique songs.
B007K3UVNQ|4.0|If you need an hour of high energy thrash, this album totally does the trick. Best music purchase in the genre I've made in quite some time.
B005U9REU0|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The acting was terrible, the story was boring.  I don't understand why it ever got good reviews.  I hated it.
B00CRW2066|5.0|From one of the greatest modern alternative rock bands out there comes another fantastic, 5-star album.  Matt Berninger is one of the greatest lyricists and deliverer of those lyrics in our time.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|(Warning Spoilers) Being a huge Star Trek fan I guess this is about as good as it get's without having the original cast.  Of course the productions with J.J. are better than the old movies but I wish the casting for the villain was a little closer to the original.  Cumberbatch did an excellent job by the way but, J.J. had already done an excellent job recasting the original characters so why so far off with Khan?  Maybe someone that would appear a little closer to Montalban?  Well, I'm sure that was the intent as I'm  sure that Del Toro is kicking himself now for not coming aboard, and I'm sure this casting only disturbs fans or anyone familiar with original characters.  This is my only complaint.<br /><br />Good Action, production and I'm definitely looking forward to more movies with this crew!
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|This is a great movie and I just had to write a review after seeing it. I can assure anyone who is looking for a great movie to watch and that is available in 3D ( I love Blu-Ray 3D but the selection is a bit limited )<br />That this movie is simply tons of fun to watch and enjoy.<br /><br />The film is lighthearted in nature, and the acting is actually much better then I expected. Kudo's to the Director and to all of the cast. The 3D effects are amoung the best I have seen so far. I have been buying Blue Ray 3D movies and some of them are great stuff to watch, and others are absolutely awful to watch. No plot, worse acting, and no real 3D effects.<br /><br />( I should add here that when I bought my 3D system, none of the reviews i came across mentioned the difference between passive and active 3D. So I bought an LG 47 inch passive 3D 6200 series TV. It was one of the highest and best ranked TVs.<br />Later I discovered that Active 3D has significantly better 3d effects. I didn't do my homework.. And nothing was mentioned regarding the 2 different types of 3D available when I was reading through Amazon product specifications either.  I actually was unaware there were 2 different types of 3D at the time. If I could do it again I would definitely buy a Samsung LED TV with Active 3D, and may still do so, while delegating this TV to a different room. But as I wrote above I should have done some research. Actually the LG model I did buy has some pretty good Passive 3D abilities and LG displays are excellent for HD movies also. so I can wait for a bit while pricing points start to drop on all of this 3D tech. As prices always do drop especially on TV systems. )<br /><br />Anyway I wanted to include the above information because even on my passive 3D system, this film had tons of great special effects flying out of the TV and aiming right for me...  I actually tried to block an image of a small rock that was flying right at me, instinctively.. Pretty amazing for a 3D passive system. I can only imagine what this film would be like with Active 3D tech.<br /><br />So I highly recommend this film for everyone, its not violent, its not scary! It is very engaging for the type of movie that it is. And it has some suspense filled moments. It has been done with an overall sense of very good Humor throughout the film, and has, of course, the usual but well managed love interest theme going on throughout it.<br />Getting into the great mood and the upbeat rhythm of this film is easy to do and its a great 3D movie on an early Saturday evening type of movie. It has a really good sound track as well.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Loved Billy and Mike from all their past work.  However, I was blown away by Richie as for whatever reason I never really heard any of his past work.  Well now of course I've started checking his catalog and wow, a great musician, how was it that I overlooked him for so long?  Probably that Poison connection, anyway, these guy's gelled and have created some great music!<br /><br />A very soulful, bluesy classic rock with a little motown thrown in and it works, and this is coming from a guy who's taste generally lead towards heavier instrumental prog type of stuff.  Each guy shines bringing their A game and Mike shows that he's great with half the kit he normally uses.  Can't wait to see them live!
B000AWYOGE|4.0|Critics who dissed this movie got it wrong.  This is a really engaging, creepy, and underrated flick.  Yes, there's no gore and not a lot of \\"shocks\\" but it's all about the atmosphere here, and it's got tons of that, beginning with the drab and foreboding Roosevelt Island, NYC, apartment building Dahlia and her daughter Ceci are forced to move into, designed in the \\"brutalist style\\" -- all concrete and steel.  There's little sunshine in this movie; every day seems to be overcast and raining.  The apartment house itself is the bogeyman here, with its dim fluorescent lights, dripping ceilings, creepy stairwells, and menacing inhabitants.  This film also marked one of John C. Reilley's last performances before his career really took off, and he's great here, as a smarmy rental agent.  Pete Postlethwaite also does a great job as a creepy superintendent.  There's even something \\"off\\" about one of the seemingly good characters -- Tim Roth -- as Dahlia's lawyer, although that's never quite explained.  Jennifer Connelly does a great job as Dahlia, projecting a woman who's been scarred by life but does her best to keep things together to give her daughter the upbringing she never had.  I understand those who say that this is not a great \\"scare\\" flick, but if you're looking for something more subtle, that's all about characters and atmosphere, Dark Water delivers the goods. Definitely recommended.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Non stop action! Very entertaining. Watch it again and again. Best movie of the year. Gives us a new take on zombies.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Thisis a good search games.  The puzzles were challenging at times, but not too difficult.  I was surprised, though, to find out it's a &quot;to be continued&quot; which is good but annoying at the same time.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|Not very often do I watch a movie twice, but the main character has a way of dealing with his world and loving his family that so defies the ordinary, that I'm looking forward to watching it again with a friend soon.
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started I needed to keep reading. Great reading and enjoyed it. The movie should be quite interesting and should be a good movie

B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Why they cancelled this show with a cliffhanger episode sitting out there, I'll forever fail to understand.  This was an awesome show, especially if you're a fan of Terminator canon.
B000ID3KU6|2.0|This was a great disappointment for me, I had expected something much better considering the great actors involved. A rip off of Eastwood spagetti westerns, & poorls done at that. Too long & drawn out,

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Hooked since the first chapter - this story invokes feelings that as a parent you never want to endure. You sympathize with all the characters as you try and hash through what could happen next, how it's going to end. Pick it up, and good luck putting it down. Great book!
9382951008|5.0|Hosseini is great at character development and this is another example. He exposes the brutality of life in poverty in Afghanistan, the brutality of war and the warlords. He shows us how love and compassion can shine through in the worst of circumstances and paints a portrait of the changes in the country over a number of years with such excellence that the &#34;American high end vehicle &#34; once belonging to Suleman becomes symbolic of the time passing and the times changing. Readers should be prepared for the deepest sorrow that war, poverty, social change can bestow on humans.....and the -much needed- exposure of a culture far different from ours. This is another  &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34;
B00AEBBADG|1.0|I feel so ripped off.<br /><br />How can you not start with the wonder wheel intro?<br />How can you keep removing the fantastic tension and excitement from scene after scene?<br /><br />Okay... I could understand a second disc or a side 2 with all these other scenes (re)inserted (haphazardly)... and trying to show you know some editing tricks... but you MUST include the \\"near perfect\\" original as well!!!<br /><br />Who would think that people wouldn't want the cult movie classic they've already seen 50 or 100 times over the years?<br />It should be mandatory for every business person to learn the \\"new coke\\" story. Try something new if you want... but don't REPLACE the one everybody loves with that copy. I mean... duh...
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Not your typical lawyer/client show.  Extremely well written.  Excellent cast of actors. Stories are very original but have twists that keep you hanging on!

B004QSQMKE|5.0|Great deal thanks so much for the trade.  The item was just as described and I was very pleased with the transactions.
B003XRELEI|5.0|If the surreal and absurd tickles your fancy, this is the one for you. Creative, original and funny. What more can one ask for in a book. This was my pool-side read this summer. Wish I hadn't picked it up so that I could be amused and surprised again.
B00CJCHJ8S|5.0|I am so grateful that Harry Nilsson's recordings have finally been given the attention, appreciation and respect they deserve. He was a brilliant songwriter and the greatest pop singer of his generation. All of these albums have additional and mostly wonderful recordings I never heard before. Even though I own most of Harry's catalog in some form, vinyl, cassette, and CD, there are a lot nice surprises here. When Harry sings the Everly Bros. hit 'Walk Right Back', I think, 'that would have been a hit record'! Harry Nilsson's life was cut too short by smoking, drugs and booze but his legacy is preserved here. I met Harry at a Beatles convention in '81, and he was warm, kind and next to me, a towering giant.  I am blessed I got to meet one of my musical heroes. I still miss and love Harry Nilsson but thanks to this incredible box set, I get to spend time with him again, in the quiet of the evening. And these songs I grew up with sound new again due to the richness of this production, hearing vocals and instruments I never heard before. If you have ever loved any one of Harry's hits, you owe it to yourself to buy this, while it is here to buy. JOM
B002UM5BXW|5.0|Being in the restaurant business myself I found this book to be highly entertaining.  I kept nodding in recognition while reading it. Your line of work, however, is not important as this book reveals some of the secrets of the wonderful world of food and drink. Read it.
0375707972|5.0|My favorite book.  Really moving and a great, thoughtful read.  I recommend this book to all interested in a very historical love story.

B008JFUN6E|5.0|\\"You will do something very important one day. Something you were born for.\\" In the year 2154 the class system of Earth got out of control. Now the super rich live on a \\"floating planet\\" called Elysium where poverty, crime and disease are non-existent. Max (Damon) has a dream of one day going there but he is stuck working in a factory making robots. When he becomes exposed to a high level of radiation he has 5 days to live, unless he can find a way to Elysium. He will do anything for that chance. I was excited about seeing this but also a little hesitant because I didn't really like District 9. While you could tell this was the same director, it did have the same feel and look, I liked this one much much more. This had action, drama, suspense and something that a lot of movies are lacking these days, emotion and heart. This isn't simply just a race to save a life, it becomes so much more and the story is what keeps you watching not just the effects. I had pretty high expectations for this going in and I was not disappointed. I highly recommend this. I give it an A.
1907523588|4.0|This novel opens with the Ramsay family on holiday in England.  Mrs. Ramsay loves her children above all else and thinks that motherhood is the ultimate in achievement and happiness.  She spends this day in time running the household, tending to the needs of their guests, matchmaking two of the young folks who are with them, and trying to protect her youngest son from the disappointment of a possibly canceled outing the next morning.  Her husband storms about, lost in his own selfish thoughts, carelessly hurting his children's feelings.<br /><br />The narration passes from person to person, and we are able to observe the Ramsay family from various angles on this day.<br /><br />Time passes in the middle section.  Many things change, and a decade later one of the guests from the original section, a painter named Lily, is back at the vacation house.  Everything is different, although she is much the same, struggling with her art.  She remembers the Ramsay family and thinks about what they meant to her as she works on her painting.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written story.  I liked being able to get inside the heads of different characters, to see how they thought about each other.  I especially loved the middle section of this book, in which the passage of time is seen through the objects in the vacation home.
B00BEIYMIS|4.0|\\"The devil exists. God exists. And for us, as people, our very destiny hinges on which we decide to follow.\\" When the Perron family moves into a new house they begin to notice strange events and images happening. When the kids refuse to be alone the family contacts paranormal investigators Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) Warren to help them figure out what is going on. What they find is something that none of them could have imagined and could destroy the lives of everyone involved. I have said over and over that I am not a huge horror movie fan mainly because I'm not a fan of the \\"let's chop people up\\" aspect. The ones that scare me are the subdued and psychological thrillers like Insidious and The Exorcism Of Emily Rose. This one can be added to the list. To me being alone in a house and seeing an empty baby roller chair moving on its own while you hear the music from a jack-in-the-box playing is way more terrifying then being chased by a man with a chainsaw. While this didn't scare me like the other two I mentioned it came close and this along with The Purge are the best horror movies to come out in a while. Overall, creepy and very much worth seeing if you want to see a true horror movie. I give it a B+.

B008XNPO20|5.0|This review is for the vinyl version of Lonerism.<br /><br />On the merits of its songs, this album deserves five stars without a doubt.  I bought the vinyl version from amazon and was disappointed to find that the fourth side of this two-album set does not contain the fourth side of Lonersim at all, instead it contains the fourth side of Kurt Vile's &#34;Wakin On a Pretty Daze&#34;.  I love the Kurt Vile album, too, but it's certainly not what I expected to hear when I flipped &#34;Lonerism&#34; over to listen to its final twenty-five percent.<br /><br />I sent my defective copy back to amazon after explaining the problem.  They dispatched a new one, but, the exact same situation exists with me second copy.  Oh, well.  I decided to keep it because it does contain four sides of quality music that I love, even if it's only 3/4 of &#34;Lonerism&#34;.
0143124544|3.0|It's a little too well-pat, and too well-summarized for me.<br /><br />The characters have the fears and say the things that I would expect them to say.  Unfortunately.  I really wanted to like this book a lot.  The relationship with her parents is superb and is very well done.  I thing the characters could have been deeper, and I wish they had been.  I don't know how the author could have accomplished this.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|No surprise Martin has done it again.  Its is a quick read. Good continuation of the series. Just wish they would publish more frequently. ;)
030758836X|4.0|It's a thought-provoking, detail-rich story.  It's fast-paced.  It's unexpected.  It's incredibly well thought out.  All the details.<br /><br />The diary is a superb piece of the story.<br /><br />The story is enthralling.  However, there's something missing in Gone Girl at the level of the characters.  The parent characters are a bit two-dimensional, but that can be expected when they're seen from other people's point of view.  And Nick doesn't act in line with how he's been created to be.  It's like a drink has been poured, but left at the bar instead of having been drunk quickly.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book is now one of my favorites. It's not the same as the movie. It's a great piece of writing on its own.
B0079XPUOW|1.0|I read Old Man's War and found it contrived and the premise ridiculous.  But a friend recommended Redshirts and he has good taste so I thought I'd give it a try.  Well, the same issues riddle this book as well.  I kept saying, this doesn't make sense over and over and finally gave up halfway through.  Not a good read for anyone who likes logic in their stories.

It's more annoying than anything and overall pretty useless.  I prefer to just wait until I'm able to use my laptop to log into Facebook even if it means waiting til tomorrow instead of getting the completely outdated posts this app shows.  There must be something better than this app for Facebook users!!

0307476073|1.0|From The Guardian:<br />At just 26, Strayed had a lot of shit to shovel. She had lost her mother to cancer, flunked college one paper short of a degree, been divorced from a husband she still loved, and generally thrashed about in the shockwaves of this extended trauma. Drifting from state to state for several years, she was now in Minneapolis where she waited tables and had sex with strangers. She was so far from the idea of herself she had grown up with that she had come, literally, to assume a new identity: when her divorce was finalised, she changed her (undisclosed) surname to Strayed.<br /><br />Choosing a new name for yourself is both a symbolic gesture and a statement of intent, a strategic investment in the future. Strayed was a shrewd choice; it was clever not to choose Strays, which implies a refusal or inability to change. In a culture that rewards the remodelling of the self, \\"Strayed\\" is a canny piece of self-agency - a kind of directed lack of direction in which every signpost points to personal overcoming and a slot on the Oprah Winfrey Book Club.<br /><br />Armed with a problem of existence and a surname that incorporated it, Strayed returned to the hardware store and bought the guidebook. She worked tables and saved and gradually assembled the necessary equipment and provisions (including condoms) for a solo hike along a section of the Pacific Crest trail that runs through California and Oregon. She packed supply boxes and arranged for a friend to mail them at intervals to post offices near the trail. Finally, seven months on, she took her first steps on the PCT, with the goal of reaching the Bridge of the Gods (redemption being on the agenda), a thousand miles to the north. Her backpack was so heavy she couldn't stand upright. She called it \\"Monster\\". Thus encumbered with a burden that could not be borne - she had become her own ugly baggage - she stumbled awkwardly on to the path of self-discovery.<br /><br />What follows is a thoroughly artlesstranscription of personal history, a kind of anti-Kerouac memoir where the heat of immediacy is sacrificed, maddeningly, to the cooler demands of meaningfulness. A bear appears on the trail, runs off when Strayed blows her emergency whistle, but in which direction, ahead of her or behind? Cue existential sweat about walking the line (as in, you know, life), facing your fears, advancing rather than retreating. The bear is significant. For her. It exists, like everything else in what might otherwise have been a striking landscape, only as a subdivision of her own concerns. A fox looks at her. She whispers to it, \\"Fox\\". He ambles off, she calls gently, ruefully, \\"Come back,\\" and when he doesn't she shouts \\"MOM! MOM! MOM!\\" The fox can't just be a fox, he has to be transformed into an integer of loss, a piece of mental taxidermy.<br /><br />Long distance walking requires a kind of rhythm, and so does writing about it. Strayed has a tin ear for this, and keeps missing the beat. It is a singular achievement to describe a thousand-mile walk and leave the reader so far behind. She encounters a charging Texas longhorn bull, rattlesnakes, some more bears, she hears the yip-yip of coyotes at night, her toenails fall off because her boots are too tight, she loses one boot so has to walk in plastic sandals held together with gaffer tape, her skin chafes and bleeds under the heft of her pack, she is forced off the trail by record snowfalls, she meets a man and has sex with him, she meets other men and manages not to have sex with them - all this recorded in prose more broken and uneven than any wilderness trail. Oh for the tarmacadam of a single smooth sentence, with no slip roads leading into metaphysical dead-ends like this one: \\"What if what made me do all those things everyone thought I shouldn't have done was what also had got me here?\\" What?<br /><br />Strayed reached the Bridge of the Gods, in case you were wondering. She found \\"the me inside of me\\". She has sold the film rights to Reese Witherspoon, with Nick Hornby, who finds this book to be \\"brilliantly written\\", supplying the screenplay. Oprah loves it and has welcomed Strayed to her industrial complex of self-transformation. Nice one Cheryl.

B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I'm not a fan of most comic-book film adaptations. I couldn't care less - they are almost all terrible. Even Joss Whedon (who is incredibly talented) couldn't make a good film out of the \\"Avengers\\" - he could only make an otherwise dismal plot reasonably entertaining. \\"Captain America\\", \\"Iron Man\\", \\"Spider Man\\", \\"Batman/Dark Knight\\", \\"Wolverine\\", \\"Superman\\"... billions of dollars being wasted on the cinematic equivalent of a Domino's Pizza. Awful, but somehow consumed by masses of people without a second thought (apparently a million a day worldwide - fun fact).<br /><br />Now I know, most of my complaints so far are about Disney/Marvel movies. These are clearly cynically pumped out as part of a Goldmanesque moneymaking scheme aimed at defrauding twenty and thirty-somethings of the treasured comic-book memories of their youth. Unfortunately I also find the majority of \\"arthouse\\" comic-book films to be entirely worthless as well. Take \\"V for Vendetta\\", \\"The 300\\", \\"Sin City\\", \\"Blade\\"... none of these (OK, I didn't actually watch \\"The 300\\", I watched a preview, passed-judgement, and went happily on with my life) were any good. I do have a soft spot for \\"Blade II\\" and \\"Hellboy\\", but mostly because the former had stylish, well-done visuals and the latter was unabashedly quirky (oh, and Guillermo del Toro is actually a really talented director, which shines through - unlike, say the labors of the Wachowski siblings, who are clearly just talentless hacks).<br /><br />OK, so finally we get to \\"Dredd\\", which I watched because I was trying to take a short break from working and figured I could quickly tune it out or turn it off. I've seen \\"Judge Dredd\\", the original starring that tiny little musclebound man from the 80's, and that was awful, so low expectations were at least warranted. The beginning was all very blah, with car chases and cheesy (not so special) effects. For perhaps five to ten minutes I figured \\"Dredd\\" was going to live up to my very low expectations. Then something miraculous happened - good acting. So much of it that at first I was just kind of annoyed. \\"Why is Karl Urban trying so hard?\\" I thought to myself. \\"Doesn't he know that this is a B-movie?\\". But no, Karl is there acting away as if he had just landed the lead role in BladeRunner, and this female lead who I vaguely recognize as Suzanne from \\"Bored to Death\\" is also doing an awesome job. Then I noticed that the lead villain was also really ****ing good, and that it was actually Lena Headey buried under all that makeup. Then all of a sudden \\"Dredd\\" started making this sad little low-budget environment that it was confined to an interesting stage. What had been a relatively tired, generic movie had rapidly transcended into some strange, seldom reached nether-realm of cinematic awesomeness (I can only think of \\"Cowboy Beebop\\" and \\"Ichi the Killer\\" as occupying an at all similar plane of existence).<br /><br />95 short minutes later I had happily watched the entire film, and damn if it wasn't actually really good. Good in a way that \\"Sin City\\" or \\"V for Vendetta\\" should have been, except the latter actually had a really great plot that was destroyed by lousy acting and terrible directing, and \\"Dredd\\" was a kind of inverse to \\"V\\" - a real treat wrapped around a generic boring plot that had been so compacted by a well-executed film that it almost seemed sarcastically self-aware.<br /><br />So there you go. If you want to see a well-acted, well directed film that has substance and style beyond all expectations and the vast majority of the genre, give \\"Dredd\\" a viewing.
0307279189|5.0|This book absolutely entertained AND educated me! It seriously has changed my view of why we run and how we should be running! I am currently in the process of retraining my feet in minimalist shoes! I have always had an inkling that these fancy rigid shoes with high arched orthotics were just a bandaid and not the answer to address the cause! I'm excited to see how much my running with improve! I'm already running faster!

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was an interesting novel where 3 separate women with different circumstances end up in the same small home town later in life.  They connect through a school involving their children, a school secretary and a teacher.  It turns out the a suspected killer of a high school student, from many years ago, is not the real killer but is another of the wives husband.  When the secret is revealed in later life, it changes all three families lives, but this bad secret revealed turns out for the best.<br /><br />Good writing and good story.

159514188X|5.0|This book is so amazing. It will change your life. It's so emotional and really hits you hard an makes you think about life.
140006922X|5.0|I just finished reading this fascinating book, and I plan on ordering my own copy to share with friends.  If you are wondering whether you should buy and read the book, it all depends.  Do you need and enjoy the comfort and security of blind faith?  If yes, then please do not buy this book.  There is nothing wrong with simply wanting to go through life without struggling to discern truth from fiction, as long as your blind faith does not tell you to hate others that don't share your beliefs.  After all, the basic premise of faith is to believe without knowing, otherwise it would not be called faith.<br />If, on the other hand, you do not wish to parrot what you have heard in Sunday school, you want to snap from your hypnotism, you want to think on your own at the risk of some discomfort, then this book is a good place to start.  Buy it, read it, research the extensive references it provides, and set yourself free from the chains that bind your thoughts.  It is just a starting point on a long journey that you may never finish, but I promise you will thoroughly enjoy.<br />Regarding the one-star ratings, I do not believe all are insincere.  After all, there is nothing more sacred to us than our faith, and a book that seems to question the foundation we have built since childhood is surely to illicit extreme reactions from all of us, especially those with blind and child-like faith.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The book was fascinating from beginning to end. I loved the premise, the characters, and the look back at the sixties.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I knew The Hunger Games was dark, but what a sad ending! The Hunger Games was an amazing series from beginning to end, and it's great for all ages. I wanted a happier ending for Katniss, the same way I would want a happy ending for a great friend, but life doesn't always turn out that way. I appreciate that Collins was true to her vision, and felt this was a satisfying conclusion to a great series.
140006922X|5.0|Reza Aslan has done the world a service. Everyone should read this book - not just Christians. It is important to know how Christianity got its start. It has shaped our world. How did it all start? Aslan tells the story. Jesus was an amazing person to have done what he did, had the following he had, and had it be sustained after his death. Nearly two thousand years later, we could just as easily be discussing a worldwide religious belief started by Theudas, Athronges, Hezekiah, Simon of Perea, Judas the Galilean, Menahem, Simon son of Giora, Simon son of Kochba, the Essenes, the Zealots, or the Sicarii, all messianic revolutionaries in the first centuries B.C.E. and C.E. I thank Reza Aslan for devoting over 20 years of his life in an obviously sincere and serious effort to understand that period. His toil is our benefit. The history is riveting: A hundred years of Jewish revolt against Roman occupiers; Rome's merciless attacks on those revolutionaries and their followers, most far exceeding in horror the attacks on Jesus and his followers; the events in the run-up to the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 C.E.; and the interweaving in that story of the roots of Christianity. That story is jaw dropping: The Jewishness of Jesus' followers; the morphing of his following in the mid-60s C.E. into the image of Paul (Saul of Tarsus); the further morphing after 70 C.E. by Greco-Roman followers of Paul (a.k.a. Mark, Matthew, Luke, John) who wanted to distance the 'Jesus following' from the pariah Jews; and the institutionalizing of Paul's movement by the Roman state into the early Catholic Church. I never heard of Reza Aslan until I heard him interviewed on NPR about a month ago, i.e., I'm not his agent. I'm just a guy who always wondered about the origins of Christianity. Now I know.

0399159347|5.0|This was a very entertaining and poignant book; and it had an ending that did more than just wrap things up: it explained things in a way that justified the plot trajectory to where it all finally made complete sense. There was a quality of juicy chick lit, but there was also an insight into certain types of people that had me saying, \\"Yes! That's so true!\\" These characters aren't stock, each is human in a unique way; and the plot turns on their struggles with what kinds of people they are.<br />  I know this review is a bit abstract. I'm not detailing plot points because other reviewers have already done that. I'm just saying that I totally recommend this book, and am looking forward to reading the author's other novels.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love this game! It is a bit addicting though. Just wish I could connect with others without Facebook Maybe the company will offer that in the future?
B00B00RJJO|5.0|This album is one more work from Billy Bragg that you would have destroyed if you’d bought it vinyl. Well done.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great writing... Very intense, keeps you from putting it down. I don't know how the movie will do it justice.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|You haven't watched this yet? Shame on you, Unlike Citizen Kane you won't feel like you are eating your vegetables. Many Bugs Bunny cartoons will be funnier after you watch this. Enjoy
B003VXMMTK|4.0|I had read the book and the movie did not disappoint. The background and the clothes were right on. The actors did a great job of depicting what I got out of the book.
B004L07KWQ|4.0|I love what this does but the instructions are not clear.<br />I am an adult but this is for kids ...I am also an artist so I had fun with it but not sure a 4 year old who loves to draw will understand what this can do!  Needs better<br />pictorial directions!

B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's pretty good.  I just got it but I  over all like it.  I just wish at the beginning they let you choose between like, 3 different kinds of horses.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|This movie is a completely underrated comic book action movie. It is fun and funny and keeps you engaged till the very end. The Bluray has some good special features and behind the scenes featuretts. Great movie I recommend it highly!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I love Star Trek and this one is great because it ties all the other ones together filling in the back story of Captain Kirk
B002QYUV5M|5.0|I'd never even heard of this film before my friend made me watch it, so I had almost no expectations going into it. I have to admit, Robert Downey, Jr. does a fantastic job of playing a stumble-bum with very little in the way of brains.
1451695195|5.0|We enjoyed reading it, was interesting and spiritual! I would recommend it to anyone who is concerned about Heaven, lovely book.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|This is a cute fairy tail movie for the kids and adults.  It puts a new twist on the stories we are told as a kid.  Lots of adventure and excitement for the whole family to enjoy.
B005OP7162|5.0|Looking forward to the new season, a great show! The cast of characters are perfect! A great Story Line! Check it out!
B009DKFSUA|3.0|Has a few good songs, but not what I expected. I love Pitbull, but other than the hit songs that are on the radio, there wasn't much on the CD that I liked.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Proving his case in a very defensive, term paper, lawyer-like way. But not the fastest moving book of all time.
B00005JLO2|4.0|This is actually a very enjoyable film, if you aren't too hepped up on scarlet coats vs. khaki.  There are some spectacular scenes (the climactic battle is one of the best filmed battles ever -- perhaps not \\"Zulu\\" or \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" level, but actually interesting, with some fresh vision applied to the standard old boring British square vs. the fuzzy-wuzzies.  The plot is as ridiculous as ever, and is now layered with political correctness (the recent Iraq war has influenced some of the Arab-British confrontations), but everything is much more lively than the Korda version (which lots of people think is great, and I think is dull cardboard, except for Ralph Richardson chewing up the scenery).<br /><br />The interesting issue in the film is Heath Ledger, now considered to be some kind of actor god. He's not very good here,  and drags the film down. He has an interesting vulnerability -- which is essential to the character -- but somehow it doesn't do much for us in this film, as opposed to elsewhere.<br /><br />The part of the Korda film which was always intriguing was the attack on C. Aubrey Smith and the military mind (deftly turned into comedy by Korda, otherwise he wouldn't have been able to get away with it in 1939!).  Some updated version of that towards the end gets lost here, which is a pity.<br /><br />But enjoyable overall.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great Fun to while away your time and exercise you brain cells working out some unusual puzzles that are not to difficult

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|my first impressions of this microphone was the sound quality is amazing the only bad part about it is.that cord gets tangled very easily its like a 20 foot cord.but if you're looking for a high quality audio and for the price range you cannot beat this I use it on my Canon camcorder and it sounds amazing so this microphone is good for youtube .the only reason why I cannot give it 5 stars is that 20 foot cord gets very tangled and Messi.so guys just because it's cheap doesn't mean it's not great so go buy it and you'll have Krispy clean audio
1551525143|5.0|I have never been so in love yet so heartbroken by the same story. It really is a poetic story about a girl accepting herself. And the hopes of an eternal love. Perfection. Really I recommend it to anyone, lesbian or not. It helps you realize love is not something defined by gender, but by what is in your heart.
B002EWD0I6|1.0|I know I'll get a lot of heat for saying this but I found this series boring.  It actually put me to sleep the other night.  I didn't find the storyline or the individuals very interesting. I was so hyped to see it because I usually love all of the BBC period pieces. But this didn't grab me at all.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|First one was way better!!!! And I happen to like Dwayne Johnson and Channing Tatum. Gotta give them credit for the action though but the plot could have used a little work
B002R88G5E|4.0|I have read this author's previous work 'The Kite Runner' set in Afghanistan as well and which I thoroughly enjoyed. His style makes for good reading and I would recommend both books. The only drawback is the reality background in Afghanistan with the appaling poverty, cruelty and injustice which is depicted in both of his books and which for a reader for the  the 'west' is hard to undertand and appreciate. I have lived in Islamic countries and appreciate the credibility of what the author is describing having witnessed some of it first hand. Still I believe he describes events as they occurred in real terms and reflects on the prevailing attitudes. The books give you an insight into life and living in such countries  which should help in understanding the issues being confronted.
1400079276|5.0|To read Kafka on the Shore is to weave through the malleable boundary between reality and fantasy, to meet philosophical prostitute, talking cats, and characters like Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders, to dream of the dialectics of Hegal and the continuous time of Bergson converging with the Oedipal complex, to journey into Haruki Murakami's imagination.<br /><br />I want to know whether Kafka killed his father, whether the librarian was his mother, and whether he was dreaming when he met his mother. I want to know whether Nakata was just fantasizing that he could talk to cats. But as in Murakami's other two novels, The Wind Up Bird Chronicle and Hardboiled Wonderland and the End of the World, reality and dream synthesize into a world that transcends truth or illusion. And Murakami takes us along his wonderland and shows what we too could imagine if we free our minds from the biases, the limits, and the cannots we have accepted as truth.<br /><br />Reality almost seems sterile when we immerse ourselves in Murakami's surrealism. And I invite you to dream along with Murakami on a shore far into the sea of imagination where a song's lyrics echo back into reality.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great way to keep in touch with family and friends !  My grandkids made me joln facebook. We can share pictures too !
B00D2CYU2W|4.0|I was expecting not to like this movie but was proven wrong.  The acting is wonderful.  Michael Douglas is not one of my favorite actors but he totally nails this part.  I also think he was very brave to take on a part that shows his age in some unflattering ways.  Matt Damon was barely recognizable and looked 20 years younger than he is - I think this was a result of his stellar acting along with a masterful makeup team.  I didn't think this was a happy movie but it was well done.  I also got the impression that Scott is making up for the money that he should have gotten in his settlement (which was very small even for the times).
B007N8RULO|5.0|I've AM definitely addicted go this game - I have always enjoyed playing it on my computer.  I find it much more challenging on the Kindle though but hopefully I will catch on to it !
B0085CVT14|5.0|Paper Moon is my favorite movie. I looked for it for years and never could get it till I looked on Amazon.  I bought the DVD.I also bought an instant video for my Kindle.  Little Tatum O Neal  was such a great actress in the movie. I liked it being in black and white .

B000QCS8TW|5.0|I didn't get into this story until I after I watched all 3 seasons of the show. I need to find out what happens next, and so far the book is not disappointing. I am only partially through the first book, but it is way better than the show!<br /><br />Great buy.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|I believe Thom had the correct word. I find that I was saddened by the fates of some of our heroes, but I am pleased by the final note of the Dragon Reborn. I believe the instance of his fate could have been handled more smoothly giving the reader just a bit more of who and/or what the Dragon became. Overall an exquisite end to a most exquisite story
0061906220|5.0|My class loves Pete the Cat,  I took this book on my home visits and they all fell in love with Pete.  They like me to read it over and over.

B0016YBFZ8|2.0|A very cliched look at the appeal of belonging to a Mafia family, its glamour and its violent end.  Plenty of violence.  No point.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|Unfortunately it has a bad bug that won't let you play unless you are logged into the app store. I've even had problems with it not working when there was not internet connection.  That kind of defeats the purpose of having a game on your phone. More stars if they fix it.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This is really well-written. And you will get surprises along the way. I couldn't put it down. I love it.
1594204217|3.0|I love to cook and I've read most of Pollan's other books, all of which have shaped my views on food and the environment. \\"Cooked,\\" however, is just not that interesting and I found myself skimming it towards the end, skipping entire paragraphs of ponderous, overly-wordy writing. It doesn't help that the book starts with a chapter on barbeque, and I don't particularly care about barbeque or grilling. Even the sections where I was very interested in the topics, though - stews, bread, cheese, beer - don't have a whole lot of information or thought that I haven't already found in many other books. Pollan's ideas on the importance of cooking in human history and culture simply aren't that revolutionary right now, and others have written much better about the same topics.<br /><br />If you want a truly engaging, entertaining, passionate and useful book on bread, beer, pickles and countless other ferments, go straight to the source: Sandor Katz's \\"The Art of Fermentation\\" is wonderful and a very good read. For soups, \\"Love Soup\\" by Anna Thomas is my go-to book.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The story was alright.  The ending was abrupt and like the author didn't want to write any more of the story.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Well made, well balanced. Worth every cent. So good I'd pass up many other pc RPGs to geek on this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like this app a lot and to give you a heads up when they say to give an amount of acorns to get into dino land you can just wait to level 35and you will get in for free
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Great game BUT...too many ads in the free and Rovio has cut way back on adding new themes and levels. Looks as if the game will slowly be phased out. I hope not because it really is nice to play different themes games during the seasons.
0525478817|5.0|\\"I believe the universe wants to be noticed. I think the universe is improbably biased toward the consciousness, that it rewards intelligence in part because the universe enjoys its elegance being observed. And who am I, living in the middle of history, to tell the universe that it-or my observation of it-is temporary?\\" -John Green (The Fault in our Stars)<br /><br />This amazing story will bring you to tears. No matter if you never cry, or you rarely cry, you will cry when you read this. This is by far the most amazing book I, and many people I know, have ever read. Maybe it's because it's about cancer patients, and I spend a lot of time around them, or maybe it's just because John Green writes it in a way that you just have to fall in love with these characters. He writes them as such strong people and gives them a purpose in life.<br /><br />The first time I read the book, I couldn't put it down. I read it in one day. It was that good. I had never been like that before, I could always put books down and continue them later, but I felt that if I put the book down, the characters would continue their story without me and I would miss something amazing. So I just read all night.<br /><br />The connection you feel between yourself and the characters is something indescribable. You feel like you're right there with them, going through all the hard times and the feelings of love with them. It's a nice thing to read when your own life is a mess and you need an escape. You get that with this books, and even a few complimentary tears. If you haven't read this book, you are missing out on something amazing. You probably won't die if you never read this, but I couldn't imagine my life without this story. It helped me see things that I never saw before. And I thank John Green for writing this amazing story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of my favorites - great characters - perfect mixture of sad and humorous. It was an easy read but one that I never wanted to put down.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This book outlines a solid and reliable marketing strategy that has given me the renewed focus and motivation to re launch my first novel and finish my second.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I fell in love with Katniss and Peeta almost instantly.  The story line was easy to follow and I had a hard time putting the book down at all if ever.  I think it ended in just the right way, not to suspense full but just enough to make you anticipate the next book.
B000025D7S|5.0|Wonderful gentle mood music.  Both  Mr. Gerwin and Mr. Larry Adler are  GENIOUS'S. Lovely standard unforgettable songs, sang and played to perfection.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is the second movie set in the alternate timeline universe set up by Star Trek in 2009. In many ways Star Trek as a movie franchise is very two dimensional compared to Star Trek as a TV series. After the success of Wrath of Khan in 1982 the movies became a \\"madman bent on destroying the universe\\" of the week exercise. The films in general have little exploration, few philosophical debates and minimal moments of social commentary. They are a huge step above most action films in that the core of Trek remains intact - human kind is moving towards a better future, war is bad, acceptance and tolerance are good and science/logic are the best tools to confront the problems that face the world. However, they are really just dressing for various showdowns of the crew versus the generic (sometimes well-played) bad guy.<br /><br />With the understanding of Star Trek as an action franchise with some sci-fi window dressing in mind, this movie hits almost all the right notes. JJ Abrams is a master at setting a scene and with little or no background on the characters involved he gets the audience to care about the outcome. The opening scene of the 2009 movie was a great example, making Kirk's birth and his father's death a powerful emotional launching pad for the whole re-imagined series. In this film, Harrison's soliloquy (Cumberbatch chews the scenery and it is awesome to watch), Kirk and Spock being reprimanded by Pike and Kirk being comforted by Pike at the bar are some high points that showcase Abrams' quick and effective character strokes.<br /><br />The action scenes are a geek's dream. The Enterprise breaking out of warp (twice!) was visceral as were the scenes of the Vengeance trashing the Enterprise. The chase then fight on the Klingon homeworld bested anything seen in the Star Wars Prequel Trilogy. Khan is given a great physical presence whether proving himself competent in hand to hand combat or his ability to be a still, confident and intelligent menace even behind bars. Finally, the Enterprise falling to Earth was a thrilling set-piece.<br /><br />Star Trek wouldn't be Star Trek without some cringeworthy moments. Old Spock should not have been in this film. The callback to Wrath of Khan in the warp core could have been more different and still given hints and references to the older movie without being a simple reversal. The deus ex machina at the end was obvious and could have been more refined and clever. Also, Spock is too emotional too often.<br /><br />Complaints aside, this was a very enjoyable action movie and it is always fun to see the crew of the Enterprise even if they seem to have had too much coffee in the Abrams version of Roddenberry's creation.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I liked his other books about Frank Bascombe better.  I don't feel the depth here as much.  Also didn't feel as personal.  But I did like it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Greatest app, put everything I need to remember under headings on this app.  Never have to worry about remembering anything again.  Always have the phone on me anyway.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|&#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is one of the few shows to which I would ever give 5 stars. The acting is incredible, and the story lines are riveting.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|The movie, &#34;The Woman in Black&#34;, will undoubtedly become another of our horror classics. Although its story line is simplistic, it has just the right twists and turns, and, of course, unexpected shadows lurking in the right places.
B003B02O3C|5.0|Well conceived, informative story.Grisham illustrates how a competent, bright lawyer can and shoul prepare his cases. The book almost made me want to go back to school.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|I would still say the first one was better. However this one did set up alot of the other early lives of characters that appear later on in the older Star trek days. A definite movie to own
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Unfortunately, I read this book after watching the Netflix series. The series was awesome, great characters, and compelling plot.<br /><br />The book was the opposite - boring characters, and bland plot. Not sure if my review would have changed if I never saw the series.<br /><br />A book to miss - watch it on Netflix and enjoy !
B002ZG99NG|5.0|If your a big fan of Heat and really enjoyed the bank robbery shootout scene well then you will absolutley love this movie. And by no means do you watch this on normal tv speakers. No this movie is made to SCREAM on a surround sound system. Awsome audio
1400069289|4.0|I had intended to read the whole thing after my book club but haven't.  It made me see that I needed to change my habits and gave me an idea of how but not the impetus of doing it.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|I decided to switch back to a corded mouse after my last &#34;cordless&#34; one had so little battery life that it had to stay plugged in all the time to be used.  I liked the features of this mouse and with the price being less than half what I usually pay for a Logitech cordless, I decided to go for it.<br /><br />I've been using the mouse for about a week now and my feelings on it are somewhat mixed...<br /><br />The cord on the mouse is a woven fabric, rather than a smooth USB style cable. It's quite long and the two things combined result in the cable snagging, pulling, and getting stuck on my desk constantly.  I've worked around this by gathering the excess and flipping it forward so it hangs over my lap rather than down the back of my keyboard tray.  Hardly ideal and I'm not sure how long I'll tolerate it.<br /><br />The weight system is an interesting feature. I ended up putting almost all of them in the mouse to give it some heft as it's an extremely lightweight mouse without them. To me, that made it feel cheap. I would rather just have a sturdier product than mess with the weights, but I suppose some people prefer a lighter than air feel, and this would be on the plus side for them.<br /><br />The customization of the buttons is really nice, and it is the best thing the mouse has going for it. You can save several profiles and switch pretty easily back and forth for work or gaming, etc. I did have to hunt down the utility on the Anker website, as the software was not included in the box. And I did have to do some fiddling to get the utility to actually preserve the tweaks I made to the button functions. The first couple times I saved the changes, the mouse reverted back to factory defaults as soon as I closed the program. This is a possible user error situation, but I did find it slightly awkward to use.<br /><br />In short, the mouse works and feels exactly how I want it after adjusting the weight and button functions, but the long snagging cord could end up being a deal breaker.  It may be better suited for my laptop which I use on the table, so the cord wouldn't have the opportunity to hang and snag.
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|I had wanted to read this after seeing Ford on a talk show.  He did so dwell. When the price was lowered, I read it and liked it.  I would say it is a story of crazy characters and triumph.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|The game is very entertaining. Throws me back to some old school games and 5 yr old likes to watch and play.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator has been very useful for class work.  I'm a culanary student, and this has really helped in calculations, recipe adjustments, and pricing.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I originally purchased this second hand for my second child and absolutely loved it! It was very easy to put together. I loved the fact that everything came off so you could clean it. It was a little bit of a pain to get the seat part off at first but once you figure it out it's not too bad at all. The batteries generally lasted a long time. She used it pretty much from when she was about 4 or 5 months old (with a pillow under her feet) until she was 9 or 10 months old (when she was able to walk), but she would still climb in it on her own at times until we got rid of it. It was a great investment and I am hoping to get another one for our next baby who will be here in January!
B000ICXQU6|5.0|I don't know if it was repackaged but there wasn't a scratch on it. It plays just like a new movie. I love the movie Erin Brockovich.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This definitely brings me back to my childhood, and best of all... my kids loved it too! I love being able to find older movies on Amazon that I have not been able to find anywhere else. Definitely a Christmas classic in my book.
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|Try to take your time and aim carefully. Much harder than pc game. Good luck to you! You can get better but it will take practice.
B00E8B1358|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie. Was expecting Channing Tatum throughout the entire movie. He was killed off in the first 5 minutes. Also much cheesier than the original.
140006922X|4.0|Reza Aslan creates a vivid picture of what the time surrounding Jesus was like, the politics, the beliefs,  the reason that the Jewish people of the time were so desperate for a messiah. Such an informative book, presented in such a fascinating way.
B007MNV5WU|3.0|well its an ok game but every update you lose everything my thought is that is don't get it unless free
0062255657|5.0|Excellent book. Neil Gaiman paints the best pictures. His story telling spans across mediums. Even though the book isn't illistrated with pictures, his words create the most beautiful scenes.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|this game is fun and also kinda challenging get it and u will enjoy it I just started and it is awsom
0307352153|1.0|I cannot get past the first chapter, with the whining and complaining about how awful it must be to live in this world as an introvert. Extroverts are loud-mouthed, non-thinkers, who take big risks and are more likely to commit adultry. Really? The author's ego gets involved early and this is a biased book. I'm not a victim and this was written by an educated crybaby.
0896898288|4.0|Patterns were not what I expected.  I expected paper-pieced patterns.  When using the disk, it print one pattern on one piece of paper.  Waste of paper.  The book itself is qualty but was expecting varing directions for making the blocks.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|If you have only ever seen the movie you are shorting yourself. The book has many more trials for Dorothy and her band of travel companions. good for all ages.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|My family and I watch this over and over.<br />I tell her i need my Matrix fix.<br /><br />We will watch the series forward<br />then backwards.<br /><br />I learn new things in the movie constintly
B000QRIGLC|4.0|this book was well written in a style that is easy to read and follow. tells the story of service to our country that few will ever understand.
B00EMJD6TC|2.0|I have seen better movies; save your money and watch Walking Dead. The movie was not what I expected and the previews were the best part of the movie.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|A fun game that keeps you busy and definitely entertained! Not only can I have fun with it, my kids can too!
B00499NHLC|4.0|My wife and I have always liked detective stories and Sherlock Holmes is one of those stories that we love.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Great read!  I have read it twice and throughly enjoyed it both times.  What an interesting way to learn history.  I recently visited Gurnsey and it was fun to see the small chapel, airport, etc. That was mentioned in the book.  Highly recommend it!
B0089LOG02|5.0|As i turned the final page I cried out loud with great disappointment, \\"its over?\\"  As a pastor, i loved this story, it beautifully shows us the importance of making the journey with folks as they review their lives.  Our monthly book club is going to love it!
B002N5N4MG|5.0|My husband loves The Big Bang Theory - so do I.  I bought him all 5 seasons for Christmas.  So much fun. Fast shipping too. Thanks

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Thea Harrison writes a captivating story about Weirs, Faye, Vampires, Elves, and other creatures of fantasies and dreams.  This is the first story that introduces her world and makes you laugh as a Dragon goes after a half-weir thief who has stolen from his lair.

B0019FOC5E|5.0|I got the songs before the CD was even in the mail with the autorip feature that Amazon offers, now I have the songs on my computer, tablet and CD.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I read the other two crossfire books and enjoyed them very much. But this book left me very unsatisfied. It seems like the author was trying to get the book done before the deadline given by her publisher and didn't quite make it. I felt like I was in the middle of the story and then book just ended without a real ending! Kind of like the feeling after sex with no orgasm.
B008XNZMOU|4.0|was what I expected, good songs I play it often, my daughter likes it also. we listen mostly in the car
0316044695|5.0|Full of action. I could not put it down.<br />The first half was about the training.<br />The second half about the mission.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Best game of its kind. Most get borning after while but this has a purpose that makes you want to keep playing the game
0345472322|5.0|This was a life changing book for me. Within an hour of reading this book all my stress disappeared. This book doesn't really tell you what to do. It EXPLAINS your specific thought process and belief that leads to your actions and emotions. Once you understand, you are empowered and in control. Carol Dweck does this in the very first chapters, and then the rest of the book has very helpful examples of how this actually works in different areas of life. Whether it is personal motivation, sports, business, or relationships, Carol shows us that our mindset rules our lives, behaviors and emotions. I'm recommending this to every special person in my life..
B003SPCYP8|5.0|This movie was such an inspiration to me and my daughter. It's lessons are numerous and it will touch your heart - guaranteed !
B004EPZ034|3.0|Bought this for my nephew. He loved it of course. It's amusing the first time around. I think that's enough.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books i have read.  You will laugh, but cry.  If this book does not tug at your heart, you are in a coma.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I'm going to say this first: I love it! I know it didn't get the universal rave reviews that the first remake did, but I'm of the opinion that this was only because the plot was significantly more complicated this time around.<br />But as I stated, I am biased. I've loved the Star Trek world since I was a young child and would watch reruns of The New Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager, and the occasional random original Trek. I firmly believe these reboots are very well done, the plots are great, as is the writing, and the acting is universally good/great. As much as I liked the movies featuring Picard, Janeway, and even the original Kirk, these two reboots are spectacular.<br />I recommend them. Watch Into Darkness at least twice, you'll appreciate it more.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Classic movie....so funny, so weird...would recommend it to anyone with a good sense of humor...never gets old...beetlejuice beetlejuice beetlejuice :)
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I just simply loved this book. Characters which I found so believable,  so easily related to.  Beautifully written honesty involving the raw emotional upheaval we face on a daily basis. Infidelity, passion, despair, it's all here in this account of the lives of a community of people facing their own personal demons as well as those of their loved ones. Bravo
B00371XIJE|5.0|This very sensitive, sweet and realistic film touched me deeply.<br />All of it is very good - the acting, photography, directing, character- and relationship- development.<br />I'm a sucker for a well-done film about animal-human relationships, and this is probably the best I have seen.<br />Above all, we are reminded of impermanence, devotion, kindness and the importance of living a loving life.<br />Well done, Hachi!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I don't know why or how I supposedly 'bought' this, but I don't want it !<br />Even though there was no charge, this is a shady business practice.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|While I only gave an 'OK' rating I am already into the 3rd book in the series.  What I don't like about the books is I feel it promotes cutting.  I feel many young adults will think it is cool to cut themselves.  I also equate the writing to the Twilight series.  The first 2 books were written as if a teenager was writing it.  It is holding my interest and I want to see how things turn out, which I think I already know.
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Really good collection of Donna;s hits and a bonus CD too. Can't beat the price for these memories. Buy it!
B009WO7NQO|1.0|My kindle fire has attempted to download the updated version today (says there are new permissions too) and will not download.  Why must we wait to install the updated versions (correctly) while every other platform has the option without any issues.  Amazon get your stuff together.  And this is not just this app (Plants Vs. Zombies 2 (we still have to wait), Simpsons, we had to wait a long time).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love England in general, but this show is so interesting because it shows a way of life that has historical relevance.  The characters are very real to life and the episodes always leave you looking forward to the next one.  The scenery is phenomenal and since I have been to Highclere Castle it is even more meaningful.  Great show!
0061989142|5.0|I love Lauren Conrad. Her style, blog, newsletter, etc. Never fails to give great ideas to those of us that need a little help. This book is an easy read with tons of beautiful pictures and great tips. I breezed through it.
B002BBJ52U|5.0|This is such a fun movie with some awesome actors and actresses.  Justin long and bradley cooper are the best!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story itself is thought provoking, but aspiring writers will profit from reflecting on the author's technique of character development.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i love this product i just got it and its easy to understand. will update as the time goes on
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun game especially if your sick. Its soooo very fun to look at the different characters an  boards and items/prizes
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I don't mind the apps on top. This is a great app if you want to download vids from the people you are subscribed to on youtube and you are like me who spends an awful lot of time underground waiting for the train to arrive. Every morning before I go to work I download every new video on my subscription service and I'm good for the rest of the day. Back to the point, there are two major functional defects in the latest patch. One is that it doesn't download as fast as it used to even on WiFi there should be a setting to set it as used to work. The second bug in the latest release is that the download one at a time feature is gone or just doesn't work at all anymore. Please fix these two issues asap.
B008EKMB82|5.0|One of my favorite novels of the year! I felt so connected to the characters and empathized with their individual challenges. The author does a wonderful job immersing the reader in the culture of Japan and the island in northwest Canada. I was sorry to have the novel come to an end. Highly recommended!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|If you don't like Tom Cruise, I'd still give this film a try. Amazing visuals help sell a fully realized world. The questions you have will all be answered by the the film's conclusion. Probably my favorite film of 2013.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A fiendishly clever mystery novel. It is not a conventional mystery novel. Totally engrossing, cleverly plotted so that each new development has me astounded and eager to find out what happens next; unfortunately the end was a bit disappointing.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I've played Mahjong many times from different sources. The quick response of this one makes the playing twice as fun!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Great read!  I love the characters!  Better than the movie for sure. I couldn't wait to read the next chapter
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|I bet the bad ratings on this site for this film were done by pharmaceutical companies and the government.  This is an excellent story with a cautionary tale of the endgame of statism and tyranny.  I've owned it for years on DVD still enjoy how well it was done.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the graphics and interface are very good for a free game. however, they may be too good for the lowly kindle fire. have fun if it works on your system though.
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|Great album you can dance to! Appropriate for all ages and a definite must buy. 100% satisfied with my purchase.
B00DQVST76|1.0|All of Madonna's concerts on video since the Confessions tour have been filtered and over edited video wise - Lots of 'video tricks' and cutaways that didn't happen during the actual show and seriously detract from the show. Example, in Confesssions, dancers or Madonna herself seemingly 'melting' down into the stage instead of showing the actual toasters that are used standardly in all concerts when dancers raise and lower from the stage. It's annoying and feels more like watching a fake movie than an actual concert.  I miss the days when HBO would film one of her concerts and it would be released as is although even 'DRowned World Tour' had odd edits like Batman 'POW' and 'BAM' across the screen during Sky Fits Heaven to cover up the slightly botched choreography flying through the air ( it looked great when it originally aired on HBO and didn't need the edit). In short, another over-produced, non authentic product of what could have been a great video....what a shame...the tix were so expensive for this concert and I couldn't see the show from my $375 seat. I was looking forward to this video to see the actual show - sounds like I won't be able to ever see it. I'm opting out of buying this one. Been a Madonna fan since day 1 but really tired of the prices , the nasty diva behaviour and the lazy vocals and crappy videos. Not spending one more penny on this MDNA concert fiasco. Praying the next album and tour are more respectful of the fans financially and attitude wise. We get it, you're 'The Queen'. That doesn't give you free license to just be a b%&Tch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's fun and entertaining. Truly a great game, it gives you that burst of energy that makes you want to continue playing, trying to beat your past high score. Real nice app! (Y)
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought the Blackberry Music Gateway to add Bluetooth to my BMW.  I quickly found the volume was much lower than desired.  This product had good reviews and I gave it a try.  It works as described and was exactly the solution I was looking for.  The audio is high quality - no complaints.  The only downside is that you have to turn it on/off each time you start the car.  It has a rechargeable battery inside for short stops and is USB powered.  I leave it plugged into a 12V to USB car adapter along with my phone charger.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Keep making changes I don't like. Too confusing and hate ads being put on, unwanted. Thinking of changing email. Consider.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|I am fairly new To the Magic community, only playing a few months or so before now. And this was a great way to play.

B00E8B1P9M|4.0|The Rock is in it, as well as Bruce Willis.  So you already know some cool action!  It sucks that &#34;Duke&#34; dies so early in the movie.  I don't remember that in the comic.  Oh well it's the movies.  Now Lady J is a pleasant surprise!  Can't wait till the next one.
B00B7HQ1DA|4.0|I always thought Boz should do more blues. I saw him recently in Bakersfield and he didn't do what he is really good at. Should have done at least half of these songs.
B002SAUCBC|3.0|It is all about a long walk.. but the whole concept is killing people who can't keep up is pretty weird.  Got boring half way through as I didn't see any spectacular ending could be developed.  Will see.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I spend a couple of hours trying to get this to talk to either a Linksys E2000 wireless router or Verizon MiFi 4G router - and no luck with either (despite having iPads, Xbox, Wii, etc working fine with these routers). The setup process was great up until that point - and I like the concept, but as soon as it had a problem with the routers, the error messages were of no help. Apparently it doesn't like 2.4/5GHz routers - or maybe it doesn't like .n routers. Very disappointing.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|This is a straightforward but challenging game. All you have to do is save the bugs from the spiders by cutting the web in strategic places. It's kind of a cross between Cut the Rope and a maze puzzle. I particularly like the fact that this is purely a game of strategy and you're not under any time pressure. I'm not exactly sure how the stars are awarded though - maybe that's based on time - but I don't know. Sometimes you get a \\"better than three stars\\" rating and receive coins as an award. You can use the coins for hints - which are more than hints because they pretty much solve the puzzle for you so I don't use them unless I really get stuck.<br /><br />You also earn achievements. When you go to the achievement page, make sure you scroll down to see all of them. I didn't realize at first that there were more than the two \\"bookshelves\\".<br /><br />I downloaded this game this morning and have been totally addicted. If you like strategy puzzles with cute graphics, don't miss out on this FAOTD.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was thrilling from start to finish.  Loved all of the different emotions it invoked and you never knew what would happen next.<br />Loved it.
B00BJDF8YA|3.0|I thought this was going to be more murder mystery instead of a typical boy/girl who clash at first and then fall head over heels in love story with a 'mystery' tossed in.  The story was pretty far fetched.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B006BQI5ZE|5.0|This movie looks at the Holocaust from a new a very different angle, French complicity and guilt. The book was great, this movie almost as good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much I would play this game all day long I recomemd this game to everybody in the world
B001P36OY2|5.0|The solo anti-hero returns. I loved this movie, it was a great replacement to hold me over until the next Riddick comes out.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Now can we please have a movie to go along with the soundtrack? I hate waiting for the musical to come to town.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book!!!  Books like this are why I read ... to discover the inner lives and outer stories of people with circumstances so different from mine; to gain a better understanding of the human condition.  The book was wonderfully written, it touched my emotions and took me on a glorious ride.

B00DAXYNEI|5.0|This show is addictive. I watch all 13 episodes on two transcontinental flights over the summer and was transfixed. There are not remotely sympathetic characters in this show, but you want to know how each one ends up. Kevin Spacey is great as the ethically challenged, power hungry Congressman. Robin Wright is equally great as his morally challenged spouse. Riveting TV, and I hope there will be a second season.
B0097EWK3A|2.0|This is slow and very frustrating to understand what the next step is in the game., It puts you in a corner with no way out. Maybe I just don't get it. Enjoyed the hidden object part but the mystery detective confused me.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Well, after all the buzz... it wasn't as amazing as I expected. It was a quick and easy read. Definitely eye opening, but nothing to write home about. Maybe the Netflicks show is better.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This is a fun game. It’s a great addition to the family of Angry Birds games and anyone who enjoys the original Angry Birds will enjoy this one.
B000003NA3|4.0|I am huge Coltrane fan.  I absolutely love his music and find him a fascinating historical figure. However,  this just a painful experiment to listen to just as  E. E. Cummings \\"eimi\\" was painful experiment to read.  From the opening of \\"India\\" on disc one this is a chaotic cacophony of notes that a goose being beaten to death could produce. Certainly the composition ends well, I agree with other reviewers that Coltrane was trying to present a joyous progression of notes and honks without fully losing the melody.  Sorry but to my unwashed ears the honks are overwhelmingly sharp and painful and take away from an otherwise brilliant work.  \\"Chasin' the Trane\\" follows and is somewhat more tolerable but it reminds me of my toddler running around with his little wooden recorder just randomly sounding off notes.  The rest of disc one became a blur because the first two compositions were that irritating.<br /><br />After a several hour hiatus I pushed through the later performances.  The effect of the music was better and this disc grew on me but still does not warrant the accolades of the greatest live performance ever.  However it was not annoying like disc one.<br /><br />Discs three and four build on disc two and prevent this series of performances from warranting one or two stars.  And honestly, even a three star rating is not that bad considering the multitude of records that deserve one star or less (every Kenny G record comes to mind).<br /><br />As a whole this record is more of a curiosity to hardcore Coltrane fans.  Calling it the greatest live performance is a wonderful emotional response to quite possibly the greatest jazz musician ever but I just do not  have that strong of a response to this recording.  I greatly favor the live performance of \\"A Love Supreme\\" on the deluxe edition.  In all, this is a good record but not the greatest live performance ever.
B008220DGE|4.0|I will not attempt to add much - the other, more detailed customer reviews that show up as \\"most helpful\\" sum up this film pretty well, and I would agree with what most of the generally appreciative ones say. This is a polarizing piece of cinema. It is a beautifully shot and orchestrated film about decidedly ugly subject matter. There are no heroes, there is no clear resolution, and there is some very graphic content (primarily language and nudity, viewers beware). However, it is extremely interesting, psychologically complex, and exceptionally well-acted and directed (as well as photographed and scored).<br /><br />So if you are predisposed to appreciate this type of film, you will probably like it. I feel that The Master accomplishes what it sets out to do. But if this is for any one of a variety of reasons not in your personal wheelhouse, you will probably find it very repulsive. Which is kind of the point, but again, not for every taste.
B008GWOVOA|3.0|Focusing on the police investigation and on the psychology of the &#34;suspects,&#34; this was certainly an interesting perspective on the abduction theme and, though somewhat lightweight, not a bad job at what it was trying to do.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|I am very impressed with this app. I love puzzles of all kinds, and I am pretty good at them. But these are really challenging me. I particularly like that it is turn-taking and not timed. I need the time to think! I also really like that you can unlock three puzzles at a time if you get three stars. That way I can work on a different puzzle if I get stuck on a certain one instead of having the whole game stuck. That is a terrific idea! I have found no glitches on my Fire HD. Totally recommended!
B00C68JXAW|5.0|I purchased the big James Bond collection Bond 50 last year, but this film was not included. I think it was in error to leave this out of the collection, especially since it was Sean Connery who gave the original face to \\"James Bond.\\" This film was one of the better in a long running series about the British Agent, and is just as entertaining as the others, including the distinctive style and presence that Sean Connery brings to the screen. When I received \\"Never Say Never Again\\", I promptly inserted it into the Bond 50 case under Bonus, to take its rightful place in the collection.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I picked up this book out of curiosity.  Im glad I did.  James and Bob's story will stay with me for a lifetime.
0800141660|5.0|I just love Jane Austen! I enjoy the values and the sentiments. Such an enjoyable way to relax and unwind.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have to agree with the other reviews-the update is horrible.  There isn't one thing about it I like.  One problem is having the ads cover up part of the weather in landscape mode.  I'm looking for another  weather app.  This one is completely unusable!
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Let's face it:  This genre is an excuse for a bunch of the macho guys (and now gals) to get together and have some fun, with us having some fun watching.  The first Expendables was quite a lot better plotted, scripted and dialogued than this one, but number two is still worth an evening if you can suspend disbelief and keep expectations reasonable.
B000HF6XV8|4.0|One has to see, that this tale of over coming all odds and reawakening dead hearts is awe inspiring.  It is a tale of redemption for all involved in the story.  The ability to bring the garden back to life is intimately tied to the characters, in a way,the garden awakening is also a call to the characters to let light back into their lives and let love revive their lives.  Simply a charming movie, it never gets old, like Peter Pan!
B00DP3IESY|5.0|This is one of the shows I've watched a few times.  If not but for it's cinematography.  The director did well, the action is good and suspense rating up there at a 3 on a 5 scale.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|This book provides a simple framework with far reaching benefits to anyone wishing to understand or change any aspect of their emotional disposition or behavior. It is written in a clear pragmatic style that contrasts favorably with the obscure, overly complicated and professionally mystifying styles of most academic articles in this field and it provides a very useful lens for many professional practices.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I had this movie and gave it to my daughter when she moved out, so this is a replacement. I just really enjoy the characters and their relationship with one another, the values and the sentiment. Classic.
B0044E9LW6|5.0|One of the greatest guitar players whose life was cut short, this is a great live album. Well worth listening to for the genius of guitarist Dio.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When I finished this, the 3rd and final book in the Hunger Games series, I looked up from the last page and just said &#34;wow&#34;.  It was a comment for the entire story.  I have to admit I originally read all three books, or should I say devoured them rather quickly, just because I couldn't wait to read what happened next.  I very rarely reread books but I have since reread theses and still am moved by the story even after reading them 4 times. This installment is the escalating of the Districts' uprisings and beyond.  Its still very much Katniss' story but also fills in the other characters' lives well.  I didn't feel left hanging over any character's tale. Very satisfying.  I was there with Katniss and company trying to make their way to, then through, the Capitol.  I know I expected to smell blood and roses whenever President Snow was near.  I had strong reactions to the new characters introduced.  I felt I was in the middle of the fighting and was shocked with the primary central battle.  In other words, I felt transported right there with the characters wherever or whatever they were a part of.  Wonderful storytelling.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|....last was better though....it had a bigger number of hits.  Still it had several memorable songs that will keep people engaged.
B003RWSF6Y|5.0|Informative book and easy to read and navigate.  Recommend it for people who want to check out card meanings during tarot spread.
0316056863|4.0|tiny fey shows the reader a good time in bossypants, i really enjoyed reading this book and I think you will too fan or not
B00364K6YW|5.0|I just love Jane Austen! I enjoy the values and the sentiments. Such an enjoyable way to relax and unwind.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|found it boring, trite in the style of writing, was hard to hold my attention, and not creative enough so
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Well written story about how everyone's lives are intertwined. Keeps you captivated to the last. Definitely reconnect this for a great read!
B00BLCHYKU|1.0|Although hopes are raised by some parts of the opening episode, rather like the opening of Gladiator, the episode and the series rapidly discards its potential for excellence and becomes a humdrum piece of nonsense.  Reminiscent of Nicholas &#34;one expression&#34; Cage, the lead actor does little except adopt his Blue Steel face and look knowingly heroic and invincible through the rest of the series of implausible confrontations, illogical  plot sequences and anachronistic feminist episodes.  They may have got the haircuts right but the larger representation of the Viking style and culture is laughably misunderstood and misrepresented by standard plot mechanisms that could be transported to any age,such as the lone hero/Roman/detective/office worker who stands up to the one-dimensional evil boss/lord/king/Caesar, while supported by the strong woman and the loyal side kick, proving others wrong at every turn and always being right in his single-minded and, again. one dimensional righteousness.  Abnormally disappointing.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A game you can't put down.  But waiting for game to charge interrupts the rhythm of the search.  Don't worry it's worth it ......
044661758X|4.0|enjoyed this book, not the best by this author but still a very good read and is not boring at all
B00ET7EON4|5.0|Agree with the majority of the reviewers.<br />A mashup of styles which still manages to retain the underlying indie rock beat and vibe.<br />Hard to say yet which of the tracks stand out, they're all simply that good.<br />This is a great album, certainly more than enough to justify hitting the &#34;buy&#34; button.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I just wish yall could let us get some more diamonds and maybe a 4 lottery maybe it a daily
B009B1UZ7C|2.0|A little too country for me. Still love his voice. Liked him on the Graham Norton show and the song he sang
B000H4TX9I|4.0|Firefly and Serenity are great series for those that love action, adventure, and sci-fi fantasy. Kind of a space cowboy set in outer space and various planets
1423101502|5.0|&#34;I can't stop reading it over and over and over and over and over again!&#34; - My thirteen year old daughter
B000RO0ONW|5.0|After reading conflicting information online about whether or not this disc would work in the US, I took a chance.  I can confirm that it works exactly the same as the US version, which I owned previously but let get away.  I have not tried Team Fortress, but I can't imagine there being any problem with it since the rest works.<br /><br />As for the game, it is classic.  In my opinion, Portal outshines the Half-Life portion, but both are worth your time.  If you have played Portal 2, this is worth the $20 to have imported just to play the first Portal.
075669812X|5.0|Bought this for my son for his birthday and he absolutely loves it!  Quick shipment and much cheaper than the Big Box stores were selling it!
B005KQVDH8|2.0|I've never posted a review on Amazon before, but I had to say something on this one. I was maybe 22 or 23 when this movie came out, but I never saw it (nor really knew too much about it for that matter). Finally, at 49-years-old, and after reading all the hype about The Goonies, a couple night ago I sat down and watched it with my wife (who loves this movie). Well, I was stunned! I couldn't believe how bad this movie was . . . I couldn't see past the \\"cuteness\\" - it was just plain STUPID!; not to mention annoying at times. The little fat kid \\"Chunk\\" was so annoying for the first 30 minutes or so of the film, that it was all I could do not to get up and leave the room. I normally like adventure movies and can usually suspend my disbelief in order to digest a movie for what it's supposed to be; but from an adult's perspective, \\"The Goonies\\" is a real turkey. Yes, it would probably be enjoyable for ages 6 to 12 (although there's probably inappropriate content for ages 6 to 10, so that really doesn't leave too much of a viable audience).<br /><br />Just for comparison's sake, a couple months ago I also watched \\"Adventures in Babysitting\\" (a film from the same era) for the first time and I really enjoyed it. I also love \\"The Sandlot\\", and \\"Holes\\" was pretty good too from what I remember.
B002R0F3Q2|1.0|This is a gift and was delayed..I buy a lot from amazon and I think the shipping for the most part is good but I hate that it had to be a gift that was late
B0026O475M|5.0|Tom Hanks proves his dramatic acting flair in this very suspensful drama.  I enjoyed it all the way through.  I appreciate getting this on my computer because we only have one theatre in town, and not the best movies even then.  The writing, photography, acting, all top notch.
B0051SDM5Q|4.0|Getting to Yes is very helpful for those of us unfamiliar with negotiating tactics.  The book is easy to read and understand, short and sweet.
B006X40MUU|4.0|this is a wonderful book, by Michael Pollan. Omnivore is an critter that eats meat, fish, grain and herbs; that's us folks. And the dilemma is what do we put into our bodies daily? There is so much in this one book for anyone raising food meat products or for anyone who eats such things. I would love to see such a farm start in my home town in Colorado.<br /> In the book he talks about food production from farm to family. A third of the book is devoted to corn and the over production of it in America and the world. Corn is used in everything. High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) is an ingredient in almost everything we ingest today. In our highly industrialized world we consume copious amounts of chemicals, pesticides and petrochemicals in the processed foods we eat. Calves are weaned early, rushed to feedlots, bulked up quickly and reduced to cellophane wrapped packages as quickly and most cost effectively that is humanly possible. He explains how Iowa farmers raise two things, corn and soybeans. It also powers our vehicles.<br />He also writes about alternative farms where every nuance of sustainability is extensively calculated for the maximum cooperation of grass, cows, manure, chickens, compost, and processing which is choreographed by what he calls a \\"grass farmer\\". The land is not over grazed but is alive as a living organism. Cows eat the grass, drop manure, the chickens pick out the grubs and bugs, drop nitrogen rich manure, which grows more grass. The owner moves his animals daily to get the best out of the land and the animals.<br />The last section is the forest, where we find wild game, wild herbs and mushrooms and stream caught fish. Unfortunately he goes into a lot of evolution, sometimes on every page for several in a row. Occasionally he mentions millions of years. (Yes, I am a God fearing, six-day creationist) He also goes in the ethical reasons for not eating meat, including many references to other writers that are vegan or vegetarians and philosophical writers on racism, human-animal comparisons in death, etc, etc. this section, to me, was the least appropriate and least educational, but rather indoctrinal in content. Finally I got to the part where he is going hunting for a wild animal, which I can relate to, being an avid hunter myself. I am a creationist and God gave us dominion over the animals and after the flood of Noah's time, we were given the right to eat certain animals. I'll leave the results of the hunt concealed for your perusal. He does elaborate on his emotions concerning his hunting trip, relating everything to the transcendence of the animal to human being. As I said, it's very evolutionary. I believe he thinks we evolved from animals so to kill one is liken to killing an ancestor. I think we are made in the image of God and completely separate from the animal world, thereby having dominion and able to use them as a food source.<br />I didn't think it possible to be so engrossed in a book about food but Mr. Pollan has done a yeoman's job of detailing the various subjects. I think you will enjoy the book given the amount of research and effort he has done to write it.
B000002ADT|4.0|I have always admired Miles for breaking his addiction by locking himself in a room and giving orders for no one to open the door until he had experienced detox.  How a man could be so calm and cool absolutely amazes me.  I only gave him four stars because I had already given Duke five.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Like the game but would rather hear brass bells or gongs instead of French horns for the music to accompany this ancient and traditional Chinese game!
B000099T2L|1.0|This is a gift and was delayed..I buy a lot from amazon and I think the shipping for the most part is good but I hate that it had to be a gift that was late
B00F35BV64|5.0|In JJ Abrams' previous Trek they managed to create a whole new timeline so they could &#34;re-start&#34; the Trek Universe.  Excellent job with that.  Like his previous film, this one's just as great.  As far as I'm concerned, they're both the best Star Trek films of all time.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like the game, but my gems keep disappearing. I just went from 19 gems to 9 gems when I only spent one gem, so I gave up on this game. This may be a glitch or not, because they go away every time I try to save them for Rarity. Just last week I played and went from 23 gems to 0.<br /><br />Gameloft, THIS MUST BE YOUR DOING. STOP IT NOW. MORE BITS AND LESS PREMIUMS. SO QUIT IT.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|KICKING myself because I was too fast on the draw and paid $8.99 for the MP3 when I could have brought the CD for $9.99 and got the MP3 for free (at least that was Amazon's special last night).  It's been a lllooooonnnngggg time since I wanted a CD just so I could read the liner notes... This one makes you wanna read the liner notes!  Makes you wanna know who played what instrument on what song, and who sang this or that note.  Janelle is a Bad Chick..... period.  Been loving this girl since Metropolis..... Arch Android was my theme album.... I expected her to DELIVER ON THIS and she did not disappoint.  Problem is.... I'm stuck on the 1st 3 duets and CANNOT stop heavily rotating those 3 to enjoy the rest of the album..... My hands down faves are #1) Janelle and Prince, #2)Janelle and Solange, and #3) Janelle and Badu..... I love Janelle and Badu FOR REAL.... thought they would be number 1 for me, but Prince claims EVERY ounce of his space with her.... they are soooooo good together!  When you hear Janelle one minute you're hearing a young Michael Jackson, next song you're hearing Marvin, next song it's Sly and the Family Stone, next song she sounds like Lauren Hill, or Stevie Wonder, then she had the nerve to throw the Beatles in there.....  and EVERY song she ALWAYS sounds like Jimi Hendrix, at the same time you always \\"hear\\" JANELLE!  Love the Overture's....she goes from Trouble Man to The Price is Right with the Overture's....continuing on that Cindi Mayweather chase!  Power Up is hilarious!!! This is the most creatively artistic lady on the scene today besides Badu.... she needs to be making Lady Gaga money but ignorance does not compute (did I just mention both of their names in the same sentence?... blech and double blech!!!!)  Loving what she does with Rock and Roll (same thought pattern as Mike's \\"Remember the Time\\"), Ghetto Woman (I hear you Stevie Wonder) and Sally Ride and Dorothy Dandridge Eyes.... Janelle is a Bad Chick.... buy this.... now.... today!!
B00000IMYA|5.0|I have come to appreciate Jazz over the past several years.  I have always been curious about the life and music of Duke Ellington.  I bought this album used some years ago.  It gave me an appreciation of the work, his standing by Jimmy Hodges when being Gay could get you killed, playing to keep an band together, even though no one seems to want to hire you.  It was this man who took his group to Newport and revived his career.  The original I lost, so the new one with even more tunes from the Festival has become a treasure.
0307245306|5.0|This is a very good product. It would be even better if there was a title page outlining the various chapters. Overall I am very satisfied with this product.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game so much that I could die for it and I really really mean it. Peace out.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Cool app! I recently started school after a long hiatus and this app is just great. The app is easy to navigate. I use the app quite often and its very reliable. I also downloaded the Fractions Calculator Plus Free too. Great tools!!!
B009NX409M|1.0|I really like Robert De Niro and Meryl Streep, but I hated this movie. It was long and boring and didn't make much sense.
1611761808|5.0|This is more about families than Afghanistan, but it is still good. It helped that the audio book had three voices.
B000002AGN|4.0|Dave Brubeck has always been a hero because he insisted all of his musicians could stay at the hotel where they were providing the music.  In his early years exclusive venues did not allow blacks to stay in their hotels.  Brubeck said: &#34;No lodging here, and I don't play here.&#34;  He helped break the back of segregation.  As for the music I have always wanted to have copy of his quartet playing Take Five.  His rendition did not disappoint me.  I gave him four because I gave the Duke five.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|the 3D is outstanding and the HD is mind blowing...this is what movies were ment to be..If you've got a 3D system then you know the WOW....Its a 10 star rate by me..
B0090XO57C|5.0|Very satisfied. You get exactly as it is advertised. Really amazing to see all of the uniqueness of God's creation up close
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved it best book ever, I want to meet Mr grey in real life. The whole series is so great
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Sit back an enjoy the scary, but fun, ride! I can hardly wait for season 9!!! Don't know else to say.  Good luck!
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I wish this series was continued and woven into the later Dr Who seasons. Captain Jack is an unforgettable character.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Good acting and story.  I saw this movie back when it first came out and enjoyed it.  Better movie now for me now that I've been to Thailand and have seen the Bridge (replacement) on the River Kwai.  This was not filmed in the actual location but looks very similar to the area where this story happened.  Worth watching!
B008ROF114|4.0|I ENJOY Webster's ontologies and books. This was a good story. John Wayne has been a favorite actor of mine.
0062239422|5.0|Terrific book; scary, suspenseful, and generates many emotions. The exposure of Lee's dark side was superbly timed; little at a time, but with an impact. You ached for Cathy, feared for her, and began to dislike her friends intensely. We all have a friend who can't see past a handsome face until it is too late. Cathy tried to escape but, well I won't give it away. The ending is fitting; Cathy exacts her revenge in as subtle a way as the dark side of Lee's nature was systematically introduced.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence at her finest.  Gripping movie with amazing animation. I couldn't stop watching.  Action was just completely  and utterly phenomenal.
B001NLKXK2|3.0|Reads like a documentary. If you don't know anything about Alzheimer's, then read this book. You will find out about how it feels to live with early onset Alzheimer's and how it's like to live with someone who had it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I always expected this to be a good book when I saw people talking about it all the time but I never got around to it to recently. It takes a lot or a book to make me cry but you know, this book had me sobbing for like an hour. Just just the feels were too much. This is an amazing book it's just brilliant I highly recommend it!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|GREAT book, to short, so many aspects and avenues that the reader could have gotten lost in, such a fantastic writer.  another story about the Hempstock family would be wonderful!!!!!
B00321GTJU|5.0|A visual feast to be enjoyed by all ages - even our Corgi watches this stunning series. One of the best documentaries. Ever.
B004X75RK4|5.0|So funny! Love Sandra Bullock! Fun girl movie. Must see will see again on girls night. Five stars. Go see it
B005UKK4Y2|3.0|Unfortunately the language and junior high school humor take away from the movie, rather than add to it.<br />The premise of the movie was good and the situations could have been much funnier, if the potty mouth<br />language wasn't so distracting.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this movie, but I really ended up liking it, including my son! It's adorable and heartwarming and funny!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great app! Works fast on my kindle and smartphone. Pictures load quickly and with bright color. Fun and addicting app!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Having seen Avengers 2 in thee theatre, I wanted to see the movie that preceded it.  I loved the characters and the action in this film.

B00AKKGX4W|5.0|Potato chip author: an author who produces fun, enchanting romance novels you can't put down and just can't get enough of.<br /><br />I can now officially say that Courtney Milan will be joining my potato chip authors list!  I'd poked at this book about three times, reading and re-reading the Kindle sample but inevitably moving on to another book instead for fear I might not like it because some of the other reviews had me worried.  I'm SO GLAD I chose to give this novel a shot!!  Engaging, funny, touching, and all around thrilling, I finished this book in just a few hours and will most certainly be checking out the other Brothers Sinister novels, and Courtney Milan novels in general.  Keep up the great work, Courtney! :)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Played the game for an hour then went to work, played a bit more then had tea, I update the game when I have spare time and now I think I can give sir Allen sugar a run for his money.

B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Entertainingly written and covering some of the main energy theories. However, I had only marginal success with the experiments, It's possible I didn't focus as intently as I could have.
B004HD61KE|5.0|James Rollins has brought us yet another action packed thriller.  Read it I guarantee you won't be disappointed. I love the Sigma Force characters.  Not only are they great warriors but Rollins brings out their softer side as well.

B006GKHE6G|4.0|Love the concept, graphics and I love racing games. This one has one major flaw - the water is waaaaaayyyyy to choppy!!  It's almost impossible to keep your craft in the water, even on the easy level. Not only is the gameplay difficult the constant motion makes me sick. Vector Unit Inc needs to correct this and if they do they'll have a winning game on their hands.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This guide has been invaluable in getting me started on my Ebook publishing adventure. Very easy to follow instructions with good visuals, too. Thanks to whoever helped write this guide!
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|In the corporate quest for the almighty dollar which supports their ultimate goal of power and greed who are the sheep?
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|It's not the most swooshable but a very faithful recreation of an iconic vehicle. The build was easy enough for my six-year old to follow and complete. Minifigs have special prints but no new custom molds. We also get printed bricks and tiles - hurrah for no stickers.<br /><br />It does come with flaws though: no room for two minifigs inside, parts easily detaching, awkward hood. But with a little creativity these can be addressed to give a fun little set. I paired this with a custom VW van and my kid hasn't stopped recreating that mall parking lot scene (\\"The Libyans!\\").
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I watched the video then got the book because I wanted more detail.  The whole moderate fasting a couple times a week makes total sense to me.  I tried it for five weeks and did loose eight pounds.  I am not over weight by normal standards, so was elated with those results.  The most important aspect, is not over eating the day after the fast.  Will re-read this book over and over again just to keep me on track when it comes to health and eating.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|This is a musical set in the 50's and the music is of that time.  The movie is good, the songs and music are great.  And to make it better not a single *(%%$)## or F-bomb at all.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Good quality like the remastered version. Original good but remastered better. I would recommend to anyone who enjoy Star Trek.
0307352153|4.0|Don't buy this book for neuroscience, or psychology, or personality theories discussed - to be blunt, it doesn't pass muster even for a pop-science read.<br /><br />What it does is deliver, however, is a very persuasive, strong, yet counter-currently-cultural message that it is normal, healthy, and even advantageous (sometimes) to remain an introvert if that's what you are born as.<br /><br />This is a highly therapeutic read to the 1/4 of the population that are introverts.
B000062YB1|5.0|If it were released today then it would still be a classic. It has stood the test of time immensely well.  The title track is one of my favourites.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|This rather generic set - sorry Eomer - may be the best in the LOTR line pound-for-pound. We get six minifigs with highly detailed prints and weapons, a small but functional fort, and a good-sized siege engine; it's a rather 'busy' set for its size and price. This got some extended play from my six-year old even before pairing it with Helm's Deep.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|Very useful app.  Great place to keep your list of bills.  Would be better if the User guide had better details. Would have given it five stars if there was a way to restore a bill you in error showed it as paid.  there are only 2 options; review biils paid or waiting to be paid.
B007REV4T8|5.0|We have always liked the Bond movies and this one ranks up with the best. The links back to the early days of Bond  were a tie in to the series also. This one will be watched several times.
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Have to be disciplined not to read in one session. Terrific, exciting hard to put down, want more from Terry
1439153663|4.0|The Kitchen House has so many good reviews I had to pick it up.  It is easy to read and there is no shortage of well developed characters.  However the writing left something to be desired from my perspective.  It is a bit unpolished - otherwise this is at least a 4 star novel.  In some cases, the old adage \\"show don't tell\\" would make the difference.<br />  One cannot argue with success however, so as a new novelist myself I must congratulate K. Grissom on the popularity of her debut.  The research (and she is not even a southerner!) and story-telling can't be faulted - thus I will be looking for her next novel.<br />By C.Crabbe MacKinnon, the author of A Place in the World
B001TXWJ4M|3.0|Hanging in there with each episode. I've been told the characters storyline and personalities build in season 2 and explode in season 3& 4. I'm waiting
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Loved all the plot twists, and especially the character Julianna M. plays.  She's not caving in to her husband after his dalliances, and shows concern for the individual when counseling her clients.  She has that vulnerable, yet tough personality.  She reflects before she acts.  I'm watching season 2 now.  Plots are much more complicated.  Characters are less predictable.  You can't be sure about how any one of the major characters is going to act. Sometimes the degree of complication seems a bit too much -- all the last minute discoveries, etc.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|A Mcqueen Classic.Must have.Must see.Must see again and again.Saw it first time long a go.Still a thrill.So buy it if you like racing.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Loved the movie, loved the music, the dancing, the singing, especially the plot. I listen to it quite often.  I highly recommend it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|You will be addicted to it if you are into Greek Gods and great stories about epic battles for power.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This show is amazing! If you've never seen the classic Doctor Who, it's okay, this new ramp up is easy to follow and easy to immerse yourself in. I still get goosebumps when the opening credits and theme song are played. If you aren't a Whovian after the 4th episode, you have no sense of imagination.
B003AYMZO2|4.0|Really gets you to want  to see more. Compelling, this season builds the characters personalities. Story lines have become intriguing
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Alarm works great. I like that there are so many options when setting the alarms. I have had no problems and would definently recommend it to family and friends.
B00A429YF6|3.0|I thought it would be a better quality film.  There was too much brightness and I do not know how to adjust on my little player..don't have my T.V. set up for dvd's yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its the best game you can play everybody should play it cause after you play it once you stuck on it for ever
B00425S1H8|5.0|Plugged it in and it worked.  the software I was using for another applications picked it right up so I did not need to load the driver which was included.  Very happy.
B000FC2OHA|5.0|love this book bought the teen version for my son as I think he will also benefit from this book!!!
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|the bast deniro movie ever... and pesci was  amazing ..  the best part is  it is a true story...  what more can i say
B003VANOFY|1.0|These headphones wouldn't even register as connected to my PC. I tried for hours on support forums and finally gave up.<br />Gigantic waste of money.
B000AJIF4E|3.0|For the amount of money I spent on these I guess I expected a little more. Start off, I hate the way the collapse.<br />People say they don't hurt after they've been on your head a while.... yes they do!!<br />Sound is average with most other headphones in the $20 to $40 dollar range.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so addicting can't put it down... one more run one more run one more run one more run one more run one more run.
B008PZZYB2|4.0|Very funny and satirical. Good chemistry and cameo appearances keep things interesting. Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson paired up for Another great film.
B00ESY77LO|4.0|such a great remodel of this classic!  the actors chosen were perfect and they played their roles well!  well done
B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie is so hilarious, it's filled with fun, laughter, twists and turns! It's guaranteed to keep you and your child's attention the entire time from start to finish!
B0055QYKQO|3.0|The board I got had 2 bad memory slots. Also when my computer goes to sleep and I try to wake it back up, it constantly beeps. When this happens I have to shut the power supply off completely, otherwise when I turn it on it will beep and not boot.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|It's p good, buy it. Like, for real. It's almost as good as the TV show but with less boobs on screen.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|The albums are great...the sound is great...and the price is way less than trying to buy all these albums separately.
B005XUC398|5.0|Good story with good actors.  About the wall street crash and how the brokers deal with it.  Good tension and suspense.  I would recommend this as a good movie that keeps your attention.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|this is the best game ever.I play it 2 hours a day and have 3500 shields.I also have 5689 bananas.I have been playing minion rush I was about 4 years old. this is why this game is awesome.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This movie is much closer to the comic book character. No cutesy catch phases. No comic relief. No getting the female judge at the end. And most of all no \\"I knew you'd say that\\".<br />If your a fan of the Judge Dredd comics then I would recommend this film.<br /><br />Judge Dredd the man.<br />He is the law.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|Been waiting for the chance to purchase this, it was in excellent condition and I love it. Great for exercise music.
B005OT2YVA|1.0|Everything is wrong here. Never see this. Not only is it terrible- it also is around three hours. Do anything else for three hours.. stare at a wall.. stare at the ceiling.. poke yourself in the arm.. just don't watch this movie.
B00APUTEBG|4.0|Although I don't recall ever seeing Henry Cavill before in the movies with Bruce Willis, I feel he has done a wonderful job playing Bruce's son in this movie.<br />The only I feel would have made the movie better is less cursing.<br />Otherwise, well done Henry!<br />Well done!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|The trailer for this movie almost prevented me from watching it.  The movie has a pretty good story and is basically a detective type story.  There is action but it does not overwhelm the movie.  I would recommend it as a good action flick.  Don't for deep meaning though.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We were behind the curve on starting to watch Downton Abbey and wondered what the fuss was about. It's so well written. It's a great escape. The writing is incredible, storyline engaging and characters worth caring about. It's delightful.
B0098QBEXO|4.0|I enjoyed the plot line & the story telling. Foreign cinema always brings an introduction of culture & different euphemisms. This movie is chock full of fun & variety.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|I liked it better than the critics.  Definitely one to watch more than once.  Tied 6 stories together into a single movie.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Ease of use! now you can view all u tube has to offer in your kindle. no need to get to a computer or laptop to get what you are looking for while using your kindle.
B00BP4XDNQ|5.0|Shindler's story retells the holocaust's horror with a twist Of hope for the Lucky group that was able to survive the relentless and inhuman depravity Of the third Reich. The long, black and white (except for the symbolic orangeish girl) movie, is riveting from begining to end.
0399159347|4.0|Throughout this novel, one wonders whet one would do if confronted by a similar dilemma that drives the plot. You find a sealed letter from your spouse labeled \\"to be opened in the event of my death\\" Cecilia, the heroine is torn between curiosity and loyalty. There are a number of other side plots that detract to some extent the path to the novel's finale. Of course she opens the envelope and the letter reveals some totally unexpected content. The author took a lot of care in growing and maturing her characters. Ultimately, three women's lives are interwoven as they share similar problems (men, children etc.) even though they are very different from each other.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I've read many of the reviews before deciding to take a chance on this purchase. I'm so glad I did. This movie is authentic. No scratches or fake/replica codes. Everything works perfectly.
B000HL2J0G|2.0|Maybe it's the nostalgia talking, but I remember the television series from the late Eighties. Each episode was imaginative and cleverly written. MacGyver's inventiveness for getting out of seemingly impossible situations was always unique but within the realm of possibility.<br /><br />The new MacGyver, at least in the first episode, was simply ridiculous. I was not motivated to watch further.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I bought this processor with the intent of overclocking it. Currently, It's running at 3.8gHz and idles at a temp of 28-30c. It could easily handle quite a bit more.
B0013E5HEG|5.0|Again, top notch finish and quality. Safe for smaller children.<br /><br />Well done Schleich!<br /><br />If you're building a collection of animals, this is a must have! King of the jungle.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I saw Madonna perform this show live in Saint Louis and was blown away by the shows incredible visuals, diverse set list(yes Madonna does have a career that spans beyond the 80's),and high energy!! Madonna opened her heart,Justified her love, Vogued, Expressed herself,got down Like a virgin and Like A prayer,while dancing effortlessly for two hours straight. So i was totally confused when several people were slamming M simply bc she didnt play enough\\"old Madonnna\\", still us real fans felt the show was a very good mix of a 30 year span, I think M played at least one song from every album she has released,which is somewhere around 15 or 16. With all that being said I was again in disagreement with all the bad reviews on amazon regarding the blu ray/dvd. I've had no issues or problems with sound or visual quality on my Tv or blu ray player,The show has a crystal clear view on my screen. I think you have to have your television and disc player set up to HD quality, or maybe a newer model of your disc player, whatever the case, I loved the Show and Love The dvd quality! Madonna is and always will be The Queen of Pop!
B004I7IPL2|2.0|I am a SAW fanatic and was disappointed at the outcome of the movie! The beginning was not real. I'm sorry I would not recommend this movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I have had the chromecast for about 2 weeks now and although I was very enthusiastic about the idea, I have not been having a great experience with the product so far.  It seems like the only services that work well-ish are Netflix and YouTube (Although, I have been having trouble with Netflix when trying to cast from my mac but works fine on my tablet and iPhone.)  If you want to play local content from your computer, you have to deal with all sorts or home brew solutions(some work better than others but none are perfect) or cast your entire desktop and then you have a reduced frame rate which is noticeable and mildly distracting.  Also, if you cast your entire desktop to play local content, the audio comes out through your computer instead of your tv speakers and there is not much support out there to figure out how to make it work.<br /><br />The product itself is solid but the software and firmware are half baked at best and have caused hours of research to try to make it work the way I wanted it to.  Chromecast is about as far away from Apple's motto of \\"It just works\\" as you could possibly get.  It works but you gotta figure it out yourself to get some good use out of it and so far it has been a pain to deal with.  It has potential though, once some decent firmware/software comes out or people come out with plugins and stuff that let you play local content without issues.  I am pretty disappointed in Google for releasing this products with so many unresolved kinks.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book goes way beyond any romance books I've ever read. While exploring an unknown world, I realized I was exploring my own sexuality, even as I was sometimes repulsed by the dark world Christian inhabits. I can fully understand how Ana falls for this beautiful, dark man.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|If you are a fan of Star Trek these movies are great to have in your library. They are nice to have so you can watch them in sequence with the family and with popcorn. family nite in.
B000CDO330|5.0|A very sturdy and strong toy animal for children. Safe for younger kids.<br /><br />The build and finish quality is excellent. Well done Schleich!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I am already a big fan of Downton Abbey. The storylines are great, especially how the lives of the 2 classes intertwine. Looking forward to Season 4!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|for something described as a &#34;zombie drama&#34;, The Walking Dead is a cinematic experience with every episode. The amount of effort put into this show is evident.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|Its diferent And the end  left you with your mouth open inmediato y you want to read the second book
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Not having Star I was so glad to be able to get the whole series on DVD. Very bloody but couldn't wait for the next episode
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I had heard that this movie wasn't very good. I knew I was going to get it anyways to have with LOTR's. I am glad I did. I enjoyed the movie very much and am waiting for second part to come out. It goes to show that you should always make your judgements and not go by others.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This was indeed a lazy work by Grisham. Not stimulating, but rather an easy read. Not worth the hardcover or paperback price, but the kindle price was ok. Grisham will need to do better next time.
B003MXAQJW|5.0|The story and the characters are so dysfunctional, but it worked out wonderfully. I loved all the characters - even the horn on the van that won't stop honking.
B003Z49LYO|1.0|If you want to watch a movie and in the end feel depressed, this is it.  Terribly tragic story-line.  This film is not family-friendly.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Some levels are tough but enjoy that it makes you think.  Sometimes need pen and paper to keep track of numbers-patterns-colors.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I never got to watch it from the beginning so I was so glad I had the opportunity now.  Very upset at the loss of Finn(Corey)  What a loss to the show.  Hope they can survive. it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is smart- the characters complex and very real.  The setting is beautiful.  A true reflection of what might have been.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. There were parts that were a little slow but the action was great! Robert Downey Jr. never fails to make you chuckle with his little jokes here and there! Loved it and hope there is another just as good.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before I bought this and many were complaining that Ozzy just didn't have the vocal range of times past.  You know what, I don't care.  This album rocks!  It reminds me of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath and Album 1.  Highly recommended!!
0066620996|3.0|It's smooth, it's pleasant to hear, and it's easy to read, like an entertaining pop song.    There's nothing wrong about the concept ideas of how to build great company. It tells you about the right mindset, what NOT to do, and frequent mistakes. The concept of what Good-to-Great companies do is revealing and substantial, the challenges of common beliefs in management:    \\"There is no evidence that the good-to-great companies spent more time on long-range planning than the comparison companies.\\"    or    \\"The good-to-great companies had no name, tag line, launch event, or program to signify their transformations.\\"      But in order to make the book simple enough, he had to round out many real life complications, whatever doesn't fit the preconceived framework had been omitted;    \\"When you have disciplined people, you don't need hierarchy.  When you have disciplined thought, you don't need bureaucracy.  When you have disciplined action, you don't need excessive controls.\\"    Sounds good, but i think it is too optimistic and too simplified.    The popularity of the book is overwhelming. He know the audience well---every businessman want to build great company---he invented many memorable catchy phrases, having all the explanations for frequently asked questions.    The simplicity and marketing make this book accessible to mass audience, which explain why millions of copies are sold.    One obvious bad decision is trying to link 'good to great' with 'built to last' in the last chapter. The author tried too hard to link the two together and make it somewhat the Grand Theory, which, if successful, will be invaluable, but it is not.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My kindle was never charging .  I would keep it plugged in overnight and it would not charge,  now it is working fine
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautiful story about kids being kids with something extra to contend with. It should change a reader's perspective on what's important in life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's pretty addictive and the graphics are better than average. I always look<br />forward to the next opportunity to play.<br />I definitely give this one 5 stars.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I HAVE ORDERED SEVERAL PUZZLES THAT KEEP FREEZING OR SHUT DOWN.<br />I LOVE THE PUZZLES BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO CORRECT THE PROBLEM. I THOUGHT MAYBE I HAVE TOO MANY PUZZLES. BUT DON'T KNOW HOW TO DELETE THE OLD ONES.<br />THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.<br />PEGGY CANNON
B00BEU19ZU|4.0|I like that fact that I can see any airport map from this app and it keeps all of our flight itinerary at our fingertips.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|As I write this 2012 has passed and I can say I enjoyed the movie even before the passing in time of that year. I am grateful this is only a movie and we can see all the destruction of the earth in Surround Sound and full 1080p glory!  There are more disaster scenes happening in every square inch of the screen than in any other disaster move ever made previously. The cliff hanging scenes come non-stop throughout the entire film. The effects were topnotch quite real looking.  An enjoyable film  taken from the lore of ancient type prophecies. A likeable cast well acted good escapism all around!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I absolutely love these books!! I can't wait for the next one!! Must read all the books and everyone will understand what I'm saying!:)
B008B3MZNI|3.0|The blue ray DVD video quality was very disappointing. The sound quality was okay, nothing spectacular. I have purchased superb quality concert DVDs like the Phil Collins &#34;Finally The First Farewell Tour&#34;. The video and audio quality blew me away!!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Awsome, love the Hoth one! Love the at-at walkers. Deflecting blaster fire is a must! Five more words are required.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It is easy to use and will tell my friends that they should try it,  It is the only one I use
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use this calculator.  It has the function keys I use all the time.  It looks great on my Fire, fills the whole screen.
B008FERHV8|5.0|This movie is set in the same type of rural impoverished community setting as in her later movie, The Hunger Games<br />Jennifer's character must provide everything for her younger siblings due to a dysfunctional mother as in Hunger Games.<br />Jennifer must go on a quest to assure the survival of her family. I think this movie and Jennifer's performance was brought up to the creators of the film Hunger Games to have Jennifer as the possible lead and it turned out to be a brilliant choice!
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I ran into this on amazon instant and absolutely loved it. It is a great version of Jane Austen's work and I was sad that it was only four episodes. It's funny and serious at the right times and it's appropriate for all age groups. Will watch again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A great explaination of why the bible reads like the novel it is and how it became what it is.  Must read
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Only thing I don't like is the ads. Once you try space, the original ones are boring. three words required.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Their news seems to out reach ours and I think they are covering it better.  Don't watch it enough but I don't like watching news as it is to depressing
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|This movie was a Giant size WWE match of a lifetime. I loved the action, the character development, the plot was old and original who would have thought.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|One of the hardest things to write is a how-to book or manual.  This book is clear, Concise, assumes nothing, and outlines clear steps even for novices.  An excellent example of clear thinking and writing.  Well done!
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Best Matthew M. Movie since Contact.  Great acting, great script.  Never a dull moment.  Best part was that the movie was never predictable.  I compare this movie to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and Crazy Stupid Love in the fact that it was never huge in the theaters and it was a great find, since no one had really recommended it to us.  You will enjoy this movie.
B00A8KJN14|5.0|My husband wanted this movie because he had heard it was good.  It is a good movie just a bit weird.
B003R0LBVW|4.0|Freedom was full of engaging characters and it left me wondering to the last two pages how it would turn out. It was impressive overall. The only drawback was that Franzen went a little too indepth into mountain top removal and bird topics. It became a little frustrating.
B006671NPM|5.0|I had all the other Harry Potter Dvds and had to have this one to complete the series A must have for true Harry potter fans
B004SBS8LA|3.0|It worked well at first then sort of gave out. If you are into these type of games I would recommend purchasing one, The grand kids got a kick out of it but didn't want it bad enough to spend their hard earned $ on it. It is a cute non offensive game suitable for all ages, and good for what it is &#34;a trial version&#34;
B000002KZ6|5.0|Burning down the House is a great hit but there so many other great tunes on this album, a must for Heads fans!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Overall, I found this book to be very helpful. Like other reviewers, the experiments didn't work for me. But I was ok with that because the main message I took away was to be more positive about myself. And treat myself more kindly. You'd think that would be intuitive for anyone, but, in this day and age, it's not in my opinion. I've been saying positive affirmations every day for the past few weeks and I've found myself feeling better and more cheerful. This book won't change your life, but it can give you a different perspective to help you change your life. Or at least make it a bit better!
B009LREA1S|5.0|I honestly was worried they would not be able to replace the joker, or worse would replace the joker with someone.<br /><br />This entire trilogy is worth investing in.  It truly is the best Batman ever.  It completely diverges from the original Pow! Bam! Holl Batspray Adam West  to be a serious action movie.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This is a really addictive game so much so I had to download it on my partners Kindle for him now he can't stop playing it brilliant if you like puzzles
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like playing this game.  It's fun and I like having to build my town.  The only thing is that you don't have enough energy to get things.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fast and relaxing if you ever update it with the beach it's faster.That's why you should try updating it that's fun now.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I LOVED The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, so naturally I had to read Mockingjay!  I needed closure, and Mockingjay did that for me, but it was a much slower read than the first two books.  Suzanne Collins is an outstanding author, and I thoroughly enjoyed this series!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I've never been disappointed in any Vince Flynn books. This one hit the mark also. Good read! You will enjoy.
B00ARF92HK|3.0|I expected violence, but the slow motion tearing of flesh was just sick, and of course the plot has been used so many times it is &#34;old hat&#34; now.  The only thing of value in the movie was the relationship of the judges.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Addictive game fun n pass by time fast. I wish I could play candy crush on my kindle fire. But it's a good game
B000FA675C|4.0|This book is a great read!  It's a little challenging but definitely worth reading if you're in to mysteries and thrillers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|super easy to use and convient!!!! I would recommend this to anyone that needs a calculator! great for kids too!
1607066017|5.0|Really unique read. It is rather graphic which I didn't know beforehand, so yea don't read it on a plane. Ha.<br /><br />The illustrations are very clean. Need to read the next volume now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Been meaning to read it for a long time and I devoured it. Card is an incredible story teller and it is especially interesting when you think about the Cold War era he was writing in. Masterful.
0525952926|5.0|Read part one first (Fall of giants). This book is wonderfully complex yet an easy read. Stunning glimpse at the lives of people on all sides of the Second World War and the social issues that led to the rise of Fascism. I cannot wait for the third part of the Trilogy to be written
B004I744AS|5.0|Fluid with lots of definitions and examples I prefer it over paper dictionary. So far no pop ups incredible application would advise all get it free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is absolutely addicting.  You can't stop playing!  If you only want to do one run, you'll immediately do about five more!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|What a book!!! This story was fantastic. It is a wonderful story of love, loss, heartache, and healing. It is very well written by a great author. It is the first in a two book series. I am about to begin the second one now.
0440237688|5.0|My granddaughter who is 10 and I read this together and discussed it after each chapter. It's a book you won't forget
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Card is a good story writer so this is a decent books, but if you are looking for something on par with Ender's Game, you pretty much can't get better than the original.
B00F57VFXO|5.0|Another delightful entry in `The Ian Fleming Files' series. This one works as a breezy entertainment but also has a lot on its mind. Biographical details are peppered throughout the narrative but never get in the way of the plot which moves fast but always remains credible. A thoroughly enjoyable read.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|This movie is funny.  Humor delivers a very kind portrait of mankind showing that goodness and generosity of spirit triumph over all bad.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book is a great read.  It keeps you interested while you're reading but I felt it started a little slowly.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have published books on Kindle before, but I wanted to make sure I was following the right steps.  This book was so perfect.  It answered every question guided me through the process perfectly.  Highly recommend it if you want to publish on Kindle.
B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|Tthis is great step in the recording carreer of Anna.I look forward to years of Anna tackling even great parts and songs.From begining to end a joy to listen to.What will the future hold we can't wait to see.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a wonderful tale! I highly recommend buying the Omnibus Edition: I can't imagine stopping after the first part of the story. Can't wait for more!
B00338QENI|5.0|A superior job in researching all aspects of this woman's life and the history of her cells. This should be required reading in school.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is a very good series ... made to high English standards. Acting, scenery, house, costumes all excellent.<br />I'm very happy with Amazon, offering a used UK edition in great condition.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|This book is such a great read.  I loved the movie so I wanted to read the book and I'm liking the book better!
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|The author shares nine experiments that prove the universe is a living, vibrating entity that gives you what you focus on. But as someone mentions she does not tell you how to make sure you succeed with them.<br /><br />Most of the material is already spoken of in other books so this one does not share a whole lot of new ideas. Some text also reads airy fairy. Overall, not too bad though.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|I would give as many stars possible to the old version, it was easy to use, now I can't watch videos anymore. Please bring back the old version.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This author writes about a sad topic but does it in a way that is humorous, thoughtful and heartwarming.  If you liked the Secret Life of Bees, you will love this book.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's really great but I can't connect to Facebook which I can't compete witch sucks.but it's only on my kindle Fire tablet.
B00007KWHG|5.0|These folks exceeded all my expectations! Excellent product, good price, immediate service. Thanks! I will do that again and again!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Interesting historical background to a real thriller.  Excellent character development.  It was very hard to put down.<br />Great book for the beach
0345529057|5.0|Bought this for my dad for his birthday. He is an fan of the show, and loves the book set!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I so love this show, was thrilled to be able to watch the episode on my computer when I wanted to see it!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Life changing.... Experiments that prove the energy of Lihue all around you .  Could barely wait for the experiment to end before I started the next one.
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|It is a good way to meet great people,I like it,so if you want to meet new people try this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome! Im glad i downloaded it:_: When im bored i play it and when im down i play it...it makes me happy...it's a reallly funnn game:)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Great twist. Read it in one day!  Just had to find out the ending as I knew it was going to be good!
B00DQR26EC|5.0|Easily one of the best offerings on android. Old school gameplay with a modern sense of immature humorous. Must play.
B008602KQI|5.0|AWESOMENESS, GREAT, LOVE IT, JENNIFER LAWRENCE IS BRILLIANT, JOSH HUTCHERSON ALSO ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS I'VE EVER SEEN. I.LOVED.IT.
1781162646|1.0|I looked forward to getting this book on my nook, having decided not to clutter my house with any more paper.  I am very disappointed that the publisher has for some reason chosen not to live in the current century.  Sorry, Stephen, until your book becomes available in e-format, you will not have me for a reader.
B00AYB12PC|5.0|My grandson watched the movie, Scream, he loved it, he watches movies like this all the time, although he watches them with his mom.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Fun with great actors and an entertaining plot. The interaction between the leads was intriguing and fun. The right mix of adventure and comic relief.
B008133MDK|5.0|I was late to the game with this series but I am a devoted fan now. I realize the BBC, and the very popular actors, will not likely keep this show running past season 3, but for any Sherlock Holmes fan, this series, and the wonderful writing, is delightful and intelligent and engaging. In retrospect, I probably couldn't have stood it waiting for the next episode during the regular season anyway. And now that I'm hooked? The next season will be utter torture.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Loved reading that &#34;Stealing&#34; or using other's art work as inspiration is ok and has been done for hundreds of years. It gave me the courage to do what makes me happy and what I want to recreate using my own rules and sanatios.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching fire is so good. I read the hunger games and I had to read catching fire. Every part of the book I loved. I still like the hunger games a little bit better. The events in the book just keeps u reading more and more. I loved it I loved it I love  it. Their isn't much else I can say because I don't want to spoil it for some people. Hope this helped
B00ENYKBD0|5.0|Wonderful acting! Great look into the world of schizophrenia and genius. Jennifer Connelly does a superb job as his wife. Crowe is so convincing. Just a must see movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How to earn more coins is confusing. Great game for kids. Will definitely recommend. Kids love to play it should be easier for them to change character.
B008ROH07W|5.0|Alison Balsom plays a natural trumpet and I love her playing.  This is royal music indeed, with Alison accompanied by Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert.  As a youngster, Alison first became intrigued with classical music from Pinnock's recording of The Brandenberg Concertos so their partnership is a rather fortuitous one.  Many of the works on this CD were originally written for instruments other than the trumpet so hearing the trumpet version sheds new light on some familiar pieces..  Highly recommended!
B000I186FW|5.0|I love this movie.  Great cast, and a well told story throughout.<br /><br />The actual blu-ray dvd case didn't come with any insert in the case, which was odd, but not a big deal.  It just came with the blu-ray dvd, shipping was fast.
B000GM4X0A|1.0|One book great - the second book's code had been used, so could not take survey - need to return it
B008XG1X18|1.0|Already removed it from my device. Very frustrating app.  Boards would not open. Just kept seeing that obnoxious spinning push pin.
B0041KW2UQ|5.0|The disc was great unfortunately I was looking for a US version and was shipped a PAL version.  Nothing wrong with the disc, it was brand new, just be careful that the fine print doesn't read PAL
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Great app! My younger cousins love it and so do I. Please make more of your apps free for the day.
B002XZNHG4|5.0|i just watched this film again in 2013. i was expecting that roughly thirty five years later this film would seem dated.  i was wrong.  it was as fresh today as when i saw it when it first came out in the 1970s.  this is probably because it stuck to universals and in particular to the problems men and women have staying together. allen loosely used his own failed relationship with diane keaton as the basis for this film.  her real life name is Diane Hall and friends and family have always called her annie, not diane.<br /><br />this film establishes the basis for all of his best work in the ensuing decades.  he melds comedy with the bittersweetness of life,  although one laughs loudly at all of the comedic set ups in annie hall, from the scene with the lobsters to likening relationships to sharks, a melancholy runs throughout the film that these two will not last and will go their separate ways.<br /><br />of course the relationship he wants is one many people want but which no one can have as a lasting thing.  he wants the beginning, the falling in love, the giddiness, the wonderfulness. when he can't have it, he has to go onto someone new until that dies as well. many people in America have this problem.  there has to a certain level of affluence to have this problem. people with more basic needs are forced by circumstance to persevere and endure in their marriages, such as the characters portrayed as his parents.<br /><br />this film won a bunch of oscars including best film and best actress for diane keaton.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0757302661|4.0|A great book that really helps foster a mentality and desire for a natural birth experience.  Compelling and re-affirming to that aim.  The book is well written, but frequently remarks that supplemental materials will be provided in taking their courses.  Since we are not taking the courses, it is my aim to use this and other method philosophies on our own, without classes.  Another poster remarked that she read the book twice and used their suggested methods to practice solely from the book and was still able to have a natural birth.<br /><br />We are not due for another 5-7 weeks and no drug or medical option is appealing to me.  I aim to have a natural birth, and this book is definitely geared toward preparing you for that goal.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The show has a good blend of interesting characters. The plot lines aren't so heavy as to make the show tedious to watch.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Really great app. Like the categories too. Able to match the mood or evenings activities. Dinner, easy listening, or reading background music.
B003BWERF8|1.0|Failed after about one week I sent it back exchanges seemed to be way to routine for these guys when the second one failed I just walked away.
B00A3T5CGU|1.0|Could not get this app to even load maps . Hard navigate from a black screen. Not worth my time!!!~
B00EMQKHXI|5.0|Fact, fiction, history, horror, pseudo-martial arts and mythology are impressively rolled into one in this unique film. I had my doubts about seeing this film, but I was pleasantly surprised and actually quite impressed by this film's visual style. It truly has a nightmarish quality about and that is the one lingering after effect of this strange film. Many parts of this film come off rather camp and history is reduced to a very minimalist artistic form of art, yet these very aspects of the film add to its strange and unsettling effect on the viewer. At times the film reassembles a very low budget television mini-series while at others it looks like a widescreen extravaganza. I saw the film in both the standard flat-screen presentation and the very impressive and technically astounding 3-D version. The film has a strange curiously voyeuristic quality about it. The almost bleached out colors, slow motion shots and digital editing, baroque costume designs and haunting set decorations and designs bolster these. The overall premise of the film is quite ludicrous, but it always takes itself quite seriously. And that is what makes this movie work as a very entertaining and haunting piece of filmmaking.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The second season is a lot better than the first!  Lewis is great.  Love that man!  I have to put 4 more words for this to qualify as a review. Otherwise Amazon will keep sending me a reminder to review things.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I loved each story, was actually hard to put down.<br />Sachi has lived an interesting life.  Hope she writes more.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Never worked for my being able to view videos at my sites. WFN, INFISHERMAN, and various other outdoor sites. I apparently am too stupid to figure out your program needs.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Such an interesting documentary going back into history about the Sound City studio in California.  Really does well explaining how the sound was captured with the Neve soundboard.  Excellent performances by all artists included.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|Great actors and good writing! However, I do find some of the female roles are too exaggerated. Male roles are more believable.
B003NX76BM|5.0|I have so little time to read, and this book was a :fast reader!:  I couldn[t put it down!!  It had just enough intrigue, suspense and romance to hold one's interest.  GREAT STORY!
B002361MLA|5.0|A must read along with his other two books. Tolle is a master of the<br />understanding of the enlightenment and his books take you to a new<br />realization of life. I am so much happier now!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A wonderful, thought provoking book. If only these different realities really existed. Or do they....We may never know the truth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|What a great app. I had never  played a game like this.  My only wish is for more rooms. :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game for using your brain to figure out the solution.  Can't wait for more rooms to open.  Fun and challenging!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I have really enjoyed season one of Lark Rise to Candleford. It is funny, sad and interesting watching the lives of these people.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|an update gave me 30 levels, but, The recent update took away those 30 levels, 30 ENTIRE LEVELS!!!!!!!!! I AM EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED IN WHOMEVER THOUGT OF DOING THIS. I mean SERIOUSLY, it's like taking candy from a baby, A BABY! So mean, oh and if you did this for &quot;money&quot; reasons, just say for no reason.&gt;:(
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|I didn't think the acting was all that great in this version. The only thing going for Dredd were the shooting scenes. The story line could have been better. As bad as the original was it was better then this one.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|I'm really not. I understand that they are all the rage, but of all the movie monsters out there, zombies have always been one of my least favorite. They are boring, frankly, and gross. Yes. So, I began viewing this one with a good deal of skepticism (The Walking Dead is good, as well), but came away pleasantly surprised. I'm a Brad Pitt fan, anyway, and, also, it is always interesting to see how these different productions 're-imagine' their zombie origins. And, the movie following the worldwide outbreak of this was fascinating-- particularly in Jerusalem (I'll say no more about that!). If you are able to handle zombies, at all, I'd suggest this one and its different take on such a crisis more from a U.N. standpoint, than merely a U.S. POV.
B000002URV|5.0|Just adding another cd of Enigma to my collection.. This is a very good cd, yet I feel all of are of Enigma
B00AL8F5EM|5.0|This book was read start to finish, not too common for me. Helpful information for my bilingual family! It made me realize that we could do a lot more for our children.
B00ECUARO8|4.0|We never know who is going to come into our lives and change them forever. A young boy finds a friend in an unlikely<br />Way and his life is changed for better or worse. Some lessons are learned the hard way, and maybe he isn't the only<br />One who learns a lesson.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|This was an ok movie. Not quite as good as the original. The acting was ok nothing special. Story line was all right. Watching it on my Kindle for free was the right price. If I had to choose which movie to watch again, the original would win out.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|my daughter LOVES this game. she has taken over my tablet and is always playing. couldn't ask for a better game for her.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome game lots of fun<br />only thing that would make it better would be more opportunities to get free gems
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Smash is a witty series of the highest caliber. Well written, great character development, outstanding music/singing/acting, and addicting. Don't miss it.
B004DH8IK0|5.0|Great Album, it stays to it's Drum N Bass roots but adds elements of other electronic styles to make one great album. Especially love the feature of the Swedish Metal Band
B0024RIMBG|5.0|Saw the Celtic woman on TV loved it so much I bought the disc.  Very moving music. Three more words.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Disappointed in male actors. The book was much better. Didn't care for over the top scenes. Will watch the old one
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book was enjoyable, it kept my interest in wanting to finish but not enough to say I could not put it down. Actually, that was a good thing because it did not keep me up late at night.
B00846WWVM|4.0|easy for my son to play. couldnt get enough of it for two weeks. needs more levels, but lots of fun
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a awesome game. It requitpres full animal love. if u like animals u would love this game. you WILL LOVE THIS GAME.All ages can play so, bonus. love it!!!Awesome.  Love it!!! Epic!!!
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I was looking for a series that would keep me watching.  The Tudors was a great choice.  It is both well written and well acted.  I look forward to each episode and can't wait to see what happens next.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|love the book...it is  a very spiritual, rich, loving, and rather amazing from the perspective of Enzo.  Tears, laughter, excitement and genuine kindness and caring.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|A very well constructed story line this season connects episodes together.  There are uncomfortable moments that are felt by the viewer.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|People say they &#34;multi-task&#34;... people lie. If you're doing more than one thing at a time you aren't doing *any* of them at your peak.<br /><br />Example; pain is all consuming, at least chronic pain is. Not to throw a pity party but that's my life. The only way to overcome the pain (brain activity) is to make your brain active... *totally* active doing something else.<br /><br />*THAT's* Cubistry.<br /><br />The only failing is it has to end, you have to finish the round. But there's always the *next* round.<br /><br />Thanks guys.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|This movie has action, but I didn't care much for any of these characters.  The lines they have throw this movie off.  it seems like their trying comic relief, but when it's in every line and scene it makes the whole movie a joke.  i like the Evil Dead movies and they are up the same alley as this, but they are done well and have the same comedic vein throughout the whole movie.  they are consistent, but this movie is hit and  mostly miss.  Good special effects and buckets of blood don't make this movie worth watching.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app frees RAM and gets rid of residual files. Does what it is supposed to do with minimum footprint.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Well done!  Great backstory for a classic.  Have to say, would have been cool if it transitioned into the original script.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Yes I got it, yes, I played it and yes, I LOVE jigsaw puzzles on the computer. That said, I don't actually remember this title. That mean it was *so* unremarkable that I neither liked, nor hated it. With a flashlight app, that makes it, &#34;Okay&#34;. For an app that represents an app type I should &#34;Love&#34;, that means I didn't like it
B00B89WXYS|5.0|Great album.  I saw them in Columbus this summer.  There are some real good stories behind their songs.  Like Frosted Flakes their Great!
B00A285OOW|3.0|I have always enjoyed Ms Gregory's books, but I am finding this one difficult to follow.  I keep confusing the Elizabeths & Henrys & Edwards.  Ms Gregory always has such exact details  in her books.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|This album is indeed what the other reviewers are saying: an overlooked gem, a lost treasure, a thoroughly splendid set of tunes from start to finish, and now supplemented by a few bonus tracks. I have two other Gene Clark albums, plus the usual Byrds assortment, but somehow this fine album slipped through the cracks of my musical awareness until recently. After a dozen listens, I'm now hooked. These songs are all keepers!<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of \\"alternate versions\\" of songs that are already on an album, finding them too derivative most of the time, so some of these bonus tracks don't strike me as essential listening, although, as the liner notes say, it certainly is interesting to hear some of the tunes in their early demo form. Plus, the newer verson of \\"Train Leaves Here This Morning\\" (from Clark's great album with the Dillards) sounds marvelous.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Gene Clark's solo albums or his work with the Byrds, I think you'll like this neglected jewel of an album very much.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm now finally old enough to read these books! I have waited and waited and waited now my parents have decided it's ok to read.  Then I thought wow this better be worth my time. and it so was. Here's some advice if you read this book<br />be ready to read all three books you just can't stop on the first. Oh and you have to love Rue in the book to love the series. I finished this book in a heartbeat oh and watch the movie to but don't get too excited. Well that's my opinion. and I give it a five star and a resounding thumbs up!  READ IT .  ( that' a command) :)
B006GECE9Y|4.0|Clunky at times and often *painfully* slow, but it edges out the mobile Chrome browser and is light years ahead of the pathetic POS that comes standard on my ASUS TF700T Transformer Pad, Android 4.2.1 (Jelly Bean), and my Samsung Galaxy S3, Android 4.1.2 (STILL Jelly Bean but somewhat different). Both are known only as &#34;Browser&#34;. (Sigh)<br /><br />It's quicker on the phone in 3G than on the tablet on my home Wi-Fi, but that's probably Comcast's doing. And the Bookmark tab can be a pain to find. But as it's the best mobile browser I've used and I use it daily, it still rates four stars... if it was faster it would earn the extra star.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|This movie has dames, guns, shooting, car chases, revenge, tommy guns and big explosions.  Who needs acting, this movie kicks your brains out!
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|Great book people 7- 12 should read this book<br />It is sad but makes the fairy tale world combine with are world
0446615625|2.0|I manage a bookshop and we sell a lot of Baldacci books, but I'd never read anything by him until I decided to give \\"The Camel Club\\" a try. I read a lot of crime fiction and am always looking for good new authors to add to my stable of favorites. But after reading \\"The Camel Club\\" I can safely say that I won't be adding Baldacci to my list. For such a popular author, this is shockingly bad stuff.<br /><br />Actually, maybe he shouldn't be categorized as a \\"writer\\" at all. On the back cover of this novel it says: \\"David Baldacci is one of the world's favorite storytellers.\\" Ah, so that's it; he's a storyteller, not a writer. That explains a lot. Reading this book, it's obvious that his writing skills are very pedestrian, the plot full of cliches and improbable scenes. There is no real style or craft in his simplistic prose. This novel reads like it was aimed at middle school readers. Don't worry; no big words to trip over!<br /><br />The novel starts off well enough, with enough fragments of of mystery and suspense to keep the reader interested in \\"what will happen next\\". Plus, the ragtag group of genius misfits who call themselves \\"The Camel Club\\" are likeable and intriguing in their own right. All the elements for a good page-turner, right? Unfortunately, the plot gets horribly convoluted and the events in the last half are so ridiculous and implausible that it defies any credibility. It's absurd enough that it could be a Carl Hiaasen story, except that Hiaasen is funny and writes well, while Baldacci's wooden style seems to lack any sense of humor. Baldacci may be a \\"terrific storyteller\\" in the minds of some, but to me this is just a waste of time and paper.
B00821OX98|5.0|This program grows with each episode and satisfies the mature Sci Fi fan.  Well worth watching on streaming.  Let's hope the series runs a few more seasons.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game me and my baby daddy play it every night before bed as quality time....<br />He loves it and so do i
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Enjoy the actors and characters.  Spin off of Dr. Who series.  Love the episodes because they are raw and smash mouth.
B008TRH5N6|3.0|It is old book but I enjoy it. This is my first book about subconscious, I planning to read more about this subject.
B00422LESO|5.0|Lovely story, a good takeoff on Austen's approach to romance, well executed. Jane is a 30ish woman with no luck at love, given a chance to experience the world that Austen did in an Austen theme park, with period clothing, Regency mansion, and manners and characters of Austen's time. Fascinating concept!
B00915G6MG|5.0|We enjoyed watching each episode of the NCIS 10th Season.  We truly are NCIS fans and watch their Marathon's all the time as well as their new shows.
B00CQZ65SI|5.0|Very well written with lot of make sense information on health and food that can make us sick and put weight on with out even knowing it. Novak Djokovic is not only the best tennis player in the world he is very intelligent speaks 5 languages so I am sure he has done lots of research on food that causes are body to not agree with us.Lot of good recipes as well. I am going to buy the hard copy to keep in kitchen.Great book,Thanks Novak
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I watched this with my grand-daughter and we both loved it.  It was a great movie about a gifted little girl surrounded by a bunch of completely lunatic family members.  About like most families  - just kidding!.  It was a very happy and feel good movie and terrific one to watch with kids.  It was funny, sometimes a little sad but mostly just a fun to watch movie....
B0020BUWX2|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! Kept my attention that I read it in less than 3 hours. Loved the way this story was written
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Love this game but it has shut down!!!! Help?!? I'm missing it bad. How do I get it to open again?
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The multiple plot lines, good character development, and interesting cases keep this show on my &#34;must watch&#34; list. While still a bit unrealistic for the true practice of law (which law TV show is realistic?), it is entertaining and so much fun to watch. Perfect for a night in and binging on several episodes.
