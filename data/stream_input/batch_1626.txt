B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great timing on asking for a review, I just finished the book last night, in the Kindle version.  Lot's of interesting photos at the end.  The author is a true American hero, and DEVGRU is the best of the best.  The story is gripping and gives insight into the real SEALS.  Tactics have changed since I retired in 1995 as Command Master Chief for Naval Special Warfare Engineering Support Det 110 (A Naval Reserve Unit that repaired Special Warfare equipment).  I enjoyed getting this update on the life of a SEAL.  This book is more than just a story of the raid itself.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A well written account of Navy Seal operations and the true story behind behind the killing of OBL.  These guys are true heros and give an accurate account of what happened not that BS version put out by the White House.
0385344333|3.0|Jack Reacher once again encounters \\"bad luck and trouble\\" as he travels through the nation's heartland in Lee Child's \\"A Wanted Man.\\"  Reacher stands on the side of a Nebraska road on a cold winter night, waiting for a stranger to offer him a ride.  Who would stop his car to give a lift to a \\"ragged and unkempt\\" six foot five behemoth with a busted nose?  After over an hour and a half of fruitless waiting, Jack gets into an automobile that has two passengers in addition to the driver.  Just like that, Reacher finds himself in another thorny situation.<br /><br />Readers will not be surprised to observe that our hero is still homeless and carries around nothing but a toothbrush, an old passport, an ATM card, and some cash.  He wears his clothes for a few days and then throws them out (no recycling for him!).  As always, Reacher is a danger magnet.  This time, he finds himself knee-deep in an investigation involving murder, counterterrorism, and an undercover operation gone awry.<br /><br />Fans know that Jack is a terrific street-fighter, an excellent marksman, and a canny strategist who can improvise with the best of them.  He reads people with ease and has a knack for seeing through lies and pretense.  Although he can walk (or hitchhike) away from this mess if he chooses, Jack recklessly accompanies a female FBI agent into the lion's den and almost single-handedly takes on a band of armed villains. The author provides pure fantasy and escapism, and this novel will appeal to those who crave action, adventure, bloody conflict, and details about police procedure, tire tracks, a victim's remains, and various types of weaponry.  On the other hand, readers who are sticklers for logic, character development, and believability may find \\"A Wanted Man\\" to be a bit wanting.
B000083E79|5.0|This album is really the very best of cher. i dont have to do the thing where i point out the good songs because they are all great. my all time faves though are \\"all or nothing\\" \\"dark lady\\" and \\"i got you babe\\"
B0042J6VUS|5.0|I loaded a time lapse app on my iPod and was looking for a stable platform to use during filming.  This tripod fit the bill perfectly.  It is well constructed.  The iPod is held in place with a padded spring loaded clamp.  It looks like it will hold a phone or other device up to 3/4\\".  I have to say that at less than $4.00 delivered from Hong Kong it was a steal.  Shipping took about three weeks, but well worth the wait.
B005FISBTO|1.0|There is a two or three minute commercial for Showtime that must be endured every time you put one of the Dexter DVD's into the player.  You can't skip or Fast-Fwd through it, you have to just sit there, helplessly, allowing Showtime to ram this long commercial down your throat.  I was so angry that I hit the mute button and didn't even look at the screen until the coercion was over.  I spent that time (about 30 minutes total) vowing to never subscribe to Showtime, or buy any more DVD's from them (So the commercial was very effective after all).  I was luckier than most because I never saw the season finale spoiler that the imbeciles at Showtime spliced into their commercial.<br />If you enjoy feeling powerless and dominated, and paying for it, then you should buy this DVD set.
1932735410|5.0|This is THE only guide I followed for PMP exam. I read 10 pages of three guides that I bought and PMBOK handbook to get a taste of the mountain in front of me because I only had 2 weeks to appear in the exam. For many reasons I could not appear the exam for 11 months in the 12 months that PMI allows after being eligible to appear in the exam.<br /><br />Back to the Book: After going through 10 pages of the three guides, I got convinced this is the only guide I need to follow. It is rich on content, reflects PMBOK better and also \\"guides\\" one to prepare for the exam. I went through the guide begin-to-end twice. Then I skimmed through the PMBOK as adviced in Rita's guide. That was a VERY GOOD ADVICE because I learnt a few more stuff especially HR Planning and Project Closing processes which Rita does not cover as well as other chapters.<br /><br />The main point in the PMP exam is they try to test how you react in project situations and if those reactions are as per PMI best practices/standards/guidelines/ethics etc. etc. PMBOK gives you the knowledge, but does not make you \\"unlearn\\" some of the bad practices you learn in your day-to-day work and get you to really think about situations. Rita's guide really guides you to go over that hurdle, makes you think about situations in the right way. It literally does by asking you stop, think and test your knowledge and in the process helps you unlearn some of the wrong things you learn on the job that you did not know.<br /><br />I highly RECOMMEND anyone preparing for PMP to use this guide.
B008J34466|5.0|This is a great comeback. her best album since her misundaztood cd. i looked forward to this album since i heard the announcement late last year. the songs are the best. of course their is the lead single \\"blow me one last kiss\\". my other favorites are \\"are we all we are\\" \\"try\\"  \\"slut like you\\" \\"true love\\" \\"how come your not here\\" and of course \\"here comes the weekend\\" which also features eminem. i dont regret buying this album. you should at least give it a listen. p!nk didnt dissapoint this time.
B0053XM7ZU|5.0|I loved the TV series so I started the books at A Storm of Swords part one.  This one is part 2 of the third book and I have enjoyed each one equally.  The third book was split into two parts as it was too big.  These books are really fun to read and I've found as the story shifts to each character that I just want to read on to find out what has happened to the last character then get caught up in what is happening to the character in each current chapter.  I'm now onto the next book, A Feast for Crows and still find it just as enthralling.  Highly recommend these books.
B00933JL0A|2.0|I played for a few hours. kept me very occupied. but now it shuts down after 2-3 mins of gameplay,and doesn't save what you've done in those few mins.  will be uninstalling immediately.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my child can play some of these. some are still challenging enough for adults. I like that it has unlockable games.
B00000DG1R|4.0|Im not a big fan but i have this album for the two singles \\"ordinary world\\" and \\"hungry like the wolf\\". great songs.
034580404X|5.0|Guys...I could write a book about this book, but it's all been said.  For those that rated it low...perhaps you've not ever experienced the effect of being hopelessly in love or perhaps your first time is a blur. Ana's path through this journey is as innocent, sensual and sweet as ever.  If only I had the opportunity...that is outside of the bondage.  Christian was in most cases extrememly considerate and lovable.  Enough of that...is Christian African American or did I misunderstand?  We've debated this in my lil circle of reader buddies...lol! I thought it was pretty cut and dry until someone started asking questions.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|The author isn't asking you to embrace her parenting style.  She didn't silence her children or physically abuse them.  She forced them into achieving a meaningful future where they could stand on their own two feet and be confident, strong, well-educated women.  There is plenty in this book that I will use raising my own daughter!!  I, for one, thank her!!  From the interviews I've seen, her own daughters are grateful too.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|The Bad 25 set is the best MJ release in a very very long time. He is already known as a performer who's show was amazing, but during the Wembley show he was just on it! This is THE definitive Michael Jackson live performance, he seems so into every song it's crazy. I've seen Bad Tour concerts before but there is just something different about the show. The audio is crystal clear, perfect, it is from multitracks that were used to mix the show as it was going. About the video, people complained at first when they heard it would be sourced from a video tape. However, what we do know is that the Estate let everyone know how they did a numerous amount of extensive searches of the film storage warehouses and could not find the film masters. The fact that Michael had someone mix down the video feed onto a VHS tape for his own performance means that that was and is the only currently available source for the show. Another cool thing is that the Estate paid a company that they said is used by NASA to restore videotapes to better represent the source that was put on them. The result is a pretty decent quality film that definitely produces alot more detail than one would imagine. The image is sharp and colors are good for the most part too. This is the exact video feed the jumbotrons got so we have a show with no editing or crowd shots, it is excellent. There are also 2 additional performances from other dates and locations of the Bad Tour in the bonus features. For those that just want the DVD it is sold stand alone.<br /><br />Disc 1 (Original Bad Album + Leave Me ALone) is similar to the 2001 Special Edition in terms of sound, however the mixing and mastering definitely do sound alot better than before. It is less compressed and it seems more dynamic too. Certain instruments now sound alot better. The mastering could be a bit better but it sounds better than 90% of the CDs out there and Bad is a sonicly high end album.<br /><br />Disc 2 is where the real fun begins. We have 6 new songs:<br />Dont Be Messin Around- Previously released on the 2012 I Just Cant Stop Loving You single, groovy relaxed track that has a great tempo<br /><br />Im So Blue- Ballad that in terms of music, theme, and voice sounds very similar to the Jacksons (self titled album and Goin Places) era style but with a country sound as well. Sounds weird but it works.<br /><br />Song Groove (Abortion Papers)- This song is awesome, it is an upbeat dance track that is serious at the same time and has really nice background music that is similar to Sega Genesis games (such as Sonic). Only Michael would make a song about Abortion danceable. This is excellent, one of the best.<br /><br />Free - Very relaxed ballad about being Free and soaring high, a nice track but not one of my favorites.<br /><br />Price of Fame - This is fantastic, it is my favorite on the set. This is another one that has upbeat synth/drum beats but is paranoid and haunting as well. This is about the hardships that have happened to him and it is very sad to hear how much he was stalked by fans and paparazzi. Michael mentions how people think if he can just sign checks all day long than everything in his life must be fine. Whilst Leave Me Alone portrayed Jackson as angry/fed up with the media this one is scarier and more about him being in fear. I think of this song as Leave Me Alone meets Billie Jean. This is my personal favorite of the new material.<br /><br />Al Capone - Fans had known about this track and how it had developed into Smooth Criminal for a very long time, however now that it is finally here it is apparent that this track has very little similarities with Smooth Criminal. It seems darker in tone than SC and more synthesized, another one that sounds like Sega Genesis music. Jackson sings really fast in this one, seems to be about Al Capone being on the loose and frightening a town \\"How could you let him get away\\" \\"Cause a mad man's out tonight!\\". Great track overall, a bit shorter than the other ones. It's short but sweet and very interesting, I prefer it to Smooth Criminal personally.<br /><br />The rest of Disc 2's tracklist is the bonus songs from the 2001 Special Edition of Bad (Streetwalker, Fly Away, Spanish I Just Cant Stop Loving You) and then as a bonus for the first time on CD the French I Just Cant Stop Loving You, and 3 remixes, 2 of Bad, 1 of Speed Demon. The remixes can be decent at times but sound like generic club beats layed out over songs that do not need it. One of the raps on the \\"Bad\\" remix is atrocious. Keep in mind Michael did release the 25th Anniversary of Thriller album in his lifetime which was 4 awful remixes and only 1 unreleased track. The remixes are unnecessary but that is OK because they are right at the end so you don't have to skip over them to hear the good stuff. Also, by the time you are done with the non-remixes on disc 2 you are already 40 minutes into the disc anyways.<br /><br />Disc 3 is the audio of the Wembley show featured on the DVD, this is actually the first Michael Jackson solo live album release. I haven't given this a listen, but it comes from the same multitracks as the DVD release so Im sure it's excellent quality.<br /><br />You would think that that would be everything in this 35$ package but it's not. The set is housed in this nice looking black case that seems like a faux leather or vinyl material. Inside you have 2 extensive books that are around 30 or so pages each and have lots of never before seen photos. One is for the Bad Tour, one for the making of the Bad album and music videos. It's awesome to see pictures of people like Martin Scorsese, Robert Deniro, Quincy Jones, Stevie Wonder, and more all talking/working with Michael. The Bad Album and Disc 2 are housed in a gatefold full color front and back case, and the Wembley DVD and CD are housed in their own separate full color gatefold case too. Some parts of the cases have a shiny holographic sheen to them. Also there is a huge dual sided fold out poster underneath all this stuff too. The box looks so little but it is incredible how much stuff they fit in here and how well stylized they did, the packaging and presentation are excellent.<br /><br />Overall this is an amazing release for Michael Jackson fans, the Estate did a fantastic job with this one. I would've easily been fine paying double what they are charging for a set as nice as this. There is endless entertainment value in here including new songs, the ultimate live video performance, a live CD, books, and of course the original masterpiece Bad album.e other ones.

B007G3H8Y0|3.0|I want even a fan of train. i hated them until i heard the single 50 ways to say goodbye.
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|A plane crashes and survivors are left to fend for themselves in the Alaskan wilderness. Along the way, the elements and terrain, along with a nasty band of attacking wolves, complicate things in a predictable way. For instance, when one of the men started to cough constantly, all I thought in my head was, he's dead. You'll find yourself saying the same thing throughout. You basically start to watch it just to find out who dies next. The suspense was just lacking and the story didn't really end. I guess we're supposed to fill our minds with how that fight goes?<br /><br />The bottom line is that if you are looking for a brainless motion picture that requires suspension beyond all belief, with highly cliche characters and events, rent this flick. Otherwise, stay away.
0525953728|5.0|Just finished reading the Prologue. I know it may be too early to even think about writing a review, but I must say this:<br /><br />The writing style used[and possibly edited into] within just the first few pages has me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />This book has me feeling like I am in the action, and feeling every single emotion that was felt throughout the mission.<br /><br />Again, just from the Prologue alone, this is some of the best entertainment that a book has provided me...ever.<br /><br />Amazing!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app! Thank you Mojang for finally putting it on the kindle fire. It is completely worth the price. There is creative mode and survival both great!! 5 star!!
B006M4RN3U|1.0|All of their songs are overplayed on the radio what is the point of this album. just turn on any radio sation and you will here we r young or some nights
B004UID2LC|1.0|Wtf is going on with this? I cant download anything anymore! When I try to &quot;download as MP3&quot; It says &quot;Searching&quot; and then a half second later it stops! I even deleted a song I had already downloaded from this app, and tried to re-dowload the same song and its not working! Wtf... you lose 4 stars..
1847245455|2.0|Found it boring and stopped reading relatively quick. But, this is just my taste as my husband loved this series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun game with lots of interesting things to keep your attention. I highly recommend it for people of all ages. highly addictive
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a great app very accurate and it gives all the necessary info that is needed. It tells how much time the kindle has left for music, games, reading, ect, and it can also be set to personal preference. When the kindle is charging, this app will inform you what percentage the battery is currently at with a voice. very cool! thx smallte.ch, this is one of the most useful apps I have seen and I recommend Battery HD to everyone...
1612183956|5.0|Instead of writing a full-out review of the book, given that others have already done excellent work, I am going to get to the meat of what made this book work for me.  For one thing, I love stories about trying to escape from a strange or unknown place with little or no resources to start; this book fills that niche quite well.  But it goes other places as well, giving it a tone that started reminding me of my read of Shutter Island ... the feeling that something deeper is at play, something eluding the protagonist, something that will require outside intervention to resolve.  That's all I can say.  The ending surprised, entertained, and impressed me.  If you don't like this book it will probably because you have a problem with unexpected genre trespassing.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|Like many fans of the Longmire TV show, I was left wanting more when the first season ended. When I found out the show was based on these books I immediately bought The Cold Dish - and I loved it!<br /><br />Great characters, engaging plot, well developed backdrop. Walt is good company on a rainy evening. I am a voracious reader - and I highly recommend this one!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The whole thing just seemed trival. And that was before the sex started. The characters had about as much depth as a kiddie swimming pool so there wasn't any context for the dominance theme, except the usual girl wants strong guy stuff. Unless you like to read your porn instead of watch it, don't waste your time...
B0091REZMW|4.0|to pass the time. Love this type of game. Look forward to finishing it. love the graphics. Though the tutorial is a bit annoying.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|FANTASTIC. I LOVE THE BAD TOUR ON DVD. OUTSTANDING! THE ESTATE DID A GREAT JOB CONVERTING THE CONCERT TO DVD.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|This was a good movie. I found it interesting. I have not<br />read the series yet, but after watching the movie I am sure<br />I will read The Hunger Games series. I have a few friends<br />who have read it and they loved it and have recommended I<br />read them.
B0087HT36U|5.0|For those reviewers than whined that Angry birds want their game back.........this game is similiar to Angry Birds but alot better! Its more challenging as you progress with a better variety of things to fling. Some of the screens you really have to plan your attack. If you like angry birds you'll love this app.<br /><br />And if it doesn't run on your tablet/phone and/or you can't get it to work, maybe your device just can't run it, or maybe it's user failure? I have a kindle fire and can't tell you how many times people left negative reviews for apps stating, crashes/won't download /freezes/ DOESN'T WORK ON KINDLE FIRE. Haven't had an app yet not work on my fire and I download ALOT of apps.<br /><br />.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is the best app for pinterest I have used! Love this because it is easy and it takes me back to where I started without any effort!
0385737955|4.0|Not the usual type of book that I would pick up, but I liked it.  The made up words in this book are quite enjoyable, I got a kick out of them.  While I doubt the plot and characters, I am curious about where the story is headed in the second book.  Too many questions are left unanswered at the end of the book, so on to the second part I go.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The first two books were great.  I couldn't put them down and finished both quickly.  I'm having difficulty finishing the final book because it doesn't seem to be as exciting.
B000NQRE9Q|2.0|Between Robert Zemeckis forcing all three Back to the Future movies down my throat in one set and this - I am tired of hostage marketing.  I just want the three original titles - and I want them in standard Blu Ray cases, not much to ask.  I generally hate \\"special\\" packaging for these sets.  Have any of the a-holes that design this stuff ever tried to put it on their shelves?  I am guessing not.  I for one am not buying jack until I can get them packaged properly.  The same went for Back to the Future and the extended Lord of the Rings movies.<br /><br />I refuse to buy the bulky cardboard crap - and I won't be bullied into buying titles I don't want just because they're shoe-horned in with the ones I want.  EPIC FAIL by the studio on this.  I just keep watching my standard DVD's until they get it right.
B007PP2J9I|5.0|read it beginning to end in one weekend, couldn't stop reading; for me, the end didn't quite live up to the rest of the novel, but overall it was still very enjoyable
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoyed the book, \\"Gone Girl\\" and it has quite a few twists and turns, however, I enjoyed her first book, \\"Sharp Objects\\" more. it is really good and quite dark!
B000EHQTZO|5.0|Someone stole it from my mailbox , have to reorder it and have it shipped to my job ;( I just moved here and this will add to the reasons I dont like it
B0061PEAUY|5.0|One of her best books yet.  Up to the suspense of her early books.  Good flow to the characters and plot.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and didn't want to put it down to find out what would happen next.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|For once, the previews were not the very best bits of the film.  Just finished watching the movie and it was delightful.  Probably helps if you're over 50.  There is wit and a piercing eye for relationships: what they take - work and love.  I'm not going to spoil it for you.  I will say it was a wonderful couple of hours.  And, for $3.99, that's hard to beat!
B008KW43TE|5.0|I usually don't listen to rap, R&B, or Soul, but this album has basically changed all of that. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys very poetic music that calms you down.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|I am enjoying the convenience Camscanner Free app has provided.  I regularly needed a scanner for loose documents I would randomly receive.  Now my smartphone gives me any .pdf document that I need.<br /><br />I am so glad I can across this app.  Since it is an app it is everywhere I am.  I could not do that with a physical scanner.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This is going to sound wierd.<br /><br />I had this version on my kindle from this appstore. It slowed my device and caused many issues, unresponsive apps, lagging.<br /><br />I unistalled the app and downloaded it from different appstore. My device runs smoothly with no issues since then. I blame it for all my issues.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|If you´re a Rocky Horror fan, you should have this special Blu Ray edition, it have a great packaging, the extras are great and the movie on Blu Ray definitly rocks (you can see it on B&W or in Color)
B004LQGXPA|5.0|A Classic that all fans of WWII movies should see. George C. Scott is simply brilliant and the supporting cast is top notch.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Wanted a trilogy...  Didn't know anything about the book before I got it.  After I started reading I thought I would quit before the end of the first book, I didn't because I wanted to see if it was going \\"somewhere\\".  No.  I won't read the others.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|Besides Kristen Stewart sometimes forgetting she was supposed to have an English accent, I really liked this movie, it was better than I expected. The story line was close enough to the original Snow White with still being a good story on its own. Overall I was happy I spent the $4 to rent it.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Great game. Playing on HTC EVO and the graphics are great, fast game, smooth flowing game. Will have to read more to get most out of this game.
0061015725|5.0|I have read all of M. Crichton's books, except two. That will be corrected before the year is out. I always finish his books having been immensely entertained and with the feeling that I have been educated in the science of the book.

B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is great! My son and i love to play this together. its lots and lots of fun! Definitely worth the dollar.
0425263908|5.0|I thought the book was wonderful.  I enjoyed the story line.  I had read Fifty Shades of Grey series and found this book to be better written and very enjoyable.  I am very excited for book two coming out in October of this year.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great book----and an easy read<br />As he says in the book----this was a historial event---and you get all the details from a seal who was there-----which a totally different from what The State Department put out<br />You also get an ideal of what kind of life people like this seal live----and how much they do sacrifice to do their job<br />This will be talked about in the history books in years to come
B002LFAHBO|4.0|The BluRay of Love Actually is very good, even though the extras and the packaging is not a great thing, this movie on BR is definittly good enough to have a great time, is one of the best romantic pictures

B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades of Grey was one of the best reads I've read in a long time.I literally could not put the book down,I look forward to more books in this series.
0525953728|1.0|The book was not impressive to be honest. The description of the events was not well organized. I realize that it was not written by a professional author but still it lacked the ability to keep the readers interested throughout the chapters. Also, there were several chapters that were not related to Bin Laden operation which I think were boring. Just an average book at the best.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Yes I am in a minority-better than Thriller.  This is a great package...everything posutive has been said already.  The content is 5 star.  I do agree they should have done a Blu ray version and...part of me wonders how much this is a tribute and how much it exploits his memory .  I think it pays honor to it...but it disturbs me the same people who seemed to have really not backed him in later years are putting out more product and I hope its with respect not just in the name of the dollar and also maybe, hopefully his kids will see some of the income.  For content- unbeatable...and makes watching This is It a bit sadder.  If only he had got the help he needed so much...This was Michael when he was truly Bad in a good way.

0143119680|4.0|When this book first came out, I had some interest, but not enough that it ever made it to the top of my reading list. But when Shadow of Night came out, it really peaked my interest, so I decided I needed to read Discovery of Witches so I could get to the second volume. Initially, this book was so slow, I had given up on ever getting to the second in the series. As the relationship between Diana and Matthew grew, however, the tautness of the writing and the pace of the plot picked up as well. I've read some who think Diana is too weak, but there are numerous instances where she shows her courage, so I really don't understand it. I came to liken the relationship between Diana and Matthew to that of and Claire and Jamie Fraser in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. For me, the relationship between the couples is even better than the action sequences. To be sure the Outlander series doesn't have witches, vampires and demons, but the byplay between the lead characters are what draws me--and I find those to be similar. I definitely read Shadow of Night and await the third installment.
1451627297|5.0|This was my first Stephen King novel.  I was originally scared of how long the book was - I don't read all that much.  I was suprised at how this book drew me in from the first page. I couldn't put it down! All the historic details would have normaly caused me to chunk the book because I'm not big on history, but this one drew me into it and I felt like I was actuall there! It was long to me, but every word was necessary. I loved this book and will definately be looking at reading more of Mr. King's novels!

B000F9RB9Y|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. It doesn't much bother me that the (2006) Blu-Ray is only a high rate MPEG. It did force a four (4) star rating though. The picture IS much better. However, it is apparent they didn't spend much time removing certain blemishes. The sound is great. Never heard this movie with such clarity before. The UK has a version coming out in October of this year but it is a region B release. Also, the video codec and audio are both TBA. So who knows when someone will actually give this great movie a true 'facelift' for the U.S.. Nonetheless, I'm still quite pleased with this purchase.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This is an excellent continuation of great series. This is my first time reading a Fantasy Novel so it made quite a nice impression on me. From the first book to this latest novel they are all good. It does get a little tedious with the histories of him, her and the other, plus the detailed description of evey single banner and house, uh... seriously. I found it best to just skip and continue once all that was finished. Would be great in a movie, not so much in a book. Other than that great job! I would definitely recommend this book.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|\\"Perks\\" as I shorthand it, touches that one thing that exists in all of us that identifies with a wallflower.  This book affects you and grabs you whether you're an emo kid, an introvert, a shy and quiet people-watcher, a \\"popular“ kid, or a simple but never plain wallflower.  This book moved me and gripped my being  in ways I never expected.  It reminded me that no matter how much I changed over my years since high school or how much you or anyone has or will change over the years, there is always that part of us who remains like Charlie.

B007NUP6GS|5.0|The motet format, considered basic and compulsory achievement for the Baroque era, reaches a pinnacle of excellence consistent with tradition through the work of the Monteverdi Choir under the direction of John Eliot Gardiner. This performance of Six Motets by J. S. Bach, recorded at St. John's at Smith Square in London during October 2011, will stand as example and standard for choirs reaching for performance excellence. And it seems to be within easy reach for all in the choir. No section dominates, but when one states a motif, another answers equally; balance and expression are precise and perfectly timed. The familiar chorales with repetition, counterpoint, and embellishments bring fresh appreciation for the motet for four-part or six-part minimally accompanied choir.<br /><br />The clever cover illustration, inner cover, and unique booklet/case remind the audience that this group fully grasps the intricacies of this music. Parts share equally the clarity of line and lilt, elocution, and emotion in this stellar presentation of church music.  The accompanying booklet notes by Sir Gardiner further explain the individual motets to enrich the enjoyment of the listener.<br /><br />This collection will be a valuable addition to the collection of a scholar, choir director, library, or general listener for the further appreciation of the genius of J.S. Bach.

I have from handouts from my professor, I just was so darn excited to know that this book was back in print. This is definitely a great resource! if your struggling with the figure , heads, hands or feet, and / or perspective of the body.. please spare 25 bucks and get this. Its a really great investment.

0393072231|1.0|This book was assigned as the common reading for students at SMU which essentially meant that all incoming freshman had to read it. This book was extremely boring. Unless you're interesting in majoring in finance or something along those lines, this book is probably not for you. I could get past the dull parts okay but then I began to realize how very biased the book is. Lewis spends his entire time making everyone on Wall Street look evil and completely supports those few that foresaw the crash and managed to make money off of the scandal. I would not have read this book if it was not absolutely required.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Exclent book but the regime is going to prosecute this brave patriot. This is ironic and typical of Obama Regime since the first classified leaks came from the WH
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|I had low expectations for the movie so it actually pleased me. The special effects I thought were pretty decent and the story is interesting. The things that hindered the movie to me were how the story didn't flow well at certain points.  Big jumps from a caged Snow White for years and years to where she is free and handled the change with no problem.  I mean if I was in a tower for all those years as a kid, I think I would be a bit messed up.  Also..  the Huntsman reminded me too much of Thor.  Not much acting range in those two roles.
B007SGM084|4.0|This book is great if you enjoy a steamy look into alternative sexual lifestyles. Good romance, kept me turning the pages to see what happens next in the relationship. Book three seems slower to me though I'm still interested enough to keep going.
B004GYY714|3.0|Seems like it requires a daily update, which would be fine if it was an automatic update through the Google Play site and not a required manual update through the Amazon store.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Good read. This is another great book about how we see ourselves as ordinary but we still all have a place and imprint in this world. Book will make you realize that the longer we wait to confront or fix a situation it goes on and on for no reason what so ever except we don't know what to do about it. I think at times in the book it slow and  had long periods. The ending for me at least was not expected. Our past can weigh us down just as Harold and Maureen let it do. Putting in the past, letting it go, and starting your own past is liberating.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book and couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read next two books. fastest i have ever read a book.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|The Bronte sisters have always seemed to come up as respectable classical female writers and as story telling goes, I will agree that they can tell a story.  I have notice though, that their stories have the common denominator of detailing the ugliest side of humanity.  Whether it is unconquerable cruelty or the amount of abuse it takes to break a naturally good spirit and turn it black with bitterness and spite, both Bronte stories that I have read dwell solely on the darkest aspects of life.  The only silver lining in this story is that eventually perhaps, after enough suffering, fate will turn your hand.  Eventually.  Maybe.<br /><br />If that is your thing, you will appreciate and perhaps enjoy this book.  As for myself, I prefer books that vary in sentiment.  Sometimes happy, sometimes sad, sometimes crazy, etc.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I did not think the movie would live up to the hype, but I was wrong. This movie was fun for everyone. from the little kids to grandma everyone enjoyed the movie and we have watched it several times. We cannot wait for the sequel. You must see this movie.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|I've never read a Blake Crouch novel but I'll definitely give his other works a look after finishing Pines.  It grabs you fast and doesn't let go.  In the beginning I felt it was heading down a fairly cliche path but it deviates not far after and drags you deep into mirky waters.
B000NQRE9Q|1.0|Got it for $61.99 at Costco but arrived home only to notice there's no digital,copies....who sells movies without digital copies these days...already had the fourth movie on blu ray.....so they're going back.  George Lucas is just out of touch....if I want to take the movies with me on my IPad I have to buy the entire set on iTunes $120 for both bluray and digital copies just isn't worth it.
034580404X|3.0|Having read a few too many books doesn't make me a book critic.  Thus, bearing this in mind, i must say that to me the Fifty Shades Trilogy didn't meet the high expectations deriving from the fact that it's currently a best seller. I'm a 45 year old woman and i've lived a little.  At the beginning of the first book i believed things were going to get really interesting but in the end the major thing the book deals with is with kinky sex and the falling in love of a young and rather inexperienced girl with a good looking kinky sex God... and, to myself this is \\"old news\\".<br /><br />Naturally, the vivid description of their sexual encounters was a bit arousing but in the end it's just that.  A lame love story.  And it goes out to be the same in the next two books of the trilogy.  I mean, how lame can you get? Having said this, i must confess that i really enjoyed reading this trilogy!! But then again, who doesn't like to read about love stories?!  It's such a refreshing way to take us to a different dimension and making us believe that things do always turn out right in the end, no matter the odds.<br /><br />And, quite unfortunately, we all know that that is not always true.<br /><br />Hence, reading about something we would all love to have experienced or are still entertaining the idea to experience it's rather captivating, i must say.
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle is a true American hero.  He gives tremendous insight into the many sacrifices our service men and women give for our country.  Incorporating his wife's insight into this book was genius.  Chris tells it like it is while in humbling fashion giving credit to fellow servicemen where credit is due
B006AZZPCM|3.0|I downloaded this today because Freedi Pro stopped working on my Samsung Galaxy sII Epic 4G phone. After I installed the Amazon version and launched the app, it did say there was an update. I chose Yes. I completed the action with my browser and went to the first mirror site listed and downloaded the new release. After it downloaded, I installed it and downloaded a video and saved as .mp3. It created an MP3 folder on my phone and deposited the file there. It played back fine. I give it a 3 star right now but may change it as time goes on.<br /><br />I haven't seen any porn ads or any other advertisements other than Amazon Shopping or messages to claim free prizes yet but I'll update this post if I see anything weird or suspicious about this app's behavior on my phone.<br /><br />I have the YouTube app for Android installed on my phone and I also have a YouTube account. What I see at the bottom of my screen is just suggestions for other videos on YouTube that are based on my tastes and it is keying off my account.<br /><br />My advertisement on the bottom of my phone's screen is for Amazon Shopping. So far, so good. There are other little things with the UI like their transparent button layout and the green arrow for downloading. That is kind of annoying that they display it on the screen and not in a menu format.<br /><br />It would also be good to be able to define the folder you want to save the downloaded files to. Now I have music stored in a few places on my phone and I need to consolidate them. Other than that, I'm happy with this free little application.<br /><br />Amazon, do your customers a favor and stage the latest version on your AppStore so that the updates to not confuse end-users who have installed the older version. It's a tiny file and should not take you long to replace the bits for download. Not everyone knows what a mirror site is or how to download a mobile application that downloads from a site that supports mobile devices.

B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I bought this app awhile back. It worked like a charm. Afterwards, it stopped working. No updates to my phone or new apps installed since it stopped. It searches then locates the video you are trying to find but it will not download it in any format. No error messages. It just reverts back to the search results after you try to download. Uninstall/reinstall does not work. A bugfix from the developer would be nice. Samsung Galaxy II Epic 4G - Ice Cream Sandwich.

1250010489|5.0|Like so many of this terrific book's early reviewers, I have known Mark for many years. (Mark is a celebrity of significant note within the Computer industry.) But I only knew that Mark could write world-class code. I had no idea that he could also write world class novels. And being artful at one certainly doesn't suggest any strong talent for the other. So being very picky, I worried when Mark sent an early copy of his first novel, \\"Zero Day\\". I wanted to like it and worried that I might not. So I'll just say that I wasn't the least bit worried, I was delighted, when he sent an early copy of novel #2.<br /><br />If you haven't yet read \\"Zero Day\\" you don't really need to, but I loved that Mark told this second story through the eyes of the two protagonists whom he introduced and developed throughout his first work of fiction. So by all means, click the purchase button above, but if you haven't already read \\"Zero Day\\", why not begin at the beginning?<br /><br />Today, everyone understands that modern \\"connected\\" life requires some concern for online privacy and security. If you know very little about the details of how bad things happen to people online, you'll find Mark's stories compelling from that standpoint: They explain this clearly and intelligibly, wrapped around exciting narratives that bring those details to life. And if, on the other hand, you know your way around computer security, you'll find Mark's stories not only compelling but also technically perfect.<br /><br />I am so glad that Mark decided to share his imagination and storytelling talent with the world. Once you have read Mark's novels I'll bet you find yourself recommending them to others as well. I certainly have.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|If you enjoyed Demo Dick's books, you will enjoy this.<br />If you are expecting a book about the Osama Mission, as its supposed to be, you will be very disappointed.<br /><br />Only the very end of the book gives you this guys account of how the Osama mission went down.<br />The rest is stories of how I became a SEAL, how difficult it was, why I became a SEAL and a few while I was a SEAL stories prior to the Osama mission.<br /><br />As a whole I enjoyed the book, but its not a book about the Mission, its a book about a SEAL who was on the Osama Mission and it has a chapter or two at the end of the book giving his version of how things went down that day.
0385344333|4.0|Im confused about the negativity- I thought this was one of the better reacher novels.  (and i've read everyone at least 2-3 times.  People complain about nothing happening?  The first 1/3 of the book was incredibly tense.  Maybe because it is more suspense than action?  But man, I couldnt turn the pages fast enough.  Really, give this book a chnace.  It was a GREAT read!!!
B007FEFLTO|1.0|I have to agree with others' objections to the price. Kindle rates were purportedly rolling back from recent highs of $15-16, and now this at $20? While I'm looking forward to the new installment (and to other popular writers' new releases), $15-20 for an e-book is absurd. I can wait.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Seriously, it was JUST ok, maybe a little disappointing even.<br /><br />There were some decent effects but it was more like one big fight scene from start to finish. Not much \\"story\\" to this.<br /><br />Perseus gets beaten to a pulp and even being a demi-god wouldn't have healed him enough that quickly to keep going after taking such abuse at the hands of his brother in their last fight - especially considering the injuries he'd gotten up to that point. Would it?  I guess it depends on what you the viewer accept about the demi-gods. And after Perseus manages to somehow get inside of Kronos/Cronus and back out again - you get the impression that Kronos/Cronus was killed by the weapon.  But that same weapon was used on him by his powerful \\"god\\" sons before and they only managed to trap him in Tartarus. (So if you're going to \\"think\\" about this movie instead of just accepting it as it comes - you'll probably enjoy it less than someone who doesn't care)<br /><br />Also, so much of the movie is dirt and dust (drab color) that I was thirsty and feeling the need to shower just watching it.<br /><br />It wasn't horrible, but (I) wouldn't really recommend it either.

B008Y2IU12|4.0|CONS<br />Somebody wasn't very good about the details in this movie - young snow white had medium brown hair instead of \\"hair as dark as a raven\\" (and you see this RIGHT after the narrator is saying her description) and on top of that, instead of \\"skin as white as snow\\" she had freckles!  And they don't even make her lips red. The older snow white does have dark hair but they still didn't redden her lips - went with a more natural rosy mauve.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, the online picture quality for some reason was not very good (might have to buy a BR-DVD disk instead of watching this online).<br /><br />PROS:<br />Good special effects - the evil queen has some pretty awesome powers<br />Charlize Theron gives an excellent performance as the evil queen in this, and Kristen Stewart (SW) and Chris Hemsworth (the huntsman) are good too.<br /><br />It was a little long but I enjoyed this and absolutely recommend.<br /><br />======<br /><br />STORY:<br />Queen finds a rose in the winter, goes to pluck it and instead is pricked.  Some of her blood falls on the white snow and she decides it looks so pretty and hopes that if she has a daughter that her skin is white as snow, with lips as red as blood, hair dark as a ravens wings (the queen herself has black hair and fair skin), and that her daughter has the strength of that rose she couldn't pluck.  Later on she is blessed with a beautiful daughter like this.  Perhaps 7-8 years later the queen dies (doesn't say of what) and a \\"dark\\" foe draws the king into battle.  When they are killed, these soldiers break into dark shards - they are clearly not natural.  When the battle is over the king finds what appears to be a prisoner of the foe, all chained up and dirty like a prisoner - but she is beautiful and he marries her immediately.  On their wedding night she reveals her hatred for men and kills him and lets in her brother and her real army and they take over the kingdom.  Snow White (SW) tries to escape and ends up being locked in the north tower (as her blood/life may be useful to this dark queen at some point.)  And the land of the kingdom suffers under of evil and neglect (so everything appears to be covered with ash/soot or is mud, the plants all dead.<br /><br />One day an attempt is made on the evil queens life and when she uses her magic to kill the would-be murderer it drains her beauty and her powers.  And on this day the mirror tells the queen that SW is surpassing her beauty and becoming the fairest of the land (which threatens her powers) but if she takes her heart she will never again weaken or age -  basic immortality.<br /><br />The evil queen sends her brother to fetch SWs heart. SW manages to wound him and escapes into the dark forest - where the queen has no powers.  She promises a huntsman that if he brings her SW, she can give him back his beloved deceased wife with her powers. And so begins the story...g locked in the north tower (as her blood/life may be useful to this dark queen at some point.)

B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn knows how to write broken people with flawed lives with the sort of raw, human honesty that few writers even approach
067960085X|5.0|A young aspiring writer moves to an appartment in an old building on Upper East Side, NY, where he meets a very young neighbor, the eccentric Holy Golightly. She carries a reckless life, and her appartment hosts constant wild parties - with lots of guys and few girls - and seems to make a living on the presents she gets from friends and admirers from the show business, although she also makes a few bucks for weekly visits to a Mafia boss in Sing-Sing prison. Through several incidents, the writer and Holy develop a bumpy friendship, and in between crazy episodes he learns about Holy's past life, a sordid affair which she seems to have overcome with an amazing self-assuredeness and a good nature which captivates many people's affection, in spite of her absolute irresponsiblity and lack of scruples. This brief novel is written as a reminiscence, begun as the narrator steps in a tavern he used to frequent with Holy, many years ago, when the barman tells him a strange story which might imply that Holy has left her indelible footprint in Africa. It is truly a remarkable piece of literature, in which there shines an unforgettable character. Raw innocence, understood as the ignorance of social rules and the processing of emotions as they come, with total liberty, is the essence of Holy. It is an endearing tale worth every word, and suitable for re-reading.<br /><br />The volume is completed by three other, and also excellent, tales: \\"House of Flowers\\", about an orphaned Haitian prostitute; \\"A Diamond Guitar\\", about an old convict in Alabama who falls in love with a young Cuban guitar player and who, for a moment, is able to enjoy freedom and love; and \\"A Christmas Memory\\", a masterwork about the remembrances of a man who grew up, orphan and shy, in a farm, with the only friendship of an aunt, a charming woman-child with whom he spends his only good moments. Although less famous than \\"Breakfast...\\", it is as unforgettable as that one.
B00005JPKE|5.0|WARNING: Spoilers Ahead!<br /><br />- The special effects of the deaths in the battle field are vividly real.<br /><br />- There are many scenes dealing with human psychology. They made me feel unsettled, and deeply touched. They also showed that the enemies were not always inhumane. For example, in one scene, a Japanese officer ordered his doctor to help a U.S. prisoner. In another scene, some U.S. killed 2 Japanese who surrendered to revenge their buddies' death.<br /><br />- There are many extremely disturbing scenes depicting the fanatic of many Japanese officers and soldiers who prefer suicide to surrendering. In another scene, a soldier lying to his officer about shooting a barking dog and was savagely beaten.<br /><br />- It got an Oscar in 2007 for Best Achievement in Sound Editing,<br /><br />- In short, this is one of the BEST that MY MONEY CAN GET in terms of war movies with characters' depth

Watanabe then gets enrolled in a second-class college in Tokyo, where he renews a friendship with Naoko, the dead boy's ex-girlfriend, with whom he falls in love, only to discover that she has a psychological problem. There's also another relationship of Watanabe's, with a girl called Midori, the emotonal opposite of Naoko's.<br /><br />There's much to spoil by summing up the plot, but it's important to point out that all of the characters, including the most tragic ones, have attractive qualities. Even for a novel in which an excessive quantity of suicides take place, love for life is always present. In the midst of so much tragedy, the naration has humoristic undertones and several comic passages. Watanabe is a good guy, who slowly learns to live and be balanced, in spite of (or thanks to) early fierce shocks. Another constant presence is explicit sex, and a good portrait od Japan in the 1970's.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|This is a truly remarkable game pad! I have been a die-hard Nostromo Speed Pad user for years, but I needed something with more flexibility. The G13 delivers where it counts, and took my gaming to the next level. Here's the breakdown:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Comfort: I can't stress how comfortable the G13 is. I have average-sized hands, and the curves are perfect. I was worried that it would be too shallow like wave keyboards, but it was actually perfect.<br />- (Honestly) Mac Compatible: The drivers are truly Mac compatible, and the software is not a half-baked thrown-together mess like some manufacturers produce just to call their products Mac friendly (cough, Razer, cough, Cyborg, cough).<br />- Backlight: I really like that the backlighting is adjustable (both color and intensity). I'm also a big fan of the button to turn the backlighting off with one press.<br />- LCD Display: Okay, I'll be honest, I thought it was a gimmick. It does have some great apps baked in though, like the clock, iTunes control and timers.<br />- Joystick Fluidity: I never used the d-pad on my Nostromo because it simply was not a viable WASD replacement. The joystick has completely replaced WASD for me! The movement is smooth, and when you change turning left and turning right to strafing left and right, you have a mind-bogglingly nimble control system at hand.<br /><br />CONS<br />- Joystick Press: This is a fail, and a pretty big one at that. The joystick has a button that can act as a jump when you press it \\"down.\\" The resistance is simply way too high, and the responsiveness is badly delayed. I had to assign jump to another button to have a reliable jump again.<br />- Waking from Sleep (PC only): More often than not, I had trouble with the G13 not waking up when my PC would wake from a standard sleep. The screen would display the \\"G13\\" splash, and would have to be unplugged and plugged back in to reset it. (FYI: it was not plugged into a hub, and I have not had problems with other devices not waking.) Your mileage may vary, but this was at least my experience.<br />- Price: I bought it on sale when Amazon ran a special on it for $60, which is a fair price. The list price of $80 is simply too high, especially when you consider how many years the G13 has been on the market.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Why haven't you bought one yet!? I waited [wasted] years of better gaming by passing on this.ices not waking.)

0316069884|5.0|This book made me think back to grade school history when I first learned about journalist exposing the horrors of meat farming. Their works in the 1900s sparked mass concern, but not for the animals or for the workers -- for the safety of our food.<br /><br />However, this book makes it impossible to ignore what happens to animals and workers in the advent of factory farming.<br /><br />This book will open your eyes, whether you've never considered what happens before or you believe you eat humanely raised meat. This book is a must-read for anyone concerned for the health of our environment, the health of yourself/loved ones, animals rights or world food & health issues.<br /><br />This book does not beat your head with a side you must \\"join\\". The author has a lot of sympathy towards meat eaters, but states he is vegetarian. The \\"answer\\" or solution the book poses is open ended and left for you to decide.<br /><br />But, I must say -- I can't ever eat another strip of bacon again.<br /><br />P.S. He doesn't talk about eating insects -- something I think would be an interesting (but less popular) read.<br /><br />P.S.S. I did lose interest about 75% through the book. It starts to get repetitive like \\"Yah, I know now.\\" It picks back up near the end, though.

B0091XRTTM|3.0|This movie was cute at times but on the whole a disappointment.  The story had potential but its execution was plagued with hackneyed devices and unjustified negative portrayals of real historical figures (Darwin, Queen Victoria).  Jokes meant to please parents while keeping the kids engaged were at times cute but not sufficient to save the movie.  We got tired during the movie and chose to stop watching, which we just don't do if the film is keeping our interest.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|In spite of all the controversy, I recommend this book.  It is non-political.  It acquaints the American Citizen, especially those unfamiliar with the inside operations of the military and special forces, with the dedication, hard work, personal commitment and sacrifice of so many ordinary Americans to the service of this Nation and its people.  The complexity of operations like the mission that killed Bin Laden become apparent.  The years of training, the willingness to put life and limb on the line, the dedication of numerous personnel with various skills to ensure that justice was done to this murdering terrorist all come to the surface.  No one individual becomes the hero.  All of the people involved, whether trainers or analysts, Seals or helicopter pilots, whether present for the actual operation or not, are the heros.  So I recommend the book.

0307352145|1.0|Susan Cain has written an important book, perhaps one of the most important books on personality in the past year. Human nature is much like a fractal in that we are an infinitely regressing pattern of ourselves across time -- we tend to commit the same mistakes, experience the same rewards, and behave the same way across a multitude of situations. More important, Cain reveals the most important fact: no personality characteristics are wrong! Period. Evolutionary biology and psychology dictate variation in personality is a function of optimal environments, with certain traits thriving in one environment over another. Extraverts tend to thrive when everyone is an introvert, allowing them to ascend to command. However, when too many extraverts exist then introverts begin to thrive because the extraverts are too busy engaging risky situations, competing with one another, and essentially killing themselves off (Nettle, 2007).<br /><br />However, I am also greatly saddened by two huge logical fallacies in Cain's book: 1) correlation does not equal causation, and 2) multiple competing causes. The first fallacy, correlation does not equal causation, is a natural bias in human thinking. It happens when two evens co-occur together and we automatically assume one must cause the other. Her book is brimming with fallacy. She states without introverts we would not have: the theory of relativity, Chopin's nocturnes, The Cat in the Hat, and Google. While not directly stating it, she is constantly implying introversion = innovation and masterful skills. Yes, introverts may tend to prefer solitude which may, in turn, allow them to accomplish greater feats. However, it is \\"practice\\" and \\"focus\\" then which cause these outcomes, not introversion. Practice and focus require motivation, role modeling, intelligence, feedback, and dogged determination. Further, for everyone of her cherry-picked examples you could make the claim without extraverts we wouldn't have 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Old Man and the Sea, or Carl Sagan's Cosmos.<br /><br />Second, personality is a multidimensional domain (there are other factors besides extraversion). It is unlikely any of these people accomplished things by being introverted. Rather, a more scientifically supported explanation is that they are high on the trait known as Conscientiousness, which refers to people who are orderly, organized, industrious, and well-controlled. It has also been called the \\"work\\" trait because conscientious people are more likely to fulfill their responsibilities in life. Furthermore, there are other factors such as emotional stability, openness to experience, and agreeableness which work together to jointly determine our unique way of being. I understand she is using these anecdotes to merely make a point introverts are under appreciated, but she simultaneously ignores the litany of other personality traits which help us thrive and succeed in different circumstances.<br /><br />Overall, I love what she is trying to do and appreciate the book for its empowering effect for all of us introverts out there. Introverts, like extraverts, are both important qualities to human society. As a responsible scientific writer, however, I believe she has presented a very skewed depiction of personality in the world by failing to provide a balanced picture of all the other personality characteristics which contribute to \\"valued skills\\" as she calls them. I know this is not her point, but she ends up making many conclusions which simply aren't true. Introversion is related to social functioning, that is about it. It doesn't tell us how well we will acquire skills (more about intelligence), how responsible we are (more about conscientiousness), how well we work on a team (more about agreeableness), nor good ideas (which is more about being an expert in a field combined with collective learning, empowerment, and risk-taking in organizations; e.g., IKEA) Anyone reading this book should keep in mind you are not \\"just an introvert\\" but a collection of other traits which contribute to your health and well-being in society.re not \\"just an introvert\\" but a collection of other traits which contribute to your health and well-being in society.

It gives a step by step account of the mission that killed Bin Laded and also puts into light what it takes to be a SEAL Team Six operator. No better way to know what actually happened that night than to hear it from someone who was there. Great read!!!!!

0439023521|4.0|I definitely see why this book has gotten so much attention. It's quite a riveting story, and while at times it seems almost too much \\"made for movie,\\" I still found myself identifying with the heroine and wondering what I would do in her unimaginably awful circumstances.<br /><br />The story brings up age-old questions: Under what life-threatening circumstances does someone turn from human to animal? Why do two people in the same situation react so differently? Why, in the darkest of times, do the simplest acts of humanity move us so?<br /><br />The amount of violence was wrenching, and I can't bring myself to read the sequel(s). It also troubles me that adolescents seem to have such a voracious appetite for these dark themes and topics.

B002K0WBXW|5.0|This has to be one of the silliest, least believable romcoms I have ever seen... and I loved it!<br /><br />The whole premise is ridiculous, crazy, beyond silly. Basically any synonym you want to find for \\"this is unrealistic even by romcom standards\\" would fit in here.<br /><br />However: it works.<br /><br />For me, there are two reasons. First is the beautiful scenery - this is not Alaska, but Massachusetts does make a beautiful stand in, and the scenery adds considerably to the otherworldiness and sense of romance of the film.<br /><br />The second, and by far the most important reason, is that Bullock and Reynolds have absolutely wonderful chemistry. They're both attractive people to start with, and both possess the comic timing and comedy chops to shine in any script that errs on the side of silly. Put them both together, though, and things get exponentially better; they are funny and believable and sweet as a mismatched pretend couple who find that pretending has unforeseeable consequences.<br /><br />If you're after a film that's remotely true to life, steer a wide berth - you'll likely hate this. It's silly, unrealistic, and sweet enough to rot your teeth.<br /><br />If, however, you want to laugh till your throat hurts and be swept away into an alternate, much fluffier, much more romantic reality, as far as lighter than air confectionary goes, this is pure escapism and genuinely funny. For its particular genre? It's pitch perfect.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This was a great find, I'm really happy with the app in general, wish there was more description on what kinds of sounds/extras you get with the paid version, and I really wish the program would run in the background so I could listen and *read* on my kindle fire (hence 4 instead of 5) but sounds are amazing quality, and my battery isn't dead in the morning. I'm thrilled XD
B008C40218|5.0|Oh man this is excellent.  For me, the last couple releases have just been okay--I don't think Calexico can make a bad album, but the songs bled together too much for me, and things felt a little complacent--but this one seems like the most alive since \\"Feast of Wire\\" and \\"Convict Pool,\\" two of my favorites.  There's a great variety of songs here that cohere to suggest a larger narrative.  The instrumental title track is a standout, and \\"The Fortune Teller\\" may be the most unapologetically beautiful Calexico song ever.  HIghly recommended.

He also should be tried and punished for the purposeful leaks of false misinformation regarding our real heroes and the great job they did! Then they had the gall to suggest the Seal author had broken his oath by telling the truth about what really happened. Doesn't say much for the integrity of Obama!

B008LZHA3G|5.0|Bob Dylan<br /><br />Tempest<br />(2012 CD)<br /><br />As a songwriter, this CD shows that Dylan is still among the very best.  However, you will have to look for the lyrics online to catch what the lyrics are.  The lyrics are not included with this CD and it will take some concentrated effort to figure out what they are from Dylan's vocals.<br /><br />As to Dylan's singing, his apocalyptic mumble is perhaps both the best and worst thing about the album.  There is something inherently enjoyable about Dylan's barely decipherable voice in this latter part of his career, but that voice hides the power of his amazing lyrics.<br /><br />This CD begins with a little intro that belongs in one of Dylan's \\"Old Time Radio Shows\\", and then proceeds to sound like some ancient blues record that is so scratchy as to be barely understandable (and, again, it is not the recording but the voice that is barely understandable here).<br /><br />Once you tease out what the lyrics are, you will find a wide range of subjects and metaphors worthy of Dylan's best.  For me, \\"Pay in Blood\\" and the title track are the highlights of the album.  The album closes with \\"Roll on John\\": Dylan's musings on John Lennon's life and death.<br /><br />As to there only being 10 songs on this CD, the songs are long and there is no feeling of this being a `short' album.<br /><br />This CD is both frustrating and fascinating, but after listening to it several times now, I have come to love it.  Five Stars.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is not the usual type of book that I read, but I found it interesting.  I especially wanted to know how they got Bin Laden.  I do not think it gave away any secrets because it was very general in the information given about the units.  We have every reason to be proud of our Navy SEALS.  I do think it is typical of our politically correct government that they now have to give warning and take away their most valuable secret weapon---surprise.  This is ludicrous. It was a well written account of the history that our great grandchildren will be reading.

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|First a couple of notes to those who have never seen this production on DVD.  The characters do not all have moles on their foreheads, but microphones.  If seen live, I don't think the microphones could have been seen at all.  I just ignore them just like I ignore the concert style mics used in the Royal Albert Hall, 25th Anniversary production.  Also, there are many discrepancies in time line and in character and even in plot from the live production and the movie.  I am as willing to suspend disbelief for this production just as I did for the book, the old movies and Andrew Lloyd Webber's fantastic play.<br />It is not quite as good as the original Phantom.  The music is as beautiful, but the lyrics are not  as good as the the original Lloyd Webber Phantom.  Every once in a while, the lyrics jar a bit.<br /><br />***Spoiler below***<br />However, I have read the lyrics to the original Love Never Dies, and this is a great improvement and not just in lyrics.  From what I can tell from reading those lyrics, the original play had a catastrophically bad ending.  Thank goodness the folks in Australia did quite a bit of \\"cleaning up.\\"  I am not happy with the current ending, but at least I can use my imagination and change it.<br />Mr. Lewis who plays the Phantom is a bit melodramatic in his acting, more like the acting in an opera which, like everything else, is subordinate to the voice of the singer.<br /><br />All of the above being said, this is a wonderful musical and a wonderful production.  I wish I could have seen it in Australia to get a much better vision of the working of the sets which I found very impressive.  The singing was magnificent and the music was as good as any by LLoyd Webber (and certainly better than JC Superstar).  Mr. Lewis has a wonderful baritone which I have always preferred to tenor anyway.  Ms O'Bryne has a beautiful voice also.  Her makeup is a bit heavy, but probably not for a theater and she is as beautiful as the Phantom thinks she is.  Maria Mercedes has a wonderful (if short) solo which shows she can belt them out as well as any Broadway legend.<br /><br />I was not happy with it when I first saw it, but since then it has become an addiction and I watch it almost every day - and it gets better each time I watch it.  Ben Lewis is very good looking as the Phantom (with his mask on) and not as bad as the orignal Phantom, but worse than Gerard Butler in the movie, with it off.  You have to be able to stop the DVD at just the right spot to see him.<br /><br />Whatever it's flaws this Andrew Lloyd Webber step child is a beautiful work with soaring music and singing.  It also has a very sexy duo between the Phantom and Christine that is more explicit than Past the Point of No Return.<br /><br />Anyway, I now love it as much as the original Phantom which I have in three versions:  the movie, the Royal Albert Hall 25th anniversary production and the original cast album.  But this Phantom is a very calculating and dangerous man, but still more worthy of Christine than the other two.  He is less hot headed and a little more sane than the previous Phantoms.Maria Mercedes has a wonderful (if short) solo which shows she can belt them out as well as any Broadway legend.<br /><br />I was not happy with it when I first saw it, but since then it has become an addiction and I watch it almost every day - and it gets better each time I watch it.

1439102430|3.0|\\"And when she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby wept. So she had compassion on him,\\" -- Exodus 2:6 (NKJV)<br /><br />Before discussing this story, let me just note that if you find it hard to read books about cruel things happening to babies ... skip this one. I mention that just because so many detection books today contain details that many people don't want to read ... and are there mostly for plot purposes, rather than for educating or uplifting the reader.<br /><br />If you like unusual plots with unexpected connections among characters and events, you'll think Bones Are Forever is imaginative. In fact, you may be quite impressed by how your sympathies for various characters change during the course of the book.<br /><br />If you want the Tempe parts of the story to be personally engaging and to develop the character, you'll be disappointed in many places. If you also want some surprises about her role in the story, you may also be disappointed. If you like fascinating forensics, I doubt if this book will be the top of your list.<br /><br />If I had known what I know now, I doubt if I would have read the book. But don't let me run you away from it. It may just be that I like different kinds of stories than you do.<br /><br />I find the aspects of these stories where she is victimized to be annoying. If you do too, prepare to be annoyed.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have never seen a stage production of Phantom and since I am becoming a Phantom junkie, I down loaded this production which is marvelous and beautiful.  Mr. Karimloo and Ms Boggess have wonderful voices - as good as Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman from the original cast album.  This is as close to perfect as I have ever seen any musical done.<br /><br />Anyone who likes great music and fantastic singing really should get this production which, besides The Phantom itself, includes a tribute to The Phantom and to Lloyd Webber with many people from other productions.  Sarah Brightman sings and four other Phantoms sing also.  The Royal Albert Hall and the staging were almost enough by themselves to watch it.<br /><br />However I have two small maybe picky things I did not like.<br />The Phantoms costumes looked like something Oscar Wilde would have enjoyed wearing, and I really hated wharever it was supposed to be that he played on the organ.  It didn't sound like music, it sounded like an assault on the ears.  Stupid complaints maybe, but they both seemed to detract something from the aura of the Phantom.<br /><br />That's the 1% I didn't like, but the other 99% is wonderful.

After running out of other things I suggested we watch the two episodes of GOT that HBO had sent us. We were hooked and completely blown away. Unfortunately we didn't have the HBO channel and it wasn't out on DVD yet, so I picked up the first book so I could keep up with it. The book is just as good as the show. In fact, watching the first two episodes helped me get into the book because there are a lot of characters, and a lot of detail, so knowing who was who kind of got me up to speed. This type of fantasy book is not typically my cup of tea but it's just such a well told story, over all. It's more like historical fiction with a touch of fantasy than a straight up fantasy novel. It's really engaging and a page turner. I usually like quick reads because I'm typically busy but this book was so good I was willing to stick it out. I would say it is probably a bit more like Excaliber than The Hobbit but in an epic, serial kind of way. I really don't think you need to be a fantasy reader to enjoy this book, just a lover of a good fiction.

030771652X|5.0|When Beatrice Hemming gets the call from her mum that sister Tess is missing, she immediately boards a plane from New York, heading to London.  For the two sisters have always been close, connected by experiences, losses, and so much more.<br /><br />[[ASIN:030771652X Sister: A Novel]] is not just a story about the connections between them, but a harrowing journey into darkness, despair, fear, and death.  The suspense kept me reading frantically, especially as I neared the end and could only hope for the ending I wanted.<br /><br />Narrated in Beatrice's first person voice, and in the form of a letter to her sister, she alternately tells the story in the present tense and then in the past tense.<br /><br />Something about this style seems to enhance the sense of secrets just waiting to burst out from behind the shrouds that cloak them.<br /><br />What does Beatrice discover almost immediately after arriving at Tess's flat?  How does the impact of the news color all the events that follow?  And will the curious clinical trials that the pregnant Tess was undergoing impact the ultimate discoveries that Beatrice will make?<br /><br />I felt very invested in Beatrice and Tess and their stories.  I wanted desperately for things to turn out.  And even as the police, a psychiatrist, and numerous others (including Beatrice's fiance) chide Beatrice and lament that she is suspicious when the answers are obvious, I could not wait for them all to be wrong.<br /><br />In some ways, the ending felt wrong.  I didn't want any hint that things were not the way they seemed.  Could the  whole story have been an imagining?  Or was it real and just the way it unfolded in Beatrice's mind?  I loved this book...and can't wait to read another by this talented author who hooked me from the very beginning.  Five stars.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Wonderful sequel to Phantom of the Opera. Movie also included great interviews from the cast. Andrew Lloyd Webber doesn't disappoint.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I pre-ordered this book six months before its release, and had great expectations of it.  I considered Follett's previous works of fiction, including Fall of Giants, Pillars of the Earth and World without End, to be gripping masterpieces.  In Winter of the World, the stories are interesting and readable, and the historical background research meticulous as is usual for Ken Follett.  However, I found the characters in Winter of the World to be considerably less fleshed-out, and dialogue often less believable, than in any of the seven books I have read previously by the same author.  In addition, I found the large number of coincidental meetings between the characters to be excessive.  I certainly do not regret reading the book, but it was a disappointment compared to Follett's previous work.<br /><br />Another gripe:  this $19.99 ebook does not have \\"real page numbers\\" enabled! There is simply no excuse for this shortcoming in a premium-priced book like this one,or in any Kindle book in 2012, for that matter.

1475143389|5.0|As someone who has been in and out of the gym (and basement where some home exercise equipment resides) for over 25 years, the more time I spent thinking about and researching training and nutrition, the more time I wasted and the more execuses I came up with.  Most of the execuses were around confusion, too much time required, too much meal planning, etc.  After reading \\"Bigger, Leaner, Stronger\\", I decided it was time to take action.  I wouldn't consider myself part of the group of Americans that have chosen to sit around and do nothing about my health and fitness.  However, as a traveling executive, my schedule always got in the way of consistent exercise and healthy eating.  I like to run, and am currently training for a Ragnar Relay, so I do take the time (although inconsistently) to exert myself.  At 50, I'm not disgusted by my health and condition, but I certainly don't have one of those bodies that make people ask how I stay in such good shape either.  Mike's willingness to share his research and actual experience is a gift to those of us looking for practical guidance.  He takes on the mainstream opinions and marketing tactics, exposing what many of us have struggled with; most of what you read is driven by the desire to sell you more stuff.  In this book, Mike takes the time to share what he has learned, backed by sound research and more importantly his own experience, demystifying much of what we need to know to be successful.  In addition, the bonus report he provides gives you a practical plan for your first 12-months.  It doesn't get any easier than that!  If you believe that success can be achieved through simplicity, this is the book for you.  Simplicity does not imply that the book is not based upon science, but instead is focused on \\"netting it out\\".  In addition, I reached out to Mike via email, immediately after finishing the book, as I had some questions about nutrition and cutting versus bulking.  Mike replied within 24 hours, and continued tofollow up over the next three days.  That's committment and he seems like a really nice (and certainly knowledgeable) guy to boot!

B00402FGEE|5.0|That heading is very brave and bold, so I need to try and justify it. First of all, to let you see where I am coming from,I love Sci-Fi, and have every Stargate episode ever made, except the follow on to this series. I am just about to view the last disc in this set, and thought that would be it, but no, there is more to come. I will be interested to see if it is justified, because , without yet seeing the last three episodes, I thought this series was going to be a single story, told in a full series arc.<br /><br />Why do I make the above claim? As others have noted, it is a complete departure from the style of quality sci-fi the other 10 plus 5 series have brought us. The previous series (SG-1 and Atlantis) have been series where you can sit back and be entertained by good stories, good acting spiced with humour, and, for me, good enough to buy them all to see again (and again?). It is only recently we got to start watching SGU in Blu-ray (I don't think it has been screened here).<br /><br />When it started it was obviously totally different in mood and construction to what we have seen in the other series. It is one story, serious, deep in its psychology, and adventurous in structure. We have been watching three episodes a night, so you can sustain the mood better than an watching an episode a week. It starts out quite blandly, and initially I thought I was going to be disappointed. But as you virtually live with the series, you see it is a character study of how people may react if incompatible characters are forced to live together in isolation (to generalise - the military members and the civilian members of a group of people who went through a Stargate and found they had reached the wrong destination: a vast, complicated starship, clearly built be an earlier civilization thousands of years ago, and they have no way to return to where they came from. They are forced to find out how to operate, to a degree, this vast ship, and try and live together with little hope of ever reaching earth).<br /><br />This is not essentially an adventure series, but a character study of human interactions in an impossible situation. If the viewer really wants to derive from this series what it really contains, he/she must be prepared to think about what is happening, to discuss with others what you think has occurred in the episode you just watched (at times), even watch an episode a second time to get a grasp on events. Any viewer who doesn't see this, is missing what the series is all about.<br /><br />Most television series are very much in the control of accountants who are not prepared to take risks. So they stick to tired old formulas until even the least critical of viewer says \\"I've had enough of this rubbish\\". Then they try to find another formula, similar to what has succeeded before, and try that. This is why commercial television is such a wasteland to the viewer who wants to be entertained, but wants to be made to think as well.<br /><br />I suspect, that Stargate has proved such a success, the producers, when presented with the concept and brilliant writing of this series thought \\"...well, we have had a good run with Stargate, we can afford to risk something different, something outside the sphere of normal television viewing, something that requires a bit of intellect (sounds snobbish, but isn't meant to be; it's just a fact that you need to be prepared to THINK about this series if you are going to understand it) - and so the risk was taken.<br /><br />As I said the series starts slowly and unimpressively, but with each episode, it continues to build - relentlessly. I can't wait for the last three episodes, and, now knowing there is a second series, I am ecstatic and disappointed at the same time. It is so good, I want to see more, but if the first series ended the story, I think it would be more intellectually satisfying.<br /><br />So, have I justified my claim? I don't know. SUBJECTIVELY, I think it is virtually perfect. OBJECTIVELY, when you see that this is one story, beautifully constructed as it develops, more complications occur, and the cast need to show significant depths of their characters; with excellent photography, design, editing, lighting, music all supporting the outstanding writing and performances of all the cast, it is hard to find fault But I say again, it is definitely not commercial. If you have watched this and not found it complicated at various times; not been fascinated by the character study of the diverse people forced to live together in impossible and isolated circumstances, then you have missed the whole purpose of the series. This is a sci-fi series that could appeal to viewers who normally avoid the genre, but on finding that rare series, one that activates the mind, may well enjoy it.<br /><br />Most people watch television just to turn off and relax. To be passably entertained, with no reason to give much thought to the previous night's viewing. If you fall into that category, as most do, having little to do with intelligence. Some of the most intelligent people watch light-weight TV so that they can turn off and wind down. But, at times, there are viewers who want a series that does engage the mind - they are the viewers who are going to derive quite a lot from this series.<br /><br />Now, if I have sounded elitist, I am sorry, but I am just stating what I see as fact. A person is not elitist if they comment that, generally speaking Shakespeare is not for the masses, because it's a fact we all know. I wouldn't compare SGU with Shakespeare, but it does have some of his qualities. And it is good to see a series that is character driven and a study of human nature rather than yet another action series (although Stargate has always maintained a good balance here.<br /><br />So that's it. I have tried to show when I have been objective and when I have been subjective, but how well I have succeeded only you, the reader, can tell.<br />POST-SCRIPT. After that terribly long review, I must add that I have just watched the final disc, to find that a new dimension has been added to the story. I am anxious to see if the second series is good enough to justify it being made. If it turns into an action series, it will spoil the character of this series. So I wait with anticipation. It is likely that if anyone reads this, they will already have seen the final series and know that answer. By the way, this is a series that REALLY benefits from a projection system. The big screen helps to emphasise the loneliness and loss (and the small-font titles imply it was made for a big screen.).

B003BVFZ4G|4.0|A world where we're hooked on reality TV, caring more about the outcome of a game show than an election. Watching people do wretched things to themselves and others (hello Fear Factor, Wipe Out and Cops), while environmental problems start affecting people. Treating the poor as slightly less than human...did Stephen King have a crystal ball in the 1980s when he wrote The Running Man?<br /><br />Granted, this book is much more extreme, but it's a real wake-up call about what society can become.<br /><br />A good read. Recommended. And nothing like the movie!

This band doesn't have a drip of that original inspiration and creativeness left. This album just drug on and on for me, no real emotion or originality and I do believe I have finally rode the Anselmo wagon to the point that it can no longer carry even his own ego. I would not recommend this album to anyone unless they wanted to have a comparative basis on what to never purchase for me.

B008J34466|4.0|What a journey Pink has taken! Starting as an R&B queen with \\"Can't Take Me Home\\", and then quickly turning to pop with \\"Missundaztood\\". She tried her hand at rock with \\"Try This\\", but later chose the dance/pop scene with her best album \\"I'm Not Dead\\". Then after a separation from Carey Hart, she became a jack of all trades with \\"Funhouse\\". And to top it all off, after re-uniting with Carey and giving birth to her first child, she released \\"Greatest Hits...So Far!!!\\" which captured all of her best moments and wrapped them all up in a nice little package. While she has taken more musical directions than any other pop artist of her generation, the problem that arises with this is: what more can she do to get even better? And that's the initial frustration with \\"The Truth About Love\\". It includes mainly hard rock with a hint of Ke$ha-esque pop, so it is an unfortunate fact that just like the last time she made an album like this (Try This), \\"The Truth About Love\\" will not generate many chart topping singles. True, she lucks out with one of the best songs of her career (Blow me one last kiss), and she even includes her trademark boldness (Slut Like You and Walk of Shame). She once again shines with her self-help anthems (Are We All We Are and The Great Escape), and then comes her straightforward tales of love (True Love, The Truth About Love, and Try). She covers all of her basics, and even throws in her straight out silliness (How Come You're Not Here?). But that's the problem, as good as this music is, it's hard to deny that Pink has finally become predictable. She swears like a sailor, she makes you feel great about yourself, she harks about the hardships of life and love, and then she lets loose and sings about the joy of just having fun. And while she showcases her best duets since \\"I'm Not Dead\\" and also fianlly conquers the challenge of a slow ballad, there are none of the instant hooks that Pink is known for. While \\"I'm Not Dead\\" and \\"Funhouse\\" were as addictiveand pop-py as all great pop should be, \\"The Truth About Love\\" does not instantly catch your eye. It will take a few listens, and in the end you still may not pick up the buried hooks, but with its faults, \\"The Truth About Love\\" is an album that music NEEDS this day and age, and it is undeniably the most adventurous and fearless album of 2012.

B008I3R2VG|3.0|When I first saw that there was a free stream on iTunes, I immediately started it up. I'm a HUGE Killers fan who owns every one of their albums and listens to their music almost daily. I have been waiting very patiently for 4 years for their new album to come out. I was so excited when I heard that Battle Born was coming out today. Upon the first listen through of the album, I just sort of said to myself, \\"that's it?\\" As other reviewers have stated, a lot of their songs are slower and more bland compared to their older material. I will say that I have probably listened to the entire album about 8 times now since last Tuesday, and fortunately, every time it gets a little bit better. Maybe it's because I love the Killers so much that I just tell myself it gets better, but either way, it's growing on me. I guess I was expecting more of a pump-up rock album, but that is not really what you will get from this. Granted, Runaways, Flesh and Bone and a few others have that traditional Killers feel, but a lot of the songs are just blah to me. I'm really hoping for their next album that they go back to what we all love and enjoy. I respect what they are trying to do with this album by evolving their work, but I just wish Battle Born had more of my kind of Killers feeling.

0385334206|4.0|If you are easily offended, then this novel might not appeal to you.  Also, I would warn those new to Vonnegut to read other novels of his first.  This is not his typical style, and it might turn off new readers instead of endearing them.  Slaughterhouse Five, Player Piano, Sirens of Titan, or Bluebeard would probably make good first time Vonnegut novels (I started with Player Piano then Cat's Cradle).  Additionally, there are many characters in this novel which appear in other Vonnegut novels, several who appear in novels written after this.  But I still feel that Bluebeard and Deadeye Dick should be read before this novel, at the very least so that you recognize with amusement characters like Rabo Karabekian (Bluebeard) and Dwayne Hoover (Deadeye Dick) as well as the setting of Midland City (Deadeye Dick, though Midland City is in Indiana in this novel and in Ohio in the other).  Kilgore Trout is a fictitious writer appearing in several Vonnegut novels.  He is based on the real life writer Theodore Sturgeon, whom Vonnegut knew early in his writing career.<br /><br />In Breakfast of Champions, Vonnegut takes every rule of literature and throws them out the window.  First, Vonnegut writes it as himself.  He also inserts himself into a few parts of the novel.  At one notable section, the author Vonnegut actually converses with the character Vonnegut.  His characters use racial slurs regularly, but it's part of the nature of the novel.  There are also many drawings by Vonnegut which add to the absurdity of the novel.  They are rudimentary at best and are usually preceded by the words \\"... and it looked like this:\\".  Often the drawings are about something mentioned in the writing but that has no real effect on the story.  In a couple of chapters later in the novel, Vonnegut begins introducing male characters by their name and then the length and width of their erect penis.  Seriously.<br /><br />The novel is filled with hundreds of short 'snippets', that is sections that are usually one paragraph, or sometimes multiple paragraphs, broken into pieces with a little black arrow in front of each.  They appear almost as if they are bulleted lists.  And in fact, each little bulleted snippet has a particular subject or viewpoint.  The flow is interesting to say the least.  It takes a little getting used to, but if you relax and let go of most preconceived formats of writing, then it is an enjoyable experience.  And that is what makes this unconventional novel work.<br /><br />The novel is a major slap in the face to capitalist society.  Vonnegut never really tries to dish out lessons or mores, but instead points out things that people do and then allows the reader to draw their own conclusions.  One particular section that I enjoyed Vonnegut wrote of a hamburger: \\"> A hamburger was made out of an animal which looked like this:\\" (insert drawing of cow) \\"The animal was killed and ground up into little bits, then shaped into patties and fried, and put between two pieced of bread.  The finished product looked like this:\\" (insert crude drawing of a hamburger).<br /><br />It is the little quips that keep the reader interested.  As mentioned earlier, Vonnegut doesn't seem to be preaching, a huge distinction between him and Tom Robbins (whom I feel was more 'preachy'), an author of novels in a similar, satirical style.  Instead this reads more like Catch 22, where sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.  If your views slant towards the right, then you will probably not be amused.  If you seem to favor leftist, even socialist views, then you might find a bit more amusement in this novel.  It's delightfully complex despite seeming so straightforward on paper.<br /><br />Vonnegut stated that he wrote this novel to 'clear out his head' and to bid farewell to his characters.  Ironically, he used a few in later novels.  In his self assessment he rated this novel a C.  It's not his best novel, but if you are reading his entire lineup of novels, thenthis is the best way to cap it all off.this is the best way to cap it all off.

0385344333|4.0|This is not going to be a long, well-written review.  I have nover done this, and probably won't again.  This Reacher novel is not quite as good as the others, but I still enjoyed it.  I love Reacher's character and his way of looking at life and how he handles each horrible situation he manages to get into.  Here's my main reason for reviewing - as a huge fan, and I have read every Reacher book, I cannot for the life of me understand why Lee Childs let himself be talked into casting Tom Cruise as Reacher.  Such a bad choice!  I know I am not alone in this opinion, I have queried friends and notec comments on Facebook.  Not even close to Reacher's size, much too smooth looking.  Liam Neeson, for heaven's sake (if I spelled his name right) - he is an excellent actor and at least he is a big guy and kind of craggy looking.  I am sure there are more choices, and each one would be better then Cruise.  Okay - that's my two cents worth.  I'm not even sure I will go see the movie - I don't want to be disappointed!  Sorry. Mr. Childs.  I love your books - but you should have stayed true to your character!
0440244412|4.0|Not all the questions receive answers at the end of this series.  But I find I'm glad the author didn't wrap everything up in a nice, neat little bow (which wouldn't have been true to the series or the world she created).  However, the ending was a bit...anti-climatic.  After nearly five books of building towards a final blow out, things just kinda happened at the end.  Sure, there was some closure, some answers were finally provided and even make sense, some readers probably even already started to suspect.  There are a couple intense battles.  But these battles are all battles of will and not physical ones.  Which was a little disappointing.  Yet perhaps more true to the story, I guess, and I did like that cooperation between the different factions was necessary and there were some real good moments between Mac and Barron (love that they converse without words).  I was immersed in this series from the beginning to the end and am very glad I read them after they were all released.  Otherwise, I would have hated the cliffhangers at the end of some of the books.  Mac was a good heroine, if sometimes too thickheaded and self-involved (\\"but I'm epic...\\", seriously, she says this and means it, author should have axed that word from her series).  And Barrons?  Yum, really liked him from the first and am glad we learned so much more about him (if not all of it).  Well-written, believable world and an engaging story with diverse and complex characters.  Thoroughly enjoyed it and will be reading Dani's story next.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Love this game. Love the different layouts.  Makes  Mahjong a number one game to play.  Can't go wrong with this one.
B007U1FEQW|5.0|This is an amazing CD.  Sounds really well.  All the songs are easy listening and sound like their old songs.  They are definately back at it again.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I really struggled to like this book. I am a very big Reacher fan and I still think that the worst of Lee Clild is better than the best of many other writers!  However, it took a very long time to figure out where this book was going and an even longer time to get there.<br /><br />I was delighted, however, with the brief interlude with deputy Puller.  I have encountered that name twice,the other time was the copy cat hero of David Baldacci's last novel.  The fact that the deputy was such a moron made it even funnier!! Touche, Mr Child, you made your point!!!<br /><br />After that, although interesting, the book seemed to ramble on forever, and when the grande finale finally came, it was way out unbelievable.  Even the mighty Jack Reacher could not have pulled this one off!<br /><br />I would be very disappointed to see the end of Jack Reacher, but, like all of us he is getting older and, in this case, not better. Perhaps it is time for Jack to ride, or rather, walk off into the sunset. If or when that does happen, he will be sadly missed!
B007VUA7VO|1.0|or else you cant change some settings...  ads.. etc.  Ill evauate the app, andchange my rating when thats gone and i can use it.
B0087HT36U|5.0|i had a lot of fun with this game.  it has a great physics engine and takes advantage of it!
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have to say that Reacher is my favourite fictional character and I look forward to Mr. Child's novels about him with the anticipation of a child waiting on a particularly scrumptious dessert.<br />His last offering however left me a bit disappointed. Usually the action in Reacher's adventures begins much earlier. In this story however it does not seem to kick in until most of the story is done. Not sure why this was but I hope this is an exception rather than a trend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best i've ever read.I was the first to read it out of all my friends.I told them&#34;make sure you don't have any plans becuse for the next two days you won't be able to do anything but read&#34;.great read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I uses this app when I first bought my kindle to keep lecture notes in a convenient place. However, the first time it tried to sync with my computer, I lost everything. Thinking it may have been a fluke, I kept trying, but it only became worse as time went on, and soon I was missing two weeks of notes. Before I even had the chance to delete the app entirely, it told me I needed to pay a hefty subscription fee, or I would lose all my notes and could not recover them. My campus doesn't have WiFi in every building, so it made using this app impossible. Do no download this if you're going to depend on it in any way with important information.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Challenging but not frustrating.  This is an awesome game. Five stars.  Play is quick and easy. with lots of levels. to keep you entertained.
0385344333|3.0|Well, it's a Lee Child book about Reacher, therefore it's good.  But there is too much surmise and not enough action to keep you going through the entire book without a feeling of disappointment.  Check this one out from the library!
B008MG1E4A|3.0|I purchased One Easy Day not knowing what to expect.  It was an easy read but the subject matter was disturbing.  It was nice to get an insiders look of what happened, even if the military (and the author) are saying it wasn't completely accurate.  It was worth the time, and I have recommended the book to others.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|UPDATE 2/11/2013:<br /><br />This [[ASIN:B007VUA7VO Battery HD]] freebie app has been an excellent one on my first generation Kindle Fire since it was installed not long after it first came out earlier in 2012. As of this update, Version 1.24 functions properly on the Kindle Fire HD series and other Android devices. See the check boxes at the upper right of the product details to see if it will function with your device.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007VUA7VO Battery HD]] is designed for Android 2.1 devices, and so far I've used it with the Kindle Fire, Kindle Fire HD and more recently with a new Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone. It's system load is minimal, taking only 5.2MB, a consideration if you run out of memory resources, and it takes less than sixty seconds to download. But what makes this app good is that once it's installed and calibrated, you'll know instantly how much time you have for whatever it is that you'll be doing, in hours and minutes:<br /><br />◆ Music playback<br />◆ Video playback<br />◆ Internet browsing (Wi-Fi on the Kindle Fire)<br />◆ Time left to recharge<br />◆ 2D and 3D games<br />◆ Reading books (of course!)<br />◆ Battery health<br />◆ Battery Technology (Li-Ion on Kindle Fire)<br />◆ Temperature and voltage<br /><br />This is just a partial listing, and other Android devices (smartphones, etc) will find additional options. The large visual battery color can be customized from boring to bright, and the notification settings and the charge level alerts can be customized as well. Calibration of this app is highly recommended, as it appears to be required for specific devices. That menu reminds you to unplug the charger, lets you know if you have the necessary charge level for calibration, notes that a Wi-Fi connection is required (at least on the Kindle Fire), and to not use the device during calibration, which will take 60 to 90 minutes.<br /><br />There are two versions of this app available here, the one that I'm reviewing is [[ASIN:B007VUA7VO Battery HD]], which is the freebie. I started with this free version, then later upgraded to the Pro version, largely because this works so well that I thought the developers deserved something for their efforts. The only difference that I could find is that the [[ASIN:B007VUCAVO Battery HD Pro]] app has no advertising, and is the only one of the two that will work with the Kindle Fire HD devices. The ads in this freebie are not irritating, and are very small, but when I find a very good and useful piece of software, it's worth purchasing, if only to encourage the developers. The good part is that if you start with the freebie here, then later upgraded, your settings and calibrations can be imported easily.<br /><br />Either version is highly recommended. Whichever one you choose, Battery HD or Battery HD Pro, you'll find an excellent 5-star utility app, and this app is an essential for Android devices.<br /><br />9/18/2012: Updated 2/11/2013[ASIN:B007VUA7VO Battery HD]], which is the freebie.

B00061QJZI|4.0|Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Will Ferrell but this movie makes me laugh no matter how many times I watch it.  I didn't buy the Blu-ray because some reviewers said they re-edited some of the scenes and it's the theatrical release that I enjoy.  So this review is on the full-screen version.  Not my favorite way to watch movies,,, but what'cha gonna do?
0307730697|5.0|We all have our demons.  Adam Brown had the resolve and determination to deal with his head on.  Generally I don't read \\"life stories\\" about individuals, but I was hooked on the high speed train Adam rode through life.  His story is inspiring to all those wrestling with their own demons and shows what a life centered on Jesus Christ can accomplish.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|I have to tell you, I've seen every Michael Jackson performance I can find (from Victory to History, to J5 performances) and the thing I love about MJ's live shows is the way he morphs these songs into something he feels, then we see his physical embodiment of those feelings. This is by far the best show I've seen him put on. You watch it, and initially the quality gets to you, then you see Michael and you find yourself smiling throughout the whole thing, and you feel almost like you're sneaking a view of something sacred. I finished and watched it again. It's phenomenal. Better than Dangerous, better than the dreams I've had of This Is It being. If you've seen many Michael Jackson performances, you've seen things or heard things you wished were different: well it's like he fixed it all for this show. For example: I hate the breathy Human Nature on Dangerous (that was actually better on This is It), well in this one, he sings his heart out. I love the Moonwalker Man in the Mirror - well this one is better.<br /><br />The only two songs that are lackluster are Dirty Diana and Thriller but everything else is amazing. I never understood why people said this was Michael at his peak, but watching him in this video, more than Yokahama, you can tell he is dancing and singing like he's still not sure of his place in history. It's magic on film.<br /><br />Most impressive part is that he's 29 years old, sings every songs and dances harder than he did. This is him at his best because his dancing was still fresh and he was young and energized, and his voice is spot on. When he was younger, he was still finding himself. By Dangerous he was just lazy and cocky.<br /><br />If you like Michael Jackson a little bit, just get it. It's a well spent $12 and you'll be a fan.

B0034G4P1W|3.0|I have nothing against this fluffy little effort from Aardman.  It's colorful, it's loud, it's funny in a bland, family sort of way.  But I just wanted to let anyone thinking of buying this that \\"Pirates\\" has the involvement of Nick Park, the genius (yes, genius) behind the earlier delightful, wry and hilarious classics as \\"Chicken Run\\", \\"The Wrong Trousers\\", etc.  It does not.  When I bought \\"Pirates\\", I automatically thought that anything that looks like Aardman and was made by them had to have Nick Parks participation.  This one doesn't and is weaker for that fact.  It's perfect for kids to watch safely with (or without) their parents; nothing to offend.  Just don't expect those extra levels of brilliance Park's products inherently possess.

B008CLI3TE|4.0|The quality of work that went into this blu ray is immediately noticeable on the title menu.  It sounds fantastic on a good surround sound setup with a great receiver.  The video quality is amazing as well, the only problem is that its so pricey.  I guess HBO really wants you to subscribe.
0307719219|3.0|He makes a very valid point in his book and supports it very well.  Absolutism leads to exclusive institutions which leads to no economic or technological growth (or perhaps negative growth in some instances) because people have no incentive to produce.  The entire book gives historical examples where this happened, or examples where inclusive institutions leads to economic and technological growth.  You will not read the entire book because you will find yourself skipping pages that are identical to previous pages in the book.  I cannot say for certain, but I do think that each chapter is an adapted version of a paper Acemoglu wrote.  Good book, but if you are a student reading this, do not waste your time reading the whole thing. Skip around and you will still absorb everything you need to know.
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|this is the most boring game ever! I would never pay for this game. its not even worth being faotd.
B005FISBV2|5.0|Dexter never disappoints, and this season is no exception. Deb comes into her element this season and feels like more of the center than Dexter.

0385344333|5.0|I loved this latest Reacher novel. I hope other Reacher fans will give this one a try because it is much better than some previous reviewers have led you to believe. I could not put it down because there were so many turns and twists to the plot. I read this one straight through with only time for sleep. The plot makes perfect sense. The characters are three dimensional and the action keeps you guessing. I don't want to give the details of the novel away but it is very plausible and enjoyable. Lee Child is obviously keeping up with world events.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I enjoy this game so much I like It better then angry birds. Please add more levels would,love to keep playing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I read \\"Gone Girl\\" in September '12 and thought it a captivating read and disturbing story.  It was captivating in that it kept me wondering what was going to happen, and it was disturbing from the standpoint that anyone would opt to live in such a manner.  In any event, it's entertaining and worth placing into your liesure reading list.

B004GEB9UQ|2.0|This book gave a lot of background information about how we ate in the past and why people were much healthier. It was repeated over & over again. I knew which diet I wanted to go on just wanted tips to make the transition easier. I was looking for recipes and maybe a monthly meal plan and a food shopping list. It would have made things easier for me.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I pre-order No Easy Day for my Kindle from Amazon. This book brings out the true sacrafice, dedication,courage and heroism  that our Special Forces bring to assure the freedom of our Country. The negative comments with reference to \\"secrets\\" being revealed are totaly false, one can only wonder as to what their motive is.
B002R88G4U|3.0|If I am honest the book deserves a 3.  However, I loved it and would probably give it a 4 if I just went by how the book made me feel.<br /><br />I went and read other reviewers to see why they would give it a lower score.<br /><br />1.  Difficult to keep track of characters: I have to agree with several of them that trying to remember who is who due to the letter writing style is difficult in the beginning.  I did have to go back and reread sections to see who was telling which part of the story.  However, overall I enjoyed the letter writing format.  I thought it fit this story.  Just as it fit one of my favorite stories \\"[[ASIN:B004UJD63K Daddy-Long-Legs]]\\"<br /><br />2.  Saccharine Sweet:  While it was a light story, I did not find it sweet.  I thought there was enough tension and conflict to keep it from being too cute.  This time just after the war people are just beginning to breathe and have hope again.  Historically I may be wrong but emotionally it felt right.<br /><br />3. Light Romance vs WWII deprivations:  I had no issue with the light and dark parts of the book.  the story takes place just after the war ends and people are just beginning to find out what happened to people elsewhere.  Just because life gets hard doesn't mean people can't fall in love.  In fact, the harder life is the more important having someone to love is.<br /><br />4.  Plot to contrived, too many coincidences:  It never felt like the author was forcing false coincidences, but I have seen some really convoluted stories.<br /><br />Overall, I agree with one of the other reviewers where this WWII light, but for some reads I wouldn't want it any heavier.  I liked the mushyness of it.  I enjoyed the romances.  I loved the heroine's perkiness. But just because I can see it's faults doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the story.  I personally recommended it to a lot of my friends.
B0060MYLNY|5.0|This series is amazing, and show time gives it a new spin each season, keeping us on our toes on how this will all come together. I think this is one of the best series out right now and I hope it lasts as long as possible. I want to see a good story from the series, and I haven't lost any interest yet. Californication live strong...
B008MG1E4A|3.0|With all respect to all who have served,and for those who are in harms way and sacrifice for our country this book was just ok. I know it takes a special kind of person to engage in the activities that SEALS and other Special Forces perform.Other than restating this fact, I learned very little that the press did not report,I hope the mission of the Special Ops community is not compromised by this book
B000AGTPUK|5.0|This movie is a great adaptation of the original story.  It is fantastical in its delivery of the sense of wonder it brings to the imagination when reading.  I like this interpretation of the story; the imagery is stunning and so much fun to watch!

B0087HT36U|2.0|I did enjoy this game at first but not so much now. The levels have a delay before you can shoot and that causes an issue with some of the levels.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|I bought the book to read about the mission from someone who was there. It starts out with lots of information about seals and the training required to become a seal. It was very informative and gives a lot of insight into what these guys do that most of us are never aware of. It is a sacrifice for them to do the job but one that they all seem willing to make to keep our country safe. The media tends to want to do their own spin on everything these days and it seems that the killing of OBL was somewhat different than what was reported in the media. I usually seek more than one source for information about what is going on (especially these days) and this book was good for that. One word of caution, there is some bad language in it which I don't care for at all but that is the only con I had with the book.
0345803493|1.0|What can I say about E.L. James that doesn't involve phrases like, \\"utter embarrassment\\" or \\"probably shouldn't have a writing career\\"? If you read the first Fifty Shades book (and I'm so sorry if you did), you probably knew that it's based off of a piece of Twilight fanfiction. If you didn't, allow me to introduce you. You see, when the author runs out of prolific things to say, she often turns to some stock filler phrases to fill the void where actual content should be.<br /><br />Out of a 350 page book...<br /><br />\\"Oh my\\" is used 46 times<br />\\"Holy [noun]\\" is used 121 times<br />\\"Inner goddess\\" referenced 59 times<br />\\"Subconscious\\" referenced 58 times<br />She is guilted into eating somewhere around 43 times<br /><br />Had enough? It gets worse.<br /><br />\\"Mutter\\" is used 113 times<br />\\"Whisper\\" is used 251 times<br />AND THE WINNER...<br />\\"Murmur\\" is used a staggering 278 times, appearing on 79% of the book's pages.<br /><br />You're welcome.<br /><br />To say this book is about BDSM would be like saying toddlers using plastic kitchen sets are about gastronomy. That is to say, it is a watered-down facsimile of the original, a mere ruse in the shadow of the real thing. Don't believe me? This is the infamous installment of the series where Patrick Bateman/Christian Grey says, \\"Lovers don't need safe word,\\" and somehow E.L. James and her editors all thought that was a good idea.<br /><br />The book picks up where the first left off and - woe is me - Anastasia is simply heartbroken without her creeptacular ex-boyfriend of approximately two weeks, Mr. Christian Grey. My heart is breaking, truly. They make it a whole three days before they simply cannot stay away from each other any longer and must be on each other RIGHT NOW. You see, that's the real tragedy of these books - just when the plot starts to go somewhere at least vaguely interesting, E.L. James slams on the brakes because whoa, we just went three pages without sexytime. Yes, mere minutes after Christian Grey weeps and confesses his torture about his abused childhood, boom, it's business time. Bow-chicka.<br /><br />Oh, but what is this? Some mentally ill ex-girlfriend is stalking around with a gun, possibly threatening their lives! Danger! Don't worry, everyone, Christian Grey's inept security team that not only doesn't find her, but fails to prevent a guy from later tampering with Grey's helicopter and nearly killing him - and everyone is generally unconcerned with these minor slips. You want to call the cops? Psh, get your logic out of this book, why would they do something so sensible? By the time you get that far in the book, you're going to be rooting for the people with the guns just to put this series out of its misery.<br /><br />Interestingly (and by interestingly, I mostly mean 'disturbingly'), Ana's track record of getting sexually assaulted by every new man not working for Christian Grey continues, and somehow nobody is fazed. She and Christian argue a lot, but mostly it's the same thing: \\"Boo hoo, don't leave me!\\" \\"I won't leave you! But I'm not good enough for you!\\" \\"No, you are good enough for me! Please don't leave!\\" Ad. Nauseum. And then they have sex, but that's assumed at this point. At one point, it's suggested they'll go to church because Ana prayed for Christian's safety and wouldn't you know it, he comes home safely. This bout of random religiosity seems oddly out of place in a book about whipping and handcuffs while breathing hot seafood into each other's faces after a fancy meal, but who's counting?<br /><br />I probably could go into the plot more, but what does it matter? Take the same banal, one-dimensional paper doll characters and the same disturbing, abusive behavior from the first book and repackage it with a few barely-believable \\"twists\\", pepper in some sex scenes fraught with old-biddy 'oh my's and 'down there's, and you've got this horrifying piece of what I have fondly deemed \\"sh**erature\\".
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I went into this book thinking that the writer was being an opportunist and violating the secrecy surrounding the seal missions. Upon finishing reading i gained a better understanding of why  Mark Owen wrote the book. I m happy that a large portion of the proceeds goes towards our silent heroes. These people deserve so much more.

He manages to catch the Bureau in the act of \\"adjusting\\" his fate and is threatened to never speak of it and to stay away from a woman he has just met. The Bureau attempts to enforce this separation but Norriss avoids them and foils their varied efforts.<br /><br />I was expecting a sci-fi thriller, but instead found romantic and religious mush. Was it a stab at the Greek gods, God, a debate personified, or the visual musings of the existence of any supreme being. It really wasn't worth my time or money.

B000FCJZ3G|5.0|There are so many so called experts pitching their message without any real value. It's nice to see authors take the higher road and connect with their audience.<br /><br />This book has completely changed the way I approach business and life in general. Growing up in a low to middle class neighborhood and being around people who subconsciously want you to fail is more common than I thought. It really hit home when T. Harv Eckar gave the examples of what your parents and friends say to you when growing up. Like how many times have you heard \\"Money is the root of all evil\\" or \\"Money doesn't grow on trees\\".<br /><br />This book is a must read if you are starting a business or have ever thought about starting a business. You will go through a complete mind shit.<br /><br />There are lots of emotional stories and frameworks that you can use immediately. In fact this is more of an \\"action takers\\" book. The exercises and actions are right on point.<br /><br />Fortunately, this book contains what you need to get better results. That's rare and extraordinarily valuable.

B004EPYZUI|5.0|From the moment my eyes were first laid upon Sucker Punch, I was in love. I saw it in theatres and it quickly jumped to the top of my favorites list. For Christmas, I received the normal DVD (no blu-ray, no extras) and loved watching it. I've lost track of the number of times I've rewatched this movie, experiencing the same wonderment and pleasure each time as the first time I saw it. However, I quickly learned that the Blu Ray version (yes, this one!) has an entire 18 minutes that gets left out of the theatrical version. The second I could buy a blu-ray, I did. And you can be sure that in that same second I bought this version of the movie. My oh my was it worth it! The theatrical version leaves a lot of little holes that don't make sense. They're fixed in the extended edition. When I thought this movie couldn't be more perfect, it proved me wrong within those 18 minutes. I'm surprised that a lot of the scenes were cut because I believe they help this movie become even greater. If you're debating which version to buy (plain vs blu-ray), I would definitely recommend going with the blu-ray. The movie becomes an enhanced, breathtaking experience with the extended cut, plus you get better quality and extras that you just can't beat with the average disk. Take my word for this or you'll be regretting it!

This was the last LP The Beatles had come out with before the Ed Sullivan show, so many of the songs on the LP (CD now) were heard live on Ed's show. \\"All My Loving\\" was the first song we heard where we got to put faces to the music. Little did we known then just how great this band would be. Some great covers of some really good songs...\\"Please Mr. Postman\\", \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\", \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\" and \\"Money\\".

B002KKCVR8|4.0|I purchased the Tevas about a month ago and have been satisfied so far.  They are not the top quality Tevas you can buy and it showed at first.  They had to be \\"broken in\\" which resulted in some blisters in back strap area.  But once worn for two weeks and getting wet and dirty in rivers and the washing machine they felt fine.  I bought a half size larger than my foot so as not to stub my toes and I got plenty of room in the front.  Multi adjust straps work well but for a skinny foot they curl up once you run out of velcro.  The sole feels comfortable even during long hikes or wearing around the back yard all day, although my feet sweat quite a bit due to the rubber.  Overall I would recommend them as a good quality product.  I will never wear flip-flops again!

0824835921|1.0|Many find the Heisig method the best way to learn kanji.  Not everyone, however, learns in precisely the same way, and what works well for one individual may not be appropriate for another. I accept the fact that many like and profit from this kind of mnemonic approach: 十人十色 (to each his own). The issue I personally have with mnemonic approaches is that most mnemonics are 作り話 (tsukuribanashi), made up stories that have nothing to do with real origins and concepts of the kanji. My personal preference is to understand the origin and concepts of each kanji.  I have yet to see mnemonics in books that the Japanese use to teach their own children kanji.  Most use graphics  - 百聞は一見に如かず a picture's worth a thousand words- and show the origin of the character.<br /><br />At times, what Heisig writes is incorrect.  For example, he states that the character 古 (old) is composed of the characters 十 (10) and 口 (mouth). The character 古 is not a compound made up of simpler characters (会意文字), it is a single, pictographic character (象形文字). He recommends thinking of cross on a tombstone, certainly a Western Christian idea.  The ancient Chinese who created the character could not have known anything about Christ, who hadn't born yet.  The character in fact is a caricature of a skull adorned with a headdress, a practice done annually in Bolivia to this day. It's an image that I think is far easier to remember.<br /><br />Heisig method teaches pattern recognition. Someone may infer from the 5-star reviews that learning and understanding the kanji (as opposed to recognition) can be made simple. Consider how kanji are taught in Japan.  Of the 2136 常用漢字 \\"daily use\\" kanji, less than half, the 1006 教育漢字 \\"education kanji\\", are taught in elementary school, and another 939 are taught in middle schools, and Japanese students have the advantage of total immersion as well being native speakers.  Over 90% of kanji are 形声 (keisei), and consist of a component that suggests the meaning (意符 ifu),often one of the 214 bushu (radical) but not always, and one that indicates the onyomi pronunciation (音符  onpu). The bushu are described in a number of publications for non-native speakers, but to the best of my knowledge there are currently no onpu dictionaries except those published in Japanese for native speakers. Understanding the bushu and how kanji are constructed is another approach that some may find preferable to mnemonics.  For someone who wants to attain fluency and understand Japanese culture, it may offer advantages.  Consider looking at what is offered on Amazon.co.jp, which can be viewed in English if one so desires.  One kanji dictionary for learners to consider is 　小学漢字学習字典, \\"Primary School Kanji Dictionary\\", ISBN 978-4-03-920160-7, which is aimed at Japanese children.  It is written is simple Japanese, and illustrates the real origin of each character.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Dont get me wrong, I did enjoy this book and I will read it again, BUT It was tooo much like 50 Shades of Gray, with differences in personalities. Im looking forward to the next book in the series to see where the relationship ends up heading.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Was disappointed,, the only thing we learned that had not already been on the news was the author's family background and the sweet childhood memories as to why he joined the Navy, he gruggling history of moving up the ranks to SEALS, how he was selected as a memeber of this elite team who completed a job that needed to be accomplished years ago.  I'm glad I didn't spend the extra money to buy a hard copy of this book that would end up collecting dust on the my shelf and probably be put in a yard sale after my death, and no more trees were killed in the transfer of this book to my Kindle.  I don't understand what the goverment is so upset about, my husband was in the Army 20 years with the highest security clearance there was during the Veitman Era, and he saw no breech of security that could harm our military secrets.  Just a lot of hype that could have come from the goverment or the publisher to increase sales of a new book, because frankly the only reason I wanted to read this book was due to the frenzy the government was screaming about violation of orders of secrecey. The author is no longer in the military, a private citizen will all rights afforded to all US citiizen in American who still, to date, have the right to free speech. Bur if things continue to digress, we may have those rights taken from of also, if we continue on the track we on on toward total socialist \\"sytle communisim\\".  And with that I end my review because I too have the right of freedom of sppech and know when it is time to stop before I start \\"preaching\\" on my soapbox of our rights and freedom given to us from our founding fathers and authors of our great Constitution.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I must say after hearing relapse i had lost faith in eminem and thought he was done for sure but then i hear not afraid all over radio and i was impressed and wanted to hear more so i cope the album from record store and i find 13/17 songs to be either good or great, the ones i disliked are W.T.P,No love feat. The overplayed overated Lil Wayne (can't stand him sorry),Cinderella man, and Almost famous but other then that everything else is either heartfelt or tolerable because Em really does put all his emotions and feelings in this record something encore and relapse lacked, Em as usual is lyrically on point probably his best punchlines and lyrics he ever wrote.Now this album does take some digesting because i (like old em fans) didn't like it at first but it grew on me, is it better then SSLP,MMLP,TES? Lyrically i think so but musically it's not even close (Too mainstream sounding).If you accept the product for what it is and not what it should have been, you should enjoy it for the most part
034580404X|5.0|Enjoyed each book and didn't have time to put down. It was definitely worth my money and time. You will enjoy this too.
B00000K3D4|1.0|I'm just wondering how this happened?  How did this ever become a thing?  I remember in my early teens hearing from some friends how this was their favorite `fantasy' film and that I should watch it.  I've never been much for fantasy films, so I was never inclined to dig in, but I recently gave this is watch and I must say that the cult following is baffling.  I see absolutely nothing of merit here, and it's sad because it was obviously trying to capitalize off of the success of 1984's `The Neverending Story', a fantasy film that works on nearly all levels.  Where `The Neverending Story' used spiritual overtones to create something dark and profound, and where `The Princess Bride' used comic highlights to create something universally appealing and wholly entertaining, `Labyrinth' fails to do much of anything at all.  Instead, it becomes a campy mess, attempting darkness but coming off like a depressing episode of Sesame Street complete with ridiculous musical numbers and a dreadful David Bowie in too tight pants and atrocious hair.  The Muppets are all laughably poor in construction and the redundancy and pointlessness of the plot is enough to put you to sleep.  This isn't even fun, for it fails to bring a smile that isn't awkward.  Jennifer Connelly is bland and unappealing here, and the general concept of the storyline is just plain uninspired and dull.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Given all the fuss by the Pentagon that the author disclosed information that might threaten operational security for our military, I thought the book was very surface and did not provide much more that what was reported by the media and via other open sources. It was a pretty light read, and I believe some current television programs dealing with special operator training reveal much more. The descriptions of relationships, the stresses of training, the demands of deployment and so on, were slim. Of course, to hear details of the final assault and engagement with UBL was a rare opportunity to get the story straight from someone in the ring, but again, for all the sound and fury about the release of this book, I still think it was relatively light weight.  I am speaking of the book, it's depth or lack thereof, and my comments should not be taken to in any way diminish the heroic nature of the mission or the daily work of our military in general, and our special operations teams in specific. I understand some of the author's challenges, since the real intensity of their efforts and sacrifice can never be fully captured in words.<br /><br />I do recommend the book. Reader should just adjust their expectations. The hype and governmental response to the book seem overblown compared to the actual detail provided. It is a good read, moves quickly, and by the end, readers will have a good sense of how the deal went down.
B007C4ZJ0S|3.0|Gina Carano is a terrible actress.  Outside of that, `Haywire' is a fun ride.  It is a little choppy and at times slightly nonsensical, but in the vein of Soderbergh's other stylized thrillers (like `Ocean's Eleven') this works rather well.  It has a huge ensemble that all hold their own and it has a sharp attention to detail that makes for a lot of thrilling scenes (THIS is how you shoot an action sequence) and yet when all is said and done it makes a minimal impact and thus becomes largely forgettable.  This isn't a film you'll remember for a long time, despite merit in some respects.<br /><br />This basically follows a rogue black ops soldier, Mallory, who was sold out by someone close to her and is on the run for her life covering up someone else's mistake.  We open with her beating the tar out of Channing Tatum and then explaining how she got there, which then leads into flashbacks of her beating the tar out of Michael Fassbender and then eventually beating the tar out of Ewan McGregor.<br /><br />As a tool for physical violence, Carano works very well, but when she is given dialog to spew or emotions to portray, she winds up feeling so forced and so calculated that she distracts from the movie.  They should have found a better actress and just used Carano to do the stunt work.  Still, the rest of the cast (especially Fassbender and a shady, bearded, Banderas) shine in their respective roles, and Soderbergh really directs this with finesse and captures all the action marvelously.  No unnecessary close-ups and hectic angles to worry about here.  No frantic movements that confuse the audience and leave the action scenes looking fussy.  Instead, everything is clean and sharp and precise.  I wish that this was a better movie, but I'm not regretting my decision to watch it one iota.
B005H9B44A|4.0|While not the most amazing film I've seen - it was entertaining and had more of a story than I would have thought. Cast was definitely eye candy and overall the movie was brain candy too. Something to watch but you don't have to think too hard on it.
B008B9JSD2|5.0|I was highly impressed with this gem of a film, one that obviously understood the beauty of a subtle and meaningful approach to a controversial subject without shying away from inserting needed moments of humor and charm.  Tackling the idea of doubt, insecurity and wavering faith, `We Have a Pope' addresses a concern that may not be thought of very often but one that deserves our attention.  By centering the affair on a newly elected Pope who feels inadequate and quite frankly overwhelmed by the assignment bestowed on him by God, `We Have a Pope' adds a serious depth to the age-old topic of personal spirituality.  With a blisteringly authentic performance by Michael Piccoli, this beautiful film moves with grace and highlights emotional assertions that one cannot help but feel akin to.  Piccoli should be up for Oscar consideration, but that won't happen.  The way he balances out this conflicted man's fears and enchantments is astonishing to watch.  Such a soulful performance, one imbued with sharp passion and integrity.  At the end of the day, `We Have a Pope' never backs away or exposes a lazy or easy out but instead rounds out to a moment of responsibility that shines bright despite the crushing reality of the decision made (crushing on most, but freeing for one).  It is a beautiful film that remains provoking while wholly entertaining; something most films strive to be but fail miserably to become.

B007SGM084|3.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy was... just okay. The author spent a lot of time on the sexual/intimate details but when it came to the story line I found the possibilites lacking.<br /><br />I did, however, find my self laughing out loud throughout the entire trilogy. Many parts were genuine things that anyone could laugh at but there were also plenty of scenes where I was laughing because it was so ridiculously unbelievable.<br /><br />I enjoy fictional stories where I can think to myself, \\"that really could happen!\\" With The Fifty Shades Trilogy I found myself wanting to get it overwith because there were too many scenes that were so heavily weighted in fantasy that it was impossible for me to believe that any of it could actually happen.<br /><br />I do realize that this is a fictional fantasy but there are a fair share of authors out there who can successfully execute realistic possibilities with fantasy and that is why I'm giving this trilogy an average score. I almost gave it 2 stars because I found plenty of gramatical errors, especially in the last book. It gave me the idea that the author was in a hurry to finish and I was disappointed to see that the editor/publisher didn't catch these errors. However, the author's style has an easy flow and the male character's \\"sickness\\" and the female character's childhood were the only things that I could identify as a realistic challenge.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good read and the characters will stick with you for a few days after finishing.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|As I'm looking at publishing ebooks on Kindle as another source of income and being a novice at it all, I've read different articles and reports on the subject and found \\"Building your book for Kindle\\" very benefical.

1439148953|3.0|This is the first Colm Toibin book I've read; John McGahern's work has been my touchstone for this era of Irish fiction and Toibin's understated style is not dissimilar to the late McGahern's, though Toibin seems much more prone to the stealthy and unexpected plot bombshell.<br /><br />Brooklyn is skilfully written and I enjoyed it. I thought the main character, Eilis, was well rounded and believable, as was the priest. But the other characters seemed two dimensional. The most interesting aspect for me was how Eilis changed as she grew in confidence, not realising how much she had flourished until events force her supposedly temporary return to Enniscorthy.<br /><br />Back home, she finds herself viewed by all who know her as glamorous and confident. If not exactly an ugly duckling when she left for America, she most certainly returns as a swan. She quickly becomes accustomed to her new social standing and I very much got the feeling that she was developing a marked preference for being a big fish in her small Irish pool (pardon the mixed metaphors) to a very small one in the sprawling, multi-cultural suburb of Brooklyn.<br /><br />But Toibin's final plot twist, sees Eilis cut down to the size she was before leaving Enniscorthy and her experience and cunning bring her to a swift and unhesitating conclusion about the only path open to her. She's tough and decisive and I was left with little doubt that whichever way her life went after the last page, she would not only survive, but succeed. If Toibin ever writes a follow up,(perhaps 10 years later) I think Eilis will be a character most readers would struggle to sympathise with.<br /><br />In summary, beautifully written in places, but more than a touch contrived. Incidentally, I read the book on my Kindle version (Android phone) and if some think the ending was unexpected, think how I felt when I tapped to turn the page to find there were no more pages to turn.<br /><br />I originally published this on Amazon's UK site. I've pasted it here in the hope that Amazon will soon make UK reviews available to all its customers<br />Joe McNallyte.

Yes, it's written for teens, so, yes, that makes it a super fast read--and no, I'm not a teenager, but that doesn't take a way from the fact it's just darn good story-telling. To hold the age group it was targeted for against it as it stands among other books would be akin to holding a hummingbird's size against it as it stands among other birds.

B000002LAC|5.0|this album (cd) was a complete joy to listen to. the harmonies of these three ladies is so well blended that it flows seamlessly. just the perfect selection of tunes to accentuate theses voices. kudos to whoever brought them together
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|First off I must say, I absolutely LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this book! It was a great read, the story in itself was written very well. As scary as it is to say I can related to some of the emotions involved within this story.<br /><br />Its always fun to read about the \\"other\\" side of the bad boy image. And yes she was a good girl, but to what extent? Image is nothing but that...image. The emotion between the two is very realistic.<br /><br />I would so reread this book. I am curious about \\"Walking Disaster\\",its gonna be interesting to see the story from his POV. The new book couldn't be released soon enough.
0525425764|5.0|This book is the third installment of Grisham's junior-fiction series, based on kid-detective Theo Boone. Theo finds himself dogged by a series of unfortunate events, which culminate in a visit from the police and a trip down to the station when he becomes the prime suspect in a break-in. It seems like someone must be conspiring against him, and he is being swept along in events beyond his control. And he has no idea who or why.<br /><br />This third book is the best of the three junior offerings from Grisham, in my opinion. It was a genuine page-turner. Theo is a likable hero, and I think he has come into his own as a character. He has to puzzle extensively over doing the right thing and about what rules he might be willing to bend for self-preservation. Another fascinating side to this novel is that Theo, someone who loves the law and the courthouse, finds himself on the \\"other\\" side of the law. And even though he knows he is innocent, he gets a taste for what it feels like to have the whole world seemingly bearing down on you and the wheels of justice grinding against you. It certainly helps him (and Grisham's young readers) reflect on the presumption of innocence. I loved this book. It is \\"vintage Grisham,\\" and was a real joy. I can't wait until my kids are old enough to enjoy it too. It's fun and intelligent fiction.
B000GCFO0S|4.0|This movie wasn't too bad considering it was based on a video game. It could have been a little shorter but I enjoyed it overall. If you like scary movies then you may enjoy it as well.
B001P5HI4A|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies but with Barbra showing why and how this was made really was worth my getting this.  As a director she is wonderful. If you like Barbra then you will love this DVD.

1858705789|5.0|***This review is intended for the Classic Rock Fan Pack magazine / cd released in UK 08/31/2012, this review will also appear on the stand alone CD release of 09/25/2012***<br /><br />I usually splurge on all the Classic Rock Magazine fan pack releases, and this one is once again top of the line.  The magazine is filled with new interviews and old interviews from all persons involved with making Machine Head, even the late Jon Lord is interviewed, eerily giving the magazine his last interview before his passing.  Also all contributors to the tribute cd released with the magazine talk about how important and influential Machine Head was on them and their career into music.  Extended Purple family Glenn Hughes, Steve Vai (his connection to David Coverdale from the Whitesnake Days), and many others get extended interview pages, as well as Metallica and Iron Maiden.  As for the CD itself, well it's a mixed bag really.  The best songs on the CD are without a doubt with Glenn Hughes on vocals.  Himself being a part of Deep Purple from another time, to hear him tackle Maybe I'm a Leo and Highway Star is spine tingling. His vocals are dynamite on these songs, for a man 60 years old can he sing!  The Highway Star track with Glenn Hughes also features some outer-worldly guitar sonics from Mr. Steve Vai, very cool all around.  Coincidentally, there are 2 versions of Highway Star, and while I just discussed the bonus version included on the Classic Rock version, the other version features Chickenfoot, albeit a live version of the song, but featuring Joe Satriani nonetheless.  While not as sonically smoking as the Hughes/Vai studio version, it rocks well.  Other tribute standouts include Aussie Jimmy Barnes and Smokin' Joe Bonamassa on Lazy, Zakk Wylde's BLS on Pictures of Home, and Metallica covering When a Blind Man Cries (similar mood to Turn the Page).  Iron Maiden tackles Space Truckin', and it's nothing spectacular, but the real disappointment with this tribute, is with the 2 covers of Smoke on the Water.  They not only botched one of the most iconic songs / riffs ever known to guitar, but it's botched twice here on this tribute CD.  Santana / Jacoby Shaddix is just lifted off of Santana's own Guitar Heaven cd, so it's not even original to this tribute, and then The Flaming Lips version, is just out of place.  While I understand the diversity needed on tribute albums sometimes, the band and their version of Smoke just has no place here amongst titans like Maiden, Chickenfoot, and Metallica.  On a more alternative sounding tribute it would be better suited, and I like their version that it is different, again it just doesn't fit the hard rock / metal vibe here.  While I should dock 1 star for this, I won't because the magazine is truly monumental just as the album was first released 40 years ago.  The CD is a nice bonus, and while much of it does shine, the (2) Smoke track tributes are inexcusable.  Please don't let that deter you from purchasing this though, any fan of Deep Purple, or the Classic Rock magazine and especially fan pack series will get much to enjoy out of this.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A real unique take on a possible \\"future\\" event. Some of the testimonials were so interesting I wanted them to continue.
B004BLJQOK|1.0|I watched this movie right after watching the original movie Let The Right One In (foreign film with English subtitles) and I was rather disappointed with the American version. The American version felt watered down--almost like when a good book turns into a movie that lacks the heart and soul that made the book special. I proceeded to watch Let the Right One In several more times and found myself enjoying it more and more.<br /><br />If you are the type of person who reads Spark Notes rather than reading the book then this movie is for you. If not, I definitely recommend Let the Right One In.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Originally I was hesitant to pick up The Hunger Games as do not usually enjoy reading this genre; however, now I understand why it has been a best seller!  I found the book to be suspenseful, action-packed, and appealing to the emotions.  I could not put it down.

B003CRM6QO|3.0|Why are nostalgia movies such crap? Cool party would be to hand out the popcorn and slide this dvd in. Give it about 15 minutes and you are tired of the movie and Queen. Slide in Avatar and then listen to the conversations RE: boy they've gotten better eh....lively huh. Queen gets 5 stars, the movie one and the ensuing conversation 3 stars.
0345803485|2.0|I didn't really look at any reviews before reading this book (or listening :)) I only heard some friends talking about how great the book was, blah, blah and now I finally had my chance to read it (or listen to it :))... and this book is not the greatest book ever written for the writing style (or lack there of) is very poor. We follow Anastasia Steel (love this name) as she is suckered into interviewing the young billionaire Christian Grey, by her BF Kate (who is too sick to complete the interview). And it takes no time for the two to hit it off... but at a very kinky cost to Ms. Steel. What \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" does is muddle through the new sexually charged frustrations, and emotions of Ms. Steel, but these emotions are not explained well enough to seep into the readers mind. All I really remember are the sexual escapades, like the other parts of the novel, are written very bluntly with no flourish. I'm glad for James' success, I just wish it was for a more positive outing, as \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is a mess and a failure when it comes to true erotic literature. For those who don't get why I am so hard on this book, go read Anne Rice's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" series (it puts \\"Grey\\" to shame and was penned almost 30 years ago) or the grandmother of all kinky twisted novels \\"The Story of O\\" (Written by Pauline Reage way back in 1954). Both had real storylines driving the forte of the novels. And the reader never questioned the mindset of the heroine, just fell in love with her story and her struggle. Something \\"Fifty\\" just fails to do.

Highly recommend. it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book is a great read and provides insight into the world of Navy SEAL life. The account of the mission is riveting as you see it through the eyes of a prime operative and brings a human touch to the events.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|great. definitely. entertaining and way to pass some time like at Airports and such. I like that you are given the choice of being to involve yourself or notnin other people lives.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|the first half of the book was fairly dull.  The last half, which focused on the Bin Laden raid was fascinating.  With hindsight I would have started about chapter 8.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|inspiring....<br /><br />\\"one wouldn´t be doing one´s job, if one didn´t itch to prick\\" Ch. Hitchens<br /><br />if only he would have used this quote as openning remark....anyway...
B008I3R2VG|2.0|...you know? watered down because you let your ice cubes melt in it...all carbonation gone.<br /><br />I don't know the reason....whether getting older...or having a family....but Brandon Flowers has lost the edge he displayed in his lyrics.  Calling them cliche is being kind.  The love cliches....the fortune cookie philosophy.  The lyrics are lazy, clumsy and painfully literal. That's really the crux of the problem with this album.  I love hot fuss, sam's town, day and age and his solo album.  They aren't perfect....but they had enough great tracks to dazzle and entertain.  The Killer's early work was metaphorically philosophical...and it had a very definite edge.  There was an anger there...and non-whiny yearning.  Not everyone understood what the hell he was singing about in Mr. Brightside...but no one cared because the song was so great.<br /><br />My second point is that much has been made of the 80's synth influence heard in The Killers signature sound.  Go ahead and compare the synth from this album to the same in Hot Fuss.  Hot Fuss took that 80's sound and layered it..made it richer...added more power.  How many keyboard guys in 80's bands were really great artists?  Let's be honest with ourselves.  Most of the time is sounds like a kid who just started a garage band and is dinking single notes with his index finger.  That's what the synth in this album reminds me of....that dated (not in a good way) weak 80's synth.  We look back on that nostalgically and I think remember it better than it was.  That's why when I heard \\"smile like you mean it\\", I loved it...because it was what 80's synth had missed or lacked.<br /><br />You will probably not hate this album.  But you may find yourself all excited at first and realize this album will not pass the test of time.
0307463745|4.0|Rework is not highly original material, especially if you follow Fried and his circles. Most of the negative reviews here are worth reading because they do understand Fried in his context. Some are less fair and more about their own irritated spin, but for the most part they understand and simply dislike Rework. They were probably challenged by it, and it's a good book to be challenged by. Should you make it your Bible? Probably not. Should you learn from conventional business wisdom and put it in tension with the aphorisms in this book? I think that would be a very healthy thing to do.<br /><br />Rework is for small businesses and freelancers. Everything it says comes down to knowing and sticking to your limitations, focusing on them as strengths, seeing smallness as an advantage, and not letting work become unproductive or at odds with having a life, or with getting enough sleep. These are balancing principles. Brutal honesty, laserlike focus, humane and realistic limits. Reading them can expose where you're out of balance, and that's always good to notice and question.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A challenging and addicting game that I could not leave alone until I had completed all the puzzles. Once I finished, I went back and redid each puzzle until I achieved a perfect score (although it would be embarrassing to know how many times I had to do some of the puzzles before I reached that perfect score!) A tremendously enjoyable game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I play this a lot! I'm not sure what the attraction is, but I love it.  Many are easy yet still fun to figure out. I recommend this app.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Not like most of other similar books, as I reading this one, I felt the author is very much focus on himself.  My son is in Navy and I know that \\"team work\\" is the key spirit for Navy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Its a wonderful app! I have found so many great ideas on here. If your creative in any way, then this app is for you!
B008MU8ZNO|5.0|I know what you're thinking: \\"How can a movie called Killer Klowns from Outer Space be this guys favorite movie of all time?\\" Well, I'll tell you.<br /><br />Killer Klowns from Outer Space is nothing short of a brilliant film. It's not a movie you are to take seriously. Instead you are to watch it, laugh, have fun and get scared half to death (that is if you are afraid of clowns or Klowns in this instance). It's an obvious B movie but it is well respected and unfortunately not well known. The acting isn't the best but it doesn't take away from the film, in fact it adds the B movie quality to it. The story is good in an 80's sort of way. It's cliche but that's what makes it great.<br /><br />The Klowns are both funny and scary all at the same time. You will be transfixed on the screen wanting to see the outrageous scary Klowns that appear in this film. The movie also has with it some great one liners that really complete the B movie aspect.<br /><br />It's hard to write a review of this really just because of how the movie is. If you haven't seen it then please take a look at it and if you have seen it and are wondering if it is worth buying on Blu Ray, I say yes.<br /><br />I first watched this movie when I was a young boy in the 90's on VHS. I bought it for the first time on DVD when it was released and enjoyed it. Now I just bought it on Blu Ray and I have to say the transition is pretty good. Now it is from the 80s so don't expect much of an HD look as we know it now, but it is still worth buying on Blu Ray for hardcore Killer Klown fans like myself. Totally worth it!
0061474347|5.0|This is a great sequel.  In Lirael, Garth Nix introduces a new generation of characters and delves further into the Old Kingdom than the first volume.  The \\"Interregnum\\" landscape of the first book - little more than a desolate war zone -- is now populated with inns, travelers, constables and soldiers.  Nix cleverly imagines the world of the Clayr -- a high-minded bureaucracy and ancient institution that, despite its benevolence, leaves little room for nonconformity. We also see world of the Capital City, the palace and the Regent, and the vast landscapes of the kingdom, along with the familiar wall and contrasting world of Ancelstierre.<br /><br />Lirael grows up in the glacier and comes of age as a librarian, which gives her plenty of opportunities to explore the deep mysteries of the Clayr, practice her magic and agonize over her purpose in life.  She has much in common with the young Sabriel of Book 1, but with no knowledge of her own destiny; where Sabriel was trained in her inheritance by her own father, Lirael is cast about, on her own, to put the pieces together.  Prince Sameth, in his own parallel story, is also lost in a role he doesn't understand.  And where Sabriel skirted the surface of Charter magic, racing from one chase to another, Lirael and Sameth dive deep, finding skills and courage beyond what they had been raised to imagine.<br /><br />This book has plenty of adventure (and scary monsters) but is not the desperate rush from one danger to the next that Sabriel had.  I especially liked reading how Sameth struggled along his journey -- so many YA \\"heroes\\" automatically know how to ride horses and sleep outdoors in the rain, but Sam is awkward if not naïve (he packs slippers!)<br /><br />This book has some familiar characters (like the cranky, sinister Mogget) but enough new settings to feel new and refreshing.  Not surprisingly the evil is larger than life, the stakes have been raised, and the threat to the Kingdom is greater than ever.  It should be noted that, while Book 1 (Sabriel) is a generation before, Books 2 and 3 (Lirael and [[ASIN:0061474339 Abhorsen]]) take place in the same time frame -- more like \\"2A and 2B\\" of the series. Lirael, on its own, has a cliffhanger ending, making it an exciting race to that third installment of the trilogy. True addicts might want to grab them both at once, or buy the whole set, so you don't have to slow down in between volumes!
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I first became acquainted with battery health with my iPhone and when I got my Kindle Fire I sought an application like Battery Doctor and found Battery HD.

B0096DFBZQ|3.0|This took up a lot of memory on my kindle fire. 20mb instead of the adverage 2mb game! Fun game but the controls are aren't the best. It gets annoying sometimes. At first I thought it was the kind of racing game that you tilt to move the car...but its not. Not as good as I thought it would be... but if you like Mario cart I guess you would like this game.

B008OTTRXU|3.0|With its unembarrassed set of slick pop confections, Carly Rae Jepsen's \\"Kiss\\" - her major label debut and second full-length - hearkens back to those Mandy Moore-Jessica Simpson days of the early 2000s.<br /><br />Heavily padded with classy, agreeable filler - light on memorable hooks, heavy on high fructose corn syrup - \\"Kiss\\" is certainly frontloaded with its strongest tracks, none of which come close to the relentless appeal of summer 2012 chart blaster \\"Call Me Maybe.\\" Still, listeners craving guilty pleasure pop have some lollipops to suck on until the next Britney or Kylie record.<br /><br />Her breathy, professional performances almost make anonymous hi-BPM dance tunes such as \\"Turn Me Up\\" and \\"Hurt So Good\\" sound memorable. In fact, her cooing, confident vocals are consistently her biggest asset, turning even the album's weakest moments into boldly executed excurions which, in spite of themselves, are far from faceless.<br /><br />\\"This Kiss\\" sounds like a hit from one of Britney's first records, complete with sugary, swirling, vanilla-coated beats - Jepsen makes it clear from the outset that this is music made for fun's sake, with no deep feelings in sight. The comparatively thoughtful \\"More Than a Memory,\\" for instance, still surfs on dance floor-ready waves.<br /><br />These tunes are designed purely to make listeners forget their troubles. \\"Tonight I'm Getting Over You,\\" a pulsing slice of Eurodance, is the most exemplary:<br /><br />\\"No more crying to get me through,\\" she sings over the track. \\"I'll keep dancing 'til the morning with somebody new.\\"<br /><br />\\"Kiss\\" is a typical pop album with one very strong single, several other juicy tunes and many album tracks that are both listenable and rather unmemorable. It leaves improvement for Jepsen's future releases and illuminates the niche she intends to fill. Why no voting buttons?

B003CN4R74|5.0|I had to listen to it a couple of times before I gained an appreciation and now I just love it and listen to the CD everyday, cannot live without it. One of the best CD's in my collection.
0307744434|5.0|What a great read. This story is so original and engrossing I felt transported every time I picked up the book.<br /><br />If you cannot suspend your belief, this book is not for you. If you are willing to allow that magical and unscientifically-based things can happen, take this trip to the late Victorian era and let Erin Morgenstern welcome you to the world of the Night Circus.<br /><br />The story is not told in a linear fashion. This is my only criticism. At times it was difficult to keep track of where the story was and who knew what. I frequently had to check the date at the start of the chapter and calculate how many years ahead or behind we were in the plot relative to the previous chapter. Otherwise, this isn't a critical or \\"helpful\\" review because the story itself was so enthralling and no doubt many other reviewers have already covered that. This is just my way of giving two thumbs up.
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app was amazing, hence the word &quot;was&quot;. This app saved me so much money. Then out of the blue it refused to download any videos so...

He has loved it since then. the colorful animals moving back and forth thru the leaves, the music, the light that comes on, absolutely favorite.

B002Q1YDLI|4.0|In Something Blue, Giffin continues the story of Something Borrowed but from Darcy Rhone's perspective this time. It's an interesting twist because we now get to see the world through the eyes of Darcy whose downfall we were essentially rooting for before in Something Borrowed. She's pregnant and alone having alienated all of her close friend throughout the years. She needs to combat her selfishness to care for her new child all while learning to love herself first. Something Blue is definitely an entertaining read and one that almost betrays you because you grow to love a character that were indifferent about before. Something Borrowed is a personal favorite of mine and I just wished that Rachel and Dex were more present in this novel. Nonetheless, I would recommend this book to a friend and even give to them as a pair. The two books read together well as I figured was intended. Giffin delivers a sound story and further elaborates on a character we only knew on the surface in Something Borrowed. Good read.
B0085A9HXS|3.0|It was good. Action was good. Plot was ok. Overall it was ok. Wish I didn't buy it. Definitely a solid rental.

B004SH40BQ|1.0|I bought the Kokkia i10s to connect my iPod 160 to my Lexus.  I ran through the bluetooth setup in my car and Kokkia connected like a charm, played fine.  But when I turned off the car, then turned it back on, the Kokkia would not reconnect to bluetooth.  Similarly, if I turned off the ipod then turned it back on the Kokkia would not reconnect to the car.  I end up having to go through the bluetooth audio selection process every time I turn on the car, or the ipod, which is about 10 steps.  That's a non-starter.  Bummer.<br /><br />BTW, I know it's not the car because my iphone reconnects every time, no problems.  I would use the iphone as my music player but it can't hold all my music.
B000V6I7WG|5.0|If only for the phenomenal action sequence in the tunnel, this movie is worth it. It's a great great piece of drama/action filmmaking and as with many films coming from overseas, it's also a lot grittier than what you would get over here. Such a good movie.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I thought the book No Easy Day was well written.  I did not see any thing near a security breach.<br />The only thing you could criticize him for is the fact that the seals never talk about what they do.<br />but it is obvious or should be people know what they do and should honor these brave men.
B000E41MS6|5.0|Christopher Ecclesten really brought this show back to life. He brought a brooding and dramatic nature to a show that had been cancelled because the viewers could no longer relate. I became addicted to this show because of him and I think it's one of the best sci-fi shows around.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book is very well writen and easy to read. It keeps you envolved and it was hard to put down. It was obvious the author was not a political person as he wrote about the events as they happened. The book was not sterilized as the White House or Pentigon would like to have presented to the public. I beleive it is a very honest and straight forward account of the events leading upto and after the raid which killed Osama Bin Ladan. I would recommend the book for all individuals interested in the truth.<br /><br />I did notice several mispelled words at various points in the text. The errors were things like \\"then\\" instead of \\"they\\" etc which would not have been picked up by a spell checker.[[ASIN:0525953728 No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden]]
B001FB4W0M|5.0|I have written reviews on each season of this show and they're just going to be repetitive. This show is great. It's funny, while at the same time serious. It's action packed and gory. The monsters look amazing and there is thought and care put into the mythology and the interweaving of story lines. This is one of the best shows on TV.
B00992CF6W|4.0|still super epic, but the fun is limited because it is version0.4.0 we should atleast be in the 1.0.0s. everyother pocket edition gets better than this version.
B001PPLIFU|5.0|This isn't the best of the new Bond movies, but if you look at it in terms of being the middle segment to a trilogy, then it's doesn't feel as light on plot. Yes, this movie is pretty much all action and doesn't have the same mystique as the first one, but it's still amazingly fun to watch and is the peer of any action movie out there.
B008966SIU|4.0|Grizzly Bear's fourth album \\"Shields\\" is one to work at and preserver with. On first listens its all a bit complex, fussy, unsettling and wayward. There is no Beach Boys style pure pop such as \\"Two Weeks\\" to draw you in, or razor sharp indie rock like \\"The Knife\\" to play over and over again. The band comprising Daniel Rossen, Ed Droste, Chris Taylor and Chris Bear decamped to Texas in an abandoned military base and were fed musically on an eclectic diet of rap and Talk Talk's magnificent \\"Laughing Stock'. The latter is an album which creeps up on you by revealing more of itself on every listen like a musical striptease and its pleasing to report that \\"Shields\\" plays a similar waiting game to the new listener. The opener \\"Sleeping Ute\\" has been round the music blogs as much as Sir Chris Hoy has covered the Olympic velodrome track. It is because of this that what would sound like a strange start now seems so familiar. Its swirling psychedelia with a heavy pop slant for some reason reminds this reviewer of a 10cc song that is about to spontaneously combust. It punches and rages until 3 minutes in it turns into a a flowing Spanish sounding acoustic ballad with a lovely Droste vocal. This album is all about layers and the free flowing \\"Speak in rounds\\" has so much going on in the background that the listener struggles mentally to pick up its different parts. But then it clicks and all of a sudden its one of the albums best tracks.<br /><br />More pop orientated but by equally demanding are songs such as \\"Yet Again\\" where Droste starts off with the big claim \\"Yet again we're the only ones/no surprise this is often how its done\\". This is no idle boast for its hard to think of many bands that plough this particular furrow which at its best can be completely compelling. \\"The hunt\\" for example is a beautiful ballad but its structures are angular and background instrumentation often jarring. Much more straightforward is the excellent \\"A Simple answer\\" which shows that sometimes the more stripped down Grizzly Bear has more to offer than the complex Grizzly Bear. In this respect quite why the dreary instrumental \\"Adelma\\" is present is a mystery but it only last a a minute so a small complaint. It is interesting that their counterparts/rivals the Animal Collective have a song \\"Today's supernatural\\" on their new album \\"Centipede Hz\\" which owes a debt to the French pop masters \\"Phoenix\\", and in the track \\"Gun-shy\\" easily the most accessible track on the album Grizzly Bear has performed a matching exercise of dreamy introspection. The best however is saved to last firstly with the rolling chamber music of \\"Half Gate\\" which has a huge cinematic feel which builds to a big swirling finale. Finally nothing else on the album comes close to the sheer perfection that is the last song on Shields; the seven minute plus \\"Sun in your eyes\\". In the same way that \\"Foreground\\" provided a suitable climax to \\"Veckatimest\\" this follows the format of a slowly building piano ballad but it is populated with high octane choruses and unusual time signatures that pull it out of shape. By 4.30 minutes it seems to mutuate into a different piece of music that soars to a massive climax and reintroduces the hook \\"Stretched out, fallen wide/The light has scorched the same/So bright, so long/I'm never coming back\\" where Droste literally sings his heart out until it gently fades.<br /><br />Many bands go through album after album and will never come close to this heightened level of musical ecstasy. And whilst there remains a nagging doubt that Grizzly Bears masterpiece is yet to come the point of \\"Shields\\" is to present an album which is populated by staging posts of sheer sublime beauty but which often requires travel on densely populated harmonic paths and byways to reach this satisfying destination. Should you choose to accept the journey the rewards are rich since Grizzly Bear again prove their impeccable credentials as a fiercely independent band and \\"Shields\\" is oneof there most memorable collections.of there most memorable collections.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Using pinterest on my kindle before was difficult. I am so happy there's an app for the kindle fire now. its so much easier.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|the worst movie ever made; I could not even complete 20 min of this ridicules thing. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|This book was a good continuation in the life of Ender after the Formic wars.  It takes him out of the \\"Battle School\\" and moves him to place where you understand his underlying character better.  Would recommend this to anyone who has read \\"Ender's Way\\".
B0089ZEEYG|1.0|I got the app and it wouldn't open so I reopened it then it was impossible to calibrate. then the game is pointless and the controls are hard I'm glad I got it as the free app of the day because its not worth even a penny don't get this app.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I was wholly unprepared for how much I was going to love this game. Downloaded on a lark from when it was free and waited a few days before even opening it.<br /><br />Glad I finally did. Smooth graphics and physics, elegant game-play, and a first class soundtrack that is subtle and supportive of the overall experience.<br /><br />A rare case when FAOTD works. I will be buying the original Quell.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a must read especially for mystery lovers.  I could not put it down. The format the writer used makes it an easy and quik read. It's not as predictable as you may think.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved this book.  It made me proud to be an American and prouder of the U. S. Navy Seals!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This was a really great game. Well worth the money...took awhile to play, graphics were good and a decent story line.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|A good departure back to 80s new wave-like roots. The Killers have gotten more musically diverse and mature since Day & Age, and I'm glad to see that continue the trend. They aren't and shouldn't be sticking to the post-punk revival stuff that got them started. Musical diversity and exploration like this seems rare today, and I'm really happy to see The Killers evolving that way.
1451678193|5.0|If you love sci-fy your going to love this wonderful book which was made into a mini series, I really enjoyed it and found it hard to put down.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Thought this book was better than the first! Story more complete and with the background of book one, made it much more exciting! Great read.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|I have to say I only wanted to watch this movie for the leading male character. Alex Pettyfer is such a strong actor and not bad to look at either. He adds so much life to his characters and I was hoping that Vanessa Hudgens would do poorly in comparison but I was actually surprised to see she could keep up with his performance. Beauty and the Beast is still one of my favorite Disney themes and I like to see it played out in a modern way with breathing characters. Instead of the princess gown and fun songs there is real person in the role with real problems. The beast is a spoiled rich kid with no designs for others only himself but you could see his gradual transformation until at last you saw his physical deformities replaced with handsome good looks. This is a darker version of the story so I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but it was good nonetheless.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|I am biased in favor of Christopher Hitchens, so I really enjoy whatever he writes. This is just another example. I should probably be more clear: It's what he writes about so eloquently that I enjoy most.
B002BIULQ2|4.0|This movie was a bit silly for me, I wish the director could have polished it up a bit to actually make it a quality movie but kids seem to like it. As for the adults,well . . . I personally had to squirm through a few scenes and eventually use the ff button on the remote. The songs were very well done and there are parts I really liked that resonated with the show but dug a little deeper into Hannah's thoughts and feelings. Got to say I was pleasantly surprised to hear Rascal Flatts singing on the front porch. That was nice, also the butterfly song with father and daughter was pretty moving. The song she writes at the end was great but I kept wanting to move her hair out of her face. Other than that I liked the song. The hip hop song was a nice surprise as well, especially seeing everyone doing the dance moves young and old.
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is much better then block story. i got it on my kindle and it was a really big rip off. get minecraft, not block story.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have watched this so many times I have begun to create scratches in the dvd and may need to upgrade to blu-ray. The characters are all so well played and have so much energy on their own. Who doesn't love an action, love story with notes of honor, friendship and courage plus some humor thrown in for good measure?
B007SSEBCU|3.0|Loved Meryl Streep's performance - no surprise there...but the story is written awkwardly.  They should have spent more time on the film detailing Thatcher's early years and struggles.  Perhaps due to Meryl's age at the time the movie was filmed, they didn't feel they could spend much time with the earlier years.  The senile Thatcher sequences were increasingly depressing and the plot point needlessly belabored.  But Meryl did a brilliant job with the portrayal.  She just didn't have a lot to work with.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Gripping . . . very well written.  These soldiers are the best, and all Americans should be familiar with the work they do day in and day out.  I read the Kindle edition.
B005DNO7MQ|3.0|I bought this specifically because it is one of my favorites, and I wanted the Blu-ray version for a higher quality video image.  Unfortunately, the quality of the image was very disappointing, as  it is no better than the DVD version.
B00005N6KG|4.0|I've probably gone through at least 15 of these things over the years.  I work out with them and sweat a lot which undoubtedly shortens their life-span.  The sound is good and they fit well and are cheap.  Eventually one side or the other always dies, usually after about 6 months of heavy use, so be prepared to purchase replacements.  I wish Sony would make them more durable though.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a wonderful book that contained great character archs and plot lines.  Suzanne Collins is a very impressive author.
B000AOA2G8|3.0|Tool is quite expensive for what it does. In addition, like the other reviewer said, it was about 1 or 2mm too big! That really sucks... Now I have to improvise on a tool that should have done it's job correctly. Instead of adding the pin to the other side, WHY NOT ANOTHER HOLE? LIKE...34mm HOLE??? SOMETIMES...I think they (Park company) are confused...
B005KELW26|5.0|This product was selected and purchased for a tweenager! Love the texture, colour, the locking magnet.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another. Great product, great value. great protection for the kindle fire!
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is a fun yet difficult game.  It contains some extremely hard levels but some really easy ones.  Love this game.
B008X8P8A8|5.0|this game is beautifully done...amazing graphics, simple gameplay for an in depth turn based strategy game, nice sounds, and fun if u like 2 plan &amp; battle! *I was iffy bout the huge file size cuz using kfire but it is worth moving some things to cloud! *the game is also worthy of the price in my opinion!<br />(/ \) &amp; =ity!!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Great time waster.  Montezuma 3 is much better and more challenging.  Still it was worth the two dollars I paid for it.
B0097K21YW|5.0|this game puts u in control of a preciously cute little godzilla-esque lizard that shoots fireballs out of his mouth! ur goal is to destroy the cities! simply swipe ur finger toward the buildings, hitting them w/ fireballs, to destroy them! uses physics based destruction like in some other games but the gr8 graphics, cute characters, subject matter, and challenging levels make this a fun, fresh take on these games! *using my kfire<br />(/ \) &amp; =ity!
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I was concerned before I got it that it wasn't going to protect my brand new kindle fire, but I was pleasantly surprised. The kindle clips or clicks into place and the outside and inside is very soft and the strap holds it closed very well. It was a very good buy for my money.
0525953728|5.0|This is a page turner period.<br /><br />\\"Mark Owen\\" captures your interest on page one and doesn't release you until the end.  Very well written as to where you believe you are there.  This first person account is believable and it clearly shows the political bias as presented to the public.<br /><br />All the discussions of the release of Classified Information I would believe are misdirected, much of what Mr. Owen presents was already in the public domain, he merely colored in the line drawing with his observations.<br /><br />It took me less than a day to read, an Excellent Book!
0525953728|4.0|Got the book on the Kindle. It was a very easy read but definitely well written.  The details and the description of what he was seeing were very vivid. Also having the diagrams in the back of the books were helpful. I'm not quite sure why the Pentagon was making a big deal about it.  UBL is dead, thanks to \\"Owen\\" and his brothers.  I definitely enjoyed reading the book and do highly recommend it. A BIG THANK YOU to all the servicemen and women out there that protect us every single day from evil.
B0086700CM|5.0|was so excited when it was finally released but have been waiting for the update for a while. cant wait for that update.
B008I3R2VG|3.0|I neither love it or hate is - it's OK.  I'm a long-time fan of the band, but can't say that this album made as a strong first impression as Sam's Town (my favourite) or Hot Fuss - no immediate hits or gems.  It falls a bit flat - too ballady and melancholic, not enough strong drums and guitars, average and at times over-crowded wordy lyrics, and some awkward vocal delivery on a few tracks.  To me this feels more like Brandon Flowers follow-up to his Flamingo solo album than The Killers - I see someone else shares this view.  Shame.  Regardless, I find myself listening to it when I need something light and mellow (eg, when I can't fall asleep) as most of the tracks don't make me want to jump or dance like most of the tracks on the other albums did.  And being a fan, I've got tickets to three shows already - more may be on the way.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded this game for free for my Kindle Fire.  I started playing it and showed it to my girlfriend, that was the last I saw of my kindle for about an hour!  This game is highly addictive and rather fun as well.  My biggest problem with it is that there are only 600 levels (ha!) and that they really didn't get challenging until the last pack of 150.  Still, I'm hoping for more puzzles to be released, and it's also a good game to help develop your child's problem solving skills!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|So I love this version of cut the rope. The new ideas of levels make the game fun since it has the same basic idea as the original. It is still fun and interesting.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|It was a movie. I streamed it from Amazon. it was good. i liked it. Quality was good. I ate popcorn and had some beer. I watched it again. No beer or popcorn that time. Then poof, gone. I miss it. I feel empty....naw, just kidding.
B008C20TDG|5.0|It Starts with Food is the most valuable resource that I have read on proper eating habits and nutrition. It is packed full of very useful information and a great resource for anyone desiring to lose weight and keep it off. Very easy reading. I highly recommend this book!!![[ASIN:1936608898 It Starts with Food: Discover the Whole30 and Change Your Life in Unexpected Ways]]
6305428042|5.0|this movie is sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good. you can't stop looking at it. Bette Midler is soooooooooooooooooooooooooo good as well as Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy.. i love this movie so much. you must get
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I actually really enjoyed this movie!!<br /><br />And while watching this, it gave a much clearer picture of the hypocrisy of Hollywood. If they do decide to create a sequel based on the movie it would not be in they're best interest to allow a situation where BOTH parties are at fault to dictate who is, and is not invited back. Ms. Stewart fit the part perfectly, and I will remind everyone and Hollywood that the soul purpose of the industry is to make money, that has been proven time and again with every Michael Bay movie made. They have no right to make moral judgements that they themselves do not even follow. I hope that in the end the fellow cast members realize this and stand their ground for Ms. Stewart, we all reap what we sow, and it is not for others to make the decisions of the out come.<br /><br />Back to the movie, I'm a guy that decided to watch this on my own because of the hope that it was not to sappy. It was nice to see a very gritty take on a tale that far to often focuses on the romance of the situation. Besides the use of magic, it was much more realistic on how it presented the time period and the actual risk presented to those involved. Don't get me wrong, this wont win any oscars, however compared to recent remakes I feel that a good job was done.
1469220474|2.0|I did not care for this book, it did not keep my interest and was rather boring in my opinion. Others may like i just did not.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|We called these guys Frog man when I was in the Navy.  The book was a very slight disappointment. I did not learn one military secret.  I saw nothing the Pentagon should be upset about.  I certainly did enjoy the book. Exciting. Very well done. It explains very well what to Seal's can do.  They certainly have one of the most dangerous jobs thre is.  Being a retired SWAT team commander I know how hard it can be.  They certainly deserve the highest commendations and respect.  Buy the book, learn what these people do for your freedom.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|I think this game should have more rounds. I also think this game is fun and cool.I think this game is worthy of five stars!:D;D :o. B)
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Love this game!  I highly recommend if you like match 3 games.  It is also fun making the fish tank!  Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is a wonderful game to play. the only bad thing is that this game needs Internet. it is great to play cause it has a different variety of games to play.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome its a realy cool game like they had back then except its a lot newer and advanced you have to come and try it out
B004XZR63M|5.0|Great book, highly reccomended to anyone that is interested in learning about money and how to amass wealth! It is probably one of the best investments I've made!
B008BHH606|5.0|The Offspring sound is unique to me and this one doesn't disappoint.Previewing the tracks was the deal closer on whether to buy this and if you like the band you'll not be disappointed in your purchase.
B0076XDGZ0|5.0|I'm not sure what you naysayers are listening to, but this is one of the best collaborations of the past 20 years. The musicianship is effin phenomenal and the songwriting is beyond the pale.<br /><br />Is it perfect? No. But I will say that it is the best thing that I've heard this year. I can't stop listening to it.<br /><br />These guys rock.
B000V6Q9NU|5.0|Hard to believe how much amazing movie music Hans has scored.This soundtrack stands by itself with so much power and tenderness that if you liked the movie you need this soundtrack.
1402270275|5.0|fortes fortuna juvat<br /><br />fortune favours the bold<br /><br />This is one of my favourite adult, Victorian era steampunk books I have read. I absolutely adored this book.<br /><br />Bec McMaster's London Steampunk series, I am very grabby, grabby for more.<br /><br />Much, much, more.<br /><br />Whitechapel is our backdrop and the world she has spun for us is dark, dangerous and smexi with creatures of the night and dangers lurking underground waiting for prey to stumble by.<br /><br />Hovering on the biggest break through since Darwin's hypotheses, Honoria's father is murdered, her mother already dead.<br /><br />Honoria Todd , 24 years old , must make ends meet to keep her 17 yr old sister Lena and her sickly 14 year old brother Charlie, fed and clothed and off the dangerous streets. Every day she lives a lie to save her family from the dangers surrounding them, the Slasher gang, starving to death, and the Echelon finding them.<br /><br />The villain of the story is Vickers. He wants Honoria.<br /><br />Honoria has her father's dairies. Vickers wants them.<br /><br />Enter Blade, the cockney, rogue blue blood with a cheroot dangling between his bare fingers. From the word go, Blade is a very impressive character. He rules the Rookeries with the aid of his two Lieutenants, Will Carver and Rip at his side. Blade knows everything that goes on inside the rookeries. He knows Honoria needs protection and he is going to be the one to talk her into it, even if he has to bargain with her. She is stubborn, arrogant, proud and brave.<br /><br />And he loves to call her `dove' and `luv'.<br /><br />What I love about Blade's character is he is not himself around Honor, he tries to win her trust, taking gentler steps with her. She frustrates him............ but when he loves her..............oooo weeeeeee!!<br /><br />There are many layers to Blade and I loved watching those layers peel back. I loved watching his dangerous side emerge. * waggles eyebrows*<br /><br />All the sub characters have really cool names and `feel' trustworthy. Will, Tin Man, Rip, Lark, Lady Aramina ( well, she's maybe not trustworthy )and Leo Barrons, are all described so well. I could see them all in my head. I would love to see some artwork of these characters. Bec has my head full of her world. I would love to see this series made into a movie. I could even see this as a tv series.<br /><br />The Steampunk side to this story is wonderful to read. Bec has made her Victorian world for these characters very lively with the mechanics of steampunk.<br /><br />The dialect with some of the character's speech, really made Bec's world feel more 3D. I felt very much a part of Bec's world, almost like I had been sucked into the pages and was wandering these filthy and dangerous streets, talking all cockney .<br /><br />I really did `see' the dark , dirty and dangerous streets, and the colourful characters trying to earn a living.<br /><br />Kiss Of Steel has action, mystery, twists, cockney flavour, smexi lads, originality, villains, depth, murder and Blade.<br /><br />Now here's a lad that is going to win some hearts, \\"Aye , luv.\\"<br /><br />FAVE QUOTES :<br /><br />He glared at her. \\"Just take the damn thing and eat it. This is the rookery, luv. Ain't no rules `bout what you can and can't accept from a man. Your stomach rumblin's fit to drive a man barmy.\\"<br /><br />\\"'A.' For arm.\\" He returned to the start and began the soft, lush curves of the next letter. \\"' B.'\\" His gaze travelled down her throat to her bosom, and he leaned closer, his voice lowering hypnotically. \\"For ....brow.\\" A devilish little smile.<br /><br />........'\\" C.'\\" Another suggestive curve. \\"For cheek.\\" His breath brushed against her neck as he slowly leaned closer.<br /><br />.......\\"'D,'\\" he whispered, feeling the coolness of his breath stir across her skin. \\"For dimples. Me favourite bit.\\" Reaching out he started tracing the curve of the \\"D\\"across her wrist with his tongue. This close he could smell the come-hither scent of her lush body.<br /><br />He looked up from her wrist, his tongue swirling through the intricate points of an \\"E\\".<br /><br />Barrons was watching with his arms crossed over his chest. Just as he'd suspected. Blade gave him another chilling smile. \\"Mine, \\" he mouthed silently, knowing Barrons could read his lips.<br /><br />\\"Honor,\\" he murmured, his fingers stroking her toes a he caught her gaze. \\"Bein'a blue blood's thrall....It's an intimate thing. You'll need to get used to it. To me.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know it's intimate.\\"<br /><br />.....He dug his thumb into the arch of her foot. \\"I ain't talkin' 'bout just puttin' me mouth on you. About tastin'you.\\"<br /><br />Michelle
0307887448|4.0|This book was really entertaining, and a serious page-turner. The incredibly numerous references are one of the best things about the book, and keep it really fun. Some of the dialogue was a little bit over-the-top, but for a first novel, this is a great book.
1476712042|5.0|Jamie I bow down to you. What you did to me. What you will do to most readers who read about Travis and his `Pidge'.<br /><br />What you are doing to me now. * face plant*<br /><br />My head is just racing at the moment. I have been sitting here trying to figure out how to express this book in words. I want to just drop the `f bomb' all over the page and the word `WOW'. Just splatter it all over the page and leave it at that.<br /><br />5 Stars for the review and 10 Stars for writing a character soooooo achingly, heartbreakingly raw in Travis Maddox.<br /><br />I loved Pushing The Limits, by Katie McGarry..... Beautiful Disaster will do that and so much more to you. Pushing The Limits is YA genre , and Beautiful Disaster, in my personal opinion only, leans towards NA = New Adult, older, more mature due to the content. I heard this term a while back and thought NA really does need to be used more with some books.<br /><br />I will try to express this masterpiece of flawed characters and story into a review. I am going to talk mainly about Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox. This story could not be without a character like Travis.<br />Addictive, honest, fearless, thoughtful, over protective, smexi, funny, dangerous, intense, complicated, tattooed, fighter, HEARTBREAKING, whiskey drinker, ladies man, jealous, damaged, confident, eighteen year old, smart, tutor, insecure, caring, FLAWED, consumed by love for his `Pidge' ,are words that describe Travis.<br /><br />Oh, and that smexi, Harley Night Rod motorbikeJ<br /><br />The minute Travis laid eyes on Abby Abernathy, his `Pigeon' , his `Pidge' the rules he had set out for himself changed.<br /><br />He became at odds with this world he had made for himself.<br /><br />Travis brings home a girl nearly every night. The skanky couch gets a work out. They never stay overnight. He never takes phone numbers. He never dates. He is honest with the girls. He uses protection. He never makes promises.<br /><br />\\"She's someone's daughter, Travis. What if, down the line , someone treats your daughter like that?\\"<br /><br />\\"My daughter better not drop her panties for some jackass she just met, let's put it that way.\\"<br />~~~~<br /><br /> \\"Did you rob the health clinic?\\"<br /><br /> \\"No . Why?\\"<br /><br /> I pulled the cap off the pen, unable to keep the sickened expression from my face. \\"Your lifetime supply of condoms.\\"<br /><br />\\"Better safe than sorry, right?\\"<br /><br />The girls NEVER sleep in his bed...... until Travis makes a bet with Pidge.<br /><br />\\"Which is more unsanitary than the couch, I'm sure.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's never been anyone in my bed but me.\\"<br /><br />I rolled my eyes. \\"Give me a break!\\"<br /><br />\\"I'm absolutely serious. I bag `em on the couch. I don't let them in my room.\\"<br /><br />\\"Then why am I allowed in your bed?'<br /><br />One corner of his mouth pulled up into an impish grin. \\"Are you planning on having sex with me tonight?\\"<br /><br />\\"No!\\"<br /><br />\\"That's why. Now get your cranky ass up, take your hot shower, and then we can study some Bio.\\"<br /><br />Travis is an underground fight club style fighter. He is tattooed, handsome, and built like a `brick sh*t house' as we say here in Australia, ( muscley and strong)<br /><br />He never loses a fight. He didn't lose his bet with Abby.<br /><br />Abby must live in his apartment for one month. Sleep in his bed. No hanky panky.<br /><br />A friendship with a girl, Travis does not do. It is the couch or nothing.<br /><br />Rumours are flooding the cafeteria on campus. Cashmere cardigan wearing Abby and Mad Dog are a talking point. The girls don't understand this new Travis and the guys think Abby spreads her legs easily. If only they knew......<br /><br />\\"Have you ever had a girl - that's a friend - stay with you? Have you ever given girls rides to and from school? Have you eaten lunch with them every day? No one knows what to think about us, even when we tell them!\\"<br />~~~~<br /><br />\\"First of all...... I havestandards. I've never been with an ugly woman. Ever. Second of all, I wanted to sleep with you. I thought about throwing you over my couch fifty different ways, but I haven't because I don't see you that way anymore. It's not that I'm not attracted to you, I just think you're better than that.\\"<br />~~~~<br /><br />\\"I don't want to date her; I just want to be around her. She's ....different.\\"<br /><br />\\"Different how?\\" America asked, sounding irritated.<br /><br />\\"She doesn't put up with my bullshit, it's refreshing.<br /><br />America, aka Mare is dating Shepley, Travis' cousin, and the boys room together in an apartment. America is Abby's best friend, loyal to the core and keeps all Abby's secrets.<br /><br />Abby plays by Travis' rules. She is his friend. Travis's own rules have become blurred and he is falling for his Pidge. Abby is checking out Parker and Travis is getting all belly up about it.... Travis style.<br /><br />Shepley is a great character. I really loved his loyalty to Travis but at the same time he was the meat in the America and Travis sandwich. He has his own intense love for America going on and he sometimes gets his loyalties wrong.... according to Mare.<br /><br />Poor Parker gets a bit of a working over in this book. I did feel sorry for him.<br /><br />\\"Abs'? What are you, a workout video?' he sneered.<br /><br />\\"Pigeon'?\\" I said with the same amount of disdain. \\"An annoying bird that craps all over the sidewalk?\\"<br /><br />\\"You like Pigeon,\\" he said defensively. \\"It's a dove, an attractive girl, a winning card in poker, take your pick. You're my Pigeon.<br /><br />Abby was a character that I sometimes got frustrated with how she treated Travis. Her ability to make up her mind , even though she has her reasons, had me wanting to shake her sometimes. She is shielding her heart and the mistakes of her past. At a great cost to Travis' heart.<br /><br />\\"It's over. Go home.\\"<br /><br />His eyebrows pulled in. \\"You're my home.\\"<br />( grabsa tissue...Jamie you are killing me here.)<br /><br />I LOVED! Travis's brothers and father, Jim. The boys are all great value.<br /><br />Finch is the wonderful gay friend that all girls should have. He is funny and loyal.<br /><br />You heart will trip over itself many times with Travis. I highly recommend reading this book in paperback format. I found myself just gripping this book so many times with the intense scenes.<br /><br />Travis' raw pain literally explodes from the pages. You have to hang on tight to your book. He makes so many mistakes with Abby. You just want to hug him and hold him tight. You will 'feel' his pain too.<br /><br />A pained look shadowed his face. \\"You know why I want you? I didn't know I was lost until you found me. I didn't know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed. You're the one thing I've got right. You're what I've been waiting for, Pigeon.\\"<br /><br />I found myself hugging the book or holding it to my forehead with some of the mistakes he makes. Travis will drain your heart and then fill it back up and then drain it again. He will make you smile , cry and sob. Your hand will go over your heart at the helpless situations he puts himself in and the way he tries to dig himself out. This guy just screams at you from the pages. Jamie's words will tear you apart and then put you back together, over and over....... and over.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever read a character like Travis. He will be one of the rare guy characters that you will really think you know??<br /><br />By the end of the book, you will have witnessed Travis's soul bleeding, crying, begging.....<br /><br />Lordy knows what Jamie has instore for us in Walking Disaster ,# 2 in the Beautiful series. I personally can't wait .<br /><br />Michelle

0452295548|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I loved Jill and the way she wrote this book. I really became educated about the brain. She was able to convey medical terms/lingo for everyday people to understand. It was very thought provoking and the caretaking information for stroke victims is invaluable. I highly recommend this book.
B004DBU0UW|5.0|Wow, what an inspiration on leadership.  His will power is extraordinary and his speeches throughout the movie would inspire anyone to his cause.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I have the kindle fire and I've had this app for a month almost and haven't had any problems. I'm able to log in, pin, comment and look at my boards along with other people's boards. Its the best app I've found so far.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love this app. It has a couple glitches that need to be fixed, but other than that it's great. it's way easier than the web version I had to use before the app.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I keep on gettin error on here and ive bbeen trying to download videos please fix it if their is anythin wrong
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is fun and challenging without being too hard. The music and graphics are great.  A wonderfully done app.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|If only all engineers would read this book!!!  This book provides an excellent set of techniques for engineers to improve personal interactions with customers and users and people in general.  I've already applied the techniques for requirements solicitations, knowledge engineering queries, and close-in user support.  I have noted a marked improvement in customer, client, and user satisfaction.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I am using the Fiio D3 in place of my Samsung TV's DAC.  My Current surround sound was aging and finally stopped working.  I had a Bose Wave Music System that I got for Christmas a while back and hooked that up to the Samsung via it's analog out.  I thought that the sound was lacking coming from the TV's analog out big time. So I decided to give the D3 a try since the price was so good.  I have the sound coming out of a cable box and PS3 via HDMI. Then, coming out of the tv via optical out to the D3. Then, analog to the Bose.<br /><br />It sounds MUCH better than coming out of the tv analog!!  Even my wife noticed a huge improvement in the sound.  Everything sounds fuller and richer. The bass is much more punchier.  Mids and highs are WAY better also! Everthing sounds crisp and not as \\"digital.\\"<br /><br />I am very satisfied. For the price, it is a great deal!
0345803485|5.0|The bad reviews are making me laugh out loud.  I just didn't read it that way; meaning I read it for fun like watching something on TV you would be embarrassed to admit you watch.<br /><br />It was a fantasy, an escape for several days and I welcomed that escape.  The first book was sent to me, the second was lent to me and I bought the third to finish the trilogy.<br /><br />I have never read erotica or the Twilight books, so can't compare to those books.  Some of the details made me blush; it was somewhat shocking in a fun way and my husband will say it had an affect.  The books were purely an escape from a currently more simple life.  I have been a career woman, but am not working now so I found it exciting to fantasize about buying Manolo's or jetting off to London or cruising on the Mediterranean.  Plus with getting a little older, it was reminder of younger days.  It made me reminisce, in a positive way, of the excitement when I first met my husband and the thrill of all the newness and crazy love.  The love, partnership, etc deepens and I have been very fortunate with his \\"one shade\\", but you just can't relive that first brush of excitement of falling in love.  Reading can make you relive those memories.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great organizing tool. Really handy for collecting instructions for crafts. Be sure to empty browser and history to help to reduce freezes.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I used this at Burning Man (2012) and found it to be really helpful.  It served as a light at night for our carport/shade area which was also our kitchen, and helped a lot when packing up at night before we left.  One set of batteries lasted the whole trip (about a week) and we used it quite a bit at night.<br /><br />It also has a little blinking green light that helps you locate it in the dark, and has a blink mode which would probably be great as a warning light if you were stuck by the side of the road, etc.
B0087HT36U|5.0|This game is much easier for me to just pick up and play than angry birds its usually fairly easy to pass the levels so the challenge is only there for those that want it and the difficulty climbs steadily it doesn't jum around a lot of fun highly recommended.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds Free is....Fun, entertaining, easy to play, kid friendly, no cost, great when traveling and waiting in airports, good in doctor offices, good for when you need some no brainer down time
B0086700CM|5.0|I am addicted to this app.  i downloaded it 2 days ago and I can not stop playing it! It's free so why not try it!
B007APGHLY|5.0|I think J.Cole, Tyga, Kendrick Lamar and Drake are the hottest rappers out right now! If you cut this album on and just listen, this album is mixed with up tempo tracks and layed back tracks and Tyga even helled his on on tracks with Nas and Wale and their are 21 tracks so he didn't just bring out an album people were waiting on and only got 11 tracks when it finally came out.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This app is a lot of fun and does require some skill and concentration; I challenge my grand daughters. One must spend time learning the angles and distances of the shot and be play often.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|Love this. It matches everything, super soft, holds up well after many washes (machine wash cold, air dry). Baby loves it especially when going to sleep. Baby is 9 months but when she was a newborn it was great because it was easy to find and stayed in her mouth well. I also have 2 pink princess ones and they both are falling apart:( Definitely recommend the monkey.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|I really thought this was a great book. It was fast paced and had an interesting ending. I enjoy the Mickey Haller series from Michael Connelly and this one didn't disappoint.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Thought movie was just amazing. Just have too c the hype you feel with this movie makes you wanting too kick some alien butt..
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I had very low expectations for this movie since i thought it would be another one of this Twilight movies. I'm just not a fan of it. However, saw this movie with friends and I loved the movie through the end. The blu-ray is exceptionally cool, although I think they could've added more extras. Definitely a recommended buy.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|What a story! Though difficult to capture my full attention at the beginning, because of the erratic jumping of time and introduction of unknown and undeveloped characters, I did, however, experience perpetual interest and involvement. Combined with constant encouragement from my son, I stuck with it. I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />Sanderson does a superb job laying foundations, story threads and the outer layers of a well-defined world and system of society, it didn't take too long before I was completely enraptured and transported into this other realm; capturing my imagination from the scenery to the politics. My heart, however, didn't become invested until I was introduced to the struggle and enslavement of Kaladin Stormblessed and his plight with the forlorn bridgemen.<br /><br />For the next several days, I spent every open opportunity to discover what was, what had been and what was to come. The confusing beginning became clearer, as questions began to be answered, and as events became align for and against our central protagonist. Instead of being overwhelmed by the enormity of the story, I found myself feeling anxious and sad at its conclusion, highly anticipating the next installment.<br /><br />This story is action-packed with lots of battles, lots of lore, and lots of gut-wrenching scenes.<br /><br />Till next time,<br />~T.L. Gray<br />Author of the Arcainian Series
B004K4AVAG|5.0|I love Gaga! Great CD. Ordered within prime and came to my door super fast! All,her hits are on this cd
B0087HT36U|2.0|Droid X2. Freezes between page loads more than a third of the time. Requires canceling out of the game and restarting. Installing if not fixed asap.<br /><br />When playing, it seems very familiar... Almost like I've played it before, except instead of throwing rocks, I was throwing Angry Birds.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting. Finally we can get a true story from the source and not depend on what the media outlets try to feed us
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I usually don't care for this genre, but decided to pick it up after reading some of the reviews. This is an awesome story. Both the characters and settings are very well developed and I found myself losing track of time when I read. I let my wife borrow and she thought it was a great read too. The only problem is we're now waiting for the next installment.
1609611543|5.0|I found this book very interesting, and I like what I've seen so far.  I'm putting it to the test with some pretty good results!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and this site! I get so many cool ideas off of here. One pet peeve is it force closes every now and then :( but not a big enough deal for me to stop using it.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This book is good but I wanted more from the ending. Mitch Albom did a nice job describing the making of time but I wanted a description of how father time rights his wrong.
B0089ZEEYG|5.0|this is a nice little game.  kind of reminds me of the old shoot them up games.  sound is OK,  graphics good.  the fact it has a full intro video is cool, that little addition got my 5 star vote.  game play isn't anything new but control is smooth with the tilt.  it was actually easy to move.  it's worth the 99 cents if you enjoy such mindless silly games.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I have never purchased any sitcom DVD set thinking none of them was worth the money and the storage. Not until The Big Bang Theory Fifth Season came available that, now I have my very first sitcom DVD set along with my movie collectibles. And I am just so satisfied I made a right purchase. It gives me laughter even watching it the fourth time around. This sitcom will never get old. You gotta collect the full set if you consider yourself a Big Bang Theory fans. The 6th and 7th seasons are on the way. I can't wait...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great, very addictive game. Works well on my Samsung 10.1 Galaxy Tablet. And it's a little different than the iPhone version.
B00701QRJU|2.0|Didn't really like it. For my ears it wasn't melodic enough and was to much of johns weird style in unison with the violin. Just sounded more like a crazy jam to me.
0375507256|1.0|I read a lot of reviews about this book before I got decided to buy it. I was pretty excited to check it out- but I was sadly dissapointed. I will have to try to temper my review, because I have the urge to blast this book in order to contrast the other good reviews it got. To each his own, but to me this book was awful.<br /><br />To me it seemed like the author had a few ideas for completely unrelated stories, and because none of them were really that good on their own, he decided to combine them all and try to connect them in some way in order to reveal something about the nature of man. After reading the previous reviews I kept expecting it to get better. I kept waiting for some magical revelation that would make it all worth it. I felt as if I was trudging through piles of garbage in hopes of finding the treasure at the end. However once I got halfway through I find that there is no treasure, but I have to turn aroudn and trudge back out of all the garbage and see if there is treasure back at the start. When I finished that I realized that there is no gold nugget hiding anywhere, just miles of trash.<br /><br />If it wasn't for other reader reviews I don't think I would have made it past the 2 chapter, but I forced myself to finish it. The authors diction is tough to swallow, as is his sometimes made up dialect with his invented slang like presh gear and spesh this or that. I found that the story was more work than entertainment or enlightenment. There were often sentences that didn't make any sense unless you stopped to break down each made up word until you finally realized he was saying something simple that didn't really add anything to the story but slowed down your reading over and over.<br /><br />There are obviously people that loved this book for one reason or another but I didn't. It was more work than it is worth and if you are looking for an entertaining read, I wouldn't suggest it. If you want to take hours of your time contemplating the meaning ofeach sentence and the various evils of man that he could possibly alluding to then maybe you should try it out.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its a defense but you play as a soldier and you use your bow and arrow or sword so you do get to fight zombies
B008Y1RTUG|2.0|TRUST THE REVIEWS ITS REALLY SUCKS!!!! i only give it two stars, bcuz Charlize Theron did such a great job. i kept hoping that it would eventually pick up and i'd stop falling asleep, but no such luck. i even went back just in case i missed something while i was sleeping, but i missed NOTHING. uuuuurgh i'm truly disappointed, becuz i was excited about the cast and concept for the movie. Next time i'm going to Mickey Ds Dollar Menu with my 3.99 :(!
B007WULJ5G|5.0|Let me start this review by saying that you have to go into this movie with an open mind.  You probably don't want to expect a horror film, for starters.  It is horrific but not a horror film, necessarily.<br />Review is for the unrated 104 minute film.  I agree with the other poster about the odd packaging.  I opened the box and was like what the...it's a cardboard flat with a slimline CD jewel case intended to look like a bootleg or some kind of snuff film.<br />This is a study in sociopolitical / economical strife in Serbia disguised as a violent, compelling, often times disgusting film.  If you take this film \\"literally\\", it could scar you for life.  I `get' the implications and understand them.  I believe this is a brilliant film.  You should watch this by yourself, for sure.  The story line / premise is interesting enough to compel you to watch the film through the end.  Synopsis:  Milos is a retired porn actor looking to support his family and takes a job sight unseen; signs a contract and basically signs away his life.  His morality starts to falter from the inception of the project but he is led to persevere Even against his will).  This is a story about greed, survival, perversion, sickness and how all of these things play into moral fiber.  There are scenes in this film that are abhorrent and sickening but are filmed with conviction skillfully and artfully.  Things are implied rather than, thankfully, shown.  Take my review for what it's worth, but this makes Hostel look like a school project.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was so inspired by this series (which I gobbled up in a couple of days) that I went to the Summit entertainment and Focus Features websites to recommend it.  Of course they dont \\"want\\" recommendations so I never sent them the email I had wanted to send (maybe part of the problem with the film industry).  Anyway I like to think of this series as a Logan's Run meets Dune.  I really felt a connection with the characters and was hungry for more after I read the last installment.  My wife is enjoying the Molly Fyde series and with the high that I am on I may just have to do that as well!  I think what makes the series enjoyable is that it is NOT predictable.  If I can predict what is going to happen next then I don't enjoy what I am reading.  These books keep you on your toes, has twists and turns but still gives you what you want in the end.  I think this would also make a really great movie, big budget not needed.  Highly recommended.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this game I like r.l. chess too but ilike this one better. sometimes chess is really hard but when you get to get good at it its super fun!!!!!I hope you ppl like chess too! this was Katelyn saying the news stay tuned.......
B008MG1E4A|2.0|It is more of an autobiography of the author than the actual planning and battle to kill or capture UBL.
1469984202|5.0|I have only ever been this engrossed in a story once before in my whole life, and that was Truman Capote's In Cold Blood.<br />When I bought this book I knew I was in for something special.

B008H5J510|5.0|I love this movie, but I got it today... and the bonus features are no where to be found.  I am beyond upset as I've waited months to finally see the scenes that were taken out of the movie. Someone help!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I'm a bit worried about them splitting season 3 up into 2 parts.Because season 2 was a bit slow.My brother asked why Jamie Lannister just does'nt run away from his armored captor how can she stop him? Why does Stannis land within arrow range of citadel? ..Tywin seems to meet him on the beach head without access to citadel...I gather it has'nt been faithful to the books but these do seem like inconsistencies..I hope they get as much of the series done before any further financial crash..So i'dont really care if they remain faithful to the books or not..Especially when shows like Spartacus  which was not based off books ,but loosely from history is turning out so well..Way better than LOTR IMO..Tolkien seems really quaint these days
0529005298|5.0|I collect books written and illustrated by Tasha Tudor.  This one did not disappoint.  I love the illustrations of the earlier published books. Better quality artwork.
B008BDZOZY|2.0|St. Vincent is a standout artist all 3 of her earlier albums had at least 4 really good songs the  other tracks were all enjoyable..She's a bloody good performer as well,but is she moving towards self destruction?<br />David Byrne a classic some of his talking heads stuff legendary!What happens when you get 2 formerly distinctive muso's & blend them together.A soup tending towards a tepid cacophony.Whats with the horn sections??Almost humorous in lame way..I keep hearing the line \\"beautiful people\\" repeated through the album..any album that repeats such nonsense in these post Global financial crisis times leads me to believe the musicians have lost touch with reality..Or are they being Ironic ??It does'nt matter..It's like a mantra .A mantra of bourgeois denial.The irony only there as an excuse in case of critique.David Byrne almost a pariah like a burping Johnny Rotten sucking down his lager after closing a television advert.What happened to \\"Punk\\"?

B00466HM28|4.0|This is my first controller. I've used full-sized synths and pianos in the past, and i enjoyed them. However the last few years have left me using the computer keyboard as my main controller(which sucks, and most people can identify.) I must say that the MPK Mini has a lot of functions for the desktop musician. I won't go into technical specs and details, because anyone researching this particular board already knows its features; therefore, coming from hands-on use, i will spill out the negatives first:<br /><br />1. I am a big fingered person, and I realize it's a \\"mini keyboard\\" but the keys themselves lack a certain \\"feel\\" that makes me want to play screaming solos and complex chords on (weird, because i have an old casio sk-1 w/ mini keys that feels more responsive!)Perhaps some break-in may remedy the situation<br />2. I noticed all 8 knobs have a slight \\"cheap feel\\" to them...don't get me wrong, they have smooth action, but it feels like they may fall apart down the road<br />3. Lack of Pitch bend/Mod wheels...it can be done with two of the onboard knobs, but it's just not quite the same<br />4. I don't feel the need for a built-in arpeggiator; most music software synths have them built-in, and they work just as well! I would gladly trade the arp for some extra tone wheels and/or transport controls<br /><br />On to the positive:<br /><br />1. The pads aren't as \\"unresponsive\\" as some people will have you believe. I can hit ANYWHERE on the pad with same pressure, and it registers. Some people (who are used  to other brands of controllers) may be used to hardware thats sensitive to the slightest (and I mean SLIGHTEST) of touches,and they may not like these pads. But, pressure sensitivity control can be adjusted in their software(to some degree), so it's not that bad.<br />2. The editor software is pretty simple, and it's virtually conflict free (you may get a \\"not enough memory\\" message from time to time, but it doesn't affect performance the slightest (and ifyou have trouble setting it up, there are alot of presets available on the web for the MPK mini that help you cut through the BS when setting up your favorite DAW/VST host (FL Studio/ Cubase/ Ableton Live/ Reason/ Etc...)<br />3. It's small enough that it doesn't intrude on my desk workspace very much<br />4. On a lighter note, it lights up! You have visual cues as to what's being done, and if you're hitting those pads right :0) (maybe down the road, i will crack open the case, hack it and change out the red LED's to some more soothing blues)<br /><br />In conclusion:<br />The small size of it has it's performance drawbacks, but it feels weighty enough to feel like QUALITY..and it works quite well, with no perceptible performance latency or weird bugs to hold you back from writing your next jam! If you need a low-cost solution to your computer music controlling needs, or you need something small enough for traveling that gets the job done, give the MPK Mini a SERIOUS look!
B0089ZEEYG|4.0|you guys should get this game because its entertaining because you get to have the little monster eat from the sky but there are enimies coming right at you<br />thank for consideration.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the best note taking app ive ever used.really easy to use taking notes or making bullet points. I love that it allows you to make a check list and I can access it from my laptop or my tablet or phone where I am
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing! I wish i would have read it before i watched the movie though!! so much was left out
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Did not like this book as well as first two in series.  For<br />a young girl who was raised under these settings I found her<br />acting to inmature.  Very head strong, and things just had to go her way.  Constantly reading about her doubts nigthmares etc became a little tirirg.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|great app ... I don't have to do anything ... checks my battery life everytime I turn my kindle on and I don't have to have my glasses to see the itty bitty monitor at the top. love the color function too.
B008I3QZKU|4.0|I just received my copy of the CD yesterday and with great ANTICIPATION, I opened it up and gave it a listen.  I had already purchased the RUNAWAY Single and listened to the album via FREE PLAY on iTunes last week, so I knew what to expect, but I own it now!  From my experience, there are many different types of KILLERS FANS.  There are those diehards from HOT FUSS MR. BRIGHTSIDE, and then there are those who like the COMMERCIAL TRACKS like HUMAN.  The style of music from those two tracks couldn't be more different.  They were both HITS, but had a different listener appeal.  I think this new Album is a mixture.  RUNAWAY is an easy SINGLE and will appeal to those HUMAN fans.  But some of the tracks are much GRITTIER and the tempo a bit slower.  I'm not positive, but it seems to me that Brandon Flowers is pushing his SONGS more than before.  Not that he hasn't been the Main Songwriter since the beginning, but I think in prior albums the COLLABORATION has been greater by the band.  I'm not sure how I feel about that, but this album seems to be more of a personal reflection than some of the others. The album is a good one, but it is not as strong as the others.  I am a fan, and still give it 4 stars, but there will be fans on both sides of this one.  The fans that liked HUMAN will like RUNAWAY, but they may not like much else.  Let me state that my favorite TRACK on the album is the Ballad HERE WITH ME!  It is kind of a love lost anthem, and works really well with Flowers emotional vocals.  After several listens, I will try to give a little insight into each track:<br /><br />1)  Flesh & Bone - Great starting track with that KILLERS SOUND!  You have it all in this one Big Drums, Keyboards, Driving Bass. I can picture this being the 2nd Single.<br /><br />2) Runaway - First Single, and stand out commercial track.<br /><br />3) The Way it Was - This one is much softer.  Kind of reminds me of a Traveling Wilbury's song.  It moves along easily building up along the way.  Itis very Melancholy and sweet.  Not a Single...<br /><br />4) Here With Me - Thus far, my favorite track.  It is a Ballad with a Piano similar to songs gone by like Sister Christian.  Not sure what gets me with this one, but it speaks to me, and I love it.  The emotional overtones of Flowers voice go perfectly with this prodding song.  I hope it's a Single!<br /><br />5) A Matter of Time - From the beginning of this track, you know it's a KILLERS tune, it is bold and aggressive, but it seems to be missing something for me.  Don't see this one as a Single.<br /><br />6) Deadlines and Commitments - This one has Brandon singing at the Top of his Range throughout.  I like it, but the lyrics are a bit cheesy is some parts.  I like the theme, and the hook.  I can't see it as a Single, and think fans will be split on this.<br /><br />7) Miss Atomic Bomb - I think this will be a great CONCERT TRACK.  I think it will take on the role of BLING.  Pretty good song and it takes you on a RIDE.  Starts slowly and BUILDS.  I like this one.<br /><br />8) The Rising Tide - Another driving song, I like it, but it's not commercial and it will not be a single.<br /><br />9) Heart of a Girl - Very slow, probably should have been on Brandon's solo album.  It's ok, but not one of the best here.<br /><br />10) From Here On Out - Starts out like END OF THE LINE (Traveling Wilbury's).  I like this track, but it doesn't have the KILLERS sound.  I wonder if Jeff Lynne produced this one???  Really kind of bizarre.  Strange but this could be a SINGLE.<br /><br />11) Be Still - Very Soft again.  This one is kind of SPECIAL.  Once again those vulnerable vocals of Flowers is what make this track.  MR BRIGHTSIDE fans will probably hate this track.  I really like it!<br /><br />12) Battle Born - The boys tried hard on this one, but it is a disconnect for me.  It just doesn't FLOW.  Starts out like it is going to BLOW UP, and then CRAWLS.  It's not terrible, but this is a Swing and a Miss for me.<br /><br />Overall, this album is really growing on me.  Can't wait to see them perform them live during their next US Tour!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book will really open your eyes regarding the difficulties our Military personnel have to deal with due to political pressure to not hurt anyone's feelings!  Washington is out of touch regarding military action and all the more reason that we never deploy our troops unless under the declaration of war by Congress.  Here we are losing the lives of our young men and women for countries whose people hate us!  Not to mention the huge financial drain on our treasury turning us a debtor nation and for what.  I hope No \\"Easy Way\\" is widely read especially now before our national elections. I'm sure it will cause voters to reconsider their choices.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|So it's true-- across several titles John Locke was able to sell an enormous number of Ebooks in a short amount of time. According to this book Locke's previous dribble of sales had not responded to the $20,000 investment Locke made in advertising and marketing. In this book he shares the steps that he believes created his breakout success.<br /><br />1. As a successful businessman in other ventures, John Locke had the wherewithal and capital to try many marketing techniques to sell his book.<br /><br />John Locke tried a whole bunch of ways to sell his book: ways that cost money, and ways that didn't work. Some examples of things that sounds like they might work (but don't) are hiring a PR guy, advertising on a kiosk in the mall in front of a book store, and appearing on radio interviews.<br /><br />Most people don't have the resources to throw money around like this. It's pretty awesome that there is someone willing to share their failures so that others may benefit.<br /><br />2. Locke creates a step step outline of how another author can mimic his technique for success.<br /><br />When I say Locke outlines his method, I mean he numerically outlines his method.<br /><br />The major gist is: know your reader, write for your reader, and get your readers attention with blogs and social media.<br /><br />It's a familiar equation if you've been reading around on the Internet already, but Locke really delves into the example of his own work to provide clarity. He gives pages and pages of what he knows about his reader. He provides the pivotal blogposts that exploded his brand.<br /><br />And there is something special about what he is doing. He posts once every few months with something emotionally powerful.<br /><br />3. The moral message of the book is admirable. The key to selling books is-- provide great entertainment for readers.<br /><br />This book is not about using the nitty gritty of using amazon to sucker people into sales.  It focuses on presenting a genuine and compelling image to your fans.<br /><br />Locke's advise is to blog about the things you love, and hopefully readers will transfer their loyalty over to you because you have things in common.<br /><br />Locke is all about pleasing the fans and doesn't encourage manipulating them for gain. It has to be something true to really inspire long term loyalty.<br /><br />Seriously, you can check out Locke's blog and see how he does this crazy thing. I had tears in my eyes at his latest post (Fathers and Daughters) and clicked the book on the bottom. I think I'm going to send it to my Dad. He used his method on me! It's so simple.<br /><br />4. There does seem to be some filler here.<br /><br />Locke goes deeply into his history. I could have done with less of that, and less reiteration that the book is not about Locke's ego. I get it.<br /><br />But at the same time I found his journey interesting, and I can understand why he put his success on certain methods over others.<br /><br />In sum:<br /><br />All in all. I'd say this is a great book for author-bloggers, as well as authors who have not yet pinpointed their audience. It is a good companion for the very different [[ASIN:0984916172 Make A Killing On Kindle Without Blogging, Facebook Or Twitter: The Guerilla Marketer's Guide To Selling Ebooks On Amazon]]<br /><br />If you liked this, please check out my other reviews!e and compelling image to your fans.<br /><br />Locke's advise is to blog about the things you love, and hopefully readers will transfer their loyalty over to you because you have things in common.<br /><br />Locke is all about pleasing the fans and doesn't encourage manipulating them for gain.

145210655X|5.0|This little book is the perfect gift for any parent, but the perfect scenario is for a new dad...having a boy...who loves Star Wars.  This was the case with me (I got it for my brother-in-law) and if this is the case for you too, this is a no-brainer.<br />The book is simple and awesome and bursts with classic Star Wars references on every page.  And the kid will love it too as the pictures are drawn in a cute and silly way.  I highly recommend this to any parent that wants a sturdy book that will make both him and his child smile and laugh out loud together.
160459201X|5.0|Hi Everyone,<br />I have more of a question here.  Cythia Stafford, if you know of her, credits Joseph Murphy as the author who helped her to win her lottery, but I have not come across where he says to write down the amount of money you want etc.  I don't really doubt that he DID say that I just would like to know where?  I love Joseph's take my only critique is that it's just \\"a lot\\" of techniques so it's a bit of a thing to choose just one.  So I often wonder where Cynthia read what she did.  I do believe that this her story is now a possiblity for anyone who wishes to follow what she did..like myself :)Thank you!
0062073486|5.0|I read this book when I was around ten or eleven years old. Although many of the nuances were lost on my youth, I could not put it down. Recently, I read this book again. It remains ever intriguing, captivating and well-spun -- truly a masterpiece! I highly recommend this story for anyone that enjoys an impeccably executed mystery/thriller. I look forward to reading it again in the future.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This well written novel builds a great synergy between a science fiction premise, a dystopian vision of the future, and a plausible vision of the potential impact of trends already visible in technology.  Perhaps most importantly, the novel builds three dimensional characters who draw the reader into the story.<br /><br />The novel is well written, well paced, suspenseful, terribly easy to fall into, and terribly difficult to put down.  I recommend starting on a Saturday or Sunday morning - you'll want to read it through in one sitting.

1400069289|1.0|This is basically a pop culture mix of Dr. Phil or Oprah style - fix all your problems with simple magic bullet cures for complex problems. If you tell a long enough story about FeBreze house spray ( it sounded like a commercial for the product) and mix in some 12 step addiction cure programming, all your neuroses and bad habits can be conquered.<br />  For example, the author makes claims about the tremendous efficacy of A.A. then admits there is no real evidence for the claims. Still he plows ahead promoting such cue, routine, and reward behavioral methods but adds that you need to throw God into the equation to make it work. He obviously did little actual research on A.A. and rehabs but thought it would make good filler; which much of the book is.<br />  It gets totally absurd when he begins analyzing success in football. He borrowed from Tony Dungy's best seller to try to create his own. In essence, he tries to show that Dungy's approach to changing routine mixed in with the cue and reward sequence translates into championships in football. Like much of the rest of the examples, he makes it all sound so simple. Just follow the Dungy method, make football into a 1,2,3 do this and that, and you win. If it was really that simple, then Dungy's former assistants should have been able to employ the same program and achieve great success - they didn't - case example, Dungy's former assistant Herm Edwards, who was a disaster as a head coach.<br />  In reality, Dungy was so successful because he had years of excellent preparation as an assistant, and was an excellent game coach who adapted very well to the complexities of the game as they unfolded. He would have succeeded regardless of what system he implemented. After leaving Tampa Bay, he went to Indianapolis, where he had Peyton Manning for a quarterback, now there's a magic bullet that helps guarantee positive outcomes.<br />  Duhigg also cites experiments in psychology as support for his contentions, though some ofthose experiments were later discredited. For example, the famous \\" increase the pain\\" experiment because an authority figure demanded it. Though there is a grain of truth to many of his claims, they should be regarded with healthy skepticism. This is B.F. Skinner behaviorism brought into the 21st century with Dr. Phil or your local charismatic cult figure presiding. And by all means, if Febreze works, spray away.
B007549W62|4.0|After hearing Michael Biehn talking about \\"The Divide\\" on the Adam Carolla podcast, I was compelled to check it out. I've been a big fan of post-apocalyptic/post-nuclear movies since the early '80s, but this is decidedly not the post-apocalypse I was hoping for.<br /><br />The movie revolves around eight people who escape what appears to be a nuclear attack by hiding in the basement of their apartment building, until then solely occupied by the building's loner superintendent Mickey (Biehn). I say \\"what appears to be\\" because shortly after the cataclysm, someone comes knocking on the big steel door, attracted by the survivors' CB radio transmissions. In the movie's strangest and most illogical turn, armed men in rubber armor invade the shelter and are repelled by the survivors, but not before taking the only child hostage. (Which was sort of a relief, as the young actor's performance was almost painful to watch.) Later, one of the guys suits up and goes out to explore, and finds a labyrinth of lighted tunnels leading to more men in suits in a mobile laboratory. Who are they? Aliens? Military? Why are they taking children and what are they doing with them? After some gunfire and an implausible escape, this subplot is mostly forgotten.<br /><br />Certainly, some of the characters do some depraved things, but that's who they are. And really, that seems to be the premise of the movie: When all bets are off, how low will we sink? We never really get to know any of the characters (most movies would feature an early \\"introduction roundtable\\" scene), but now that I think about it, I'm OK with that choice. I didn't really care to know anyone's backstory, and anything I needed to know was revealed gradually, either through subtle dialogue or, better yet, their actions. Although there are some clues (falling hair, facial pallor), you never get a good sense of how much time has passed between events.<br /><br />Made on a low budget, the movie boasts some remarkable visual effects and interesting cinematography. One irritation was the looping (overdubbing) of the actors' voices, which tended to make most of the acting come across as bad, although it lent a surreal effect to Michael Eklund's (oh-so-disturbing) performance.<br /><br />Despite its grueling nature and unrelenting savagery, I found \\"The Divide\\" very entertaining and thought-provoking, even if it was uneven and went off on too many tangents. The lesson I took from it was, \\"If you see the two toughest guys in the fallout shelter maneuvering to divide the group and take over the food and water, kill them.\\"<br /><br />If you like your post-apocalypse raw and unforgiving, give this a shot.ts and interesting cinematography.

037571457X|5.0|I have taught this book to my tenth grade English students for the past five years, and I believe it has helped to send my former students into society as informed adults with enough perspective to see Iranian people as fellow global citizens, not Middle Eastern enemies.<br />  Satrapi wrote the book to inform people about the Islamic Revolution and to give readers an insider perspective. I know that the book was originally written in French, and then later translated to English, which are the main languages of the Western world. This points to her intended audience - Westerners.  Satrapi was trying to show the Western world what Iranian people are really like -- not extremists, not radical Muslims - but mostly peace-loving, creative, independently thinking people who value their Persian culture and lifestyle and have suffered greatly for remaining in their homeland in spite of the challenges.<br />  Throughout the book, she paints herself as religiously moderate and politically involved, even as a child, and not at all negative towards the West. With images of the Iranian hostage crisis in the back of our minds, it is easy for Americans to assume that all Iranians hate Americans, but this is far from true. Satrapi shows her love for Western culture and music and books with Michael Jackson and Kim Wilde and Iron Maiden. She mostly clearly demonstrates the impact of their suffering with how drastically the loss of her Uncle Anoosh impacted her. She also wants people to have the facts about the revolution as well, which we see in the wealth of historical information integrated into her memoir.<br />  I personally believe that Satrapi was very effective in helping society see Iranians differently, mostly from my personal experience. Before reading this book six years ago, I assumed that if the theocracy remains in power, that must mean that the majority of people in Iran must be really religious and anti-West, or else why wouldn't they overthrow their government? This book helped me see that they are really suffering under a different kind of tyranny, and also helped me understand why it happened.  She shows why they overthrew the Shah - for freedom from an oppressive government, a government in which she knew that the difference between the social classes caused many people pain, but then she also shows throughout the rest of the book how the Iranian people were manipulated into becoming faithful to an Islamic regime.<br />  The serious re-structuring of schools caused great suffering and contributed to the difficulty with changing mindsets. If the religious government controls the schools, then the children are inculcated with the religious ideas, much like how Marjane was initially inculcated with the thought that the Shah was chosen by God.  In addition, the Islamic regime ultimately secured their power by uniting the Iranian people in war against a foreign enemy and carrying on the war until the society was so completely devastated, they would not have the energy or desire to cause further revolt of any kind.<br />  I think this is an important topic for the Western world to see, as Western relations with Iran affect us in many ways.  Our government currently has strict economic sanctions on Iran, which causes our gas prices to go up and impacts us where we feel it the most, our wallets; however, most people do not see the reason behind this, and why the world needs to take note of the tyranny in Iran.  In addition, many people here in the United States lump together all of the people in the Middle East under the label of \\"Arabs\\" and then furthermore, see them all as extreme Muslims and terrorists, particularly since 9/11.  As a student pointed out in class today, the book was published shortly after 9/11, which is likely not a coincidence. In the days after this event, many Americans viewed any Middle Eastern man with a beard or any Middle Eastern woman with a hijab as a terrorist, a threat; yet Marjane paints us a much needed picture of a world so many Americans do not realize exists - a world in which many free spirited Iranian people endure a forced dress code that represents far more oppression than we here in America could ever imagine.ded picture of a world so many Americans do not realize exists - a world in which many free spirited Iranian people endure a forced dress code that represents far more oppression than we here in America could ever imagine.

B008LZHA3G|5.0|This is a great album! It's a little better then the last few albums & has more of a feel like Time Out Of Mind & the Love & Theft albums. But i really like the flow of this album. Each song seems to link & flow perfectly into the next song. But i noticed that Bob's voice on this one seems to be getting worse like dryer and more gravel to it. But he works around it and makes it work very well with vocal expression to where you hang on to every word that spills out of him.It is the Temptation Of Dylan & your sitting on the edge wondering what is he going to say next. One of the coolest voices ever was Howlin Wolf just because of the grit & i think Bob Dylan has made this work for him as well. Bob tells great story's in his songs & Bob even with some humor is kinda like the Clint Eastwood of music to where he is a tell it like it is person. Bob also has had great luck of always having great session musician behind him as well. I think every song on this album is really good & i think this is his best work since Love & theft. If you liked Time Out Of Mind & The Love & Theft albums you should enjoy this as well.

030758836X|4.0|As I read this book, I had a recurring thought. Perhaps I am naïve, but if there are lots of people in the real world that are like the dysfunctional characters in this book, then the human race is in big trouble. The reader will encounter manipulative, cruel individuals who abuse and are abused with abandon. Brilliant sociopaths, lowlifes who take advantage of others, misfits, completely unhappy and miserable examples of mankind, occupy the pages of this book. I was hard pressed to find one likable, and possibly normal being, who was not intent on using another, not intent on drawing attention to themselves, not intent on seeking fortunes, power and control using any means to justify their ends.<br /><br />As the pages turned I could not believe the developments, and yet, they were just real enough to possibly actually take place. The author captured her characters personality traits perfectly in the dialogue. The narrative twisted and turned and kept the characters and the reader twisting and turning in the wind, as well. What would happen next? Could the situation grow worse? The answer was yes, it kept getting worse and worse until the ending which was a bit of a surprise, but also in the realm of the possible, in the realm of the credible. My tension increased as I continued to read and I was, at times, afraid to find out the conclusion of this mystery. The author makes the unbelievable absolutely believable. These characters were sick people who found each other and fed off each other. They were all some kind of parasite.<br /><br />Gone Girl, just kept surprising me. Nick and Amy, for all appearances, were both very self absorbed, very preoccupied young people, who wanted to appear to be the cool version of a perfect married couple, very much interested in maintaining their independence and not leaning heavily on each other with reproaches. They were \\"the beautiful people\\". However, they were hit hard by the economic downturn, losing their very well paid jobs in New York City. Experiencing these bumps in the road, they were forced to reassess their lives and relocate to Nick's former hometown, where they started over. Together with his twin sister, and his wife's money, Nick purchased a bar which he operates happily with his sibling.<br /><br />Suddenly, one morning, on their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears in what looks like violent circumstances. After a lengthy investigation, with many shocking revelations, all fingers point to the husband, Nick, who is generally the first and major suspect in cases like these. The storyline will introduce the reader to all sorts of people who thrive on this kind of investigation, not only to help solve the crime, but also for the thrill of it and some for their fifteen minutes of fame, romance or even financial gain. (Nick's wife Amy is the inspiration for \\"Amazing Amy\\", a character in a children's book series created by her parents.)<br /><br />Occasionally, the book got a bit tedious, but just when I was ready to give up, the plot moved on and captured my interest again. The competing, dual narratives and timelines concerning the events Nick and Amy experienced, were engaging, but sometimes it took too long to switch from one of them, to the other. The plot used trompe l'oeill, sleight of hand, and misdirection to provide different clues and constantly pointed me in one and then another direction, as it did the police investigators. It worked so effectively, so perfectly that it kept me involved in the story, eager for more. Each time I thought I had it all figured out, another theme developed, the plot twisted away, and I was baffled once again.<br /><br />It was really hard to like any of the characters. All of them were self serving, scheming in some way, working under the radar, suffering from one thing or another, often self inflicted wounds because of stupidity, greed, insecurity and perhaps, mental illness.<br /><br />I was able to identify with the closeness of the fraternal twins because I have a twin brother. Also, I was able to identify with the in-law issues, since most of us do experience them in one form or another, but with twins, I suspect it can be more intense because their unusual closeness can cause jealousy. Regardless of any common ground I found within the pages, I could not identify with the issues that troubled any of the characters in the story. They were simply not nice. They lied, stole, cheated, inflicted harm to others, played ugly games with people, disregarded the feelings of others, used them at will and, in general, seemed to be completely corrupt in some way. Yet, haven't we all known someone like that?<br /><br />All in all, Gone Girl, is a really good, exciting read!ernal twins because I have a twin brother.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Good read. As stated in the authors forword this book contained no operational or equipment related classified information that I have not read in other books about the SOF coummunity. Information in the book was nothing I had not read or seen in media reports, but it was interesting to get a first person take on the raid and elimination of the most wanted man in the world.
0525953728|4.0|No Easy Day, Mark Owen<br />The author seems sincere in his effort to describe the Seal experience. One thing comes through very clearly; the arduous training and dedication of the Seals is of the highest order. The book reads like a novel. In its honesty, it is totally refreshing. Being a whistleblower is not easy and I can't help but wonder who gave away his identity. The book was originally attributed to Mark Owen, an assumed name. His real name is Matt Bissonnette<br />The Pentagon and some military spokespeople have portrayed him as a traitor to his oath. For me, the only thing this young man seems to be guilty of is fighting patriotically and bravely for his country. He should be hailed as a hero, nothing more and nothing less. Anyone who feels differently should try walking in his shoes.<br />If his only crime was that he didn't vet the book properly, I don't blame him. There is no way this President or anyone in this administration, would have let this truth be exposed, but the American people do deserve, and also have the right, to know what really went down in Pakistan when Bin Laden was captured.<br />The book is about more than the Bin Laden capture. It is this man's story, beginning with his childhood and how his life in Alaska, hunting and fishing alongside his dad, laid the groundwork for his ability to be a Navy Seal. It is about his dream, nurtured in high school, to become one. With his dad, he learned how to survive even under dreadful conditions of cold and exhaustion, so he was mentally ready for the Seals, and he went through the rigorous training, succeeding and eventually becoming part of Seal Team Six.<br />The main thrust of the book concerns the time period he was with the Seals, from 1998-2012. He describes the way the rules of engagement changed as the years passed, often preventing them from doing a proper job, and how the decision making process ground to a halt at times, moving too slowly. Some men felt that risking their lives under such conditions was becoming too risky. They had to warn their enemy before they approached, provide photographic evidence of their militancy and if captured, the emphasis was often on whether the enemy had been abused rather than his militaristic activity.<br />I am not sure why there is such brouhaha about the information in the book. Yes, Bin laden was shot in cold blood, without even a loaded weapon in his room; contrary to the story told by the White House, but the Seals had been fired upon, entering his compound, even if the shots were not fired by Bin Laden. Yes, they dragged his body down the steps, disrespectfully, when we were told he was treated with respect, but then, this man was responsible for the death of thousands of Americans so is anyone really surprised?<br />Paraphrasing, the main objection this Seal voiced, which was a sentiment shared by other Seals, as well, was that the President had a need and/or tendency to take credit for everything to advance himself politically. Even before they captured Osama Bin Laden, they joked about Obama taking credit for it. Still, they said, their mission was what was important, not his speeches or grandstanding.<br />I think the book had a bit too much detail, but still, I found I could not put it down. I thought it was interesting reading about the training, preparation and deployments. I respect what these men sacrifice to guarantee my security, and I applaud their efforts. On the other hand, my husband found it a bit tedious reading about all the preparations for the missions, so reader beware.<br />You may ask if it was necessary to treat Bin Laden's body like a car seat or was it necessary to throw him onto the tarmac \\"like a dead fish\\". I just don't know if he deserved better. Making friends with our enemies has not served us that well, so far. If Washington compromised the safety of the Seals with their leaks of information and pictures, just for political capital, then I think this Seal was within his rights, to write this story.<br />Mr. Bissonnette states that he is donating the majority of the profits from the book, to veterans' or wounded warrior charities. I donated, have you?ights, to write this story.<br />Mr. Bissonnette states that he is donating the majority of the profits from the book, to veterans' or wounded warrior charities.

B008J34466|1.0|I was so excited to see Pink had a new album. I have followed her career with so much anticipation, that I just knew this was going to be the grown up album I knew she could make. As always, her voice is great on this project. But the voice can not make up for the juvenile songwriting on this. Through the second listen, I felt a desperation in Pinks camp. Someone told her that she needed to be relevant to a younger audience....but what they didn't tell her was that those people grow up and move on. I hope this album does well for her because I would like to see what a mature mid-30's Pink will make in a couple of years. I hope to hear her lending her incredible voice to material that deserves it. I just find it so sad that a 33 year old woman would find it necessary to write songs that use profane language just for the sake of it or the lack of having a better vocabulary. Although I gave the album 1 star, I give the artwork a 5. Very cool cover.
B005UBNKZG|4.0|My gf's quad core 3.5 intel outperforms this chip hands down.  I honestly regret purchasing another AMD instead of saving a bit more money and going Intel.  However, personal financial woes and opinions aside - the chip performed as the papers on it advertise.  I got some serious 3D rendering power, program compiling and number crunching out of it through the machine before my Asus mobo ate itself in a rather impressive display of fire and smell of burning bleach.  Intels will always out perform AMD, however the cost to capability on this chip is and will always be good.  If you are on a tight budget, go for it - just make sure to pick your mobo with the loving care one would hold an easter egg.

0307887448|4.0|Wade Watts is a teenager in the year 2044.  The world is a nasty place, and, like most teenagers, he spends his time on the internet, or IN the internet, as it is the future, and the internet is now a worldwide uber-virtual experience where people want to spend the bulk of their time as avatars in an alternate reality.  Wade's idol, the guru of interactive games, leaves his fortune to one lucky person who can successfully navigate a quest through a succession of virtual games, and Wade is determined to be the one to win and change his life, as well as the lives of his friends and the world.<br /><br />I loved the pace of this book; it was a true adventure story and I had a hard time waiting between opportunities to read.  I am a child of the 80's with teenage children of my own, but I didn't find the pop culture references overdone at all.  A lot of them were beyond me - I never played much more than Pac-Man in the 80's, myself, but I very much enjoyed Wade's quest and was holding my breath through dangerous situations - both virtual and real.  I'm recommending this book to my sci-fi/fantasy geek friends as well as my kids.  It's a real escape!
B0087HT36U|4.0|its a little too easy but it get alittle harder but could be more challenging its good to pass time though
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book, which was recommended by a friend.  I liked the plot twist in the middle.  It kept me interested all the way, but I thought the ending was abrupt and kind of anti-climactic.  Still would recommend.

B003UESJH4|5.0|Most movies based upon an historic event are so historically inaccurate that they insult the sensibilities and intelligence of the viewer.  'The King's Speech' is not one of those movies.<br /><br />It tells the story of King Edward VIII's abdication of the British throne in order to marry a twice-divorced American woman of dubious reputation and the agonizing challenge it poses for his younger brother, soon to be crowned, King George VI who suffers from a debilitating stammer and is, therefore, terrified of the speeches and radio addresses that he will be obliged to deliver.<br /><br />The portrayal of how an extremely antagonistic relationship between the King and the therapist, Lionel Logue, who has been hired to help him overcome his speech impediment, gradually blossoms into a close, lifelong friendship manages to be thoroughly entertaining, enjoyable, and emotionally uplifting without sacrificing historical accuracy; thanks primarily to the superb and convincing acting skills of Colin Firth (George VI), Geoffrey Rush (Lionel Logue), and Helena Bonham Carter (Elizabeth, the Kings's wife and mother of the future Queen Elizabeth, England's current ruler).
1594135851|1.0|I recently ordered Catching Fire in the large print edition. Everything was going great until about 3/4 of the way through when pages started jumping around (even though they were numbered as if they were correct) and scenes were skipping ahead and backward. There is literally a page (the one I finally stopped trying to read on) that starts with the letters \\"ing\\". Don't ask me where the rest of the word went. And then after that it skips to another scene! It was very disappointing because I do love these books and really wanted to finish it. :(
B0087HT36U|4.0|I really enjoy this game. its fun to play. challenging enough to keep me interested but not so hard as to make me want to quit. graphics are cute too.
B008B92U32|5.0|I downloaded this app because I was curious, and it really is fun! The controls take a little getting used to, but once you get it, its easy. Just grab a corner of the box to reshape it, and the center to move! While the app seems intuitive enough, I did appreciate that there were instructions on the first page. Overall, if you want some cheap laughs, this is the app to do it. Quirky and ridiculous, you'll be wanting to screw with all of your photos.

1596680296|4.0|A good basic book for knitting socks for beginners. The instructions are accompanied by detailed photos which help the visual learner. The size of the book is ideal for carrying in a small bag with your knitting sock project as a reference. Ann Budd is well-known for a number of books on sock knitting.
B001LKQDCM|5.0|I first listened to this band as a hand-me-down album from my older brother, and continue to escape into it today (nearly 15 years later). Conceptually, it seems sad that older music quickly escapes the attention of most people in our society, as the pursuit of the ever new and novel sound quickly sends perfectly amazing and great music to the bottom of the memory hole: I showed my niece this album a few weeks ago, and she was quite surprised that she hadn't heard of what she assumed was an emerging and unique band. I did feel like a fossil when I told her that I listened to Enigma when I was her age, but it was worth it just to pass the experience along to her!
0385344333|5.0|Just to add to the accolades of the few reviews I've read, I'd like to add my appreciation for Mr. Child's little jab at David Baldacci via naming one of the Wanted Man characters \\"Puller\\" after the Reacher-clone hero of the same name in Baldacci's Zero Day. Touche.
B0086900TI|5.0|From the opening Camus quote to the closing scene, \\"Detachment\\" is an artistic masterpiece.  Behind the story of a school system in disarray lies a deeper look at the human condition.  Brody is at his best as he plays a tender and troubled substitute teaching trying to offer up all he can to his students while struggling with his own troubled past.  Yes, this movie is highly dramatized and deeply disturbing.  But at its core lies an unshakable truth that has resonated with me.<br />  Never have I replayed quotes and scenes from a film so many times after first watching it.  So watch with an open mind.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I liked this game, and didn't find it too difficult to use. You can toggle piece rotation o and off and there is a great variety of puzzles to choose from.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I'm just on my way out the door to grab my copy of the eagerly awaited Indiana Jones Box & thought I'd see what some reviewers think of the transfers & the box as a whole. All I can read is how Lucas has ripped people off again & the crappy cardboard box the movies came in. Seriously!? Ok; I too am sick of the studios ripping consumers & movie lovers off with over-priced, underwhelming box-sets that don't deliver on the quality we expect. But as far as just releasing the first 3 movies; it only makes sense to include all 4 movies in an Indiana Jones box set! I don't think the studios care if some already own the 4th movie. That's what ebay is for. Or just wait til the movies come out individually like the Godfather trilogy or Die Hard. Since I already own Alien maybe they should offer a box set with just Aliens-Alien Resurrection. That makes perfect sense! 5-stars all the way! BTW I didn't buy Crystal Skull just for this reason!
B00422LESE|4.0|A fascinating read for all the wannabe scientists out there. Interesting arguments and relatively simple explanations of incredibly complex concepts make for a good read
B004FRX0MY|2.0|Used to love this app because I'd browse through catalog every few days looking for bargain-priced albums and bought some great stuff. Now, since updates a couple of months ago, app won't even launch on my Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. Bummer.<br />Please fix.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I am not a doctor or nutritionist, but this book makes sense to me.  I now have a much better understanding of how certain diseases like diabetes and high cholesterol affect the body and how wheat contributes to those problems.  I decided to try going wheat free for 4 weeks.  I am currently 1 1/2 weeks into it.  After the first week I lost 10 pounds.  I didn't change anything else except no wheat.  I had pizza one night (I scrapped the toppings off and put them on a wheat-free crust), and I ate at Red Lobster (no biscuits :( ).  I am looking forward to see what week two brings.  These are my personal results and I am not advocating that everyone should try wheat-free.  However, I do think the book is worth the time it takes to read it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first book! I believe this is the first mainstream anti-totalitarian book since 1984. So besides being a quick read, the message behind the books is much stronger in this second book.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|While there aren't any damaging secrets given in the book it still gives you great insight as to how this side of war works - the special teams that defy the rules. It's not on the level of Hampton Sides for example but it is a great story and I loved reading it.

B005LAIHXQ|5.0|When we ask someone, \\"you wanna meet your maker?\\", we're basically asking them if they want to die.  You hear that phrase a lot in action movies.  Take that phrase and let us consider its meaning in a literal sense.  Do you want to meet your maker?  Most people would answer a definite yes.  And that is the underlying theme of this ambitious, thought-provoking movie.  Throughout the eons, man has been longing to meet his maker.  Various belief systems have arisen to address this very desperate longing.  But, what would happen if technology has advanced to the point where this desire of the human heart can now be fulfilled?<br /><br />This movie was inspired by the works of the Swiss author, Erich Von Daniken.  He was the one who had originally proposed the idea that an advanced race of space travelers have visited Earth in the distant past.  And not only that, these ancient visitors have had an impact on the development of civilization, technology, and perhaps even the human species itself.  The works of Zacharia Sitchin have also had a clear influence on the themes of the movie.  Sitchin's works have claimed that a group of advanced humanoids called the Anunaki have influenced ancient humans and their ways of life.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is that a pair of researchers uncovered ancient clues that space travelers may have visited Earth in the past.  Cave paintings and drawings, from diverse geographical locations and different time periods, all indicated the same symbol.  The symbol is a unique star formation.  A star map.  Within the drawings, there is always a figure of a tall humanoid pointing to the stars.  The researchers concluded that this meant an invitation from the \\"Star People\\" to mankind.  With the help of Weyland Industries, the researchers embark on a long journey to the distant star system shown on the star \\"map\\".  After a two year journey onboard Prometheus (the ship), the research team is woken up from their deep sleep and arrives at the destination.  Among the crew is an android, David.  David is an advanced, synthetic humanoid created by the CEO of Weyland Industries.<br /><br />The Prometheus descends on the planet, entering its atmosphere.  Analysis showed that the atmosphere will not support humans.  Donning on their protective gear, the crew sets off to investigate a mysterious structure on the planet's surface.  The structure seems to have been artificial, not natural.  Upon entering the structure, they discover the remnants of what appears to be an alien scientific base camp.  Further exploration took the crew to a temple-like room, littered with metallic cylinders.  An unknown black substance is oozing out of some of the cylinders.  David, with his superior intellect, discovers a recorded hologram of events that took place on the facility more than two thousand years ago.  Meanwhile, Drs. Shaw and Ford decides to bag a preserved alien head in order to take it back to the Prometheus for further study.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the plot for you.  Suffice it to say that the ending will be a surprise.  The reasons for David's mysterious behavior and strange choices will be revealed as the plot unfolds.  Yes, the crew will end up finding a living specimen.  And those acid-blooded creatures from \\"Alien\\" do make an appearance.<br /><br />Technically, Ridley Scott has said that this movie is not a direct prequel to \\"Alien\\".  However, it was inspired by that film franchise, as well as by the works of the authors mentioned above.  HR Geiger's artwork and style also dominate the movie sets.  As you may know, Geiger designed the original Alien.  He also designed Sil, creature in the movie \\"Species\\".  And clearly, the same ferocious creatures in the Alien franchise also are present and wreaking havoc in this film.  The special effects are what you would expect of a high-budget Ridley Scott movie.  Everything about this movie is top-notch.  And that includes the nearly all-star cast.<br /><br />This is the best science fiction movie that I have seen in a long time.  If you are looking for movie in this genre that offers more than action thrills and special effects, then this is it.  And, you will be pleased to know that unlike some of those other \\"cerebral\\" Sci-Fi movies that start off slow, this one actually gets off to a fairly fast start.  Oh, and great performances from Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender, Guy Pierce, and Charlize Theron.is is the best science fiction movie that I have seen in a long time.

B000ID37RM|5.0|I don't often view movies more than once, but this one is worth seeing every few years. It is true to the great novel from which it came. It brilliantly captures through the eyes of a child the nobility as well as the meanness of humankind.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|This is such a great buy! The sound effects are cool, the UV pen works like a charm and the regular pen works smoothly. My only complaint is its a bit of a pain to install/change the batteries (but even then not THAT big a deal). You basically have to disassemble half the screwdriver to get to the battery compartment, but the included instructions make it a snap! Another complaint is the size of the ink cartridge. I just wish it was a bit bigger so it could last longer. I imagine it will run out fairly quickly. Other than that it is exactly what I expected! I highly recommend it for any Time Lords out there! Remember, DON'T BLINK!

031620157X|5.0|I'm not an avid reader. In fact, I am not a reader at all, but being one of the so many Chris Colfer's fans I \\"had to\\" buy the book and read it. It took some time, though, as I was reading only on my daily bus ride to work but it was so much worth it. I know some people gave me funny looks -understandable- while I took to smiling or gasped while deeply immerse in the story, and I must admit I failed miserably at holding back tears whenever I got to the parts about the twins and their dad and, believe it or not, I also felt deeply moved by the Evil Queen's story.<br />The Land of Stories was a fantastic journey. One I enjoyed with the twins moving from Kingdom to Kingdom and back to my childhood and storytelling, but with a welcomed twist. Chris answered some of the same questions I had asked myself so many years ago but made it so much better with his witty sense of humour. I can't wait to follow Alex and Conner in their fantastic journey into The Land of Stories 2.<br />I highly recommend reading The Land of Stories. Whatever your age, it will not disappoint you.<br />Thank you, Chris.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|A bit weird that this book has so many stars. It was not bad i suppose though it had a bit of a &#34;free book&#34; vibe to it. Overall i was intrigued and read it quickly. The end was a bit silly and didnt make sense. Shutter island it wasnt.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I apologise that I am not reviewing the DVD itself; its quality, extras and price etc., but the content of the show.  I am sure that the quality of production for the series 3 DVD will be just as good as the previous ones, just make sure you purchase the unedited version.<br />Downton series 3 kicks off in splendid style, though I am a bit confused about the time line.  Sybil is expecting and barely \\"showing\\" and we are told this is almost 6 months on from the Christmas special, in which we were told she was expecting. The early storyline with Edith is also a major inconsistency for me, but I cannot say why without giving things away.  Apart from these niggles, this series is going to be about change.  The world from top to bottom changed after WW1 and this series is dealing with those issues.  I will not tell what's going on, but there are many changes coming for both upstairs and downstairs at Downton. Shirley Maclaine is terrific with the whole cast, but provides a perfect foil for Maggie Smith and the whole show is worth watching just for those two, well they have the best lines anyway. I only wish she was in it for more than the first 2 episodes. The sets, the costumes, the cars, the house are all wonderful and show such attention to detail.  If you're a fan of Downton you will love series 3.  (and it has been announced there will be a series 4!)
B0090P98Z4|4.0|cool hack n slash. decently fun and controllable. wish more free games were as good. never played the first one.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This second book drags on. The subplot is inserted occasionally. A much darker story line than the first.I read about half the book & put it down. The first was much better.
0307474275|1.0|This book would be such a joke if it had not of been advertised as being well researched and factual. I recommend you listen to Matthew Arnold's commentary on \\"Fallen Fiction\\" on the Truth about Angels and Demons. Dan Brown should be an embarrassment to Hollywood, but is instead glorified. History will show though that he just hates the Catholic Church and will write anything to undermine the church's teaching and her real history. He even calls it entertainment. I guarantee you if he wrote this book about Mohammad he and his books would have been massacred. But alias one can write lies about Christ and the church and get away with it.<br /><br />I also loved \\"The Da Vinci Hoax\\" by Carl Olson and \\"Crackling the da vinci Hoax\\" by Jimmy Akin. Both which have proved very enlighterning and are backed by truly good research. Please don't comment until you have researched the other point of view. It's so biased.<br /><br />The errors in the Da Vinci Code are so numerous (it's a \\"da\\" moment). One needs to write a book to cover them all. Hence my suggestions.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code maybe a thriller and a mystery, but it is over 90% lies and deception in my opinion. Dan Brown has agruments in it that don't hold water, since many of his \\"so called research\\" is hundreds of years off and could not of happened the way he stated. The man is a fraud.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|There was great potential for disaster with the rebooting of this beloved franchise, particularly if it traveled the road the new version of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" did in its last three seasons, when that show went terribly wrong. But no worries; the re-imagined \\"Trek\\" is a great movie, the third best of the franchise after \\"Khan\\" and \\"The Voyage Home,\\" (STII and STIV, respectively).<br /><br />Why? The director, writers and producers took the concept of the original series and mined its mythology as history. There are references galore to many of the original episodes and to five of the first six movies (except for the awful fifth one). The performances aren't caricatures; they actually build on what we expect the characters to have been like in their youth (but keep in mind this remains an alternate reality motif).<br /><br />Especially outstanding are the internal struggles of Spock in finding his place as a vulcan with a human heritage (borrowing from the best of the cartoon episodes from the early 1970s) to McCoy's sly and all-too-human cynicism.  (A special nod to Zachary Quinto for his sublime performance as a young Spock.) There are so many great touches in the story, like including Capt. Pike, keeping Riverside, Iowa as the future home of Kirk and the uniforms and sound effects of the original (but updated to the 21st century). The ending was another nice nod to the original show.<br /><br />The plot is a little thin and contrived at times. Nero is simply a new variation of Khan from STII and the original series. Albeit one decidedly less interesting because Eric Bana is not as strong an actor as Ricardo Montalban, at least not in this movie. Also because Nero lacks Khan's grandiose back story, the character's devastatingly complex and sometimes contradictory pathos, and his extraordinary magnetism.<br /><br />Still, this is a movie whose parts more than supersede the sum. Great fun but touching. Gene Roddeberry would've been proud.

She found herself, and made peace with herself, and learned to love herself again.  What a great journey we go on with her, because the writing flows well, with humor and tendernes and courage.  She is very descriptive of the beautiful places she \\"lives\\" in.  And I enjoyed all the characters she introduced and how much she learned about herself by being with them. It's just a lovely story that left me feeling that there is always room for growth in our lives, and we are in the driver's seat.

I have re read it twice since dont look<br />to try to find secret killing finger holds or other stuff like that its not there.<br />This book is written in a first person narrative that i found to be a little hard to track at first but soon it felt like Mark Owen was sitting across my kitchen table and telling me his experiances one on one. All the negitive press this book generated almost caused me to not purchase it, Glad i followed my gut now.

0142427837|5.0|The Long Walk by Richard Bachman (Stephen King) is my all time favorite book. I first read it in 1993 and have read it about 30 times since. I recently found out it was on CD and decided to order it and take a listen. I wasn't taking a trip so I listened to and from work and around town so it took a couple days, which I liked because it stretched it out. The reader did a terrific job emitting emotion into the characters. I could feel pain in my own feet as he read. My only complaint was his accent for Art Baker. Baker has a southern drawl and the reader gave him a Gone With The Wind plantation accent. A little off in my mind. And I believe he was reading from the paperback version and not the Bachman Books version even though he did read the Why I was Bachman segment. I say this because in the Bachman Books version, the Walker who comes in fifth place is named Milligan but in the paperback solo version he is named Rattigan. The reader read Rattigan.<br />If you love the book as much as I do I suggest you get it just to have it in your collection. What a great tale.

From the very 1st episode, I was going between being utterly horrified & confused at the same time.  When everything becomes clear towards the end of the series, it was pure enjoyment!  Not for the weak stomached.  Lots of graphic violence.  Lots of slit throats, lots of babies in jars.  I can't wait until season 2 starts!  Keep the nastiness coming!

B0072CNNN0|5.0|Before the making of this, their second album (RCA Victor LPM/LSP 3766), original Jefferson Airplane drummer Alexander \\"Skip\\" Spence had departed sometime in 1966, replaced by Spencer Dryden, and former vocalist with San Francisco's The Great Society, Grace Slick, had joined that same fall as their new lead vocalist, thereby giving this quintessential psychedelic rock band a decidedly different sound.<br /><br />Released in February 1967, and quickly finding favour in California's counter-culture movement, it soon reached # 3 on Billboard's album Top 200 and by July had gained gold status. It also produced two Billboard Pop Hot 100 singles - their first on those charts - and one near-miss. The results of their initial single, My Best Friend, were not exactly encouraging as the best it could do early in 1967 was a # 103 on the Hot 100 Bubble Under charts b/w How Do You Feel? on RCA Victor 9063.<br /><br />But then came one Grace had cut with The Great Society in 1966 on North Beach 1001 called Someone To Love, penned by her brother-in-law Darby Slick. Changing the title to Somebody To Love, it became their best hit ever in their guise as Jefferson Airplane as it peaked at # 3 Hot 100 in April/May 1967 on RCA Victor 9140 b/w She Has Funny Cars. That was followed in July by the # 8 Hot 100 White Rabbit on RCA Victor 9248 b/w Plastic Fantastic Lover. These would be the only two times they'd crack the Top 10 as Jefferson Airplane, although they'd do it six more times as Jefferson Starship/Starship, including two # 1s in the 1980s.<br /><br />Lingering controversy over whether or not Grateful Dead guitarist Jerry Garcia had a hand in the album continues unabated, but on the reverse cover RCA prints \\"Jerry Garcia, musical and spiritual adviser\\" among the credits - something always denied by album producer Rick Jarrard. In any event, Rolling Stone magazine lists Surrealistic Pillow at # 146 on their \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\\"<br /><br />At the time the band consisted of: lead guitarist/vocalist Jorma Kaukonen; vocalist/guitarist Marty Balin; lead vocalist/pianist Grace Slick (also organ and recorder); rhythm guitarist/vocalist Paul Kantner; Jack Casady on bass, fuzz bass and rhythm guitar; and drummer/percussionist Spender Dryden.<br /><br />The tracks, with writers shown in brackets, are:<br />Side 1<br />1.

B0015AARJI|1.0|I ordered an extra controller but didn't open it for 3 days because I didn't need it. This ended up being after the return period. After connecting the controller, it doesn't hold a charge very long, when it vibrates it sounds like something is loose inside and makes a loud rattling noise. The thumb sticks are not calibrated correctly so if you're playing a football game it's almost impossible to run at an angle it will start running straight or directly to the left or right, but  not diagonal. I would not order from this seller again.
B005JJVGBO|5.0|Following a so-so start in North America with his first album, Mona Bone Jakon (A&M 4260) in summer 1970 for this U.K.-born vocalist, which struggled to a # 164 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts, Tea For The Tillerman, which was released in November of that year (A&M 4280) got as high as # 8 and went gold by May 1971. Since then it has reached multiple platinum status. It was also listed at # 206 in Rolling Stone's 2003 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time, and three years later was named in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.<br /><br />It also includes his first U.S. Billboard Pop Hot 100 single, Wild World, which reached preceded the album and hit # 11 Hot 100 and # 21 Adult Contemporary (AC) in February/March 1971 on A&M 1231 b/w Miles from Nowhere. Another track, Where Do The Children Play?, formed the B-side of his October 1971 # 1 AC (3 weeks)/#7 Hot 100 hit, Peace Train on A&M 1291.<br /><br />Also in 1970, the track But I Might Die Tonight was used in the Jerzy Skolimowski film Deep End. Which deals with a love-smitten adolescent stalking and trying to destroy the relationship between the love of his life and her fianc&eacute;, and a year later the cult film Harold & Maude from Hal Ashby and Colin Higgins  featured those two B-sides mentioned above, along with Tea For The Tillerman and On The Road To Find Out. The eye-catching front cover features some of the talented Stevens' art-work. The track Father And Son was to have been included in a 1970 musical about Tsar Nicholas and his wife Alexandra, but apparently that was shelved.<br /><br />Backing Stevens, who also plays guitar and keyboard, are Alun Davies on 2nd guitar (also backing vocals) bass guitarist John Ryan, violinist John Rostein, and drummer Harvey Burns. Strings are arranged by Del Newman. In 1978 Stevens would convert to the Muslim religion and record thereafter as Yusef Islam.<br /><br />The tracks, all written by Stevens, are:<br />Side 1<br />1. Where Do The Children Play? - 3:48<br />2. Hard Headed Woman - 3:42<br />3. Wild World - 3:15<br />4. Sad Lisa - 3:39<br />5. Miles From Nowhere - 3:30<br />Side 2<br />1.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Sad that it is the last in the series! I enjoyed all of them. It is a good end to the series and very suspenseful.
0061120073|5.0|Have you ever had a book that you did not want to end? Because it sucked you in, grabbed your heart, transported you to a place and a time you did not want to leave? If so, you have been lucky. If not, this is the book. It has captivated me since I first read it in middle school, and I read it at least once a year.<br /><br />The title refers to a tree that only grows in Brooklyn. No one plants it, no one really tends it, they don't want it, but there, stuck in the cement, often deprived of sunlight, the tree grows into a thing of beauty. This is the story of Francie Nolan, a child growing up in slums of turn of the century Brooklyn, and her family, Neeley, her little brother, Johnnie, her drunkard father, and Katie, her mother, who works hard and doesn't have time for her dreamy daughter. The story follows Neeley and Francie as they grow up and deal with life's trials and small joys, all while beautifully describing their community in a way that places the reader in Brooklyn and makes you yearn for life to be like that again, even just a minute.<br /><br />I have read other books by Betty Smith, and this is, by far, her best book. Francie is such a lovely, well-drawn character. The reader can not help but feel for her as she deals with the sometimes rough life she has been given. When the children go to the doctor after playing in the dirt all day and a nurse makes rude comments about dirty children, we hurt because Francie hears her and hurts, and cheer her for standing up to the nurse, and, when the children earn a Christmas tree by letting the seller throw it at them (a tradition), we cheer because they've come out ahead in a world where that doesn't happen often. I laugh at the events of their trip to the shore with their father and a neighbor child because it reminds me of the good-intentioned but poorly-executed day trips of my childhood. But we WANT Francie to succeed, for her to be OK in the end.  It's hard to find many books that make you care about a character so deeply and this book does it so well.<br /><br />I look forward to the day when I can read this with my daughter and let her discover the beauty of the story.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Absolutely love this game, works great on my andriod. No trouble at all, as some have reported.<br />Looking forward to more levels.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A very well written journal of what transpired when Osama was killed.  I found the author to be straight forward and up front about the events which occurred.  Once I started reading the book it was difficult to put it down.  I finished it within 48 hours.  I saw no evidence of any classified material being disclosed.  It is nice to finally know the truth about what occurred that night.  Well Done Chief.<br /><br />  HM1, USN, Ret.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Great show.  Recommend to anyone who loves British comedy.  Watch it over again after 6 months or so.  Great relief for the blahs and blues.  Absolutely thumbs up!

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very interesting read from someone who can give a firshand account of multiple SEAL missions. I think it cleared up what really happened during the take down of UBL.
B007SGM084|4.0|Most of the book was a \\"page turner\\" but it did get a little redundant in some parts.  I must admit, I was a little disappointed in the end.  I felt the end was somewhat anti-climatic compared to the rest of the book.  Overall, it is a great read.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|This is a great animated movie. I enjoyed it very much. I think \\"Starship Troopers: Invasion\\" falls in with the series very well.<br /><br />Keep in mind that there is some nudity and swear words in this title, as such it may not be appropriate for kids. Get the kids [[ASIN:B0009I8QI6 Roughneck Chronicles]] instead.<br /><br />The only negative for me was that the characters looked different from the actors in the movie. Maybe the authors could not do it for legal reasons, but I would have enjoyed the cartoon more if Carmen Ibanez looked like Denise Richards, Carl Jenkins like Neil Patrick Harris. Johnny Rico does look a little like Casper Van Dien, though.<br /><br />Overall: excellent work. Keep it up!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|No need to rehearse the plot or praise for the acting ....it was a lovely film in which you know the end at the beginning, and therefore, the joy of the film is to watch as the characters work their way there.... No absurd plot jiggles to make it all work out, no surrealistic successes, just a good film to remind those of us who aren't sure we are up to one more challenge that it is possible but may not turn out the way we expected or wanted.... To quote the cheesy but nonetheless apt line from the film \\"everything will turn out fine in the end and if everything isn't fine, it's not the end\\".  A delightful two hours, thanks.

0374214913|4.0|As other reviewers have retold the plot line in detail I won't redo so here. This book was a very gripping \\"light\\" (no blood & guts) mystery. I had a hard time putting this book down, and quickly fell in love with the characters, and especially enjoyed the relationship between Clay and Mr. Penumbra. This book is full of references that maybe only a techie would fully understand- for example- the technology used at Google, the inner workings of a book scanner and writing code but it is completely enjoyable none-the-less. The only reason this book is not 5 stars is because of the afterward. The author seemed to want to make sure everything was played out and finished by the last page- this is not always a bad things and it would have worked in this story except it felt rushed and the tone in which it is narrated seems to change slightly in an awkward way.
B009329Y30|5.0|THIS WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE I WOULD WATCH THIS MOVIE AGAIN.I WOULD SAY IT IS A CHICK MOVIE BUT U MEN WILL ENJOY IT ALL-SO.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This flashlight is excellent.<br /><br />The main beam of light on its highest setting is extremely bright and lights up objects that are 300-400 metres away.<br /><br />The light has a concentrated tight beam that goes the distance and is surrounded by a lesser bright halo of light that lights up the more immediate area, this is the same for all four of the brightness settings, and also for the strobe setting but it is a little less obvious.<br /><br />It is tempting to just use the brightest light setting most of the time but in confined areas it is too bright.<br /><br />After using my ledlenser X21 most of the time I was a bit concerned the TK41 might not be as versatile because of no beam focusing ability, but with the four degrees of brightness (toggling through the modes to get to the desired brightness takes getting used to), the strobe (hold the toggle button down for a couple of seconds) and the way the light gives distance and short range illumination I am very happy with it and use it regularly.<br /><br />At 800 lumens it is a very bright but unassuming sized light. The size is very handy and I am having to ask my girlfriend where it is all the time because she enjoys using it regularly also.<br /><br />It seems reasonably solid but I don't think you want to make a habit of dropping it, the lens and reflector don't look like they would enjoy to much punishment.<br /><br />So far after a few weeks of regular use on one set of batteries it still seems to be as bright as the first day.<br /><br />An enjoyable flashlight to use.<br /><br />D
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I had been anxiously awaiting the release of this film for over a year and it delivered on all aspects.  Like many of Scott's films you enjoy Prometheus even more the second time around.  I am looking forward to the DVD release with director commentary.

0756407125|4.0|I try not to leave reviews unless I have a five-star review to leave, just because I feel like so many negative reviews tend to deal only with things that are a matter of opinion and fail to take into account that a book can actually be good for what it is even if you hated it, and I'd just as soon let other people reflect negatively on something than do it myself, because I don't like to do that and so many other people DO...  But here I am, leaving a four star review.  The reason I'm leaving it, though, is a little ironic.  As I mentioned, I only really feel driven to leave reviews for those books which are favorites and I get really excited about, and, this being one of them, I sat down to give it that attention.  It just so happens that this book landed on my list of 'favorites' without being a 5-star book.<br /><br />This is why that happened...  Overall, I really loved it.  Having loved the first book, this one was highly anticipated.  And I was not disappointed; reading it, I felt just as addicted to turning another page as I had with the first.  It was compelling.  It was funny.  It was smart.  It was lovely.  It was original.  I loved the characters in a way that is rare, finding that I looked forward to their every-day conversation almost as much as anything else, just because I cared about them and loved the way they talked and interacted.  I genuinely wanted to hang out with them, and after the book was over missed them as though we HAD been hanging out all that time.<br /><br />I loved each sub-plot, which also doesn't usually happen.  Usually I get a little annoyed with sub-plots and how they interrupt one another, but I honestly got into each new setting and sub-storyline and quickly didn't want IT to end, only to fall in love with the next one as well.<br /><br />I loved all the imaginative cultural differences encountered throughout the story and how the main character experienced them, and how you as a reader experience them and get so into them that they soon seem like second-nature.  It was so cool.<br /><br />I loved the excitement, the old rivalries, the descriptions of places, and really loved the dynamic of a certain central romance.  I didn't so much appreciate the sexual exploits that became central as soon as the main character had a taste of such, but I did appreciate that they weren't as explicit as they could have been (that would have gotten old even faster than what already seems to be stuck on repeat come page 600-and-something).<br /><br />While something like that might be taken as a matter of opinion, I would actually beg to differ here, but I'll put why instead of just saying 'I didn't like it, so it was bad, and here's 4 stars'...  Regardless of opinion on sex existing as a central part of a given book, I really didn't feel as though it was fitting with the first-person narrative.  The story is told from the main character's point of view, but not as if he's just addressing the imaginary reader in the private pages of a journal-like book.  He's actually telling the story to someone else, with his voice, and as such I didn't find myself expecting the kind of explicit content you might otherwise find.  It just seemed as though this might inspire a little bit of reservedness on his part regarding those types of things, and I found myself surprised when he just lay it all out, un-hindered, over and over.  It just didn't seem realistic.<br /><br />But perhaps more valid a reason for 4 stars, if that doesn't quite cut it, is the typo factor.  I was surprised how many typos I found in this book.  One or two - okay, that would be easy for anyone to miss in a 1,000 page book.  But I just kept finding them, and at some point that docks the professionalism.<br /><br />All in all, I thought it was a great sequel.  (Although, I find myself still not being sure why the heck it's called The Wise Man's Fear...  Perhaps I just forgot to keep an eye out for that while I was reading it, but, as I'm not goingto go back over 1,000 pages just to re-scour for that and probably only end up getting distracted again anyway...I guess I'll never know, unless someone decides they would care to enlighten me...)

B007GCY8FS|3.0|I'm a big Reacher fan having read all of the books. But was disappointed with the latest. Read on my Kindle, it wasn't until I was 88% done with the book, that Reacher actually hurt or killed anybody. Rather a slow start to say the least.  It kept my interest but most definitly the slowest of the Reacher novels. Wait for the paperback imo.<br />PS-Tom Cruise is NOT Jack Reacher. how could Lee C pick a midget to play Reacher???????

B008BM9L72|3.0|I bought the trilogy so that I could read the entire work at the same time.  I found the story readable, but it became rather repetitive.  I mean, how many ways are there to describe making love.  There is not much else to this book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was clearly written well but the main characters are just very unlikeable.  I always rate my enjoyment of a book by how much I miss the characters when I've finished it.  In this case, I couldn't have cared less about the main characters and was glad to be done with it.  I concede it had some interesting twists and turns but wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

1554512115|3.0|I love the original version of this book, but found that the \\"revised text\\" edition used in the board book took most of the character out of the story.  Examples: \\"burned all her clothes with his fiery breath\\" becomes \\"burnt up her clothes\\", and a whole page of fun, imagination-inspiring narrative ending with \\"he was easy to follow because he left a trail of burnt forests and horses' teeth\\" is revised to end with simply \\"followed the dragon to his cave.\\"<br /><br />It seems that there is a fear of using too many big words with young children.  Or maybe there is a feeling that parents don't want to be bothered to explain the big words while reading to their kids.  Whatever the reason, it's a shame.<br /><br />The illustrations remain the same as in the original, however.  I let my children look at the board book while reading to them from my tiny, dilapidated original version so they can hear a good story.<br /><br />I highly recommend purchasing the original version of this book, not the board book.

0345803493|2.0|This is my last favorite book in the trilogy. (Semi-spoiler) It took me 3 times longer to finish this book than the first 2 took me. It's very dull and I did not like shift in Christian Grey's character. He become so incredibly needy and a big baby. We all know he has a lot of emotional problems but it was just getting really annoying. He is controling, that of course we all know, but his whiney attitute didn't keep my attention. This book didn't have the passion and the fire the first 2 had. Very dull and forced myself to finish it just so I could complete the series. If this wasn't part of the trilogy I wouldn't even give it a second look and woud have probably stopped reading it a couple chapters in. Just couldnt get into it.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|I watched this series (Season 1) after seeing two episodes of \\"Game of Thrones\\", a series that frankly makes me nauseous, (yeah, I saw two, I should've quit after the first) and I've got to say that the show deserves so much better than to be the unknown series it is. It was such a relief to watch a show with a story. I am definitely going to read the Terry Goodkind books now, which is more than I can say for the Thrones books! Unlike some scifi stories, it doesn't meander too far from its premise, and doesn't introduce too much magic (read-\\"plot device\\") creatures, jewelry, etc, it works with a certain set of given magical \\"things\\", and it's obvious the writer makes a conscious effort to do that. Those that he does come up with are truly interesting-a woman who's the hero's friend who can enslave people with a touch, (and ironically she's actually a nice lady...) or the hero himself who is somehow a hero without seeming falsely goody. And the problems are realistic in the way the writer presents them, and the solutions logical. The show isn't saccharine, but it is certainly less harsh and depressing than Game of Thrones. Why compare the two? Because I just can't seem to get away from ads from that series, and it is so undeserving of the praise it gets. (It's just another downer-another offensive, violent series from HBO, only Thrones has a Renaissance-fair-guys-with-lutes-with tights-thing about it.) On the other hand, here's this beautiful show, with beautiful people in it, with a real story, and I had never heard of it until I went searching for highly-rated Amazon shows! It deserves the rating it keeps getting from Amazon viewers.<br /><br />I have to add that after several episodes that the show starts to get kind of \\"Star Trek\\" and a few bad cliches begin to emerge (someone gets amnesia from a blow to the head). But all in all, still a pretty good show that I'll keep watching.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I just could not get into this book.  I thought I downloaded a sample, but no - I bought it.  It just is starting out so slow.  I found I wanted to get the vacuuming done instead.  I gave it more than one star because I am not giving it more of a chance.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This app is agrrat way to relax while keeping your mind sharp.<br />The levels by themselves do not seem to be that difficult but completing them in perfect moves is a different matter.<br />I highly recommend this app.
B005LAIHGI|1.0|I love the weird humor of Sacha Baron Cohen and especially Borat, Which in my opinion was wonderful.I have watched it many times and always had a great laugh. Having said that ,I just finished watching The Dictator.  It's not that it was in poor taste, it just wasn't funny. Oh there are one or two little chuckles but not enought to justify. Between this and Bruno it looks like he's becoming the M. Night Shyamalan of the comedy world.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is an easy read,with insites into the author and his team mates.I like the information on seal teams training and attitude of the men taking part in it.

B008LZYR0A|5.0|This is one of the finest collection of tracks on any PSB EP. And the CD is given muscle by its extraordinary b-sides.\\"A Certain Je Ne Sais Quoi\\" is vintage disco electronica that grabs you immediately with its catchy lyrics and narrative.  \\"The Way through the Woods\\" is a sprawling languid  dreamy track.\\"I Started A Joke\\" concludes this collection with its lovely English pop sensibility with PSB's special imprint. The Cd is housed in a slim cardboard slip case with song listing and credits on the reverse. With The release of Elysium and this collection of B-sides PSB has given their fans one of their finest musical moments of their career. Long live the Pet Shop Boys!!
0307730697|5.0|I want to extend my deepest condolences to Adam's family and those of his teammates who perished during their noble and heroic service to our country.  Your stories brought me tears.  Your sacrifices will never be forgotten in my family.  My family and I are war refugees, and we love America because of all the goodness that there is here.  I am a proud AMERICAN, but I'm from somewhere else, and I'll be the first to tell you that there is no greater place than America on this planet.  If you're from here, and you don't love this country, you're a fool.  Yes, there are things that need to be fixed, but that's the great thing, we have the mechanisms to fix them.  We just have to keep working at it.  Love this country like Adam and his teammates.  Do all that you can.  Live a life larger than your own.  It is your responsibility to do so for your children.  Thank you Adam and all the men like you who give us our freedom.
B001G5IJVK|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I do not have this compilation, but I do have the entire KISS catalog, including the solo albums (sans Paul's later solo albums) as well as the KISSology DVD (which I ripped as wav files to listen on my iPod). If you're \\"new\\" to KISS or are familiar with their work, but do not have a collection established as of yet, then this appears to the the perfect stepping stone. Many of my fellow reviewers pointed out the gems on here, many which previously were \\"obscure\\" (for lack of a better word) tracks such as \\"Almost Human,\\" \\"Charisma\\" and \\"Dirty Livin'\\" and some are familiar, obligatory gems that show up on each and every KISS compilation - and there have been many. They may not be the most musically proficient band, but in my opinion they are the hardest working band in show business, still putting on one hell of an electrifying performance after all these years. I got my introduction to hard rock/heavy metal through the \\"Love Gun\\" album 35 years ago and have been a fan ever since. Will I get this set? Probably not, as I have the entire catalog. But it is the most comprehensive set out there, even giving the guitar case box set a run for its money.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|After the thrill and great writing of the first two books I had very high expectations.  What I liked about these books being a sci-fi fan was the focus on sci-fi and light on the the teen drama.  I think the writing in this book like the previous two was excellent.  An easy read with excellent detail.  What I found disappointing was the characters.  I am not going to give away the plot but needless to say it was much more a teen drama where the main character whines through most of the book and the ending, though ironic, seemed rushed and unsatisfying.<br /><br />Good book but a little disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|super fun lots of quest to complete only down side is the number of acorns you need. they are hard to get unless you buy them and to purchase all that is required for everything would cost around $400.00 but if your patient you can accomplish most stuff without purchasing them. it will just take 6-8 months of daily playing. but what do you expect from a free game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I have it on my x box 360 the only thing I don't like about it is that u have 2 be close to play with friends
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|This movie doesn't seem to be nearly as well liked as the first one and I'm not sure why that is. I thought this still contained the Holmes and Watson from the first film, just with a less 'traditional' focus and more character development between the two main characters, and of course the addition of Moriarity. I will agree that this is not the Holmes I imagine from reading the official novels & short stories, but there really isn't that many inconsistances between two; the movies just focus more on the action and grit instead. I wouldn't say this is the best Holmes adaptation, I too liked the first movie better, but that doesn't make the sequel bad in/of itself. It had action, intrigue, mystery, drama, and even a little romance. Enjoy this movie for what it is, a different yet still mostly accurate representation of Sherlock Holmes. I know there are those who will disagree with that assessment but not only was Holmes a respected fighter, in multiple styles and with multiple instruments, but his final 'battle' with the good Professor was in fact a fist-fight.
B004GYY714|5.0|very good app love it is awesome and I spend hours on it better than Pandora by a million times
B007UXSPK2|5.0|The best of the franchise. There are many over-the-top moments but the movie delivers on every level. My family and I look forward to a continuation of such well-made cinema.
B005LAIGRS|2.0|The movie packaging was excellent. The movie did not start with the menu screen as my other DVD movies. I had to manually select the \\"movie parts\\" so that my media player could run all in sequence.<br />The movie was very good until I got to the 5th scene (The part where they are in the township with the containers and Denzel has to escape across the rooftops) when it suddenly switched to Spanish. My disappointment was such that I almost did not want to watch the remaining scenes, but it then switched back to English for the last two scenes.<br /><br />Should I return this DVD or should I just forget I ever saw it?<br /><br />Disappointed.
B00746O3X8|5.0|I looked at a few harnesses, I was glad I picked this one. I do Infrared Inspections and my camera is 8-9 lbs.<br />I used a neck strap is hard to work with. The harness is great and more productive and keep my imager from swinging around. Great harness. roofscanirnj.com
B0087HT36U|3.0|as so many have complained, there are IAPs, which I don't really mind unless they are the only way to beat the game. this is not necessarily like that. so far, I've been able to pass each level easily and in some cases with a bit more difficulty. the complaint about waiting to see if you passed with a gold crown can be alleviated by watching the points being added up (the crown up top will shoot off some sparks if you earned enough points). if you didn't, you can just pause and reload the level. the reason I gave just 3 stars is for the floating structures and the sometimes odd physics. overall, though, worth giving a try if knock down games are your thing.
B008XG1X18|4.0|i love finally  having this app for my kindle fire!  it loads quickly and is easy to navigate. great .
B0087HT36U|2.0|Very frustrating to have achieved \\"Gold Crown\\" for every level but 2-28.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it's impossible to explode a bomb before the cart makes contact and the peasant is killed, making it impossible to achieve the \\"Gold Crown\\" achievement.
B007P06DJK|5.0|The remastering of this classic album is excellent, and the additional songs are a worthwhile bonus.  The DVD that's included is fine, but I wish that it was the original concert instead, since the film is something to watch once while the concert would be watched more frequently.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Combination hog/adventure/mystery game.  Great graphics, storyline, and puzzles.  My wife is playing it on her Fire and loves it, I played it on my Galaxy Tab 2, 10.1 and it worked fine.  I think I'll have to change my handle to Big Fish Fanatic.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I love this CD.  Some of the songs are really beautiful, including the hidden track.  And he is nothing short of AMAZING in concert.  Just saw him for the second time last month.  Buy it and you will not be sorry.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Amazing album, amazing demo songs, amazing DVD concert (quality is acceptable for what was available) great remastering. Amazing collection, WELL worth the money. Wish the Michael album in 2010 was given this treatment...

B008MG1E4A|5.0|great to read the facts instead of a Hollywood version released from the White House<br /><br />details of the helicopter crash, the lack of a fire fight as the Seals advanced in the compound, the fact ODL died while not trying to defend himself,that the Seals carried out the mission knowing the White House was going to take all the glory and credit, also the Seals knowing that the invite for a beer was an empty promise<br /><br />Mark deserves credit for exposing the truth without compromising any secrets
B005LTDPJI|5.0|I've got all the ELO albums, but when i saw the price for this set of 11 classic platters, i had to get it.  Jeff Lynne is one of the best artists ever.  This set is all re-mastered, with a 28 page booklet, all for a paltry $31.00!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is a must buy if you love the comic book. I can't see a reason why you won't love part 1. It follows the comic book very very close. The action is top notch and the story is very entertaining. Under the red hood was my favorite movie until now. This movie simple rocks and i can't wait for part 2.
030758836X|5.0|This book is fantastic. It's my first by Gillian to read and I can't wait to read the other two. She really keeps you guessing to a point and the characters are very real and easy to imagine.
0143119680|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it!!<br /><br />Just want to say....I'm so tired of reviewers who like to listen to themselves \\"write\\".  Please stop rehashing the story!  You're not writing a report for school...Those who haven't read the book yet can read the Kirkus Reviews, etc....just say what you thought about it..PERIOD!!!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|I love the quickness of this app,  but it wont always load. needs a little fixing.  but I would still recommend this all in all
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Warning: attempt at thematic explanation ahead>>> May be rough going for some vieweres.Just as ice cream is packed full o'flavor, so Prometheus seems to be packed full o'themes. God. Man. Creator. Created. Oedipus. Charlize Theron. Umm. so. What a beyootiful movie. The budget on this. However, if one chooses to speculate on the nature of man (what about women?) and g-d, I imagine it's hard to do so without revealing personal bias. And, in the view of this particular viewer, I think it can be said the movie carries certain bias points about the nature of god. e.g., Why does HE want to kill us? Which from the point of view of this viewer, is a pretty brutal question to ask. The question of course, is answered in the next installment. As for the visuals, pacing, directing, etc.. very impressive. Of course, no Avatar, but, impressive.
0786180412|5.0|This audio program was excellent.  The characterizations were wonderful.  The characters came alive and made the listener feel like he/she was really getting to know them.  In this day of poor TV programing, listening to this great old story on CD was an excellent entertainment and a great way to relive this wonderful ageless story.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was ok, but really didn't have much new. The TV show \\"60 Minutes was aired as I was reading the book.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Had a bunch of the family over and put this on. The consensus was that it was a good choice, even from people who did not follow sports. I read the book before I saw the movie so I could fill in any missing pieces but so what... A film can never get in all of the details of a book.. I think it was one of Brad Pitt's best performances... I highly recommend...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the game and can't wait for the next installment.  The story was very good along with the graphs.  I would recommend this game.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I got addicted to this little gem.  Wasn't to difficult but with so many levels, I was hooked.  More levels please.
B008J34466|4.0|After writing a poor review on this CD, I decided to delete it because I realized I didn't listen very carefully to this CD when I bought it. After listening to it a few times, I must admit, this album, even though some of the songs aren't as good, It's a very well done album. The 4th song, Just Give Me A Reason featuring Nate Ruess,, is a beautiful love song. Cry, the third song is also excellent. I don't quite care for the first track, Are We All We Are, but I must admit, this CD does have some good songs. I think what really upset me that caused me to write such a negative review, is the 7th track, Slut Like You. I don't like it at all, but the other songs are very good! Yes, PNK does have some adult themes in her songs, but I have decided not to slam an artist because of that anymore publicly on amazon. Great album!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I LOVE PINTEREST!  IT'S ADDICTIVE THOUGH,  I ACTUALLY HAVE TO SET TIME LIMITS SO I CAN TRY ALL THESE GREAT IDEAS I'M GETTING.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|I can't begin to tell you what songs to listen to on this excellent CD.  TThis is Bob Dylan at his best! The first song, Duquesne Whistlem sort of has a country flaver. The whole album is top notch! Soon After Midnight is a nice blues song. Highly recommended!
034580404X|5.0|I haven't read for a long time. I picked up these books and couldnt put it down. Now I having problem with reading others. I hope she writes more.
B000002J03|1.0|This CD was very poorly recorded. In fact, it sounded more like a \\"bootleg\\" recording than a \\"re-mastered\\" CD. The volume is very low and the sound is muffled throughout the CD. I would definately NOT recommend this product!
030758836X|4.0|(if this review seems a little confusing, im jusy trying not to give any spoilers away!)<br />This book had me hooked from the beginning. The first part of the book is told from Nick's POV and diary entries from his missing wife, Amy. I was absolutely convinced Nick was the ultimate creep. If its true that sometimes the simplest explanation is the most likely, then I figured it was cut and dry-Nick killed Amy. Then you get deeper into the novel, and all the twisted psychological aspects of it...it's crazy. The lengths certain people went to in this story blew my mind. However, I do think that with all the preparations, one of the protagonists gets a little careless when meeting other people. It just seemed like everything up until that point was so painstakingly erected, that this part of the story seemed a little off. But, in real life even the most careful people make mistakes, and there had to be a turning point somewhere... Regardless, I read this book in a day. I couldn't put it down, and it had me thinking for a long time after...
B0034JYC7G|5.0|I want to start off by saying you are NOT BUYING BOSE HEADSETS HERE!<br /><br />They are $20 headsets and they are well worth the price!<br /><br />I've been using mine for over a year now and they still work perfectly. I even dropped one into a cup of water accidentally and after letting them dry off they work perfectly again.<br /><br />The sound is fantastic for $20 headsets and the microphone is a plus for using them with your phone.<br /><br />If you want to pick up a pair of headsets for $20...go with these!
B000O599ZS|2.0|I liked the music, the nature was amazing - love watching the nature in these western movies<br />John Wayne's a great actor but the attitude he stands for is spoiled. George W Bush ruining of the cowboy image was one of the damages he made and Wayne characterizing the obstinate bully mentality that Bush took was not pleasant to see. I always liked Wayne but having seen this movie I see that while he's still a good guy and I like him, the cowboy mentality as exhibited by Bush is bankrupt. Also I didn't like the spirit of the movie which constantly had conflict as part of it - obviously all these characters were  in conflict w/ themselves else they'd know a more peaceful way of relating (not talking about komancho vs white but just between and within whites too)
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app was so great...till it quit working all of the sudden. Hope they fix it soon...jams up my Kindle Fire every single time I try to use it.

0307960471|4.0|\\"Phantom,\\"a mystery/thriller, is seventh in the increasingly best-selling Detective Harry Hole series by the Norwegian author Jo Nesbo.  Of Nesbo and his creation Hole, Michael Connelly, the dean of American hardboiled mystery authors, has said, \\"Jo Nesbo is my new favorite thriller writer and Harry Hole my new hero.\\"<br /><br />Nesbo's books, translated into 40 languages, have sold more than eight million copies world wide: his last, [[ASIN:0307743187 The Leopard]] was a number one international best seller. Of Nesbo's previous Harry Hole novels, I've read and reviewed [[ASIN:0061133981 The Devil's Star]], [[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman]], and THE LEOPARD, in these pages, and found a lot to admire about the ingenuity of the author.  But I disliked the boredom factor introduced by Hole's attributed alcoholism: it's just not that interesting to read about a person's drinking too much, nor the after effects of such behavior.<br /><br />PHANTOM finds the brilliant, deeply troubled, now former police officer Harry Hole returning once again from Hong Kong, to which he'd fled once again at the end of THE LEOPARD.  He'd thought he was there for good this time.  But Oleg, the son of Rakel, the woman he'd loved and lost, is arrested for murder.  Harry had helped in Oleg's upbringing, but hadn't been of much use in HK.  So he zips back home.  The Oslo police won't reinstate him, but they agree to let him help them, though not on Oleg's case, which they believe solved.  So Harry sets out on his own, lonely quest to help the young man he thinks of as almost a son.<br /><br />The result is a multi-faceted, tightly plotted, complex mystery to which you'd better be paying close attention.  The pages turn compulsively: I think I read the last 200 at a sitting.  Nesbo is a very good writer, and gives us Oslo on the page, with a sharp close-up of its social life.  His narrative, descriptive writing and dialog are fine.  He ratchets up the tension, and keeps speeding the pace until he reaches his final, surprising, conclusions.  As in his previous books, in common with other Scandinavian authors, he doesn't shy away from gruesome material, so be warned.  Unfortunately, at least so far as I'm concerned, he's chosen to set this book among the drug addicts of Oslo, and, once again, as with alcoholics, I don't find their lives that interesting.<br /><br />Jo NesbØ is an Oslo-based musician, songwriter, economist, and author.  His first crime novel featuring Harry Hole was published in Norway in 1997 and was an instant hit, winning the Glass Key Award for best Nordic crime novel (an accolade shared with Peter Høeg, Henning Mankell and Stieg Larsson). He is the recipient of numerous further prizes and awards, including the Riverton Prize and the Booksellers Prize; one of his Harry Hole novels was voted best Norwegian crime novel of all time by Norwegian readers.  I've been reading Scandinavian mysteries for a long time, from the days of Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo, and consider Nesbo to be among the very best.  So, with the untimely death of the author of the worldwide publishing phenomena [[ASIN:0307594777 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]], and the retirement of Henning Mankell's brooding detective Kurt Wallander, Nesbo seems set to capture the title \\"King of the Scandinavian thriller.\\"reaches his final, surprising, conclusions.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this book. I don't consider it to be soft core porn like some. It's a love story with lots of hot detail. It reminds me of how my own husband and I feel about each other, and though we are not into the submission thing, the book reminds me of our sex life. How they feel about each other,the connection between them. One certain part in the book Where She has gone to \\"fifty's bar\\" it says She feels him before She sees him. James, my husband, and I have that connection. All in all I loved the book. I loved all three, and I hope if they make a movie they don't mess it up.
B0099G4Y26|2.0|I guess P!ink has moved from trying to be an edgier Britney to trying to out slut Madonna.

Too bad she hooked up with money-grubbing producers and ruined her credibility. What was that? She's been building up to this point? Good job, Carly. Mission accomplished.<br /><br />I guess I'm an old a-hole and not down with the new era.

Amy Adams did a wonderful job in this film, as did Frances McDormand. I especially liked the costumes and the music. The storyline was pretty funny, too.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is extremely addicting and very basic. I have seen many people rate it down, but seriously, why? Lag complainers probably have too many items lagging up their memory and boredom complainers probably aren't really gamers at all. The game is very Indiana Jones - ish and is enjoyable for everyone; even my niece who is 3 enjoys it.
0810993139|5.0|This book is hilarious... and this coming from someone in their early 30's.  Even though it's written simply, the writing is truly brilliant.  The main character is unpopular in school and is often made fun of and picked on. The author definitely makes greg a likeable make character BUT he keeps us from feeling too much pity for the character by also making him a little selfish and irresponsible.  The result is that instead of feeling really sorry for Greg we just find the things that he writes about funny instead.<br /><br />This may sound weird but I also use this a text book to learn languages.  This series is so popular that the books have been translated into lots of foreign languages... and let me tell you learning italian is so much more fun when I'm reading and studying the Italian version of this rather than going through a boring intermediate level text book.
0307155102|5.0|All of Richard Scary's books are fabulous and this is one of my two favorites!  I very much remember them from my own childhood.  I bought for my 3 and 6 year olds.  The 6 year old is getting a little old for it, but she loves to sit with her 3 year old sister and go through the book \\"teaching\\" her younger sister the words and letters.  I also love the size of the book - it is the perfect size for kids to open up on their laps and pour over each and every page.  Another positive is certainly the price and although I would have purchased at the marked price on the book's cover, I was happy to save a few bucks.

Having only listened to it once, and in the background, I can't say which songs specifically were my favorites, but several times I was distracted from what I was doing by a melody that I liked.
B0055B7IPE|1.0|This is a very sad movie - it's about finding your true love living happy and fulfilling life and then having it taken all away and in your deepest sorrow you chase after lost and futile dreams.  In a way it's typical Disney where ultimate sadness happens (Bambi, Lion King, etc) -- but unlike those single sad scenes the first half of this movie is super sad.  There are come cute/funny moments but overall it left me with a sadness which was the exact opposite of what I intended by watching a children's cartoon.
B007MS5B6Q|1.0|When AMC announced this sweet box set it was a no brainer (no pun intended) for me and i ordered it immediately. Today i got it and i must say i was in shock. Not because of the sheer horror the head was bringing up in me but because it looked like an ultra cheap fake copy of the head that is printed on the cardboard box (not to mention the promotional pictures of it). This is by far the biggest case of \\"mcdonalds effect\\" i saw in the last couple of years!!! SHAME ON AMC!!!<br /><br />p.s.: i rate only the boxset it self because the show cant be anybodies taste.
B0087HT36U|4.0|this game was a great twist from the angry birds concept.  Though it seems that at least one level is rigged so I can't get a golden crown.
B008MEM24S|5.0|The puzzles are great! Perfect for a 9 year old! I can not say how great out is to have this game as entertainment for long restaurant waits!
B008BM9L72|5.0|Have not finished reading yet, but am finding that this book has lived up to the hype surrounding it!!! It is not for the feint hearted though... If you shy away fron the sexual topic this book is probably not for you. But it is an easy read if that is what you are looking for. I am certainly looking forward to finishing the first and moving on to the second and third!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|does what it is supposed to do. its nice seeing how long certain things will hold out.  i love it. just wondering how much battery this program takes for itself though.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A matter of fact accounting of one involved in a role every U.S.Citizen can now share in. This will hopefully bring closure to some and a point of justice for others. This makes us proud of, and give thanks to our vallant military for their sacrifices.
B004UHL9EK|5.0|This is by far my favorite timer app so far. Very easy to set up, and it gives me multiple options to customize my timers. I love that I can use the stopwatch to find how long it takes any task at work , and then save it as a timer. The timers log is great to analyze how I balanced my workload and to make adjustments to the tasks length on my next day agenda. So it helps me to stay focused, and on track. I strongly recommend this app for persons wIth ADHD who are trying to improve their time management.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been reading fiction for 50+ years and love it when I can find an author that can keep my attention and give up the same old fables of power supremecy.<br />Wool has a content story that doesn't bounce all around and follows a story line in a logical order that entertains. Bravo! thank you.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|A mystery with a twist.<br /><br />The author explores an area not discussed too often the DNA transfer of a family line to the children.<br /><br />Story switches leading you into different directions and keeps you guessing while informing.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a great book that has started a cult following in the sci-fi community.  It spawned many sequels and companion series. It has now even found it's way into comic books. To show how relevant this book has remained, Orson Scott Card has even now started a prequel series to this book series this year starting in comics and working over into full-fledged novels. There are already enough reviews giving descriptions of this book, so I will conclude with: if you haven't read this book or any of it's offshoots, now is the time to get caught up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|one of the best apps. I love this calculator. very awesome.  2 thumbs up on this one. I certainly recommend this app.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Bang, bang...one for the good guys!<br />Simplistic jingoism. Heroics reduced to ninth grade level of macho menu of cliches.<br />We found OBL, we killed OBL,end of crudely crafted story.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Easy read. Couldn't put it down! It was well written and his descriptions kept me on the edge of my seat. These are truly amazing men and women.<br />THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY!
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|Simple and standard tilt game. However, it gets boring pretty quick. I'm not really into tilt games but this one held my attention even less than others I've played. Graphics are reasonable, but the gameplay isn't. I'd imagine young kids might enjoy this longer.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I've loved reading Lee Child novels in the past. The early ones were great but somewhere along the line a decline set in. This may be the worst novel so far. The first 10-15% gets your attention but it's all downhill from there. I won't repeat the earlier reviews but shallow characters, overly tedious descriptions of the flatlands of Nebraska, the setting of the ending, etc., etc., and a climax that ends with a whimper, not a bang. I had to force myself to complete the book. Would you like to buy a slightly used copy of an underwhelming novel? Skip this one.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|This is another typical rom-com that focuses on friends with benefits who try to have sex without emotion and along the way become friends and then fall in love. It's pretty typical but if you're looking for the same thing then this is pretty good.<br /><br />Building on that factor the best strenght here is the line deliveries and overall chemistry between the two lovers, played by Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Timberlake's dancing skills are properly used enough and Kunis plays on her bubbly personality to make it work well enough. Both are good at their humor deliveries as well and let me also add that the music track is very nice to suit the mood.<br /><br />For those who saw the Portman and Kusher film \\"No Strings Attached\\" I would say this one is a notch or two up.<br /><br />Supporting roles by Jenna Elfman (as Timberlake's sister), Woody Harrelson (as the gay sports editor) and Richard Jenkins( as the mentally deteriorating father). Emma Stone is Timberlake's ex-girlfriend.<br /><br />The budget was $35M and it made over $149M at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B to B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B plus (using the typical rom-com formula); CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus; HUMOR: B; ROMANCE FOCUSES: B plus to A minus (again, following the typical rom-com formula); WHEN WATCHED: mid September 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ive been waiting for the day when his game would come out on kindle. Eventhough it says that its version 0.4 it is the same as it is on ipod and ipad. It only requires 5.0 Mb and doesn't lag like other games. seriously 50 times better than I thought it wold be. GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|My friend 1st recommended this book when if was released, since she is not an avid reader like myself so I was unsure of her option about the book. So more recently my BFF started talking about it passionately. SO instead of waiting for me to pick it up she bought me book one for my birthday... I am so grateful she did. I read all 3 books in 4 days. Like a lot of the positive reviews Book 1 was very detailed and chapters upon chapters of sex... but it builds to who they are and where they are in they lives... I loved reading about the very tantalizing and sexy Christian Grey, and Ana with her inner goddess. Can't wait for more as I don't feel this is the last we will hear (see) of these characters. (I hope not anyway) Well worth the time to ready...
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Having read many books on this topic, as well as books about Seal Team Six, the SAS, Rangers, Delta Force etc., and having previously read a similar book about the actual attack on Bin Ladens compound, I found that this was just more of the same.  I enjoyed the book as it did cover some new material that I hadn't read before, and for those readers who haven't read any of the previous books on the subject, I think they will find it an eye-opener, and it takes a book like this to make someone realise just what these specialist operators have to go through and the politics and rubbish that they have to put up with from the career officers who are more political than operational.  It must be so very frustrating, and as one can see in the book, it takes a very special person to go down this track.  We owe them all a very high debt of gratitude for what they put themselves and their families through.  All in all, a great read, but there are better books out there on the subject.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Its very similar to playing Diablo or any other dungeon crawler.  In other words it has a lot of fun hack and slash, but not alot of plot.  Combat is amazingly balanced for a free game and the graphics are fairly good as wells.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Every American needs to read this true story of what really happened during the mission.<br />  The current administration has been trying to take credit for this mission.   It was the men doing the mission that risked their lives not Obama.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My sister was always like &quot;haha my opossum touch has jetpack joyride&quot; and now I can say &quot;I have it too!&quot; Ps its fun. like really fun.
B00943SQCI|3.0|Let me start out with the BAD:<br /><br />1.  Dark Shadows is just not meant to be a movie.  Even Dan Curtis' own attempts at Dark Shadows films, House of Dark Shadows and Night of Dark Shadows (both of which are nowhere near as good as Burton's film)are unmemorable, watered down versions of the television show.  Sure, the production values were much more substantial and the actors actually had the luxury of multiple takes, but the unexplainable magic of the television series was lost.  Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have made a valiant effort to capture the uncanny appeal of Dark Shadows, but I am sad to say that they failed.  But it's not their fault, and this particular failure is a truly beautiful failure with many moments of brilliance, such as Victoria's arrival in Collinwood as \\"Nights In White Satin\\" plays.  And Caroline's sexy dance to Donovan's \\"Season Of The Witch.\\"  Nearly all of Johnny Depp and Eva Green's on-screen moments.  But a two hour long film is simply far too compressed for the completely unique dimension that is Dark Shadows.  With an endless stream of characters, plot lines, and subtle moods, Dark Shadows needs to move at its own slow pace over a very long period of time.  All of the performances are great, but we never get to explore Victoria's past or see her intimately involved with Barnabas.  We do not get a chance to understand David's troubled mind.  We know absolutely nothing about Roger.  These characters offer substantial intrigue, but it is never explored and fleshed out.  The film, simply by virtue of being a film, is too compressed.<br /><br />2.  Then there is the ending.  There was a large explosion, fire, some ridiculous Matrix-style fighting that we see far too often these days, and the introduction of a werewolf that came out of absolutely nowhere!  Storytelling has never been Burton's forte, and endings are often very difficult, but it's really hard to make apologies for this film's final sequences.<br /><br />The real shame here is that this film is not a TV pilot, because it would make for one of the greatest TV pilots ever!  If Burton, Depp, and the others would have channeled their efforts into an ongoing TV series, the many brilliant aspects of the film could have the opportunity to flourish!<br /><br />OK, so now on to the GOOD:<br /><br />Based on the bad qualities I have highlighted, I probably give the impression that I hated the film.  But, I did not!  In fact, I really enjoyed it!  I haven't had as much fun in a movie theater in many years.  I doubt that the film will remain in theaters very long or make a huge impact on audiences, but the truth is that it's so much better than 99% of the other stuff out there.  In fact, it's a bit too good.  And that is why it will probably fade away.<br /><br />1.  While the horrible promotional trailers for the film showcased the \\"humorous\\" aspects of the film and lead audiences to believe that the film was essentially a camp-fest littered with corny jokes and obnoxiously bad editing, I am pleased to report that the opposite is true!  While there are certainly elements of black humor, they do not dominate the film, and they work much better in the context of the actual film than in the misleading trailers.  In fact, the black humor that made me cringe in the trailers was actually one of the best elements of the film.  As with most Burton films, the \\"humor\\" is done with a perfect balance of melancholy and deliciously strange perverseness that one can only describe as \\"Burtonesque.\\"<br /><br />2.  The romance is there.  The theme of \\"love beyond time\\" is central to the storyline, even if it could have been fleshed out even more.  Some have said that the romance between Barnabas and Victoria seems disingenuous, but in fairness, it is not a new love.  Victoria is the reincarnation of Barnabas' fiancee, Josette DuPres.  But I do think that there should have been more romantic outings between Barnabas and Victoria.<br /><br />3.  By Tim Burton standards, this was not a special effects-heavy movie.  The beautiful costumes and sets were just as important as the actors, and you could really feel the haunting spirit of the Collins mansion.<br /><br />4.  The sexual tension between Angelique and Barnabas is hot!  They nailed it.  Eva Green is the sexiest woman alive, and no one else could have played Angelique so perfectly.  I have always thought that Angelique was Barnabas' true love, but he was too proud of his status to accept a woman with such fiery sexuality and lowly status.  His torment really came from the fact that he could not admit that he actually loved her.  And the script got this essential point right.<br /><br />5.  Johnny Depp!  His performance was perfect.  He captured the essence of the character, and I am sure that the late Jonathan Frid would be proud.  Frankly, Depp's performance rivals the film as a whole.<br /><br />Final Thought:  While not a masterpiece, this is a very good film, and I have never seen anything like it.  The casting is perfect, even if the characters didn't get a fair chance to develop and shine.
B0047685I2|5.0|Always love this film and I needed to add it to my collection... it's the kind of classic you want, Drew B. and Dougray S. are perfect and you never get tired of watching this.... 5 stars and more if possible! ;)
1467934925|1.0|This book was obviously printed off of the internet then bound and sold. It has text that looks like it was originally a hyperlink throughout the book, and the formatting is all messed up. This is only really a problem where equations are written out as they don't line up and thus are unreadable.<br />The book is also quite big (length/with, not thickness) with a considerable margin around the text.<br /><br />I recommend paying a few extra bucks and getting an official copy of the book. I wish I had.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I remember Rodriguez in 1972 as a genius, yet nothing came of his music until now because of a movie. I think he is an incredibly humble man with lots of talent and something to say.
0553593544|2.0|I had to force myself to keep reading this book (although it gets a little less bad from around chapter 25), and am surprised that it's such a hit.<br /><br />Most of it is grating, unrealistic dialogue. Characterisation is poor (eg the heroine, despite knowing nothing about the hero, becomes his lover and best friend following a brutal rape). The writing style lacks interesting turns of phrase or ideas (the most vivid description was of smoke \\"spiralling\\", and this was repeated several times).
B0061P2L5U|5.0|Since I was diagnosed with allergies at age 21, I have wanted to know what causes them.  This book has answered all of my questions and more.  It is interesting, well written, and has important health information that I hope to apply to my benefit.  I highly recommend it!
B000085RPU|1.0|I can't believe Amazon actually shipped this product to someone living of MAssachusetts seeing it was for Region 2 which I had no idea what that was.  We found out when we tried to play it and it wouldn't play.  It cost $12+ and by the time all the charges were taken off we only got a $3+ credit when we returned it.
B003V63VNI|5.0|i've been an incubus fan ever since i was in middle school and brandon boyd is one amazing and talented guy. listened to the songs of this brilliant masterpiece from senor boyd and it just blew me away, i mean that in a good way, of course.

B007FG9LIE|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. it was creepy how the story kept twisting and turning. I highly recommend this book, and looking forward to reading more from this author.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was great. My son loved it. He finished it in about 3 days and said it was amazing.
B00511ONPG|5.0|First and foremost, I love the language. People may hardly expect a business guidebook to have excellent language, but for me, it made an totally different reading experience. Moreover, the authenticity I felt throughout the book is just like the message it tries to convey; when the company or organization behind the Facebook page really care about its customers and provide values through social media, they can connect with customers in a new level.  This's the first book I read on social media marketing; it's kind of a paradigm shift of my understanding on marketing. I would recommend it to everyone, regardless their professions.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I knew that I liked Enya and the way they sounded just from the few songs I had heard on the radio.  So I ordered this CD - The Very Best of Enya, figuring that was a good way to really get to know her music and I wasn't disappointed.  Her voice is very soothing, the harmonies are beautiful and the variety of background instruments all come together to make a great listening experience.  Enya's style is very specific though and some have complained that her songs all sound the same.  But I have not found that to be true.  If you like that smooth, Irish lilting type of music, give Enya and this CD a try. It's joined my collection as one of my favorites.
B00932A6G4|4.0|Better than ST2 and ST3 hands down. Amazing detail on the cgi and the story line was well done. Interesting to see them bring back Carmen, Jenkins and Rico
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Great book. Kept me engrossed from start to finish. I am looking forward to reading the next one and can't wait to see what happens to the different characters.

1451626657|5.0|Without this book there would have been no \\"MASH\\" the television series, no \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or the general refusal to view war as some great historic accomplishment of mankind. Heller's masterpiece transports us to the absurdity of war, a human construct that devours the individual in the face of bureaucratic systems designed to enable the destruction of the individual through depersonalization. The inherent chaotic state of war is captured through the plot structure embedded by the author, a technique that many readers will find difficult or impossible to deal with but unlike the characters the reader can choose to escape from.<br /><br />An important subplot of the novel often not dwelt upon is the nature of capitalism, international trade, and spot markets. Milo's Syndicate provides the basis for analyzing the sociopathic behaviors that can arise from the pursuit of the profit motive without reflection on the condition of Man, a subject first considered by Adam Smith in \\"The Wealth of Nations\\" and his \\"Theory of Moral Sentiments\\".<br /><br />Acclaimed as a great American novel, the book deserves this recognition on many levels. First, it is an American novel through and through both in its perspective and its style of the individual over the group, the quest for independence and freedom, and the disrespect for rank and privilege. It is also a beautifully written book both in its prose and its psychological connections. It is also a story of common men thrown into alien conditions that they were not raised or trained for but who find an inner strength to carry on and who find humor in the face of damnation.<br /><br />You will want to run away from this book but it is important that you persevere to the end just like the characters who survive...
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Yes Ryan is fine and very easy to watch and listen to BUT he actually is more than eye candy. He is an excellent actor. I feel there is a reason he is popping up all over the place and in a lot of films. He is a very excellent actor and pulls you into his character and really plays the part well in any role he plays. This movie is great as far as a movie plot and start to finish complete without major flaws like some movies. The only thing I would note is that it's a bit much on the gore and doesn't end with a typical scene people would prefer. But overall enjoyed and would recommend. I liked the other movie he was in better called Half Nelson, not nearly as popular but AMAZING
0143115014|5.0|I fell in love with Luca Turin after reading [[ASIN:0375759816 The Emperor of Scent: A True Story of Perfume and Obsession]] (fantastic book! go read that one too!), and that book alone sparked my interest in perfumes. My expectations were high with this book, and I was not disappointed. It is exceedingly amusing, and both Turin and Sanchez have a real gift for verbalizing a process that is to most people ethereal - experiencing a scent. Of course, not everyone will agree with all of their assessments (after all, perfumes completely change their scents when worn by different people), but this book is a joy to read.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|because then I could read it all over again for the first time.<br /><br />I would go somewhere no one would find me and read it straight through from start to finish. I would met the characters for the first time again, be amazed at how they become so real they just about climb out of the book and into the room with you. I would slow down and enjoy each word, each hilarious, touching, smart turn of dialogue, each perfectly-wrought description. I would laugh and cry out loud (again) and remember that THIS -- being pulled in and under by a completely unforgettable story -- is why I love books.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|very easy to read and comes across as a truly honest story. i dont see why all the controversy and diatribe toward this veteran for offering us this historic memoir. he felt he needed to relate it to possibly inspire a youth to be of service to our nation. kudos to \\"Mark Owen<br />!\\"
B0085HWZDK|5.0|This is my current favorite concert video.  The band is great and playing together very well.  The video on Blu-Ray, is exceptional.  A great blend of Band of Joy songs and Led Zep stuff.  You can't go wrong with this if you like Robert Plant.<br /><br />Mark T

B0090EHVMC|5.0|This movie is very amusing. The cartoon characters is very well done. The characters<br />are color sensitve to the plot of the story. All in all is is very well put together with a stronge message
B007VUA7VO|5.0|When I first purchased this app,  I thought it would just be something helpful to have.  Not only is it helpful but you can customize the look of it.  I changed my battery to be pink colored (not much of a surprise to anyone who knows me) .  I really like the fact that it will tell me bow many hours and minutes I have for specific functions on my Kindle Fire.  I would definitely purchase this app for other devices I might have in the future.

0515149489|3.0|My Rating: 3 out of 5 stars<br />Genre: Standalone Romantic Suspense novel (not very suspenseful though)<br />My usual type of read? (yes/no) Could've been!<br />Plot type: Could've been a taught crime thriller but instead was a long, drawn out and at times boring police investigation into something we never even got to see until the end of the book. ZERO investment into hating the Villian(s) and less than ZERO believeability in the Heroine's ability to save herself. The Hero had no interest in saving her either.<br />Recommended for: Hard core Nora Roberts fans who have an interest in dogs/dog-training<br />Read from August 27 to September 18, 2012<br /><br />#<br /><br />First let me say I'm a pretty big Nora fan and I absolutely love dogs, especially working dogs so I find dog-training to be an interesting topic about which to read, even when it interrupts my romance novel to blast me with the info dumping thereof. What I did not enjoy was the verbosity and repetitiveness of this novel. Others have said the same thing, Nora could have trimmed 100 pages here and 50 pages there and ended up with a MUCH better book.<br /><br />Instead, we got a great story concept, with a fabulous Hero and Heroine that had an amazingly entertaining dynamic between them -- and then the whole thing droned on for so long, it just fell flat. The pacing was sluggish, like dragging myself through mud just to get through each page. Every last good thing about the book was lost in the forest for the sake of the trees (no pun intended but even my snark is more witty than Nora was in this book - what the heck happened to her great wit?)<br /><br />To say the least, I was really disappointed.<br /><br />I think this is the first and only time I have actually had to struggle to finish a Nora Roberts book. Usually, I just fly through her work in a day, certainly in no more than 2 or 3 sittings (usually one or two) but this book...dragged, meandered, droned, repeated, mulled, mulched, chewed and then regurgitated some more. It really did not live up to \\"Nora Roberts\\" standards. It's like a first draft she declined to edit.<br /><br />I borrowed this book from the library and at the same time, got a copy of [[ASIN:0515150630 Chasing Fire]], figuring I'd have them both done in the same first lending period from my library. Not. As it turned out, I had to renew (which I rarely have to do and hate doing) and now have only 4 days left to read the second book (after renewing it) because I spent a month dragging through the first book. These are not a series of books or AFAIK connected in any way, but they seemed to be themed and published around the same time so I figured I'd check them both out. I really hope the firefighters in Chasing Fire can save the day--I'd hate to have to renew the book for a THIRD time just to manage to read it! Nora books are usually done in 1-2 days, not weeks or months. Yikes, Nora, what happened?then regurgitated some more. It really did not live up to \\"Nora Roberts\\" standards.

B009AJD5E0|1.0|Prometheus is the exact definition of unoriginal. The plot is an obvious duplicate of the Alien movie from back in the 80's. The writer for this movie was well and extremely overly paid, to the point it causes me to ponder wether or not hollywood producer's want to continue to hand out charity, because if so, I have a great movie idea. It's called Predator.  It obviously has a few minor differences but it is a complete waste of time watching this rip off of a movie.  I would prefer a refund.

0525423656|3.0|Crossed starts with Ky, who has been transported to the Outer Provinces where he and other Aberration boys basically serve Society as living bait. Every night the \\"Enemy\\" fires upon them, and few survive to see the next day. Meanwhile, Cassie makes her way out of a work camp, to the outer edges of Society, driven to find her beloved Ky. The story continually switches narrators back and forth between Ky and Cassie. As the two search for each other, and a way to finally be together, we learn about the farmers, who live outside Society, and the Rising, a growing rebellion that Ky does not want to be a part of. Near the end, Cassie faces a difficult decision- should she stay in the outskirts and live happily ever after with Ky? Or should she join the movement working towards destruction of the Society, even if it means being separated from him?<br /><br />While there are some new interesting characters in this second installment, and a few surprising revelations, I did not enjoy this book as much as the first one in the series. The constant back and forth between narrators was confusing for me since both Cassie and Ky are written with a very similar voice. In addition, there are frequent flashbacks with no warning or indication, which was hard to follow. I like the use of poetry and artwork to symbolize creation and creativity, a trait that has been virtually eliminated in Society. The pacing of the book was a little off in my opinion. Sometimes the author seemed to dwell on scenes that didn't warrant so many pages and chapters. Other times, especially near the end, the plot seemed to jump forward without enough gradual development. I don't want to spoil the ending, but I'll just say I was very surprised with both Cassie's and Ky's calm reactions to what I would have thought to be a very emotional event. While I'll still read the third book just out of sheer curiosity to see how it all ends, I found Crossed to be a little too awkwardly paced to fully enjoy.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series.  I didn't know much about it until the movie came out, and was less than thrilled with the theme-kids fighting kids for food.  It took a while for me to decide to read the first book and I knew I would want to see the whole series through.<br />I was pleasantly surprised with the story.  Yes, there was violence depicted, but it was not overly graphic and was in the context of how the characters were trying to put an end to the games.  I liked that Katniss immediately sacrificed herself to keep her sister from the Games and certain death, and that she showed genuine compassion even towards her adversaries throughout the series.  I liked the steady strength of Peeta, and in an odd twist, the reappearance of Buttercup, the cat, a familiar face in all of the wreckage.<br />The series wrapped up very well with Katniss and Peeta together, still struggling with their memories, but trying to move on, having a family, and realizing that one day they would have to explain to their children how they were hunted and tortured, and how they fought back, to make a better life for future generations.

B008MG1E4A|3.0|As a Navy veteran I was waiting in proud anticipation to read what sounded to be one of the first hand accounts of a Seal Team action.  Before I got the book, I watched the 60 Minutes interview of the author.  After I got the book and started reading it, I realized he basically gave away the whole story in the interview.  As a result, book was more or less of a let down for me.  My recommendation is that if you watched that interview, don't bother with the book.
0307592731|4.0|I read this for my book club, and was delighted.

B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I watched both version of this movie/book and Swedish version was good but David Fincher's adaptation was awesome. I absolutely loved it. Daniel Craig  as Mikael Blomkvist was good and exactly as I envisioned him while reading a book. Rooney Mara as Lisbeth Salander was awesome, in my opinion better than Noomi Rapace. She looked and acted as Salander. She was  vulnerable yet tough. There was a great chemistry between the lead actors. I really hope that Sony will make a sequel to Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and keep Fincher as a director. Great Movie!

B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and a great story.  The story is told in flashbacks and bits and pieces. Oskar Schell (Thomas Horn) is a kid with a hyperactive mind who idolizes his father (Tom Hanks), yet seems to distance himself from his mother (Sandra Bullock). After his father dies on the 9/11 attack - a day which Oskar refers to as \\"the worst day\\" - Oskar begins a manic spiralling search for meaning. He becomes obsessed with the phone messages left on the answering machine by his father on the day he died. He begins to self-mutilate by pinching himself until it bruises. During his search for answers... trying to find meaning in his father's loss and trying to hold onto his memory, he finds a key in an envelope with the name \\"Black\\" on it.  So, he sets out on a trek to talk to every person in NY with the name Black to ask about the key and find out if there is a connection to his father. He befriends his grandmother's tenant, an old man who never speaks, only known as \\"the renter\\" (Max Von Sydow), and has him join in his quest. In the course of his search, Oskar meets many interesting characters - the various people named Black. He also becomes convinced that \\"the renter\\" (Sydow) is his grandfather. He also reconnects with his mother when he finds out she has been trailing his trek the whole time.<br /><br />There's no need to explain the story further... it is too complex and involved to sum up. And I won't give away the meaning of the key... you'll have to watch to find out. The story is a bit hard to take in at first, because of the flashbacks and segmented pieces. But, it is a story worth getting into.<br /><br />As for the performances; Thomas Horn as Oskar carries the movie... with a standout performance, Tom Hanks gives a fine performance as the father, Sandra Bullock is very passionate in her portrayal of the mother, Max Von Sydow is outstanding in his role... despite never speaking a word, and Viola Davis gives a wonderful portrayal as Abby Black. The only poor performance in this movie is from John Goodman in a bit part as Stan the Doorman... it seems that his lackluster character portrayal is unnecessary for both the story and the movie.<br /><br />This movie is full of meaning, passion, and deep seeded emotion... A must to see and own.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This movie was very cute.  I thought maybe it would be too \\"kiddish\\" but it kept my attention while flying to Chicago.  My grandkids had seen it and recommended it very highly and they were right!
B003C1SPX8|4.0|Finally got this DVD album after almost 3 weeks of waiting since the product was shipped from Argentina! But, it is a new product as advertised and plays well on my DVD player at home.  Great Dire Straits performance despite conversion from analog recording. Unfortunately, there is a flaw which appears to be a strand of thread or hair toward the end of the recording which does not affect the players or sound performance in any way. There are also bonus tracks on 2 songs and about the creation of the group which add value to this compilation. Love the music and performance from beginning to end and highly recommend this DVD if you love Dire Straits music.

0553801473|1.0|After reading the first 4 books of this series back to back, I am currently about 1/3 of the way into the 5th. I give up. It is not often that I do not finish a book, so I do not take this lightly. But as other reviewers have said, this book and series is going nowhere. It's a shame. I very much enjoyed the 1st book and even the second. But after that it has all been down hill and a waste of time. I give up reading chapters about characters, wanting to know what happens next to them and then finding out the storyline doesn't even appear again in the book or the next one for that matter. This was a series that started out so strong and has lost so many of it's readers.  Sorry, George R.R. Martin, but we are just not interested anymore.
1401937268|5.0|I love these tarot cards.<br />-The art work is beautiful.<br />-Each card includes key phrase meanings.<br />-The majors are royal purple with an angel representing each one.<br />-The earth suit, with green borders, are fairies and elementals.<br />-The fire suit carry a dragon theme with dark red borders.<br />-The water suit, of course, is set under the sea, with mermaids and aqua borders.<br />-The air suit is indigo borders and unicorn themes.<br />Brilliant! The deck is full of positive, intuitive messages straight from the angelic realm. The included guidebook is detailed and informative.

B008D1LVRY|5.0|Quite simply there best work to date! Im a big fan of Mudvayne and of course Pantera and to see Vinne back out there with a kick ass band is great.

B00932H1HG|4.0|It can be a chaotic album, yes, but that's part of the fun and challenge of it--deciphering these pieces. It'll take repeated listens to get a grasp on this thing, since AC put a lot of time and attention into building all these sounds. In that sense, it reminds me of Olivia Tremor Control's albums where everything and the kitchen sink were put into the songs. It doesn't always make for easy listening, but you know you're getting something that won't sound like any other band, and this is a huge value in itself if you've gotten bored with indie's trends. What's important is that the melodies are still there--you'll be humming along to Moonjock and Applesauce for days. Avey Tare's dominance on this album--whereas Merriweather had more Panda Bear influence--will be divisive, but for long time fans, hearing Avey's screams again is very welcome.

B0057UA4CW|5.0|How did they -- um, that is, how did Stanley Kubrick -- make a movie out of \\"Lolita\\"? By playing down the explicit sexual content, which the censors of 1962 apparently could not tolerate, and playing up the tragicomedy.<br /><br />You have to admit: There is something both tragic and funny about Humbert Humbert, including the man's having the same first and last name. Yes, I get the doppelganger reference, but really, how do you take such a person seriously, even if he is a professor. I confess I've always had the same trouble with Ford Madox Ford.<br /><br />Yes, and there's something truly pathetic and very strange about a man of Humbert's age becoming obsessed with a nymphet, even one as precociously flirtatious and brattily manipulative as Lolita.<br /><br />Kubrick didn't have much coice about changing the film for the screen; in fact, he said later that if he knew how difficult it would be, given the salacious subject matter, he might not have attempted it.<br /><br />I'm glad he did, because I think it is one of his most rewarding films. Granted, I didn't like it much at first -- but then again, most Kubrick films benefit from multiple viewings, including this one, \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" \\"Barry Lyndon\\" and \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\"<br /><br />Another great thing about this film: The cast. The four principles are, without exception, stunning in their roles. James Mason as Humbert is perfect -- pretentious, hopelessly in love, calculating. Sue Lyon as Lolita brings just the right amount of innocence and sensuality to the role. Shelly Winters is outstanding as Charlotte Haze, Lolita's mother, and Peter Sellers just dazzles as Clare Quilty, who ultimately serves as Humbert's nemesis.<br /><br />One more point: Despite the film's having to engage in a certain amount of vagueness because of the prudishness of the times, did ANYONE ever miss what was really going on between these two? Mason's performance alone tells the tale for me. He is lecherous, unremorseful in his lechery, thoroughly smitten.<br /><br />\\"Lolita\\" is a great American film. Again, not my favorite Kubrick movie, but one which stands the test of time, fifty years now since its release.chery, thoroughly smitten.<br /><br />\\"Lolita\\" is a great American film.

B005LAII62|3.0|\\"Paranorman\\" offers a fair evening's amusement, but not a lot more. It's easy to empathize with him: a nice enough kid but with a difference that sets him apart, has to deal with knuckle-dragging bullies, has lots of bad hair days.<br /><br />Then, the uncle that no one talks about finds him. It turns out that Norman's \\"I see dead people\\" knack runs in the family, and has imposed a unique duty on the people that share his talent. The undle dies before passing the whole secret along, though, in a hilarious scene in the school boys' room. Norman misses his cue n carrying out the task, and ancient evil arises from the grave.<br /><br />It turns out to be more angry (with reason) and misunderstood than really evil, though. As you might expect, he gets it all sorted out in the end and becomes cooler than the cool kids ever were.<br /><br />The animation gets high marks, and the characters (especially his sister) are cleverly drawn. There's not a lot under the surface, but only the grown-ups watching will care, and the moview really wasn't for them - for us.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B001DJLCPE|5.0|If we omit \\"Fear and Desire,\\" an early film that Stanley Kubrick removed from circulation, and his short films and documentaries, the director made only 12 movies in his career. But what a dozen they are! Kubrick was not the most prolific of directors, but to me, he was the greatest.<br /><br />Although I love all his films, there are several that stand out: \\"Paths of Glory,\\" \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Barry Lyndon\\" -- and \\"Dr. Strangelove.\\" Given those five films, an affectionate companion and a desert island, I could be reasonably content until the end of time.<br /><br />\\"Dr. Strangelove\\" is essential Kubrick because it is nearly perfect in its conception and its execution. Think of it -- a comedy about nuclear holocaust in 1964? Kubrick was far ahead of his time. This isn't the only oh-no-we're-nuked movie that has stood up well; others include \\"On the Beach,\\" \\"Testament\\" and even the TV movie, \\"The Day After.\\" But it's the only one that dares play it for laughs.<br /><br />Despite the comedy, however, as you watch it, the sense of menace becomes real enough. Kubrick's re-creation of the War Room is a dark, cavernous place where even the most outrageous ideas and statements are not only tolerated but, for the most part, condoned. It was always our hope, as citizens living in the nuclear age, that our leaders would be people of reason, intelligence, restraint. Here, though, Kubrick depicts a roomful of madmen. The only thing in question: Who's craziest?<br /><br />The cast is outstanding: Peter Sellers in three different roles including the titular one, Slim Pickens, a young James Earl Jones, George C. Scott, and Sterling Hayden as Gen. Jack D. Ripper, whose preoccupation with Americans' \\"precious bodily fluids\\" leads the United States and Soviet Union to the brink of World War III.<br /><br />My first viewing of this film was this: I was a kid, not yet 10 years old. I saw just a fragment of it, including the end. Maybe 10 minutes, tops. I asked my dad to explain it to me. He just started laughing ... and then did his best. Even that brief exposure to it left me disturbed for a couple days.<br /><br />Watch this film if you haven't. Watch it again if you have. I've lost TRACK of the number of times I've watched it ... and will watch it again, I'm sure, soon.ked my dad to explain it to me. He just started laughing ... and then did his best.

B005LAII6M|4.0|This movie is fifth in the franchise, which was based on a video game to start with. I think it's a sign that the series is aging when a cute little girl gets thrown in. (Same thing in one of the later Alien movies, can't remember which.) She is cute, though, gets everyone's prtoective instincts up, and doesn't get in the way of the shoot-em-up.<br /><br />Jovovich does a great job, as always. She also manages to top that white strappy outfit she wore in Fifth Element - I'll let it be a surprise, but it certainly offers plenty to anyone fascinated by the female form, and Milla's in particular. The real suspense comes in anticipating a wardrobe malfunction that never occurs.<br /><br />It's not highbrow stuff, but a good one of its sort. Popcorn-worthy, but forgettable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Little kids seem to like hearing the same stories, over and over, until the adult reading the stories is bored numb. Adults aren't all that different, though. A good story, like Snow White, gets told again and again. When the story is so familiar, the unique character of each retelling really comes through. In this case, the best features are the effects and Charlize Theron's wicked stepmother.<br /><br />The effects are everything you could hope, given current movie-making technology, and really have to be seen. Theron does an outstanding job as the evil queen, though - she convincingly projects psychpathic malice, despite her physical beauty and with no redeeming hint of human warmth. Perhaps it's no surprise that [[ASIN:B005LAIHY0 Prometheus]] was in theaters about the same time as Snow White, and Theron played a similar character: never a hair out of place, but inhuman in dedication to her goals. Really, she made the movie. Except for the fact that Snow White got promoted from wimpy maiden in need of saving, the other roles didn't rise to that level.<br /><br />Fun popcorn flick, beautifully put together, but (excpet for Theron), forgettable.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

Track 10 is somewhat hopeful despite the ending, a true end of the innocence of an era the like's will not ever happen again and for those lucky enough to have been there and remember, good for you, and for us It's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". . .<br /><br />Jim Lutz<br />Sea Cliff, NY - USA

B001CP4VMU|5.0|Director Tim Burton turns in a hit for the second year in a row (following 1988's Beetlejuice)and gets everything right, from the casting to the writing to the dark direction this film takes from the very start. There is no campiness of the 1960's TV series to be found here, it's action packed and stays truer to the original comic books, and that is a good thing.<br /><br />The movie stars Michael Keaton, who makes an excellent Batman despite his rise to fame as a comedic actor and Jack Nicholson who holds nothing back in his fantastic performance as the Joker. Even the minor characters are very well cast and have done a terriffic job of bringing these characters to life.The sets are amazing as well.<br /><br />Furthmore, the tranfer on this Blu ray is nothing short of excellent, the picture quality is very crisp and clear and the audio is equally as impressive. This release also has an amazing array of extras, one being a three part presentation on the making of the movie starting from the very beginning of development all the way through to the Hollywood premiere. There is also a feature on the characters including Batman, Joker, Vicki Vale, etc which contains interviews with the actors who played them, plus many more extras. A top notch movie for sure, if you haven't seen it, you need to. You will NOT be disappointed.

B007UXSPK2|5.0|Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is a good movie to watch on a relaxing Friday night. It does not have too much action that it becomes overwhelming. Humor also breaks the tension of most serious scenes.

I would watch it again.

The third man is the author himself, whose own faith and spiritual growth are fostered by the two men he comes to love and admire.

B001FEA9QU|3.0|While Metallica's eighth studio album, St. Anger, sold several million copies, the public, and to a lesser extent, critical reception was absolutely disastrous.  Whether this prompted the band to \\"give the fans what they want\\", or they've simply run out of new ideas, the idea of a \\"return to roots\\" album was pitched.  Metallica has always been opportunistic, so it was no coincidence that at the time there was something of a renewed interest in thrash metal, with new bands like Municipal Waste and Evile basing their sound around it, and older bands like Death Angel and Megadeth returning to the genre.  As to whether this is a successful throwback album?  Well, that depends a lot on what you think of Metallica's back catalogue.<br /><br />  Death Magnetic follows the \\"classic\\" Metallica layout, with up-tempo tracks bookending the album, a semi-ballad early on with a heavy second half, and an instrumental track near the end.  While the idea of an \\"epic\\" title track has been dropped, the opener \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" more than makes up for it.  Within half a minute, the band drops an unbelievably catchy main riff and plugs away at a clip we haven't seen from them in 20 years.  Metallica seems bent on dispensing any doubt that they can play this kind of music anymore.<br /><br /> And yet, this isn't quite all the way back to ...And Justice for All.  There's an unmistakable groove influence throughout the album.  Metallica doesn't seem comfortable stepping away from the catchy simplicity of the Load-era albums, and it shows.  That's not to say that this is simplistic stuff, but it doesn't reach the complexity of even early material like Ride the Lightning.  And I hate to say it, but Kirk Hammett seems to have lost his touch in the past decade or so.  There are next to no worthwhile solos on this album.  Many aren't even interesting enough to register, and even the best tend to be simply \\"okay\\".  On any earlier album, the solos would have been an exciting climax; here, it's simply waiting until the chorus is reprised.<br /><br /> Despite the style not being entirely what thrash fans want to hear, the album is likely to tide the less picky over.  \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", \\"All Nightmare Long\\", and \\"The Judas Kiss\\" all carry the heaviest thrash influence.  \\"The End of the Line\\", \\"Cyanide\\", and \\"Broken, Beaten, and Scarred\\" all pull from a variety of influences, with the relentless pounding style of a few of The Black Album's tracks combined with a less insane St. Anger feel.  A personal favorite of mine is the second rehash of \\"The Unforgiven\\".  Unlike \\"The Unforgiven II\\" off of ReLoad, this one keeps the original's structure of heavy verses and a light chorus, which is a definite improvement.  There's a noticeable violin providing backing during the chorus, but overall, there is a much greater \\"metal\\" feel than the original, and the lyrics are actually the strongest of the three songs, in my opinion.  It's not as good as the first, but it's a surprisingly close second.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, the album closes out with a disappointingly weak duo of songs.  \\"Suicide and Redemption\\", the album's instrumental, and Metallica's longest song on a studio album to date, simply meanders far too much and never really builds to a satisfying conclusion.  And \\"My Apocalypse\\" is simply too weak to be the album closer in the vein of \\"Damage, Inc.\\" or \\"Dyer's Eve\\" that Metallica wants it to be.<br /><br /> The elephant in the room, though, is Death Magnetic's absolutely abominable mastering job.  The album has been brickwalled to hell and back.  I don't usually mind poor production, but this seriously sounds like its being played from the bottom of a swimming pool based on how flat the sound is.  Taking St. Anger's already poor production into account, and looking at how it has progressed on Death Magnetic, I'm guessing Metallica's next album is simply going to be static with Hetfield gargling \\"I'm madly in anger with you!\\" on a loop for 70-some minutes.<br /><br /> As far as thrash comebacks go, this is probably the weakest I've seen, but it's not an awful album.  Incidentally, this may be the first time Megadeth has \\"beaten\\" Metallica.  Endgame was a far better album released not too long after Death Magnetic.  After 30 years, Dave Mustaine can finally pat himself on the back for besting his old rivals.e minutes.<br /><br /> As far as thrash comebacks go, this is probably the weakest I've seen, but it's not an awful album.

B000002HRE|3.0|There isn't much that can be said about ReLoad that hasn't already been said about its immediate predecessor, Load.  In what might be Metallica's biggest misfire, Load saw the band embracing generic radio-rock with a vengeance, a sin almost as unforgiveable as cutting their hair down to something the `90's deemed acceptable.  ReLoad did nothing to change any of that, other than to be a bit more reliable while doing it.  While the album offers nothing more substantial, it's far less boring than the prior album.<br /><br /> The opener, \\"Fuel\\" starts the album off with a bang, and I can honestly say it's one of my favorite Metallica songs.  It's still nothing like the band's classic material, but it's fast, catchy, and infectious.  The next few songs keep the momentum up, and you almost get the feeling that this could be a great record.  \\"The Memory Remains\\" is a grooving, smooth rocker, and would be another favorite of mine had it not been for Marianne Faithful's bizarre backing vocals.  \\"Devil's Dance\\" is similar to a blues-infused version of \\"Sad But True\\" off of The Black Album, and Hetfield's snide vocals add a lot to the lyrics, about Satan tempting a man.  Then \\"The Unforgiven II\\" begins, and things start to slide a bit.<br /><br /> I love \\"The Unforgiven\\" off of The Black Album.  But this new version, while mostly true to the original, just showed Metallica not living up to their earlier material.  While the chord progressions from the original are still present and as strong as ever, the layout of the song has reverted to something more standard: light verses and a heavy chorus, rather than the opposite on the original.  Couple that with Hetfield's southern rock-influenced vocals, and a lot of what was great about the Black Album version is gone.  I don't hate \\"The Unforgiven II\\", but all it really does is make me want to listen to the first again.<br /><br /> That feeling pervades the next several songs.  \\"Better Than You\\", \\"Slither\\", and \\"Bad Seed\\" aren't completely awful songs, but none of them show any spark of creativity.  They're listenable, but definitely skippable.  Metallica do throw a few curveballs later on.  \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" is certainly different, but doesn't grab me, although I seem to be in the minority.  \\"Low Man's Lyric\\", though, is one of my favorites, and comes completely out of left field: an Irish-influenced ballad with bagpipes backing the guitars on the chorus.  Bizarre, but I like it.  There are a couple worthwhile grunge-heavy songs in the mix, too: \\"Carpe Diem, Baby\\" and \\"Prince Charming\\" certainly won't be considered classics, but they're alright.<br /><br /> ReLoad ends much like Load does, unfortunately: with a mediocre song stretched far past the point where it's worth listening to.  \\"Fixxxer\\" is dreary and tedious; it boggles the mind that Metallica thought anyone would want to listen to eight and a half minutes of it.<br /><br /> ReLoad ends up basically being Load with a good coat of spit and polish on it.  It's still about as far from Metallica's old style as possible, but at least it's significantly more listenable.  Unlike Load, this is one I feel I can recommend if you care for this style of music.mpletely awful songs, but none of them show any spark of creativity.

B006T5FDLG|2.0|There's not too much to say about the Beyond Magnetic EP, except that these are Death Magnetic rejects.  That doesn't necessarily make the quartet of songs automatically bad, but going in expecting something great is going to leave you disappointed.<br /><br /> The good news is that while these are rough mixes of the songs, the mastering is much better than off of Death Magnetic.  It's still nothing to write home about, but the dynamics are slightly better.<br /><br /> The first song, \\"Hate Train\\", gets off to a decent driving start, and has a similar song structure to what was found on St. Anger.  It bears repeating that the first line Hetfield delivers is \\"Hate/... is a train\\".  Needless to say, don't expect much from the lyrics here; the instrumental portions are significantly better, but not fantastic either.  \\"Just a Bullet Away\\" is an unenthusiastic, exceedingly simple thrash song.  It does feel more like early Metallica than a lot of songs they've done recently, but it's far too simplistic to really fit in with them.  \\"Hell and Back\\" is the best song here, and would fit right in with the other groove-oriented songs on Death Magnetic.  I can see it being a good replacement for \\"The Day That Never Comes\\".  \\"Rebel of Babylon\\" is an admittedly ambitious attempt at an epic, but it simply doesn't reach the heights of any similar songs they've done in the past.<br /><br /> I get the impression after listening to this that it's rather pointless for Metallica to be attempting to create songs that resemble their pre-Justice days.  The style they use is much more suited for another album styled like their self-titled, but the thrash they put out is simply too weak.<br /><br /> At nearly 30 minutes, the EP is probably worth getting at the price it is if you enjoyed Death Magnetic at all.  If you only thought Death Magnetic was passable, you'd probably be better off spending that couple dollars elsewhere.
B009329ZF2|4.0|The characters are cookie cutter, the plot is well worn and the special effects are pedestrian. But \\"Battleship\\" is nevertheless quite entertaining. Just put your mind on hold and enjoy the ride. Well worth having in your library. I've already watched it several times, much like watching a fireworks show. They're all the same but that doesn't deminish the thrill.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br /><br />If, however, you're looking for something to engage the mind, forget it. A glaring example: the entire plot centers on aliens, having arrived on Earth but having lost their long distance communications ship (so they can signal back to their home planet to send the entire invasion force), gets wrecked before landing. Instead they take over a ground station for the orbiting satellite that sent an initial message from Earth out into deep space that first attracted the alien's attention. They plan to call home using it to start the full invasion. Yet not once in the entire film does anyone say \\"look, if they need that satellite of ours to get the signal home, why don't we just retask it to a different orbit where it won't connect to the ground station and they won't be able to send their message? Or why not just shoot it down? Either way, problem solved.\\" When they miss a solution that simple, you just know it's time to put your brain on hold and just enjoy the fireworks.
B000002H97|4.0|To a new listener, Metallica's self-titled (colloquially referred to as The Black Album) is simply a solid-to-excellent hard rock album, and nothing more.  To the longtime fan listening in 1991, it was a shock to the system.  In three short years, the band took their entire back catalogue and buried it in the backyard, and crafted something different.  Yes, it's still \\"metal\\", to a degree, but listen to this back-to-back with ...And Justice for All, and you might not realize the same band plays on both.  Gone are nearly all vestiges of \\"thrash\\", the complexity and aggression replaced with more easily digestible, mid-tempo tunes.  There's little point in discussing what party is responsible for this change in style - whether Hetfield, Ulrich, or the band's new producer, Bob Rock - but it bears repeating that The Black Album lost Metallica a lot of fans, even as it gained millions more.<br /><br /> The term \\"sell-out\\" is thrown around a lot when The Black Album is brought up, and to an extent, Metallica really did sell out with this one.  They discarded the denseness and impenetrability of ...And Justice for All, and created something with much more mainstream appeal, slower tempos, and easily-followed rhythms.  If their intent was to make themselves millionaires, they certainly succeeded.  However, the term \\"sell-out\\" also implies a lack of artistic integrity that I don't think applies here.  While The Black Album certainly is simpler fare, it also gave the band an opportunity to try new ideas, and in my opinion, broadened their range as artists, rather than narrowed it.<br /><br /> More practically, the album is vastly superior to prior ones in one particular area: production.  The sound is much clearer here than anything Metallica released before.  Lars' drumming is particularly prominent in the mix, which gives the album a bit of a harder edge.  Kirk Hammet's style has changed to suit the band's shift in direction.  While his solos are simplified along with the rest of the music, there's a greater focus on rhythm and melody than mere shredding.  The solos function as excellent hooks, and are the most memorable parts of several songs on the album (if you were alive at any time during the `90's, you WILL recognize the solo to \\"Enter Sandman\\").<br /><br /> I have a hard time judging the album as a whole here, because it's somewhat... schizophrenic.  It can't seem to decide what it is, and Metallica can't seem to figure out what they are.  I'm not talking about the music itself, although there are a variety of different styles at play here.  The tone is what's off.  It's not very often that you hear a goofy, b-movie themed song like \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" next to a cynical tirade against misplaced faith in \\"The God That Failed\\".  Stick an un-ironic sentimental ballad in the mix (\\"Nothing Else Matters\\"), and you've got an unusual blend of tastes.  And while any of these songs would be fine on their own, it's jarring when Metallica brings up religious hypocrisy and wants me to take it seriously after I just finished hearing about the monsters under my bed.<br /><br /> Despite that, the instrumentation is what really makes The Black Album.  There's a lot at play here, and the variety pays off.  \\"The Unforgiven\\" is one of my favorite tracks, and demonstrates the best of any that \\"selling out\\" doesn't mean \\"boring\\" or \\"uncreative\\".  The horn playing during the intro, and the classical guitar elements during the chorus make it a much better ballad than it would have been otherwise.  Other highlights include \\"Enter Sandman\\" for its incredibly catchy main riff and solo, and \\"Sad But True\\", a downtuned, grinding song, which features lyrics about loss of control.  It's ambiguous enough to be suitably ominous, and would feel right at home thematically on Master of Puppets.  \\"The God That Failed\\", \\"Through the Never\\", and \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" are all worthwhile songs as well, although the latter's lyrics are silly enough to bring it down a bit, inmy opinion.  That's six great songs.  Unfortunately, there are twelve tracks, and that's the first sign of a problem Metallica never had up to this point: The Black Album has a significant amount of filler.<br /><br /> A few I can forgive because they try to bring Metallica's old, fast style to their new fans.  Songs like \\"Holier Than Thou\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\" somewhat resemble thrash, but simply aren't complex enough to be interesting.  They aren't bad themselves, and fit well with the rest of the album, but a lot had to be sacrificed to fit its \\"mainstream\\" mentality.  \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" isn't really a bad song either, but its lyrics are so steeped in sentimentality that it comes off as artificial.  Ballads have to come off as genuine to work, and this one simply doesn't.<br /><br /> The rest, though, simply leave you wondering who honestly thought they were up to standard.  \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" has a few decent chord progressions, but is repetitive enough that it becomes boring early into its 6 minute length.  \\"Don't Tread On Me\\" is a bland bit of droning, and \\"My Friend of Misery\\" is easily the worst song the band recorded up to that point, with absolutely no cohesion or interesting ideas whatsoever.<br /><br /> The album is far from perfect, and let a great number of fans down.  And yet it still manages to be among Metallica's better material, for its wealth of ideas and mostly good songwriting.  Even most of the tracks I was less impressed with are still listenable, and I regularly give this one a listen from front to back.

B000002HMH|2.0|Listening to Load is an odd experience.  It's comparable to meeting a friend from high school again after four years of college, and finding out he's converted to some obscure, pantheistic, tribal religion.  He's enthusiastic about it, and really wants to get you pumped up about it, too, but all you can think about while listening is the old friend who talked about nothing but football and whose diet consisted solely of jalapeno-flavored Cheetos.  In less than five years, the person you remembered is now someone completely different.<br /><br /> Load is ostensibly a Metallica record, but much like your friend, they've abandoned their Cheetos for religion.  Okay, perhaps the analogy is starting to break down now.  I should say, they abandoned any trace of intelligence and creativity for simplistic drivel.  It may be a natural progression from The Black Album, in that it further lightens Metallica's sound and ventures more into different styles, but it lacks that album's redeeming qualities.  Where The Black Album incorporated new ideas alongside their old ones to create something new while still maintaining their identity, Load simply cribs other genres wholesale and creates largely unsatisfying derivatives of them.<br /><br /> Keep in mind, this was 1996, and grunge was in full-force.  Load was clearly an attempt to grab a piece of the pie, what with its blues elements, Hetfield's southern rock style vocals, and slow, meandering songs that frequently go nowhere.  Now, I'm not trying to imply grunge is bad; Alice in Chains is one of the better bands I've ever heard, and I listen to Soundgarden frequently as well.  I like grunge.  Load is not good grunge.  Load is not good rock, either.  Heck, Load is not good country during its brief flirtation with it.<br /><br /> I can't say there isn't anything worthwhile here.  \\"Bleeding Me\\" is actually a pretty fantastic song, \\"King Nothing\\" and \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" are serviceable rockers, and \\"Until It Sleeps\\" is a decent lighter song to break up the monotony.  That's four good songs, plus \\"Hero of the Day\\" and \\"2x4\\", which are listenable despite having some flaws.  Six worthwhile songs sounds good, but that's out of fourteen.  Yes, Load has fourteen tracks, and runs for a colossal 78 minutes and 59 seconds.  Metallica thought that was impressive enough to feature predominantly on the album cover, but I think it's generally a bad business move to let your audience know how long they'll be sentenced to musical purgatory if they buy it.  I'm a believer in quality over quantity when it comes to music, and it would have been much better if Load was half the length it ended up being.<br /><br /> In the end, half of Load simply ends up being boring.  \\"The House Jack Built\\", \\"Cure\\", \\"Poor Twisted Me\\", \\"Thorn Within\\", and \\"Ronnie\\" are simplistic, repetitive, and leave no lasting impression on the listener.  \\"Mama Said\\" has essentially the same problem, with the added offense of country, while \\"The Outlaw Torn\\" is decent, but about six minutes too long.  Load is essentially musical junk food, and while there's nothing wrong with that if it's what you want, it's insulting coming from Metallica, a band talented enough to write far better songs.  It's the musical equivalent of Stanley Kubrick directing Transformers.  Transformers isn't bad in and of itself, but it's far below the level of the man who directed 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br /><br /> The good news is, this is the worse that Metallica ever got (yes, I consider St. Anger to be better than Load, by a significant margin).  Although the follow-up, ReLoad, was similar, and perhaps even more mainstream, it showed a bit more refinement, and is generally more enjoyable.

Well, all post-apocalyptic Dystopian movies will share many similarities, from the dust-shrouded sky to dead vegetation, wandering gangs to small outposts run by the strongest and best armed. \\"The Book of Eli\\" does a better job than most. The environment is fantastic and believable, the de-evolution of society and technology dead-on. All colors are muted, almost sepia toned. Everything is gritty and dirty. Shampoo is worth it's weight in gold.<br /><br />If you enjoy this genre (post \\"we killed 'em all, let God sort them out) and low-tech survivalist flicks, then this will not disappoint.

We join Eli at the end of a decades-long journey, and see a glimpse of the possible future.  I could have done without the religious rhetoric and Oldman's character (Carnegie) believing that the book is the answer to everything and the source of all power. Denzel Washington gave a surprisingly good performance outside his \\"comfort zone\\", and the sexy Mila Kunis was a believable supporting character. The cast had plenty of other well known actors, from Jennifer Beals to Ray Stevenson, plus a decent supporting cast.<br /><br />Every character was well cast and acted - none seemed out of place (think Matt Le Blanc in \\"Lost in Space\\" or John Wayne as Genghis Khan).<br /><br />This is one of those movies I'll watch when I can't think of something else (along with the Resident Evil series!)

Using exercise as example of it seems the momentum of a habit has a lot to do with it's hopeful success. One last point that I really enjoyed from the book was that you only change a habit IF you really want to.. Sounds so simple and basic but that's what the book is really about.

As compelling a reading experience as the finest Stephen King, yet sci-fi to the core.  Mr. Howey has three great strengths that he employs in these 4 novellas and 1 short story:  1)  Great story-telling.  You feel like you are in the silo with these people.  2)  Characters you can relate to.  For me this is key.  Many sci-fi authors fall short in this area by having wooden, stock or boilerplate characters to complement their stories.  Not so in Wool 1-5.  I was riveted by the story and often stayed up into the early morning hours to read \\"just one more\\" chapter.  3)  Leaving you wanting more.  Luckily for me, Wool 1-5 left me wanting more.  There are many plotlines left to flesh out and areas to discover.  In fact, if there's one thing that impresses me most about Wool 1-5 it's that the author was able to make such compelling reading out of such a - on the surface at least - simple premise.  People living inside a concrete tube doesn't have to be compelling reading.  Yet thanks to Mr. Howey's unique ability to craft a compelling HUMAN story, Wool 1-5 rises far above the ranks of most sci-fi.  To me, these are modern day classics.  Awesome.  Simply awesome.  5/5
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Loved it! Couldn't stop playing.  Can't wait until part 2 comes out! Graphics and the plot are great.  Well worth the money spent.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|i just couldn't handle the fact that i have to purchase stuff to make the game more fufilling it's just bull. then there's the boost review that some people but and they dont even buy the frackin game to begin with if u review atleast play the damn game and see how good it is yourself douches.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app was fun at first. But after about 3 weeks I couldn't watch or download videos. this app sucks and I hate it.
B005DESVPO|5.0|This is the most talented new artist I have heard in a very long time.  He mixes blues rock (Bright Lights) with soul (Don't Owe You A Thang) and passion (When My Train Pulls In), along with an amazing talent of the guitar and a perfect voice.  Gary Clark Jr. gives me hope for my generations music!<br /><br />Don't hesitate and buy this EP right now!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|If i had the time to do so, I could have sat down and finished this book in a day, not because it is elementary at all but rather because it is well wirtten, informative and entertaining all in one.  If you are looking for \\"macho, rah rah\\" about this mission, you won't find it here.  If you are looking about an objectively written informative piece about how the Seal Family operates, this is it.  Enjoy.
1612183956|5.0|To say PINES is a page-turner is an understatement.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough! Wow, what a thoroughly enjoyable story.  It had all the elements that I love--gripping, likable characters, twists, action.  Oh my, it was NON-STOP action.  Nothing slow or boring. The story itself reminded me so much of The Twilight Zone.  Rod Serling would be proud. Then, there was the writing.  I loved the author's descriptive writing. I could easily imagine the setting and what was happening. Additionally, I loved remarks at the end from the author and the reason for the story.  Right after finishing, I went to Amazon and bought another of his novels. He has now become a favorite author. Thank you!!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I read \\"No Easy Day\\" and was very excited to hear a first hand account about the raid on Bin Laden from a Seal. The book was very interesting and well written and it was nice to know the facts about what really happened. I am 100% convinced that it was Bin Laden that was killed that day. I do not know what all the fuss was from the US govt. I didn't read anything that sounded like it could be classified and used against us. I would recommend this book.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|I'm not a fan of comic based movies, but Iron man has grown on me. The witty humor and likeable characters are just amazing. Robert Downey Jr. was a perfect fit for Tony Stark. All around great movie. :3
B008602KQI|5.0|So often I am disappointed by a movie after reading a great book, but this film captures the essence of this novel perfectly. If you loved reading The Hunger Games, you will also like the movie, although you do not have to read the book to enjoy the movie on its own. As in any film adaption of a novel, some has to be left out, but the resulting film will satisfy Hunger Games fans. I especially like Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss; she is perfectly cast. I hope that they make movies of the sequels and bring all of the actors back.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry are dynamite together in this beloved series about a goofball gentleman and his crackerjack \\"gentleman's personal gentleman\\".  The series has wide appeal and deals lightheartedly with serious things.  P.G. Wodehouse's world is entirely innocent and, because of that, compellingly funny.  It's everything you want in British comedy: understatement, clever wordplay, silly manners of expression, lots of leisure in stodgy country houses, and \\"stiff upper lip\\" resolve.  Poor Bertie Wooster is always unintentionally getting himself engaged to be married and his man Jeeves steps in each time to save him.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Used to work and loved it.  After an update it no longer loads.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times.  I am extremely diappointed.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Loved the book, was worried the movie wouldn't do it justice.  They did a great job with the characters and the set.  I didn't care for the close up fight scenes, though.  Although I assume they did that for the younger viewers, you knew what was happening, but couldn't really see it as well.
B0085A9J18|5.0|This is how you do a low budget action film. Gives you about 10-15 mins of setup and gets crazier by the moment. The one thing I didn't like is the fact that I barely knew any of the guys so if they were killed it didn't really matter cause you had no emotional connection to them. But putting that aside, this movie is bonkers. Basically the cops try to arrest a crime lord who houses other criminals in a highrise building and once the crimelord finds out they're there, he announces that whoever kills the cops gets to live there for free. And away we go! Crazy gun fights, hand to hand combat, explosions, knives, machetes,bats, good grief. Everything but the kitchen sink, buy they throw in a fridge so I guess that about does it.<br />I know I sound like someone associated with the film, but it's just that this was a really good action movie. Bloody, funny, and sometimes sad. It had it all. Definitely a buy.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|Excellent reading, not just a soft porn as people told me it was. It has a real story behind it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|this app works awesome except for the few times every so often it has trouble loading. you just have to exit and go back in.
1400097029|2.0|I'm trying to get into this book, but can't seem to do it. It's very sloooow, the characters aren't particularly engaging, and the plot is banal. I'm about half-way through, but I probably won't finish.
B0076L9W9Q|4.0|If you like Evanecense type sound/music, you will like this CD.  There are a few \\"slow\\" tracks, but mostly hard rock and guitar riffs.  I like it for the car, not for serious listening at home on the hi-fi though.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book....if like Lone Survivor you will not be dissapointed! Quick and easy read. I highly recommend giving this a shot.
B000001ELR|5.0|cd was in great shape for being used no scratches no skips has been in my cd player in my car for a week love it
B0068C9W44|5.0|I love all of Rihanna's albums and this is no different. She's so naughty!!! Great songs, great beats and her amazing voice make for a great record.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|You've seen all the gushing reviews about 11/22/63, and mostly, they'd be right. I read the book in a few days and man, what a delight those few days were. You almost didn't want the book to end. And speaking of ending, that's my only beef with this book: somehow, the ending isn't as emotionally fulfilling as the book's beginning and gradual build-up. It's like similar to some of Stephen King's other books, such as [[ASIN:074343627X Dreamcatcher]] and [[ASIN:0671024248 Hearts In Atlantis]] (as an aside, this book also somehow reminds me of [[ASIN:147921065X Xavier Decides to Stop A Killing: A Novel]]). Stephen King's [[ASIN:0452284694 The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)]], for example, starts so awesomely but somehow the end feels long dragged out.<br /><br />But overall, if you can overlook the ending, 11/22/63 is still a Stephen King winner.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Greaaaaat! It is the kind of movie a person will watch again and again.  Stay tuned in even after the credits there's a surprise at the end!  The only reason I saw it, was that I wanted to see where it was filmed.
B000JMKO3C|4.0|Veronika Decides to Die somehow reminds me of [[ASIN:B0098E4KFK Xavier Decides To Stop A Killing]], especially in terms of the moral dilemmas discussed in the novel. I've always loved Paulo Coelho ever since I laid eyes on the Alchemist. Overall, 'Veronika...' is a great addition to your Coelho collection.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Love everything Jodi writes....what a twist!  She makes one think about \\"what if's\\" that you'd never come up with.  Keeps you page turning to find out what on earth could happen next!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Enjoyed the movie, but not as much after reading the book.  Great book, good movie.  I would watch the movie anyway.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved this book!!! I have read it twice now and enjoyed it even more the second time around.<br />Makes me appreciate our military men and women even more, knowing that they put their lives on the line for us daily.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great movie. Although, if you rent it on Amazon you need to know there is approximately 20 minutes missing which means it has some scenes taken out of it.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Everybody who recommended it spoke highly of it but I found it boring. Wouldn't bother buying the trilogy. Waste of money
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. get on the bandwagon and get it so you can astop posting pictures of what you eat on facebook!
0525953728|5.0|Excellent and easy read. Makes you feel like your almost in the action. I have no idea why the White House or anyone else is upset. The author thoroughly explains that he has changed names and is not giving away national secrets or putting anyone in harm's way. It is obvious that the majority of the soldiers mentioned respected the position of commander in chief....but do not support Obama.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I've read previous books by Gillian Flynn, and this was the best. The author writes from a viewpoint that is dark, but not macabre. She certainly  does nail her characters. Everything about them was totally believable. Flynn always gives the reader a non typical story line and she doesn't disappoint this time either. A very good book that's hard to put down.
B0026ISUUQ|3.0|Movie was good, but a bit slow. The ending was a bit illogical though. The Justin Quayle(Ralph Fiennes)character did not have to die at the end.He sacrifices himself for nothing...just to \\"understand\\" his wife? Watch and see what you think.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Thank's for your service Sir, and thank you for tell what really happen instead of the BS coming out of....
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read the series first but my husband didn't. I loved the movie but he thought it was okay. Hope the next movie is just as good.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I was downloading stuff and then it stiled working. the pro is to much money. Downloders beware!!!! the last thing you want is to only downlode15 videos.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really enjoyed seeing the true facts of the raid on Osama Bin Laden's compound.  The background info on the Seals was also very interesting.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|I grew up listening to the likes of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, and have been into pop music since the Beatles released Rubber Soul. I've always loved electronic music from its beginnings with guys like Walter/Wendy Carlos and Larry Fast. When I discovered Skrillex and dubstep, I was amazed; to keep it short: I think Skrillex is a musical genius.<br /><br />This album is a great introduction to the world of dubstep, Skrillex does this style as well as anyone.  I'm not crazy about \\"Scatta\\", it gets a bit boring, but then Skrillex displays his lyrical side on \\"With You, Friends\\". I must admit that the first time I heard this cut, it brought tears of joy to my old eyes.<br /><br />And please don't get the MP3's, they are just not good enough for multi-layered powerful music like this.
B000FC10MU|4.0|No point in writing a plot synopsis on this one, thats all over the product page anyway.  What I will tell you is that Neil Gaiman spins an amazing tale here.  It's fun and and unique.  I really enjoyed this book and the characters, although I did feel that the new gods really didn't receive enough of the story to make them feel relevant, although the plot twist at the end is not something that i expected.  Although the book drags on a bit, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great story.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|I grew up listening to the likes of Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, and have been into pop music since the Beatles released Rubber Soul.

I'm not crazy about \\"Right on Time\\", it gets a bit boring, but \\"Right In\\" and \\"Breakn' A Sweat\\" (a collaboration with the surviving members of The Doors) are just freaking awesome.<br /><br />And please don't get the MP3's, they are just not good enough for multi-layered powerful music like this.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love a dark drama nad Gillian Flynn is the queen of dark. Her stories get better and better! In this one the main character is so troubled and flawed it's hard to read about her without cringing until you meet her mother. Holy cow is that woman twisted. And speaking of twists, the ending is unpredictable and perfect.
B0087HT36U|4.0|good gameeplay. nice time waster. friends love it. try it. you wont be disappointed. miniclips need to make more games. :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I was reluctant to buy this book thinking it would be a guy story but I found it enthralling, fast paced, and educational. Most of the details of the take down of Usama bin Laden were not told properly in the news stories I read/heard and it was interesting to get the details from someone who was actually there. I salute Mr. Owen for having the guts to write it.
B00511PTWM|1.0|Other reviews were right. Every time I hit a bump, this thing turns off. It's pretty annoying.<br /><br />I decided to have a full refund on this dual-port lighter. Based on the mix reviews, this particular product has some quality issue.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Truly heart stopping from the first sentence. This novel takes you back and forth and back and forth so many times you begin to think you are the crazy one. It's well worth the price in hardcover never mind the price for the kindle. It deserves it's number one spot in our local area!<br />How anyone could give it less than five stars is beyond me. Just try the sample and you'll be hooked!
0062082353|3.0|There is a good story behind this book.  I don't think that it is written the best, but still a good book to read.  I'm sure it is hard to tell true exciting stories when you have the US government and lawyers involved in the editing.  There are alot of good parts in the book, I think it just could have been written a little better.
0786958731|5.0|This game lets everyone play. I am not the biggest D&D nerd but i'm up in the ranks. I usually run the games with friends of mine that i think only play to humor me. this game lets everyone get a piece of the action of player and DM. there is very little set up time and the rules are easy to follow. You can play the game with JUST the stuff it comes with and if you are a veteran DM you can really spice it up by applying the rules from the full version of 4ed. The replay-ability is awesome and you can even play alone (as most of us veterans often do:) you get the adventure with the ease of a regular board game. Gets even the most uninterested players (my sister-in-law) into the game.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|The only reason i gave it four stars is because there is not an option to give it 10 stars. GREAT FAMILY CLASSIC!!!
B0096DFBZQ|4.0|I don't review apps often, but this game is Awesome. Its like Mario Kart. please make it so we don't have to use WiFi to play Multi-player. Change this and you got yourself a 5star!! Word!
B0096DFBZQ|2.0|The game would freeze everytime I pushed the arrows to turn and it would send me spinning in circles after the game. Would be a great game if it didn't freeze up
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is perfect for me just as it is. I use it when doing my bills and I like that it displays what amounts you have already put in. It's nothing fancy and that is okay....it's free.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|As I was turning the last page...I wanted to thank Mitch for another great book!  But The Time Keeper was more, it opened doors that I had forgotten, and moments that are special!

B000XR4OC0|4.0|I normally wear a size 10/10.5ish, and a pair of 9s in ash were just a bit too small. Ordered a pair of 9.5s, and so far they have lasted me about 5 months with moderate to heavy wear, and they even held up in the washing machine! I just ordered another pair of 9.5s in red, and they are definitely larger than the 9.5 in gray, but not so big that I feel the need to return them. Be prepared to exchange size if necessary!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|As usual great game.  Good story line and hidden object screens.  Can't wait for part 2.  Good game for the price.  Works great on my kindle.  No problems with the zoom feature.

1400049628|4.0|The Zombie Survival Guide is written by Max Brooks to be a fictional guide on how to survive the living dead. In many areas he goes into detail about the anatomy and strategies almost as though the zombie threat were real, even calling the zombie virus \\"Solanum\\". It tells the reader what you would need in the event of a zombie apocalypse, what to use as transportation, where to go, what to do, etc.<br /> It provides the reader with almost everything (if not everything) you could possibly need to know if zombies roamed the earth. Near the end of the book it also provides several historical accounts of zombie breakouts and attacks, and what to do in certain situations. I was unaware until now that the zombie apocalypse was taken so seriously.<br /> I greatly enjoyed this book. It has inspired me in many ways. I have loved zombies all my life and enjoy these kinds of books and games. I found myself after reading the book, checking the zombie movies to see if they matched up with how zombies really act. I was surprised to find that the zombie movies I watched lined up pretty well with the book.<br /> One of the things I like about this book is that it is set up as a guide. Not a novel. Throughout the whole book, all you are reading are facts and statistics and somehow it manages to keep you entertained all the way. The section I found the most entertaining was the area where Brooks documented all the historical events in which zombies had influence. Not only was it simply fun to read, but it also gave you that sense that zombies could, in fact, exist.<br /> I really enjoyed this read and would love to read the next in the series. I highly recommend it to any zombie lovers out there who are wondering exactly how to survive in the zombie apocalypse.<br /><br />4.5/5<br /><br />-Mr Stickm4n

B008BGNMZU|5.0|The most pleasing sounding jazz quartet to ever move about the planet, Fourplay delivers another gorgeous, collective recording here on ESPRIT DE FOUR. The supergroup currently features the three founding members, keyboardist Bob James, bassist/vocalist Nathan East and drummer Harvey Mason with their newest addition, guitarist Chuck Loeb taking up the 4th quadrant. Chuck brings a remarkable artistic sensitivity and jazz acumen to the project and digs in deeper on his 2nd Fourplay collaboration. Chuck states, \\"We were all in the mood to make an adventurous album with challenging music, but maintain that unmistakable Fourplay sound.\\" The name is a nod to the camaraderie the foursome enjoy in and out of the studio and on stages around the world... Picking up where they left off on the previous recording, ESPRIT DE FOUR delivers articulate musicianship and divine performance as you'd imagine from these four. Included, a touching tribute written by Bob James after 2011's devastating tsunami in Japan, \\"Put Our Hearts Together\\" appears as both an instrumental and a vocal version featuring Japanese pop star Seiko Matsuda. ESPRIT DE FOUR - Let the spirit move you!

B0092MKTL2|5.0|Enter Night Visions -- the first full length album by indie-rock band Imagine Dragons. This album captures the indie side of their music while being supported by the driving backbone of synth and electronic elements. It is a great blend of both styles and works quite well. This record showcases some great vocals, whether group vocals (\\"On Top Of The World\\"), or Dan Reynolds' powerful yet soaring voice (\\"Bleeding Out\\"). The instrumentation is all over the map. When the band isn't using its aforementioned signature synth, they are experimenting with a mandolin and embracing their folk side (\\"It's Time\\" & \\"Rocks\\"), though not so much as to stray from their roots. If there's one bad thing about Night Visions, it's that for long-time fans, this album is mostly old material. Those who have followed the band for a long time may not be impressed with the fact that the band just pulled old songs from their previous EPs, not even being so gracious as to re-record those songs, and stuck them on Night Visions. On the other hand, the new material (as well as the old) is very good: both \\"Tiptoe\\" and \\"Bleeding Out\\" are two of my favorites, and they were written for this album. For those of you who want extra material, iTunes has two bonus songs, \\"Working Man\\" and \\"Fallen,\\" both of which are very good. They complete this already fantastic album. The bottom line is this: Night Visions is a very strong debut from Imagine Dragons and is pure fun from start to finish. I am looking forward to what this band will do next!<br /><br />Recommended songs: Radioactive, Tiptoe, Hear Me, Bleeding Out
B008XG1X18|2.0|I love pinterest! the only draw back is it hasn't been working well on my kindle fire. I use it on my phone all the time when I'm on my breaks at work with no problems, but when I try to run it on my fire it always says app not responding. really needs a fix!

B008HK3XKO|4.0|As many have alluded to, there is an orientation issue with this case. If you have the case and either don't want to return it, or not spend the extra $$ for another case, there is a very low tech solution. If you put the Kindle in the case with the charging port facing out, you can place a refrigerator magnet (or some other type of magnet) on the cover \\"about\\" 4 inches from the top and \\"about\\" 1 inch from the outside edge. I have \\"about\\" in quotes because some of the placement depends on the size of your magnet. It took me a little while trying various positions before I got it to work. The magnet I'm using is strong enough that I placed it on the _outside_ of the case and used duct tape to secure it to the case.<br /><br />It's not a perfect solution, but if you don't mind how it looks, it works okay. Too bad Marware didn't just place two magnets in the case...or perhaps a long strip, which probably would have made this case just about perfect.<br /><br />Other than the orientation issue (which has bothered me more than I thought), it is a good case. I like the way the \\"hands free\\" mode is designed.

0307269752|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a really good book. It's really hard for me to find books I want to read. I saw the movie, and instantly knew I wanted to read the book. When I read the book I was practically there, and I couldn't seem to put it down. The book was really slow, and dull in the beginning. I thought about giving up, and returning it. I didn't really start paying attention to the book until chapter three. I can really relate to the relationship between Blomkvist, and Berger.<br />Blomkvist had just left Millennium, when Henrik Vanger offered him a job. Vanger asked Blomkvist to write a biography, while at the same time solving the alleged murder of Harriet Vanger. Henrik offered 2.4 million kroner, and added more incentive to the deal by promising information to prove Wennerstr&ouml;m's a scoundrel. How could Blomkvist not take that offer? After accepting the offer, and notifying Berger the book took off. This book had everything I could of asked for. There was love, scandals, murder, and mystery. I was at the edge of my seat at the end of almost every page. I thought I knew who the murderer was the whole book, but at the end there was a huge twist.
B006O2QNOU|1.0|Despite a talented cast, the script is awful. The plot is dull, even for a 'based-on-a-true-story.'  I wouldn't waste my time with this.  If you're interested in '08 market collapse, watch the PBS Frontline, \\"Money, Power, and Wall Street.\\"  There is more drama in that documentary than in this drama.

Great graphics (though not lifelike, more cartoonish), storyline is great, hidden object scenes are good, and it takes some creativity to figure your way through all the puzzles and different levels.  I've already played this game through a few times and haven't tired of it yet.  Games 2 and 3 times the cost of this one don't even come close. Please make more of these games Alawar!!

Upon arriving at the rental house, Kel has met a boy his age and Layken has met a guy. He just happens to be the hunky brother of the 9 yo.<br /><br />Will Cooper is dreamy. I mean, Will Cooper is a great character and has a lot of heartache and secrets that Lake will soon find out. The two of them become closer within a few short days and the two younger brothers become fast friends. Layken's mother takes an instant like to Will and encourages Lake to give him a chance.<br /><br />Will takes Lake out on a date a few days after arriving and brings her to a poetry slam. Lake is amazed by what she is seeing and listening to. She's never done anything like this before and is mesmerized. Will agrees to perform one of his poems. It's there that she finds out that Will's mother and father were killed in a horrible car accident three years ago and he has been raising his little brother ever since. Lake is moved to tears and finds herself actually falling for Will.<br /><br />That is until Monday rolls around. Lake's first day of school is interesting. She meets Eddie (a girl) her boyfriend, Gavin. And her English elective teacher, one Mr.Will Cooper. Will realizing that he cannot jeopardize his job, informs Layken that they can no longer see each other because it will cause problems and taking care of his brother is the most important thing right now. Lake is torn between what is right and what she wants.<br /><br />As much as the two try to stay away from each other, they find it more and more difficult. The pull to bring them closer grows stronger. It also becomes more stronger when Layken finds out the reason why they moved to Michigan. Julia Cohen has been diagnosed with Stage four lung cancer and before her father passed, they had decided to move to Michigan for Julia's treatment. Lake is horrified to realize that she'll be left alone and that her mother wants a family friend to care for Kel.<br /><br />Because Lake is losing her mother and Will and Caulder (Will's brother) have grown close to the Cohen's, Will takes in Lake to work through her feelings. Lake is angry at her mother, well more like pissed. But she feels safe with Will as well. As much as those two try to hide their feelings, they just can't. Pretty much everything comes to a head when Lake is being accosted by a classmate at the poetry slam, and Will punches out his student. He immediately resigns from the school and is transferred to another school district.<br /><br />You would think that it would work out for Will and Lake to get together, but it sort of does the opposite. Because he is so busy with traveling and relying on the Cohen's to help with Caulder, Will and Lake don't see enough of each other.<br /><br />However Will realizes that he cannot live in a world without Lake and after she comes clean in a poetry slam, he does the same declaring his love for her.<br /><br />I have no clue who the Avett Brothers are, but they are quoted at the beginning of each chapter. Lake and Will's favorite group is the Avnett Brothers and they fall in love over their words of wisdom. This book opened up so many emotions for me. And I cried, boy did I cry when I read this. I was literally pulled into the story, the poems, the little one's halloween costume. Will and Lake's romance was so brittle and beautiful. When he realizes that he doesn't want the ocean, but the lake, you can't help but sigh because you know that he is finally coming to terms with his feelings. When he kisses her in the laundry room, when she carvespumpkins because she can't deal with what is going on around her. Even when she organizes and alphabetizes everything because she can't stop the stress, Will is falling for her.<br /><br />If there is one book you read this year, I suggest you read this one. It will leave you breathless and happy and sad, and amazed. Colleen Hoover wrote a fantastic book and thankfully there is a wonderful sequel as well.pumpkins because she can't deal with what is going on around her.

B0073COMUW|5.0|When i first bought this bulb, there were no reviews, and there was really no proper description of the product.<br />I wanted to give it a go anyway since i just really needed a 60W replacement for a good price. This was the one.<br /><br />When I screwed this one into place, and switched it on, alas! There was light, and I must say its brighter than the actual fluorescent bulb i originally had in its place. Now, i just have one bulb lighting my entire room. I still think its very bright, and given that LED's last for a very long time, im sure thing one will, and retain its brightness.
B0084P9202|1.0|I recently bought this album to have the material I needed to enter a film contest.  We had to make a music video to one of the songs on this album.  I thought that since it was only $6 bucks that I wouldn't regret the purchase.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />The music is supposed to be highly emotional and very deep.  After a couple of listen-throughs, I heard weepy, cheesy-ethereal, emo music that I could put as a background track to a couple having a picnic, who then kill themselves in some sort of faux sense of irony.<br /><br />I'm usually not one to say that all the tracks sound the same.  I listen to a lot of music that other people would attribute that phrase to, but I always argue that each track is individual and I always can point out the differences that, to me, set the tracks apart.<br /><br />I cannot say that with this album.<br /><br />Every track bites off of the same feeling, with no real discernible difference.  If you want the weepy, ethereal, background music feel free to purchase.  I don't want to sway anyone or hurt sales, this is just my 2 cents, but this was pretty terrible for my taste.

Although most songs are unmistakeably Abba, the sound on several songs, however, has turned towards a more techno-approach, a trend that was continued in the handful of songs that the group recorded for the never finished ninth album.<br /><br />Among the singles on the album \\"One of Us\\" was by far the biggest commercial success, but also \\"Head Over Heels\\" and especially \\"When All is Said and Done\\" have gone down in history as some of the group's greatest numbers.<br /><br />Lyrically, it is also clear that the group has more at heart than what might have been the case on the early albums. A song like \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" is about how fleeting the time you have with your children may occur, a beautiful and moving song. The theme of the breaking up, is well known with Abba, but hardly described as fine and movingly as on \\"When All is Said and Done\\".<br /><br />\\"Two for the Price of One\\" is musically a very exciting track - a shame that it was not sung by one of the girls - could then perhaps have made it as a single.<br /><br />The bonus tracks come from sessions in 1982, with the B-side \\"Should I Laugh or Cry\\" derived from \\"The Visitors\\" sessions.<br /><br />As a fantasy an excellent ninth album could have been put together, showing even stronger techno influence to their music. Six songs recorded in 1982 could have formed the backbone of such an album. If supplemented with non-album B-sides \\"Abba Under Attack\\" could have have looked like this:<br />1. Under Attack / 2. You Owe Me One / 3 Just Like That / 4 Should I Laugh or Cry / 5 Just Like That / 6 I Am the City / 7 Elaine / 8 The Day Before You Came / 9 Put On Your White Sombrero.

1449320104|5.0|I own the 3.0 version and love it so much, that I had to get this new version.  I've been coding in C# for something like 7 years and learned all kinds of new things from this book (and the previous version).  The author does an excellent job of giving clear and concise examples that stand well on their alone (i.e.--you don't have to have read everything up to this point to understand what he is doing).  The format is easy to read and there isn't a lot of fluff.  At just over 1000 pages, people give me grief about the \\"in a nutshell\\" part, but there's plenty of C# related things that the book does not cover like WPF, WCF, GDI+, ASP.NET, etc. so this really is just the core C#.<br /><br />Highly recommended!

030758836X|1.0|I couldn't wait to purchase this book because everyone was talking about how great it is... NOT!!! I should have gone with my gut after, being bored out of my mind, reading the first 50 pages and put this uninteresting waste of a book down.  Don't spend your money or time on this book... I'm so sorry i have wasted both!  UGH.
B005PTYP70|5.0|I like it lots, or would not have order it! It's a classic, (now it is!) wanted it for my colection.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Excellent the movie, unsurpassed quality is also spoken and subtitled in Spanish 5.1, but the description does not mention it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love Pinterest and since I spend most of my &quot;computer time&quot; on my kindle, it's awesome to have Pinterest for the kindle. Haven't had any problems.
B008XG1X18|4.0|So much easier to navigate and browse! Would be 5 stars if you could open the links in the background without having to get out of pinterest.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|usually I don't write reviews for games, but this one deffinetly deserved it. I wish I could write a bad review for this only because it is dangerously addicting. spent $2 on it already and its only been about 20 minutes playing lol great game:)
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great. app.  Able to change sound, method of turning off alarm. I use it as backup to my regular alarm.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|this game COULD be fun, but it isn't. The controls are horrendous. Mostly the directional arrows don't work like they should. fix please!! Kindle Fire HD
B008J05EL8|5.0|What is wrong with charging an extra five bucks for a font accessory package. In the office suite they provide you with all the main fonts. Aerial, times roman, Cambria, wingdings, couple others. I know this is a review site on the font accessories but not unreasonable if you want additional rare fonts.  While I'm here the office suite is very nice with high reviews.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it a really fun game I play with my brothers and it is a really creative game for people with imagination.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|From the heart. No double talk. So PC. Touching, moving, action filled. Gave me a real sense of the men who fight to keep our country free and the sacrifices they make. Real insight into the drama without the political motivation and back stabbing.  Needed to be written and needs to be read.
1401216676|5.0|I must start by saying that I'm very new to comic books and graphic novels. The Killing Joke is one of the first I've read. I really didn't know what to expect from it and I always found it conflicting to choose between text and image whenever I first turned a page. My first instinct would be to read the text and pass on to the next box. But this book was just a visual treat! I could get lost in the detailed artwork and lose myself in the graphics. I haven't seen the past edition so I can't really compare the two (differences which seem to be a big part here from what I've read in the introduction and afterword). But I really loved it! It was a great way to spend a cold rainy afternoon and I'll probably read it again and again.<br />The introduction by Tim Sale was kind of helpful in making me appreciate the contents of the book more as I read it.<br />What can I say more? I'm hooked on Batman.<br />As for amazon, first purchase from them, very pleased with everything, great price.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I contacted the developer, G5 Entertainment regarding problems with the app completely locking up my phone. I am able to play for a little while, but then the game pauses itself and my phone becomes completely unusable. I was thinking that maybe it had to do with ICS. They first told me that since I rooted my phone that they would not help me, but did say to uninstall the app, and install it again. I checked the version number here to the version on Google Play (because with my experience, I know that developers will release the apps here to see how they do and then abandon them). The last update on Amazon was over 10 months ago. No wonder it isn't working! Anyway when I am able to play the game, I really love it, thus the reason for two stars, not just one. Awful customer service from developer.
145470246X|5.0|I have purchased all of the Beadweaving Master Class Series and each one is beautiful and a welcome addition to my beading library. Sabine Lippert's Beaded Fantasies is certainly at the top of my list. The projects are modern and classic at the same time. Although I have found the instructions to be clear, a beginner might struggle a little bit but I have always found it beneficial to try to understand patterns above my skill level as I do not have the ability to attend any workshops with other beaders.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Im giving this movie four stars as the cgi and action was very cool, but the acting was fairly crude.. it was a little transformers, meets War of the Worlds,..  as far as beeing entertained this movie was great for mindless viewing and thats the point i believe, i wont be adding it to my blue-ray collection but im glad i got to see it.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I am very happy with the Seiko Men's watch.  I love the color and the size of the watch.  The fabric band is exactly what I have been looking for.  I like that there is no battery to replace, but this means if the watch is not worn every day resetting the time/date is necessary unless there is access to a device that keeps the watch moving.  Great bargain!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|All versions of the Bible at my fingertips makes a very convenient study tool.  At church I use it also because we use different versions of the bible there too.  Highly recommended
B004MC8CA2|5.0|wonderful app. love the way it links all your related highlights/bookmarks/notes together. awesome full screen reading option. some cool reading plans, as well. i use it for the easy switch between reading/notetaking.<br /><br />kindle fire hd.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|Harry Potter was fantastic at the theater, wonderful on DVD, and exceptional on Blue-ray.  I have every movie on DVD. I was determined not to switch to blue-ray. After seeing this edition, I am swapping out my DVD collection for a Blue-ray collection.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|for people who had problems with an update that wasnt on the app store all you do it unstall it and install it again and it works great very useful app
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It did the book well.  I watched the DVD two consecutive Saturdays and no doubt will again.  I hope they do the 2nd and 3rd books of the trilogy.  BTW, the Hunger Games trilogy caused me to write my first Amazon review.  I haven't in the past because I just don't want to take the time to do reviews nor surveys (even the one's that include a few bucks in the envelope).  The last comment is off track but you get the idea.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love this show and have seen it more than 5 times, it's amazing, funny, interesting, I don't know a single person who doesn't find it fantastic, this set is cheaper than others I've seen elsewhere and perfect.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|The book was well done.  It followed the format of The Lone Survivor more than I had hoped.  Too, much time spent in Seal Team 6 school and qualifying.  I wanted to read it before the government tried to snatch it off the shelves.
B006RED4GA|4.0|Ti West is a fantastic filmmaker of modern horror. He knows how to build that sense of dread throughout his films. With The Innkeepers and House of the Devil, he is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. His old school ways of building a slow burn film up to a fantastic and horrific climax is what I want out of a horror movie. The Innkeepers is a perfect example. West slowly fleshes out the story and lets you get to know the characters, while staging some creepy and tense sequences throughout until things get really crazy and the film becomes terrifying. I watched this with my girlfriend and she closed her eyes the last 15 minutes because she was so afraid, and then she asked me what happened after the movie was over. The final shot of the film perfectly exhibits how West can build that tension and sense of dread throughout his films. Loved this movie
B008MG1E4A|3.0|Besides the event that matters, nothing very different from other books about those brave guys, the Seals.<br />Would make a good action movie.
B0080CL0HM|3.0|This movie was okay, I wasn't super impressed. It seemed to move along slowly.......... just my opinion. It was a rainy day movie I just watched to pass time. It wasn't too horrible but it wasn't that great either.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|started out as just something to mess with. now I am hooked on the game. lots of fun.<br />give it a try and see. Fun and free. now thats for me.<br />easy level ups.
B000ICXQGK|5.0|What dreams may come is a stunning and well portrayed journey through some of lifes most sensitive heart wrenching ordeals.<br />The loss of a child,depression,marriage breakdown,suicide,The afterlife ,heaven,hell...and the prevailing power of love.Amazing!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Product arrived safe and sound.  Quality is as expected...great.  Story line for this season is very engaging.  Enjoying it greatly.<br /><br />Thx...DWF
B0002B15XI|5.0|An extremely funny movie for those who have served in the military! For those who have not, not so funny!
0439023521|1.0|I can't write about the product because I rec'd the wrong item.  I contacted customer service, but was never mailed a return mailing label.  Very poor.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Too too too!!!! The new lphrase for this decade should be \\"Laters Baby!\\". Just wait to savor number three. What a love story!
B004I8WD6E|1.0|Clear case choices for the iPhone are annoyingly few, but nevertheless I recommend against this one, STRONGLY.  I think a lot of the positive reviews are by people who haven't used it long. I was happy with it at first--it was only after a few months of use that I noticed problems.<br /><br />I got it for a brand new phone and after using it for a few months, discovered circular markings on the glass back plate of my phone that matched the pattern on the back of the case. At first I assumed they were just stuck-on dust/grease and would clean away when I got around to cleaning it thoroughly (the case does trap dust and lint at every edge, as others point out). With continued use it became clear they were scratches/scuffs. That could have been avoided with a stick-on protector, but the case also left what turned out to be permanent scuffs in the finish on the metal part of the phone: near the phone corners, at the edges of the openings for the various side buttons, and even along the flat top and sides where I can only assume some pocket lint got in and had enough space to rub around.<br /><br />The case also relatively quickly discolored to that nasty yellow-brown tinge that cheaper plastic gets over time, probably starting no later than the 5 or 6 month mark.  Yuck.<br /><br />It does add a lot of bulk compared to many other similar cases, and is a bit sharp-cornered (now that I've abandoned it, I really notice how much more comfortable my 'naked' phone feels in my hand), but that alone isn't a crippling fault. In fairness, I did use it through several phone drops and innumerable shovings into purses full of random stuff, and my phone came through intact.  The included screen protector also worked fine. Literally the only damage my phone suffered with this case on was from the case itself.<br /><br />If you are looking for a clear case for an iPhone, it's probably because you like Apple's design better than any of the vast selection of decorative covers out there, which ironically means that, like me, you'll probably be the kind of person most annoyed when this case permanently marks up your phone.  (Annoyed enough to leave a half-page review on a $6 item, even!) Steer clear.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Interesting book with some amusing revelations..  This is not a Tom Clancy novel, but after reading this book,you get.a deeper appreciation of our military.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading the Hunger Games last night, I jumped right into Catching Fire. I enjoyed learning about the other winners from the Games and some of their backstories. The romance between Katniss and Peeta is as sweet as it is heartbreaking. There's a lot less humor but much more depth than Book 1. Great filler book! Now on to the Mockingjay..
0525953728|2.0|I bought this book thinking it was an very descriptive  story about how the Navy Seals work and did work to kill Bin Laden. I am more than 3/4's through the book. I am very disappointed that it is just a story. It has no details that you can not see in a Navy Seal Movie.  The story is good but  the 'FIRST HAND ACCOUNT of the MISSION\\" is a big let down to me. Maybe I just expected to much.<br /> I wish I had not paid full price for the book.<br />just my opinion
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I saw the movie in theaters and after I thought, I must buy that movie!!! I loved how they brought all the heros from there own awesome story's into one! I can't wait till spider man joins the avengers!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|everyone in my family is obssessed with this game. it is one of the few apps I have ever seen them pay money for
B0087HT36U|4.0|This game is a lot more fun than anticipated. It could use a little work on the destruction side of things. All in all, this is a fun and addictive game.
B005JABN8Y|5.0|Produto de exelente qualidade e acabamento impecavel. Nota 10. Exelent product and perfect loialty. I am very happy for to buy with exelent seelers like this.
B00957T6X6|1.0|This is not a 1 star review based on the content. GRRM's books are fantastic and this series is one of my favourites. The 1 star rating is for the 5-book kindle \\"boxed\\" set.
