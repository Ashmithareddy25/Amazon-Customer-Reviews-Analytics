B000FC0SIM|5.0|I'm writing my first novel, and his advice helps make my writing even stronger and more clear. Plus his story about getting published helps inspire me to keep going on my novel.
B0009QZ4CO|5.0|Eternal life from another perspective.  Perhaps being a vampire isn't all it's cracked up to be ~ The lyrics of the song Still Life can give one a greater understanding of death as an expedient which adds value to life.  \\"The citadel reverberates . . . .\\"  Who else writes songs that start with lyrics like this?  No.  I mean it.  If you know of anyone, please let me know.  It would be worth a listen.  VDGG is still one of the best most creative bands, period.  If you haven't heard them, do yourself a favor and give them a listen. Expressive/Progressive rock that still is ahead of it's time 30 years later!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game for all ages, classic bingo with a fun twist. I love how you can get multiple cards and also upgrade cards for multiple bingos on one card.

B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Works with all types of iPod docks so you can convert anything to 3.5mm. Use it in my car and with my surround sound.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|I love this practical book.  The information and techniques will assist anyone looking to improve communication skills.  I highly recommend it.
B0041D843M|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone. I was reading a lot of food/health/vegan books but not many of them had enough information to back up their claims. This has a ton of great information AND it was dumbed down enough for me to understand it.
B004FOOQV6|5.0|I purchased this app to help me with Volume Conversions.  Working in a restaurant, being able to convert quarts in to tablespoons and teaspoons quickly is quite useful.  Its also interesting to play around with all the other measurements.
1451695195|3.0|The author has wonderful writing skills and I finished the whole book, even though he was a little too technical for me re: the 'consciousness' discussion..I don't know how many readers will accept his experience as proof of heaven..
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|My Tween and I Liked Matched, so got this to read next, but didn't finish it. Was a little boring,dragging on with no real suspense to make us want to pick it up and finish it.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Dropbox allows me to quickly and easily share files between my desktop, laptop and tablet.  I use it for work and at home.  Moving files from one device to the other.  The amount of free storage available has been more than enough for all of the files I move around.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a bit too cumbersome for a senior citizen like myself.  Short stubby fingers and the like create some problems.  But despite<br />the awkwardness, I enjoy it immensely.
B004KPLVYA|5.0|My friend was thrilled to receive it for Christmas....she loves the sound-track.  It arrived quickly and in great condisiton.  Thanks!

B008HK3XYK|5.0|It's pretty, durable and well priced. I was nervous when I first recieved my Kindle Fire, because I was terrified of dropping it. Now I feel more confident with this case, and it looks great.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ah-mazing!!!! Heart felt, well written, and an all around beautiful read. It was really hard to put down, it will stay with me for a very long time.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent writing, realistic characters, couldn't put this book down.  I hope there is a sequel to this book so we can continue to follow Sky and Holder.  Loved it!!!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so much fun!  It can become a time sink tho.  I wish that the coins regenerated faster as that would make the experience even more enjoyable.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Tis book would help those who do not believe to understand the wonders of our body and brain .Great for others in the<br />medical field like myself.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|Every time that you get close to beating the computer, the game suddenly ends in a draw.  This game sucks
B000SEGQNS|5.0|A classic of good website design. Even though it has been around for quite some time and thus does not contemplate many tools that are now available to web designers, the principles of good design continue to stand. A book every web designer should have by his/her side.
B007R6UWN0|5.0|This is as good as the books. Best part is how the histories are linked togeather at the end. A must see if you love this type of thing.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Star Wars and this version of the Angry Birds game is in my opinion the best one out there.  Love the new &#34;birds&#34;!!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i read to to see what the big deal was all about and was hooked.  don't ask why, just read all three books and you'll know why.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a great book. It was the best book ever I real this year. This book was so silly and funny, I like.this book
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|I am seven and I am writing in my mom's account. I really liked this book. The characters were really funny.  I liked the whole book. It took me two days to read the book.  I will read more Wimpy Kid books.

B005LAII9O|1.0|After his hugely enjoyable \\"Natural Born Killers\\" I was looking forward to Oliver Stone's \\"Savages\\".  It is dreadful.  The script seems to have been written by one of the less intelligent Mills & Boone authors.  John Travolta did his best, as did Salma Hayek, to make something of this pathetic script but you can't polish a t*rd! As for the lead parts, they were unbelievable and the actors were totally unconvincing.  There is a reference to \\"Butch Cassidy ...\\" but that was then and does not justify this mess.
B008PALI5S|5.0|This is not my favorite Mahler Symphony.  I usually have hard time finishing it from start to end.  This one is different.  Two Symphony orchestras and four choirs, a total of 1400 musicians combined with an excellent recording and performance makes this a unique and historic recording.  I highly recommend it.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Can't wait for Ted to finally meet his wife! I would be very sad if this show continued past season 8 without meeting her. Though I wouldn't mind a spin-off with the same cast with Ted finally having a girl.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|I got this app so as to be able to know when my battery charge on my kindle was low, and also so I'd know how long it would take to charge. The app has exceeded my expectations and then some. Not only does it tell me those two things but also  tells me how much time I have for a multitude of other things, such as reading, 3d gaming, video etc, etc...<br /> It also lets me know the temperature of the battery and it's health. All in all, a very useful app and well worth the money.
0756407125|5.0|Regardless of genre, this is one of the best books I've ever read. Right up there in the top 5, along with the first book in the series The Name of the Wind. It's told in the first person, which in some circles is considered the mark of a beginning writer, but altho this may be only his second book, he writes like a master, with clarity, wit and a remarkably wide story line. Questions raised in the first book are touched on but by no means solved in the second book. As a published writer myself, I understand how brutally hard it is to carry suspense that long, to remember all the strings you have hanging, to weave them seamlessly back into the story.<br />It has unforgettable characters and enough of them to make me work at remembering who everyone is and how they relate. I love being a bit challenged by a book. The world he's created is memorable and fascinating, peopled with races as varied as they are interesting, especially the Adem.<br />I could go on and on, but I'll end with: if you like fantasy, you'll love this book. If you like deftly skilled writing, you'll love this book. If you read to escape, you'll love this book.
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|If you're looking for something original, this movie is not. It's the same formula as many other recent singing and dancing movies. Still, the singing it excellent and it's a fun distraction.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The latest update won't install on my kindle fire HD. Very annoying. Had to reinstall the free version. Please fix!

B005723JSQ|4.0|This was a cute, fun book to read. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't bother buying it- just get it from the library.
B008YKRRI6|2.0|This cycle of Beethoven's Symphonies is slow. Really slow. As I listened to each symphony I kept notes based on Amazon's subjective scale: 5 stars = I love it! to 1 star = I hate it!<br /><br />First Symphony - baseline, it's OK, 3 stars<br />Second Symphony - I don't like it, 2 stars<br />Third Symphony - 2 stars<br /><br />At this point I was getting disheartened, because other reviewers had praised these performances so highly.<br /><br />Fourth Symphony - the overall concept holds together well, I like it, 4 stars<br />Fifth Symphony - starts OK, then bogs down in the last two movements, 2 stars<br />Sixth Symphony - starts stately, but loses steam in the fourth movement, 3 stars<br /><br />Actually, my notes start to turn hostile here. I don't think Amazon would allow me to publish my original thoughts on the Sixth.<br /><br />Seventh Symphony - sludge, 2 stars<br />Eighth Symphony - doesn't mess it up, 4 stars<br />Ninth Symphony - joyless, 2 stars<br /><br />The second movement of the Ninth was particularly hard to bear. In loose terms, Klemperer falls into the now discredited trap of accelerating to half tempo instead of double time. More Moderato than Presto.<br /><br />So the highpoints of the cycle for me were the Fourth and Eighth. That's a poor recommendation. I was simultaneously listening to the [[ASIN:B00000IFP6 David Zinman/Tonhalle]] cycle, which sounds overcaffeinated in comparison. My preference of tempos seems to fall somewhere in the middle. I have the Josef Krips/LSO cycle on [[ASIN:B000001RR1 Bescol]] CDs. The digital transfer is horrible; the treble is so brittle that it sounds as if the clarinets will snap. But the underlying performances have an engaging humor and charm, and I love the reverb of the hall.<br /><br />I had the sudden thought that I might like Klemperer's recordings if I could play them faster. I downloaded a demo version of the Amazing Slow Downer (which also is a Speed Upper) to give it a try. A 20% increase of speed gave the symphonies a new life; the Second showed buoyancy and delicateness; the Eroica started with a snap and stayed driven. Was this how Klemperer heard them in his head? What would Oliver Sacks have to say about brain injury and temporal perception?<br /><br />A 20% increase proved too much for the Ninth Symphony, but +10% made a noticeable difference. The first movement now simmered with anticipation of unleashed potential energy. The second movement now bounced, and I was able to \\"fix\\" the acceleration to the Presto by bumping it to +35%.<br /><br />Am I destroying Klemperer's artistic concept by speeding up his tempos? Not really. Classical music collections around the world remain untouched by my actions. But just as listeners (and indeed remasterers) can adjust the equalization of a recording for more pleasing sound, I have a new playback tool that increases my enjoyment of a performance. The net gain is at least 2 stars for me.the symphonies a new life; the Second showed buoyancy and delicateness; the Eroica started with a snap and stayed driven.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I can't put it down.  As always the characters are engaging, and you're never really sure if it is fiction or real.....
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Same as for hidden #s. Very tough but entertaining. Just wished there was a non- timed version of the game.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Nice Controller It is an original PlayStation 3 not an imitation been using it for a year and no problems.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is a great collection at a great price.  Our new family tradition is to watch the entire series over winter school break.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|A funny and entertaining movie.  A wonderful escape from the problems of the world. Get a beverage  and some popcorn and have a great night.

B002SF9YUM|5.0|Robert Pattinson gives an enduring portrayal of a young and eccentric Salvator Dali while Javier Beltran shines as the great Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca, whose life was taken at a tender age, depriving the world of one its greatest poets. The movie recounts the early encounter of the two at the renowned School of Fine Arts and the friendship that ensues, a friendship which transforms into a deep,unrequited love.<br />Just a small warning: for any diehard Twilight fans of Rob's, this might not be the movie for you.<br />For anyone else with a certain freedom of thought, this is without a doubt a beautiful, sensitive and enduring film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing!  its also really addictive!  I just got it and I wish I would have found it sooner!
0979019710|5.0|Must read. Great advice for all ages and all situations.  Easy read in one sitting but then read it over and over to get the most benefit.

B0084U0IEG|3.0|I wonder what all the hoopla is about... So many good reviews... but it's a decent read that deserves three stars.
0452273331|5.0|I do not make a habit of reviewing purchases with Amazon. However, Ayn Rand's books deserve such an exception. I was completely taken aback by the subject matter and how profoundly it has affected me. The reason why I will not give away any description about the subject matter is because not only is it readily available but also because I think everyone should purchase this book and discover for themselves why her books are still in print. Rand's books should be read often and more than once. Universities should have all her books as required reading for freshmen; better yet they should have a specific Ayn Rand course where her books would be read and discussed for their meanings. This is my first read of any of Rand's books. I have also purchased ATLAS SHRUGGED and I am in the process of reading it. Just as impressed with this one as I was with THE FOUNTAINHEAD. What I did not realized is that these books are prolific so expect to handle about 2 lbs. of book. I guess for anyone who might want to go the easy way, the Kindle versions would be much easier to handle. However, I love to still turn the pages of an actual book in my hands and also enrich my library with great books.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|What can I say? Susan Boyle has the Best Voice I have ever had the privilege to hear. Susan Boyle is by far<br />Extraordinary!  I bought her CD &#34;Someone to Watch Over Me&#34;. I loved it.  This CD &#34; Standing Ovation&#34; is even better. Her voice is amazing in both CDs.  I love &#34;Standing Ovation&#34; a tiny bit more because I like the<br />the Production better. The Mixers are excellent and the Mastering is remarkable. The Musicians Exemplify<br />the very best talent .<br />I was thrilled that Ms. Boyle recorded &#34;Music of The Night &#34;with Michael Crawford. ( one of my favorites). Two Best Voices teamed together, what more could you ask for.  I must say however, Donny Osmond? No, Not!<br />I could not believe my ears! Beautiful! I guess that just goes to show, being judgmental is an ignorant<br />aspect of our human condition.
B004132HZS|5.0|This is perfect. My second favourite show (first being Doctor Who) on  DVD. The episodes are perfect, the commentery is brilliant, the unaired pilot was a bit of a surprise BUT A VERY WELCOME ONE, and oh gosh these actors are really pretty.

B008NMT684|2.0|My three year old quickly mastered all of these never-changing puzzles and became bored with the app. Very low replayability.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I loved this book so much I started following the author's blog. Her writing is so fluid. The characters and plot were magical. I loved this book!
B008AU7F3C|3.0|First of all, My moods change. When this CD arrived, I did have a bit of a stressful day. I played it and I thought it was kind of cool however I may not have been in the best mood to review this. It is not a CD that I would play over and over again.... I bought a couple more of Bat for Lashes. I have not had the time to listen to them as yet. I did like her voice. I gave this CD to a friend and she was not impressed.  I will listen to the other CD's and let you know my opinion. Thank Goodness my opinion is not the last word on any artist! I did listen to the tiny &#34;Taste&#34; of the music.  I must have liked some of the CD's or I would not have bought more than one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much, I found it hard to put down. There were many surprises and the ending was especially surprising.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For the second time in the past few months, this book has surprised me again! It captured the beauty in the woods and a desperate attempt for a young girl to survive so the can return to her poor family to support them once again! Great book to read for anyone!
B009KNPPS0|5.0|This comprehensive, meticulous and high- quality awe-inspiring issue is a work of art from the Fender tweed cover to the remastered vinyl.  A tribute amongst many tributes to a mesmerizing and inimitable guitarist.  The reprinted concert programs and DTS recording are a plus for boomers who have travelled this far and any newer fans who SHOULD be listening closely as well!  Thank you for a world-class production!
B00633W614|3.0|Hope there is a follow up book as the end left you wondering does any one know if there is please
B009LA1QW6|4.0|I like her CD. I like her voice and I like her music. I would not play this CD over and over again. Not quite my taste. I gave it to a friend of mine and she LOVES it. She does play it over and over. I think she intends to buy a few of Lana's other CD's as well. So, the Good News is, My Friend LOVES this CD,as many other people will.
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I can't get into this at all. It was a big waste of my kindle money. Maybe the movie will be good if they don't follow the book.
B005HS00V4|2.0|I feel bad to give a bad review to a piece of high art. They obviously put a lot of effort into it, and the recording and video are both excellent.<br /><br />But, to me this was simply a self-indulgent, even nerdy, twist on pop music. If you are expecting the nice melodies of your favorite Gabriel songs, forget it. The songs that you know that are in the concert are so heavily rearranged you will hardly recognize them. And everything is down tempo. Boring, unless you are doing your masters in music theory perhaps.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I didn't think I would finish reading this book. It's written in a diary format that is well different ...almost strange...and way to much young love not my typical read. It was a decent story line though
B009MO57H6|5.0|Top stuff one of best of all lots of action and no stop all the way been waiting for this so not disappointed get it if u like the rest
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Loved being able to watch episode after episode!!!  It's like being at the movies but in my bed all compfy ! :)
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This was one of those really enjoyable books that gave me a few chuckles along the way. Cute sweet story.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Good for one that enjoys fantasy. It was suspensful, but certainly out of the ordinary plot. It kept me reading, but seemed like it was not a productive read.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It was a super fun for a while, then it completely started me over. I mean the game itself started from the beginning again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|the game is really cool but where is the best part the creepers. I built like a 1000 story building just for nothing.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Absolutely fabulous - the quartete rendition of  &#34;Bring him home&#34; as stirring.  Alfie Boe has an amazingly powerful voice.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone

B00030DEQE|5.0|Installs easily, readily recognized by windows 7. Works great. Glad I purchased it as I now have an upgraded network without a high cost.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I just love all of Mitch Albom's book. They are short reads but that makes it even better for me. I hope you enjoy it.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Non stop action filled with enough drama to keep the pages turning. I enjoyed reading this 3rd installment of the series from the very beginning down to the last word on the last past. A great read and in my opinion the best of the three!!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|It is simply a bad movie. Boring and predictable plot full of bloody violence. It is not worth a rental.

1451695195|4.0|I bought one for myself & one for a gift.  This book ended up being a &#34;pay it forward&#34; book (keep passing it around for the next person to read).  I saw this Dr.'s interview on the Oprah show, and was extremly intrigued for the simple fact that he believed such a thing as a near death experience was never possible due to his extensive Neurological studies and background.  The book was an excellent read and ended with the final proof.  I already knew what the proof was when I bought the book, but the book didnt expand on it & explain it well at the end like he did on TV, which was the best part.  For this I gave it 4 stars.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I love this case for my kindle.  Beautiful color, very functional, sets up nicely to stand the kindle for easy reading or movie watching.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Well written screenplay with a non-stop action. Liam Neeson plays very well.<br />I highly recomend this movie, I will watch Taken 2 tonight.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I couldn't get this app to work right I even tried deleting it and installed it again and that didn't work. I was really looking forward to using it in Bible Study.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Different than the movie, but very interesting!!!loved it!!!! The characters were more in depth. I liked it better than the movie
B00APUQT7I|4.0|worked fine, good quality imaging. Just took awhile to upload. The colors were brilliant, and the sound was clear. Thank you!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I played Journey and it definitively amazed me. No need for high end graphics and special effects, this amazing story is told from the player's perspective and the end was just amazing. Thanks to that game company for this excellent and beautiful game.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|My husband ordered this for me.  It's a great movie.  We have already watched it several times and recommend it to friends.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|Nice package of all the new batman movies, what i love about it the most is that it came with a booklet with pictures showing the making of the movies ( not much though )
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This is the most informative dictionary I've ever read. Why it's even more interesting than the Webster Dictionaries... I love the fact that it has it's share of modern words but alas it doesn't have enough.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I rarely watch a movie twice, but I made an exception for I Am Number Four.  I recommend it and look forward to future sequels or prequels.<br />The acting was top notch for all the characters. Well done!

1451627297|4.0|This novel combines some of my favorite things -- which I never really expected to see together: time travel, Stephen King, and lofty liberal idealism. After seeing this novel in several shop windows of the city where I'm living in the Czech Republic (we still have lots of bookstores here), I knew I had to read it, and soon.<br /><br />In general, I was happy. This book kept me up way past my bedtime most nights, and my daily tram commute suddenly was never long enough. King's a great storyteller, and he's in fine form here. His first-person narrator is well-rounded and likable, the time-travel setup is fun and thought-provoking, and King's imagining of the Oswalds is fascinating. As someone who lived in Dallas for a few years, I also thought he captured the creepiness of Dealey Plaza perfectly.<br /><br />There are flaws, of course. Some are minor (for example, why does a 35-year-old from 2011 know so many obscure '50s musical acts?). Others are more bothersome. I won't spoil, but there's an action-movie-style sequence near the end that to me seemed out of place and almost cartoonish after the more thoughtful and psychological suspense of the first 80% of the book. As with many King novels, the end is not the high point. For me, though, the biggest problem was a particularly gruesome bit of violence about halfway through. Of course, you expect violence in a novel like this, but there's one scene that was just a little too much (I thought), and it's talked about endlessly afterward. You'll know it when you get to it.<br /><br />Still, I'm really glad I picked this up. I think it's cool that an author I loved when I was 13 is still cranking out great stuff. Oh, and an extra bonus is the afterward, where King describes his research into the assassination and how he first started thinking about this story back in the 70s. Definitely worth checking out.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It's book is absolutely amazing!!! I laughed out loud at times, shed a tear a few times and couldn't get my blood pressure back to a normal state towards the end of the book. I don't know if I can wait till April for Walking Disaster to come out! I will probably have rad this one at least once if not two more times!! LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!
034580404X|5.0|I bought the whole series together...Everyone was talking about it at work so I wanted to see what the hype was!<br />I kept hearing &#34;Mommy Porn&#34; but I read nothing pronographic...It is a good love story! Betther than some of those other boy meets girl stories I have read, and the writer made characters I could like...Which is great too!<br />After reading the back of the final book, I am so hoping she decides to release the first book from Christains point of view!!
B007THA4FI|4.0|Takes a bit to get into it, but turns into a great book. By the end you have a bunch of characters that you feel you know.

B00992CF6W|2.0|This game is expensive as far as tablet games go. I would not expect a game with so little content to cost so much. I never played Minecraft before I got this app, and I was hoping it would be as fun as some of the other games I have played on the tablet. It was not even close.<br /><br />First of all, there is practically no point to the game. I thought that this game would be set in a vast world, but it really only takes place in a medium-sized land. Also, the monsters are easy to beat, except for the creeper. Seriously, the creeper are really annoying.<br /><br />I also experienced a glitch where, after a Creeper blew up my house, almost all of my world was covered in water. I have also noticed that the monsters also mostly stay in the day time. It is also worth noting that I could not get multiplayer to work. I do not know if it is just a bug in the game, or something I am doing.<br /><br />With all that being said, Minecraft is an alright game, just not for the price the developers want. Unless you absolutely love Minecraft, I suggest getting Block Story instead.

1932100660|5.0|The American diet is high in animal protein. The effect is disease, chronic illness, and early death. I recommend anyone who is dealing with disease or knows someone who is, should read this book.<br />The message of the book is \\"eat a whole food, plant-based diet.\\" This means: stay away from animal products (meat, dairy, eggs) as well as processed foods and sugar. The big businesses of meat, dairy, egg, and pharmaceutical industries do NOT want you to follow this message because they will lose profits.<br />There is a heavy reliance on \\"studies\\" in the medical field. Campbell shares an insider's view of medical research world. \\"There aren't enough studies done\\" is a common criticism for plant-based diet...yet, who funds these studies? Government. Who approves the funding? Elected officials. Who funds elected officials? Big businesses. It is not cost effective to promote \\"eat more spinach America\\" because it doesn't make businesses rich.  There is a huge conflict of interest between researchers and the industries that financially back them. A whole foods, plant-based diet is the medicine that Campbell is prescribing. Honestly, what is the harm in eating a lot of plant-based foods?<br />The most cost effective medical advice you can follow is: \\"eat a whole foods, plant-based diet.\\"  Obesity, diabetes, heart disease are all strongly connected to poor diet. Affluent countries eat more animal protein and have more (expensive) diseases.<br />The book provides a lot of research to back the value of a whole foods, plant-based diet.<br />Highlights:<br />*In our body, nutrition is the environmental factor that determines the activity of the genes.<br />*Nutrition will determine whether the disease will ever do damage.<br />* Doctors aren't sufficiently trained in nutrition (which is why you aren't hearing this advice from them). Drugs and surgeries are the \\"go-to\\" solution. Meanwhile, healthcare costs are rising and people can't afford insurance.<br />*Be your own advocate and stop blindly trusting the medical industry that will tell you to pop a pill that you can't afford to keep taking forever.and stop blindly trusting the medical industry that will tell you to pop a pill that you can't afford to keep taking forever.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I haven't played this much on my Kindle Fire.  I've seen other versions for the computer that I would like better.
B00ARF92HK|4.0|This movie was a pleasure to see. It is a good break from the usual dramatic dribble that seems to keep being remade. There was no pointless romantic story to make you lose interest. It is just a straight up action movie with lots of one liners and explosions. The way it should be. The only reason I don't give it five stars is because I wish it were longer.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Got this for my grandson and he has really enjoyed it.  Waiting for the &#34;new&#34; to wear off so Grandpa can try it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I didn't think I would like this show but was pleasantly surprised to find I liked it a lot.  The two main characters (Watson and Sherlock) were exellently cast and it works.  The premise is Sherlock is a brilliant man who had worked as a consultant with the police in solving crimes but looses the woman he loves to a serial killer, which drives him into drug use.  His father is wealthy and puts him into rehab.  When he is released his father pays for a companion to see he attends meetings and eats properly, etc.  Watson was a surgeon who kills someone on the operating table and thus leaves her profession.  She is intriqued by Sherlock's ability to see things at a crime scene that others do not.  She finds herself excited about solving crimes.  The first glimmer of interest for her since her exit from surgery.  Lots of chemistry between the two.  The police chief is well cast and his character appreciates Sherlock's abilities and makes allowances for his excentric behaviors.  Check out this show.  I'm praying it's not canceled as so many good, new shows are.  Highly recommended.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book. It actually really annoys u at some times bui a good way. Awesome read!!! I loved it

B00AMBLXP8|2.0|We thought we would like this movie as the commericals looked interesting.  For one thing there was way too much bad language and sexual situations with the bear.  We should have realized, because it was made by the same people as American Dan and I can't stand that show.  Guess I expected more in a movie and find it was even worse.  NOT recommended.

B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Yes, Bill, you have done it again.  I live in New Caledonia and have been to NSW a few times and know I'll never get further into Australia, due to lack of time.  This book transported me to those places I shall not visit and it will transport anyone else too, even if you live on the other side of the planet.  Funny, of course, as always, but packed with historical facts and anecdotes, Bill Bryson has also done his homework.  Fascinating and sensitive, the characters he meets (I assume they were or are real) are described so beautifully that I feel I can reach out and shake their hands.  A book for everyone, even if you think you have no interest in this particular continent,  you'll be hooked after page 2.

B00846REIS|5.0|After reading the Fifty Shades trilogy I was looking for a good read. Bared to You definitely did not disappoint! The characters, Eva and Gideon, as well as the story, enraptured me from the first couple of pages. I still can't decide which series I like better! I am SO looking forward to the third installment of this series! I highly recommend these books to those that enjoy this genre of writing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Much like the link between the Star Wars original trilogy, Catching Fire, is the best of the three.  Truly building character in the heroes and the antagonists.  Forcing the issues of morality, love and sacrifice.  Very good read.

B002TLSSXO|2.0|I got them on sale, but normally strangely expensive. The grey part is heat-resistant, but the colored part is not. They will not rest on the counter (work as advertised), but may still drip on the counter. I do not dislike them, but I do not think I would buy them again.
076790592X|5.0|Great!
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|This movie is one of the best combination of comedy & a love story. the chemistry between the two characters is full of life and love. Harold is obsessed with death & Maude is obessed with life. They both learn from each other. Very touching movie. it has been my favorite movie since I was a teenager. I still watch it a couple of times a month because I love it so much.

B004X75RK4|5.0|I LOVE THE Movie, It was both Funny and Romantic .<br />And I love all of Sandra Bullock.movies Great non violent movie.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I get that a wallflower is one who watches from the sidelines and rarely participates, but this kid wasn't a wallflower. The character came off as emotionally stunted, as if he has Asperger' s. So he's a voracious reader, so he can select songs to match a mood, so he makes straight A's...none of this makes the character intelligent. The letters were juvenile, simplistically written, the sentence structure annoyingly simple, that his \\"intelligence\\" didn't come through. Every character in the book experienced sexual molestation or physical abuse that it stopped being shocking and became obnoxiously overused. I wanted to read this book because the movie looked interesting, and I guarantee this story does tell better in movie format, and I thought I would read it before I let my teen daughter read it so that we could see the movie together. But no way would I let her read it. Drugs galore, intense drugs like LSD, glorifying drug use making it look cool. Promiscuous sex by all of the kids, and story lines of abortion, rape,  gay, racism, suicide, physical abuse, drug abuse....that the author took the theme of every book and movie he could find and put them in this one to show what the average teen angst is really like, but this was not reality to me. The 90's were a time of fantastic original musicians and the only thing the author could come up with was The Smiths and Nirvana? Really?! I wanted to like it, will most likely like the movie, but really didn't get the appeal of the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|outstanding. keep it up. writing is smart.  story line and characters just absorb you in to their lives. watch it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is a great collection of dvds and I chose this rating because of the fact that I love the show and love the dvds.  I would recommend it to all!!

B002RSDW8A|4.0|In the wrong hands, Julie & Julia could have been a pointless waste of time, but director Nora Ephron makes it work. The main reason is the casting, and the presence of Meryl Streep.<br /><br />If you have paid attention to Streep over the course of her career, you'll know that she is effective in serious dramas, comedy, and anything else she tries. Unlike many good actresses, she's different in every film. She becomes the character. That's true again in Julie & Julia as she transforms herself into Julia Child. You might find her character's voice a bit annoying, but it's incredibly close to the voice of the real Julia Child. The film works because she will make you care whether she achieves her ambition to get her book published.<br /><br />Amy Adams teamed up with Streep in Doubt, and the contrast between the two characters worked wonderfully. The two don't appear in any scenes together this time because the film is split into two stories. The first tells Julia's story, showing how she lived in Paris, took a cooking class, and ultimately wrote a book on the subject. The other story begins in New York in 2002, and shows how Julie Powell (Adams) seeks something to add meaning to her life. Her job is boring, and she lives in a small apartment in Queens, located above a Pizzeria.<br /><br />Julie's life changes when husband Eric (Messina) encourages her to begin a blog. She eventually comes up with the idea of writing about cooking, and vows to make 524 recipes from Julia's cookbook over the course of a year. If any of you have a blog of your own, you'll identify with Julie in this segment. It shows her writing every day, wondering if anyone is actually reading. She's desperate for comments and feedback of any kind, and wonders if the effort is worth it. Although her main goal is to give her something to do, she's hoping for recognition, and possibly more. She's already written a novel, but nobody wants to publish it. Can she turn her project into a commercial success?<br /><br />One thing the film does well is establish its characters. They are complex human beings, and we feel as if we know them after two hours. Both women have supportive partners, and I particularly love the relationship between Julia and her husband, Paul (Tucci). It looks like the two actors have been married to each other for years. It's clear that Paul played a significant role in Julia's success, inspiring her to try new things and stick with her plan to write a book. Julie and Eric are also in a believable relationship. You can see how society has changed over the past few decades; Julie and Eric both work, while Paul supports Julia financially, allowing her time to explore other things.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of situational humor in the film, and it works well without seeming forced. My favorite Julia scene involves onions, and Paul's reaction to her competitive nature. As for Julie, the placement of Talking Heads' Psycho Killer when she's cooking lobsters is just about perfect.<br /><br />Julie & Julia turned out to be Nora Ephron's last film, and it's a good one. Streep's Oscar nomination was deserved, and the other main characters all play their parts well. This is the kind of film that will keep you smiling, and it has plenty of replay value. Maybe it will help you discover your own purpose in life, or at least explain why you keep working on your blog??<br /><br />One thing the film does well is establish its characters.

B00A8V3VVG|2.0|Don't get me wrong, there are some cool songs on the soundtrack, but too many are missing, such as the ones by Johnny Cash and RZA, not to mention there are tracks that were edited out of the movie, such as Big Daddy's \\"Horse Faces and Gummy Mouth Bitches\\"

B00APUQJLO|1.0|Virtually every line Pattinson, has in this movie is an esoteric and generalized portrayal of labored intellectualism. That sort of dialogue was cool in Fight Club, not here. The ONLY life this film had was Giamatti's scene. Almost from the start, this film just made me wish that it would be over.
B0047VSW30|5.0|Very informative of the time period. Very interesting so little was known about the universe. Religuon and the place that held in society at that time.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Everyone says &quot;You need to pay two more dollars for the full game&quot;. The Path of the Jedi is a BONUS level pack! It has nothing to do with the story at all!

B0083Z614S|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book which appeared at first to be a cautionary tale.  It turned however into a wonderfully uplifting example of the difference that positive thought and healthy actions outside in the fresh air can do.  I know it's a classic but this is my first time reading it.  It has affected my way of thinking, just having read it, for the better.
B000W1VDEY|4.0|Like a lot of Rush fans out there, I'm so pleased our all time favorite rock and roll band is still putting out good music. Clockwork Angels is their best in years! So, sophisticated fan that I am, (lol)  I thought I was way beyond their first album.<br /><br />Haven't listened to the this album all the way through in, say, 30 years, but it STILL ROCKS!!!!!! By the time I got to \\"In the Mood\\" I was dancing around the living room, like I was Geddy, screaming the timeless chorus \\"Hey baby, It's a quarter to eight,  I feel I'm in the mood\\".  My wife, who is not a fan, thinks I am retarded....<br /><br />This album is why I started listening to rock! I was maybe, like, 9 when I heard this album in my older brother's room for the first time (I'm 46) and I can remember being blown away by Rush and of course, 2112.<br /><br />If you don't have the lifelong fandom history this is still an awesome album! Best five bucks I've spent in months!

1451613512|3.0|I like this book, but cannot recommend it without urging the reader to a state of cautious alertness.  The book begins with a well summarized exposition of America's hidden agenda of empire.  Yet in the pages that follow, I get the feeling that the casts of characters and motives identified are suspiciously incomplete.<br /><br />In this regard, the first chapter, on Woodrow Wilson and America's entry into World War I, is a prime example.  The book notes that the American people thought and expected Wilson to keep the country out of the European war.  Yet, according to these authors, Wilson's culture of thinking and morals was the odd combination Southern Presbyterian and British intellectualism.  The implication being that Wilson had an emotional allegiance to England.  Perhaps this is so, but I am unconvinced.<br /><br />A more satisfying explanation is that Wilson was blackmailed by Zionists, who had bargained with British Lord Balfour to be given Palestine in exchange for coercing America's entry into the War on the side of England and her allies.  The problem with this explanation is that there are so few documents available to historians to prove such a conspiracy.<br /><br />Thus the book raises questions of \\"What is history?\\" and \\"Can we really know the truth?\\"  Is history what historians can prove via primary sources (documents, films, audio recordings), or is it an attempted portrayal of what actually happened.  Reliance on official records and diaries opens the door to forgeries and deliberate disinformation.  Attempting to arrange circumstantial evidence results in a bewildering variety of incompatible explanations which often fall even further from the ring of truth.<br /><br />These difficulties aside, the authors present a compendium of too little known facts to demolish the staid mythology of a righteous, divinely ordained democracy, serving as a beacon to liberate all mankind.  Rather, we are a nation of fools, hoodwinked with the most primitive propaganda, into advancing just another evil empire whose time had come and is now slowly diminishing into the dust pile of history.<br /><br />So, if you choose to read this book, or any other modern history book, or watch the DVD of the same name, be aware that this certainly is not a completely accurate or honest portrayal of what happened.  It may be close in many areas, but without knowing the full cast of actors on the world stage, misrepresentation is unavoidable.  Let the reader beware.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It had so many different games to try out that it's difficult to get too bored. The only thing is that it'll take forever to unlock everything.

1593083246|5.0|Enjoyed this more thoroughly than expected. This is a story about the potential damage or fortune derived from preconceived societal notions. This is a story about standing up to social conventions in an age where such a concept was unthinkable, not to mention before its time. Taken slowly, poetically and whimsically, the human drama in this book is deeply touching, and can be appreciated by every culture on the globe.<br /><br />There are 5thousand reviews here, so I won't go into further detail, but rest assured, it's a CLASSIC and it's worth a read.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I wanted to start a podcast with a co-host which makes USB mics kind of a tricky thing to use. This is the perfect option if you're doing a two person podcast or doing interviews. Two standard analog mics plug into the bottom, switch to mono, and a decent MP3 format and you're good to go!<br /><br />Also, just as a side note, I think it might be better to record directly to the ZOOM if you're doing a long podcast, because if Sound Forge or Audacity crashes and you've been recording for 30 minutes you'll lose everything. The ZOOM is a dedicated piece of hardware and is a safer option in my opinion.

B007TK77QE|4.0|JKR did it for me. This book conveys several hard and uncomfortable social messages at different levels, but the delivery tone is light and witty - an irresistable combination. I especially enjoyed the richness of the characters which  provides an often disturbing  glimpse into life in small town Brittain - it reminded me of John Steinbeck's Cannery Row. Read it.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Not as difficult, at least for me, as 'Cut the Rope' and as a result more relaxing.  Don't get me wrong I really like 'Cut the Rope, but I find it requires a little more of my brain than this game!

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This wouldn't normally be a movie for me - I usually find comedy dumbed down, boring and predictable, and I really detest Glee or anything of that nature - but this movie had enough character and fully funny adult one-liners to keep me going. Even my husband thought it was hilarious!
B00001OH7T|5.0|Simply stated this is the Bowie Soul album...many of those Glam heads reviewing this disc  simply dont understand this,although they all seem to love it! Soul legend Luther Vandross(how many of those Glam Head reviewers even own a Vandross record?...dig where I'm coming from?) was a member of Bowie's backround touring/studio ensemble during this period and even contributed to song writing with Bowie,...enough said!..it's Funky spectacular.
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This app is great. Smooth graphics, challenging levels, origenal platform style... It is a great idea backed by well funded, experienced programers.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Jeremy Renner did a decent job but except for a few scenes I kept expecting the action to get better but no cigar. Look you either have a suspenseful movie where you the viewer are trying to figure out what going to happen or you have action or better yet a mix of both. Sadly, this movie was flat and very easy to predict. Good acting, bad plot, and even worse bad direction. Wait for it on cable.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book Thief deserves the highest rating possible! I was totally captured by Liesel's life during wartime Germany.  Markus Zusak accurately describes the atmosphere of the time, cleverly using the character of &#34;Death&#34; to narrate the story.<br /><br />I especially loved Hans,(Liesel's adopted father), Rudy, (Liesel's friend),  and Max, (the kind and caring Jewish man hidden in the basement). The atmosphere of war and prejudice was carefully and accurately narrated. I especially liked how cleverly Markus Zusak interjected humor into this story.<br /><br />The book captured my attention, especially since I personally spent close to three years in Germany (16 years post war). I appreciate Markus Zusak's effort with translation of the German language. I recalled a great deal of the language I thought I had forgotten.<br /><br />I have read this book twice, and probably will read it again. I  would recommend this book to young adults as well as adults.

1451696191|3.0|I watched the movie first, and absolutely fell in love with Charlie's character. I figured I should read the book since its always said that the book is better. Unfortunately that's not the case with this book. I felt so much more from each character in the movie. While I was reading the book I realized I wouldn't have enjoyed it much at all had I not saw the movie. I recommend watching the movie.

030758836X|3.0|I did not like this book. If I could I would give it 2.5 stars, the extra .5 for the last part of the book being somewhat funny. I always round up my reviews, because I am cool like that.<br /><br />Nick doesn't like women, or people with money and he's kind of a douche who cheats on his wife (once, granted for more than a year). Amy is a sociopath who accuses people of all sorts of things like stalking, rape, molestation and she doesn't seem to like men. Amy sets up Nick for murder to make him pay for cheating on her. (not really a spoiler, by page 24 of the hard back it was obvious this was a set up)<br /><br />The good:<br />* Not much, honestly. Nothing stands out as being \\"good\\" I enjoyed Nick's entries, I related to him more than Amy. But even he got annoying.<br />* \\"Real\\" Amy was funny at times, especially right before the end.<br /><br />The bad:<br />* I am not a prude (one of my favorite books is American Psycho, so I can deal with \\"bad guys\\") but some of the \\"offensive\\" language was used to the point where it was boring. I am sure Amy talking about anal sex was supposed to sound edgy, but the way it was written made her sound uneducated. Same thing with Nick.<br />* This book was boring at times and easy for me to get distracted. I forced myself to finish it.<br />* There are some issues with Amy's Master Plan. The FBI can tell when I diary was produced and put on sale, also they can tell how old ink is and how long it's been since something was written.<br />* I didn't like or care about most people in the book. I could have liked Nick more, but for some reason I felt him lacking.<br />* I think I would have liked this better if it were from Nick's POV.<br />* Twists should be done carefully. Not just to have a twist. Have we learned nothing from M. Night Shyamalan?<br /><br />What really breaks my heart about this book is that there was a lot of potential. It could have been a great book.<br /><br />I plan on trying to read this book a year from now, to see if my opinion has changed.<br /><br />I bought her two other books at the same time I ordered this one. I amo see if my opinion has changed.<br /><br />I bought her two other books at the same time I ordered this one. I am

0316228532|5.0|I grew up reading Harry Potter and when my 19 year old self discovered that J.K. Rowling wrote another book, I knew right then and there that I must read the The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />First and for most, I applaud the rawness and the grittiness that this book contained.<br /><br />I easy attached myself to characters and situations and found my self on the edge with suspense with every page. J.K. Rowling masterfully described the good and bad things about children, teens, adults, and entire villages; how a little selfishness can affect everyone; and how, usually, tragedy is sadly the wake up call for people to open their eyes and begin thinking about others.<br /><br />The book is dramatic, like I suppose a sophisticated soap opera and is definitely not light reading, nor is the easiest read. It is dark, dismal, and endearing. The things that take place in this book may not be the happiest but are life altering situations in which began with the death of just one person.<br /><br />Do not expect this book to be anything like Harry Potter, it might even help to pretend this book was not written by J.K. Rowling.
B005IQZB14|3.0|It's a nice memoir of a  woman &#34;finding herself&#34; but nothing profound.  The trip made her healthy again and able to move on and those are the important outcomes.  Well written and easy to read.

0547848412|5.0|I've come to this book (gathering dust on my bookshelf) more than 10 years after its original publication date & the time it won the Booker. Reviewing it here is more a matter of creating a record for my thoughts on the book, rather than adding to the discussion which I haven't even followed carefully as (at the time of writing) there are more than 3,000 reviews, favourable or not, of Life of Pi on Amazon. Exhausting to even look through and think about them, let alone read them!<br /><br />So: this is a striking, thoroughly engaging book, one of those `unputdownable' books that one comes across once in a while. The story is well known so I won't go into too many details: the first part of the book explores the life of an adolescent boy, Pi (short for Piscine) in his native India. His peculiar involvement in 3 different religions- Christianity, Islam & Hinduism- becomes the focus of this section, as does his life amongst his father's zoo animals.<br />The descriptions of how zoo animals live, together with humans who live near them and look after them, were charming and so thought-provoking. Some of Pi's thoughts, e.g. regarding the illusion of freedom as being necessarily the best life condition for animals, were captivating & deliciously written:<br />Martel writes: 'Animals in the wild lead lives of compulsion and necessity within an unforgiving social hierarchy in an environment where the supply of fear is high and the supply of food low and where territory must constantly be defended and parasites forever endured. What is the meaning of freedom in such a context?... If a man, boldest and most intelligent of creatures, won't wonder from place to place, a stranger to all, beholden to none, why would an animal, which is by temperament far more conservative?' There are many more such passages, demystifying life in a zoo, showing its civilised and nurturing nature, and proving the falsity of the idealised reverence of 'nature' (which happens to be one of my pet hates, particularly when it comes to 'natural motherhood': but that's another discussion!) Martel (through Pi) shows us, through the striking fictional world he creates, something about the utter randomness of nature, its neutrality in terms of good and bad, and the necessity for human reason and science when it comes to surviving within nature.<br /><br />This point about nature's arbitrariness is made brutally clear in the second part of the book- which is by far the longest. Here, adolescent Pi & his family go on board a cargo ship, together with their zoo animals which will end up in several US zoos, heading to Canada for a new life. The ship abruptly and inexplicably sinks, and Pi is the sole survivor. In circumstances that seem far-fetched but make absolute sense when the reader allows himself to follow the story, Pi ends up on a lifeboat together with a Bengal tiger (Richard Parker), an orang-utan, a hyena & a zebra. The animals perish one by one, in conditions that I won't reveal, and Pi eventually remains on board the tiny lifeboat with only Richard Parker. Pi passes the time by finding ingenious ways to survive, one of them being to gradually tame the tiger, becoming the alpha male in the lifeboat with the tiger deferring to him. And the tiger, on his part, again in ways I won't go into, keeps Pi alive, focused and relatively positive (although not always) in an otherwise endless, mindless, desperate journey in the Pacific.<br />This is an extraordinary- and sometimes viciously, brutally described, in all gory detail- story of survival: one boy and a tiger against the harsh elements of nature, completely reliant on luck and on the boy's strength of mind to keep them alive.<br /><br />There's a short third section which I won't refer to in any detail as I believe it's a spoiler to discuss it. Suffice to say that this section offers the reader lots of food for thought regarding what has already transpired...<br /><br />Ah, just to add the most important thing: The Life of Pi, apart from being thought provoking and extremely smart in the way it's structured and written, makes for a delightful read that flows beautifully. Bravo to the author!

1401937519|5.0|I heard Dr. Wayne Dyer mention this book. He also wrote the foreword for it.<br /><br />The book starts out with the author telling about the day she died. She wasn't dead like no hart beat, she was in a coma. She talks about being aware of everything around her.<br /><br />The book then moves on to her telling the reader what she and her life were like growing up.<br /><br />She discusses the different religious paths the ventured down.<br /><br />I love the honesty in the chapter entitled \\"Matchmaking Missteps\\". She was brave enough to follow her heart even thought knowing it would disappoint everyone around her.<br /><br />She goes on to tell us of how she met her husband which is her true love.<br /><br />You really get an idea of who the author is by her sharing so much of her life with us.<br /><br />She describes the time of her cancer diagnosis after finding a lump on her right shoulder, which was followed by a range of emotions.<br /><br />The second part of the book talks about her leaving the world behind. I loved her description of her near-death experience. She goes on to discuss her healing and when she was given the all clear from cancer. Experts say she should have been dead.<br /><br />I love how she describes seeing her life with new eyes, finding her new path (beginning).<br /><br />Part III of the book, she tells us what she has come to understand from all that has happened to her. I love the self-examination she shares with the reader, why she got sick and healed. She goes on to tell us of our Infinite Selves and Universal Energy.<br /><br />Chapter 17 \\"Allowing and Being Yourself\\" is, in my opinion, the most important chapter in the book.<br /><br />I absolutely love the last chapter \\"Questions & Answers\\".  If you have any questions, chances are you will find the answer here.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend it.

It's a solid action movie and he can still be a leading man.  The writing and the action all come together to make this one of Mel's better efforts.  I'd watch it again for the strong performances and characters.

B005K17RU0|5.0|My husband suggested this product to me so we downloaded it and I have to say I use it all the time.  Great product!
B0076DELIG|4.0|This was one of the better Harry Bosch stories. It was very in depth; gripping and had some current events included that were interesting. I was worried that connelly was going to kill off Harry, as several other crime writers have done to main characters. I liked the way it ended.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|An interesting story, but I was expecting more.  No big dramatic scene with a game changing turnaround.  Grisham admits that not much research went into this and I agree.
B00028HBKC|5.0|the truth as I know it, I cry everytime I watch this movie, great doing business with saler, was fast.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was simply amazing. Once it really got started I was able to put the book down! I absolutely loved the story even if it wasn't all nice and happy. It was real.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I've read all the Harry Hole books and found this one of the more depressing. The girlfriend's son seemed to come out of no where and it seemed unbelievable that he would take up the lifestyle he did with such a loving mother. What is Nesbo going to do to follow this one?
B008M721MS|5.0|got my kindle fire hd for christmas from my daughter and family. I have a lot to learn but i am willing.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Ellen is a very funny person on her TV show with her stream of consciousness stand up routine. Her book is a continuation of that. I thought it was an amusing read.
B009VB7QQA|5.0|Great movie the whole family enjoyed great picture quality. may buy and add to my collection soon, lots of fun.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|What a great show this turned out to be.  Great acting by both of the main characters.  I heard one was up for an award for this series.  The first episode left me with some doubt but then 2,3 etc... I was hooked.  It became my most anticipated show in TV.  I cannot wait for season 2.  I will buy it outright and not miss a beat.
B007W1BLN0|1.0|Slow, irrelevant, depressing.  I can't believe i even spent 2.99 and wasted an evening. A wasted life that left a trail of pain.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I like this version but it's not as good as the one I play on my laptop,don't know why though. I do like the extra options but I would prefer a different background.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Bought this too but never got it on my kindle fire, does angry birds star wars work on kindle fire???????????????????
B004SBQGHS|5.0|It's so nice to have this one without the ads. I've heard people complain about the extras costing money, but I don't mind it. If I'm interested, fine, I'll pay. If not, there's other things I can do with my time. SERIOUSLY. These devs worked hard to port the game to Android. Because Android devices vary widely in terms of quality and reliability, I'm sure they have to have several devices ready anytime an Android version of any app is made.<br /><br />As for the game, it does one thing perfectly for me. Yes, it's a great time waster. There. I said it. That's all it is to me, though a very entertaining one. I got my money's worth. :)<br /><br />The whiners need to go get a life. ;)
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|Not sure what I expected.  Certainly not a musical.  And a really bad one to boot.  That says it all.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Grissom writes very well and keeps you reading by changing each chapter from another characters perspective.  Hard to put the book down.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this app is very cute and perfect for bronys like me BUT the sins out-weigh the good things. I'm sorry game loft. but now your getting desperate. its shame full and very dissapointing.:(
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|I can take it anywhere. Would be great to have on a tablet. CPU opponent is fine (esp. at the highest level), but 2 human players would be more fun. Do I need to say more?
B007ZD17XO|5.0|It's another gem matching game, but very addictive.  I will play far longer than I should.  I have won twice now and am going back for more.  There are tons of these kinds of games out there.  I play this one on my new Kindle Fire HD and it is big, bright, and easy to play - not to win, but to play.<br /><br />Give it a try, if you have the time to be addicted to such things.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|When I got the Kindle Fire for Christmas I wanted to find a way to watch YouTube other than having to access the website through the browser.  I did some research and came across TubeMate.  It isn't a perfect program and it does have its flaws, but if you have a Kindle Fire HD, you need this app.  I have read several reviews where people were uncertain about how to download, but it's simple in that you just tap the green arrow and a screen pops up asking you what quality you want your video in.  Now I have ES File Explorer, so it is very easy for me to go into my video file and manage the downloads.  If you haven't put a file program on your Kindle Fire then I highly recommend using one if you use TubeMate and I highly recommend using ES File Explorer.<br /><br />Now to the glitches I've encountered with this program.  Glitches that if fixed I would gladly revise this review to be a full 5 stars.<br /><br />-If you use the app heavily then at a certain point it seems to glitch and it'll force close.  Then when you go back into the app you can play a single video, but as soon as you go to play another it will force close again.  The only way I've found to reset the app is to shut down the kindle then reboot it.  Once you go back into the app then it works as good as new.  That is until you overuse it again and the cycle starts all over again.  It's a minor thing, but it can get annoying.<br /><br />-Sometimes when you load a video it'll lag for a moment and given my somewhat slow internet connection at home it sometimes takes a while to buffer.  So if you try and back out of the video while it's buffering it'll keep trying to load in the background and playing with no way to stop it.  The only solution I've found to stop that is to quickly load another video and hope that video doesn't glitch like the prior one.  Again, not a deal breaker as it has a fix, but it can be annoying.<br /><br />Edit: Found out, by complete accident, that if you run across a video not authorized for mobile viewing you can actually download the video and still be able to watch it on your Kindle Fire HD.  Just go into the video you want to watch and let it try to load.  A warning will popup saying that the video was not authorized for mobile viewing and it will take you to a screen where it tells you to login so you can send a reminder to yourself to watch it on a computer.  Simply hit the back button and it'll take you back to the TubeMate video screen with a still image of the video you wanted to watch.  The green arrow should still be available on the screen like any other video so once you click on that it will ask you to select a video quality.  Let it download and in a couple minutes you'll be able to watch it.  I don't know that it works on every non-mobile video, but the handful I've tried it with so far have worked.  This feature alone makes up for most of the above mentioned glitches and if Amazon would let me give half stars I would upgrade my review to 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Overall this is a great app with some quirks.  It allows you to search just like the YouTube app, but some videos you won't be able to watch if the user didn't make them available to mobile devices (see above edit since original review).  With that said I have the same issue with the official YouTube app on my phone, so don't be surprised if you run across some videos you can't watch.  I highly recommend this app for all Kindle Fire HD users, but be prepared for the occasional glitch.  It isn't perfect, but I've come to prefer it over the Official YouTube app on my phone.
0812993357|5.0|I just finished this book. I am a little outraged with myself at almost believing the discouraging review here on Amazon that Coddington was not a great writer. Like thats been her job in life! And thats why I gave it the benefit of the doubt and bought it. I actually bought the book because I figured it would be a beautiful, although heavy book, but thats because the paper is thick and sensous. The cover is bright orange to match her amazing hair.<br /><br />There are so many amazing things about this book. No, great writer she isnt but she was smart enough to find a great editor. She herself knows, if nothing else, when something is good and when it is mediocre so I am sure there were many exacting drafts. It was totally entertaining and if you love fashion and creativity and the life it generates then this is the book for you. I was transfixed and even found myself smiling if not laughing outloud. She is very charming.<br /><br />All of this is great but what struck me the very most was none of these things. The most important part of the book was to see the world she came from in the sixties and seventies and the eighties. Without being nostalgic I have to say that I was reminded of an art, a creative world, a cultural aesthetic world and the people who created it and how wholly devoted they were to it. Money was scarce, people were having a blast and what was considered the best was what people got. The best was driven by aesthetic value, not celebrity, social status or money, it was the work of someone who really cared about  creative integrity. I roll my eyes as I speak this phrase but there was a time where it did matter and it wasnt ironic and it was respected as the best work. Everyone working in any cultural field today especially under the age of 38 should read this book. Not a story of a better time, just a story of how art looks when it isnt being run by lots of money. When the art is at the top of the list of priority in how something is made.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved the journal-like way this story was presented. It worked really well in allowing the story to unfold.<br />Hard science, gripping plot. Sort of a one man \\"Apollo 13\\". Great read.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great strategy game.  Addictive too.  I can't stop playing it.  Trying to wipeout humanity is a little creepy but watching how the world would react is fun.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I ordered this dvd as a gift for my dad.  Iam like his personal assistant, so if he tells me he wants something I purchase it for him and send it to him, so when he requested this dvd of course I bought it for him.<br /><br />He told me that he really enjoyed this dvd.<br /><br />Not seeing this dvd for myself I cannot rate this with my opinion.<br /><br />Making my dad happy is the most important thing to me.<br /><br />Mission accomplished!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hated it it was pure trash, and I didn't finish it because there was no need, trash begets trash.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|I haven't quite finished this book yet but I have to be honest and admit I'm not loving it. The basic message seems to be a good one: \\"If you listen to your heart and follow your dreams the universe will help you to achieve them. In the face of obstacles have faith that everything will be okay.\\" To put a different slant on it though one review I just read pointed out that this book, in its celebration of rampant individualism can actually be compared to Atlas Shrugged. It's a very apt comparison.<br /><br />The writing is very simplistic with the same message being repeated over and over again. This book got such a huge build up and I was expecting something special but it didn't pull me in. Personally I prefer something a little more challenging that raises questions instead of claiming to have the answers.
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Cute movie the whole family can watch if you are just looking for entertainment. I guess perhaps shows science gone wild.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|I streamed this movie over amazon. The quality wasn't great on my laptop, but it worked. If you haven't seen FMJ and have ever been entertained by anything military, watch it. This was my third time watching it, so I can also say it is totally worth another watch or two if you've only seen it once.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like this game, but some quests make you find friends. Unless you know somebody who plays this game, it is not worth it to go go strangers' manners.<br />Other than that, this is a great game!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and wasn't embarrassed to watch it with a crowd of people with me. It had a great message and the characters weren't exaggerating their roles. I thought that many times the girl could and probably would have exploded in different ways but she kept her cool and did what rational people would do, I think.
0470601787|5.0|If you're on this page, it means you think your meetings suck, and you're looking for a way to make them better. This book will help you make them better. The only downside is that you'll find yourself actually attending MORE meetings, because you'll become so proficient at effectively running, participating in, or hijacking the leadership of ineffective meetings that everyone else will want you in their meetings.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Wow... I'm not a big reader but this series was amazing. I could only hope it continues. It had me on the edge of my seat from chapter 1, book 1
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Suzanne grabbed my attention from the first paragraph. This book took me on a true adventure. I highly recommend this book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I ALSO HAVE THIS GAME ON NINTENDO WII IT'S SO FUN EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME AT LEAST ONCE I BET THEY WILL LIKE IT!
B0043D2E0E|5.0|I've been a longtime fan of O'Reilly books, and they continue to please. As a semiprofessional web developer trained in the days of &#34;DHTML,&#34; I needed a resource to help navigate the way into HTML5. This book does a great job of mixing theory and practice.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Including this one. It entertains, informs, inspires and moves you. And keeps you up too late at night when you should be getting some sleep. But you'll still be sleeping better than Harry.
B008X6N1OA|4.0|fits with the series
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|IT UP THERE WITH ZYNGA'S FARMVILLE VERY ADDICTIVE ONCE YOU START PLAYING YOU NEVER GET BORED! IT IS HARD TO ADD FRIENDS IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT OR GAMELOFT ACCOUNT!
B00004RF9I|5.0|This movie is even more relevant today than in the 70s! Brilliant acting, brilliant storyline. Some classic classic lines that will live on in time.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|This is a really Cute album, I like almost every song on it, it's playful, sexy and strong all at the same time it reminds me of when I was a teenager in love
B0034G4P26|5.0|Enjoyed watching it.The plot was good, the cartooning was well done. The characters and voices were a great match. Glad I bought it. Shipping was fast and reasonable.
B009ME47H2|5.0|One of the best so far I like this app it records everything clearly I like how you record at any time!
0865479410|4.0|Well written, much needed different approach that is really helping me with my life, I done with the false happiness.
B004Y042N8|1.0|This looked like a lot of fun, but the instructions and directions are very weak. It could be much better if the developers would clearly offer some strong instructions and help, but right now, it's just not worth it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I got this set on Blu Ray and it's really nice to revisit at my leisure the whole series and progression and transformation of Batman through the eyes of Director Nolan. Nolan is a remarkable visionary and storyteller.<br /><br />I can't watch anyone else play Batman except for Bale, nor any other Batman storyteller except for Nolan. Oh yes, Ledger was excellently cast as the Joker and Hathaway is the most interesting (and hot) Catwoman. This is the ultimate collaboration. And I used &#34;ultimate&#34; correctly.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game cause 1 its free and 2 it has a ton of stuff!!!Whoever hates this game is..... STUPID!!!!' NOT 2 B RUDE Y'ALL! !!!
B00A80SHFM|1.0|I am VERY disappointed in the soundtrack. It does not contain my favorite song, Do You Hear the People Sing.  I will be returning the cd to the store, and do whatever I have to to make them take it back.  I should have read the song list, so obviously my fault, but nonetheless, I did not think for a moment they would leave out an entire song we all know. I've bought the cassette, back in the day, twice, and have a cd, which is well-played and seems to be skipping, so i bought the movie soundtrack.  I feel mislead, and will now just get the musical cast recording from the library to listen to, I don't feel like giving any more money.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. You are never sure what is going to happen. I loved the subplot love story between Peers and Katniss.
B000063WDH|4.0|One of the best rock bands out there, definitely look into their stuff if you like rock music.  This duo from Ohio have a great sound.  Improving vocals combined with a great sounding guitar and a drummer that pounds on the drums make this a must listen group.  I own all of their albums, and while this is not my favorite album of theirs, it is still good quality stuff for sure.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|I received an email a while back from Amazon stating this DVD would be released in the US on Jan. 15, 2013 so I pre-ordered it. What happened? Has anyone heard? I haven't had time to research what's going on with tha. But very frustrated since I have been waiting months for this release.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used this several times.  I put it on my Kindle so it is right there with all my other &#34;tools&#34;.  The screen is easy to read, the buttons are big and there is less likely chance of miss hits.  It even puts your equation under the answer so you can double check that you typed it in right....  I LOVE IT!!!!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Great book.  I have read the entire series.  I am in need of another Prendergast as I write this review.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|love that I can use this player to play videos that I have downloaded online on my Kindle.  This app makes the Kindle a more versatile tablet.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was enjoying this game a lot and would have given 5 stars. I have even spent real money on it. Now I don't play it because the developers got stupid. It's one thing to have the option to spend real money to advance and another to try and force people to buy if they want to advance the game in a decent time frame. The ice expansions were pretty expensive but to go from 800,000 directly to 15,000,000 with nothing in between is ridiculous!!! I now no longer play this game cuz it would take weeks to collect that money so now my play time became stagnant.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I never pictured my self as a kill the world and everyone in it sort of person, but when my husband down loaded this to my kindle I gave in a tried it.  It was supprisingly fun.  You might like it also..
B002H5JHUA|3.0|The story was just not as good as I was expecting and the acting was okay.  Definitely sticking with the classics like Indiana Jones!
B00003CX6P|5.0|Matt Damon should have won the Oscar.  Excellent movie.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Great book. Straight forward information. Just starting the program, confident it will work. As long as I put the work in :)
1250010403|5.0|Great book. Excellent condition. I will be really looking forward to getting the third book in the &#34;Clifton Chronicles. &#34;The Sins of the Father,&#34;
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This had intrigue, intelligence and aggression.  Reacher gets unsuspected bad news and just does what's right and needed throughout.  A reminder of Clint Eastwood as Josey Wales
6304458304|5.0|One of Clint Eastwood's best.  He is a favorite of mine.  Wonderful talents.  Too bad Eastwood is growing old with the rest of us.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was hooked to Downton Abbey from the very first season, and the third season is starting off great too. Never a disappointment.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|A musical based on Beatles tunes?  In Across The Universe, it works.  The songs are in synch with the plot, and the acting fits the tunes.  The second time I watched this DVD, I noticed many additional nuances in backdrops and story.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I have read all his work and this is one of his better works of late.  This was entertaining and an enjoyable read.
B0099114WO|1.0|This is a terrible movie.  Not to either of these actors credit.  Who ever produced or directed it should be chastised.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Easy to use, keep it in my favs and check it several times a day. Opens easy and its quick.
B008RYN44U|5.0|I've liked No Doubt for many years, not my fav band, but still I was able to enjoy some of their music. So, I was glad they reunited and after I purchased this CD for my husband, I was happy to see they've created an extraordinary album. Songs are not too pop neither too punk neither too hip hop, which I love. They've found a way to mix rhythms and make almost every song very melodic. I'm not an expert in music, but to me this is a positive change for No Doubt, which I would call a great evolution from past albums. They've been able to keep their style but it is much more mature. Well done No Doubt!
B004P91ARE|5.0|Jazz in my favorite genre of music and this is Mr Brubeck at his best! Wish I could have heard him live.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|Some liberties were taken when you contrast these feature wth the comic, but I for one accept the differences. When well done, as they are in this feature, they enhance the experience of a well known Batman tale.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my grandson, age 6, who is a Lego nut...he was so happy with this- he played with it all day Christmas day and is still carrying it around.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|The music here is nicely performed and recorded, and it does it's job of randomly taking a listener to places in the SKYFALL movie. But if you don't read the song list carefully before buying, you won't see that the movie's title song is not included. That's right - there is no rendition of \\"Skyfall\\" by Adelle on this disc. You have to hunt for the CD single which contains that one track.<br /><br />If this CD were a red Italian sports car, they would be selling it to you with only three wheels.
B003HARV98|5.0|My daughter has seen Marina and the Diamonds in concert and just loves them.  She has their newer album, but this is their first and harder to find.  She was very excited to get this as a gift.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Top notch thriller! The characters are well drawn, the plot is historically accurate and does a great job of evoking early 1950's Russia in the last days of Stalin. Enjoyed it so much I purchased a second book of the trilogy.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Good book love the storys i love to read more its great to read somethin humorius haha lol :) <3
B009Q6ADG0|3.0|I like the song. I like the music. But somehow this music got separated from the rest of the mood music from the SKYFALL movie.<br /><br />Better ratings, Hollywood, and better ratings, Record Company, after you stop pulling stunts like this!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I love this one - both ways - veritcal and horizontally. LIke the big buttons. It works great -<br />took a while to get used to avoiding the = sign , but like the fact I can see the equation while inputting it.<br />I'm glad I found this ap
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. Even if you've seen the movie I would reccomend you read the book before moving on to the second one. It gives you a way better idea of what goes on on Katniss mind than the movie, also yu understand better the situation they live and Peeta's feelings.<br /><br />I saw the movie first, then read the book and yet I was hanging on every chapter.
B00902AKK4|3.0|Tis is a cute little game .I liked  the music and the way the beetle just kept going. This is a good game if you want to relax and just chill.
B007V65R54|2.0|If you are a math major or into statistics you will love it. For the rest of us, its boring.
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|No issues with the streaming, but, as usual, it the video was hard to hear. We have a Samsung smart tv and the amazon prime app needs work. Also, amazon streaming search function needs improvements. It would be nice if it reccommend movies too.
0765325950|5.0|I have been reading this series for years and Robert Jordan created a fantastic world.  Brandon Sanderson, Thank You for finishing his work, you did a wonderful job.<br /><br />This Final volume brought everything together from across the series and culminated it with twists abound and tremendous, earth shaking battles.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This was an Xmas stocking stuffer for my wife. It's one of her favorite movies from her childhood. Bonus points for me.
B0000039Q3|5.0|It arrived quickly and in a hard package so there was no damage. Very happy to have this in my collection.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game on my phone and was thrilled to find it available on my kindle fire.  Even better on a larger screen.
0871164566|4.0|Very nice book. The instructions were easy to follow. The photographs showed the pendants in nice detail. These pendants would make great gifts.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game to take anywhere.  Time waiting in doctors offices has never gone quicker, just in time for flu season. :-(
B005F3DFXG|5.0|BBC made this series more than a decade after their Walking with Dinosaurs series. Compared to Walking with Dinosaurs, this newer series incorporated research findings in the past ten years. The visual effect on the Blu-ray Discs are very sharp, much more clearer than Walking with Dinosaurs. However, since this series is completely made with CGI, it does not have the real environmental shots as in the Walking with Dinosaurs. The production cost of this series was 1/3 of that of Walking with Dinosaurs for the same reason. My only complaint about the visual is that at times the dinosaurs look pretty rubbery, almost toyish. But overall, the visual is still stunning.<br /><br />This series has research snippets embedded in the the presentation, so much more educational. You know why the scientists reached certain conclusions and what was pure speculation.<br /><br />The series does NOT play in many of the US Bluray players. I bought the same bluray discs from Amazon UK site for 1/3 of the price on Amazon US site (including shipping from UK to US). On Amazon UK site, the discs are claimed to be region free. But it also says  Please note that this product will not play on US spec 60i Blu-ray players as the Blu-ray discs are authored to UK 50i specs. As many customers mentioned on the UK site, they only play in European or Region Free bluray players. I have three bluray players bought in US: two Sonys and one LG. Only the LG player can play the featured presentation on the first disc. The second disc which contains special features cannot be played in any of my bluray players.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked the game. I would have liked more game play and more mini games to play. The best part was the story line.
1933633867|5.0|Fantastic book. A bit lengthy, but very well researched and readable. Graeber's training is in anthropology, and he uses that to expertly discuss the history of money, which he argues (contra Adam Smith) begins with debt, proceeds to currency, and only rarely deviates to bartering. It starts with the earliest accounting of debt in the Middle and Far East and ends with an explanation of the Federal Reserve.  Read it.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|There all types of horror that play it safe (spooky sleight of hand tricks), desensitizing, predictable and boring (gore and blood) and those that take you off the beaten path and you're not quite sure you wanted to go there. Like this film, which I'd always heard about as a cult classic and it was on Netflix.<br /><br />In this 1970s version of 'I Spit On Your Grave', a title that has nothing to do with anything, we meet Jenny Hill, a beautiful New Yorker spending a summer in a secluded lakeside area to write her first novel. Innocent enough. Except for the local gang of men, who decide to have their fun with a lone woman in the woods. They stalk her, rape her repeatedly, beat her brutally and then attempt to kill her. After weeks of recovery, Jenny's rage is the only solace as her world is fractured and will always be. She plots her revenge, carefully and methodically, and detachedly but effectively. This is not a film you 'enjoy' or even 'like' but most definitely may despise and hate. It is a film of experience and emotion--of the audience.<br /><br />What is more disturbing, that there are exploitive films like this? Or that I watched the whole thing? Or that I knew the plot and still watched it? Or that while it made me think, I am not as disgusted as I should be? There is something to be said about shock value and in horror films like this one, and others--like [[ASIN:B0013O123Q Irreversible (English Subtitled]]; [[ASIN:B005JTLTI4 Dragon Tattoo Trilogy: Extended Edition]] & [[ASIN:B001D6H3KK The Girl Next Door]]--where they insidiously cull the viewers to be participants in the acts of terror and primal violence by not looking away. We flinch, we gasp in repugnance but watch it, and that is what's chilling and horrific.<br /><br />I neither disliked or liked this movie but there were many ethical and moral questions that arises from such a movie that involves gang rape of the worst type of violence, and how that is handled. I felt the impact of that and I'm not sure what to think. Jenny wins, but does she? The evil guys get what they deserve, but did they? There is a weird sense of satisfaction when Jenny takes matters into her own hands, but by what design did she aid in her own self-destruction? By exacting her revenge, does she become as vile as the men who violated her? There are no winners and losers in this story. This is a movie to shock, and it does, but whether the director and writer attempted to expound a social and cultural view on rape and the aftereffects of the act, is the question; and if they did not factor in the deliberate psychological and traumatic terror, were they irresponsible in handling the whole film entirely? Yes and no. Horror movies are meant to be thoughtless and visual, taping into the most visceral part of humans, fear.

0345803485|1.0|Misunderstood by My Mother<br /><br />Last year's Christmas was a revelation - another one. I recently read a wise sentence on a postcard that went something like \\"The presents you get show how much people misunderstand you.\\" And last Christmas my mother gave me the final proof of how much that is true by giving me the Shades of Grey trilogy. Yay.<br />I am a literary scholar, a bibliophile, a PhD student, I own a library, I studied the great literature of the world under the best. And my mom gives me \\"Shades of Grey\\" saying that all her colleagues just loved it (she works at a gynecologist's) and even showed up late for work because they couldn't put the book down. It is written with such wit, simply darling how she talks about her inner goddess and stuff, they said.<br />Now, I don't aim at sounding elitist but my mom's 40-year-old frustrated, half doctor's receptionist, half housewife colleagues are not a reliable reference when it comes to the value of a piece of literature.<br />Here the anecdote merges into a diatribe. The author of this book sounds like the clumsy diary or wish-book of a retarded middle school girl in love. I mean, when an adult woman feels the urge to write a crappy piece of fan fiction featuring Edward and Bella having some sort of allegedly researched S&M sex, there is obviously something very wrong with her. Poor virgin spinster. 30 pages into the book Mrs James is out of ways of saying that her protagonist blushed, was clumsy, and thought that Christian Grey was handsome.  But seriously, that is all she does say ALL THE TIME. Oh, I forgot: Sex is also happening. And when you think that this piece of crap must be on a bestseller list for a reason and reckon, if not for the writing in general, it must have something to do with the great description of the sex scenes at least. Nope. Same old same old. Fingers digging through hair, feeling erection, filling her out completely, bursting into a million pieces, done. Over and over.<br />Here isa forced interpretation: The constant and insistent repetition of not only the structure of the sex scenes, but also of phrases and even individual words is obviously symbolic of the act of intercourse itself and represents the to-and-fro movement involved there. Well done, Mrs James. Read a friggin book. And to everybody who actually liked it: Don't get too excited about the fact that you managed to read through your first book and now think you like reading. You're not welcome in our group of actual readers of literature.
0307887448|4.0|Ready Player One is a really unique dystopian tale. In the future real life is so depressing that most people spend all their time in OASIS a virtual reality plethora of all the planets, places & avatars you could dream up.<br /><br />Our main character is Wade Watts, a high schooler who is obsessed w/ solving the Easter egg hunt in the OASIS that the creator left when he died, which leads to billions of dollars. Luckily for us the creator was obsessed w/ 80's pop culture & the clues/world all pertain to it.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book. I'm not a gamer at all but there's many 80's references to other things like movies, music & tv that it was not a problem at all.<br /><br />If you love dystopic future novels, nostalgia or a quest story, this is the book for you. It was a joy to read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Hi I'm Letrecia. I  and love playing. This game. And I hope others will to so I hope you all enjoy play
B003EY7JH6|5.0|I loved reading the Foundation novels a long time ago and was glad I found them on Kindle.  Can't go wrong with Asimov.
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|It is simple and no nonsense and I like that.  I only wish that it had flash, but you can not expect to much.  I like that it is simple to use.
0765325950|4.0|So we finally come to the end.  It's been over 20 years since I first picked up The Wheel of Time on a whim, and now, 14 books later, it's over.  The Memory of Light is overall a satisfying resolution of the story.  It is difficult to comment in detail without giving things away.  While I too share the disappointment of many that the ebook is not being released simultaneously, this is not a protest review at all.<br /><br />The first part of the book is a prologue to the last battle.  Getting people in the right places and setting the table for war.  The guts of the book is the last battle itself.  This is a battle that goes on and on and on.  I found the battle to be a grim and exhausting read in places, but there are some very compelling scenes.  The final part of the book is the epilogue, which was refreshing and well done.  Only after reading it did I learn that Robert Jordan had written it (with only a few later tweaks).  I guess it's his final legacy.<br /><br />TMOL tries to resolve dozens of open storylines and loose ends.  Most are resolved quite nicely, but a few get lost in the shuffle.  And there were a few loose ends that I thought cried out for resolution, but never even made an appearance in this book. One problem with having so many storylines that need to be addressed is that the book jumps around a lot, jerking you from one character to another and then another, etc.  This makes for a dizzy experience and so I didn't think the book had quite the cohesiveness and depth of some of the other books in the series.  The writing is excellent and the dialogue fresh and Brandon Sanderson is a master at throwing surprises at you.  This book could have been very predictable, but it isn't.  You know how it will all end, but trust me you have no idea how that end is going to come about.  I thought I knew how some storylines would play out in the final book, but I was wrong on all of them.<br /><br />Strongpoints:  The Mat-Tuon/Fortuona storyline is great, as are the Elayne and Egwene storylines.  It's also nice to see Tam Al'thor step back into the story again.  And Lan is handled well too.  In addition, OMG, Brandon Sanderson takes gateways to another fracking level in this book.  It's very clever and imaginative.  You should read the book just for this, if for no other reason.<br /><br />Meh points:  I found the Perrin storyline strangely bland.  That may be because much of it is consumed with fighting Slayer, but I'd already had a belly full of Slayer fighting in book 13.  Also, I expected the Tuatha'an to make more of an appearance than they do.<br /><br />Criticisms:  I wish Nynaeve, Moraine and Tom Merrilin could have played a bigger role in the final book than they do.  Oh, they're there, but they don't get the attention they deserve, given how central a role they've played in the earlier books.  Conversely, some minor characters get entirely too much attention.  For example, coming into this book I had little interest in Pevara/Androl and was surprised to see them handed a starring role in this book.  Finally, I was expecting big things out of Logain and I thought his storyline kind of fizzled out.<br /><br />Coda:  Kudos to Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson.  I have no doubt that as long as fantasy lit is read there will be two names that absolutely will be on everyone's reading list:  JRR Tolkien and Robert Jordan.e the Elayne and Egwene storylines.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Kept me up past my bedtime on more than one occasion! Great twists and a good love story.  Will check out Colleen's other books.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The story was okay however I did not enjoy any of the characters. The energy radiating from this book is dark and creepy. I feel like I need to scrub my mind.  Not a recommended read from me.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is just what I was looking for.  Lightweight, unobtrusive and protective.  The price is definitely right and I feel much more comfortable with it on my kindle!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think half-way through this book. But in the end I'm glad I read it. Lot's of foul language, but the characters were complex. I'd recommend it.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I am very happy wih the purchase. Receive items in now time. Shopping was very easy, and I would do again .
B009K0P10K|5.0|Revenge is simply awesome. You will not<br />Miss an episode once you start watching.<br />The writing is incredibly clever and intriguing

B00000J6AG|5.0|I just received this album over half an hour ago, and I can say it's definitely one of my favorite Cd's to own. It's very peaceful,calm, and comforting, while Machete reminds me of Tron, with it's upbeat tempo and vocals. This is an album I'd listen to while driving in Manhattan at night, or on a rainy day. Can't recommend this enough.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />Porcelain<br />Inside<br />Why does my Heart feel so Bad?<br />My Weakness<br />Guitar Flute & String<br />Down Slow<br />Everloving
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great app. though the ads can be really annoying, they are very easy to skip. i recommend this game. very good.
B003297I1U|5.0|This toy is of exception quality.  This purchase became the first of many Bruder purchases.  Their attention to detail is spectacular.  This isn't the typical crap you find at your local big box store.  The working features of the crane will entertain Dad as much as the son.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I cannot say enough about this series - top notch acting, storyline, etc.  I will watch it again after awhile.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think you should get this game because it challenges your mind to do almost impossible things like finding ways to get the one dot connected to another using pipes. But be warned you can not cross the pipes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to navigate. A pop-up now and then, but what do you expect for free. I love a good time killer, and is as good as any you will find
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I will never get enough or tired of listening to Amy. She burned brightly and unfortunately too quickly. On this album, which, I don't believe any of these tracks have been release  before, though, once again she bares her heart and soul singing some great covers and two of her own tracks, in a different version. We also  must give the producers much credit for the wonderful job they did too, for anybody else could have failed to do justice for this talent. All in all, I feel the Amy Winehouse fans will be pleased with this album. RIP Amy.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I am reading Team of Rivals for the second time and definitely give it 5 stars.The author has researched so thoroughly(for 12 years, she said recently at a Gettysberg Memeorial Celebration) and has given original insights into Lincoln's character as well as his wife's. A number of people I've talked to have started it and put it down, I think because the lives of the rivals and the political situations are so thoroughly detailed. I've said to them, just skip some of that and read on, because it's one of the best historical books I've ever read.And Lincoln is certainly one of, if not the greatest -and most fascinating-  leaders- that ever lived. This book gets you into his head as well as his heart. Don't miss it!

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great writing skills.  Too much on the teen sex for me to recommend to my 14 yr old daughter.  Interesting plot and story line.
B0086700CM|4.0|a lot of fun and is extremely addicting.  you will not want to put it down till you cant stay awake any longer.  some parts are flawed in that it sets you up to lose but rarely happens.  awesome time burner.
B007EECSFA|4.0|I read Forgotten Garden before this book, and enjoyed the unique story and writing style of Kate Morton. This book was one I enjoyed even more. She is definately original in her plotting, and her characters are very well filled out. As always, I like to tell readers that there is no gratuitous violence or sex in this book. Mystery and suspense drive the plots in both of the books I have read, but it is not of the pulse pounding variety. Enjoy.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|This book isn't merely satire to skewer the tropes of science fiction serials.  It's also a great story with funny and interesting characters in its own right.  So far, my 2nd favorite novel by the author after Old Man's War. Check it out!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Couldn't have been better, everything was perfect :D  Thank You  Everything about it exceeded my expectations.... I will for sure be shopping here again. and it was so easy to figure out... Daughter loves it
0670026603|5.0|Realy enjoyed this touching story. I think the plot and characters were well thought out. I couldn't put the book down!
B003D5FFY0|5.0|A nice sampler of Wings and other great songs and hits - excellent Paul all the way. Very enjoyable album!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book! I couldn't put it down. I was really able to escape into this world of Panem. Looking forward to the next one.
B005XLN97M|5.0|Couldn't have been better, everything was perfect :D  Thank You  Everything about it exceeded my expectations.... I will for sure be shopping here again. It was easy to assemble, this being the first of many (i'm sure). Looks just like the picture and My daughter loves it, it made her Christmas, Thank You so much...
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The mark of Athena is an exciting book that takes you to a different time. It is a great book jam packed with information.
B001FB5634|5.0|Saw this before, read the book by Cormac McCarthy, and just had to own it.....it really follows the book amazingly, and the acting was excellent!  Can't even imagine our world ever ending up like this.....scary, but portrayed in a very real way.....totally believable!  Loved it, and so would anyone who loves a good book or movie!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I must admit, I bought this book because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and having done so, I can say that quite honestly, I still don't really know what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, because it was quite enjoyable, and rather than simply being full of gratuitous sex (which is kind of what I was expecting), there is actually an interesting and captivating storyline.<br /><br />However, the reason I didn't give this a five star rating is because the somewhat repetitive dialogue spoiled the read for me at times.<br /><br />In all, it's not a bad book, although like I said, I don't really understand all the hoohah, or its subsequent huge success.<br /><br />Good job to E.L. James though - there's no denying that she identified a gap in the market and then filled it with aplomb!<br /><br />Would I recommend it?  Definitely, if only so you can join in the conversation when everyone else is talking about it.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Love Bruce Willis, one of the reasons I wanted to watch the movie. Starting to like Joseph Gordon-Levitt as an adult actor. Just didn't like the plot all that well. Too many unanswered questions, too many items not explained. Should have waited for the movie to make it to Starz.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Enjoyed the book very much. Lee child is one of my fav writers. Love murder, mayhem, and mystery. Send more Reacher to me
B005CRQ3LG|2.0|I purchased this book for my 2 year old grandson,but he had no interest in it at all. I think I would have liked a more interactive format.
B003O86FMW|1.0|I thought the entire series was lacking in characters and story line. If I hadn't bought the trilogy I would have stopped reading after the first book. I really can't fathom how this got to be such a sensation.<br /><br />I can see how this may have been popular for teens but fail to see how writing at this level can be interesting to anyone older than 20-ish...<br /><br />First and last set of books I will read by Suzanne Collins. Sorry to any die hard fans, but I thought it was really quite bad.
B008DW6VOQ|3.0|This app connects you to all kinds of great content from Bloomberg. However, this app has aspect ratio issues when used on Kindle Fire HD 8.9. Specifically, when it comes to the stock charts you can tell that the app wasn't designed for this device.

B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read most of Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child novels and am a great fan of Special Agent Pendergast. This trilogy has it all, great plot, interesting characters ,well written and at last, more disclosure  about the life of Aloysius' mysterious and beautiful ward, Constance Green that we have had hints about in earlier books, but have been curious to know more about her past. These books are as good as they come in the genre.  A must read for Lincoln & Child fans. Van't wait for the next installment.
B00005JLEX|4.0|My Dad was and still is an avid Seinfeld fan. I bought this for him at Christmas time for a gift and he was very pleased. Great for any fan of the show.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|So far I have gone through the majority of the episodes, I would recommend this story over SG:Universe any day.  I'll have to watch SG1 now to catch up on some of the references.
B004RZGUBM|2.0|I am fairly new to e-books but found this one very hard to navigate.  Index was hard to find - link from selected book to the actual book didn't work.  It is a huge collection but hard to move around in.
B002RKSZS0|4.0|Intrigue and romance with loves lost and found, just like you'd expect from J. A.  No real surprises, but a fine story.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game, not a high IQ challenging game. Enjoyable while waiting for an appointment. I reccomend this game to all my friends.<br />Just because they want you to buy coins doesnt mean you have to buy them.
B000W4KT64|1.0|This movie stopped working half way through. This is very upsetting and embarrassing because it was a gift for my grandmother and she loves the movie. Unfortunately, I don't know what to do...
B006LSZECO|3.0|An interesting read as Flynn writes in conversational style, but a seeming waste of time on the pathetic motivations of people lacking integrity.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Waking Up Married was a fun, light romance.  I found the situation to be interesting, though I got a little impatient with the hero's inability to recognize that whet he was feeling was love.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|Bought CD and then went to the Mirage to see the live version of this play, best time in Vegas- by far!! Great investment and wonderful and memorable vacation too! MAM
B001BC5HXG|5.0|If I had a wish that I knew could be granted, it would be that I could write with the power and passion of John Steinbeck for six months! This is an extraordinary novel, beautifully written and, Steinbeck always trusts the intelligence of his readers.  I have read the bulk of his work and enjoyed every minute spent in his company.E
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It may be my generation but I did not care for this book and did not read the second and third books.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This product came in the mail with the mute switch broken off. It is very difficult to text because of the bubbles in the screen and most people were not able to hear me when I talked to them with the case on. The material is very cheap and I suspect that this case is counterfeit. I bought it through Alex's Electronix. I would suggest buying an authentic case off of the Life Proof website because this case is inoperable.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Very nice case and like the features with the elastic band and the stand the kindle up.  One thing the designer didn't think of was that there is no way to close the cover and plug in the charger.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Made me laugh, cry and remember the tough times. Instantly fell in love with Charlie. Amazing quotes. Absolutely heartbreaking. And also heartwarming.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I started with Season 1 just to see what the hubbub was all about. I was hooked after one episode.<br />The characters and their various relationships develop so marvelously and then the period costuming just adds to the<br />grand sense of it all.<br /><br />I only wish Season 3 was free with Prime like Seasons 1 and 2 - :)
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was an outstanding read.  it gave the reader a bird;s eye view of this undertaking.  It was vivid and reminded us of how very serious the war on terrorism is and we cannot stop fighting it.

B005K17RU0|5.0|This has been very easy to set up and it has been pretty accurate as far as forecasting.  Of course, the further out you go, the more unreliable the forecasting gets, so I usually don't look at any further out than 3 days.

B007WULJ5G|4.0|I just purchased (and watched) the 'un-censored' version of \\"A Serbian Film\\" - had to get it thru US based Amazon.com as the, much talked about, additional 'minute or so' of excised footage is apparently 'too brutal for Canadian sensibilities' to handle - so Amazon.ca doesn't list it! Certainly didn't appreciate having to pay the stupidly exorbitant $12.95 postage for the US shipping - making this a $40.00 film by the time it arrived in my mailbox - those were some pretty expensive 'minutes' of un-censored action! Was it worth it??!!<br /><br />I have watched a lot of weird transgressive flix over the years - generally I like them - the 'quality' of that genre of film can certainly be 'all over the map'. \\"A Serbian Film\\" has excellent production values, acting, and gore FX and in many ways is not really any more shocking than numerous 'mainstream' gross-out horror works such as the 'Hostel' and \\"Saw' franchises (despite reviewer's statements like: \\"Makes 'Hostel' seem like a Disney film\\" etc.) - though it DOES definitely have more overtly sexual elements included... which always seems to 'get people going'. as they say. The 'slickness' of the production decidedly helps to suck one in and as the 'atrocities' presented within the plot gain in momentum and outrageousness there are many 'uncomfortable' moments to be 'enjoyed' (or NOT!) by the viewer until the final scene of nihilistic perversity is played out. I found myself initially sorta 'aghast' in the immediate aftermath of viewing it and went back to look at what other reviewers of the film on Amazon.com had said about it. One of the most interesting 'comments' was the info that the film's director. purportedly, made the film as a 'blackly satirical statement on the condition of the people and government in post-war Serbia\\" - IF that is the case it certainly puts a whole different spin on the film and would warrant a different set of criteria in assessing its' subject matter. With or without such a 'redeeming' political sub-text the over-the-top sexploitational aspects of this film certainly seem shocking at first, but (upon deeper reflection and comparison) are not all that different or MORE shocking than much similar fare that has been produced in the past. One of the notorious 'censored' scenes involves a woman who has been tortured by having her teeth knocked out B4 she is orally raped - grim stuff!, but then I remembered an identical scenario in the '70's \\"Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Shieks\\" where a girl was being sold at a 'sex slave auction' and her prospective 'buyer' demanded similar oral modifications. In another 'censored' scene the infamous 'new-born porn' is 'revealed' - a concept that actually went so 'over-the-top as to become ludicrously hilarious. Other previous 'underground' horror flix such as \\"Deadgirl', \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Guinea Pig\\", \\"Grotesque\\" etc,. ad nauseum - ALL feature creepy concepts and buckets of gore that are at least as harrowing as the imagery contained in the 'Serbian' film!<br /><br />Personally, I feel there is actually something about the word \\"Serbian\\" in the title that imbues this film with more import and impact than it might otherwise garner. The fact that the real-life war atrocities in the, relatively recent, 'Serbian' conflict occurred lend a special nuance of creepy-ness to the production & viewing experience... without that 'connection' it becomes merely another sick-twisted fantasy to be 'enjoyed' by fans of the genre. One reviewer pointed to the recent film \\"Whistleblower\\" as an example of a movie that deals with some of the more 'actual' horrific events of human smuggling and sexual violence against women that are still happening in some parts of Eastern Europe (and elswhere!). I gave it a watch and can honestly say that I found it to be way more disturbing than 'A Serbian Film'. In the final analysis, I would say that \\"A Serbian Film\\" is an 'effective' and, surprisingly. well made bit of exploitation that 'appears' to push theboundaries of the genre - but REALLY doesn't offer much that hasn't been done elsewhere previously - just where DOES one go from here, and WHY?!

0743270754|5.0|I've read many books on A. Lincoln and I enjoyed Team of Rivals over the rest. I felt as if I was in the cabinet room with Seward, Chase, and Stanton. I thought about buying a Sandburg book on Lincoln today at an antique book shop. When I perused some of the writing, I really thought his writing was inferior to Goodwin's. Kudos to Goodwin. I wish I'd written this book.

B0000DZ3EN|4.0|It is always difficult to make a sequel to a classic film, especially if you do so a decade or more later. This becomes next to impossible if it is a film that is based on a novel or series of novels. Most people know of the original Wizard of Oz film, but most are unaware that it is all based on a series of books. This film is a solid effort to keep to the books, while also paying homage to the original film. This is one of the first films Disney did in the live action area, and it is a solid effort. Fairuza Balk is well casted as Dorothy, and the work by Lucas and Henson in the film is top notch. This is a great film to have, be it for your kids or for your personal collection.
B007P06DJK|5.0|When the album was first released I only had a cassette tape recorder and so never experienced the full brilliance of the album. Having the DVD documentary on the making of the album included in the set increased my understanding and appreciation of the complexities involved in the album coming together - something that was completely lost on my 25 years younger self.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
030758836X|3.0|GONE GIRL (Pub 2012) by Gillian Flynn has been riding the NY Times bestseller list for 32 weeks now. Last week it was at #1, this week it slipped a notch to #2 (as of 1/19/13). The book's popularity is why I put it on my to-read list. I admit to being a bit of a follower when it comes to picking up a book, word of mouth and all that, right?<br /><br />I had to hang loose on the library's wait list for a couple months to get the book, and almost went ahead and purchased it because of the long wait, but I'm glad I didn't. I was so disappointed in this story, even though the plot sounded intriguing.<br /><br />Nick and Amy Dunne are married, childless, and living in the Big Apple, earning a living as writers, but with the changes in the industry, they both end up jobless. Nick convinces his wife to move back to his hometown,in Podunk, Missouri, and they buy a house there, along with a local bar that Nick and his sister go partners on, paid for with a large chunk of Amy's trust fund. Amy isn't working, and their marriage is slowly eroding, but Nick is hanging in--until Amy goes missing from their home on the morning of their fifth anniversary. It happens out of the blue, and the cops immediatley begin pointing fingers at Nick.<br /><br />To be fair to the author, I am not an 'academic/literary' kind of reader. I'll admit to being an action junky, but I also love strong characters, great dialogue and intriguing plots, so even if a book is short on action, if it's got all the rest going for it, I'll enjoy it as long as the writing style appeals.<br /><br />I got the impression from the first pages of Gone Girl that the author is an 'academic writer', focusing hard on delivering a sophisticated writing style. Power to her, but it just doesn't work for me. Story first, impressive writing second is my motto as a reader, and as a writer. Call me a simpleton, but I'm being honest since this is a 'low' review.<br /><br />What made me give up on this book is the way the author laid it out. The story opens in the husband's POV, which is enjoyable enough, but then when it switches to the wife's, instead of it being written as it's happening, the author chose to write it in 'journal' form - so the wife is basically talking to herself - and this continues throughout the book. Not only do I dislike that approach, it is made worse by the fact that everything the wife is 'telling us' in the journal is a flashback. Meanwhile, the story flips back/forth between the wife's journal entries and Nick's POV, which is written in the present. To me, this made it really hard to get into the story, or get into the character of Amy at all.<br /><br />I didn't finish the book because of this approach to the story, so in fairness to the author, I am giving it three stars because I can't rate the overall quality of the plot itself, so I'll assume it was at least a 4 or 5, since it's been riding the bestseller list so long. The characterization of Nick, is good, and the author's prose is elegant (a little high-brow/distracting for a thriller). For me, the book gets a 1-star on the overall construction so I'm averaging the two out.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great show! Not Firefly, but I'll take Nathan Fillion any way I can have him, great and funny actor! I definitely recommend this show.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|very beautifully written, and even though I didn't think I'd like it because it was set way back in the past, I did like it and very quickly became enthralled with all the characters. Great book.
0307887448|5.0|a great trip to my childhood. Cline captures the essence of the 80's in this wild chase for the ultimate game high score.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Been there.<br />The sex escapades did nothing for me, no arousal. The mind f-bombs were everything.<br />The escape ...... is an experience that EL James threw back as hard and fast, even more painful than the belt lashes.<br />Good book. To close to home for me but I could not stop reading/reliving.
B004Y042N8|3.0|It could be more challenging, it takes up time waiting somewhere. the graphics are good, Would I purchase it again, probably ..
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We've been watching this for ten years and love it. We know most of the lines and reference it often, as do a lot of people. Great Holiday tradition for us.
0062012339|5.0|Good read if you want to know all the gross and shocking details of Motley Crue among them a cockroach infested apartment-very entertaining and fun to read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP! This is one of the most awesomely apps I have ever played it keeps me well entertained when I'm bored
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wish it ended differently. Like does she ever see him again or was that it. Did they get back together?
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved all the characters and all the twists and turns. Beautiful story and very well written. I loved it.
B009X2CUYA|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Kate Morton's books. This was excellent and I am only disappointed that I have read them all now.
B0095R64AO|5.0|I Found That It  Was A Really Really Really Good And Very Unpredictable And Funny And Enjoyable Movie To Watch!!!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As expected Ken Follett paints a sweeping picture of happiness and hardship. The story moves at a good pace but does seem to drag on some parts. Ken seems to dwell quite heavily on the political diversity of the time but seems to define the characters mindsets. I'm looking forward to the last book with anticipation.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|What a great and scary and suspenseful book. Very believable, and very pertinent to today's world. Such a great read.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I loved every song on this CD. Adele's voice is simply amazing and wonderful to listen to. A must have in any music collection.
B000009HF2|5.0|My husband loves the old music. Nice Christmas present the old music is hard to find so it's nice we can just order it on line.
B003O86FMW|4.0|A really good book full of suspense. I didn't want it to end. The way it ended made me start reading the next book right away and I will re-read the book in the future

B001AQO3QA|5.0|One of my favorite &#34;series&#34; of movies, this is in the best packaging I have ever seen for DVD's.  On top of that, the quality of the DVD's are good.  If you are a fan, this is the set to get.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book kept me reading all night long, if you like halo, this book and series will expand your knowledge
B00457WZEI|5.0|Very good read! This is not my typical type of book, but my 10 year old boy wanted to read it, so I figured that I better. Loved the book!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Brings back fond memories!  I love the &#34;joystick&#34;!  As computer technology became more sophisticated, I thought I had lost my favorite &#34;waste time&#34; game.  Glad he/she re-appeared!!!
B006BG7RI0|5.0|This has been a favorite movie of mine forever.  The set is beautifully done and the quality of the DVD was good.  Getting the coaster set was a bonus!  I watch this movie about twice a year and the set has enhanced that experience for me.
B000VYX8PE|1.0|I know that thousands of children have loved this series so I thought I'd try it.  The consistent abuses accounted here was awful.  The children overcame their circumstance, but I dont' think they should have to.  I realize I'm often too optimistic, but I really don't want to read about a subject this dark.  I won't be reading more.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very interesting. Couldn't put it down. I really liked how the author put a lot of different twists in it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|It could have been longer. But overall it was fun and a great  game! Please make another!! It was worth every penny. Buy it and you will love it!
0529064847|5.0|i had one befor and loved it.i remember how easy it was to read the word and understand it.thank you so much for offering it and at such a resonable price
B0049CVUNG|5.0|The product is breathtaking. A renewal of cast members -- whose voices are outstanding. You'll feel the emotion of the stage play, different from a movie but every bit as valid.
B002N44XSG|5.0|I love all Rick Riordan books and this is one of my favorites. It was  very actionpaked an exiting<br />B
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game, for free, is by far my favorite game on my kindle to date. I loooooooooved the gameplay, and I have only done 3 levels!
0345803493|4.0|Better than book 1. I found myself flying through this book as it has parts that you just cant stop in the middle of.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|In Bad Piggies, it reveals how tough the pigs are.  They are able to do anything like flying when they hit TNT.  You also get to design vehicles.  Get the full version.  This is really good for a free app though!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Amazing that's all I can say love the ending<br />Couldn't have been better.<br />Loved loved loved loved loved loved loved
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is fun, exciting, and mysterious! If you are looking for a new exciting game, pick this! It's one of the best games I've EVER known.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Updating our VHS version of the Disney movies for our grandson to enjoy.  Keeping our video library up to date.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|OK, the reason you watch these movies is to put hair on your chest and grunt like a caveman for 1.5 hours.<br /><br />Believe it or not, the first one was better than this one. Chuck Norris just shows up (not giving anything away because he is in the commercials), same with Arnold and Willis. No real rhyme or reason, just out of the blue there they are.<br /><br />Overall if you have a few beers and half watch it, it's fine, but nowhere near a five star movie.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|As expected, Brandon Sanderson delivers another inventive magic system in his newest novella, &#34;The Emperor's Soul.&#34; The &#34;rules&#34; of Forging seem perhaps slightly less well-defined than some of his other systems--perhaps because the main motivation of the plot is an attempt to exceed the commonly expected possibilities of the magic--but it retains the overall sense of plausibility within the world that is the trademark of Sanderson's systems. There are limits to what a Forger can do, even if the story is an attempt to stretch those boundaries.<br /><br />The more focused narrative of the novella also allows the characters to really shine. In some of his other works, Sanderson has a tendency to have a couple strongly-developed characters surrounded by a cast of common archetypes, which sometimes has the unintentional effect of highlighting the weakness of the supporting cast rather than the strength of the central cast. Because &#34;The Emperor's Soul&#34; is shorter and has less characters, the opposite happens. The main characters are as well-developed as in the author's full-length outings, but actually shine the brighter for being more the focus.<br /><br />There is certainly plenty of material to be mined for future longer works should the author desire, but the novella stands on its own as a satisfying and complete story.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was well written and caught my attention right from the beginning. The plot got more and more intriguing as the games finally started and each contestant started to die.  A little gruesome at times but very descriptive.  I would recommend this book to anyone above the age of 15.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|We keep adding these Disney Classics to our collection for our grandson.  Especially like the Combo versions. Replacing an ageing VHS collection!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A thought provoking love story. A true depiction of \\" man's inhumanity to man\\". Anticipating same from remaining two books.
B000FBFN0Q|5.0|First of all, the reader needs to go into this book knowing it isn't great literature and doesn't have deep meanings that need to be uncovered.  It is a light-hearted, whimsical book that is highly entertaining and just plain fun.<br /><br />A friend of mine who typically gravitates toward dark, gloomy novels texted me the other day about how much she had enjoyed reading this series of books.  For her to find something like this enjoyable is really out of the norm and caused me to pay attention.  I had just finished a massive, historical novel set during WWII and the Holocaust so I was in the mood to move to something lighter and fluffy.  About half way in I understood why she was so enthused.  I read the entire book over a couple of days and had a ball.  The main character is a hoot and being privy to some of her crazy, internal dialogue is hilarious.<br /><br />Quite an enjoyable read from beginning to end and silly in a fun way.  I have already started reading the second one in the series and hope it is as good as this one was.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Keeping these to entertain our grandson as he grows up!  Like the combo Blue-Ray, DVD idea too! Replacing all of the VHS versions of these Disney Classics!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I understood Augustus and Hazel and felt so much of what they were going through. The story has a sad happiness. I loved the humor along with the unusual witty takes on life and cancer. Truly a great book and I will recommend it to everyone.
1455519006|4.0|Good read so far.  Haven't finished it but am quite satisfied.  Good action and plot like most of Baldacci's books.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Great quality, I was able to download and sync it to my iTunes right away, and start listening to the awesome music!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Story is great but this version does not have the illustrations<br />Mary twain was a master story teller. Must read
B0060MYM3S|5.0|The HBO production does the books justice.  Superbly presented. What a tale!  As excellent on the screen as written by the master himself.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Perfect for what I wanted.  Good and solid, does not loose the cards.  can fit a max of 6 micro sd with 2 converters.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Very difficult to follow and had even more problems shutting it down.  Would not let me escape!  Terrible app!  Deleted it!
B0074VTHKM|5.0|He's done it again I can't believe how amazing this book was. It's to bad though I wanted to find out what happened to Mr.Duffy oh well?
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The show is beautifully filmed, fast paced, and just darn interesting. We have become addicted to the full series now.
030758836X|5.0|I kept thinking that through the 1st half of the book. Then it switched gears. Smoothely. Effectively. Not to diminish Tim O'Brian\\"s terrific novel. But Flynn bent the thought and carried it into a fun realm unexpected. Those who didn't enjoy this work disliked the ending, but I was intrigued by what appalled them. I do not know if this is great literature, but I certainly found it a great read. Really interesting characters. Really interesting plot. I don't know if I'd wish a luncheon with the characters, but lunch with the author? Yikes!
0765325950|5.0|You people giving 1 and 2 stars are crazy... The writing was great! I could not put down the book and was compelled to read deep into the night. I would read a blender manual that Brandon Sanderson wrote.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|It was cute, my grandson liked it, so was worth ordering it, he loved the elves. Thank you for offering it.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|I was sorely disappointed in this last instalment so.much more could have been done. :( I found myself hating Thomas more and more with every page
B003WJQ74E|5.0|One of those books that gives you a different perspective on things. I've read this book over and over and I get something new from it each time.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|For kids I guess it was ok, but for me the commercial for it made me want to watch it.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|This is the best movie I have seen in a long time. All the actors are  at there best. you will just love it , a movie you can watch over, and over again.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|Most of the items in the game wants real life cash, not cash you can earn from playing the game.
B009MF5BXK|3.0|Beware: Heavy spoiler below!<br /><br />If it were not for the best cast ever in the history of action movie, I might have even rated it a two stars or below. The key complaints I got is as follows:-<br /><br />1. The first ten minutes of 2 is simply the mix of the all best scenes of 1. That's it. No more heavy \\"blow the hell out of it\\" scenes again.<br />2. Jet Li left immediately after the first fight. I am not a die hard fan of Li but his absence largely reduced the amount of fist fight, though the small amount by Stratham using knives was still very good. The last one between Stallone and Van Dam was real bad.<br />3. The story sucked. Of course this is an action movie people should care most about the action. However, I could not convince myself why it took over two days for Stallone to move/drive through some rural deserted villages to a Plutonium mine yet it took just a very short while for the bad guys to drive to a very modern airport in a city.<br />4. I knew Chuck Norris was an invincible lone wolf. Yet, how could he destroy a tank and tens of gangsters armed with machine guys in five seconds that even professionals like Stallone and his team got no idea how he made it?<br />5. The cinematography of 1 is better than 2. I guess Stallone is a much better director than Simon West.<br />6. Worst of all, even when showering with bullets against each other face to face, only the bad guys ate the bullets.<br /><br />Certainly, it's awesome to see nearly all the great action stars of the 80's in the same film! Nevertheless, I am obliged to warn young action movie audience that they are very likely to be disappointed!
B004EPZ070|5.0|It is the best romance movie that I have seen in a long time. Kate Hudson is a girl you love to hate.  buy it and enjoy it  for hours to come, you will love it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have this app downloaded on all my android devices so that I can read the same book on each one. Very convenient.
B00028U6B8|3.0|Some of the music is great but some of it is very dated. This album really marks the end of an era.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|The books holds your interest throughout. There may have been other events like this but a bit of luck allowed both pilots to meet after the war and confirm things unknown to each while flying over the north sea.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener is indeed really handy, It may not be the perfect sharpener, but it's so light and works as a backup when out in the wild.
B008MM9630|4.0|I like the goals in the game and I agree it is great that you don't have to depend on others to complete a task.. very addictive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great game a lot like the full one 1 thing just wish a new update would come out soon iv played it for a while love it best game in the world
B008EKOO46|3.0|I like the way he organizes his research.  I wish that he had outlined some of his applications a little sooner.  That would have made  his introduction a little less tedious.  However, it is an interesting approach to the study of other societies.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is a perfect soundtrack to listen to when you need a lift....I feel like I am enjoying the surf, sand and tradewinds when I listen to this music.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is so addicting i cant stop playing it! it is simple fun but can be so challenging at the same time! must get!
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Entertaining movie. Both actors were superb! Great movie to watch with your girl of the guys. Worth a rent or stream.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love this series. This  is the second time I am reading them and it still keeps me in them. Can't say enough.  A must read!
B004RLEBTY|4.0|So, i will say i picked up their first album after seeing them play but not before watched their video for prehistoric dog. I will say i really liked their first album but had stopped listening to it after a few months, still a good run . Anyways i saw them a second time live, inviting a buddy describing their overpowering bass and radness. Long story short i avoided their second album and regretted it as they played in my hometown a couple times since it's release. This album is a cross between a lot of good bands and gives me the feeling of some dudes who like the same stuff i do. Don't know how to explain it but i get the feeling that i will like red fang for a long while even if solely on the fact that i want to hear what they currently sound like in a few years. They know good music and play good music, it's hard because some may argue they may not be unique but really when you listen to what they play you feel like a bunch of people you know hanging out together making music and they get along real well. Cheers to an awesome album. First album is good, don't get me wrong, but this album really took me by surprise in how awesome it is. It is the type of album that plays so well that you forget other types of music exists.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I like the way Kate Morton tells stories so thought I would like this book and I did! another interesting read on this time period!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Great product easy setup and delivery was as promised.  Definitely a positive transaction.  Replaced my wired Turtle Beach headphones for Xbox and was forever getting cords tangled.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|If you want my ratings on the other books then you will have to let this one go. I forget why I didn't like it.
0670023329|5.0|Harden's biography tells the tale of Shin Dong Hyuk, one man amongst thousands who are born behind the walls of a harsh North Korean political prison camp.  Heavily guarded and hidden deep in the mountains, Camp 14 is only one of several prison camps tucked into the frigid mountains of the world's strictest totalitarian nations.  Even years after his escape, Shin does not understand the meaning of love or sadness.  This chilling book will glue your eyes to its pages from the first page to the last.  If you even have a remote interest in human rights, this book is for you.  The author's depictions of the hardships that Shin, his family, and his fellow prisoners endure will make the hair stand up on your back.  It is also effectively laced with bites of North Korea's history that will help you understand how these modern-day concentration camps remain grounded in existence.  This book is not for the light-hearted, but I recommend it to everyone.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Cute and fun for my daughters, but beware! Before you know it you will start getting billed for stuff like \\"pile of gems\\", \\"pouch of gems\\", and \\"pouch of bits\\" that can set you back a few tens of dollars. Make sure you disable that option.  One star because it makes it really easy for a kid to start spending real money,
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is without a doubt, the best book I have ever read!!! I really loved it!!! The characters were so believable, the story was amazing!!!
B0087HT36U|5.0|this is a must play. you get to blow stuff up and tar people great game woooo hooo. get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome! most games that let you connect to facebook or just the internet in general only let you play when you have wifi. which i hate. but this game lets you play anywhere and still records your score so when you get wifi next you can see if you've beat any of your facebook friends! i would suggust everyone get this! and its no loss because its free!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I never read love stories, but since my friend told me how great the books were I decided to try.  I was wonderfully surprised.  There are parts in the book I didn't care for, but all in all I was very much taken in by the sexual and sensuality of the story.  I read all three in record time.  I thought the author did a great job of having a romantic, and exciting storyline.  I was definitely sad to come to the end of the third book, since I wanted it to keep going on.  I hope E.L. James writes more of this type of novel.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is a bunch of fun. its very additive...so hard to put down. my sons &amp; i fight over whos turn it is lmao
B009SQNNTC|4.0|Excellent picture quality with good plot.  Again, not as funny as I expected.  But, a good movie to watch with family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you don't believe me that this game is awesome.  then run in front of a bus.  if u still do t believe me then check out my review on temple run.  its like really far down.  its called temple run vs subway surfers.  btw subway surfers gives u more coins than temple run.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Disappointing.  I read a sample and got hooked.  As I conti9nued to read, I almost immediately started to dislike it.  Hard to empathize or like any of the characters.  I enjoy a good mystery, but not this.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Bonnie Raitt comes through again.  It took a few plays to really like it, but those types are likely to wear well over time.  Happy to add it to our decades long Bonnie collection.
B000I8ES70|1.0|The movie Resident Evil Apoloyscape just stop playing a minute into it.  Tell me,  How do I get a refund.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Examples - the extreme mismatch in crew personalities, the huge space inside of the spaceship, the lack of hazmat for the alien head, getting lost when they had extreme GPS capability.
B0086HGW42|5.0|Its a great album! I really did love some of the songs, especially the hidden track &#34;The parting glass.&#34; Buy it!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Great show, keeps you coming back for more, can't recommend enough!  HBO has done it again with this one! Epic!
6305128952|5.0|Huge fan of the book.... love love love Robert Redford! Ending didn't really live up to the book but it was still an excellent movie.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|My newest guilty pleasure game and I'm 50!  Can't wait until more levels are released.  Nice filler while waiting on Words with Friends.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|This app does everything it says.  I love it.  Highly recommend it if you want to  track the moon. It will show daily moon phase as well as full phase of the month.<br />You even get data on moon facts.  I find it very useful.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is one of the greatest game I've ever played Ner bothers are so cool. I died like fifteen times but it was still fun
B005LAJ1PE|5.0|This show is as creepy as it gets. From the opening credits with that music and images that will stick in your head for a while to the trippy story. I highly recommend it for all the horror fans out there.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|wish it were longer. the graphics were excellent. story line was interesting. the puzzles were not too difficult. hope there's a sequel
B0072OFOM6|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Interesting character development.  We thoroughly enjoyed this and can't wait to watch Season 3 when it comes out.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|Its your typical puzzle game but not as boring as most, took longer to figure out than expected but it was fun.  Played it a few times so far and I am keeping it on my phone for now.
0743517849|5.0|Really reprogrammed my attitude about spending money and saving for the future.  The author lays out the arguments for frugality and provides helpful examples
B00AECDDYY|3.0|Great game but it takes about 2min to start up and then when I hit ' begin' it stops and exits.<br />But it works on the 3rd attempt....
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I lost my mom 3 years ago and when I heard the description of this book I couldn't help but read it (even though I will admit, I did so with sarcasm, never expecting it to resonate - never expecting to be changed.) I was wrong.  Cheryl's words reached a place in me that I didn't know existed.  If you have ever lost someone close to you you know that you spend most of your mental energy trying not to think about it.  Trying not to let it effect you.  Cheryl opens you in a way that makes it easier to access that part of you. Before you realize it, you're opened up, vulnerable and exposed. And then she makes you feel the deepest parts of you that you struggle to keep covered.  I would recommend this book to all my fellow cynics with a hole in their hearts dug by loss.  This book is not a cure, but it is a roadmap to the lonely and hard road we must travel to discover our hurts, how they manifest in everyday life and how we overcome grief to become Queen of the PCT!  Two thumbs up!
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you like books with romance, action, and a dash of violence, then this whole series is for you.  Katniss and Peeta take a new step in their relationship. ************SPOILER ALERT*********** Especially when they are both entered into the Quarter Quell. It makes you never want to put the book down. A REAL PAGE TURNER. And with the surprise ending, you're gonna want to read Mockingjay.
1589949811|5.0|My 11 y/o son and I play all the time.  Excellent game, takes a little bit to learn the rules, but once you do it provides hours and hours of fun.
B005R9HK8O|5.0|I recommend this book to any would be aspirant for spiritual growth.  It is a story of transformation and growth.  It is a story of hardship and struggle.  It is a story of devotion and service. It is a story universal in nature.  This book was given to me early in life and i am forever grateful for it.  i return to it periodically for spiritual and mental nourishment. This book is &#34;good company&#34; to hang with. Solid!!
B0067EKY7M|5.0|This movie was genuine feeling, and very clean.  A surprise in today's market.  The scenery was great and the the acting very nice.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have only bought one book and although the money has been removed from my account, I cannot find my book. The only help I have received is to be told I must have done something wrong, and maybe I should try buying the book again. (for another $10.99) No Thanks!
1451695195|5.0|I read this book in 2 days! Very interesting. More proof of what I believe the Bible tells us about heaven.<br />My husband & pastor want to read next before I give to others to read.
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|All I can say is, I never saw the twist at the end coming! Great movie and I'll watch it over and over!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This is a more challenging version of angry birds.  There are so many elements that you have to consider to complete the levels.  I've spent hours playing this game!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't enjoy the ending whatsoever. I read the reviews before  purchasing, and it was pretty split. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but didn't hate it.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|When I was looking for a character named Frizzy,I was going to tap on her, but tapped on another character accidentally. I understand this was my own mistake, but I wish there was an option to &quot;undo&quot; my selection. I just wasted a LOT of coins on a character I didn't want!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Such quality acting!  We are lacking this in mainstream television and it is sad!<br />Downton Abbey is exemplary In all ways!
B008476HBM|5.0|The best characters, lessons, and humor. I'm always inspired by the upright character of the times, and the knowledge of human nature Austen displays is intriguing.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I looked forward to another Harry Bosch novel and was not disappointed with this one. True to character, Harry delivers a story that keeps you in suspence until the end.
0765325950|5.0|14 years I have waited to read this book. I was not disappointed. With this book Sanderson tops my list of favorite fantasy authors.  I cannot ask for any better end to this most amazing series.<br />Finishing someone else's work is a task not taken up without automatically scaring the existing audience. Naturally we worried that this would never be completed when Jordan woke from the dream. And then Worried again when this little known author took up the reins. Would the story feel right? Would Sanderson capture the essence of Jordan's world in the right way? And why three more books instead of the one Jordan promised? We felt all the things and more when tht day came.<br /><br />But Sanderson Accomplished the impossible. I am amazed at how well he handled this work. This is not only the last book, but the greatest of the series. A perfect and final ending to my favorite story. This was the gem at the end adventure, the horde of gold at the bottom of the rainbow. With this epic, the our patience is rewarded. This is truly the perfect ending.
030758836X|5.0|I did not read the book myself so just commenting on condition. It was perfect and the price was right.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I would only recommend this book to people who liked the movie War of the Roses.  Obviously not my kind of movie, definitley not my kind of book .<br /><br />I wished I had read the one and two star reviews before I purchased this book.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Interesting story about slavery in the US. Not the best story of its genre I ever read, but well-written. Story kept moving.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When reading a series, you can't wair to get to the conclusion.  The ending was satisfying, unlike some books where you want more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing.  The first person writing was spot on.  Tough subject handled so well.  Do Read this book!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|A light easy read but not one of Grisham`s best works.  Less than convincing story line with drug criminals who have ethics and an uneducated hick villain who doesn't go crazy with money.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I went through the series very quickly.  It was well written.  The characters were very real. I could not wait to read the last book.  Went right to Amazon and bought it for my Kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It` s full of suspense and lots of action, leaves you creating an ending before the ending.  Lovin it! Got the second book now.
B00785P2QC|5.0|very great game and a great time consumer. love to play when on the porcelain throne. very very very very very very very great game!
B0085A9J18|4.0|This is an interesting movie. Not a lot of twists & turns, but some great fight scenes & good suspense. Good action film & it is better watched with subtitles & in the original language.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I'm always looking for good games to get for my Kindle Fire to keep my grandkids busy when we go on trips. This one is a big hit with the 5yr.old. Easy to play and engaging enough to keep her attention. Graphics are cute, loaded on my Kindle very well. No complaints.
1594203334|5.0|I really liked this book. There are a lot of things that the French get right and parenting is one big area they excel! We as Americans can learn a lot about the way they educate their children. I also really appreciated the candor she had about the things she was unsure of and the reality of the stress and tiredness that new parents feel.<br /><br />I plan on reading this book again and again as my daughter grows up. Living in New Orleans, we have a few schools here that follow the creche schooling, which I love, but the food they serve is horrible. I hope the US understands what we feed our children has life long impacts on their nutrition.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I was surprised to read so many bad reviews. I guess I have been lucky. I have had no problems with it crashing, installing, or asking permission too many times. It has been pretty accurate and easy to use.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very good book series.  My son (12) and I enjoyed the story lines and the suspense of each book.
0790729709|5.0|I had this movieon Vhs and had to have it on dvd. Great movie with Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. Makes you laugh and it will make you cry.
B00095NX9G|5.0|This is a great DVD for expanding on and strengthening your abilities in Bellydance. For a lot of dancers, you may need to rewind on a few parts to fully understand how some combinations are structured but with a few practices they will come to you effortlessly. If you want to learn traveling steps, there is a great section on using different traveling steps with each movement so you can add some variation in to your dance choreography. All in all, this is a must for any bellydancer wishing to add fluidity and intricacy to their dance.
B004UOCF3W|5.0|My absolute favorite Foo album is \\"There is Nothing Left to Lose\\".  That being said, \\"Wasting Light\\" comes in at a very close second.  I love the Foo and saw them 3 times between November 2011 and September 2012.  They put on an AMAZING show and they played almost every song off this album.  If you are a fan of the Foo, this album is a must. This is definitely a rock album and a great one at that!
B005F3XV62|5.0|I like movies with animals. With the fact that these animals talk makes this movie even funnier. Kevin James always play in funny movies.
B004XZR63M|1.0|My mom gave me this book and begged me to go this guys seminars. This was after she left my \\"poor dad\\" and married a \\"rich dad\\" - I stayed with my \\"poor dad\\" after the divorce. Her new husband had made lots of money (millions) recruiting American professionals for Japanese companies. He was prudent, stable, and resourceful. he retired to focus on his real love of writing. A couple years later, After reading these books and attending his seminars I remember her and her new husband spending all this money on real estate and writing everything off as  \\"business\\" (we'd be at lunch and she would ask me my opinion on paint colors and then call it a business expense). Their attitudes completely changed, and they were pompous and looked down on everyone (hello she gave me this book - clearly showing her true feelings). Flash forward 10 years and new husband \\"rich dad\\" is back working 9 - 5 for 40k a year well in to his 70ies! On the other hand my real dad/\\"poor dad\\" continues to live his life one contract after another, doing what he loves (photography and PR), has a beautiful relationship with his children and enjoys everyday of his life.    Bottom line, they read this book, believed it, and got involved in s*** they didn't even understand (they lost all their investments to foreclosure). Further, they have horrible relationships with their children (his kids don't even talk to him) and my mom (a professional with a masters degree) will probably never get to retire.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Once you start reading it ... You can't put it down! The second part is as exciting as the first one.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|I say ther first Ghost Rider and had to see this one. Nicolas Cage is a great actor anyway. This movie has a lot of action in it.
0307594165|5.0|I am a big fan of Toni Morrison and have first edition copies of all of her books.  This one was a welcomed addition to my collection.  I always buy her books as soon as they are published.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I enjoyed the writer's attention to every detail. I could completely put myself in each character's shoes.  Wish I could have read it non-stop, but I had to take it in bits and pieces.
B000XSWVEC|4.0|i love this movie, but my only problem with it is that it was not the &#34;Special Edition&#34;. but all in all, i still love this movie.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  It was interesting and took up time on the flight home.  Very entertaining.  Just wish the sequel was free.
0375869026|5.0|I worried that this would not be an acceptable choice for my nephew, so I read it.  it is written from several different points of view, not just the kid's. The story is of a boy with a deformity who has been home schooled and will now be going to public school.  It tells not only his thoughts, but also how his sister feels about his deformity,and his new classmates thoughts and deeds.  It tells of insensitivity, sympathy, and even heroism.  A great read for a child  or an adult.
B009AXXI52|2.0|The CD's were not what I really expected.  It was  a dis appointment in every way.  Would not recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just started watching the show last week. I love it!!! I had to go back and get caught up with Seasons 1 & 2. It's all I've been watching over the last couple of days.
B008QMMEOE|3.0|My 2 1/2 year old grandson mastered this early on.  He put them together very quickly and did not become frustrated.<br />Karan
0307341550|5.0|This is much more mysterious, disturbing and dark than Gone Girl, but it retains all the twists and turns. Great read.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend reading this book.  It keeps you interested.  I never lost the entertainment level.  I felt as though I was there in the book witnessing the story happen.  When I'm done reading it I'd like to see the movie.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I got this for my Granddaughter, good movie, she loves it.  It is a good clean movie for kids. Thank you.
B001ANSS5K|4.0|A friend suggested this book after reading A Fault in Our Stars. Great, quick read.<br /><br />--SPOILER--<br /><br />The ending is relatively abrupt. The climax of the story hits about 5 pages before the end, which leaves the reader wanting more.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I purchased this miniseries because I don't have HBO and was looking forward to it.  I found the quality of the sound to be just about the worst I've ever experienced.  I kept having to increase the volume in order to hear the dialogue and even then it was mostly unintelligible.  The first 2-3 episodes were well done, I thought, but from that point on, it was not only the sound but the story line lacked continuity - some years had passed and the children were the same age as they were in the previous episodes, not having aged at all.  There appeared to be some padding of the lower lip region of Paul Giamatti which impaired his speech and often made his words unintelligible.  I was so unimpress with Episode 6 that I could not even finish watching it, so have not seen any of Episode 7 and doubt if I will ever watch it.  I think HBO could have done a much better job of this miniseries and presented more of the better side of John Adams instead of dwelling on the less desirable side.  Not worth the money I spent puchasing this miniseries and I plan to sell it a garage sale.
1607066017|3.0|This graphic novel has been described as 'Star Wars meets Romeo and Juliet,' and that's just about right. The plot has elements of grand space opera: the story is set against a vast interplanetary backdrop, filled with bizarre creatures that combine human elements with the surprising, the strange, and the grotesque. It's also a character-driven love story: the two main characters are lovers who come from different sides of a fierce war, and whose love is thus taboo. It's a love story in a less traditional sense, too, as these characters (Marko and Alana) have a newborn baby in the opening pages, and the story is equally about their parental love for their child.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about the story. It nicely combines gritty realism with hopeful, even naive optimism. The characters live in a brutal universe, which is portrayed in quite a bit of graphic detail - the story includes battlefield atrocities, mercenaries with (almost) no conscience, and even a planet that is a giant and bizarre sex emporium. Nevertheless, one of the characters is an extreme pacifist, and both retain a touching hopefulness despite their grim situation. Many side characters, too, are portrayed with nuance and care. Nevertheless, while the story is very good, there's something about it that doesn't fully grab me. I have a very hard time pinpointing just what's missing. Maybe it's the fact that the main characters strike me as idiotically idealistic at times, or maybe it's that the story is so ambitious and freewheeling that it can't always quite nail everything - I'm not sure.<br /><br />The artwork, however, is a real disappointment to me, for a few reasons. First and foremost, the backgrounds in every panel are done in a completely different style than the foreground. While the characters are always carefully inked and colored, the backgrounds are very washed out, and look highly digitized (even showing clear pixelation in some places), making for incongruity with the foreground. The backgrounds also almost entirely lack detail, which really disappoints me in a graphic novel that's exploring bizarre alien worlds. Second, I'm not a huge fan of the color palette. There are lots of browns and grays, which might in some ways fit the dismal mood of the story, but I'd prefer a richer set of colors to capture these interesting alien worlds. Finally, the characters look a bit flat on the page, because the shading is too subtle, providing an insufficient amount of contrast between shadowed and well-lit areas.<br /><br />That said, I do appreciate the range of human-like creatures that are drawn. We see creatures with spider-like bodies and humanoid heads; with human bodies and tv monitors for heads; with horns and wings; and lots more besides. The art shines when it's introducing these crazy beings.<br /><br />Overall, then, thumbs up for the interesting and character-driven tale, but the art often doesn't live up to the story.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|I bought this after my dad tired of me disappearing with his copy and I must say, I think I got the better end of the deal.<br /><br />For starters, as opposed to the original version of this DVD, the picture quality here is outstanding. There is a HUGE visible difference. Color and clarity are greatly improved. Also, this cut seems to have fixed the ratio problems that plagued the original (which, on some TVs, was simply not able to fit the screen without warping or being cut off). Another outstanding improvement is the fact that this version has a MENU. The original did not-- you would have to blindly skip through chapters wondering where you were.<br /><br /> As far as the apparently rampant sound gripes: I can hear no difference between this version and the original. No crime. It was never great (hello, recorded live in 1969 in a field?) but it's no worse here. I'm no audiophile but I can tell when something sounds wrong, and this does not. If anything, the background white noise has just been diminished a bit.<br /><br />I will say I'm wildly unimpressed with the packaging. I opened it to check out the discs when it arrived in the mail, and the piece that holds the first disc \\"floating\\" in the case quite literally just fell out. It appears to be recyclable, which is lovely if you plan on tossing it after you buy it (no?), but the flimsiness of the plastic actually makes me a bit scared to stash the case on my bookshelf between hundreds of others.<br /><br />Finally: my dad's original cut version was almost thirty bucks at B&N: Amazon blew them out of the water. Who WOULDN'T pay $9 to watch one of the most amazing group of performances ever and an incredibly significant part of music history, over and over? But that's beside the point.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this series. I like the way it uses the same actors to portray different characters in season 2. Deliciously creepy!
0399226907|5.0|I bought this book for my grandson. It is a cute story and sturdy so it should last a long time. I would recommend it to others.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I hate it when authors are so lazy and assume that their readers are so dense that they feel the need to write what their characters are thinking! get very annoying once you notice it.  I could only get to 20% of the book.  maybe the sex would make it so you don't notice the writting but I couldn't make it that far.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|I use it on my Kindle fire HD. On my wifi connection it goes to 720p so I'm loving it. It has all the channels and very little lag issues.
B009P13RQY|4.0|Good stuff going to check more of these guys albums out  \m/<br />Black Sabbath Motorhead area type Rock more modern....
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Love this App, it really helps me fall asleep.<br />Also great for stress management and meditation. Lots of sound options to mix.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I really enjoyed Old Man's War. It's a fun, smart, quick read with lots of action. I thought the concepts in this book were really thought provoking - for example, going to war in space after turning 75 and the way humans have invaded space and fight for territory. If you are looking for smart sci-fi that is light and fun to read, then this is the book you should pick up.<br /><br />I will definitely be checking out the rest of the books in this series.
0394401522|5.0|I love reading these, & have found the turkey prep one very useful.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Hatchi, based on a true story, tells the tale of a man and his dog, who are dedicated to each other. The cinematography is amazing. How the directors show Hatchi's aging and grief is incredible. I recommend you watch this movie with a box of tissues at your side.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|I was relatively into Smallville, at least in how it had its own voice apart from the comics and was entertaining. That being said, there were times its independence from the comics made Superman and his cast of supporting characters hurt it in the end. People into the romance element would be turned off by the action plot, and people into the action would hate the romance element.<br /><br />This show seemlessly blends the two. While it isn't perfect, the action scenes and the romance seems are well balanced. Chemistry and tension seem genuine, not forced. The villains in the show are not cartoony, yet don't seem to be dark for the sake of being dark. They accurately portray career criminals without being over the top.<br /><br />Overall I'd say it's worth a watch, for action/adventure fans and fans of romance.
0375413405|5.0|Love all her books.  So informative.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love this book. This book continued to keep me interested from beginning to end. I enjoyed all the twist and turns. I look forward to read more of the same authors books.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Very well written.  Looking forward to reading more books from this author.  Captured my interest from first page and I was sad when I finished the book.
B005RUV0NY|3.0|This is an okay series. I am not big on blood and gore and this series is.  I can't say there is any really great acting going on.  However, there is something a little addictive about the whole show.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|Great book. Bloody nine is back. Enough said. Great story with fast action and new characters and old ones too
B008KE3960|5.0|Its a new twist on a tower defense game in the respect that you have some control on where the planes go or what flight paths.they take.
0345803507|5.0|Wife loved the first two...had to have the third in the series.  Says she wishes they were hard cover. She loves this series.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is the best! I have been looking for a calculator like this in the Android market. Atlas, someone finally decided to create a real calculator with all the functions of a standard calculator. Great job.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Well worth a read. I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.  Ignore what others say about it starting slowly.  Buy it, read it, enjoy it.
B0030ZOYHC|1.0|I purchased this title because I enjoyed the television series. Seeing the price, I knew it was crazy not to buy it. Don't let the rating fool you, this movie is great. However, I have problems with the packaging. The Blu Ray I was sent looks nothing like the pictures on the product page. The cardboard cover hides how flimsy and disgusting the packaging is. It is one of those new Blu Ray cases with \\"economic\\" holes cut into it. I should have expected this for the price. However, this is not the worst part. The packaging promises a twenty page booklet is included. However, the only thing inside the flimsy case was a survey to Funimation. The false advertising was a real dealbreaker for me. I would be able to accept a flimsy packaging for what I paid, but changing the packaging and removing the booklet without even changing the back cover to reflect this makes me upset. Please rate this up so everyone who purchases this product will not be duped like I was.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|It was the never ending book....it should have ended 4 chapters earlier than it did...sorry to say that because I really like the John Grisham's other books but this one was a no go.
B007HGPBRC|5.0|There is so much talk about reading spiritual stuff and motivating yourself and finding inner peace and all that tripe. Mr. Hitchens left me gasping for breath with his honesty, sincerity and candidness of all his emotions and moods. Always, had the highest regard for him. After this book, I think, he truly was one of the finest thinkers of our time. Its tragic, that, he is no longer amongst us.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|All of my 7 kids loved it! As soon as it was over, they watched it again. Even my husband and I were into it. A movie for the whole family.
B003XF1OJK|3.0|I bought the original Halo trilogy in hopes to write a paper on the hero archetype and Master Chief. This first book has been decent, and I didn't have to plod through, but the second book (by a different author) is terrible.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book was so helpful in understanding myself and my spouse. I see the reasons for our difficulties. I look forward to my husband reading it so that he can learn as well. I have recommended this book to so many, even before I finished it. I knew that the insight I was receiving was great and wanted to share with others what I had learned and hope that their relationships would be better as well. Thank you Dr. Chapman.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have just finished reading George R R Martin's A Dance with Dragons for the second time, in anticipation of the next book in the series. Martin is one of the best writers I've had the privilege to read. In his work, the real story is not always what you think it is, and he is never predictable. He is a master of misdirection and subtlety, salting his narrative with clues to the real meat of the story. The reader thinks to be reading the main plot wherein Martin sows a seed that grows bit by bit into a subplot, as Martin artfully nurtures it with hints from a character's memory and fragments of the realm's history. Gradually, the plot and subplot are transposed, with the subplot becoming recognizable as the main event. His world is rich with detail, rife with conflict, burdened with both imaginable and unimaginable problems and challenges. His characters are fully fleshed--some coming across as completely vile, conscienceless, and remorseless, but most with both good and bad qualities. I find myself revising my opinion of several of the characters whom I originally viewed as evil but now am beginning to view as possible heroes. Likewise, some characters I assumed were basically good have proved to be something less than good.<br /><br />A Dance with Dragons does not stand alone. It must be read only after reading the four preceding books in the series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Martin skillfully builds tension and then leaves us with a wealth of questions at the end of Dance. The various story lines have so many open possibilities that I am on pins and needles wondering and anticipating how they will all play out, imagining the possibilities, hoping for certain outcomes that one definitely cannot count on from Martin. I can't wait for the next book in the series. This is my favorite fantasy series, and I highly recommend it as great and entertaining reading.
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|This movie has a a really good story plot.  I did some research, and I found that this is based on a series of books.  I may just have to get the books as well.
159562015X|2.0|I bought this book with a view to using it with my high school students.  It is not suitable for this age group due to the language used, but is really interesting for my own use.  The value of the book is only able to be fully utilised if you are able to do the assessment.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|The CGI on this one SUCKS!!!!  Big Time!!!!  I was expecting a live action movie when I heard of this sequel to the sequel to the sequel of the original.  I was totally disappointed with both the CGI and the storyline and really wish I hadn't wasted the money I spent on it.  :(
B008EQIEWS|4.0|If your into Greek mythology, then this is a good representation of it.  It does a really good job with the visuals.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I have enjoyed every Lee Child book with Jack Reacher getting himself in the most impossible and finding his way to resolve and start walking again.  Child is my favorite author, along with Demille.....
0743270754|4.0|I enjyoed the book and its good history facts. Maybe I missed when he did the emacipitation procerss.<br />I brought me right into the time. Good facts and isights,'I would recommend it.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|A Wonderful soundtrack to a great movie.<br /><br />I love having all the great music from this awesome movie. A Hit with anyone who loved the movie!
B000FA5STS|5.0|I loved this story.  The characters were excellently written, didn't want to put it down.  Can't wait to read another book by David Baldacci.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This movies is exceptional.  I love it.  Robert Downey Jr. could not be replaced.  PERFECT part for him.  Comical and drama.  Hope they keep making these Sherlock Holmes movies.
B0011UF79C|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband who kept looking for this movie with no luck. He was happy to receive it and it was a great movie.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|My friend showed me this game on his phone, he let Me play it and wow It guessed everything right. At first I thought this app was just lucky that time. But no. I got this app and WOW It guessed everything right yet again. I tried everything from Mario to star fox and to a bunch of other characters I don't remember. And every single one was correct! Kudos to Elokence and a lot of<br />it.
B002ZG997C|2.0|Purchase the DVD because it had a Chinese Crested dog in it.  Once I got the movie and watched it I was pleasantly surprized.  Very good film.  Video of the Chinese Crested lasted about 2 seconds.
0143034901|5.0|I first read this book in French while living in France.  I loved it and wondered if I would like it as much in English (I did not like &#34;The Hedghog&#34; nearly a much in the English translation as I had liked the original &#34;L'Elegance du Herrisson.&#34;)  But I was not disappointed:  it was just as good in English, so I recommenfed it for my book club and it was very well received.  Good choice for a book club as we are all lovers of books and reading.
B0054X3FQO|5.0|Miranda's book isn't just for women. As a male fan, I feel like I can resonate with her advice and life experiences. Despite how most of us perceive her to be so perfect, she opens up to us about her struggles growing up and in her modelling career. She's just an ordinary girl like everybody else.<br /><br />The book is filled with positive messages about being the best person you can. Miranda talks a lot about self-esteem, confidence, health, passion, happiness, relationships, gratitude, and a whole lot more. Everybody can benefit from the advices given. This was even a good reminder for me on stuff that I already know.<br /><br />Contains some pics and a collection of positive affirmations at the end too.<br /><br />Good read!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|She is as warped as the writer of another EBook I just bought from Amazon: [[ASIN:B00ATQQHJS Zen and the Art of Cat Teasing]] Where do these people come from?  Those thoughts never enter my head, though I wish they did . . . thank God for funny people.  I feel like whatever I spend on humorous books is just part of my grocery expense - gotta laugh to live, same as eating.  And Tina's impersonation of Palin was so good my sides hurt from watching her on SNL.  I love this woman.  The female Mark Twain of modern times.  And my husband thinks she's hot, the dog.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I can't recommend a book any more highly than The Phoenix Project. Gene and Co. have managed to write, describe and apply a entertaining story to everything that I've been thinking but unable to name or express clearly about the importance and place of IT within a business. You will see yourself or will know people who are just like each of the characters and the situations they find themselves in. As I've been in my new work role the last few months I can't help but feel like my life is starting to mirror Bill's in the early phases of his new job - hopefully without the worst he deals with in my future.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book is a hilarious and funny book and it talks about how Rodrick has a party  with all his high school friends.
1475143389|4.0|was an interested book to read and still refer to it occasionally,learned some very interesting facts and was easy to understand
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Beautiful graphics and great idea for adventure game.<br /><br />My problem was I could't play without the in-game hints. My poor memory had me going back and forth constantly. Also I had to go on line and read cheats to get past the hard spots.  This took a lot of the fun out of the game for me.<br /><br />Map should be interactive and there's too much jumping between screens. Wish they'd fine tune the game.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Looper is a good science fiction movie. Although somewhat complex at times, it is a real thinker. It holds your interest up to the end. Well worth watching.
B005UDD1R6|4.0|A great app for music and videos.  After downloading to my kindle fire he I am able to hear music previously downloaded from my pc that wouldn't play
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Such a sweet story about 2nd chances and being able to live and love. This made me believe in love
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've never gotten into a book. It's the best book I've ever read. Very detailed and leaves you wanting more with every chapter
B008XG1X18|5.0|One of the best apps I have so far.  Very easy to use and so much information to be found on here
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I am a Patricia Cornwell fan and have several other Cornwell novels lined up to read but for some reason The Bone Bed was not a page-turner for me.  In places, she seemed to go on and on about personal issues to the point of boring.  It was not a total loss as there were sections that demanded I keep reading and I did finish the book.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I feel like the author threw you into the book and carried you along a journey. As you went threw the book you started to feel for August and in the end he was practically your little brother I enjoyed it so much I will definitely read more of this author.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good story revealing different aspects of law as practiced by ambulance chasers and big corporations as well as influence peddling in DC.  As a retired corporate General Counsel I have enjoyed the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've yet to see an episode I didn't love!  The story line and characters are wonderful!  Each season is better than the last!
B000GG4Y3M|5.0|just what i wanted my experience went very smooth, no problems with anything, will use company again  ........can not think of any more words
B0063GORYU|4.0|this game is fun when you play in a car for a long trip. I enjoy being able to change the card faces and the background.
1582701709|5.0|This book changed my life !! I truly enjoyed it and I try and apply it to my everyday living
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Great! I love the unpredictable happy ending and all the drama that occurred during the story. I can relate to it. I just love it.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|It was great and nice at the same time in my opinion that the first time since I was able to read
B0057ZAA6W|5.0|The item is exactly as pictured - it came on time and packaged well. It will be a great gift.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so amazing it made me think about a lot of things in a different way. I am so glad u read this book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay. Wow. That was definitely the funniest, saddest, and most insightful book that I have ever read. Where I usually read adventure and fantasy and manga and classics,  this was so directly meaningful and realistic. Where Van Houten went from inspirational to a dick to probably my favorite character next to Isaac, who hated life and made it better. And then to Hazel, who was tough and made such a horrible situation a moderate one. And Augustus who gave Hazel freedom, strength and courage. I can't imagine anyone buying and reading this book.
B00127RAJY|5.0|The item is exactly as pictured - it came on time and packaged well. It will be a great gift.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|This is a great book for people or teens how love Justin it's like your traveling with him and watching him record his songs for his albums and me I AM BELIBER
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm so torn in reviewing this show. Season one was outstanding! And the beginning of this season was just as good, but I'm waiting to give my final review until the finale. Only reason is because they are starting to lose me. I watch alot of stuff... Alot! And I can handle weird and demented, as a matter of fact, I usually like it, but these past few episodes... They are starting to get even to me. I'm hoping that by the end I'll be able to look back and think okay, its all justified, but that is yet to be seen. For right now, I'll just say, if you've got a strong stomach, this is a great show, just keep your mind open... Way open!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game.  It keeps me so intertained while im doing brain exercises.  Everyone who likes fun brain games should get this app, and best of all; its free!
0470913029|5.0|Easy to read, quick read.  Diet makes sense and easy to follow.  I have lost almost 20lbs and I've hardly exercised.  I expect better results once I fully commit to a workout routine.
B00846REIS|1.0|I fell in love with the Fifty Shades trilogy and have read it numerous times. I was ready to move on to something else but wanted to stay in a similar genre so I started to do my research. Long story short, I came across this book and first read the 1 star reviews. Boy were they correct! I can't even get past chapter 5 b/c this book is so awful! I went with my stubborn gut thinking there are so many 5 stars, surely it has to be good. Ha! Trust me, the characters are boring with no real background so you don't feel for any of them. Yes, I haven't delved deeper in the book but that should say something right there. I couldn't put the Fifty Shades trilogy down and read it in 5 days. I can't make myself read this book, which really sucks since I paid for it.<br /><br />Trust me and trust the other 1 star reviews, don't purchase this book if you're looking for something like Fifty Shades. You will be highly disappointed. Please don't waste your money.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Oh God. It was great until the ending. Its that whole hipster, nihilist, self-loathing philosophy that life would be better if you didn't exist. C'mon. Yes it was good sci-fi, yes it was well acted and directed, but the story was Just. Completely. Lacking.<br /><br />Compare this to say 12 Monkeys, no comparison. Its like they didn't know what to do at the end, so they took a dive off the cliff and figured they'd make money anyways with the cast.<br /><br />...<br /><br />Wouldn't have watched it if I had known.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The ads that pop up in the beginning are tricky to get past. The developers seem to go to great lengths to force you to click into the ad. Take your time and either tap, double tap, swipe somewhere in page or look for a micro skip ad announcement. Maybe the next step will be to add an invisible single pixel that you have to click to get by the ad.
B00000IREA|5.0|the package arrived in great timing. the packaging was great no damaging to item. the dvd played well. good buy.
B00AY9RV90|4.0|Technically 'Lost Sirens' is a new album by New Order.  Actually, the songs are old(er).<br /><br />All eight songs were recorded during 2005's 'Waiting for the Siren's Call' (one of their overall best disks) sessions. While not included on that eight year old disk, the intent was to include them on the follow-up, which never happened.<br /><br />In the last half decade (plus), Peter Hook allegedly left the band in 2007 and Bernard Sumner said he no longer wanted to work with / as New Order.  In 2011, some of the original members reunited along with a new member or two.<br /><br />I'd say 'Lost Sirens' was released quietly, but it is the U.S. and unless you spend your time in dance clubs (I do not), where else would you know that New Order had \\"new\\" music?<br /><br />...and it is New Order, so while I enjoy their sound, it is not radically different album to album - and 'Lost Sirens' is no exception.  Overall.<br /><br />Starting off with \\"I'll Stay With You\\", it is classic / typical Order. Not a bad thing. The light guitar and the underlying synth, the similar drum beat and the all too familiar Sumner vocals. It is like visiting a good friend. Comforting and no surprises. As stated, this is not a bad thing.<br /><br />Ditto with \\"Surgarcane\\"  \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is good enough, but nothing you're going to remember forever.  ....and let's face it, I remember a lot of their music.<br /><br />The two most interesting songs are \\"Hellbent\\" and and the very moody \\"I Told You So\\".<br />\\"Hellbent\\" has way more guitar on it than most songs they've ever recorded.  This is a good thing.  \\"I Told You So\\" has an early New Order or even Joy Division feel to it.  It is a good album closer.<br /><br />Like any album, there are a few clunkers - but when you only have eight songs on a disk, you shouldn't have more than one.  They do.<br /><br />\\"Shake it Up\\" starts sooooo badly. You almost have to get to the two minute mark before it hits its stride. But I like it after that. Still two minutes is a long time to wait.<br /><br />\\"California Grass\\" kind of bores me.  To take a line from the song itself \\"I can't describe\\", but it just kind of sits there. There is a late '60s vocal vibe that runs through it, maybe to emulate music coming from that state back at that time.  Or maybe I'm must thinking too much about it.<br /><br />As it stands, 'Lost Sirens' isn't bad, but it is not standing up there with their stellar work. You can see why they opted not to include some of these songs on the original release, but some of them could have easily fit into that playlist.<br /><br />Yet, I bought it, because I think I've purchased every new release New Order has put out. And even if some of the songs aren't stellar, they are better than most things that hit the airwaves, so why not give it a chance.<br /><br />I suppose that is the good thing about iTunes and amazon - you can purchase individual tracks, but I'm still a full album guy.two minutes is a long time to wait.<br /><br />\\"California Grass\\" kind of bores me.

B0034G4OUO|5.0|the dvd arrived in great timing. packaging was great no damaging. the sound and movie played great. would tell others to buy.
1449410243|4.0|I do feel like this is the most important book I've read this year, but I was disappointed that it didn't cover the phenomenon of cats stealing computer thumb drives. I've caught my cat Guy, who is an anarchist, in the act of stealing a thumb drive, after I had \\"lost\\" two of them. I've asked Guy repeatedly about the missing drives but all he does is meow that when the revolution comes, all cats will have thumbs, and they will need thumb drives. Other than this glaring omission, the book contained very useful information about the warning signs to heed when living with cats, and the poster was a nice addition to the text.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Thus book is very true to real life and its uncertainties<br />. SLAMMED is very inspirational and touching. Highly recommend, but be ready to shed a few tears.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Saw this first on my local PBS station.  Knew I must have it and purchased as a Christmas gift.  The cast is wonderful!  If you love Les Miz, you will want this.  Extra special moment at end of production when the Original 1985 London cast comes out for bows and a few songs.  Can't say enough about this production.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game really showed its potential with good gameplay and graphics storyline was impressive following from the dark knight story free roaming around the world was like batman arkham city this game is a recommend to all u people and reviewers
B009UX2YAC|5.0|New vampire character<br />Nighttime<br />Wall papers<br />Able to make a character of your own<br /><br />O love this game so please  consider the above.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the hunger games it's one of the best books I have ever read, anyone who likes action and romance read this book. THANK YOU SUZANNE!:)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't think anything more needs to be said. It is perfect and you should read it. I'm seriously speechless.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this on every device I own. It is great for gathering any kind of note & then making it searchable!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the perfect game for horse lover's not like those non animation one where all you do is click around the screen,  no this is an amazing game! highly recommended to all ages!
B000641D2Y|5.0|i love this movie and it was worth buying it! the movie is great quality and the dvd was in good quality! so worth it!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|A fantastic book that is typically Nelson DeMille.  I was completely grabbed by the mystery and couldn't wait to finish it and then I was sorry it was over.
B001F12J48|1.0|I just upgraded to the new 3D TVs, and wanted to get a movie to test it out.  I did a search on Amazon for &#34;3D&#34; movies, and this one popped up.  Great movie, so why not?  Well, turns out it's the old version of 3D, with the red and blue glasses.  So, if you're looking for the new technology, this is not the movie you want.
B00A993UWM|5.0|She's the same as ever -- in your face and catchy as can be. Took a few days but I fell in love with this album. Great pump up music, and interesting to boot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game, it is easy to play, and didn't cost very much.  I give it a 5 star rating. Keep up the good work..
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|we love this movie it has turned into a timeless classic at my house I don't have much more to say about this
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was not quite what I expected. The character development is quite good, and the story line is riveting. And as for the, um, intimate parts...excuse me, is it getting warm in here?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book was nice it took a crazy idea, too people getting married but not knowing they were getting married, and made it seem realistic. It was a nice &#34;Keep yourself busy&#34; type of story.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Cute movie - cute story, cute characters. Darn, can't believe an old f....... like me saying this. See it, think you'll agree - cute!
B00571F26Y|5.0|Some really interesting information here. I'm looking forward to starting this journey! Will be referring to the food lists and recipes often.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|If you consider slow motion, graphic presentation of body parts being ripped off by bullets and indiscriminate killings as entertainment than this movie is for you. Obviously, by all the posted reviews here, there are a lot of sick people around!
B0086700CM|3.0|the reason I want temple run 2 is beacause everybody has that game in my school,and feel soooooo left out because they all have ipads and iphons,and for some reason apple always tats the best apps first.I'm thinking about swiching to apple technogagy just because of that.aneroid has to keep up,or I'm swichen.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Good read and incredible story! The love there is true and genuine. Hard book to put down. Recommended read for all!
B005LAII12|4.0|This movie was hilarious!  The bear is so lovable so you couldn't get mad with him for being obnoxous and vulgar.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is the only book I've read that has really made me want to cry. Because it is such a realistic story that it could be a high school boy's autobiography, I love it! It makes me think of my friends and the things they've told me that they want for their future. Although this night have not helped you to understand the plot of The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, it is written to share my personal feeling  on the book.
0765325950|4.0|Just finished, and very pleased. I personally think Sanderson could not have done better with the material he was given. If he had taken more time it would have become too much his. Had he followed the previous path too closely, he would have been stuck in the traps Jordan created in his last few books. In the end, the teamwork of two men who never really worked together made the end of the story triumphant. Laughing, cheering, sorrow, pretty much what you would expect here. It's not perfect, but neither is the Pattern, and that's just fine. We got the ending, and it was a fun read. Thank you!<br /><br />PS - I agree Harriet really shouldn't have delayed the e-book, it was a pain carrying that tome on the for bus the past week, but I'm not going to be petty and knock of stars for that. This review is for the story. :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is a fun game with nice graphics! I love playing it! This is a game for all ages. Fun playing alone or with my Grandchildren.
B0057LUI0O|5.0|It is a fun movie with great music. And my 19 month old granddaughter loves it.  No matter how many times I watch it with her, the music is great, the characters are very engaging and the story line is very good.  It is now a family favorite.
B00633W614|5.0|I didn't want to quit reading!  Excellent character development and weaving of their individual and collective stories.  I seldom recommend books to others, but I have promoted this series.  I've already pre-ordered the third book, and I can't wait for it to be published!
B000641D2Y|5.0|So glad I found this movie. This movie brings back a bunch of childhood memories. Thanks so much. I am so happy..
B000002U6E|5.0|The CD was packed good and delivered rather quickly, the price was amazing!  I really love this CD too the music is great.  I have always loved Enigma.  I paid very little for the CD, with shipping it came to $2.99 , the CD is great condition, very happy with this vendour.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Some of the games are hard to figure out. I will continue to work on it when time allows.<br />Fun.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|When I think about Mitch, the words, brilliant, wisdom,Poet,and master of the English language come to mind.<br />THE TIME KEEPER AND ALL OF HIS BOOKS. I have read most of his books and will continue to read his books.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I found it to be too easy, I need more of a challenge. It was like they were giving you hints all the way through.  Entirely possible that I missed something but I didn't care for it.
B004US4K2C|1.0|I downloaded this twice but it never showed up. I searched the APP store for it but to no avail.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids enjoy playing the variety of games included and like unlocking the new ones.  They all have their favorites so it means hours of fun. Thanks for building such a varied collection in this application.
B005LAII80|5.0|I'd heard about this movie on the internet and everybody saying it was a must see in the theater, but I spaced out seeing it and missed the chance. This movie had virtually no advertising, and went in and out of cinemas really fast.<br /><br />I rented it, and was blown away how good it was! The only thing is I really wished I had gotten to see it in the theater because this is a great spectacle/big-screen movie, especially in 3D.<br /><br />Other reviewers have already covered all the great stuff I liked about the movie, I just wanted to say that after renting it and watching it three times in a row, I decided to buy the blu-ray here in hopes that if there are enough DVD/Blu-Ray sales, they'll be able to make a sequel. I REALLY want to see Dredd and Anderson in a sequel!<br /><br />One thing I would like to point out is I thought Lena Headey's performance as Ma-Ma was really good, especially considering the small amount of screen time and few lines she had to work with. She captured the psychotic nature of Ma-Ma perfectly! And the actor that had the bionic eyes was great too! I really felt sorry for his character.<br /><br />A great action flick that I really hope gets the sequels it deserves!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|like the variety, though you have to unlock everything. a lot of fun if u want to play different arcade games
B000244FDW|4.0|The DVD worked perfectly, was brand new, and I liked this Mr. Darcy & Elizabeth better than Colin Firth & Jennifer Elthe from the A & E version...Liked the newest version with Keira Knightly and, the very handsome Micheal McFaydden  better than all the rest..that version Is by far the most romantic, and the scenery breathtaking..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If I love temple run then I love Sub Way Suffers. It's just like Temple Run except it's in a Sub Way. Any one who likes Temple Run you'll love Sub Way Surfers.
B001NHNG64|5.0|better than cussler, clancey, connely, or Flynn and I've read allthese other paperback heroes and loved every minute of it once you start reading a reacher novel you CAN NOT  put it down iwill be reading every one I can find keep them coming mr child
B0042816YK|4.0|Well done. Actors great.I really don't know what else I can say about this. It was entertaining for sure. Nice.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Much better than book one. Good story line, some areas could use more details though. There is less eroticism in this book, which gives way to the good story line.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Easy to use on my Kindle Fire yet comprehensive enough when I need it. Plus it's nice and big, both the keys and the display
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved how it tied in from book 2. Wasn't keen on the ending though. Glad it's a 'happy ever after' however it ended very abruptly. I hope author comes out w/ story from Christians perspective.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Goodness!  This is a roller coaster of emotion, with highs, lows, love, sadness, humour, fear, connection, lessons, truth,pain, joy, life. Loved this one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I enjoyed reading this series. I love a book where I don't want to put the book down. If you've seen the Hunger Games movie(or movies if reading this later down the road), you have HAVE to read the book. The book explains so much more that didn't even make it to the movie. Course everyone says that...&#34;The book is so much better than the movie.&#34; This is definitely true when it comes to the books. The characters personalities come alive and are more likeable. A must buy and a must read.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I Loved it. I actually read the whole series quite quickly.  I'm picturing a future movie or two.  Great series.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I can' t get the program to operate.  There does nor seem to be any relation to other applications I' 've used and this program.  I' ve tried four or five times to enter data and can' t.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this one shows everything you need and it's pretty accurate. i like the radar part so i can see exactly where the storm is
B001QVFDA4|4.0|enjoyed this move more than I thought I would. It kept you guessing on what would happen next. Worth a watch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Certainly helps me to keep in God's word wherever I am.  I like the reading plans and being able to bookmark and highlight.
B004WY2M8I|5.0|This is a must-read book. The kindle version is great because the original paperback weights a ton and is hard to carry around. This book will rip your heart out
B004P98QZ8|5.0|My son love this game. It too him 3 days to set it up. My son said this is the best gift ever. That made me so happy.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|My 3yo niece loved it and only found the swarm of fish at the beginning scary but she got over it fast enough.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|George's life is inspiring.  He made the effort to grow spiritually which is not an easy path to take, especially for a person as famous as he was.
B007CGSUMK|5.0|This is a must have. It is a perfect gift to a 8 or 80-year-old. Love it! Love it! Love it!
0765325950|3.0|I have enjoyed this series immensely and I think that Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job with what he was hired to do. I will attempt to write this with as few spoilers as possible, but there will be some...<br /><br />1) To many sub-plots and story arcs left incomplete without any explanations.<br />2) Rand's exit at the end of the book was anticlimactic, throughout he was portrayed as 'family is the most important' and then portrayed that he understood that he must 'care' instead of being hard and calloused. Then he leaves his family, especially his new children behind to 'see the world'. I do not buy it. I am not one that believes he should have been killed off to round out the story, but that would have been better than this ending.<br />3) The fight with the Dark One very dissatisfying, I will leave it at that.<br />4) This other army that appears with Demandred was lame and unbelievable.<br />5) The Ogier Gardeners were completely left out of any story line, I could think of a whole separate plot involving the Ogiers from this side of the ocean, especially when they are seen fighting in the last battle...<br />6) The three different challengers to Demandred in single combat, really unbelievable, it should have been just Lan.<br />7) The Amyrlin's last stand (you will have to read it, do not want to spoil) very poorly conceived, needed more flushing out on this new weave that should have been known if it truly was the 'flame of Tar Valon'.<br /><br />Brandon did a great job and I enjoy other books that he has written, I am just severely disappointed with this last book to the WoT series, I know that RJ had everything lined up and Brandon just implemented his wishes, but I cannot give this book the 5 stars that I wish I could have.<br /><br />Side Note: For all of those with the 1 star rating for the lack of ebook, please consider using the request for a kindle version link instead of the rating system to voice your displeasure and after you have read the book please consider changing your review to reflect what you thought of the books content.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a really long time can't wait to start the third book :)
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|as with all clancy books, it is way above most authors, but this one could have been about 1/3 shorter for the story.  because of this, there were pages where it dragged, but it was still a good book.
B008602KQI|4.0|We ordered this movie over Christmas and enjoyed watching it. It arrived in a timely manner and was a great movie for the whole family.
B007L6VR12|3.0|Strange and sometimes it borders on weird  and then again there is an ultimate beauty in this piece of fiction. Well acted with a few of Hollywood's best and the boy in the lead role is going to go a long way if he doesn't lose his natural personality. I was close to giving it four stars and changed my mind. Pg 13 is the right rating for this film.
B003UYV08E|4.0|We really enjoy watching The Iron Man series. It's a good movie for kids and adults.  We ordered it for Christmas and it arrived in a timely manner.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|overall, good viewing even on my kindle.  sound and occasionally the picture was less than adequate.  would, nonetheless, recommend but only with a good quality headset.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The show is fun and a great twist on our childhood stories. Hope they keep it going for a while.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|A mix of history, mystery and intrigue. A great story that keeps you turning pages until the very end. Great!
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Fast, great visuals, area friendly, accurate.....lots of cudos.  Enough information to satisfy even the most weather-conscious person.  Easy to use for sure.
B000002KE2|3.0|I really like this album, but I just \\"like it\\" its really not anything super special like Sabbaths first 3 albums.  But its a good listen, but if you are not really a die hard Sabbath fan and you just want to check them out, you should probably just pick up their first 3 albums are a Greatest Hits package.  Greatest Hits 1970-78 started me out. If you are a die hard fan pick this up!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I enjoyed the story but use of wrong words, waist instead of waste for example, in several places was irritating.
B000002KDO|5.0|Sweet Leaf! Children of the Grave! Incredible body of work, and Iommi even puts some eclectic acoustic Sabbath in here.  Great album!
B005LAIH3G|4.0|This movie surprised me.  After waiting until John Carter hit video, I sat down to watch, telling my wife we could turn it off if it was as bad as we had heard.  After sitting through the entirety of this wonderful film without leaving our seats, which we never do, we had to ask each how this was such a failure at the box office (this is not a film for critics, so who cares about them in this case).  From start to finish this was the second most fun I've had watching a movie all year (Avengers was my #1).  Now, I haven't read the books, so how well this translates the source I don't know (or care really).  A movie is NOT a book, so anyone looking for that, go read a book.  As a thrilling adventure that has it's feet firmly placed in the past while taking every advantage possible of modern special effects John Carter is a spectacularly fun film.  The entire cast was excellent, especially Taylor Kitsch who plays Carter as a man with nothing left in him but a hope that gold will fill the void within.  The worst part of the movie is the end title which implied more films would follow (which is now obviously out of the question).  If you didn't give this one a chance and like a little old school flavor in your action films, or just a fun filled romp, don't let it pass you by.

B001GCUNYO|5.0|I loved this movie the first time I saw it in the theatre, and I will pop in Taken every so oftern moving forward. Loved the second as well, and I hope they do a third.
B0062KMDZ2|4.0|I was disappointed that they wanted us to believe that only ONE dinosaur existed and that was in a cave?!!!  Come on.  We know that when we go to the Center of the Earth there will be more dinosaurs than that!  Decent 3D though and worth the purchase.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I could not put the book down. It is an amazing twisted thriller. The ending will leave you unsatisfied, dumbfounded that someone could get away with something so horrible.  Love it!
B004YOEFG8|5.0|When I want to run a relatively short video to show my friends what 3D on a home TV should look like, THIS is the video that I pull out.  Additionally, it has a good story-line of the last Hubble Repair Mission with great shots.  Well worth the purchase for any 3D library.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I didn't expect to really like this book since it was available for free (I haven't had much luck in this department), but I found myself wrapped up in this book. I couldn't put it down! Really cute. I loved the characters and you could really feel the chemistry between them. I would definitely recommend it for someone looking for an easy, stress free, romantic read.
B004ZISVWC|4.0|How this showed up in my list of things to Rate is beyond me.  I never ordered it or had it show up on my account as having purchased it.  I'm wondering if the grandkids watched it on Amazon Videos.  Does that cause it to show up for me to Rate in this list?  I have watched the movie in the past and it is actually a good movie.  It is so different that it keeps you watching it to the very end.  I thought it was very well done.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Just when you think this story line cant get any crazier.....guess what? You are left picking your jaw up off the floor. And when you say to yourself, &#34;WOW, THIS CAN'T GET ANY BETTER.&#34; It shocks you more and more each episode. You catch yourself eagerly watching the calendar to see what day it is,  to watch this, and when you get down to the day that it airs, you find yourself counting down the hours. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!! I will admit that its probably not for everyone because its bizarre and violent at times. But, give it a chance. I think this show is ground breaking.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|This was an amazing film. I didn't read the comics, so I can't make comparisons. But this was one of the greatest DC animated movie that has been released. Dark, poignant, and novel.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book started out well and had me hooked pretty early.  Then all of the issues with the main character just got too weird and started to annoy me.  I loved the information about meanings of flowers, but Victoria's story was too over the top and became ridiculous after awhile.
B00280LYIM|4.0|More romance but still a great story with lots of twists I enjoyed though it's not my favorite one .
B00992CF6W|4.0|it was great but you cant make armour and enemy's are harder to kill.another problem is that you cant get infanet land.one good thing is that you spawn near your house if you die and not far away like in Pc version.play it and you will enjoy it.
B005MWPW86|4.0|If you admire Craig as I do, this book is in interesting look into his life.  It made me feel a little depressed at how boring my life has been in comparison.  Craig isn't a professional writer and there is nothing profound here, but it kept me reading from start to finish.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love it!  Slightly addicted now, need to get some things done, but cannot stop messing with this game. Only issue, tutorial runs a bit long.
B009EAO38C|5.0|I like the combination of of piano and cello to cover some modern songs. Although, I like them to cover some oldies too. Overall, very good to listen at work or to relax.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|I would probably give the story alone 4 stars, but the number of spelling and grammar mistakes in this book made me crazy. Most of them seem to fall into the category of problems with apostrophes, but that's not exclusive. Read at your discretion...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My teenage nieces ask me what 'my guilty pleasure' was, and I told them Downton Abbey! I showed them an episode from my computer and did they become fascinated! Beautiful settings, great acting, great directing! Love It! I am thrilled the new season is here.
B005LCYR7Y|2.0|first third a good read then it waffles along to a very mundane yawnable ending. Disapointed given the many positive reviews.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a very good book, the author tells his story in good old boy down to earth terms that give the reader an appricaition for the situaitons and dangers in faced.
B001RNO7BM|5.0|This is a very nice light-duty water-proof shoe.<br /><br />My goals for this purchase were all-weather safety and comfort.  I have used these shoes in rain, snow and ice and found they provide good traction in all situations.  The &#34;e-vent&#34; air circulation system seems to be effective at reducing the internally generated moisture (from sweat) that is common to waterproof shoes.  The leather is soft and required only a few hours of &#34;break-in&#34; to become all-day comfortable.<br /><br />I do not consider this shoe to be sturdy enough for serious hiking (with a pack) but they are fine for an extended woods walk and make a great daily-wear shoe for inclement weather.<br /><br />The only down-side was that I had to keep exchanging undersized examples until I arrived at a shoe labeled one full size larger than my usual size. Since I purchased directly from Amazon fulfillment, all the back and forth shipping was free.  I'm glad that I persisted because this is a very comfortable and safe shoe.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Good, but  not as good as the sixth book, or the fourth ended a little to quick for me,  e
B009MO57H6|3.0|Even though I knew she wasn't in this movie, all the way through I kept hoping Claire would show up to fight alongside Alice. I just really like Claire. She makes these movies better. Still I liked it well enough, because, hey, hot chicks killing zombies and being kick-ass is always enjoyable.<br />I do hope they bring back Claire for RE6.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|Very good movie.  Our whole family loved it!!  I would recommend it for all ages.  Gives a new twist to the monsters of old but does it in a way that is fun for everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! you can play it in the car without messing up! in temple run you have to tilt your device Wich makes it hard to play. I also like how it really looks like your on a subway track! this app is surely reccomended by me!!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun but addicting hard to put down. Prepare for hours of frustrating but rewarding adventure to succeed and win points
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This book is informative.  The book is fiction, But the author does a great job of making you feel that it is true.<br />A good book for people knowing someone going through early onset of Alzheimers.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|So,I watched season one over the weekend and there were so many twists and turns - I loved it! This review thing keeps telling me I need to add one more word. I could rate this show in one word - awesome!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this after I saw the movie but it was still an enjoyable page turner and the writing is good enough that that you forget you know what happens next.
B004GF87VE|5.0|I ordered this book to complete a set by the author. Leave it to Amazon to have just what I wanted! I love these stories. Will be enjoyed by all who like animals & interesting characters.
B006T3RM08|2.0|Consider this like a piece of unfinished furniture. You WILL have to modify it to make the trackpad not stick.<br />I absolutely love the idea however the trackpad sticking is a major defect. I had to just about trim the entire<br />lip of the trackpad to get it to work. I shouldn't have to do that to a product I buy for a specific purpose.<br />Returning it was too much of a hassle and there customer service just said trim the edge. Not really<br />acceptable in the business world. Not sure I would buy another product from them in the future.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|The book arrived in the time frame expected and was in great condition. I used the book in my English class with students with disabilities and it helped them understand the book and make comparisons between the two.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I finished this book in less than a week! The author did a wonderful job creating a realistic character. At times I was angry with Victoria but yet wanted to know her story. I couldn't set the book down and I loved her journey and strength. And weakness. This was an easy read and I highly recommend it. Especially if u love flowers. There is also a bonus flower dictionary at the end that explained a few things in the book! I didn't give the 5th star only because I wanted to know more about Victoria's beginnings and the reasons why she was so bitter. I had a hard time sympathizing with her
B007SGM084|5.0|The book arrived in the time frame expected and was in great condition. I love this book. Great way to relax and let your imagination go. Went on a cruise and many people were reading the book.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|After 45 years this is still a treasured classic! Yes, the special affects are infantile by today's standards but the star performances, character development, rhetoric are timeless!  This show was way ahead of its time and light years ahead of its counterpart, Lost In Space; they are in different galaxies. Also, the remastering of the video makes it vastly improved over what you will remember from reruns on late night TV.
B008602KQI|5.0|The item arrived in the expected time. This is a great movie and I always enjoy not having to go out to the store chancing the new item will be sold out.
B005M5OSBK|4.0|Ricky Ricardo (TV's \\"I Love Lucy\\") would have loved this stuff!  Danclible, piano and a whole lot of other instruments of various kinds, seemingly everything but electric guitar, I'm no dancer but I'm pretty sure you can do Ballroom to it?  11 from 6 Pink Martini albums, 2 from other artists' albums, 8 previously unreleased tracks, it's all good!  Bravo!
0385751532|5.0|The book arrived in the time frame expected and was in great condition. I used the book in my English class with students with disabilities and the book with the video helped them understand the story better .
0062213423|5.0|My daughter was so excited when I bought this for her...she loves the boy band and has their posters all over her room.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Boring game. Why? You quickly run out of coins then have to wait 30 seconds to get a free one.  Problem is you can't use just one coin.  Won't move the pile.  So it's not just waiting 30 seconds for 1 coin, but a minute or two to get 3 or 4 to move the pile.  I exit the game and come back the next day only to play for two or three minutes with the coins that are free.  STILL CAN'T BELIEVE OVER 2800 PEOPLE GAVE THIS 5 STARS
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Spell binding, keeps you on the edge from the very start and keeps you there. I am going to be 70 this year and must say I enjoyed it very much, great book for all ages. First time I have read it.
B003VANOFY|5.0|These gaming headphones are very, very impressive. The battery life on them isn't too shabby, but I have been caught off guard sometimes with them dying. Simple solution is to just plug them into the computer and continue using them. It would be nice if the wireless adapter to the computer was a bit smaller, such as ones for the logitech gaming mouse... but otherwise that is my only complaint.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and finished it in just a few days.  It's dark, but very interesting with twists to keep you guessing.  Definitely a great read!!!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok I read better but it was pretty funny that's why I gave my rating so ok bye
B009LDMJBU|5.0|After listening to he CD 5-6 times, I feel like I've known these songs for years. My favorite is &#34;Cosi&#34;, with IL DIVO.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I think this is the best book Jeff Kinney has made yet! I am now working on reading The third wheel so i will get back to you after i finish it!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book.the character pat was amazing. The ending was a silver lining.  Can't wait to see the movie.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Great artwork and stories. Packed very well. Still reading and learning things we didn't know, all while listening to great music!
B004WESFZW|5.0|It arrived earlier than expected, so I was able to give it n Christmas. It came about three days early.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I understand the philosphical complaints that true/hardcore Star Trek fans have about this film being a departure from the established tone of the franchise. But (in my opinion) this one was exactly what Star Trek needed. After nearly thirty seasons of television and ten previous films, it had all become exceedingly well-worn, over-exploited and increasingly playing on the border of unintentional self-parody. This was a like a glass of ice-cold water in the face of the franchise. It's new, it's different in some ways and what is very important and refreshing, it's edgy.<br /><br />There are numerous points of virtue. First of all, I have to say, what an absolutely gorgeous-looking film. The Enterprise bridge set is so beautiful that it almost makes me want to cry. There are several terrifically cinematic panoramas on Earth, on Vulcan and out in space. I particularely love the way that relected sunlight and otherlight frequently flares across the edges of the shots, just as happens with a real camera. Nowdays, they can get rid of that, but in this case it was left or added, just another element of visual appeal.<br /><br />I was pleased with the cast. Chris Pine impresses me more with each role he takes, and he is a great Kirk. Zachary Quinto as Spock is probably the best person for his role. I was impressed with the characterization of Zoe Saldana's Uhura; she seems to be more engaged into the story than in her original series incarnation, which is a good development. Some of the others, I will need to see more of in future films. Also, there is a very strong supporting cast, consisting of the likes of Ben Cross, Winonna Ryder, Jennifer Morrison, Eric Bana and so on.<br /><br />Overall, this is just simply a great film. Completely perfect? Maybe not, but it has light-years of wonderful redeeming qualities. The concept, the look, the sound, the cinematography, the cast, the direction, the humor. This is one of the most watchable science fiction films that I have seenin a long time. The opening sequence, which is one of the most engagingly dramatic and emotionally moving that I've ever seen, and it keeps moving from there. Maybe not classicist Trek, but it feels like a bold new future, and the energy that this film has put into the franchise will hopefully result in an ever upward trajectory from here. Star Trek is cool.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was great! It was an exiting book full of greek and roman myths. I can't wait for the next book
B005NFJAT4|1.0|I'm not rating the movie itself, just the disc.<br /><br />In a word awful. The transfer to blu-ray on this disc is muddy and dark. My DVD is far better. I couldn't watch to the end of the first day of the battle I was so irritated by the quality.<br /><br />To be fair, I don't know if I got a bad disc and others are better. I love this film and am very disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Well I loved this whole series, I was so sad when Primrose died. But things do get better for Katniss an  Peeta and as for Gale week, one can only hope he's happy were he's at
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book is one of my top five favorite books!!! I would recommend this to anyone who likes fiction and adventure.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is great! It has many different alarms and even a white noise feature that you can fall asleep to. You can also dim and brighten the screen by sliding your finger up or down. This app is a very good one and I definitely recommend it to anyone who needs a good alarm clock app.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|The writing is very good. I felt as though I knew both Charlie and Franz after reading just a few chapters. Truly a book you can't put down. Descriptions of scenery and events were excellent. Many of the events described brought tears. Portions are heart breaking, but seem to be accurately retold, based upon other true stories I've read concerning World War II. My father served under General Patton in the Army and his battalion was in Germany in 1944-45, so I have a special interest in books such as this one.<br /><br />This is a very sensitive, well written remembrance of two good men.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is very simple and not very challenging.  Somethng to pass a little time.  It's one step up from doing nothing.
B001LF347E|4.0|It is a great TV show! LOVE IT!! The only thing was when I got it part of the case was cracked but that was it. Could have been the mailman's fault but they could have packed it better. TV shows great but the packaging stinks. So be warned. Otherwise a GREAT buy!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham is a master story teller that keeps you guessing or on the edge of your seat.  It is fun, plausable and quick moving.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This movie was amazing, what a crazy true story that has such a deep message in it. It makes me want to go on a mission trip and help people around the world
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best trilogy regretted. They needs to make more books like this one. I couldn't stop reading! 3 book in 3 weeks
B005LAIIPS|4.0|Jeremy Renner is always great.  Rachel Weisz is not a good match for him but works out okay!  Her acting skills in this movie are not up to &#34;Constant Gardener&#34; quality!
B007ZCOT6C|4.0|I love this story line. It's really good. Lol. But I absolutely love the lesson of resilience, especially with Mrs. P. The story was amazing but the trust and faith in one's love is priceless. Perception is a error, we destroy it and be yourself.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|Really loved this movie. Took my god-daughter to go see this. when is it coming out on DVD? I'll buy it.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This movie is a fun movie, which both my kids and I enjoy. I like this specific item because it has the DVD version, blu-ray version, and an online version that you can use.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|When you look at a film like Nausicaa, you have to keep a few things in mind.  First, this is an older film (originally released in 1984) so the animation may not be as good as current standards.  The second (if you are considering buying this as a Disney fan as opposed to being an anime/Miyazaki fan) is that some of the Japanese content/ideology may not translate very well.  When I look at the animation I'm blown away.  There are several films I've seen recently that are no where near as beautiful as some of the scenes in this movie.  The environments are detailed, and the characters are expressive.  The musical score was great, and fit the scenes well.  As for whether or not the content translates well or not, I think it does.  It feels like a classic sci-fi movie, but with a bit of eastern flair.  I only recognized some of the hidden meaning after watching the short documentary on the dvd.  Needless, this is a movie I can watch again and again, and still find something new from my perspective.
1400069289|3.0|The book's thesis rests on the \\"cue routine reward\\", where a repeated behavior has both an antecedent event and a pleasing payoff. The author claims that this basic concept applies not only to individuals, but also organizations, and entire societies.  He divides the book up into three parts, and adds copious stories to enrich the reader's understanding and animate his points.<br /><br />Duhigg is clearly a seasoned professional writer and a gifted storyteller.  However, his long narrative examples, painstakingly written in detail, pull the reader's attention away from the main point of the book--which is then repeated again and again.  Whereas Malcolm Gladwell uses brief stories to highlight innovative and fascinating insights, Duhigg seems to do the opposite. As a book, \\"Habits\\" seems to be a hammer looking for a nail--as if the simple cycle of \\"cue-routine-reward\\" can explain everything from the author gaining a few pounds to the civil rights movement.<br /><br />In the end, this is a book worth reading, but the reader must not feel at all guilty for skimming.  In many chapters, it is as if the author has written them merely out of habit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing book thrilling I read I in less than 3days great I suggest it to everyone inter was Shi :/
B0037472NY|5.0|This Connelly legal thriller has an intriguing plot, decent characterization, excellent writing and an exciting ending, which encourages immediate search for another.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Not being a huge fan of King's I was a bit leery but being a fan of time travel books I thought I would give it a try.  WOW! So very glad that I did.  Great story, told very well.  Fell in love with Jake and Sadie and all of their friends.  If you like the idea of time travel this one will make you very happy.
B009NXV2RK|3.0|This novel does quite meet my standard comment: &#34;has an intriguing plot, decent characterization, excellent writing and an exciting ending, which encourages immediate search for another.&#34;
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love all of the games that I have already unlocked and completely. I can't wait to unlock more games. This game is awesome
B004TL0J5M|5.0|This Connelly legal thriller has an intriguing plot, decent characterization, excellent writing and an exciting ending, which encourages immediate search for another.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|This is another well done MIB, the characters and story are well worth the time it takes to see it.
B00A8KJN14|4.0|Back in 1984, a young Tim Burton (who would go on to direct \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Alice in  Wonderland\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\", \\"Batman Returns\\", \\"Ed Wood\\") created a short film titled \\"Frankenweenie\\" which paid homage to the 1931 film \\"Frankenstein\\".<br /><br />In 2005, Tim Burton would sign with Disney to remake \\"Frankenweenie\\" and by 2009, the screenplay for a feature film was written by John August and would reunite the crew that worked with Burton for \\"Corpse Bride\\".<br /><br />By 2010, Burton would work on one of the biggest stop-motion animation films (with a budget of $39 million) which require mechanical skeletons and feature over 200 puppets. The following year, he would reunite with musician Danny Elfman (\\"Batman\\", \\"The Simpsons\\", \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", \\"Corpse Bride\\") who would score the film and the film would be released in theaters in September 2012.<br /><br />The film would receive positive reviews from film critics and would go on to earn $66 million in the box office worldwide.  And in January 2013, the film will be released on Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD.<br /><br />VIDEO:<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  First, let's take a look at the 3D version of the film.  This has got to be one of the best looking films from Disney or any company to be released on Blu-ray 3D so far.  It's important to note that to play this 3D, you will need a TV that is 3D enabled and comes with its own 3D glasses (or purchase them separately in pack) and also a Blu-ray player that is 3D-enabled as well.<br /><br />Created in stop-motion animation, presented in black and white, the film has wonderful contrast.  The 3D version of \\"Frankenweenie\\" shows more dedication towards depth.  So, you see more separation of the characters and objects with their surroundings.  This is not the kind of 3D that tries to reach out to you, but more of showing how characters and surround areas have depth.<br /><br />The picture quality looks amazing with black levels dark, grays and whites are gorgeous and edges are refined.  There is no banding, no aliasing or artifacts, this is a gorgeous film with amazing detail and stop-motion animation, whether you are watching in 3D or not.<br /><br />For the most part \\"Frankenweenie\\" is a gorgeous film on Blu-ray and its use of depth in 3D is quite impressive!<br /><br />AUDIO & SUBTITLES:<br /><br />Disney doesn't disappoint at all with the lossless soundtrack for \\"Frankenweenie\\".  The film is presented in English 7.1 DTS-HD MA and English DVS 2.0 Dolby Digital, French 7.1 DTS-HDHR and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital Language track.  The film is definitely immersive when it comes to the thunder and natural ambience of the film.  Especially with the dogs and cats, it's great how the film captures those sounds of creatures to the talent show at school. Dialogue is crystal clear, surround channels showcase the ambiance of the film and LFE is utilized during different parts of the film.  The 7.1 lossless soundtrack for \\"Frankenweenie\\" is fantastic and the music by Danny Elfman also sounds wonderful in HD!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  All New Original Short: \\"Captain Sparky vs The Flying Saucers\\"--(2:25) An all-new short featuring Victor and Sparky's home movie.<br />  Miniatures In Motion: Bringing `Frankenweenie' To Life\\"--(23:06) Viewers get an in-depth tour of the London set that includes never-before-seen footage showcasing the hundreds of artists who worked on the film.  Interviews with producer Allison Abbate, executive producer Don Hahn and fillmmaker Tim Burton.<br />  \\"Frankenweenie\\" Touring Exhibit--(4:37) Producer Allison Abbate and Executive Producer Don Hahn along with director Tim Burton talks about how they wanted to showcase the puppets and sculptures and what best than a \\"Frankenweenie: Touring Exhibit\\" and footageof the exhibit at San Diego Comic-Con 2012.<br />  \\"Frankenweenie\\" Original Live Action Short--(30:02) Burton's original live-action black and white Disney short film created back in 1984 with talent Shelly Duvall, Daniel Stern, Barret Oliver, Paul Bartel, Sofia Coppola and Jason Hervey. (note: This is the same feature that was included with \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\").<br />  Music Video -- (3:55) \\"Pet Sematary\\" performed by Plain White T's<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie - 4-Disc Combo Pack\\" comes with the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and Digital Copy of the feature film.  Also, included is an embossed slipcover case.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />When it comes to Tim Burton films,  you generally expect to see a dark style to the characters.<br /><br />From \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" to \\"Corpse Bride\\" and now with \\"Frankenweenie\\", the characters of \\"Frankenweenie\\" look creepy and odd.  The character of young Edgar is a hunchback with a gangly face with three teeth; Weird Girl (one of Victor's classmates who thinks she can give psychic predictions of her cat, Mr. Whiskers), has a very tall neck and round head; Nassor looks like Boris Karloff; even Sparky the dog doesn't look so cute with its scars and stitches all over its body.<br /><br />But that's the charm of Tim Burton animated films.  These films have their own style of animation and are unique for its own style that is never duplicated.  Imaginative, creative and entertaining!<br /><br />While for some people, stop-animation makes one thing of a film such as the \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\", \\"Frankenweenie\\" is a different style of stop-animation film with gigantic monsters, wonderful models of human characters, vehicles and surroundings.  The amount of detail and the expressions that these characters have are wonderfully done and even the monsters are well-modeled.<br /><br />And I'm sure for Tim Burton, just seeing how his original short film came to life with \\"Frankenweenie\\" must have felt great. His original short film made over 28-years-ago while he was working as an animator at Disney, was considered to macabre for a remake and Disney didn't want to have anything to do with it.  Considering that Tim Burton films have been successful and for Disney, Burton gave the company its 12th highest earning film of all time, suffice to say, it's great to see that Disney gave the green light for this film to be made.  But the idea of creating stop-motion began when Burton was a child and he would create stop motion via his Super 8.<br /><br />While I felt the film was not too sentimental (as one usually expects from a Disney film), I try to remind myself that while its released by Disney, it's a Tim Burton film and the film does a good job at stop-motion but also creating this world of weird looking characters within the confines of a Frankenstein world.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, picture quality and 3D for this Blu-ray was wonderful.  Picture quality, the film shows a lot of detail and the film is sharp and well-contrast.  The 3D is not the type that will grab after you but in terms of depth, I was impressed with the overall depth of the 3D presentation.  Lossless soundtrack is very good thanks to Disney giving audiophiles that 7.1 lossless soundtrack.  Great ambience from crowd sounds to surround ambiance sounds great coming through the surround channels and also with the amount of action featured, there is also good LFE.  But dialogue and music is crystal clear!  And also included are several special features that will keep viewers busy for awhile.<br /><br />And with this 4-disc combo pack, you get the film in Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray, DVD and via digital copy.<br /><br />While I have given many positives for \\"Frankenweenie\\", especially when it comes to presentation and sound, if I found any problem with the film, its overall execution.  The plot is simplistic and the ending was also simplistic and quick.  I suppose that you expect to see some majorclimax or even a heightened tension for Tim Burton films but the way the film ended seemed a bit too quick for my taste.  But I'm sure that is subjective to the viewer.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Frankenweenie\\" is an enjoyable, imaginative and creative film from Tim Burton and crew.  As a family film, it's a safe film but younger viewers may be weirded out by the unusual look of the characters, while Burton fans will appreciate the look and creativity of this film.  Storywise, the film was good, just not great but fortunately, the Blu-ray release , its 3D and HD presentation along with its special features makes it a Blu-ray release worth owning.<br /><br />\\"Frankenweenie - 4-Disc Combo Pack\\" is recommended!great.

B007SGM084|5.0|Besides the graphic sexual encounters,  I found the story very heartwarming.  I loved the twists and turns in the storyline.  It opened my eyes into another world that I know truly exists.  I found myself captivated by the innocence of the main characters and how they both were capable of changing each others lives through very hard times.  I am left with wanting to read more but sadly it has come to a  very great end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is totally awesome. I feel like as if I have a real horse of my own! there is soooo much stuff I can do. grooming riding feeding and cleaning my horse
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The premise of this story is really interesting and the acting superb, but the four of us who watched it could not follow the story, particularly because it covered the same scene over and over with multiple outcomes.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|I will always love you too Whitney--a shame you couldn;t handle it all better...butyour wonderful voice will  ring true for generations to come...
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I had trouble at the beginning-no walkthrough but G5 company helped me. I enjoyed the game. I didn't care for some G5 games but this one was good. One last thing, the beginning of the game said that if I did a review, I would receive the sequel free... hasn't happened.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Wow--other than the Rainbow arrangement(whicvh sucked)--the album and Susan's singing is just supreme--am going to order your other CD's now--God Bless you...you are indeed a winner and don't let any  naysayers tell you otherwise
B00A7CI82I|4.0|Really good movie, Jeremy Brenner has a tinge of humor and that's what makes this movie different from the other Bourne movies. I really enjoyed it.
B006ID6NDQ|5.0|This book tells the story of a human desire to stay alive against all odds. Her dignity intact she<br />battles against all odds of a Jewish woman surviving the holocaust. It makes one  wonder if<br />you were personally in this situation would we have the strength to come through this not only<br />at the time it happened but the memories that would haunt you for the rest of your life
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game runs pretty good on kindle fire, It's a good size so you can see easily. If you liked this game on Pc you'll love this one as well.
B00008G8LL|5.0|I don't think I've ever missed an episode with Tom hanks in any movie or computerized show. I can't think of a better way to spend a snowy Saturday.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! THIS APP IS TH ULTIMATE BEST!!!!!!!!!! IFBU DONT LIKE THATS UR HUGE PROBLEM AND U SHOULD SEE A DOCTOR
B005LAIISA|4.0|I thought there should have been more focus on the mole in the scenes that had the same type of jokes as the other movies before this one, still a good movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was very interesting. There were parts I was not fond of, but over all it was good. It is not what I expected at all, but in a good way. I now cannot wait to read the next book to find out what is going to happen. I recommend this to all who likes romance novels for it is a great story with detailed sex scenes.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was an adventurous read. I enjoyed it very much and look forward book #3 to finish the Millennium trilogy.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its a pretty cool app and simple with no flaws .. you should just get it. :)<br />..,.................,..........,  get it get it get it
B0015DROBO|5.0|Although quite graphic and somewhat gory at times, I enjoyed this book very much. I'm looking forward to book #2 in the trilogy.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|First of all, the memory came WARP speed. I installed this in a WYSE X50M Suse Linux thin client, and it saw it IMMEDIATELY. I am very pleased with this memory. It was a truly plug and play install.
0143120530|4.0|I enjoyed the science and the social commentary.  Foer provides a helpful review of memory techniques.  I shared them with my 10 year old over lunch.  I used our tapas order as a list to memorize.  She recalled the list perfectly months later.  If only we could get her to apply it to her bedtime routine!  I recommend the book highly.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Fast paced,but a little disjointed.  Will always love Mitch Rapp!  Can't wait for the next one! This is the Central Intelligence Agency we wish we had!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not wait to get home each day to read more.  This book was a pleasant surprise filled with  things I did not see coming.  It is an easy read that you can just sink into and enjoy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think anyone who has read this series has enjoyed it. If you haven't read it, buy it!  It's great!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome. The best mini-series ever. The scenery, the castle, the decor, the reproduction of period clothing, the acting, the story line are just outstanding.
B002HNA95E|5.0|Seems like they felt pressured to promote the new Madonna in this album so we have a few so-so recent releases in place of a few must haves.<br /><br />It's a travesty that the following 2 songs are not in this album:<br /><br />Rescue Me<br />The Power Of Goodbye<br /><br />Also add \\"This Used To Be My Playground\\" and you have everything Madonna has released (up to this album) which is worth listening to.
B005KELQEU|5.0|Bought for a xmas gift and it fits the kindle perfectly.  Sturdy and looks like it will last a while.
B0001NBNAM|2.0|WHETHER YOU LIKE THIS CONNIE FRANCIS COLLECTION OR NOT, YOU SIMPLY MUST LISTEN TO JERRY VALE DOING THE ITALIAN FAVORITES. BOTH CONNIE AND JERRY ARE ITALIAN AMERICANS, BUT JERRY DOES THEM WITH SINCERITY AND INTEGRITY WITHOUT THE WHINING AND CRYING! JERRY IS ON \\"I HAVE BUT ONE HEART\\" AND \\"ARRIVEDERCI ROMA\\" 2-ON-ONE COLLECTABLES CD. ENJOY!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not as impressive as some of his earlier books. However,  a number of twists will keep you guessing. Overall it is a good read.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am hooked thanks to aol prime. So easy to view. Free the week end while Bates remains in prison!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending seems anticlimatic and has much gratuitous violence; but that's hard to say @ fiction.  Still a good trilogy.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this one starts out easy and the connects get harder with each level. its another addicting game. it makes you think.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so glad I could order this immediately for my Kindle after reading the first one!  Leaves you wanting the 3rd one to see how this could possibly end!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Its nothing like the facebook game that you play. It needs to have the same features and it would be really fun.
B005LAII3U|5.0|it was the best movie you have ever seen and had lots of action with great storyline, better then the original movie
B0094BB4TW|1.0|you can't really do much with it except read and comment. It's nothing like on a pc.  you dont have access to everything in your facebook.
B0087GZ8YW|3.0|Don't think I will bother to read any more of his books,  not much of a plot line, found it unrealistic.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this a fun little action game thats a little similar to mario. my grandson introduced me to this game. try it.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Maggie Smith is divine!!!! the costumes are so gorgeous, the settings perfect, it is just a first rate production.  The acting is good and the writing is good and I was born in the wrong place and time.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|my granddaughter likes this game. It keeps her busy for hours. Need more hello kitty games and other similar games.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|First of all, everything in the game can be unlocked through hours of gameplay. I have been able to unlock all of the disease and around 58% of the DNA without spending extra money on it. For $0.99 you can get tons of hours of gameplay out of it. It is very indepth unlike the game \\"pandemic\\" that you can easily find on the web somewhere. If you enjoy strategy, making your own disease, and reading some funny news headline, I recommend this game for you.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love that I can use the app on my kindle fire hd. No real issues with it yet, it's easy to use and hasn't frozen or restarted on me.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose it because I love Nicholas sparks. All his novels arei would highly recommend this novel. great! Ive yet to be disappointed.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|Story line ok.  I watch the Step Up movies for the dancing.  The choreography was fantastic, combining art and dance.
1451695195|5.0|An unbelieving neurosurgeon writes the most compelling NDE I've ever read.  Science meets God..you don't have to be a brain surgeon to get a thrill from this book!
B002RB7VMA|4.0|I liked the music and Michael Buble has a wonderful voice, i will probable purchase more of his music but i just can't yet get into using my kindle fire for music like i thought i would.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|I had heard about this movie and thought it sounded interesting. Watched it and just loved it. It is creative, thought provoking, challenging, witty and awesome love story. :)
B0017XD3OY|5.0|I am a zombie fan. This was perfect entertainment 4 me. really enjoyed - very likely to recommend! Want more movies like this!
1427201439|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and loved it. I always wanted to read the book but I could never find enough time to read it. Now that I have the audio format that came in no time I am so excited to listen to it.
B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Bought this for nephew's birthday.  Considering the pictures on cards, they definitely should have supplied more pieces.  Only option is cheating and using you own to supplement.
B00ARAO720|5.0|Very different kind of action movie, fun and unique.  I expected it to be too dramatic about bike messengers but it didn't take itself too seriously.
0316227706|5.0|Bought the book for myself, and I don't have a coffee table!  The first time I went through this I was amazed at the photos and the concept of the book
B00479SVBU|3.0|Everything works as advertised, easy to use, easy to get music onto cards and into the device and use in your car.  Only thing that annoys me about it is that the shuffle mode (like shuffle on MANY devices) falls into a pattern and you end up hearing the same songs over and over and over and over.  if you don't want this you need to listen to songs in order and skip the ones you don't like, otherwise you hear the same songs a lot and hear some songs never on shuffle.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|came fast to home got ee ee e  eeee  eeee e e eeee eeee e  eeee e ee  eee e
B003VDZK8K|5.0|Good Album.  Very pleased.  I recommend this to any fans of Avenged Sevenfold, as well as to non fans.  Worth listening to.
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|It takes time and effort to load.<br />You better make sure your child will clean up after him/herself or you'll see nerf bullets all over the floor.<br />Is your cabinet big enough to hold it along with the other nerf weapons he/she has?
B0050PYNO4|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  Even if you are not a Simon Pegg/Nick Frost fan (Shaun of the Dead, etc), this will make you laugh, a lot.
B00AGH5LF6|5.0|I like this movie better than the first Home Alone.  I have watched it over and over again.  Will be watching it again on my Kindle in the airplane on vacation!
B007HU4FZ2|4.0|I did not see this movie when it originally came out in theatres because of the Catholic nature/view of the film.  However, i was deeply moved by how the film illustrated the suffering of Christ before and during his crucifiction.  Mel Gibson did an amazing representation of the culture and historical accuracy of the times.  This movie ended in strengthening my faith in Christ as the redeemer of man.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Better than the first! I couldn't put it down! This book had me guessing what would happen next. I was biting my nails with each turn of the page!!!!
B003SHUMRI|4.0|this movie was entertaining and a visual treat.  Channing Tatum was amazing!  Highly reccomend  and it is not just for youngsters. I am 51 and I loved it.

B009GX69RK|5.0|I loved season one.  Couldn't wait for Season Two to become available and when it finally did, it did not disappoint.  It is so funny!  I may even like it MORE than season one!
B004U52VPS|5.0|Very Nice purchase, good quality and bargain. Would recommend for any  one who would be interested in buying this item
B009UX2YAC|5.0|STUNNING GRAPHICS, FAST AND FURIOUS GAMEPLAY. A MUST BUY. AFTER WATCHING GAMEPLAY, FRIENDS, CO-WORKERS, AND FAMILY DOWNLOADED THIS ONE !
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I've used lots of different cpu fans over the years.  This is the best ever.  Just one thing though,  you need a wide case, or it won't fit.  Two thumbs up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Absolutely the best in the series!!  The suspense was captivating and the way E.L James brings it all together is flawless!
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Well worth reading. A very innovative and different perspective on selling. I'm presenting my first pitchdeck on Tuesday to the interest of the whole company. :-)
B00999DFP0|5.0|What can I sday, great writing and execution by the actors. You have to pay attention or you will miss jokes which is the sign of a great comedy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game cause you can get many things like new paddocks and you can enter contests you should get this game
B00000DRV7|5.0|when it comes  to Ratings,this C.D. is up with the Big Boys--I love there Music, I can remember when  the record store  tsell me this Record  , so I did and I didn't have any regrets on buying it.  CHICAGO TRANSIT AUTHORITY was the  group---Now they are  CHICAGO.<br />When I originally Bought this record, I wore the record out  so Just Resently I Bought on C.D. From amazon and  I really enjoy listening it.<br />I would Recommend this C.D. to all of Friends because it brings back Memories of good Music.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|LOVE THE BOOK  IT GOOD TO SEE HOW SHE GOT UNDER HIS SKIN AND HOW SHE GOT TO HIM IN THE END
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Well written, entertaining, capturing.  Good clean fun, everything I want in a story.  Included frustration, anticipation, logic, believable, positive.  Great sexy descriptors.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|IT WAS GOOD TO SEE HOW THEY BEGIN THERE STORY AND HOW SHE STARTED TO CHANGE HIM FOR THE BETTER
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This book relieved me of the guilt associated with having no success at trying carb-in / carb-out diets. Recommended by my doctor, it has turned my nutritional life around. I'll be baking 3 sheets of bacon today in celebration.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|I LOVE THE HOLE THREE  BOOKS READ THE A FEW TIMES IT WAS GREAT TO SEE THE STORY UNFOLD AS YOU READ IT
B008AK8FHM|4.0|A doctor slips into a coma and is &#34;dead&#34; for a week.  He comes back to reality and writes about his experience.
B004N66XYE|3.0|Not many episodes.  Overpriced for con taint.  I have all of the original Up/down on tape ( yes I have working VCR's).<br />The original gets  5 stars, this 2 and a half!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|New group that is going to be good.  Love their song When I die young.......makes you want to sing along!!
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Non surprises here.  I assume this first book is setting the background for exciting adventures to come.  At least I hope so.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I don't like the way Yahoo panders to the liberals and democrats.  But seeing how they are just another LSM, what do you expect??
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|The movie was excellent it was a family orientated movie that's the whole family can enjoy. It shows how a father love is child and would do anything to protect her.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I still love the gameplay in campaign mode, but I which there was access to things like the zen garden and survival mode, and the mini games.  It its a shame, because those were the main reasons I bought this game.  I was real looking forward to surviving longer because the touch screen seems like it would be much more responsive than a mouse.
B003JBHQP4|4.0|Its small and does exactly what its supposed to do. It replaced the same functionality on a printer (that we don't have anymore). It works just fine with my wife's Mac Mini.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a great app for those of us who are always interested in the current weather conditions. AccuWeather is usually very accurate.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|While it still looks very beta-ish. This game has potential. I like the idea of give classic maze a high-tech twist. For some reason though, the graphics are a little bit dark for my liking, and the mouse looks sinister.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Works as described, fun app. Great for killing time, especially in a doctors or dentist office.  May be annoying to others people waiting.
B00884GR0W|3.0|boa boa mad mad angry start over. and force close and app store will not let me uninstall and mad and sad back to a open button then force close then next day hay it might work install button then tap force close then no uninstall just mad dad very sad stupid app kindle fired. lame time is never refunded.

B00AMBLXP8|3.0|its was alright, don't let kids watch it, a pot smoking drinking bear, even had sex with a women not for children
B00A8ECU24|3.0|It doesn't get boring fast, it's just hard to follow.it doesn't ever stop and it takes a long time for you to do much.
B001EJY8RW|5.0|I  loved this movie if your a kevin Costner fan you will really love this, Marilyn stowe, Anthony Quinn great movie
B002XZNHG4|5.0|I have watched Annie Hall 85 times and still counting.  It was an early work of Woody but has so many things that resonate with me that I can't quite ever get enough of it.  Clearly there are strong cultural references, as there are in most of Woody's movies, but they don't limit its appeal to others outside those cultural references.  I don't want to gush, so I am going to stop here, but unless you are a died-in-the-wool Woody Allen hater (and believe me, there are some), it's so hard not to enjoy this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever worth it and defiantly buy it cool game and totally not a 1,2,or 3 star game if you like monkeys and love to create virtual  worlds then this is your type of game ps it is not the same as this so just get cause i am a hippy and mlm=monkeys love minecraft so do everyone a faver and get the game to give it a 5 star rating peace out dudets
B0063IH60K|1.0|My husband downloaded it and tried using it.  His comments were &#34;It is just ugly&#34;.  When I asked for more description, he said he disliked the way it looked and moved.  He has removed it from his Kindle.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I am new to this group, love the one song &#34;Ho Hey,&#34; so I thought I'd check out the rest.  I have to say that I enjoy listening to them.
B008EKON56|4.0|These do the trick and lets me use the same cable I already had for Sandisk player and my Garmin - with my new iPod. I use these in my car,  on my PC and as preferred method to feed audio throug my home receiver. Good audio quality too.  May have saves a litte to look for for a device with full USB cable, but I'm happy with my purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is app is great for anyone that loves mine craft. if you already have this app, you know what I mean. a good world seed is  nyan cat.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A handy and helpful way to keep track of your Kindle 's battery power level.  Looks great, too!  Now you can always know how much time you have remaining to play a game, watch a video or surf the web.  Definitely worth the money!
B0046MOVD0|5.0|I must say that I pay attention at the beginning of the movie and at the end of the movie, but during the part in the middle (from her first being in that two-seat monoplane until they get to the ship) I usually tend to multitask and not pay much attention to it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|This game is very addicting and fulfilling. You do have the option to spend real money, but that said, if you can avert your eyes from all the expensive cute creatures you really can level up and earn quite a bit of coin =) and you can make your own cute dragons by mix breeding.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed it and my five year old is excited to play it himself.<br /><br />The game is fun replay is good my son and I enjoyed playing. worth the three dollars.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I felt the book started slow, but it ended well. Stonehenge was barely touched though, which is a woeful shame.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Pixar can do no wrong (save Cars 2), and this is no exception. Of course you need to see this movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Andy Weir has created a very believable yarn with realistic characters. The junkyard engineering and humorous dialogue made this a fun read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Easy read, great end to the story. Looking forward to more movies. Now what should I read next? Thank you.
B005DI66N4|5.0|I picked this one up at the recommendation of a friend and was amazed with the story. A quick read (only took me a few hours), but worth the few bucks for the paperback.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|This dvd is simply amazing!!!! If you are a Hendrix fan this is an absolute must have for your collection. This dvd will blow your mind!!!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great read what a heartbreaker story this is the life of so many girls. I love book that touch base on issue of the heart
3795753384|5.0|Was performing this work and wanted my own score.  This was exactly like the one the other chorus members were using.  It was very helpful -- I could write notes in it because it was my own.  I always like to have my own scores.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game never bores and features exciting places like NYC. This game is great for fans of temple run and ski safari!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|The product was new and in its original wrapping.  And there's no better subject than Downton Abbey!  I highly recommend all three seasons.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|My 9 year old loves these books.  This one was was no exception.  On line books are great. He really enjoys reading now that he has a tablet.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 3 carried on the traditional high quality seen in seasons 1 and 2. I am waiting anxiously for more episodes to be released.
B0050ZPAPA|5.0|I did not want to put this book down! A totally fresh approach to fantasy, I absolutely loved it. Can't wait to read the rest of the series!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I was intrigued throughout the book, feeling so much empathy for the parents as they went through this very difficult time with their son. The conclusion was startling to say the least.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Thought it was going to be too young, teenage-like, but very good twists, kept my interest.  Have recommended to others.
0316232955|5.0|What a great treat to myself for new year's! The book is a pleasure to read and tip simply hold in one's  hands. Although I find Carson's story very sad, the book leaves a light impression.<br />Loved that the literary journal was included in the book!
0770433782|5.0|Definitely pick up this book for ideas for your wedding, or just to dream over your future wedding! I love it.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This was hard to put down a real page turner.  This book re started me reading again twenty years ago.  Ken Follett puts a great picture in my head when I read his books.<br /><br />Con, it could have been twice as long.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Too many leaps of faith in following the voice-overs during the flashback aspacet of this film.  Slightly more understanding of the mechanics of looper relationships would have been helpful....this could NOT have been the first time a looper turned runner and had a crisis of choices or of heart....the &#34;lost&#34; aspect of loopers demanded more development  to the viewer....
B000NHG7BQ|2.0|The full version of this movie is very powerful, never again will I trust an unrated directors cut. I'm guessing the director wanted to get a pg rating, I should have read the reviews. The original movie was very well done, make certain you do not purchase this directors cut. Revenge is a film with adult themes and should be left that way.
B002BCNK1Q|3.0|Not enough character investment in the young boy. Too little to make Eastwood's choice to turn away from his family believable ....although certainly logical
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is very cute. It does take a while to build resouces so you can only play in short visits before running out of things to do. Animals are fun to play with.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I love Old movies.  This one reminds me of my Grammar school days.  I like  how the kids are always friends.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The first book was a good, fast read with a complicated main character in Christian Grey, and I couldn't put the book down.  I do feel like this triology was a two-book series made into three books unnecessarily, though.  There are many things I felt like the author could have explored more throughout the books instead of waiting until the end to explain away in a few chapters, but I was still interested enough to keep reading through the entire trilogy and would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the &#34;Twilight&#34; or &#34;Highlander&#34; series of books.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Amazing! I absolutely have to read the next book. It was modern yet it had plenty of history in it. It was funny and anyone would like it. The movie did not do it justice. I loved it. I think you will too!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|My husband is currently reading this book and is hooked!  He loves Stephen King and says this one is one of his best.  I want my Kindle back!
1449433251|5.0|I've always loved Calvin and Hobbes. I've read many strips over the years in newspapers but it's just great to be able to read them all from beginning to end. This is going to give me hours of laughter and enjoyment.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Enjoyable throughout the entire novel. I could not put it down. This book is fabulous. I usually hate endings of books, but the ending (not the epilogue) was perfection.
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|This movie is visually stunning.  Notice the contrast of people creating beauty and art, versus people making items for destruction/waste.<br /><br />I found the images of the monks making a mandala amazing.  They put a lot of time, patience and love into a creation that lasts for a short time, then is lovingly destroyed to make a new creation.<br /><br />We plan on buying this film.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|Although I have enjoyed Grisham books in the past, I found this one to be predictable and stale.  I also found it impossible to relate to the characters, just too unreal like too many action movies.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoy G5 games, and am always happy to find a new one listed. Perfect for passing the time or a rainy night.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Simple and beautiful, this game is a work of art. Waited too long for it to reach the kindle.finally here
B0031RDV0A|5.0|No one does  evolution better, and makes it like a circus event for the educated, but non academic reader. I have read &#34;The Selfish Gene,&#34; &#34;The Extended Phenotype,&#34; and the &#34;Blind Clockmaker,&#34; but the &#34;Greatest Show...&#34; how adds it all up, and more. I wish I had read Dawkins as a teenager, and I might have followed through on my plans for veterinary medicine. The &#34;tree test&#34; in my pre-med biology class would have made sense with a little of the awe and wonder that Dawkins brings to the subject, not to speak of the adventure involved. We owe much to writer-scientists, like Dawkins, who can take an incredibly complex subject and make it exciting and fun to read. It is a veritable &#34;circus,&#34; with more &#34;wild animals&#34; than you will ever see under the big top. I ended up in political science, but the &#34;arms race&#34; in evolutionary encounters is far more dramatic, and literally, always a fight to the death. If you don't read any other Dawkins book, read this one with its fantastic illustrations, and three ring action. You won't be disappointed, and you will experience a world you barely knew existed.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|awesome game my daughter loves it only problem I have is adding friends it takes forever to load brutish definitely suggest it
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Downloaded to my iPad in a couple of minutes. No problem. Good story but won't leave a lasting impression on me
B000FCKIFU|3.0|This is the first in the &#34;camel Club&#34; series.  It is OK for developing the characters.  I hope the follow-up books are better!
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Just wanted to see what all the hype was about. Good read but not one of the best that I've read.  Great download to my iPad without any issues.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Better that most of his recent &#34;stuff&#34; but far from his best days as a fiction writer.  Subpar for him!
B004TP38X8|5.0|Smooth and graceful!<br />I have her on my playlist with Jill Scott, En Vogue and Anita Baker. Smooth listening all day.
0763644765|5.0|My 16 month old son loves this book. Got it a this week and I've probably read it two dozen times already. Whether or not it actually helps with going potty is yet to be seen lol.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|It's not fair to really compare this to the Stallone version, since both are in some ways based on the comic book (the comic books are very violent, and this version echoes that approach).<br /><br />In order to keep costs down, most of the movie is filmed inside a single building. There is some blood here and there. Dredd never takes off his helmut (sorry ladies), though Anderson walks around without one through most of the film (spoilers aside, you will see why in the movie).<br /><br />The movie itself moves right along, and in some ways, it's more about Judge Anderson than Dredd (how she goes from Rookie to one of the ranks).<br /><br />I liked it in many ways, it's action filled, though using a single location for the setting is not enough. The bad guys (and girls) are extremely violent, well, they are actually little more than psycho gang members, and that genre is wearing thin on me. I think the film makers could have been more creative to come up with an evil foil to Dredd's lawful approach.<br /><br />Watch it once, it's worth it if you like action flicks. But watching it a second time, you may be on the fence about it...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing.  A must read.<br />It shows how when you trust each other all things are possible.<br />Can't wait to read the other two
B00992CF6W|5.0|I purchased this for my son to use on my tablet and he has used it quite a bit and plays it all the time.  Not all the features of the PC version yet but they are improving it.
B0058VW36U|2.0|I just want  to play with this new technology also I want to experience the new version of this technology
B004ZRV3AU|4.0|This works well but you must take time with the final breaking to make sure you do it properly or the edge will be jagged and require more grinding.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not completely through with it.  But it does hold your attention.  I don't fall asleep reading it as I have other books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read in awhile. I could not put it down and read it in 2 days. I highly recommend this .
B006LSZECO|2.0|It seems like it took a long time to get to the point of the book.  I would think twice about reading another of her books.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros:<br />-Light weight and very adjustable for different head sizes and wearing angles<br />-Comfortable for long sessions<br />-Cup design cuts out environment noise well<br />-Easily accessible controls on the left cup for volume, mic mute, and the surround sound switch<br />-Capable of significantly louder output than some alternatives<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Does suffer from occasional interference (To be expected)<br />-The Dolby surround sound emulation seems to induce a noticeable range compression (Probably also to be expected)<br /><br />-----<br /><br />I bought these as a replacement for an older headset which had discrete 5.1 surround that I had used for many years without many complaints until the frame broke. I was a bit torn over the issue of emulated vs true surround in headphones as a replacement but decided to try these out. Unfortunately, I don't have any 7.1 sources to test these out with at the moment but 5.1 sources seems to work nearly as well as with my old headset.<br /><br />I've tested this out with a lot of different music and some movies and the sound is very crisp and the range is fairly good. As is common with comparisons between discrete and emulated drivers, these are capable of significantly louder output than my old headset which I usually kept at around 80-100% volume while I can keep these well below 50% for most things. Even when it is turned up higher, the sound quality seems to stay consistent without additional clipping or noise.<br /><br />The one thing I did notice was that the default settings were pretty distracting when the surround emulation was enabled. There was a slight metallic reverb during quieter scenes of talking and there seemed to be a significant loss of depth to sounds which could otherwise be clearly heard in the stereo mode. I also noticed a little bit of noise on the low end during busy moments. Thankfully, the included software has a 10 bar EQ which can really help lessen the gap between the stereo andsurround modes. Just takes some tweaking to find what is acceptable for you.<br /><br />On occasion, the headset has stuttered then died for a couple seconds before returning to normal. I suspect it is due to interference from my wireless adapter which would even cause noise over my wired headset. Not a deal breaking problem but it might be something to keep in mind if you live in much noisier radio environment.<br /><br />One small bonus is that the charging cord (an elaborate usb-microusb cord) includes a usb port on the base so you don't have to sacrifice two usb ports if you want to use and charge your headset at the same time (Since the headset won't play over just the usb cord). But you will have to use two ports if you want to use a more inconspicuous charging cord than the one provided.<br /><br />Another personal bonus is that these are much more comfortable than other headsets I've owned. The cups are plenty deep to avoid compressing your ears and the headband is pretty adjustable. There also seems to be just the right amount of pressure to keep the headset from sliding around too much but not enough to cause a headache after long sessions. The cups also rotate back the full 90 degrees if you need them to.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />In conclusion, this headset seems to be a nice choice for moderate users. I'm sure pickier individuals would find the little problems with the surround emulation too annoying but I'm content with the quality for my purposes. The set is comfortable and portable with good battery life and enough settings in the software to overcome many complaints.
B0009IW9DE|5.0|This cd along with a few others were purchased for my father who loves John Cougar Mellencamp. He listened to this artist constantly when I was a kid. I am glad I found it at such a great price.  He was super excited and encouraged when he received them.  Shipping was quick.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is one of the great classics in the mental health field.  Any one who wants to understand emotional regulation should read this book.
0811875040|1.0|I was so happy to make something out of this charming book, because I love the actual bakery and was so excited to be able to make some of the desserts at home. I bake a lot. I decided to make the 6 inch cheesecake, and followed the directions to the letter. What I should have done was to go by my baking instinct, that there was something off about the temperature to bake it and the amount of time. They ask you to shrink plastic wrap to the spring form pan in the oven. It is so you can place it in water for a bain marie. I decided not to do this, because I was afraid of what would happen to the plastic.  I have made numerous cheese cakes before without doing a bain marie, and they have all turned out fine. Second odd thing was the temp. to bake it, and the amount of time. 350 degrees for an hour and a half. Now I will say that I totally forgot about the cheesecake, and should have checked it as it was getting close, but needless to say, it was over cooked :( I then compared a really fool proof cheesecake recipe  that I make all the time, and this is a regular 9 inch one, and the time is only 55 to 60 min. at 300 degrees!<br />It is my first baking flop, and I'm mad at this book, and myself for not checking it, as the time drew near, but holy smokes, 350 degrees for a six inch cheesecake! I should have known better.<br />My thought is the author just didn't know how to write this book for the home baker. I think  there are a lot of missteps. Even the graham cracker recipe is off. I rolled it out a quarter of an inch like they said, and also used a 3 inch cutter, when they asked for 3 1/4, and I could not get 24 cookies that is was suppose to yield, to save my life out of the dough. The cheesecake recipe wants you to use 12 of the cookies. I only used 6 and there were still crumbs left over.<br /><br />I don't think I want to make anything from this book again sadly.  It is so darn cute, but that is where it ends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A real page turner. Couldn't put it down even when I wanted to. The writing is humorous and chilling. Superb fiction.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|I could download videos, but I was not able to save them on a list, so I could watch them later.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag can carry all his lenses camera, microphones, etc.  He thought the gift was great! and he didn't really ask for it.  Going for Mom of the year.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I received these headphones yesterday, and coming from Sennheiser 428's, which cost $14 more when I bought them two years ago, these are much better constructed. These have less bass than the Senns, but the bass it does have sounds much clearer and not as muddy. With my old headphones I was always concerned about them snapping on me, but these have a much more comfortable and robust design and construction. The cable is also a good size, and is actually replaceable, which is nice. The replacement is $29 though, almost half of the set of headphones......bleh. Hopefully I won't need them.<br /><br />Anyway, they come with a 10 foot cord, which is nice in my situation with a desktop. I can get up and move around some without having to take them off. I also enjoy the semi-open design of the headphones, I can hear my roommate if he is talking to me without having to take them off. As another note, these do not have the &#34;Made in Austria&#34; decal on the side, yet they do sound good.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|this is my second favorite movie and I wanted it on Blu-ray.  It's perfect.  My first favorite is The Godfather I & II.
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This book started out a little slowly but I was glad I persevered with it.  After witnessing a murder the story teller starts questioning events in her family history. A love story evolves that hints of secrets that have been kept for many years. Full of delightful twists and turns, the story held my interest till the end.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|My 5 year old loves the ability to grow, feed and care for his dragons in this app, however what I did not know was that within the application is a component for him to PURCHASE coins and gems to maintain his dragons.  When I stumbled upon a whopping $43.00 worth of in-app charges that I tried to dispute through Amazon (mind you, there was never any password or authorization prompt to deter my kid from continuing, as he is 5 and did not know better), it became apparent to me that the designers and programmers of this app are banking on the naivety and unawareness of the consumer.  I mean really, the option to purchase treasure chests of gold and gems for $0.99 to $99.99???  Just ridiculous!  I will be deleting this trash from my child's tablet.  Be forewarned!
B0091REZMW|3.0|The game is fun however you need diamonds to complete some things and you have to buy those. I like the different challenges.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Got this on the Daily Deal and installed it on my Kindle Fire.  I find his music so relaxing and this has most of his best.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|This is a pretty good primer on Intent, or Law of Attraction, though neither term is used. I got it because it was recommended by a friend who swears it gave him the chops to become CEO of his own company and a multi-millionaire. For myself I found it a good take on stuff I had studied in other contexts, but not ground breaking.<br />My buddy achieved his success by using this to formulate his own affirmations and then recording them so they played during REM sleep. For him that worked like a charm.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I try to keep up with Nelson DeMille, because I don/t want to miss any of his new releases, but I had missed this one until it appeared on my new Kindle. This book is as good as any of his previous books, and I have read all of them, a rare treat.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|This is a great movie.  I have read the book  on recomendation of my Grandson.  He loves this series.  Thanks
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Love the series.  I love watching on the computer without commercials.  I work 14 hours a day and enjoy watching what I want when I want.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Awesome writer, awesome book. My favorite Stephen King book so far. A fantastic trip back in time. Three more words.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds Seasons, in my opinion, is more fun than the initial version.  I like the variety of backgrounds and challenges, they are all more entertaining.  I was getting a little bored with the other version, but Seasons got me interested again.
