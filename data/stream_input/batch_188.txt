B00005QGAT|5.0|As the lead singer of the Jackson 5, Michael Jackson had already been labeled a legend at a young age; but OFF THE WALL introduced the world to the adult Michael Jackson, and proved that he was still very much worthy of that label. It was the real beginning for Michael as a solo artist, and opened the doors for his next album THRILLER, which would become the greatest selling album of all time and help foist upon a Jackson a new title: King Of Pop.<br />Under the supervision of Quincy Jones, OFF THE WALL illustrated some of Jackson's most soulful material. The title-track is among the album's smoothest, and introduces his silky feel for the dance-floor. The lively &quot;Working Day And Night&quot; was a teaser for the singles &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Rock With You,&quot; both of which reached #1 on the pop charts. Slowing down the pace, the album also hosted some romantic tunes which, through the years, have become classics in their own right. With &quot;Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;She's Out Of My Life,&quot; Michael proved that he never lost his golden touch when it came to love songs. Other highlights include the soulful &quot;I Can't Help It&quot;.<br />This version contains bonus material, such as demo versions of &quot;Dont Stop Til You Get Enough&quot;, and interviews, and bonus tracks. This is clearly one of his best albums, making it essential for your collection. OFF THE WALL provides a unique sound, and its still ahead of its time even more than 20 years later.
B000002OX5|4.0|Though not The Who's best, or even a necessary album for the average Classic Rock fan, it is still a fun album. This is a concept album where the cd plays like a 60's pirate radio station in Britain, filled with commercials between songs (unfortunately the band was rushed into finishing quickly and the second half of the album has few commercials). Those are fun, and are in my opinion, the achievement of this album. There are some good songs here, though nothing extraordinary. The songs are pop, psycedelic, and rock. I don't like a couple of the songs, but the concept is a lot of fun.<br />I would not recommend this album to anyone who does not already own &quot;Who's Next,&quot; &quot;Live at Leeds,&quot; &quot;Tommy,&quot; AND &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; simply because this album just is not as good as those 4. If you are new to The Who, I'd start with &quot;Who's Next.&quot;<br />I really give it 3.5 stars, but I'll round up.
B00005A46T|5.0|Well after listening to the IOWA fully, I had to come back to write what i think about all the tracks:<br />(515) - Intro<BR>People = S*** - 5/5  My Favorite track on the CD<br />Disasterpiece - 5/5  Good song, drags on a tiny bit though<br />My Plague - 4/5  Good melodic chorus but I think this track could be a bit better<br />Everything Ends -  3/5  Worst track on the CD. Don't get me wrong the music is good, but the lyrics ruin the track<br />The Heretic Anthem - 5/5  Pure rage, one of my favorites<br />Gently - 4/5  Has a long intro, then explodes into loud music<br />Left Behind - 5/5  Awesome song, really shows what these guys can do.<br />The Shape - 4/5  Good song but it can be a bit repetitive.<br />I Am Hated - 5/5  I love this song, its probably the closest to the old rapcore style of Slipknot.<br />Skin Ticket - 4/5  Good slow song but drags on and is repetitive.<br />New Abortion - 5/5  Good song very instrumental<br />Metabolic - 5/5  My second favorite track on the CD, Loud and noisy, awesome track.<br />Iowa - 4/5  The lyrics are scary, the music is awesome, but is it really necessary to drag the song on for 15 minutes?<br />So all in all this is one of my favorite CDs and it shows that Slipknot has really changed from the rapcore style to plain brutal death metal. I'm not sure if it surpasses the first one, but IOWA is just as good as Slipknot's debut.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|THRILLER became the most successful album in history, selling over 50 million worldwide. And its easy to see why. Michael Jackson is simply good at what he does. The music is irresistible, you can't help but dance or sing along. The music is original, like no other music out there. He paved the way for many artists, and its easy to see why people call him a legend, because he is. THRILLER is one of his shining moments in his career, and it proved to be a huge success for him. The &quot;Thriller&quot; short film became famous for its screenplay and film work, and rightfully so, the choreography was excellent and like nothing else. Other big hits from this album include &quot;Beat It&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; (with Paul McCartney), &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Something&quot;, and more. This version comes with bonus tracks, demo versions, and a lot of interviews with Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton. This is a must have, if you don't have it or want to revisit the magic, this one's a good one to buy.
8478884955|4.0|If you read Harry Potter in English and speak Spanish (very very well) you will be greatly disappointed. The translation is soooo Castillian. By the way, for the translators: bacon is tocino, tocineta... elf is duende, elfo.. well only used in Spain.<BR>I understand that Harry lives in Europe, but there are more Spanish speakers in America, it will be great if the translation will be more &quot;continental&quot;.
B000002BVN|5.0|BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR nearly snuck into record stores, preceded by a strange absence of hype. The implicit message of its five new songs, like that of the non-marketing campaign for the album, seems to be: enough already, let's get back to the music. The title song, a colder re-write of the Jackson classic &quot;Billie Jean,&quot; draws you in, but Jackson quickly gets to the heart of the album with two astonishing songs that address his public image. &quot;Ghosts&quot; has an icy, metallic beat, while &quot;Is It Scary&quot; has the dramatic flair of abig pop ballad, but they feature nearly identical opening verses about ghosts and ghouls behind the walls and under the bed. In the former song, the ghouls are the paparazzi snapping pictures of Jackson's baby, and he asks of them, &quot;Who gave you the right...Are you the ghost of jealousy?&quot; In the next song, the ghosts turn out to be the many public faces of Michael Jackson, and he turns the image around, suggesting that ghoulishness is in the eye of the beholder: &quot;If you wanna see eccentricalities/I'll begrotesque before your eyes...Is that scary for you, baby?&quot;<br />It's a declaration of self-confidence, and Jackson follows with feisty remixes of songs from HISTORY, including a version of &quot;2 Bad&quot; peppered with a sample of &quot;Beat It,&quot; and a Madonna-like disco mix of &quot;Stranger In Moscow.&quot; Overall its a good buy but if you're not a fan of remixes, I'd suggest this one for hardcore MJ fans.
B00000J7JO|5.0|The Chili Peppers have always had a unique sound.  I was one of the many who jumped on their band wagon upon hearing &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magic&quot; years ago.  Well, when this one came out a couple of years back, I was equally impressed.  Sure this album isn't quite as heavy as previous efforts, but it is still magnificent.  And for sure, there is still plenty of funk to go around.<br />The singles are awesome.  &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; and &quot;Californication&quot; are somewhat mellow but quite melodic.  Same with &quot;Otherside&quot;, which is a true album highlight with it's melody and chorus.  This may be my favorite slow song by these guys since &quot;Breaking The Girl&quot; was released off of BSSM.  &quot;Around The World&quot; gets the album off to a catchy start and proves the Chili Peppers still have that funk element in their music.<br />Other standout tracks include funk-driven tracks &quot;Get On Top&quot; and &quot;I Like Dirt&quot; as well as the surprisingly mellow but very memorable closing track &quot;Road Trippin'&quot;.  All in all a great effort by the guys.  Awesome concert promoting the album as well.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson's monumental collection HISTORY BOOK 1 seeks to make two points. The first disc--chock full of hits spanning Jackson's Epic Records solo career--tries to establish how the so-called King of Pop earned that nickname in the first place; the second disc, featuring fifteen new, star-studded tracks, makes a case for him holding onto that royal moniker well into the next century. And though many may dismiss both directives as the product of Jackson camp hype, once the music begins it's hard to deny him any title he wishes to bestow upon himself.<br />All of the songs on HISTORY's first disc have already been ingrained in the minds of the radio-listening, MTV-watching public. From the funky disco of 1979's &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,&quot; through the countless and diverse THRILLER hits (&quot;Billie Jean,&quot; &quot;The Girl Is Mine,&quot; etc.), to the anthemic peace-in-our-time ballad &quot;Heal The World,&quot; Jackson's star-power-fueled singles invested the mainstream withblack pop's soulfulness to the point where black pop became the mainstream. And Jackson, subsequently, became pop's king.<br />On the second disc, Jackson tries to retain a hold over his current empire while moving toward a more street-wise, hip-hop-tinged pop. &quot;Scream,&quot; a duet with sister Janet, is prototypical. The beats are cold and stone-hard, and effuse grey noise electric discharges. Yet after multiple listens the song's simple chorus and minimalist melody imbed themselves in the cranium. The haunting &quot;Stranger In Moscow&quot; is one of his finest recordings in years. Same goes for the change-the-world song &quot;Earth Song&quot;. Same goes for the mildly controversial &quot;They Don't Care About Us,&quot; where Jackson near-raps a stream of nonsequiturs, amidst various urban-life samples, over a busy hip-hop beat. In fact, considering hip-hop's deep influence on HISTORY's new tracks, it seems the King has seen the future of his kingdom and has begun to act accordingly.
B0000026CM|5.0|This album is the closest-sounding thing to the legendary pop/rock huge seller Toto IV that came out 3 albums and 6 years earlier.  While the hits off of Toto IV are some of the best songs Toto has ever had, song for song this album as a whole is at least as good.  &quot;Pamela&quot; was the only top 40 hit off this effort, however (Toto's last one ever).  Numerous other songs could have been hits.<br />Take the sweet ballad &quot;Anna&quot;, another great Steve Lukather-sung ballad.  How about the catchy mid-tempo anthem &quot;Stop Loving You&quot;?  &quot;Straight For the Heart&quot; and &quot;Stay Away&quot; are both catchy tracks that were released if I remember correctly, but they barely made a dent in the charts.  &quot;These Chains&quot; is another sweet ballad that sounds like it should be a big hit as well.  &quot;Mushanga&quot; has a drum beat that is as memorable as &quot;Africa&quot;, and &quot;Home of the Brave&quot; is a remarkably uptempo ending to this terrific album.<br />This effort was truly the last hurrah for Toto as far as any commercial success in the United States goes.  (They put out more fine albums in the 1990s that virtually no one payed attention to--which is a shame because they are still great.)  For sure, it stands up musically with other Toto albums.  It is a fantastic, variety-filled compilation of some of the highest quality melodic pop/rock you could ever hope to hear.
B00005QGAX|5.0|How do you follow up the success of one of the best albums of all times (THRILLER)? Well BAD is a good place to start. Released 5 years after THRILLER, BAD was quite the contrary to the album, its quite good actually. BAD proves to move Michael further into music, expanding his roots a little and trying new things, and he does it well. BAD does not try to be THRILLER, just like how none of his albums are like each other, they are all distinct and different from each other. At this point in 1987 he was called the King of Pop, and rightfully so. Big hits from this album include &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&quot;, &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, &quot;Man In The Mirror&quot;, &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and other hits include &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; and more. This is the Special Edition of BAD including many interviews with the likes of Quincy Jones, and as well some bonus unreleased tracks. Well worth the money!
0563214546|5.0|Being a Brit, I have been familiar with Delia Smith for a long time and she never fails.  I have shelves of cookbooks and Delia is always the first author I reach for.  Her recipes ALWAYS work as they should and taste as they ought.  You will not be disappointed with any of her books, but the Complete Illustrated Cookery Course is a must as a kitchen staple.
B00005QGAV|5.0|Let me start by saying, the only difference between this album and the original DANGEROUS is that this one is remastered. There is new pictures in the booklet as well, like in his other remasters, but there are no extra tracks or interviews. That's no big deal, because DANGEROUS is an excellent album. After a lengthy gap of nearly five years, Jackson had to pull something out of the bag. BAD was, after all, a difficult act to follow, and the press were trying to prove he was bonkers. This was a pretty decent attempt and fell in with the hard dance beat of the early 90s. &quot;Heal The World&quot; was much like the old melodic Jackson, and it became a major hit. &quot;Black Or White&quot; was the best of the rest, a well-constructed song in which he attempted to repeat &quot;Ebony And Ivory&quot; in the context of 90s dance music. Other highlights on the album include &quot;Give In To Me&quot;, &quot;Jam&quot;, &quot;In The Closet&quot;, &quot;Remember The Time&quot;, &quot;Who Is It&quot; and more. Well worth the money!
B00005O3VC|4.0|I'm not going to belabour the film itself - read the other reviews to find out more about how funny the film is. I will say that the picture quality of this version is far above any previous print of the film I've ever seen. If you've only seen the film on a worn-out VHS copy from the rental store, you'll be in for a treat. The colors are much sharper, and the details jump out at you. I had seen the film almost 100 times and had never been able to read the signs at the beginning of the &quot;Sir Robin&quot; sequence. There still are some film artifacts, but I would expect that from a film as old and cheaply made as this one. I think the job they did restoring the film is very well done.<br />The new mix of the sound is a bit artificial sounding. The music was remixed in stereo, and in certain places, the dialogue has a bit of stereo separation. The narration was completely redone in places, though, and that distracted me. I'm guessing they couldn't find the original narrative track, and with the new music mix, they had to redo it. On the plus side, the overall dialogue is sharper, and I was able to make out certain jokes that I had trouble understanding before. The good news is that they included the original mono soundtrack as well, so try the new mix, and if you don't like it, go back to the original. <br />I can't say enough about the extras. The menus are worth the cost of the DVD alone. Some of the extras are from the Criterion laserdisc, such as the &quot;Scenes in Japanese with translated subtitles&quot; section, but there is also a brand new skit from the film ministry on the proper use of Coconuts! I have yet to find any mind-bending easter eggs, but I'm sure they are there.<br />All in all, this is a great disc for both the Python-maniac and for a newbie who hasn't been introduced to the wacky world of Monty Python!
B000009EAD|5.0|I first heard of Iced Earth a little less than a year ago. I downloaded a few of their songs then, but wasn't too impressed by them. But then just recently, I started to listen to them again and I realized just how good they were. So I went out and bought this CD (since I heard it was their best). And after buying this CD, I can safely say I am not at all disappointed with it.<BR>Iced Earth's music is hard to explain. It's thrashy for the most part, but there is also elements of power metal scattered throughout the CD. Also, almost every other song on this CD starts off with a soft beginning, then comes in with a crushing riff later on. I find this to be very unique and a good way to distinguish the songs from each other. <BR>I strongly recommend this song to all fans of metal. The best songs on it are Stand Alone, Watching Over Me, and Reaping Stone.<BR>Get this CD, you won't be disappointed.
006092988X|5.0|In the first page of this book, Betty Smith writes very gently and calmly of Francie Nolan, a pre-teenager just beginning to step out on the edge of adulthood. And Smith ties the book up neatly at the end as if she's giving a present to the reader ... which she is. This is one of the sweetest, most eloquently written books I have ever had the pleasure of reading. <br />Francie Nolan lives in Brooklyn with her brother Neely, mom Katie and dad Johnny. It is in the early 1900s where the book is set. The family is poor ~~ living almost on the edge of starvation. Francie has taken to reading like a duck takes to water ... once she discovered the joy of reading, she becomes a big bookworm. She is also a keen observer of life around her ~~ her thoughts are often witty and funny as she observes the strange behavior of her mother's sisters and their lives, the neighbors, her brother Neely, her mother and father's relationships with one another. Till Francie grows up to be this amazing woman set on the path of her destiny.<br />Betty Smith takes you along for a wonderful story-filled walk in Brooklyn in the early 20th century. She introduces the smells of old Brooklyn, the noise, the joys and sorrows of being in a poverty-stricken family ~~ the hopes and dreams of the immigrants that left the old country because there was nothing there for them. The hopes and dreams of the parents for their children to have better lives than they did ... falling in love with one another ...  the disappointments of being disappointed by life, the wonder of finding joy in anything new or rediscovering something old. Betty Smith has captured the nuances of life and shares a bit of her soul for us readers to find. <br />What I like most about this book is how much I can relate to Francie and her reading habits and her growing up years. She is full of insecurities and questions, loves to read and takes such joy in reading ... especially when she promised herself that she was going to read every book in the local library, starting from a to z. And Smith captures that longing perfectly, as if she has had the same dreams and desires when she was 11. <br />I can rave about this book forever, but it isn't as much fun as reading this book. This book deserves to be read by everyone who has such joy in reading. This book deserves to be given to young girls on the verge of adulthood and encouraged to be read ... discussed. The love of reading is what all of us here have in common, and reading about it just encourages you to read more! <br />I urge you to buy this book and read it. It's worth every minute and hour of your time. It's one of those rare treasures that won't leave you without leaving a small imprint on your heart. I can guarantee you will fall in love with Francie and her family ... they're just like every other family you know. Just different ... Francie is one character you love to love. Just like I love to read. Don't delay ... buy!
B000002B7M|5.0|This is a great CD. After Ozzy seperated from Black Sabbath, there was doubt about his solo career. But all that changed when Ozzy found Randy Rhoades. Roades is a true guitar viruoso, in all meanings of the word. He single handedly brought Ozzy back to the forefront of metal with his killer riffs and manic solos. <BR>If you want proof of Randy's talent, just listen to Mr. Crowley. The solo in that song is unbelievable, as are most of the solos on this CD.<BR>The best songs on this CD are Crazy Train (of course), Dee, Suicide Solution, and Mr. Crowley.<BR>If you are a fan of metal, there is no reason why you should not own this CD. For one, it's Ozzy! Secondly, it has the (sadly) late, and great guitarist Randy Rhoades. Finally, it has Crazy Train on it, arguably one of the greatest songs ever written.
B00005A46T|5.0|the lyrics and songs are much more heartfelt in this album even though i know that slipknot didn't start out with much of that in the first place.  there are slower more eerie songs that make for a lot of variation.  corey taylors voice is amazing and yes he can sing even though that kind of ruins it in the popy boring song like left behind. the best songs are.... actually they're all prety equally good... i'd rather say the worse songs which are &quot;new abortion&quot; and &quot;left behind.&quot; &quot;metabolic&quot; is only ok and i never actually listen to the 14 minute &quot;Iowa.&quot;  I saw them in concert but it was ruined because not only was i sick but they turned the amps up much louder than for the other bands and it just became irritating.  some of my other favorite bands are mudvayne, fear factory, and spineshank.
B000059MEK|2.0|I really liked homework but I thought its one major downfall was the fact that it's tracks were all much too long. Then came &quot;One More Time&quot; and to be honest it took a while to grow on me. But &quot;Aerodynamic&quot; - what a tune!!!! That, and I heard a few of the other tracks and then I had to get this album. Even on the first listen, all the tracks sound incredably individual and when they grow on you, you just know this is something special. My favourite track has got to be &quot;Digital Love&quot; though. it manages to remind of everything that was great about the 80's in three minutes of great music. <BR>You could point out some of the more downbeat tracks as letting it down to a point, but with it being so hard to write a solid dance album they cant really be blamed. <BR>PS. The videos are GREAT
B00004Z459|5.0|This is the BEST heavy metal/rap CD ever done!!!!  EVERY SONG IS GREAT!!!!  Before this, I HATED rap, but Linkin Park shows its cool if its done right.  Heavy Rock IS TIGHT!!!!  Linkin Park is da BEST BAND EVER!!!!!
0471381985|2.0|Not a bad stab at the basics, but the debt owed to others is immense.  One third of the book consists of excerpts from Warren Buffett's Essays, disorganized, and better read in the collection THE ESSAYS OF WARREN BUFFETT: LESSONS FOR CORPORATE AMERICA (a full compilation by topic, well organized and rave reviewed). The hats off to some other top investors too, whose profiles are shallow and would be better to read them directly too.  The rest is a skeleton outline, better delivered in several other books on the masters like Buffett and teacher Ben Graham (neither of whom, incidentally, even believe there is such a thing as the title of this book suggests there is--value investing is a redundancy they say, though the authors of this book don't grasp that basic point).
0345448898|5.0|After finishing the 4th Harry Potter book I moped around for a few days lamenting the fact that the next installment isn't due for publication for quite some time. Luckily, a friend of mine suggested the Dark Materials series by Phillip Pullman. Five pages in to The Golden Compass I was hooked. With a &quot;Potter like&quot; fervor I ripped through the first book in two very long nights. After which I was useless at work, but just as satisfied as when I first discovered the work of J.K. Rowlings. A great read!<br />A note to parents: The world that Pullman conjurs is a bit darker than Harry Potter's. There is more violence and some very frightening situations. I'd say 11 and up would be a good age for these books.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is an amazing cd. Their last cd &quot;Make Yourself&quot; was very good also.  I recommend buying this because you'll be amazed at how good they really are!
B00005O3VC|5.0|This is a great DVD with tons of extras, the sing along with the Monks is wonderful, just be careful.  The only problem I have with this DVD is I can not find the &quot;widescreen presentation with pink frilly edges&quot;.  My copy has everything else on the disks, and says it has this, but I can not find the widescreen presentation, and I see no pink frilly edges.<br />As for the movie, everyone else has said it all. :-)

B00005MP58|4.0|A friend of mine told me a few years ago that I would love this movie since I have enjoyed other films such as Emma (w/ Gwyneth Paltrow), Sense &amp; Sensibility (w/ Emma Thompson), and Mansfield Park.  So, when I saw it on A&amp;E as a remastered DVD edition, I decided to buy it from Amazon.<br />And I love this movie!  I have only had it for a little over a week and have watched it twice already!  The dialogue, the actors, the costumes, the settings, everything is wonderful.  The only reason I give it four stars is that I hoped they would add more extras to the DVD menu.  <br />I found nothing wrong with the color or sound as some reviewers mentioned.  In fact, I could hear a clock ticking in the background (not my clock, one in the movie) in a few scenes.  I highly recommend this movie if you're a fan of movies based on Jane Austen's wonderful stories.  You'll love it!  Just make sure you can set aside time for weekly viewings since watching it just once isn't enough! : )
B00004Z459|5.0|When I bought this disc i thought that it would suck and I would only listen to 1 track ,but I was wrong cause all the tracks are awesome and the best one is in the end!
B0000025HG|5.0|\\"Wet\\" (1979) was quite overlooked when it was first released &amp; only praised for the Super-Hit Disco \\"No More Tears/ Enough Is Enough.\\" This Album includes some of the most beautiful melodies and lyrical songs Streisand ever performed. \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\" &amp; \\"After the Rain\\" are two beautiful tracks that Streisand gives her best self. The album is faithful to its title, keeping the \\"Wet\\" theme, which was a great idea. The C. Bayer Sager track \\"Niagara\\" is a winner, while \\"Splish Splash\\" is fun &amp; quite tongue- in -cheek. The album concludes with \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\" a breathtaking pop track that will surely send tingles down your spine! Recommended.
0070511136|5.0|I have had this book for now over 7 years.  I have read this book more than few times -- just like getting a booster shots.  The book is not just for selling or sales people -- it is how you go about dealing with people every day.  You want to be persuasive, convincing, sell your proposal to your better half -- You must read the book. Of course, this is a great book for selling, because, I have used the technique proposed, it works absolutely well.  What this book assumes and tells you is that : People do not buy products, people buy from people.  How do you build that relationship to a stranger.  Read this book.<br />Personally, I believe this is a must own book for most!
B000002LOM|4.0|I actually rate this cd at 4 1/2 stars, just a smidgen under 5. Although not Morrissey's best offering, there are some exceptional cuts here (OUR FRANK, SING YOUR LIFE, KING LEER, FOUND FOUND FOUND, TONY THE PONY). There are only 2 that I skip past when I play it and that I find to be the weakest tracks; Asian Rut and Mute Witness. I thought that this cd showcased his incredible vocal talents in a way no other album has. Morrissey isn't capable of turning out a bad record and although his lastest effort (Maladjusted) didn't fair well with the critics, there are some great tunes to be found on that cd as well.
B000002KDO|5.0|I first got into Black Sabbath about two months ago and have been hooked ever since. Led Zeppelin may get all the credit for bringing Hard Rock to the next level and they are my favorite band. However, I really feel that Black Sabbath deserves just as much credit for cultivating the sound which is known today as Heavy Metal. Master of Reality is one album a true fan of the band should never be without. Sweet Leaf, Into the Void, and Children of the Grave, have great guitar from the very underated Tony Iommi who along with Jimmy Page are the only two guitar players that can really be credited for the development of Heavy Metal. Tony's riffs are often heavier than Page's but Page wins for being a much more skilled acoustic player and producer. Still Iommi is a genius that deserves much more credit than is given to him. Ozzy Osbourne is the perfect signer for this groundbreaking band and has one of the most distinctive voices in the history of Heavy Metal. Bill Ward and Geezer Butler are a powerfull bass and drums team that again are often underated. The power they produced must have been something to behold. Most of all Sabbath's lyrics perfectly fit the style and substance of the Heavy Metal genre. What is most impressive is their ability to deal with religion, war, love, and death in their lyrics that gives their music perfect credibility in a music world filled with absurd fakes trying to be Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath like more than 30 years after the fact. I love After Forever because its a song which cause us all to love and have faith in God yet it condemms those who choose not to believe or even worse use church dogma to judge people. Master of Reality is an outstanding album and wins as my personal favorite from their amazing early career.

It had some historical accuracy but some hollywood mixed with it.<BR>Historicly Accurate:<BR>It used the old model B-17 rather than the more popular G and F models with the nose or chin turret.<BR>The rattleing of the cabin during flight.<BR>The noise of the guns.<BR>Hollywood Added:<BR>The things that happed to Memphis Belle were taken from the scenerios of 4 or 5 planes on the same mission. <BR>Also added by hollywood was the big speach that I think ruined the movies about not killing civilians.<BR>The names were made up.<BR>The camera crew wasn't there.<BR>Their last mission was not a Bremen Aircraft Factory but a Willhelmshaven U-Boat pen.<BR>Special Effects:<BR>The portration of flak was very realistic(compared to the 1944 documentery which was real but hard to see).<BR>The guns were very realistic right down to the way they moved.<BR>They way the first plane took off using mostly rudder was a very good scene.<br />All in all the movie was great as a B-17 movie but as a movie on a historic event it wasn't historic at all good. I encourage you to see this movie based on the historical accuracy of the plane itself, but don't use this as a history lesson.

B000002KDS|5.0|ALRIGHT LET ME FIRST SAY THAT THE 13 YEAR OLD BOY THAT SAID SOME OF ALICES LATER ALBUMS ARE CRAP REALLY DOESNT UNDERSTAND MUSIC ALL TOO WELL. THERES NO SUCH THING AS A BAD ALICE ALBUM. THIS ALBUM IS LOADED WITH ALL GREAT SONGS AND HALO OF FLIES IS A MASTERPIECE. BUY THIS ALBUM AT ALL COSTS
B00003CXQY|4.0|Even if you do not like Disney's post-&quot;Lion King&quot; attempts, you still have to give the studio credit for making each movie so diverse from each other. &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot;, is without a doubt the most comical of Disney's movies. Odd thing is, that if you weren't to see the &quot;Walt Disney Pictures&quot; intro, you would'nt know it was Disney. This is becuase &quot;New Groove&quot; departs in both animation &amp; story-telling styles that has been Disney's trademark. This film is narrated by the film's main character, Emperor Kuzco, and has more of a fast pace Saturday morning cartoon feel to it (that's not a bad thing, BTW).<br />In the story of trying to destroy the emperor but instead turning him into a Llama, the villains once again steal the show. However, unlike &quot;Hercules&quot;, the good guys are characters you like and care about. It's just that Yzma (probably the most outragoeus of all the Disney villains) and Kronk have all the qualities of live action comedian, including timeing and style that makes you want to laugh. Kuzco and Pacha, have funny moments to, but some of them are forced.<br />The DTS 5.1 track on the DVD is awesome, and the digital-to-digital transfer is flawless.<br />It is a whole lot more comedic than &quot;Aladdin&quot;, but it's not the same type of movie. &quot;Aladdin&quot; has comedic releif, in an otherwise serious adventure tale. While, &quot;The Emperor's New Groove&quot; has some dramatic relief in an otherwise hysterical adventure tale. Great submission from Disney!
B000059XYM|5.0|You all heard about this movie called Scary Movie. Well for one thing it's the funniest movie ever made. It mainly was made to poke fun at Scream and I Know What You Did Lat Summer. That's why it's so funny. The sick jokes are the funniest. In my opinion the drug jokes are the funniest part. My favorite part is when the killer is chillin' with a group of guys and they are smoking pot out of a fish tank. This is the funniest movie ever made. Watch it tonight.
B00005KARK|5.0|What's amazing about Disney's 4th feature, &quot;Dumbo&quot;, is that it is probably one of the most simple looking animated features of all time, yet it is one of the best. Proving that even the most detailed art is not required to carry a movie, most of the films backgrounds and characters are not as intricate and detailed as &quot;Snow White&quot; or &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, they are VERY simple. &quot;Dumbo&quot; instead relys on a good story, that I'm sure you are fimiliar with. A simple, but rich 64 minutes telling the story of a baby elephant with big ears, that is an outcast. The reason that this movie has lasted for so long, aside from being Disney, is that everyone can relate to it, as said throughout the disc's extras and commentary.<br />The DVD has a good Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, but I was rather disappointed with the picture quality. It claims to have a remastered picture, but there is so much grain, and dirt throughout the feature. After what Disney DVD did for &quot;Snow White&quot;, I was expecting a little more for this release. The extras are great: the commentary is very informative, the concept arts are interesting, and &quot;Celebrating Dumbo&quot; is a good enough featurette. The only negative is that Disney Co. is continuing to ruin the classics, by attaching unnecessary sequels. Inferior by existing Disney video sequel reputation, &quot;Dumbo II&quot; is on it's way.<br />&quot;Dumbo&quot;, costing only $800,000, saved Disney from the WWII-caused financial failures of &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;Fantasia&quot;. So it is one of the important stepping blocks of Disney's history and one of the most enjoyable animated features of all time.
0441172717|3.0|A fascinating concept, well executed.  I particularly liked the blade fights and the desert culture Herbert created.  I defy anyone to read this book without getting thirsty.  Only beef: I think the book could have been as good with about 75 fewer pages.  <br />Dune is a great book for those who like science fiction.  I am not sure if it merits another two-dozen sequels, though.<br />Be sure to catch the newest Dune sequels coming out: <br />&quot;Son of the Cousin of the Messiah from the House of Atreides that Jack Built&quot;<br />AND... <br />&quot;Milking the Dune Pony for Every Freaking Dime&quot;<br />(both also by Herbert)
B00004R99F|4.0|Had this movie been made as a full fledge addition to Disney's classic library, this would not do. But just as a pleasent revisit to one of Disney's all time great characters, it better than O.K.<br />The movie deals with a story that I'm sure most sons and dads can relate to, the seperation that begins as the son grows and wants more independence. Max, Goofy's son, has a crush on a girl but a recent event at school leads Goofy to believe that he hasn't been paying much attention to his son. So Goofy plans a road trip for the summer, much to Max's dismay. But before they leave, Max lies to his friends by saying that he is going to L.A to a concert of a popular singer. When Goofy puts Max in charge of the map, he deceives his father by re-routing their trip through L.A., so he can be popular in the eys of his girl<br />The movie is well done, no contrived story or anything like that. Had it been inducted into the &quot;Disney Classic&quot; library, a lot more work would have needed to be done as far as quality goes.<br />The DVD unfortunately, does not present the film in it's original aspect ratio, but does make up for it by including two Goofy Cartoons, each about 20 mins. The first one is recent, &quot;Calling All Goofs&quot; dealing with a Goof family reunion. And the second one is vintage with Goofy helping Donald and Mickey escape from their angry (and unpaid) landlord.
B00005R87Q|4.0|This is my kind of movie.  The B-movie genre just got bumped up to B+.  It has all the ingredients: fast cars, beautiful women, pounds of testosterone, and over-acting.  Vin Diesel looks as if he has a promising future.  All in all, if you don't take this one too seriously, you will have a great viewing experience.
B00004R997|4.0|I was not really fimiliar with Walt's &quot;Package Features&quot; until their DVD release. &quot;Saludos Amigos&quot;, Disney's 6th feature for the first time on DVD, is the first of these features, a style that Walt wouln't abandon until &quot;Cinderella&quot;. <br />Since this movie is considered one of Disney's &quot;Classic Films&quot;, it would make it the shortest one ever (45 minutes), but don't let the short time put you off, it is actually a very good length to tell the stories of the film.<br />&quot;Saludos Amigos&quot; is split into 4 animated stories, with some live action intros in between, all taking place in South America. The first, and the best one, is Donald Duck's &quot;Lake Titicaca&quot;, where the feathered tourist explores the lake and the town arround it, with some comical twists, narrated all the way through.  &quot;El Gaucho Goofy&quot; is a funny story, of transplanting a Texas Cowboy (Goofy), in the middle of South America. The other subjects are &quot;Pedro&quot;, the story of a determined plane, and &quot;Aquarelo Do Brasil&quot; where we meet Joe Carioca.<br />The film on the whole has more of a documentary tone, giving us insight on South America (&quot;The Three Caballeros&quot; focuses more on Mexico).<br />The Gold Collection DVD, has a great documentary which shows us Walt Disney's trip to South America, and the development of the film.
B00003CY0V|2.0|&quot;Swordfish&quot; is not much of a movie, but it had the &quot;good fortune&quot; to be released earlier this year, well in advance of the horrific events of 9.11.<br />Had Warner Brothers scheduled &quot;Swordfish&quot; for a Fall release , it would have met the fate of &quot;Collateral Damage&quot; and a number of other action films with terrorist themes and ordered shelved indefinitely.<br />The video/DVD release coming as it does this week gives what is nothing more than a routine action thriller a certain relevance and almost creepy sort of resonance.<br />The John Travolta character, a fierce professional anti-terrorist who uses any means to wipe out the Bin Ladens of the world probably appeared excessive before the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon...in light of 9.11, we all would probably like to see such an operative working at every CIA station in the world.<br />The DVD boasts excellent video and audio transfer and includes some nice special features: a &quot;Making OF&quot; documentary...three alternate endings and director's commentary.<br />One extra note: Hallie Berrie's topless scene should be a favorite of every male DVD owner with a penchant for the rewind button.
B00004R99L|4.0|Without a doubt, Walt Disney's 13th Animated feature is the most famous telling of &quot;Alice In Wonderland&quot; out there. The story is fimiliar to most, Alice dreams of a White Rabbit racing against his clock, proclaiming that he's late. Alice's curiosity wins, and she follows, leading to her falling into Wonderland.<br />&quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; finds it's strength by mining Carrol's original tale for rich sequences, that are then transplanted into the film to the full extent of Walt Disney's animator's imagination. The film has it's weakness: story pacing. Unlike other of Walt's creations, this one does not have great transitions to take us through Alice's journey. It's just one thing, followed all of a sudden by another.<br />The Gold Collection DVD, contains an insightful documentary of Walt Disney taking us through the making of the movie with appearences by the real life actors modeling for the animators.<br />I also think that instead of Disney continuing to ruin Walt's classics by making contrived, unnecessary video sequels, they should mine Carrol's &quot;Alice Through The Looking Glass&quot; to make a justified sequel out of this one.
0446608955|4.0|A Walk to Remember was very quick &amp; detailed up until the end.  I was very disappointed with the ending.  I felt like I had missed something in reading.  The ending left me wondering more about what actually happened &amp; I was confused by the whole thing.
0440219078|5.0|One of the few books that I can ever read past the first few chapters, Lois Lowry's &quot;The Giver&quot; has easily made its way into one of my favorite books.  It's amazing how many only 170 some odd pages can work on so many levels- emotionally, socially, politically- and still pull it off.  Lowry perfectly brings a coming-of-age boy (Jonas) forced to live in a seemingly &quot;perfect&quot; community into receiving the truth about the past, a past where pain existed, a past where feelings existed.  Jonas' own naivete towards the world is the most interesting part of the book; watching him come to his own revelations about the very society he lives in, and the pure simplicity of his convictions: &quot;But we SHOULD have choices!&quot; Lowry leaves a lot of the book open for you to fill in the structure- she never really explains the whole concept of why people moved to &quot;Sameness,&quot; and I really think that's for the best.  I think it gives the message that maybe we really aren't made for perfection- because, perhaps, beauty comes in imperfection.  A classic.
B00000INEX|1.0|Given that my son loves Baby Mozart, I went out and bought a number of other tapes, including Baby Bach. Wish I had read some of the reviews before hand! This video is simply not as good as the Mozart one. I was disappointed that the creator's children are featured in it as well. Loud and out of place laughs seem to startle my son. The graphics are similar, but I'm beginning to feel that &quot;if you've seen one you've seen them all&quot; and in this case, I recommend against buying this tape.
B00003CWPL|5.0|I have yet to see a film that has captured my imagination the way that this one has.  I won't bother going on and on about why that is.. chances are, you already know.  I'm just writing this to say that i can't wait until this film is available on DVD.  I've heard rumors that Lynch himself is doing the transfer, and that it will be available on his website when it finally goes live.  I hope this is true, because my bootlegged vhs of this looks terrible.. i have yet to see this film with any clarity... i know that it should, ideally, be seen on the big screen.. but, i don't see it playing anywhere.  So, to whoever can make this disc happen, we're waiting patiently..
B00005OAA6|4.0|After 2 terrific LP's from Geri Halliwell (Schizophonic and Scream If You Wanna Go Faster), brilliant work from Melanie C (Northern Star) and Emma Bunton (A Girl Like Me) and a not up to spice standard effort from Melanie B (Hot), Posh Spice Victoria Beckham was the last of the (present) Spice Girls to release a solo CD and whilst it does offer several enjoyable tunes, all the hype and anticipation surrounding the CD was a waste of time as it is pretty much like anything else.  Not that CD is bad, it's just that the overworking of publicity made the CD out to be something that it's not.<br />Looking at the self titled work from Beckham, the up-beat tunes are definitely the ones that win listeners over as her ballads (Including tributes to husband David Beckham and son Brooklyn) are a little too sugary to swallow.  The slower paced tunes like &quot;I.O.U.&quot; and &quot;Every Part Of Me&quot; are not nearly as enjoyable as the up-tempo numbers Beckham comes out with.  Opening single &quot;Not Such An Innocent Girl&quot; is a credible pop ditty, but there is definitely stronger material on board.  Winners on the 12 track long album would be the likes of slinky R&amp;B beats &quot;I Wish&quot; and &quot;Like That&quot;, dancefloor funk/R&amp;B &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, Janet Jackson type &quot;Midnight Fantasy&quot; and the urban electronica pop of &quot;Whatcha Talkin' Bout&quot;.<br />Sure &quot;Victoria Beckham&quot; is not gonna be everyone's cup of tea, but Spice fans should check it out and anyone who's interested in knowing if the girl can actually sing.  Whilst not as strong as the efforts from Halliwell or Bunton, it is a stronger LP than that of Melanie B and she can be proud of that.
B00005NP04|5.0|One word sums this album up-AMAZING!  Greatest Hits albums are always awesome because you basically know what songs are on it and if you don't like them..don't get it.  I love everyone of Martina's songs..From &quot;Independence Day&quot; to &quot;Whatever You Say&quot; and &quot;Valentine.&quot;  The 3 new tracks (not including God Fearin Women): &quot;Where Would You Be&quot;, &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; and &quot;Blessed&quot; are great.  It's always good to hear a new Martina song.  My favorite of these 3 is &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; because it shows her best vocal performances yet.  I thought it was cool that she put &quot;Strangers&quot; in this collection even though it was never released.  I've always liked this song. She considers it her &quot;Greatest Miss&quot; and I totally agree on that one.  I could never give under 5 stars on any Martina album..although I do have one complaint..3 songs that I think should be included in this collection are: &quot;The Time Has Come&quot; (even though it wasn't a big hit, it was her first single..I just thought it should have been included), &quot;Cry On The Shoulder Of The Road&quot; (cuz I LOVE this song) and &quot;Still Holding On&quot; (Also because it's a great song).  Just to add one more thing..In my opinion &quot;Evolution&quot; is her best album (besides this one) and if you like Martina and don't own it...then go out and buy it..you will not be disappointed!!!
B00005QAPH|2.0|After watching this movie I really wish I had those two hours back.  People will say it went over my head, but I will beg to differ.  I just didn't enjoy the film.  Sure it is an art film, and is one of the, if not the first, to explore freely flowing thoughts.  But give me a break, how predictable can this thing be.  Throw in Strange Religious imagery to show my strict Catholic upbringing.  Add alittle dream girl (Claudio) to represent my dissatisfaction and struggles in my love life.  Make Guido a director so the viewer knows it is a movie about me.  I won't ruin the ending, but you could just fast forward to it.  Whola, 8 1/2.  This movie just isn't as good as everyone says it is.<BR>I really wish someone would have the courage to say this movie sucks!  Everybody jump on the bandwagon, just because &quot;critics&quot; love it doesn't mean you have to give it glowing reviews too.  I understand, you have a reputation to keep up, what would the other people at the &quot;art-house&quot; say if you disagreed.  And why wouldn't you buy it, you need to own every film in the &quot;Criterion Collection&quot;!  Come on, admit it, you also have The Rock, and Armageddon, and not because you like the films, you need to impress your friends.  It is really kind of sad actually seeing all these sheep leading other sheep. 2 stars at best.
0380796090|4.0|This book was a great book. It was the first Marian Keyes book I've read and I know it won't be my last.<br />Claire is a woman who has been dumped on the day of having her child. She doesn't know where to go or what to do. So she heads off to Dublin to stay with her family.<br />At times in this book some of what happen just didn't seem possible to me for a woman who is getting over being left by her husband. Claire was strong at times but at other times I felt she was very weak in some of her choices. James on the other hand I felt was a jerk who needed to get a life. Claires family was a riot her sister Helen who seem to have more life problems and they always seem to be more important that Claire's. Anna who seem to be off in her own world and of couse Claire parents they reminded me of my own parents who still look out for me. Overall I felt that this book was a wonderful quick read and kept me into the story always wanting to know more about what was going to happen to Claire of what she would say.<br />Overall the reason why I only gave this book 4 stars was because I felt that there a lot left out and there could have been a lot to go with the story.
B0000214F4|1.0|An absurd plot premise, leaden acting from the romantic leads,<br />long, empty head shots, heavy-handed directing, an utter<br />lack of movement or action, even the romance is senseless<br />and illogical. Positively painful to watch. A film suitable<br />only for Pitt-iphiliacs who can endure countless repetitions<br />of his two facial expressions - coyly feigned incomprehension,<br />the dawning sly smile. Pardon while I puke....
0553106635|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed all three of these volumes. This book has an exteremely lifelike presence to it with all of its vibrant characters and detailed storylines. Keep going Martin.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Once you plug into this CD, you aren't going to want to turn it off.  While some critics maintain the DJ is less present, he is distinctive throughout every song.  Even on the gentle, Chinaesque &quot;Aqueous Transmission,&quot; listeners will unearth subtle scratching from stellar acoustic guitars and Brandon Boyd's pleeding and sometimes hypnotic vocals.  Incubus brings hard and mellow rock together on &quot;Morning View,&quot; like &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot;.  &quot;Circles,&quot; &quot;Have You Ever,&quot; and &quot;Under my Umbrella&quot; are hard core, but the rest of the album is driving, pleasureful, and throbbing.  This album is a MUST-HAVE.  I've never heard so many great songs on one album.  You're going to hear 10 of these songs on the radio and the name &quot;Morning View&quot; mentioned in the same sentence as Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind.&quot;
0767903862|5.0|During my two years working for a certain book store I resisted reading any Bill Bryson, despite having it constantly recommended to me.  I was extremely nervous that they wouldn't live up to my expectations, which I must admit were extremely high.  I really shouldn't have worried!  It was absolutely excellent!  <br />I fell in love with In a Sunburned Country almost immediately, it was funny and informative, but more than anything else I related with Bryson in a way that no girl my age has a right to.  Infact though, its hard to see how anyone could not share his delight in monotremes and stromatolites or cringe just a little when he discovered that he had drunkenly agreed to a house swap. And who can resist tidbits like the alleged nuclear bomb set off by Aum Shinrikyo in the outback.  <br />Bryson's work is consistenetly excellent and I see several of his books in my very near future and I can hardly wait.  My only fear is that I won't get to satisfy my curosity about Uluru and Ned Kelly before I have a whole new set of sites to explore.

B00005MP58|5.0|Pride and Prejudice remains one of my favourite romance novels of all times and the movie version with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth was so well done that I was determined to own the DVD version. Needless to say I have watched it many, many times now and still enjoy every minute of it. The acting was brilliant especially by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth and the script was very much in accordance to Jane Austen's book which was very pleasing to see. I only wished there were many more scenes where Darcy and Elizabeth could be seen together. I also enjoyed the extra features on the DVD but was disappointed to see there was no interview with Jennifer and Colin. To sum it up, it is a must own for someone who loves Jane Austen esp. P&amp;P!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|&quot;This is a sad and lonesome day.&quot; (Bob Dylan, &quot;Lonesome Day Blues&quot;, Love and Theft)<BR>I wonder what Bob Dylan's new CD, Love And Theft, would have sounded like before 9/11. Since it was released on that day and since he had not been singing any of the new songs in concert, nobody heard any of the songs before 9/11(with the exception of &quot;Mississippi,&quot; previously covered by Sheryl Crow).  Therefore, it is impossible to listen to this work through anything but our post-9/11 prism. And therefore we must, for now, forget that Love And Theft is a brilliant tour through a century of American music co-existing with typical Dylanesque world-weary, apocalyptical, biblical and humor-laced lyrics. Now the songs play so eerily that they eerily beg the question: What did Bob Dylan know and when did he know it?<BR>How can one take this line from &quot;Moonlight&quot; as anything but a capturing of patriotic fervor unleashed on 9/11, even by those normally dovish: &quot;I'm preaching peace and harmony/the blessings of tranquility/ yet I know when the time is right to strike.&quot; Or, from &quot;Floater&quot;: &quot;If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again/you do so at the peril of your own life/I'm not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound/I've seen enough heartache and strife.&quot; <BR>And what about those characters &quot;Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum&quot;? What else can this song be about but America strutting around in post-Gulf War bliss, while the so-called defeated in that war have dispatched Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee to infiltrate and plan a rematch: &quot;They're living in the Land of Nod/they're trusting their fate to the hands of God/they pass by so quietly/Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee/They're laying low and making hay/seemed determined to go all the way.&quot;<BR>And is this, from &quot;Lonesome Day Blues,&quot; not now the State Department's primer on how this is a different kind of war: &quot;The  captain, he's decorated/he's well-schooled and he's skilled/He's not sentimental/don't bother him at all how many of his pals have been killed.&quot;<BR>I have every Dylan album and bootlegs to boot and go to more Dylan concerts than most people go to movies, but it took me awhile to listen to Love And Theft. First of all, my record stores found themselves all closed on the long-awaited 9/11 release date. And then anything before 9/11 seemed irrelevant, so I put it off. But in an effort to return to normal, I did the most natural thing to me: I listened to Dylan music. Little did I know that Dylan had somehow created the first post-9/11 American art---art for an America forever changed; art for an America that will never be the same: &quot;The emptiness is endless/cold as the clay/you can always come back/but you can't come back all the way.&quot;

B0000027RL|5.0|When i first heard Pearl Jam's &quot;Ten&quot; in 1992, I thought it was one of the most increadible albums ever recorded.  I listened to every track six or more times and never got sick of it.  Every track on this classic album has a unique mix of musical genius.  &quot;Even Flow&quot;, &quot;Once&quot; ,and &quot;Alive&quot; are the greatest Pearl Jam ballads I have ever heard and the somber toned &quot;Jeremy&quot; gave me a first hand view of teen suicide. No matter how big those songs were, the other tracks are just as much talented and special as those.  &quot;Oceans&quot;, Why Go&quot;,&quot;Garden&quot;, and &quot;Porch&quot; are the other tracks that I thought were just as riviting as the singles that were released that year.  Without a doubt, this album was no cheap rip off of Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;.  In fact, I even think &quot;Ten&quot; was even better.  As the years rolled by &quot;Vs&quot;, &quot;Vitalogy&quot;, &quot;No Code&quot;, and &quot;Binural&quot; were released and no matter how great they were, they didn't compare to &quot;Ten&quot;.  So my fellow customers of Amazon.com, if you could buy one album today, tomorrow, or the next day, come to your senses and by &quot;Ten&quot; or in my opinion, the greatest album of the 90's.
079073463X|4.0|Ladyhawke stands as one of my favorite movies.  I tend to go towards fantasy as a matter of course, but this movie has strong 'chick-flick' elements in it.<br />But I don't care.  Matthew Broderick is delightful as 'the mouse' and Rutger Howard outdid himself in this one.  The story itself is the classic tale of Star-crossed lovers (right down to the enchantment that keeps them apart), but unlike Shakespeare, the lovers get to have each other in the end. This is a true epic fantasy, with a good many original elements.<br />The first thing most people mention when they see this movie is that the musical score is out of place.  I have to admit that that analysis is right on.  The musical scoring for this movie was done by 80's band &quot;The Alan Parsons Project.&quot;  While generally, I have liked their music, the disco-pop electronica that runs through the first third of the movie and many of the action scenes is out of place and poorly chosen.<br />That said, there are points when the music is subtle and well placed.  It would be wonderful if a director's cut would be made of this movie and the music replaced.  Such a project would turn what is at this point a very fine movie (with hokey music) into a classic.<br />I give it a 4. Though I've watched this movie about 10 times, the music really gets on my nerves.  But that's just me.  Give it a look, it's definately worth it.
0679746048|3.0|GIRL, INTERRUPTED is an autobiographical book written by Susanna Kaysen, who was institutionalized at age 18.   She writes of her time spent there, and each chapter is either a separate essay on another aspect of her time there, or an essay talking about how that time of her life affected her present life (25 years later).  <br />As a study on borderline personality disorder,  it was an interesting read. However, as a book I found it  a little disjointed. I also didn't feel anything for the author, because of the way she wrote the book.   I find I could feel something for the main character if the book is written well.  but i couldn't feel a thing for the characters in this book.  <br />Susanna goes into detail the different patients at the hospital where she stayed for nearly 2 years.   Some of the scenes described are very intense.  What i found interesting is that she was narrating what she experienced first hand.  This is the story of a part of her life that changed forever who she was and what she was meant to become.<br />I give it 3 stars because although as a whole it was not what I considered a great book, each chapter was interesting unto itself and kept me wanting to read more.   But i felt a  bit let down when I finaly finished the book.   I hope the movie was better than this.
B000002BYD|5.0|Everyone owned a copy of this album! Yield is great from start to finish, as it is (in my opinion) the epitome that a band like Pearl Jam works for, sort of like their Joshua Tree. This album is definatley one of my favorite works of all time and is tied with Ten (and on occasion Vitalogy) to be my favorite Pearl Jam album (even though I kind of hate having favorites). With songs like In Hiding, Given to Fly, Faithfull, Brain of J, No Way, Wishlist, MFC  and Do the Evolution you will at least have your moneys worth!
B00003CX5P|1.0|This movie is so laughingly bad, it left me speechless. The writing is amateurish, the dialogue gibberish, the sets looked like they were from a Roger Corman film, the plot horrible. My God, what happened? This looks like George Lucas 12 year nephew made it. It's AWFUL.

0375707972|2.0|I did not like this book, not because of the writer's style, but because of its contents.  The protagonist has a moral dilemma because he once loved a woman who became an SS guard during Nazi Germany.  This woman was on trial for the atrocities she committed.  Since she was illiterate, the argument went, she could not properly defend herself.  That sums up the protagonist's moral quandry.  I'm reading the book wondering why someone would want to use ANY defense for the monsters of the Third Reich!  There isn't a punishment on this earth harsh enough for them.  The protagonist once loved this woman, now is trying to say that what she did wasn't as bad as it sounded in court.  In my opinion, he is monstrous as well for loving such a cruel person in the first place.  He further demonstrates what a selfish coward he is later in the book by how he conducted his marriage.  I was generally disgusted by the whole thing.
B000021XS0|4.0|My humble opinion:  Dream Theater is made up of five of the most talented musicians in the progressive rock field.  The addition of Jordan Rudess on keyboards is just natural synergy.  Listen to The Dance of Eternity for proof.  This cut in particular takes my breath away.  Scenes is a compositional tour de force, the culmination of the band's eleven year growth through past works ranging from uneven to astounding. Lyrically, the band's tone has ranged from cathartic to socially caustic.  Scenes travels an operatic story-line, fraught with passion, betrayal and tragedy which makes repeated listening difficult if not in the proper frame of mind.  In future ventures, topics of growth and hope might be a nice balance for their powerful music.
B000056JYB|4.0|A promising debut from the first \\"supergroup\\". Blind Faith offered a lot of potential but never was able to live up to it due to expectations. It's ironic that the band imploded just as Winwood, Clapton, Baker & Grech were discovering the band's \\"sound\\". The sound quality is spectacular and the packaging terrific but stretching it over two discs is a bit much. I personally would much rather have seen this released as a single disc with bonus tracks. What's rather odd is the inclusion of the jams but not the live tracks from the Winwood box set from 1995.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this was a quartet that should have continued (although I, too, could have done without Baker's never-ending Do What You Like. I'm all for everyone having a hand in the writing but Baker was the weakest link as a songwriter in both Cream and Blind Faith). The interplay between the four musicians demonstrates that Blind Faith was an exception to the \\"supergroup\\" rule (i.e., more is less).<br /><br />All of that said it's nice to have everything including the long jams in one set. Polydor made the wise decision to continue to make the single disc album available ( and  not forcing buyers to pony up for extra music they might not want). Clapton's Presence of the Lord, Windwood's Can't Find My Way Home and the remake of Well Alright are all highlights. All of the jams have something of merit but most go on far too long (of course that's subjective).<br /><br />The real reason these deluxe editions exists (including the Who's Live at Leeds) is because of the large bootleg market. Regardless, it's nice to have these releases for collectors and hardcore fans (with great packaging and very good to excellent sound quality).
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Forget new-Disney, this is the real thing. I just love oldfashioned animation, oddly enough I find it more &quot;alive&quot; than the clean and sterile animation of today. Actually, animation hasn't been very interesting to me for many years now, I'm not quite sure when I lost interest but I definitely prefer the very old stuff. I love old cartoons (vintage Tom &amp; Jerry, etc.), and loathe the new cold ones. (Besides, I'm actually more into stop motion animation anyway.) This 2-disc DVD is an absolute must if you're a fan of this movie, and if you don't like this movie you're not an animation fan. Period. The movie is a true classic with a lot of memorable scenes, done the lively way I want my cartoons, oops, animation to look. This is one of the best special edition DVDs I've ever seen, packed with a million goodies too many to mention here. The animated menus are also wonderful, and I bet there must be a few Easter Eggs hidden here and there on these two discs. The one thing I could've done without though, is the Barbra Streisand song presented with clips from the movie in music video style. -The Disney studio seem proud of it, but I see it as an obvious attempt to modernize the movie. This movie needs no updating, and you can always skip the chapter of course. &quot;Snow White&quot; hasn't dated in the least, it's looking more fresh than ever. Forever. P.S., think of the protests if this was a new film; I mean, a young woman living with seven dwarfs !?. Scandalous !.
B00003CXSP|3.0|The makers of this film did not to justice to either the book it is based on, or its theaterical precurser, Silence of the Lambs.  Its difficult not to enjoy Anthony Hopkins in any role, and particullarly that of Hannibal Lecter, but this movie was not nearly as interesting as the first.  Perhaps we were expecting Jodi Foster, and instead got Julianne Moore.<br />The DVD itself offers several alternate endings, and I was really hoping one of them would validate the movie.  Don't be fooled.  They are merely reshootings of the current ending, with a word or two thrown in or neglected.<br />I suggest you rent it before you buy it.
B00005Q45W|4.0|Buy this album for track #1 and #9.  It is essential Cohen, as in \\"Blue Raincoat\\" \\"Suzanne\\" etc. He has moved away from sex to chronicle the struggling chemical dependent.  The rest of the CD is smooth listening with the addition of female voices making this one of the most mellow Cohen works to date.  Nothing schitzophrentic here or in your face.  Some of the songs blend together as just too damn similar, as if Cohen was trying to be too commercial.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is great. It's got softer stuff for the &quot; drive &quot; fans, and a few harder songs that sound like a mix of Make Yourself and S.C.I.E.N.C.E.    This is a fanastic record. All the songs are expertly produced and well written. The songs all have their own sound and great hooks. The songs that stand out are: <BR>   Under My Umbrella. A great harder track.<BR>   Mexico. The softest song on the record with just a acoustic guitar and a cello.<BR>   Blood On The Ground. The angriest song on the album.<BR>   Aqueous Transmission. A very soothing ender with a smooth japanese style sound.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|I remember playing this over and Over, it was the first Music album I ever bought. ..
0380973634|5.0|Neverwhere, Neil Gaiman's first atempt as a soloist author left me spellbound.  Somehow manageing to incorporate all of the magic that has filled his graphic novels.  Never have I felt a book more deserving of the praise &quot;Non stop action packed joy ride&quot;.  Magic, Mystery, and mayham.  I would recomend this book to anyone seeking an enjoyable read.

B00000IOSU|5.0|The first thing that will strike you when this cd starts to play, is the sound. It is so clear and vibrant, you can feel the energy running through the crowd, and the music has such power. At first I was reluctant to buy this album, as I have most of the songs on her studio albums anyway. But now, I am so glad I did. They are just so much more powerful performed live like this. I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves Sarah's music, no matter how many of her studio albums you may have. The 20 page booklet contains all lyrics and photos of Sarah and the musicians. This is also an enhanced cd, with interesting features.
B00005QGAX|4.0|Perhaps one of his most consistant efforts.  Has a dated feel about, some of those synth solos sounds very late 80's but something of a hidden Gem...
B00000DHRX|5.0|2 cds filled with 28 terrific songs. Who could ask for more? Well, we get it anyway, because along with each cd comes a 32 page book. That makes 64 pages altogether, that come complete with all the lyrics plus tons of photos of George. A must, for any fan. The first cd is full of George's best romantic ballads, aptly titled &quot;For the Heart&quot;. The 2nd cd is of his more upbeat dance songs, also aptly titled, &quot;For the Feet&quot;. So no matter what kind of mood you are in, one of these 2 cds will fit the bill. If you only want one George Michael album, then it has to be this one. A must-have!

B000002ADT|5.0|Nearly every list of the best jazz albums ever includes this one. Why? It is the birth of true jazz ensemble playing. All the players are listening to each other like they are members of a string quartet. The affinity of the musicians for each other is truly astounding. You really have to give Bill Evans the credit. He was pioneering this approach to jazz, and Davis wanted this chamber sound (at least for a while). To my ears the best solos on the set are Adderly's...
B00005QGAV|4.0|Teddy Riley really gave Jackson a fresh start with this.  He needed to change from the QJ era, really.  It has given his career some variety, now bring on timberlake...
B00004RD54|5.0|According to certain versions , Lou Reed himself admittedly said once that he was not in good shape during this concert ( as a matter of fact I think he was referring to the whole period , circa 1973 , not just the concert ) . Certainly he was close to an all-time low in terms of psicological and physical exhaustion from the abuse of certain substances , but , ( hey Lou , call me what you want ) I disagree with his own statement .<br />One of Lou's statements I fully agree with is the one that says that rock'n'roll saved his life . Another one that admits no dispute is &quot;I don't like to disguise reality&quot; . And that's exactly what he does in this concert/album . His singing is , probably more than ever , raw , painful , desperate at times .<br />One thing you can't deny is his poetry , the way he communicates how he feels when he sees the world around him coming down hopelessly . These are not precisely lullaby songs . Lou doesn't really sing : he spits words and phrases , and the guitars sound like a machine gun at times to match his outburst.<br />This is a classic album , one that gets better and better with the years , like a good wine . One big contributing factor for the great sound here is , no doubt , the guitar tandem of Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner , who were especially inspired that night and provided Lou with a perfect , extraordinary sound environment. Wrapped by these two axemen and propelled by an equally inspired rythm section , Lou was able to shout his guts out . Bad shape ? I call it a marriage made in Heaven .<br />Show me a better version of &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and I will gladly pay you.Try to match the scorching , spine-shivering intro of Hunter and Wagner's guitars before Lou appears on stage and starts telling us about the mixed-up life of Sweet Jane and other odd characters .<br />The same goes for &quot;Heroin&quot; , with its slow start gradually becoming a vertiginous rush . Life imitates art or art imitates life ? Who cares ?<br />Then Lou goes to a rage-ladden version of &quot;How do you think it feels&quot; , with heart-ripping shouts and all , before he continues with his tales of physical and mental suffering and dark , ambiguous happiness/unhapiness in &quot;Caroline says I&quot; . After that he returns to his adventures with chemicals in an explosive rendition of &quot;White light/white heat&quot; , to me the best ever . I'm ready to take another bet here : show me a better version !<br />Then comes &quot;Lady Day&quot; which doesn't let the standards fall here , although it is probably the less remarkable song in this album .<br />But , hey , Lou couldn't finish without another memorable tour-de-force , so in the best Reed-style and fashion he delivers &quot;Rock'n'roll&quot; , and for the first time in the concert(it ain't over till it's over , right?)there's a song that is sunnier and somewhat hopeful , if you can see it .<br />Can't see it ? Well , ask the man . He said that rock'n'roll saved his life . And , this time , I believe him .es ?<BR>Then Lou goes to a rage-ladden version of &quot;How do you think it feels&quot; , with heart-ripping shouts and all , before he continues with his tales of physical and mental suffering and dark , ambiguous happiness/unhapiness in &quot;Caroline says I&quot; .

B00000253N|5.0|This is easilly my favorite Dylan album.  With some of the most mature songwriting and clever word play of his career, every track on this album is a standout.  From the opening chords of &quot;Tangled Up in Blue,&quot; the amazing lead track, this album carries the listener through worlds of meloncholy, lost love, and hope as only Dylan can.  It is a soaring and complex achievement, with beautiful instrumental arrangements.  This album also features some of Dylan's best story songs, the 8+ minute &quot;Lily, Rosemary, and the Jack of Hearts&quot; being an obvious example.  There is simply nothing bad about this album, and in the five years I've owned it it has never sounded a day older.  This is a soundtrack for life, for all of our lives, as universal and personal as anybody could want.  I can not imagine my life without this album.
B00005LC1H|4.0|The dvd looks great, sounds great, and the extras are ok, but the commentary track is literally the sound of an old man wheezing and snorting most of the time! Occasionally he points out what you are seeing on the screen, but he only speaks briefly every 2 minutes or so. The sound of his breathing, swallowing spit and shifting about in his seat are excruciating! I can only imagine the microphone is somewhere in his nasal passages. Buy this set of dvd's but avoid listening to the largely pointless commentary.
0930289455|5.0|My only complaint about this book is that it's too damn short.  Otherwise, this dark and highly disturbing (on par with Moore's OTHER Batman masterpiece Arkham Asylum) is technically amazing.  It beautifully delves into the relationship between Batman and the Joker in all its complexity and also features some of the most nefarious and disgusting acts of violence and torture that, to my knowledge, have ever been displayed in a popular comic (and that INCLUDES Preacher).  This is a very rich, psychological story featuring great art and a killer story.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKES|5.0|Perhaps one of the most startlingly creative and artistic achievement to ever be seen on television, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; is the most misunderstood series and one of the finest hour of filmmaking. <BR>Of course, I was far too young when this series was originally broadcasted, but I was introduced to the series when it was released on video. So it was nice to hear that it will soon join the DVD format.<BR>There is much to like about this series besides the fact that it was thought up by one of cinema's most brilliant and unusual director David Lynch (&quot;Mullholland Drive,&quot; Blue Velvet&quot;). And who wasn't obsessed with the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer in the strange little town of Twin Peaks?  Who didn't find the characters so interesting (I LOVED Deputy Andy!)?<BR>Although I have not seen this DVD collection, I highly recommend you at least check it out.  If you haven't seen the series, this would be a great opportunity to do so...I swear you'll  be hooked before Agent Cooper (Kyle Maclachlan) says: &quot;That's DAMN good coffee, Diane.&quot;<BR>However, I have a beef with those that had stopped watching this series after the first season.  Although the murder of Laura Palmer is solved in the end, there were those that stopped watching because (this was one opinion) hey who can stare at a donut for two mintues? Or how many times can we watch Deputy Andy start weeping at the sight of a dead body?<BR>These things are small compared to the overall depth of the filmmaking and writing. Shame on you for tuning out.
B00005MCX3|5.0|How can anyone in their right mind not like Hawkwind? This band, in many ways the British Space-Rock version of the Grateful Dead, has throughout its long and tumultous history, produced a number of crunching moronic songs embellished with spacey effects without the least bit of self-conscieness, pretention or shame.<br />The Hall of the Mountain Grill is proto-punk, proto-prog, proto-space. All the elements mix together in music that ranges from three chord jamming to five chord jamming. Standout Simon House is on this album, a wolf among stoner sheep, who lifts the band out of its wonderful sludge with his playing. Dave Brock and Nik Turner either needed everyone's help or no one's, however, and unbowed by talent or convention, they and their bandmates created in Hall of Mountain King a work of Art that so captures the time and place of its making, that to listen to it now, in the over-planned, stunted, and pre-fab &quot;outrages&quot; of our current music, is to witness what true revolution and outrage is about. Weep for us, weep for Hawkwind.<br />If only they would rerelease &quot;Warrior on the Edge of Time.&quot; Come back Lemmy! Rise from the dead Robert Calvert! Eternity beckons! Hawkind! What more need anyone say?
0780626966|5.0|A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET is one of the best horror films ever made. Even the sequels aren't all that bad. My favorite one is definitely the classic first one. The film that started it all. In this fabulous Freddy Krueger collection, you get the DVD for all seven films including: A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1984; directed by Wes Craven); A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2: FREDDY'S REVENGE (1985; directed by Jack Sholder); A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3: DREAM WARRIORS (1987; directed by Chuck Russell); A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 4: THE DREAM MASTER (1988; directed by Renny Harlin); A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 5: THE DREAM CHILD (1989; directed by Stephen Hopkins); A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 6: FREDDY'S DEAD - THE FINAL NIGHTMARE (1991; directed by Rachel Talalay); and WES CRAVEN'S NEW NIGHTMARE (1994; directed by Wes Craven). And, as a bonus, you get an 8th disc called THE NIGHTMARE SERIES ENCYCLOPEDIA which features extra bonus footage, cast interviews, and special appearances like Freddy Krueger on MTV. You also get all seven original screenplays, trivia games, and even an interactive Freddy Krueger! This is a must-have DVD collection for everyone who loves this classic horror trilogy. It's one of the best horror trilogies of all time, despite the negative reviews from critics! I strongly recommend this DVD collection if you are a fan of this horror trilogy. :-)
B00005NEZ3|5.0|i love this cd because the gorillaz are my favorite band and my parents dont get mad when they listen to it.
0064407667|5.0|I think Lemony Snicket writes alot of terrific books for 9 and up.  Her books are little sad and also a little funny.  When I read this book I had mixed feeling's.Then I realized if I didn't take the book like it was in real life it would not be so sad.So by the time I finished the book it was SO good!That made the book worth 5 stars.I am going to read the whole rest of the seire's.

B000001ESP|4.0|First I would like to say that the Song &quot;Limelight&quot; is the best Song I have heard by Rush.I think it is one of my favorite Rock songs and I listen to every kind of rock from Johnny Cash to Obituary.Rush is a new band to me(lol) I have always ment to listen to these guys but I just started picking up CD's in the past month.This record is great from start to finish.I wont go track by track because there realy is no reason...Every song is worthy of respect ,But the standouts (to me) are &quot;TOm SAwyer&quot; &quot;Limelight&quot; and this instrumental called &quot;YYz&quot; Geddy Lee and Neil Peart realy Throw down on this cd...I think Peart may be the best drummer in Rock ...Better than Most Death Metal drummers I have heard (and I have heard them all)...Buy this CD you will be very happy with it.....
B00005M08C|2.0|This effort is probably one of the biggest hyped albums of the year, mainly due to the fact that Gorillaz is a very interesting project. I mean, an animated band...it's a brilliant idea. But let's stick to the music, shall we? The album's highlight is without a doubt the smash hit single `Clint Eastwood'. And fellow singles `19-2000' and `Rock The House' are OK too, but the rest of the album is an utter letdown. It seems as if the people behind this project had a rush making this album, because most of the songs are dull, monotonous and definitely not interesting. Don't let the singles fool you. The album really isn't that good at all! Actually, the best thing about Gorillaz is their excellent animated videos. Maybe, if you're a real hip hop fan (or as I call it `Brit Hop') you might dig this debut. It's not my thing, I guess...
B00003CX5P|5.0|I bought this movie when it was only available on VHS about a year ago. I went ahead and bought it on DVD when it was released and I am so glad that I did. I noticed my VHS version lost a lot of quality over the past year. This DVD version comes out with crystal clear video as well as audio. Not only that, it comes with a second disc that has a lot of features  like the making of the movie, deleted scenes (which will probably be added to the movie in twenty years as a &quot;Special Edition&quot;), and others, which are really fun to watch. <br />I imagine the movie has been reviewed over 10,000 times so I won't even bother. All I have to say is that Star Wars Episode One is a great, entertaining movie. So, those who had this movie on VHS, buy it on DVD to re-experience the quality in audio and video.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Radiohead's latest effort `Amnesiac' is a close relative to its predecessor `Kid A'. I am really disappointed that so many so-called fans have not given these two albums a second listen, because in their opintion, it did not sound like the classic `OK Computer'. So what? The one thing that I love about Radiohead is the surprising element in their music: its continuously changing sound. Every album has its own identity, and so far... all identities have stunned me in the most positive way possible. <br />How does Amnesiac differ from `Kid A'? Quoting Q Magazine: `... where it differs vitally from `Kid A' it is being 1) better balanced, 2) more emotionally intelligible and 3) even more grimly beautiful.' That's absolutely true. Where `Kid A' was quite dark (and maybe incredibly `unemotional', according to singer Thom Yorke), `Amnesiac' is definitely more accessible. Just listen to the incredibly moving single `Pyramid Song', or the quite catchy tune `Knives Out', just to name a phew. Opener `Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box' isn't as good as Kid A's opener `Everything In Its Right Place', and this track might give you a wrong impression of what to expect from this album. Yet, it's a very nice song.<BR>The track `Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors' is heavily influenced by one of Thom Yorke current favourites artists, Aphex Twin. This track might have been a way to mock the fans. It's something Thom Yorke just had to put here, I guess. Indeed, it doesn't sound like anything Radiohead has ever done before, but somehow it seems to fit Amnesiac's picture perfectly. <BR>Haunting anthem `You And Whose Army?' and bluesy `I Might Be Wrong' are definitely highlights as well. These might even please the fans of OK Computer.<BR>That brings us to `The Morning Bell Amnesiac'; a different version from Kid A's classic `Morning Bell'. It's a very nice effort, but it's unable to overshadow the original version. The band itself seems to prefer the Kid A version also, because the Amnesiacversion has never been played live so far. I also call it the Morning Bell X-Mas version, because of its tubular bells.<BR>`Dollars And Cents' is a terrific song, but somehow the album version sounds somewhat weak in comparison to the live version. It's just my opinion though, but I think this track might have easily become the album's ultimate highlight when it was recorded in a different way. <BR>The only disappointment of this album is `Hunting Bears', a short guitar-based track. Surely an Amnesiac B-side such as `Kinetic' or `Cuttooth' could have easily replaced this track. Now I'm sorry to say that the skip-button is often used when listening to this album, which I have never did before with a Radiohead album. Sorry guys...<BR>`Like Spinning Plates' is an excellent way of showing what Radiohead's capabilities are. The vocals of this track were sung backwards when recording the album, Bizarre, you might think. Strangely enough this is a definite highlight in my opinion. I have never heard a live version of this song, so I'm looking forward to the next album `I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings', which features a rare live recording of this track. <BR>Closing track `Life In A Glass House' is an excellent jazz-song, which features jazz trumpet guru Humphrey Lyttelton. An excellent way to end a great, great album.<br />`Amnesiac' might not be Radiohead's best album to date, but it deserves a 5-star rating nonetheless because of its passionate, brilliant experimental offerings. <br />It's an album every artist should have been proud of. <BR>It's an album every Radiohead fan should be proud of.<BR>It's an album that deserves recognition and acceptation by the media.<BR>It's an album that deserves a place in history...<br />A final word to all who did not listen to Amnesiac more than once: `Suckers!'<BR>I rest my case. Thank you for reading.
B000002MUW|5.0|After all the controversy surrounding her &quot;Erotica&quot;/&quot;Sex&quot;/&quot;Body Of Evidence&quot; triple play in 1992, Madonna took a step back and quietly released &quot;Bedtime Stories,&quot; a very introspective and emotional album filled with lots of hidden treasures and only a few hits. It's usually overlooked now, but given the chance, this one really stands out.    This is a huge departure for Madonna. As an artist, she consistently pulls trends from the underground and introduces them to the mainstream. With &quot;Bedtime Stories,&quot; she did the exact opposite: she used the popular sounds of the time, for the most part, but still managed to make it sound fresh and appealing. The album kicks off with &quot;Survival,&quot; a &quot;shoulda been&quot; hit single that pretty much sums up Madonna's take on those who criticize her: &quot;I'll never be an angel. I'll never be a saint, that's true.&quot; Produced by Dallas Austin (who was fresh off of his success with TLC and &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;), it works very well. Madonna fires back at her critics explicitly with &quot;Human Nature,&quot; which has a huge bass line and sounds like a hip-hop experiment. You'll either love it or you'll hate it--and that's a classic Madonna approach to music making.    The album is also loaded with several R &amp; B inspired numbers. &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me,&quot; &quot;Inside of Me,&quot; &quot;Don't Stop,&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; share a variety of producers, and it's obvious that Babyface (who produced a handful of the tracks) had a profound influence on a great deal of the album. His presence is most obviously felt on &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; and the album closer, &quot;Take A Bow,&quot; where he provides distinct background vocals.    There are also a few tracks that come out of left field. &quot;I'd Rather Be Your Lover&quot; is another hip-hop inspired track, with guest vocalist Me'Shell N'degeocello. &quot;Don't Stop&quot; is the only thing that approaches being a dance song, but it's closer to being mid-tempo. &quot;Secret&quot; is a laid-back piece of summer fare with an unexpected acoustic backing track and some of Madonna's best harmonizing since &quot;La Isla Bonita.&quot; And the one-two punch of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and the Bjork-penned &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; puts a unique spin on the entire album. While &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; are not at all suited for radio, they somehow manage to fit on this album without making it sound disjointed.    The lyrics on &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; are quite confessional. These are, for the most part, songs about longing and loss. But they also focus on the notions that longing and loss often come from within. While Madonna must have been hurt deeply by the critical barbs lobbed at her between 1992 and 1994, she mixes her rebuttals with a sense of personal responsibility, admissions of mistakes, and reminders that she is, deep down, a vulnerable human being, like the rest of us. Taken in the context of Madonna's career progression, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is a link between the early days of courting controversy and her current approach, which is based more on personal fulfillment. &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is also the antithesis of &quot;Erotica,&quot; and it's often hard to imagine an artist who would be able to turn out two such different albums in the space of four years (and she ultimately went one better--the &quot;Evita&quot; soundtrack was her next project, and that doesn't seem like the expected next step from either album). Where &quot;Erotica&quot; intentionally sounded cold and electronic, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is as warm as a fireplace on Christmas morning.    If there were one piece of criticism one could possibly add to this album, it's the inclusion of &quot;Take A Bow&quot; at the end of the album. The song progression builds and evolves into the electronica pairing of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; and &quot;Bedtime Story,&quot; but the inclusion of &quot;Take A Bow&quot; as the final track is almost too abrupt. &quot;Take A Bow&quot; is the most lyrically accessible song on the album, and also the most contemporary sounding, but it almost strikes as an afterthought--a single that was tacked on at the end to increase album sales. Had it been placed earlier in the album, it would have fit right in. Nevertheless, this is the one small discrepancy I found in this otherwise perfect album.    Madonna has done some albums bogged down with filler (&quot;Like A Virgin,&quot; &quot;True Blue,&quot; &quot;I'm Breathless&quot;), but this one sparkles from beginning to end. An extremely enjoyable album, released when the artist needed to prove to critics that she could still make music that excited the general public, &quot;Bedtime Stories&quot; is a delightful addition to Madonna's ever-evolving career.
B000001DYD|5.0|It's difficult to put into words what a dissonant, blistering, emotional masterpiece this is, for PJ Harvey's &quot;Rid of Me&quot; is easily one of the top 10 albums of the 90s.  Few artists can combine raw, gritty post-punk and blues with rapid-fire time signature changes and atonal dynamics like this rage-filled slide-guitar artiste from Yeovil. However, Steve Albini's production &quot;values&quot; leave much to be desired, for he mixed back, distorted, and subdued much of her voice (most other reviewers will agree.) <br />So here's a suggestion, Polly Jean.  Round up the musicians who helped create this masterpiece, find a producer who will bring out and accentuate--not hide--your edgy, yet wide-ranging vocal stylistics, and re-record this album note-for-note. Hard to believe, but &quot;Rid of Me&quot; can be improved, and I would be among the first in line to purchase the new version; perhaps you could call it &quot;Rid of Albini.&quot; Just a thought, of course....
B00000BKDY|5.0|Great album, superb harmonies vocals, guitar,bass, drums and great synthesizers too.

0783223218|1.0|I bought this as one of those Blockbuster previously viewed specials for a couple bucks, thinking, how bad can it be?<br />It's bad, really, really bad.<br />There is nothing romantic about being a terrorist for hire, yet Hollywood, with Bruce Willis in the uber-terrorist role, manages to pull it off. This is a movie that will offend your senses and your intelligence. Richard Gere is wasted, and there aren't even many of the quote-unquote &quot;cool&quot; explosions for the teenage boy set.<br />This sets the standard for lame-o, offensive action &quot;thrillers.&quot;<br />Avoid. Even if you get it ultra cheap at a fire sale.
6303182577|4.0|Having been born in 1980, I missed the original Woodstock concert by 11 years (plus about another 18 as that's probably how old I would have been to go to a concert like that).  However, through my constant viewing of VH1's special, I have become a huge fan of the music of that era.  While I love listening to the music of Jefferson Airplane, Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, Jimi Hendrix and such, what I have always longed for is a chance to actually watch them perform.  While seeing them perform live is highly unlikely (seeing as how Jimi and Janis have been dead for 30 years and JA did their big reunion a decade ago), watching this documentary is about the best chance I'm going to get.  While I would have loved to have been there in person, one thing that I love about this movie is the view that you get.  From seeing Ritchie Havens' foot tapping during &quot;Freedom&quot; to watching the expressions on the faces of JA's Grace Slick and Marty Balin as they traded leads on &quot;Won't You Try/Saturday Afternoon&quot;), you definitely have the best seat in the house when you watch this movie.  I watched the entire video in one sitting, glued to the t.v. the whole time (except when I got up to dance to Santana's &quot;Soul Sacrifice&quot;).  From the interviews with the townspeople to the interviews with the hippies (my fav was the one with the stoned guy as he walked out of the Port-a-Sans) to the incredible music, I think this documentary captures the event very well.  The only complaint that I have is not having more footage of the live performances.  I would have loved to have seen Sweetwater at their best or Grace Slick belting out &quot;Somebody to Love&quot; or &quot;White Rabbit&quot;.  Maybe someday they'll release separate video versions of the individual sets played by the artists...that'd be awesome!  In the meantime, buy and watch this video...you'll have a great time!!
B000002J1S|5.0|Between the cream of the Prog rock: Genesis, Yes, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, ELP and UK, to me this album is the NUMBER ONE over masterpieces like Dark Side of The Moon, Close to the Edge and Tarkus.

0062502182|5.0|I am a 16 year old student who recently read this book for a World Civilizations class.  What I found was much more than just an insight on African and Spanish culture at the time, but a deep look into what drives us all to complete our goal in life.  I have reread the book twice, and each time a chord is struck within me.  Not only does this book provide an excellent journey, but a motovational theme that gave me an entirely different view on life.  I would recommend this book to young and old alike, for it relates to everyone's journey through life.
0553208845|5.0|Seeking the meaning, the place for one's Self or the right time in one's life is a challenging and grueling process, as shown in \\"Siddhartha\\" by Hermann Hesse, a young man named Siddhartha starts out as a Brahmin but seeks to find his own place through change, struggle, lust and finally piece. Siddhartha is a young man, he and his best friend, Govinda, set out to find a higher understanding of themselves. They join a group of Samanas, where they learn a great deal of self-discipline. After years of hardships and a simple life, Siddhartha decides to move away from the life of a Samana, but his friend Govinda wants to stay, so they part. Along his journey, he comes to a garden where a beautiful woman, named Kamala, sits in a chair. He sees the town nearby and offers to work for her if he can stay and learn from her about her ways. After many years of living with these rich, prosperous people Siddhartha grows to be one of them. He gambles and drinks wine and wears perfumes and rich clothing. He has forgotten his goal. After growing older and grayer he turns away from Kamala and finds rest with a ferryman. He offers to help him if, in return, he will be a listener and a friend. They escort people across the river all day long and Siddhartha finds a great love for the river because it always had the answers to his questions. One day his old friend, Govinda, comes along to cross the river and recognizes this old man as Siddhartha. He also realizes that, after all this time, his friend has finally found peace within himself and that gave him peace in return.<br /><br />The author, Hermann Hesse, uses the third person throughout the book and different techniques to display that someone is talking. For example if Siddhartha were talking it would look like this, Siddhartha said: \\"...\\". The author's purpose for writing this book is knowledge of the Self within each individual, and how everyone has to take a different path to find it. It is a story of a young man and it becomes very personal about Siddhartha. Conflict was used to develop the characters and to relate their issues back to the central theme. The five types of conflict are demonstrated in this book. The struggle of man against nature is used when Siddhartha is hungry and there is no food around for him to eat because the trees had no fruit on them. The conflict of man against another man is displayed when Siddhartha wants to leave the life of a Brahmin and become a Samana, but his father disapproves. There is a struggle between Siddhartha and himself and what he wants to do next in approaching his goal. Nature, like the river, gives him inspiration and answers his questions. This gives him peace because he conflicts with the lifestyle of the rich and their heedless society. These five conflicts, in themselves make up the book and the story of Siddhartha's life. Hesse creates each conflict with care so it enhances the theme of the book. These also all related back to the theme and the struggles Siddhartha experienced, all in all these matured the theme making it very deep and dynamic.omes very personal about Siddhartha.

0743420373|4.0|This is a book I would never in my life have wanted to read on my own, but I was forced to for an economics class and ended up enjoying it a great deal. <BR>Although the numerous statistics and case studies started to get a little redundant after awhile, I learned a lot about my family's spending habits and what I should do or avoid when I start my own family.  I found out that my parents are stereotypical millionaire UAW's (under-accumulators of wealth).  I've been brought up a hyperconsumer... I hope that the knowledge I gained from this book will help me to reverse my spending-before-earning habits.

B000059XUO|5.0|This film has it all: action, suspense, romance. Knowing that this film was sadly to be Brandon Lee's last makes it come across on a more personal level than it may otherwise have done. Lee is superb in every department, carrying each trait of his character wonderfully. The action and violence are given balance and justification by the genuinely thought-provoking plot. Some of the support performances seem a little wooden at times but these are forgivable as, frankly, Lee carries the film from start to finish- and what a job he does of it. Awesome.
B00005R23S|5.0|For me Bruce, the boys and a beautiful woman, are the best of the best. There is nothing like a live experience with Bruce and the E-Street band. So I am so excited to have a Bruce concert at home on DVD. To see Clarence play his solo on Jungleland, that is worth the money alone.

630197154X|2.0|My apologies to this movie's many diehard fans, but I've always had a problem with Paddy Chayefsky's work. Nobody...and I mean NOBODY...actually talks like his characters, so the plaudits he routinely receives for his 'realism' are a mystery to me. If NETWORK is a triumph at all, it's due to Sidney Lumet and his cast, who pull off the dramatic equivalent of three innings of hitless relief to preserve a win for Paddy's usual shaky, walk-plagued start. Lumet keeps the heavyhanded black-comedy elements from wrecking the picture, and he's equally skillful at finding ways to keep the genteel bathetics of Holden and Straight's marital death-throes from bringing the movie to a glacial standstill. I assume that by this point in his career, Lumet was savvy enough to have known ahead of time the kind of longwinded, 'meaningful' pontificating a Paddy Chayefsky script was sure to be larded with, and devised his narrative escape hatches and short cuts ahead of time.     To his credit, NETWORK is certainly watchable, and there are a number of satirical arrows that hit their mark - Finch's work as Howard Beale has achieved a kind of deserved immortality. But since when has television NOT proven an irresistible target for writers to attack? TV has always been the slowest, fattest, most easily-gored bull in the cultural corrada, and the idea that NETWORK is a work of prophetic genius because it foresees our Jerry Springer-dominated present is crazy, especially when you consider Newton Minow's famous definition of the boob-tube as a 'vast cultural wasteland' was already old news when he coined the term in the early 60s. At the time this was released, most of the talk generated by NETWORK had less to do with its satirical brilliance than with William Holden playing his role as a clearly visible middle-aged man, with all the facial lines and wattles intact and unadorned by cosmetic fakery; that people would find a 58-year-old man refusing to pretend he was still 35 startling and courageous was as scathing a comment on the tv culture as any of Faye Dunaway's 'television incarnate' horrorshow monologues.     Where NETWORK - and the great majority of Chayefsky's work - stumbles, and stumbles badly, is his egotistical inability to rein in his characters from speaking the author's mind all the time, and as if they were being paid by the word with a bonus for the multisyllabic ones. These people are no more authentic than the two-dimensional cut-outs populating THE HOSPITAL or THE GODDESS or THE AMERICANIZATION OF EMILY. They simply never convince me that they actually might exist somewhere: their only purpose is to open their mouths and declaim Chayefsky's meat-cleaver philosophy and prejudices, endlessly and artificially (my favorite is the beautiful, icy career woman who's successful because she's incapable of feeling love. There are plenty of others.) Please don't take my word for it - click the \\"Memorable Quotes\\" link at the IMDb listing, and plunge into the purple thicket of dialogue for yourself and see. But pack a machete; you may need to do a lot of hacking to get back to daylight.

B00000JMG7|5.0|Rory G (sadly deceased as of 95 and sorely missed) was The Flannel King of Irish Blues in a career that spanned 20-some years, from Cream-alike power trio Taste to his own solo band, hand-in-glove backed by longtime compadres Gerry McAvoy on bass, Lou Martin on keys, with drums handled first by Rod de'Ath and later by Ted McKenna. Besides being one of the last remaining virtuoso players to work his wizardry on a Telecaster (as opposed to the standard Les Paul or Strat), Rory had an uncanny knack for threading currents of heavy rock and Irish folk into his otherwise-impeccable take on Delta blues: what usually came out of the speakers was a magical, life-affirming, ringing-toned storm of notes that put enough of an individual stamp on those moss-backed blues chords and progressions to make the form seem excitingly fresh and new. Though Rory never Americanized his sound to the extent his record label would've liked, his unerring instinct for raucous riff and gorgeous melody alike seduces the listener immediately, even 30 years later. It's more than riffing and solos you respond to on a Rory record, though. What you're REALLY hearing in &quot;Cradle Rock&quot; and &quot;Moonchild&quot; is the sum total of one man's emotional, spiritual and creative being - everything he was and ever wanted to be - transmuted into music and captured for all time on wax (or digibits, or whatEVER the hell's in a CD that makes sound come out when you zap it with a laser beam.) You graybeards out there are no doubt reading this and nodding your assent right about now. BBC SESSIONS collects two cds worth of live and one-take studio performances of any number of Gallagher classics, among them &quot;Calling Card&quot;, &quot;Race the Breeze&quot;, &quot;Daughter of the Everglades&quot; and &quot;Jack Knife Beat&quot;, to name four at random. All versions are expanded from their already-impressive lp versions, oozing with feel, improvisation, invention and audacity. This sucker will leave a newcomer a goofy-grinning Rory Gallagher fan for life. You might even begin wearing buttondown flannel shirts again, now that Seattle's safely in pop culture's rear-view mirror and receding further with each passing day. Hey, would I lie to you? Go get this affordable twofer and begin saving your green stamps for the rest of his back-catalog....and light a candle in remembrance for a musician whose like we won't see again, at least in this world.
B00004XPPK|4.0|Gilda has the defining elements of film noir. The cinematographic feel,- see the first shot w/camera rising from BELOW ground to the gritty street bar scene. Great B and W .And of course the deadly female who is irresistable and foments catastrophe while she stirs the hormones ( well,doesnt beladonna mean beautiful lady/ also toxic plant). The homosexual subtext woven into film in a Hollywood where homoerotic doings (e.g. Cukor,Bankhead) were certainly more accepted, even celebrated,then we used to know as kids. The crisp, snap- brim fedora dialogue of the prowlers of  moral demi-monde of casinos( think &quot;Casablanca.&quot;)Remember when casino gambling was a top ten &quot;ooh-ah&quot; vice, before today's drug doings!) The movie writers have clever fun with the actors, who clearly enjoyed themselvers and each other. Recall, Ford played babyfaced nice guys until this one. Rita was a formulaic Colombia dancer/glamor queen of Cover Girl before. Moments to savor: Hair toss entrance by Rita. &quot; Me, 'decent'? Ford to Macready his casino boss: Your little friend (the boss's wicked cane sword) is female. Why: because it looks like one thing and then changes before your eyes.&quot; Some things are dated but funny in a way. The Buenos Aires government gumshoe is holding off arresting Macready character, a shady gambler, murderer and mob leader,so he can get Macready's ring on-get this now-&quot; antitrust violations.&quot; Wow, anti- trust violations..Gotta love it in the context of history... Anyway if you want three movies to show the grandkids what noir was,IMO try 1) Gilda, 2) Brute Force (on VHS), and 3) Maltese Falcon. For pure fun and a sly depth I think Gilda is arguably the best and most entertaining to own and keep. Aloha, Gerry
B000002J1B|5.0|I swore an oath never to review a Yes album online as this is one reviewed-out band, but as RELAYER is my favorite, I'm gonna break that oath just this once. Caveats first, however. Along with FRAGILE &amp; EDGE (the two other mandatory Yes platters), RELAYER is about all the Jon Anderson I can put up with (this is a seriously silly man here - those TOPOGRAPHIC OCEANS liner notes will live in infamy forever). It seems like even the most devoted of acolytes has his or her dividing line between the period when this was a real band with a point and the period when Yes became a corporate cash-cow, milked mercilessly by aging hippies grown comfortable with conspicuous consumption: mine is anything after RELAYER. At the time, nobody had ever brought such beauty and art to rock music - Yes were like a gorgeously-rendered pre-Raphaelite canvas come to (audio) life, and as good as the previous albums had been, RELAYER was and is the highpoint of the catalogue. So much virtual ink gets cyberspilled on seemingly every 20-minute-long schlock opera ever pressed, but none of them, to this day, approaches the power, inventiveness and sheer majesty of &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot;. Time has not dimmed this track's incandescence: it sounds as miraculous now as then. Whatever your choice of yardstick, &quot;Gates&quot; still emerges the longform progressive-rock magnum opus you judge the rest by - virtuosity, bombast, mystery and (by the time you get to &quot;Soon&quot;) ecstasy all reside here, and the now-wizened choir-elf Jon Anderson rises to the occasion with a terrific performance. Back in the old days, the side ended and you could catch your breath and let the just-completed music soak down into the subsoil a while before flipping the record over. Now, thru the miracle of digital technology, no breather! &quot;Gates&quot; ends and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; begins, another all-time headripper and Howe's best moment with Yes, though Chris Squire's bassplaying on this track likewise kills. Throughout, new guy Moraz doesn't even bother to try mimicking Wakeman, instead laying down a barrage of weird, aggressive synths, almost a science-fiction sound! Amazing, amazing album and a real leap forward for this band - we'll never know what else these guys had up their sleeve, alas, as Moraz got shown the door after this. From the moment they announced Wakeman's return - purely to cash in on the intense goodwill of the fans for the old lineup - they lost me. (And keep pushing me further away with every desperate, cynical album and tour since.) But for their early work, especially RELAYER, they'll always have my awe and respect. An all timer.
B000001GK9|4.0|I have not had an opportunity to hear the newest release of this live performance under the Karajan Gold series, but have played through the original version twice. I cannot in all honesty say this is a definitively superior account to Karajan's original studio recording done two years before the new live one. Both performances offer quite immaculate sound with rich detail and powerfully concentrated climaxes; and, notwithstanding the missed entry in the first performance, the orchestral playing is beautiful. The editors of the Penguin Record Guide declared the later live recording had achieved an interpretive breakthrough in the final movement, finding optimism and triumph, a supreme achivement. To my ears this movement still sounded pretty tragic, brooding, intense, and ultimately dying away (ersterbend, as Mahler wrote it). The last five minutes of both performances (and many others) seemed almost interminable. Given the conditions of the later recording, one has to admire the precision and concentration of the BPO's playing, as this is a very tough score to present live. The tympani in particular are played and recorded very incisively. Interpretively, I found both readings very similar, although oddly enough I thought the first movement - especially the magical moment when the bells sound - was more atmospheric in the first recording.<br />As much as I like this performance, I cannot in all honesty recommend it in preference to the earlier studio recording, which costs less than half as much and also offers excellent performances of the Kindertotenlieder and 5 Ruckert Lieder with Christa Ludwig, for a total playing time of 132 minutes. To me this release of just the symphony on 2 full-priced CDs is ungenerous, especially by comparison to John Barbirolli's great performance with the same orchestra complete on one medium-priced disc. Still, if you don't paying the premium and are curious to hear a great live performance, this will be very satisfying and memorable.
B00005B4GU|3.0|Radiohead's fifth album, Amnesiac, is somewhat of a disappointment, especially considering the past heights that the band has achieved.  Despite, for the most part, being superior to the majority of new music being produced in recent years, it pales in comparison to their previous efforts, The Bends, OK Computer, and even Kid A.<br />Recorded at the same time as the far-superior Kid A, Amnesiac follows directly in the footsteps of the previous album's (pseudo-)experimentalist ambient noise, robotic cacophony, and distorted, repetitive vocals.  Not surprisingly, both albums sound very similar at times; however, whereas Kid A's songs complement each other, forming what turns out in the end to be a coherent whole, Amnesiac comes out as more uneven, fragmented and directionless than its predecessor.  Consequently, as it lacks the continuity and fluidity of an album, it sounds more like a collection of B-sides and studio outtakes.  <br />On a positive note, Amnesiac contains a handful of truly decent material.  The album starts strong, with the minimalist drumbeats and keyboards of \\"Packt like sardines in a crushd tin box\\".  \\"Pyramid song\\" is the best song on the album, with some fine piano and vocals by Thom Yorke.  Other highlights include the more mainstream \\"I Might be Wrong\\" and \\"Knives Out\\", which, much to this reviewer's surprise (!), feature guitars quite prominently in the mix.  <br />The rest of the album, however, is mired in mediocrity, and is less consistent.  \\"Pulk/pull revolving doors\\", with its stop/start rhythm and mangled vocals, is reminiscent of Kid A's title track; however, the experiment was more original and successful the first time around.  \\"You and whose army\\", \\"Dollars &amp; cents\\", and \\"Life in a glass house\\", while they are beautifully arranged songs, are crippled by some of Yorke's most whiny, annoying vocal efforts to date.  <br />The remaining songs are throwaways.  The alternate version of \\"Morning bell\\" is far weaker than the one that appears on Kid A, and should not have been included in this collection.  \\"Like spinning plates\\" is merely an experiment in studio effects, and is more of a curiosity than an album track.  \\"Hunting bears\\", however, is perhaps the most frustrating song on the entire album.  It is a two-minute guitar/bass buildup to nothing that might have been developed into an epic, but is instead utterly disposable.<br />With Amnesiac, Radiohead has quite obviously made an album out of the leftovers from the Kid A sessions.  There are still some good songs (after all, a bad Radiohead album is still a Radiohead album!), but on the whole this is less an album than a collection of cutting-room floor artifacts.  Perhaps it would have been more appropriate if it had been called Kid B.
B00000K2SC|5.0|this is the best of the movies that I have evere seen. If youn don't buy then you have to rent it. Though there may be some bad sences for the kids this is a great movie for the older ones that love the action films.
0679720200|4.0|When you finish this short classic you ask, &quot;What was it about?&quot;  The fact that you ask is one of the reasons it's a classic.  Another reason is that, like all classics, it's about the human experience.  A 50+ year old book tackles themes still relevant today.<br />A  young French Algerian man, Meursault, kills an Arab for little reason and is tried for murder.  The book is an examination of a dispassionate killer that doesn't seem to care for anything, even whether he lives or dies.  Is Meursault is a typical sociopath or just an indifferent slob getting by?  I was taken by how his lack of passion was read by every character in the book differently.  He seems cold to the funeral director when his mother dies.  But his new girlfriend is attracted by the same lack of passion.  His boss sees him as a good employee though odd.  Ultimately the court sees him as a mad killer.  They all see what they want to see.<br />The lack of any human feeling was ultimately the demise of Meursault.  He could have done all of the same things, but if he had only shown some emotion, he would have survived.  I find this very true in life.  Our emotions are read for the good and bad.  We are expected to be dispassionate when we're professional and passionate when we're in love.  The deviation from those expectations many times leads us to trouble even when our actual actions are appropriate.  Meursault's actions are questionable, but it is easy to see that with a little charm and personality, he could have easily talked himself out of all of his troubles.<br />Of the 20th century classics, it is certainly one of the shortest, and it has plenty to say.  I liked it enough that I will attempt another Camus in the future.
0553274503|5.0|I read this novel after performing in the one-act play based on the short story. I must say I found this to be a fascinating and enthralling novel. I was especially amused at how Daniel Keyes wrote the from Charlie's perspective by starting off with incredibly bad spelling and slowly progressing in sophistication. I think part of the novel's power is its tragic ending in which we learn we are what we are and there are some things we just can't change--we just learn to live with them. <BR>   I like the books that make you alter the way you look at society and the individual. Notice how before the operation Charlie was so good-natured but as a certified genius he becomes bitter, resentful and frustrated (yes, we geniuses have such a hard life). I could go on and on about this novel but it would be so much more meaningful (and a heck of a lot less boring) to read it yourself. So hop to it!
B00005NGZX|5.0|Well, the wait for this record has been a long one, and I must say, it has been worth the wait. For those of you who absolutely loved the last Converge album, &quot;When Forever Comes Crashing&quot;, will no doubt lap up the insanity served here. This is the old Converge, this is the new Converge, this is just good. But where to start? First off, Jacob Bannon's vocals have reached an unheard of level, scathing the listeners ears with a palpable viscosity that will shred your eardrums. It is absolutely inhuman. No man should be able to sound like this and still need to breathe air. Smoke, more likely. The new drummer follows suit just fine, laying down the appropriate blast beats and complex fills whenever called upon. Kurt Ballou's sound will eradicate your speakers, and any other superlatives I may be able to think of will do no justice. The songs are each separate, pulsing entities. &quot;Concubine&quot; instantly drags you into a whirlwind of noise, while your mind will conjure graphic images you thought you would never ideate. Trust me, this record will leave you feeling dirty; hence the title of it: &quot;Jane Doe&quot;. If you thought that &quot;When Forever...&quot; had a more industrial sound to it, then &quot;Jane Doe&quot; has a power electronics sound to it. In just about every song, certain undiscernable noises throb in the background, slowing building up into an eviscerating incision. If you never liked Merzbow, you will after this cd. Whatever you do, don't let this record slip from your grasp. Ignore the reviews that say they have gone death metal. They haven't. If these songs ever get out to the public, every philistine will be questioning the value of their lives (and if not their life, then certainly their music collection).
6303029027|5.0|I found A Bronx Tale to be one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Perhaps, I am stretching it a bit, but it seemed to me to use life growing up in the Bronx in the 60's to portray the gradual coming to adult conclusions about life around you.<BR>     The young C is drawn into the world of a mobster.  But, the mobster is something of a community protector.  On the one hand, he is seeking power, but on the other hand he doesn't let things get out of hand in his community.  The young C grows up at first as a young boy whose life is centered around Mantle, Maris, and the Yankees.  His community changes, and by the end of the movie he is in high school and the problems move from Mazeroski hitting the home run to beat the beloved Yankees, to the influx of blacks into the area.<BR>     It seemed to me that in some ways the movie was almost a parable portraying the two pulls in American foreign policy.  C's dad constantly tells his son to go home, to not get involved into affairs that is none of his business.  C's dad strikes me as displaying the idea that the world outside of our own family is dangerous and is not to be entered.  On the other hand C's moster mentor is a worldly wise man who has learned to build an empire.  In a poignant point in the film, the mobster acknowledges to C that he had once spent time in prison, when he was there, he read &quot;The Prince&quot; by Machiavelli.  There is the parable, a father constantly seeking to keep his son from being influenced and hurt by the foreign world around him, whether it be mobsters, bad kids, or negroes as compared to a godfather who rules the community, with some deep flaws but also in some ways a force for good.  In the end C becomes a blend of both men.  He is learning to have relationships with the foreign as well as the domestic in his Bronx world.  The world is never so simple as his father wanted it to be for his son, but also he knows he cannot live like the mentor that he respected, for almost no one loved this man, he was feared and not loved.  C at the end of the movie is a young man with a lot of promise but a very undetermined future.  He has learned from a mobster the way of Machiavelli and he has learned from his father the way of isolation.  He will never be comfortable with either.  Perhaps, I am stretching the message of this movie, but I think the future of America's place in the world is being decided as our nation grows up in a world where we can try to rule it by might or try to go our own separate way and mind our own business.  C's way of resolving how each of the men that meant the most to him growing up is not made absolutely clear.  It is only clear that C will not allow himself to be cut off from his world in its fulness, but the way of Machiavelli and seeking to be the community's superpower has its shortcomings as well.<BR>     Perhaps, I stretched the meaning of the movie, but for depth of character and personality in the men who influenced C this movie should be seen.  It can be appreciated apart from my political theories, so don't be afraid to see it.  There is some violence and language that some won't like to see, but it is one of the best movies about life's complexities one can ever see.
B00003CXMG|4.0|I do not have much to say about this film, except to say that it is brilliant.<br /> Based on a true story, this film is one of the future classics of the American film industry. Directed by Cameron Crowe (the story is based on real events that have happened to him), it gives one of the most realistic portrayals of what it is like to be the extra guy in the band. Even if you don't play for them. It gives a very accurate depiction of the lives of groupies, musicians, and reporters of the 70's rock scene. If you love bands like Allman Brothers, Led Zepellin, Peter Frampton, and Lynyrd Skynyrd, this movie is for you.<br /> Go on get it. Get it now. You will not be dissapointed.
0880389052|5.0|Spanning all the way back to Drizzt's birth, this is by far the best book in Dark Elf series.  Like most I read the Icewind Dale trilogy prior to reading Homeland, and was blown away by the intensity of this book.  Salvatore goes into amazing detail about Drizzt's upbringing and the horrific world where he was raised.  Above all I couldn't get enough of the emotional bonds and relationships Salvatore creates between Drizzt and his family members.  This is by far one of the BEST fantasy novels ever written.  Pick it up!
0553212737|5.0|I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging.  The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human.  You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her.  The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse.  She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker.  She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success.  Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously.  Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet.  Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal.  Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him.  Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead.  She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.  <br />Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back.  She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down.  Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come.  Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family.  Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed.  Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her.  Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate.  Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him.  Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it.  Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley.  Then another problem arises.  I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved.  But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I purchased this CD on the hope that Ms Arie would be able to match the hype being promoted and to call on two strengths to deliver,those being her musical pedigree and the fact that it was coming out of the tradition rich Motown stable.I was not disappointed.This in my opinion, is one of the best soul R&amp;B CDs of the year,and possibly the last 5 years.It reminded me of those truely great soulful projects of the past that established the dream factory that was Motown of the 60s.<br />Ms Arie continues the excellent, evolving,and yet contemporary genre,that probably commenced with Tracey Chapman and is manifesting itself through artists like Jill Scott and Alicia Keys.The songs are soulful intelligent and tinged with that acoustic sound.The arrangements are excellent and she has returned to producing a sound that relies on real musicians and not supplemented grooves and beats using technological advances.<br />Ms Arie's talent is showcased in her songwriting,playing ,singing and producing on this effort.The*feeling* in each song that celebrates her womanhood with a deep respect for her predecessors and musical heritage,without sounding trite or cliched is a pleasing departure from the over produced pop and soul divas that flood the airwaves.<br />Each sound blends beautifully with her over all desire to celebrate life and love.The commerically accessible *Video* compliments the love and anthem like *Strength Courage &amp; Wisdom*,I defy you not to *groove * to these songs.I personally love the congratulatory and loving *Brown Skin*,which stands with any great R&amp;B and soul of recent times.Some songs on here just highlight the true talent that is emerging from someone so young,such as* Ready For Love* and *Simple* and the overall project does not have a weak song.Some thoughtful and tasteful editing and production of talent went on here.Compare this to the talented but horribly sloppy effort by Ryan Adams on *Gold*.Young talented artists need to know limitations.<br />I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants not only a R&amp;B CD ,but a CD that will figure in their playlist for years to come and one that will mark the start of a hopefully growing catalogue for Ms Arie.<br />The money is well spent,and reflects ,for me,a rewarding and contemporary embodiment of the Motown tradition.I could not but think that within the voice lies the echoes of a Roberta Flack and Janis Ian...add this one to your collection.5 stars definately.would recommend this CD to anyone who wants not only a R&amp;B CD ,but a CD that will figure in their playlist for years to come and one that will mark the start of a hopefully growing catalogue for Ms Arie.<BR>The money is well spent,and reflects ,for me,a rewarding and contemporary embodiment of the Motown tradition.I could not but think that within the voice lies the echoes of a Roberta Flack and Janis Ian...add this one to your collection.5 stars definately.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Amnesiac is another great masterpiece by one of the best bands in the history of rock music. After the surprising Kid A, this new CD has the same touch, only it's not that strange and complicated. But this doesn't mean it's worse. All songs are well built, well done, with great lyrics and vocals from Thom Yorke. The album has strange songs too, but also more songs done in a classic way, with guitars and drums, and with not too many computer-generated sounds, like in Kid A. <BR>The outstanding tracks are KNIVES OUT, I MIGHT BE WRONG, YOU AND WHOSE ARMY, PYRAMID SONG. <BR>One more thing: just like Kid A, it's advisable to listen to this album with your headphones on. This way you won't miss any of the great sound effects that can be found on each and every song.

B00005A1VH|5.0|Alvin C. York is a rough and tough, sharp-shooting farmer living in Tennessee's Valley of the Three Forks, who gets &quot;religion&quot; in his own way.  He hates no one and, when drafted for service in WWI, registers as a conscientious objector..........The role was Cooper's personal favourite, not just because it won him an AA, but rather because &quot;I was portraying a good, sound American character&quot;.   The film has all the flavour of true Americana, the blunt and homely humour of backwoodsmen the raw integrity peculiar to simple folk.  Coop's performance is one of extraordinary versatility and conviction.  Whether he is being the gangling hell-raiser of the opening sequences, the hard-working fanatic of the middle portion or the shrewd fighter of the Argonne section, he is always utterly right in the part.  It's a completely persuasive characterization; Cooper dominates the film with his quiet sincerity, which is enhanced by his moments of blazing action.  Cooper ALSO won the New York Film Critics award for this performance and William Holmes won an Oscar for his superb editing; in addition, there were an incredible NINE additional nominations!!  Margaret Wycherly is excellent as York's simple, devout mother (she received an best-supporting actress nomination).  SERGEANT YORK was 1941's top - grossing film and Cooper was the year's top money-making actor (he had also done MEET JOHN DOE and THE WESTERNER during 1941).
B000002NIW|5.0|&quot;Be Quiet and Drive&quot; is one of the best songs that i have ever heard....The rest of this cd is awesome, particularly &quot;mx&quot; and &quot;my own summer&quot;, but &quot;Be Quiet and Drive&quot; is everything that a song should be
B000056N8X|1.0|i am not so much of a fan of the hihlander series, but the firts movie i realy enjoyed...and this one its so bad i had to see it in two separate times, the &quot;bad guy&quot; its awfull and it looks like its from the tv show...in fact the WHOLE MOVIE ITS LIKE A TWO HOUR SHOW!!! it has no ending and poor actors including cristofer lambert who is just to old to be and inmortal.<br />theres only one true and good hilander movie and it was made in 86.
B000002UAX|5.0|In the many opinions of the White Album I've heard, the most comon critisism is that it marks a stylized departure from their previous works.(Sgt. Pepper, MMT, etc.) In the overview of the White Album, I feel that it marks the Beatles' desire to reclaim their control over the direction of their own art. After their previous three efforts, they quite simply could have continued to drive their studio excess, however, it was important for them to shy away from making an etire album of Revolution 9 and Wild Honey Pie. In fact, the dismissal of this as a &quot;straight rock album&quot; fails to underscore the messages behind the songs themselves. (Listen to Piggies, read the lyrics and tell me that it isn't about classist repression) Another thing to remember is that this is NOT a regression to Rubber Soul, because, although the actual musical quality of Rubber Soul might be slightly better, I think that the complexity of the lyrics and themes far surpasess Ruber Soul's limited themes of sort of boy meets girl (I hate to say that about Rubber Soul, because there are deeper points such as My Life and Think For Yourself, but in comparison, it is pedestrian) and keeps the anger and complexity of MMT (such as I Am the Walrus and Blue Jay Way) and focuses its attention on the message more than innovation. One of the Beatles' best(Though no Revolver or MMT).
B00003CXA4|5.0|A must-see for everyone. Richard Attenborough has captured the fierce determination of Gandhi in showing the world a new way of non-violence. At a personal level, it is a story of austerity, self sacrifice and tremendous courage against daunting odds.<br />I wish however that the film had covered Gandhi's early struggles in England and South Africa in greater detail. I truly believe that Sir Richard Attenborough can make another movie covering only those early years of Gandhi and it would turn out to be just as remarkable.
B0000027RL|5.0|This is by far one of the best CDs I own!  Every song is wonderful, especially Jeremy.  You should buy it, I promise you'll like it, if you like good rock music!
0782008372|5.0|Finally, after years of waiting, I finally own the epic fantasy adventure HIGHLANDER: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT on DVD. I'm a fan of the HIGHLANDER films and series, and I consider Sean Connery to be one of the greatest actors of our time! The film looks incredible on DVD. If there is any problem with the DVD, it would have to be the sound. 95% of the sound is incredible, but there are scenes that you have to listen very carefully to hear them speak. Thank God for Subtitles. Other than this, the DVD is AWESOME! The storyline, characterization, visual effects, and acting are incredible. This film, which is followed by HIGHLANDER 2: THE QUICKENING; HIGHLANDER: THE FINAL DIMENSION; and HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME, is a worthy beginning to one of the greatest cult phenomenons of all time! If you love films that are full of excitement, romance, and masterful storytelling, then BUY this film! You'll never regret it! Grade: A+

B00003CXCQ|5.0|I have had a DVD player on my computer for a year and a half and it wasn't until I recieved this DVD as a gift that I ever bothered to use it. One word, WOW!!! This thing is amazing; a MUST HAVE for any Disney fan. I would say it is worth double or triple the price for the unseen footage, background information, outtakes, Disney through the decades, interviews etc. without the movie even being on the discs. I did have a small problem with the simplicity of Dopey's Mine game until I remembered that it was in all likelyhood designed for kids, not adults. And Barbara Striesand was never meant to sing &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come&quot; as hers is not the voice of a sweet innocent young girl, but other than that I have no complaints at all. This is a real treat. I can't wait to see what added features come on the Platinum Edition Beauty and the Beast DVD next fall.
B0000021RG|5.0|Critics hate it and so does the band. But by and large this proves that not only was Chicago a force to be reckoned with in the studio, but a force on stage as well.       At the time, Chicago was one of the biggest bands in the world, the first group to sell out a five-night stand at the illustrious Carnegie Hall.  And the band proves it, playing the hits and the best tracks from their first three albums, as well as one unreleased track, &quot;A Song For Richard And His Friends&quot; like there is no tomorrow.    Many of the tracks, I feel, surpass the album versions.  The band's sound is tight, yet loose at the same time.  Songs such as &quot;In The Country&quot;, &quot;Ballet For A Girl In Buchanon&quot;, and &quot;Introduction&quot; express an energy and dynamics that are not found on the original albums, and &quot;Beginnings&quot; has a groove so different than the studio version that it's indispensable as far as I'm concerned.      And being a guitar player myself, whose first inspiration to pick up the guitar was Terry Kath, &quot;South California Purples&quot; and &quot;Sing A Mean Tune Kid&quot; are proof that Kath was one of the best guitar players that ever walked the face of the Earth.  Kath was one of the few players that could solo forever and never repeat himself.     The low points are few, but annoying. The long passage of the band tuning up at the beginning of the album could have been cut all together, and the versions of &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; and &quot;I Don't Want Your Money&quot; and &quot;Happy 'Cause I'm Going Home&quot; are not the bands best, but are still awesome because of Terry Kath's playing.       But all in all the album is a tour-de-force showing that the studio is not the only place where Chicago could do magic.      If you can find the the album on it's original vinyl release, I highly recommend it. It contains one small (but still good sized) poster of the band, a HUGE, and I mean HUGE poster of a montage of the band performing, a poster book, a poster of Carnegie Hall, and voter registration information.  Included on the backside of the poster book is the dates and places of every Chicago gig from May 22 1967 to November 27 1971.  The vinyl set is an valuable addition to owning the performances on CD of 5 magical nights in April 1971.

B00005LC6Z|2.0|&quot;Halloween II&quot; picks up at the night that &quot;Halloween&quot; left off. Laurie Strode (role reprised by Jamie Lee Curtis) is admitted to the hospital, terrified that Michael isn't dead and coming after her. Michael indeed comes after her, leaving behind a more higher body count and is considerably more gory than its predessor.<br />&quot;Halloween II&quot; fails to deliver on the terrific amount of shock that &quot;Halloween&quot; does and despite the script written by Carpenter, well, this fails to live up mostly to its expectations, which the fake shocks and premarital sex must have been derived from the insipid &quot;Friday the 13th.&quot;<br />Still, I give the movie credit because it kind of wraps it up, until &quot;Halloween H20&quot; opens the myth up 20 years after, because it has SOME genuine shocks and just because Jamie Lee Curtis is in it. But the latter, weaker sequels, including the  terribly misnamed &quot;Halloween 3: The Night of the Witch,&quot; don't do the three good &quot;Halloween&quot; movies justice.<br />Rated R for violence, language, and for nudity.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Metal bands with turntable DJs are no strangers to music these days with the popularity of groups like Limp Bizkit, Korn, and even the hard-core-turned-pop Sugar Ray. Where the line of creativity and musical exploration ends with these bands is exactly where California rockers Incubus pick up.<BR>The unknown quintet sparked little interest in popular music until their 2000 release, Make Yourself hit radio airwaves with singles, \\"Pardon Me\\" and \\"Drive.\\"  Their hard and edgy rock sound combined with the scratch mastering of DJ Kilmore struck an early interest in listeners and propelled them near the top of the charts.  However, it wasn't until their sound lightened and became more acoustic that they truly began to captivate listeners.  After all, how can this, one of the forefront rock bands put down the wailing guitars for sweet melodies?<BR>With intelligence, exploration and an extreme love for the art of music, Incubus takes a genre overkilled by mainstream music and proves that its not always the loudest band that wins listeners. Riding on their acoustic popularity, Incubus returned to the studio earlier this year to record Morning View, an intense exploration into how deep music can really flow among five people.  The album's name comes from the recording studio/home the band purchased to make the album. A fine mix of the band's genuine hard rock beginnings, and some of the softer side of their musical styling, Morning View may just be their best album to date.<BR>The radio single, \\"Wish You Were Here\\" says little about the musical innovation and experience the band offers to listeners, despite its Pink Floyd-esque title. Billed as a rock love-anthem, it features the whine-wailing voice of singer Brandon Boyd with the backing of one of the most exploratory instrumentalist groups in music today.  The closing track, \\"Aqueous Transmission\\" says it all for the group's ability to combine unconventionality with originality and hand over a product far above expectations.  Featuring a Japanese Kyoto-guitar and pan flute paired with a heavy thumping bass line, the track is so soothing and beautiful its hard to imagine it occurs after the hard crunch of \\"Under my Umbrella.\\"  Returning to similar roots, tracks such as \\"Mexico\\" and \\"Echo\\" are trademark Incubus sound. Listening to the acoustic and melodic drifting of the slower tracks reminds of \\"Stellar\\" and \\"Drive\\" from the previous release, Make Yourself.<BR>Even the harder tracks such as \\"Circles\\" offer a chorus that feels less heavy and more floating despite the crunchy wail of guitarist Mike Einziger's six-string assault.  Boyd sings \\"Hey what would it mean to you/to know it'll come back around again/Whatever it means to you/know that everything moves in circles.\\" For Incubus, this may not be far from the truth. By moving farther away from what mainstream media may expect they create a world of their own where it is difficult to respect their immense talent. After all, how can a love song make you want to stand up and jump up and down while pumping fists in the air? Boyd has commented in numerous music magazines that neo-rap-rock is uncreative and smothers true music. While not everyone can agree, it is certainly evident in a band that can create art on stage, unplug and then recreate the same beautiful harmony with acoustic sound. For every ounce of crunch, bang and wail, the band brings a spoonful of amazement unique and uncommon to many groups in music today.<br />The Bottom Line:  Morning View is classic Incubus, and a perfect entry-point for new fans. Whether hard rock or light balladeering is your passion, Incubus leaves the gate with a higher respect for the art of music creation and a newfound sense of what true musicianship should be.

6304698658|3.0|I think this movie is very funny and stands out as one of the funniest Christmas movies of all time.  I am however very disappointed in the dvd version of this movie.  Fortunately,I only paid seven dollars for the movie or I would be very upset.  The movie seems as if they took a regular vhs copy of the flick and scanned it and burned some copies.  I only had to watch about five minutes of the movie to see that Warner Brothers did nohing to restore this movie to a near perfect condition which dvd users are used to.  Im very disappointd and expected so much more from this movie.

B00000BKI4|5.0|The Beach Boys' &quot;Pet Sounds.&quot;  The Soft Boys' &quot;Underwater Moonlight&quot;.  R.E.M.'s &quot;Reckoning&quot;.  Mercury Rev's &quot;Deserter's Songs.&quot;  What do all these albums have in common?  They are considered, at least in my mind, the top albums of all time.  &quot;Deserter's Songs&quot; is on this list because it just happens to be a masterful, beautiful collage of dream pop, space rock, americana, and alternative rock.  It took me nearly a year and a half to realize how incredible this album really is.  I remember I bought it on a limb because I heard they were on R.E.M.'s 1999 Fall tour.  Being an avid fan of R.E.M., I picked it up and popped it into my CD player.  Well, I guess my reaction at the time was probably that of respect, thinking this band was a truly unique one who had churned out a truly unique album.  I listened to it for a couple weeks, than casually placed it back into my CD case.  Through time, I would occasionally listen to it, becoming a bit more enamored with it every time.  Then, around the end of the summer of 2001, nearly two years after I had purchased the C.D., it hit me.  This album is groundbreaking and definitely one of my all time top five albums.  The brand new albums I bought during this time were ironically being shelved in place of &quot;Deserter's Songs.&quot; Why?  To put it simply, it's an album I just can't get enough of.  From the chilling opener, &quot;Holes&quot;, to the experimental sketches that close &quot;Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp,&quot; the album holds on and never lets go.<br />The orchestral, eerie opener &quot;Holes&quot; couples Donahue's creepy yet beautiful voice with bowed saws, majestic violins, and the gorgeous flutework of Suzanne Thorpe.  A track that sweeps the listener to and fro.  Delicate drums, calm acoustic guitar work...it's a sensational opener. <br />&quot;Tonite it Shows&quot; is a fairy-tale-esque song backed by once again dreamlike violins and flutes, along with Donahue's stunning lyrics.  Lines like &quot;The way you were/long before/you were a walking civil war&quot; act like a chilling opposition to the dreamy instrumentation in the song.<br />&quot;Endlessly&quot; follows with gentle guitar picking, beautiful falsetto choir vocals, and that damn lovely bowed saw.  Incorporating &quot;Silent Night&quot; into it just makes it even better.<br />&quot;I Collect Coins&quot; conjures up an early 1900's nostalgia, with its waltzy piano and vinyl scratches.<br />&quot;Opus 40.&quot;  God, what can be said about &quot;Opus 40.&quot;  Yes it's a single, but it's just to smart to be one.  Yes, the slight drumming and majestic orchestrations are heart-wrenching, but Donahue's lyrics are just plain remarkable.  &quot;Catskill mansions buried screams/I'm alive she cried but I don't know what it means/somewhere out there across the moonlit sands/There's a line drawn like the lines on her own hand&quot; could quite possible one of my favorite lyrics of all the music I have ever listen to.<br />The Grasshopper-penned &quot;Hudson Line&quot; is a fun romp that infuses crunching guitar and jazzy mellotron.  It also shows that just because Grasshopper is usually confined to his role as a multi-instrumentalist, he can still create some intriguing lyrics like &quot;technicolor raindrops wash gumballs down the drain.&quot;<br />The second instrumental, &quot;The Happy End (The Drunk Room)&quot; acts as a continuation to &quot;I Collect Coins&quot;, once again evoking images of 1900's civilization dancing around a spacious ballroom.<br />&quot;Goddess On A Hiway&quot; is another clever single.  Again, lyrically Donahue has hit the mark as he does throughout the album.  The simple distinction between &quot;Got Us on a Hiway&quot; and &quot;Goddess on a Hiway&quot; is interesting and provokes some well-deserved beard-stroking.  &quot;Goddess&quot; could possibly considered the most straightforward song on the album, even if it is an intelligent single.<br/>&quot;Funny Bird&quot; is wonderful space rock song, starting off slowly with thumping drums and gentle bass.  As the song progreses, it builds and builds until if finally explodes into a world of whacked-out guitar and furious bass.  A truly excellent track.<br />&quot;Pick Up if You're There&quot; acts as the closer to the instrumental's story, circa 1900's.  If prepares the listener for bombastic closer.<br />&quot;Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp&quot; is perhaps the most radical song on the album, fusing the characteristics of dance with a traditional jazz and rock.  Slide gutar, thumping bass, pulsing rythms... it's all there.  As the song comes to a tumultous end, the interesting experimental leanings of the group come into place and fiddle around with the listener's ears before coming to abrupt stop.<br />Well, there you have at, a song-by-song analysis of this masterful piece of music.  &quot;Deserter's Song&quot; is not only a great instrumentally, but also lyrically.  Donahue's warped lyrics are some of the most uniqe and thought-provoking lyrics I have ever heard.  Plus, Dave Fridmann's bass is outstanding throughout the album, particularly on &quot;Funny Bird&quot; and &quot;Delta Sun Bottleneck Stomp.&quot;  It took me nearly two years to discover the potential of &quot;Deserter's Songs&quot;, and let's just say I'm glad that these guys are around to make music once again so pertinent to not only the music industry, but to the world.
B00005KHL0|5.0|What John Carpenter's &quot;Halloween&quot; is a genuine, low-budget shocker that delivers up to all accounts possible on a horror film, which more than likely boosted Jamie Lee Curtis's career through the roof and inspired many weak sequels after it.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; has an original plot, kudos to that. When a crazed adult brother escapes from a mental institution, he goes to Haddonfield, Illinois to kill his sister (Jamie Lee Curtis), killing everyone in his way, which leads to a superb climax and chilling ending.<br />&quot;Halloween&quot; has everything going for it. Great cast, great plot, and great acting. What also helps is the chilling piano soundtrack, composed by Carpenter himself.<br />See this movie, either on Cinemax or on VHS/DVD. It's guaranteed to scare you silly.<br />Rated R for violence, nudity, and for brief language.
068484267X|5.0|I am 13. I loved this book the moment i read it. I have watched the video and i was so moved by it that i tried the book. i couldn't put it down. his story would not be as good as it is without Frank's skill as a writer. i have never read tis though i know i will. at the moment i am desperate to find out if he ever saw his father again, how Alphie, Malachy, Michael and Angela are and if they ever joined Frank in America. I also want to know if he is married as i am desperate to know if he has complete hapiness now.<br />my advice to you is -<br />READ IT WHAT EVER YOU AGE YOU ARE!!!!!!<br />AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT THEN SEE IT AS AN EXPERIANCE,<br />BUT IT'S WORTH THE MONEY!!!!!!!!!!! HONEST!!!!!!!!!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I know, just because I love it doesn't mean that everyone does. But I do love it. I know it's not as hard as some would like it to be, but it's very creative. I've not seen a band get this creative and different in my whole, tiny, non-important 15 years. The fact that I like them, and that my mother likes some of the songs on it, just makes me want to listen to them more. As good as this CD is, it'll probably be even greater live.
B000005RU0|5.0|Blind Guardian is no doubt the greatest metal band since Iron Maiden, and they prove it with another solid album.  IFTOS is perhaps the best Blind Guardian album, with such classics as the metal epic &quot;And the Story Ends&quot;,the King Arthur inspired &quot;Past and Future Secret&quot; and the powerful title track.  This is the last real &quot;heavy&quot; Blind Guardian album since &quot;Nightfall In Middle Earth&quot; is a more dynamic album, so they have combined all their skills and expeirence to make a perfect album.  If you like metal buy it.
6302256704|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time and I loved it. Everything about this movie was funny. I thought the boxer who went down in 2 seconds without actually getting hit was good. I thought the scene with the olive being popped in Golino's mouth straight from her belly button was staggering and the &quot;sizzling belly&quot; with bacon and eggs frying on it was funny and sexy. I also loved the part with that old Indian guy who I guess was playing like he knew hi-tech stuff when he was listening to &quot;U Can't Touch This&quot; by M.C. Hammer. &quot;Washout&quot; was funny too with his wall-eye vision. It was a great movie overall.
B0000025F7|5.0|Well, this and Thriller are both must haves.  I am only 13 years old so I'm sure that I will never fully understand the impact that Michael Jackson had on music.  I do know that I really like this album though.  His more recent doesn't even come close to equalling this or Thriller.  My favorite song on here is &quot;Don't Stop 'Till You Get Enough&quot;.  His voice is so high on it that I didn't even know it was him singing it the first time I heard it.  &quot;Rock With You&quot; and the title track are my other two personal favorites.  If you want the funky version of Michael Jackson, and not the manufactured version we've had for the past 10 or 15 years, you absolutely have to buy this album.  In recent years, Michael Jackson has been called &quot;The King of Pop&quot;.  This was made when he was &quot;The King of Funk/Soul/R&amp;B/Disco.
6304078102|2.0|First, the good thing about this movie:  I think that it has called to people's attention the great dedication that many music teachers have for their work.   It also may have raised people's consciousnesses about the lack of funding and support for public school music programs.  There are some funny and touching moments in this issue.  <br />And then the bad:  It's Hollywood, and it's cheesy.  All of us who have struggled with a musical instrument know that you don't really get THAT MUCH better by &quot;playing the sunset.&quot;  The good-bye concert for Mr. Holland is also cheesy, as is the idea of a lovely young high school student falling in love with old Richard Dreyfuss.
B00005O3VC|5.0|More than enough good things have been said about this wonderful movie. I'd just like to comment on its unbearably sharp wit again. The &quot;Constitutional peasants&quot; scene near the beginning is a killer, here are the first few lines of it.<br />Arthur: Old Woman!<BR>Peasant: Man!<BR>Arthur: Sorry. Man. What knight lives in that castle over there?<BR>Peasant: I'm 37.<BR>Arthur: What?<BR>Peasant: I'm 37. I'm not old.<BR>Arthur: Well, I can't just call you &quot;man&quot;.<BR>Peasant: You could say &quot;Dennis&quot;.<br />Arthur: I didn't know you were called Dennis.<BR>Peasant: Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?<BR>Arthur: I did say &quot;sorry&quot; about the &quot;old woman&quot;, but from behind, you looked...<BR>Peasant: What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior.<BR>Arthur: Well, I am king.<BR>Peasant: Oh, king! Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. If there is ever going to be progress...<br />And so on. My god, the Pythons were brilliant.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Fantastic.  The album surprised me because I expected it to be a bit heavier, but I was not at all disappointed in what these guys put together for us.  &quot;11 A.M.&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot; and &quot;Mexico&quot; are my current favorites...  great, insightful lyrics and nice musical layers.  In other words... Typical Incubus!  I highly recommend this one!!!
B00003CXP1|5.0|This is an excellent film in many ways.  It is unique, thought-provoking and deals with unflinching honesty about one of the most important yet sloppily analysed facets of our modern liberal society, drug addiction, whether legal or illegal. <br />There are many reasons why this is an important film:<br />Firstly the subject matter - drug addiction and it's effect on all our lives - is intelligently and thoughtfully explored.  Not something one encounters often in films noawadays.<br />Secondly the production and direction are masterful.  The Director uses many innovative techniques to create emotions often outside of the cinematographic repertoire.  The final half of the film feels as if you are in a mad dizzying rush forward as the film drives onwards to it's harrowing, emotional climax.  It may not be the most subtle approach but it succeeds beyond doubt. <br />Thirdly, the film is not hindered by nostalgia, it is brutally honest in how it thinks the protagonists would behave in real life and attains a strong degree of realism.  The result of this is that the film is often harrowing and disturbing but never greatuitously.  The viewer is not manipulated and treated in a condescending way as in so many films - this feels real.<br />Fourthly, the performances are first-rate - Ellen Burstyn in particular puts in a great turn as the doting mother with an inadverent addiction to slimming pills. <br />Darren Aronofsky, the Director, shows a uniquely compelling approach with serious subject matter.  This is a film to watch and consider; it will stay with you long after it has finished - altogether superior film-making.<br />Hugely recommended!
B00005LW7R|1.0|A couple of days after I attended the live performance in Salzburg under Maazel, I arrived home and listened the so marketed recording by Abbado. I was suprised how a singer and a conductor can combine so bad as to obtain a disaster. Terfel is practically in other world and he doesn't use the whole power of his voice in favour of some sort of acting that's not necessary after Gobbi's, Valdengo's, Bruson's, Evans's and Taddei's. Furthermore, pronounces bad -that's not perceptible in live performance anymore-. Hampson is a disaster with troubles in the diaphragm for singing middle register notes as, for example, compared with Pannerai, that's unsurpassable in this character. Ladies are excelent. I strongly recommend not to buy this recording because it doesn't have absolutely any merit. It is not a myth like Toscanini's and doesn't offer anything new except mistakes. If somebody, as many, like to buy Cd's just for their sound, go ahead, but, clearly I don not understand why it would have to be precisely this jewell called Falstaff by Verdi. I do not want to give my copy for not being judged as stupid, then I think I will trash it for the box occupies too much large a space in my collection. As a matter of fact I'm listening and attending Falstaff performances since 49 years ago.
B00005QJDG|5.0|I have every Dream Theater live album, and I continue to hunt down bootlegs from past tours. It's all quite unnecessary, even wasteful, but such is the pursuit of the Dream Theater fan. Why do I do it? Because I want to have a recording that captures the true greatness of a Dream Theater concert, something that you can't really understand with DT's official live albums. Live at the Marquee was too short and too polished by overdubs. James LaBrie was having some ugly vocal problems on Once in a LIVEtime. Therefore, I am purely ecstatic over Live Scenes from New York - an official album with such fervor and energy that every song sounds new, even if I've memorized every guitar lick and every lyric. These are the qualities for which I search when hunting bootlegs, so to have it in a live release makes me very happy.<br />Live Scenes from New York is not only the best of Dream Theater's live catalogue, but it is the best live (progressive) metal album in 15 years. I do not make this statement lightly; it's tough to contend with this album's three discs, characterized by rugged, furious, and emotionally charged music. This music is everything a live album should be.<br />The highlight is the astonishing performance of Scenes from a Memory in its entirety. LaBrie, who is at his best vocally with this show, shines with his heart-rending emotional power, and he actually augments many passages over the original. The Miracle's malevolent soliloquy on \\"Home\\" is filled with more hunger, more viciousness. \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" makes my vision get blurry as he and Theresa Thomason sing one of the most moving songs I've ever heard. The entire band sounds full of more energy, although it's only understood on an ineffable level. The ears hear what the words can't quite describe. Then there's the instrumental tag at the end of \\"Finally Free,\\" where Petrucci's soaring guitar lines never fail to give me chills.<br />After Scenes from a Memory comes to an end, two more hours of Dream Theater's intense music fills out the rest of the package. Of course, the Metropolis saga wouldn't be complete without \\"Metropolis Pt.1,\\" and the version here is the best live iteration of the song to date (even better than some of the awesome ones from I&W tour bootlegs). \\"The Mirror,\\" \\"Learning to Live,\\" and the devastating 7-string medley (\\"Just Let Me Breathe/Acid Rain/Caught in a New Millennium\\") are captured aggressively. Saxophonist Jay Beckenstein stops by to contribute soprano sax on \\"Another Day,\\" one of the band's best ballads. Here, the beautiful guitar solo lifts me three feet off the ground, and LaBrie's performance is again breathtaking. Jordan Rudess takes the spotlight for a 7-minute keyboard solo, which is enough to justify the purchase of this set on its own. The man is a true prodigy. It's nearly impossible to fathom that he's only playing with two hands.<br />\\"A Mind Beside Itself\\" is played in its entirety, and the delivery blazes all the way to the calm finale of \\"The Silent Man.\\" \\"The Silent Man\\" is actually spiced up with ludic piano and guitar solos, and a soaring electric chorus. John Petrucci's surprisingly awesome background vocals add a great deal to the tune. The band finishes off their massive set with \\"A Change of Seasons.\\" Added solos, Rudess' quirky \\"funhouse\\" piano, and a quote from \\"The Simpsons Theme,\\" all season (whoa, a pun) one of the band's best-loved epics. LaBrie understandably sounds tired by the time the final movement rolls around, but he still performs with energy and conviction.<br />In twenty years, after I've collected an uncountable number of great live albums, I'll probably still regard this as one of the best live rock shows ever. For Dream Theater fans, this will become one of your most prized possessions.m Theater's intense music fills out the rest of the package.

0316776963|4.0|I am a wary reader. I hate fiction dated past the era of Hunter S. Thompson, Hemingway, and Faulkner. I'm comfortable with Kerouac. I'm agitated with anything written past the 1970s. And if I do pick up anything past 1970, it's usually something that can be found in the deepest, darkest dungeons of a brilliant but unnoticed 'zine.<br />So I picked up Sedaris's book for the sole reason that I thought the title was funny. Much to my surprise, the title wasn't the only thing that was amusing about the book. Sedaris is witty without even trying and has this incredible ability to make the obvious and the every day brilliantly funny. He's taken all the things that we complain about--living in Brooklyn, parents, lovers, tourists, learning a language--and has given them a personality of their own, something that I believe that only Sedaris can do. He's turned this anti-contemporary fiction reader into a full-fledged fan.
B000021Y77|2.0|This film is based on a single central idea which isn't particularly original in the first place.  It tells a story from the point of view of several possible outcomes which provides an interesting way of telling a story though it is very reiterative.<br />The film takes place in a typical mittel-Europa city - probably German - and concerns itself with a very slight plot in which there are multiple outcomes.  I won't bore you with the detail but suffice to say that unless you like to look at the eponymous Lola (believe me she's no oil painting) running around the streets to get to talk to various people (hasn't she heard of the &quot;telephone&quot; or the &quot;taxi&quot;; perhaps the title of the film wouldn't work well &quot;Phone Lola Phone&quot; and &quot;Ride Lola Ride&quot; don't really have the same ring to them, I suppose) you'll get pretty bored with this one - especially as it's telling the same story with a different ending three or four times.<br />As entertainment this is only slighly more interesting than watching paint dry.  I'll give it one more star than the absolute minimum due to it's interesting effort to try and tell a story in an innovative manner but beyond that there is very little of value here.<br />Give this one a miss despite what the other fawning 5* reviews here are telling you.
0345413377|5.0|This book was amazing! It made me cry but it was great! I would recommend it highly to all mature readers. It's an awesome story and beautifully told but very dark. Read the first 2 in the series first. They will fill a lot of gaps.
0140177396|4.0|I had to read Of Mice and Men as summer reading for my freshman year in high school.  It's a very good book.  Overrall, I enjoyed it.  There were just some little things I couldn't handle.  Because I'm very sensitive, I wasn't comfortable with certain scenes in the book.  I had trouble reading those parts and I couldn't understand why it happened that way.  John Steinbeck did a good job on this one, on the other hand.  It's well-written and interesting, it just has some flaws.  I still own the book and I still read it every now and then.  But it will never be classified as one of my favorite books.  I recommend it for anyone, but if you're like me, and you have trouble reading about violence and troubling scenes, you might want to hold off for awhile.  I don't want anyone to miss out on a book like this, but I don't want anyone to become upset over it, either.
B000002H2H|5.0|For the most part, I prefer King Diamond and Megadeth over Metallica. But I would be totally insane if I didn't acknowledge that this record is a masterpiece. It's a little shorter than 'Kill Em All,' but shorter does not mean worse. Very few records match the wonderful combination of emotional intensity, attention to lyrics, and well organized music that is intense but does not detract from the song itself. Not only that, but the tracks are so well organized. First 'Fight Fire With Fire' invites us in to this masterpiece of metal and prepares us for what is to come. Then we are hit with the even more emotionally intense 'Ride the Lightning' and  'For Whom the Bell Tolls.' Then the tension is released for a moment (giving us a chance to breathe) with the more gentle 'Fade to Black.' Like a good book, the tension is soon retightened with the captivating and memorable 'Trapped Under Ice.' Then they allow us to breathe for a moment with 'Escape,' before hitting us with the frighteningly intense 'Creeping Death.' Finally, they finish off with the well done instrumental 'The Call of Ktulu.' Often, a record with very intense lyrics finishes with an instrumental track. This allows us to take a moment to reflect on what we have heard for the past 50 minutes or so before we return to reality. Forget the latest trends; forget noise and obscenities; forget issues that wore thin a long time ago; forget records with the 'Warning, Explicit Lyrics' mark. Do yourself a favor! Instead of throwing your financial resources away in a maze where the good stuff is the exception not the rule, PLAY IT SAFE. Get this heavy metal classic that has withstood the test of time. Even if you have to take a trip to an expensive store that has everything, do so. This record is worth a big trip and a little extra cost.
B000002LOE|4.0|Forget &quot;The One I Love,&quot; &quot;It's the End of the World as We Know It,&quot; or even &quot;Stand&quot;--the world found R.E.M. on Out of Time, via smash singles &quot;Losing My Religion&quot; and &quot;Shiny Happy People.&quot;  These are good songs, but they're the worst songs on the record.  Out of Time came in the middle of the Gulf War, and it was exactly what America needed--peaceful, pastoral, and baroque.  Songs like &quot;Religion&quot; and &quot;Country Feedback&quot; showed that the world had a dark side, but most of Out of Time is focused on the beauty to be found.  <br />R.E.M. accomplish their tasks by leaving electric guitars behind, deciding instead to focus on mandolins, acoustic guitars, and elaborate string arrangements.  Bassist Mike Mills takes his first lead vocals since Lifes Rich Pageant on &quot;Texarkana&quot; and &quot;Near Wild Heaven,&quot; and his singing style is considerably less angsty than Michael Stipe's.  <br />Still, Out of Time is just a warm-up for the band's real acoustic masterpiece, 1992's Automatic for the People.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I learned about Diana Krall of &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; and bought all her CDs because her piano and voice were a great combination.  We have no piano jazz here.  I loved Julie London in my youth, but I was expecting D.K.
B00005NIDK|5.0|If you love to love Yes, you'll love this album.  If you love to hate Yes, you'll hate it.  For a long-time die-hard fan like me, Magnification has all the right ingredients for an enjoyable recording.  Jon Anderson's clear voice (which just gets better with age), Chris Squire's punchy and melodic bass, Alan White's precise drumming, and Steve Howe's phenomenal multi-faceted guitar playing sound just as fresh as ever.  Instead of trying to find yet another keyboard player, they used an orchestra, which really complements the band's sound.  There are soaring melodies, gentle ballads, and driving rockers.  The lyrics are as deliciously esoteric as they've ever been and the music has the usual well-crafted finesse.  I bought the import off of Amazon and I'm glad I got it early.  Rather than compare it to other recordings, it's better listened to on its own terms.
B000002USN|1.0|I love Frank Sinatra, which is the reason I do not like this disc.  None of the duets were recorded with both parties in the room together, and you can here it.  It's electronic gimmickry.  The duets are done with people who do not sing in the Pop style that Sinatra sings in; therefore, the songs are uneven and sound bad.  Sinatra is also not in good form.  He is 77 and I don't think he should have recorded this.  I prefer to remember him in the 1950's, when I think he was at his best.  I would not buy this, unless you want to hear his next to last recording.  Duets II is the last one.  I woulnd't buy that one either.
B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic for the People is without a doubt R.E.M.'s best record, and it may well be the best record ever made.  It, like all other R.E.M. records, is a concept album, this time about mortality, life and love.  Michael Stipe is at his most fragile on tracks like &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;Sweetness Follows,&quot; while &quot;Ignoreland,&quot; while possibly a little out of place amongst the rest of the songs, shows that he hasn't lost his Document-era political vitriol.  <br />The band's at top form here, too, again preferring to use acoustic instruments over electric ones.  The soundscapes they create are haunting, immediate and gorgeous.  This album above all others makes me want to make albums.  I hear that's the highest compliment you can give a musician.
B00005N9CV|5.0|Wonderful music to chill out to.  Great song selection. A must have

6305878323|5.0|\\"Mary Poppins.\\"  Many film critics call it the best Walt Disney movie ever made... the crowning achievement from a studio that has brought us such timeless classics as \\"Fantasia,\\" \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,\\" \\"Bambi,\\" \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" and \\"The Lion King.\\"  For my money, Mary Poppins tops `em all! This fabulous musical comedy, starring Julie Andrews, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, and Glynis Johns, and based on the best selling British children's books written by P.L. Travers, ranks as one of the two best children's movies ever made. (The other being \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\")<br /><br />Where to begin? This is such an extraordinary movie!! It has everything that a great kid's movie should have: a wonderful story that teaches strong family values; a brilliant cast; absolutely stunning special effects (even by today's standards); and wonderful music. Here are just a few of the things I like best about \\"Mary Poppins:\\"<br /><br />THE ACTING is absolutely brilliant! Julie Andrews won a Best Actress Academy Award for her portrayal of Mary Poppins. She imbues her character with the reserve so prevalent in British society during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. At the same time, she manages to convey a wonderful sense of joy, kindness, and compassion toward the children. Dick Van Dyke is superb as the carefree chimney sweep ans jack-of-all-trades, Bert. His relaxed comic style is perfectly matched to his character. And, while his Cockney accent doesn't quite deliver the goods accurately, it's nevertheless pretty good. (By the way, look for Mr. Van Dyke in a secondary role in this film. I won't tell you which one... but it's unlikely you'll miss him!) David Tomlinson is the third stand-out member of this fabulous ensemble cast. He's practically perfect as the pompous, stuffy martinet of a father, George Banks. Other cast members are excellent as well, especially Glynis Johns as Winifred Banks; and Ed Wynn in his hilarious role as the laughing man, Uncle Albert.<br /><br />THE WRITING: Screen writers Bill Walsh and Don Da Gradi adapted \\"Mary Poppins\\" from the series of British children's books authored by P.L. Travers (1899-1996) This is a tender story that addresses many family issues that were as problematic at the beginning of the twentieth century as they are today: responsibility, accountability, and the proper role of parents in the rearing of their children. In the Banks household, we find a family with many of the same problems that afflict today's families: two parents, each focused on their own interests, each so busy with their own lives that they have precious little time to forge and maintain loving bonds with their children. What are the possible consequences for the children? How can these problems be addressed and solved? The beauty of this story is that it's done in a way that's easy for kids, even younger ones (I'd say ages six and older) to understand and learn from.<br /><br />THE MUSIC: All of the music and lyrics in \\"Mary Poppins\\" are original... composed by Richard Sherman and his brother Robert. This film has some of the best songs ever to appear in a movie! Each song is in itself a classic: \\"A Spoonful of Sugar;\\" \\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious;\\" (I think that's how it's spelled!); \\"Feed the Birds\\" (my personal favorite); Academy Award-winning \\"Chim Chim Cher-ee;\\" \\"Step in Time;\\" and \\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\\" are but a few of the magical, sometimes whimsical, but always \\"practically perfect\\" songs that make this film such a wonderful musical experience.<br /><br />And then there's THE MAGIC... the special effects! In its day, \\"Mary Poppins\\" was on the \\"cutting edge\\" of movie-making technology. Examples of these (what were then) ultra-modern special effects: this was one of the first films to use miniature robotics for animation. (That robin that lands on the window sill during \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" is a miniature robotic bird!) And, of course, this is also one of the first films to combine real-life actors and animation extensively (the entire sequence with Mary, Bert and the children inside the sidewalk chalk picture.) These special effects may seem a bit tame when compared with today's computer-generated graphics, but make no mistake: they're still eye-popping!<br /><br />Go beyond all the glitz and glitter of the film, and you'll find at the heart of \\"Mary Poppins\\" a simple story about family, with important lessons for all of us - children and adults alike - on how we can make our homes better and happier places to live.<br /><br />By today's standards, \\"Mary Poppins\\" may seem a little old-fashioned, even dated. But it's still a great kid's movie! With a well written, touching story, superb music, and outstanding special effects, it's at once brilliantly funny, poignant, joyous, carefree, and just plain marvelous entertainment. It earns my highest recommendation.tors and animation extensively (the entire sequence with Mary, Bert and the children inside the sidewalk chalk picture.)

B000002LFU|3.0|Green is nothing if not a transitional piece--a transitional piece between IRS Records and Warner Bros., but more importantly, a transitional piece between the hard, angry, political sound of Lifes Rich Pageant and Document and the more pastoral, personal sounds to come on Out of Time and Automatic for the People.  Transitional pieces don't tend to make good records, and Green is no real exception.<br />I used to say that I liked half of the album, until people started asking me which songs I disliked.  I can't really name any (save &quot;Hairshirt&quot;), so I've instead started saying I like the songs half as much as I like the typical R.E.M. song.  While &quot;Orange Crush,&quot; &quot;The Wrong Child&quot; and especially &quot;Get Up&quot; deliver what you're looking for in spades, &quot;You Are Everything,&quot; &quot;Pop Song 89&quot; and &quot;World Leader Pretend&quot; feel like they're missing something.  <br />There was really nothing the band could do about it, though; Green was a mediocre record that needed to be made so that the world could get Out of Time and Automatic for the People.  It was my least favorite R.E.M. record, up until they released Reveal this summer.  But that's another review...
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie fits the well worn cliche: &quot;Fun for all ages&quot; better than any other film before it. I'm 17, and my normal diet of action films and other such &quot;grown up&quot; movies was supplanted purely by accident by this little gem. After i saw it, i took my baby cousins, my friend, my mum and my grandmother to go and see it. It is rare that you will find a movie that appeals to all these demogrpahic groups but in Shrek you have the answer to the family movie dilemma. <br />The quality of the image is magnificent, the characters colourful and the voice acting superb. Eddie Murphy is at his best since Beverly Hills Cop as the fast talking donkey, and although many people have criticised Cameron Diaz's role, it is beyond reproach. Mike Meyers and John Lithgow turn in similarly professional efforts as Shrek and Lord Farquaad.<br />The humour is razor sharp and there is enough witty sarcasm to appeal to the adults, as well as Shrek's disgusting habits to appeal to the little ones. Disney will not be happy with some of the biting satire aimed in its direction!<br />Stop wasting time reading this review and go and buy the damn tape.
B000002MU3|5.0|Yes, this album is quite different from their previous albums, but it is still a great album.
B000001Y5D|5.0|What can i say....This cd contains the most<BR>beautiful music i have ever heard.Lindas vocal talent make my spine shiver....You`ll just have to hear for yourself.<BR>Its fantastic!!!!!!!
B00005OMTT|5.0|This is a wonderful album!  The mood is set in the first song, so you can tell the feeling just by hearing the first song.  The album has many of the classic favorites like Return to Innocence, or Gravity of love.  If you are a new Enigma fan I reccomend you get this Album so that you can hear their great songs!
B000002BE9|4.0|Although Fiona Apple's Tidal is not a new release, it is a solid record.  It has a little something for everyone.  Even my mom (almost 80 yrs old) likes portions of it.  My impression whenever I listen to Fiona's music is that it is fresh, (even after 5 years of listening to it) very well produced and the arrangements still team me up!  This keyboard oriented music and deep lyrics make this a great CD for your collection.
B0000524CY|4.0|William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist-The Version You've Never Seen<br />First off, the film. I think that The Exorcist is a very good movie. It is well done, well acted and written and directed. The movie really clicks because of some of the main actor's wonderfull potrayols of some of the characters. For one, Ellen Burstyn is simply sensational in her lead role as a tough mother who must watch as her innocent daughter is possesed by a foul mouthed demon, Pazuzu. Burstyn is a wonderful, talented actress and she played the role so well, it's like she's not acting! Jason Miller as Preist/Psychiatrist Father Damien Karras is just great. His quilt ridden character, fearing that he is losing his faith, is duplicated so very well by Miller's performance, his facial expressions, the way he talks, his eyes.... he's very convincing in this important role. Max von Sydow, as old Father <BR>Merrin, is also very, very good. He was covered in thick layers of make-up to look older than he really was, and he still acted great. Wonderfull job that I feel deserved an Oscar. Lee J. Cobb, in a pretty much unimortant and gratuitous role, is still quite stunning. He plays Detective William F. Kinderman, a fan of movies as well as a sly investigator. Well done. Father Karras' sick mother is portrayed by Vasiliki Maliaros, and although she didn't ever make another movie, she's excellent as an old, dieing woman who stays sweet to her son. Now, of course, you can't forget Linda Blair, can you? No. I don't think anyone who sees this movie could forget Linda Blair as the demon possesed 12 year old girl. Mrs. Blair received an Acadamy Award Nomination for this movie, and I say it was well deserved. Although her voice was dubbed over by Mercedes McCambridge and the gross-out scenes were done with Eileen Deitz (is that spelled right?), Mrs. Blair does some sensational things in this movie. It's the way she let herself go and just acted that made her performance unforgettable. The directing on thisfilm is quite good. It's been reported that director William Freidkan beat up his cast and crew to get a good reaction on-screen (he even fired guns to make people look surprised) but I beleive that's what made the acting so good. The writing on this is also good. William Peter Blatty adapted his bestseller book into a movie and I think he did a good job. He didn't change much from the book, but his adaption does the book faithfully and his script is well written, especially in the first half (those medical examination scenes give me the creeps). <br />Some people have said the movie is only about a girl who gets possesed and spews pea soup and has sex with a crucifix, but this movie does have a message. It's quite difficult to find, and I know that when I first watched the movie, I thought it had nothing to do with faith, but after several repeated veiwings, I can see what the message is. There are several scenes about faith and it's faith that is needed to save the poor little girl, Reagan, but Father Karras is losing his. The film has a strong moral behind all the possesion scenes, but it's hard to find. <br />The Exorcist has already gone through two DVD releases, one of poorer quality than the others. The second release, the 25th Anniversary Special Edition, was very good, full of extras and a beautiful transfer for the picture and sound, but this \\"Version You've Never Seen\\" release is slightley better, yet slightley poorer. The picture and sound on this one are far better than the previous release, much less film grain and brighter colors. The sound is in a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack that is quite spectacular. The new version adds scenes, which blend in seamlessly, as well as some discarded musical cues that help add to the tension. The new scenes flesh out the characters and the reason behind the girl's possesion, and there's also the shocking \\"Spider-walk\\" which really made me jump. I won't tell you what happens, but it's quite a surprise! There are also some new CGI effects that I feel add to the creepiness, also. The new epilouge between Father Dyer (Rev. William O' Malley) and Detective Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) was mostly hated by fans and criticts (including Roger Ebert) but I like it a lot. At first I didn't think much of it, but now, having seen the third film, I can see why this scene's important (Dyer and Kinderman are good freinds in Part 3). We've also got an extended scene of Merrin's arrival at the house, him asking Reagan's middle name, a conversation on the stairs in a break in the exorcism, a slightley longer beggining, a new medical examination scene near the beggining, as well as a scene of Father Karras examining a recording of Reagan before she got possesed (very helpful). Those are the good things about this DVD, but the bad things are there, too. The disk seems to lack in any special features. Sure, you got some interesting notes, trailers (for the 2000 version) and a commentary, but it's not nearly as packed as the 25th Anniversary disk, which has TWO commentaries, a very insightfull 76 minute documentary, trailers, cast index, and a few more things. This disk has a different commentary by director Freidkan than the other disk, and this one is far worse. It's a commentary in which the director gives almost no insight into the making of the film (except at the beggining) and goes for basically saying \\"In this scene Reagan steals a cookie from the cookie jar and Chris chases her to get it back\\" or \\"Chris asks Karras if Reagan will die and he sais 'No'\\". Not a good commentary. I like the trailers and Radio Spots, though. They're quite well done. <br />The movie, as I said, looks great. Occasional grain comes, but not to often and the print is quite breathtaking (this movie was made in 1973?). It's presented in its original widescreen format and it features a 5.1 track, a Mono, and French sub-titles. <br />So, anyway, I'd say you decide which Exorcist DVD you like best. You must at least rent the 25th Anniversary disk and watch the wonderful documentary, but I say this version is better.
630407185X|4.0|three stars for everyone else.  If you're not a warmovie or WWII history buff, you're probably going to find &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; pretty heavy going.  Based on actual events and people taken from Cornelius Ryan's masterful book of the same name- still one of the best books ever written about a WWII campaign, &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; details one of the most interesting operations of the entire war- an attempt to capture a series of bridges with paratroops which would link up a highway across the Rhine and into Germany ending the war by Christmas 1944.  Unfortunately, the operation, codenamed Market-Garden, was a failure and almost doomed to such a fate from its inception.<br />A huge big-budget film about an Allied defeat probably could not have been made in any other decade than the 70's.  The post Vietnam hangover and its anti-military fallout, especially of high command decisions, would seemingly allow a filmmaker to delve into a defeat such as Market-Garden which plays perfectly into a Vietnam-like story of military egos gone astray cooking up grandiose plans and ignoring anything that interferes with those plans including the risk to the lives of thousands of young soldiers.  ABTF attempts to tackle this topic by making the real antagonists not the Germans, but British Field Marshall Montgomery, who is never seen, and British Lt. Gen Browing (Dirk Bogarde) who acts as the voice of Montgomery.  Unfortunately, director Richard Attenborough was not up to the job to make this angle work.  Maybe &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; was too much for one man.  In contrast &quot;The Longest Day,&quot; the film which ABTF mimics with its huge all-star cast and screenplay based on a Cornelius Ryan book, was directed by four different men.  While &quot;The Longest Day&quot; was hailed by critics and audiences alike, ABTF received mixed reviews, and audiences in 1977 were more interested in seeing &quot;Star Wars&quot; than a movie which has garnered a reputation for ponderous boredom.<br />I loved this movie as a kid since there weren't too many color WWII movies with this kind of budget- the columns of armored vehicles, the mass paratroop drops, and some of the set piece battle scenes are fantastic to watch.  I still find Grabner's attack across Arnhem bridge and Julian Cook's (Robert Redford)assault across the Waal River to be terrific filmmaking.  However, ABTF contents itself to tell us more about stuff rather than show it such as the 82nd's attempt to take Nijmegem town and, although the film details John Frost's (Anthony Hopkins) battle on the bridge, the rest of British 1st Airborne's struggle is barely shown- the film reduces all the fighting around Oosterbeek to shells going off around division HQ.  The result is a rather quiet war movie with lot's of generals talking, but sparse action.<br />In many ways ABTF is a triumph, but it's more of a triumph of logistics than of film.  It tries very hard to touch the heart, with its story of sacrifice and heroism which might have been in vain, but it really never succeeds.
0061040967|5.0|This is fantastic ! I've been a Pratchett fan for quite a long time now and he just keeps surprising me. Just when I thought I'd seen it all, he just comes up with something totally new ! OK, I have to admit it, the story isn't as good as some of his others. Well, maybe &quot;good&quot; is not the right word, ofcourse the story is good, but it's just not as complicated, as detailed as the other masterpieces Terry gave birth to. It is more of a slideshow of all the witty characters he's been creating during the past decades. For a die-hard DW fan like me, reading this book was like coming home from an unforgettable holiday and looking at all those incredibly funny pictures I took there. And then Paul Kidby, he is unbelievable ! I do like to draw myself, but the day I create something that's even half as fantastic as Kidby's works of art, I'll buy all the people who've read this review a copy of my favourite Pratchett book, &quot;Wyrd Sisters&quot;. What more does any sane man desire than a combination of Terry's great writing talent and Paul's magical drawing hand ? The best way to describe what it feels like to read this book, is to compare it with the books I read in my childhood. I just felt 7 again; reading a wonderfull tale about heroes and magic, made even more wonderfull by marvellous drawings. Every page you turn is a revelation, opens a new world of colours and words. I found myself staring at the pictures as if I were a little boy, seeing his first airoplane. And what is more honest than the amazement and the pure delight of a child ? Just buy this, you won't regret it !
B000003TA4|5.0|This album changed my life. It has this force and strength about it that blows me away every time, yet also something really innocent. Eventhough some lyrics are a bit hard to understand, the songs' melodies are unique to any album I have heard. This album will remain in my heart and my CD player forever.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Morning View. What a perfect name for this album. I can easily picture myself sitting on the beach on the cover on an early spring morning listenning to this CD. I was first introduced to Incubus with 1997's brilliant S.C.I.E.N.C.E. Incubus' main influences are Faith No More, Primus, Helmet, and The Red Hot Chili Peppers which are all some of my favorite bands. Its obvious that I would take a quick liking to this band from my hometown of Los Angeles. Whether it be Brandon's vocal similarities to the &quot;smooth as silk&quot; Mike Patton, Alex's &quot;fastest gun in the west&quot; funky slap, Jose's amazing work with his Zildjian's, DJ Lyfe's creative scratching, or Mike's &quot;Jazz-to-Funk-to-Metal in 1.2 seconds&quot; riffery, I could not, no matter how hard I tried, get S.C.I.E.N.C.E. out of my CD player. When I first heard &quot;Pardon Me&quot; I thought that Make Yourself may be even better than S.C.I.E.N.C.E. I was beyond disappointed when I heard Make Yourself all the way through. I felt that Incubus had sold out more than any band had sold out before. It took me a long time to see Incubus for what they are. One day I decided to listen to &quot;The Warmth&quot; and for some unknown reason, loved it. I finally realized what Incubus was trying to do, to be a talented band that everyone can like. I am able to accept the fact that Incubus may never produce an experimental masterpiece like S.C.I.E.N.C.E. again as long as they keep up their original and creative ideas.<br />Morning View is mainly a mix of Faith No More styled song structures, Helmet inspired riffery, and Red Hot Chili Pepper inspired melodic-funk numbers. &quot;Nice To Know You&quot; shows Incubus' love for Faith No More with its maniacal speed changes. &quot;Circles&quot; slams the Helmet styled riffery in your face like a sledgehammer. &quot;Circles'&quot; inspiration can even be pinpointed to an exact Helmet track, &quot;Biscuits For Smut&quot;. &quot;Just A Phase&quot;, &quot;11am&quot;, and &quot;Echo&quot; sound like many of the slow funk tracks on the Red Hot Chili Peppers Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Morning View may not be as original as S.C.I.E.N.C.E. or Fungus Amongus, but with influences such as Faith No More, Primus, and Helmet they can't go wrong.
0440219078|5.0|I write this review short after I finished the book. I found it very good, because of the &quot;Utopic&quot; society the Community is. It makes you to examine your mind. Buy, do not mind the 1 star reviews. If you didnt liked it, it is because this kind of book does not appeal you, or you are not open-minded. And one thing, Im thirteen years old.
6304082428|5.0|This mini-series was probably the best leisure-time investment I've ever made. The acting was wonderful, the scenery beautiful, the work of Jane Austen inspiring. I could watch this again and again. Probably the ultimate classic &quot;chick flick&quot;, it's perfect for a solitary evening with a glass of wine (or two...), a few tissues and has the ability to refresh you with its storyline and ending, giving you a kinder outlook on life.
6303347657|4.0|If you are reading this, what is wrong with you? If you haven't seen this movie ten thousand times, then you probably aren't normal.  Anyway, this a definitly a good comedy back in the day when Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler and all them were hilarious.  This movie good, but I would recommend you buy a more recent movie if you want to spend your money, cause you will probably have a chance to watch this movie many times.
B000001DTM|5.0|The year is 1991. U2 are an exhausted band: having produced 3 classic album's, including 1987's Joshua Tree, many expected them, as a lesser band might have done, run out of creative energy. So what do they do to dispel all that?<br />They make a record as good as Achtung Baby, that's what. Updating their sound and pulling them into the 90s, it is the sound of a band snatching victory at what could have been the last minute.<br />Filled with unforgettable tunes ('Mysterious Ways', 'Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses', 'Ultra Violet'), moody slices of pain ('One', 'So Cruel') and distorted weird rhythms ('Zoo Station'), Achtung Baby blending its trademark guitars and vocals perfectly. What can I say? I'll tell you what I can say: Achtung Baby is a classic.

B00005IC2H|5.0|Wow, why do all the great Scandinavian astc sound so warm, epic, creating a whole new universe like Bjork, Norwegian rock act Madrugada or Swedish modern folkrock act Garmarna? Sigur Ros creates atmospheres we never heard of in rockmusic-land. This here is Tolkien-like, creating fairy-tales, sounding like stormy winternights in middle Iceland (and there are a lot of them overthere) or like the soundtrack of a haunting thriller as the Blair Witch Project! These songs overhere are different, unconventional, epic, spheric, sometimes rocking, then jazzy, sometimes referring to Scandinavian or Islandic folk music, then sounding like classical music or even opera... <BR>Sigur Ros creates the same world as, for instance Bjork thoes, only this songs are a bit more complex. Other references? What to think of the great DEAD CAN DANCE with their magnificent repertoire? Sometimes you think Sigur Ros is creating the same world as DCD did years ago. Warm, weird, epic and spheric... Just magnificent!
B00005QIPH|5.0|Ok, I have to admit, I didn't hear any of the &quot;hype&quot; about this band before I came across this disc (maybe I have better things to do than read countless magazines telling me what's cool). I simply found this disc on one of those listening stations at a local record store and was hooked instantly!<br />Equal parts sloppy and structured, noisy and melodic. These guys obviously know how to play, and know how to write a tune - and have just the right amount of indifference and punk-type apathy to make things interesting. This is what rock has been missing in recent years. The influences are there - a little Iggy Pop, a dash of early Bowie, some Lou Reed/Velvet Underground, yet the Strokes aren't just regurgitating these styles like so many other bands these days, rather, they use these sources to create music that's new and refreshing, yet vaguely familiar at the same time.<br />Forget the &quot;hype&quot; and it's inevitable backlash. Let the indie music nerds and music rags debate about who in or out, cool or lame. Let YOUR ears tell you what's good. Mine tell me this is a great disc, period.

B00004WGAA|4.0|I recently bought a Carnival of Souls / Horror Hotel combo DVD for dirt cheap, since I wanted something spooky for Halloween.  This DVD, if you can find it, is a great deal at $6! Carnival of Souls is the Blair Witch Project of the 1960s - a horror film made on a nothing budget that developed quite a cult following.  Sure, the acting is B-tier and the black and white film doesn't have that Hollywood slickness, but it's quite good!  Some of the images, especially at the end, are rather disturbing and even remind me of classic horror silent films.<br />The second film, Horror Hotel, is another great B-tier horror film from the 1960s.  I'd never heard of it, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, despite the silly title.  Christopher Lee has a small role in it, too.  Anyhow, it's a film about a college student who travels to a small New England town to do research on witchcraft for her term paper.  Of course, she discovers more than she bargained for (that's all I'll say about the plot, I don't like to give away plots).  The film reminds me a lot of the classic Italian horror film Black Sunday (with Barbara Steele) and Hitchcock's Psycho.  The photography is moody and eerie, and the film still has the power to frighten us, even in this day and age.<br />A few words about the DVD - both films are presented on the same side.  Sound is strictly monophonic and perhaps a little shrill at times, but it is overall quite acceptable.  The video quality varies.  Carnival of Souls was really crystal clear (surprising in a budget DVD) with only the occasional scratch or dust mark; the only thing I didn't like was this wavy thing that sometimes wandered across the image.  Kinda like some RF modulation wave (I'm not a tech-head, so that's the best I can describe it).  Still, unless you have the money to buy the very expensive Criterion DVD of carnival of souls (quite a good DVD, I hear), this DVD is more than good enough.  Horror Hotel's video is not as clear and tends to have a softer appearing image.  Kinda like watching a black/white film on TV, I think.  But the image is still very acceptable, and hey, for $6, you get two great horror films!  How can you lose?  I recommend this DVD if you can find it!
B000001EAQ|5.0|I remember listening to this album not too long after it came out back in that cold morning in early 1997 and loved it. I was blown away by this CD.  It's a shame that it sold poorly because this is one of their most consistent CDs ever. This album goes into a techno atmosphere like Zooropa but only better and more rock sounding this time. The landmark sound is present in some songs on here but this overall is an experimental record. The poor success of this and Zooropa persuaded them to return to their roots with ATYCLB which I,m not complaining at all about.<br />It was foolish for critics to say that U2 veered off path and flat out screwed up. Well that's their problem because this CD is one of their highlight CDs.<br />Discotheque is a techno\rock\dance number that will get your feet stomping with those phat beats. This is a bangin opener to this CD. Do You Feel Loved is a great song with synthesizer guitar licks and phat beats. This song would have been a great mainstream song. Mofo is my favorite song on this CD. This song may be too techno for casual fans but this is one of the best songs they,ve ever written. The sound effects at the beginning is a little harsh for my ears. It almost sounds like something from a Front 242 album. It has those familiar U2 guitar sounds. Things slow down with the mournful If God Will Send His Angels. This is the most beautiful song U2 have done since One from Achtung Baby from 1991. It's very mellow and joyous and sad at the same time. I played this one quite a bit during the next few days after the September 11 attacks. Staring At The Sun is a cool song with more of the synthesized electronic guitar licks. Last Night On Earth is rockin!!!!!! The sort of ambient intro is awesome. The song then becomes a hard rocking song that really gets my mental juices flowing. Gone is similar to Last Night On Earth but not quite as fast. It's another good song. It ends with the guitars still going for another 6 seconds. Miami is a song that I've heard a lot of bad talk about. I on the other hand love this song. Don't be fooled by the song title. This song is NOT a beach song. It's a strange dark trancey song with an awesome drum loop like nothing I've heard before. This song would be something to play when driving on the outskirts of a large city during the wee hours of the morning. The Playboy Mansion is another song that has been bad-mouthed. This song is a very blues-sounding song. This song is a good song. If You Wear That Velvet Dress is a quiet sensual song probably the most sensual song U2 have ever done. Please is a spooky track with an ambient sound that reminds me of looking out a window on a stormy evening. Great Song. Wake Up Dead is an average closer to this CD. The beats are average and the songs sounds thrown together. The sound effects at the beginning and ending are cool though. Probably the only thin spot on this CD.<br />Apart from one thin moment this is a very underrated CD. I suggest that you run to the music store and buy this CD! It's one that you'll regret passing up! I'd recommend this one ...I've heard a lot of bad talk about. I on the other hand love this song. Don't be fooled by the song title.

B00004Z4SD|4.0|Howdy!  First of all, I've seen most of David Lynch's films, and I think this one is one of his best films.  It is a surprisingly straight forward film (rated G, for goodness sakes! on a Lynch film??) and boasts some of the best landscape cinematography, in my humble opinion, since Days of Heaven or The Horse Whisperer.  It is really quite beautiful.  And Richard Farnsworth offers a superb performance as the man who decides to trek cross country to visit his brother (If you don't already know, this film was based on a true story).  Those people interested in Mr. Farnsworth's performance should definitely check out Anne of Green Gables (it is always on PBS for fund-raising and it is probably one of the best family films of the last several decades, honestly!).<br />This film is slow and methodical and is quite a good counter-point to all the MTV-editing style action films of the day.  But you can read about the plot elsewhere, I want to say a few words about the DVD itself.  This is a STRANGE DVD, to be blunt.  I know David Lynch usually does strange things, but this is *really* strange.  The video and audio quality of the DVD are quite good - no complaints there.  But this is totally bare-bones, only a trailer and nothing else.  Nothing.  Considering the really hefty price tag this DVD has, that's nonsensical.  But the weirdest thing is that the movie is NOT divided into any chapters at all.  It's all ONE chapter.  So if you watch one hour, plug in a different DVD, and then return to this one, you'll have to fast-forward through the entire movie to get back to where you were.  Heaven forbid that you should have a power outage 5 minutes before the end of the movie.  I guess Mr. Lynch wants us to watch the entire film in one setting, but really...<br />So, I rate the film a very HIGH 5 stars, but because of the peculiar presentation of the DVD, I must bump it down to 4 stars. Despite this, I really recommend this film - it's perfect for the family and it even teachessome valuable lessons on the virtues of unity and family.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I absolutely LOVE Creed!!! They're definitely #1 on my list, Lifehouse (sounds like Creed) being just underneath them. My FAV Creed songs are Higher &amp; With Arms Wide Open.

B000059PR3|2.0|This movie is a hodgepodge, a gangly monster that ole Dr. Frankenstein would be proud of.  It has a great score, good atmosphere and some great scares.  However, the script feels like it was thrown together, failing to bring all of the usually bizarre Fulci elements together.  Admittedly, Fulci's other films, such as THE BEYOND, CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD, and ZOMBIE, are wild and wooly but, at least the made sense in their own way.  This one doesn't.  You could drive a cement truck through some of the plot holes.  The viewer is left abandoned in a maze of strange but ultimately empty and meaningless situations with no clue as to what to make of it all.  It's sad that Fulci's finest period had to end on this sour note.
0684833395|4.0|Great book, great ideas, read it, but before you do know some things.<br />First, remember that this book is &quot;Catch-22,&quot; not &quot;such and such at war&quot; or whatever.  I read the first ten reviews an only one mentioned it.  An C-22 is not the unexcapeable situation the dictionary would have you believe it is.  I don't want to spoil the story for anyone, so I'll just say know there are scences that better handle C-22 than the Doc's.  It initially seemed to be about 1/2 dozen things that only shared a name  in common but after a few reads it clicked.<br />As others have pointed out, the novel is not cronological in order.  This makes the novel difficult to understand, and that combined with the difficulty of understanding C-22 the idea brought my rating down to 4 stars.
B000002H70|5.0|This album is really amazing! I have outgrown almost every band I used to listen to but this album still amazes me every time I listen to it.<br />Absolutely the best!
B00005LQ6S|5.0|As a huge highlander fan I jumped at the chance to by the new film ENDGAME. It is a fantastic movie with insights into the early years of Connor Mcleod and Duncan Mcleods immortality. There is more depth into Connors past and the special effects are brilliant. Although it doesn't quite follow the films before it or for that matter the series starring Adrian Paul, I feel the that the film was well written and produced. This film really is a must for any Highlander fan, the fight scenes and swordsmanship are remarkable.<BR>The ending of the film I feel was slightly controversial but it was probably the best way to end it.<BR>It's just a shame that this film is not on release in the UK just yet, so go out and buy a NTSC playback VCR and buy this film.<BR>FANTASTIC!!
6300208699|4.0|it's always so nice to see Ringo. Peter Sellers is such a funny fellow. Knowing that they were good friends makes me wonder what they were putting in thier pipe and smoking while filming. And let's not forget the drinks to wash it down.
B000002IZM|5.0|I'll say it in as few words as possible: this album haunts me, even though I've never seen the movie. Great score! And very human, even though the basic premise is about artificial life.
B00005LC1H|5.0|If you've been living up in a tree, and haven't yet seen the utterly hilarious British sit-com Fawlty Towers, now's your chance. <BR>This all-too-brief series has been dusted off and brought back out with cast member interviews, a short tour of the town it was filmed in, out-takes, and commentary by the directors John Howard Davies and Bob Spiers<BR>John Cleese (of Monty Python) is Basil Fawlty, a hotel owner who barely maintains his very last thread of sanity as attempts to manage a small hotel in Torquay, England. <BR>Basil is continuously at odds with his more practical wife, Sybil (Prunella Scales), and his simple butler Manuel (Andrew Sachs). <BR>Manuel is a waiter from Barcelona who serves as Cleese comic foil, and finds himself on the receiving end of Basil Fawlty's verbal, and horrifying physical abuse regularly throughout the twelve episodes. <BR>The poor man is slapped, kicked, choked, gets his head slammed into a wall, is smacked with a frying pan, has his buttocks speared by a fork, and even has one of his eyes gouged by Basil in front of the guests who are usually attempting to eat a quiet meal while pretending to ignore the carnage going on inches away.<BR>Andrew Sachs was compensated for burns suffered during the filming of the show, and nearly had his front teeth knocked out when Basil smashed him in the face with a spoon. The frying pan attack gave Sachs a headache for two days.<BR>Basil's only real support throughout the show comes from the hotel maid, Polly (played by Connie Booth, a regular on Monty Python's Flying Circus, who with Cleese co-wrote the entire story). <BR>Polly bails him out of danger constantly. By the end of the series it's apparent that she and Manuel are really the ones running everything, as they both attempt to cope with Basil's neurotic outbursts and &quot;sledge hammer wit&quot;. <BR>My favorite episode centers around a group of German tourists who have come to stay for the weekend in Toquay, and unwittingly booked rooms atFawlty Towers.<br />Basil is obsessed with the horrors of World War Two, and won't let the German tourists forget &quot;who won the bloody war anyway&quot;. <BR>He marches like a rabid Nazi into the small dining room where they sit horrified. They finally ask him to stop going on and on about Hitler as he take their orders. <BR>&quot;You started it.&quot; He cries defensively.<BR>&quot;We did not start it!&quot;<BR>&quot;Yes you did, you invaded Poland!&quot;<BR>Fawlty Towers received rave reviews from the press, and was named the #1 television program of all time by the British Film Institute. It was also hailed as &quot;The best farce ever written in the English language&quot;, and &quot;The Sistine Chapel of sitcoms&quot;.<BR>As a fan of Monty Python you probably already know about this one. If not, here's the prospect of seeing something that puts any American comedy to shame.<BR>Falwty Towers is available on three DVDs with four episodes on each disc.
0446677450|3.0|The book was a good read and had good info, but for the most part, nothing really that isn't commonsense. (There were a few surprises, but not many.) Also, it really isn't applicable to me at this time in my life. I think the demographics are meant for someone a little older.
B000002UAI|2.0|I don't actually own this album in my colection but with compilation disks, mp3 etc I have heard nearly all the songs. I have to say this is the worst beatles album ever, sorry.  I'm not saying It's bad, it's just the Beatles are the best group in the world ever and this realy doesn't do justice to them.  I am a fan of all beatles songs, but there first songs are no-where near as good as there later, more mature albums.  There are quite a few more maturer songs on this album than on A hard days night, but I find them a little boring and not as easy to listen over and over a hundered times (like I do with all other beatles songs).  Unlike old Albums such as Please Please Me, Beatles For sale's songs arn't catchy enough - BFS is an attemt at being more mature but the songs just do not work.  If you have all the other Beatles albums and you need to complete your collection, get this, all BIG beatles fans should have it.  But get Please Please Me and Anything after Revolver First...
B00005OMTT|4.0|Amazing collection ! One of the best &quot;greatest hits&quot; EVER put together ! Although (i must admit) i expected a some more new creations (hence 4 stars) which could've done magic to it, but that's a staunch Enigma fan talking. Long story short, a must have for the enigma clan, an absolute essential for the uninitiated ! &quot;Go buy it !&quot;
B00004ZAV3|2.0|Well, I have been a beatles fan for 13 years (all my life) I was brought up on the beatles albums my dad owned and I loved them.  I now have nearly all the beatles albums, and this was one that I got last Christmas.  It was a great compilation of all the best Beatles songs, but you get bored of them after a bit, because they are ALL the songs off the albums, it is a nice album with great songs, but it doesn't really show off all the beatles talents with them trying out new styles of music.  So It's not great, but I like it...

0792844793|5.0|David lynch's Blue velvet is a cinematic masterpiece the photography by Frederick Elmes is simply amazing. The DVD is not bad either good sound and picture and thats all you need for this film. I am very surprized this film didn't get a NC-17 rating it should of but thats the Mpaa. for ya. I recommend this film to everyone who likes disturbing films. Warning: This film contains strong sex scens,rape scens,and strong violence and language.
6305311463|4.0|OK let's face it,Armageddon is overblown,unrealistic,badly acted,and isn't going to be on the AFI 100 list any time soon.But it is entertaining,fun,and filled with exciting space action,a prime summetime blockbuster.Blasting Armageddon for lack of subtley and brains is like blasting Saving Private Ryan for lack of humor and good cheer. Also,I'm deeply offended by reviews that call people who like this film stupid and lacking good taste.I enjoy &quot;good&quot; flicks like Traffic,Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon and American Beauty as much as allegedly &quot;bad&quot; ones like Gone In 60 Seconds,Charlie's Angels,and this one.So don't be closed-minded,folks.Enjoy what you want to enjoy,make up your own mind. I've made up my mind that I love Armageddon,despite its flaws.The Criterion Collection,in addition to being packed to the max with features, has a slightly better picture and sound quality than the previous bare-bones edition.
0783225792|5.0|This is by far one of Martin scorsese's best film's and always will be. Robert Richerdson's Photography is brillent and the performances are wonderful from the whole cast. The DVD is ok it has good picture and sound thats about it. But the violence is extremely graphic and I am surprized that it didnt get The NC-17 rating. But its still a very brillent picture. <br />Warning: This film contains Extremely Graphic Prolonged Brutal Violence including Strong language,Strong Drug Use,and some strong sexuality. You Have Been Warned About The Violence In The Film.
B00005LQ6S|4.0|...This is the only seqaul in the series that i liked.I think that this is almost as good as the first one because everything is almost the same,only flaw i see is to many flash backs.The only thing that keeps me from giving this movie 5 stars...
B00004XOWM|5.0|I thought it was spunkey and very cool
B00005QG9J|5.0|Who would have expected Incubus to release an incredible mix of mellow, chilled-out tunes with some funky rock music so perfectly?  From the funky to the orchestral, this is real music that beats the fine &quot;Make Yourself&quot;....by quite a lot.<br />1)Nice to Know You - 9/10   a great start to the album, starts off sounding like &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, but as soon as the chourus kicks in, you know it's not, but that's a good thing.  After a few listens, this song becomes even better!  <br />2)Circles - 9/10  sounds kind of like the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and fans of SCIENCE will enjoy this song a lot.<br />3)Wish You Were Here - 10/10  the first single is the first mellow song, but gets harder in the chours, with every listen it gets better!<br />4)Just a Phase - 10/10  asks the question, &quot;who are you&quot;....this song is incredible, it's build up is super sweet.  love the strings, too!<br />5)11 am - 9/10  an instant classic, fun lyrics....<br />6)Blood on the Ground - 9/10  whoa, this song is a loud, but melodic song that is intense....but listen it's more than just a cool song, lyrics are meaningful!<br />7)Mexico - 10/10  at first i didn't even like it that much, than I read &quot;you only think about yourself&quot; and listened along and it's now a favorite.......strongly recommended!<br />8)Warning! - 10/10  i smell a single in this amazing song!  again, it builds up, sounds mellow funky, and means something.<br />9)Echo - 10/10  a beatiful song, and brandon sounds, well, stellar!<br />10)Have You Ever.... - 10/10   it took a few listens for me, but it just sounds so cool!  it sounds kind of like hard Smashing Pumpkins....I can just see Billy Corgan singing this....great for letting anger out....<br />11)Are You In? - 10/10  possibly my favorite song Incubus has ever written, chill to the relaxing, layed back sounds that force me to dance!  Seriously, learn to love this track!  Simple, but amazing chourus and jazzy solo!  AHHH ITS SO GREAT!<br />12)Under My Umbrella - 10/10  a great song that could be a single.  took a few listens, but some great chords and lyrics. <br />13)Aqueous Transmission - 10/10  no, it doesn't sound like anything ever played by them....yes, it's a great thing.  One of the most haunting, yet peaceful songs I've ever experienced.  Truely amazing!<br />BOTTOM LINE:  It took some real balls to put this CD out, especially putting songs like Are You In? and Aqueous Transmission (my two favorites!) on this great, powerful recording.  Sounds great, I just hope that Incubus continues to make great music like this, and take leaps foward in the future....What they did here is take risks, and what came out is the best CD that's come out in quite some time!  Just, please buy it and keep listening, eventually you'll truely enjoy every song!<BR>P.S.Thanks, Incubus....please release any B-sides soon....
B00005Q45W|1.0|Leonard Cohen has never been a singer worth crossing the street to hear, but the lyrics hung on his deep, awkward voice were worth sitting in a rainstorm to hear! The vocals on TEN NEW SONGS are almost a parody on par with a bad Saturday Night Live sketch or - worse - Dustin Hoffman-esque from &quot;Ishtar.&quot; The lyrics are still some of the best in the business, but - Leonard - PLEASE - check your ego at the door, continue to WRITE, but leave the singing to other troubadors. I'm not suggesting selling out to Top 40 pin-up boy bands, but the alt-pop-folk scene has plenty of Leonard Cohen wanna-be's who can't come CLOSE to your lyrics, but have (like you did long ago) unique vocal talents that would - no doubt - give your TEN NEW SONGS a better treatment than your current vocal ability allows. Really - your vocal &quot;approach&quot; at this stage of your career seems to celebrate a lack of ANY appealing quality, thumbing its nose at melody and presentation. Put down the microphone, pick up the pen, and we'll keep listening. Your current approach buries the talent that you possess. If you're new to Cohen - pick up a &quot;Best Of&quot; CD and enjoy. Let's all wait for &quot;interesting&quot; (heck, CAPABLE) singers to cover TEN NEW SONGS before judging their worth.
630441403X|4.0|I really enjoyed it, it was very intense. Nicholas Cage had that part down pat.

B00000BKDY|2.0|The best thing about this dissappointing Maiden record is the cover, which contains a complete history of the band, up to that point. The record itself seemed to me to be an excuse to go on tour. Unfortunately, not one song stands out. I would pass on this one for the new Maiden fan, but the more hardcore may enjoy this one.
0780620003|1.0|If you're happy simply with big explosions in your movies, you'll like it, but if you want a decent plot look elsewhere. I thought this movie was terrible.
B00000BKDS|4.0|This Maiden record was great, and you can tell the band was hungry, putting out some great stuff. It appears that bands, when they lose their appetite, the stuff they put out is lacking the energy and magic. But this is NOT the case on this record! Phantom of the Opera is still one of my favorite songs, as well as Sanctuary and Remember Tommorow, and hell, the whole damn album! As a band, I think they were better with Paul Dianno, even though I think Dickenson is a superior singer. This is a definite recommendation for all Maiden fans!
B0000028P8|4.0|This is Mariah back in 1992, at the early stage of her career. Unfortunately there are only 7 songs on here totalling approximately 30 minutes, but then again this is an EP! Personally, I prefer her in an acoustic setting such as this, a lot better than with all the synths. Also of note on this album, is a cool cover of The Jackson Five's &quot;I'll be There.&quot; No Mariah Carey collection is complete without this album...don't be put off by the low number of songs.
0618001905|3.0|Great book, except with lots of details. I had to read this for college, so we got into most of the details, but it's a good book for insight into world history and slavery. Read this if you want to learn history in a casual and non-boring way!
0316776963|5.0|A word of caution: Do not, as I did, give this book as a gift to someone who has just had major abdominal surgery--They may have to be re-stitched.<br />I'm a Sedaris radio fan, and his essays are always insightful, clever and hysterically funny. The French lessons were hilarious, and glimpses into his family were also a scream. Sedaris can take the most mundane incident and spin it into a highly entertaining tale.<br />He also has a very humble, humane side that is really likable and sweet. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who needs cheering up.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The Beatles' &quot;1&quot; is the greatest collection of rock and roll tracks ever recorded, period. The track list tells all.
0446310786|2.0|This book was tremendouly slow, and most of the time boring. I mean no offence to the people who liked this book, but I personally thought it was a borig book. Maybe it's because I like to read books with more action. I did not like this book, it had too little action, and even the climax was not very exiting.
B00005R87Q|5.0|this is the best racing movie of all times, it's 10 times better than gone in 60 sec. this is a must see movie, it has everything a growing teen wants, sex, action, partys. It's the best
0380715430|1.0|It is unfortunate that Bill Bryson writes so entertainingly, because the book's content is disastrously bad.  The book is replete with elementary errors of fact.  Many of these can be detected with nothing more than a good dictionary: 'law' and 'order' are not synonyms, 'swarthy' is not from Latin 'sordere', and 'bumf' is not from a non-existent German 'bumfodden' but from the self-explanatory British 'bum-fodder' (toilet paper).  Others are equally elementary: for instance, the High German sound shift took place in the south of Germany, not the north.<br />He fares no better when he deals with more technical matters.  He loves to count inflectional forms of words in different languages, but most of his counts are wrong.  His history of the alphabet from Old to Present-Day English is riddled with errors of fact.  His treatment of the sounds of English is hopelessly confused because he fails completely to distinguish phones from phonemes; indeed, he seems to confuse at least one of these with the graphs used to represent them.  His discussion of the Great Vowel Shift, a fundamental change that explains many of the apparent oddities of modern English spelling, is partly wrong and wholly confusing.<br />Hard as it is to excuse such cavalier treatment of the facts, it is even harder to excuse his logical inconsistencies and muddy thinking.  On the one hand, 'To a baby no language is easier or more difficult than any other'; on the other, Old English was so complicated that '[i]t is a wonder that anyone ever learned to speak it'.  At one point he lists 'Celtic' as a European language that disappeared over time, and in the very next sentence he avers that 'Celtic ... is not dead'.  (He appears to have confused languages with language families.)  In comparing modern English spelling to that of Old English he applies a double standard in order to make modern spelling seem more arbitrary than it really is.  And one wonders what distinction between 'hair' and 'hairs' made inShakespeare's 'Shee hath more haire than wit, and more faults than hairs' is 'effectively lost to us today'.<br />But the errors are not the book's worst feature.  Bryson returns again and again to three themes: (1) English is in most respects superior to all other languages, partly because (2) complex inflectional systems are BAD, and (3) English spelling is almost completely chaotic.  He has moments of moderation in which he qualifies these assertions, even at one point denying the first altogether, but they are far less memorable than the polemics supporting them, and it is noteworthy that many of his errors and misleading statements reinforce these same themes.<br />Bryson's linguistic chauvinism is appalling.  The English range of sounds is 'pleasingly' diverse, but Anglo-French was 'harsh, clacking, guttural'.  'Italians cannot distinguish between a niece and a granddaughter'?  Of course they can.  And to say that the meaning of German 'Schadenfreude' 'perhaps tells us as much about Teutonic sensitivity as it does about their neologistic versatility' is simply insulting.  One is not greatly surprised to find that the index has an entry for 'English, advantages of' but none for 'English, disadvantages of'.  One can also discover that while foreign words and phrases are 'adopted' into English, English words and phrases are 'expropriated' into other tongues.<br />A reader searching for a readable elementary introduction to the history of the English language would be much better off with Charles Barber's _The English Language: A Historical Introduction_.
B00005MP58|1.0|What a shame that this wonderful film has been released with such a poor handling of color in the transfer!  Where on earth was quality control?  I've never seen anything so washed out!   I had been waiting some time for this Special Edition so that I could view Pride &amp; Prejudice in its widescreen format.  Don't waste your money unless you're sure these errors have been corrected.  I'm going to try to get my money back now.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I have been a long time fan of the weird and wonderful Michael Jackson. I have found his peculiar appearance and the slow change from cool pop idol to ridiculous freak compelling to see. I've been exhilarated, amazed, disturbed and sometimes laughed at him over the years but have never been bored with the guy's antics.<BR>But to focus on just the music and the dancing for a moment.... the man has always blown me away with amazing tunes, superb production and unbelievable dancing skill.<br />So it was, with some dissapointment, I sat listening to the new album yesterday. (It was broadcast on the web for 24 hours through the official site.)<BR>The production value was top notch. His voice is as good as ever. He also covers all the usual topics.... children, invasion of privacy, changing the world. <BR>But there was something missing this time out. Some songs sound like attempts to copy today's big pop acts rather than create new and unique sounds and rythms. '2000 Watts' sounds just like Destiny's Child.... 'Invincible' sounds like a Britney Spears track..... 'Whatever Happens' is a watered-down George Michael sound-a-like. <BR>Other tracks are just pale imitations of Michael's own classics. 'Threatened' is so obviously trying to be a new 'Thriller' but is a limp, tuneless version.... 'You Rock My World' has great harmonies but does the melody really compare with 'The Way You Make Me Feel'?<BR>I could go on but you get the idea. Big, big letdown. How this took six years and over 20 million to make is beyond me!!<br />But, there's a bright side. Albums like 'Bad' will forever be great. This has to be the best he's ever been.... an almost perfect album that reveals new subtleties with each listen. Just check out the amazing bass line on 'Speed Demon' or the driving beat of 'Leave me Alone'. And how about Stevie Wonder's duet on 'Just Good Friends', a song that radiates energy and a joy of music! I also have to mention 'Man In the Mirror' with it's beautiful and emotional lyrics. Far better than the egotistical 'Cry' on the new CD.<br />So, it you find yourself dissapointed in 'Invincible'.... go and pick up a copy of 'Bad' and just enjoy how good Michael can be.
014028009X|2.0|I'm annoyed that I spent $1 to reserve this at the library. I had to force myself to finish it. If this is the sort of character that young women today relate to, I fear for our gender. To say that Bridget is shallow, sophmoric and simplistic would be an understatement.<br />This book was supposed to be hilareous but I only managed a weak chuckle once near the end of the book. I gave it two stars because it is slightly better than the worst books I have ever read.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I absolutly love this DVD and this movie.  The extras are amazing.  If you are a hardcore Star Wars fan or even a small child you will enjoy this.  And of corse the movie itself is top notch.  One of the best movies since the classic trilogy.  If you buy it watch everything.  I did and even after 6 hours of extras I was left wanting more.  I cannot wait untill Attack of the Clones comes out.  And by the way I like that title and I like Jar Jar Binks so get off my back!  Peace, and may the force be with you!
B000007177|5.0|Leaving these songs out of their original albums in favor of some of the songs that got in boggles the mind.  Chateau D'Isaster stands on its own as a triumphant piece every bit as inspired as Passion Play.  There is a great deal of stylistic variation in this piece, from the magnificent &quot;Look At The Animals&quot;, which has become one of my all-time favorite tunes (surpassed only by Bouree...the version on &quot;A Little Light Music&quot; to the raucous and driving &quot;Left Right&quot;, which eases nicely into a more pleasing version of &quot;Only Solitaire&quot;.  The second CD is also glorious, with such polished gems as &quot;Man of Principle&quot; and &quot;Truck Stop Runner&quot;, two songs that are as different from each other as possible, yet delightful.  &quot;Rosa on the Factory Floor&quot; is reminiscent of many songs that Tull has done, in fact there seems to be one song just like it on pretty much every Tull album since &quot;Crest of A Knave&quot;'s &quot;Budapest&quot;.  &quot;Broadford Bazaar&quot; is a beautiful tune that will drag you in happily.  &quot;Piece of Cake&quot; seems to be yet another in a long line of foodish double-entendres, but entertaining nonetheless.  There is no reason not to go out right now and buy this magnificent piece of lost artistry.
B00000IMTE|5.0|This is the very beginning of Rainbow. Dio's singing has never been better. This proves that he had a soft side. He's not from hell. Ritchie Blackmore's playing is at his best. There's still a little leftover funk from Deep Purple, but there are some rare gems. Temple of the King, for instance. A very nice ballad. I love the instrumental from the Yardbirds. Classic. The only problem is that their isn't any long jams like on the 2nd album. Plus, some of the songs ramble on for a while. Catch the Rainbow should've ended around 4 and a half minutes, but instead, it's 6. Still, I can hear the power metal in the album. Nice playing from the keyboardist. I forgot his name. Very good debut.
B000002L9Y|5.0|This is the last full length studio album of Fleetwood Mac's put out in 1987. In my opinion it is the weakest one of all, but some of their strongest songs appear on the set. My favorite of all is definitely &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; which Stevie Nicks contributed. My favorite Mac song EVER!! The second highlight of this album, and I know I'm going against 99.9% of all people when I say this, is Lindsay Buckingham's &quot;Family Man.&quot; I can really relate to this song. Though it is very simple, it is very catchy and heartfelt. It should have gotten much higher than #90. I listen to it alot. The other highlights include &quot;Little Lies,&quot; and &quot;You and I Pt. II.&quot; All of the other songs are wonderful as well but don't match the songs that I have mentioned. This album is very diffrent from their 70's stuff. This one relies much more on synthesizers and sounds more computer generated. It's much more poppy you could say, but that doesn't stop it from being one of the best albums from the eighties. Buy it because you are missing out on something special if you don't!
B000056K04|5.0|Great CD.  Lot's of electric guitar which isn't the norm for DMB.  This CD is a change is style, but back to the great form of his Crush album.  A must buy for any DMB fan.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Some classic LC cuts, hooks, moods and themes. Nicely arranged. &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; very strong; &quot;Alexandra&quot; and &quot;The Land of Plenty&quot; are potential LC classics too.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Another great innovation from David Bowie! This album (to me) is his take on the New Romantic style. The combination drum machine and &quot;real drummer&quot; sounds really good. This is difinitely one of his more wordier albums.<br />The crown victoria of this album is Teenage Wild Life, with a glamesque guitar sound and a fast tempo it makes for a great little number. Everyone has heared &quot;Fashion&quot; it's  a wounderfuly saterical song directed at the fashion industry, and of course &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; is very insightful, and in the video Steve Strange from VISAGE makes a cameo. But I really think the B tracks keep this album together. &quot;Scary Monsters&quot;, &quot;Scream Like a Baby&quot;, &quot;It's No Game (Part I and II)&quot; are just as good (or better) than the A tracks. As sad as it might be my David Bowie collection stops at here.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I grew up watching the first Star Wars Trilogy, and like millions of people I couldn't wait to watch The Phantom Menace.  The special affects were definatly cool, but what happened to the story?  I was really unhappy that they took several characters from the original trilogy, and made them look like jokes.  For instance: Greedo, the Sand People, and mainly Anakin Skywalker.  I HATE it when a character saves the day by pure accident.  Anakin just happens to end up in the right spot at the right time, and accidently hits the right button that saves the Universe.  And don't even get me started with Jar-Jar Binks, the Pod Race Announcer, and Jar-Jar Binks clan leader.  Although the computerized characters were really cool to look at, sometimes it felt cartoonish, and I didn't feel like they meshed real well with the real actors.  I missed the way the characters were in Star Wars, like Chewbacca, and the various faces in the Mos Eisley's Canteena.  One of the cool things i loved about Star Wars in the first place is because I felt like I was in the movie, experiencing the adventures right along with Luke, Han and Leigh.  Their world didn't seem that different from mine, but Episode 1 just seems too fake and less REAL...and it doesn't take itself seriously at all.  I know there are a lot of Star Wars Fanatics out there grinding there teeth at my review, but please don't get me wrong, I love Star Wars and I loved certain scenes in this one, but It just didn't live up to any of my expectations.  Buy it anyway though...it's deffinatly EYE CANDY!!!
B00005QB9A|5.0|Perhaps one of the most cinematically beautiful, metaphorically rich, supurbly acted, and thought-provoking movies I have ever felt privileged to glimpse.  I say privileged, because one would have had to have been a sleuth to have known about it or seen it in its limited theatrical release. It is criminal that the studios lack the vision to back these rare gems they keep burying in the sand. <BR>Spend whatever, do whatever to find a copy and consider yourself<BR>the richer for it.
074322454X|5.0|If you are unable to watch the HBO miniseries, read this book.  In fact, read it even if you are able to watch it!  I won't re-iterate the storyline as it is well covered in this and other fora.  The book fills in the empty spaces that are inherent in any TV screenplay of a book.  In doing so it adds to your understanding and enjoyment of the TV version.  You'll be glad you did it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I liked tis album for the exact reason that I hear people criticizing it: it's simple.  I don't find myself wondering if the secrets of the universe are hidden somewhere in the lyrics.  It's catchy, cool and they got beats!  A collaboration of many cool artists (Miho Hatori, Damon Albarn, Del Tha Funky Homosapien and more), this disc is put together much more smoothly than a lot of the &quot;guest fest&quot; albums that are popping up everywhere.  This album has songs that you won't mind having stuck in your head all day!
6303477259|5.0|SPEECHLESS IS HOW I FELT AFTER WATCHING THE MOST SPECTACULAR CONCERT THAT MY EYES HAVE EVER SEEN!  EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ON VIDEO<BR>IT WAS LIKE I WAS REALLY THERE.  I REALLY DONT KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THE FEELING I GOT WHEN WATCHING IT BUT IT TOOK ME INTO ANOTHER WORLD!  DAVID'S LYRICAL GUITAR PLAYING WAS LIKE WATCHING SOMEONE THAT WASN'T HUMAN PERFORM!!! ALSO THE AMAZING LASER AND PICTURE SHOW WAS UNREAL!!! I THINK I COULD WATCH IT OVER AND OVER A ZILLION TIMES!!!<BR>AS MUCH I LOVE PINK FLOYD I CANT BELIEVE IT HAS TAKEN ME THIS LONG TO WATCH THS VIDEO! I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WHO LOVES FLOYD AS I DO! I FELL IN LOVE WITHOUT A DOUBT!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|this is an awesome great movie.. I saw it right after I lost my dad.. it really help me in that time...it really DID see this movie and buy it!<BR>I know in just some of the reviews some people did't like it and to those who did't like it I have this to said to them...<BR>maybe you just did't lose someone you love will all your heart, This world is full of pain and sorrow.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I'm not going to bother rating all the songs out of 3, 5, 10, or stuff I've seen others do. But I will include a brief description of them:<br />Affirmation: About, you guessed it, affirmations. Quite a positive song and good beat, although it may be better to listen to the words than the beat.<br />Hold Me: Not as strong a song in my opinion but a good ballad about a guy who just needs something good in his life. Quite beautiful.<br />I Knew I Loved You: A sweet song (think slow dance) about his feeling for his loved one. Actually has CREATIVE lyrics (something many slow songs lack). You won't like it if you don't like slow songs, but if you do, you will.<br />The Best Thing: I don't know why they placed it here inbetween two slow songs. Good words and even beat but I don't like the instruments it's played with. At least not the opening chord. Past that it's not bad.<br />Crash And Burn: The story of my life. My favorite song on this album and just in general. It's saying that if your feel you are all alone and your life is tough, then you aren't alone. I like the fact that this song can apply to ANYTHING in life, not just romance. I could never say enough about this song. It's perfect in my mind. Not as slow as #3. Never gets old.<br />Chained To You: Another unusual location for a fast song. But it rocks. About desire and lust (hence the title) about a girl. Great beat.<br />The Animal Song: I think the intro is annoying, maybe that's just because I hate bongo drums. That's OK, though. The rest of the song is pretty cool about escaping from the crazy everyday life. <br />The Lover After Me: A very sad, slow, beautiful song about a guy not being able to move on from his ex. I like the second verse (I have given mine away to a world / That didn't want it anyway...) Think the opposite of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; by Alanis Morissette. (It's a great song too, though).<br />Two Beds And A Coffee Machine: No drums in this song. About a woman in an abusive relationship who's looking for a light at the end of the road. Good piano and very deep song. Not very light-hearted.<br />You Can Still Be Free: Not a favorite of mine. In fact, none of the following songs are. But I've heard some good things about this song. Decide for yourself.<br />Gunning Down Romance: Not my thing, and I'd review it fairly except I haven't heard it very much. I think it's the worst song on the CD. But again, decide for yourself.<br />I Don't Know You Anymore: Quite pretty. The name suggests the theme of the song. I haven't heard it very much, though, so I won't say much more. But it does tend to grow on you.<br />Well, that's the CD. I don't like it when people compare it to NSync or Backstreet Boys because it is not the same thing. And the fact that I don't listen to either of them doesn't have anything to do with it. I listen to many different kinds of music and this is not a closed-minded pop stereotype at all. Some people say it's better than the first CD, some say worse. It's just different. I like them both. Decide for yourself. Both are essential, though, to complete your CD library :o).
B000002IJL|5.0|This soundtrack is one of the best i have ever heard! I am in my early teen years, but i consider Stand By Me the BEST movie ever made. it shows good time fun, and growing up as kids. The soundtrack brings this movie back to life, and makes you want to relive the movie over and over again. It is a must have for all Stand By Me lovers...you won't be the same without it...:)
B00005NWRS|5.0|At first I was a little worried about buying this cd because I felt that the backwards american flag might be deemed &quot;unpatriotic&quot; in light of the tradgedy. But I thought it over and came to the conclusion that the unfortunite cd cover was printed well before September and the quality of his music is unsurpassed. <br />I was introduced to Ryan Adams music from a friend over the summer (who is a bob dylan freak) and I fell in love with his style. His lyrics are amazing, the songs are fun to listen to, to play, to sing along to. <br />It is also very Ironic that New York New York is his first song on the cd, which was released right after the tradgedy. It is truely a great song, and a good tribute to New York City. - &quot;I'll still love you New York&quot; - If you are considering buying this cd buy it for New York New York.<br />The Rescue Blues is another Amazing song, Probably my favorite on the cd. Its got a pretty cool electric guitar riff in it (reh reo roo roo reu roo rweeew rweew reew) and the lyrics are awesome. <br />&quot;Silvia Path&quot; is a good slow song with some good piano in it.<br />Overall Ryan adams new cd is a great buy. I'd highly recommend it to about anyone of any age.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie is so good.  And it is so cool.  In fact, it is the epitome of cool.  It is great right from the beginning, Travolta's monologue is great.  It is said at the beginning of movies:  theyre a moral dilemma, bad guy cant win.  But then Travolta gets away with everything.  But that gets you thinking, then if the bad guy cant win, is he really the bad guy?  I think he's not.  He's protecting the U.S.  This movie also has great special effects,  the 360 pan around explosion is the BEST EXPLOSION EVER in a movie.  The plot is good, and the finale is just so cool, its unbelievable.  The music is good to, Ive preordered my copy already.  Anybody who doesnt like this movie obviously cant understand great cinema even when it hits em in the face.<br /> questions? send me your ranting and raving at solidsnake552@aol.com
B00005B3Z6|4.0|Not having been taken in by the promotion and hype of this UK series, I had to know what all the fuss was about so I bought the first season on DVD, only to find a presentation which was, to put it nicely, a harsh stereotypical and unrealistic perspective of Gay lifesyle, even though it may only be a small percentage of the community it was enough to leave a bad taste in my mouth. <BR>The show itself was very well put together dealing with issues such as coming out, single parenting and drugs but I think the pulling card will by the extremely graphic sex scenes with underage boys.<br />Despite the illusion of a perfect gay world which centers around one street in Manchester, this series does pull you in, shake you up and take you shopping.<BR>Looking forward to the next season and it's a great addition to the collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus is just plain awesome. They're music is great. It is obvious that this band's greatest strenght is their lyrics. With phrases like &quot;Maybe we'll meet again further down the river and share what we discover, then revel at the view&quot; and &quot; Im earning my right to silence. In quiet discerning between ego and timing&quot;. &quot;Morning view&quot; is equally good as &quot;Make Yourself&quot;. So fans of their 3rd cd will not be disappointed. Also check out their other two or three. Incubus definitely have a sound of their own.
B00005Q45W|3.0|Leonard Cohen is a legend beyond any critic.<br />A real poet i believe more than a mucisian.In all his works he offers more and more fresh air from a real thinking man who experiences life in his own unique way and has the ability to sing it.<br />It is a cd that you have to buy if you respect your collection.
B00005QG9J|5.0|when my friend got me into incubus, i was afraid of what i had deemed &quot;hard rock.&quot;  but incubus transcends that label.  their lyrics are intelligent and honest (my most important qualification for a great artist or album).  their guitar rifts are new and coarsing.  their DJ adds incredible depth to all the songs he touches.  the highs and the lows of &quot;Morning View&quot; are well placed and display the range and quality of incubus as a group of young musicians.  if you are a true fan of incubus from &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; to &quot;Make Yourself,&quot; you will see the growth and the amazing talent in the varied and ecclectic sounds of incubus' latest product.  thanks to brandon, michael, dirk, chris, and jose for being true to their genius.
0789723107|5.0|Great job, Mr. Krug - I anxiously await your next book!<br />It's a welcome relief after reading some downers. I find it ironic that authors for web usability seldom apply their observations to their books; this author avoids that trap. <br />Pros: brief, to the point, and illustrated, fabulous use of humor.<BR>Cons: none I can think of right now.
B00005QG9J|5.0|I couldn't agree more with the editorial review of &quot;Morning View.&quot;  Finally, a reviewer who understands and appreciates incubus.  This album is more subtle than their last effort &quot;Make Yourself,&quot; but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.  incubus, as always, displays their intelligence through their lyrics and through their varied instrumentation.  this album will be lost of lovers of pop-rock because of the number of songs that are not uptempo and angry (though there is sufficient angst for true incubus fans).  it's hard to believe they are only in their early 20s, but if you've been listening since &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot; than you can appreciate how their sound has grown.  incubus has range and depth that separates them from other new-metal bands and that it is fully displayed through &quot;morning view.&quot;
B00003CXPD|5.0|humourous, inspirational and touching.  an emotional and powerful journey that is both familiar and haunting to humankind. Only the light of faith, love and honesty can guide us through the darkness.
B000002H6C|5.0|Metallica's 1988 album &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; is a compelling and energetic musical outlook into the demise of the American Dream. Songs like &quot;Eye of the Beholder&quot;, &quot;Harvester of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;The Shortest Straw&quot;, and &quot;...And Justice For All&quot; delve into the problems of the American government and how it destroys the fabric of society and blackmails it's citizens into silence. The legendary song &quot;One&quot; is a dark, tense anti-war song about a soldier who has lost all of his limbs and cannot speak, hear, or see. It will make the most staunch war supporter think twice before advocating war. On this album, no establishment is left uncriticized. &quot;Dyers Eve&quot; is an extremely fast and heavy suicide note from a boy to his parents. Each pleaful stanza begins with the lines &quot;Dear Mother, dear Father.&quot; No two songs on this album sound alike, and all have an extremely deep meaning that the listener can think about for quite sometime. This album finds Metallica at the top of their musicianship. Not one note is out of place and Kirk Hammet's guitar solos are amazing. &quot;Guitar World&quot; ranked the guitar solo in &quot;One&quot; as the 8th best guitar solo ever. The result of the lyrics and musicianship is an epic album that both Metallica die hards and music lovers cherish.
B000053VHO|5.0|I thought this was excellent. I was at the first show and it was<BR>the best i ever saw Jimmy play in a long time and you know this<BR>by hearing me in the crowd. Many people agree! The Black Crows<BR>were a very good back up  for Jimmy almost all of the Zep songs I thought were great. After I found out they released these songs<BR>from the show I was at, I quickly bought the CD and listened.<BR>Again, it sounded fantastic when listening and even more sensational when I heard myself all over the CD. The Zep songs played were remarkably good you might not even notice the missing<BR>Zep band members.Have not heard it yet buy it you ll see and listen for me in audience.
B00003CXXI|3.0|SHREK has some appealing moments. It also has some nice things to say about how society focuses too much on external beauty and not enough about a person's soul. Unfortunately, a lot of the film's inherent charm is diminished by the crude way in which it is handled. This is really a shame, because the film could have been so much more.<br />Apparently, studio executives dread the &quot;G&quot; rating like the plague. Instead, they insert unnecessary scatological humor to &quot;beef up&quot; the rating. Hopefully, this pattern will change, but it doesn't appear likely.<br />In short, you might want to keep the little kids away from this one. It might pass for older kids and teenagers, but you might want to consider other alternatives first. If in doubt, pre-screen the film first.
B000002HIK|5.0|If I had known how good this was, I would have bought it ages ago.  I used to be afraid of Aphex Twin, I didn't like it when things mades my head hurt, when I could tangibly feel sounds moving around in my skull, when I didn't want my ideas of beauty, form, MUSIC challenged by the things I listened to.  How we shed our childish ways.  <BR>This is an incredible album (and I only just bought it, have only heard four tracks.  If it ended now I would be perfectly happy, but it keeps going!!!!!)  I am astounded at the complexity of this work, the beauty of these alien sounds.  I can't wait for this to keep going, I can't wait to explore this album.  Being a big IDM fan, I have a lot of freaky CDs, but the joy of what I'm hearin right now, the newness of every beat is rare indeed.  I feel excited, lucky to be where I'm at, hearing this for the first time.  You probably will be too.
6303022901|4.0|I read &quot;Joy Luck Club&quot;. I thought about relationship of mother and me. It's a difficult topic, but also very important.<BR>There are various opinions.Since it's only one mother,I want to trasure her.
0441172717|5.0|The whole setting of the book is a vessel in which to allow many concepts to be raised, but it surpasses this meagre limitation into much more.  I have read the series of 6 three times over, now either I am very sad man, or this is a bit of a good book.  The first book is almost undoubtably the best in the series, however once you get past children of Dune (the beginning is a little long) and into the realms of the Bene Gesserit in the last two the completion of the many aspects is obtained.  Beware however, intensive reading of this can be detremental to your outlook on life, the whole series takes a perspective set apart from the selfish personal view and instead highlights global thinking, thoughts for the good of humanity with little significance placed on the value of the individual in comparison.
6303921248|5.0|I just watched the last of the tapes yesterday (twice) and it left me wanting more. I was dying to know how Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's married life would be like. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle embody the characters like no other actors could. It was a wonderful production -- with a talented supporting cast. I picked up my old copy of Pride &amp; Prejudice and read along in various scenes. The fact that there are 6 tapes does allow you to have your favourite tape, as another reviewer mentioned. Mine is the one where Elizabeth goes to Pemberly with her aunt and uncle, followed by the 6th tape, where everything is resolved. Colin Firth is the perfect Mr. Darcy -- with those expressive, penetrating eyes. I am glad that we were allowed to see more of his character and also see how Elizabeth (Lizzie) gradually began to fall in love with him. If you haven't seen Bridget Jones's Diary, watch it. Colin Firth reprises his Mr. Darcy character. I hadn't been a fan of him before, but now I am wholeheartedly.<br />I know I will watch my Pride &amp; Prejudice tapes over and over again. Too bad there aren't more Mr. Darcys in the world...
B000056VJ7|4.0|Blasting out lyrics that are based on cliche and teenage angst, Meatloaf and Steinman combined to make the perfect album for the 70's teen. It was about sex and...I'm not really sure what else. From Richard Corben's Heavy Metal (the Magazine)cover, to Roy Bittan's putting a little E-Street sound on some of the tunes, this CD was a combination of unlikely events that ended up becoming a representative album for the young male of the 70's, living through songs like &quot;Paradise By The Dashboard Light&quot; (or wishing they could)and &quot;All Revved Up With No Place To Go&quot; and thinking that Steinman's lyrics pretty much summed up the way things were. Does it hold up? Depends on how you look at it. I smile when I hear the songs and don't try to make it more than it is, a teenage dream.
B00003CX8I|3.0|Overall, this was a good movie, considering what they tried to do.  Compiling years of comic books into one movie and having it make sense is something that even the worlds greatest writers and directors can't accomplish without a few flaws.  Die-hard comic book fans will immediatly recognize every error (and there are many), which spoils the movie for this (very large) percentage of the movie watchers.  For the rest of you, the movie is a great show of special effects, and does a resonable job of showing what the X-men are, given the time restraints.
B00000JNJ1|4.0|What great talent! Rod Stewart, Ronnie Wood, Ronnie Lane, Ian McLaglin, and Kenny Jones, all talented performers, who created for a short while, the world's greatest bar band. Rocking hard and playing loosely this band just seemed to throw things together and hope for the best. Not just a back up band for Stewart, Faces created music for a Saturday night, out on the town, hitting the clubs, and having a real good time doing it. Listening to songs like \\"Cindy Incidentally,\\" \\"Pool Hall Richard\\" and \\"Borstal Boys,\\" you can hear the skill of the band, but Faces always seemed to be more about having fun. This collection is more complete than Snakes and Ladders and you will be hard pressed to find a band that better epitomizes the swagger of good old-fashioned rock and roll. There are many bands that have created more memorable music, but few that sound like they are having more fun doing it.
B00003CXE7|5.0|What can I say, another powerhouse performance from Russell Crowe, with Riddley Scott putting together a great story and directing, it doesn't get much better than this.
B000002OMN|3.0|Bat Out of Hell II is basically the album that Steinman and Meatloaf would have made had they not fallen out after their original collaboration. Most of the tunes appeared on Steinman's solo effort Bad for Good, which makes this basically a re-recording of that effort, or if you would rather, the album that should have been made in the first place. Either way it sounds dated and while Meatloaf is in fine voice, it's a shame that instrument couldn't be put to better use. Still it's a fun little CD, and if you liked the first one there's really no reason you won't like this one.
0385486804|5.0|The first book that I read by Jon Krakauer was Into Thin Air, also an excellent book. After reading that book in just a day or two, I immediately ordered Into the Wild, and was not disappointed. Into the Wild is one of those great books, not only is it a exciting piece of outdoor/adventure literature, but it is very entertaining and has a familiar and realistic foundation. This is also an account of a sad, sad event.  I am not an overly emotional person, but this author has seemingly found my soft spot twice. This is one of those books that you loan out to five different people before loosing track of it and are happy to have it in circulation amongst friends and family. A great read, and highly recommended.
6304712936|5.0|I bought this movie without ever seeing it before and I love it.  I don't know which parts are exactly true or not, but it was entertaining.  Mozart being portraid as a whiny brat with a goofy laugh was hilarious.  The thing I didn't like was having to flip over the disk,  it interrupted the flow of the movie.  <BR>I see why this move won an oscar.  It is enjoyable...whether you belive the story or not.

B00005B4GU|5.0|&quot;Pyramid Song&quot; is excellent. &quot;You and Whose Army&quot; is another favorite of mine. They are unlike anything popular today that i know of. They aren't superior to other singers, just different and fresh. It's the best c.d. I have by Radiohead. The tracks are tight and flow well together. Radiohead, I love you.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|For those of you interested in digital animation, this is a feast for your eyes. You will forget, often, during the movie that is IS cgi. Being much more than pure &quot;eye-candy&quot;, the wit and wisdom of this ultra-modern forum for presenting a classic fairytale takes you on a wonderful adventure. <BR>There is no flaw to be found in the animators' strive to bring the voice actors expressions and emotions to every word of dialouge, you really get every nuance. You will laugh again, and again at this witty and beautiful movie. There are several extra features packed onto the 2 disc set, enough to keep children AND adults entertained long after the movie has ended. <BR>The only thing questionable about this edition is that the feature does appear on BOTH discs, disc one is Pan &amp; Scan (4:3) and in DDS only, and disc 2 has the Widescreen (16:9 enhanced) in DTS also. This nugget of info seemed to be a secret I did not discover until after watching (to my 16:9 tv's dismay) disc one, and viewing the extras on Disc 2. <BR>Over all an excellent edition of an excellent movie, and a great addition to any DVD collection.
B000002UV9|5.0|I've got a large, eclectic collection of music (600 - 700 CD's - but who's counting?) and this is one of my favorites.  The lyrics are creative and the music is fantastic.  The drummer is nothing short of amazing.  It definitely is an outstanding example of its genre and is a testament to the talent of this band.
6303921248|5.0|While not exactly true to the book the spirit of the book is there &amp; very well done. The humor &amp; wit of Austen seems understood &amp; portrayed to the fullest. I watch this movie over &amp; over again it is a movie &quot;without fault&quot;, the characters are wonderful &amp; a joy to watch.
B00005B36H|5.0|For every great band, there is a watershed album where the progressive evolution of the music invariably causes a certain percentage of the fan base to leave forever.<BR> <br />For Tool, Lateralus is just such an album.<BR> <br />While Aenima was a wonderfully brooding &amp; cynical tale of woe, Lateralus is, overall, positive, insightful, and in many of its songs, dares to hint at the spiritual underpinning of reality. For many fans who have followed Tool's aggressive and &quot;dark&quot; music over the years, these songs may come as a shock, may even disappoint in fact (and I would venture a guess that is the main reason for the very few less-then-enthusiastic reviews). But as with all things, change is inevitable, and the same fans who loved Opiate have hopefully grown up and changed enough themselves to appreciate such a complex offering as this. <BR><br />This album, like those before it, is musically complex, lyrically progressive, vocally hypnotic, and overall, very much in the vanguard. If you are new to Tool, and in the past have shyed away because of their dark reputation, I invite you to take a listen. This album only confirms the obvious; Tool is the Pink Floyd of this generation, venturing where few others dare to tread, and stimulating the imagination of those who are willing to listen and ready to understand. <BR>
B00003CXRM|3.0|This movie is loosely based on the Homer Odyssey and centers around three escaped convicts in the south during the depression. One of the convicts (George Clooney) has escaped to stop his wife from marrying another man. He persuaded the other two convicts to follow along with him promising them hidden loot from a heist. The movie has its high and low points but never fully engages the audience. There are a few memorable scenes such as the Sirens and the flood scene. The music really is a big part of this movie and sets the tone. It is an older style Deep South country style that will not appeal to all and if you do not like the music you will not like the movie since the music is an integral part of the movie. After viewing this movie it left me with a neutral feeling. I did not despise it nor was I crazy about it. The video transfer is an excellent 2:35 Anamorphic transfer that shows no signs of edge enhancement. The colors are clean and crisp even in the darker scenes. The Audio track options are DTS 5.1, Dolby 5.1, and Dolby 2.0. The DTS track being the best with good channel separation and dialog focused on the center channel.
B00004YKUY|3.0|Seeing VH1's &quot;Behind the Music&quot; prompted me to buy this album. Yes, Steve Augeri sounds like Steve Perry. But it seemed like an impressionist doing an imitation of Perry. Now Journey sounds like a tribute band to itself. They sound more or less the same, but I come away without that feeling that I used to get (and still do) from their other albums. I would recommend &quot;Trial by Fire&quot; over this any day.
B0000508U6|5.0|A trusted friend from England gave me the heads up on these guys a while before they were released in the US. Boy was I ever grateful to her!<br />This is one of the most melodic and peaceful albums I've heard in a long time. The most refreshing aspect to this group is the originality. Each track has it's own highlighted feature. Sometimes the blend of vocal and instrument stands out, and on other tracks the instruments themselve to have a voice of their own. The first track released as a single, &quot;Yellow&quot;, hooked me onto the group immediately. The lead vocalist has a distinct sound and this was one of the tracks where all aspects seemed to blend. After buying the album other tracks soon grew on me. &quot;Trouble&quot;'s piano is just incredible. Having played piano for 14 years I absolute love piano and can pick it out on any track.<br />Parachutes has an almost permanent home in my CD changer. It has so many levels and aspects to it, it can be music for any mood and is just incredibly beautiful. BUY IT you won't be disappointed!!!
B00005221L|3.0|The sequel to this movie proves the point that this movie got the setting right in having the alien predator hunt in the forests of earth. While somewhat lacking in genuine plot and acting, this movie does not pretend to be anything else other than a macho flick with mountains of muscle and great weaponry. That is why this film works so well!<br />The concept of the alien itself should never have been taken out of the jungle (ref. the sequel) - for here the Predator is in his element, as ultimately, he is a game hunter looking for sport. <br />A punchy soundtrack, and taut direction by MacTiernan make this movie a tense piece of action. This film is full of memorable action and ho-hum dialogue - but it works. The film doesn't miss a beat once the tempo picks up. On the whole it is a well-conceived, well executed action/thriller. <br />MacTiernan knew the limits of the film's concept and the actors he worked with, and squeezed them for everything they were worth. Someone like Donner at the helm probably would have made a mess of this movie, whereas MacTiernan demonstrates real class, following it up with arguably the best action movie of contemporary film-making - Die Hard.<br />Solid film-making which did not try to do too much!
B00004TJLD|4.0|...The ingenuity and rock timeliness of Parsons comes through with pristine studio clarity and definition. Electronic music has a good companion in the electro mediums of CD and DVD.
B00003CX5P|5.0|A great addition to what is already  an excellent series. The extras on the disc are great also, enjoy!!!
B00000JKH2|5.0|This 7 track EP is At the Drive-in at their best. It has a much warmer sound than the follow up to this record (Relationship of Command), and the lyrics and vocal delivery of the first track (Rascuache) really blew me away. It took me a while to get into this record, but it was worth the effort. The thing i really like about this band is the way they always try and innovate in their guitar playing and create the most original and inspiring melodies. Atd-i are a great band and this along with Relationship of Command are two of the best emo-punk records released in years. Highly reccomended.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This cd is simply incredible. I fell in love with Make Yourself, but Morning View is twice as good. A definite more relaxed, and mature sound. But the lyrics along with the wonderful music, just all comes together. The other songs make &quot;Wish you were here&quot; seem like nothing but a advertisement. #13, and #8 will stick in your head for months. &quot;Mexico&quot; is greatly written and orginal. I can't begin to explain how good it is, but if you give it a  listen, I am sure enough you won't be dissapointed. Albumn of the year in 2002.
079284209X|4.0|The beauty of this thriller (bordering on noir/action masterpiece) is that gray area behind each charachter... we find ourselves liking Sam (DeNiro) because of his simple, down-to-earth personality and, of course, it's DeNiro, and the entire film is a web of questions asking who these people are and what is in the case that weavs itself around the spectacular action...  It's realistic, much like those spy thrillers of years past and unlike recent 007 ventures (sorry Bond, love ya, but no one needs two of you).  So we take the ride with Sam et al and at the end come out with not much more than we entered with... except sweaty palms and our fingers gripping our armrests...
B000002OVJ|5.0|This disc is an absolute sonic and musical feast.  Definately the best Who album ever, chock full of exciting guitar tones and virtuoso playing from drummer Keith Moon, bassist John Entwhistle, and guitarist Pete Townsend.  This recording quality is simply warm, warm, warm.....sounds unbelievable for something from 1970!  If you like high energy rock music, this is truly unbeatable.  I believe punkers would even dig this, as this recording has all the energy of punk, except these guys have chops and are technically proficient.  Also at this price, it's a steal!  Highly recommended.
B00005O3VC|5.0|When I first bought a DVD player, I bought this as my first DVD. I had never really seen this movie before, only bits and pieces. I really enjoyed this hilarious movie, let alone the extra features(about 25 of them).  After watching the movie, I played with all of these.  There are a few &quot;documentaries,&quot; and many extra pictures and drawings.  My favorite features were the theatrical trailers and &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail In Lego.&quot;  &quot;GET ON WITH IT!&quot; Try not to laugh as you watch these extras.  Even if you have another version of &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail,&quot; I suggest you buy this double-disc delight.  &quot;Ni! Ni!&quot;
B00005221L|5.0|Like &quot;Alien&quot; before it this film has a seven crew team that is hunted &amp; eliminated, Arnold is great here as a leader of highly trained special forces unit, that get caught up in all kinds of mishaps (CIA double-crossings,unseen stalker) They are constantly watched by this unseen enemy, Jesse Ventura gives a memorable performance, Sonny Landham (48HRS.) gives a good performance as a tracker who senses the Predator &amp; Carl Weathers gives a good performance as Arnold's advesary, but the best part in this film has to be the showdown between Arnold &amp; the Predator, that starts off like a wresting match, the only movie that has Arnold getting his a** kicked, this was also directed by John McTiernan, a year before &quot;Die Hard&quot; , definately a man's movie, &amp; probably one of Arnold's better movies.
0446677450|4.0|&quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; is always one of the first books I recommend to my financial planning clients.  By contrasting the financial principles he was taught by his rich dad to those of his poor dad, Kiyosaki manages to teach his reader the secrets of effective money management in an easy to understand and entertaining manner.  Although Kiyosaki does make several specific recommendations, his primary emphasis is on general principles of creating wealth rather than the &quot;how-to&quot; approach of other books.  The book also offers a large motivational benefit for anyone with an entrepreneurial interest.  The one flaw in this book is that Kiyosaki advocates a relatively high-risk approach to money management that may not be suitable for every reader.
B000000OUJ|5.0|Well fellow hip hop heads, we just set our clocks back an hour for the fall, so naturally its time to break out probably the best album the defines a season in hip hop history!  Thats right, I'm talkin about liquid swords, one of the illest, darkest, and most serious albums ever.  This album will get you thru the cold world (approprietly titled).  Every song is well crafted and strategically placed to offer the perfect flow.  There are too many jems on this album to list, but you could bascially say every song is classic.  The RZA's best masterpiece of grimey production is shown here, along with the sharpest sword in the clan lacerating necks just like on the cover.  In addition, the creative elements are bar none.  Who ever put a song together like &quot;Labels&quot; before?  And the samples from kung fu fliks like &quot;Showgun assassin&quot; are amazing.  The album starts with a scene where the kid is talking about his fathers assassin skills then goes directly into the title cut, Liquid swords.  Duel of the iron mic has such a dark and ill beat, with classic Ol' dirty on the hook.  &quot;Picture blood baths in elevator shafts&quot;.  The CD only gets better with every song.  Meth drops maybe one of his illest verses while he trades with GZA.  &quot;Peep the GRAFFIX, power from the geini bottle, hit the clutch it be on now full throttle&quot;  It went over many peoples heads what he was talkin about, but those who induldge in the greenery grasped it immedietly.  I can't talk about every song, but just know, this is a HIP HOP albut you MUST HAVE, straight up and down with no perservatives!  The album closes out with Killah Priest's B.I.B.L.E, which is one of the illest songs in history!  If you don't have this album, somethin must be wrong with you.  Go get the medicine (this album) and get better!
B00004XMSN|5.0|This is one of the classics of Christmas videos. Cary Grant is at his very best as the angel who comes to assist the Bishop (David Niven) who has prayed (for a great cathedral, he thinks, for guidance, according to the angel) only to find that God works in mysterious ways. The acting is supreme and one can find more and more to enjoy in this film the more one watches it. Loretta Young is the Bishop's Wife - thus the title of the film. The charismatic angel performs small miracles as he interacts with this small group of flawed human beings, unbeknownst to them.  One of the best parts occurs when Dudley (the angel) and Julia (the wife) must attend a choir performance given by the boys who still attend the neglected poor parish church. Under the guidance of Dudley, the boys sing with all their hearts and it is truly inspiring! There's a twist at the end, leaving all without having ever known that an angel has visited them. They seem perplexed and a little saddened at his leaving although they do not know why they feel this way. The audience feels sad also - to see such a great movie end. One of my all time favorites for Christmas with wonderful family values.
B00003CXX8|4.0|Despite the reviews this movie got, The Glass House was very entertaining. It had a lot of creepy and stylish sequences. It just proves that you can really have a scary movie without all of the blood and guts. <br />The cast (including Leelee Sobieski, Diane Lane, Stellan Skarsgard, Bruce Dern, Rita Wilson, and young Trevor Morgan) is top-notch. The music score by Christopher Young is perfect. Also, the direction and production design were both utterly beautiful, to say the least.<br />Congrats to the director, cast, and crew for a solid thriller!
0451191153|5.0|Since every positive aspect of this book has been written about by the hundreds of others who reviewed it, my review will be in response to its critics.  The one &quot;flaw&quot; that I read in the review over and over again was that &quot;it wouldn't work in real life.&quot;  This is true, to a point.  If one is to accept that the world is how it is generally perceived, and to live one's life in accordance with this perception, then yes, I suppose the book is flawed.  But, the point of the book, which I believe its critics miss, is that the world is how you make it.  If you choose to believe that Objectivism is fatally flawed and can never work, then Objectivism is fatally flawed and can never work.  But, if one is to live one's life completely within the bounds of the philosophy, you would be surprised at how often it does indeed work.  So, bottomline: read the book, take its lessons to your heart, live your life by them, and you will succeed in what you are going for.  But, if you carry the defeatist attitude that it is impossible to do so, guess what, it will be.
0060392886|5.0|I'm not the biggest metalhead out there...that '80's &quot;hair band&quot; scene really didn't do much for me, though I do own 2 Crue CD's.  But the great thing about this book is that you don't have to appreciate Motley Crue's music (or anyone else's, really) to be completely blown away by the full frontal assault on the senses that these guys have felt the need to relay our way.<br />&gt;<br />It is an amazing look at the runaway train that was arguably the best heavy metal band of the 1980's.  The successes, the excesses, and the incalculable Faustian prices paid by each bandmate for them.  At times hilarious, shocking, and heartbreaking, the Crue come off as more than the mindless hedonists they were always (if not completely inaccurately) portrayed as being on MTV and the various music publications of yore; they allow their personalities to flow off the pages and as a result you start to see their respective individual characteristics and wonder how they were able to play together for so long without killing each other, if not themselves.<br />&gt;<br />In short, if you enjoyed the Led Zeppelin biography &quot;Hammer of the Gods&quot;, this one will take the shock factor up a notch or two...I read most of it on a plane flight from Atlanta to Salt Lake City and back...it's a total page-turner, and a monument to what heavy metal music is, was, and will always be about.
B00003CXXI|5.0|I thought this movie was adorable! I think that everyone will like it no matter what age! It has a little bit of grown-up humor but still is good for small children. You have to see this movie! I really think that it will make almost everyone laugh.
6304493681|5.0|this is the second most peice of anime that i like.  the action here is terrific and the blood actually looks real, but the bad thing is that it didnt even look like a nude woman at some points the graphics were very dull and light and the eyes were real fake but at ONLY SOME times. other than those small &quot;defects&quot; the movie is perfect
0790729350|1.0|I was expecting a musical DVD, not a history of Woodstock.  <BR>This was advertised as featuring Creedence Clearwater Revival,<BR>They were not on this film.
6305014140|5.0|this is the video that got me into anime but it looks like all the rest of the anime is down hill from here. there is not one anime movie that i saw that surpases this one, it includes everything anime needs comedy, action, and sexuality that one rape scene may be alittle iffy but that was just to set the stage, theres nothing else but nudity after that if you are just getting in to anime you should get this one i have nothing but good things to say about ninja scroll note this anime is not for kids contains violence strong language and sexuality
0792156684|1.0|This movie was barely able to muster any kind of sympathy from me for the main characters.  I would have been more entertained sitting at home watching  reruns of News Radio.
B00005ATQD|1.0|This movie really didn't have much going for it.  Nichole Kidman and particularly Tom Cruise aren't very talented actors.  This is made worse by bland and unrealistic dialogue.  The plot can be summarized in a sentence.  And by the advertising campaign, you think there would at least be some vicarious thrill of seeing a weird-sex-party - which was a whole lot of nothing.<br />Dull dull dull.  A fourth of the theatre walked out.  I was surprised at reading the Amazon reviews - I would think this (and the equally dreadful A.I.) would convince Kubrick fans that the emperor has no clothes.  Instead, I see reviews which toute the negatives as positives, and criticize naysayers as lacking the true insite they possess.  Don't believe the lies!  I think such reviewers have adopted the cynical outlook that a movie being boring, emotionally detached, and occasionally vague means it *must* be a work of art.  I really don't see another reason anyone would give this more than a star.

0440224764|4.0|John Grisham has done it again.  The Partner is full of suspense that keeps you at the edge of your seat, and is full of twists and turns that are unparallel to any other book.  Using a false identity Patrick Lanigan, was able to hide from authorities.  However, he was captured at the edge of the Brazilian jungle.  After being caught, the suspense truly begans.  The question lies, how and why was a successful lawyer like Patrick Lanigan able to appropriate 90 million dollars from his law firm. The story leads to an ending that will truly cause you to jump from the edge of your seat and leave you in aw.  John Grisham truly wrote another masterpiece in The Partner.
B00005NGAL|5.0|I saw part of Cats on TV and rented it shortly after to see it all. The singers all have wonderful voices; Munkustrap is fantastic, Mr. Mistoffeles, Jemima's voice is so lovely, and the dancing is perfect. Victoria's dance is beautiful. The songs are different in the video from the cd, lyrically speaking (in a couple of songs.) I'm excited about this DVD version because of the added bonus material.
0385495323|4.0|Very interesting reading. I expected a book that would end with a basic lesson modern in cryptography, and instead got a wonderful history of all forms of secrecy and information hiding.  The best part is that it was fun too!  This book will interest amateur linguists, computer programmers, mathematicials, historians, and policitians.  There's just so much perspective and insight here.  The book gets a little slow at times, but if you make it all the way to the end you'll find your self equipped to talk about a whole range of topics you never knew existed.
B00000DF6O|5.0|i've heard of the KING, but never actually listened to b.b.king's albums before. This is the first 'blues' album i bought (and 1st b.b.king album ever) ...and i love it !<br />So intoxicating it is, listening to Riley King making love to Lucille. Many of the tunes in BOTB may sound similar in the opening guitar riffs, but on extended listens, they are actually different. Very well made album, this. His supporting band is doing a superb job of 'supporting' him, instead of drowning him off with their own instruments.  King's vocals are especially nice, with fine control (at his age!) and with the occasional 'authoritative' growls in other sections. Cool! The physical length of the CD is long enough to keep you whetted with superior 'blues' music, so it is Value For Money. <br />The CD is got is a &quot;Made in the E.U.&quot; version. Dunno about the other country's pressings, but i perceive this CD to be a little 'bass-heavy', overall. I had to touch the 'bass' knob to lessen a little of the low frequencies (i almost always listen to my music on the 'tone-defeated' setting). Cud anyone who has the non-E.U. pressing comment on the sound/recording quality?<br />GREAT BLUES CD. Highly recommended.
B000002I6T|5.0|. . . though his recent stuff with CPR comes darned close. But this is a longtime favorite of mine, and nothing is likely to dislodge it.<br />If every speck of weed were to disappear from the planet tomorrow, it would still be possible to get stoned just from this CD. (Strictly speaking, you wouldn't even have to listen to it; you could pick up a contact high just from holding it in your hand.)<br />But contrary to the previous beliefs of some of my generation, it's not actually necessary to use chemical aids to achieve this sort of high. The high Crosby achieves on this album is the real thing: hauntingly beautiful artistry that includes but transcends his own individual contribution, producing a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts. This is some of Crosby's best music, and it's not an accident that so many other names appear in the liner notes.<br />For this album reads like a Who's-Who of the late '60s/early '70s California music scene: Graham Nash, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, and an array of other contributors we might as well call the Grateful Airplane. And everybody pitches in _something_ without which the album wouldn't be what it is.<br />But the center of it all is Crosby and his own unique musical vision. And when he's at his best -- as he is here -- his songwriting is so good he sometimes doesn't need to bother with words at all (as, e.g., on &quot;Song With No Words (Tree With No Leaves)&quot;). If the first thirty seconds of &quot;Tamalpais High (At About Three)&quot; doesn't leave you stunned and transfixed, then you and I aren't from the same home planet -- and I don't especially want to visit yours.<br />(The stuff _with_ words is still timely as well -- unfortunately, because some of it was recorded in the hope of making itself irrelevant and unnecessary. &quot;I wonder who they are / The men who really run this land / And I wonder why they run it / With such a thoughtless hand . . . &quot; At the time, this stuff was a call to action and a cry for change. Now, thirty years on, you may find yourself shaking your head and wondering whether anything has changed after all.)<br />Longtime Crosby fans probably already have this CD; if not, let me just mention that the CD was remastered from the original analog recordings by the original engineer, Stephen Barncard, who did it right both times. And you'll probably remember all the cool photos (many of them by Henry Diltz); they're included.<br />New listeners: if you like CPR, you'll probably like this stuff too. Crosby's keen musical intelligence is sometimes less than obvious because of his understated approach, but don't underestimate it; there are few who can do it better. Terms like &quot;groovy&quot; and &quot;far out&quot; are easy to ridicule owing to their overuse, but this album is what they're supposed to mean.a cry for change.

B00003CXRM|4.0|I am 15 years old but I think that this movie thought me alot, it was very well written and the actors played there parts so well I felt that I was there. I believe that this movie taught me alot on religion( the devil) and on life in general . If anything I would recommend this movie to many people especially to my age groupe because it makes you think about different things that most of us don`t talk about . Whatch this movie once and  you will like it so much you will alomost know the lines bu heart !!
B00003CX5P|5.0|Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace is probably the most misunderstood sci-fi/fantasy movie in recent history. Why this movie recieved so much negative response is beyond me. I thought this was a truly spectacular film. And I'm not just saying that because it's Star Wars,(although that is a contributing factor)but because it is not just another it's-science-fiction-so-just-gimme-the-money type movie, although that's what many people said it was. Also because we returned to that galaxy far, far away and learned more about it. We have new characters, new enviroments and a whole new story.<br />Many complaints have surrounded this movie since it's release. Let's look at some of these,(there is nothing negative that anyone can say about this movie that I can't defend against.)<BR>1. The story. I once remember George Lucas saying that a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing. Well, I wasn't at all bored with this movie so there must've been a story there somewhere.<BR>2. The plot. This movie did something different when it came to the plot. It was several different subplots rolled into one. Qui-Gon's training of Obi-Wan, Amidala wishing to protect and save her people from the Trade Federation, Anakin's discovery by the Jedi who realize how strong he is with the Force, Senator Palpatine's rise to power which will lead to the downfall of the galaxy, the first meeting between C-3PO and R2-D2, Shmi's desire to let her son go free and fulfill his dreams, the rise of the Sith who finally making their move to conquer the galaxy, and the eventuality that Obi-Wan will train Anakin. I think it would be difficult for someone other than Lucas to tell so many stories in one movie. This is probably what led to the confusion of what the plot actually was to others. But that's just my theory. Anyone who want's a quick and easy version of the plot. Senator Palpatine(aka Darth Sidious)used the Trade Federation and the problem they presented with the trade route taxations. He would then have them blockade Naboo which would allow the Queen Amidala to overthrow Chancellor Valorum and Palpatine would take over, therefore moving his Sith plan into fruition. Valorum then sent two Jedi to try and negotiate a settlement. You can easily figure out the rest. I agree that this could've been clarified better. But altogether I liked the idea.<BR>3. The acting. Well I hate to admit this, but Star Wars never really had great acting. It had good or at least decent acting. I felt this had the same feeling as the other movies.<BR>4. Jar Jar Binks. Ah, yes, the underappreciated Gungan. All right, I can actually see why a lot of people didn't like him. But I'm not going to yell at you about it. I'll just say that I think he's awesome and not annoying. Probably because I'm not easily annoyed.(Not with movie's anyway.)<BR>5. Anakin Skywalker. He didn't bother me one bit either. I mean come on, he's just a kid, remember he's not going to stay like that forever.<BR>6. Too kiddish. Yeah, I can see that too, but this didn't bother me either. I say, hey, give George a break. This was his last chance to make a happy Star Wars movie. Remember that Episode's II and III are going to be a lot darker.<BR>7. Too much visual effects. Well, can you imagine how impossible it would be to do most of these sequences in live action? Exactly.<BR>8. The midichlorians. This is probably the most misunderstood element of this movie. Let me explain what it is. This just proves that not everyone can use the Force and become a Jedi. The more midichlorians one has within him, the stronger that being is with the Force. This is how Qui-Gon was able to determine that Anakin was the chosen one.<BR>9. Character development. This is probably the only thing I think that could've been improved. I would've like to have known more about Qui-Gon's past. The rest of them I think we're fairly developed. <br />Now that that's out of the way, I hope many of you look at this movie with a better viewpoint now. But even if you don't like the movie, I still suggest you pick up the DVD and watch &quot;The Beginning&quot; documentary. It may not drastically change your perception of the movie, but it will show that it's more than just a two hour toy commercial as many people say it is. Trailers, TV spots, deleted scenes, documentaries, animatics, commentaries, pictures, DVD-ROM and easter eggs galore. This is NOT a DVD to be missed. <br />Star Wars. I love those two words more than any other movie title. 10/10.
0385312083|4.0|Slaughterhouse Five by Kurt Vonnegut is a great anti-war masterpiece. Vonnegut takes readers on a journey of life both pre-war and post-war as experienced by Billy Pilgrim. The psychological characteristics that define Billy are a direct result of his war experience and eye witness account of the bombing of Dresden. <BR>Billy's 'ability' to travel through time allows him to view the dramatic events of Dresden several times, it also allows him to view his own birth, death, and everything in between. Some discredit Vonneguts writing as containing little to no focus; however, he wrote in such a jumbled fashion for a reason. Vonnegut is quoted as saying &quot; it is jumbled and jambled, moves all around, it doesn't make sense, nor does war.&quot;<BR>After reading Slaughterhouse Five I re-evaluated my personal opinion on war; Vonnegut paints a vivid picture of the traumatic effects of war on the individual in combat that war no longer seems justifiable by any means.<BR>I began reading this book at an ironic time, immediately before the events of September 11. As I continued to read and gain an understanding for the novel, the devastation that the United States is currently dealing with can in no way compare with the devastation as a result of the bombing of Dresden. In both events the side taking action effectively made a point; however, they did not do so without claiming the lives of several innocent civilians. The bombing of Dresden is a part of American history that cannot be erased and puts a damper on American pride.
B00005JHAD|4.0|It was suprisingly good.  There are so many twists and turns it really holds your interest.  The only thing that was difficult was trying to understand what in the world Brad Pitt was saying three-quarters of the times, bravo to him for pulling off the &quot;parkies&quot; accent!  It was a marvelous perfromace by Pitt and his co-stars, it is a hetic, super involved  kick butt movie. I would highly recommend it for all you sitting home on a friday night :)
B000002BBY|4.0|Oasis was and remains an easy target for critics and cynics.  If you see past the band's character shortcomings and liberal pilfering of British rock legends, then \\"Morning Glory\\" in quite enjoyable.  This is Oasis in their prime, at their peak of their careers.
0452282152|4.0|I read this during visits to European art galleries. It was entertaining. The author has a remarkable way of making every day things elegant signatures for likable characters. I found myself guessing what other stories could be read into European art classics.
B00005O5N1|5.0|Renee Zellweger hits all the right notes as 30-ish Bridget Jones,<BR>an English spinster whose family and friends are constantly deriding her for her single status.  She is madly in love with her boss, played by Hugh Grant, who is a selfish, self-centered womanizer.  She flirts with him in an outrageous manner until, wonder of wonders, he does make a pass at her.  Bridget is hilarious as an awkward, tongue-tied, falling-down, sort of girl and Grant plays off her character well.  Her mother tries to fix her up with a stuffy lawyer, but Bridget is having none of that.<BR>This is a delightful, laugh-out-loud comedy which never loses its human touch.
0066620996|5.0|Reader-friendly GOOD TO GREAT is one of those rare books that presents important research findings, and then explains in a clear, concise and compelling manner how to take that learning and directly apply it to effect a good-to-great transformation in any company.<br />Collins' findings may shake up current perceptions of what it takes to make a company great. (The most crucial factor is to get the right people on the bus; charismatic leaders are a handicap; big change does not have to be wrenching, extreme, painful; you can't buy your way to greatness; people can't be motivated either by fear or by clever names or taglines for change programs...) The results from a five-year study of 11 companies that have sustained substantial gains over the market for 15 years speak for themselves - eloquently.<br />If you are serious about changing the course of your company and you only have time to read one book this year, GOOD TO GREAT should be the one. Hats off to Jim Collins, who was not content to sit back and grin after co-authoring the highly successful BUILT TO LAST, but tackled a book that should make an even greater impact on the future of  businesses, large and small.<br />Favorite quote (Chapter 9): &quot;Turning good into great takes energy, but the building of momentum adds more energy back into the pool than it takes out. Perpetuating mediocrity is an inherently depressing process and drains much more energy out of the pool than it puts back in... In the end, it is impossible to have a great life, unless it is a meangingful life. And it is very difficult to have a meaningful life without meaningful work.&quot;<br />This one's a keeper.
074322454X|5.0|My grandfather served in the Army during WWII, Korea and Vietnam.  As he died when I was young, I never had the chance to speak to him about his combat experiences. Thanks to Ambrose, I feel like I have some idea of what he went through. He spent 30 days plus in a foxhole, happy to get out for a decent sleep, a shower, and a hot meal.  I hope all Americans stop and realize what these men sacrificed so that we might enjoy freedom.  These men have my undying gratitude and admiration.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I just loved being able to rediscover all the characters of this all-time best science fiction film. Without a doubt, lucas has brought forth an awsome addition to the trilogy. Visual effects are impressive ank keep you strapped in your seat 'til the last minute. Would definatly recommend this one to all audiences.
B000001EGE|5.0|Honky Chateau. What can one say... it's a masterpiece from start to finish.  Elton John was displaying on this album perhaps his most impressive writing up to that point, veering from country to rock to sheer powerhouse ballad beauty.  Every song is amazing(especially the less acclaimed &quot;I Think I'm Going To Kill Myself&quot; and &quot;Suzie (dramas)&quot;, the latter for it's awesome drumming).  if there is one Elton album you MUST have, this is it!
6303998704|5.0|...  This is everything a horror movie should be and more:a true cult classic.  Some of the images from this film will remain etched in your cinematic psyche--it has the mystery and poetic beauty of a David Lynch movie, and yet is as scary (if not scarier) than \\"Night of the Living Dead\\". Horror movies like this are as rare as they are a true joy to every student of film or fan of the genre, made on shoestring budgets, with all the objective odds stacked against them, and yet coming through with all the vividness and vitality of a nightmare.  \\"The man\\" (Herk Harvey) following Mary around is terrifying, and it leaves just enough to the viewer's imagination to make every scene with him in it genuinely chilling.  He and the other 'carnival zombies' (for lack of a better term) are straight out of a nightmare and the whole thing just works beautifully.  If you're into surrealism, horror, or just great movies, don't just rent but BUY this obscure masterpiece.
0452282152|5.0|Chevalier's novel portrays the story of a famous Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer. The main character, Griet, becomes a maid at Vermeer's house. Unfortunately she is despised by his wife and daughter, Catherina and Cornelia.

A novel full of so many secrets and issues we are battling with everyday is sure to capture your attention especially young adults.
B000000OMP|5.0|Slide It In is one of my most favourite albums of all time. It has all the punch of the hard rock that they had produced before, but more commercially based (although it is not too much this way). Mel Galley and Mickey Moody form together very well on the playing on this album. Colin Hodgkinson and Cozy Powell bring up the rhythm well, and of course Jon Lord. as ever, is just brilliant on piano and organ. Micky Moody is just the best guitarist ever and if anyone wants to contradict that then, well... you must be barking mad!<BR>If anybody has the mock-LP packaged version of the CD Slide It In (EMI 7243 8 35362 2 1) please could you email me if you want to sell it, and it is in good condition.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Okay, I love the fact that Diana Krall has given us this collection of classics/standards and that, as usual, she has handled them all with such care.  Very sexy date music.  But sometimes the technical proficiency loses some feeling.  While this is not a problem with every track, I found something amiss with &quot;Besame Mucho&quot; and &quot;Cry Me A River.&quot;  In the latter case, I found that she doesn't can't get the same feeling across that the late Julie London gave us, but maybe that is just me.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This album is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.  Sure, it's a whole lot different from recordings such as &quot;The Bends&quot;, but is that really a bad thing.  I loved their earlier music, but &quot;Amnesiac&quot; deserves just as much praise as does Ok Computer or The Bends.  They still right very powerful lyrics, that is conveyed really well using their background sounds.  Not all of it is music, at least not in the traditional sense, but it is still great stuff.

B00003CX5P|1.0|I haven't seen the original Star Wars in awhile when I saw this train wreck of a movie. Having seen the original Star Wars Trilogy a few hundred times, I can truly admit that the movies get worse and worse with each viewing. What puzzles me is the lack of good acting in all of these movies.<BR>In Episode One, truly the worst is that annoying kid portraying Anakin Skywalker. Hopefully, he will be banned from film making and find himself a real job. The script is so bad and so unoriginal, even a good actor like Ewan Mcgregor had trouble making his part believable. Which brings me to the worst part of this movie: the incredibily racist sterotypes. Don't believe me? In the opening scene we have the rat looking, broken english speaking, conniving Chinese aliens. Then we are introduced to a unintelligent, ebonics speaking, minstrel Jamaican. Of course there's also the flying, cheap Jewish Alien shopkeeper, with the giant nose included.<BR>George Lucas and Company may have created the most expensive piece of trash in American film history. While the special effects were stunning, the ignorance portrayed in this movie was what truly amazed me. The sad saga of commercial America continues...
B00005O3VC|5.0|In the early 1970's the Monty Python troop (Michael Palin, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, and Terry Jones) stars from the immensely popular television series Monty Python's Flying Circus began producing, with the help of a fundraising concert headlined by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd (You lie!! No, I didn't!), initial photography on what would later become (from all my extensive years of movie watching) the single most unforgivably sidesplitting, enormously irreverent, shrewdly perceptive, unremittingly uproariously aggressive, gruesomely hysterical, and endlessly quotable comedies EVER. Not even Mel Brooks's Best Efforts (The Producers, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein) comes very close to the revolutionary medieval merriment sustained in this royal purebred of cult classics. BAR NONE. No contest here. <br />Endlessly stockpiled with hauntingly hysterical sketches that will probably never leave your mind (no matter how hard you try) including, The Knights Who Say Nei, The Self-Abusing Monks (Eah aay ess eay dom eay nay), The Black Knight, The Trojan Rabbit, the Ever-Appearing Verbally Abusing French (I don't want to talk to you no more!!!), The Enchanter Named Tim, The Killer Bunny, The Bridge of Death (What is the capital of Hysteria?), The Old Woman Named Dennis, and so many countless more great sketches to include here that I'd die trying. Monty and Python and the Holy Grail remains an ever-enriching mirthful cult-classic that just seems to improve with age. Since Columbia has a bountifully hefty new special edition of the Holy Grail out now there should be no excuse, if you've never seen it (I think I'll go for a walk!!), just drop everything your doing (including Bringing Out Your Dead) and go experience this life changing movie today. You won't be disappointed, just tell them the Knight Not Appearing In This Film sent you, and they'll know what to do.<BR> <BR>As for the options on the special edition here's a run-down:<BR> <BR>Disc One: -&quot;21st Anniversary&quot; cut of the film running an extra 24 seconds; -Anamorphic Widescreen; -Dolby 5.1 track; -Original Mono Track; -Audio commentary with Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, John Cleese, Eric Idle and Michael Palin; -subtitles &quot;for people who don't like the film&quot; (you get the text from Shakespeare's Henry IV instead); -an &quot;on-screen screenplay&quot; feature which lets you read the screenplay as you watch the film; -&quot;Follow the Killer Rabbit&quot; feature; <br />Disc Two: &quot;Three Mindless Sing-Alongs&quot;; -&quot;The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations&quot; featurette; -&quot;How to Use Your Coconuts&quot; educational film; -&quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail in Japanese&quot; (with English subtitles); -the BBC Film Night special &quot;On Location with the Pythons; -an interactive cast directory; -still galleries with Terry Gilliam's original sketches and behind-the-scenes photos; -&quot;A Load Of Rubbish&quot; with mystery items; -unused ideas and other material; -two trailers<BR>and web-links.<BR> <BR>Both discs represent the absolute final word resource for EVERYTHING and I do mean everything you'd need to know about the Python's greatest film. An Absolute Necessity for any Python Fan!! <br />P.S. You can't base a system of government just because some watery tart threw a sword at you.
0517118297|3.0|I was searching for a good compilation of all the Austen novels so I could have it available for when I get the &quot;bug&quot; to read them all once again. Rather than keep running out for paperbacks, I wanted a single volume that I could keep pretty much for the rest of my life, available at my whim.  I thought this might be the volume, but I was disappointed in the actual quality of the book.  It is printed on newsprint, which ages very quickly.  This book won't retain it's neatness or newness for very long.  If you are looking for something durable, beware.  Try the Everyman editions -- they look much better and though the collection will be pricey in comparison, in the end you'll have books to last a lifetime.

0792846303|4.0|I recently watched this movie for the first time and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I am a fan of horror films (not the slashing/gore kind) and I don't know how I had missed this one.  Although the plot is obvious this one got quite a few surprised screams out of me.  The movie does not show graphic violence, leaving a lot to the imagination, which is usually scarier than anything Hollywood can create.  Definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.  Barbeau and Curtis are excellent, as usual.

6301607929|4.0|You can start with play by William Inge, Add Josh Logan and James Wong Howe,... Morris Stoloff and screenplay by Daniel Tarradash( From Here To Eternity)...and you wind up with a big big hit.<br />Shot on location in central Kansas, the flavor of this film is much more than one first perceives. Arthur O' Connell and Roz Russell wonderfull in support. James Wong Howe,s Cinematography must be viewed in letterbox format to appreciate the wonder of it all. <br />Its a much earlier time in the heart of the USA...and things are much more sublime than now. Great montage scenes...such as the love scene bewtween Holden and Novak by the train tracks...<BR>...They embrace...the train starts to come by...she says&quot; We have to get back to picnic&quot;  ....he says( Hal) ...&quot; Do We&quot;?....the train goes by...cut to the full moon in the sky..the score goes up and fade out....................Thats real Cinema!!<br />Produced by Fred Kohlmar..of course!!
B000056K04|4.0|The Dave Mattews Band is one of todays top performing bands.  They are known as the top concert band of today, and they have a huge fan base.  But people seem to not like their newest CD entitled &quot;Everyday.&quot;  Maybe it is the fact that the songs really have to do with problems in the world.  Maybe it is just the fact that Dave Mattews does not play the accoustic guitar for his listeners.  Either way would not be good reasons for not liking good songs.  As usual, Dave and the rest of the band has written songs and compiled them onto a great CD.  Of course the CD is not what the fans are used to, but it is still full of good songs that every fan should enjoy.

B00003CXRM|4.0|O Brother where art thou comes courtesy of Joel and Ethan Coen who do nothing to break their reputation of making quirky and ultra-stylish films that end up magnificent. Following their tales of the upper Midwest (Fargo) and a bowler from LA (The Big Lebowski) comes a take on Homer's Odyssey in the dirty 30s. George Clooney stars as our traveling hero Ulysses Everett McGill a man obsessed with his image and his special hair treatment.<br />McGill convinces his jail buddies Pete (John Turturro) and Delmer (Tim Black Nelson) to escape alongside him with promise of a million dollar treasure awaiting them at the end of the trip. The trip really is all about him trying to re-unite with his wife in time before she gets remarried. Right away they run into a prophetic blind man on a railroad cart who warns them of their fate and then the standard Coen craziness begins.<br />Among the things our trio of runaways encounters are one-eyed bulky bible salesman, 3 sirens who seduce them, the Klan, and a manic depressive bank robber amongst other things. Joining them off and on through their journey is Tommy, a black man who tells them he sold his soul to the devil so he could play the guitar, which does come in handy when the pop into a recording studio and make some easy money singing what becomes a smash hit for the movie world and in reality with \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\".<br />I will admit to having to see this film 3 or 4 times before it really clicked with me, but Coen fans in the end will absolutely adore this picture. The film is highlighted by solid acting performances and some great cinematography and the roots soundtrack, which brought as much attention to the picture as anything. So another solid fare from the Coens would have firmly rooted themselves as consistent filmmakers who can still make original films when they're most needed.
B00000JHAU|5.0|This is a great album.  The first few tracks are more upbeat and moving, &quot;Like Dylan in the Movies&quot; is an incredible pop song.  Me and the Major is an upbeat anthem about the generation gap.  The title track is among the best songs the band has written.  Fox in the Snow is another excellent song, it is moody and moving.  My favorite track is The Boy Done Wrong Again.  This song alone justifies the purchase of this CD.  If you ever feel guilty about anything, play this song on your stereo..  you will know what I mean.
B00005QIPH|4.0|I just discovered this band a couple of weeks ago, even though I live in NYC. So I never heard the Hype about them. I bought the CD on the strength of their Music Video 'Last Nite'.  When I saw the video I immediately liked the band's retro sound and  punk attitude.  On the CD, 9 of the 11 tracks are quickly growing on me, with track 8 'Hard To Explain' getting endless rotations on my portable player. These guys  sound like they were influenced by the music I listened to as a teen. Some New Wave influences are in there as well as late Beatles, Lou Reed and the Ramones (well at least to my ears!). Are they the saviors of Rock? Buy the CD and Rock on!
0440219078|5.0|The Giver<BR>By Louis Lowry <br /> The Giver is about a future society where everything has gone to sameness.  The weather, colors, and daily routine are the same for everybody in the community every single day.  The government has done this in order to create a \\"perfect\\" life for everyone.  They have completely eliminated choices!  The only problem is that they have to store the memories with one person.  Not one other person knows a thing about the past.  There are no memories for anyone, happy or sad, except for the Receiver.  It is a huge burden to bear.  The Giver, the old Receiver, and the Receiver have decided it is time to release memories to the rest of the community.<BR> Louis Lowry really warns against the dangers of losing our rights of basic freedom.  The author is definitely one for freedom of choice.  This book was banned because of the references to euthanasia, infanticide, and violent and sexual passages.  I feel that this book is appropriate for the age group to which it was directed.  These are real issues in today's times and today's children are the ones who will deal with these topics the most.  I feel that she did a favor towards the future's society by introducing the youth to these topics that could very possibly get out of hand if not dealt with.
0812550706|3.0|I just read this book (2001) because a friend told me it was a classic.  I must say I was quite disappointed.  This book was written circa 1977, and for the late '70s and even the '80s it must no doubt have been a stunning achievement. The talk of 'nets (much like today's internet) and the ideas on anti-gravity, etc. are very good for that time. But after the 1990's I think this would be a hard book to appreciate, unless you're reading it for it's &quot;classic&quot; status.<br />Much of the disappointment resulted from the story-telling itself. The main character is perfect in every way. The entire book tells of different challenges Ender Wiggins faces, quickly analyzes and conquers, and moves on to the next similar challenge. Maybe it's because I read this book right after enjoying the MODERN story-telling prowess of George R.R. Martin's latest book (Storm of Swords), I found Ender's story rather boring.  I had read somewhere that it had a surprise near the end, but when I got there, I didn't really care, and it was a lame surprise anyway.<br />If the book had any interesting parts, it was not Ender's story, which is most of the book, but the short chapter on his brother Peter and sister Valentine, who are much more complex characters. The last chapter was also a little interesting.<br />All in all, it seems to me this book is a little out-of-date. It still would be excellent reading for younger kids, with it's constantly positive outcomes and pre-teen hero.  And though I'm no psychiatrist, I felt it would be make a great lesson in discipline and responsiblities for today's rather spoiled pre-teen and teenage population (it would have to be a required reading material).  I give it three stars for these reasons.
079073382X|5.0|Ever since I discovered this gem, I have wondered about the music in the film. The scene where the Jesse takes Celine by the hand and dances with her in the Viennese street to the sound of a harpsicord is lovely. This is a plea for anyone who could recommend similar harpsicord recordings to the one in the film.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|The problem with nearly every kids movie out there is that they're either impossibly boring for grownups to enjoy with their children or they're full of bad messages even when they're trying to be moral or instructive.  Shrek has neither of these problems.  In this highly entertaining film, the monster isn't a monster, the evil dragon isn't all that evil, and the beautiful damsel who needs to be rescued isn't a beautiful damsel, and she's perfectly capable of rescuing herself.  It's full of tons of positive messages about tolerance, prejudism, inner beauty, gender equality, and other such noble ideas that simply don't come across clearly in other films...Shrek is well animated, well written, and very well acted.  It's absolutely hilarious at times, and very touching at others.  I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with it and wanting to watch it over and over again.

0060916540|4.0|\\"Touching the Void\\" is a non-fiction suspense account by Joe Simpson.  It all begins when Joe and his best friend, Simon, decide they want to climb the unforgiving Siula Grande mountain in the Peruvian Andes.  To get warmed up, they do a smaller climb that takes them two days and two nights.  After carefully watching the weather patterns, they choose a departure date.  The first two days of the journey are beautiful sunny days without despair.  As the third day rolls around and they push for the summit, they come upon bad weather.  Maybe this proves to be a bad omen.  The two climbers successfully reach the summit, but on the way down run into a terrible blizzard.  As the two men slowly wander off course, Joe takes a horrifying fall and badly injures his knee.  The incredible part of the story is how they overcome the physical challenge and keep on descending.  When Joe and Simon believe they have almost made it to the valley floor, everything goes wrong.  Joe is left for dead as Simon has to make an unforgettable decision.  Fortunately, Joe has an unusually strong will to live.  Never giving up and staying calm and in control will always prevail; in \\"Touching the Void\\" by Joe Simpson, Joe survives a horrendous fall and hangs on until the bitter end.<br />Joe Simpson wrote this book to share with all readers his true account of a terrifying adventure and a miraculous ending.  The strongest device used to bring the Peruvian Andes right to the living room of the reader is the diction.  Simpson's word choice is what makes the book worth while reading.  \\"As the hammer came out there was a sharp cracking sound and my right hand, gripping the axe, pulled down.  The sudden jerk turned me outwards and instantly I was falling . . . the rushing speed of it confused me.  .  . then the pain flooded down my thigh- a fierce burning fire coming down the inside of my thigh, seeming to ball in my groin, building and building until I cried out at it, and my breathing came in ragged gasps.  My leg!  Oh Jesus.  My leg! (P. 71-72).\\"  These lines stand out because it brings the adventure right to the living room.  This incredible sensation is all due to the excellent choice of diction.  Simpson also added excerpts from Simon's journal to add another perspective here and there.  \\"Touching the Void\\" reaches the necessary literary level simply because of Simpson's word choice.

B00003CXP1|5.0|Like many people who have reviewed this movie, I rented the DVD a few months ago with no idea what to expect. Suffice to say, it was quite an experience watching this movie. Some of the scenes in this movie remain in the front of my mind and are impossible to forget - like I switched off the DVD player a few minutes ago even though it's been a few months.<br />Possibly the most gut-wrenching part of taking in this movie was the fact that my grandmother actually went through a similar ordeal as Ellen Burstyn's character. I seriously grieve for my grandmother now that I have seen what Aronofsky illustrated with unrelenting, pulse-pounding vision. Luckily, my grandmother had a support system to help her get through her ordeal, whereas Burstyn's character has no one. It's very troubling to think about what might have been. <br />Bravo, Darren Aronofsky. This is a visionary film - one that should not be watched alone.
B00005QG9J|3.0|This is a very good but im sorry to say not toits full potentail. I had very hih expectations for this cd and it did not meet them. This is a much softer cd the there previous cd Make YourSelf but all and all this is a better cd for the lighter listening croud.
B00005OMTT|5.0|When I play Enigma to other people, they often look at me like I have gone crazy. The music is unlike everything out there. And yet it is probably some of the most sensual, erotic and pleasing music I have ever enjoyed. You get hooked after a couple of listenings. If you want music to escape into this is certainly it. Fantastic stuff!!
B00005BJ2O|5.0|First of all, the song listing is incorrect. It's actually:<BR>1. Nature Boy - the David Bowie version<BR>2. Lady Marmalade<BR>3. Because we can<BR>4. Sparkling diamonds<BR>5. Rhythm of the night<BR>6. Your song<BR>7. Children of the Revolution<BR>8. One day I'll fly away<BR>9. Diamond dogs<BR>10. Elephant love medley<BR>11. Come what may<BR>12. Le Tango de Roxanne<BR>13. Compliante de la butte - (in french... mostly)<BR>14. Hindi sad diamonds<BR>15. Nature boy - weird remix of movie version... I think.<BR>Anyway, I love this movie and the soundtrack is amazing. I do regret that two of my favorite songs from the movie were not included on the soundtrack, which were &quot;like a virgin&quot; and the one when they were making up a musical on the spur of the moment. My favorite songs are 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, and 12. David Bowie is just amazing. But then again, I'm a Labyrinth freak. Anyway, back to this movie. Lady Marmalade wasn't even in this movie. I don't see the point of having the song, period. Because we can is a great dancing song. Sparkling diamonds is basically Diamonds are a girl's best friend, but. different. You'll understand when you hear it. #5, 7, and 9 are fine. they're pretty good, but just pale drastically in comparison to the rest of the cd. Your song is amaxing, because Ewan MacGregor is amazing. Period. No further explanations neccessary. One day I'll fly away is amazing because Nicole Kidman is amazing. You get the point. The elephant love medley is. I don't know how to describe it. It's maybe the best song on the cd because it is a complilation of so many different songs, so the song gets the point across very well, and there's a bit of humor if you know the songs, but it's just a very unique song. Come what may is an amazing duet. The actors are amazing. Le Tango de Roxanne is... the most powerful, emotional song here. Like someone wrote earlier, the best phrase the decribe it is &quot;open the flood gates&quot;. There are overlaying melodies, and... oh, it's just wonderful. Compliante de la butte is a very simple, sweet song. It's partly in French and partly in English, but a very nice compliment to the cd, and the perfect way to recover from drowning in the last song. Hindi sad diamonds is very.. odd. It just takes a certain taste to like it, but it is well done as is the rest of the cd. The nature boy remix thing is kind of odd. I wish they had just put the movie version in. Its very beautiful, but on the cd they put this odd background to it, trying to make it into a dance song or something I suppose. Anyway, I'm done. Sorry it took so long. I have a tendency to rant about things I like this much. Hope this helped. Tchao.
B00005ATQH|3.0|I saw this movie on TV on TCM a little while ago. It is without a doubt worth watching once, if not worth buying.  The acting by James Mason and Peter Sellars is way more than you even have a right to expect from those two great performers.  Not only that, but the plot is interesting and holds your attention right to the end.  I only wish the DVD has more special features on it.  But really, if the only problem with a movie is the fact that there aren't enough extras on the DVD, then that means the movie is one hell of a good one.<BR>A definite must see.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Some people say that you shouldn't listen to melancholy songs when you are feeling blue.  But last year, when I was going through a rough patch, I found that Dido's music and lyrics were soothing and lovely in a way that I found comforting.  Now that I am past that time, I still find that her to be a sound that I want to listen to again and again.
B00005NWRS|5.0|Quite simply, the best CD I've purchased in months.  This guy is just amazing...he can rock'n'roll one minute and the next song will be a melodic heartbreaker - an extremely talanted songwriter.  This is most definitely one of the must have's of 2001...
B00000JRTX|4.0|I am an anti-Andi McDowell fan.  I avoid her mvies and don't buy products she advertises.  In fact I make faces at the television screen as she shows us her luscious locks.  But I liked this movie despite her because it is funny, sweet, sad, and charming.  I even moved to England to meet my own English man (so far, no luck).  If they had only used a different American actress, I wouldn't be able to give this enough accolades.
B000002VMH|4.0|I am really enjoying this disc for the first 7 songs.  The arrangements are creative and the singing is really a notch above.  The songs are synth driven, of course, in Annie's style and if you like the Eurythmics, then you'll like this disc.  The whole disc sounds like that band.  The last 3 songs put me to sleep.  Just very bland.  They're pleasant enough, but nothing special.  Annie Lennox has a good voice, and she really carries this disc.  Very emotional.  She is definately involved in this project.  I want to stress that the first 7 songs are better than good, they are especially good.  The next three are especially boring.  The last is a throw in.  If you are a fan, get this, because Annie is in good form here.

0440234743|4.0|There are two different angles to this book.  A wealthy billionaire with many pathetic offspring leaves a will before commiting suicide.  The children believing to be ric beyond their dreams start spending.<br />He has however left the lot to another child who has found God and is doing His work deep in the jungle.  Nate O' Riley a recovering washed up alcoholic lawyer is pulled out of Rehab to track her down.<br />A good desciptive story with believable characters and the jungle parts of the book interweave well with the pursuit of the greedy lawyers.  A nice easy book to read.
B00005QIPH|3.0|First, let me just say that the Strokes are a perfectly fine band that has produced a fun and enjoyable yet stunningly mediocre CD.  Period.  That's it.  Second, what's with all the hype?  A band this musically uninspired yet that generates so much buzz can only be the result of a few well-placed phone calls by the guys in corner offices that call the shots.  A sort of stealth N-Sync for the quasi-intellectual hipster crowd yet tolerable because they are not so patently commercial.  Don't be fooled or as N. Young might sing, &quot;This Stroke's For You&quot;.<br />One can't help but listen to this CD and think over and over, &quot;Hey, that's great but where have I heard that before?&quot;  Too often, the Strokes sound too much like slumming boozed-up prep schools boys trying to sound like the Ramones playing the Velvet Underground trying to sound like the Rolling Stones yet wishing the entire time that they were as talented and original as Guided by Voices.<br />Also, a band like the Strokes has to be about attitude for the music to truly work.  But again, they are either too self-aware (&quot;Is This It&quot; as a album title&quot;?) or even worse, too contrived (lead singer stumbling around wearing a Camel Joe t-shirt on that already over-played &quot;Last Nite&quot; video) to pull it off.<br />Good band for drinking beer and shooting pool to but the quest for the new, big thing goes on.
1559409002|4.0|It only takes one word to sum up what makes the low-budget CARNIVAL OF SOULS a great horror film--atmosphere.  In their only commercial effort targeted for cinematic distribution, director Herk Harvey and his co-writer John Clifford whip up an ambiguous and unsettling narrative open to many interpretations--social alienation, emotional or mental breakdown, and feminist aggressiveness, to name just a few--and then pepper it with the palpable imagery of death and the afterlife.  And just in case the seasoned horror fan isn't unnerved enough, the spookiness is further augmented by a musical score comprised of an ethereal Bach-like organ music.  This creates a moody ambiance that reaches a bone-chilling apogee rarely achieved in even some of the more popular horror flicks, and by the time the film arrives at its haunting climax, viewers have sprouted goose bumps aplenty.<br />The story centers on Mary Henry, a young and ordinary Midwestern girl who is the sole survivor of a deadly auto accident.  In an effort to put the tragic accident behind her, Mary takes a job in a town several states to the west.  All of her efforts seem for naught, however, when she becomes haunted by spirits who beckon her to join them in a nightly danse macabre.  Ultimately, Mary comes full circle when events compel her to return to her hometown and face the truth about her own personal reality.<br />Wonderful as it is, CARNIVAL OF SOULS is not without its minor production faults.  Though actress Candace Hilligoss is outstanding as the pretty yet odd protagonist, many members of the supporting cast are obvious amateurs with little, if any, acting experience.  Director Herk Harvey was, by vocation, an industrial filmmaker who often peopled his productions with any &quot;soul&quot; who happened to be at hand, and it seems he adhered to this practice when casting this film.  In addition, it is glaringly obvious in some spots that the dialogue looping is either out of sync or is altogether different from the lines actually delivered by the actor.  Oddly enough, though, these few faults don't detract in the least from the strong, moody psychological narrative; if anything, they actually add to the surreal and creepy atmosphere.<br />CARNIVAL OF SOULS is one of those rare low-budget independent films that has risen above its modest beginnings, as well as some of its big-budget contemporaries, to become a cherished and well-respected cinema classic.  That it succeeds is a tribute to its creators, a handful of talented people who, against all odds, were determined to realize their artistic vision and to share that vision with the public.  And what a delightfully frightening vision it is!  A must-see for the serious horror aficionado, and a fun and creepy little curio for movie buffs of any calibre.from the lines actually delivered by the actor.

6304308388|5.0|If you've never seen this one...you're missing one of the great classics! Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are perfectly cast in this comedy set in New York around 1960. To climb the corporate ladder, Lemmon's character is letting his bosses &quot;use&quot; his apartment for extra-curicular activities. It's interesting to see how things have changed...(and how some things never change)! <br />P.S. You'll never look at a tennis racket the same way!!!
B0000013GT|5.0|&quot;ATLiens&quot; by Outkast is one of the greatest hip-hop albums ever.  Big Boi and Dre of Outkast really use some new sounds and beats on this album, and the lyrics are great.  Though Outkast uses explicit lyrics, the overall message they are sending out is positive.  They tell listeners to &quot;put the glock away&quot; and they do not put down females.  &quot;ATLiens&quot; is an awesome album, in which any rap or hip-hop fan should own.  It is a good investment because no new rap songs or albums have such unique sounds like it.  I gave this album five stars because since this album came out, most  other rap albums have been disappointing.
0446677450|3.0|It is easy to read but not really easy to understand. This book started with an interesting beginning introducing why the author wanted to be rich and how he figureed out the way he could be rich. This arouse my interest. Then, i have found most of the time the author reminds the reader to invest in assets and keeps reducing liabilities without explains it clearly how to achieve this point. The author emphasizes on investment strategy because he has won many battles in investing assets. However, i have found this mostly due to his fortune. In addition, his definitions of assets and liabilities are not clear because he used little example to explain the differences between these two.<BR>He discouraged people not to use the money they've borrowed from others to invest in assets. Yet, as i have seen, what he did in the book it's just what he told people not to do!<BR>Honestly speaking, his stand points were not consistent through the whole book. Those stand points may not be applicable in every country and in any period. <BR>Nevertheless, i can learn there is ways to get rich from the author. The pictures shown in the book also helped me to understand the cash flow well.
0385493622|5.0|The author seeks to describe the events that led to the proof of Fermat's theorem and succeeds amply. Not only is the book informative, its very very enjoyable. The book does not require a math background.  In fact the author takes care to properly introduce any math term or concept he uses.<br />Fermat was a great mathematician. In one of his notebooks he stated an equation and mentioned that the margin was too short for the proof of the statement. Later mathematicians found it impossible to prove this math statement. So hard was the problem that it became one of the most popular problems in mathematics and remained unsolved for centuries! Recently, a math professor from Princeton proved this theorem after a marathon effort.<br />The book introduces the reader to a lot of key mathematicians and interesting anecdotes associated with them. The best aspect of the book is that it presents events spanning centuries, in a manner that fits them together as parts of a solution to a single problem. Its not a sequential narration of events, instead its a coherent presentation of what was done over the years and how it contributed to the final assault.
B00004TL21|5.0|First off, don't say this CD isn't heavy. Just because the lyrics are more upbeat than usual on a few songs (Digital Bath, RX Queen, Passenger), that doesn't mean it's not as heavy.<br />But at the same time, this CD is beautiful. The lyrics are touching, the guitar work is stunning, and Chino's voice---I can't even describe Chino's voice.<br />The best songs on this CD are Back to School (I have the white version, but it seems more people read reviews for the standard silver version...), Feitceria, Digital Bath, RX Queen, Street Carp, Teenager, Knife Prty, Passenger, and Change.<br />No matter how awesome Around the Fur was, because that CD is also a masterpiece, White Pony is that much better. Get this CD today.
B00003CX5P|4.0|This is the first DVD of the greatest saga in the movies history (along with the Godfather). I think this DVD should have ALL the options they could add. For example... Why to include only spanish dub version? Everybody likes to see the movie in its original languaje.... SUBTILES!!!.... we wanted SUBTILES.....<br /><BR>They cold also give us an ULTIMATE EDITION... with all the deleted scenes included in the movie.... like the Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition... what a cool DVD!!...<br /><BR>I think they have to make their homework for the next DVD releases....
0316776963|4.0|I can't add much that previous reviewers haven't already mentioned.  I can say that this is a very funny and memorable read.  Rarely do I laugh out loud at things I read but this one had me roaring.  Especially \\"You Can't Kill The Rooster\\" - hilarious stuff.  I'm withholding one star because the collection seems a bit uneven.  It starts out strong but levels out towards the middle, eventually picking up some steam towards the end.  The pieces become less slapstick and more speculative, concentrating on life abroad in the last section of the book.  That's not a bad thing - it just makes the collection seem uneven.<br />Everyone needs a good laugh, especially now.  Read this.  Soon.
B0000549B0|5.0|For fans with a warm heart and a very dry sense of humor, this is a classic. It is what so many entertainers try to recreate and never will, because only people with the heart of a child will understand this film.

B000002BYD|5.0|This Cd, pure brilliancy. im a huge pearl jam fan. i was used to listening to older pearl jam albums such as,Ten. When i first bought this cd and listen to the first track, brain of j, i thought i would not like it as much as ten. the cd literally grew to me. some of the songs do not have a serious side and that was also something i liked.Eddie Vedder is a genious. it is impossible for pearl jam to make a bad album.
0790729725|5.0|You really cant say enough about this &quot;Based on a True Story&quot; mob movie. The movie takes place with Hank Hill (played by Ray Liotta), a young boy who dreams about his life of being a gangster. At a very young age Hank becomes part of the Mafia, and slowly learns about how it all works. From stealing company trucks (filled with merchandise) and peddling cocaine in order to help his family survive. Each and every minute of Goodfellas is a refreshing pace, (unlike most mob movies). With his insane buddy's Jimmie Conway (played brilliantly by Robert De Niro) and Tommy DeVito** (also played brilliantly by Joe Pesci, who also won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) Hank soon enough gets into more than he bargained for. And well, everyone around him is dying. Im not going to give away anymore details, but its a must have for any mob crazed fan's DVD collection.<br />Led with a brilliant cast of characters:<BR>Robert De Niro (The Godfather Part II), Joe Pesci** (Casino) and Ray Liotta (Hannibal). If you like mob movies, you should really enjoy this masterpiece of a film Directed by Legend Martin Scorsese.<br />(*)-Academy Award Nominated<BR>(**)-Academy Award Winner
B000050HTO|5.0|This should be a good introduction to he of the grating voice and greater lyrics. Most of the major, timeless stuff is here that Dylan fans are familiar with. The beginner may find a revelation in the original versions of &quot;Mr. Tamborine Man,&quot; (which to me, has his most simple and profound harmonica work), &quot;Quinn The Eskimo,&quot; &quot;All Along the Watchtower,&quot; &quot;Knocking on Heaven's Door.&quot;  Take a listen to the best of the White Soul Brother of Curtis Mayfield and Bob Marley, then get the &quot;Freewheelin Bob Dylan&quot;<BR>next.

B000050XEI|4.0|Enya's style is not as unique as it once was, but that's more due to the plethora of copycat artists than any waning of her originality.  &quot;A Day Without Rain&quot; doesn't disappoint in that respect, with haunting soundscapes and beautiful vocals.  The last track is a particular favourite of mine, but all the tracks on this CD live up to the standard of quality we have come to expect from this deeply talented singer.<br />Some may be disappointed by the value for money factor, given that this CD is only half the length of some other releases.  However, I'd still rather have half an hour of Enya than an hour of most other artists!  Buy it- play it- love it.
0446310786|5.0|I read To Kill A Mockingbird. This book was about 3 kids in the town of Maycomb. The setting of this stroy was during The Great Depression. The main characters are Jem, Scout &amp; Atticus Finch. They are poor, but luckily for them their dad, Atticus, is an attorney. Jem and Scout meet a boy, Dill, and get into all sorts of mischief throughout the story.<BR>     I thought that this book was interesting and learned the true meaning of the title. I thought this book was very meaningful and Lee has written a lot to teach his readers. this book is great for those with time on their hands and prepared for a good text. Harper moves the readers with the profound thoughts and quotes of the characters.
0786915749|5.0|The Dragonlance empire has grown to enormous proportions since its inception, with countless spin-off novels and series that do nothing to enhance the reputation of the originals.  Don't be put off: read this book and experience the true magic of Dragonlance.  <br />These books were written back in an era of fantasy now past, when Dungeons &amp; Dragons was still in its first edition and books went hand in hand with roleplaying modules so eager readers could relive the adventure themselves.  To this day, I'm not quite sure which came first with the Dragonlance saga, but the Chronicles don't suffer much if at all through being written as part of a roleplaying game.  In fact, the authors' note explains several events as the product of roleplaying sessions, but this is by no means evident in the text itself.  Weis and Hickman succeed tremendously in creating characters who are more than just puppets for their players, who live and breathe, think and feel in their own right.<br />This, above all other factors, is what distinguishes the original Dragonlance novels from the many spurious books of similar genre that were written before, concurrently with and since their creation (and from the many forgettable Dragonlance spin-offs themselves): vivid and lasting characterisation.  I first read these books a decade ago, yet I still remember the characters as old friends and look forward to rejoining them when next I go to the bookshelf in a moment of nostalgia.<br />This is not to imply, however, that other essential elements such as plot, action and style are missing from this book.  Far from it: the story rushes headlong through one adventure after another, while the plot is both complex and intriguing.  Without being didactic, the authors manage to build up a complete and convincing picture of the magical world of Krynn.<br />Other books may have dated the Dragonlance Chronicles, superseded them in imagination, but they will always remain in my memory as classic favourites.  A definite must-have for fantasy readers of all ages.
B00005BF9Z|2.0|Cute and catchy when you first hear it, but it's really repetative.  Bored with it after a week.  C'est vrai, c'est du rechauffe.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I love this movie, I have the VHS tape and just bought the DVD, well with Wide Screen about 6inches of the movie was blacked out on top and bottom,3inches on top and bottom, this is a waste since I only have a 20 inch tv, most wide screen movies cut a inch or 2 of the top and bottom, this was a ripp off, who really cares about wide screen,it's just a gimmick to make more money when they re release a new version and some add a disc and charge you extra money for behind the scenes footage, you don't need a extra disc for that,like the new Die Hard Collection, about 30 bucks for more behind the scenes stuff, Armageddon is my favorite movie, but the wide screen version is a rip off, but this movie is better than deep impact,I hate wide screen dvds, why can't we have a choice, like put it on the other side of the same disc, the movie industry is just sucking more money out of the movies fans.....
0141301104|5.0|I highly recommend The Witches to the young and old alike. It is a masterpiece of a book because it is sowed with layers of humor and philosophical seeds that each age group will fin and positively grown from.  I've realized how Roald Dahl's writings have positively affected me after going over his works a decade after I read them for the first time in 5th grade.<br />  The Witches is about a child and his grandmother who has had an encounter with witches and thus explains to her grandson how to avoid these women (who look just like ordinary women but have blue spit, no toes, wear gloves to hide their claws and itchy wigs to hide their bald heads).  Because of Grandma's sickness, the two go to stay in a hotel on the coast of England where it just so turns out that hundreds of these child-despising witches are holding their national conference to announce the plan to wipe out the existence of \\"dog dropping\\" smelling children by turning them into mice!  The adventurous outcome, which I won't reveal, is very humorous and unexpected.<br />  The plot is both attractive and fascinating because it is out of this Disney perfect world.  Because of this I think kids get the feeling like they've got their hands on something really hot and this gives them a lot of excitement and sparks their imagination.  They're used to hearing about how witches get crushed under houses from Kansas and how terrible it is to smoke.  And then they come across this book in which witches get away with hating kids and Grandma often offers her grandson a hit off her cigar.  They're used to reading books written by authors who write very dryly and with vocabulary words that one may find on a college entrance exam.  But Roald Dahl writes in a language that is enlivened by hilarious tongue-twisting and silly vulgar words, and most importantly, it is a language understandable by (but not limited to) children.<br />  For those parents who may have doubts in Roald Dahl because some of his books were banned by anal, unhappy, conservative, old librarians, from personal experience I'd like to say that his books will not only have a positive impact on the fortunate read, but that there is even a glowing difference between Dahl-readers and non-Dahl readers.  I can't stress the importance of having a child, (or you as well if you haven't already) read Dahl books.  Because of Dahl's creative language, imaginative and ironic plot, his books work like magical fertilizer that kids are nourished by.  Once a child has experienced a Roald Dahl book his/her mind begins to open up and bloom, it's inspired to invent, create and accept all but to believe all with a grain of salt.  They will become aware and be more likely to appreciate the multicolored reality of a world in which we live in and where everything and anything is possible.  I can't think of more positive values for a child to grow on.  If you don't understand what good an open-mind and imagination do, let me tell you that most vile acts that take place in this world are caused by narrow-minded people who's imagination was never inspired to look beyond their own desires and who, most likely and unfortunately, were deprived of Roald Dahl as a child.banned by anal, unhappy, conservative, old librarians, from personal experience I'd like to say that his books will not only have a positive impact on the fortunate read, but that there is even a glowing difference between Dahl-readers and non-Dahl readers.

B00000G3PA|5.0|I love this movie, I have the VHS tape and just bought the DVD, well with Wide Screen about 6inches of the movie was blacked out on top and bottom,3inches on top and bottom, this is a waste since I only have a 20 inch tv, most wide screen movies cut a inch or 2 of the top and bottom, this was a ..., who really cares about wide screen,it's just a gimmick to make more money when they re release a new version and some add a disc and charge you extra money for behind the scenes footage, you don't need a extra disc for that,like the new Die Hard Collection, about 30 bucks for more behind the scenes stuff, Armageddon is my favorite movie, but the wide screen version is a ..., but this movie is better than deep impact,I hate wide screen dvds, why can't we have a choice, like put it on the other side of the same disc, the movie industry is just ...more money out of the movies fans.....
0451169514|5.0|Seven friends, one monster in many forms.  Have you ever wondered what you're biggest fear is?  Once you read It, you'll realize you have many.  I started reading King in '96 with The Green Mile.  I quickly became an addict and am almost through with all of his books.  It is by far the most intriguing and haunting book I have ever read.  The reader follows these seven children through things that would make a grown man scream like a little girl.  Yet, maybe it is because they are children, they suffer through It not once, but twice.  This book is scary and sad and funny.  You experience every emotion while reading this and at the end you realize that you have completely fallen in love with Bill, Bevvie, Ben, Stan, Mike, Eddie, and Richie.  My personal favorite is Ben.  The movie version of this book is also good, but it can never compare to the experience of reading It for the first time.  READ THIS BOOK!!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|We've all been hoodwinked!  The movie was terrible in the theatres and it's even worse on DVD.  Why?  Because in addition to the insult to our collective intelligence that is the film, we are also treated to a pontificating George Lucas yapping about making movies on the extra features disc.  The much ballyhooed 'deleted scenes' are nothing more than elaborations on the already terrible acting and &quot;look what we can do&quot; special effects in the movie.  Worse though, George Lucas drones on about how 'difficult it was to cut these scenes'.  Please, let me at it, I have no such compunctions.  For shame!

0441172717|5.0|This title I beleive is truly mindblowing.  I don't often read but from the moment I started reading Dune I could not put it down. Frank Herbert's universe is so real you often find yourself believing the content as real, only reminding yourself later you are reading \\"science fiction\\" in the good old 21st century. The native Fremen of Dune are depicted in such amazing depth with entire historic, spiritual and religious backgrounds. They have they're own language and religion stemming from their native planet, and all explanations of this flow so logically and realistically.<br />All characters, populations, places and events get the same treatment, and as you delve further through the Dune novels only then do you realise how truly epic and powerful Herbert's vision is, from entire population level events to the intricate spirituality within the minds of his characters. <br />This book is not about anything in particular, a friends words were \\"It's about life.\\" Mind enhancing ..., spritituality, religion, genetic manipulation, technology, love, death are all delved into. You will find yourself asking \\"what if?\\", if only a fraction of Herbert's imagination was possible in the future.<br />Read this book. You will only gain insight.
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is for the person who is still waiting for Warner Brothers (the &quot;philistines&quot; according to you) to stop &quot;being colossally stupid and actually release the entire film.&quot;  This is it, buddy.  This DVD is, in fact, presented in the correct aspect ratio.  It is not pan &amp; scan, nor did they, as you so eloquently put it, chop &quot;half or more of the film off before releasing it!&quot;  Take a deep breath and enjoy.
B00000064G|5.0|In 1972, Nick Drake, just twenty-four years old, felt beaten. The Cambridge singer/songwriter's two previous LPs, although excellent, had gained little attention and a severe case of clinical depression was clouding his emotions. Now it was time for Drake to reluctantly enter a studio and fulfill his three-record contract with Island Records. The resulting work, Pink Moon, is one of those rare occurrences when a genuine sense of dread and sadness saturates through the recording studio wires and unto tape, captivating more focused and dedicated listeners. A mild mannered Drake recorded these eleven songs, clocking in less than thirty minutes, with just an acoustic guitar and his delicate, beatific voice, where his previous albums found Nick's songs backed with a think layer of accompaniment. The music does not suffer in the least, though. Drake's sturdy guitar strumming, always his secret weapon, makes this some of the lushest music ever recorded with only an acoustic guitar. Pink Moon is a superb album, containing much of the best of Drake's brand of starry, heartfelt songs, including the sentimental, yet fearful title track, the bleak &quot;Place to Be&quot; and the touching &quot;From the Morning.&quot; Yet, Drake explores some distinctly new teritory with the paranoiac &quot;Parasite&quot; and the rhythmic &quot;Free Ride&quot; and &quot;Harvest Breed.&quot; When finished with Pink Moon, Nick left the master tapes on Island Record's reception desk and quietly walked away, remorsefully withdrawing from the music business. Sadly his death from an overdose of anti-depressants followed two years later. Nick Drake never realized what an exceptional young talent he truly was. This album stands as the most emotional, bare boned reason why he so underestimated himself.
0880796863|4.0|I found this book excellent for me... Now is the book I use to guide me when I forget some significances or I want a second opinion. The cards are not what I expected, the coloring is very dark so you cannot notice some details in the pictures, but nevertheless I use them everyday and I have learned to love my cards.
B000002KAT|2.0|In 1968, Van Morrison, teamed with a collection of local jazz musicians and spent two days in a New York City recording studio to record Astral Weeks. The lack of time invested in the project and the jazz section's unfamiliarity with Morrison and rock music are fairly evident. The tracks, eight of them taking up forty-seven minutes, start out mildly pretty but sprawl out for a generous multitude of time with little development. Occasionally Morrison's brawny vocals will rise up and draw in the musical pap bacl from dullness, but never enough to save blatherers like \\"Madame George,\\" \\"Ballerina\\" and \\"Beside You.\\" The spring-ish title song and the passionate \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\" are Astral Week's only thoroughly enjoyable moments. Morrison's lyrics are vastly overrated. They are occasionally sweet, but too predictably sentimental to be very striking. This overrated album sounds like what might have been a mildly enjoyable work stuck in its earliest, roughest demo stages.
B00005LMBK|2.0|&quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; is a good song, but take it from me: Don't listen to it too much or else you will hate it.  There are one or two other good songs, but they also get old.  This Cd isn't great.  The band is cool and &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; is worth having on a mix, but I would advise not to buy this CD
B000002UB3|2.0|Although, many fans consider the legendary Beatles' final album their best, try as I may, I just can not see Abbey Road as anything great. \\"Oh! Darling,\\" \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Octopus' Garden\\" are just silly, the song suite on the second side is well constructed but utterly confused and jumbled and \\"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\\" becomes very tedious. Only \\"Come Together,\\" \\"Something,\\" \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and the cool cover image reflect the band's past greatness. You may enjoy it. Many do. But I would recommend  Revolver, Sgt. Pepper's, the white album and even lesser acclaimed Beatles albums such as Magical Mystery Tour and Let It Be before the weak silliness of Abbey Road.
B00004XONN|1.0|Can you say nap time?  This amazing band completely lost me on this album.  It seems to be just a repetitive drone.  What happend to guitars?
B000003S16|3.0|Robert Fripp, guitarist and leader of chief progressive rock outfit, King Crimson, broke apart the group's second incarnation in 1974, several years ahead of the rest of the music world in growing tired of \\"dinosaur bands.\\" Fripp claimed that he would rather work as a \\"small, intelligent, self-sufficient, mobile unit\\" (whatever that means). After session work on the albums of other's for years, 1979's Exposure is the first solo work by this unit. Despite the fact that this album features some of progressive and experimental rock's top artists, such as Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Tony Levin and Peter Hamill, disapproval for the longwinded, bloated nature of 70s progrock bands, such as Genesis and Emerson, Lake and Palmer is evident in that Exposure mainly consists of concise, artpop songs, some of which are quite nice. \\"North Star\\" is a cheery song, nicely sung by Hamill. The wavy title track is another high point. The best moment on Exposure is truly its excellent version of Gabriel's sullen \\"Here Comes the Flood,\\" creatively buttressed by \\"Water Music I,\\" featuring a spoken word part on environmental changes and the thin misty sound of \\"Water Music II.\\" But other songs such as the overly thrasy \\"You Burn Me Up I'm a Cigarette\\" and \\"Disengage\\" and the heated, paranoic \\"Haaden Two\\" and \\"Ny3\\" sound so utterly unconvincing and amature that one wishes to stop Exposure and turn on a favorite Crimson disc. Surely it is better to be the biggest and best of the \\"dinosaur bands\\" than to sound so aquward in artrock posture. With the punk rock wave a few years behind them and the more agreeable new wave on its way, Fripp led some of the cream of the progrock crop to an experiment with a simpler, updated, Talking Head/Television-ish artrock on Exposure and they got mixed results. Several times, the wavy, unfussy nature of the music is a breath of fresh  air, other times the proud muscle and sure sound of the Crimson King is missed.
0790742780|2.0|The premise for &quot;Falling Down,&quot; a man whose sanity is shattered by the everyday evils of society, is admittedly a strong one, something that a talented director could have taken into intriguing waters. Unfortunately, Joel Schumacher, the director who turned the Batman film series from the creme de la creme to the creme de la crap, takes a promising concept and guts the essence out of it, turning it into a paper-thin, uninteresting exercise in exsess that ignores serious issues and makes little sense.  Instead of allowing Douglas' character to grow angry and desperate in subtle ways, the way countless better directors would've done, we have Douglas shooting bazookas into the sewers to blow up a bridge.  Worse yet, he learned how to fire the weapon from a young child who thught he was filming a movie (believe me when I say that kids aren't that stupid).  His first violent breakdown happens ten minutes into the movie, throwing buildup to the winds and putting a temper tantrum against an Aisan stereotype in its place (one of many stereotypes; none of these characters are very realistic).  Every explosion of anger is simply that; an explosion, something too far-fetched to be convincing.  Then again, perhaps that could be said of all of Shcumacher's work: too big, too sensational, too shallow to be compelling.  The film does benefit from a strong cast (Douglas is perfect at playing intensity), but it's simply not enough.  Avoid.
B00000064E|5.0|Each album made by this cult hero from the 70's British folk movement, is quite impressive, but Nick Drake's 1969 debut, Five Leaves Left may be his best. Drake's strongly plucked acoustic guitar finds a warm home with the guesting chamber music instruments and together they create an almost flawless, misty, rainy atmosphere, which permeates through all of Nick's top class songs. It is astonishing that a young man in his early twenties is so vastly adept to writing wise, heartfelt songs such as \\"Cello Song\\" and \\"Time Will Tell Me\\" or songs as profound as \\"Three Hours\\" or \\"Fruit Tree,\\" the last of which eerily forecasts Nick's posthumous rise from overlooked singer/songwriter to cult hero. \\"Safe in your place deep in the earth/That's when they'll know what you were really worth/Forgotten while you're here/Remembered for a while/A much updated ruin/From a much outdated style.\\" Although, Drake would sadly never live to see his work at all appreciated, many more experienced and popular songwriters are trying desperately for the skillfully executed eeriness and unpretentious thoughtfulness mastered on Five Leaves Left.
0380796090|5.0|I tend not to get descriptive in my reviews of the books I'm rating because you can see that in all of the other reviews.  I just wanted to say that I loved this book!  I also just read &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; by Marian Keys and loved that too.  I believe she also wrote &quot;Lucy Sullivan is Getting Married&quot; and that was great too.  So, to sum up, I think it's safe to say that Marian Keyes is a great author!
B00000AFDW|2.0|Fans of the Original KISS saw this album as a dream come true: Gene, Paul, Ace &amp; Peter back together and in the studio cranking out a new KISS album! Great concept, however, the cd is clearly a typical Gene &amp; Paul album with a bunch of studio musicians rounding things out. This has been admitted by each band member by now: Ace and Peter barely played on this. What was the point of that? Go purchase &quot;Asylum&quot; or &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; if you want to hear the 'Gene &amp; Paul Project' that KISS became after Ace and Peter left the band. These guys should have locked themselves in a rehearsal loft like the old days and created REAL KISS music again! What a horrible disappointment this album is.<BR>As for the actual tunes, things get off to a pretty good start with the title track and &quot;Within&quot; (even though this song is clearly a &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; leftover). From there, we are left with a bunch of self-aware hackneyed anthems about the band, the fans, and what they have meant to each other. The only other redeeming tune is Gene's final song on the album which could have fit nicely onto &quot;Destroyer&quot; back in 1976. <BR>One hopes that before KISS calls it quits, they will make an album that features only Gene, Paul, Ace, and Peter singing, writing, and playing. Give us an actual Original KISS album in the incredible tradition of KISS, Hotter Than Hell, Dressed To Kill, Alive, and Rock And Roll Over. Give us the four guys who started this whole thing - there's nothing like Gene, Paul, Ace, &amp; Peter together.
0767903862|3.0|Mr Bryson undoubtedly is, as well as an original thinker who should also provoke thought in others.<br />Funny that in 10 years of living in Australia, I never encountered any of the life-threatening creatures he writes so obsessively about - were they more interesting than the people?<br />The bizarre fetish for creatures less likely to cross your path than a flash of lightening would put anyone off traveling anywhere : you know, Canada has cougars, bears and wolves; Italy has earthquakes and volcanoes; for many Europeans the US is frightening because of the large number of citizens who own guns.<br />Funny that anyone from North America should presume (as Mr. Bryson offers to do at the end of Chapter 17) to advise the Australian government on its policies regarding indigenous (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Australians.  I remember learning a lot in French high school about Wounded Knee and other wars, battles and forced removals committed in North America by colonists on the indigenous peoples.  <br />Not so funny : the problems of aboriginal Australians' and aboriginal Americans' health.

B000003TSP|5.0|The culmination of every album ever released that tried to capture the feeling one gets when watching a classic horror movie.  So perfect it boggles my mind--so beautiful it defies criticism.  Know why it doesn't sound like &quot;Dummy&quot;?  Because it's more complete, more varied and absolutely timeless.  Trip-hop without the stoner trappings, this is an album for everyone who enjoys the darker side of life.  Morose without being sad, subtle without being unapproachable.  Nothing ever captured on tape is more head-spinningly, heart-achingly gorgeous than the strings in &quot;Humming&quot;.  Listen to this through headphones in a completely silent room and you'll never look back.

The piano solo is cool.<BR>TRACK 3: &quot;Just A Girl&quot;: The first No Doubt song I ever heard. Lots of energy, overall good song.<BR>TRACK 4: &quot;Happy Now?&quot;: My FAVORITE SONG on the cd. It's my first resort for stress relief. You can hear her passion in her words.<BR>TRACK 5: &quot;Different People&quot;: It's ok, I guess. I don't really listen to it.<BR>TRACK 6: &quot;Hey You&quot;: This song has yet another funkadelic beat you can't help but love. Very otherworldly.<BR>TRACK 7: &quot;The Climb&quot;: My second favorite song on the CD. It's so beautiful and artistic.<BR>TRACK 8: &quot;Sixteen&quot;: In my opinion, this is the most energetic song on the CD, therefore I like it.<BR>TRACK 9: &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;: Great song, but it seems like there aren't a lot of lyrics.<BR>TRACK 10: &quot;Don't Speak&quot;: The calm song, it's just as beautiful as &quot;The Climb.&quot;<BR>TRACK 11: &quot;You Can Do It&quot;: Very cool. Simply put, Very cool.<BR>TRACK 12: &quot;World Go Round&quot;: I don't like this song at all. The only bad song on the cd.<BR>TRACK 13: &quot;End It On This&quot;: I Lo0o0o0ove this song.

0385470819|5.0|John Grisham did an absolutely wonderful job on his book &quot;A Time  to Kill.&quot;  It was the most engrossing book that I have ever picked up.  Ignoring precedents, Grisham addresses one of the biggest problems in America, racism.  With the story of a young black girl being raped and a father willing to take the law into his own hands, Grisham grabs your heart and breaks it in half.  He also  exposes many prejudices in people and many faults in our system. He uses highly emotional events and the ignorance of many as a means to make  people realize how it feels to be on the receiving side of racism.  No one can read this book and not feel the same as this girl's father, black or white.  He makes everyone realize that they would to the same thing in a similar situation, and then you put the book down and happen to remember that she was black.
B00003CXTF|5.0|This has got to be absolutely one of the best movies ever made in my own opinion! When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I figured it was just going to be another war movie... but I was way off! Well... of course it is a war movie but it also has a very interesting love story too! For some reason... critics said that the love story totally ruined the movie... I absolutely disagree 100%! That love story kept my eyes glued to the screen! I loved this movie because it made you laugh and cry at the same time and I don't think my eyes went off the screen once! This movie just mesmerizes you the moment you start watching! I don't think this was just another typical war movie because you got to really know the characters on a personal basis and when something happened to them... you really cared and felt like you were losing your own loved one in a way! The actual bombing scene was spectacular! They had awesome visual effects... it really felt like it was happening right before your very eyes! The cast was excellent... I was always a Josh Hartnett fan so that was one of the main reasons I went... and am I glad that I did! Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale did spectacular also! After seeing this movie, I got really interested in researching wars... in particular World War II! I think this movie really raised people's awareness of what really happened in American History! I also think that it raised people's patriotism too... and that's especially important with all that is happening ever since September 11th! So please... if you are considering buying the video... please do! I know for a fact that you won't regret it!
B000006YMN|5.0|I was most excited when I received this CD from a friend of mine in Europe.  As usual 6 months to a year, it was also released in the USA on Atlantic Records.  (I have both the CD and LP from Atlantic).  This was quite a change for Agnetha's solo work.  She is stronger, more confident, and there is nothing bad on this CD.  Agnetha looks better than ever as well in leather and that daring hairstyle!  While having friends in Europe, I was able to get a few of the singles and extended remixes related to this CD.  Wouldn't it be wonderful if this were remastered with the remixes as well as the 2 or 3 songs she recorded for this release for Spain and Argentina?
B00005KHJR|5.0|Without repeating the usual &quot;Time&quot; debate i have only but praise for this incredible dvd package. Before i got this dvd i had only the Theatrical version on VHS which i had seen countless times. But was i surprised to see the extended version, this version has much more substance and is way better than the Theatrical version. The picture i must say is not that great, actually compared to the Theatrical version it's a bad transfer, but don't let that put you off, this is the version you should defintely have if you have in the past seen the wicker man and enjoyed it. As for the extra features they are a delight, even the hidden easter egg is good. Well the only negative thing to say is that i have read on the net that this is to be remade with Nicolas Cage playing Howie. God forbid this happens even if they spent $100million they cannot make anything better than this, this movie was made from the heart and not for profit. As Christopher Lee says in the documentary this is the best movie he has ever made and he was not paid a single cent for it. So Cage stick to your usual trash movies you make and leave the Wicker man alone.
6305313687|3.0|A young man is seduced into a Nazi type organization after the death of his father. He brutally murders a group of black criminals. This scene is the defining moment of the film and while not being exceptionally bloody onscreen, the implied violence is grotesque. The act is probably witnessed by police coming on scene, he is arrested sent to prison. In prison he finds that black people arent all bad and white supremacists arent all good. When he gets out of jail he tries to rescue his girlfriend and brother from the nazis. This movie has problems staying balanced. The story prior to his arrest builds dramatically until the murders. Once he tries to find safety in prison the movie tries and fails to show exactly what changes his hate. There is an attempt to show a friendship with an inmate but it is shallow, allowing the character to transform by breaks in time rather than soul searching on-screen. Once he is out, his friends and relatives dont understand and wont accept his change, leading to defining moments with his brother, girlfriend and the Neo Nazi leader. Edward Norton is excellent. He shows the dominant personality and aggressiveness needed to make the film realistic. But, the later scenes require more from the supporting cast and they simply arent up to the challenge. The side plots (including the ending) are entirely predictable. Enough so to make the film a dissapointment. There is theme lifted from the Godfather films: redemption is not anough and the price for hate must be paid, so they force a useless tragedy on the film. Unless you demand blood in your movies about hate, try a better movie like Malcolm X, or To Kill a Mockingbird
B000021Y74|5.0|Besides having great camera angles, and an original techno music it explains life and the concept of pre - destination, that we can't control opur lives. The time period is re runned three times, and in each time something trivial happens to Lola , in this case falling down, getting scared and jumping, and that trivial event changes her life, and the life of strangers (which very cleverly the director portrays as she runs)<br />Well it is a movie definately worth seeing, hearing and thinking about.

B000006TRV|5.0|In 1979, The greatest rock band in the universe produced a double concept album that would produce some of the greatest songs they created.  David Gilmore's guitar work is at its best, with songs like comfertably numb and another brick in the wall.  If you haven't gotten this album yet, BUY IT NOW!  Do not even think about it, if you love trippy music, pink floyd, or impressive guitar work, do not think, just buy.  This concept album based on the lives of bassist Roger Waters and former guitarist syd barret is chilling and beautiful. It is my personal favorite and I know I am not alone in that category.
B00003CXSP|5.0|&quot;It's not thrilling enough.&quot;  &quot;I hated the ending.&quot;  &quot;The book was much better.&quot;<br />Well -- of course!<br />Hannibal is a five-star movie, precisely for the reasons most people seem to hate it.  Silence of the Lambs was a thriller.  Hannibal is a character study.  So of course it isn't as thrilling.  But what about the pure voyueristic thrill of spending time deep inside the skull of our favorite Good Doctor?  I'll take that over a basement gunfight (ala Silence) any day.<br />The ending.  Yes, this is controversial.  But the book ending (I won't give away anything here) simply couldn't be done in a movie.  There's just no way for Clarice The Pursuer of the movies to make the same character leap as Clarice The Rescuer of books.  Given that, you simply have to admit the new ending is clever, fun, exiting, and oh-so-appropriate.  Watch it again and tell me you're not squirming, trying to decide who is predator and who is prey and who you want to &quot;win.&quot;<br />&quot;The book was better.&quot;  Can't argue there.  Name any movie better than the book.  So why should that complaint count?<br />Watch Hannibal again.
6304341849|5.0|Merchant Ivory has been ridiculed in recent years for its \\"costume dramas,\\" not because they are bad, but because they are so complete.  The ridicule has mostly been targeted at them through critics of Helena Bonham Carter, who is arguably the first lady of Merchant Ivory type films.<br />With that arbitrary preamble out of the way, let's get to Maurice.  In the early 1980's most films of a controversial nature were little independent films long on good intentions but short on creative ability or writing.  Maurice was very different:  it was based on a classic (and once banned) novel by a famous author, and it was created lovingly and painstakingly by the Acadamy Award winning production company of Merchant Ivory.<br />A story about two college men in love with each other in Edwardian England is the basic premise for the movie.  However, the turmoil that usually accompanies such homosexual relationships today is compounded because of the time in which this story is set.  Class differences, ambition, secrecy, false marriages, and deceit are the undercurrents which drive this film to its moving and emotionally satisfying (if rather unbelievable) conclusion....<br />Unrealistic ending aside, this is a beautiful film.  The scenery and the period detail is typical Merchant Ivory - in other words  - impeccable!  The script is right on.  The acting - superb.  This is the film that really began Hugh Grant's screen career.  In fact, this is a big budget Hollywood film masquerading as a small arthouse film (or is it the other way round).<br />Regardless, rent this film and see if you don't agree.<br />Wonderful!

Well, The book was so good I read it in about three hours. The book really intreged me. I twas very interesting and had a lot of interesting facts. The main stroy goes like this. An insomniac can't sleep and is told if he wants to see pain go to this support group for men with cancer. HE goes and although he isn't dying he cry when the men get int one-on-one groups. After that he can finally sleep. Then Marla Singe, another faker, ruins it all. The narrator can't cry with another faker in the room so he and MArla split up the groups. Then while on a bussiness trip he meet a man named Tyler Durden. The narrator is intreged by Tyler's weird nature and asks what Tyler does. Tyler give him a bussiness card. Once off the plane the narrator finds out his luggage was vibrating and the Airline wouldn't allow it to go on the plane. When the narrator gets home to his condo complex he finds out that it is no longer ther. It was litterally blown up. He calls Tyler to see if he can stay with him. They meet at a bar and have some drinks and then they fight. That is how the create fight club. The story progresses at a good rate but is confusing sometimes, I think, if you haven't seen the movie. The book had a good stroyline and Is one of the best book's I've ever read, although it was not very descriptive. I give it five stars and I think it is one of the best books of the 90's.
B000056K04|5.0|There was never any doubt we had poets in Hunter and Garcia ... Winwood and Page (yes, Page!. But then we were awash with Disco where somehow a driving thumping beat became more important to the prevailing music than the words.<br />I started hearing the WORDS again with Adam Duritz (Counting Crows) and, of course, Sarah McLachlan. They didn't have to rhyme or match each time we came back to the chorus (how monotonous) ... and they had meaning.<br />So a few years ago I actually paused to figure out why anyone would write a song about ants marching and realized Dave Matthews was writing about ants at all.<br />I was driving in the car a few weeks ago with my boyfriend of 15 years when &quot;The Space Between&quot; came on. He very quietly said &quot;listen.&quot; And though I had heard the song played over and over, it was the first time I heard the words - and, perhaps, a message he wanted me to hear as well.<br />The songs that hold those messages for us so that we can share them are always treasures.<br />I know this album has been bashed for what many believe is a more commercial approach to its production but, I truly feel this is a further evolving Dave Matthews and a hint of something even greater to come. I am really pleased to add it to my collection.
B00003CXAA|3.0|it's great to finally have this collection on dvd finally but....watching pt.3 is awaste of time and space and the quality of 1+2 is only fair.there are some parts of pt.1 where the the dubbing is obviously off.to put it nicely;the black levels of my t.v. was seriously challenged by the numerous dark scenes in this movie.i though either the dvd was defective or someone tampered with my video settings(niether of tha above).for 70 bucks this pkg. is dissappointing.....in a perfect world,these dvd's could have been pkged individually with all the extras on the first 2 movies so i wouldn't have to purchase the third.  don't rush to get this one......or get used(depreciated.i'm ready to send this back to it's maker for a full refund...
0451203933|5.0|The amazing story of the 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia in which 18 US soldiers were killed, along with many 100's of Somali's presumed dead. This story is very relevant to the current situation (in October 2001) where we are trying to use traditional military action to capture a single person. In 1993, we were trying to apprehend &quot;warlord&quot; Mohamed Farrah Aidid - and today we are going after Osama bin Laden.<br />Our critical mistake in this episode was drastically underestimating the enemy. While we had every advantage in terms of technology and military hardware, the Somali's had on their side sheer numbers of fighters as well as their determined willingness to fight regardless of the dangers to their own lives. Time and again, Somali fighters would put themselves in direct fire of the US forces to attack, usually being killed in the process. Another Somali fighter would then pick up their weapon and take their place. This went on for 12 to 18 hours in a house-to-house street battle that kept the relatively small force of Americans pinned down all night.<br />Like the movies Saving Private Ryan and Three Kings this book depicts a very graphic image of war and battle. While I do believe that there are things we need to be willing to fight for, every one of us needs to understand the type of situation we are asking our military to go in to.

0784011214|4.0|Now,what can I say about First blood part 2?The original Rambo was a good film,dealing with some serious issues,and Stallone played the magnificently.This one however has the look and feel of a studio cash cow!However,the storyline,acting and effects more than make up for any doubts you may have about the production values.<BR>There are some great scenes here,especially Rambo's helicoptor raid on the camp,and the scene where he kills about a dozen Soviet soldiers.There are too a few emotional scenes thrown in,like when his love interest eventually buys it at the hands of a chinless vietnamese officer,and you can feel the anger when he hunts down Murdoch at the end!<BR>A great action movie!Buy it right now!

B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is shot backwards.  The last scene is basically the first, while the first is the conclusion.  If that's not confusing enough, the main character is trying to solve his wife's murder.  Here's the catch---he in unable to make memories.  He has no short term memory so he has to write the clues on Polaroids that he has taken.  He also tatoos the clues onto his skin.  This man is a freak, but quite interesting.  As the movie plays backword, you are formulating the clues yourself in order to solve this mystery.  If you do not like to pause movies, YOU WILL NOT WANT TO LEAVE YOUR SEAT TO USE THE BATHROOM OR GET A BEER OR A SNACK.

0784010501|4.0|The thought of creating a documentary of Madonna seemed like a two-edged sword: on one edge, the idea seemed brilliant; she was diverese and eccentric, filled with glamour and demanding.  On the other edge, it seemed overwhelmingly tacky and pathetic to document such a famous person's life while they toured the world.  But, it's Madonna.  That first edge, filled with optimism, ended up becoming the dominating slice of critics.<br />Filled with quite amusing and extravagent scenes, &quot;Truth Or Dare&quot; explores a different side to the everyday life we expect to see from a superstar.  This documentary, however, follows Madonna during her infamous Blonde Ambition World Tour (which had, incidently, been banned by the Vatican for its gratuitous sex and references towards the Catholic Church).  Filmed in a clear black and white film that adds an impressive artistic touch, we wander through the busy and often unorganized life of Madonna.  I must emphasize that not discussing scenes directly only allows for the entertainment of the film to be more enjoyable; it allows for a mystery that can just widen your eyes as you begin to view the footage.<br />There are beautifully filmed scenes from her stage show as well, shown in a bright color contrast to that black and white of the rest of the film.  Interwined with the run-around footage, it conforms to piece together an incredible documentary that still remains unprecedented in its presentation, its format and its content.<br />Madonna's more edgier and often more problematic attitude that had been given off in her early 1990's days are clearly shown in the film; quite an amazing contradiction to the more laid-back, mother-oriented Madonna of the millennium (although she hasn't changed her way at viewing the world; in her recent Drowned World Tour, she continues to spit, cuss, flip-off and not give a care as to what anyone would think of it...She still does what she wants, a proud and admirable quality that many of us wishwe had the nerve to hold.)<br />All in all, &quot;Truth or Dare&quot; is unlike any documentary and certainly unlike many other films.  It brings a light into a shadow that is rarely uncovered and offers an amazing glimpse into such an unknown territory.  Unforgettable, it remains a true testament to the art of the documentary.
B00005JKOV|5.0|I went into this movie not knowing what to expect.  I didn't know the storyline or anything, all I had heard was something about it being redone so it looked like impressionistic paintings.  Boy, I was in for a surprise.  The movie absolutely shocked me, and not in a bad way.  It was extremely intense and well thought out.  It was also very trippy and thrilling.  It kept me watching the whole time.  The movie had seemed long when I heard it ran for 96 minutes, but when those minutes were over with I said &quot;Wow, that went really fast&quot;.  It had it's very interesting elements, and was very thought-provoking.  I went with my film club and we all agreed that we wanted to see it again and watch it part by part because so much information was being shot at you the whole time.  The style of the film, visually that is, was unique (and of course, that was it's claim to popularity).  The scenes are constantly moving, a fluid motion.  The backgrounds are never stationery and at first I thought I would get seasick/motion sickness, but it ended up just calming me, and made me focus more on what the characters were saying.  Overall the thoughts that were being thrown out there were all valid in their own ways.  I could easily agree with many of them with more knowledge and time with these people.  The dialogue, on whole, even though not very emotional, was very well done and highly imaginative.  I don't know what more to say about this film but that it is certainly worth seeing, some make think it's boring, but if one wants something different and usual and very intensely aimed towards thinking, then go for it.  You won't be disappointed.
0141301074|5.0|I actually read this one out loud to my daughter not once but twice, first in 1993 when she was living with me in Chicago, and then again in 1994 over the phone when she was living in Massachusetts with her mother.  If I had not heard from other sources that Roald Dahl was not an especially pleasant person, I believe that I could have guessed this from his books.  There is a bit of inspired nastiness in all of them, but this one might be the nastiest of the bunch.  THE TWITS is the story of a married couple who brood on new ways to make the life of their spouse as miserable as possible.  Dahl's genius is to create utterly unique ways for two people to play bizarrely original and extravagant dirty tricks on one another.  My daughter loved this both times I read it to her (after she learned to read on her own, she reread it on her own), and I have to admit that I enjoyed reading it to her.<br />This might not be good for all parents, though it is certainly great for nearly all kids.  If you are the kind of parent who believes Bart Simpson inspires kids to be bad, skip this one.  But if you want to have a really great time with your kid, read them this one.  Even now, as I remember my daughter's reaction to hearing Mr. Twit convince his wife that she had the shrinks, I get a little twitter (no pun intended) inside.
B00005QG9J|4.0|This album is really really good! There's absolutely no disputing that. Incubus is good at what they do.<BR>But I MUST ask, what happened to S.C.I.E.N.C.E.?? Where's the sound experimentation, crazed funk, the DJ-oriented tracks, the Secret songs, etc.<br />Where's the Magic Medecine that got me into Incubus in the first place? It began to dwindle during the Make Yourself days, and now it can be considered all but gone! I'm surprised Kilmore even has a position in the band's lineup now. I think I heard him about 4 or 5 times in the whole CD.<br />Don't get me wrong - this is a great album in it's own rite. Songs like Wish You Were Here, Blood On The Ground, and Under My Umbrella are very good examples! They're catchy and well-written.<BR>Even so, I miss the old Incubus....
0140430350|5.0|While there are many lovely and funny things in this book, the degree to which one is likely to enjoy this novel depends upon how one responds to Becky Sharp.  Thackeray does a marvelous job of setting forth both her very considerable charms and her undeniable flaws.  On the one hand she is irresistibly charming, lovable, vivacious, beautiful, a brilliant conversationalist, charismatic, delightfully flirtatious, and immensely talented.  On the other hand, she is deceitful, unfaithful, untruthful, grasping, and manipulative.  Myself, I loved Becky, and consider her to be one of the most thrilling anti-heroines in English literature.<br />This novel is simply a great read.  Like any good Victorian classic, there is an amazing array of wonderful characters.  Unlike many similar novels, where you always know that all of the main characters are going to end up married--the only impediments being how the lovers will be united (the great exception being Trollope, where everyone might end up married, or everyone might end up not; he is a very difficult to anticipate storyteller)--I found it difficult to anticipate who would end up with whom.<br />The historical period is the same as for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but while in that awesome novel the Napoleonic Wars merely provided a pretext for having soldiers present in towns for balls, in this novel the War is very, very much a War, and as such exerts a strong influence on the plot.  In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE there is no hint that soldiers might actually have to fight and perhaps die.

0679722610|5.0|This is not my favorite Dashiell Hammett book, but there is no such thing . . . well, I was going to say that there was no such thing as a bad Dashiell Hammett book, but then I remembered that the last couple of things he wrote, when he was trying to write \\"literature\\" instead of extraordinary hardboiled stories.  There is, however, no such animal as a bad Continental Op story, and this is one of the Op's adventures.  One of the most lamentable situations in contemporary publishing is the rather small number of Op stories in print.  It is occasionally possible to turn up one of the old anthology of Op stories that Hammett published in BLACK MASK, but these are getting harder and harder to find (though several of them recently appeared in the new Library of America edition of Hammett's stories).  BLACK MASK itself put out in the late forties, I believe, several issues collecting the otherwise uncollected stories.  My understanding is that Lillian Hellman, who held the copyright on Hammett's books until her death, would not allow these stories to be reprinted.  The copyright must be getting close to expiration, so perhaps all of Hammett's stories will once again be available.<br />I was fortunate enough to read all the stories that Black Mask collected in their special issues.  My access was through the marvelous holdings of the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University.  I sat in the reading room where others were undoubtedly reading manuscripts of Boswell or Ezra Pound or Yeats, while I sat engrossed in Continental Op detective yarns.  My best guess is that there may have been enough stories to produce one or two more collections to supplement the two collections we already possess, THE CONTINENTAL OP and THE BIG KNOCKOVER.  I must admit that the quality of these stories were not overall up to the quality of those in the latter volume, which are in turn not quite up to the quality of the stories in the former volume.  That volume is in my humble but most accurate opinion, the finest detective short stories ever written, along with \\"Red Wind\\" by Raymond Chandler.  I feel that of the two founding fathers of the hardboiled detective genre, Hammett wrote better stories and Chandler wrote better novels.<br /><br />RED HARVEST is very good Hammett, but is not quite up to the level of his very best work in THE CONTINENTAL OP and THE MALTESE FALCON.  The story has been widely imitated in film.  Akira Kurosawa borrowed heavily from it in making the movie YOJIMBO, which was in turn used by Sergio Leone in making A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS.  More recently the story was mined for the semi-awful Bruce Willis vehicle LAST MAN STANDING--which had tons of wonderful period atmosphere to go along with tons of stupidity, and which provoked for the three thousandth time the perennial question of why bad guys are such dreadful shots while the good guys never miss.<br />I must further add that the Vintage covers of all the Hammett books are both attractive and wonderfully evocative of the era.  I don't know about others, but I always have a more satisfying reading experience if the books look inviting.te opinion, the finest detective short stories ever written, along with \\"Red Wind\\" by Raymond Chandler.

0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club, written by Amy Tan, was an absolutely amazing book.  It tells the story of the past and present lives of four mothers, and their four daughters. The four mothers were the originators of the Joy Luck Club. Each mother was one of the \\"winds\\" at the mahjong table.  The way Tan switched stories each chapter was quite interesting.  The next chapter had no relation to the previous chapter, so it really had us focused on that story.  My favorite story was the story about Suyuan Woo's life, and her unfinished business in China

0380973650|5.0|This is one wonderful read. From beginning to end, Gaiman hooks the reader with humor, history, fascinating little side trips on the road to the heart of America.

B00004YA66|5.0|Now this is a kind of movie you don't come across everyday. A movie with a plot that is well thought out and executed even better. This movie is a lot like Back to the Future but on a more serious note. I love the way they show events in the past affecting events in the future and Dennis Quaid's performance is top notch as usual. I think he's getting to be one of my favourite actors (any one seen him in Dragonheart, he was awesome).
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Memento, based on a short story by Christopher Nolan's brother, is a definite masterpiece and a tribute to how important film editing is. Memento goes backwards in time and in between moments are tidbits from a conversation about another man that suffers from the same condition Guy Pearce's character suffers from. It makes the suprise ending more of a suprise.<br />Memento is about a man who is searching for the murderer of his wife. He recieves help from a bar owner and a another guy. Memento adds new depth to the psychologicial thriller genre and pretty much is the most original film to come out of Hollywood in years. Guy Pearce gives a amazing performance and probally the best of his carrer. Carrie-Ann Moss also delivers a great performance. <br />There is only one disappointing thing about this film. Sometimes it is hard to rember (no pun intened) what happend before the next moment. It is pretty cool how Guy Pearce's character takes pictures and has tattoos to rember things. But, you really do acutually start to dive into his mind after the first half and belive what he belives. You belive all of that until the ending, where it completly shocks you and makes you question everything.<br />It also is a tribute sound editing and soundtrack creating. The sound is set up to echo and brings you into his world. The soundtrack is the icing on the cake and brings new depth to this already amazing film. The soundtrack is very important to this film as it is too Requiem For A Dream, The Godfather, and Schindler's List.<br />Cinematography. That is what makes this film what it is. The editing just makes it pretty, but this is the bare bones. Now, I am not saying that the editing is worthless, it just is a add on. The cinematography makes you see through the people's eyes and view the world. This is really a new standard for cinematography.<br />This should definitly win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Sound, and Best Soundtrack. It raises the bar for so many things and makes you just wonder what to belive.<br />\\"Now, where was I\\".  ...

B00005BF9Z|5.0|Whatever comparisons have been made with Clandestino (which I haven't heard) this is GREAT. I will never forget this summer in Barcelona with &quot;me gustas tu&quot; playing everywhere - even the street cleaners were blasting it out at 4am in the Barrio Gotico. It expresses my life - English with part french and part spanish/south american influences (me not him). Me gustas tu is also great for learning spanish vocabulary!!!! This album has changed my life - shame it will probably never be heard in the UK .....although I am spreading the word. Does anyone understand the album title? I EXPERIENCED it! Leaving Spain - sitting on the Madrid metro en route to the airport, listening to the album on my walkman - when the train pulls in at a station and THE voice says &quot;proxima estacion - Esperanza&quot; over the trains sound system.  Have to say I died and went to heaven on this music (cheap pink wine helps, so does being in Barcelona and sharing the music with south americans) and it keeps me bopping round the kitchen now I'm back in damp grey November (almost) weather trying to pay the bills and job-hunting ....Le Rendezvous is second best - clever and funny. Discovered the album by seeing the video of Me Gustas Tu in Valencia.  The video really makes it. Does anyone know how/where to get hold of the video? Or DVD?

B000000I02|5.0|I bought the American LP of this on Virgin, the one without the gatefold. Hatfield &amp; the North was a Canterbury supergroup consisting of Caravan bassist/vocalist Richard Sinclair, keyboardist Dave Stewart of Khan and Egg, drummer Pip Pyle of Gong, and guitarist Phil Miller of Matching Mole, and the results turned out to be simply one of the greastest Canterbury bands I have ever heard. Hatfield &amp; the North's music tends to the jazz/fusion side of things, and while I generally write off fusion as a boring wankfest, Hatfield's music is anything but a boring wankfest. Definately not as accessible as the likes of Caravan, but after a few listens, you'll be regarding this album as the Canterbury classic people say it is. While there are the occasional vocals by Richard Sinclair, this album is largely instrumental. There's even some killer female vocals as well from the likes of Barbara Gaskin, Ann Rosenthal, and Amanda Parsons which really gives this album a dreamy atmosphere. At this point, Dave Stewart started to use a lot more electric piano (mostly Wurlitzer) which is way different from his works with Khan, which tended heavily to the Hammond organ. I hadn't heard Hatfield's followup (and final) release, Rotter's Club, but their debut is definately a Canterbury classic, and if you love the jazz/fusion end of that genre, you can't go without this album!
B00000DCHI|5.0|Billy Joel, one of music's top men, has given us hit after hit over the years.  He is, without a doubt, one of the best-possibly the best?  Well, that is up to personal speculation; we will leave any speculation-though, with this disc, how could there be any-to the eye of the beholder.  This double disc is packed with one hit, then another, followed by another-you get my drift.  'Only the good die young' and 'it's still rock and roll to me' are my presonal favorites.  The classic, 'piano man' is here;' so are many others.  give this compilation a chance; you won't be disappointed!  p.s. if you like elton john,the eagles, or even fleetwood mac, you will love mr. joel.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|In 1978 the L.A. based rock group VAN HALEN released a self-titled album (known to most fans as VAN HALEN 1) that pushed the limits of the genre and changed the way every longhaired rock and roller played the guitar. Considering the impact this one record had on all rock music that was to follow, it is undeniably one of the most important rock records ever made.<br />Now imitated to death, Eddie Van Halen's wildly inventive guitar technique of two-handed hammer-on pull-off finger tapping on the fretboard set the new standard for guitar wizardry in the late 1970's. The strength of the Van Halen brothers' musicianship could have made VAN HALEN 1 an essential record, but Michael Anthony's pounding eighth-note anchoring and David Lee Roth's Roger Daltry meets Wayne Newton wailing assured the group a spot in the annals of rock superiority.<br />The group started out playing small clubs around LA, quickly becoming one of the most popular local acts. Gene Simmons of KISS financed the demo recording that led to the group signing with Warner Brothers and releasing their breakthrough debut album. Strong radio support and constant touring established the group as the leaders of the coming wave of 80's heavy metal. It's painfully obvious that every lead guitarist in every 80's metal band was directly descended from Eddie Van Halen's lineage. Most of these guitarists unquestionably honed their technique by learning to play &quot;Eruption&quot; the instrumental second track on VAN HALEN 1.<br />The first VAN HALEN album produced 4 &quot;hits&quot; that became staples of AOR radio: &quot;Runnin With the Devil&quot;, a cover of the KINKS' &quot;You Really Got Me&quot;, &quot;Ain't Talkin Bout Love&quot;, and &quot;Jamie's Cryin&quot;. (An aside: the opening drum fill from &quot;Jamies Cryin&quot; was sampled for TONE LOC's hit &quot;Wild Thing&quot;)<br />VAN HALEN 1 is not the best VAN HALEN album. Most fans will tell you either FAIR WARNING or WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST hold that dubious title. Regardless of which one is the best, this one is the most historically important. It set new standards as far as guitar playing is concerned, and David Lee Roth took the rock and roll frontman schtick to a new level. What Roth may have lacked in vocal talent he made up for in sheer ballsyness (in spades!). Roth raised the vault bar for all rock singers, and no one was ever able to top it. His James Brown like embellishments on songs like &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and &quot;Atomic Punk&quot; ooze with sexuality and something that was missing from much late 70's white-boy rock: soul.<br />The remastered disc of VAN HALEN 1 is the best way to hear this album. The old Warner Brothers CD pressing suffers the same problem that many early CD issues suffer: low sound quality.<br />The rumor mills keep churning about a supposed reunion between the estranged Roth and the Van Halen brothers. Whether or not that happens is probably irrelevant, as neither side has done anything groundbreaking in 20 years... but back in 1978, VAN HALEN 1 was the most groundbreaking thing the world of rock and roll had heard since Jimi Hendrix asked us if we were experienced.ubious title.

I remember staring at it for hours as a kid. The band looks so evil and tough on the cover... so GODLIKE. And the women on the cover... That defined for me what chicks SHOULD look like. It's probably why I'm so attracted to goth-chicks today... they remind me of the girls from the LOVE GUN cover.<br />What can I say about the music on this record. Well, this record contains some of the best KISS songs ever recorded. We've got Love Gun, Christine Sixteen, Shock Me, and I Stole Your Love all on this one record.<br />Unfortunately we also have to endure drek like Got Love for Sale, Almost Human, and Plaster Caster. Also included is the song Hooligan which just totally gets under my skin.<br />KISS' version of &quot;Then She Kissed Me&quot; is cute, but rather annoying.<br />Overall, this is halfway one of the best KISS albums, and half-way one of the worst. It's totally worth grabbing just for the songs Love Gun and Shock Me... 2 of the best rock songs ever shot from the crotch. The remastered CD sounds great, but of course, being a CD, you get that really tiny cover art. The CD definitely doesn't do those chicks justice.
B00005NI5Y|2.0|I was disappointed with the new CD. It sounds like someone oraganized the recording,the songs and music and Bob Dylan just showed up. I LOVE Bob Dylan, but this was not the Bob I know. I miss the composer/musician/Philosopher Bob. This CD had early Jazz sounding remakes and bigband overtones that is turning him into a David Lee Roth showman. If this is the real Bob Dylan, he has really grown up.
0385335482|1.0|The success of a twentysomething-urban-fashionista-chick book often depends on how well the audience can relate to a character or situation. Aptly titled, \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" it should be something totally identifiable, right? We all love to shop. We've all been in debt. (still am).<br /><br />But even the super-shoppers among us will be turned off by Rebecca Bloomwood, the superficial, neurotic, materialistic, annoyingly insecure character. She's not endearing at all. You don't feel sorry for her because she is a compulsive liar who must constantly put up a \\"front\\". It is a pathetic, sad story about a girl with an addictive behavior.<br /><br />You'd think that she even has a sense of style, but to be honest, there is very little shopping in this book. It's mostly about her debts and how she lies to everyone around her. This girl is just too extremely hard to like, extremely hard to identify with. Moreover, the story is not believable. She has these socialite friends but the author never mentions any typical comparison of \\"trying to keep up with the joneses.\\" At least give her some humanity so we can sympathize with the know-all feeling of trying to win a popularity contest!<br /><br />The main character is so downright superficial, unlovable, & pitiful. She deserves to be miserable, after telling stupid lies and hurting people around her -- you end up being disgusted. Kinsella just cannot make this novel humorous or realistic. Come on, Rebecca is a financial writer who knows nothing about what she's writing? Gimme a break--this is really a weak, weak excuse.<br /><br />The ending of 'Confessions' is also a scapegoat ending -- trite, sappy, and a very DUH epiphany (\\"wow, i had all this financial knowledge stored in my head and never used it! now i can budget myself!\\"). Disappointing.<br /><br />If you think compulsive liars are hilarious, then get this book. I know that I sure don't.
B0000070QS|5.0|There are not enough words in the world to express how I feel about Morten Harket.  I have loved him since I was 15 and I still love him to this day (Don't tell my husband...LOL) His voice has carried me through so many tough times in my life. I am not sure where I would be today if not for him.<BR>This album is beyond wonderful.  Every song is done with such passion.  'Los Angeles', 'Ready to go Home', 'Spanish Steps' and 'Lord' are incredible.  They bring tears to my eyes whenever I hear them.<BR>Morten Harket is so very much more than a pop idol from the 80's, he is a brilliant song writer with a voice that the boy bands of today can only dream of matching.  There's no one like him.
B000002U82|4.0|Wish You Were Here and the Wall both had more thought and precision put into them than this album.  DSOTM is somewhat thoughtful, but the songs are pieced together rather sloppily, and the great gig in the sky is so irrelevant and stupid that it should not even be here, but why not waste 6 minutes or so listening to somebody scream into a microphone?  Most people who give this album bad ratings are the people who liked Syd Barrett's Piper at the Gates of Dawn and thought he shouldn't have left the band.  DSOTM is a different kind of Floyd, just because this is no longer written by Syd Barrett, performed by Pink Floyd, doesn't mean you should be looking at it as though it means to be that way.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I am so happy that John Williams wrote the music for my favorite books ever.  I am proud to say that I am 28 years old and still very much a kid at heart.  I bought the CD today and I am extremely impressed.  You can actually follow the story in your head listening to the music.  I used to get excited for movies, what has been coming out has not done anything for me.  This is the first time that I have been excited for a movie as much as I was a kid for the first time in 10 years.  You will love the music in this CD especially if you love Harry or John Williams.  Buy it and you won't be dissapointed.  If you are, you can come over and beat me up.  All fans out there, this will be one of the most awsome movies ever!!!!!!! and I hope you enjoy it!!!!!
B00005OWIU|5.0|Although the movie of which this album is a soundtrack has not yet been released, anyone with a knowledge of the book can listen to this soundtrack and imagine along with it all of the adventures that Harry gets invloved in.  Perhaps it is so easy because of the dreamlike quality of much of the music.  Even if you did not know anything about the movie but heard this CD, you would know that it is about something magical.  John Williams is certainly the master of that!  If I had one negative comment about the soundtrack, it is simply that it is so clearly John Williams.  Many of the orchestrations and even melodic lines seem to come straight out if his existing repetoire.  This is not much of a complaint, however, considering what is repetoire consists of!  Any fan of Harry Potter or of John Williams' soundtracks will thoroughly enjoy this CD!
B00000IQC8|4.0|This is the movie that you could say started it all. Definitely a good movie for Kevin Smith fans and just a fun movie to watch. Especially if you plan on watching the other films, which have interlacing themes/stories and references. Gives you a \\"small town\\" coincidental feeling.<br /><br />It is filmed all in black and white, almost if it was seen through the security camera. It's a neat effect that plays well for the theme of the movie. The basic premise is that the two main characters are Clerks at a convenience store and the next door Video rental. The encounters with different patrons and of course the weed peddling Jay and Silent Bob are hilarious. The story as it unfolds is both smart and vulgar, and has several reoccurring themes that you can catch as you go through the story. There are a lot of fast exchanges of dialogue that you'll have to pay attention to, which all comes to a bunch of hard-hitting revelations and conclusions for most of the main-characters.<br />Kevin Smith enjoys displaying both the intelligent and vulgar/fart/genetalia joke sides in his films. Whether debating hardcore midget p0rn, the Star Wars movies, smoking, or delving into what every clerk has to go through on a daily basis, it'll be delivered in it's own style.<br /><br />And if you enjoy Clerks:<br />Definitely recommend watching: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Clerks II.
B00000I41J|5.0|As I've said before, I'm not a particularly erudite jazzophile, I just appreciate a well-paced, melodic, and soulful jazz set when I hear it.  And this record is superlative.  Cannonball's LP, seemingly centered around the masterful phrasings of Miles, brings some great musicians together.  Each of them leave an indelible mark on this record, but never at the expense of the whole.  In my mind, &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; and &quot;One for Daddy-O&quot; are the standout tracks.<br />Along with &quot;Kind of Blue,&quot; &quot;Giant Steps,&quot; &quot;Moanin'&quot; and &quot;Time Out,&quot; (among many others), this is an essential jazz record, not because Ken Burns or anyone else says so, but because it's evident from the first listen.  Go ahead and get it.
B000002G23|5.0|SInce THe Police only recorde five studio albuns, it's reasonable to think that this box set really delivers what it promises: all POLICE music in it!!! And what music!! The songs were all remastered and sounds much better than the original CD versions of the LP's. Of course a more die hard fan will find about some obscure forgotten track, but that's not the point. The box was clearly made with care and attention.
0345404475|4.0|Philip L. Dick presents a most disturbing vision of the future which may have shocked most readers when it was first published. After the proliferation of dark movie views of the possible future, this may be a candid story to the recent generation. A very consistent one yet sometimes it may not hold you tight enough in thrill(which happens to many writers).<br />  Unfortunately I saw the movie &quot;Blade Runner&quot; first, which has biased me to thinking of this book as a script, which in fact it is not. I favor a little bit Ridely's Scott interpretation as you may have noticed by not giving it 5 stars. However it is very much worth reading.
B00000DHTF|2.0|Of course Bruce is a prolific songwriter, a real master. But to fill four, I repeat, four CD's with previoulsy unreleased material provoke, at least, a little suspicion... Even Springsteen could not manage to write such a great number of tunes and leave them out in the cold for so long... So, I recommend you to listen to this compilation first befoer buying it...

0789723107|5.0|When I recommend this book to peers, they ask if they can borrow my copy.  I tell them no - I'm not willing to be without it.  It's that valuable.<br />I respect an author that can take a complex, nebulous topic (like web usability) and distill his or her thinking into a single statement. Krug does it masterfully, and puts his statement on the cover: Dont Make Me Think.  Now that I understand where he's coming from, I can read his book through that lens.<br />Authors should be able to provide some broad context first, and then descend into detail.  An author should say &quot;my topic is about A, B and C.  We'll explore many detailed examples within each, and I'll make plenty of recommendations.  But at the end of the day, it's about A, B, and C.&quot;  Those that don't provide the context end up writing books that are glorified laundry lists: &quot;208 things to remember about my topic&quot;. I can't retain a list of 208 things, but I can remember A, B and C.<br />Krug offers up a few sensible laws of usability and demonstrates their validity through carefully chosen examples.  The book itself is a living example of interface usability.  I recommend it even to people who have no interest in the web.  It's that good.<br />Own this book.
B00005QGAZ|1.0|The lamest album of all time just got even more self-important with weak bonus tracks and a pointless remastered sound.  If you fell for this tripe the first time around in the 80's there is no reason to be fooled again.  Forget Jacko's ego and pass this one by.
B00003CY0V|5.0|The first 15 minutes sealed that movies greatness. That use of effects was amazing and hopefully it gets reconized as a Matrix type movie.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Not much to say as I can only praise this smart movie.<br />Most stunning for me was how well the story-telling works. Not a rip-off of the &quot;segmented story&quot;, instead it uses a very unique timeline approach.<br />The story is excellent. Rent if you still have doubt!
1577311523|5.0|There is nothing I can add to the other reviews except my vote: This is truly important book and I cannot recommend it highly enough.  It is for all readers, not just those who enjoy &quot;spiritual&quot; books (it is on the second such book I had ever read).  I have bought many copies for friends and they in turn have done the same.  <br />If you are tempted to buy his &quot;sequel&quot;, &quot;Practicing the Power of Now&quot;, please, please be sure to read the reviews first - it is a poor abridged version of the original and in my opinion does not contain the lifeblood of &quot;The Power of Now&quot;.
0471381985|4.0|Value investing is so unpopular now, that many do not know about this highly successful form of investing as practiced by its greatest masters.  Value Investing helps to overcome that ignorance among the newest generation of investors.  That is good and timely, because we seem to be entering a time when value investors often make their greatest coups.<br />If you believe that the stock market is totally efficient (current prices accurately discount everything that is or could be known about the company to accurately price a company&#8217;s securities), you will think this book is irrelevant.  If you think that stock prices normally over or under value a company&#8217;s worth, you will find this book fascinating.<br />If you want to have a decent chance of learning how to outperform indexed mutual funds, this book is one of a handful that can help you.  The methods and investors outlined in this book have successfully beaten the market averages for decades.  So whether you try to do apply the concepts for yourself, or have your money invested by one of these top value investment managers, value investing is a discipline that can help you achieve superior investing results.<br />In some of the many back tests run in recent years to test for market efficiency concerning stock prices, simply buying stocks with low price/earnings and price/book ratios proved to outperform the market averages.  More thoughtful stock-picking can do even better.<br />But the ideas in this book are far more important than that.  Value Investing shows the many ways that situations where securities are underpriced can be found and exploited.  The masters of this approach do a lot of fundamental homework, and look carefully from several different perspectives.<br />Many people identify value investing with Benjamin Graham and the early Warren Buffett.  This book expands that perspective by also profiling Mario Gabelli, Glenn Greenberg, Robert Heilbrunn, Seth Klarman, Michael Price, Water and Edwin Schloss, and Paul Sonkin.  You will find out about how they were educated, the value disciplines they have used, their long-term track records, and how they differ from one another.<br />You should realize that value investing is above-all an intellectual and cross-checking exercise (a bit like chess), far removed from emotion of day-trading and the thrills of following trading momentum.  You need to be patient.  Years can pass without any good opportunities arising.  You will often sell stocks far before their ultimate peak.  So you will have to think about how well the psychology of the careful hunter with one bullet in your rifle matches the way you like to do things.  One of the hardest things to accommodate is that your results will look worst when everyone else is picking up easy money, mindlessly, by running with the herd of rampaging bulls.<br />As helpful as this book is, Value Investing has a number of weaknesses.  First, new investors will probably get a little lost in the discussions.  The authors usually begin at a level of understanding that people who have attended business school have.  Second, you will find it hard to run down more details on concepts you don&#8217;t quite get.  Third, you will get a flavor of what each investor has done . . . but not the full detail.  So, think of this as a wine tasting.  If you find some styles you like, plan to do more reading and studying.  Fourth, if you were only taught the investing creed according to efficient markets, you will probably wonder what all the fuss is about.  The book could have used more references to the new research that challenges the assumptions built into CAPM (the Capital Asset Pricing Model).<br />In your personal life, do you ever find it rewarding to get a great bargain on something of value that you care about?  If so, value investing may be for you.  The sense of satisfaction is similar, and the financial rewards can be greater.<br />Be cautious as you apply any investing methodto outperform the market averages.  Limit the size of your potential losses until you have fully developed your skill.<br />Look carefully, think . . . and be skeptical!  There are many people trying to make the future seem rosier than it will be.nvesting method to outperform the market averages.

B00003IPFK|4.0|It's not about Indians and cowboys. It is about survival, friendship, coming of age, and romance. The Western settings made it a classic movie. It is hard to stop once you started the movie.
B00003CXBK|2.0|Surely most people are fans of Miyazaki's works because of Nausicaa, Laputa, Kiki, Totoro.  That's because even though those films appear \\"less ambitious\\" than Mononoke Hime they moved you emotionally, spiritually.  Unfortunately that's missing from Mononoke.  I can't buy into the argument that since there is no side you cheer for that this is more realistic=great.  That doesn't make it great.  And it's certainly not what made Miyazaki's previous works so enjoyable.  Maybe I expected too much but even that put aside I didn't experience the same emotional charge and sense of wonder as I did when watching Laputa or Nausicaa.  <BR>Even the ending was disappointing.  There was no real resolution to the conflict.  We didn't really learn much about anybody except how much Rage can cloud their judgements.  The story line wasn't very memorable.  I can't even remember the soundtrack.  (astonishing considering Jo's past accomplishments in previous works).  <BR>It's unfortunate since this was Miyazaki's first real big exposure to the US audience.  The fact that it only grossed a bit over $2 Million in the US has endangered future realeases of his films by Disney.  Write them and tell them that would be a very big mistake ...
0446677450|5.0|This is a life changing book (if you'll allow it).  While I somtimes cringed at the thought of &quot;poor dad&quot; ever knowing that his biological son is criticizing his philosophies and beliefs in regard to money, the book really hit home some hard truths about financial management, developing new paradigms and integrating new ways of taking action in order to begin building wealth.<br />Learn to think and act like a millionaire by putting aside old ideas about where and how to achieve financial success, not by just reading this book but by following through with behavioral and mental changes as the world of getting rich beckons you!<br />aero-diva
B00005LC1H|3.0|First, let me say that I am a big fan of John Cleese, and I love Fawlty Towers....My video tapes (you remember those big clunky things?) were played so often that the picture quality was beginning to degrade. This is not merely funny, it is hillarious, and it has made me belly laugh so many times, I cannot even count. So, why do I give it three stars....well, I don't, not really, I give the DVD's three stars. I notice that all the previous reviews were from before the DVD set was released. I have watched every episode on my DVD's and 4 of them had a &quot;pixel&quot; problem (sorry, I'm not an electrical engineer and may be describing it wrong, but what happens is the image becomes heavily blurred by pixels, if that makes any sense). This is not a problem with my DVD player as I have tried it on all three of my DVD players and had the same problem. If this is a problem with all sets, I say forget it and buy the Videos, soon enough they will make DVD recorders as cheap as VCR's and you can make your own copy. If it is only my copy, then go for it, it is a great set! (Don't expect a lot from the outtakes though, I would have liked to see more).
B00003CXE7|5.0|The movie, on DVD, is so wonderful!  The clarity of sound, color and action cannot be duplicated.  The movie reels you in and you feel like you are there in that time period.  The acting giving by Russell Crowe is overwhelmingly great along with the other actors portrayals.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Gold is no Stranger's Almanac or Pneumonia, but I hardly regret buying it. I tend to think the harder-edged tracks are overblown and unnecessary (&quot;Tina Toledo's Street-Walking Blues,&quot; for example) but the slower tracks are excellent (&quot;La Cienega Just Smiled,&quot; &quot;Wildflowers&quot;). The appearance of Adam Duritz on background vocals (he just doesn't mix with the music at all) and the multiple props given to Alanis Morrisette in the liner notes gives me nightmares. Overall, he has a beautiful voice and intriguing talent.
B000002H33|5.0|this product is awesome!it has the best sound , pounding guitars and shattering rythms.if you are a metal or rock enthusiast then this album is essential
B00003CXAA|1.0|Talk about a let down,where are all the extra scenes? I guess that will be for the next release,so they can take more $$ out of my pocket.was i just me or were there some scenes missing.when tom finds sonny up stairs banging that girl against the door,when tom tells sony his pops wants him,in the video she yells out oh sonnny it wasn't on my dvd.also the scene in michael's hotel room with kay,michael makes kay call the house as a long distance operator,anybody remember that scene when it's not on my dvd i'm sure there are more but i stopped whatching i was so disappointed.
B00004XQP4|3.0|As I write this review, it is about a year on since I first bought `Warning.' I have to say though that I was at first disappointed that this was not the 2nd `Dookie' that I'd waited 3 years for (Nimrod being Green Day's previous release.) So through the letterbox comes `Warning' I listen to the CD and think `this is quite good, but first of all it isn't green day and second it isn't punk!' Green day had evolved for the better? Probably, but to me this CD belonged in my `reject CD draw' where it has stayed for about eleven months now!<br />So now a year on I find myself listening to the CD again, why? Because with the close release of `Waiting' (single) and `International Super hits' (best of album) I feel I may have been a bit harsh on `Warning' so now here is my honest view:<BR>Green Day's `Warning' is a matured, if somewhat nervous album where the band try something most bands stay well away from: change, for this alone I salute Green Day But, for all you people who want classics such as `Basket Case' and `Longview' this is not the album. `Warning' is the album for people who don't really know Green Day because judging by the musical strengths of `Minority', `Church on Sunday' and `Waiting' this is the new ambitious and rather original country/punk/rock/folk sound of a new mature Green Day.<BR>Warning is an upbeat song with repetitive lyrics but quickly sets the pace for the rest of the album. Blood, Sex and Booze is kind of a 2nd version of `Dookie's' `Pulling Teeth' but the music is more like a folk dance for your parents. Church on Sunday is a super happy-clappy punk/folk anthem, which really gets your toes tapping. Fashion Victim starts well with pogo like riffs that soon get repetitive, as do the lyrics. <BR>Castaway is a fast and furious but still controlled and still not bordering previous Green Day recordings kind of song. Then comes Misery a Feeble attempt at a comedy slow rock song that just gets boring.<BR> Deadbeat Holiday matches a few songs on Nimrod that were bordering folk rock too, but still it is a happy number this is also the same with Hold On, a slow but chirpy song which really is quite nice to listen to with interesting lyrics and a toe tapping rhythm. Jackass is another feeble song with an awful Saxophone solo, which makes me cringe on every listen! Waiting is a well-produced slow rock song that is one of the best on this album and should not be overlooked. Now we come to the big single from Warning: Minority bordering classic Green Day with an anthem like chorus and a classic punk riff. Then the big finale, which is the disappointing Macy's Day Parade here, you need to think Time of your life and times the cheese level by about 10! <br />So there it is, Green Day's Warning in a nutshell, a different approach to Green Day's music writing but only time (and record sales) will tell if it is worth it.
0553573403|4.0|This book is simply good, solid prose. We are taken into a complex and epic world with all sorts of things going on, many of which are not resolved. Of course, we all like sequels, don't we? I really enjoyed the suspense of the many different dangers, personal and family struggles and wars. I also enjoyed the author's unique style of writing that posited a new persona every chapter--naming the chapter after the perspective character. Though a fantasy, I thought that the very little use of magic was both appropriate and refreshing. It made what little there was really exciting and unusual. A good read and better, I felt, that its sequel. But I'll leave that for another review.
B00003CX8J|3.0|The soundtrack was good, the action sequences everything I could have hoped for (the claws!! I had goosebumps), and the story was about par for the course. I watched it, and I saw a fine tradition of comics make it's first successful transition to the big screen. I was thrilled and excited. Like the first time Superman and Spiderman teamed up. <BR>I have to say, that when I first heard about this movie, I was sure that &quot;They&quot; couldn't get the characters right. Well, I was 90% wrong. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Wolverine, Xavier were all magnificent. There were some adjustments made to ages of other characters, but that's okay. Every story teller changes things to suit their tale. I think Grace Jones would have made a better Storm/Ororo, but my opinion wasn't sought. <BR>The only real flaw in the movie is the focal point on Magneto.  The characterization was good, but the characterization of Magneto's ethics, the core beliefs, fell short here, and I was very upset. Magneto was/is a character whose goal differed from Xavier's in that he felt mutants should live apart from humans, instead of with and amongst them. His protectiveness of mutant-kind (Homo Sapiens Superior), and his perception of mankind (Homo Sapiens) as the equivalent of the Nazi Reich, was what kept him on the outside fringe of law and order. The character himself believe in justice, and honor. <BR>So he wouldn't have played it the way he did in the movie. Eric Magnus Lensher would never have sacrificed someone else to do something that he could do himself. It was something that was integral to how he was seen by the world at large, and his own feelings about mutant brotherhood.<BR>Keep in mind, this is all from the perspective of one who grew up on the tales of these heroes. From the fresh perspective of one uneducated/untainted (depending on your point of view) this is a good movie for action buffs, anime fans and those who like one-liners throughout. <BR>So +1 star for the comic-fan's rating, as is for the movie... as is. Live well.
0553579908|2.0|Though I was transfixed by the previous book in the series, I did not make it through this one. Call me a prude, but the constant self-satisfying and obligatory sex in this book really distracted me and put me off. It seemed to me that the author had some kind of sex fetish and had to put as much of it in the book as he could. Simply put, his previous book in the series was tight. Though thick, nearly every scene and chapter moved the story. Not so with this book. Slowed by &quot;extra&quot; chapters detailing characters having sex, this book was not written for fantasy lovers, but for porn lovers. If you like to read such distraction, then buy the book, for the author's prose is both rich and lyrical. Too bad.

Yet I will only say it is a movie that you can relate to, and mysterious at the same time.

044022425X|5.0|I picked up DRUMS OF AUTUMN one day in a store, and promptly moved, thus baninshing the book to a box.  A few weeks ago, I picked it up and started to read it.  I had never read anything by Diana Gabaldon before (yes, I went about it completely backassward), but the way she weaved stories within stories to create a beautiful tapestry absolutely captured me.  I loved the entire book!  The fact that she writes a story including all the day-to-day events, be they hilarious or heartbreaking, is evidence of a terrific author!  It really shouldn't be classified as a romance novel, because it's so much more than that; it's believeable!  You can read it and say, &quot;That has happened to me!&quot; or &quot;I always say that!&quot;.  None of the cheezy tripping through the daisies, and characters who are outrageously perfect crap.  I have now read the previous three books, and you really can't put them down!  I highly recommmend these books to anyone looking for a whirlwind adventure!

B00005OWIU|5.0|Where do I begin?! Here's the first thoughts that came to my mind as I listen to this soundtrack:<BR>(1.) This is DEFINITELY John Williams music. No one else in the world can write music like he can, it's simply incredible. We would not be satisfied with the movie if Mr. Williams hadn't written the music. He has the ability to capture emotions, feelings, pictures... magic! Everything. I almost don't need the movie, because the music itself conveys everything... it's as if I'm watching it just by listening. It's so powerful and just amazing.<BR>(2.) The music is A LOT like Star Wars. Very similar. I occasionally hear melodies or parts of the music that bring to mind pictures of Star Wars, not Harry Potter. NOTE: This isn't a bad thing!!! Star Wars has the best music ever written for a movie, no doubt. I'm a huge fan of Star Wars and I believe that's largely because of the music. But by saying this, I hope to encourage Star Wars fans to buy this soundtrack because if you like the music in Star Wars, you'll also fall for this soundtrack. <BR>(3.) It's Harry Potter. Worried that the movie won't be true to the books? If this music is any indication, there's no need to worry...<BR>(4.) The cover of my soundtrack says &quot;Special First Edition.&quot; Does that mean I'll have to buy another edition(s) later on? Oh mannn, I guess I'd better start saving! :-)<BR>(5.) ENJOY!
0553573403|3.0|I found A Game of Thrones to be incredibly slow-paced. It was more likely to put me asleep than keep me up nights. If you're used to the pace and excitement of Terry Goodkind's novels, this one will require some patience. On the whole, however, I found A Game of Thrones worth the effort. Martin is an excellent writer with a grasp for depth of character and historical perspective. I found myself really caring for individuals in the story, concerned for their safety and future events, and unable to take sides, thanks to the adept way in which Martin shows the humanity of each character. But there's also a nice assortment of &quot;guys you love to hate&quot; thrown in, although you have to feel sad even for them. Martin creates a cold, bleak world, full of intrigue and polictical unrest, in which only those rooted in true strength, whether noble or ignoble, survive. There are no black-and-white's in this book, however. As in real life, the good guys don't always win. In fact, the most realistic part of Martin's storytelling is that it's not really clear just who the good guys are! As in life, one is forced to choose one flawed kingdom or another, in which everyone has a right to their own perspective. The ending of the novel was the best part of all, and definitely portends to more and better action ahead. It's too bad the book takes 700 pages to build a head of steam, but I will definitely be reading book 2 to see what happens next!
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams' newest piece of work is wonderful.  As a *HUGE* fan of Harry Potter, I made sure to get this CD hot off the presses.  Be warned however, it's going to give you the very same shock it gave people when they rushed to buy the Titanic CD: it's all instrumental.  Nonetheless, it is a simply superb CD.  The music is amazingly put together and is wonderful to listen to--you can really see every scene playing out in your head.  I highly recommend this CD to any Harry Potter fan, or for that matter, any person who just likes good music.  cheers and butterbeers! -emily
B00004DTLJ|4.0|With this 1985 album Saxon enthroned themselves as true kings of metal and masters of powerful songwriting,heavy,aggresive,and yet catchy.This is an incredible collection of rock standards that many bands have tried to immitate ever since:&quot;Devil Rides Again&quot;,&quot;Back on the Streets&quot;,&quot;Everybody Up&quot; are just a few of the hard hitters on this amazing album.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite albums.
B0000524CY|4.0|I saw The Exorcist in the theater during its original release, at which time there was much controversy about the morality of showing such vivid scenes of pure evil inflicted upon an innocent young girl. The intervening years have been very kind to this film (especially considering the special effects technology in use at the time of its creation). And while some of the more \\"over the top\\" scenes are still somewhat shocking, they no longer dominate the viewing experience, leaving room to appreciate the many subtleties overlooked in the past. What once seemed to be exploitation now fits comfortably into the overall narrative.<br />I feel that The Exorcist is as faithful to the novel as can be expected in a cinematic adaptation, and the acting and direction elevates it well above most of the subsequent entries to the genre. I enjoyed the inclusion in this version of previously deleted scenes, most of which add depth to the storyline without interrupting its flow. The new ending certainly changes the way the viewer is left to feel about the film, and some may object that this lessens its overall impact. I can only say that I found the new ending to be an appropriate and enjoyable change that did not diminish my experience in any way.<br />One feature I always look forward to on DVD is a director's commentary track, which is included on this edition. But it is the most bizarre commentary I have ever heard, and I don't mean that as praise. Eighty percent of Friedkin's \\"commentary\\" consists of his telling us what the actors in the scene are saying, offering no additional insights, and taking the concept of scene-specific commentary to a new and absurd level. The other twenty percent of Friedkin's input is interesting, if just a bit lightweight. He does mangage to convey his sincere intentions in making this film, and his affection for the project and the people involved in its creation.
B00005QIPH|5.0|True this album isn't original, sure the lyrics are far from earth-shattering, but what is.  Quite frankly I am sick of all the references to Nevermind, I bet most people who revere it would never be able to explain why it is so groundbreaking, much in the same way most people love Shakespeare yet have never read a line of Hamlet, they just watched the movie (and that horrible 2 hour strip down of Mel Gibson's at that cause a whole 4 hours is too much for one person to take)  <br />Sure the Strokes may be cool for coolness sake, sure their sound is eagerly like The Velvet Underground.  But how many copies did The Velvet Underground and Nico sell really.  The Underground new york sound of music has yet to break into any main stream status.  The majority of people probably don't even know who the Stooges are and the only song they know by The Velvet Underground is &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; which is not the Underground of course but Reed's solo project. <BR>If the Strokes do make it into the mainstream they will be called groundbreaking of course, no one has really heard this sound before.  Just like Nirvana did when they copied Joy Division and altera-punk of the late 70's.  Did they really invent a new sound??? or did they just get played on the radio.<br />personally i like the album, a lot.  they keep it simple and i don't think they are trying to be groundbreaking, just play music the way most people reading this review never could. Playing music is just not that easy.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver takes place in a society, that at first, seems perfect.  It seems to be free from crime or societal problems.  This however, leads to no freedom to make personal decisions or experience true freedom.  This novels main character is Jonas and centers around his coming of age at twelve years old.  At the magic age of twelve his society decides what his career and purpose in life is going to be.   His discovery into his assigned job as &quot;the giver&quot; is one that is troubling and leads him to search outside of his community to find a better life.  Follow Jonas as he learns of the true problems of his community and how maybe the grass is greener on the other side of the mountain.  We recommend this book for children at least 13 years or older due to some of the life and death aspects of this story.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Reese Witherspoon is gorgeous and funny in this take on the blond sterotype.  She plays a sorority girl majoring in Fashion who is actually very bright but doesn't at all follow the sterotype of what a &quot;smart girl&quot; looks or acts like.  When her boyfriend dumps her because he wants someone smarter, she follows him out of desparation to Harvard Law School (her brains and creativity get her in).  At first she finds it all a struggle, but once she knows in her heart that she really is smart, she surprises everyone.  Great example of how things are not always as they appear.  I loved her dog.  As great as Reese was, Jennifer Coolidge almost steals the show with her one liners and self-defacing humor.  Even my fiancee who I dragged to see this was cracking up.  Forget the Terrorists, Anthrax scares, and sadness of these times and watch this film.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is extremely well done.  John Williams sets the tone for each part of the movie by defining it with its own, independent theme.  Harry's theme is the most &quot;magical&quot; sounding and stands apart from the rest of the soundtrack.  It's a very soft and mellow tune that's both mysterious and innocent at the same time.  The Quidditch scene has the loudest and most rambunctious music.  Much like the sport itself, the music is fast-paced.  Voldemort's theme is very soft and dark sounding, with very subtle changes.  Though it's no &quot;Imperial March&quot;, it's one of Williams' most successful villain themes.  It's very obvious that Williams has borrowed certain elements from his past scores, but at the same time manages to change it and add enough new material for a completely original sound.  At times, there is a choir in the background providing vocals that tends to sound more like the work of James Horner than John Williams.  This is not to say, however, tht Williams is unsuccessful.  The mix of instrument and voice is superb.  Overall, I would say this is one of John Williams' most successful scores,  especially in recent years.  It's my favorite since Jurassic Park and well worth the price.
B0000029GA|5.0|I have recently heard the Jay Z diss on Nas on his Blueprint album. Please Jay you cant touch Nas.<br />I have to admit I really dont like the direction Nas has taken the past couple of albums, but this album, this album right here is unreplaceable. This ranks right up there with Liquid Swords as being the greatest hip-hop album of all time. <br />A little message. Jay Z bit Nas style. Its so obvious. Its really sad to see how an artist like Jay Z with a 95% female fan base diss someone as great as Nasty Nas. <br />Nas creates original music. Jay Z samples. Jay Z sells more records, but is it his music?<br />Nas sells millions of albums, not as many as Jay, but he can at least feel he has more respect and he does. Its his music, he doesnt steal music like Jay Z. He has respect from the true fans of hip-hop. Real hip-hop hippys really dont like the Oochie Wally and soft side of Nas, but Nas is still Nas. Plain and simple. <br />This album is better than anything Jay Z has ever put out. Jay knows that, the hip-hop underground knows that. Jay has jealously towards Nas, for money reasons? No. Can Jay get more females than Nas, buy a bigger crip, buy more cars? Yea I'm sure he can, but can Jay Z say he has the same level of respect as Nas? No he cant. He knows that. The world knows that. Jay can make a million records that diss Nas, but that wont change the respect true hip-hop heads have for him. I hope &quot;Stillmatic&quot; is half as nice as &quot;Illmatic&quot; that is all it would have to be to become an instant classic.
B000002UKS|5.0|Oh my gosh i dont know who could actually put this cd down, it is like crack for the ears. The tunes are funny, sad, and generally entertaining with a smudge of 80's rock style thrown in the mix. This music also happened to get me through some interesting times in my life (middle school...Peer pressure....GIRLS)I love this CD and i could listen to it all the way through without getting bored.... Good job Dave!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I cannot say enough about how great this DVD is.  First of all, there is the great classic, the first of them all, Disney's lovely and scary Snow White.  Then, all the additional material.  I spent at least 2 evenings looking at all the extra stuff--and enjoyed it immensely.  If you have any doubts, please buy this DVD---if not for your children, then to enjoy your own childhood all over again.
B000051VWW|4.0|Sade's latest, Lover's Rock deserves more credit than it got. It is an excellent composition of soft ballads (&quot;All About Our Love&quot;, &quot;By Your Side&quot;...) that are touching to the soul. An excellent choice for love songs.
B00003CXSM|4.0|I enjoyed this sweet chick flick. The comic timing is well precise and there is great chemistry between J. Lo and Matthew McCoughaney. OK, so the plot is a bit cheesy -- Mary (J. Lo), a workaholic and perfectionist wedding planner falls for one of the grooms -- but what's great about the film is that the bride-to-be isn't a villain and therefore the attraction between Steve and Mary could be justified, like it happens in most films. Also, all the characters are adorable. I recommend this film to all chicks. Get together with some cocktails and snacks and enjoy!
038533348X|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;Cats Cradle&quot; produces an excellent outlook on society in general. The main character, Jonah, named after the biblical Jonah and the Whale story for his unfortunate circumstances, is writing a book called &quot;The Day The World Ended&quot;. Throughout his research, he meets many brilliant minds and by pure coincidence (or as Bokonon would say, as it was supposed to happen) he comes across an object which can actually end the world. A interesting analysis of scientists, truth, religion and human nature. Near the beginning it tells you that if you cannot understand how a religion can be based on lies yet still be practised then you will not understand the book (that Jonah is writing: &quot;The Day The World Ended&quot;). You will understand this later in the book. An excellent read for an open mind on many topics such as religion, truth and science.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm not the biggest Dylan fan on the planet, but I recommend this album unconditionally. He writes in a variety of American styles (and sounds a little like Fats Waller on one song!) and keeps things not so abstract. That is, the lyrics make sense, Dylan sounds engaged, and the band is tight. And by &quot;not a Dylan fan,&quot; I mean I like Highway 61, Blonde, Desire, etc. I guess you could say this is the Dylan album I've been waiting for.
B000051VWW|4.0|Sade's latest, Lover's Rock deserves more credit than it got. It is an excellent composition of soft ballads (&quot;All About Our Love&quot;, &quot;By Your Side&quot;...) that are touching to the soul. An excellent choice for love songs.
B00003CXN4|4.0|Traffic is well-made and has interesting approach to a complicated issue. But there are deeper complications regarding drug trafficking in America that &quot;Traffic&quot; fails to cover, perhaps they are too hard to film. But Hollywood is notorious for filming such stuff (watch &quot;All the President's Men&quot;). The story presented here is a one sided story, however with a strong message.<br />Benicio had a rush that year, one movie after the other (a total of about 25?). And while the Academy recognized him here as a great supporting actor, ask yourself if his role in Traffic is one of &quot;support&quot; or one which carries the film all the way to the red carpet.
6303109950|5.0|Some historical inaccuracies, but Val Kilmer is the best Doc Holliday on film yet.
B000002J09|5.0|This album always sends me into a deep state of clear conscious thought during every listen. It has beautiful harmonies on songs like &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot;, &quot;Going to California&quot; and the wonderful &quot;Stairway to Heaven.&quot; Songs such as the opener &quot;Black Dog&quot; and innovative &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; set the stage for the album. I'd say just listen to it on your turntable all the way through and you'll get what I'm saying!!! Excellent.
B00005N53P|5.0|The Strokes' debut album, Is This It, is one of the most refreshing albums to come out in a long time.  This New York City quintet are direct descendants of bands like The New York Dolls, Television, The Velvet Underground, T. Rex and The Stooges.  They plow through the eleven songs on the album in just over a half-hour with a cocksure swagger.  Take your pick from tracks like &quot;Barely Legal&quot;, &quot;The Modern Age&quot;, &quot;Alone, Together&quot;, &quot;Take It Or Leave It&quot; and &quot;Someday&quot; and you can not go wrong.  An impressive debut that will hopefully lead to greater things.
B00005NZBN|5.0|An incredible CD that alternately alerts me then makes me pine for yesterday. The music in some songs drives to the core. Although you can clearly hear every word, would like to have had lyrics included.
6305627401|5.0|I laughed so hard when I first saw this movie, and I couldnt believe my eyes at what I was seeing (I never had seen South Park before). This mvie is f.....g sweet, dude!
B00003CXZ1|1.0|Amazing! This film is worse than &quot;Batman Forever&quot;, one of the few films that had me running from the theatre. Bad casting (the &quot;super-weirdo&quot; Jolie as Lara Croft?? What were they thinking?), pedestrian action sequences, a bad &quot;script&quot; and a large budget mixed into an unwatchable mess. Did'nt the producers of this sewage watch any &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; films to see how Tomb Raider should have been made; or even play the game?<br />To quote Leonard Pinth Garnell: &quot;Simply awful, could'nt have been worse..&quot;

B000003RCY|5.0|This is a great cd. It's awesome, I love how it's in German too. At first I thought that I wouldn't really get into Rammstein since they're German, and I only knew English, and 1 year of french (that I ended up flunking), but I was totaly wrong, the best song on this CD, by far is &quot;Heirate Mich&quot;. I think Rammstein, has a unique sound, that's hard to explain what its like. But I do know that Rammstein, kicks @$$. And you will NOT be dissapointed in this CD.
B00003CX5P|1.0|The only way the next Star Wars Movie (&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;... maybe because the title &quot;Attack of the 50 Foot Woman&quot; was taken?) can be any good is if Jar Jar Binks gets sucked into an X-Wing engine and shreaded into a fine mist!  Lucas left out the one thing that made Star Wars great, gritty realism.  The characters are too sweet, the ships to clean, and the plot too thin!  Darth Maul was wasted... and so was my $$!
0451203933|5.0|The book recounts the expeiences of U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force members at The Battle of Mogadishu. Black Hawk Down pulls no punches and Bowden puts you there with the Rangers and the D-Boys during the most brutal engagement imaginable.<br />I find it hard to imagine a way in which Bowden could have made the events of that Oct. 3rd more real for the reader. The graphic nature of combat disturbed me and put into perspective the role our armed forces are called upon to play. I particularly was moved by the fact that Bowden makes and effort to show the Somali perspective, making it less black and white (to my discomfort) but far more real and complex. This also sets the stage for the great observations and hard questions he brings up in the Epilogue and the Afterward of the book. This book is on my &quot;required reading&quot; for anyone with a strong opinion (either way) on US involvement on world politics. You cannot walkaway from this book and not have a new respect for the men and women that wear the uniforms of our armed forces.
B00005OWIU|5.0|Thank you John Williams for This Wonderful Score! When I first found out John Williams was doing the score for the first Harry Potter, I thought who better?  I knew this score would be wonderful and I am right!  If you've read the Harry Potter Books then you'll agree!  It captures the Magic, the Imagination, the Heart of the Book just perfect!  If you've seen the trailer for the movie then you've already heard one of the Major themes in the Score, and if you thought it couldn't get better than that, just wait to you hear this score cause it does!  Now I'm even more exited for the movie.  November 16th baby, yeah I'm totally there!
0312966199|5.0|This is a really great book and the only biography I've really ever liked. It's about a guy (James Herriot) who is a country vet. This has stories about his work at a pet show, him when he's trying to court his future wife, and it has a lot about the personalities of the animals he treated. It also has a lot of his blunders, like when he got drunk (accidentally, I think) and went out to a farm. The people there were really religious, and he found out the next day the despised drinking! He didn't go out there again. All in all, it was a really good book, and I recommend it for any animal lovers or future vets out there.
B000050XEI|5.0|Beautiful music, with an etheral sound to it.It really captures the mood many of us are feeling.
B00005QGAZ|2.0|This remastered CD has great sound quality, but the liner notes brag that it includes bonus songs -- however, they are only EXCERPTS of those songs; there is even commentary from Quincy Jones OVER the start of the them!  Who wants half a song?  I feel ripped off and DON'T think I will be buying his other reissues.  This is a horrible lapse in judgment on Jackson's part, but then, what's new?  The best thing about the extra tracks is the Vincent Price rap session, which is truly fascinating.
B00005KARK|5.0|I will not spend much time reviewing the film since it is so well known. This is Walt Disneys personal favorite. It is a lovely story about someone who is different and the the hardships he must go through and at the end what was once considered a weakness is his biggest strength. Now onto the DVD. The film transfer is fantastic considering this movie is 60 years old. The digital remastering was very well done and is up to par with Snow White and Fantasia. The 5.1 Dolby track really shines and the audio has a spacious feel and is very clean. The sub-woofer and rears are used a few times as well. The additional content is nice and is above the Gold Edition standard. Since it is a single disc it does not have the wealth of material that Snow White has but does contain a great deal. The audio commentary was very interesting and follows the film.<BR>A must own DVD for any collection and even more so if you have kids!
B00004Z459|5.0|This really is a RRRRRRRocking great piece of Nu-Metal from <BR>one of the best bands ever. I particularly banged my head to <BR>One Step Closer, Papercut and In the End.<br />Good luck to the guys on all their future work. I can't wait for the follow up.
6304675348|4.0|Hey I just saw &quot;Scream&quot; and well I don't know what to tell you the whole movie was crack up funny. I recomend this to someone that don't like scary movies... it's one to actually laugh at. Well other then that... after you see it see &quot;Scary Movie&quot; ... it will be really crack up funny after that.... Hope you are freeky and go rent it.

B000059Z8J|5.0|At long last Superman gets the treatment he deserves.  This movie is a classic piece of Americana.  The DVD has fully restored the movie to its original glory.  In fact, it's even better than the original!  The soundtrack has been fully restored.  The sound-effects have been cleaned up and in some places replaced with newer, cleaner ones.  The film itself has been restored and now glows on the screen.  We finally get to see Superman in widescreen format as he was meant to be seen.  A few scenes have been added which make it a more complete movie.<br />This alone would make the DVD a worthy investment, but it has much more extra stuff on it too!  It comes with three documentaries that feature interviews with Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz, the creative team that made Superman the Movie what it is.  They are hosted by Marc McClure (Jimmy Olsen).  They also include interviews with Christopher Reeve, Gene Hackman, and Margot Kidder, as well as others.  You also get to see the screen tests from Chris Reeve, Margot Kidder and others.  You can even listen to audio commentary from Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz during the movie.  Included is a synopsis of the history of Superman.  You can also see the filmographies of some of the cast including Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman.<br />If you're a Superman fan, and even if you're not, BUY THIS DVD!
0767853636|4.0|Annie is the type of movie that I loved when I was 8 or 9 years old. I remember being mesmerized by the songs and the storyline! It was my absolute favorite movie during that time. Unfortunately, after watching Annie hundreds of times, I moved on to other movies.<br />Annie came on TV last year and my interest was renewed. I also loved the songs that I ignored when I was 8 years old, for example, &quot;We Got Annie&quot;.
B00003CXA2|1.0|I was really excited to see this come to DVD, but after watching the release on a good HDTV I was really dissapointed.  The quality of the transfer is just plain bad.  Compression artifacts really detract from the film.  If you have an old TV you won't notice, but if you have a good one, skip this disc.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I have not yet listened to the CD, but I've heard several exerpts from it, and it is everything one would expect from John Williams.  It has your essential Williamsesque cinematic theme music, of course, but the main theme is magical, sometimes spooky, sometimes whimsical...Kind of reminds me a bit of Edward Scissorhands, or something from the Nutcracker.  There are some other types of music in there, too, and it will be so neat to see how they are used! If you're wondering, yes I've read the books, and loved them -- and yes it fits!  A movie like this depends SO MUCH on the music, and listening to it makes me so much more excited to see it!  Even as I listen to it now, it's sending chills down my spine!  I am SO going to buy this CD!
0465068359|4.0|Iris Changs The Rape of Nanking undeniably accomplishes its primary goal: to ensure that no one reading the book will be able to forget the brutality and horror of Japans incursion into Nanking, which left some 300,000 Chinese soldiers and civilians dead and numerous others horribly disfigured.  Her detailed description of the treatment of women by the Japanese soldiers is particularly effective in this respect, and properly shines a light on the sorts of practices that often go unchronicled in wartime narratives.<br />She is somewhat less effective in giving a compelling account of why the Japanese did what they did.  She points to the abusive treatment of Japanese soldiers by their officers, notions of racial superiority, and religion, but in my mind fails to give a systemic explanation for the scope of the brutality.  Perhaps such a task is impossible.  But her attempts to do so seem to rest on stereotypical notions of Japanese behavior, and do not seem to be as sufficiently grounded in historical research as the rest of the work. <br />I also find unconvincing some of her contentions that support her argument that the massacre was forgotten for political reasons.  As one reviewer has pointed out, her assertion that Americans never fully understood the scope of the tragedy is not precisely correct; rather, it would be more precise to say that recent generations of Americans (including my own) have no real knowledge of the tragedy.  I also have some difficulty acceptingalthough I have no knowledge to the contrarythe way in which the author portrays mainstream Japan as failing to accept the seemingly irrefutable evidence of the existence and scope of the atrocity<br />From a historicist perspective, the most important portion of the work is the authors discovery of the extent to which European members of the safety zone saved the lives of countless Chinese. The information contained in their personal diaries provides irrefutable proof of the scope of the massacre. <br />The Rape of Nanking is requisite reading for anyone who seeks to understand the bounds of humanitys capacity for brutality.
630027179X|4.0|The setting and the mystical atmosphere of the film is why I rated it 4 stars. The character development was very one dimensional, playing good against evil. It touches on Lancelot's and Gwenivere's betrayal but does not give much info on how or why they fell for each other, except for chemical attraction. Seems a bit flimsy to risk everything, (the kingdom, arthur's love, etc.)just for this. <BR>     <BR>     But the scenes and the acting of Merlin and Morgana were great! Helen Mirren was wonderful as an evil half-sister. Her character was crazed with a desire to be powerful and did not get developed as it did in the book. The movie did not go into her love for Lancelot mainly just revolving around her cold-heartedness. She was for a short time paired up with Gawain, but mainly had a sick dysfunctional relationship with her son, which eventually brought on their destruction. She may have been attracted to Merlin as he to her, but it only danced on this.<BR>     <BR>     Arthur's struggle to be a King and a man was what the movie was trying to show and how he accepts his role of King, which places him in a realm above man, he realizes that he must be a man in another lifetime. <BR>     <BR>     Several actors I had no idea were in the movie when I first saw it stood out, Liam Neeson as Gawain and Gabriel Bryne as King Uther. The mood and the mystical apparations were unique and it sparked my imagination! <br />Lisa Nary
B00000JPYQ|4.0|nearly every track on this CD is strong, with the standouts being &quot;lights out&quot; and &quot;rock bottom.&quot;  shenker is as technical and consistent as a rock guitarist can be.  a real sleeper album from a sleeper band that deserved much more attention than they ever got.
0446364495|3.0|This is a story about a woman named Francesca and a man named Robert. In one scene, Francesca is preparing a meatless stew and Robert is talking to her. Here's a snippet of their conversation: <br />&quot;'It already smells good,' he said, pointing toward the stove. 'It smells . . . quiet.' He looked at her.<br />&quot;'Quiet? Could something smell quiet?' She was thinking about the phrase, asking herself. He was right. After the pork chops and steaks and roasts she cooked for the family, this was quiet cooking. No violence involved anywhere down the food chain, except maybe for pulling up the vegetables. The stew cooked quietly and smelled quiet. It was quiet here in the kitchen.&quot; <br />I honor and admire the sensitivity of the man who wrote those words, which is why I have read most of Waller's work. His &quot;Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend&quot; was particularly enjoyable (maybe even better than &quot;Bridges&quot;) but I LOATHED &quot;Border Music.&quot; But even though Waller is certainly not a great writer, I'll always keep an eye out for his work, because, as I said in my title, I like his SENSE, and I like his SENSIBILITY.
B00005O3VD|5.0|We has the good fortune to see the newly restored version of FUNNY GIRL on the big screen last month. There were 6 of us in our group (3 men &amp; 3 women) and we all loved every minute of it. The colors in the new print are fabulous, the soundtrack is enhanced, &amp; Barbra is even better than you expect her to be. So here's my question: why was there so little hype for the theatrical re-release of this wonderful film?!?!?<br />I sent this question to the Internet Movie Database &amp; I was told that FUNNY GIRL was &quot;not a groundbreaking movie or even an important one.&quot;<br />Well, now, let's just look @ this a little closer.  Watching it again for the first time in 30 years, one thing that amazed me was how deliberately Wyler had framed Streisand's famous nose. In many scenes, her face is shown in profile against a dark background, so that &quot;the bump&quot; is very pronounced. This actually occurs when she's singing PEOPLE, her big &quot;romantic number.&quot;<br />We are used to hearing that De Niro &amp; Pacino changed the standard of on-screen beauty &amp; made &quot;ethnic&quot; stars acceptable, but it should now be clear that the bulldozer that broke this barrier was Streisand. There she is, surrounded by gorgeous chorus girls, but no one can have any question about who &quot;the star&quot; is.<br />One final comment: FUNNY GIRL was originally released in 1968, in other words about 5 years before the first publication of MS Magazine &amp; the dawn of the Women's Movement.  But here's this woman asserting herself &amp; taking control.  Framing her on that tugboat, &amp; sending her plowing right in front of the Statue of Liberty is the most aggressive declaration of reaching out for the American Dream that I know of -- in what other country could a woman even dream of such a thing?<br />With all due respect, I suggest folks take another look @ this film before thinking they can consign it to the dustbin of history.  I can't wait to add the DVD to my permanent collection!!!
0425180638|4.0|After dissing &quot;Black Notice,&quot; I felt a little foolish picking up yet another Patricia Cornwell, but I liked this one a lot better. Not that there weren't the same improbabilities and grating personalities as before. Maybe I've just stopped expecting logical plotting and likeable characters.  <br />While a lot of readers didn't care for the probing into Scarpetta's psyche, I've always enjoyed that sort of thing, and frankly, it was refreshing to seek some excuse for her self-obsessed, paranoid attitude. Never mind that everyone IS actually after her. How did a woman who's so universally distrusted keep her job this long?<br />It also probably helped my enjoyment that Superniece made only limited appearances, flying in for the rescue, of course, but pulling off her usual stunning accomplishment per book (this time becoming a millionaire) off stage. <br />What I liked was the forensic clues, some sharp writing, the plot twists and finally finding out things we should have learned in the last book. Since Cornwell's obviously into bringing back characters from the past, my vote goes to Mr. Peanut. As one of the few sympathetic players in the story, I'd like to see a sequel in which she returns to nip at the ankles of Scarpetta and her whining posse and then finds a loving home with some well-adjusted person who would obviously have to be created by another author.
B00003IPFK|4.0|<br />I never watched this miniseries on television. It was before I finally saw Silverado on video and realized that Hollywood could still make an epic western and have fun with it, and before Dances With Wolves, long before Unforgiven. What makes those movies work? Character, humor, tragedy, action. All of the pieces are here, with the exception of the sense of hugeness that the book provides does not fit well in to the confines of the TV screen. It is shot a bit tight for my taste. But it is deservedly referred to as an epic and a landmark television event. <br /><br />Duvall and Jones are in top form and Gus and Call. The cast as a whole works better than any other literary adaptation that I can recall. Robert Urich makes Jake much more despicable than I originally thought would've been possible. Huston, Lane, Rick Schroder, Danny Glover as Deets, all deliver.<br /><br />Keep in mind that it is 6 hours worth of television - if you want to get it all in at once, you're going to have some explaining to do.
0790729652|5.0|This is the best of the four Batman movies. There are many reasons for this. The first reason is it has the best plot. It also has the best villian, the joker. Another reason is that Michale Keaton was the best batman ever! It may not have as much action as the others but it is still the best. Next to this movie &quot;Batman Returns&quot; is the best. Then &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and then &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;. In other words the order in which the movies came out. I hope they make more batman movies like the first two.
0140386335|5.0|Join Bastian Balthazar Bux as he experiences The Neverending Story. After finding himself in Mr. Koreander's bookshop, Bastian \\"borrows\\" a book that caught his eye as soon as he went inside the shop, \\"The Neverending Story.\\" When he begins reading the book, he finds himself becoming part of the story, until finally he enters the world of Phantasien (Fantastica in the translation) where it is his responsibility to save the world of imagination from destruction. Follow him as he visits places like the Silver City, the Seeing Hand, the Cave of Dreams, the Changing House, the Ivory Tower, and so many more amazing places.<br />Ende's The Neverending Story is a book full of fantasy, magic and hope. It is a marvelous read for people of all ages. I have never read the English translation, but the original German just has so much power! The message of this book is very poignant. If you liked the movies, you will absolutely love the book! The first movie follows the first part of the book almost exactly. The other two movies (which I was very disappointed with) deviate tremendously from the book. If your exposure to The Neverending Story has only been through the three movies, you must read this book. Find out what you missed in the second two movies.<br />This book is full of many amazing characters that you will remember for the rest of your life. You will want to read this book over and over again just to meet all the unique characters again. This will be a book that you treasure for life. Recently, I lost my copy of the book, and I am just devastated. I don't know where I will find another copy of it in German because it is out of print. Hold onto your copy of the book, English or German (but especially German)! You'll love it!
B000050XEI|5.0|I own one or two other Enya releases. She definitely creates a mood with this one. I've not heard much press on this, but would certainly recommend it as a good selection if you are inclined to like Enya, The Clannad or other such group.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I got to hear the album before the release, and it is awesome.  Every track sounds great.  Finally, something fresh and new to hear on the radio.  These songs sounds like nothing else to hit the radio this year and what a relief!<br />Congrats Enrique on your album which I know will be a success!
0805047905|5.0|The children (ages 2-4) will really enjoy this book. They usually enjoy reading it themselves with little prompting. The illustration keep busy minds interested in what will come next.
0930289331|4.0|Dark, gritty, and striking. This is a crime story pure and simple, even if it does involve a man in a costume. Two things are suprising: that it focuses more on James Gordon, then on Batman and that it works. If there is anything that I don't like about the book is the portrayal of Catwoman. I don't know why she is even in here to begin with. What I like most is that Miller shows Batman fighting real evils like organized crime and police corruption.
0399226907|5.0|You kids (ages 2-5) are in for a treat as the caterpillar eats and the reader reads through the book. This book has plenty of fingerholes for kids to use when each section is read. Very entertaining for both reader and listener!
B0000057C5|5.0|These guys are on fire,literaly. Their music is just so explosive<BR>and just makes you wanna jump around & drink heavily. The energy<BR>from their concerts is worth a see,even if you really don't know<BR>who they are,just go see em,they'll be your favorite band ever.<BR>What's better than than huge blasts of fire shooting off the stage,loud thrashing guitar chords,and a big... german man using himself as a human torch. Most people just know Du Hast, good song,but they have better check out their past albums, especially Herzelind.
630416923X|5.0|The Beatles Anthology is probily the best beatles story I've ever wached, and I've seen plenty,. This 10 hour video collection is so good. The Best way to wach it is one part a day.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a spectacular movie. It has a great story line and the love story in the movie is tear jerking. It has such a surprise ending, and it...it's awesome! Not only does it have the hottest guy in the world (josh hartnett), but it also has great special effects and spectacular acting. This is definitely my favorite movie and I encourage everyone to buy it, and some kleenex too :) thanx
B00005QG9J|4.0|In my opinion, Incubus is one of the most unique and talented bands in today's music world.  I was anticipating the release of &quot;Morning View&quot; for a very long time because I have been following Brandon and the boys ever since they released &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.,&quot; and I was curious to see how the band was going to follow up the success of &quot;Make Yourself.&quot;  I knew that Incubus was going to drift into a lighter musical state on the new album, but I also wanted the band to remain heavy and continue in the steps of songs like &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; and &quot;New Skin.&quot;  &quot;Morning View&quot; is an amazing album, but it isn't as catchy as &quot;Make Yourself.&quot;  However, it does have its moments...<br />The album opens up with &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; which is along the lines of &quot;Privledge,&quot; the opening track on &quot;Make Yourself.&quot;  The song is heavy in the beginning, but, then it slips into a melodic trance followed by a catchy hook.  I knew the album was going to be interesting after hearing that track.  There are a few other heavy tracks on the album that are worth a listen.  &quot;Circles&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; are excellent and they remind me of tracks that could be found on &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; and &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot;  The album is dominated by slower, more radio-friendly tracks, such as the present single &quot;Wish You Were Here.&quot;  My personal favorite track on &quot;Morning View,&quot; &quot;Echo,&quot; is a song that reminds me of &quot;I MIss You,&quot; but it is a little bit heavier and has an incredibly catchy melody.  The acoustic sounds of &quot;Mexico&quot; remain in your mind throughout the day, even if you haven't listened to the song for a long time.  Brandon's voice is so soothing on tracks like &quot;Mexico&quot; and &quot;Echo,&quot; but he doesn't forget how to yell and screech on &quot;Morning View.&quot;<br />If you are a true Incubus fan and decide to purchase &quot;Morning View,&quot; you might not recognize the band the first time you listen to the album.  However, the songs grow on you quickly.  I still believe that &quot;Make Yourself&quot; is an incredible piece of musical art, which is why I favor that album over Incubus' new efforts.  I am glad that Incubus in moving into a new direction musically because, today, there are a lot of bands that sound exactly the same.  Listening to &quot;Morning View&quot; is refreshing, and it takes you away from the tired songs on the radio for an hour.  It is definately an amazing effort.
6302759110|5.0|Although inaccurate, Francis Ford Coppola's rendition of Dracula is the most accurate compared to any other ever made.  The story sways quite a bit from the novel, giving it a gothic romance overtone instead of that of horror.  It centers on the Count's and Mina's relationship, adding in plenty of tidbits from the novel as it goes along.  Jonathan Harker, who is poorly played by Keanu Reeves, still goes to Transylvania to meet the Count.  There is still Lucy, who is the count's first victim, getting killed more vividly by the wolf.  The investigation of the count is abridged, coming into a climatic ending in the Count's native land.    <BR>     The charismatic Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Dr. Van Helsing is very exceptional.  But Gary Oldman as Dracula blows him away.  He puts feeling into every line from the old, evil count to the young, charming, and animalic one.  His performance is unrivaled by any other Dracula performer and never will be equalled.  It's a shame he didn't get that Academy Award for best actor back then.  Winona Ryder as Mina is very lady-like and shows longing for the count.  But Keanu Reaves as Jonathan Harker is a very bland interpretation.  He puts little feeling into his words.  Even his screams as he's being attacked by Dracula's devil women sound very fake.  Reinfield's character provides some humor.  <BR>   But as soon as you see the old Drac on the screen, you'll be amazed.  The makeup put on Gary Oldman to make him look pale, creepy and literally older can't help but make your mouth drop.  The special effects of this film contrast beautifully with the live effects.  In the count's keep, you have to admire the architectual excellence of the arches, rooms, right down to the furniture.  It gives you a sense that everything really was from an ancient period of time.  Gary Oldman's transformation from old to young startles you.  It goes from the pale complexion to the younger, livelier one with the facial hair and more fashionable clothing.  Every bit of clothing in the film seems right to date with the times.<BR>       If you like Stoker's novels, Coppola's films, or Dracula: get this movie.  It's worth it!
B000001DZM|4.0|Many great songs included and fabulous dresses!
B000002BHE|5.0|What more has to be said? This album is terrific, the best song's are 'call the man, because you loved me, make you happy, i love you and i don't know' Buy this album,today!
B00005QG9J|3.0|Now I love incubus, but come on. There is absolutely no funk on this album what-so-ever and where are Brian's crazy raps? If you listen to science and then you listen to this CD they don't even sound like the same band. Now bands can mature, or have an evolving sound like 311 does, but when you take everything out of your band that makes it original, and then replace it with the same sound every other manufatured rock band has these days it doesn't look like your exploring it just looks like you are trying to sell records. Brian Boyd &quot;singing&quot; gets annoying by track 4. The first song is pretty sweet, it has some killer rhymes. Their &quot;drive&quot; re-make &quot;wish you were here&quot; is o.k., the only stand out song though is &quot;Aqueous Tranmission&quot;, one of my favorite incubus songs to date. If most of this CD had the level of originality that track 13 has, it would be a much better CD. The only thing that evem makes the whole CD listenable is the atmosphere they have added to their songs, but that doesn't take a genius to do. In fact it was done much better on 311's Transistor. The bottom line is if you like popular rock that your going to see on MTV, but this CD. But if you've got the funk in you don't buy this. Buy SCIENCE and Parliament's Mothership Connection!
B00003CXA4|5.0|This is a great DVD. Includes insights from Ben Kingsley, and original newsreels of Ghandi himself.  Everyone who loved the movie and loves India should buy this DVD!
B00003CY0V|5.0|Great movie.  I hate John Travolta but he actullay does a good job in this movie.  This is a must buy!
B00005OMTT|5.0|Every single song is a beauty, but I particularly like \\"turn around\\", \\"gravity of love\\", \\"silence must be heard\\", and \\"smell of desire\\". They did some digital fine tuning to all the songs to make them sound even better. Germany and Italy usually produce the best music in the world.......so RUN to buy this cd, pop it in your player and hit PLAY and let this...take you to another world !!!
B00003CX9E|5.0|It took me until last week to finally see Citizen Kane, the so-called greatest american film ever made.  Such a subjective idea-greatest of all time.  However, Citizen Kane is truly a masterpiece.  Taken in isolation or in the historical context this is one movie that works just about way you look at it.  Welles' best?  Matter of debate, but it is undeniablely one of the masterworks of cinema.  It is a brillant film in structure, techinque, and overall emotional pull.  <br />The best part?  Well, that is an individual choice.  The print is so pristinet that you might have thought it was shot with a digital camera (well, George Lucas is no Orson Welles).  Both commentary tracks are fascinating (Ebert just won a major award for best commentary track of '01), if a bit dry.  The documentary on disk II sparked a fascination about both men (welles and Hearst) in me.  Just look at the film clips in the doc, you won't believe how amazing the new transfer is.  This entire film--the story, the script, the backstory, thefights--etc. is an important part of our history.  This preserves it.  Also, see HBO's RKO 281 about the battle.  It is not great cinema, but well worth the watch.  Next up, the new bio of Hearst. <br />This movie will change you.  It is well worth the praise.
B000002C4J|5.0|This CD is Celine's best work. Some of my favorite songs are, Treat her like a lady, love is on the way, and why oh why. You should really buy this album today, if you don't already have it:-)
B00004THAY|5.0|One of the best blues albums to come out in years.<BR>Have been waiting a long time to hear these two together.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|You can't keep a good man down, well not if he's Bob Dylan anyway. Just when we all thought he had finally passed into the tragic land of mediocrity, he surprised everyone with the Grammy Award-winning Time Out Of Mind. A dark record, that found Dylan finally surviving on his self-styled desolation row, it told of a bleak future for us all.  <br />However, it seems those days are behind him. Not only has this master of surprise come back with a record as good as his last, he has also found a lightness that has eluded him for years. <br />Love And Theft is such an echo of the Dylan of old, in spirit at least, that you wonder what he's been taking for the past couple of years and, frankly, if we could have some too. For one thing, he has returned to poetry, rather than stark realism. Many of his old cast of characters are back, including Romeo and Juliet, preachers, bootleggers, Othello and the Devil; and they are up to all sorts of mischief. But more than that, it's the sound. <br />Recorded live, with Dylan's long-serving road band, this is a stripped down, salt-of-the-earth production. <br />This is no more evident than on the opener, Tweedle Dum &amp; Tweedle Dee, which rips along, poking fun at the world. Similarly, Lonesome Day Blues and Honest With Me have elements of Highway 61 Revisited with their driving guitars and guttural lyrics. <br />However, the standout track is Mississippi, in which Dylan, in a moment of both sadness and caustic humour, notes that &quot;You can always come back, but you can't come back all the way&quot;. Maybe not, but it's clear that Bob isn't done with yet, not by a long shot.
0393307050|4.0|Okay, first of all, four stars because: while I enjoyed this book immensely, had nothing but admiration for the research that must have gone into it, and the author's ability to project his imagination back to 1800 and to induce, from what must have been the careful perusal of a lot of dry documents at the Public Record Office at Kew, a whole way of life and mode of speech - still, still, still, something at the back of my mind is nagging at me that O'Brian's novels might not, in fact, be a sort of really good airport literature.<br />Who knows?  Maybe that means they'll survive longer than a lot of &quot;proper&quot; literature - perhaps, in centuries to come (if there _are_ any centuries to come), people will regard O'Brian as one of the great late 20th century novelists and David Foster Wallace or Bret Easton Ellis will be forgotten.  Shakespeare hardly ever set a play in his own time and place (&quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; is the only one I can think of.)  <br />But I've read a few of the Aubrey/Maturin series by now and while I still enjoy them hugely, I think I'm beginning to pin down their appeal.  They read like the Regency novels we never actually got to read.  These guys are, if you like, the barely-glimpsed romantic nauticals in Austen's &quot;Persuasion&quot;, except this time it's from their point of view.  O'Brian, writing in the 70s/80s/90s, can use swearwords with impunity (and does - the f-word only ever gets spelled out when it's used amongst equals, the rest of the time being represented as a hyphen, in canny pastiche 18th-century manner).  There is a prodigal scattering of jargon (his diction is infectious, as you can see) which makes us modern readers feel pleasantly ignorant and lubberly.  There is a largely unquestioned respect for military prowess and a certain lack of curiosity about the ends to which this prowess is put.<br />I say &quot;largely&quot; because, for a sceptical left-winger like me, the presence of ex-United IrishmanStephen Maturin is what saves these books from just being gentlemen's club entertainments.  Maturin is the more worried, worrying character than his friend Jack.  Jack does the heroics, fer shure, but Stephen is the one who gets to reflect on what's going on, and here O'Brian's irresponsible creative power subverts his Old Tory instincts.  Maturin gets to criticise the government - albeit privately, in his diary, and his public actions remain staunchly loyal - but still, he is the main focus of dissent and reflection in the whole series.  Sorry to reduce it all to politics, but this is a book I thought I'd never enjoy - some very stupid people have praised it and I'm trying to reclaim it for my own side.  But then, I haven't read all twenty-odd books in this series so perhaps it gets more complicated.<br />Part of the pleasure of these books is of course the chance to escape into an utterly different world, and O'Brian is brilliant at creating that world.  They talk a bit different, they shamelessly drink humongous quantities of alcohol, they make crap jokes, and it's all very clubby and fun.  And there's nothing wrong with that.  These books are superb entertainment, and in their scrupulous attention to historical detail they are deeply interesting and conscientious works of art.  But, in terms of story, they fall down.  They are really fictional chronicles - things happen, the main characters bowl along, and they keep on doing so for twenty volumes.  But as for the moral power of story to make us reflect on the characters, I don't see a lot of that going on.  It's sort of Naval Soap.  (Again, I haven't read all the books so perhaps I have yet more to learn.)<br />O'Brian's death means that there'll be no more.  It's perhaps a shame that he never got to write a single, classic, consummating volume - that he never got to write the &quot;War and Peace&quot; that he always seemed to be threatening to do.  But in the meantime, they're great fun.  I'm just not sure that their ease and dash makes them better books than some more knotty, contemporary writing I could think of.
6305363668|4.0|&quot;Blade Runner&quot; had a very odd theatrical release: the first audiences saw different versions of the film (the studio recut it depending on what they heard from moviegoers). Just goes to show you - never rely on what the average viewer says. &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is much, much better without the hokey, noirish voice-over and uplifting finale. Harrison Ford, by his own admission, said he hated the narration and deliberately botched it (so the producers kept it, natch). And isn't it common coin in Hollywood to jam in a happy ending?<br />Fortunately, the trend of &quot;director's cuts&quot; came along at the right time. The real &quot;Blade Runner&quot; could have easily languished in Warner Bros. vaults while fans put up with the Embassy VHS (which I own) and subsequent DVD transfer. As of this review, most people hate the DVD handling, but the &quot;Director's Cut&quot; VHS is worth keeping your VCR around.<br />The film is the superior vision of life on a downward spiral, and its dizzying, tantalizing glimpses of a not-so-futuristic megalopolis are arresting. After reading Philp K. Dick's novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; and seeing the movie, it is obvious that the original message about replicated humans is far more ominous than the original theatrical version can convey. The burning question is obvious: is Ford's character a replicant himself? Does his brutal dispatch of the dangerous androids represent murder, or just disposal?<br />In the end, the fantastic, impossible world created by Dick, and made flesh by Ridley Scott, is the real draw of &quot;Blade Runner.&quot; To rely on a voice-over for plot clarity is to miss the point.<br />Vangelis' score and myriad aural touches add to the oppressive atmosphere. Subsequent sci-fi films have copied the &quot;Blade Runner&quot; look; all of them pale in comparison. Even if the studio were to somehow cobble up a sequel, it'd never recapture the look or feel of the real thing.
6300182282|5.0|It's hard to summarize what a great movie this is!  This movie clearly defines the true meaning of love and the sacrifices that it sometimes requires.  The movie was wonderfully written and perfectly casted.  It will make you laugh out loud as well as cry out loud. Be prepared to let it move you.
0792833236|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever.  I consider it to be a part of the \\"Holy Trinity\\" if you will of Scorsese movies (with Taxi Driver and Goodfellas completed the trio).  It has what may be De Niro's best performance ever (it is hard to decide between this and Taxi Driver).  The scene where Joey(Pesci) is going to his car and Jake(De Niro) practically begs him to forgive him particularly struck me as brilliant acting.  It also has superb directing, cinematography, and dialogue.  In fact, when it isn't a fight scene, this movie is all about great dialogue and interaction between the characters.  Joe Pesci is great as De Niro's brother, and Cathy Moriarty is great as his wife.<BR>     In case you haven't seen it this film is about the rise and fall of Jake La Motta a prize fighter from the forties who is extremely paranoid.  He constantly is thinking that his wife is cheating on him, and even goes so far as to accuse his brother of having an affair with her(\\"Joey, did you f**k my wife?\\" \\"What kind of a question is that? I won't answer it. It's a stupid question and I won't answer it.\\").  I am not really sure whether she actually did ever cheat on him but she does say that she did, but I think that that is just to ... off Jake or something.  Anyway, you can decide for yourself.  <BR>     For like the first 15 minutes, I thought that this movie was going to ... because the black and white picture looked crappy but I think that that is because I was watching an old VHS copy that I had rented from Blockbuster, but anyway I got used to it and I'm sure that the DVD version looks great.  I am going to buy this on DVD as soon as I get some money(I'm only 16 so money is kinda tight), because I just bought the wonderful Godfather DVD Collection which you also might want to take a look at if you are interested in this movie because it is also right up their with Scorsese's Holy Trinity.
B00001NFCY|5.0|Most critics and pop music trainspotters didn't give Creed's 1997 debut My Own Prison much credit upon its release, even though it wound up going multi-platinum. At the time, they seemed like one of many heavy post-grunge guitar outfits -- especially to the disinterested observers who tend to name genres and classify bands. So, when the group unleashed their second album, Human Clay, in 1999, the industry, critics, and record collectors alike were stunned, positively stunned, when it entered the charts at number one, then stayed in the upper reaches of the charts for months on end. Nobody could figure out why this group managed to not just survive, but thrive when such fellow travelers as Our Lady Peace fell by the wayside. After all, at the time, not only were post-grunge bands dying, but so were such grunge heavyweights as Pearl Jam and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell. Listening to Human Clay doesn't really reveal any insights, either, since it is hard rock rooted firmly in the Seattle vein, complete with really big riffs and intensely introspective lyrics. Then, a realization sets in: Unlike their influences -- from Pearl Jam and Alice in Chains to Stone Temple Pilots -- Creed is happy to be a rock band. Their music may not be particularly joyous and they may even favor foreboding, heavy riffs, but they're not trying to stretch into political causes or worldbeat like Pearl Jam; they're not reveling in dark psychedelia like Soundgarden; nor are they attempting a glam Abbey Road like Stone Temple Pilots. Creed is a straightforward grunge and hard rock band, embracing everything that goes along with that, and doing it pretty well. They might not have as strong an identity as their forefathers, but they're not faceless, especially in the late '90s, an era when most popular hard rock is either rap-rock, industrial-tinged, or plain out thuggish (at times, of course, it's all three). Creed has more class than that and they write relatively solid riffs and hooks. It may notbe the kind of thing that knocks out critics or grunge purists, but it does deliver for anyone looking for direct, grunge-flavored hard rock. Within that realm, the band does mix things up a bit -- it's not all mid-tempo sludge, for there are also ballads and some high-octane, up-tempo rockers -- and that makes Human Clay a stronger, better-paced record than its predecessor, which wasn't bad either. It's hard to tell on the basis of these two records if Creed has staying power. However, Human Clay does make it clear that there is an audience for post-grunge hard rock, as long as it's delivered without pretension and as long as it meets the audience's desire for straight-ahead, hard-hitting music.
B000002LQR|3.0|Ok three stars cause they could almost transcend their audiemce.<BR>Here's a missed opportunity. These guys are basically good musicians. The problem? They convey a know-it-all pessimism, an emotional armour so thick their funk never swings but stays martial. <br />It's like the bandwidth of their emotion-spectrum is truncated and won't allow them to feel/convey either humor or heartbreak. There can't be any soul without the far-end of feeling. The quote ballad unquote &quot;Under the Bridge&quot; doesn't go nearly far enough.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This is simply the worst film I have ever seen. Do yourselves a favor and don't even think about watching it, let alone buying it. The entire film is pointless and doesn't make any sense. When I watched it in the theatre people were laughing, and began talking half way through because it was so pathetic.
B00005BL2A|3.0|i've been waiting for a comeback album.  not to draw a parallel to u2, but if they could revive and produce &quot;all that you can't leave behind&quot;, dm should definitely pull their guts for a finally good one.  i'm still waiting...
B00005R23S|5.0|How many bands 26 years later still claim all of their original members(ok, all the origianl members from the &quot;Born To Run&quot; album and forward)? none other than Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The original E Streeters like &quot;Little Steve&quot;, &quot;The Big Man,&quot; &quot;The Proffesor,&quot; Max Weinberg, Dan Federici, Neils Lofgren, Gary Talent, and of course The Boss man himself were the same crew who originally performed Thunder Road on Febuary 5 1975 (my birthday). <BR>Last year I bought a DVD player with the anticipation that their tour would be an upcoming feature for home viewing. Even After attending 5 shows between 1999 and 2000(3 at the garden and 2 in Jersey), I missed a few B-sides which Bruce and band have graciously thrown into the video lineup(one of which includes Jungleland). You also get a little &quot;NYC Seranade&quot; and the &quot;E-Street Shuffle.&quot;<BR>B-sides the special throw ins, the MSG DVD, half of which is from the HBO special, promises to be twice as good.
B00004X0ER|5.0|I heard these guys on indie station XFM in London.<br />I bought the album from Amazon and just fell in love with it.  This band are young, dumb and full of it.  Just like any great punk band.<br />I loved it so much I went to see them in London last week.  They were just simply excellent.  Buy this album and tell a friend
B000059Z8J|5.0|Should be the title of this DVD.  You watch this film and you realize that Richard Donner had his finger on what Superman should be.  His skillful handling of this film mixed with the mentioned &quot;what might have beens&quot; of Superman II makes you yearn that the Salkinds would have left Donner in charge of the franchise.  If you love Superman, if you love the story of an American hero, if you love the a love story, this is the movie for you.  Buy it.  Own it.  Watch it alot.
078401213X|5.0|This is truly an excellent movie. One of the best in my collection. I have seen it over 15 times and I still love to watch it.
B000002ULO|5.0|I know a lot of people say that Flaming Pie doesn't live up to the standards of Sir Paul's previous material, but I personally think that Flaming Pie is my favourite of his albums. It's got everything on, from the beautifully haunting melody and guitar backing of 'Little Willow' to the driving energetic Rock 'n' Roll of 'Used to be Bad'. It's a very varied album, and I think that anyone who says they don't like McCartney should listen to this. Absoluteley brilliant!
B00003CXXI|5.0|This movie is one of the better movies that has come out of Hollywood lately. The first time I saw it was with my five year old son. He insisted we see it again and again...we saw it in the theatre FIVE TIMES! Everytime you see this movie, something new and different will hit--like the square flower arrangements in Farquaad's mansion, or the realistic leaves blowing in the &quot;wind&quot;. This movie is appropriate for most age levels and almost all humor levels. It's amazing.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is my first New Age music purchase, although I enjoy Techno and New Age music and I have heard and appreciated several songs by Enya in the past.  I usualy prefer fast-paced Techno, but my favorites are those rare, spine-tingling pieces that speak to my soul.  I bought this CD for the highly popular song &quot;Only Time,&quot; but I found that I love the whole album.  When I first heard that song, I knew I had to buy the CD.  When I try to relax and concentrate on that song, it can give me goosebumps and send me to a mind-altered state - a truely spiritual experience that is beyond merely &quot;relaxing.&quot;  It is my all-time favorite song and encouraged me to buy &quot;Paint the Sky with Stars.&quot;
0345440757|5.0|This book is a jewel. I recommend it for both first time parents and for experienced parents. I bought it when I was about to have my second child and it helped a lot. Even though it is mostly common sense advice, well, parenthood deprives us of our common sense sometimes. Hogg's book is witty, funny, full of information and super easy to read.
0767830520|5.0|All the so called 'hype' this movie has generated is warranted and then some:nothing quite compares to it.  Something, to put it mildly, just went right.  The claustraphobic atmosphere of meaninglessness, alienation and pure depravity that Scorsese creates is nothing less than perfect. The all consuming glow of streetlamps, traffic signals and headlights allow us to see New York City as Travis sees it, a crowded hell where human being is separated from human being and 'survival of the fittest' is the brutal norm. De Niro's performance is beyond exceptional, it is transcendent.  He absolutely becomes Travis Bickle, a very lost and lonely young war veteran in a city full of people who seem to be asleep. For all intents and purposes, Robert De Niro no longer exists within the running time of this movie:indeed, he so good as Travis that he is sometimes much more frightening than the 'scum', like Harvey Keitel, that his character despises so much. If you've ever felt alone or marginalized in your life, this movie will immediately strike a deep chord with you.  I disagree, however, with interpreters who think that we are supposed to hate and revile Travis and see him as a sick, 'crazed loner' looking for any excuse to satiate his bloodthirsty rage. I would say that, on the contrary, Scorsese's timeless masterpiece is a work of the deepest empathy and compassion.  Travis Bickle is every man and woman who has felt abandoned and lost in a dark and seemingly insane world.  His self perceived 'moral superiority' is indeed a narcissistic delusion and a defense mechanism, but his feelings of rage and hatred toward a blind and sick society are very real and well founded indeed. I was hard pressed to find much optimism or hope in this movie, and our hero (or anti hero) is as sick and irretrievably lost at the end as he is at the beginning. It is basically a work of alarming pessimism and desperation, similar in many ways to George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;. Any lover or student of film should buy this movie without hesitation.film should buy this movie without hesitation.
B00004ZEQX|3.0|A college professor agrees to complete the research project of a faculty member who went mad and killed his assitant. In an unwise move, he and his family take up residence at the same house that the insane prof lived and killed. Would you move into an old house with a tomb in the living room and where gruesome murders have happened? Didn't think so, but if the lead characters hadn't done so then there would be no movie.<br />The couple's young son is plagued with visions of violence and befriended by the spectre (maybe, maybe not) of a kind young girl.<br />And something seems to be living in the basement.<br />Tight narrative was never Lucio Fulci's strong point, but he did use atmosphere and, in particular, sound effects to good effect. House by the Cemetary is not his best film (that would be The Beyond in my opine), but it is gruesome and creepy enough to fill the second half of a b-movie double bill.
B000002AQQ|5.0|The music on this double CD definds a period of history (much like the film sought to do). If you're new to 60's and 70's music, but are interested in the music then this is an excellent album to start off your collection. From Dylan to the Doors and from Presley to Picket it has a lot of classics from the era and in fact a lot of tracks that are not in the original film.<br />For someone who already has a lot of albums from the 60's and 70's then you will probably find a lot of familiar tracks on this album, nevertheless it works wonders as a compilation and there is bound to be quite a few tracks that you don't have.<br />Certainly give the album a listen and then make up your mind. For lovers of 60's and 70's music you will be doing yourself a favour by adding this to your collection.
B000002OX7|5.0|I recently watched the benefit concert for New York, which included several of rock n rolls best..I enjoyed performances by the Stones and Paul McCartney, but their sets sputtered when compared to the sheer sonic boom &amp; energy of the reunited Who. I am in awe of this legendary band.After performing their songs so many times over the years, they still have the passion and dedication to work at fever pitch!  Their decision to perform  &quot;Who Are You&quot;, &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Baba O' Riley&quot; indicates their awareness to the fact that many fans consider these to be some of their best moments.<br />There are other fans/customers in this review posting who have already made all necessary historical references to the album, so I'll cut short by saying that this C.D. should be right next to your &quot;Sgt. Peppers&quot; C.D...It is a defining milestone in the evolution of rock. It sounds corny, but I am absolutely proud of this band!
B00005QATY|4.0|Fans of the Coen brothers are sure to enjoy this offbeat movie, which tells the tale of three escaped cons in the south during the depression who somehow get mixed up with Missippi politics, the Klan, popular music, con men, and many other strange comic adventures. George Clooney is good as the calm, conniving leader of the escapees, and his dirty sidekicks are hilarious. John Goodman has a notable appearance as a smooth-talking cyclops, and the man who plays the governor (whose name alas eludes me) is absoloutely superb in his role as corrupt politician. The film is visually beautiful, shot entirely through some kind of yellow filter that gives it a bleached appearance that feels very appropriate both to the American south of the period in which it is set, and to the ancient Greek world of Homer's Odyssey on which the story is based. The old-timey music that the convicts perform (at one point they become a singing trio called &quot;The Soggy Bottom Boys!&quot;) is appealing as well. You will enjoy watching this odd and unpredicatble effort, but I must say that it is not perfect. I have a problem with the way the Odyssey parallels are handled. Simply put, they don't make much sense in the modern setting unless you know that they are meant to be from the Odyssey. There is no subtlety in the parallels, so that basically what we are given is the Odyssey set in 1930s Missippi, for no apparent reason. I wish they could have done a better job of making events ring true in the modern setting - so that if you watched the movie and didn't know the Odyssey, it would all still make some kind of sense, however odd. But this is not the case, and I feel disappointed, in that they could have made it into a truly great movie this way instead of merely an interesting and good one. It works on some levels, but not on others.
B00003CX8J|5.0|People will always find every little detail to tear a film apart.  Being a long time X-Men fan, I loved the movie for the pure joy of seeing the characters come to life.  They were brilliant.  The special effects were awesome and the DVD comes with great extras worth the price by themselves.  My kids loved it and even my wife enjoyed the action and drama.  A worthwhile addition to any DVD collection, X-Men fan or not.
B000000OUE|5.0|If you don't own this album and you like thick metal then you're crazy, because this album is killer!  At first I bought it because I really liked &quot;More Human than Human&quot; and I would sometimes listen to a few of the other songs, but one night I was on a long drive home and tired of my cd's..saw AstroCreep and decided to listen to it all the way through real, real loud. And before I forget, I haven't seen many people mention the song &quot;BLUR THE TECHNICOLOR&quot; but da-da-damn!..that song is probably one of my all-time faves from any band.  This album ROCKS THICK.

The disparity between two of the fraternities is quickly evident when we see the wealthy white young men recruiting look-a-likes to join their fraternity and snubbing wannabe's who don't quite measure up.  The wealthy frat house has the approval of the school's Dean Wormer and he despises with a passion the characters who choose Delta House fraternity.  Dean Wormer wants Delta House off of his campus and he asks Omega House (the rich boys) to help him accomplish this task.  This is where the fun begins.<br />It doesn't take long for the viewer to realize that fun-loving, sloppy, middle-class guys inhabit Delta house and they live for pulling pranks on the Omega House fraternity and Dean Wormer.<br />This movie truly portrays college life on campuses during the 1970's.  The underdog Delta House is only looking for acceptance and they won't stop at anything to achieve it!  The pledge class consists of all the rejects from Omega House not only from this year but year's past.  Together this group works together to undo Dean Wormer's wish to rid their house from his campus.<br />Flounder's experience with the horse is hysterical.  The lunchroom scene with Bluto is classic.  Otter's &quot;happy-go-lucky&quot; love interests including Dean Wormer's life are characteristic of a young man's college sexual escapades of the 70's.  The closing of the Delta House and the road trip are comical.  And finally the parade of all parades allows Delta House to get their revenge.<br />Scenes from this movie stay with you forever!  Keep smiling as you relive quotes and replay scenes in your mind years after viewing this very funny film!
0792839129|3.0|Dick Van Dyke is good as usual in this kid's movie, which, by the way, has little in common with the book on which it is based. The first half of it is interesting and fun, with the restoration of the beautiful car, the eccentric household, and the invention of &quot;toot sweets&quot; (musical candies) at the factory. Once the story moves irrelevantly to a bizarre imaginary kingdom ruled by an evil baron, the whole thing goes downhill. There are a few good songs in this movie, among them the title song and &quot;From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success,&quot; and the ending is good once we get back to reality, but the film would have been better had it left out most of the third reel. Decent fare for kids.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Besides the movie and the usual Star Wars saga, this DVD has TONS of extras that will appeal to anyone.  The deleted scenes have been reworked in the studio and look like they could, and should, belong in the movie!!  The 'making of' documentary was unbelievable!!  It really gives the Star Wars fan an inside look at how things fall together, or fall apart.  I gained a new appreciation of the movie after seeing the DVD.  It boggles the mind how Lucas worked from nothing to being able to build this incredibly realistic universe complete with intense sub-plots and stories.  I gotta say that I spent a good 3 hours just viewing a part of the special features and still have more to go.  AWESOME says it all.
0930289528|5.0|In the aftermath of a cataclysmic nuclear war, Britain's government topples, to be replaced by a fascistic group calling themselves &quot;Norsefire.&quot; With the assistance of a giant supercomputer named &quot;Fate,&quot; they exert precise control over the population, eliminating such &quot;luxuries&quot; as freedom and privacy. Like all fascists, they hope to create order through unity, and foster unity through the elimination of diversity. The &quot;subhuman&quot; elements of society are rounded up into camps where they become the subjects of vile experiments before they all perish.<br />All but one inch.<br />In that inch is born V, at once the mirror image and the antithesis of the fascist state which created him. He opposes their identical faces by having none of his own. His anonymity is as much a weapon as his knives and bombs. Against the state's thought control, he knows and spreads the literature, art, and music the state hopes to suppress. V is ruthless, and determined to topple the order that the state is equally ruthless in upholding.<br />The convenience of hating fascists masks for many readers the truth that V is no less cruel than the state. His moral triumph lies in knowing when he must pass on to his viking funeral, leaving a new face to help rebuild. V's recognition of his own personal evil (an evil separate from the idea he embodies) and acceptance of its unsuitability for the new world he has created is his most heroic characteristic, and is unique among comic-book heroes.<br />V for Vendetta is a masterwork, among the finest pieces of literature produced in the twentieth century. Certainly it ranks in the top few works of speculative fiction. Alan Moore's writing in this story is astonishing and honest, and achieves stunning synergy with the art. Unrelenting and unapologetic, this is a book no well-appointed shelf should be without.
B000002UA9|5.0|This is the album where the British Invasion began. The first thing one will notice on the cover of this debut album is how young, fresh, and innocent John, Paul, George, and Ringo look. They WERE kids and this album reflects the simplicity and innocence of the time before the big upheavals in the world happened.<br />I love this album, and I think you will, too. Almost every track on it is worth listening to, and most are cover versions. The several Lennon/McCartney tunes include the classic &quot;I Saw Her Standing There,&quot; the title tune, and &quot;Love Me Do.&quot; The songwriting team already had prodigious talent even before the entire world had heard of them (this album was originally released in 1963). Even the cover versions are great, including &quot;Chains,&quot; &quot;A Taste of Honey,&quot; and above all their cover of the Isley Brothers' &quot;Twist and Shout.&quot; This last tune is exuberant, and John gives one of his greatest performances ever on this tune. In fact, I am not so sure the Beatles EVER topped this performance, it's that great. <br />It might be absurd, even outrageous, to say the Beatles peaked in 1963 and went downhill after that. As a Beatles &quot;purist&quot; I would say they had a couple of great years after their initial success before egotism and drugs ruined their music. But it is safe to say the Beatles never again sounded so fresh or as lovable as on this record.
078322933X|4.0|While this movie had mixed opinions from critics, I thought it was thoroughly underrated. I didn't really see what this movie didn't have to please people around the globe. It had a story, and an intriguing one at that, it had a lot of genres to mix its story up in, it had well-developed characters - especially the character of the father - and it had excellent direction, acting and a great script that explores further into the world of terror. The film succeeds highly because of its characters and the original bunch they are. Reese Witherspoon plays the short-skirt wearing, blonde-haired and extremely family-bound and nice young girl that gets involved with a psychopath and doesn't know how to take it. Mark Wahlberg plays this psychopath excellently, his character is someone obsessed with Witherspoon's character and we will go to any great lengths to protect her and assure that his and her relationship is safe. And then he gets violent, very violent, and the outcome is horrifying. The father is not the most original character in the film, but the most developed. He is the caring, brave and extremely clever dad who wants the best for his daughter but doesn't want to hurt her. Anyway, enough about the characters. The rest of the movie rocks too - the script is surprisingly original for its premise, taking the boy-meets-girl, girl-dumps-boy, boy-gets-angry angle to new areas in psychological horror. The suspense scenes are incredibly tense and the movie has some gut-wrenchingly scary but incredibly good ideas. I really enjoyed the director's point of view and liked the way he built his film as each of the characters slowly drifts off. I appreciated this thriller a lot and think it is worth your time, but beware, you're in for a pretty darn scary and atmospheric ride!
0380002930|5.0|Now, take note - I am emphatically not a fan of fantasy. In fact, I recommend limiting yourself to just this book as far as the genre goes, as the rest of the genre is mostly sterile, unoriginal, and hackneyed (and rips off this book a lot, too). This book, on the other hand, rocks on every level, because it has something that most fantasy (and most books in general nowadays) lacks - some absolutely wonderful characterization and imagery. Who could forget Fiver and his unsettling yet poetic visions (for some reason I keep associating his trembling hallucinations with Richey James, lyricist of the Manic Street Preachers; rockin' band, by the way)? Or Holly's own rather genuinely disturbing account? Or Cowslip's warren? Or the rabbit stories? And so on, and so on.<br />This book is rife with unforgettable imagery like that, and it is one of those few books that can be treated as a non-ridiculous allegory. True, it's not quite high-school reading (middle school the highest, sez I), but it's an absolutely necessary book to read at that age level. If you read it then, it will stay with you for the rest of your life. And sure, Adams gave us a real groaner with the execrable sequel - but this is one of the most imaginative and thought-provoking children's books in existence. I may be compromising my reputation as a Deep Intellectual by reviewing a children's book, but this is the one book that's worth it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I'm writing specifically to respond to the numerous people who thought that this movie's structure was &quot;contrived&quot; to hide a weak plot. It's often been said that there are just a few distinct plots that arise repeatedly in all literature (I think it might have been something like ten). What differentiates a great story from a terrible story, then, is the attention to detail, the characterization, and the degree to which we are convinced of the story's reality. In short, it is not the story being told but rather the *way* in which it is being told that makes great literature... and great movies.<br />In this respect, _Memento_ is a masterpiece. Far from being a pretentious contrivance developed in order to cultivate an arthouse atmosphere, the story's disjointed structure serves to convey Leonard's own disorientation and paranoia, his sense of having an idea what he's about to do, but not knowing what he's just done. Indeed, this structure is about the only way in which that feeling *could* be effectively communicated. The scripting and execution throughout the movie are flawless, and the acting is superb. Joe Pantoliano should top everyone's list for best supporting actor, and Carrie-Anne Moss and Guy Pearce also turn in Oscar-worthy nods. The story itself, presented in forward order, may not be the greatest ever written. However, the way in which the story is presented, and the philosophical explorations it takes along the way, make this a superb movie.
0060925000|5.0|I read this book when is was first published.  It's the type of story that gets me absorbed so far into it that 1000+ pages will still ecome to an end too soon.  I think it would be more interesting to persons with an interest in India and its culture like myself.  I had hoped we'd get a sequel of thousands of pages too!

0446677450|5.0|This book is a very pleasant read that I just couldn't put down. An invaluable asset in expanding your horizons when it comes to personal finance and getting rich. NOT a get rich quick book but more of a &quot;How the Rich think&quot; book.
6304106017|5.0|I saw the Siskel &amp; Ebert TV review of this film before it came out, and even though their review was lukewarm I knew I wanted to see it.  I saw it, I loved it, I bought a copy of it!  Its strange schizophrenic split in the story development is one of the exciting characteristics about it.
0803726570|5.0|This is a great book.  My 1 1/2 year old loves it and my husband and I love to read it to her.  It is delightful in both the verse and the illistrations.  My daughter carries it about the house, sometimes she wants it to be read to her and other times she'd rather look at the pictures and read it herself.  I have sent it as a gift and recomended it highly.  Sometimes when my daughter is napping I pick it up and read it to myself.

B000002KDM|5.0|I am a nineteen-year-old with unusual (for my age) tastes in music. Luckily, my tastes are far superior to that of others my age because mine allow me to indulge myself in the wondrous music of James Taylor. Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon is my favorite album of JT's (Greatest Hits Vol. I excluded). With this beautiful album JT might have reached the pinnacle of his still, strong career. The music here is what the music of the singer-songwriters was (and is) all about. This music is what all of today's music should aspire to be. The music truly has meaning. The words to songs like &quot;You've Got a Friend,&quot; &quot;Isn't It Nice to Be Home Again,&quot; &quot;You Can Close Your Eyes,&quot; and &quot;Long Ago and Far Away&quot; are sincere, and they really do strike home for any human. The musicianship is also fabulous. The strongest use of an instrument is certainly JT with his voice. His delivery is always understated, he allows to words themselves to do the speaking, but it remains vibrant, molodious, and beautiful. The depth of this music in all areas is immeasurably superior to any of that being made by more recent artists. <br />About two months ago, I was fortunate to see JT in concert in San Antonio, and it was so magnificant. I will hopefully one day be able to see him live again. At that concert, he displayed just how well his music has stood the test of time. Hopefully, my generation will wake up to the glories of JT's music, and hopefully, people will experience his early work like Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon.
0345448898|2.0|This could have been one of the great fantasy novels.  Despite a great start with The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, the third book is a failure.  The plot winds everywhere.  The fantasy world Pullman creates makes less and less sense, as characters in what appeared to be a Victorian age in the first books are suddenly dealing with references to &quot;atomic bombs.&quot;  Armies try to war against high tech weapons with gas filled zepplins.  The &quot;solution&quot; to freeing the ghosts from the world of the dead is totally unsatisfying.  The story just doesn't work, despite Pullman's tremendous imagination, beautiful writing style and flair for characterization.<br />For those who feel as I do, I recommend novels such as James Stoddard's &quot;The High House,&quot; which hasn't received as much publicity, but is a far better read.
B000001GPX|5.0|This recording is high energy!  It is powerful both in its opening, one of the most famous of all symphonies and performed here under Master Kleiber's direction jolts one wide awake.  One can easily glean from this what is rumored Beethoven said himself about it:  &quot;There Fate knocks at the door!&quot;<br />Acutely aware of control by rhythm, the sonata-allegro form provides for the emerging violent forces of one of the greatest symphonies.<br />The bridge to the finale begun by the eerie sound of the violins with faint timpani in the background swells to full force of the music which washes over the listener taking one into the fourth movement, certainly one of classic music's greatest moments.
B00005LMBK|4.0|Suprise, this is one those rare gems that produce more than just one decent single and the rest of the cd is nothing.  Its fractured styles will keeps your fingers off the skip button.
0761536434|5.0|Not to sound sappy, but the best part of this book (for me) is the resurrection of all the forgotten memories I've stored away as Steve takes me back through a tour of my early childhood.  Each game or system he discusses takes me back (in sight, smell, location) to very specific and memorable (but forgotten) scenes and events.  I grew up with Odyssey, Atari, Intellivision, Activision, Coleco-and virtually all of the Cabinet games discussed (my Mom used to drop me off at the arcade as my babysitter).  Reading this book has been pure joy for me.<br />But aside from the memories--the stories are fantastic (told almost entirely by the characters themselves): 1) LaGuardia (NYC Mayor) smashing pinball machines w/ sledge hammers, 2) Japan coinage shortfall due to Pac Man, 3) University of Utah having 1 of only 4 minis in US, 4) Atari setting up fake company to secure total market share, 5) Pac-Man creator getting $5K bonus????!!! (Bummer), 6) Fumes/syringes/Jacuzzis at Atari, 7) The military conversion of BattleZone, 8) the numerous interations of Pac Man, 9) the Genius of the Coleco strategy, 10) Steve Jobs at Atari!!, 11) the Birth of Chuck E Cheeze, and 11) I could go on and on.<BR> <BR>Steve--thanks so much for this incredible contribution to history.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|After all these years, Snow White still shines like a gem! Of course a lot of that has to do with the amazing restoration work, but if the detail wasn't there to begin with, we wouldn't be seeing it now. Simply put, this film set the standard for all animated films to follow. Even to this day films are compared to it and judged against it. But it's not only a landmark film, it's an incredibly entertaining one! Sure it's dated in some of it's characterizations, but amazingly it still works.<br /><br />Thankfully this Blu-ray (BD) and DVD package lovingly and in exacting detail preserves this national treasure. Disney has set and raised the bar for prestige presentation with this set.<br /><br />Snow White has been delicately restored and the high resolution of BD shows off the hard work in exacting detail. Colors pop, lines are razor sharp (check out the lettering on the storybook that opens the movie) and the dimensionality that's always been present now is unmistakable. The soundtrack has also been restored and remixed. Simply put there has never been a better way to enjoy the film.<br /><br />If however, you don't have a BD player yet, you can still get use from this set as it comes with a single DVD of the movie as well. How is that for making your dreams come true? Of course this new DVD doesn't reach the astounding quality of the BD but it does looks better than the Platinum release of 2001.<br /><br />The set is jam packed with bonus features, most of which appear on the second BD disc. The same commentary from the Platinum DVD, many games, a feature on the lasting influence of Snow White and newly discovered storyboards for a follow-up short that was never produced. But by far the highlight of the bonus features is the Hyperion Studios segment which through animated still photography, audio clips and current animators as hosts brings Walt's original studio to life like never before. You've got to see it to believe it. I've read quite a lot about the Hyperion Studios but this is first time it's ever felt really alive. What helps to achieve that is that you actually travel from room to room of the Hyperion Studios learning about the development of the film and gaining insight on the people who made this masterpiece. All of it done with vintage films, audio clips, production artwork and interviews. It's a remarkable piece of work that took me over an hour to get through.<br /><br />Disney has been doing some especially impressive releases of it's classics on BD, but this release of Snow White takes everything just a step further. There's something here for everyone, children, animation buffs, movie historians, disneyphiles, and those just looking to be entertained. There are a few bonus features not carried over from the 2001 Platinum DVD release (which itself was missing features from the laserdisc release), but only an evil stepmother would let that stop them from enjoying this amazing set.t's ever felt really alive.

B00005A46T|4.0|I bought this cd immediately after it came out being a fan of their first album.  I have to admit when I first heard it, it sort of blew me away with it's heaviness.  It even gave me a headache.  So don't listen to this if you already have one or arn't feeling well.  But once you get used to it, it's a quality cd.  It lacks a little of the originality of the first one but they improved their sound though.  The drumming is top notch.  I think Corey has a great voice and he should have used it a little more in a less screaming fashion because he sounds good when he doesn't scream also.  But if you like heavy music I definitley reccomend this and it's great to listen to when you are in a bad mood.  I LOve &quot;Skin Ticket&quot;, it's so creepy with all<BR>those tribal drum beats.  I could listen to it a hundred times.
B00005KARK|5.0|The simple, straightforward story of Dumbo (or more accurately, Jumbo Jr.) still has the power to move audiences even after 60 years.  All of us have felt like Jumbo Jr. at some point (if not all through) our lives.  We are also hard wired to protect and care for our young so when Mrs. Jumbo fights for her son, we automatically empathise for her as well.  This film works on all levels from art direction, color, mood, animation, character design score and song to the bizzare set piece &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade&quot; that dazzilingly displays the artists talents (in my opinion, one of the greatest segments ever animated).  Truly a Disney treasure and one that everyone from 3 to 103 can enjoy over and over again.<br />Thankfully this DVD presentation gives you many reasons to do just that.  The film has been lovingly restored and looks more bright and colorful than ever!  There are 2 very entertaining Silly Symphonies included (Elmer the Elephant / the Flying Mouse) that show Walt's early attempts at animating elephants and the themes that would eventually make their way into Dumbo.  The video of Michael Crawford singing 'Baby Mine' is painful however and should be skipped (both Barbara Cook and Bonnie Rait have done much better work with this song).  The 'Celebrating Dumbo' Featurette is very quick and light hearted with no real information on the making of the film, just peoples ideas and feelings about it.  If you want a more detailed and comprehensive look at it's creation check out the commentary which gives you plenty of new information and insight.  Also the conceptual drawings are fun to scroll through.<br />This is what I expect from a special edition DVD.  The film has been beautifully restored and there are many worthwhile extras all packed onto one disc.  And I haven't even mentioned the Casey Jr. train!  Each DVD comes with a cardboard pop out that can be folded in to the train for display.  It's touches like these that put this DVD over the top.  The film itself more than justifies the purchase, but the (mosttly terrific) bonus material certainly sweetens the deal.  You can't go wrong with one of Disney's best, Dumbo.film itself more than justifies the purchase, but the (mosttly terrific) bonus material certainly sweetens the deal.  You can't go wrong with one of Disney's best, Dumbo.
B00002SSRZ|5.0|This CD in DTS 5.1 is amazing. I have the original and decided to pick up the DTS version last week. It was like rediscovering the CD all over again. I'm not sure what the other DTS listeners who criticized this version were listening to; maybe they have cheap Audio systems. Buy this CD with confidence you will not be disappointed.
6304493681|5.0|This is without a doubt the standard for which all Anime will be compared for some time.<br />The motion of the characters is what truly sets it apart.  They don't move like a robot or float about.  The accuracy of their movement is only equaled by fully rendered computer animation.<br />This movie belongs in the Anime Hall of Fame!
B00005JKOV|5.0|Richard Linklater calls this a &quot;movie about ideas,&quot; and it is indeed unlike most movies. It has only the slightest semblance of a plot. The unnamed narrator, played by Wiley Wiggins, seems to be trapped in a neverending dream in which he encounters a whole series of characters who expound on ideas about existence, dreaming, identity, time, religion, society. It reminded me of conversations with peers in college, sitting in the hallway of a dormitory, in the middle of the night, our minds bursting with ideas, grappling with problems and not finding any solutions but enamored with the quest. Like that, except amplified. The ideas in Waking Life are not like, whoa, you know, the ramblings of a pot-smoking college flunkie, but actual thoughts from intriguing street philosophers like Speed Levitch, fictional characters like Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy's characters from Linklater's Before Sunrise, artists like Steven Soderbergh, or academics like philosophy professor Robert Solomon.<br />It's a movie that would not have worked nearly as well as live action. The realism would detract from the intellectual dreaminess of the ideas. Linklater's animation technique, which uses computers to paint on top of live digital video footage, is just right for this film. It is as close as I've ever seen to having visuals actually embody the ideas being expressed verbally by the characters. A new, exciting alternative to the documentary as a visual medium for ideas, and just as credible an approach as that of, say, David Lynch, for reproducing the sensation of dream. The animation awakens the reality just as the ideas in the film rouse your mind.<br />Finally, it's a movie that will inspire a polarized reaction. The person I saw the film with stood up halfway into the film and left, unable to stand it. The greatest films seem to inspire such reaction. I left the theater and stood on the sidewalk outside, thinking.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Why?  Is this album full of profanity?  No.  Is it filled with hateful and violent lyrics?  No.  Does it contain lewd sexual references?  No again.  Is it satanic or paganistic?  Nope.  If you play TEXAS FLOOD in the presence of children, will they try to get you to buy a guitar for them?  Don't blame me.  You've been warned.<br />Yep, this album truly is a feast for the ears.  All this album contains is a guitar player/singer, a bassist, and a drummer.  Which is certainly more than enough when you consider that its SRV and the incredible Double Trouble.  The songs range from honky-tonk blues (&quot;Pride and Joy&quot;) to Chuck Berry style rock and roll (&quot;Love Struck Baby&quot;) to a soft instrumental (&quot;Lenny&quot;).<br />When SRV put this album out, he ceased merely being a great guitar player or even a guitar hero.  He became a guitar deity much like Hendrix or Clapton.  It doesn't just take years, it takes decades to acquire the level of proficiency that SRV displayed on this album.  Every note that came out, either from his guitar or his voice, was put there for a reason.  Nothing was wasted.  It is especially impressive hearing the solo on the title track.  SRV bends the strings in such a bizarre manner that it sounds like the tape was recording at the wrong speed.  It somehow makes you of it being as both beautiful and technically impossible.<br />But sadly, SRV is no longer with us.  However, he left us a bunch of great material behind for others to seek inspiration in.  Hopefully, these future musicians will show SRV the same respect that he showed his own heroes.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I was laughing so hard that I cried at the parody of &quot;The Matrix&quot; fight scene. Someone compared it to &quot;Princess Bride&quot;. I agree that both are great funny family movies, but that's as far as the comparison can go. Shrek has it's own original flavor. I didn't feel like I was seeing a remake of anything else. Which is quite a fete considering the number of animated and other stories out there. I was happy with the mix of actors used for this movie. Myers, Murphy, Diaz, and Lithgow did great jobs. They worked well together and made a fantasy have believable characters. I was impressed with how well Michael Myers pulled off the Scottish accent. As we know some actors/actresses (i.e. Kevin Costner in Robin Hood) can't do foreign accents. The movie pokes jabs at a number of Disney and other movies and there is so many off hand remarks that it will take several viewings to catch them all. I certainly intend to buy the DVD and I highly recommend you get it.
B000002KD5|3.0|Before they were ready for take-off the third formation of Fleetwood Mac (with newly added songwriters, guitarist Lindsey Buckingham and singer Stevie Nicks), still had much to improve upon. On this 1975 album, the veteran rhythm section of Mick Fleetwood and John McVie seem primed and ready to back any arrangement with their steady-as-a-heart-beat skills, but much of the songwriting was not yet ready for distinction.  Buckingham still needed to advance all his sensitive pop songs to the level of the thrilling closer, \\"I`m So Afraid,\\" because weepers like \\"Crystal,\\" \\"Monday Morning\\" and \\"World Turning\\" are utterly take-or-leave. Christie McVie, still onboard from the band's second formation, offers even less. Soft rock like \\"Over My Head\\" and the revolting \\"Sugar Daddy\\" are quite unmemorable. Nicks, however, seems to soar above her cohorts. Her pagan motifs and chilling voice are at their peek during the classics, \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Landslide.\\" With material ranging from out-and-out filler to sheer classic, this self-entitled album may be of interest to fans who have already become acquainted with the Mac's more thorough albums such as Then Play On and Rumours.

B000002I25|4.0|The quasi-religious adulation of Jim Morrison by his acolytes (who claim everything from the singer faking his own death to a childhood Morrison being possessed by a Native American spirit) is one of the most ridiculous phenomenons and greatest forms of self-parody in the classic rock hierarchy. Yet, listening to this charismatic, confident and unique frontman proclaim, \\"Time to live/Time to lie/Time to laugh/Time to die\\" on \\"Take It While It Comes,\\" one immediately forgets all the overenthusiasm surrounding him and savors Jim Morrison's strong presence. Although he was certainly earthly, Morrison was an original: an insipid, psychedelic poet who mightily avowed every word he uttered and when his words were as weighty as those of \\"The End\\" or \\"Crystal Ship\\" he packed quite a punch. The playful guitar of Robbie Krieger, the steady beats of John Densmore and especially the jazzy, smoky organ of Ray Manzarek made up his perfect backing band. The Doors' 1967 self-entitled debut gives the band's career a fine start. Mainly because the Doors' many sides are immediately revealed. Acid rock freak-outs (\\"The End\\"), enigmatic poetry (\\"Crystal Ship\\"), blues belting (\\"Back Door Man\\"), chaotic timepieces (\\"Break On Through\\"), traditional styles of music made distinctively weird (\\"Alabama Song\\"), and, yes, radio-friendly pop (\\"Light My Fire,\\" \\"20th Century Fox\\" and a few too many others) make up a part of this diverse, yet coherent, LP. Although the bluesy, psychedelic sides of the Doors would be forged into an infectious mold and exceed anything ever produced by that part of the band`s personality on their last two albums, more than a few songs on thier debut represent the best of the band's dark styles. Surely it is an album capable of capturing listeners' senses and taking them through the Morrsion's darkly laced imagination. No, he was not a shaman or a prophet, but Jim Morrison had the confidence, strength and presence to make listeners believe something of the like on powerful, shadowy whirlwinds like those found on this excellent debut.
6301562941|1.0|I watched this too long movie just because it is a J.Cameron film. But it was a sheer frustration. I am very sorry to spend my 2.5 hours for it. It is just a waste of time. Don't watch it. It is full of ridiculous scenes. Slam a dead person and watch her bring back to life! Isn't it be to stupid? Too many sub-plots. Too many dialogs. Everyone in the movie talks in every occasion. Only when Bud dives into the abyss we can have some silence. Please don't watch this. It is nothing but a waste of time!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|In 2001, pop stars are trying to indulge in as many aspects of popular music as they can. Rappers are sampling rock classics. Rock bands are adapting hip-hop elements. New covers of old songs constantly turn up (including hard rock covers of 80s pop and cheesy pop renditions of classic rock staples). Legendary artists are recruiting cornucopias of contemporary artists to lend a hand on new albums. Some very odd groupings are performing together at big events like award shows and the Super Bowl. Chances are, whether you are a 50-year-old rock veteran or a 20-year-old upstart, someone is interested in crossing your path. In the midst of all of this glut, in walks the legend among legends, Bob Dylan, same old wiry mop and croaky voice, peddling an album with a distinct basis in the type of traditional American music not heard for more than forty years, completely untouched by his generation's spoiled great-grandchildren. Sure, his original songs have always had foundation in folk and blues, but he has never seemed as firmly dedicated to heartland styles and the America in which they existed as he is now. Dylan does more than just separate himself from today's tangled, cross-cultural mess. He distincts himself from other more dignifed rock veterans, whose music, although somewhat old fashioned, has never had the basis in traditional American blues and folk that Dylan's has and now has more than ever with Love and Theft.<br />With critics and fans expecting much of the Dylan, his easygoing mix of heartland blues and folk does not disappoint. The tracks, twelve clocking in at just less than an hour, feature hoedown guitar and violin jams that are just too good to stop until the last breath of life is squeezed from them (The six and a half minute closer, \\"Sugar Baby,\\" always seems to need one more series of acoustic guitar strums). Dylan certainly chooses a solid backing band for his summoning of the spirits of old America. Muddy Waters' presence seems to be stirring on \\"Summer Days.\\" Robert Johnson looms over \\"Floater (Too Much to Ask).\\" Lightnin' Hopkins' breezy acoustic guitar and simplefolk stories are called upon for \\"Po' Boy.\\" A Mark Twain-ish rural world is spoken of in \\"Moonlight\\" and the mind-blowing \\"Mississippi.\\" The rumpling, delightfully devious \\"Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum,\\" about a pair of bank robbers, reads like a silver screen western. \\"Well, they're goin' to the country, they're goin' to retire/They're takin' a streetcar named Desire/Lookin' at a window with a pecan pie/Lot of things they'd like they would never buy.\\" Dylan not only fails to disappoint. He even surprises. \\"I got a cravin' love for blazin' speed/I got a hopped up Mustang Ford/Jump into the wagon, love/Throw your panties overboard/I can write you poems/Make a strong man lose his mind/I'm no pig without a wig, I hope you treat me kind,\\" he boasts to listeners who acquire gaped jaws on \\"Highwater (For Charlie Patton).\\" It's at this point that one truly realizes the amazing amount of zest and confidence 60-year-old Dylan keeps up. He must. His new position is important. Dylan, who was raised on Woody Guthrie, Blind Lemon Jefferson and Muddy Waters, may be the last living legend with memories of that simpler time of American music where this album derives its base. In 2001, Bob Dylan's latest album is a time capsule for fading traditional styles of American music.
B00005R87Q|5.0|Best movie of 2001 hands down, buy it as soon as it comes out, but leave a copy for me.  This is the best edge of your seat speaker busting heart pounding sexy thriller of the year, buy it buy it buy it, and buy one for each of your friends too!
B00005NW02|5.0|Well System has done it again!  Before I heard these guys, I hated heavy metal.  I'm not even sure if you could classify SOAD as &quot;Heavy Metal.&quot;  I believe they have their own style of music that only they can name.  My buddy got me listening to them and I instantly fell in love with their music.  I don't believe their music could ever get old.  Undying music blessed with talent.  I have a lot of respect for SOAD.  A lot of their songs are about society and issues such as war.  I've learned quite a bit from this band.  Before I got into them, I had no idea that there was an Armenian genocide before the World War (Armenian Genocide of 1915).  Did you know that?  It wouldn't be a surprise that a few of their songs are about the genocide.  Considering that all four of them are of Armenian heritage.  Everything that I look for in a band SOAD has.  A great vocalist, talented song writing, an awesome guitarist, a very good bassist and drummer.  All of these components make up one of the best bands ever.  None of the songs sound the same.  Each of them hold their own sound and has their own inviduality.  One thing that I love about Toxicity is that the songs change pace quickly.  For example Deer Dance.  It starts off hardcore and towards the end it sends out a mellow vibe.  If you're the kind of person that likes music that's all thrash and that have vocalists that sing in deep blunt tones (no talents), then don't get this CD.  It will truly disappoint you.  But if you are an open minded invidual that is able to look at issues in someone else's perspective, give this CD a shot.  I loved every single song on it.  A lot of people won't buy this CD because Chop Suey! is too &quot;overplayed.&quot;  And if they got this CD they would be &quot;posers.&quot;  Oh no!!  HEAVEN forbid that.  I don't understand that concept.  People shouldn't like songs from semi-popular to popular bands?  That concept just doesn't make sense to me.  What's the benefit of liking a band that isn't popular?  The only thing I can come up with is cheaper concert tickets.  It just annoys me that people won't even try something because &quot;everyone&quot; listens to it.  Next time when my friends and I go to a pizza joint, I should warn them that they shouldn't eat pizza because of it's popularity amongst Americans.  Stupid example I have presented, I know.  Just as stupid as the reasons for disliking popular bands.  Ok sorry for rolling off topic.  I'm about done.  Alrighty have a lovely day......GO SOAD!!
0226264017|5.0|Or, maybe it's an \\"Excellent Look at Capitalism from a Freedom Point of View.\\" In either case, Milton Friedman's \\"Capitalism and Freedom\\" is a very interesting book. In the first two chapters, he summarizes the principles for everything else in the book. The remaining chapters are specific applications of these principles.  Even though the book was originally written in 1962, his analyses of these situations are real eye-openers. Everything's written for reasonably normal human beings: no math or anything special required.  I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5.
0783226160|3.0|National Lampoon's Animal House was released in color in 1978.  John Belushi is the lead actor playing Bluto, who is a frat house drunk.  This movie centers around the antics of the Delta house on a college campus.  Animal House is set in 1960's on the Faber college campus.  Bluto, Belushi, takes no prisoners when it comes to his antics.  This movie is full of crude humor and is not for the `weak' hearted.  The Delta House is on `double secret' probation (whatever that is) before they hold their toga party, which gets them kicked off campus.  <BR>This movie is full of lowbrow humor as the Delta House works against the `normal clean-cut' students at Faber.  They pull pranks on everyone, not even the Dean is safe from the Delta's, for example the dead horse in the Dean's office.  The Deltas drink, party and womanize throughout the movie.  Some of the scenes in this movie are so hard to believe, but are so funny.  The end of this movie puts a good cap on things and ties everything together.  Animal House is a movie for the college student at heart.
B0000029DD|5.0|This CD is really amazing. It's crazy to think that not many people have heard of him. Jeff Buckley's music is moving, bittersweet and completly true. At first, I thought it was weird. But as you listen to it more, it's hypnotic, it's hard not to listen to it. All the songs are incredible. Sometimes, it seems that he strains his voice and screams, but it still sounds good. And I would like to say to the person who wrote the last review that Matchbox twenty is not fluff, their songs may not be as intellectual, but that does not mean they aren't good. I encourage everyone to buy this CD it's wonderful. And to give Matchbox Twenty a chance.

0140120416|5.0|This book is great. First it shows you the alphabet, then you go into grammer, and so on. I'm only 14, so all this is coming at me like a rock and I'm still confused about a lot of it. But it's so organized that if you forget something, you can either look back for it, or go to the key. If you really want to learn Russian, this is the book to start with. I enjoy reading it every night. It's not as easy as I'd expected (Or hoped) But it's fun, so that makes up for it.
B00000IGGA|4.0|For a man who has always steered his own course, and indulged in a couple of pretty significant career changes, Tom Waits has amassed a remarkably consistent oeuvre. Whether he's jiving and scatting 'Diamonds on my windshield' or crooning a ballad like 'Whistle down the wind', there's always a distinctive outlook -- and, of course, a very distinctive voice -- that is pure Waits. He's also remarkably consistent in terms of quality: I can't think of a single Waits album that I couldn't listen to today, although some are obviously better than others. <br />'Mule Variations' is not quite as strong as 'Bone Machine' in my view, but it is probably his most varied set since 'Rain Dogs' (which must certainly be one of the very best albums of the eighties). Some of the tracks are a bit ho-hum -- 'The House Where Nobody Lives' and 'Cold Water', for example -- but others are as good as anything he's ever done. 'What's he building in there?' is Waits's funniest spoken-word performance since 'Step Right Up', and 'Chocolate Jesus' should become a secular anthem. Waits is not only a wonderful songwriter and vocalist; he also has one of the most distinctive production voices around. The instrumentation on 'Mule Variations' is endlessly inventive and varied, without ever being cluttered. In particular, I must pay tribute to Charlie Musselwhite's gorgeous harmonica solo on the beautiful lament 'Pony'. The harp simply explodes out of the mix, and it's as close to naked emotion as a piece of tin and treated wood can get. All up, Waits has made another pearler, which is only denied a fifth star because the man has set himself such high standards.
B00004XONN|5.0|Perhaps no album has more divided opinions, both critically and popularly, than Kid A.  A lot of people wanted them to make OK Computer Part Two.  That simply wasn't going to happen, and if it had, people would have been disappointed as well.  But here's my track-by-track analysis<BR>1)Everything in its Right Place- Profound lyrics if you ever stop to listen to them.  And the melody is great.<BR>2)Kid A- Not a huge fan of instrumentals, but this one's really good, and the drumming is superb.<br />3)National Anthem- The first real rocker of the album, and the climactic horns at the end were superb.<BR>4)How to Disappear Completely- Simple acoustic number reflecting the terror and disillusionment within Thom.<BR>5)Treefingers- First real disappointment, but still decent<BR>6)Optimistic- Straight ahead rocker among the greatest songs they've ever done.<BR>7)In Limbo- Good, but suffers from being sandwiched between Optimistic and...<BR>8)Idioteque- Most techno song they've done yet, and one of the best on this album.  Again, the terror is apparent.<BR>9 and 10) Morning Bell and Motion Picture Soundtrack- Decent, not spectacular until the end.<br />So in conclusion, it's better than 99% of the stuff out there, and it's not any worse than OK Computer, just different.  Buy this album, it's well worth the money you spend and the time you take to fully absorb this album.
B00005QIPH|4.0|(...including this critic!) I can describe this album succinctly with the following statement --- It sounds like everything else, and nothing else. The Strokes have come up with one of the coolest-sounding and most unique debut albums in recent memory. But you have to use the word &quot;unique&quot; carefully, because The Strokes don't have a very groundbreaking sound, but they have shrewdly mixed many different types of influences into a hip new gumbo. The drooling critics have accurately compared these boys to Velvet Underground and Television, and I also hear some new wave influence along the lines of The Knack or Adam and the Ants, but without the lameness and bombast. In fact, the band mixes so many influences so effectively, that you'll swear you've heard it all before, but you won't remember where. This is an impressive feat for the bunch of talented but unrefined slackers in their early 20's. Julian Casablancas (what a great name) is a refreshingly low-key and sly singer, and his lyrics have a little young angst but with a pretty perceptive view of reality. The guitarists and bassist are very relaxed, way less uptight than everybody else these days, and leave each other plenty of room to operate (they must be incredibly polite guys). Drummer Fab Moretti has a distinct new-wave sound that is pretty unusual today, but he sounds like he just stepped out of a time warp from 1981.<br />Of course the critics have been piling some monstrous hype onto this young band. Apparently being from New York makes you special, because young punks can barely afford the astronomical real estate prices and can't find rehearsal space. So does this make The Strokes special? No, even if they really had those problems. Articles about the band prove that they're all rich boys who barely have to sing for their supper. And the critics are misguided in proclaiming these guys are the next big thing and will save rock n' roll. That's the type of jibberish that makes critics stupid. So check out this band and judge them on their own merits. Leave the gushing to the critics and enjoy this band as the cool, enjoyable (though hardly mind-blowing) rockers that they are.ck out this band and judge them on their own merits.

B00005LB9O|3.0|Having become hooked on The Man Who's one great song after another, I was naturally excited for this album. I listened to &quot;Sing&quot; and saw the video. I was disappointed at first, but as I listened to it more it really grew on me, and I now really think it's one of the best songs they've ever done. The album did the opposite for me. At first I was very pleased and found it in many ways superior to The Man Who, but as time went on all the songs began to sound the same to me. &quot;Sing&quot; is still great, and &quot;Dear Diary&quot; and &quot;Pipe Dreams&quot; are really good too. But &quot;Side&quot;, which was once one of my favorites, is just &quot;Sing&quot; redone, but not as well. The rest is mostly decent filler. Good stuff to listen to a few times, but nothing you would want to return to.<BR>Buy The Man Who first, then Good Feeling (if you wanna hear how they were able to really rock), then if you decide you really like them, buy this album. It's worth a listen, even if it can't match &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hotdog Flavored Water&quot; (Heavy sarcasm right there)
B000056K04|5.0|I would like for everyone that reads this review to go out and pick this cd up. If you know already DMB is a different sounding band they mix r&b, pop, rock, jazz, and any other sound you could think of. It has any thing that you could want to hear Love songs, hate songs, and just good old DMB jamming sessions. What adds a new great sound to this cd, that is different from all their other albums is that Dave Matthews himslef picks up an electric guitar and let me say he plays it just as well as he plays any other guitar he picks up. This band is an absolutly remarkable example of true musical talent. And they bring it all together just for us.....THERE FANS!!! Go out and buy all there cds!!!! Dave Matthews Band Kicks...!!
0792156684|2.0|I managed to see this film after it wasn't on the big screen anymore. Even on a television, the special effects are finely detailed and convincing, specifically in reference to the end of the film where the ship breaks apart. Of course this covers perhaps 30 minutes of this 3 hour pop culture pleaser. Why , oh why does every hollywood film have to involve some trite b.s. love story that reflects the shallowness of modern relationships? I already know about stereotypically good-looking guys and stereotypically good-looking girls &quot;falling in love&quot; with each other for no apparent reason, I saw plenty of that in highschool. If real life is any indication, its a good thing Mr. DiCaprio kicked the bucket, otherwise the two main characters would have been married within a week of the crash, had 40 children, then decided that their marriage &quot;wasn't working for some reason&quot;, divorced, and traumatized their kids by fighting over rights to see them. Ho hum.<br />It probably wouldn't be so bad if the film focused more on the tragedy of the sinking than the lust afair. Sadly, 30 minutes is all you get. One should probably be happy they at least get that. If you want to find out about the the Titanic, go watch one of the fantastic documentaries available. If you want to watch another tacky pop love film, go watch any of the other hundreds that are available. I hate to think of all the trendy boys and girls leaving the theater thinking they actually learned anything about the Titanic.<br />A travesty of a film? Perhaps. But at least those special effects were good!
B00003CXSP|4.0|I think that if you enjoyed the first one you will enjoy this one. No I don't mean Red Dragon, I mean Silence of the Lambs. Anyway Hannibal is back and he is hungry, I thought the most effective suspence with the film is the whole cat and mouse game the Italian detective played with Hannibal, there were some very effective suspence building scenes. It was a little gory for my tastes but it was done in a humourous sort of way.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Tenacious D<br />I've been beating my head against the wall since I first listened to the album. I woke up with a nose bleed after the first night of falling asleeping with the album at full volume on repeat. I have also been able see through walls with tragic results. Great collection of Rock/Thrash/Jam'n Goodness. You want to laugh...you want to cry...you want a new master...you want to rock...you Need the D! It's good for you and your friends. J.
B0000027F3|5.0|I started listening to Rock/Metal in 1993, and listened to a lots of classic rock/metal bands. Invariably, I found that the lastest available records from any of the bands were generally the worse, the older ones tending to be the better ones. The one exception: Painkiller!! Itz amazin' how a band could produce a classic rock album (and IMHO, their best album) during the early nineties, popularly considered the beginning of the death of classic Rock/Metal.<BR>One of the Top Ten all-time best Metal albums; buy it!! Keep rockin'!
B00005QG9J|5.0|I have been an Incubus fan for a while now. I love their cds, FUNGUS AMONGUS for its originality, S.C.I.E.N.C.E for its diversity, MAKE YOURSELF, for its pure beauty. This one just blows my mind away. To be honest with you, I dont really like their first single of the disk, &quot;I WISH YOU WERE HERE&quot; its a good song, but its nothing compared to what the rest of the album has to offer. I can hear so many different influences from other artists and cultures. It is a very diverse CD. It is a lot softer than all their previous stuff, but hey Brandon needs a break from all that screamin'! Its just simply beautiful. You can hear maturity in their songs. Credits to the songs : <br />1) Nice To Know You<BR>2) Just A Phaze <BR>3) Aqueous Transmission<BR>4) Are You In?<BR>5) Warning<BR>6) 11 AM<BR>7) Blood On The Ground<br />Basically its a killer disk, and I think its a must have, EVERYONE WILL OWN IT OUT THERE IN THE WORLD! its just gorgeous, you can hear their typical sounds, and creativness. No way they are sell-outs<br />THREE THUMBS UP!!!
B0000048V8|5.0|This video is purely magical.  I remember watching this back when I was little and at the part during the dance and the Christmas lights, and I'd get out my little roller skates and act like the boy and the snowman in my living room.  I loved this video SO MUCH, and it would be entertaining for young children of all ages.  It sure kept me entertained ... every day ... like 3 times a day, lol.  Buy it.  You'll love it forever, I promise you that. =O)
0140386335|5.0|This is a book you have to read! The story is about a boy named Bastian Balthazar Bux who runs away and steals a book titled &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;. He reads about a land, another world, named Fantastica and it is in desperate need for a human to come from earth. A thing, a 'nothing' is spreading through Fantastica and the people of Fantastica beginning to suck into it. For once you go in, you become lies or evil beings in earth and tell humans that there is no such thing as Fantastica. There is also another problem in the land, the Childlike Empress is sick and if she dies, all of Fantastica will die. A boy is sent to find out how to cure her. The boy's name is Atreyu. The book goes on to Atreyu's journey to the Swamp of Sadness, the Desert, an horrible encounter with a huge and poisonous spider, meeting a fire-dragon named Falcor and becoming friends with it, going to Uyulaya, a scary brush with death in Spook City while trying to find the border of Fantastica, and finally, going back to the Childlike Empress. The cure is for a human child to come to Fantastica to giver the Empress a new name. Bastian goes into the book and makes lots of trouble for himself,Atreyu,and other characters in the book.<br />This author has lots of imagination. I like Atreyu's journey to find out what the cure for the Empress the best. It's was lots of fun to read the &quot;Neverending Story&quot;. All people would love this action,suspense, and most of all, the imagination of the characters and the places.
B00005OWIU|5.0|As soon as I heard &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot; I fell in love with this album. For several months now I have been waiting for it to come out, and here it is! One of John Williams' best work!
0823016285|5.0|This is an excellent book! It will NOT teach you HOW to draw (faces)- some basic drawing skills are necessary- but it will: Simply the process; Add some very usuful remarks; Point out the very little nuances needed to be noticed of while drawing; Give dozens of examples on each expression, and cover it completly. It's also written with a touch of humor- adds alot while browsing the book. If you want to draw expressions and faces in general better- but this book. It will make things easier for you; Things you can larn by years of experince are learnt by minuets of reading...
B00003CX5P|4.0|\\"Phantom Menace\\" was much maligned when it came out, largely because it wasn't \\"sophisticated\\" enough.  Well, the originals featured some incredibly ham fisted acting too, we were just younger then.  The fact of the matter is, \\"Star Wars Episode I\\" is a highly entertaining, visually spectacular movie.  I can guarantee that you will not find better CGI elsewhere, and the story line, while somewhat obtuse, has great pacing and is fairly engaging, even touching at points.  Moreover, the acting is probably better than in the originals.  Liam Neeson and Ewan Macgregor are accomplished actors in their own rights, and Nathalie Portman and Jake Lloyd proved themselves to be burgeoning talents.<br />As for the DVD, I was pretty much blown away.  The sound and picture quality are literally without parallel.  I have never appreciated the technology of my home theater system more than when I first popped in this DVD.  To put things in perspective, my dog was actually walking from speaker to speaker, trying to figure out who was talking!  The picture is brilliantly sharp, and the included THX tool assures that your levels are properly adjusted (assuming you feel like going to the trouble of using it).<br />The extras are pretty standard, but no less enjoyable for that fact.  George Lucas' commentary offers some interesting insight into the film, both in its creation and its final form.  The cut scenes from the pod race are spectacular.  Although far too long to include in the body of the movie, they are immensely enjoyable to watch.  It is important to note that it is not an option to view these scenes within the movie, as has been suggested by other reviewers.  Some of them are included in the movie, as well as some extended transition scenes, but the viewer has no control over which ones.<br />All in all I found \\"Phantom Menace\\" to be a highly enjoyable, if not particularly deep movie.  Moreover DVD is the perfect format for such an effects charged, popcorn movie, and the creators of this DVD did not miss.  It is loaded with extras and proved to be an enjoyable way to pass an evening.<br />Enjoy!
B00005QG9J|4.0|Incubus' third full length album is a solid one.  While not as good as their last effort this album still has its strong spots.  Some of the best cuts on the album are &quot;Nice to Know You&quot; &quot;I Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;11 am&quot;.  The only bad thing about this album is that it sounds like a veteran bands experimental album.  However, I would still recommend purchasing it.  But if you want top of the line Incubus, go pick up Make Yourself.
1859849296|5.0|I had always suspected that the little nun of Calcutta had plenty to be ashamed of. After all it must take a real cynic to preach against contraception, promote a monotheistic (well almost)faith in a 'do ut des' fashion in a country such as India. and why tollerate suffering when she had the financial and political backing to build a top - notch medical facility instead of a waiting room for death. I also encourage this book to those who are diffident of religion, particularly in this time of fundamentalist challenges - and not only from dreaded Islam.<br />A worthwile, eye-opening and cathartic read. Enjoy and think.
B00005A0N5|5.0|here we have a full range of music,from soft to hard.tarja's vocals are as powerful and melodic as bruce dickinson from iron maiden or ian astbury from the cult.if you like music by talented musicians and american top 40 makes you sick,be sure to get this.i like this album a little more than wishmaster but not by much.i got there 4 song ep+live tracks very impressed that they can pull this off live!the more you play this the more you will like it.cant wait till the next album.
0385334206|4.0|Breakfast of Champions is one of Vonnegut's more light-hearted pieces.  However, the book does have serious comments on society, life, and the interaction of people.  The story follows two characters:  Mr. Trout, a science fiction writer; and a car salesman by the name of Mr. Hoover. Kilgore Trout has been summoned by Elliot Rosewater (who is also the main character in Kurt Vonnegut's &quot;God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater&quot;) to be the guest of honor at an arts festival.  Quite suprised that anyone even knows he exists, Mr. trout sets off across the country to attend the event.  Along the way, Vonnegut treats the reader to a variety of Trout's short story ideas (most of which sound like either bad, or really obscure science fiction).  At the same time, the story follows Wayne Hoover's dysfunctional sturggle to make it through life as an automobile salesman.  The story focuses both men as they progress towards, and eventually converge on the arts festival.  Many characters that appear in this novel also appear in other Vonnegut novels, making it an excellent introduction to Kurt Vonnegut's work.  <br />    Among the many minor (or mini) themes that Vonnegut offers the reader throughout the book, a major one emerges.  He seems to say that people should be careful of what they say, or write, because we effect other is ways that we can't even imagine (both negativelly and possitivelly).  Often times we are, and remain, unaware of the consequences of our actions.<br />    There is also another aspect of the novel that is noteworthy:  The illustrations.  Mr. Vonnegut weaves rather simple drawing into the actual text of the story (often for a humorous effect).  These illustrations often take the place of verbal descriptions.   For the first hundred pages, or so, this style is interesting.  However, after that it grows old, and begins to seem like an easy way to avoid describing objects.  This, however, is my only complaint concerning the book.  I would recomend the novel to any Kurt Vonnegut fan.  I would also recomend this as an introduction to Mr. Vonnegut's work, or to a person who loves humorous stories.
B000002J0B|5.0|This album is a wonderfull testament to a time when rock music actually meant something. The songs are well crafted and the muscianship is excellent. Houses of the Holy continues the growth of Led zeppelin's evolving sound changes from one album to the next. The atmosphere on this album is amazing and that is something which you can find on all of the band's albums. As for Geoffrey's comments about the band being rip off artists all I can say is we all have influences. Robert Plant acknowledged them during Zeppelin's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Look at how many artists have taken a riff or a lyric from a Zeppelin song over the last thirty years. They FAR OUTWEIGH ANY PLAGARISM BY ZEPPELIN. I don't deny that they took liberties with some of the lyrics but allot of those classic blues songs were being covered LONG BEFORE ANYONE CLAIMED THEM! It's only when Zeppelin was successful with these songs that anybody ever bothered to complain. It's a testament to Zeppelin's talent that such songs are loved by millions of fans to this day.
0767802659|5.0|If you view this film knowing how Heinlein wrote it, then it's a very interesting movie.  The acting is cliched, and so much of it is overdone, but the reality is, in order to be true to Heinlein, it has to be.  It, and the book that inspired it, are satires on propaganda and war.  While the movie certainly doesn't follow the book step for step in plot, it captures its point.<br />If you're looking for a sci-fi war story, this will serve, but you'll likely come away thinking it silly or poorly done.  If you like satires however, this should satisfy.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|A perfect movie to get away to fantasyland for a couple of hours. The sets and special effects are incredible and there is no better person on earth that could have been cast in the role of Lara Croft.  I'm not really an Angelina Jolie fan, nor have I played any of the Tombraider games, but I left the movie thinking, 'wow she is cool!'  This not a movie for someone who thinks too logically while watching movies, after all how does Lara Croft survive hundreds of rounds of bullets flying around her without a scratch. However, if you can let go of reality and get immersed, it is very enjoyable. I have pre-ordered the DVD so I can watch it over and over again.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Saw this film originally on a University movie channel, I turned it on expecting just another sci-fi monster movie.  I was actually very surprised.  While it has the prerequisite dazzling special effects (believe me, I like these too), it had something I haven't seen in a good long while.  The characters actually act... human?  They don't &quot;kill all the big bad monsters&quot; like unlikely super heroes, they run away (honestly what I, and I would hazard the guess, most anyone would do).<br />Furthermore, I liked the character development which is RARE in any action/horror film now days.  Riddick's (Diesel) development has been noted to be a bit overdone at the last, and I'll admit the final scene might just be a tad sappy, but I'm not complaining.  Fry's (Mitchell) development should not be overlooked, however, and she really impressed me at the end by being the hero, without losing the &quot;real person&quot; image.<br />Scary for anyone who was afraid of the dark as a kid, and with enough twists to make the plot deep enough to be interesting even while the credits roll and you finish off the popcorn.  Enjoy!
B000006NPY|5.0|Adore was the first album I purchased by the Smashing Pumpkins. When I first listened to it, I thought, \\"kinda weird, but cool\\" As I kept listening to it, I grew to love it (like many other people, according to the reviews) It starts with To Sheila, which has beautiful guitar. Next, Ava Adore, with it's great techno sounds. Then comes Perfect, which is also a great song. Now, my favorite song- Daphne Descends. The lyrics are haunting, the melody is beautiful. The middle part is the best, with the strange lyrics, \\"And to the winding vines/The pretty boys dive/And thru the pinhole stars into the shadow mind\\" I still can't figure out quite what Billy means, but who cares? It's the music I love! Once Upon A Time has beautiful lyrics. Tear is also a terrific song, with its sorrowful lyrics and beautiful melody. Then is Crestfalled, which is terrific, with its sad lyrics and nice guitar. From there, the album gets a little tedious, except for \\"For Martha\\" but the songs are still definetly worth your time to listen to! My favorite songs: <BR>1. Daphne Descends<BR>2. Tear<BR>3. Once Upon A Time<BR>4. Crestfallen<BR>5. For Martha<br />If you're just trying out the Smashing Pumpkins, get this album! It has some of the most emotion I've ever seen in an album(besides Pearl Jam's Yield, which had a good balance of loud and soft) and the melodies are great. I can't understand all the people who hated it.
B00005K3GS|3.0|honestly it is just allright...<br />I was expecting an album that was going to toally wipe me off the face of the earth like lady did...and it's ok...but didn't wipe me off the face of the earth.<br />Of course...&quot;lady, hear me tonight&quot; is the top track...it rips it by a mile. Chillin' closely scores up behind there. Two toally fabulous, funkelicious, groovin' tunes that are toally awesome.<br />They've included this latin influence on here as well ( I have no idea where modjo actually come from) but their track 'peace of mind' sounds like it's right off a enrique englaises or ricky martin album..not my cup of tea.<br />'Acknowledgement'..I don't actually know why this is here...except for a nice filler. It's ok..but doesn't really seem to have a huge sense of purpose compared to the rest of the songs. Would be great as a mixer for 2 songs of a slighter slower, cruisin' beat. 'Saviour eyes' is also that lil bit slower..very 'las vegas balmy summer night' style. nice littel guitar riff with a smooth backdrop..not bad to sit back too.<br />'No More Tears' - bloody catchy!! a lil more upbeat, with a damn good melody. I don't mind this at all, nice defined sections of music and vocals...is not all that bad at all. 'What I mean' - can totally see this a burnin' house track. repetitive in the right spots...mixed to perfection. interesting layered vocals..great beats with a smooth rhythm. indeed pretty good.<br />Alot of people feel the same sbout 'on fire'..I don't think so. It just sounds so the same to everything released lately! there isn't really all that much new in it..but has a great progressive back beat. That Im impressed with. But overall and average song.The same as 'rollercoaster', I don't catch with that...it seems to miss those funky beats and groovin' tunes. IT doesn;t quite fit with the rest.<br />To finish the CD of really well though...a gorgeous acoustic version of 'lady'. Oh fine. A much better arranged vocal mix, with a beautiful rhythm...simplistic, soulful, with that underlying groove. This I much like!!<br />for the die hard house fan..I'd say go for it...If you're not though...but oyu love the released singles...borrow off someone else and have a listen before you decide to buy it for yourself.<BR>Otherwise, generally not bad...few tracks that don't quite fit, and arn't as original as others, which makes it sound repetitive. Otherwise, ok =) one I'd prolly buy if I had a spare AU$30 lying around.
0345451325|5.0|This book starts off with a bang and doesn't let up. It's got many elements of traditional Sci Fi such as Card's Enders Game and Aliens. While I was leary on a book based on a game at first, I was considerably excited about the game and thought this would be a great introduction. MS and Bungie should be complimented for this fantastic idea of releasing a Novel (Prologue) to the game before it's released. It gives you a good deal of background information and all the events leading up to the moment that the Master Chief, one of the remaining super-soldiers called Spartans, arrives on Halo. Which is obviously where we come in with the game. The choice of Eric Nylund as writer was also wise on MS's and Bungie's part. Nylund is an accomplished Sci Fi Author and defenitely has some legs to write with here. He hooks you in early on in the book and just keeps you with the story the entire time. If your anywhere at all interested in getting Halo for the XBox, you should REALLY look into getting this.
6303234844|5.0|I  saw this concert tour in 4 cities - Oakland, LA, Sacramento and San Diego, front row in each.   I have this show on Laserdisc, and am waiting for a DVD version hopefully.  Does an excellent job of capturing the experience of the show.  This show was designed by Quebec's theater director Robert Lepage, so it is more than the typical rock show.  If you don't know Peter Gabriel's music, this will give you a great exposure.<br />Highly recommended
0345413377|5.0|What an excellent book, what a creative mind. The trilogy has somewhat of a slow beginning in Golden Compass. After reading the Golden Compass a year ago, it felt too slow and dark for my taste and I didn't pick up the Subtle Knife until last week. It gets much much better with the Subtle Knife and the Amber Spyglass. I read both books in 2 weeks. I give the trilogy 5 stars because Pullman became a candidate to be a member of the Tolkien and C.S. Lewis club with these books. Original, creative, fast paced (the last 2 books), just keeps your heart pounding till the end. One needs to have an open-mind about religion, creation, and the origins of the universe in order to thoroughly enjoy this series. Once again, excellent job Pullman!

B00004T9UF|4.0|Eminem Returns and his sophomore effort is just as good as his debut, if better. The new albums contains so many great songs including &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;, &quot;The Way I Am&quot;, the emotional &quot;Stan&quot;, &quot;Marshall Mathers&quot;, &quot;Criminal&quot;, and much much more! Shady is on top of his game right now......Don't fall off slim, keep it coming and keep the hits going.
B00005BL2A|5.0|At first I thought that after hearing Dream On I thought this would be a step back from Ultra but I was wrong. Exciter is just as good as Ultra and maybe even better. DM shed their rock sound for more dreamlike electronic synthesizers and the music is a little brighter than any of the past material they,ve done in the past 14 years. Those who are dissapointed with this album probably were looking for a more Violator sound. Well while I do miss the edgy sound of that album I think it's great how DM make new turns in their sound.<br />Dream On is a trippy little song with some acoustic guitars. This song is probably the simplest they,ve done in a long time. I thought this song was boring at first but thanks to a cool video that perfectly matches the atmosphere this song has grown on me. Shine is the most breathtaking song on this album. It's a dark ambient song with a spooky airy atmosphere. It then becomes edgy towards with some electronic buzz sounds sound towards the end. It ends with the abient synths merging with the into to the next song. Shine is my favorite song on Exciter. The Sweetest Condition is a great song with more R.E.M. sounding guitars. This song is great. When The Body Speaks is a beautiful songs with great bass hooks and a hypnotic sound. It's kind of more safe sounding but great. The Dead Of Night is a hard edged rock song that would make a great Halloween song. Those hard edged rock guitars are so awesoe. Lovetheme is a beautiful two minute instrumental. Freelove is a great song with very well written lyrics. This song definately deserves to be a single in the near future. Comatose is a weird aquatic song with low pitched blips with very buzz trippy beats. I Fell Loved is a dance oriented floor stoping. This is one of my favorites. Breathe is a very laid back song with a more safe atmosphere. Easy Tiger is another short instrumental. I Am You is a good song with a dark ambient sound and some electronic blips. Goodnight Lovers is a beautiful song with a sort of sunlight atmosphere. This song is a beautiful closer to this masterpiece.<br />Overall I would definately rank this album up there with Violator, usic For The Masses, and Black Celebration, and Songs Of Faith And Devotion. Go out and buy this CD. It's really good and one of the years best CDs.with a sort of sunlight atmosphere. This song is a beautiful closer to this masterpiece. <br />Overall I would definately rank this album up there with Violator, usic For The Masses, and Black Celebration, and Songs Of Faith And Devotion. Go out and buy this CD. It's really good and one of the years best CDs.
B00005KARJ|2.0|Don't get me wrong... I am one of those life-long Disney movie lovers; the kind that collect every one of the movies for my children....BUT, Dumbo is just not at the top of the list when it comes to letting my 3-year-old watch it.  Both my husband and I recall being frightened by the &quot;Pink Elephants on Parade&quot; as young children---you must admit the worms and skeletal elephants are a little weird.  The rest of the movie is wonderful--the characters, songs, moral and story---but THAT part just doesn't seem to fit in with the rest, and unfortunately, causes us to shy away from adding Dumbo to our Disney collection.
B00005O5CM|5.0|What a positive movie! If you want something that you don't have to think about but has a positive message and just makes you feel good -- try Legally Blonde. A great date movie to impress the women in your life. Not much of a plot... but high entertainment value any how.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|This is a great Bob Dylan album. I winds its way through American music history with the a brilliance that only Bob Dylan could bring to bear. From a fifties sock hop, to the delta blues, to the hard drivin' blues to &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; blues Dylan lets it fly with his crack touring band. His voice sounds ragged but crisp and light. It dances through packed verses and wraps around the words, coloring them before they wack you right up side the head. The lyrics are his best in years. Dylan's sense of humor shows through. Pure genius. You should own this album, but careful, it may end up owning you.
B000002I8D|5.0|I believe this is currently #2 in Phil Collin's essential recordings, but it should be number one, and it certainly is an essential album for everyone's collection. I was probably one of the last people to buy this album, and I wish I had bought it sooner. It is really great, and if you don't have it, you are in for a wonderful experience.
B00005O5N1|2.0|I have read the book &quot;Bridget Jones Diary&quot; probably about ten times since the summer and loved it everytime. After watching the film I see they've killed the book. Despite having an excellent cast they have made the characters completely 2-dimensional. The script writers seem to have edited every bit of humour out of the book and have turned it into a cheesy romantic 'comedy' for the late twenties age group. My only advice for anyone who is interested in seeing this film is buy the book.
B000000OMB|5.0|Whenever I am asked what my favorite album is, I immedately think of this album. It is the album that really started me off on my rock and roll experience, and was the first album that I actually sought out at a store and bought with my own money. I really wasn't that interested in buying albums before this, as I happily listened to the radio for all my music needs. <br />Based on this album, I bought a number of other albums by Wetton, Downes, Palmer, and Howe. I've enjoyed them all, but having the four of them come together as a supergroup was just magical!
0446677450|5.0|Opened my eyes to some of the bad habits I had when it came to Finance.  BUY THIS BOOK!!!
0452282152|5.0|This story is very much like a Cinderella story set in the 1600's. The story line is simple but has a intersting flare to it.<br />Having never know much about Vermeer paintings or a lot about the time the book I was very satsifyed with the book and the story about Griet.<br />The only thing that bothered me with the book was the ending. It seem to short for me and didn't get into what had happen to Griet besides her marrying Pieter and having children.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Imagine, if you will, that you're a pancake distributor.  Although you haven't had too much trouble selling pancakes, many pancake afficionados are accusing you of making bad pancakes.  It's true - most of your pancakes are too over-produced/syrupy sweet or overly abrasive.  You're in need of a new idea, because your pancakes are quickly becoming stale and people are catching on.  Someone comes to an epiphany: just mix together flour, buttermilk, eggs, and a dash of salt, and voila!  Granted, it's just a regular pancake, but are you going to tell your advertising department that?  Nope.  You're going to tell them that these are the best pancakes that have been made in years - that they're the kind of pancakes that made you want to start eating pancakes in the first place.  Such is the case of the Strokes.  It's obvious by the title of the album that they know they're not all they're hyped up to be: they're just an average rock and roll band.  But by today's standards, an average rock and roll band can sell a whole mess of records to kids who don't remember the Knack, or 30-somethings with fond Ramones memories still running through their heads.  But then again, when the Ramones were around, did people listen to them whilst wistfully thinking about the Ramones' influences?  The SOUND is there (Television, Stooges, Lou Reed), but the SPIRIT OF INNOVATION is not.  If you listen to this album expecting greatness, you'll be let down.  If you listen to it as an innocuous, good, catchy little rock and roll record, you'll be pleasantly surprised.

B00005QG9J|5.0|The thing i love about incubus is that every one of their cd's is different. They all have a different sound. They don't just sound the same cd after cd like some bands. And unlike other bands who try to sound different, Incubus sounds good with every different. I would highly recommend this cd for anyone. Although it's quite a bit softer than MY or Science it is still a great album. Mexico is by far my favorite song. It is one of the most beautiful songs i have ever heard. Get out and get this. The best album of the year.
1878424319|4.0|The author is able to take time tested wisdom and word it in a fashion that is truly thought provoking.  The book was chock full of &quot;aha moments&quot; for me.  It is written simply and can be completed in one reading. There is so much wisdom there in that small book, I plan to read it again and again until I am able to integrate some of these ideas into my daily living.
B000001FDK|5.0|Excellent movie soundtrack, full of fun, sing along songs.  Everybody's familiar with &quot;You're The One That I Want&quot;, &quot;Greased Lightning&quot;, &quot;Summer Nights&quot;, and &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot;, but don't overlook other gems such as Sha-Na-Na's &quot;Those Magic Changes&quot; and &quot;Born To Hand Jive&quot;, as well as &quot;The Worst Thing I Can Do&quot; and &quot;Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee&quot; done by Stockard Channing.  This is a must for any film music lover's collection.
067101756X|5.0|This is the best UFO book I have read to date.  It puts the entire government conspiracy into perspective with the cold war and the U.S. fear of communist takeover.  If you ask yourself who invented the cotton gin, you probably know.  But, the greatest inventions of our time such as silicon based computer chips and fiber optics, as well as lasers are not attributed to inventors.  That is because, as Corso so generously enlightens us, we stole the technology from aliens...ROLL TIDE
B000002J5K|5.0|If you thought the movie was great, wait until you hear the soundtrack.  Excellent collection of blues, R&amp;B and soul tunes by various artists, including Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin.  There's even a country/TV tune (&quot;Theme From Rawhide&quot;), and a taste of gospel and jazz.  I only wish that &quot;Soothe Me&quot; by Sam and Dave (heard in the movie) was also on the soundtrack.

B000005B0U|2.0|Doesn't quite capture the fun and energy of the soundtrack of the first Blues Brothers film, but it's passable.  The best song is a remake of &quot;Funky Nassau&quot; which shows off the vocal talents of actor Joe Morton and Eryka Badu.
B000050FEN|5.0|&quot;Se7en&quot; seemed intriguing from the point of its poster: something about the seven deadly sins used in a murdering rampage.  However, the final outcome far exceeded audiences expectations as it thrilled, shocked and completely entertained us with its imagery and creativeness.<br />Directed by the amazing David Fincher, &quot;Se7en&quot; choregraphs its way through a rainy, murky city filled with a rate of crime comparable to any large city.  However, attracting the attention of Detective Mills (an amazing Brad Pitt) and just-about-to-retire Detective Somerset (always good Morgan Freeman) is a murderer who kills his victims based upon the seven deadly sins.<br />Incredible in its art directing, fast-paced in its action and disturbing in its ability to disgust you, &quot;Se7en&quot; reaches into the dark holes that we want to crawl down but don't have the nerve to.  Filled with surprising guest appearances and scenes that are all too remembered -- the protrayal of &quot;Sloth&quot; is utterly chilling -- it gives that attention that &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; sends.
B00005QFHG|4.0|It begins on a cold winter day when strong winds blow a beautiful wanderer (Juliette Binoche) and her illegitamate child into a fridgid town. She opens up a seductive chocolate shop that shocks and infuriates the town mayor and most of the local residents. Obsessed with moderation, the mayor is determined on driving her and her Chocolate shop out of the town (which initially backfires). However, before his plans can take full effect, the stranger warms up the townspeople's cold spirits with smiles and the seemingly magic chocolate. She happily chips away the ice that surrounds the town until a handsome gypsy comes her way. This makes her think twice about her constant need to travel and resistance to belonging. It ends deliciously, and gives you a fabulous feeling.<br />Chocolat is a dreamy and sweet movie that I thoroughly enjoyed watching. It was beautifully filmed, and the acting was fantastic. Juliette Binoche was charming and beautiful, and even though he had a fairly small role, Johnny Depp was gorgeous and sported awesome Irish accent. This movie is pretty funny at times too! I loved the priest (a young admirer of Elvis) and thought he was so cute - the mayor controlled him so far as to rewrite his sermons.<br />The only thing I didn't really like in Chocolat was that it promoted sensuality. Sure, you should certainly enjoy life, and a little pleasure in chocolate won't hurt anyone, but moderation is not bad. According to the mayor, someone who fasts and pracitces intense moderation is better than a friendly, kind &quot;sinner&quot;. I don't agree with that. You should be more unselfish than self-indulgent. I won't give the movie too much rap, though, for the main character is giving. <br />ANYWAY, I loved the music and thought the movie was simply delightful. Definitely worth seeing.
B00005OAJ1|3.0|Tenacious D isn't meant to be of musical significance.  They aren't trying to snatch Grammy's or any other award worthy of merit.  They're just trying to entertain.  And their self-titled album DOES do that... Just not in as great of a way as thought.<br />Surprisingly, the vocals of the several songs are quite impressive, showing a rock voice that is often unheard in modern music.  &quot;Keilbasa&quot;, a romp about sex, and &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, an intriguing little song about superheroes, are prime examples of the vocal talent the group can express.  Musically, their shocking well-performed guitar layouts and sets are quite good.<br />However, the overall feeling of the album is one that is... Well, it feels like a shock album.  Just saying random f**cks to get a laugh without really thinking of the comedy that could go along with it.  The music is strong at some points, but seems often thrown together SO lazily that it seems cheap.  Who wants to buy cheap records?<br />Tenacious D does have the potential of making someone laugh (&quot;F**k Her Gently&quot; can still stiffle a giggle from me...), but they're not using their potential to what they could bring it up to.  &quot;Tenacious D&quot; is an album that is amusing and does have comedy, but falls short of the comedy that should be expected from a group that has recieved the amount of hype they have.
B00005QW4K|4.0|Basicly, this is just the Limited Edition Director's Cut DVD, in a 'homemade' style package. <br />It looks like it has a paper bag wrapped around the cover, and all the front art &amp; back infos are written in felt-pen. There is a short message from Bruce Campbell scribbled on the back of the 'bag' as well. The dvd disc itself has been made to look like a 4x DVD-R, labled with a felt pen also. Pretty funny stuff! <br />The contents of the disc are exactly the same as the limited edition version, even the menus are exactly the same.<br />A great disc, and much cheaper than that hard-to-find limited edition version... if you missed the LE version, or just want a copy with hilarious packaging, then grab this now!
0679731377|5.0|I respectfully and totally disagree with the misinformed reader who gave this book only 2 stars.  I'd list it as one of the great books of the twentieth century for many reasons.  It appears at first glance to be made up of disconnected stories, histories, journal entries, and fables.  But what is so masterful in the writing style is the way that, with a little work from the reader, these disparate elements reorganize themselves into an organic whole.  I find many qualities of Barnes' work &quot;musical', perhaps none more so than his singular use of leitmotifs.  Words, phrases and themes echo from one chapter to the next, linking ideas, characters and symbols to the very end of the book.  What leitmotifs?  Some examples: Noah, the Ark and the Flood; historiography; shipwrecks; pilgrimage; G-d as destroyer; the eventual and inevitable corruption/destruction of all art and history.<br />Barnes IS in love with his own prose and loves to play with the reader to prove his own erudition, but never entirely without a point.  I have several favorites among the chapters, particularly the first and last.  In both, the identity of the narrator is crucial to the overall structure of the book.  Both address &quot;the oldest story in the world.&quot;  Both are mildly to wildly comic in degree and both address head-on why we go on, why we remain dedicated to the struggles of this life (and, perhaps, the next.)  From proto-Biblical narrative, to art criticism, to pseudo-history, to parable we're led on to the secret of it all.  I thought it was just a jim-dandy read.
B00003CXAA|5.0|Simply put, this is a spectacular piece of work. The movies are beautiful - you are reminded of the simple strength of the score, and the beauty of the cinematography. Lovingly transferred, this is a pinnacle for other DVD's to aspire to. Even the Godfather III is watchable again, since you can jump over Sofia Coppola's &quot;performance.&quot; If you love the movies, you owe it to yourself to get this. Period.
0393307050|5.0|what a great sea-story, perhaps a little hard to get into due to the old english style of writting, but well worth the effort to understand.  this book take one from there world, and places them seemingly right on the deck of sophie as she sails the medeterainian in shearch of prize ships.  o'brians style of writing makes one long to be back in those days with his very detailed descriptions of all that goes on in the RN of the day.<BR>very good reading if you like sea-stories
0684857820|5.0|Sebold turns the tragic into the beautiful -- all the while maintaining her honesty, sense of self, and wicked sense of humor. Plath reincarnate with a sarcastic edge, if you felt an empty spot after finishing _The Bell Jar_, this novel is for you.
B00005OWIU|4.0|I've spent the afternoon becoming acquainted with John Williams' score for the upcoming \\"Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's/Philosopher's Stone.\\"  What can I say other than it's Williams and it's Williams in top form. At 69 years, Mr. Williams has produced one very exciting film score with \\"Harry Potter\\" and though one might hear bits of \\"Hook\\" here, \\"Raiders Of The Lost Ark\\" and other scores there, there is much fresh and inspired music for the listener to relish and appreciate.  Listening to this disk (three times today alone) has affirmed for me that there is NO film composer anywhere in the world better capable of capturing in music senses of wonder and fantastical adventure than John T. Williams.  Mr Williams, I hope you're around for a long time as I can't imagine life without your inimitable and considerable contributions to the world of cinema.  4+ stars.
068981528X|5.0|I teach children's storytelling; this is my students' favorite story. Because it is just a little more extreme than the original 3 Little Pigs story, and because it reverse the roles, my students think its much cooler. The illustrations are really incerdible too.
B00005RDAF|5.0|(...) This video's contents so far:<br />Videos for Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know, I'm A Slave 4 U, and I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman. All of them are sexy, but I'm A Slave 4 U has got to be the most sexy. Awesome choreography and a whole new Britney. DLMBTLTK was the finishing video for Oops!...I Did It Again. It's also sexy, and the only downside is the no dancing...INAGNYAW is a more relaxed approach to a video, and it's a really good power ballad. She's out in the open areas with no dancing or other people. She's in various rooms and areas as well.<br />Live performances-Really I have no clue which ones, but all videos include them. I can guess Overprotected, Lonely, maybe Cinderella or I Love Rock N Roll. They do some under-rated songs on each (like I Will Be There on the TIME OUT! Video)<br />Interviews and A Day With Britney-One of those things where you travel around with Britney. Do you know what I mean? Just her being goofy, maybe recording something...<br />Clips of TV Specials-Hopefully VMAs or Total Britney Live, but the Fox Family thing will do!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The tears started in the first minute and flowed to the end. That may not seem like an endorsement to some, I admit I am easily brought to tears, but the strength of this movie is that its sentiment is so real and the tears are deserved.
B00003CXFV|1.0|I intially had high hopes for this movie even though i hate Julie Roberts. The movie starts off nicely for the first 25 minutes as it establishes its trash talking heroine. Then it goes way down hill into boredom. The direction is great of course but that cant always save a bad movie with a bad actress. The fact that she won an Oscar has almost destroyed my faith in the academy. Any other of the nominees did better then she did. I cant believe Sodeberg actually wanted to do this movie. I think he did it just to have a hit so he can do more independent projects. BUt i forgive him for this as he earlier did &quot;The Limey&quot; and redeemed himself by doing Traffic in the fall of that year. Julia should stick to Romantic Comedies.
B000003S0D|5.0|This album does not stands alone, it has company and it is called: IN THE WAKE OF POSEIDON.  Both are brilliant rare gems.  In their days, the term Symphonic Rock was bestowed upon music of this kind.  Other bands like Emerson, Lake and Palmer share some of this limelight.<BR>Lizard is the story of the tribulations of King Rupert, it is an absorving tale masterfully weaved and orchestrated by Robert Fripp and Peter Sinfield. Thus, as a tale it evolves and performs; the work has flair, fantasy, chaos (&quot;Cirkus&quot;, &quot;Peacock's Tale&quot;, &quot;Lizard&quot;) and obviously cast forth warning of the spectre of war: fear and misery as should be expected from this two gentlemen (check out &quot;the battle of glass and tears&quot; and &quot;the last squirmish&quot;), as the music goes on you can smell the cinders and see the soldiers cleaved with torn flesh. The &quot;Big Top&quot; ends the story.  Summarizing, this music is not for airheads or neither for unsensible people nor the ones looking for a quick fix of rush.  Give it time, think of Allan Poe a little and enjoy...
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather Series is one of the most influential sets of movies that exists. Numerous movies, TV shows, books and other media openly credit the Godfather as being their inspiration. One of the currently most popular TV series, The Sopranos, often directly quotes the Godfather. This DVD set is the best way to see the entire series, plus NUMEROUS special features, in a way that is as high-quality as possible, without all of the inherent flaws of tape.<br />I *love* this series. So many reviews here have acclaimed these movies that their merits don't really need to be listed again in detail. Incredible acting. Fantastic music. Brilliant directing. Sure, there are a few flaws. We're all human. But this is a movie series that is taught in many colleges, and there's a reason for it. It's GOOD. Be sure to get a copy for yourself, so you can enjoy it for yourself. Cook up a pan of lasagne and invite some friends over! A bottle of red wine, these DVDs, and you're set for the evening!

B00005LQ04|5.0|This classic film from Argento stars Jessica Harper as a dance student who begins to discover that the school she is attending has a darker side. Featuring an excellect soundtrack by frequent Argento collaborators Goblin, a great performance by Harper, and some of Argento's best death scenes. This film is well worth your time.<br />I have not had the privaledge of viewing the DVD yet, but I have a feeling Anchor Bay will deliver as usual. Although, some earlier reviewers complained about the sound quality, hopefully this is just a defect in small amounts of discs. I have read a larger amount of positive reviews about the sound, rather than negative.<br />If you have never seen Suspiria, you should seriously consider picking up a copy, and if you don't care about the documentary or the CD soundtrack, then you would probably be just as happy with the cheaper copy.

6305807930|4.0|This so-called sequel to Suspiria, which focuses on another one of the &quot;three mothers&quot; is a surprising disappointment.  The story is severely flawed, and some of Argento's murder sequences are a bit lame.  This film probably deserves 3 stars, but after viewing the film I realized that it wasn't really that bad.  After all, it features a great score by Keith Emerson, has some very eye-catching parts (mainly the under water room and the alchemist in the library). It also features the wonderful Daria Nicolodi (also in Deep Red and Tenebre).<br />I suggest first time viewers try renting this film first, as you may find yourself highly disappointed.  Although, for Argento fans it's a must, and over time you will probably find yourself appreciating the over all artistic expression that was put into the film.

B00005QIPH|4.0|This CD received great reviews from every mgazine i read, so i was extremely excited when i picked it up. When i first heard it, i was dissapointed. If your looking for amazing talent, you came to the wrong place. If your looking for FUN, dirty, sounding rock then you should check it out.After i listen to it a few times it grew on me. You cant think of it as the next era of rockin roll as one reviewer put it, but as a bucnh of guys that have managed to write some cool music. The CD's sound is quite original, and is a breath of fresh air. Describing the music, i would call it, simple bass and guitar riffs that are extremely catchy. Give this CD a chance, its creative. Lyrically i've heard better, musically i've heard better, but if you sit down and let it play you'll enjoy this album. peace...
B000050FEN|5.0|I didn't enjoy this film.  Like 'Apocalypse Now,' I didn't enjoy it; in fact, it sickened me at times.  But--wow--what a great film.  Watching it, I got the feeling that its makers paid the closest attention to the minutest detail; that they took what they were doing very seriously, and I got the feeling their movie was trying to say something very important.  And so I say it's great because it seriously tries to say something and does.  I'll let you figure out the message for yourself, though.  But don't worry--you won't have trouble discerning it.  This isn't a film of vague symbolism.  It'll give you the message outright, almost blatantly.<br />There's nothing more I appreciate than realism.  There are few films as realistic as this one.  There are many murders in the film; it shows the murder victims just as a homicide detective would see them.  The detectives are shown as they should be also, real.  Everything is accurate and realistic.  However, realism alone doesn't make a great film.  'Seven' is fully engrossing too.  So much so, in fact, that at its end, I felt as if my insides had been rearranged.  First torn and ripped apart, then rearranged.  <br />If I had just sat down halfway through the movie, watched ten minutes, then left, I would've left thinking.  But I sat and watched it all.  Afterwards, I didn't go anywhere.
0452282152|5.0|If you are interested in more &quot;Factual&quot; historical fiction then you will not like this book.  Not much is known about Vermeer, so in this novel we have to settle for the essence of the painter. This book is great because it is simple yet leaves Vermeer where he mysteriously belongs.
0451160916|5.0|Recently, I had the privilege to read a great book, this being The Shining, by Stephen King.  This was actually my first book I have ever read of King's, however I had seen some of his books converted to movies.  I indeed had seen the original and new versions of The Shining, and I must add that what they say is true, the book is always better than the movie.  In some spots, I feel that I had a better picture painted in my head reading the book, then the picture painted in my head from the movie.  In case you have not read the book nor seen one of the versions of the book, I now feel it is my duty to give you a brief overview of what this book is about.  The Shining, is about how a recovering alcoholic, Jack Torrance, and his family move into a hotel to watch over it, while it is closed for the rough Montana winter.  Every winter, a caretaker is selected to keep an eye on the hotel and make sure nothing happens to it, and to watch over it and make sure it does not become dilapidated or run down.  The Torrance's later find out about a previous winter caretaker who ended up murdering his family in the hotel. They discover that this hotel is now haunted, when strange things begin to happen.  Jack's son, Danny posseses a gift called the &quot;shine&quot;, which allows him to sense all of the bad ora in the hotel.  The hotel wants to keep Danny there for good, and tries to use Jack to help aid this.  I really liked this book, and it often times gave me the chills, it was quite scary in many parts.  This will be classified as one of my favorite books.  I feel that King did a wonderful job in writing this book, and would not change a thing about it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Just like many other people, I thought this was going to be the album where Incubus would sell out. Man, was I wrong! This album is so diverse and varied, and it works, every song flows and I never skipped a track. Better than &quot;Make Yourself&quot;, but slightly inferior to the superior &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E&quot; <BR>Best songs on CD: Under My Umbrella (very &quot;science&quot;-like song. the incubus i used to know)<BR>&quot;Mexico&quot; ( haunting and poignant, yet very effective) and<BR>&quot;Blood on the Ground&quot; (great, splendid, cool)
B00003CY0U|2.0|A lot of people will probably vote this review &quot;not helpful&quot; but I'm posting it anyway: Normally I'd give this better-than-average<BR>thriller four stars. However, due to 9/11, this film is now more disturbing than entertaining. I know it had it theatrical run before the war but they should have sat on the video issue for another few months. Or at least re-eddited it. We don't need to see police being blown up or people falling &amp; exploding in a movie when we can see the same things on the news!
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie is dreadful!!!  I couldn't stand it in any way.  It was a 3 1/2 hour soap opera about a love triangle.  Horrible.
B00005A46T|4.0|Yet again Slipknot have released a masterpiece of sound and fury signifying everything. The only thing stopping this album getting five stars is the lack of percusion and sampling, (except for in the last track IOWA (killers are Quiet). C'mon Slipknot the percussion in songs like &quot;Prosthetics&quot; and &quot;Scissors&quot; of the first album made it a masterpiece, along with the sampling in songs like &quot;No Life&quot;.<br />However this album is great on another level because of some sheer brilliance in the guitars, drums and vocals of Corey.<br />I imagine that just like the previous album my favorite songs will change weekly, and at the moment they are, The Heretic Anthem, IOWA, People = S..., and Skin Ticket.<br />I Can't wait to hear these songs live !!!!
0785731490|4.0|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<BR>An exciting and short book<BR> Mr. Gabriel John Utterson and his nephew Richard Enfield discover a man who is ragged and filthy. His name is Edward Hyde. This creature tramples a little girl, and then comes out with ten pounds in gold and a one hundred pound check with the name Henry Jekyll. Mr. Utterson investigates and finds that Henry Jekyll's will gives most of his possessions to this Edward Hyde. When Mr. Utterson talks to Henry Jekyll he finds Dr. Jekyll doing an experiment. Dr. Jekyll's experiment is to bring out the split personality in him. He concocts a formula that changes him into this split personality. Bt his experiment goes wrong, Edward Hyde is trying to take total control of Henry Jekyll's body. Dr. Jekyll has a limited amount of formula to keep Mr. Hyde away. What will happen when Dr. Jekyll runs out of formula?<BR> \\"All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was stumpy along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe eight or ten was running as hard as she was able down a cross street. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at the corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man trampled calmly over the child's body and left her screaming on the ground.\\"<BR> \\"He put the glass to his lips and drank at one gulp. A cry followed; he reeled, staggered, clutched at the table and held on, starring with injected eyes, gasping with open mouth; and as I looked there came, I thought, a change-he seemed to swell-his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt and altar-and the next moment, I had sprung to my feet and leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me from the prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.<BR> `O God!' I screamed, and `O God!' again and again; for there before my eyes-pale and shaken, and half fainting, and groping before him with his hands, like a man restored from death-there stood Henry Jekyll!\\"<BR> Gabriel John Utterson is a lawyer of a rugged countenance. He never smiled. He's lean, long dreary, dusty and lovable.<BR> Richard Enfield is a nephew of Mr. Utterson who is well loved throughout the town.<BR> Dr. Lanyon is a wise old colleague of Henry Jekyll. He also knows Mr. Utterson.<BR> Henry Jekyll is a scientist. He is very smart and discovers a new split personality formula.<BR>The story takes place in London, England in the 1800's or nineteenth century. It is an old fantasy novel with a little suspense mingled in. The problem is Dr. Jekyll's experiment sort of traps him in the body of Mr. Hyde. He can only stay Dr. Jekyll when he has drinking the formula.<BR> The author has made this book very suspenseful. He has done that by shifting the point-of-views from person to person and in many different forms. He has made this writing very pithy by using semi-colons and comas a lot. The characters are also described well as with the setting of the book. The plot is just a very good plot.<BR> People who like to read suspenseful novels would like this because it's suspenseful. Mystery readers will like this book. Also, people with great imaginations will like this book because it gives a lot of details that paint great pictures.<BR> This book isn't like any other book I have ever read. It has a totally unique style with much detail and extensive writing. Yet, this novel is a very quickly read novel, unlike other excessively detailed books like Dracula. This book is not boring like To Kill a Mockingbird and Dracula. This book is fun unlike those boring books. It doesn't discombobulate the plot with detail like those other books. This book is humorful unlike those stern previously mentioned books.<BR> Other fantasy books are usually not even close to realistic. Whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is close to being conceived realistic. This book has a general morbid feeling to it where other fantasies are sometimes cheerful and happy. This book is different than Bram Stoker's work. Dracula (Bram Stoker's work) is very boring, morbid, long, and not fun at all to read. Robert Louis Stevenson is a much better writer according to me.<BR> The author uses a very wide range of vocabulary. It uses many 19th Century terms that seem weird and different to me. This is very impressive to me. One thing bad about his writing is his punctuation. He uses way too many semicolons and comas. He makes one sentence out of six or seven sentences. He is way too pithy.<BR>  This book was not the best book I ever read, but was not the worst book I read either. This book was mediocre. It was miles ahead of Dracula and To Kill a Mockingbird. Those books were boring, whereas Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is fast paced, quick, and fun to read. Since it's morbid it's not really good. Since it is very short it is a good book on my list. To read this book is very easy. All you have to do is read until you want to stop. Since this is short and fun you will finish it in no time. Students out there if you need to read a book and you have to read a book, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is your choice. Mainly cause its short and sweet.

B00003CXXJ|5.0|Well when i first got in the movie i was kind of sceptic. But after the movie i didn't regret seeing it, cause in Shrek there's not a scene you want to delete. The personality of each character is just amazing and the humor is not superficial. Also you escape (on purpose) the traditional cliches of &quot;the last hardfight between th good guy and the bad guy&quot; and stuff like that. Even the little tributes to other movies are original and surprising funny. Well in two words: Great Movie.

B00003CXA2|4.0|I've watched Forrest Gump for the first time since its initial theatrical release and was quickly reminded just how great a film it really is. The film itself has been critiqued many times, so I will instead concentrate on the DVD contents and presentation, as usual.<br />Disc 1 contains the movie as well as two different running commentaries. The first commentary by director Robert Zemeckis, producer Steve Starkey and production designer Rick Carter is full of details and never lags, but I couldn't escape the feeling that I wish that they had answered a few more questions about specific scenes, etc. That's not to say that they didn't divulge interesting information about the making of the film, or that I didn't enjoy it, but I expected a bit more from a commentary by three people. The second commentary is by producer Wendy Finerman, and is fairly insightful. There are a few extended moments of dead air, but for the most part she offers information about characters, their development and the subtle visual and verbal cues used to convey that growth. She occasionally resorts to describing the action on the screen and stays away from the technical info of the first commentary, but provides a nice analysis of the film's emotional undercurrents.<br />Disc 2 contains most of the good stuff about the production that was omitted from the commentaries, and as I felt with Zemeckis's Cast Away DVD collection, it was probably planned that way so as not to be redundant. The &quot;documentary,&quot; Through the Eyes of Forrest Gump, is actually just a promotional fluff piece that was also included on the original laserdisc. There are a couple of screen tests which only underscore the acting abilities of Tom Hanks and Robin Wright, as well as some great breakdowns of makeup, sound and production design. An extended section on visual effects is the centerpiece of the second disc and includes some unfinished deleted scenes and disections that are very informative and entertaining. As Zemeckis says in his commentary, if you notice the effects, then he hasn't done his job, and as with Cast Away, you'll be surprised just how often visual effects were used besides in the obvious circumstances.<br />All in all, this is a good, thorough DVD package. It's not quite as good as some (Fox's &quot;Five Star Collection&quot;), but better than most. And that's all I have to say about that.
B00005NWRS|3.0|The first five tracks on this album (&quot;New York&quot; through &quot;Rescue Blues&quot;) are brilliant; in fact, when I played the CD for the first time, I started to get that &quot;Oh My God&quot; feeling that every music junkie gets when they're hearing something truly exceptional for the first time. Unfortunately, the buzz didn't last as the remaining 16 (!) average-to-damn-near-embarrassing (&quot;Enemy Fire&quot; and &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; have to be two of the worst songs I've ever heard in my life) songs played themselves out. I can't recall the last time I've heard such a lopsided record -- or one that failed so completely to fulfill its initial promise.  Buyer beware....

B00005QHPQ|4.0|at this English/Spanish crossover thing.  Unlike fellow Latin heartthrob Luis Miguel who refuses to &quot;sell out&quot; and continues to enjoy successes with his pop and traditional bolero albums, Enrique Iglesias can sing either English or Spanish, with the former not being his forte.  Better material would probably do the trick, because he's got the voice and the looks to be bigger than he already is.  The &quot;spanglish&quot; &quot;BAILAMOS&quot; was the last real big hit for him, but the haunting version of &quot;HERO&quot; seen on the WTC star studded telethon is the big winner here, and should hit the charts hard very soon.  The Spanish version of this beautiful song is also included here, with equally moving results.  This is the kind of song Enrique was born to sing.  <BR>It's his cracks at pop that come off as weird, like &quot;LOVE TO SEE YOU CRY&quot; or the racy &quot;ONE NIGHT STAND&quot;, (which is a pretty good song after all) The electronic sound made Cher a big hit a few years back, but I don't care for it in Enrique's arrangements.  Alot of this music will probably be a big hit overseas.  Of all the &quot;fast&quot; songs on this CD, I liked &quot;SHE BE THE ONE&quot; best (HERO is my favorite of all)  It's got a good beat and clever phrases and hooks.  With better writers and arrangements, Enrique will do very well in the crossover market, and this album's a better stepping stone than his last (&quot;ENRIQUE&quot;) was.

0684874350|3.0|Angela's Ashes is a wonderful book written about the author's childhood. It tells of his difficult family life, and the sickness and poverty in Ireland at the time. It's written beautifully in an Irish dialect that makes you fell part of the book. The slang expressions used by the characters are comical (i.e. &quot;arse&quot;). The book deals with serious issues like alcoholism and religion, and sometimes it's depressing. The way the author uses flashbacks sometimes can confuse you, especially as the family moves back and forth between America and Ireland.  Overall, the best part of the book is the easy storytelling style and the family love, which exists despite their problems.

B000002GYI|5.0|Creating some lush digital sound scapes Kraftwerk delves into Computer World with cold emotionless trackes. This album is Kraftwerk at their most technology driven. This is what kraftwerk dose best! <br />I like that most of the songs are more than three minutes long, some intertwine with each other. Computer World is not my favorite piece of their work, and it's no Man-Machine but it is still a substantial album and worth many listens.

B00005OWIU|3.0|John Williams has done some awesome scores in the past for Xmas movies (Home Alone) and this is no exception. But unfortunately, because Harry Potter has a large audience of kids, this score doesn't go all the way in being exciting enough to get your pulse racing or to be truly magical. Which is a shame considering the movie is all about magic. There seem to be about 2 main themes that are used a little too often without the use of sub-themes to us feel what characters feel or have more emotion in plot developments. Williams just seems to use the images to have a large orchestra booming. Not much of an atmosphere is created and the entire score seems too generic to stand out from Williams' previous work or anyone else's. It's quite bizarre that in a CD lasting over 70 minutes very few themes could exist or be developed and embellished. Pick this one up cheap if you really want it.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|The new album Escape is a great escape from a lot of the trash that exists on the market...even if you are not an Enrique fan, I suggest giving it a listen to.  The only song which really reminds me of the first album is the current single Hero...which is truly a great love song.  However, the rest of the album gets your feet moving and it is a great mix of rock dance music...the best songs...'Escape', 'Don't turn off the lights', 'I will survive', 'Maybe' and 'One Night Stand'.  I think that Enrique's influences in the 80's...Springsteen, REM, Chicago, etc really come through in this music.  I found the entire CD very inventive and large change from the latino oriented music of his first album.  Bravo to be able to successfully make a change in musical taste and keep it excellent.
6302759110|5.0|This version of Bram Stoker's classic novel is one of the best movies that deal with the tragic story of Vlad Dracul (Dracula).  Gary Oldman is the perfect count, his accent and his acting is chilling and yet tragic.  Winona Rider portrays Mina the woman who is loving two men, Dracula and Johnathan Harker, portrayed by Keanu Reeves.  Sir Anthony Hopkins is Abraham Van Helsing, the &quot;mad hero&quot; who knows the power and the deadliness of Dracula.<br />The special effects are outstanding, especially when it comes to the many versions of Dracula presented.  Oldman really put himself through the make-up chair and stunts for this movie.  The scenery is creepy, especially Castle Dracula and the scenes of old London.  The costumes are effective, except when it comes to some of the fashion excesses of the costume designer of the movie.  But, I'm being picky so it dosent distract from the movie.<br />I'm quite impressed of Francis Ford Coppola's allowing Dracula to be portrayed as a tragic historical figure.  This is one of the few movies that shows why Dracula turned away from God and pursued a path of blood and destruction...All in the name of Love...I also liked how the story began in the year 1462, when Vlad Dracul had to defend the eastern Holy Roman Empire from the Turks.  It is a nice touch and is somewhat accurate historically...<br />Throughout the movie, the actors in this are excellent...Sometimes the story lags a bit but it picks up in the nick of time....Scary, tragic and chilling is what I would describe it to be.<br />A great line in the movie is when Dracula tells Johnathan Harker..&quot;The luckiest man in the world is the one that finds true love&quot;....Wow!  Quite a line!<br />I highly recommend this movie to those who like a good scary yet tragic movie...
B00004XQP4|2.0|Warning isn't necesarrily a bad CD.  It just isn't all that great.  It lacks Green Day's usual energy and humor; the songs seem to get diluted and repetitive.  Minority, one of the CD's better moments, is a catchy anthemic song about nonconformity and shunning authority, as is the title track, Warning, with lyrics that were supposedly taken off bumper stickers.  I found the song Waiting to get pretty annoying, Billie Joe's voice seems almost nasal on this track and is it just me or does it sound a hell of a lot like a song called Downtown or something?  I heard a radio DJ mention that too.<BR>If you're looking for a good Green Day CD, you'd be better off with one of their earlier efforts such as Dookie or Nimrod, from before they seemed to lose their edge.  If you like Green Day, also check out Bad Relgion, a great punk band, The Living End, Suicide Machines, etc.<BR>Growing up, selling out, call it what you want but Green Day just isn't the same with Warning.
B00003CWPL|5.0|It appears that the wait won't be much longer.  With \\"Mulholland Drive\\" arriving to fantastic reviews (and, yes, it was mind blowing and deeply disturbing, and very tragic), Lynch has gone interview-crazy of late and in an interview with the L.A. Weekly (free paper) he basically let it be know that he is working on the DVD versions of \\"Eraserhead\\" and \\"The Elephant Man.\\"  Of course, the man is a control freak (in the nicest of terms), and has had a staff of one (lucky) person working on digitally cleaning up the E-head and E-man prints... a frame at a time.  He tells the interviewer that \\"Eraserhead will be the cleanest looking film, not a scratch or bit of dust.\\"  It seems they're removing motes from the very eye of the deformed baby itself!  Well, suffice to say, the DVD will not have many extras (as the Japanese laserdisc (at least the VHS copies on eBay) has his short films: \\"The Alphabet,\\" \\"The Grandmother,\\" and \\"The Cowboy and the Frenchman\\") if any... Lynch isn't too keen on that aspect of DVD, and just wants to present the film as is (save for the dirt and scratches on the old prints).  As I write this, and the article was only out about two weeks ago, it appears both DVD's may be released within a year... though, with Lynch you never know, but yes indeed! eventually we will have a DVD \\"Eraserhead\\" to enjoy (and I just got my Japanese laserdisc VHS copy!).  Hopefully, this information is not erroneous, but since it comes straight from the mouth of the genius himself, I feel I can post this in confidence that a DVD release may be right around the corner.

B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams score for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone almost immediately draws listeners into a  world where magic not only exists, but  flourishes.  Many of the tracks feature music in the same vein as music Williams composed for Hook, especially the Prologue and Hedwig's theme. The music for the Quidditch match features the brass instruments, and conveys the soaring competition of this popular wizarding sport. &quot;The Face of Voldemort&quot; contains music entirely appropriate for  a young boy  confronting his greatest fear.   All in all,  Williams  has composed a score that is almost as  magical as J. K. Rowling's book.  I can't wait for the movie!
B000002LGW|5.0|I have no words to describe how this music make me feel, every day I discover something GREAT about them I never feel tired<BR>for any of their songs...<BR>I LOVE THEM!! I LOVE THEM!! I LOVE THEM!!
B000003TA4|1.0|To say the very least. Who thought signing this &quot;band&quot; was a good idea? I hope it is a very long time before we hear another band this &quot;important&quot;. This definitely doesn't &quot;Wack me&quot; (sic) nostalgic. Just a horrible bunch of bad songs, poorly played.
B00005NGSE|5.0|There must have been something in the water of hard rock in the late 70s, because within a matter of months, we saw some of the best live hard rock albums being released.  Cheap Trick &quot;At Budokan&quot;, Ted Nugent &quot;Double Live Gonzo&quot; UFO &quot;Strangers in the Night&quot; and of course, this masterpiece.  This album captures the Scorpions at arguably their best.  This is their last recording with Ulrich Roth, but it is a great one.  The song selection is great, and you get some songs that were not available on their 5 previous studio recordings:  &quot;All Night Long&quot;, Suspender Love&quot;, and three cover songs &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; , &quot;Hound Dog&quot;, and  a Japanese folk song &quot;Kojo No Tsuki&quot;.  Some of the peaks are &quot;We'll Burn the Sky&quot;, &quot;In Trance&quot;, &quot;He's a Woman, She's a Man&quot; and &quot;Steamrock Fever&quot;.  Of course, we call all complain and nitpick about how this song or that song was not chosen for the setlist, but you can't please everybody. Still, you get some of the best Scorpions songs ever (although I like all of their stuff) and with the exception of &quot;We'll Burn the Sky&quot; and &quot;In trance&quot; none of these songs are ever played at all in concert today, so we can listen to this great recording and imagine we were seeing this concert (which was recorded before I was born) I would only like to be able to see a video of this concert, but video was very rare back then, and the quality would probably be pretty poor.  I guess the visual aspects have to be left to our imagination.  No matter what, you can't deny the brilliance of this record, and this gem should definitely be in the collection of every fan of 70's-80's hard rock.  No matter what collection this record is in, it will definitely shine through.
B00000JZI9|4.0|Having been a fan of this movie for many years, I knew what to expect from it, however, I was blown away with the quality of the transfer and audio re-mastering.  Having watched this on worn VHS tape, it was an entirely new experience.  The sound and video quality is fantastic.  Don't even get me started on the wide screen!  This is one for your collection.
B000000WA4|4.0|When I first purchased this album around five years ago, I was excited.  This is the only album I own by the Smashing Pumpkins, and for the most part, my first impressions were good.<br />Back when I bought this, I was mainly into grunge, and hard rock-ish stuff, like Nirvana, SoundGarden, etc...  So fast-paced, loud songs like &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Jellybelly&quot;, &quot;Bullet with Butterly Wings&quot;, &quot;Tales of a Scorched Earth&quot;, &quot;An Ode to No One&quot;, and &quot;X.Y.U.&quot; were my favorites.  But for the first 6 months or so, I made the big mistake of ignoring the rest of the stuff on this album.  I think that I mostly listened to the first cd, and thought less of the second, espcially the later and final tracks.  <br />After owning the cd for about a year, I started to explore the album more.  I got hooked on softer songs like &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Muzzle&quot;, &quot;Galapogos&quot;, &quot;Thru the Eyes of a Ruby&quot;, and &quot;Tonight, Tonight.&quot;  For the most part, I got tired of those &quot;old&quot;, hard songs I previously deemed my favorites, with the exception of &quot;Jellybelly&quot; and &quot;Zero.&quot;  I explored the second cd more, but I still didn't listen to the final songs on either album much.<br />Finally, after owning the cd for a few more years, I tried listening to all of the cd equally.  I started to see some of the other, lower profile tracks like &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;Stumbleine&quot;, and &quot;We Only Come out at Night&quot; as masterpieces.  By this point, I'd grown to accept, like, and even love about 80% of the album, but there was still that other 20%.<br />Over the next few years, I listened to that other 20% fairly compulsively, and I simple couldn't grow to like it.  In this time, I finally decided which tracks were for me, and which weren't.  The portion which I like is exactly half, the rest being purely mediocre pieces of experimental and filler music.<br />Here are the songs which, after 5 years of listening, have shown through as great works of music: &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, &quot;Jellybelly&quot;, &quot;Zero&quot;, &quot;Here is no Why&quot;, &quot;Love&quot;, &quot;Galapogos&quot;, &quot;Muzzle&quot;, &quot;Where Boys Fear to Tread&quot;, &quot;Bodies&quot;, &quot;1979&quot;, &quot;Thru the Eyes of a Ruby&quot;, &quot;Stumbleine&quot;, &quot;Take Me Down&quot;, &quot;We Only Come Out at Night&quot;...  As for the rest, they pretty much just suck (In my opinion).  <br />Overall, I'd recommend getting this album for the good songs, but only if you really like the smashing pumpkins.  It is a good album, but it also has a lot of filler, and lots of unmemorable tracks.  That said, enjoy!
B00000ILDE|5.0|There isn't much of a plot, but it sucks you in and you just have to keep watching.
B00000DFSK|4.0|The best of 1980-1990 by U2 may not be their finest, I believe they have more picks in their later Zooropa album but this collection is also impressive, and gives a clearer picture of the U2 heyday. My favorite is the &quot;unforgettable fire&quot; because it really has the sexy electronics and back ups embedded in the arresting guitar riffs.<br />One can experience the original Bono throaty vocals and smothered sensuality along with the music than speaks holier than religion.  At least, this release gives a fresh perspective after a disappointing Pop.
B000001A3H|3.0|OK enough already. I bought this CD after reading all the hype, and was very disappointed. This is NOT a classic album, this is not even a very good album. It is mediocre at best.<br />All the reviewers who are making this band out to be the 'new and improved' Black Sabbath (or any other 'classic' heavy metal band) are missing out on something very important. The classic heavy metal bands could do a lot more than just go \\"THUMP THUMP\\" at high volume. They could back it up with technical wizardry, those bands all had at least one genuine musical virtuoso. Tony Iommi, John Lord, Ritchie Blackmore, Jimmy Page, Buck Dharma etc could rip off solos that would curl your nose hairs. The Thump Thump was merely a foundation that was laid to provide a framework for those brilliant solos.<br />Kyuss has no master musicians, the songs just bang along (rather nicely I admit), but if you're waiting for any mind blowing solos, you will be left waiting. I don't blame the band for any of this. They're just playing music, and for what it is it's OK. I do have a problem with the hype (...). These guys don't belong in the same class as the great heavy metal bands, (...).
0803726570|5.0|My girls, ages two and four, love this book and so do I!  It's a clever rhyme and a sweet story that teaches a subtle lesson about how doing things for others can ultimately benefit oneself.  I also appreciate how everything is not spelled out for the reader and there are some portions near the end that the child has to figure out.  Very clever -- my favorite Halloween book this year.  Nevertheless, this book is not Halloween-specific, and is definitely appropriate for any time of the year.
0345409671|4.0|First: THE DISCLAIMER<BR>Okay, I'm biased. I'm an Anne Rice fan... more to the point I'm a vampire chronicle fan... you have been warned.<br />Now: The Review<BR>If you are a follower of the vampire chronicle, this is one great reunion. Yes, they are all here and more. If you have followed the series its pretty clear that Lestat has been heading somewhere. With Memnoch the Devil it looks like we've finally got there. This book sweeps Lestat, and us into the grand-daddy of all conflict- The devil vs. God. (Okay God isn't really fighting very much- but then HE doesn't really need to does he?) Lestat is his usual irreverant self demanding all manner of proofs and signs, so Memnoch really does have to try hard to impress.And that is the beginning of an exploration of human evolution, theology, and other esoterica as the devil (Memnoch) makes a sound case for Lestat joining his cause. <br />At times the book gets a tad too instructional, but that's okay- the concepts are interesting, and the research is very sound. You may not agree with the world-view put forward, but you do have to admit it is beautifully presented. <br />All in all, a great read on a rainy afternoon when you're feeling intellectual, and think your life is in a rut- chase through heaven and hell with Lestat and Memnoch and whatever its is that's eating at your soul will swiftly pale. Who knows? You might find a spiritual awakening.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie is by-far a great action film. It kept me on my feet from the beginning to the end. Its about a computer hacker that is on probation from previous hacking and was not suppose to do anymore, untill a hot lady came to his door step and offerd big $$$ to help hack into a goverment system called: code name: SWORDFISH. I dont want to spoil the action... but I will promise you that is a a sweet flick,,,, way better then any action film that came out this year by far!!!!<BR>Also another movie to view is called : FROZEN great movie also!
B00005OWIU|5.0|WOW, I got this album this morning on the day of release, and after only one day of uninterupted listening, I gotta say, that this is an unbelieveable masterpiece. I must confest, that I haven't read the books, but the magic, which is suspossed to be included in the novels is definitely captured in the score. The main theme is really mysterious and maybe, when you hear it the first time, not as catching as the Star Wars theme, but if you keep listening, you will consider it as at least as good as Williams' other famous themes, like, Star Wars or Jurassic Park. It creates the perfect mood for feeling the magic which it is suspossed to unleash. Once again, WOW!!

B00005OWIU|5.0|Once again, the wizardry of John Williams' music captures the mystery and delight of a magical land. The 19 selections chronicle the story itself -- the brass instruments herald the majesty of the Great Hall, while the woodwinds zip like the flight of the Golden Snitch.  The melodies are sure to raise goosebumps on the arms of any muggle wishing for Hogwarts admission.  A magical listening treat!
0060934913|5.0|Bourdain's eloquent descriptions of food and strangely addictive storytelling manner make this evil description of the catering industry a must read.  From short stories about food, wistful descriptive writing and crazed surreal stories of things that should not have happened, the hook is sunk deep and I found it impossible to put down.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Ok, for those who are wondering, this &quot;bootleg&quot; edition is simply the Director's Cut version without the Limited Edition numbers on it. Don't worry, it's not an illegal copy, more like an &quot;Official Bootleg&quot;. It was done so that fans who missed out on the Limted Edition can still get the DVD and all the extra goodies. I for one am glad they did so because I happened to miss out on it myself. The cover is done as if someone made an illegal copie and used a brown paper back to cover up the liner. It has handwriting-like text on it in what appears to be a few notes from Bruce &quot;Don't call me Ash&quot; Campbell. The actual DVD inside is done up like a DVD-R (Not Really Recordable) and is very humorous. It contains the exact same movie and features of the LE in the exact same quality. The commentary from Sam, Bruce, and Ivan is hilarious as was their commentary from the other Evil Dead DVDs. That in combination with the deleted scenes and the original ending make this a must have for those who want the whole story. This is the version of the movie that was originally done before they were forced to shorten it to 81 minutes and alter the ending. So if you missed out on the Limited Edition DVD then this is for you. This is definatly one for the fans out there.
0345409671|5.0|Warning, a slight spoiler.<BR>This has to be one of the most thought provoking works of fiction I've read in many years. In Memnoch the Devil, Anne Rice, takes us to heaven, hell and back again. The story is told from the devils point of view and shows satan to be the ally of man...not his enemy. At the same time revealing god to be the incompetant fool he surely is.<BR>One of the most powerful scenes is the crucifiction of christ. It exposes him as a weak coward. Unwilling to sacrifice knowledge of his divinity while walking among us. The idea that christ can empathise with man because he himself was one is complete nonsense. Christ always was aware of his origins and ultimate destination. To be truely human, you must know fear, despair, doubt and confusion. Christ never knew this. Even the 9 hours of torture he endured on the cross was nothing but an empty gesture. What is 9 hours of agony compared to an eternity of bliss?<BR>If you're a christian, be warned. Reading this book may just tear the blinkers from your eyes. Surely, critical thinking, is the enemy of faith.
0451204530|2.0|Of course the protagonist lost not only his memory but had the misfortune to fall into an alternative universe where in 1958 there existed the concept of xeroxing documents along with Cadillac Eldorados and Ford Fiestas, which in our universe came along many years later.  I too would have been as confused as our less-than-intrepid author, and I too would have lapsed into insipid dialog and unreal plot twists.<br />Mr. Follett gives great credit at the end of the book to his researchers, etc., who helped him.  Too bad none of them had the brains to do any research into contemporary history.<br />For shame, Mr. Follett.
B00003CY0V|1.0|This movie is insipid, stupid, and dull. When I saw Gone in 60 Seconds, I thought I had seen the worst movie I would ever see. I was wrong. Swordfish is all flash (and not really very interesting flash) and no substance: terrible plot, worse acting, and awful directing. Hugh Jackman's character &quot;hacks&quot; 128-bit encryption in mere seconds. Interestingly, in real life this takes hundred of SUPERCOMPUTERS months to do. I don't want to nitpick, but it wouldn't be hard to come up with plot elements that were more interesting AND more realistic.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I came across this CD and loved it the minute I put it in! This guy is really, really talented and sticks out in a recent sea of sound-alike singers and songwriters. He's got a unique and great voice and songs that stick in your head like glue. You can't miss this!!
B000007SPT|5.0|I first discovered this album in 1984 when I was 15 years old. It was beautiful and sad, just like my interpretation of life. I would close my eyes and play the cassette tape from beginning to end and I would be transported to another world. Never had music touched me the way this album did and I doubt another will ever come along that would invoke so many emotions. It's been 17 years and I still play the cassette from time to time. It still takes me away to another realm. I've thought of purchasing the cd, but the cassette seems to give it an even greater haunting sound. Life is tragic and wonderful, this music is the harmony of it all.
B00005QG9J|1.0|I wrote a review of this yesterday, but now that I've listened to it again it even worse. BUY SCIENCE! and then buy this and tell me that they have not &quot;soldout, because they definately haven't matured. BUY SCIENCE!
0440224764|3.0|The Partner, is a very intriguing story that is full of unexpected twists. The blend and diversity of characters throughout the book creates an adventerous and suspensful atmosphere. Patrick Lanigan is a lawyer and the main character in the story who is to be brought to trial for stealing ninety millions dollars from a law firm where he worked. Four years later he is finally tracked down in Ponta Pora,Brazil and after being brutally tortured was taken back to America to stand trial. To begin with the book really caught my attention and it was a strong begining but after a while there were to many facts and my interest began to fade. The storyline goes in and out of suspense and information making it a little difficult to stay focused with the plot. The different kinds of twists that are found in The Partner are very cleverly written and create a suspensful atmosphere that makes the book hard to put down at times. For example when you were finally finding out about what really happened to and who was the body that was used insted of Patrick and also when Patrick is being tortured. The character of Eva Miranda throws in an interesting dynamic because as the story continues you begin to become a little confused and suspicious of who she really is. To begin with she is a person who you trust but as you get closer to the end and you learn more information her character becomes a little more cloudy and suspicious. The story flows quite well and Grisham's writing style is enjoyable. The only weakness of the book would be when the information on people and numbers becomes to long and drawn out, although some of the information is needed the bulk of it tends to slow down the story. I enjoyed reading The Partner and would encourage anyone that is interested in suspense and mystery to go ahead and read it.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I was prepared upon walking into &quot;Hannibal&quot; I, like everyone else had the pleasure of viewing &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; in order to prepare myself for the upcoming sequel. After watching &quot;Silence&quot; I was looking forward to it, and I wasn't disappotinted. Because upon watching it I realized the this was Hannibal's movie. He was no longer going to be the madman confined away, spouting eerie rhetoric. Now The cannibal is loose and you'd better brace yourself if you intend to follow him.<br />I think the problem people had with &quot;Hannibal&quot; was that they were expecting another &quot;using Hannibal to track another serial killer&quot; movie. Well I knew that it was going to nothing of the sort. I knew that if we're tracking Hannibal, we were going to be playing an all new ball game. We follow him from Florence, Italy, living the quiet life as Museum curator Dr. Fell. Story-wise I couldn't think of a more appropriate place to find him. It was elegant, beautiful, but yet bears a darker side, traits that equate that of Hannibal Lecter. Even the movie itself has those traits. Director Ridley Scott obviously knew what he had in mind when he took on this project, because the whole film I felt as if I were peering into his being. The look of Hannibal is sleek, delicate, and intense. Ridley Scott knows how to create the atmosphere. <br />Take for example. Probably the most standout scene in the film is the dinner scene. The camera working was simple. It didn't require Matrix-like cinematography. But the one shots were all bust shots looking at each characters from the shoulders up. It displays the energy passing between Starling, Lecter, and Krendler as the shots switch from character to character, and in the middle of it all you have sadistically slow shots of Hannibal digging into Paul Krendler's cerebrum and cooking the pieces. The sequence in itself made me squirm numerous times in my chair. It's a beutiful thing when a film can affect you in so many ways. <br />But don't get me wrong, it wasn't just that little blip that made this film great. The film as a whole is unique in it's fashion. And tread a completely different path than the previous outing. Even Hopkins himself take the role down new avenues. Throughout &quot;Silence&quot; Hopkins is confined in a cell for most of the way. Well, as previously stated, HE'S OUT! Hopkins flawlessly managed to show us Lecter's taste, his style, his beaming intelligence, and ultimately his lethal nature. I was charged to watch what would ensue when Clarice and Hannibal would meet face to face, without glass in between. I was not disappointed. All of a sudden the same feelings I had watching those classic scenes from &quot;Silence&quot; but then there's the additional sense of Alert and caution because now he could do anything. Hannibal is an unpredictable man so don't bother trying to read him. <br />Though the most controversial change was Julianne Moore. What controversy? She is one of modern cinema's most solid and professional actresses. Try watching her in &quot;Magnolia&quot; and tell me you were not moved in any way. If you weren't then you must be dead. So I knew she'd do the role justice. Fact of the matter is the nature of &quot;Hannibal&quot; differs from &quot;Silence&quot; Jodie Foster, though as talented as she is would not have fit in with the tone and the pace of &quot;Hannibal.&quot; I feel that Moore's personality, her look and her acting ability, on the other hand fit like a glove. So I was never afraid of the role being sullied. <br />Fact of the matter is people need to destroy any expectations, when it comes to going to see a sequel, especially when it's a sequel to one of AFI's top 100 films. But in the End &quot;Hannibal&quot; is a film that stands on it's own and doesn't need the hype of it's predecessor to strive. <br />To sound like a cliche critic. &quot;It's a thrilling, intense, emotional powerhouse that can't be missed!&quot;
B000056K04|4.0|The Dave Mattews Band is a great band with great fans. The band is also known as one of todays best concert bands. But the latest CD that the group entitled has released &quot;Everyday&quot; has had mixed reviews among the fans.  Maybe it is the fact that Dave does not play the songs accousticly.  Some fans may not like it because they think that the band is changing totally to how they sound on the CD.  Although many fans do not like the new CD, many do like its new sound.  A little change is healthy.  This does not mean that the Dave Mattews Band is never going to be same.  Good songs are good songs, and &quot;Everyday&quot; has good songs for listeners to enjoy.
0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck was a very intriguing novel.  There were both strengths and weaknesses to either the plot, charaterization, and readability.  The book was a very easy and smooth book to read.   <BR>   The book was about the life of a man whose mind seemed intangible.  The story plot did not quite explain how he got that way, however, did make some excuses for the way he was acting. In the beginning or throughout the book, the story did not explain how Lennie's Aunt died.  Throughout the book, though, I got a pretty good feel for who Lennie was and how he thought of certain situations.<BR>   This book held my interest during the whole book because of its dialog, characters thought process, and the question what what would happen next. John Steinbeck did an excellent job of showing the good sides of egotistical people and how they deal with others.  <BR>   This was a great book to read and would be really good for a sequel.  It showed that there are different types of people in the world and that there are conflicting personalities at times.  I recommend this book to anyone who loves to just sit and read a book in one sitting.
1881273156|5.0|This book was part of my and my husband's premarital counseling.  It really helped me understand how to show him my love, and it helped me realize how I like to be loved. Our &quot;love tanks&quot; are almost always full now.  We also used this with his rebellious 14 year old daughter and gained some insight into her behavior.<br />Great book!
0743420373|3.0|I would say that this book helped me think of ideas I have never thought about.  These ideas and concepts could work with pretty much everybody, or so the book tells you.  I even have started to put these concepts into practice, like saving my money from the beginning to reach a higher income and choosing the same quality goods and services for a lower amount of money/price.  Stanley and Danko tells the readers that the only way to succeed is to follow the 7 basic principles.  It does not apply to everyone, even though this book tells you so.  In this way, it is biased.  I would only recommend this book to those who truly wants to be a millionaire and who would use the secrets in this book of becoming one.
B000021YQV|5.0|once in a blue moon, an album comes along of such compelling nature that whatever you are doing when listening to it for the 1st time..well..you stop doing it because the cd you have playing is so good it stops you dead in yr tracks.  it reaches out to you.  speaks to you, moves you in some way.  it reaches thru the speakers and says HEY STOP LISTEN TO THIS.  <BR>    i knew SOAD but never was thrilled with them.  this album changes ALL that.  i have purchased MANY cd's in the past year but this one i shoots up in my top ten.  this was an eye opener.  the music is incredible.  it combines death metal with slow harmony.  the band cranks out a hard fast riff and then suddenly stops and changes direction into a subtle quietness.  from fast and furious to moderate rock.  their is a multitude of musical styles.  they do not play any one style long.  a measure of this into a measure of that all in a hearbeat.  WONDERFUL.  <BR>    the lyrics cover a wide range of topics from goverment to charles manson (PRISON &amp; ATWA) and SERJ is a GEM of a singer.  he can scream, he can SING and his voice in itself is a instrument but it is so natural.  he croons, he sings and i can feel it hit me through the speakers.  the band is amazing.  great players who command the music and whip out the best album i have heard this year.  the best album i have heard in a LONG time.
038533348X|5.0|This book was full of unexpented twists, and was extremely well written. I've always been a fan of Vonnegut.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This was one of John Williams best works since Star Wars (and Jurassic Park).  Beautiful themes and a feeling of fantasy and imagination abound in this work and if the movie is half as good as the music is, it'll be a fantastic experience.  Definitely recommended!

B00005QHPQ|5.0|On his second english language album Enrique won't dissapoint his fans.  I had heard the first single Hero on the radio a month or so before the album came out and I knew I'd buy the album the day it came out and I'm glad I did.  The whole album is good but there are a few standouts...they are Hero, Escape, Don't Turn Off The Lights, and Love 4 Fun.  If you liked his last album don't hesitate to go out and buy this one.  Let's hope Enrique just keeps getting better with every album.
B000051VWW|4.0|After checking out THE BEST OF SADE I thought I'd give LOVERS ROCK a try. As I said before, I'm not a huge Sade fan but I enjoyed her best of collection. After listening to LOVERS ROCK I was impressed. Sade is an excellent R&amp;B singer and LOVERS ROCK is a simple, relaxing, stripped down R&amp;B album. It's loaded with soft acoustic guitar sounds and bass heavy beats. Sade's vocals are in top form here. Her voice is still smooth and romantic as ever. The songs are simple, both lyrically and overall production.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a great movie.  I saw it on the big screen with my 16 year old, who went in thinking that this was just another cartoon.  As it turned out, this was animation at its best and we were thrilled with this movie.<BR>Eddie Murphy was sooo funny as the donkey side kick.  <BR>This one is a must see and I recommend this movie for the entire family.
006016848X|4.0|Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus is a well written book.  It is evident that the author has spent much time delving into male/female communication.  This book offers a lot of practical advice concerning how to communicate correctly with a partner or spouse.  The author first explains much of the differences men and women have and then goes about trying to explain the best ways to communicate with the opposite sex.  Although every person is different, this book does help clear up many miscommunications that occur between the opposite sexes.  I appreciate the many examples, and ideas the author has to offer.  The author also has offered many practical applications of how to communicate more lovingly and respectfully with the opposite sex, as well as use personal examples from his experiences with his wife.  This book is helpful when seeking to attain what one wants in a relationship.  If one is looking to strengthen a relationship or to understand why there is a problem in a relationship, this book will prove to be very helpful in answering many before unknown answers.
B00005NWRS|5.0|I can't believe what the Amazon reviewer wrote about this CD. That \\"Adams doesn't know how to play to his strengths\\" and that \\"he can't hone his creative abilities.\\" That's pure (nonsense) I thought I would come on here and read a great review like in SPIN and ROLLING STONE magazines. Both of those reputable mags had nothing but praise for Ryan Adams' 2nd solo venture. I praise this album too, it's so distinct from everything else out there except Pete Yorn. These 2 singer/songwriter/musicians give me hope that these teen pop years are coming to an end. Please don't listen to those who trash this album because, frankly, I don't know what they're hearing--GOLD rock/blues at it's finest!
0790743507|5.0|Considered by many (including myself) to be one the finest musicals ever made, SINGIN' IN THE RAIN is a perennial delight for young and old alike. Based upon a catalogue of songs written by Arthur Freed and Nacio Herb Brown during the late twenties and early thirties, this delightful film spoofs the turmoils of the transition from silents to the &quot;talkies&quot; in the movies. Originally planned for Howard Keel, who was enormously popular at the time, it eventually shifted to accomadate the persona of Gene Kelly who also co-directed. Donald O'Connor is possibly best-remembered for his terrific song and dance solo &quot;Make 'Em Laugh&quot;, an athletic tour-de-force - he won the Golden Globe Award in 1952 largely due to this. Nineteen year-old Debbie Reynolds was dubbed by Betty Noyes for her singing scenes and by Jean Hagen for Hagan's character Lina Lamont (for whom Debbie's character dubbed!) Generally considered as the apogee of screen musical art, its a virtually faultless film by any standards; over the years, it has surpassed AN AMERICAN IN PARIS in popularity and it is easily recognised as one of the all-time great movies. Strangely enough, when it was originally released back in 1952, it was found by some critics to be &quot;sluggish&quot; and &quot;without much warmth or wit&quot;! ............ It's terrific, folks!
B00004SCX6|5.0|After the enormus sucess of Britney's debut BABY ONE MORE TIME, what's a girl to do? Well, it seems you take that bubble gum pop and turn it up even more. Britney's second album OOPS I DID IT AGAIN did just that. It's an edgier, funkier, more mature album than her debut. It's more upbeat and Britney displays more attitude and maturity on here. Her voice is the same but Britney's strong point has never been her singing. She's more of a performer and she gets her point across on OOPS. While the single &quot;oops I did it again&quot; was basically a carbon copy of &quot;baby one more time&quot; the album is mostly filled with original material. Britney even gives her take on the Rolling Stones classic &quot;I can't get no satisfaction.&quot; OOPS I DID IT AGAIN is a great pop album and it show's Britney growing up.
B00003CXHJ|2.0|This movie is OK.  It is not a good movie nor a bad movie.  I enjoyed watching the crews interact and live in the unusual environment which a submarine provides.  However, the story contains much of the trite content that has been used several times in war movies.  You can take it or leave it.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Zero Hour refers to that un-nameable time after midnight. I love the creeping, sneaking feeling that opens it, Tanguerdia III. The final track recaps this mood with an ending that lifts us into ghost-time. A highlight track is Concierto Para Quinteto which displays the group's clear love and understanding of each other. Also cookin' is the hard-working Michelagelo while Contrabjisimo simmers.<br />All over, this is gentler then La Camorra, so maybe a better introduction to Piazzolla.<br />It's said Piazzolla considered this the highpoint of his recorded work; I don't think it outdoes La Cammorra. But it's proof that Piazzolla was well acquainted with the outer limits of human experience.
B000002AVF|5.0|I have been reading the other reviews of the album. I was completely shocked! I got this CD and it instantly became one of my favorites! I expected rave reviews. There were 1 star reviews, 2 star reviews! Don't get me wrong, lots of 5 and 4 star reviews more than 1 and 2 star reviews, but I was still suprised. Mariah Carey IS talented and just because she is leaning toward a hip hop style doesn't make her any more less talented (her hip hop stlyle is even cool).<br />1. Fantasy- This is a song that makes you want to get on the dance floor! The video is fun and I love the beats in this song. Her voice is powerful in this song! This song went to number 1 on the charts. <br />2. Underneath the Stars- I love this song! It has the beautiful melody. This song just naturally appeals to me. I can listen to this song over and over and not get tired of it. I have no idea why. I think this song is beautiful and it is kind of like a midtempo- not a ballad or dance song, although you could probably dance to this- but not freestyle, a choreographed dance.<br />3. One Sweet Day- This is such a sad, sweet song! It's about losing a loved one. Boys 2 Men sounds incredible, same with Mariah. This song hit number 1 too!<br />4. Open Arms- I have no idea why so many people thought this song was just &quot;nice&quot;! This song is definetly one of my top favorites off the album, maybe one of my favorite songs ever! She sings incredibly on this song. The first time I heard the song, it just touched my soul because while I listened to it, a story relating to the lyrics came up in my head. <br />She sings expressively and just the melody of the song touches my soul! One of the best songs ever!!<br />5. Always Be My Baby- This is a good song. I love listening to it. :D<br />6. I Am Free- This is a pretty song. Not one of my favorites, but really nice. I do not think it relates to her relationship with Mr. Motalla though, like people think. I mean, the lyrics just sound wrong, if I think about the lyrics and her relationship with him. Also, she didn't say I Am Free is about her relationship with him! <br />I love the lyrics of this song though. They are so pretty. I think the song is talking about when she had some issue with herself. She was &quot;Lost inside myself, With the world surrounding me, Wandering through the misery&quot;. <br />Then I think it was God who &quot;Gave me a breath of life, unclouded my eyes, With sweet serrenity, Lighting a ray of hope for me, and now I am free.&quot; Doesn't that sound so beautiful?? <br />Lol, I'm the type of person who loves the way words give me images in my mind.<BR>7. When I Saw You- This is one of my favorite songs off the album. It's a beautiful ballad. Beautiful lyrics. It gives me a story in my head when someone falls for someone. Doesn't everyone have that experience? <br />8. Long Ago- A r&amp;b song about how this guy used to like her, but now he doesn't and she wishes that wasn't so. It has a lot of r&amp;b in it, but I like this song (of course, I love r&amp;b)! She doesn't show her range in this song, she sticks with an alto sound and sound really cool!!<br />9. Melt Away- I love her voice in this song. It's not her range or anything she's showing, it's just how she's using her voice so beautifully! This song is catchy and fun to listen to.<br />10. Forever- This is a beautiful ballad! One of my favorite songs off the album! In my opinion, it has a lot of her old sound in it. I think lots of people don't think so, but I do. I don't know why people think it sounds like it's from the 50's, but I guess, it sort of does. This is just a sweet, beautiful ballad!<br />11. Dadream Interlude- A good interlude! <br />12. Looking In- This song is so sad, yet strong. It's talking about herself, kind of like saying how people don't know the real her, how she <br />&quot;smiles through a thousand tears, and harbors adolescent fears, she dreams of all, that she can never be, and wades in insecurity, and hidesherself inside of me.&quot; <br />It shows that Mariah does have insecurites like the rest of us, has her sad moments, etc. I do not think she is conceited like some people think she is. It's a perfect way of ending the album.<br />My fav. songs off the album are Underneath the Stars, One Sweet DAy, Open Arms, When I Saw You and Forever! Especially Underneath The Stars, One Sweet Day, and Open Arms- they are my absolute favorites!!
B00000DGUG|3.0|Alanis Morissette returned in '98 with SUPOSSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE. As a follow up to JAGGED LITTLE PILL it's good but flawed. First, the album way too long and only a handful of the tracks are actually good. Alanis over writes her lyrics all over this album. She talks and sings with way too much detail. It's as if she came loaded with information just for this album. The sound on SFIJ is a bit calmer than her previous but it still deals with some pretty heavy subject matter. It's pop/rock with some acostic influences. Most of the tracks don't even have hooks that you can remember. Certain songs like &quot;thank u&quot;, &quot;ur&quot;, &quot;so pure&quot; and a couple others have pop sencabilieies and hooks. As I said before, only a handful of songs stick out on SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE. Let's see if Alanis leaves a little to the imagination on the next album.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This CD is excellent!  However, if you've seen any of the trailers or commercials, then you already knew that.  If you've change to spare go and get this CD.  As Soon As Possible.
B00005O3VD|5.0|Hello, gorgeous. Funny Girl is the ultimate Streisand film. Barbra's Oscar winning film debut as the Ziegfeld star Fannie Brice has never been in better form. After a frame-by-frame image restoration and digitally remastered audio, this popular musical packs all the glitter of its 1968 premiere.     Ray Stark, son-in-law to the legendary Brice, first began working on a screen biography of his famous mother-in-law in 1948, but Brice herself rejected several scripts. Nearly a decade later, he commissioned a new screenplay from Isobel Lennart. When studios didn't bite, Lennart adapted her script for Broadway, with Jule Styne and Bob Merrill getting the nod to write the songs. Stark tapped a young Barbra Streisand, already a Broadway sensation in \\"I can get it for you wholesale\\" to play the Brice. The rest is entertainment history.    This DVD presentation is spectacular in quality, but its \\"Special Features\\" pale in comparison to those of \\"The Way We Were.\\" The documentaries \\"Barbra in Movieland\\" and \\"This is Streisand\\" are almost camp in their approach and scope, and I long for a present-day interview (better yet, audio commentary) with la Streisand that would have put the making of this film in better context. I'm hoping her future films, especially her directorial efforts, include a director commentary and background footage. (Barbra, can you hear me?)     That said, Funny Girl is still the centerpiece any Streisand fan's collection. A must have.
B000002AVF|5.0|I have been reading the other reviews of the album. I was completely shocked! I got this CD and it instantly became one of my favorites! I expected rave reviews. There were 1 star reviews, 2 star reviews! Don't get me wrong, lots of 5 and 4 star reviews more than 1 and 2 star reviews, but I was still suprised. Mariah Carey IS talented and just because she is leaning toward a hip hop style doesn't make her any more less talented (her hip hop stlyle is even cool).<br />1. Fantasy- This is a song that makes you want to get on the dance floor! The video is fun and I love the beats in this song. Her voice is powerful in this song! This song went to number 1 on the charts. <br />2. Underneath the Stars- I love this song! It has the beautiful melody. This song just naturally appeals to me. I can listen to this song over and over and not get tired of it. I have no idea why. I think this song is beautiful and it is kind of like a midtempo- not a ballad or dance song, although you could probably dance to this- but not freestyle, a choreographed dance.<br />3. One Sweet Day- This is such a sad, sweet song! It's about losing a loved one. Boys 2 Men sounds incredible, same with Mariah. This song hit number 1 too!<br />4. Open Arms- I have no idea why so many people thought this song was just &quot;nice&quot;! This song is definetly one of my top favorites off the album, maybe one of my favorite songs ever! She sings incredibly on this song. The first time I heard the song, it just touched my soul because while I listened to it, a story relating to the lyrics came up in my head. <br />She sings expressively and just the melody of the song touches my soul! One of the best songs ever!!<br />5. Always Be My Baby- This is a good song. I love listening to it. :D<br />6. I Am Free- This is a pretty song. Not one of my favorites, but really nice. I do not think it relates to her relationship with Mr. Motalla though, like people think. I mean, the lyrics just sound wrong, if I think about the lyrics and her relationship with him. Also, she didn't say I Am Free is about her relationship with him! <br />I love the lyrics of this song though. They are so pretty. I think the song is talking about when she had some issue with herself. She was &quot;Lost inside myself, With the world surrounding me, Wandering through the misery&quot;. <br />Then I think it was God who &quot;Gave me a breath of life, unclouded my eyes, With sweet serrenity, Lighting a ray of hope for me, and now I am free.&quot; Doesn't that sound so beautiful?? <br />Lol, I'm the type of person who loves the way words give me images in my mind.<BR>7.

6300182193|1.0|I saw the wonderful Play Dracula that this movie was based on or should I say loosely based on? This incredibly bad movie is nothing like the wonderful play that was a mixture of horror and humor with clever and witty dialogue, I saw this Dracula movie with Frank Langella thinking it would be a mixture of horror and wit like in the play but I was very disappointed, it wasn't the same story at all! I hope someday someone decides to really make a movie version of the play and makes it the way it is supposed to be, spooky and witty and excatly like the play. Even a filmed version of the actual play would be great!
B000021Y77|5.0|this is a great film. it is a unique look at three different directions a few small changes can take the story. i think it is very creative.
B000007R1M|5.0|I love it. I love Kraftwerk. They are special to me. To some other people, they are special. To my dad, who had the white cassette of this album, they weren't so special. But to me they are special, because I heard this album and knew my dad was listening to some wild music.<br />No reason to argue with all the other great reviews about this album. <BR>I want to mention that Mouse on Mars and Wolfgang Flur of Kraftwerk recorded an album together called YAMO. It's good, if you haven't heard it. The best of the old generation and the best of the new generation of German electronica got together and put out a sweet pop record with some great songs on it.<br />That's YAMO, Kraftwerk and Mouse on Mars, together! How spanky is that?!!?!?

B0000039LE|4.0|I'm not a big horror fan but I did Like Halloween, it was spooky but it wasn't too gory like a lot of the newer slasher movies. I liked everything in Halloween except what happened to the dog. I did enjoy watching this movie and I really like Jamie Lee Curtis. I highly recommend the movie!
B00005QG9J|5.0|The most innovative band in modern rock does it again - in a different way! Incubus has always avoided recreating themselves and it has done wonders for their music. I purchased this album Tuesday the 23rd and one week later was when I actually put in something else for a change. Morning View is the type of album that grows on you as you listen to it more and more. Jose's drum beats are as original as Chad Sexton's of 311; remember the unique basslines from the hit single Stellar from Make Yourself? These vibes sound almost nothing like them and it works so well. It goes without saying that Brandon Boyd's piercing yet pure vocals will leave you in melody heaven, especially since the lyrics are as honest and thoughful as poems from the English Romanticism period. The real deal here is DJ Kilmore's texture from the turntables. Not scratches like in SCIENCE but more like taking Make Yourself's spacy atmosphere to a higher level and leaving the listener in a different world. Whether you are a fan of this band or not, within 3 listenings you will have fallen in love with AT LEAST one song from this CD - this is why musical diversity is so great. It's hard to label Incubus as any form of rock or maybe even &quot;rock&quot; - period. My personal favorite song is &quot;Warning&quot; for the altogether flawless musicianship apparent throughout the track. If you have read until this point, there is nothing more that I can tell you than &quot;buy this album.&quot;<br />&quot;Goodbye - Nice to Know You!&quot; :)
0887309372|1.0|Let me begin by saying I completely concur with the other readers who trashed this book.  It is a total time-waster, a plate of rhetorical tripe, as are the reviews of those who raved about the book (many obviously paid off to write a nice, tidy review).  Most of the 'arguments' in this book could be overturned by your average teenager, and most of the 'laws' are reformulations of the first 'law' cursorily outlined in the first chapter.  And just so you don't think I'm some skeptical quack, I happen to work for a large branding consultancy.

B00005ATQI|4.0|Not as good as Stephen King's book but it was a good movie and Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall were very good, especially Jack Nicholson. There was some scary stuff in the movie but there were things in the book that weren't in the movie but should have been in it, like when the father exterminated the wasps nest and gave it to Danny to keep in his room and the wasps came back to life and started stinging him, also Danny's creepy experience on the hotel playground and his and Jack's experience with the hedge animals, but all in all it was a good movie and had it's share of some creepy stuff like Jack who's elevator didn't go all the way to the top to begin with began to have what was left of his mind taken over by the evil of the hotel and Danny with his psychic abilities having those frightening visions that were turing him into a basket case, what kid wouldn't act weird after seeing visions of hacked up murdered people.Though not as good or scary as the book I still think it's a good movie and I recommend it!
B00001ODHH|4.0|Let me begin by saying that this movie is absolutely hilarious.  Opposed to the the Evil Dead and The Evil Dead II, this movie has less gore and more humor.  Ash has become an all time favorite for not only myself, but also my son with his satirical humor.  This is definately a movie for the light-hearted, who can look at things in a different light.  Definately not a realistic movie, but not one that should be taken seriously either.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Boy what can i say..this dvd simply ROCKS ...im a Star Wars fan for the most part of my life (im 26),i liked TPM but didn't loved it like the original trilogy...this dvd is packed with featured unlike seen on any other dvd even better then T2 and The Abyss,if you are not a Star Wars fan u just got to have this for the maximum sound and picture quality,if you are Star Wars fan..well...you probably have it already ;)<BR>now all there is to do is to wait for the original (and improve) trilogy on dvd...(...)
B000031XCR|5.0|This CD has some of Cline's greatest hits such as, the power of love,it's all coming back to me now...etc!! But the really best songs are, 'all the way, if walls could talk, my heart will go on, and the first time ever i saw your face. Buy this album,today!!!!
0792836634|3.0|I like Catherine Hicks and Chris Sarandon and though Child's Play was kind of hokey I thought it was ok, I like that it had some scary parts but wasn't too gory.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I couldn't wait for this CD to come out, and was thrilled that it was released before the upcoming movie. Like many Harry Potter fans, I would become instantly transfixed whenever the trailer for the film would come on TV. There just was something so magical about the music that instantly hooked me! And I was surprised to find that the composer was none other than John Williams, famed for his compositions of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Indiana Jones.&quot; But it makes a great deal of sense. Williams' musical themes tend to become traditions, as the listener joyously commits his music to memory. This CD is no different!  It tugs at your mind and has you humming away before you know it! There are also some scary moods, which reminds you that not everything is Harry's world is merry and bright. But before long, Williams returns you to his sweeping themes, making you feel as if you're flying on Hedwig's wings or on a Nimbus 2000! This is a great CD to add to your library and will simply fuel the fires of you imagination in anticipation for the film!
B00003CY0V|5.0|Can this man do wrong.  John Travolta has shown us all that his acting days are far from over, since his true return in Pulp Fiction and here he is again in another fantastic film.  Action great, suspense good and the use of a good old british sports car (TVR) marvellous.  I cant wait for the next film.<BR>Action, Scenes, Chases, Story this film has it by the bucket.  Watch it.
B00005B0FN|5.0|I bought this cd after my first Oops... I Did It Again cd got broken it's really good it has all the original songs from OIDIA plus 3 bounus songs &quot;Heart&quot;, &quot;You Got It All&quot; and &quot;Girl In The Mirror&quot; My Favorite! song is &quot;Girl In The Mirror&quot;. plus it has a bonus cd with remixes of Stronger and Don't let me be the last to know and it has the videos Oops... I Did It Again, Stronger, Lucky and Don't let me be the last to know. I reccomend this cd to any Britney Spears fan. :)
0451092163|5.0|I read the Shining back when I first started reading adults books instead of just young readers books, the book was fantastically creepy and not a book you want to read at night when it's pitch dark out side and everyone else is in bed! I saw the movie with Jack Nicholson, it was good but not nearly as good as the book, in fact the movie can't hold a candle to the book! I very highly recommend this fantastic book, it is one of Stephen King's best horror books!
B00005B4GU|2.0|Are the other reviewers kidding me? This album is by far the worst they have done. It contains 3 ok songs, the singles, following by one that is played backwards! Alright, Kid A was great, it was different and sounded marvelous, but this is just extracts from it that didnt make Kid A. In Amnesiac, they're trying to bring the sound of Kid A and mix it with The Bends and trying to keep the &quot;new fresh ever changing sound of Radiohead&quot;. They've admitted they miss the guitars now, and i'm glad because they can't keep making Amnesiacs.
B00004Z4WR|5.0|Gone in 60 seconds and I was....  The colours, the quality, the sounds, fantastic.  Nick and Ange actors of great skill.  If you have not seen this film you must, car chases are excellent, well OK the chase at the end was a little bit far fetched but other than that STUNNING.
0783235607|5.0|Psycho is a classic and probably the best mystery/suspense/horror movie ever made! Anyone who would give this one or two stars probably only likes the repetitious unoriginal ultra violent and gory slasher flicks that are so popular these days and are filled with gore, decapitations, dismembered bodies, etc! Anthony Perkins an underrated actor was fantastic and utterly amazing as Norman Bates and is now one of my favorite actors! I very highly recommend this classic movie which I have on video and hope to get on DVD when I get a DVD player. This is the movie that started the rating system and to think the controversy about this movie wasn't so much about the violence but partly because of the shower scene but also because of Janet Leigh's character's scene at the beginning of the movie wearing a lacy bra and slip and that Seems very silly and unimportant these days!
B00004SAJK|4.0|Mechanix is the only Paul Chapman-era UFO album I own outside of the &quot;Best of the Rest&quot; compilation. While Mechanix may not live up to the glory of classic albums such as &quot;Lights Out&quot; and &quot;Obession&quot; (my personal fave), it still contains a good half album's worth of great songs.  Chapman is not as flashy of a guitarist as Schenker (not many are) but his riffs/solos are forceful and melodic.  The rest of the band are on form per usual, and I really dig Andy Parker's drumming as always.  Standouts here include:  The Writer (w/ cool Carter keyboard solo), the rockin' Doing It All for You, Feel It (complete with Mogg catchy chorus) and Dreamin'.  The creativity that UFO unleashed at will in the '70s has been pretty much lost by this time, but the album does rock and is still better than two-thirds of the releases in the genre.  If you like the classic UFO releases w/ Schenker, chances are you'll not be disappointed with Mechanix.
0792838068|2.0|More nihilism posing as art.  &quot;Let's watch pathetic people doing degrading things to each other!&quot; seems to be the Hollywood motto nowadays.  They produce it in abundance, then award it all the academy awards they possibly can (see &quot;American Beauty&quot;).<br />The rape scene in this flick is shameless, particularly the &quot;humor&quot; about Shue's character not being able to sit down afterwards.  Still, most of my male friends focused their attention on how &quot;HOT&quot; Shue was in it, as some of these reviewers have also done.  Am I the only one who sees something incredibly wrong in that?!?!?  Have you ever noticed that rape victims in films are almost exclusively attractive?  Have you ever wondered why that is?<br />Sensationalism.  Titillation.  We all fall victim to these things from time to time, but we don't usually mistake them for art.
B00004U8H4|4.0|Despite its title and a considerable amount of bloodshed, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is a superbly witty and satirical film. The film is ostensibly about a serial murderer who happens to be fabulously wealthy, handsome, fit, and successful, but it is really a sarcastic critique of the money culture that defined the nineteen eighties.<br />Patrick Bateman is a twenty-seven year old CEO who lives in the late 1980s and spends his leisure time in exclusive restaurants and clubs with his peers. He has occasional love affairs so meaningless that he can&#8217;t be troubled to remove his trousers during epidermal frictional activity, and of course, he kills people. Bateman is an odd bird who is obsessed with the comparative quality of business cards and who possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of contemporary (i.e. 1980s) music.<br />Bateman&#8217;s homicidal impulses are frequently governed by his intense hatred of the superficial world around him. (spoiler).<br />The message of this film is that in the yuppie culture of the late eighties, even if you were a self-confessing murderer, people would not be able to see you for who you were. In a sense, Bateman, the murderer, is like other extreme characters in literature such as Werther, Pechorin, and Merseault. Like his literary predecessors, Bateman is alienated by the superficial society around him and is driven to extreme forms of reaction against it. In a notable scene, Bateman brings two call girls to his apartment and commands them to debase themselves in front of him. Later, as he thrusts his tube steak in and out of their love pockets he makes ridiculous posses in front of a mirror, essentially laughing at himself.<br />To its credit, &#8220;American Psycho&#8221; is not a clinical or horrorific film. While serial killing is certainly a grizzly subject, it is a more a device and a motif than a theme in this movie. Much of the killing is performed off camera. What homicide we do see is stylized to the point of being ridiculous. In a wonderful way, the film goes out of its way to assure us that its concerned with satire, and a social critique not with simulating brutality.ridiculous.

B000002U9L|5.0|For 11 years, I have been a rabid fan of Labyrinth. When finding this Soundtrack I was ecstatic! I bought it right away, and what a good choice that was. It is by far the best Soundtrack around. If you are a fan of the movie, you will instantly become a fan of the CD. The songs are beautiful, fun, energetic, and emotional. Once you hear a song, and you can picture the scene perfectly, that's when you know that this CD is a real keeper. I recommend it to all ages, and especially those out there who love the movie Labyrinth as much as I do.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is Incubus' best CD, bar none... I have been a fan of them since they were an indie band, and, frankly, this is the best way to go with their music. If the didn't change and adapt they would be lumped in with Drowning Pool and Staind and all that junk, and there is no way they deserve that label. All you sell out whinners need to stop with that...So you would rather have Incubus make no money and not sell any records than make money and sell records and still make good music? Dang, you guys are selfish...There is no such thing as a sell out, if you are making good music you can't control your popularity at all! If you want to pull a NOFX and stay hesh and not put your S on the radio, then great, but an INCREDIBLE band and an INCREDIBLE CD shouldn't be kept from the public!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Absolutely the best animated DVD video package I've ever seen.  The extras that are bundled with the two-disk set are engaging and the games are entertaining.  One will not easily tire of this package.  In this day and age where so much uncertainty is around us; there is one thing certain, watching this DVD will give you a warm and happy feeling.

B00004XOWM|4.0|A lot of people are hating on this album but it came out last year and  has sold 5 million copies.  I didn't like Limp Bizkit until I heard both versions or rollin, my way, and take a look around on the radio.  Which are are easily some of the best songs on todays radio.  I really think the fans are taking this album way too seriously and tripping over the lyrics which are realy cool and the way cool rap/rock style.  I think the rap on here is really cool.  How could you not like a song like rollin'. If you're a fan that doesn't like rap then you won't like it in the first place. I listen to this cd a lot and its just a good cd for chillin,riding,partying,and when you're getting pissed at parents and different life situations.<BR>The only thing I don't like about this is lots of &quot;f&quot; words, but their mainly on hotdog, full neson, and my generation.Those 3 are the ones I usually skip.  Who knows what will be next. <BR>peace to all my freak out friends.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|You won't believe the visual quality of this 1937 Disney classic on DVD! This is simply breathtaking candy to the eye. To complement the best presentation available to date, Disney has cramped tons of bonus extras into this 2-disc set. This DVD is both a true collector's gem and a classic animation piece suitable for the whole family. You owe yourself to a copy of this great DVD.
B00005QATY|4.0|If you want to see something out of the ordinary, something which will take your mind off of the atrocities of today, watch this movie.<br />George Clooney proved that he is not just a pretty face.  He can act and act well.  Even his country accent is on the mark.<br />He reflects a boyish wonder throughout the whole movie.  Yet, you know that he is in charge all the time.<br />John Goodman has a colorful part in this movie, too.  He is a bible salesman who is anything but christian.  He plays his part very well.  He was a good choice.<br />Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou is a wonderful movie.  It keeps you watching and wondering what these three fools will do next.<br />The music is very good, too.  Especially, the song that Clooney's character becomes famous for.  I really like that song and it's not my kind of music.<br />Watch this movie.  It won't be a waste of time!  You will have a BONAFIDE good time.
B00000064F|4.0|After the rainy mournfulness of his debut, Five Leaves Left, Nick Drake's second album, 1970's Bryter Layter, presents a warmer, jazzier treatment of his sensitive songs. Flutes and saxophones replace the somber violins and cellos and many tracks take a more uplifting feel, moving Drake's sound closer to Van Morrison's Moondance than Fairport Convention's Liege and Leif. \\"I never felt magic crazy as this/I never saw moons knew the meaning of the sea/I never held emotion in the palm of my hand/Or felt sweet breezes in the top of a tree/But now you're here/Brighten my northern sky,\\" he sings on \\"Northern Sky,\\" and one can almost see a humble smile on the handsome, schoolboy face of the shy singer/songwriter. In fact, all songs, except the woeful \\"Hazey Jane\\" saga, seem to be more contented than Nick's previous work. He manages to be sweet, buoyant and peaceful without sounding generic, oversentimental or boring. The only way in which Bryter Layter is a step down from Five Leaves Left is its instrumental tracks. Drake's ability to pierce emotions does not transfer well into this format. The title track and \\"Sunday\\" dither into weightlessness. Besides that, the more Bryter Layter is as golden as Nick Drake's other work.

052594527X|4.0|Chevalier, the author, wrote a novel with a vivid imagination and based on facts. As a foreign reader, I could read the book without difficulty, which means she wrote it in everyday language. Of course it does not mean the style is rather light. While reading, I felt as if I were in Dutch of 1600s. She describled the artistic world of the painter Vermeer in a simple, but vivid language, along with the relations between a maid--Criet and the painter, then rich patron, and people around her. It is a romantic novel as well as a novel of the artistic world of the painter Vermeer. <br />If you want to read books simply out of the emptiness in your mind, I recommend this book. Read it and feel it.
B0000019PA|5.0|I just don't understand it... Jeff's not a great vocalist, but his vocals do reach out to you, and his songwriting talent is unmatched... But... It's all so lo-fi, so jangly and rough... <BR> Songs like &quot;Oh Comely&quot;, &quot;Ghost&quot;, and &quot;Communist Daughter&quot; touch on the melancholy side, whereas tracks like &quot;King of Carrot Flowers&quot; and &quot;Pts. 2 and 3&quot; are quite possibly catchier than anything I've ever listened to before... Jeff's surrealist poetry make for some of the best and most interesting lyrics available in a modern album... Listen to it... It's a real gem.
0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill by John Grisham takes place in Southern Mississippi near Memphis, Tennessee.  The story revolves around Jake Brigance, a lawyer who's defending an African-American named Mr. Carl Lee Hailey Jr. He openly shoots two caucasian boys as they were on trial for raping Mr. Hailey's daughter.  Now, Mr. Hailey is on trial for the murder of the two boys and Jake Brigance is facing off with Rufus Buckley, the District D.A for the twenty-second judicial district.  With the trial nearing, death threats and burning crosses have become a regular accurance with the Ku Klux Klan back in Ford County.  An informant, known only as Mickey Mouse, keeps the cops notified of  where the klan will strike next.  John Grisham used multiple literary elements.  For example, the burning crossed set by the KKK at Jake Brigance and the potential jurors houses were symbols of the Ku Klux Klan &quot;politely suggesting&quot; that they do not vote not-guilty for Carl Lee Hailey Jr's murder trial.  A Time to Kill was flooding with suspense!  Everytime I put down my book my mind would be on nothing except the story.  I would be up until eleven, twelve O'Clock at night because I couldn't put down the book, and the only way to stop reading would be to fall asleep in teh process with the book still draped in my fingers.  A main theme, or central message, was that of racism.  Throughout the book it was argued inbetween  characters that if Carl Lee Hailey Jr. was white he would not be on trial.  I have an interesting theory on the element of tone.  I am an avid watcher of Law and Order.  On the television show the District Attorney (or DA) is portraid as the protagonist.  Through a diference of obvious artistic opinion, the DA in A Time to Kill is portrayed as the antagonist.  A highly hated man who is just after publicity and a seat as governor.  The General mood of A Time to Kill is gloomy.  The main settings that cast a gloom glow are the jail, victims of the KKK, and Jake Brigance bustiling run-down office.  Mr. Grisham works exceptionally well with suspense, and being a past-lawyer himself, writes excellent courtroom dramsas that keep you yearning for more.  I also enjoyed The Client, which is my favorite book and Runaway Jury, both by John Grisham.  I am a big fan of John Grisham, and I find A Time to Kill to be one of his best.  I recommend it most highly, and personally you'd be a fool if you let this novel pass you by.
B00000I2MQ|2.0|I bought this while in (...) Spain thinking \\"bonus\\" meant the B sides (...) I think the \\"B sides\\" one didn't cost that much more. The extra track was \\"October,\\" a beautiful song but it doesn't make the CD a special find. It's also lacking great songs like \\"Two Hearts Beat as One\\" and \\"Out of Control.\\"
0345442989|4.0|The book started a little slow, but picked up pace. We learn from this novel, how suave Palpatine is. He plays several sides of the political arena, and as we know, to benefit his interests in the future. Poor Valorum does not have too many allies, mainly the Jedi. The book centers on the Trade Federation and the Nebula Front...and taxation on the outlying systems. The Nebula Front is a terrorist organization out to get Valorum, or so it seems and also to reduce the control of the Trade Federation on its trading routes. <br />The book is written like a good suspense/political novel, and set in the Star Wars universe. You can expect some action with the Jedi, as well as the terrorists, but mainly dialogue makes up this book, along with plenty of twists, especially a couple toward the end.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I did not notice anyone mentioning a minor, but nagging problem with the otherwise-wonderful DVD. The subtitling is awful! One of the joys of the DVD is the available commentary--one by Ebert, one by Peter Bogdanovich (sp?). When I listen to commentaries, I usually turn on the subtitling for the movie dialogue. In Kane, the subtitles are gross abbreviations with lots of missed dialogue, changed words etc.  Maybe I'm overly sensitive (or know the dialogue too well) but I found it incredibly distracting.<br />Other than that--great stuff.

0767802659|5.0|I loved this movie.  Especially on the big screen I felt as if in shock from the pure energy that this film emites.  I loved the book and was prepared to dislike the movie, but I though that they handled the transition well, even if many of the books key concepts (such as power suits) were cut.  It should be noted that the movie is a touch on the campy side.<br />This movie is EXTREMELY violent, and so if you dislike violent movies or are squeemish you should probably avoid this one.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Jeepers Creepers has to be one of the most scary films i've seen in my time on Planet earth. The people in it are alright however Jezebel(psychic gal!) is one tasty dish! Go buy it before the jeepers creepers guy has a fit! P.s its much better than Scream 1,2, and 3!
6305907145|1.0|This movie was untrue to the book in many ways.  First, the story line is quite different.  Second, the personality of Fanny (not to mention many of the other characters) is extraordinarily different.  While the book's Fanny was a moral stalwart; the movie makes her wild in a modern way that would have been totally innappropriate for the time.<br />Also, this move tries to move beyond the books storyline and into other issues.  For example, the eldest brother isn't bad due to laziness or irresponsibility, instead he is just rebelling against his fathers treatment of slaves.  Slavery is another area the film tries to address (in a historically inaacuarate way), but it is a poor forum for this - Amistad (which I consider to be a fantastic film) is the type of film where these issues are best put forth.<br />The magic of Jane Austen was that she was so good with interpersonal relationships, and in fact her works are so timeless because they focused on individuals and their actions and NOT the weighty issues of the day.  Evidence in this can be seen in how the Napoleonic wars are basically ignored in her writings with the exception of having soldiers around.  This movie tries to incorporate themes from beyond on the interpersonal relationship, which in turn just detracts from the plot.<br />There are people who will like this movie, but they will NOT be the people who liked the book.

B00003CXS4|5.0|You may not be a Brad Pitt fan.  That's okay!  You barely recognize him here.  The rest of the actors are not well known in American cinema, though almost all are famous in the UK (even if it isn't for their acting).  The movie is very similar in pacing and style to Guy Ritchie's earlier movie Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, but the characters and situations are just as funny and feel fresh.  I laughed so hard while watching this film, the twelve times I saw it.  Thoroughly enjoyable!
B00005LKIM|3.0|The only reason I watched this video was because it proported to have a different/better ending than the book. What I can say about Hannibal is the it is a well done movie for its genre. To be faithful to the book (which is the weakest of Harris' works) the movie depicts most of the violence and bloodshed, but Ridley Scott's direction spares the audience of most of this - working the scene the way it should be done: giving sufficient hints and gore to communicate what happened without making us watch it happen. Visual effects, blurred slow motion sequences and other techniques make the gore bearable. The exception is the final &quot;dinner&quot; scene that, while true to the book, is particularly disturbing and frankly without literary purpose. So there are two things to say about this work - it is spendid to watch, lovely and expertly crafted, but still unable to prop up the lacking story which in the end delivers nothing. Unlike Silence and Red Dragon there is no mystery to solve, no mcguffin, and we end the story with things just about the same. A mostly empty story that's pleasing to watch and with an ending that quenches the bitter after-taste of Harris' version.
B00005QJDG|5.0|Wow!  I need someone to help me off the floor every time I listen to this.  Amazing!  Dream Theater is definitely one of the greatest bands on the planet, and this proves it.  We have here three discs of great music, which includes ALL of &quot;Scenes from a Memory&quot;, several of DT's masterpieces, such as &quot;Metropolis Part 1&quot; and &quot;Change of Seasons&quot;, a song from Liquid Tension Experiment, and some amazing solos from Jordan and John.  The musicianship is perfect, and James LaBrie's vocals are even better than when they were originally recorded.  I don't have &quot;Once in a Livetime&quot;, because I don't really like live albums that much, but I may have to get it now.  If you buy one live album in your entire life, make it this one.  It's worth its weight in gold, and then some!

6304913176|2.0|Paul Verhoeven once again shows his incompetence as a director in this gory, tedious and all too predictable sci-fi yawn. The cast looks like something from Beverly Hills 90210 and their acting ability is equally bad. The characters are one-dimensional and boring. The only reason that I give this movie 2 stars is because it does hold some useful warnings against propaganda and glorification of war, which was also present in the Heinleins book. But as a whole I will not recomend this movie to anyone.
B00005OWIU|5.0|While not comparable with his monolithic &quot;Schindler's List&quot; composition, John Williams's &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; score makes much of his previous work seem cheap. Williams expresses successfully the slightly creepy, kooky and unreal world of Harry Potter while not losing any of the fantastic flavor. The careful listener can hear where Williams could take the theme to more dark and sinister variations should he choose to continue adapting for the coming six sequels.
0783242808|1.0|The success of this movie leave one wondering...It does show that it does not take a lot to entertain people. The story is about a bunch of teenagers wanting to get laid, and their embarrasing experiences. The movie is very vulgar and relies completely on vulgar humor to get by. The movie DOES have a point but it is sadly lost among the gimmicks and jokes. The movie is highly overrated, I think. I will say only giggling teenagers can find this funny(or people with an incredible juvenile sense of humor). If you think a guy having sex with a pie, a guy drinking a beer that includes manly fluids is funny then this is definately for you.
0743216385|5.0|This is probably the best WW II book I have read over the past ten years.  I recommend this to all those who want to read about a great group of soldiers who fought for our country.  I have past this book on to dozens of people.  Don't think the mini-series follows the book, there are a lot of important things that have been left out.  Without a doubt you will enjoy this book.
B000002UA9|3.0|The Beatles undoubtedly left an indellible mark on Rock N Roll music as we know it.  This release features some good Lennon/McCartney tunes but is loaded with many covers.  I Saw Her Standing There is a great song that still stands strong today.  What a great solo not to mention Paul's vocals.  Please Please Me and Do You Want To Know A Secret? are other standout originals.  However the other originals(where certainly very listenable) fall short of the Beatles best work on such releases as Rubber Soul, Yesterday And Today, Revolver, White Album, and Abbey Road.  Twist And Shout and Baby Its You are the best of the cover tunes. John really shines on those two numbers.<br />In general, this is a good but not great release.  Some interesting effects and rhythms make it stand out in spots especially when being comapred to other music of that year.  However, the Beatles would later develop their songwriting, harmonizing, and arrangement skills significantly for the better.
B00005N5S5|4.0|&quot;Wrong.&quot;  So goes the film that catapulted Arnold to stardom.  And this could still be his best role ever.  They took a pumped up Teutonic giant and cast him as a taciturn, expressionless killing machine.  Perfect.  Arnold must utter less than 100 words in this movie.  That's all he needs.  If you want a modern sci-fi/action classic, this is it.  Cameron would go on to prove he is a master of action with his next film, Aliens.  Plenty to go on about here, but if you haven't seen this film, and even if you don't like violent action films, give it a try.  Its energy can't be denied, and neither can the man in the wrap-around shades uttering, &quot;I'll be back&quot; and &quot;The Uzi 9mm&quot;.  Speaking of which, Dick Miller is brilliant in his brief role as the ill-fated gun shop owner.  Notice how he has no qualms about selling one of the most suspicious looking characters a veritable arsenal.  (Actually, The Terminator doesn't really pay for the guns).  Isn't America great?
B000002UD0|3.0|Walls And Bridges may not be on the same level as Imagine or the best material from Double Fantasy, but it certainly shows that John  Lennon was indeed a formidable artist.  Whatever Gets You Through The Night and Dream #9 are the most recognizable tunes in the lot.  However Nobody Knows You When Your Down And Out, What You Got, Suprise Surprise(Sweet Bird Of Paradise) and Bless You are strong album tracks.  John relies a little too much on horns and strings in the background.  It certainly would be nice if some of the songs relied on a bouncy piano solo(as in Crippled Inside from the Imagine CD) or some good guitar(Give Me Some Truth).  The instrumental support on Walls And Bridges adds some pleasant riffs here and there but doesn't really breakout into anything too memorable.  Also some of the lyrics are not as descriptive as on songs on other records.  The words from Imagine and Cold Turkey just seem to grab my attention a little bit more than some of these songs.  But in general they are all pretty good.<br />If you feel that John Lennon can do no wrong, pick this CD up.  Truthfully I would go with his earlier releases(Imagine especially) and possibly Double Fantasy that is if you can tolerate Yoko's songs.
B00000IIXH|4.0|This cd is just a glimpse at the tremendous box set released by Bruce, TRACKS.  These tracks seem to be more for the hardcore kinda Bruce fan.  Most are very energetic and I wonder why some didn't make the albums.  A great cd to get or Bruce's.  If your a first timer with Bruce, stick to Born in the USA or Born To Run.
0062502182|2.0|I found this book to be similiar to the Castaneda series or even Celestine Prophecy.  It is more simplistic than both (Yes, even more simplistic than the Celestine Prophecy), but I suppose if one needed a light read to remind you of what you already know, it might be worth picking up.
6302517036|4.0|Among the most impressive vampre films to be made and considered somewhat of a cult classic, Fright Night offers horror and humor.  The music and clothing are dated, and the teenagers offer the weakest performances.  It IS a teenage horror flick, I was 15 when this movie came out...but I love it now as I did then and there are so many strong points.  The script: excellent.  The performances: McDowell and Sarandon...wonderful.  The direction: again very good.  The music: dated but good.  Action: very good, especially the end.  Loopholes?  Yes, I can think of one but I'll leave the viewers to check it out...this movie is worth seeing!
6304080921|4.0|This movie was full of surprises and some really great acting.  My only complaint is with some of the science. Consider the scenes in 1990.  Kathryn had a deja vu of events that take place in 1996.  This leads us to believe that all time (1990, 1996, 2030, etc) occurs simultaneously. The movie also has the premise that events can not be changed (Cole says many times that the virus can't be prevented).  But, small events are changed.  For example, Cole causing bruises on a policeman and kills two bums.  Why is it not permissible for large events be changed (e.g., stopping the virus from being released)?  If the past was indeed set in concrete, then the only acceptable thing that Cole and the other time travelers could do would be to observe and not interact.  That is why I give this 4 stars instead of 5.  Otherwise, it was a great movie.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams' score to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Philosopher's Stone in Europe) is a marvellous, magical experience. The score centers around &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot;, but it is also full of other melodies and interesting ideas.  <br />And one cannot help but  love &quot;Harry's Wondrous World&quot;, a bouncy, fun  piece of music that is reminiscent of Williams' Hook score.<br />This music brilliantly captures the mood of the book (and also the film, I assume, but I haven't seen that yet) and it is often slightly sinister and dark, never becoming too &quot;cutesy&quot;. <br />This score, along with Williams' &quot;A.I.&quot; score, are both HIGHLY recommended. John Williams proves his genius and diversity once again.
B0000027I6|1.0|A REVIEW OF:<br />THE PROS AND CONS OF HITCHHIKING<br />RADIO K.A.O.S.<br />AMUSED TO DEATH<br />by Roger Waters<br />These three solo albums are important simply because they are the first, second, and third worst albums ever recorded.  It doesn't matter what order, they are all interchangable.  Roger Waters has shown us what horrible, unlistenable, pretentious garbage this medium called &quot;music&quot; can be turned into.  Truly, these are landmark recordings.
6301955293|5.0|In this nostalgic, atmospheric study of small town life in the fifties as seen a generation later, filmed on location in Wichita Falls and Archer City, Texas (from a novel by the incomparable Larry McMurtry), the force of slow, inevitable change is symbolized in the showing of the last picture at the local movie house. That last picture show, incidentally, is Howard Hawks' celebrated Western, Red River (1948) starring John Wayne and Montgomery Clift.<br />Well, the movie houses came back to life as multiplexes charging eight bucks a pop, but the Western movie died out, and the boys watching that movie went their separate ways into manhood.<br />Peter Bogdanovich's direction is episodic and leisurely, naturalistic with just a hint of the maudlin. We get a sense of the North Texas prairie wind blowing through a cattle town where there is not a lot to do and a whole lot of time to do it. Hungry women and a sense of drift. Boredom, gray skies and a lot of dust. You could set &quot;Anarene, Texas&quot; down any place in southwestern or midwestern America, circa 1951, and you wouldn't have to change much: a main drag, a Texaco gas station, a caf&eacute;, a feed store, flat lands all around, old pickup trucks and a pool hall, youngsters with a restless yearning to grow up, drinking beer out of brown bottles giggling and elbowing each other in the ribs, and the old boys playing dominoes and telling tales of bygone days.<br />Robert Surtees's stark, yet romantic black and white cinematography, captures well that bygone era. The wide shot of the bus pulling out, taking Duane off to the Korean War with Sonny watching, standing by the Texaco station with the missing letter in the sign, was a tableau in motion, a moment stopped in our minds.<br />Cybill Shepherd made her debut here as Jacy Farrow, a bored little rich girl playing at love and sexuality. Part of the restorations in the video not shown in theaters in the early seventies includes some footage of her in the buff after stripping on a diving board (!). Jacy is as shallow as she is pretty, and one of the reasons for seeing this film, although in truth Shepherd's performance, while engaging, was a little uneven.<br />The rest of the cast was outstanding, in particular Timothy Bottoms whose Sonny Crawford is warm and forgiving, sweet and innocent. Jeff Bridges's Duane Jackson is two-faced, wild and careless, self-centered and probably going to die in Korea. Ben Johnson and Cloris Leachman deservedly won Oscars as best supporting actors.

B0000025ZF|1.0|A REVIEW OF:<BR>THE PROS AND CONS OF HITCHHIKING<BR>RADIO K.A.O.S.<BR>AMUSED TO DEATH<BR>by Roger Waters<br />These three solo albums are important simply because they are the first, second, and third worst albums ever recorded. It doesn't matter what order, they are all interchangable. Roger Waters has shown us what horrible, unlistenable, pretentious garbage this medium called &quot;music&quot; can be turned into. Truly, these are landmark recordings.
B00005N9CV|1.0|So far Krall seems, at best, an imitation of Jazz vocalists from the 1960's.  This album is average if you are new to the genre, but as a somewhat experienced listener or as a novice who desires a little history and authenticity, you might want to look up artists from 1920 and on.  Krall has a somewhat unique style; however, I thought this album was too plain, too passionless, and too &quot;anglo-saxon&quot;.  For all who read this criticism, you should listen to Astrud Gilberto (and even Fiona Apple) before considering Diana Krall.
B000002B35|1.0|Okay, here's a test: grab disc one of \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" and disc one of \\"Pulse\\".  Have a friend shuffle them around behind his back and put them in a CD player.  Close your eyes and listen to track one off each disc.  I will personally give you $50 if you can tell which is which.  Want fifty more?  Play the last two tracks off disc two of each and tell me the difference.<br />I mean, DSOT was bad enough because every song sounds EXACTLY like the studio version (plus crowd noise), but this is going too far.  EIGHT of the songs here were on the last double live album, and no new changes have been made.  Apart from that, you get a bunch of (...) songs from \\"The Division Bell\\" (as opposed to a bunch of (...) songs from \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\"), a version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" that isn't as good as the studio and sounds just plain embarassing next to the unbelivable live cut on \\"Ummagumma\\", and, in a move that, to my mind, could only be a way to flesh this out into a double album and get more money, ALL OF \\"DARK SIDE OF THE MOON\\".  Okay, now do they honestly think that somebody is going to buy this live set if they don't already own DSOTM?  The chances are slim.  And the only difference is you get to hear about ten million people scream whenever the music gets quiet or lets up.  Didn't you always wonder what that record would sound like with a bunch of washed-up baby boomers on acid praising Floyd the whole way through?  Yeah, me niether.<br />Don't waste your money.  This is easily the worst album in the bands history (and that's saying a lot if you heard the three preceeding it) simply because it was obviously created for the sole purpose of exploiting every braindead Floyd fan who will buy anything bearing the band name.  There's nothing new here, and its a waste of money.  Plus, this was released six years ago, and those blinking lights have probably burned out.  Come on people.  Time to wake up.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Who is Guy Pierce? Did you catch him in \\"LA Confidential\\"? How about Carrie-Anne Moss from \\"Matrix\\" fame? Not to mention Joe Pantoliano (numerous co-star roles)... in my book, these are all names you know, but you might not be able to place a face at the snap of a finger. But, these 3 actors are all making a great name for themselves in Hollywood. All 3 delivery the goods in this backwards thriller. This widescreen 113 minute adventure starts at the end... and it leaves you guessing as to why it all happened. The story evolves around Leonard Shelby (Pierce) and his plight to find out who raped and killed his wife. He has a problem tho, he lives in the present (only). He has no long term memory. His only way of remembering things is to take notes, take pictures (with his Polaroid 690 camera), and tattoo himself with the unforgetable info. This film is just one of those amazing creations that you hear by word of mouth. I saw very little advertising and no trailers at the movie theater. You will want to see this movie 2 or 3 times and then you will realize the brilliance behind it. A modern classic (5 stars).
B00005OWIU|5.0|Yes, I admit it: I'm such a Harry Potter fan that I bought and listened to the soundtrack to &quot;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone&quot; before the film was even released. I knew that Harry's musical &quot;voice&quot; was in good hands: the score is composed and conducted by John Williams, a Hollywood legend with credits too long to list in a short review. Fear not, &quot;Harry&quot; fellow fans: Williams delivers a rousing score that successfully evokes the magic and excitement of J.K. Rowling's beloved novel (on which the film is based). This is a full, rich orchestral score that effectively uses choral voices on certain tracks.<br />The disc starts off on a compelling note with the &quot;Prologue,&quot; a fanciful, delicate theme with hints of magic and mystery. The prologue leads into &quot;Harry's Wondrous World,&quot; a big, sweeping theme that is rich in emotional texture, yet has fun, playful accents.<br />I liked the charming, sort of Celtic flavor of the opening of &quot;Diagon Alley....&quot; &quot;Platform Nine-and-Three-Quarters...&quot; makes good use of the chorus for a mystical effect. &quot;The Quidditch Match&quot; is, as might be expected, a spectacular action piece that you might find slightly reminiscent of the action music in Williams' score for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;<br />Another rousing selection is &quot;The Chess Game,&quot; whose energetic percussion reminded me somewhat of the action scenes in Jerry Goldmith's score for the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;; Williams effectively whips his instrumental elements into a controlled frenzy. The score turns rather ominous and scary with &quot;The Face of Voldemort,&quot; a section that evokes Harry's dreaded, powerful enemy. The CD ends strong with &quot;Hedwig's Theme&quot;: this is basically a reprise of the prologue music which builds up to an energetic finale. Overall, Williams' &quot;Potter&quot; score is a varied and enjoyable musical tapestry. Not only does the score hold up to the high standards of Williams previous work, but it also taps into the classic tradition of big, ambitious Hollywood orchestral scores.score hold up to the high standards of Williams previous work, but it also taps into the classic tradition of big, ambitious Hollywood orchestral scores.

B000002C25|2.0|Oasis had a formula. They liked it. It produced two very well-received albums for them, the first of which was good and the second of which perfected the formula and was wonderful. Then, of course the dilemma arrives. What to do next? And Oasis, somewhat understandably, opted to try and replicate the formula.<br />Now this is never a good idea. Oasis, because of their arrogant swagger, northern attitude and brash rock music, while being an excellent band, were always balanced precariously closely to dropping into self-parody. While they avoid this, they're wonderful. When they do, the result is bad. That is the story of Be Here Now. An attempt to replicate previous success drops into self-parody.<br />The lyrics, rather than being wonderfully obvious representations of the young working class generation, seemed forced in their attitude. This was probably because Oasis were less naive, and not technically working class anymore, meaning they needed to evolve, something they delayed until the following album, when their reputation was already destroyed.  <br />You see, Be Here Now must be viewed as the album that destroyed Oasis' reputation. Whilst most British people still like some Oasis anthems from the first two albums, their public image went from brilliant rock idols to soggy Northerners making copycat, soggy songs. Which was a shame, especially considering that it marred the public reception of the next, and considerably better, album, Standing on the Shoulders of Giants.<br />D'You Know What I Mean is a perfect example of their attempt to replicated themselves. Firstly, the title is a forced, working-class phrase to try and establish themselves as your mate down your local. Secondly, some of the lyrics are worryingly similar to those of 'Don't Look Back In Anger'. 'Look into the wall of my mind's eye, I think I know but I don't know why' says D'You Know What I Mean. 'Slip inside the eye of your mind, don't you know you mind find a better place to be' said Don'tLook Back In Anger.<br />There are, however, a couple of good tracks. Don't Go Away is a welcome change from the Sour Mash, an emotional ballad. Also, Stand By Me is the only genuinely great anthem on the album, where as the others are trying to be that way.<BR> <BR>You can understand how Oasis got into the situation they did, and on reflection it seems somewhat inevitable that they would someday make a Be Here Now. At least it forced change on them for the next album, showing them that they couldn't make the same music over and over again.
B00005OWIU|4.0|This score is very Hook-like, but unfortunately not in the same caliber as that score. <BR>However, it succeeds on a level that it's a book score, not a movie score for something that was always a movie.<BR>If that didn't make any sense, here's the lowdown:<BR>This is a great score!
B00005A46T|5.0|When I first heard Slipknot, I was not sure that I liked them so much. That was after listening to only one of their songs (wait &amp; bleed). Then I got their first album and was almost immediately an fan. Slipknot manage to mix rap &amp; metal to near perfection. Their new album Iowa is probaly THE best album that I have heard, period. I have met a few people who have been offended by some of the lyrics, all I have to say to them is F#ck you. If you can't handle slipknot then go listen to britney spears. And don't pretend that you like metal and then write bad reviews about this album. If you don't lick this album, then you never licked metal. Slipknot don't try to be like anyone. Slipknot are what they are, the best.

0780622545|3.0|Every night the Strangers stop time to edit reality. At the stroke of midnight, everything stops. Cars roll to a full stop in the streets, and the trains stand dead in their tracks. People faint, as if switched off. Then the Strangers rearrange them. They add and subtract from families, put up new buildings and tear down old ones, mix and exchange memories in order to find out what makes us tick, what makes us human. Then one day, a man named John Murdoch stayed awake at midnight and found out the truth.<br />You have to admit that &quot;Dark City&quot; has a great premise. Too bad it reveals everything in the prelude scene: the shot pans the starry sky while a solemn voice reveals every secret in the movie, which seems a bit self-defeating. There is one thing wrong with &quot;Dark City&quot;: it's too eager to please. Ideas spill out, and by the end of the first twenty minutes we realize that the movie has pulled all of its tricks and now has little to do but recycle itself, over and over, as it speeds towards the obligatory fire-and-brimstone special effects showdown. Somebody must have realized that the potency of a good cerebral thriller largely consists of its ability to tease, to keep the viewer constantly on edge, guessing. If the audience can guess the ending, the film is not only predictable - it has lost viewer interest and involvement. From that point on, only cheap tricks will work.<br />A part of the problem is that the Strangers are inadequate villains. The narration identifies them as cold and alien, but in the film they seem petty. I'd have imagined that nearly omnipotent beings would be vastly unfathomable. Less human. But, no, the Strangers can only &quot;tune&quot; reality when the plot requires them to.<br />The best and most entertaining aspect of &quot;Dark City&quot; is the art direction. The movie is filmed in dark, saturated pastels: here is the ominous, brooding city so many sci-fi flicks teased us with. Every texture, every crack in the yellowed plaster, every grain of slick asphalt, every strand of cobweb is tangible. The special effects, however, are less enthralling: the Strangers' underground halls seem to be exactly what they are - giant movie sets. The scene where buildings emerge from rubble seems to have been accomplished through claymation. &quot;Tuning&quot; is visually represented as a translucent blob of &quot;force&quot;, which is the standard way of visualizing psychic powers in sci-fi movies. In general, the uses of &quot;tuning&quot; seem inconsistent throughout the film: at first, both John and the Strangers use their powers to form &quot;invisible fists&quot; that toss people around and collapse floors. Later, the Strangers make doors appear where none existed and change the shapes of objects (they turn a small kitchen table into a gigantic dinner table complete with candle holders). Then John uses &quot;tuning&quot; to levitate several objects. At last, during the showdown, &quot;tuning&quot; is used to send laser beams and bolts of lighning around.<br />About the story I will say relatively little, in part because it hinges on acting (which is fairly good), and in part because there is very little to say. Much like &quot;Total Recall,&quot; this is a flashback movie, but on second viewing I didn't see the movie in a wholly new light. I did not feel imbued with secret knowledge. There are a few good ideas, such as John's recurring attempts to find his way to &quot;Shell Beach,&quot; a resort spot everyone seems to love but doesn't know the way to.<br />&quot;Dark City&quot; is a style-over-substance film that is too timid to descend into the macabre and the surrealist. Despite some great sets, it largely adheres to accepted conventions. This doesn't make it necessarily bad, just..... disappointing. If only it took its time, it'd be much better.

I was amazed at how this series helped illustrate everything I had pictured while reading Chaiken's book.  This is a phenomenal series and a wonderful complement to Andrew Chaiken's masterpiece.  I highly recommend the &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; minseries and &quot;A Man on the Moon&quot; to anyone interested in the spell-binding Apollo program.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|WOw...this is cd ROCKSSSSSS....I think Enrique is the best out of the 3 main male singers (him, Marc Anthony, and Ricky Martin).  He has so much soul when he sings. <BR>My favorite songs are Hero, Escape, Don't Turn Off the Lights, I will Survive and One Night Stand...Overall the cd rocks and I think it will have many singles.  You must have this cd for you collection!!!!
B000002UAU|4.0|After &quot;Revolver,&quot; the Beatles retired from public performance and penned two songs: 'Strawberry Fields Forever' and 'Penny Lane.' While neither song made it onto what was to become &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts' Club Band,&quot; they manifested the new direction the band would take.<br />The amount of time, money, and production that went into the making of this album was completely unprecedented. It has been called the first concept album, but as the Beatles' themeslves admitted, it failed as such.<br />However, the Beatles did manage to up the ante again here. The songwriting was still magical. 'A Day in the Life' was the high point of it all, absolutely one of the greatest songs the band ever recored. Inasmuch as this album is one of the most famous in history and a great achivement in its' own right, it is my opinion that the Beatles had begun to drift away from what made &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; and &quot;Revolver&quot; so perfected by simply trying a bit too hard. <br />The Beatles shot for the moon on this one, and they came very close.
1587990717|5.0|I normally dislike business books and approached this one with a slight diffidence. The title, nonetheless, seemed interesting. However, I soon became drawn into it and found its writer so brilliant as to become envious of his obvious ease at weaving excerpts of knoweldge acquired from many fields to produce such entertaining and insightful writing.  Apart from investing and finance the book really attempts to answer the question: are great men made by circumstances or are they born ?  I doubt this book will become a bestseller; it's simply too original and intellectual to attract the average minds that run business and finance. This book is about philosophy, science, psychology, history and literature as much as it is a useful guide to investment strategies - though I doubt Mr, Taleb would appreciate the last qualification. Those privileged enough to read it will share an amazing secret and advantage.<br />In short, I loved it.
B000002UDB|4.0|This is not so much an album as a collection of songs; six songs appeared in the film, and the rest were miscellaneous additions. Hence the magic of the Beatles, they filled in the album with gems. Songs like 'Strawberry Fields Forever,' 'Penny Lane,' and 'Hello, Goodbye' made the non-album side of the record even better than the soundtrack from the film.<br />However, this is not to suggest that the soundtrack side of &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; was shabby. Lennon contributed 'I am the Walrus,' and McCartney began to show that he was taking over creative control of the group with 'Fool on the Hill' amd 'Your Mother Should Know.'<br />The orchestral arrangements that made this album similar to &quot;Pepper&quot; were on their way out, however. The Beatles' next effort would be radically different.
B00005O3VC|2.0|This is, of course, one of the funniest movies ever made, and the new SE looks very good as well.  But the DVD has a major flaw.  Subtitles appear intermittently and cannot be removed.  Over 100 posters to the Home Theater Forum web site have already reported on this problem which seems mainly to appear with Toshiba and Sony players.   There is no apparent fix to the problem, which appears tied to one of the special features on the disc. <br />Columbia (which is owned by Sony!) should face the Spanish Inquisition for doing this to Python fans!
B000002UAO|5.0|These are the sounds of the Beatles transforming their music into something completely unprecedented. While Rubber Soul's predecessors each possessed wonderful moments, this was their first truly great album.<br />Besides the fact that this album contains some of the Beatles' best known songs, it also possesses some of Lennon and McCartney's most crafted work in their canon. 'In My Life,' 'I'm looking Through You,' and 'Norwegian Wood' are all examples of songs that broke the mold of what popular music was talking about at the time, 1965.<br />Although the Beatles would continue to stretch the bounds of their own creativity, this album was the beginning of their artistic zenith.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album ROCKS!!!  I love this album so much, I can't stop listening to it...I love how they have 2 vocalists - one that can really sing (and scream) and the other that raps.  It's a great combo.  Good album to blast in the car to get out your frustrations.  I just saw these guys in concert at the &quot;Family Values&quot; tour - they were so good on stage, waaaayyyy better than boring Staind.
B000002UAR|5.0|Whereupon &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; provided the pivotal turning point in the canon of the Beatles, &quot;Revolver&quot; was their greatest artistic triumph. Although the Beatles would continue to stretch the boundaries of the album, &quot;Revolver&quot; was their most perfected achievement.<br />From the opening sound of Harrison's guitar on 'Taxman' all the way through the one chord magic of Lennon's 'Tomorrow Never Knows', this album became the latest measuring stick for what was now possible for the genre. The songwriting was more equitably divided than on any other Beatles' album; Harrison notched three songs, and Lennon-McCartney penned the other eleven. (For comparison, Only one of Harrison's songs made it onto their next album, Sgt. Pepper).<br />Mccartney scored some of his greatest songwriting moments on this album, including 'Here, There, and Everywhere,' 'For No One,' and the timeless 'Eleanor Rigby.' Lennon contributed his usual wit through 'And your Bird Can Sing' and 'Dr. Robert.' In short, everything clicked on this album.<br />As any great album must, &quot;Revolver&quot; has withstood the test of time; but additionally, as all masterpieces must, it has defined its' time. It is, in my humble opinion, the single greatest album made to date.
0060922583|5.0|Great book!  I highly recommend it to any who's ever thought, Why are we here?  Whats the purpose of life?  Whats the meaning of life?  For me, this book help explain, NOT answer these questions.  Do not take everything he says so literally, but at the same time, do keep an open mind.
B000002UAX|5.0|While I understand the tempation to analyze this magnum opus song by song, we can best understand why this album works by understanding why others' have failed. History has taught us that most double albums do not work; it is a lot of information, and it just gets to be too much. This album is the exception; it could not possibly have been condensed as some have suggested.<br />After time off in India, the Beatles returned to Abbey Road to record a staggering variety of material. They rejected the lush arrangements of their previous arrangements, and rocked harder than on any of their other albums. Songs such as McCartney's 'Helter Skelter' paved the way for hard rock and metal. Lennon turned out some wonderful songs such as 'Sexy Sadie,' 'I'm So Tired' and 'Dear Prudence.' Harrison's songwriting was starting to blossom, as manifested by 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps.'<br />The four men who were the Beatles were more apparent on this album than any other one that they recored. They were all starting to change and grow apart; it was becoming clear now by the way the different songs sounded. There simply has not been an album since where each song sounds so creatively different from what preceded it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|OK, first I'm gonna be honest and say that I had this CD over a month before it's release because it was leaked on the net.  I HATED the cd at first.  I've followed Incubus since SCIENCE came out, and when I heard this what I now call a masterpiece, I was disgusted.  I thought, how the hell could such a great band produce such crap?  BUT, something told me to keep listening.  So I listened and listened and listened.  And after about 2 weeks, one day it clicked.  I LOVED the cd and I still do.  Every song is great, especially Circles, Have You Ever, Under My Umbrella, and Aqueous Transmission.  I notice that CDs that I end up loving and becoming classics to me are the ones that I despise initially. What I'm saying is to give the CD a chance, especially old-skool Incubus fans.  While I think SCIENCE and Enjoy Incubus are still their best, this CD is STRONG, TIGHT, CREATIVE, and HIGHLY ORIGINAL.  I'm looking forward to their long and prosperous career.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD is fabulous. Almost every song on here is amazing.  There is a lot of foul language and ideas here, so this is not for young kids (I probably heard this earlier than I should) or the weak of heart.  However, if you can take it, don't let the negative press keep you from enjoying one of the best rap albums ever.  The only songs I skip over when listening to this are 9 and 10.<br />The two stand out tracks on this are Stan and Kim.  Stan is an amazing song.  It does something that no other rap song has ever done: effectively tell a story.  Other rap songs have attempted to tell one, but have always included pointless stuff just so it sounds good.  This song sounds amazing, and is truly touching.  <br />Kim is the other standout track on here.  Many people think this is an awful track.  I am here to tell you it is not.  The emotion put into this song is truly amazing.  Rather than just yelling insults at his wife, he shows true emotion.  [The lyrics] show how emotionally scattered he is after finding his wife cheating on him with his brother.  It is obvious that he doesn't hate her, he is just enraged.  It is kind of hard to explain exactly what he puts into this song.  Just listen to it with an open mind, rather than assuming he is yelling nonsense, and you will understand what I mean.<br />Overall, this is probably my favorite CD ever.  Eminem is the most skilled rapper alive (RIP Tupac).  He delivers rhymes that you would never think of. \\"That's the sound of a bottle when you swallow it all, wallow and drown in your sorrow, and tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again.  What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend?\\"  And other lines like this.  (...)
6301442962|5.0|The &quot;dreams come true at Christmas&quot; (especially at Macy's...) premise of this film could have become syrupy sweet had it not had the brilliantly skillful handling that makes this a fun classic. Much of the dialogue (handled, of course, by top actors) is wryly hilarious. Scenes I particularly enjoy are the conversations between Kris and Alfred (&quot;make a buck, make a buck!&quot;), anyone's chats with the young but wise Susie, and the wonderful Bill Frawley's reminding a judge that, especially with elections forthcoming, declaring there is no Santa Claus could have devastating consequences. The scene of Kris's trial (where the &quot;allegedly mentally ill&quot; old man so clearly has far more good sense than those around him) is brilliant.<br />The acting is marvellous - no one, including Kris, is a caricature, other than the self-proclaimed &quot;psychiatrist&quot; who takes a swipe at Santa. The balance between &quot;playing the characters straight&quot; and actually quite sophisticated humour is extraordinary.<br />The key for the viewer, of course, is to remember that Kris indeed is Santa Claus. The setting, where two major department stores unwittingly end up fighting for a greater image of detached good will, is social commentary, albeit of a very different sort, which Dickens would envy.
0385334206|5.0|This book IS everything thats wrong with this world, and that is why it is so hilarious. It combines a perfect balance of sexual connotation with tasteless humor. Also, For those who are not attracted to that aspect of Vonnegut's writing, some of the character's phliosophies and ideas are simply mind blowing.<br />Bottom Line - Read this book!
630289915X|3.0|I suppose that, the first time one watches this rather excessively sweet film, even the most hardened cynic would shed a tear at the ending, when George is revealed as one who has a matchless wealth of friends and support. James Stewart indeed portrays George Bailey superbly, but I found that, beyond the first viewing, this becomes rather an annoying film.<br /><br />Of course, the contrast between George (the sort of man anyone would like on sight, and love all the more with acquaintance), and the dreadful Potter, who makes the pre-converted Ebenezer Scrooge look cuddly, provides much of the action - trouble is, the premise really is not that realistic. The idea that being good-natured, and having a spirit of self-sacrifice that goes from heroic to excessive, benefits one's community is taken to too great an extreme. The Baileys are always on verge of bankruptcy, yet manage to be the saviours of all of the rather poor people who want to fulfil the mid-century dream of owning their own homes. Intending no blasphemy, I found it annoying that George becomes something of a Christ figure... yet never is allowed to think of himself or his family in the process.<br /><br />George seems a wonderful man, but it became difficult to see his as a \\"wonderful life.\\" It seemed that everyone was entitled to fulfil their dreams except George... indeed, that he had to make certain that he sacrificed every aspiration (college, honeymoon trip, travelling) entirely so someone else could have them. Considering how, when George sees what the town would be like had he never lived, everyone is in miserable straits, the 'saviour' business is rather macabre, as are the people resident in Bedford Falls!<br /><br />Romantic though I am at heart, the cynical part of me sighed, knowing full well that, no matter how good anyone was to others, the first accusation of embezzlement would be more likely to make the others think, \\"now we know how he really is!\\" Miserable though Potter is, it does not ring true that one with his resources could be totally unsuccessful in acquiring potential homeowners as customers because a good-hearted, impoverished sort simply was more pleasant.<br /><br />Certainly, watch this once... but don't go back for repeated viewings, since the memory of the first viewing will be far more pleasant than the cloying effects of repeat performances.his resources could be totally unsuccessful in acquiring potential homeowners as customers because a good-hearted, impoverished sort simply was more pleasant.

B00004R9A4|1.0|My son and myself were bored witless by this movie. It drags on and on and on. The musical numbers are pointless and do nothing to advance the plot. The story is spotty and chaotic. After this I am very surprised they ever got Angela Lansbury to do Beauty &amp; the Beast. It must have taken her the full 15 or so years to recover from the embarrasment of being associated with this treacle.Don't waste your time and money.
0060930187|3.0|I read this book after I finished Ronald Hayman &quot;Death and Life of Sylvia Plath&quot;. Considering just how dramatic her life was (that ended in suicide), and how much she was such a melodramatic person (a scene between her husband and his mistress), I was a bit disappointed to find that this semi-autobiographical book isn't dramatic enough. She told the story in almost monotone, teenage, and detach way, even though at rare points she does become &quot;involved&quot;. I guess I was expecting to read a much more &quot;gut wrenching dramatic&quot; story telling considering that her actual life WAS like that.
B00005HXP9|4.0|This show is very good for any Scorpions fan. This time acoustic,<br />featuring a bonus track, Rhythm of love, very good.<br />Scorpions have also an other recent live album, playing with Berlim Philarmoniker Orchestra, which along with this one is a very good combination.<br />There are also very good versions of news songs like Hurricane 2001 (ok, I know this is a new version of Rock you like a hurricane) and oldies, like Holiday. Another spot from acoustica is &quot;Love of my Life&quot;, originally from Queen, loud and clear this time by Klaus Meine (Scorpions vocalist), very good and vibrating.<br />Indeed, nice show and CD.
B00005JCA9|5.0|it's just the ultimate romantic comedy. this one of the rare movies you can see again and again and again and again....
B000000W5L|5.0|exile on main street is a boozy, sprawling mess of an affair--one of their best!! no obvious hits here, except for tumbling dice and all down the line.<BR>the stones reaffirm their blues credentials here, giving credence to thier choice of group name, 'borrowed' from muddy waters as stones fans no doubt know!
6305499365|4.0|This is one of those movies that sneaks up on you.  I don't even remember it being released, but here we are 2 years later and it's on Comedy Central every 20 minutes and it's just something you have to have seen, because otherwise when you ask what someone does and they say &quot;oh, I have one of those Office Space jobs&quot; you won't know what they're talking about.  And they will say that.  I did enjoy the movie, don't get me wrong.  But watching it was more something I did because as a recent college graduate I just had to have seen it if I was going to be culturally literate.  Really, I should be able to quote from it, so I need to see it a couple more times.<br />There's kind of an early Kevin Smith feel to the whole thing.  Like, Clerks or Mallrats.  By that I mean the characterization isn't super deep and the acting isn't Oscar material, but they don't have to be because the dialogue and situations are on target.  Obviously I don't mean most of us are embezzling, but the set-up and the fantasy are realistic.  It's funny and close to a lot of people's lives, and it's kind of nice to see normalish lives in a movie.  Jennifer Aniston is good, as she generally is, but underused.  Maybe the other actors are underused, but since I haven't seen them in anything else, I couldn't know that.
B00000IQW3|4.0|If you liked Space Camp, or Short Circuit, then you will like The Last Star Fighter. I remember the first time I saw this movie, I got such a kick out of it. when I watch it now, I wish the space scenes where longer, but mabie that is why the movie is good, it leaves you wanting more.<br />A kid lives in a secluded trailer park and the only entertainment he has is a single video game at the entrance of the park called Star Fighter. When he breaks the high score, he gets a wild suprise, The game is actualy a test for Star Fighter Pilots. An alien comes and he is taken away on a journey to the far side of the gallaxy to become a Star Fighter in a war he knows nothing about. he chooses to not get involved, but when all the other star fighters are killed, he has to decide if he will help.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this on VHS two years ago and almost cried.  This story of a family's experience in the Holocaust shows what happens in concentration camps, and how three people lived before... and during it.  The first half is filled with comic relief.  The second half, however is much more serious.  Overall, it is paced well.<br />The lead Robert Benigni ingeniously portrays his character, a fast-thinking, outgoing and friendly man who dreams of owning a book store.  He meets his wife and all seems, well, beautiful... until he and their son are taken to concentration camps.  What he does for his son during their long time of imprisonment is what makes this film a sweet heart-wrencher.  Two thumbs up for brilliant story.
B00001SIES|4.0|'Showbiz' is an archetypical Muse album. Songs like 'Muscle Museum', 'Hate This &amp; I'll Love You', and most of all 'Escape' are symbolic for Muse's trademark: artistically prepared songs in which the chorus explodes in near-hard rock.<br />Though the album contains great songs - like the opener 'Sunburn' with its pearling piano and energetic chorus, the catchy 'Cave' which you will have a hard time NOT to be carried away by, and especially the simple yet nicely roaring 'Uno' with the distorted chorus and the flickering guitar - 'Showbiz' lacks REALLY great songs. And thus it does not come up to the level we are used to from this one of the truly greatest contemporary rock bands.<br />The Muse sound though, is intact. Enjoy the exploding 'Fillip', the mysterious title song, as well as 'Sober'. The latter is noisy, refreshlingly rocking, yet not that promising in the beginning... but with a certain charm which increases. And increases.<br />So, yes, it IS a worthwhile rock album. Slightly below Muse standard. But way above most contemporary rock band's standard...
B00005OWIU|5.0|the songs are very good for the movie it self, the charters in the movie have there own wands to do magic with. I would give this more than 5 star's but what eles can I say about the soundtrack that it ROCKS.

B00005ATQD|1.0|I think movie gives great insight to how a married relationship can be, I just think that some of the scenes, however symbolic they are, can be very inaccurate and inappropriate.<br />Tom Cruise plays the part of a devastated husband who found out that his wife \\"almost\\" had an affair with another man. When he finds out he takes the approach, rather than talk with his wife, we decides to try and give it right back to her by having an affair with another woman. Now some men might have that reaction and immediatley would go to that route, however it takes him to places where sex in meaningless, to the point where everyone wears masks to hide their identity. This may have proven symbolic to what Cruise's charecter was looking for, but not a very good stereotype/generalization.<br />The story is good, the plot completley unbelievable. That is why the rating is so low. Some say it's misunderstood, I think it was mis-represented.
B0000029DD|1.0|It seems like Jeff Buckley attempts to sound like a crossing between Elton John, Gary Moore, Montserrat Caballé and Muse, with a twist of progrock.<br />He does not succeed in any of those attempts.<br />His very little voice - whining and weeping, turning to distorted screaming during the refrains - is only partly compensated by the all but original acoustic guitar play, and only little more by the progrock inspired drums and electric guitars.<br />Therefore, Jeff Buckley is at his best when he doesn't sing.<br />But he does. So...<br />The only OK song on 'Grace' is the final 'Dream Brother'. And still, it is only OK, not exactly brilliant.
B000000H57|5.0|This is one of my top few favorite albums.  I have owned it for nearly six years now and the feelings conveyed are the same now as they were when it was new.  The first twenty or so times I listened to it, I was confused and perhaps ashamed of some of the lyrics, but not anymore.  The lyrics are without a doubt the best part of this music.  Steele's vocalization of his words is truly unique and exquisite.  I have rarely seen a songwriter who has so much to say and says it so well.  He does not play games with you or get stifled by himself.  I love this album because I assosicate it with so many raw emotions and experiences, and it never fails to take me back to places and times and people.  Track number eight chokes me up every time and I hate that.<br />The lyrics from Green Man read like Whitman and the melodies are many things at once.  Beautiful, naked, dark, intelligent, and haunting all describe them perfectly.  October Rust is as un-fluffy as anything can be and it has a lot of power.  I love this album.
B000059LGC|5.0|I love this movie.  I watched it in the theater years ago, got the VHS version, and now LOVE the DVD version.  I have 16x9 television and this is formatted in widescreen....Bette Davis, Angela Lansburry, Peter Ustinov, Jane Birkin, and Mia Farrow look in their best.  I highly recommend this DVD for murder mystery lovers and also for everyone.  Buy this one and you will love and enjoy this forever....
0871137380|5.0|If you are reading this review, you must be considering buying this book.  This book is a must read!  This is not only a great military book, but also one of the best books I have ever read, period!  Bowden captures the &quot;essence&quot; of the firefight spectacularly.  Let's just hope that Bruckheimer and Scott can do as well on the upcoming film.
B000050XEI|4.0|A DAY WITHOUT RAIN, Enya's latest masterpiece, although not as deep and pensive as previous releases (but also more relatable), evokes feelings of a day just like that - gentle sun, relaxation, and even a little introspection (what would an Enya cd be without that?). It's a change, especially with the addition of the most prevalent instrument on the album - strings. Never on an Enya album have strings played such an integral role, featured in almost every song. Quite a change, but a nice one at that. Especially, considering that Enya played them all herself.<br />A DAY WITHOUT RAIN opens with a title track as gentle and peaceful as any of Enya's prior instrumentals (also heavily based on the stunning title track to Watermark). This song segues into the &quot;pop&quot;-esque &quot;Wild Child.&quot; Love the melody, strings, Enya's voice, and the happy lyrics. &quot;Only Time,&quot; which has deservedly garnered quite a lot of attention lately reaching # 10 in America and # 1 in Germany, is a mix of gentle reflection and sublime poignancy. The various instruments and Roma Ryan's lyrics are a stunning addition to this piece. &quot;Tempus Vernum,&quot; the standard Latin track for A DAY WITHOUT RAIN, is a disappointing mediocre achievement, and signals where A DAY WITHOUT RAIN starts to go downhill a little. At two minutes, twenty-four seconds Tempus Vernum is simply too short and shows a lack of creativity on Enya's part. Tempus Vernum segues into the beautifully haunting and introspective Deora ar Mo Chroí sung in Gaelic, but is the only Gaelic selection on American pressings of A DAY WITHOUT RAIN and at 2:48, that's a very meager amount. Flora's Secret is our second full taste of the prominent instrument on A DAY WITHOUT RAIN-strings. Pizzicato synth strings, sensuality, a freshly light and airy feel, along with a sheer length of 4 minutes 6 seconds, combine to make Flora's Secret a real standout on A DAY WITHOUT RAIN. Fallen Embers merits a second re-play to reallycapture all of the emotion in what Enya has been quoted as saying is her favorite track on the album. Silver Inches is a strong grouping of various instruments that work as a cohesive whole, but at 1:36 total length it's far too short. One by One is my favorite song on this album; it's captivating, gentle, reflective, and has an intriguing Spanish flair. Lazy Days is joyous and relaxing, as well as a great song to exercise to.<br />However, not even the simple elegance and beauty of the packaging of the disc (including a theme of rain drops on jade colored slate, and a resplendent disc with Enya's logo in red on a background of seafoam green), can save the cd from scrutiny over the sheer brevity. Five years for just 34:20? And where's the &quot;bonus track&quot; practically every other pressing of A DAY WITHOUT RAIN around the globe, &quot;The First of Autumn,&quot; has? I hope that Enya's next creation, which will surely astound as this one does, doesn't take another half decade and is much longer than a glorious half hour.
B00004YX39|5.0|Gaucho, in the days when I had the tape version it was what I viscously forwarded past  to get to time out of mind but after listening to everything I could dig out of record shops going back to Soul Ram (Origins of Dan) this has become my true companion of everything that is Steely.  Full of nostalgia warmth and a high polish that perhaps only Kind of Blue by Miles Davis can project.
0446677450|5.0|I have 15 books on my bookshelf that are supposed to help me get rich.  While I feel confident that I am \\"on the road\\", this book gave me a swift kick in the butt!<br />The author uses a hard hitting, honest approach to getting rich.  He does not sugar coat anything, or give any hokey get rich quick schemes.  <br />He points out the difference in the way poor people and rich people allocate their resources.  Each dollar you receive is a choice.  The poor spend it on material.  The rich spend it on assets that will utlimately lead to passive income.  The most useful part of the book is that it points out the relationship between an individual's income statement AND balance sheet.  You will find yourself relating to all the examples in the book.<br />Many of his wealth examples have to do with his experience making millions in real estate.  The concept is the same.  If you want to get rich, you need to (1) not be an employee, (2) have your own business that spins off passive income, and (3) focus on the \\"asset\\" column in your financial statements.<br />This book has changed my way of thinking.  I am  more committed to thinking differently than the herd of sheep that are out there.  Instead of taking what life gives you, living paycheck to paycheck, and keeping up with the Joneses.....learn a new approach.  You will not be sorry!
0553106635|5.0|In what I've finally convinced myself to be a series to rival Lord of the Rings, A Song of Ice and Fire has slipped itself into my life, and it's all I can do to not read it all the time. I'm currently on Storm of Swords, and already I'm awaiting the release of Martin's next one. Fabulous read, whether you're a fan of fantasy or not, you grow to love, hate, or feel both for his characters. Extraordinary.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|Enrique has  given us some of the best pop songs in the past two years from the sultry Bailaomos to the upbeat Be With You. Even his latest Hero is a haunting, stunning ballad that is proving to be one of the hottest hits of the year. His new labum has all the making of a hit. Filled with romantic ballads, guitar driven pop tunes, and likeable dance tracks. Even giving us some spanish versions of three of his hits. Highlights include the funky I Will Survive and the title cut Escape. Hero is probably the best track on the album. That to me is disappointing. I am always hoping to find songs that I love just as much or even more than the first single. His first album was far superior. I do like thi album but it's missing those few tracks that made his debut so engaging. Vocally he sounds more confident which add some intensity to his voice. I was also upset that there are only 10 new tracks. Total 13 tracks but 3 of them are remade in Spanish. I do recommend this album.It is very good.
079213690X|5.0|The words of William Wallace (Mel Gibson) ring true throughout the three hour epic.  Braveheart is a story about a man with two horrifying experiances in his life due to the forces of the English laws over Scotland.  It is a grand story of a hero who leads a nation to its freedom. Although longer than the average film, it is never boring with horrific battles, classic love, classic heroism, and above all good triumphing over evil.  Along with the amazing plot there are also a lot of truths to the words of Wallace throughout the film. Anyone who wants to enjoy three hours of an incredible story worthy of its price should get this.
0679745203|5.0|While the English Patient explores a panoramic story line -  covering the deserts and bazaars, the ravages of World War II on  two continents, the languid days and haunted nights -  the real depth of this story are the love stories. The enigmatic Hungarian aristocrat Almasy and his immorata Katherine, a married English Ice Queen; the fragile and damaged nurse Hana and the shy reserved Indian army engineer Kip; Caravaggio the damaged thief and his love for women in general. Their tokens of affection, their whispered tributes, what they are willing to do and willing to forgo for their love - this is the true beauty of this book. This is a romance, but a grown up, beautiful romance that is delivered with some of the most haunting and evocative style in modern literature. If you are looking for story about love that avoids the graphic and the self-indulgent, the vulgar and the tacky, and instead inspires you with romance in the tradition of Tristan and Isolde alongside the pleasure of everyday treasures, please read this book, it is pure rapture.
B00005A1PR|4.0|India Arie is a great new artist. I've seen her perform her single &quot;Video&quot; and she does a great job with it. She is a good performer. The song is about girls accepting themselves how they are which is a good message. She radiates a really good vibe. She has a new song out now where she is singing with John Mellencamp - &quot;A Peaceful World&quot;. It's really great. This first CD from her is pretty raw. Hopefully she gets the money and interest from her label on her next CD to do something better. I really love her song &quot; Ready For Love&quot; but even that could be a lot better with a better production team behind her. It sounds very sparse on the CD but it's a great song.
B00005QHPQ|3.0|Enrique has a very distinct voice it trembles and verges from tenor to falsetto it worked great on his last album and should work on this one considering his voice is a great instrument but it's a huge letdown on this disc. The problem is the production on this cd. Enrique chose a whole new formula and tossed away the top notch producers from his last cd &quot;Enrique&quot;. Now he is in charge and the disc is very mutted and contrived and never reaches the heights his last disc has. Only &quot;Hero' brings the magic back while songs like &quot;Escape&quot; and &quot;Love To See You Cry&quot; sound dull! It will sell well but it shouldn't this disc has the same problems as Enrique's hair line-it's Failing him!
B0000009TT|5.0|Greetings.  As the subject mentions, I feel this is the perfect introduction to the world of Frank Zappa.  A little bit of his orchestral compositions, some amazing guitar work (heck, some amazing instrumental work all around), a healthy dose of sarcasm and irreverence, and that little &quot;something&quot; that made Frank's work so wonderful.  Some of my favorites include: the entire first disc, the gloriously overcooked rendition of &quot;Punky's Whips,&quot; &quot;The Purple Lagoon,&quot; the twenty-minute eccentricity of &quot;Greggery Peckary,&quot; and...well, the entire thing!  Don't let the price turn you off.  This album's the real deal.<br />Regarding the claim that Ryko screwed up the second disc track listing, this is most likely untrue.  There's been some debate, but I believe that Spencer Chrislu (or somebody else in the Zappa camp) claimed when he opened the box for the third record's master tapes, he found what went onto the CD.  Apparently, Frank either mislabeled the box or had another version of the album in mind at one point.  In any event, this is what Frank played on a radio station many years ago when Warner Bros. stopped its release, so I think it's safe to assume this is the &quot;ultimate&quot; version of the album.  Dig in!
B00003CXCQ|5.0|We already had the VHS version.  The DVD is stunning.  Our system is a progressive scan DVD and HD rear projection, and this DVD shows incredibly well.  The kids have been singing 'hi-ho' for days.
B00005JK93|4.0|...but Dr. Frankenfurter will always be my #1 tranvestite. *I just can't help but to compare the two*<br />With a plot like this, I had to see this movie for myself. It was wild and hilarious, but it had it's slow moments.  Hedwig puts on a great show and flash back to some of the goofiest dream sequences I've ever seen on film! It's a juicy mixture of Rocky Horror and Tommy. I recommend it highly for the rock opera enthusists.
0684853523|5.0|If you don't like Stephen King, then read no further.  It's not likely that anyone said here will convince you to read this book.  <br />If, however, you do appreciate that it's not just dumb luck or &quot;poor taste&quot; behind his success, then you owe it to yourself to get this book.  King offers some great anecdotes about how he got where he is today, as well as useful advice to upstart authors.  In addition, we get some candid insight into drug and alcohol addiction and how it destroys lives.<br />Want to learn how to (and not to) write?  Learn from one of the modern masters.
B00003CY0V|3.0|I love it when Travolta plays a villian, especially a stylish one!  And this was a stylish movie fit just for him!  I also fell in love with Hugh Jackman in this one.  He reminds me so much of a young Mel Gibson.  Don Cheadle never gives a bad performance but if you want to watch Cheadle at his best, rent &quot;Devil in a Blue Dress&quot;. I couldn't believe he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for that one. <BR>Ummmm...All I can say about Halle Berry in Swordfish is that it was odvious that she was NOT who the casting directors initially had in mind for her part.  She really didn't fit into her role. It was like watching an adolecent girl trying to convince someone that she's &quot;mature&quot;.  <BR>Swordfish is nothing new to us action and suspense junkies and it's no &quot;Usual Suspects&quot;, but it's nice to see all those stunts, those chases, and the sick &quot;Matrix&quot; camera angles during that bomb scene at the beginning! To sum it all up, it's worth a look.
B00003W8NM|5.0|I loved Fight Club the first time around. I was mesmerized by the visuals, the story, the mystery, the fine acting and the surprise at the end.<br />Now I want to seeit again, becasue I think it says something about the destruction of society that may not be far from what the suicide bombers were thinking.<br />This movie might just get inside that type of head a little bit and give us some understanding at least, if not solutions.<br />See it, if you haven't. And if you have, see it again.
B0000029GA|5.0|I love this album! I just bought it again (for the third time) because as soon as someone finds out that I own it...&quot;I'm Jacked&quot; for it. Disregard all his other albums. This is Nas when he was Nasty Nas. This is classic material. My Favorites: &quot;The World is yours&quot;, &quot;One Love&quot;, &quot;It Ain't hard to Tell&quot;, and &quot;Half Time&quot;
B000002I53|5.0|Mr. John Coltrane had(still has) the unique ability to disrupt any previous concept you may ever had about bebop, and inmediately make you an addict of his rich, polimorphic, sensuous sound. &quot;My favourite things&quot; is an easy listening record, with inmortal tunes that are remembered every now and then(ever heard Bjrk's version in &quot;Dancer in the dark&quot;?) and give you the insight of a deeply spiritual man who was in pursuit of his way of expressing love through music. This is not his most emblematic record but definitely a good one.
0553573403|5.0|If you're one to shy away from fantasy because of overplayed fairies and dragons, A Game of Thrones will hook you in and whisk you away to an epic world of great medieval houses, treachery, and intrigue with only a good dash of mysticism. Martin's succinct style, thankfully devoid of pedantry, works to showcase his talent in weaving a large cast of characters interposing several knuckle-gripping plot lines.<br />This is a land of decade long seasons where spooks roam beyond The Wall and dragons are believed to be long extinct. Scenes blink back and forth as kings, princes, bastards, and wives shuffle and plot to win or maintain the throne of the Seven Kingdoms. The somewhat shrouded death of the Hand of the King leads his successor, Ned Stark to question the Lannisters (those wretched inlaws) of treachery. The last of the the previously overthrown Targaryens who barely escaped the slaughter of their family, enlist an army across the sea and struggle back to regain the throne.<br />In regards to all the complaints about rape, violence, and swearing in this book. ** NEWSFLASH ** Such heinous acts do exist in this world (especially in medeival times) and Martin unabashedly does a tasteful and respectful job of displaying the uglier side of humanity in all its forms.<br />You'll be left on a cliffhanger in every character-titled chapter, not to mention each book so its not recommended for easily exasperated readers. Even so, this first installment does have an appropriate ending with a beautiful denouement in which ... well - no spoilers. A Game of Thrones does stand on its own, but of course, with such talented craft, why stop here?<br />This is more War of the Roses, than Lord of the Rings. Though like LOTR, the fantasy element only augments the lyrical beauty of the stage through which the you will see the futility of honor, true power rise from frailty of innocence, and not all heroes are handsome and good. The lines of good/evil will blur and you'll come to love/hate Starks and Lannisters with equal passion.<br />Strong points: Tyrion Lannister, the Dothraki, the direwolves, Arya Stark, Daenrys Targaryen, winter is coming.<br />Weak points: Jon Snow's story, The Others, Bran Stark, good guysate Starks and Lannisters with equal passion. <br />Strong points: Tyrion Lannister, the Dothraki, the direwolves, Arya Stark, Daenrys Targaryen, winter is coming.<BR>Weak points: Jon Snow's story, The Others, Bran Stark, good guys
B00005QCYC|5.0|I pre-ordered this item right after I heard it was coming out!<BR>I love the Jurassic Park movies! I grew up with the first one and it totally changed the way I looked at movies! The Lost World was ok, but not as fun and exciting as the first one. And then, when I heard that Jurassic Park III was coming out, I was soooo excited, and you know what? I LOVED IT. It was great to sit in the cinema, hearing John Williams' great music for the first Jurassic Park movie again(which sadly didn't play much in The Lost World). It was also great to have Sam Neill and Laura Dern back! The 4th bonus disc also looks sweet!<br />(...)<BR> <BR>  <br />All in all, this looks like it's gonna be a great box-set!
B00005N83M|5.0|This cd is so great!  I cannot stop listening to it.  It has just the right mix of pop and Latin style on it!!  The best tracks are, &quot;Love Don't Cost A Thing&quot;, &quot;I'm Real&quot; (both versions), &quot;Play&quot;, and &quot;Ain't It Funny&quot;.  All of the tracks are excellent!  Even the spanish songs have a nice beat.  I highly recommend this cd!
B00004TR2G|5.0|John Towner Williams!<br />It was after Williams did Jaws that he really got famous when in the movie scoring buisness. Before Jaws, he had been composing music for TV shows and news broadcasts, but that was not to last long. ;)<br />Williams' score for Jaws is truly fantastic. It's hard to explain how good it is, but in my opinion, it gives Superman: The Movie and Star Wars some hard competition! The tracks are filled with great action, drama, happy and sad music. The music that plays when Quint, Brody and Hooper are following the shark at sea, using barrels to hold him up, is my, and hopefully many others favorite musical moment in Jaws.<br />The Main Theme is also a very classic piece of music. If you ask a friend or just some stranger which film this music is from, and you go like this: dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum dum di dum dum dum di dum dum, I'm almost positive he's gonna say Jaws. The music for the main theme has been used in many other horror creature films. Mostly shark movies, though. It fits perfectly into the film. Spielberg thought Williams was joking when he played the main theme for him, but he kinda got used to it after a while. I'm glad he did and so are many others!<br />Jaws is a brilliant soundtrack filled with music that will keep you entertained for hours. Go buy this soundtrack now and discover what a great movie composer John Williams is!
6302517036|5.0|I am 19 years old. I first saw this movie when I was three years old and I loved it. I have owned this movie since 85. If you are like me there is nothing like a good Vampire movie. This one will certainly get your attention from begining to end. Sarrondon is excellent in the movie. It has pretty good effects for the 80's. The storyline- The Vampire goes after Charlies girlfriend Amy. Who looks just like a lover he had a long time ago. Charlie wanting to prove to his friends that his next door neighbor is a vampire gets &quot;The Great Vampire Killer&quot; Peter Vincent to prove that he is one. ok I have told you enough..now go buy the movie and see what happens!
B00005OWIU|5.0|Every bit the embodiment of the wonder and amazement the books envoke, the music on this album is superb.  Having read the books, I can see the music matching the scene for which it was written.  John Williams has done an excellent job of capturing the &quot;feeling&quot; of the scenes in his music.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|Thank you Enrique!  I just found an album that I actually like more songs on it than the one I bought it for.  \\"Hero\\" is an exceptional song that pulls at my heart stings. So deep..so meaningful..sure to be used by Newlyweds all around!<BR>And I just love \\"I will Survive\\"...it makes me wiggle in my seat as I am driving to work.  Very upbeat..cheery...and sexy!!<BR>I have been a long time fan, and will continue to my support!!
0783226160|4.0|Released in 1978, this film remains one of the funniest movies ever produced. It rivals the comedy of Mel Brooks. Set in the late 1960's the film takes an exaggerated look at college life. John &quot;Bluto&quot; Blutarsky played by John Belushi is a member of the Delta House fraternity. His antics are a reminder of what can happen when one spends more time partying than studying. His GPA hovers around the 0.1 mark and this is what makes him lovable. The dean of the college, Vernon Wormer (John Vernon) does his best to rid the college of the useless Delta House fraternity. As his plan to dissolve the fraternity begins to take shape, the members of Delta House take exception and hatch a plan of their own. This is where Belushi utters the most memorable line of the movie, &quot;Did we give up when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?&quot;<BR>This is a must see movie for anyone who experienced fraternity life especially in the late 60's or early 70's. The sound track is an excellent vehicle to return the viewer to times gone by.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is a really great CD, and I love John Williams, but as far as I can tell, this can't be bought on an audio cassette, so I guess I'll have to do without.  All of you with CD Players, though, BUY THIS CD!  Buy it now or Voldemort will steam off your eyebrows.
B00004Z459|4.0|I think this is a pretty good cd.<BR>Bad things are the rapper and the lyrics.<BR>Good things are the melodies in the songs, and the singer.  He has a good voice.<br />Overall they are not as good as Deftones and Tool, but they are worth checking out.  If you like the rock aspects of this album and want better lyrics get Deftones and Tool
B000000HHE|5.0|This album is a must have for anyone into the hip-hop genre.  This is the perfect CD.  Think of all of the flaws shown in hip-hop: major egos, commercial lyrics, and negativity.  But this is an ego-less, positive, and non-commercial masterpiece.  The CD starts out as a game show, then goes on to &quot;The Magic Number&quot;.  And it only gets better from there.  The lyricism is purely amazing.  Prince Pauls production is pure genius.  This CD is a must.  If you don't have this CD, go buy it ASAP.

B00005K3OT|5.0|I always like movies with a philosophical message that are also good drama and \\"Chocolat\\" falls into that category.  <BR>     Juliet Binoche moves into a very religious, self denying French town and sets up a Chocolate shop.  She has a knack for knowing that special chocolate treat that will make a person's mouth water and bring a smile to their face.  And she is committed to helping people in this town to enjoy themselves more.  Johnny Depp plays her bad boy love interest.  <BR>     I had to rent this movie when I found out that Leonard Peikoff, the prominent Objectivist (Ayn Rand) philosopher praised the movie as \\"the best movie I've seen in decades\\" (Ayn Rand Bookstore Catologue, Fall 2001).  I personally like the movies philosophic message and I was engrossed watching it but it seemed a bit formulaic to me in that it was fairly predictable and there were no real fireworks, at least for me.  Peikoff is going to love it because it is an attack on Christianity, or certain aspects or interpretations of Christianity, but Christianity has been attacked plenty so it's not like this is an original and unprecedented critique.  <BR>     I would definitly recommend the movie though it needed a little more \\"boo yah\\" for me to say that it's a must see or one of my all time favorites.<BR>

Vanessa Williams is stunningly beautiful in this movie and it is worth watching just to see her in her outfits, dancing, smiling, standing tall proud and beautiful.  <BR>     Beyond that, it's just good, old fashioned romancing.  Chayanne is from Cuba, the guy is super positive, a great dancer, a can-do guy.  Williams is a beautiful but jaded dance pro who teaches dance to support herself.  Chayanne courts her, they fall in love, but she has issues that make it unclear how things are going to work out (see movie to find out :)<BR>     It is the kind of movie that I would want to watch again, not so much for the plot, but just for those moments of sexual tension and energy between Chayanne and Vanessa Williams.  I loved Chayanne, he is a can do guy in this movie, like I said, and Vanessa Williams just sizzles; the inner beauty of the woman just comes through loud and clear and I can't help but love and pine for her.

0451191153|5.0|You can tell what I thought of this book by how many stars I gave it. So this review is written more to the people who gave it one star. It seems to me that the people who don't like this book need to reread it and pay attention to the characters such as Toohey and Keating and see if perhaps they relate to these people. To say this book can get boring is a fair statement. Any book that's 700+ pages gets boring in places. To say it's evil is plain stupidity. The people who despise this book and Rand's ideas are scary, to say the least. Altruism is a very scary thing. This book is great because it conveys the virtue of being yourself. It's not about one man rebelling against society. If you read it, you'd notice that he doesn't care about society enough to rebel. It's about society's desire to crush greatness because the public knows that it's something that they cannot reach. This is truely a great book, as are all of her books.

074322454X|5.0|I liked the HBO miniseries based on this book, Band of Brothers thats why I choose this book to read for my reading book in English. Band of Brothers is an entertaining and worthwhile read. The author Stephen Ambrose writes of personal accounts from the paratroopers of E Company into a gripping story of the war in the European theater. Ambrose's writing style is very easy to read, and he does a very good job of individualizing the huge cast of characters, and he sets his story within the context of the greater conflict.<BR> All of these factors makes the book essential reading for prople like me who watched the HBO miniseries. The miniseries is great movie, but the the miniseries doesnt cover close to as much detail as Ambrose does in the book. Reading the after watching  the miniseries, helped me in understanding the characters better and it helped me understand what was happening better. Also, the book gives you a better understanding of why certain objectives were so critical to the war. I thought that reading the book enhanced the experience of watching the miniseries.
B00003CY0V|2.0|I can't understand why people think John Travolta is such an amazing actor. His last 3 films (including Swordfish), have been total nonsense. Hugh Jackman is an incredible acting talent from Down Under. I would like to see him flex his acting muscle and get out of these \\"Action\\" and \\"Romance Comedy\\" roles. There is alot of potential there and I hope to see more of him. Halle Berry is always nice to look at, but she has some natural talent behind it. Whether or not she is bare breasted is an  irrelevant fact of the movie. The plot of this film is far too twisted and complicated to care about for 1.5 hours, and by the time the credits roll you are just thankful that it is over. Visual technology has gotten so advanced that it is difficult to beleive anything that is going on. If the film was set in another realm or universe that would be fine, but it is in L.A. I'll never understand why 8 people with machine guns can't shoot 1 person? No realism in this film what so ever. See it for Hugh and Halle. Not for plot or Travolta.
B00000JXAK|3.0|Those who love Fairport Convention's &quot;Leige and Leif&quot; album, as I do, may want to check this one out.  Trees recorded 2 albums of British folk rock in 1970.  This is the second album, the first being &quot;The Garden of Jane Delawney&quot;.  They come across here as a kind of second tier Sandy Denny era Fairport Convention, complete with a female vocalist (but no fiddle).  The guitar playing is quite good.  A couple tracks drag on too long and become monotonous, but there is much that is worthwhile.  Obvious highlights include the tracks &quot;Soldiers Three&quot;, &quot;Murdoch&quot;, and &quot;Sally Free and Easy&quot;, which features an extended, atmospheric arangement reminiscent of Fairport's version of &quot;A Sailor's Life&quot;.
6305313687|5.0|Why was this never at theaters? Its amazing how a movie as astonishing as this one was never on the big screen.<br />Edward Norton is incredible. I never knew who he was until I seen this movie. The casting was impressive also.<br />The script was puzzling but yet catchy. I couldn't take my eyes away from the screen from the beginning until the end. <br />My friend is the one who introduced me to this classic. We rented it, he had already seen it, and I am a tough critic so I thought it would probably be some bs movie. Damn was I wrong. You can learn so much from just watching it.<br />After I seen it, and seen the ending, I was shocked, amazed, and moved. This movie has a strong message and in my opinion should be seen by anyone in high school. This should be a part of a curriculum in certain classes in high school.<br />What makes this classic so great is the fact it is close to reality. You can actually relate this movie to real life events. Not too many serious drama based movies can do that.<br />I have to give this movie 5 stars plus for the overall casting, story-line, and the brillant acting by some of the characters. If you haven't seen this and are thinking about getting this hot item, then I would have to say get it. Trust me its worth the money.<br />I have seen this movie I know 10 times, and I still don't own it LOL. I keep renting it every once inawhile when I want one of my boys to see it. (boys = friends)<br />GET IT!

B000005Z0E|4.0|This is the Tupac that was out before the money changed him. This is real hip-hop, and coming from the west coast back then, is pretty amazing.<br />I am not really a huge Tupac fan, but this album is just beyond incredible. I wish you could give a 4.5 rating. I would have given it 5, but you have to have a classic of all classics to have that many coming from the tough hip-hop critic I am.<br />The reason this is Tupac's best album is because he doesn't have money, hos, cars, related subject matter. Just pure simple real life in ya face hip-hop. <br />The modern day Tupac fans wont feel this album, becaue its on a totally different level compared to his other releases. If it wasn't for this album, I wouldn't have any respect for Tupac as a rapper. That is what Tupac is a rapper. Probably the best rapper there is. There is a different in an emcee and a rapper. Tupac is a rapper, Krs is an emcee. There is a differene. That is why I rated Tupac the best rapper. I don't like rappers. Rappers destroy hip-hop, but Tupac was real, a real rapper who kept sh%t real. I have to respect him for that. <br />The best tracks include: <br />&quot;Trapped&quot; &quot;Soulja Story&quot; &quot;Violent&quot; &quot;Brendas Got A Baby&quot; and &quot;Rebel of the Underground.&quot;<br />If you are a deep hip-hop head and you label Pac as commercial rap material, I feel you, but this album is different. If you like the modern day Tupac before he died, then you probably wont feel this one.
B00005NB0H|5.0|\\"Live At Leeds\\" is the immortal live album by The Who, recorded at Leeds University on February 14, 1970, and it still remains the most important live document of this legendary band, showing for all the world to hear just how monstrous Pete Townshend, Roger Daltrey, John Entwistle & Keith Moon could be live in concert in their 1969-1970 heyday. It's a ferocious, wallpaper-shredding performance that gives the listener a truly special \\"You Are There\\" experience, and it perfectly captures the band at the peak of their live powers, playing each number with a fiery intensity as if their lives depended on it. (The album also features some very funny inbetween-song banter as well, primarily from Townshend and Moon, which only adds even more value to this already superb live recording.) The \\"Live At Leeds\\" album had been brilliantly expanded once before in 1995, but was still incomplete with the ommission of the band's performance of \\"Tommy\\" that night, apart from the \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" extract. But now, finally, 31 years after it's original release, this Deluxe Edition of \\"Live At Leeds,\\" now including the \\"Tommy\\" performance, restores this landmark Who concert to it's virtual entirety. I say virtual because the \\"Spoonful\\" segment of \\"Shakin' All Over\\" has NOT been restored for some reason (reportedly due to Townshend's dissatisfaction with the band's rendition of it that night, if such a thing is actually possible). But everything else from the show is now here at last, for which Who fans all over the world can be very grateful.Listening to the band's slightly-abridged live version of \\"Tommy\\" here (minus \\"Cousin Kevin,\\" \\"Underture\\" and \\"Welcome,\\" and with a few songs shuffled around in different order), it goes without saying that it's just as thunderous and brilliantly performed as the rest of the band's set that historical night at Leeds University. However, one wishes that \\"Tommy\\" had been left in the correct performance order on this Deluxe Edition---as the liner notes reveal, \\"Tommy\\" came between \\"A Quick One While He's Away\\" and Summertime Blues,\\" but for this special 2-CD set, \\"Tommy\\" has been snipped from the performance on CD One and given it's own showcase on CD Two. But this is an extremely minor quibble. I'm just happy to have the live Leeds \\"Tommy\\" at all, finally alongside with the rest of the band's magnificent performance at last.The surviving members of The Who, now in their fifties, toured the U.S. during the summer of 2000, and although I would've loved to have seen them, I simply wasn't willing to fork out [amt] a pop for the best seats. With this outstanding Deluxe Edition of \\"Live At Leeds\\", a one-time fee of approx. [amt] gets you the greatest live recording of the band in their prime that has ever been made, AND when Keith Moon was still alive & bashing away behind the drumkit for them, yours to enjoy for all eternity. THAT, my friends, is truly a bargain. :-)
B000003BD3|3.0|I don't know who was backing her or who arranged it, but Marianne Faithful's song is absolutely killer...I couldn't disagree more with those who say it is weak. Great lyrics, melody, slide guitar...i got this for Taj, Who and Tull, but Marianne blows them all away.
B000002H5I|5.0|In my opinion their has never been a better album than this one. The fact that it's not a greatest hits type cd, yet every song is a classic is amazing.  This is the only CD that I've ever bought that I can honestly listen to all the way through without skipping a single song.  Unfortunately, Tracy has never been able to match the perfection of her first album.  Just the same she is a true genious and she wrote every single song on this CD herself.  This CD is a must, it combines pop, soul, and contemporary folk to create a truly beautiful masterpiece!
078322687X|1.0|They couldn't even manage a Stereo release? Save your money until they come out with a worth while product. The movie has a lot of good songs and some great background soundtrack music, in mono it would sound worse that the butchered version they play on basic cable.
6302517036|5.0|&quot;Fright Night&quot; is a very fun, frightening tale about a boy, Charlie Brewster, played by William Ragsdale.<br /> (Remember, Herman's Head on Fox?)  His girlfriend, Amy, who he has been pressuring into having sex, is played by Amanda Bearse, who is probably best known as the annoying neighbor, Marcy, from Married with Children.  Suddenly Charlie is more interested in learning who his new neighbor is and not so interested in Amy.<br />Stephen Geoffreys plays Evil Ed, with his annoying voice and his nerdy looks, he pretty much steals alot of the show with his antics.<br />My favorite in this movie has to be Chris Sarandon, who plays Jerry Dandridge. He is the vampire, and he is very sexy.  A perfect choice for the role.  I also thought Roddy MacDowell was very good as the fearless vampire killer, in movies, but when it comes to real life he doesn't seem to have much faith.<br />The story unravels as Charlie learns that Jerry is in fact and vampire.  He is trying to convince his friends that there is a vampire living next door.  and Roddy Macdowell enters when the friends are trying to convince Charlie that vampires don't exist.<br />This movie works for me..it's fun to watch, and the special effects are decent.  The acting is by far much better than it is in most horror movies.<br />If you like vampire movies and a bit of comedy mixed in, this is a good choice.
B00003CXIP|5.0|(...)<BR>Stand by me is the best movie anyone has probably ever seen! It gives you great laughs man, and some tears. This movie had changed my life man! It showed me that I am not alone, nobody is. Corey Feldman was great, he's my favorite 80's actor. He played in some pretty good movies. River Phoenuix was breathtaking, it sucks that he is dead now. Will Wheaton will give you tears. Jerry o\\" Connell, well he was pretty good, a big sissy though.

I am on my third copy of this and all three do the same thing at the menu screen when the columbia logo comes up the colors and everything goes crazy it become jambuled and distorted. This is very agaravating and have tried it three times and now am just going to thorw it in the garbarge because all the store will do is give me another and it will do the same thing im sure. Columbia tristar needs to recall this and get a new batch. By the way the player am playing it on is a panosonic a150. so please if you buy know you are probbally going to have to chunk it.The movie is actaully pretty good although not as good as pulp fiction like other reveiwers have been saying. Please at least give us qaulity dvds that will play. I buy so many and this has never happened so maybe it wont again.The disc also sometimes will come up and say this is not competiable try another disc. This is a peice of junk.

0393317552|1.0|Such an interesting opening question - &quot;Why do white people have all the cargo?&quot; and such a disappointing result. Diamond says early on that he intends to creat a non-racist explanation for European dominance, constructs a series of variables (see above reviews) required for success, isolates three or four places in the world where these variablies intersect, and then proceeds to find reasons why only the Europeans could have succeeded. My favorite naked cop-out: China could not develop an advance society because its coastline is smooth, see, and so dissenters had no place to hide from a centralized government that suppressed innovation.(Um, why?)  Europe's coastline, by contrast, is crinkly. Bettcha didn't know that!
079213690X|5.0|In this movie Mel Gibson plays William Wallace, a Scottish commoner who becomes a hero fighting against the English rule of the Scots.  This movie has a great story behind it and won many awards.  It is a very long movie (almost 3 hours) but there is never a dull moment.  Braveheart is an action movie that also includes a love story.  This movie appeals to most audiences and is known as one of the best movies ever.
0393316041|5.0|Richard Feynman is one of those rare breed of human beings whose gift of insightful intellectualism is matched by an equally remarkable sense of humor. This book takes us from his childhood to his professorship days at Caltech, at each turn giving us an honest, down-to-earth, and witty narritive of his &quot;adventures&quot; in life. From his time as a researcher in Los Alamos breaking into safes for convenience to reviewing books with empty pages, you can't help but feel that every day is an adventure for Feynman. Along the way we also get glimpses of his life as a physicist, his random hobbies, and many other aspects of his remarkable personality.<br />This is an excellent read for all, and no knowledge of physics is a prerequisite. Feynman is a very talented lecturer and you might even pick up a thing or two about physics along the way as you read this book. The most important lesson from his stories is that there are always interesting and rewarding things in our every day lives, if only we are sufficiently open minded and critical to observe them!

B00005OAIE|5.0|I was going through a local music store and heard this one playing over their system.  I have to admit the first time I heard it, I casually thought it was DMB.  Then as I paid closer attention, I found that it was something a little different.  If you like a smooth blend of electiric and acoustic guitar work, you should like this.  He has a unique overall sound and I think that it is refreshing at times.  If you are looking for something a little differnt to add to your collection, this is definitely worth the (money).  One of the better CD's that I have purchased on a whim.

B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis' Kind Of Blue is a landmark album, introducing a style known as cool jazz.  It is easy to see where the name comes from as the songs have an icy air of coolness to them.  &quot;So What&quot; is an utter masterpiece and contains the amazing dual sax work of two legends in their own right, John Coltrane &amp; Cannonball Adderly.  As good as those two gentlemen are, it is Mr. Davis' album and he is in clear command on that track and on &quot;Freddy The Freeloader&quot; he has a laid back, yet forceful sound that shows why he is a true genius.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|Nuggets was originally released in 1972 as a double album.  It celebrated the garage rock music of the mid 60's with future Patti Smith guitarist Lenny Kaye providing dead-on liner notes.  The band's featured on the album laid the blueprint for such bands as The New York Dolls, The Stooges and Patti Smith as well as the punk movement.  The songs are no nonsense, crazed out rockers with some psychedelia and dance tracks thrown in.  Rhino Records has done an amazing job expanding the original double album into a four cd set.  Some of the songs like The Kingsmen &quot;Louie, Louie&quot;, Sam The Sham &amp; Pharaoh's &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;, The Outsiders' &quot;Time Wont Let Me&quot;, The Human Beinz propulsive &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;, The Musical Explosion's &quot;Little Bit O' Soul&quot;, The Count Five's &quot;Psychotic Reaction&quot;, The Castaways' &quot;Liar, Liar&quot; were all top ten hits with The Strawberry Alarm Clock's &quot;Incense &amp; Peppermint&quot; going all the way to number one.  For the most part, the collection is made up of obscure songs that were minor national hits and regional hits around the country.  Songs like The Cryan Shames' searing &quot;Sugar &amp; Spice&quot;, The Barbarians' earnest &quot;Moulty&quot;, The Lollipop Shoppe's pulsating &quot;You Must Be A Witch&quot;, The Sonics' &quot;Strychnine&quot;, Kim Fowley's spooky &quot;The Trip&quot;, Rare Breed's (who became American Breed and scored a top ten hit with Bend Me, Shape Me) r&amp;b flavored &quot;Beg, Borrow &amp; Steal&quot;, Richard &amp; The Young Lions' stellar &quot;Open Up Your Door&quot;, The Bees' buzzing &quot;Voices Green &amp; Purple&quot; and The Palace Guards' bubble gummy &quot;Falling Sugar&quot; are all basically unknowns.

B0000024LN|5.0|I've been a fan of Redman since his cameo appearances on the EPMD albums.Redman's combination of hard core rhymes and beats with a twist of humor make his style very unique. &quot;Muddy Waters&quot; is definitely his best work and has to go down as one of the best albums of alltime. If not for Red's verses alone then definitely for the 5-star production. Red's beats are so layered and thick that after listening to the verses to the point of memorization I actually found myself trying to tune Red out to catch all the distinct samples in the beats. The production is so fresh and innovative that even if you don't like Red's flow then the beats will still have you jumping around. The song &quot;Creepin&quot; contains a sample from the gang movie &quot;The Warriors&quot; as the hook. It fits perfectly in the song. There will definitely be no song skipping on this album. Red spits hard on every verse and the production is award winning. From skits to songs, beginning to end this Redman album is my favorite of all time and it will be yours too so purchase it today.
B00005QG9J|1.0|Morning view doesn't follow up to incubus's last album.<BR>The album has a few good songs, like &quot;I wish you were here,&quot;<BR>but the rest of the tracks seemed to have been rushed.<BR>Let's just hope that Incubus will take more time in the<BR>recording of their next album.
B00000HYXB|5.0|What can I say but WOW!  This is the most dynamic metal album ever.  From heavy to mellow to saddness this album takes you on a true music rollercoaster.  The album starts out with a bang &quot;Into the Storm&quot; and every other song just rocks!  The piano driven &quot;The Eldar&quot; show cases Hansi's great vocals.  It's hard to pick a worst song since every track is a true masterpeice.  I didn't think Blind Guardian could make a better album than &quot;Immaginations From The Other Side&quot; but they did.  This is Blind Guardian's best.  I can't wait for their new album thats coming out this year!  If it's better than NFIME I will surley die!! Go Blind Guardian!  Buy this album now!!!!!!!
0440211727|4.0|A Time to Kill, by John Grisham, is a suspenseful and poignant novel that keeps you on your feet. When Carl Lee Hailey's ten-year-old daughter gets raped and almost killed by two white men he does what any loving father would do; make sure the men get what they deserve for harming his daughter. Ironically the case goes from two white men being on trial, to a black father on trial for the deaths of the two men that raped his daughter. From an almost all white town in Mississippi Carl's chances look slim to winning his case. Jake Brigance, hired to be Carl Lee Hailey's lawyer, is determined and arrogant. He has few doubts about the case but is planning on winning it on an insanity case. Jake, who has a young daughter his own, agrees with what Carl did to those men. Tension is growing in Clanton Mississippi. The KKK gets involved, people die, and the case gets more gruesome. Overall this book showed me what it would be like to be living in Clanton Mississippi during this capricious time. It would be a tough decision to have to sit on the jury bench and decide whether or not to convict Carl Lee Hailey of murder or not. He did what any good father would do, but he did commit a terrible crime.
B00005OWIU|5.0|I listened to this on AOL, and I just loved it! John Williams did his usual excellent job doing the music to this movie. As I listened to it, I could almost see the movie (even though as I write this it hasn't come out yet). I know I'll enjoy listening to this soundtrack for years to come as I read more Harry Potter.
0451457994|5.0|For anyone who likes novels about space exploration, this certainly qualifies. <BR>In many ways, the novel gives a better understanding of the events in the film, such as the first encounter with the monolith. <BR>The space flight of the Discovery is well written. The pace is what one would expect in such a flight; slow, mudane, building toward a climax. Then the routine is interruptted and the suspense builds. Next comes the great mystery of the second monolith and the weird sences it reviels to Bowman.<BR>One can see the similarities Clarke gives between the dying tribe of the man-apes and the future society; both are on the edge of oblivian and have their normal views of the world distrupted by the unseen aliens. And both are given something of a savior that could very well change their world. <BR>Few sci-fi novels can aproach the greatness of 2001. Not even the <BR>sequels can match it. Any true fan of sci-fi is bound to love this!
B00005K3LU|5.0|It's about time. After many inferior releases on DVD, they finally have released a DVD set that contains all the extras that fans like me have been waiting for. 2 discs, THX AND DTS sound choices, deleted scenes (that can be watched with the movie or separately), magazine articles, production photos and the list goes on. Arguably the best action movie of all time and of the Die Hard series, this is one DVD that must be in your collection.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I bought this because I liked &quot;My Own Prison&quot; plus I had heard &quot;Higher&quot; released on radio.  When I heard &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot; it really hit me because my wife and I just had a baby girl. She fills my life with so much joy!  I hope and pray she greets the world with Arms Wide Open.  Excellant CD!
B00005QHPQ|4.0|While some national magazines have lobbed pretty harsh criticism at this CD, it's not as bad as those publications would have you think.   Though it's not a major musical milestone, I don't really think Enrique Iglesias was shooting for an album that would change people's lives.  What he does deliver, though, is a nice collection of uptempo songs with an occassional ballad thrown in for good measure.  The CD kicks off with three very enjoyable tracks.  &quot;Escape,&quot; &quot;Don't Turn Off The Lights,&quot; and &quot;Love To See You Cry&quot; are almost club-ready tracks, just a remix away from packing dancefloors.  True, much of it is derivative, but at least he's drawing from quality stuff--&quot;Love To See You Cry&quot; sounds very close to Modjo's &quot;Lady (Hear Me Tonight).&quot;   From the opening trio of tracks, the album shifts gears for the current radio staple, &quot;Hero.&quot;  Enrique Iglesias is not the greatest of ballad singers, but his delivery here is solid, and he does have a fairly strong voice to work with anyway.  He often seems to substitute breathy vocals for soul, but with something as confectioner-sweet as this, it's excusable.  The only other track that slows down is &quot;Maybe,&quot; is midtempo track that kind of blends into the rest of the album.   If there's one thing this CD is guilty of, it's of trying to put its arms around too many different uptempo sounds.  &quot;I Will Survive&quot; does borrow somewhat from the Gloria Gaynor disco classic, but it also seems to be lyrically paced in a manner close to Paula Abdul's &quot;Straight Up.&quot;  &quot;Love 4 Fun&quot; sounds like an updated Ace of Base track.  And &quot;She Be The One&quot; is a pretty weak lyrical stab at being hip (nice beat, though).  The other two tracks, &quot;One Night Stand&quot; and &quot;If The World Crashes Down&quot; would fit perfectly on Cher's &quot;Believe&quot; album.   The final three songs are Spanish-language versions of three of the tracks onthe album.   Is this album perfect?  No, not at all (the Mariah Carey-esque shreiking at the end of &quot;Don't Turn Off The Lights&quot; is pretty startling and doesn't really help the song out).  But the production is pretty good (Iglesias co-produced a lot of it, as well as co-writing all of the songs), and even if it does draw from some less-than-stellar talents, he has been able to craft songs that are pleasing to hear, if not life-altering.  It's also interesting to note that he seems to rely less on the Latin rhythms that punctuated his last English-language album, and that serves him fairly well.  This time next year, you probably won't be listening to this one incessantly, but then again, CDs that spin in your CD player for more than twelve months are fairly few and far between.   If you're a fan of breezy pop songs, then this one's for you.  Chances are you'll be hearing a lot of these songs on the radio over the next few months anyway, so consider this a sneak peek into what 2002 holds for us.
B00003CWTI|5.0|Overwhelmingly sad and poignant portrayal of human brokenness, tragedy, and hurt.  The random connections which keep cropping up between the nine main characters make this film all the more powerful, as if the universe were charging on without explanation or reason, throwing people onto the rocks as it did, randomly smashing their best attempts to live ordered lives.  The way the movie reveals the secret griefs of the loveably square cop, as played by John Reilly, and the despicable stud, played by Tom Cruise, are particularly affecting.  This movie reminds me to an uncomfortable degree of my own secret bruises.  For all the times I've seen it, I've never been able to get through it without crying.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|I have been An Enrique fan for almost 5 years now and I admit I was a little nervous when I heard Enrique say that his new album was compleely differnt than anything he has ever done before. But I must say Escape has become my favortoe album. Most of the songs  are upbeat and  very catchy and you cant help tap your feet. He has also remembered the fans who love him for his ballrds<BR>with the wonderful Hero and my favorite song from the Album Maybe.  I highly recomend this Album  you are in  for a wonder experience.
B00000JGHM|5.0|This is the best crime movie ever made, the lives of cops &amp; criminals are explored very deeply here, In this film Pacino is a workoholic police detective, so devoted that his wife(Diane Venora)feels neglected, his stepdaughter (Natalie Portman) is going through adolescent confusion, &amp; he is so obsessed that he can't see his life falling apart, DeNiro is at his best here as a career criminal that is so smart that it fustrates Pacino, a robbery gone wrong involving DeNiro, his companion Kilmer, as well as others is what draws the attention of Pacino, the cat &amp; mouse game that the two leads play with each other are very entertaining at times, if not funny, the scene where DeNiro &amp; his crew set up Pacino &amp; his fellow officers on a potential target that is in hindsight a set up to see who is on to them is comical in itself as Pacino tells his men: &quot;you know what they are looking at..... US!!!!, we just got made&quot; fustrated Pacino arranges a meeting with DeNiro in the hopes of getting inside his way of thinking is by far the best sequence, the downtown shootout in which Pacino infiltrates DeNiro's supposed last robbery, is so realistic that the viewer is at times shaken up, this film definately plays on the theory that eventually a life of crime has no happy ending, the one on one showdown between DeNiro &amp; Pacino is so tense that by the end you are left with nothing but strong emotion &amp; a sense of respect that the two men come to have for one another, definately the thinking person's action movie. Highy Recommended!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CX5P|5.0|First let me say that I am a huge Star Wars fan.  I have been since I saw the first one at a drive-in when it first came out.  Do I feel that Star Wars is the best thing in the world?  No.  Do I feel it is great entertainment?  Heck yes.  And this DVD proves it.  Packed with some of the best extra features I have ever seen on a DVD.  Also, the best picture and sound I have ever seen or heard.  Now, if you hate Star Wars.  Then why are you reading this.  You will only hate the DVD.  But if you liked or loved the movie.  You will love this DVD.  Just the &quot;In the beginning&quot; documentary is worth the price of the DVD.  I have sat for hours watching the extra features and I still need about another hour or two to finish watching them all.
0393039765|5.0|Welcome to Fight Club, You're on your way into a whole new way of thinking. Read the book first or watch the movie first, it does not matter, in both cases your in for a world of incredible, non-stop brilliance. Chuck Palahniuk is the best new author to arrive in the last 5 years. Fight Club, is where it all started. A balls out, knock out, dog fight of a book (that's not a bad thing, that's a good thing!). The movie was hyped as a 'Fight&quot; movie, while the book was far from that. Nothing like a good book on a stormy black night with the visuals of Tyler Durden and Narrator pounding brains and allowing yourself to get deep into the book. Fight Club is simply perfect in every way, I can not think of a single dispointment.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This has to be one of the most invigoratingly fresh and exciting albums of the year! This album combines sounds of pop, rock, dance, and even some hip-hop undertones.  And the way Enrique sings  and says his words are cool and wacky, definitely making the songs his own.  It's the perfect mix of sounds. And the songs are so cool! Although Enrique is Latin, when you hear this album you just hear an American Pop/Rock star!  And he really is making his own mark separating himself from his father in every way possible.  And the best thing of all, nearly every song is great on this album.  Everything I've bought this year across the board I only like a couple of songs on the CD, but this one is great in everyway.  This is a must have of 2001!
B000050HTO|5.0|This CD has Dylans early works to his latest, the best of. CD #2 of the set is awesome. Dylan is a creator, an artist with heartfelt words that touch your spirit, brings you to a place of contemplation. We still love you Dylan, after all these years. Reb in Seattle, Wa
B00004XQ83|5.0|Wonderful assortment of the best bluegrass in the world! Some of these cuts are hauntingly beautiful, I cannot stop playing this CD in my car, at home, the tunes are always lerking in my head. Highly recommend this once in a lifetime gem from the mountains of America, God Bless America!!!!!!
B00005QIPH|3.0|When people first heard the Beatles, this is what they said: derivative, nothing special, just buy a Carl Perkins album instead. When many reviewers heard this record, there was a similar clamor: derivative, nothing special, just buy a Velvet Underground album instead.<br />  Are we agreed on this?<br />  I wouldn't have much to add to the discussion, except that I have seen the Strokes live (at the Benefit for New Yorkers Against Violence, 10/28/01). As I stood, watching them with an ever growing smile on my face, I felt like I was present for something special - something I might tell young people (of the future) about to impress them. I imagine the Strokes are capable of great things, and if they are allowed to release a large number of albums in succession (like the Beatles did), they may be able to become something undeniably superior to pop music as it exists today.<br />  The album Is This It? is in itself nothing short of pretty good. It's not a breakthrough nor is it derivative garbage. It features catchy songs, a great sound and a fantastic vocal performance. Why put it down? Just enjoy and wait for what may come...
B00005QGAV|5.0|do you think this album needs this kind of recommendation?<BR>It sells itself.<BR>It's simple, if you don't have this one, just buy? what's in your mind?
6304493681|5.0|This is what Anime is supost to be. One of the best hands down. Only thing on par with this is Akira. I'm not a super big fan of these type of movies, how ever this is one of the great ones. Even if you don't like japanies \\"cartoons\\", this is head and sholders above the rest.
0944092705|5.0|I've looked at thousands of photo books in my life and this is one of my personal favorites. Why? It isn't, for the most part, because of the subject matter. Eggleston's images are pretty banal -- common everyday objects that we routinely ignore. I like this book because it shows an undisputed master dealing simultaneously with two photographic problems -- color and a square image format. Even if you don't agree with Szarkowski's assertion that Eggleston was the first photographer to actually see in color (in contrast to the emphasis upon form and texture that characterizes black and white photography), there is no disputing the originality of his vision and the influence that it has had on subsequent generations of photographers. The images in this book, from early in his career,  beautifully display that vision. But, unlike any of his other photographs, the ones in this book are square. Most photographs are reproduced in rectangular format, providing them with a natural visual tension. Faced with a square format, many photographers opt for symmetry as a compositional strategy. Not Eggleston -- he uses color to create disproportionate visual weights and add a visual dynamic to the images. For a nice contrast, compare the images in this book to those in Larry Fink's Social Graces (black and white photos in the 2 1/4 format) to appreciate the difference between using color (Eggleston) and non-symmetric form (Fink) to get rid of the structural monotony of the square image format. Finally, this book is an absolute delight to hold. The pages and cover, as with most other Twin Palms books, provide tactile pleasures a quantum leap beyond those in 98% of other books.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Bought this DVD to watch with my kids and I couldn't believe how blown away I was.<br />Sure the animation is still old school, but they did a simply amazing job restoring the colors. Everything is vibrant and beautiful.<br />Then you get to all the behind the scenes features. I can't belive that Disney has not done this sort of thing sooner. I just hope that this sets the standard for all future releases from them!
0783232039|5.0|I enjoyed this movie alot. As an avid lover of Chucky movies...I was looking forward to a sequel being made, when Chucky's offspring jumps out at the coriner.  This movie will be justice if they make a 5th installment in the Child's Play series. But as for the other 3, they are all good in my book.
B00005OWIU|5.0|If the movie is half as good as the soundtrack then we are in for a treat.  From the haunting score of Harry's prologue to the exciting and gripping sounds of Quidditch, this is a must have for anyone who loves orchestral music or just loves Harry in general.  I highly recommend it to everyone who likes music.  Your CD player, your ears and your soul won't be disappointed.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is a must have for any Nirvana <BR>fan, all the songs are 100%.
B00004ZD69|4.0|I am often reluctant to write music reviews. Many reviews, especially on this site, reek of pseudo-boho conceit and aesthetically shallow opinion. However, I must share my thoughts with regard to this epic creation. LYSFLAH is a creation...an experience rather than an album. It attempts to fuse genres and shatter expectations, and does so with great success.<br />When listening to music, I am moved by musical talent and melody. Many groups have both, but fail to compose a balanced, unique recipe for the masses. Upon initial consideration, I was repulsed by the group's self-indulgent, incoherent drone. Mammoth tracks, abstract sound clips and the dentist-drill guitar...I imagined the members of Godspeed, sipping on bottles of LaBatt Blue and tuning instruments in their Montreal bar, chuckling in disbelief over their Kranky record deal. Poor art-rock enthusiasts...we were just throwing around some experimental sound structures and we landed a record deal...enjoy our new \\"record\\". Hee hee... eh? <br />Although I was growing tired of the CDs quickly, I knew that something significant lie in the lofty arrangements of sonic chords and oft ethereal harmonies. Yes...I would listen until I found truth and could digest the sounds entering my auditory meatus. <br />I found what I was looking for...after listening to both discs...six times each...while reading and washing dishes.<br />Godspeed, in my humble opinion, requires concentration and time. Their style is innovative and abstract. Weezer it is not. If you, as listener, put in the effort, Godspeed will guide you. The album is like Versailles...with compassion.<br />Yes...humble.
B000056K04|4.0|If you've been reading the reviews, you'll see they are pretty much split fifty-fifty.  Die hard fans will say Dave has abandoned them, and new fans getting this as their first Dave album might say its pretty good.  I recently have purchased this CD, Under The Table and Dreaming, and Crash.  All I can say is that Dave Matthews is a musician and an artist... they tend to want to explore different avenues sometimes, and that's what this album is all about.<BR><br /><BR>What you're getting with this album, as opposed to past albums, is less individual solo performances from each musician in the band.  In return, you get a tight sound with each instrument carrying an even weight throughout.  There will be times when you hear the sax break out, or a funky drum fill, but instead of several long minutes of buildup, each song gets right to the point.<BR><br /><BR>Will you like this album?  Just ask yourself if you like what's being played on the radio these days from similar bands.  Its that simple.  I think this is a different direction for the band, and honestly, I love change from the norm every once in a while.  My recommendation would be to buy this one, because as an album itself without any of the past ones to look back on... it still stands taller than the others out there.
0451524985|4.0|I adored the sexual freedom of this book, the way it voiced an opinion I've held deep inside without voicing it for fear of sacrilege:  intellect is not sustenance enough to live on, rather, it can sometimes drain you of sustenance.<BR>Though I dare to call myself feminist, my approval of Mellors denies this -- I suppose the female part of me ignores the intellectual feminist part.
B00005NWRS|3.0|Ryan Adams probably isn't going to start writing bad songs anytime soon, but it's hard not to see this collection as something of a stab at commercial viability. No shame in that, really -- the guy should do whatever he wants. But it does take some of the edge off the raw, underproduced character that had previously defined his work. And some folks will have trouble with that.<br />That said, Adams is still one of the best of the -- let me use the cliche here that he doesn't always fit -- \\"alt-country\\" artists out there. The only problem with \\"Gold\\" might only be that it's not \\"Heartbreaker\\" or \\"Pneumonia\\". While it might suffer from those lofty comparisons, it's still pretty darn good. And it's another step in the evolution of a wonderful young songwriter that has been (and I suspect will continue to be) very rewarding to watch.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee I wanted more great reads from you!!<br />Every writers strives to achieve what came so readily for Ms. Lee with her first and only novel. Every reader (young and old) will have questions. I know I did.<br />The rage of an era and the ignorance of people. 41 years after the book - people are still angry and ignorant. The people (Finches, Radleys, Ewells, Robinsons, Cunninghams), the town (Maycomb), the crime (rape by a black man of a white woman), the innocence (Scout and Dill), fear (Mayella) and wisdom (Jem) of children - in one book. I first read this classic at 13 years of age. I had so many questions, I drove my mother nuts. Why? Why? Why? Atticus, Cal, Scout, Dill, Jem, Tom, Helen, Maudie, Ms. Stephanie, Aunty, Heck, will always be a part of me. On a scale of 1-10, this read is a 100.<br />Ms. Lee, wherever you are, whatever you are doing ... Thank you!!
B00005KFUN|2.0|I bought this not having heard anything from the band on the strengh of the review by Q Magazine.  As happens when you go in without knowing too much, you run the great risk of being dissatisfied.  I don't know what I expected coming in, but the reviews were likening it to Radiohead and Queen.  Maybe they just meant in their progressive and orchestral aspects, which certainly can be found here.  But this certainly had nothing that those other bands posses which make them memorable, mainly hooks and panache, which are completely lacking in this effort.
B00003ZA8Y|5.0|As a Bob Marley fan,I was nervous that this cd would not do justice to the originals from the master himself.Well, I was pleasantly surprised,an outstanding effort by Mr.Alexander.This cd is the perfect antidote for everyday stress especially from work.This is an excellent blend of reggae and jazz with masterful piano work.Highly recommended to the Bob Marley fans that can apppreciate these classic songs..my favorite track is #9.simply smooth, elegant.
0783114222|5.0|Having read Andrew Chaikin's &quot;A man on a moon&quot;, I learnt that Tom Hanks had produced this HBO mini series and I was eager to see it. And what I saw was absolutely captivating. This film is exactly the kind of stuff one likes to discover when passionate about the race to the moon. Questions like: how do we undertake a voyage to the moon; what kind of problems had to be solved to conceive a spacecraft able to land on the moon; how does an astronaut inside a lunar module put on a spacesuit - and many others - are answered throughout these 12 enthralling episodes. The enthusiasm of Tom Hanks and of all his staff for this amazing space adventure can be felt all through the film. A special mention must be made here for the episode depicting how Prof. Lee Silver and &quot;The King&quot; Farouk El Baz succeeded in turning fully accomplished pilot-astronauts into very skilled explorers of the unknown. Along with Ron Howard's &quot;Apollo 13&quot; and Philip Kaufman's &quot;The right stuff&quot;, this HBO miniseries is a &quot;must&quot; for all Apollo nostalgics.
6302859204|5.0|This movie just blew me away.  It is horrifying.  Not because of the aliens, but the fact that it really happened.  Six men that saw it took lie detecter tests and they ALL passed.  God that's freaky.  The last fifteen minutes are just scary as hell.  If you like any kind of movie, you'll love this!  Check it out.  (...)
0684833395|4.0|Catch 22 was a very intriguing book to say the least. The main character, Yossarian, seemed to be a bit of an oddball, which kept all of the story lines quite interesting. At times Catch 22 can get rather confusing as Joseph Heller jumps back and forth between one story and another, not really making any smooth transitions between them which tends to throw you off as a reader. The entire story is based during World War II and much of it is spent in different countries around Europe. You, as the reader get to travel with Yossarian from country to country while he makes deliveries, bombing runs, and becomes acquaintances with many people, including a hooker that he becomes quite fond of. Much of the story has humorous sections that leave you laughing and wanting to read more only to find out what type of antics Yossarian will perform next, including a time when he decides to become a nudist on the military base at which he is stationed. Overall, Catch 22 is by far one of the best books I've ever read. It keeps you on your toes with humor and action, along with a plot that only thickens as you read further into the book. I recommend this book only to more advanced readers, however, as it can get quite complicated to understand.
B0000026UL|4.0|OH MERCY is a frustrating album - not as frustrating as Dylan's earlier INFIDELS, which could have been ten times better than it was had he included &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; - but frustrating nonetheless.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great album, and it rekindled everybody's faith in Dylan after the EMPIRE BURLESQUE fiasco, but it could have been better.<BR>&quot;Political World&quot; is, as another reviewer said, Dylan doing an impression of Dylan.  He does a pretty good impression, but we've been there, done that, and if we want to hear it again, we all own the old albums, right?<br />&quot;Where Teardrops Fall&quot; is so-so; it's kind of nice the first couple times, but it can't hold up.<br />&quot;Everything is Broken&quot; has been criticized for its simplicity - it's just a bunch of lists.  I personally like it, though I can't really say why.<br />&quot;Ring Them Bells&quot; is the best song Dylan did (or at least RELEASED - &quot;Blind Willie McTell&quot; is a bit better) in the eighties.  Yes, it has religious imagery, but that doesn't mean it's a religious song.  Musically and lyrically, it's in Dylan's top twenty.<br />&quot;Man in the Long Black Coat&quot; is also a great song, though I listened to it way too many times and am now sick of it.  I have to give it a hiatus, because it really is a good song.  Lanois' great production is most evident on this track, which even has crickets chirping at the beginning.<br />&quot;Most of the Time&quot; is actually better than some of the songs on TIME OUT OF MIND.  One of Dylan's best &quot;pain&quot; songs.<br />&quot;What Good Am I?&quot; is good - not great, good.  It tends to drag on a bit, but it's a credit to the album.<br />&quot;Disease of Conceit&quot; ... oh, dear.  Oh, dear, dear, dear.  I've read in several places the theory that this song was a joke, and I really hope for Dylan's sake that it was.  It's trite, overdone, and ridiculous.  The bit about the doctors doing research is probably the lowest point in the album, if not the decade.<br />&quot;What Was It You Wanted&quot; is up there with &quot;Most of the Time&quot;.  Nice recovery after the previous track.  Lanois' production is good here - it's a dark, hard-edged (that makes no sense) song.<br />&quot;Shooting Star&quot; is a great ending.  It's one of the three best songs on the album, along with &quot;Ring Them Bells&quot; and &quot;Man In The Long Black Coat&quot;.  We come away from the album with a good taste in our mouths, though it could have been even better if Dylan had gotten rid of &quot;Disease of Conceit&quot; and replaced it with &quot;Series of Dreams&quot;, which he recorded for this album and which was released in 1991 as part of the BOOTLEG SERIES.
0385335482|5.0|Can I just say that reading this book felt like I was reading my life? This is one of the best books that I have ever read. I am a person who hates to read and when I stumbled across this book at [a local store] I picked it up thinking that it looked good just from the title, and I thought that I would give it a chance. I couldn't put the book down and I high recommend this book to anyone who enjoys shopping and a good laugh. This book took me 5 days to read and I can totally see myself reading this book again and again. I was able to relate to a lot of it considering the fact that I could picture a lot of the details that were being described because I had been to England several times adn love it there. It felt like home. Definately pick this book up and READ IT!
B00003CY0V|5.0|Billions of dollars, FBI, Hackers, and Underground agencies, all thrown in with chases, explotions and a bit of emotion and passion. This DVD is a MUST buy for anyone who enjoys premium action entertainment. <BR>The DVD was, however, a bit dissapointing that DTS wasn't included, but the commentery and alternate endings are terrific. Hell the whole movie kept me entertained for every minute, it was a very good movie. Hugh Jackman and John Travolta show great emotion and can expertly convey their feelings out to the audience. There is some revealing nudity in the film, so beware if you have children in the house or plan on seeing this with a date. All in all this is an excellent DVD.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This CD is amazing! It represents the story and the magic of Harry Potter so well. It is great to listen to at any time. I have been playing it in my room constantly from the time that i got it.  I recomend it to anyone who has read the book, and anyone who hasent because you can enjoy this no matter who you are!!! IT IS THE BEST!!!
6304342586|5.0|I wanted to see this movie soooo bad when it came out and my parents wouldn't let me. They thought it was too intense for a young kid. Well, thanks to the magic of DVD, I can enjoy it in all its \\"soooo bad it's good\\" glory.<br />Architect Paul Newman and owner William Holden have just completed their crowning acheivement; the 138 story Glass Tower. Unbeknownst to them, baddy builder Richard Chamberlain skimped on the building specs. He wired the building with tinsel or something; as soon as someone plugs in a hair dryer, the fuses go pop (why do the put the fuse boxes in the room used to store the oily rags and paint cans? Why do they need oily rags and paint cans on the 86th floor? Is there an oily rag and paint can room on every floor, or do people have to share?) and the all-star barbeque begins.<br />If there are a million stories in the naked city, there must be, oh, about 138 stories in this movie. Fred Astaire is trying to defraud widow Jennifer Jones (who wears an awful muumuu and a hairdo that makes her look like a brunette St. Bernard) who babysits the kids of the conveniently-deaf neighbor (who must also have had damage to her nose; I can understand she doesn't hear the fire alarm, but can't she smell smoke?), Susan Flannery is the secretary having an affair with boss Robert Wagner (note to self- never shut off the phones!). O.J. Simpson saves a cat. (I am not touching THAT one) I could get carpal tunnel syndrome trying to type it all. Faye Dunaway is in love with Paul Newman (well, can you blame her?), and grumpy, humpy Steve McQueen comes to save the day.<br />All the padding doesn't take away from the fun. The movie has some moments that I am glad my parents did not let their pre-teen kid see: some of the fiery deaths are surprisingly graphic. But the cheese factor is high: in the great opening helicopter shot, the building visibly wobbles (maybe a nod to Earthquake?), the sets are decorated in what can only be called Frank Lloyd Wrong, the scenic elevator/ helicopter scene has to be seen to be believed (and even then you won't). <br />I recommend this with \\"Die Hard\\" as a great acrophobia doube feature!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|After a long, anticipatory wait i finally went to see the movie last night and was completely blown away. Moulin Rouge was an asolutely beautiful, fantastic, wonderful, sensory overloading experience. Nicole Kidman was gorgeously stunning (as always). I was completely overwhelmed. So of course, first thing this morning I went out and got the soundtrack. Imagine my total disappointment when I saw that it was NOT the ORIGINAL movie soundtrack...the 'Like A Virgin' sequence (one of my favorites)was not included, the 'Elephant Impromptu Rehearsal' had somehow been overlooked and a few other musical scenes had been left out...I still bought the soundtrack but good as it is and it IS very good-I honestly found it to be somewhat lacking. The vivid visual imagery I remember on the screen, scene by scene and the images now conjured in my mind as I listen to the CD are not one and the same, definitley some of the raw cinema/stage quality was lost in the transition e.g. 'Lady Marmalade' as sung by Lil' Kim etc. just does not compare to the wild, sensual abandon I heard, saw and FELT in the cinematic musical sequence and it is for these reasons I rated this CD four stars. Like I said...absolutely FABULOUS, but...
0385335482|5.0|Can I say that when I was reading this book I felt like I was reading my life? This was truly an amazing book and an incredibly fast read. I read this book within 5 days because I was not able to put this book down at any point. I was able to connect with this book because it took place in London ( a place that I am very familiar with) So if you enjoy reading and you want something that will make you laugh than this is the book for you!
B000059T00|5.0|From listening to this and other bootlegs around you'd have to conclude that this was Stevie's band. (In many ways it's an extension of material he was recording with Traffic)<BR>Clapton took a back seat but his contributions were not diminished in any way. It's practically the closest he has come to jazz-rock, aside of &quot;Old Love&quot; and the material on his most recent studio album, &quot;Reptile&quot;. His solo on &quot;Presence of the Lord&quot; is alternatively savage and poignant, the famous break, an exercise in controlled aggression. I love the loose jazzy jam &quot;Do what you like&quot;, where Clapton again excels. &quot;Had to Cry Today&quot; is a potent, but less ardent example of hard rock (compared to Cream) and the delicate &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; make this an outstanding set. This band had enormous potential, much of it unrealised, sadly.<BR>The expectations were simply too great, and the pressures on them as a money generating venture too extreme.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|This is enrique's best ever. Hero, Don't Turn Off The Lights, She Be The One, and of course, Maybe...these are the standout songs. One song I would like to point out that no one else has is....&quot;One Night Stand&quot;. Seriously, after I heard it once I was singing it throughout the whole day. It's a sad song with a fun beat and that is enough to stick in your head. This is a fantastic album with a fantastic theme.
B000021YQV|5.0|Finally modern rock has produced a band worthy to follow in the footsteps of The Who, The Clash, The Jam, and even the Dead Kennedy's.  I have heard a lot of hype about &quot;political bands&quot; for ages but System of a Down is the first one to combine honesty, politics, and good kick-a&amp;&amp; music in ages.  Probably the last time this happened was when Joe Strummer of The Clash had to explain politics to drunken frat-boys (waiting for Van Halen presumably) at the US Festival in 1983.  &quot;Toxicity&quot; didn't come soon enough for me!  Now if only Philly could produce a group like this; but that would probably take unrealistic divine intervention.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Sure the effects are cool, sure the actions are great... and sure some people watch for the romance, but I really hate it when directors do a real poor job on details and accuracy of past events. First off the date was wrong in respect to the Japanese calender, the chronological order of some events were wrong, popularity of certain warhead and machinery were wrong... I can continue for hours about how terrible this movie can get. You wanna see romance? Go see &quot;Thomas Crown Affiar.&quot; You wanna see a war flick? Go see &quot;Saving Private Ryan.&quot; Just don't watch this movie, it's simply not good enough (any way you look at it).
B000001IPL|5.0|smash would have to be offspring's best CD yet.  it has all good songs, plus a good intro.  come out and play is very catchy, though not like any of offspring's other songs, being the theme for monkey bone.  my favourite song is nitro, because it is one of their more fast-paced songs.  i bought this CD after i got americana so i didnt know what i was in for.  this CD is clearly better than any of their others. dexter has made yet more very intelegent lyrics, as he always does.(exept for americana) id   give this CD a 10 if i could.
6305508550|5.0|Altough this is not a very widely known movie, it is one of my favorite all time comedies.  It does not have many well known actors, but I believe they protray the daily 9 to 5 cubicle office job very well.  I like the way Peter has a carefree attitude about working.  The plot is entertaining and very comical.  Since he dosen't like to work he just stops going and decides to make a computer virus to steal money from the company.  There are so many funny lines in this movie.  I have seen it many times and never get tired of it.  I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00003CXA6|3.0|It is very hard to bash this movie. The shots are great (when else do you get the feeling of 100 cannon firing at once.) The script is fine, the cameos are fun (Ted Turner, Ken Burns) And little round top was clearly Epic. I have watched this movie over and over for the battle scenes, but....<br />It still seems to be missing something, it took several viewings to figure it out, but what it is missing is acting.  I have never seen so many bad performances by good actors.  Tom Beringer and Martin Sheen were not believable in their roles. Jeff Daniels , I could just see Dumb & Dumber. Jeb Stuart wooden. John Bell Hood, wooden. <br />There were just too many subpar performances, it took away from the few fine ones, ( Lang, Gordon, Howell Conway.) The real stars were in my opinion the reenactors from all over who considered this a labor of reverance. It is worth watching for their sakes. <br />I only hope we will see better from the prequel.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|I first saw Shrek about two weeks ago. It looked like a good movie, but a kids movie, one that I wouldn't want to go out and spend six bucks to see, so I waited until it hit the dollar theater. I went in, expecting a steriotypically predictable, yet usually somewhat enjoyable Disney movie, but was shocked to find myself actually laughing out loud, pleasently suprised by  comedy and unexcpected outcome. A good aquaintance of mine, john garbett worked on the film, and john... way to go. I rated this 5 stars for it's witty twists and astonishingly hilarious humor.
B000006JPJ|5.0|I bought this album when I was 12 and I've been a Maiden fan ever since. I still beleive this is their best effort to date and it amazes me when fans slag the record off. This is a complex album, you've got to put a bit of aural effort in before you can appreciate it fully! Granted, it doesnt have the immediacy of a &quot;wasted years&quot; or &quot;run to the hills,&quot; but it repays the listener with an untouched complexity after a few listens. Maiden must have considered it a gamble to release a concept album at what was probably the height of their success, but it paid off on the strength of these songs. Have they ever before (or since) released an album with no &quot;weak&quot; songs? I dont think so. So I agree that there have been individual songs that may be better than any individual song on &quot;seventh son&quot;, but this album is a classic and no other maiden album can touch it...so far. Up the Irons!
B0000024JA|5.0|Meth is the best.No doubt whatsoever This album was the best at its time.I liked every track on this cd and personaly i think meth has the best style out all other mc's.It was because of meth i even liked rap but of course this goes way back.(...)
B00005OWIU|5.0|Hmmm...looks as though I'm the first to review this. Wow. What can I say really? There are loads of things I like about this CD and some that I don't, of course like with everything else I'm attempting to hold off judgement until I *see* the film, but that's so hard!<br />I wasn't sure whether I liked the idea of John Williams writing the score for the film. I wasn't sure then, but I am now. The theme that is repeated is lush and rich and adds to the magical quality of an extremely wonderful story.
6305003882|4.0|What is spectacular about &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot;, you ask?  The acting, for one, is superb.  Leonardo DeCaprio is at once, cool-minded, suave, insightful, and, (playing a character who was once revered for his skills on the basketball court and in writing but who faces a serious drug problem), deadly accurate in playing the role of what drugs and taking a wrong turn can do to a person.  The plot starts off pleasantly enough.  Leo is an aspiring writer living in the poor side of New York City.  He is a star athlete who hangs around three buddies---all with goals of mischief, basketball, and being just boys.  One fateful night, one pal introduces the easily influenced Leo to drugs and sex......and the plot then focus almost exclusively on his  downward spiral of a new life filled with drugs, hustling, theft, and homelessness.  He, along with another addict friend (played by Mark Walburg---who is also a serious character actor and excellent), quit school, leave home and turn into thugs.  The aspiring writer can no longer function; he is derilict, dependant on herion and crack, and without a family.  And it is here that DeCaprio displays a superb range of acting skills.  He is so believable in his reactions to life on the streets, in crack houses, and the wild display of emotion, of self-hatred, of dispair is beautifully portrayed.  In fact, I found myself often shaking my head at the life thrown away.  Though the story ends on a positive note and with a wake-up call, the themes of how a single life can take a disasterous turn in one night is strongly felt.  I agree with what one other reviewer says: the message of this movie actually &quot;screams&quot; to teenagers that drugs are evil, as is throwing one's life down the drain, along with all hope, opportunity, and a potentially bright future.  Between the acting, the storyline, and the turns in plot, &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; is a great movie.  I highly recommend this intelligent film.
0385484518|5.0|After hearing friends and family talk about how wonderful this book was, I had to read it.  From the beginning until the end I was completely consumed by the story Mitch (the author) told about his Tuesday visits with his former college professor.  This story answered all of my questions regarding life.  It motivated me to truely value life and the people I love.  This book encouraged me to live my life to the fullest.  I was impressed with Morrie's attitude towards dying.  Instead of mourning his illness he took the time to inspire his friends, family, and the world.  I cried and laughed throughout the book.  I will forever be touched by this book!

B00003CX5P|5.0|This is not a review so much as a vent.  Yeah Jar Jar is really annoying, that's what he was supposed to be.  The fact that Qui Gon chose for him to accompany them was just as annoying to the audience as it was for Obi-1.  That was the whole point, we identify with Obi-1 in his development as a Jedi Knight.  What would have happened if there would have been no Jar Jar?  No one would have known about the Gungan's grand army and they could have never taken back Naboo.  The point here is obvious - everyone has value and potential.  Qui-Gon saw something hidden that Obi-wan and the rest of us were ready to overlook. (. . . )If we are big enough to overlook minor flaws in people we may discover some real intelligence and value.  That's what is so great about this movie, to really enjoy it, you have to alter your own views a little and look past your own bias and preconceptions and develop some genuine tolleration.  And that, after all, is the key to really getting along with people anyway isn't it?
B00000JPHF|5.0|Yes, the plot departs from Mary Shelley's novel, and the development of the Frankenstein character is nothing like what it could have been later... but the depiction is brilliant. Frankenstein, seeking power over life and death, is brilliantly acted, and captures the essence of the theme within the boundaries of early 1930s filmography and sound.<br />This superb film belongs on the shelf of anyone who enjoys a look at the dark side of human nature, and motivation gone awry.
B00003CXAA|5.0|A bit pricey, sure, but you get running commentary on all 3 films by Mr. Coppola himself, and that is worth the purchase alone.  Sure, you could rent the DVDs, hear the commmentaries, and save a few bucks, but the first 2 movies are DVD LIBRARY ESSENTIALS!!! You should OWN THESE! The 3rd, well, ain't all bad.(...)<br />The bonus disc in the GODFATHER set is an informative delight.  You really get a sense of how much Coppola loves making movies.
B000000WFZ|5.0|If you buy this title, it is worth all the money you pay for it, and then some. Morricone puts you back in your seat with some of the most dramatic and beautiful music ever heard. Using this title for a marching band show at our school, I had never heard more beautiful music. It will make you cry. Please get this CD, you won't regret it.
B00005LMBK|5.0|this album rox.!!!!!its not one of those albums that only one song is good.theyre all awsome!do yourself a favor and buy this album now
0783228317|2.0|The book fear and loathing in las vegas, by the brilliant Hunter S. Thompson, was a fantastic book filled with social issues like the death of the american dream.  The movie, however, had all of the high points of the book taken out and was turned into a crappy stoner flick.  The high point of this film, is an astonishingly good preformance by Johnny Depp as deranged sports writer Hunter Thompson, aka Raoul Duke.  Buy the book not the movie.
B00003W8NO|5.0|After seeing the preview for Toy Story on television, I could not wait to view Disney/Pixar's newest animation. Toy Story is the most innovative and technologically advanced cartoon movie I have ever seen. I was constantly intrigued by the detail and coloration of the characters and background. Every scene was filled with imaginative fun and adventure. Pixar effectively chose two wonderful actors for the voices of the main characters, Woody, an old-fashioned cowboy doll, and Buzz Lightyear, a high-tech space invader. Tom Hanks plays the voice of Woody while Tim Allen speaks for Buzz. Director John Lasseter creates a wonderful combination of a comical and adventurous plot. This movie is fantastic for all audiences and I recommend it to everyone.
B000001DZM|5.0|If you're looking for a fun time, then this CD is for you!  This is the perfect CD for parties or when you need something to lift you up, as these songs never fail to make me smile and forget my worries.  You can dance, you can laugh or you can just enjoy but why not do all three at the same time!  This should be a staple in every persons CD collection.  Perfection!
0380973650|3.0|Disclaimer: Am a diehard Gaiman fan...have read everything he has written (more than once), own signed limited editions, etc. While I was enchanted by the potential of this book, I was not blown away reading it. It has all of the trappings of Gaiman's work....mythical &amp; transformative themes (this one involving an archetypal journey into the heart of America), wierd and endearing characters, twisted and dark subplots, rich layers of historical reference, and magical juxtapositions of worlds and dimensions with the &quot;commonsense and everyday&quot;. But I was left feeling like this was a pre-final draft with many of the concepts remaining hazy and underdeveloped, not crisp and polished, perfect and savory. Possibly a reflection of an unrealistic publisher's deadline?
B00000251N|5.0|I absolutely adore this recording.  I have worn out a vinyl and cassette tape and now own the CD.There is something very spiritual about the music in this soundtrack.I've been a big ND fan for years and spent two hours trying to get on the &quot;Live by request&quot; a couple of months back. I think that it is a tribute to the endearing quality of Diamond's music that I never did get through. Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a soaring,inspiring recording. I particularly like &quot;Be&quot; and &quot;Dear father&quot;,but all the rest are right up there. Shortly after &quot;JLS&quot; was released I had the opportunity to see ND in concert and he did a medley from the film complete with a laser light Jonathan that flew over the audience which of course was on its feet.   A real masterpiece of a soundtrack.   Bravo, Neil,Bravo!!!

They must save a beautiful princess (Voiced by Cameron Diaz) for a future king (Voiced by John Lithgow) but the princess has a dark secret.<br />DVD`s has an clear Pan & Scan on the first disc and on the second has impressive anamorphic Widescreen (1.78:1) transfer. Strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound and also on DTS 5.1 Surround Sound. The film did win for an Oscar for Best Animated Feature, it was also Nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay. Included an running commentary track by the filmmakers. Pitch in Deleted Scenes. More extras with hidden features. One of the best films of 2001, an Instant Classic for the Young and Old. Grade:A.
B000006NPY|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins' Adore is to the Nineties what Pet Sounds was to the Sixties: an immaculately produced and recorded concept album. The sounds are haunting and are perfect for dreary weather and drowsy eyes. 1997 saw the band without their drummer, so frontman Billy Corgan made do with drum machines and session players. The resulting material relied much more on synthesizers and less on drums than their previous efforts. Guitars are prominant only on a few tracks, including \\"For Martha\\" and \\"To Sheila\\".<br />The keyboard, at one time an almost non-existant instrument on Pumpkins' albums, became the centerpiece for numerous songs - from the hypnotic piano line of \\"Blank Page\\" to the somewhat creepy synth of \\"Tear\\". No songs officially \\"rock out\\", but Corgan's melodies will still leave quite an impression.
6304014457|4.0|The linking of madness and death in the film is nothing out of the ordinary and it is, after all, not for this reason that the film remains famous to this day. Indeed, it is not the division between sane and insane that matters. What does matter is the use of Expressionism on screen. The visual texture of the film is evocative and startling, although to explain the Expressionism used as simply the example of a madman's vision is to undervalue the Expressionist movement as a whole.  <BR> The entire film is shot in a studio, ensuring absolute directorial control, and the sets are beautifully and laboriously created and set the entire mood for the film. It is perhaps useful to see the film as a tone poem where the style transcends the content. The oddness of the streets, with the strongly rectangular zigzag shapes, suggests violence and instability. Even light in the film is shaped, as is shown by the streaks of white paint on the wall of the prisoner's cell. The film scorns the natural world for a more indicative one; absolutely everything the viewer is presented is constructed. In this way, the viewer is guided towards a feeling, an inner world of meaning. The living room of Jane's house is one of the most memorable sets of the film. It shares the tranquillity of Franz Marc's Expressionist painting 'The Large Blue Horses' by its use of round shapes and soft colours. The room exudes health and well being. There are even flowers in the room, in the very middle of the frame. <br />The camera angles remain largely normal and level, although the film does frequently use the extreme close up to suggest inner violence and the fear of confinement. Nonetheless, the camera is intended to be unshocking and a thing the viewer can relate to: an assumed normal person looking at an extraordinary Holstenwall. <BR>The acting is rather melodramatic, as in most silent films, and the heavy make-up on Dr. Caligari and Cesare render them as much Expressionistic models as the sets. In thecase of Cesare, it seems the paint on the sets has been smudged onto his face. He is almost literally part of the set, which is indicated when he sets out for Jane's house, sliding along the walls and corridors. <BR>The film is very valuable to watch for its desire to be different and it is perhaps just as well that the story is not more original, as it would distract the viewer from the wealth of visual distinction available.
B000002N2Z|4.0|OK, this album is a great effort.  But please, Deftones, &quot;Bored&quot; has already been done 10 times better than this by Death Angel on Frolic Through the Park.
6305609721|4.0|I'm sure fans of Star Trek will forever debate which of the many films inspired by the show was the greatest.  It must be admitted by all that this fourth movie is definitely right up there.  The thing that really sets this movie apart from other Star Trek films is how accessable it is to those who aren't fans of the series or even science fiction in general.  By giving significant screen time to a character who makes fun of the &quot;space men&quot; and their erronious claim to have traveled back in time, the movie allows the series to laugh at itself, something it hadn't done previously.  A great Star Trek film and unlike some the others a great movie in general.
0783232039|2.0|To start off, I've never been a fan of the Child's Play films anyways.  But besides the point, I saw this film a few days ago- what the heck is this?????<br />When did Child's Play become a comedy?  There is nothing scary at all in this film anymore.  Back when Chucky was out hunting for Andy- it was scary, now it is just a waste.  Sure, I laughed a lot, but is that what this film was meant for?<br />Another point- After Chucky and Tiffany did &quot;their thing&quot; (how is that possible for plastic dolls???), how could the Tiffany doll produce a baby in less that a day???  STRANGE.<br />The acting wreaked- (the human people), and even the visual effects sucked.  From Chucky crawling on the sidewalk, to Jennifer Tilly getting electricuted in the bathtub- it was all bad.<br />The only stars for this film go to how stupidly funny it was, and Chucky's voice.<br />&quot;Hi, I'm Chucky... I wouldn't see this if I were you.&quot;
