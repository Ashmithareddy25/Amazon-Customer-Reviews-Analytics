B000X1Q2GM|5|Bunkers is a great product. Really works to ease pain of sore muscles. Works to ease pain tom sore joints.
B006X230Q0|4|I bought this item to replace a clipper/file combo that I have had for 30 years. I am in a wheelchair, so I occasionally break or split nails, and I need something I can carry with me all the time. This little combo is small enough to be very portable. I suppose it could be better if it was flatter, but then the clippers wouldn't work for toes, and that would reduce the marketability, so it's understandable the maker would want to keep as wide a market as possible.<br /><br />The file is small, but it works great, with almost an emery board surface for keeping a very soft finish for nails. The clippers are wide and very sharp, and the entire combination remains small enough to be easily portable in a bag hanging from my armrest. It should fit easily in a purse also, or even a pocket, though it might be a little inconvenient carried that way.<br /><br />I think it's a nice product, and very handy. It comes with a guarantee, which is unusual for almost any product these days. This is just what I was looking for...
B000RU374E|5|My skin looks younger everyday!  My friends notice the difference!
B005CSYTCU|1|These are awful...<br /><br />I had a pack of 500 multi-colored bands I bought at a department store. They were rubbery and lasted over 6 months, using daily on two girls.<br /><br />I bought these because they were clear and I wouldn't have to worry about matching outfits. What a mistake! These are so flimsy. They are ok holding up a tiny tuft on my one year old, but my 3 year old constantly looks like she just got in a fight with a hairbrush. They slide out of her hair ever time. They are slick and the band itself it rectangular. Unless you have thick hair these will fall out. Heck, I have thick curly hair and these fell out of mine!!!<br /><br />I'm going back to the rubbery multi-colored ones.<br /><br />These are cheap but not worth your time or the frustration of looking like a crazy haired fool...
B00JGZOBNC|5|Excellent
B00FI9BOE4|4|I thought this was a more ultra violet purple, but still a pretty lipstick! I definitely would recommend it yes, I would lol
B001GMANIU|3|I feel this product doesn't have a lot of moisture and seemed almost dry.  The brush is good to separate my lashes through.  I will not buy again...not even as good as a drug store brand.  Don't waste your money on the fancy brand.
B00E770EMQ|4|I loved these bangs the only thing I didn't like was the fact that it wasn't dark brown it was like a reddish burgandy color but other than that they cool
B005BZ2RLE|5|This is my favorite mineral make-up and I have tried quite a few. I use it in 'Almond' which is darker than most people like; but it works for me. I like this because: it blends well and never leaves a cakey, or flaked substance behind. It glides on very well and leaves nothing but a flawless airbrushed effect. It provides good coverage. You gauge how heavy of a coverage, by how much that you apply. You can always get an Avon rep to come by, if you don't want to buy before you try.
B0077LAJT2|5|My go to blades. Quick shipping. These (for me) are the perfect balance between sharpness & forgiving, and believe me I have tried them ALL. Once I found these I stopped using Feathers.
B00N31EAOK|3|It has a really runny formula and it does not go on as evenly as I thought it would. I like the color but it would be better if it were thicker or at least matte.
B009XPRZJW|5|look exactly like the picture , great product.
B0018QV1M6|5|great product it works very well has a nice bronzer in it and smells great.  Would recomend this product to use
B003TNITJO|5|I love the smell of this and so does my wife!!
B00021BPNI|5|If your looking for a nice scent to wear in an office envoriment. Then choose cool water .  If your looking for a nice evening scent, id go for ysl m7
B007FXZZWI|4|Hi there.<br /><br />Good deodorant, effective but I am not a man that perspire a lot. A bit of a smaller stick than anticipated and a bit harder to apply than anticipated too.<br />Overall satisfied of the product.<br />Worthwhile.
B004DTQ9L8|5|I have very oily acne prone skin and I was desperate to find something that would help. I read about argan oil and decided to give it a try. Let me just tell you.. I have not had one zit since using it, I am amazed! My skin looks beautiful and it's not oily at all anymore, I can go all throughout the day without having to blot. Also my acne scars are almost invisible. This is an amazing product and I wish I had found it sooner! Plus the price is hard to beat!
B004CG0RLK|5|Very pleased with this product.
B007JT7ARQ|4|good stuff
B004KRYXCK|5|Item shipped fast and I got it in a timely manner. Item works fine. Only concern was that it seemed as though it might have been opened at one point....eh, either way I clean anything before I use it. Overall happy with my purchase.
B0024JMXQY|4|Awesome mirror. Love the size and magnification
B008GRR21O|4|I ordered light brown & it looked almost blonde in the picture. No! it's a dark warm shade of brown. It was a suprise, but I love this wig! Its soft & super long. It looks SO real compared to others I've bought. The bangs are pretty as is, but I don't like pushing them to the side every so often, so i cut them long, just at my eyebrows & it looks great! Gives it more of a zooey deschanel look, but longer.
B00AB6D898|4|Excellent quality product, I just wish it had a fragrance. I've bought it before in a mango scent that was wonderful, would love to have been able to buy it again.
B002HEW7X0|4|A lot of people on here have seemed to make the mistake of using this tingler as their first tingle lotion, which is the mistake. Tingles are meant to make your skin red and feel itchy, etc, but a first time tingle user shoudl not start with this lotion. This is a high tingle lotion - you should start with a low sensation tingle and work your way up (I suggest packets so you can work your way up to a regular bottle and save yourself some money). An experienced tingle user should be fine with this lotion. It works well, smells decent, and is a good price.
B0083DWIR4|5|I have had this brush for about six months and it has been great.  I have noticed in the last month that two or three bristles have fallen out.<br /><br />I would recommend this brush for the price and quality.
B00VVX7AAI|5|This product is a total must have for summer, and there is so much product. Even though I use it every day, I<br />ll have it next year as well. A total must have
B00Q1NEGBE|4|😎
B003TQU1Q0|5|I love it! I will be ordering it again!
B002XXAUE8|4|I would highly recommend this make up case as a great xmas present for any young girl. There is a wide range of colours and shades, with a great variety of lips, eyes and cheeks. All in a handy carry case. Highly recommended.
B000N2JI2Q|5|BEST FACIAL TREATMENT EVER TO STAY LOOKING 10 YEARS YOUNGER when you are 40 something, and EVERYONE thinks your 20 or 30 something. Best product you can buy .
B00KFYZL8W|5|hope to receive this item with other cosmetic samples
B007MJGOZC|4|I got this yesterday and I used it for the first time today. Its actually larger than I expected and I'm thoroughly pleased by it. It goes it good and I can blend my eyeshadows together however it makes my eyeshadow muddy and I haven't had that issue before with other primers like ELF or Hard Candy. It's a good under eye concealer though and really is matte. It's a natural color is the best way I can put it.
B00PPPMFNU|3|Not sure if the heat made it clumpy but i liked the color
B006IB7JMM|5|Happy with this purchase.  I will buy again!!
B005K1UULI|3|It does the job of color changing but it chips very easily.
B00AGG3MNU|5|This is the best blade I've used to date.
B009JPHZ0K|5|A favorite of mine...wish they packaged it in larger tube.
B00GI21NW8|5|very easy to use!
B00GMP3O3W|5|I have used this for years and wow all of a sudden not for sale in stores so I'm trualy blessed
B00JHNV6LI|1|I am not pleased with this product at all. It started out beautifully. I wore the wig for about 5 days and the texture and look changed completely.
B00ACC4KPM|5|Believe it or not, here in S. California, it is extremely difficult to find these sorts of hair pins here.  Or they are the thin, bendable wire pins that don't hold up at all.<br /><br />I am so happy with this purchase!  I have long, thick, wavy hair and I can easily use two or three of these pins to put up my hair in twists and buns.  They hold all day long!<br /><br />I'm so happy with this purchase and I'll buy these again when I run out, or before, just in case to have them on hand.
B00HURGXYI|1|Need to tone down this extreme orange color... Feels like you should work on the chocolate factory after one use
B006GQYSC8|5|I have always used electric shavers and this is the best one I have had so far. It cuts very close. It does not take long to shave. I love how it is waterproof and you can clean it each time simply by running it under the faucet.  Awesome!
B00LD0JGAG|5|this is a wonderful comb. the handle gets darker with use.
B00006RVJ4|3|As with the case of many regular razors, the male model always hits the shelves first; once the female version comes around it's  often the same product in pink with an aloe strip, or in some cases far inferior. Such is the same of many women's electric shavers. From what I can tell, most lack the power and sharpness their male counterparts have. I bought this shaver a few months ago from drugstore.com for $34.99, and have been much disappointed.<br />Pros: Decent price. It holds a charge for a respectable period of time, and works in the shower or tub.<br />Cons: It's very slow with its less-than-sharp blades! You have to go over an area many times to get it right, although doing so doesn't result in any ill effects other than lost time. Its size is also not suited for the bikini area.<br />All in all, as it was my first electric shaver, perhaps my expectations were too high. I'll stick to borrowing my boyfriend's electric razor when he's not looking.
B000JLEUVA|4|So Happy I was able to purchase this product impossible to find in stores bought it for a Christmas gift
B00JBCH312|5|My daughter smells good all day!
B0009X74PC|4|I decided to try the product after seeing Anastasia on an episode of Oprah. Being cautious, I ordered the smaller/travel version Eyebrow Express, rather than order the full size kit.  The product seems to work great.  The stencils are wonderfully accurate.  Initially, they took a bit to maneuver, but I applied some facial toner to alleviate some of the skin oil in the brow area and this worked well. Next time, I may try the other readers suggestion for using fabric tape. The only drawback is the powder appeared too dark for my complexion.  I may try another readers suggestion of applying it more lightly and/or filling with an eyebrow pencil and hopefully the results will improve. Other than that, I am very satisfied.
B005H8PP9Q|1|Doesn't work. Doesn't crackle. Not worth buying. Looks chaulky but doesn't crackle. A waste of money. Don't bother buying this brand.
B000O3UC0Q|4|I live in a very arid climate and winter time is particularly drying to my skin.  This lotion does a great job moisturizing my whole body and seems to last about six- eight hours.  Very quickly absorbed, I can put my clothes on right after application.  Is it only me?  -- but I sometimes detect a very slight \\"burnt\\" odor.  Not enough to make me look for another lotion, however.  This does the job.
B005YXG58O|5|Fantastic scent and nice lather.
B003V264WW|5|Best hair dryer ever. Super high power. I dunno if it has something to do with the &#34;ionize&#34; part , but it actually thickens up my hair. I'm 46 and it's getting a little thinner up top and man this thing does wonders for bringing a fullness to my hair. Can't go wrong with this one.
B007WO933W|1|was not the same smell that I wanted
B0045IZ9Z4|5|I love this tongue scraper, Each one can last you 6 months before you have to switch to a new one. The price is reasonable and will buy again when I need one,
B00LM3L90Y|4|Is it safe to use this cream while pregnant ?
B004A376H8|4|the person I bought it for carries his spiritual books & has the symbol tattooed on him.<br />He really liked it.
B00BW5L4RA|5|After knowing this brand is what my hairdresser uses on my hair, I love the results..., after many years I finally spent the money to get one myself (after my Conair was worn out!). I am very happy with it!!! I was able to register it, but the hologram number was not on the cord as indicated, it was on the inside of the styling tool near the on off switch.
B00T5VO8DK|5|Fit perfect.<br />Somewhat stretchy for various size feet.<br />Color was perfect match.<br />Shipped faster than expected.
B002CVTVVY|4|This is a quality toothbrush.  It arrives with more than one brush, which allows my husband and I to both use the toothbrush.  It also includes a sanitizer feature, which I really like.
B006LYO4A6|5|This has improved my skin overall. Lines are diminished, less blemishes, skin is softer. I use in tandem with the pink daytime one.
B005Q7F4N0|4|When I use this product on dry hair, it does as good a job as any I have found at taming my frizz while not weighing down my waves.
B003XDM2DY|5|I've tried lots of lipgloss and love this.  It's not sticky an will not dry your lips out.  In the winter I had really chapped lips from other products and this was my solution.  Try it and you will love it too!
B005I2MP62|5|I have been pleased with every RoC product I have tried, and these disks are no exception. They are like the Cadillac of disposable make-up removers/ skin cleansers, a far cry from the thin little towelettes in the plastic pouches I have tried before. Each thick pad is thoroughly saturated with cleanser, they foam up nicely, and the soft side is gentle enough to use to remove mascara and eye make-up, while the textured side invigorates and refreshes like a mini facial. Now that I am getting older I have developed a keen appreciation for skin care, and this is one of my top five products I would recommend to anyone who wants to keep their skin looking its best. Excellent!
B005XIM6J2|4|The fine-tipped Q-tips are great for hobbies and crafts, but not so great for ear cleaning. I realize many people, including myself, have found many other uses for these cotton swabs other than cleaning out the Dumbo muscles, so the company decided to create these swabs for better precision. They're a bit softer than I'd like, but certain able to get at finer areas than the regular ones.<br />Just be careful if you're using them as actual ear cleaners; used on the other day, and accidentally went too deep. It hurt quite a bit!
B00SXSKP1U|2|I have been using this for the past month and im sad to say i haven't seen much. The color of my stretch marks has gotten the slightest bit lighter, but other than that, no other results. The texture is nice, however it has an unappealing scent i just cant get over. Hopefully it works for you, but didn't for me.
B006BHM0FE|5|Great lashes! I was very satisfied.
B00B407KAI|5|The blades meet along the whole length and work well on fairly thick toenails. The latch is little difficult but works, the plastic sleeve is handy
B006LRRQK8|5|My lashes got here super fast after I ordered them...I LOVE the lashes...they are so flattering and I adore them.  Great service, fast, and I can't complain at all.  Wonderful job.  Just ordered some more from Yonelay!
B001ECQ7G4|4|great price from amazon. recommended by my waxer. stings a bit but overall it works well.
B002HWS9FW|5|I love, love, love the Oral B Pro-Health Precision Clean Battery Toothbrush!<br /><br />Granted this model doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the fancy rechargeable (plug-in) models, but at only a fraction of the price, I promise you, it gets the job done, perfectly!<br /><br />And overall it is even a better brush than the less expensive Crest Spin Brush (which I also like very much) as the smaller head allows for more thorough cleansing of each individual tooth.<br /><br />The oscillating bristles thoroughly cleans and massages the tooth, tongue and gum areas of the mouth and leave the areas feeling very clean and refreshed.<br /><br />And combined with daily flossing (with regular dental floss) --and weekly use of my handy dandy Waterpik Oral Irrigator (the one with 6 interchangeable heads including the tiny tooth irrigator--so awesome!) and monthly use of my GUM plaque hook scale/scraper thingy, my teeth have absolutely no plaque issues and are looking better than ever.<br /><br />The prices vary greatly on this automatic toothbrush, and sometimes the other stores mark the prices up, but it should still be possible to find them on-sale for less-than $12each, so compare prices carefully before buying-- as they always have them on-sale for between $9-$14per toothbrush, and while it's really good to be able to find them here, consistently like this, on Amazon and also there's another outlet that might be helpful:<br /><br />Ob.factoryoutletstore.com<br /><br />(On a side note: If you are trying to move towards more holistic cleansing, you can try Burt's Bees All-natural Toothpaste OR Tom's of Maine Total Care All-Natural Toothpaste, OR if you're up for it, you can make your own cleansing tooth powder with equal parts Baking Soda, (freshly ground) unrefined Sea Salt and Calcium Magnesium powder and voila, all-natural Re-Mineralizing tooth powder! A great natural-whitening and tooth re-mineralizing powder to supplement your all-natural toothpaste-- and a great way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)<br /><br />Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!<br /><br />Grade: A, or Five Stars!t way to save money on those messy whitening strips and help the environment in the long term as well.)<br /><br />Overall, this little toothbrush gives great bang for the buck (a great buy)!<br /><br />Grade: A, or Five Stars!
B000Z4SQ8E|5|This face wash is my new favorite.  It even helps stop my hormone-related break outs as soon as they start every month.  It has a very creamy and rich texture after being lathered up, and leaves your face feeling very clean but not dry.  The first couple weeks I used it, it kind of stung my face so I only used it at night.  Now I use it two times a day and my skin has never been this clear.    In conjunction with this wash, I use a small amount of the Kose brand \\"Sekkisei\\" emulsion at night after I wash my face.  The next morning after this routine, my skin feels satisfyingly smooth and soft.
B0000VC1YC|5|My wife and I use this for massages and to relieve dry skin itch.<br />It's a very light oil and is easily absorbed in to the skin. It feels great when using it for massages and isn't at all greasy like some oils. The scent is very pleasant (a big plus).<br />You can also add it to your bath water if you like a bath oil.<br />This is a big bottle and is much better value than the smaller sized bottles available on Amazon.
B000BTO6CI|5|I chose this item because I get a lot of compliments when I wear Jessica McClintock Eau De Parfum Spray. I buy it from Amazon because the price is right.<br />  Thank You!
B004L5HHR4|5|Every girl should have a set of these to help with hair styling. I use these to hold all my hair up when curling, hot ironing or rolling my hair. They are like an extra set of hands.
B0027P9DQI|5|I've used Oxy Maximum Deep Cleaning Face Wash for years now.  It is very low priced compared to other name brands and is even cheaper if you use Amazon's \\"Subscribe and Save\\".  The Deep Cleaning wash is a stronger face wash than most of the other products I've tried, but it doesn't irritate my skin.  Note that it doesn't have any exfoliating beads like some competing products.  That is good for me since exfoliating beads make my face turn red from irritation.  This face wash is a clear face wash based on Salicylic acid, aloe, and a few other compounds.  Oxy has another wash called \\"Daily Face Wash\\" which is based on Benzoyl Peroxide.  Make sure you know which product you are selecting based on your preference.  I find the \\"Deep Cleaning\\" face wash to work best for me.
B002P8ZF0K|5|Very Handy Trimmer at a very Good Price
B006GWDBZ2|1|This product is a great product, but I would not buy from this seller again or buy something this expensive from a third party.  I'm a professional nail tech and I found out the hard way that nail harmony does not honor the warranty from third party vendors.  My lamp was having sensor issues just as it was approaching the one year mark from date of purchase.  Beauty Land 4 U was contacted immediately.  They were prompt with their responses but had no solution, they wanted me to send them my lamp for them to look  at without sending me any replacement in the interm.  When I contacted Nail Harmony they were unwilling to work with me and unapologetic about there policies and offered no assistance.  As a professional nail tech this was a very unsatisfactory experience with both of these parties that ended in an unresolved issue and a unhappy client.
B00JUBQM9S|5|Great cream. The only thing no would change is the smell.
B0016AJAA4|5|Love this so much! I use it after applying my 3D fiber lash mascara to just clean up a bit and it folds up to go right in the case! Best ever!
B00HD1ERF8|4|I have been using the original blades and outer foil set for a year, I noticed that the blades were dragging while cutting my beard, like a lawn mower mowing high grass, also my face was starting to irritate me after shaving, I do use pre and after electric shave lotion, but it was due to the dullness of the blades. I bought this blade and foil set and they make my shaver shave like new again smooth with no irritation. What I don't like about them is the price, that is why I gave it four stars instead of five
B000OYJ8UU|5|I have dry skin, and have used many very expensive products, but I have to say this one is my favorite right now!!! It smells wonderful and the nice scent lasts a very long time. For moisturizing, I'd give it six stars if that were possible. My feet love it, as it seems to absorb well and not leave a greasy feeling, but does feel moisturized. Some moisturizers wear off. This one lasts!!
B00PUYEQLA|4|I received a free product for the purpose of my review.<br />Opinions are 100% my own.<br /><br />I have been experimenting with different facial serums lately. Recently I received a 1oz bottle of Foxbrim’s Peptide Complex Serum to review.  Foxbrim’s Peptide Complex Serum works to effectively create a healthy environment for beautiful skin. Working from the inside out, Peptides signal the body for additional collagen production. Moisturizing agents Hyaluronic Acid & Vitamin E effectively hydrate while maintaining healthy skin balance.<br /><br />The Serum has a consistency of Aloe, it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly into the skin. It smells faintly of Witch Hazel and it is not overwhelmingly strong.<br /><br />Foxbrim’s states their products are crafted with the most sensitive of skin types in mind. They use natural moisturizing agents so their serums provide results without the worry of drying or irritation. Perfect for dry and under-nourished skin. For that healthy, natural glow. Their products are crafted in the USA in an FDA certified facility utilizing only premium ingredients in their natural and organic products. NO additives, silicones or parabens. Not tested on animals.
B00M49SG0Q|1|Used one time. Can not stand the smell.
B004SY5F0O|2|When I was looking for bubble baths products for my kids, I saw this picture which shows 6 different bottles and thought that this maybe fun to have 6 different scents every night. I only received a big one of them not small 6 bottles. I was so disappointed. Not just 1 scent but also I could not choose the scent. It's an ok product, but I will not buy this again for this price.
B00C5AHTC0|2|There is not enough moisture in these wipes to be effective.
B008A199BM|5|Absolutely love this product and the pricing. I paid 20.00 for something I would have paid potentially 100 dollars more if bought at a retail store. Works awesome. I previously had a Cortex tourmaline ceramic flat iron. It got up to 450 degrees. Right away I noticed that I had a lot less breakage (barely any)than when I used the other one. The hair glides through the plates. Heats up fast. Me and my sister have thick Afro American hair and this does the job for the both of us. I just have to get my sister to get her own!
B000ALDK1A|5|Had a bottle of this from probably 10 years ago that I always kept in the fridge to put on if I got a sunburn.  We moved recently, and it seems it got lost in the packing and unpacking.  Couldn't find it anywhere locally, but Amazon came to my rescue getting it to me overnight.<br /><br />This is the BEST stuff to put on after a burn.  So cool and soothing, and doesn't dry your skin out.  Be wary of other products that have little or no actual aloe vera in them, even though they have &#34;aloe&#34; in their name.  I have never once peeled or had discomfort for more than ~2 days if I start applying this stuff the same day of a burn.
B001THXPB4|1|I bought this at TJ Maxx for $25. I borrowed my friend's curling iron, and was looking to make some big beachy waves at home. This thing doesn't work. I put it on the medium setting to get a feel for it, it didn't curl my hair. I turned the heat up to 450 degrees and waited for it to heat up and tried again... still wouldn't curl my hair. I know how to use a curling iron... this thing just flat out doesn't work. I'm going to return it for a refund.
B008FP6KBU|5|Great my wife loves it!!<br /><br />Totally inexpensive for the value you obtain for it<br /><br />Its a very smart purchase, I hope we can do business in future
B000SC1IU6|5|Good product. Well made.
B001MA0QY2|5|super nice, very hot! Does not have a &#34;lock&#34; mechanism to hold it together so if you have kids or are prone to mishaps be careful! It works really well and takes me a fraction if the time to &#34;fix&#34; my hair than with other irons.
B001CJCFBK|5|I have been very happy with this line of skin care.  i have only used it for 6 weeks and can see results.  I is just slightly more expensive than the major brands, but since it works, it is worth it!
B00BQYF220|4|Love the product but it came leaking in the packaging and I lost a bit of product in the leak :/
B0063FK83U|5|Adds the perfect amount of volume and texture to my hair, with a little added shimmer. 2-4 pumps are all that is needed for shorter hair.
B000068PBT|5|Great Philips quality and long life. I always used Gillette razors, but they became so expensive and dull within a week. My Phillips stays sharp and there's no plastic going into landfill every week. Great products!
B00KPKIV8I|3|I don't see much efficacy in this product.
B00BERP5CG|5|Love them
B007L65XA8|4|It smells amazing but I don't see too much of a diference. I do think it is good though. Still unsure if will buy again. I did just buy the whole line of shampoo and conditioner.
B005P0UT3S|5|Love the cream! Very satisfied with the transaction.
B001AH5TM6|2|I expected good things from this straightener. Afterall, it is a Hot Tools brand. And the first time I used it, it worked great, but as I continued to use it, the heat would not stay constant, and it was definitely not hot enough to straighten my hair. I had to straighten a very small piece at a time several times over to get it to work. I was under the impression that you could use this straightener as a regular one, where you plug the cord directly into the straightener, no the base. However, that is not possible because it goes into charging mode as soon as you do this. I was not impressed. I was tempted to call Hot Tools for a refund, but I didn't want the hassle. Not a great buy on my part. So I bought a Chi instead and it works great.
B00246OPG8|4|use them for my kegel exercises, not comfortable but I think  at least helps to regain a little bit of pelvic muscle
B00J9QXSZ0|4|This works pretty well.  I found that it clumps fairly easily but I think some of that is user error.  I seem to get better the more I use it.  It can be applied multiple times to make lashes look fuller.
B006ZBP8NM|5|I had severe adult acne when i stopped breast feeding due to hormonal changes . I used some topical treatement to cure acne which stopped any new acne from popping . But the treatment did not help me with the acne scars . Thats when i came across this peel . To begin with i used this peel along with the topical medication my doctor prescribed and the result was magical .All the scars faded over a period of 3 months .I recommend using it once a week as you want to allow new skin cells to generate. It is so simple to use, but it's very important to be careful on how you prep your skin and how long you leave it on. I don't have sensitive skin normally but if i leave the peel on too long i get red blotches . Thats why i follow all the instructions to T . DO NOT USE THIS PEEL IF YOU HAVE ACTIVE ACNE .Wait till all your acne have dried out and there are no pink\red acne on your face . If you have active acne using this peel might give you more acne as this peels the top layer of skin exposing surrounding skin to active acne bacteria . These are the steps i follow<br />1. I was my face with a gentle face wash . Do not use a scrub else your skin will burn during the time of peel application .<br />2. Wipe the face with mild alcohol face wipe to free it of any left over oil and open pores .<br />3. Use a brush to apply the peel all over the skin avoiding eyes and lips<br />4. Leave on for about 2 - 3 minutes. Never leave it for too long as it might give you burned blotchy skin and red patched .<br />5. Wash off with cold water and  finish with moisturizing lotion.
B004R7IYLE|2|Broke 3rd time I wore it.  I still wear it broke but it shouldn't have broke.  Altogether I have bought 4.  2 are broke and 2 are fine.  Not the best odds.
B00K72JFK2|5|Did the job, color not as shown and started to tangle and fall apart half way through the night but for the price was worth every penny
B00181H7AQ|3|I really love the Tokidoki packaging!  I was surprised at how light these shadows were. They are not super-deeply pigmented, and work best as \\"daytime\\" shadows for highlighting/shadowing.
B002MO9BW0|5|Fabulous solution for we mothers of children with wildly curly hair and little patience. I'm ready to buy it by the case.
B0009VIS7M|5|Works great. Very oily skin. Gets rid of the shine all day. No touch ups needed and I live in the hot humid south. I mix it with my foundation  and a little moisturizer in the mornings and it lasts all day shine free. I really notice a major difference when I don't use it.
B0020MMDHO|5|Excelent
B000FYVOJC|5|Excellent
B00C3O9OJE|1|Although I love korres product it was way overpriced for what I ordered all tiny trial sizes :/ and on my package the price tag of $16.80 was left on when I paid $35 needless to say I returned it !!!
B0079R6BD2|5|it is a great product.I love it. The smell is good. More importantly, it works.
B002SMXEFG|5|Dove has created an amazing product that soothes and relieves the skin from winter itch. Its light lather leaves your skin soft, silky, and so very smooth. Everytime I use it, I'm transported to sun-shined island with a warm gentle breeze while angels sing and play their harps in the background. It truly makes the skin feel just that wonderful. Great job Dove, keep up the good work.
B00336EUTK|5|I loved crest whitestrips, and I love the fact that I was able to purchase them as a lower price than the stores! Overall great purchase.
B00I5GGJ3S|1|did not receive the eyelash mascara wand brush set. Instead I had received some set of nail art tools/brushes
B000296DVY|5|My son used to get terrible diaper rashes and our doctor told us to use this mixed with an equal part of liquid ant-acid, generic ant-acid with real Aquaphor worked just fine.  We got rid of his rashes this way in less than two days.  I did try to use just Aquaphor and it worked too but not as fast.  The Mylanta must do something, maybe cut the acid in the poo?
B00K19S45S|4|It's not my favorite dye, but it comes in a close second! Special Effects is my favorite, although the purple in this brand stayed longer for me. It just depends on your hair and what it holds. It bleeds for me, but so does Special Effects and every temporary dye I've ever used. I've tried the pink, purple, and turquoise of this brand. They have all worked great for me and are available here and at Sally's Beauty Supply and are $5-$6 cheaper than Special Effects. Nice and thick too so you can dilute it with conditioner.<br /><br /> I will agree with others that the color of the turquoise and purple look blue when you first put it on, but that fades pretty quickly into the  color it says. It's pretty obvious in the bottle what the color is though so I don't know why people are all shocked when it comes out that color on their head. Just dilute it with some conditioner until it's the color you want, and make sure to lighten/bleach your hair first if you want it to come out the right color. Have fun!
B01118NN30|5|Going  out with friends with the hubby  to the mall to the movies party dinner no matter  where  look pretty  and rock these pretty metallic  tattoos they add easy  last long and look just so pretty  it can match  with anny outfits  even though  with bikinis  yes!! I recommend  this  pretty  metallic  tattoos  they are awesome  and good  quality! !!<br /><br />I received  this product  in exchange  for  my honest  review. ..
B00HRWW6BA|5|Excellent for boating
B00I6CRX7W|5|Love this product. Smells really good and cleans just as nice. Recommend and would order again. Thanks !
B000ETN90A|5|I have been using Samsara Parfume and ED Toilette for over 20 years!  My daughter-in-law introduced me to Samsara and I have been so greatful for that.  It has become my signature fragrance.  I am very sensitive to odors and this one pleases me and everyone I come in contact with. Men, in general, are relunctant to comment about perfumes but they have been plentiful in noticing Samsara.  Women have asked me numerous times what fragrance I am wearing, whether it is in an elevator or in a check-out line.  It enhances the feeling of feminity and I love it! I know the product and am ordering another one from Amazon.
B00152S1IK|5|This is the work of a master perfumer. It has many layers and is hard to define. I just know that I need to have a bottle at all times on my vanity. The scent lasts longer on me when I use the eau de parfum rather than the cologne, which wears off quickly on my skin. I think all Creed products are of high quality. Millesime Imperial is unique, and people will always ask &#34;What is that you're wearing? It's fabulous.&#34;
B00070E8LA|5|Make no mistake about it, this machine is incredibly powerful. I have thick straight hair and this machine cuts without any pulling no matter how fast I go. The construction is solid and the blades will last forever as long as they're resharpened every few years. I've tried other machines and even when they work just as well, they somehow manage to feel cheap. I would highly recommend this set of clippers.
B004FX9D24|3|Since we lost/misplaced the cords for two razors, we think we'll eventually find at least one of them. However, in the meantime we were running out of power on the razors so had to &#34;do something now&#34;. This stop-gap cord is flimsy and not nearly as sturdy as the originals, but it certainly fills a need for now.
B00365DABC|5|Great lightweight moisturiser which doesn't break me out. I also like the pump bottle and how the pump can be twisted to turn on and off.
B000V4QZG8|5|Got this for my daughter. I liked it so well I am getting my own. So small and does a great job. Smooth......
B00429KR12|4|I think is necessary to post some pics from the inside of the bag, how does it looks? Color, size, shape, etc
B005EWF284|4|buen producto
B00005V50B|5|Love this toothpaste.  I have used it for years because my dentist recommended it and because it really does work to maintain tooth whiteness.  You only need a small pea-sized amount and a dry toothbrush to use it effectively.
B008JHO8DG|5|Exactly like the soap we brought back from Newcastle, Australia. Which we loved, but ran out of. Keep making this!
B004977LVQ|5|This product works awfully well for me.  I use it most days in the morning.  It renews the body and volume and adds shine.  I was devastated when it became unavailable at QVC.  But Amazon has saved the day (again).  So relieved I could find it here.
B00H7M32FO|5|Really excited to use this
B000PKZG22|2|this was very pricey for all that was in tube. i have used it for a month and absolutely NO results. I think it should perform for the price but did not
B002S8PU02|5|BEST EYEBROW PENCIL EVER! My colleagues didn't even notice I filled my eyebrows in. They thought I just grew more hair haha
B00CLILRMY|5|Love it!!
B0013G6H5W|3|I lie that it's natural but the floss splits and breaks very easily, leaving remnants in your teeth. It's not coated.
B0019NA0S4|5|I am happy with this magnifier.  The light is a great addition and it does not distort the object being magnified too much.
B00EEQCNQ0|4|I read the reviews on here before I purchased the product, and I knew that some of the clips could arrive broken.  However, the cheapest set of clips I've found prior has been at Walmart, where you get 10 for 2 bucks.  So even if some of the 100 were broken, it's still a great bargain; I've only had one broken one thus far.  I also don't see a whole lot of difference in quality between these and the ones I brought at Walmart either.  They seem fairly durable.
B00I1B3HIC|1|why this product have chinese and thai on it? it should be a japanese product, as a chinese, i don't really believe it.
B004R7N55O|5|Love them very durable for a hard teaser.
B00CDD7YU6|5|This is the only product I've ever found that actually lifts (and gives some height) to my long hair. I was sad when I heard that Redken had replaced it with another product that satisfied no one. When I searched amazon, I found the original BodyFull Weightlifter here, and at a reasonable price. I'm very happy to have it again and delivery was prompt.
B003WMVIYK|5|I love this item. It came right on time and the design is cute. I was very surprised by how big it is. All my stuff fits in it that I use on a daily basis such as makeup, hair accessories, glamour tools etc with room to spare, plus I can still roll it up and carry with me when I travel. I was skeptical at first but I am not disappointed. I would highly recommend.
B004Z209HS|5|I love this oil and put them on my face my hair its not to grease just what I've been looking for I don't usually do reviews for the stuff that I buy but this stuff really deserve it review
B00LNOKBYW|5|It even straightens my curly hair. I love this product. it smoothed my hair down and the curls lasted for days. You know the sound you hear 'cush&#34; the frying your hair sound of a regular curling iron, well this curling iron did not make a sound and made my hair smooth and silky.
B004IBYRCO|3|Great lasting product, but the product kept coming out of the casing
B00DPE9EQO|1|This product does not work....I can not wait to get my full vitamin C serum today!!! With phloretin CF!!
B005KSBVHI|2|I have used it many times and I don’t see any difference.  Nobody could tell I have even put it on.
B005LP5AA4|5|I wasn't expecting much from this product, but I was leaving for vacation and wanted a quick fix to help nudge my body into slightly better shape.<br /><br />Before- be realistic.  Don't expect to eat poorly and watch TV all day and maintain your results.  I'm 5'3\\" and had lost 10 pounds with eating properly and exercising daily.  I was hovering around 120 when I did my first wrap.  The area is large and you can cut the wrap if you want to cover a smaller area than your abs.  It seems flimsy at first, but is actually very durable.  It stays put, but I put on a very fitted tank top to hold it in place.<br /><br />During- The feeling is very tingly, like Icy Hot, but not as intense.  I have sensitive skin and I was fine with it.  It's kind of soothing.<br /><br />After- I took off the wrap and noticed an immediate difference.  Although I'm thin, I still had a slight cellulite-y appearance on my stomach.  It was gone.  My skin was very firm and I even lost a line on my lower abs that always drove me inside...It's just a crease from having fat there. There was still cream left on my skin so I rubbed it in and put the tank top back on.  I've already lost an inch in the past 7 hours and I can feel myself shrinking more!  I always drink a lot of water and will continue to do so.<br /><br />Overall- This is a great final step to weight loss.  Even if I didn't lose an inch, I'd still be happy with how smooth and firm my skin feels.  I would highly recommend this to anyone undergoing weight loss surgery so the skin can start firming up now.  I will write a follow-up review after 72 hours..
B004Y9M0YM|5|I love the feel of this on my lips! I love the flavor and the way my lips looked after about two days of using this(:
B005I465E8|5|Bought this for a gift she loved it
B003V21WO2|5|The price and the product are just right. It's a great value for what you're paying. The only catch is that you need to have time to get salon results or in other words, 5 to 10 minutes are not gonna leave your hair the way you want it. Besides that, no complains.
B00E9IQUKI|5|Amazing product!!!
B0034B4YDG|4|Very nice.  Coats hair well.  Works well with quality moisturizing conditioner for smoothing effect.  For some reason, the mate conditioner actually made my hair frizzy.
B00AHF1GK6|4|I received the razors free as part of a promotion from BzzAgent.<br /><br />The razors are extremely easy to use and provide a very comfortable shave. I have some trouble areas on my face, which I regularly nick, but these handled it with ease. I would highly recommend these to anyone in search of a good disposable razor.<br /><br />The one downside is that the razor area does feel a bit large as compared to others I have used. The size makes getting used the control of the razor a bit more time consuming than others, but manageable once picked up.
B01133WPJQ|5|Great Product!  I would keep my hand over my teeth before using Shine Whitening.  I was so embarrassed.  After three times of using this gel I could see a great improvement. The best way for me was to use a qtip to apply to my teeth. I endorse this product.  I can smile again!
B000NFB8S0|5|i have tried most of the expensive shower gels and body washes, including doctor bronner's. for those of us athletes who shower frequenty, getting some moisture locked-in during a shower is a MUST. the gels are simply too drying (a by-product of all gels? that seems to be the case. if your skin is dry, i would steer clear of any shower 'gel'). most body washes as more-or-less equal. this one, however, is not. it provides ALOT of moisturizing. more than any i've tried thus far. even the puff was high quality. the price was right, and with Amazon Prime, it arrived in one business day for no shipping charge at all (they said 2, but it arrived in 1 - so did everything else i ordered that day). pleased? oh, yeah!
B00156C2EU|5|I have closely spaced teeth and food particles get stuck frequently. I have tried other brush picks, but these are the best. They are thin enoough to get into the tighest spaces yet strong enough to do an excellent job of dislodging those pesky food particles.
B0081SSF0A|5|Excellent foot cream.  Like it very much, but it smells a little bit.
B003F6VJ9C|4|This product works well for my fine straight hair. My only wish is that it had no scent. It's a little &#34;rosey&#34; in smell.
B000V76ALU|5|I am so thankful that I found this product.  I have semi-dry skin and a light complexion and this evens everything out perfectly.  It is well worth the money spent.  I will continue to use this in my morning routine.
B0013E5J62|5|excellent
B00JAJNDZ6|3|I started Hairfinity a month ago and definetly notice a difference in length.
B0065JCV84|5|This stuff works awesome just like Layrite but cheaper!! Has a diff smell but still really good! I def will be purchasing this more in the future
B009YSTOAG|5|I will be ordering again! Turned out exactly as expected!
B00D2PF1SG|4|I just started using it , it feels good but still it is too early to rate this product.
B001QGENHI|5|There were a LOT more tattoos than I needed in the package, but the price was still very cheap.  Great for birthday party goodie bags.
B00H6J2ZT2|5|I really love these brushes and for the money, you can't beat them. I love the carrying case and will use these when I travel. Some brushes have an issue with chemical smells right out of the box but these did not. I washed them and they held up nicely. There has been no fallout with these, either. They pick up product and blend nicely while not wasting anything. I recommend these, for sure!
B00AQHH3WA|4|I like the shampoo & infra treatment, my hair is very nappy but it felt really soft with the infra treatment. be careful with the keratin, it can knot your hair really bad, that's why blow drying with comb is important. I self administered, my roots aren't as straight as I had hoped, but i like it, its better than the ones with formaldehyde. I have washed it ones since using & my hair comes out a bit, I still have perm & natural since I am still in transition. We will see.
B00GB01UFW|5|Works like a charm on bringing out such a great natural glow to your skin. Happy to say that there are no chemicals being put on my face and it feels so smooth and not weighed down.
B001DKQ47E|5|I looked all over locally for these bulbs. Couldn't find the correct wattage. Finally found some on a light bulb website and the shipping cost was twice the cost of the bulbs. Amazon was a great deal especially when I leveraged with other orders for free shipping.
B000OZI8HS|5|I loved this stuff when I was pregnant.  I do wish it was a little cheaper though.
B007KPYAE0|2|I got this for my 6month-old for our beach vacation.  Upon extensive research, it was the most natural sunscreen for the SPF.  What I didn't know was that it would separate after being in my beach bag for one afternoon.  NO JOKE it separates... into an oily and white curdle mess.  I don't know if when it separates like this, the SPF is still effective?  Anyways, most of the tube went unused because of this. It was a big waste of money.
B005GL4AVI|1|This product was easily breakable and tooo too stretchy.  I was not able to use the entire pack.  It was as if is dry rotted.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B003I6O5RC|5|The first mascara that didn't make my eyes water. I love this stuff. Easy to wash off too.
B000GCKBUQ|1|Cheap sponges- that's all this product is. You're better off using cotton balls. The washable filter provided with a wet-dry vac is thicker and studier than this.
B00NN0PNV0|5|Love this case! It looks even better than the picture.
B00N4QK07A|5|a Christmas gift for my granddaughter she loves it
B0047F70B6|5|I purchased two of these for a friend. She uses the product on a regular basis and has good things to say about it.
B004NMYR96|5|On time and good quality.
B003983HZK|5|Best razor I've ever used. Tried other brands of 3- 5 blade razors occasionally and nothing compares. I get about a month out of each refill although I usually don't shave on weekends. My wife says they are the bomb and work better than the lady fusion razors.
B001JQLNH8|5|i really like these because they give me a better shave than i have had in a long time.  since they are OEM, they are better than the disposable head knock offs i have purchased on ebay
B001BODNYO|2|Not enough power and trimmers don't cut close! Not happy with 'em!!!
B00V4PX9XK|4|I love the idea of the product, but the quality isn't amazing. It does work well, but most of the tools are very similar to each other. The metal seems like it will rust easily and even when the case is fully zipped, the tools can fall out. I don't hate it, but the quality isn't that great.
B004ZU4DTU|5|I absolutely love this eye shadow highlighter!  So glad I can find it online!!!
B0046V2XA4|4|It lasts more than 20 uses but since I have just used 1, I cant tell that there was a remarkable change in the appearance of my cellulite behind my thighs...
B000GIL12C|3|its a good seller. Recomended
B007404LAY|5|excelente
B00CPJZP0E|1|I was sent product missing a important part in order to work  thank You
B00IFF03RC|4|I wish Victoria's Secret would bring back the cleansing oils. This one was my favorite.  Unlike some other oils this was fairly watered down, which made it fine for the summer.  The regular body wash is too drying for me so it really responded well to a little bit of oil  There is not a lot of foaming (which is a sign of detergent), but I know some people do not think they are clean without it.  I use this like body wash, although you could pour it my the capful into the tub.
B00JX979CQ|5|Very helpful in easing discomfort of joints.  I use it all of the time.  I really wouldn't want to be without Emu Oil and like this particular type because of the way it dispenses the oil.  It has helped me a lot by easing my arthritis.
B002AQF3PO|5|A++++all the way!
B0032CDFCS|5|The best brush to apply powder with!
B000SDKCHK|2|This mirror was hard to use because it was confusing to the eyes and the light was not bright enough. Not the best purchase.
B0057JCYYE|5|I have had Gelish done at the nail salon and liked it. I thought I would try the home kit. It is the exact same quality as the professional salon product. I followed the instructions and it came out exactly like in the salon. The key is to make sure all the coats are thin. If you paint the coats too thick, they won't cure correctly and may start to peel after a few days. It lasts about 2-3 weeks depending on how fast your nails grow.
B00LUBNPPU|5|I love the designed
B0002DM77Y|5|Love this perfume... the scent is a little strong at first but once it settles on you, the scent is beautiful and lasts throughout the day!  Thanks!
B000PKZFFK|5|I've used this product for approximately 4 years.  My eyes are extremely sensitive and this is the only product I've found that does not irritate them.  I cannot use waterproof mascara so I can only comment on what I do use and this remover does the trick easily and well.
B00ENW4Y3U|5|Good product
B004825USS|5|This was a good buy! It has made a difference in the way my hair lays down without being sticky or full of alcohol. My hair stylist has noticed a change in my hair. Will buy again!
B00066N8Z2|5|ok
B000KOSFQM|4|This is a good color.
B0036XWL78|5|Awesome product!
B003S517E2|4|I've owned this body shaver for a year, and have been mostly using it in the shower.  It does a pretty good or getting a complete shave.  For a hairy guy like it, I have to use it once a week for maintenance.  For the price, it's a very good deal.
B003V21WO2|5|The product looks really beautiful. And it is easy and fast to use. Also, it is safe due to the good design.
B00COX5UPQ|5|my son has issue falling asleep, and after reading a lot of reviews about this oil.  I decided to give it a try,  I has been putting 2 or 3 drops or oil on the bed sheet for the last few nights.  I would said that it seems working, he falls asleep faster and has average 1 hour more  sleep per night.  I am happy with this product
B0108IKJCW|5|I got my first tube of this lip balm as a Christmas stocking stuffer and I was hooked - it is the most soothing and enriching lip balm I have ever used. Quality is superb, and the price is very reasonable.
B00AGG3MRG|4|These are great as your first blades and they have neat little packaging. I'm new to shaving and I bought them with Merur's Safety Razor to get the free shipping from Amazon. I shave about every 2-3 days on average and one blade lasts in an excess of 3 weeks. However I'll look for something more bang for your buck when these run out. Superb quality!
B002ZJ7M00|4|I use this product on my daughter's loose curly hair and really like it a lot.  It smooths the frizz down without making hair look greasy.  I've tried at least 6 different products and this is by far the best.  She does not use a blow dryer or flat iron most of the time so I put it on her dry hair.
B003LZS39Q|5|Very satisfied; well packaged and a quality product.
B00JTY6WQ4|5|I've used this roller 4 times with light pressure and I can see an improvement with acne scars and wrinkles.  My face appears soft and with a little plumpness.  I'm 64 and my skin is beginning to look more youthful.  I use vitamin c hyaluronic serum directly after using the roller, let it dry then use Neutrogena night moisturizer.
B00P876DQU|5|Makes skin look and feel amazing!
B00198W37A|5|It works
B0002274FK|1|dont make any this if used it or no the same<br />sorry about this but i wait 5 m and no make any thing
B00QKDC4RI|4|Good product. The tip is too soft though.
B003BRQ36O|5|Awesome blades, can't beat the price and shipping.
B00XNW6IEE|5|arrived in perfect condition, and super easy to fill.<br />doesn't leak or anything and easy to pop out the screw-in part with the rolling ball if you need to.
B003XS3JC2|5|I've used these Updo Barrettes, and couldn't find them any longer in the stores, so was so happy to find them on Amazon. My hair is quite thick, and these hold it up beautifully, and they're so easy to use.
B000142BP2|2|Its creamy and moisturizes your skin but made it itchy. I won't buy it again. I thought it was a waste and threw away the jar.
B002AOG9SG|5|Excellent service and product
B0049U660K|5|this gives my hair the perfect look- I have used this for over a year and I'm always afraid they will discontinue it it- lol it doesnt dry my hair out- it still feels soft - I can run my fingers  through it but at the same time gives my curls seperation and control- it does take a little time to get the right amount! a little goes a very long way! I  take a very small bit not even the size of a dime - rub it between both palms and start to work it through my hair and then add little bit more as needed- very important if you get to much you wont like like it - I get complilments on my hair all the time! now this is for a soft flowing look - wont work if you are going for a spikey type look
B00PTZ3M92|2|A bit too white even though it does correct the shallowness of my skin color. Makes your face look like a kabuki mask.
B001E96NWU|5|The GOOD:  -No nasty smell/taste  -Coverage lasts a long time  -Excellent sun protection  -SUPER moisturizing    The BAD:  -Low melting point    Let me start by saying, this is the best chapstick I've ever used. Hands down. No questions asked. This stuff rocks!    It applies very easily and smoothly. Unlike some others, it's not too thick, but also not too slimy. There is absolutely NO smell or taste, which is preferred by me. I used to apply chapstick about every 45 minutes, but this stuff keeps me covered for hours. It healed my chapped, sunburned lips in about 3 days and has kept them healthy for weeks. No more dry, cracked, chapped lips. The only bad thing is it seems to have a lower melting point than some of the more common chapsticks. It's never completely liquified on me, but if I leave it in the sun, or take it with me on a run it starts to get kinda squishy.     Recommended: Absolutely
B00QR6SS6O|1|Has a horrible smell other than lemon.
B00B22BCJS|5|This is one of my favorite body washes!  It makes the skin feel so very smooth, it is not irritating to my sensitive skin and the scent is like music to my nostrils.
B0007CXY2C|5|I love this product! I have used it for years!!
B00C2TD8J2|4|A little thin at the bottom. But you get what you pay for. Will update my review after my wedding when I will have had the extensions for 2 months and let you know how the hair held up. But they took dye well and are soft and true to length, but they are a little thin at the tips.  Update: Aug 10, when I ran a flat iron through them the first time the bottom inch got a little frazzled. I'd recommend treating these with Olaplex and joico kpak intensive restructuring treatment. That fixed the issue straight away. But I also soaked them in a hot coconut oil treatment. The platinum frazzled way worse and joico kpak + olaplex saved me from cutting 2 inches off of these.
B00BZEAZ6Y|5|Was going to get a single bottle for $8 but found this greatly priced multipack. Love you amazon
B001MA0QY2|3|I like this iron, but I prefer the flat irons that are slimmer, this one is bulky. It gets really hot though, and works well on my thick hair. It also comes with a trial size bottle of argan oil which I really like.
B0013KA0BA|5|Great very satisfied
B00NO8DT2G|5|Let me begin by saying that we are bee keepers and I know fresh beeswax!  My husband and I both want natural products made with fresh ingredients.  We go through lip balm...a lot.  In fact, if I get a product and he doesn't like it, somehow, who knows, it ends up in the laundry in a hidden pocket and well.  Then I hear \\"Honey, do you have any lip stuff?\\"  So I tried this product.  I liked the name and the flavor selection sounded new, different, interesting.  Let me tell you....This lip balm is AWESOME!  I gave hubs the green tea and the ginger pear...He is guarding them like his life depends on it.  The closest I've gotten to try either of those two flavors is that old quick kiss as he walks out the door!  I adore the other two flavors that are in my possession and I admit that I ran around the house, no lie, rearranging lip balms so that any that are likely for hubs to grab are NOT these...because I know I would never see them again!  The quality is excellent the price right in line with any of those junk commercial products and well....you will love them as much as we do.  That said, I have two notions come to mind...If everyone starts buying them based on my review will there be any when I want more? and is this going to be like that favorite, you finally find it lipstick one month before they discontinue that color?  Hope it is no on both counts.
B00005A9WP|2|Sorry I have to write this, last month I bought this one and received within a week. Thanks for quick shipping.  But when i received I gave to my friend as a Christmas gift.  Unfortunately, the unit didn't work at all.  She didn't tell me until now and I really surprised.  I know she is a electrical engineer and know how to use the machine.  Well, I felt so bad and I don't know what to do with the machine. so I tell her to trash the unit and sorry about that.  I don't know how to contact amazon and tell them what happen but i would like amazon customer please check the product before send it out.  I didn't complain, just want to let amazon know my situation.  Thanks for reading this. Regards.
B006OHM11Y|5|Love it as a bi-racial female this product really has help my hair and I don't wear my hair straight but when I do I put this in before I blow dry my hair to straightened it.
B001G8YOOS|5|My daughter has UC and I ordered this when she had a flare and this made her feel so much better. It helped her a lot. Thanks to sedacrohn. The shipment arrived veryyy quickly.I was very impressed at h ow fast they arrived.Thanks so much I will be purchasing more as she can only take for one month.
B000Q6RHHM|5|The first shaver I ever owned was a Norelco.  Being like any other sheep I continued to buy them over the years.  My first beard trimmer was a Norelco.  After becoming frustrated with that trimmer I took a chance and bought a Remington.  That Remington outperformed the Norelco in every aspect.  So, when I gave up on my most recent $100 Norelco shaver I figured that I could afford $40 worth of risk on a Remington shaver.  And, it has paid off.  This shaves better than any other Norelco I've ever used.  It doesn't rip the hair out of my face and doesn't take nearly as long and does a way better job of getting the hair under my chin.  I think I will continue to buy Remington products as long as they keep performing like this.
B001CTJFCW|5|Very quick shipping. Great product.
B00GQIEFII|5|Smells absolutely amazing, and keeps your skin nice and soft. I really wish they'd make a lotion, because it smells THAT good!
B00FBPE79Y|5|great razor
B009F0G54G|5|Super great product. Super fast shipping
B00GMXJJLA|5|People kept saying that this palette is a duplicate but is the real one! I compared Mike with the one my friend has and it is the exact same on it even comes with an urban decay brush and it says it on the front of the palette! Worth the buy!
B0007CHJOG|2|Smells good but... Just adding in, that I got a really irritated rash after using this product for a couple days. I have never been loyal to a particular brand, so have tried many antiperspirants and deodorants and this is the first one my skin had a reaction to. I went and tried \\"Naturally Fresh Papaya Fusion\\" roll on and its a winner. Check that brand out if you are looking for a natural.
B009YHV1KS|5|Just bought this for my sweety's birthday and when I smelled THIS sexy scent I just knew it needed to be on his body. Ladies...beware because if your man has this on other ladies will follow! It's a sweet and sexy scent this is soft and refreshing but strong enough to drive my hormones wild!
B006IS4FD6|5|Very good product ! Fast shipping.
B000FDCXIY|5|I have used this product for about ten years, as needed.  As a matter of fact, I used it initially on a bad case of rosacea, and after a few days was never bothered by that skin condition again.  My husband uses it for redness on his face, it calms the skin right down.  It's a very gentle cream, very effective, and worth every penny.
B0066DC68Y|5|excellent
B003V264WW|5|Does exactly what i need to do. Perfect! It has a nice texture and nice shape. not too heavy or too light.
B00K1J73PK|5|Would order again
B00F008GFQ|4|It is definitely a great brush! Exactly what I needed! Very soft on my face.
B004TXY0TG|1|My wife is very much excited when she received the package but quite annoyed when she can't find the MANUAL. She was so pissed but still  she goggled for manual online hoping she can find in website but to no avail.<br />We order a lot from amazon and this is the first time we will provide a review on a product. I mean come on! It is 200 DOLLARS!! and not  a manual in the package? How the heck will she know how to operate it? It AGGRAVATES more because there is this sheet of  paper, that goes with it, that specifically will tell you not to use the product unless you  read page blah blah blah of the manual!!... Isn't it annoying?<br />I can't even find a way where to email the seller!!!
B00DFEVQJC|5|I love this Protective phone case.  It is fun and stylish but lets me have fun with my work phone.
B0062IWQVU|5|Must buy! Trims beard, side cuts very well. Usable on any body part. Great value for such a low price.
B001C60YA2|5|Awesome to lighten/whiten blonde highlights!
B006IAKI8U|4|The flask is amazing only problem is the pouch it came with first day it started to come loose n had to stitch it I Hv to purchase another one for someone for xmas I hope I don't HV the same problem . Other than that the flask is awesome it keeps my water cold
B002EHM9J2|5|Received these blades a few days ago and was very pleased with the fit in the razor and the performance.  Great product!
B000KOM40K|5|I am a twenty one year old white male with short hair. Right off the bat I'm not exactly who this company or product is marketing too; That being said, I love it. I have thick, wavy and frizzy-prone hair that I have struggled to control my whole life. I have tried many a different \\"styling\\" products such as gel, mousse, pomade, various clear oils/sprays, hairspray and have been disappointed to say the least. Either they leave me too \\"producty\\" or too frizzy. At my local Walmart I noticed this product and considering it was at least half the price (around $2.50 US) of other (useless) hair products I was looking into I decided to give it a try. Needless to say I was astounded at how well it worked. My biggest hair problem was flyaways especially since my job included lots of driving (I like my windows down when driving, which usually equals frizzy hair) and being exposed to the elements; but this product controls them continually. Twelve hours after the first application and my hair is neat and frizz free. It feels & looks natural, which is paramount for me (I don't enjoy the look & feel of product treated hair, as I'm guessing most of the ladies don't either) All in all, I highly recommended this product to anyone looking for a product that will:<br />1) Moisturize the hair (remove frizz)<br />2) Wont wear off even with touching, wind, humidity, etc. It really does moisturize your hair, not just coat it.<br />3) Retains the look & feel of natural hair. No one will know you use product in your hair!
B00AL04956|1|I had ordered the Cinnamon Bark Madagascar Oil and received Black Pepper oil instead. Amazon refunded my payment. I really wanted the cinnamon but was not able to receive the correct replacement due to it no longer being available. I cannot give an honest and detailed review of a product I never received. I am sure it probably is a decent essential oil.
B003NV9R2U|1|Не стоит и цента.  Вода с краской. Параша полная.  Никому не советую покупать. Хочу вернуть деньги назад.  Банку выбросил в мусор.
B00005AVC7|5|This oil-absorbing sheets is really good my face gets really oily especially my nose. And whenever I apply make-up and a couple of minutes go by my face looks so greasy like there was no make-up to begin with, so when I tried this product I instantly feel in love with it, it absorbed all the oil on my face and never smudged my make-up I'm just sorry that I didn't buy 2 packs lol.
B00JL0J3ZS|1|Material is very cheap quality. Workmanship is really poor. A complete waste of money. I returned it as soon as I laid eyes in the trash. It's not worth not one penny.
B00C2YHJH4|1|I don't know if there clear wire heat wrapped coil are reject or not I bought one set of blue ten wrapped and the wires were blue and strong ,i put them on my machine and the run great then I bought some orange clear shrink and they had clear lead wires and they fell a part I my hands, so they sent me another set of eight wrap free and they broke looking at them, and I know how easy you got to be with coils. I think its the clear wire cover is what it is.i think they are weak and not sturdy even on the Chinese coils have strong lead wires than them 30 dollar coils
B0092MCMM6|3|For the money it is an ok dryer. The only thing I don't like is the hold piece on the back isn't stable enough to keep up the head part. So sporadically it will fall whilie I'm under it.
B00HB2JQTQ|4|I like this. I am only giving it four stars as I have only used it for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />I was hoping that, like some other products, it might actually keep brightening my eye area even when I am not using it. We'll see.<br /><br />In the meantime, it's a very emollient product, so you only need a tiny amount. The micro-crystals reflect light, which helps brighten up the eyes.
B00I80TBHM|5|My skin looks better after a month of use. I find that I don't need my powder like I used to. Also, my acne has cleared up. My skin seems plumper & younger.
B004XU2DRQ|4|This is a really great product to use for especially limp/flat hair. It really works when you blow dry and use a round brush.Nice scent, easy to use, adds volume and hold.
B001IMSIYY|4|This product is my new favorite!  I purchased it as an alternative to Wen products, and I have not been disappointed so far.  I have heard so many positives to cleansing conditioners, and I was sold at soft silky hair that would not need to be trimmed as often.  I am African-American with an oily scalp and dry ends, and this product effectively cleans my scalp without stripping it, and moisturizes my ends.  I LOVE that you can also use the product as a leave-in; AND I also use it as a deep treatment by applying and sitting under a hood dryer for 20 minutes.  It is fabulous!  I am definitely purchasing another bottle!
B00IJQDZTU|4|This is my first time using fiber lashes and I have to say I'm impressed. I still have to get the hang of applying it but I do love em 😊 I will definitely be buying again
B00H8XVWS6|5|Great product! Fast delivery!
B00009RF1E|5|light weight easy to hold and use in those tight corner of your mouth and under your bottom lip..very good product..
B00L5O4696|5|ilike it！
B004BCVC5A|5|Love HiP eyeshadows...I Often use them as eyeliner... Very good product for the price. Like both Matte and shimmer. With a very thin brush, can also be used as eye liner!!
B00EA86WXC|4|Does its job, smells good, no flakes. My go to hair gel.
B000C1UFDE|1|Does not smell like the original perfume that I brought for my wife before. I do not recommend this product
B00LZWY4FO|5|Great cotton Turbies.  I got them specifically to match my blue bathroom and am happy with them.  I previously had the micro fiber ones and they were ok.  The cotton are so much better and a little bigger which is good since I have mid-back length hair.  They really make a difference in blow drying time.
B003JVE57Q|5|These microrings are perfect for attaching hair extensions.  I love the color, as they match with a variety of blond to light brown hair colors, even though they are not seen once installed.  Great quality, great price.
B0076K07DC|5|Cracked lips, eczema, blemishes I slather this everywhere and the next day my skin is less irritation, less red and on its way to healing. LOVE LOVE LOVE this as a nightly balm on my lips.
B00G7S424O|5|I recently removed my acrylic nails and was searching for non-Acetone-based nail removers. I got this oil-based nail polish remover and really like it!! Unlike traditional Acetone-based removers that tend to dry out your nails, this one does not! You can even use it to massage your nails and cuticles (though it does not function as cuticle oil). The lavender smell is also very nice too! Though it might be a little bit pricey, I realized that each time I did not have to use a lot in order to remove all nail polish on my nail. It is an oil-based remover, so using two drops each time on a cotton ball is enough.
B00H3ZKOXS|5|Great item.  Exactly what I ordered.  Perfect for my daughters wig collection.  Glad I ordered a dozen.  Very happy with them
B00000J9DU|1|Out of the box, this piece of equipment should have worked perfectly.  A strong sream of water should have been jetting from the hand-held spout but alas, the stream of water reminded me of one of the stone cherib statues peeing water into a fountain basin.<br />I thought that maybe I got a lemon, but after reading other comments regarding this piece of junk, the odds are I didn't. I will be returning it to where I purchased it for a full refund, unless, between now and then, my opinion on this product can be altered. <br />What a waste of time and money for me as a consumer, the store from which I bought it, and finally the manufacturer.  Did they think that letting this mistake of a product was going to be accepted by the public as a vaiable dental aid?  What are some of these corporate decision makers thinking?  Why?  If the answer is money, then that doesn't even make sense.  Because everyone loses money on this kind of product offering.
B000VTJN12|2|I bought this flat iron for my daughter. She had the same model but dropped it and it broke, so we had to buy a new one. As she is familiar with how well the first one worked, she was very disappointed to find out that this one does not get hot enough to straighten her long, thick hair. She is very disappointed. We are returning it.
B000LSBZAU|5|This product arrived as promised. The vendor went the exta mile to tape the tube top so that it would not leak while in transit.
B003CNS3T2|4|Great
B00KOJ9P9Y|5|I have been looking for a very long time for a product that I can use on my curly hair with a flat iron and not damage my hair. This stuff was recommended by the person who cuts my hair.
B0055S4BZ2|3|My wife says this stuff isn't the best she used nor was it the worst...it was middle of the road.  She did like the thickness/creaminess of the product.  However, she is not sure she would purchase based on this trial bottle.
B0041R7C4A|2|I was so excited to try this since it stated it was great for controlling frizz and it had a ton of 5-star reviews.  I usually put a few drops of something in my hair and let it dry naturally.  I put 2 pumps of this in my long thick hair and it did absolutely nothing plus I really did not care for the smell at all.  Not sure what the smell is but to me it's not pleasant.  I tried this on dry hair, thinking maybe it worked better that way but no such luck. Also if you put too much in your hair, it looks greasy.  I then tried it with another hair product in wet hair and it worked better but I really don't want to have to use multiple products to get my hair to not frizz.  I'll use up this bottle but don't plan to repurchase.  I like the Biosilk and the Alterna Bamboo serums better than this.
B007MEOLHU|5|This is the best oil I have used date also fast delivery!
B0006M56BK|4|Great blade for money & seem to hold their sharpness longer.
B00CD1QU80|5|Sweet
B0058SY1X6|4|I am happy with the product I was a little skeptical seeing its cordless but  it has the power.very quiet . much easier cutting my sons hair
B001E768CC|5|Light, effective, moisturizing with a low sheen. I use this daily and being a man I do not like having a glossy glow on my face. This screen has a  low sheen which does not look too unnatural. Often sunscreens can clog my skin causing break-outs but this one does not. A good rinse at the end of the day keeps my skin clear. I think this an excellent, easy, every day, sun screen to use. Best so far for me.
B002TOLEMS|5|the specifications of the product is the same and the features are excellents, It is a good election to purchase. thanks very much
B005SW3YRG|1|I like the smell but the Orange smell with it is pretty off !!!
B000NSQNOG|5|great, as always
B009T47YZ2|1|Do not get it. Right when I get it I try to use it it fell a part I put it back together try to use it again it puld my heir I hit it I wish I can have my money back please do not get it it is not worth it at all
B0006TXWRS|2|I don't know who changed it or why, but it is definitely not the same stuff I was used to buying by the same name.  Not the same at all.
B001MA0QY2|4|I needed a straightener after losing mine after having it for almost 10 years. This seemed a good alternative to an ultra-expensive one. I have fine hair, and relative to this straightener, I'm glad. It heats up very quickly, has an easy on/off button and temperature dial, and it does a good job straightening my hair. I could not imagine having thick or curly hair and getting it as straight as I would like, however. Also, it curls under the ends of my hair if I don't hold it just right, which I personally don't like.<br /><br />Overall, good, inexpensive buy for now.
B004MS49HQ|5|I have tried this product on myself and the kids, I simply love this balm. I would recommend it to everybody, it is a: MUST HAVE!
B000GLRREU|1|This model is so much more quiet than the other older models. Amazon's price is much lower than retail stores (at the time I got it). It seemed Ok at first, but after a few months it lost power then finally stopped. Never buy this model (the blue one)... get the older moder (white one 70). I have two and they have lasted for years. I use it after each meal.
B00CS7TK7C|5|Seriously amazing! I have thin, long hair. No matter how much conditioner I use it's a hassel to brush through it. This brush works so well, no more strugfle for me, don't hesitate to buy it. I bought the mini one for my purse too!
B000MGSJFK|5|good stuff
B0038OE2Q8|5|I have been allergic to lot of eyeliners lately, even the midlest application caused eye cyst within few hours of usage. Finally thought of trying organic brand and this worked just great. I feel so much better, at last i can go back to my old style of eye makeup, such an relief.
B00LGZWSOO|5|Want to grow long nails? Use this product! It works!
B002C741MM|5|I have gone through many beard trimmers and this one is the best so far!  The adjuster dial on the trimmer makes it easy to set the desired length, from a couple of days old stubble to over an inch long beard.  You can remove the guard and trim to 5 o'clock shadow if you want.  The trimmer is very sharp and trims my thick coarse beard very fast with no problem.  The guard has a spring loaded guide that feels like it combs your beard as you trim which makes for a more even and consistent trim.
B00FRC2OW8|5|Love it!!!
B006K9OQSC|5|I love them. It is the easy and super fast way how to make your hair look elegant in few seconds. Forget those big sponges in your hair. This is what you need. Long shipping, but great price
B001ANQY2Y|1|So bad, don't even think. It didn't change anything, my shoes still having the same problem and it broke right away.
B0026IBSVE|5|Cuts my husbands hair great! I'm no hair dresser but its easy to use and my husband even has cut his own hair.
B001AMQJAW|5|The Intense Curl Cream is excellent for curly hair.  Don't overdue it though or your hair will feel a bit greasy.  I use this in combination with Moroccan Oil.  This product is pricey, but it does last a while.
B002XQ1X4G|5|I'm very happy
B00B3ZV140|5|The product description is accurate, good quality and image. Fulfilled with my expectations. You can trust and purchase it without any inconvenience.
B001DNE3KQ|5|Very happy with this shaver! I bought it to replace a Braun that broke after about 2 years. Braun used to be a fine shaver company with quality support - I think they've fallen down a bit (IMHO). This was an Amazon deal-of-the-day special, so I feel particularly satisfied with the then very low price and the remaining very high quality of this shaver. To me, it shaves closer and smoother than the model Braun that I had. It charges quickly, holds the charge well, and cleans easily. Based on the fact that this model is sort of an entry-level model for the Panasonic line, I can only imagine how well the higher end models perform. I highly recommend this product. This shaver has made me a Panasonic-believer when it comes to shavers!
B003DXCC2K|2|This foundation shows every open poor on my face and the color looks unnatural, a waste of money. I see why its not at department stores anymore.
B00810TW46|5|I love this product and so glad that I found it at Costco.  It came as a combination product: foundation (which I don't use), powder, and this exact match concealer.  I have very fair skin with plenty of freckles and....redness.  The redness started after I had my son, and never went away.  It is primarily on my cheeks, nose, and chin.  I have tried many different products to try and balance my skintone.  I've found a couple over the years that have helped (sadly some have been discontinued), some have given a \\"greenish\\" hue to my face, but this seems to be the best and most natural looking find.  It doesn't cover up my natural imperfections, such as my freckles, to make it look like I have a thick mask of make-up on.  I do blend the colors that I think look appropriate for my skin color and then I complete the look with the powder.
B00D8QMKAG|5|I used to get stomach aches in the morning after brushing my teeth with conventional tooth paste. After some researching, I decided to try natural tooth paste and came across this product and oh boy, no more stomach aches in the morning; teeth feel cleaner and whiter and my dentist complimented me on the health of my teeth. Try it, you won't regret it!
B00K9XRTK2|5|I love it!  The color is exactly the same as advertised.  It feels like human hair.
B006IBM21K|5|Quickly received my nail dryer and I have been using it ever since!!  In one month, between me and my daughter, it has paid for itself!!  Dries quickly!!!!  LOVE IT!!!
B0075GXW0W|5|It's not for me .but its the real thing !!!!!! so I would recommend this product for users. Great price!!
B002N5MHLK|3|Hopefully this review helps for those of us who are beard challenged.      This was my first real electric shaver ever.  I have always used razors.  So perhaps this might be a bias review but I will get further into it.  I started to use it, and after the 2nd or 3rd shave, it started to cause cuts and nicks.  I didn't like that and perhaps its just my beard/skin.  I decided to return it and received a refund (hence the 3 stars).
B0054J2IO8|4|tastes good and even my kids (4 and 7) will use it. i have no idea if it's effective or not.
B001AF2VEM|5|This is a fantastic product. It is unbelievable the results from using this on nails to eliminate rough spots and end up with brilliant shine.
B00O9FLMSQ|5|Works like a charm!
B0073ANH14|4|Have not used this long enough. I had a mila by my eve that i dug out and it left a hyperpigmented spot of sorts on my face. I used this a few times...it is moisturizing but i resorted to peels instead as i dont have the patience.
B00IG12XLO|5|Spreads easily, great protection, no strange odor, and great moisturizing.<br /><br />The consistency makes it so you only really need a little bit for your whole face. I don't have to smell like I'm going to the beach (even if I am going to the beach).
B002392MAW|3|Good stuff
B00GCQMSVA|5|Don't bother looking anymore! Trust me, I'm a product junky and this is one of the only products I've seen real results in short amount of time! Bought this because of recommendation n reviews and thank god I did! Everything written is true! Glowing skin, smaller pores, lines softened, skin plumper more youthful looking, dry, flaky skin gone, spots lightened! Miracle in a bottle, give it a try n stick with it and you'll believe!
B009PIJLMQ|5|It does whiten your teeth, gradually! It's not same as using the whitening strips, but it works!!
B006XK7Z4A|4|The wig doesn't look anything like the picture but it is a good wig.This is Why I only gave it four stars as always outre wig quality is the best but I just wasn't Happy with the curl pattern so I flat ironed it on a very low setting.
B00AO0BHNU|5|I really like this tooth brush!  After using it for a month I can honestly say that my teeth and mouth feel so clean.  I have never used a electric tooth brush because I thought they would be rather harsh on my mouth and teeth.  I was in for a great surprise because the bristles on the Panasonic tooth brush are so soft and what is really neat is I can feel the bristles cleaning in between my teeth and behind the back molars and cleaning my gums.  It is so awesome!  The tooth brush has triple edge bristles.  The charge lasts approxmimately 40 minutes which is great!  I charge it up about every 4-5 days.  You can get tooth brush replacements for this tooth brush which I like.  I'm very happy with this Panasonic tooth brush.
B003AYEUL8|5|This stuff does my hair style perfect, helps keep my hair healthy as well as my hands & nails. Smells awesome too, not that greasy smell you get with most pomades. Just a light orange scent that goes away in a few minutes. Great product!
B000FEIOHW|5|I've used a Sonicare toothbrush since 1998 because I have problems with my gums.  The Sonicare has kept my gums healthy.<br /><br />When my most recent Sonicare decided to retire, I found this [[ASIN:B000FEIOHW Philips Sonicare HX3351/02 Xtreme Battery Operated Toothbrush]] and thought I would give it a try because it only requires AA batteries.  I travel a lot and it is - more often than not - a hassle to take my Sonicare with me.  But no more!  This travels so much easier and takes up substantially less room.  Because it charges and operates via batteries versus an electrical outlet, it also saves counter space.<br /><br />I've only had it for a week, but it seems to be a bit more powerful than my other Sonicares. Even though it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the more expensive versions it cleans my teeth very well. So far, I'm very, very pleased.
B005OTO9CM|5|Perfect for Latisse!
B0009M0C5W|5|This is a great lip smoothing and plumping product.
B00AGG3MNU|4|One of the best blades, but don't last quite as long as the Merkur blades. After two shaves they seem to lose their ability to glide through the beard, so they end up chopping instead of cutting.
B00GNHK7RA|5|My favorite razor of all time. Good to find the blade replacements at affordable price.
B0009DT39W|1|I bought this product based upon some of the reviews and let me tell you as a make up artist...this product sucks!  It does not work at all, on real lashes, extenstions or false lashes.  It is a total waste of money!!
B00066YC5W|3|Just returned this make-up mirror.  Unlike other reviewers I did not mind the lighting...seemed sufficient to me,however we do have alot of light in our bathroom already so maybe that helped.  I sent it back because of how easily or loosely it swiveled...the air from the blow dryer...a slight bump...sometimes for now apparent reason the mirror would just swivel and it always landed on the magnified side...can't tell you how frustrating that was! Trying a diffferent kind now...hope it's better than this one was!
B007SZCG0C|5|This product definitely lives up to its promise.  After the first couple of uses regular shedding was reduced dramatically and my hair definitely has more strength.  For the most optimal results, use for about 5 washes per week.  This shampoo forms a nice lather with a pleasing scent as well.  It is a great alternative to multi-step processes for stimulating hair growth.
B003EXG5XQ|4|Very refreshing, drys quickly after applying, smells fresh, doesn't leave face oily, definitely will purchase again... Only down side is the small size is very little
B00IO00HII|5|Smells really good...I've gotten several compliments...
B0000530JK|5|Schick I have a message for you... Stop spending all your money in new product design and give it to me for telling you You already have the best design in a razor. Ask any 30 or 20 year old what razor she learned to shave on, the answer will be a Personal Touch. Slap on some new colors (a wall mount would be great) and sell away. If you don't take my advise I beseach you not to discounting the cartridges. I still have mine and after fifteen to twenty years it looks brand new! And I haven't lost my Touch in shaving with it. No NICKS EVER.
B005GMYQ52|4|My package arrived today, exactly when they said it would and i absolutely love this lipstick. The price is amazing and so is this product. It hasn't dried my lips out at all (I put on some exfoliating lip scub before applying the lipstick.) and it has lasted quite a while. They color is also very flattering. Not too dramatic but still noticeable. Very nice for an everyday look.
B004GKAKK0|2|I expect a pre-shave lotion to do two things: First, and most important, it has to permit the shaver to glide smoothly over the face. I use a Norelco rotary shaver and have years of experience with pre-shave lotions. This one is poor. It dries up too fast and then the shaver almost sticks to your face. You are almost better off just washing your face with clean water and drying it. Also, it comes out as a viscous paste, not as a liquid, and I don't particularly like this.<br /><br />Second, it has to raise the follicles so the shaver can cut off the hair close to the skin leaving it smooth. It does a mediocre job of this.<br /><br />Unfortunately I bought a six-pack. Will probably discard the other five and go back to Williams Pre-electric. It is MUCH better.
B00J00O0KW|1|It did not fit, to small
B00377WHHM|5|I love the smell of peppermint and I love the cool feeling it leaves your feet. It definately has to be used with a pumice stone but it's still a really good product and I definately will be buying again. I use it in conjunction with be natural callus remover.
B000GW78MU|4|a couple of the scents are a bit much but, we love the oils. The oils work great and finish clean.
B005MT7I5O|3|This will be an ongoing review.  I use both the Noble Formula 2% Pyrithione Zinc Bar Soap and this cream simultaneously.  I have seborrheic dermatitis.  I have tried multiple anti fungal treatment like lotrimin and anti dandruff soaps which only helped a little but usually comes back after 2-3 weeks.<br /><br />I wash with noble bar during showers and I usually apply this cream twice a day (after shower and before sleep) sometimes 3 times (mid day).<br /><br />First few days of using this cream the mornings were very painful.  The pain usually last only a few mins but it feels like you pour alcohol on a wound.  I assume the pain is because my facial skin is 'open'.  Night application not as painful especially if I did a midday one.  I notice that the redness and bumpiness actually increased and scales increased a lot during these days.  Scales not too visible with the cream on but when you wake up in the morning the flakes were all over my face especially the nose area.  Got me nervous since I see a lot of reviews seeing results in a few days, but I was willing to try any product for at least 2 weeks as long as it was bearable.<br /><br />Around the one week area, mornings are still painful, redness is slightly better, flakes are still bad during wake ups.  Itchiness is same as before beginning treatment.<br /><br />Around the two week area, morning applications are not as painful, redness is getting better, still a lot of flaking/scales.  Itchiness is maybe slightly better.<br /><br />Around the three week area, morning applications have very little pain if any, redness is barely visible, scales are a lot better, practically 90 percent better.  My skin actually looks very good and soft, it actually looks a lot younger.  I usually have 1-3 pimples visible on my cheek area every week for the past few years and now they don't appear.  Itchiness is still the same.<br /><br />Dec. 28 2014.  Currently on my fourth week.  I am happy about the redness and scaling being practically gone.  I'll have to figure something out about the itchiness.  Mosquito bites do last 2-4 weeks on me so maybe a few more weeks the itchiness will be better.  I do notice if I sweat or at the stage before you can visibly see the sweat, within a few hours after application it burns.  So I may have to see if washing my face before doing any activity will help with that.<br /><br />I'll do another update in a month.  Hopefully this review will help some of you.<br /><br />Late update. Sadly my dermatitis came back hard.

B005LN670S|5|Already gone! lol
B00CR9Y5IA|1|I bought 3 of these for gifts for Christmas. 2 of them don't work and other won't keep a charge. So a bit disappointed in the purchase.
B0027EYZYE|1|I tried this product for over (4) weeks and I do not see any  visible difference in my skin.  I found that this product does not soak into the skin but actually stays on the outer surface.  Perhaps it is because I spent (30) years of my life in the sun because I live in a rural area.  But, I did expect  to see even  a slight difference in my skin tone and texture but this is not the case.  For the price I would not recommend this product.
B004NN5IKC|4|First off the clumps of stuff you spit out is NOT pieces of skin inside your mouth. It is a chemical reaction with saliva, plaque, and bacteria that tends to clump up after rinsing our your mouth. it says it everywhere else you search the phenomena. If you get the alcohol free one it doesn't burn anything in your mouth. Otherwise the invigorating one feels just like every other mouthwash i have used. I have not seen ANY staining and don't have ANY tastes resolved by using this product. I eat my gummy vitamins right after rinsing out my mouth in the morning and they taste exactly how they did before i ever used this product. I also like that my mouth feels very healthy throughout the entire day, which i have not experienced with other mouthwash. Most feel worn off after a meal. I can eat all 3 meals, drink energy drinks, and eat a molten chocolate cake and still have a wonderful clean feeling in my mouth. I recommend it. A majority of people with this \\"problem\\" other people are complaining about also say dentists recommended the product to them. It's not a coincidence.
B00J9QXSZ0|5|I've used it only a few times and so far I'm loving it.<br />You need to be patient with it if you want it to work right. Take your time applying each step and you'll get great results.<br /><br />I got this with a special code/price and I'll shell out full price for it again!
B009IS9I9O|5|This is exactly what I am looking for my 3.5 years old daughter. I received all 10 batch of 5 different colors. They are all hearts and cute, easy to pair. I won't be afraid that she lose one or two, cause this 50 pc will be good to go for a while. Thanks!
B001VYRONU|1|If you have small hands they would be fine, although could be sharper. I brought them and haven't used them since.
B00150DBN2|4|i can no longer return item or ask seller the question that i know of but on the directions of this bottle is says that it will foam up, mine does not foam.  does anyone one else have this problem?  there is not an expirations date on the bottle so just wondering. i am giving this product a 4 star because it makes my skin very soft and i do use the day cream along with it.  i love their products.  i see others have the same question i have about it foaming up so i'd really like to know what it is supposed to do.  i squirt at least 10 squirts on a dry face.  just feels real soft as i clean.  no soapy look at all.
B001ET71A8|5|Great!
B001OTG03W|5|The color is wonderful ... Shinny and drys fast needs a top coat
B00BKZQKJ4|5|I feel like my skin is a lot smoother ever since I have been using this. The whole &#34;84 elements&#34; is fluff I'm sure, but I am always a sucker for anything Himalayan Sea Salt!
B002GOXELA|5|I have very sensitive skin and am happy to report that, after more than a month of use, this solution has not caused any adverse reactions and works well as a night cream.
B0054LHI5A|5|Always have. Always will
B004BCZD2I|5|Great color combination!
B007RKC284|3|The length is right, but the neck is huge -- they've made it for a giant, or they misplaced where they put the velcro since it doesn't fit tight around a grown man's neck
B005792YVW|4|I dont have overly sensitive skin, but more &#34;resurface&#34; type serums burn and tingle too much for me. This does have some mild sensations but my skin can handle it and I am happy with the results so far.
B000C1W6YA|1|Re: Body Kouros, either they sell a bogus product at amazon or all the other reviewers are lying.  This only qualifies as a room freshener and that too a bathroom freshner.  The base smells like coconut oil.  No matter how much I sprayed it did not smell good at all.  At best it smells like a melon scented candle.  In contrast, the drakkar noir I got at the same time purchased is perfect.  If you want to buy body kouros test it out someplace first.
B000TGUGTA|2|My biggest problem with this radio is that the numbers on the dial in no way correspond to where the actual numbers are!  For instance, I was going nuts trying to find 101.1.  Where did I finally find it?  Next to  the number 104 on the dial.  Ridiculous.  Then, I'll be listening to it and it will just go out!  So I have found that when I'm in a rush in the morning (which is a predicament I find myself in everyday being a working Mom), I take longer showers because I'm spending too much time trying to find a station.    As they've said about some movies..... \\"Be afraid.... be VERY afraid.\\"    And stay away!
B003HD04DK|5|This is a excellent product for facial problems. I would reccomen to others and would feel they would like the product<br />also
B0055UB96E|2|I tried to order Red Orchard, which I love, but got poppy. The scent of the poppy is just awful. I cannot use this product,
B00LKSVFI2|5|A very sturdy and elegant product for the price.  It does not look like a cheap mirror product.  It's actually quite elegant, solid and well made.  I'm very happy with this purchase.  The mirror swivels with a 10x magnification on one side.
B000PD5ESU|4|Works as expected, no complaints other than the bristles being smashed to the side a bit.
B0017TOODW|2|They were broken when I got them but the smell is ok . I was really mad cuz they weren't full but I didn't return . The smell is fresh but doesn't stay long ;(
B00CO6D9C4|5|The product arrived early and in good condition.<br />I will order from this  site again.<br />After using the estradiol for about a week it is amazing how much better I feel. I have my life back!
B0013FPPS8|5|This is the best product I've ever used on my long, thick, baby fine hair.  Smooths and controls static without being heavy, helps reduce split ends, makes it look and feel healthy.  I've used it for a couple of years and still love it.
B00KWP3SA2|3|Something in this makes my eyes burn, like the concept but not sure why it does this if it's natural?
B000COT29O|3|Excellent design, wonderful quality. Would prefer if it came in different sizes (smaller) if one wanted a less noticeable mark. I recommend it to anyone who would like to use it as a sample before getting the real thing.
B00K33EXMU|5|Great product, great price!!!
B00ADKVDM6|5|great
B00VMOBJ5S|5|As someone who is always on the go, I have loved having three efficient pairs of tweezers that I can throw in my purse or gym bag together in their small carrier! Great quality, great look, LOVE.
B009LQGJCM|5|I sweat profusely for a girl.  When I'm nervous, stressed, or even from a light walk, my face is sweating buckets.  I know this isn't meant for our face, but I still tried it and it works.  It does dry you out a bit and I notice that on some areas (underarms) it doesn't work quite well.  I can't say I love the clove smell, but I deal with it.  It also stings like crazy for at least 15 minutes if not longer.  I want to rip my face off b/c it's so uncomfortable.  But again, it's all worth it in the end to not look like a sweating pig at the most inopportune times!
B001ECQRFK|5|It's the best you can use it just works good for your teeth and gum.
B0058PCTH4|5|I bought this for my mom and it is perfect. Sturdy construction and has a mirror also, lined with plastic to wipe out compartments. I would buy again from this company. I got one for myself also. Colors are great and accented with silver, love it!
B000Z5YG8M|5|This is my favorite pencil eyeliner!! It's creamy and smooth, easy to apply! I've been using it for 2 years now.
B00GPHK5O8|1|Too thin
B00CNTUFFG|5|Only use this product a couple of times but can already see the difference in the condition of my hair already
B005M88DKO|5|As described! Thanks
B00N4UXI6G|4|I been using the cellulite buster tool and this cream since March. I think the combination has made an incredible difference in the appearance of my  thighs. I love the feel of the gel-cream when applied, just the sensation alone made me feel like it was going to do some good. Depending on the level of cellulite, you may need more than one jar.
B00K1GURLA|5|Excellent product.  Works better than anything else I have tried.
B00HSE4WJG|5|A++ great
B00GLS554Q|4|I didn't buy this for the stated use- I do not have colored hair.  I have a grey patch near the top of my head that I want covered without dyeing all of my hair.  This worked pretty well, but didn't last as long as I would have liked.  It got points for ease of use though.
B007HU4HH8|5|This is the closest to my skin tone.  It give a flawless look and it polishes me for the day.  If I could make it not transferable I would but all in all I love the stuff.
B008CC46VW|5|perfect
B000E7SUCY|5|Love the fresh smell!
B004H5D40W|5|Best $10.00 I believe I have ever spent!!!! Took me a week or two to get used to it, but once I did, it was great!!!!!Will buy another when this one wears out.
B00008MOQN|4|I have used this brand for years and think Maybeline is a good makeup line.  I will buy it again.
B006MAI7DY|3|They arrived in good time, however, the rose set is supposed to have True Black, Snow White Opaque, Bright Red, Golden Yellow and Light Green. However, instead of Bright Red, I received Hard Orange. No Bright Red at all. Is there a way to remedy this??
B00CAAPQKM|5|What arrived at the house was exactly what was advertised on Amazon. The phone protector fits the phone perfectly, same as the screen protector and my wife loves using the stylus. We have yet to stress the case and I hope we never do, but for the price any additional protection is well worth it. Plus, now my wife's phone looks like a creamsicle sandwich. Got to love that. :)
B002CMLHEC|5|Have always loved \\"it's a 10\\" and while it's not the cheapest it is definitely worth the price for how much you get and what the product does. The shipping took a it longer than expected but only by a few days, very worth it would recommend any day!
B00GRP4HY2|1|The cap does not fit tightly and has an orange color to it which does not look good with lace front wigs.
B0038TVHGG|5|I have blonde super frizzy color treated over processed hair.  I change the color all the time and my hair is naturally a bit dry and damaged feeling and I have incredibly sensitive skin.  Most true sulfate free shampoos do not lather so I was surprised this one did.  (seriously read labels alot of products that say &#34;sulfate free&#34; just means it doesn't contain sodium laureth sulfate but contains some derivitave of it.)  This has all natural ingredients and makes my hair super soft, cleanses it well, does not strip my hair color and even gives my hair some body.  Other shampoos can leave blisters on my scalp and it's hard to find something that doesn't irritate my scalp. This shampoo even seemed to soothe it.  I have also noticed my hair growing a bit faster probably because it is healthier.<br /><br />A couple of things I noticed about this shampoo... it does not take much to actually cleanse your hair and it does have kind of a strange slippery feel.  Since I am used to a non lathering cleanser this does not bother me but if you are used to tons of suds this doesn't have it.  You don't need the suds for your hair to be clean, just mentioning and as others have said you can find it cheaper in stores. I find it at CVS, Walgreens, and Sally Beauty Supply.
B0065I0UMO|3|Although I do all my shopping at Amazon, this product was not as good as products you can buy at a local drug store. It us good, but not worth the cost. Definitely worth the ease of shopping at Amazon<br />Suzie
B004D2C57M|4|This wasn't exactly what I thought I was buying, I thought I was buying something else. But I do like it, and it does make my skin feels soft. I'm not sure if it's decreased lines around my eyes, because I don't have that many. I will update with continued use.
B00028QF9U|5|What more do I have to say?  This product works great.  I use it; I don't smell; it lasts a loooooong time; it's inexpensive.  Should you buy it?  Yes.  Will you smell &#34;like a man&#34;?  You'll probably smell like a person who doesn't sweat, which is the reason I buy deodorant.
B001CY87TE|5|Good, sturdy product. Great value. Pleased with my purchase and would buy again.
B00CS1SC0O|5|This stuff works just as sunblock should. Of course like all sunblocks it requires reapplication after sweating or water play. It's a great &#34;natural&#34; choice and is cruelty free too! I have used it on my 7month old and she has had no reaction to it. It also has a classic light sunblock scent which makes my baby smell like summer...
B001VEK1HQ|5|Replacement foil, I replace about once a year or when I feel that it isn't doing a great job after it's been washed
B004YZBAT2|1|I used this product in addition to the entire product line for It's a Curl!  The next day my 6-month old daughter's precious little head was itching, red, she had rash all around the back of her neck, head, chest.  I felt completely terrible and that it was all my fault for trying to use something new.<br /><br />Hopefully this will go away, I had to get a prescription for hydrocordisone, 2.5% to help with the itch and to reduce the redness and bumps.  This is the first time that I have seen a reaction like this on her since she has been born.<br /><br />Stick with the ultra gentle stuff until baby is old enough to use stronger products.  I'm completely disappointed in this product!!!  Don't make the same mistake that I made!
B003SK7PVQ|5|Great soap, gentle, reliable and refreshing - does exactly what it's made to do!  The Amazon price is fantastic and the Prime delivery is terrific.<br />This deal was for 6 large 5.25oz bars.  Much larger than some of the others at the same price. Great deal, very highly recommended.
B00150LT40|1|This top coat does not prolong nail color. I apply it as a top coat and it actually shrinks my nail polish and it ends up chipping off. Darn it.. If anyone knows of a top coat that actually seals in your polish and extends it's wear, let me know! lol because this one defiantly doesn't do that.
B000052ZOU|5|goes on easily & doesn't fade. I like it.
B00ILO8IA6|5|Love the color and honestly alittle bit goes a long way will have enough for a longggg time
B005AYHHNO|3|It's ok for the price but I expected an easier to use product. It takes a while to do it since u have to put so many coats but it looked okay. Not very happy with how long it lasts though. If you want a decent French tip don't buy this.
B00IBS9QC6|5|what a effective mask!<br />I just love “Dead Sea Mud Facial Mask” despite I am very sensitive about my skin but when I used this mask, its result was very obvious, it made my skin softer and brighter and healthier and easily dried a few acne that I had around my chin
B00AYILTDA|1|I am only giving this 1 star because you don't have an option of giving it a 0. This was a complete knock off/false advertising. It is not Mac. I buy MAC and usually get it at the Mall, this time I was lazy and ordered online getting the best deal I could. Definatly got what I paid for. I don't know what this stuff was, it was awful, Sticky, poor coverage and in no way lasted remotely as long as the Mac you get from the department stores. Even down to the fake container it came in and the poor print to make it look like it. Dare I say they put Wet n Wild inside the fake container and called it MAC. Horrible!!!!!
B00C7DYBX0|1|I've been using this for almost a month and have not really noticed any results.  I will continue to use it and see what happens.
B00LZWV0WY|5|Excellent moisturiser! Non-greasy yet rich. Results after two months of use are admirable.
B007FV2WEO|4|The conditioner works great with that grey hair that has a mind of its own, the shampoo is good but just doesn't get all the brassisness out , does pretty good but found the Crew Classic Grey does a better job.<br />I'll keep buying the conditoner, that's done wonders taming the grey meaness that's in there
B00VL1XM48|5|Works very well; very lightweight!!
B00AEINQ9K|4|I don't like to shave, but when I do I use this razor. it is great to have on the road. it also made me look pretty awesome when I went to meet my girlfriends parents last week. thanks electric razor.
B000FZEPYW|1|I waited for this for days! once it finally came I was very excited. It didn't work what-so-ever and all it did was hurt like crazy and I read and went along with the instructions never worked waste of money!!!!
B00CXVA5BS|4|This deodorant spray works wonders.  I mostly needed it for sweating in my female area due to pregnancy, but it also greatly helps with any feminine smell.  I also use it along my bra line under my breasts since that is where I sweat a lot.  It's fabulous!
B008UZERHY|5|Good product, I use it only as a concealer, not as an all-around foundation.
B0073G75U2|5|I had this beautiful perfume when I was in high school. It's got a fresh, gentle, sweet floral scent. I like it! I hope it's made in Poland (if it's original) :)
B001330XFA|4|i like this produt its hot and slik the hair it has two type of volt i can choose what can suit my country volt
B00NM59XZS|2|It may just be the location of my actual piercing, but the hoop was too big.
B003ZX32ZO|5|I am happy I got my brushes they are extremely awesome and I am pleased for making such and excellent buy.
B000YM8VU0|1|Really this is a 4.5 star item? I have think asian hair. This wax does NOTHING for my hair. It doesn't hold, it doesn't last, it's not a good product. You know how when you put water on your hair and the water dries your hair becomes what it looks like naturally without water, that is exactly what this product does. I like a firm lasting hold. There are SO MANY better products than this. Please use Bed Head B which is why it is a 4.5 star and #1 best seller because it will transform and hold your hair. Also redken high up wax is good. This cream is not good, I regret buying it, I don't know what I'm going to do with the rest.
B008E3COTA|4|Smells like baby oil, which isn't bad. I use it almost every day and little bit goes a long way.
9790790961|5|perfect
B00KAJM2IO|4|Really Amazing Works well, I became a pirate shortly after use. My gf like the Head Hunter scent better.
B0027WPJRI|4|Great stuff. Love it!!
B00BC8YKZU|5|very good!
B003YJAZZ4|5|the shaver I s great a works very well in shaving and the way that it cleans the slaver also,have used it a few time and would definitely would giv eit good makes work workmanship and how well it shaves your face
B00OWV5MBU|4|Fun little gift for my daughter for Christmas.
B000GFWIOU|5|Anything from nexxus is a great product.  Works good.  Happy with purchase
B0007ZAK58|1|I wanted to use this thinning shears the same day I resive them  but they're not sharp so I was so disappointing because I like this brand
B00HY7S61W|5|Love that I can buy this many for this cheap
B001BKI89I|5|I ordered this bath brush for my mother who is in a nursing home.  She has difficulty reaching her back area, and needed something that would be soft enough for her sensitive skin, but would be firm enough to do the job.  She really loves the brush.
B0030HNNS6|5|I've only tried this once so far and it went on easy and stayed on all day without any smudges. Does not clean off easy, though I prefer my eyeliner that way for long lasting stay.
B007ZN5ATQ|5|This is our third purchase of this product and we are very happy with Sonicare Essence. I would definitely recommend this product.
B00120VWJ0|5|My muscles are weak and I don't have the strength to scrub-scrub-scrub rinse-rinse-rinse to get my hands (hair, body, sink, counter top...) clean.  When my other liquid soap ran out, I decided to try this because I like that it's organic.<br /><br />Wow!  What a difference!  This stuff is dynamite.  A remarkably little bit will do to wash my hands, for example.  Then it rinses quickly... don't have to run the water and rinserinserinse.  My hands are left soothed and neither dry nor oily.<br /><br />The smell is a light, refreshing peppermint.  My skin and scalp love it.<br /><br />p.s. to other folks who are immune suppressed or suffer from heat rash - this soap is great for that.
B000065DK4|1|I have long straight hair and was tired of the same old look. So I figured hang up the flat iron and get me a 3 barrel waver. Was so excited to achieve a different hairstyle than my usual without having to pull out the curling iron (and 1 1/2 hours). I ended up purchasing the VS waver due to the good price soon to find out that there is a reason that the price is so low- the thing doesn't work!!! It did nothing for my hair. It didnt give me waves at all. Nothing. I even tried holding it in my hair longer. But that didn't work either. Would put it in my hair and count to 30 before moving it and if anything it made my hair frizz at that point. I do not recomend this for anyone that does not have hair that is just super easy to curl. Because chances are, unless your hair takes to heat REALLY well, this will do nothing for you but add to your day's frustration and damage your hair.
B000FYVOJC|5|This is the best nose hair trimmer I have ever bought!! It does a great job!  My husband loves it!! When this one dies I'll definitely buy the same thing to replace it.
B0017JV7HI|5|I had been looking everywhere for my favorite fragrance when I was running low. Macy's no longer carries it.  I was told to check out Kohl's to see if they had it and they do not carry this frangrance either.  Kohl's does have other Vear Wang fragrances, but not this one.<br /><br />I will shop on Amazon to get it in the future.
B0020MM8KG|5|This is a good deal
B003JVVJZM|5|Great buy!
B00BEXD53G|3|I like it
B00IUTW1JQ|2|First, its very cheaply made. The case body is not silver aluminum, its silver plastic with aluminum edging. The black vinyl interior was cardboard backed and falling off when I received it and opened it. The little interior hinged compartment is cheap too. It doesn't fold in correctly. For $31.00 ( including tax and shipping) I could have found something better, or just put the $ towards a better product. Not worth paying return shipping, so I'm stuck with it I guess. My suggestion, keep looking.
B001FS0HAY|5|Recd the mirror very quickly — it is exactly as shown and works very well.
B010NJT4VS|4|Good quality, synthetic, work well with both powder and liquid makeup products.
B00LOY1OY2|3|I really wanted to like these blades, but I don't.  They are made in the USA which is great, but they don't compare Feather or PolSilver.  Maybe medical preparation blades really aren’t the best choice for shaving your face.
B000QRFGP6|1|it does not smell  the same does not tingle at all - I don't think it is mojo at all :(
B007YQWAPG|5|These are the best!
B00WHQZDRK|4|OK，but too soft.
B0030ZCG8G|5|just as expected
B004AZZ0QK|5|I sent this to a friend to try. She loved it...and just from my own experience, it is the best mascara ever. You will find lashes you didn't know you had.  Lengthens lashes with an innovative brush.  Stays on till you take it off with remover.
B003LR3MQ8|5|Great product.
B00DUQ30QW|5|Love this stuff. Keeps my hair really straight
B001KYY0U6|5|I like this kit.  The colors are great on my fair skin.  This would be great for a young girl who is first wearing make-up, or for someone looking to shake up her routine (like me).  Love the lip gloss, but I can't find it at the Bare Essentuals store!
B001OMIA1Y|5|I bought this and was not sure how I would like it, but to my surprise, I LOVED it!  The negative user comment on this product sounds like she was using a darker shade than her actual skin tone, so that is where her issue stems from.  I use the light to fair and it blends perfectly.  It's like I'm not even wearing makeup!  I spend a lot of time in & on the lake in the summers and never had an issue with this product making my face look like it was melting.  I have received so many comments since I've started using this product.  I use it everyday to replace foundation and concealer.  I would recommend this product to anyone!
B00QEFF91A|5|I've read so many reviews, read do many ads about the ingredients in this dermalift. All the brands seem good, but I decided on this one.  It goes into your skin very quickly with a tightening effect.  I feel like my skin is brighter.  I've only used it for 2 months and so far so good.  I'm happy with this product.
B00NOAKUBM|5|Really love this diffuser, I love the color lights & different variations.  Diffusses a great mist, runs a long time, and whisper quiet. I will be getting another one for my house.
B007SNGSFS|5|Great price.
B0010XUU9M|5|My wife (of course) found out about this product and this is her second order for this product. She has always found Neutrogena products to perform above and beyond her expectations and they have not let her (Us) down. WE use their Rainbath Soap for<br />years. Great in the shower.
B0068OU494|5|I bought this because it was being sold at my tanning salon for $75 (price gouge much?) And it is great. it smells nice (like mixed berries) and it gives you a great tan
B001ET768U|5|And I've been using it exclusively for over 10 years after trying Bag Balm, Corn Huskers, Gold Bond, you-name-it. No other product I've found comes even close to the effectiveness of this cream on severely chapped, dry, and /or cracked  skin on hands and feet.<br /><br />A dollop smaller than a marble is totally adequate for both hands or both feet. Absorbed fully within a few minutes. Forget wearing gloves to bed. I'll guarantee you that applying it, oh, say 15 minutes before going to bed for 3 to 4 nights in a row will cure all but flesh-eating bacteria! Not hype - fact!
B001ET76EE|5|I was in the drug trial for dupilumab (by Regeneron). They obviously require me to use a moisturizer every day and this was the one I selected because the alternative, Vaseline, is just too greasy and while it may be a better moisture barrier, Vaseline has always seemed to insulate my body heat which makes me itch more.<br /><br />Sure, I'm at the extreme end of the spectrum and may only get four or five days out of a 16 oz jar but my skin stays hydrated for close to 12 hours on this. Other over the counter topicals like Eucerin and Lubriderm last *maybe* three or four hours if you can tolerate what feels like a thin oil slick on your skin.<br /><br />I take my morning shower with [[ASIN:B005HO0ARM Dove Body Wash with NutriumMoisture, Sensitive Skin, 24 Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]] and then apply a generous layer of this while still damp. In less than three minutes, I'm ready to put clothes on without them feeling like they're getting stuck to the lotion.<br /><br />This is definitely worth a try. It's the good stuff.<br /><br />PS - If you have eczema, pray dupilumab gets approved by the FDA. In phase 2b of the trial, I was *completely* cured...to the degree that I took hot showers, was running around being physical and sweating, etc.
B00YO69D7M|5|Received my brush and I am more than satisfied.<br />The wooden handle feels solid and sturdy unlike other plastic brushes, and the boars hair glides beautifully through the beard. Far better than synthetic hair brushes I've owned.<br />The shape eliminates that annoying center mass irritation I've experienced from standard shaped brushes and the ends are great for the swooping of the mustache, it even slides through my thick Italian head hair.<br />All in all, great product for the bearded.
B000C1Z8DG|5|Fast delivery -  great product
B000URVDRW|5|I'm absolutely obsessed! It feels fantastic gliding on, does a good job of exfoliating and moisturizing, and stays silky on your skin for hours afterwards. The smell is absolutely divine. I love the smell of coconut as well as pineapple and together (hello, pi&ntilde;a colada) they're heavenly.<br /><br />I live in Texas and my jar arrived in quite a liquid state, so be careful when opening it for the first time if you do too. Soon after, the contents settled into a semi-liquid state that's easy to scoop onto your body. If you live in a cold climate you may have to warm up the jar as the coconut oil can solidify.<br /><br />Quite a good value for the price. Just be careful because it can make your shower floor quite slippery.
B00THEGVCG|4|I had to write a review because this is not your typical serum. I feel like this is all about the C (which is why I bought it) and it seems like it's really good quality and well made, but it's not like the moisturizing serums you might be used to. It sinks in and you're ready for moisturizer. -And their moisturizer is fab. Very happy so far. I'll upgrade to 5 stars if I love it after a few weeks. :)
B0050QLE4U|5|For some reason we don't really own them long without them falling apart.  This one looks better made than the last two we have bought at the local store.  I hae high hopes for this one.
B0009K34DG|5|The choice is to not use your Braun shaver or to purchase new blades, and if you want to continue to use it, it is worthwhile to get these!
B005PYK9CK|5|I tend to have issues with my feet so when i saw and purchased these foot files i was hoping that it would work well. I was very pleased when i recieved my foot files with the quality and the size of them. They work great and bc i got 5 i was able to give a couple to my family to use and we all are happy with them. I may purchase more of them in the future for maybe some gifts.
B003UKM9CO|4|My old Oral-B toothbrush died after 7 years, so I decided to go with this one.  It works just as well as my old brush and was 1/3 the price!
B00ESKOLU8|5|This product is as good if not better than name brand serum. i have extremely bad skin :( and used pretty much everything there is for my face. this line of facial products are the only thing that worked for me.
B00FZKB51S|5|So pleased with these brushes got them in two days with the free two day shipping! Anyways besides that they are so soft...! Beautifully made, They pick up the product very well. Freaking awesome brushes!😊
B00285GYQO|4|if you're not familiar with LUSH cosmetics, first I need to say that they are all natural cosmetic products made from organic ingredients. I have started to use their products and already I see a HUGE difference in my skin. LUSH cosmetics also works to minimize packaging. Therefore whatever product they can make into a solid as opposed to the liquid version (which will then require a plastic bottle, hence more waste for our earth) they will! The toner tabs are no exception to this solid form of a usually liquid face product.<br /><br />HOW TO: For each tablet, you'll need 2 cups of hot (or boiling) water. Put the hot water in a pot or large bowl, have a large towel ready, and your toner tab ready. Put towel over head to create a tent between your head and the hot bowl of water (a steam sauna for your face!). Drop in the toner tab and watch it fizz! Keep your face/head covered with the towel over the steaming bowl of toner vapor for about 5-10 minutes. When time is up, pat dry your face and see the magnificent results of these amazing products!<br /><br />When you're done with the water, you can use it as toner water on a cotton ball. You can also put the water in a spray bottle and use it to sprints on your face when you need that pick me up. But this toner in a bottle only has a shelf life of 5-7 days since there are no preservatives!!!! Keep in the refrigerator and pull out when you use it as a toner.<br /><br />Another hint, you can fill up said bottle with left over toner water, and FREEZE the rest into ice cubes! That way you can melt one cube at a time to use for that week so your product last longer.<br /><br />To extend the life of these tabs, you can also cut the tab in half with a knife, and drop the half in 1 cup of water. Tada! Now you can store the other solid away for awhile while you enjoy  your 1 cup of toner.<br /><br />Last hint, you can add 1-2 drops of Grape fruit essential oil to the mix since the citrus in the grapefruit EO acts as a natural preservative as does a few drops of Vitamin E oil. (shelf life is still VERY short and I would STILL keep this product in the fridge).<br /><br />**So on to reviewing of the actual product itself, for both a steam cleansing session and the toner water afterwards:**<br /><br />Honestly, it was kind of annoying to sit there with my head under a towel for 5-10 minutes. I only lasted 3!!! I couldn't stand how boring and NOT therapeutic it was, for me personally. I'd rather be in a large steam room in a spa than to sit there under a towel. ;) But that's simply a preference thing. I just don't want to do it. I'd rather use another product that does the same thing with a different method.<br /><br />I poured the rest of the water into a spray bottle and squirted this toner on my face. I wasn't that impressed. Especially since I've already been using the Breath of Fresh Air toner water mix! That and the already mixed Tea Tree Toner water! There really isn't a competition from these tabs to the actual bottle of toner water. The bottles are better. That's it.<br /><br />But it was fun to experiment with these tabs. I think they probably work best as a steam tab, for which I was too impatient to stay the amount of time requested.<br /><br />Overall, pretty good product, but just not my cup of tea. But I most definitely will be using the toner water these hot summer months for a pick me up for my T-zone oily skin.<br /><br />It's only $2. A $2 \\"mistake\\"... eh. No big deal. ;)<br />Also, I'd go into a LUSH Cosmetics store near you to smell and test all their products. SO WORTH IT!! Their stuff really is amazing. You should see my skin! =)tamin E oil.

B00YU1LWHA|5|It's a good hair the curls are nice. Very soft. I went in the pool with it n it didn't tangle so that awesome (it actually looks really nice when wet). I have it in for two weeks now n I haven't seen any shredding so that's another plus. It does have a weird smell for real. I got 12,14 16&#34; it's not as long as I thought it would be. I would definitely recommend n reorder this product. The seller does send info about the product and such which I thought was nice.
B0009MFUPO|3|Item appears to indicate that 3 complete heads are included in box.<br />What is in the box is only 3 each individual round heads without the assembly that they sit in.<br />The picture shows the three heads mounted in the assembly.  This is misleading & incorrect.<br />The individual heads were new and fit properly (and sharp for a close shave), but I expected the 3 outer<br />mountings as well, as noted on the box & on the Amazon picture.
B001OOLLVS|4|I saw a vast improvement in only a few days<br />I had a little sensitivity but didn't last, good product
B00B40L7TI|5|I have been using the elaria products for many years...I am a huge lotion person and these are by far the best I have come across and I love, love, love the baby powder smell of this one. One of my favs
B0027LSEPS|5|I used to see, I bought also my friend.<br />It's really satisfying products.<br />Gotta do not have to use onerous dental floss.<br />If you use this thing I feel after brushing becomes very clear.
B00HJCC9BA|4|I've only used.this for two weeks, and because I've been going through a lot of stress, I'm showing very little diffence.  I blame it on stress and will give it another couple weeks.  I expect, after my stress level lowers and get more than 3 hours of sleep at night, to see more of a change.
B000TGC7TM|5|I have been using Nioxin products for years due to genetic thining hair.  Although my hair is very fine and thin, I believe the products are responsible for my not having developed bald spots.
B00BOBKSLK|5|Used this in some lotions and body butters I've made. It smells like cocoa & works nicely. My skin is softer than ever since using it. I love it and will definitely order again.
B00537G6MQ|4|This is my first needle roller. I went with this one because I read that stainless steel needles were good and durable and of course the price. I was worried about the 1.5mm length being painful, but after all the laser treatments and peels I've had from a dermatologist, I barely felt it. The second time I pressed a bit harder and it still wasn't painful. I have used it 4x now and I will say while too early for dramatic results, I am seriously looking harder to see some of my scars! I have deep, pitted scars and hyperpigmentaion from sun/ derm procedures. The newer scars look the same, but the older ones that have previously been cut on which left scars from the stiches are faded a bit- which after 4 treatments with the dermaroller I can say that I am pleased with.     The needle roller itself, is plastic. In the photo it looked metal, stainless steel-but that is just really cheap paint. After the first treatment when I rinsed it off with hot water, I noticed the paint around the roller sides where the needle disc is chipped off. I am not sure if I would repurchase this one in particular or just try a different model.    All in all, I would say it gets the job done, but since it's my first I can't say if there are better ones out there. I ordered just to see if this would help in any way, and I'm pleased to say that in a short time I am seeing a bit of improvment and I will continue treatments. I wish there was an actual cleanser for the needle roller. I have read to disinfect it with hot water, alcohol, betadine, even denture tablets- I would feel more comfortable with a dedicated cleaner though.
B00OBWSBGS|5|I was hesitant to write a review until after using the product for a significant time and determining its effectiveness. Different from others I was not expecting much but to my surprise this product is deserving of its good reviews. My skin after shaving has always been very sensitive but besides moisturizing, it has acted as a calming effect on my skin. I will continue to use and will but again.
B0002G214U|5|This Conair Soft Bonnet Hair Dryer is a great product and purchasing this will save you money from going to the salon. This is a great Birthday, Mother day & Christmas gift.
B002PMWP5Y|3|Probably it is bcs I have black hair so it didnt really show the color suppose to be. But even though my hair did turn lighter which is a kinda dark-brownish color now. And my hair did not dry out or damaged from dyeing so yeah...
B0068OK7V4|3|Ok whiten your teeth alittle. Need like 4 to completely whiten... good product though .I would buy again. Small though
B001F51QG6|5|This product is great. I just bought it and already see results. It did bother my gums in the beginning but it gets better each time I use it. I honestly, don't mind the aftertaste and I love how smooth my teeth feel. I use it at night after brushing. The results are great! I also love waking up in the morning and having a clean feeling mouth. It lasts all night long.
B006PKYSYS|4|This Keratin mask is great for damaged, dry, and tangled hair!
B0026729NQ|5|Excellent
B005ESSV6S|5|Excellent product! Superb!
B002GCOV1O|3|Over all there ok..i ordered midnight brown .its pretty dark..w a hint of brown..kinda blackish brown.. i actually dyed my hair to match it..hmm the hair is a bit shiny so make sure to put a little baby powder to matte it out..no shine.overall these are believable..just make sure it matches ur hair..there worth buying..great pric ..
B0049MEHZY|5|Great
B0015AFWH0|1|upon arrival and opened the box it said on the box are impression of paris hilton. on serching the box on the back it clearly says \\"not associated with the makers of paris hilton.\\" yet they show a picture of the bottle that says paris hilton. sent it back immeaditley and will order the real product from anotehr seller or from amazon direct. if it is going on or in ur body it better be high quality and not a cheap knock off very very dissatisfied and fiance was not happy as it was a birthday gift.
B001JJBC9Y|4|Fairly new user, but at this point I can say that this performs far better than any other razor I've purchased in the past.  It's fast, relatively quiet, and powers through everything I've thrown at it.<br /><br />The reason I've not given it a full 5 is that, even when set to its lowest distance, I can't get quite as close of a shave as I'd like for the areas I want to keep clean shaven.  Also, the guides are somewhat long and can make it a bit difficult to do any beard/mustache trimming near your nose.
B00EOP4SMS|5|The only perfume I wear!! Love it!!
B00DGRDQC8|5|Awesome product for grooming the entire body. Definitely recommend.
B00NLKAVL4|1|The smell was too strong. The spray nozzle didn't work right. Very Disappointed!
B00GMMJKUQ|5|Love KBShimmer glitters!!! Will have them all!
B0073B3F06|5|Along with the conditioner, leaves white hair shiny, soft and manageable.
B00EPMBGRA|4|These work really well on callused hands from working out and heels. The cut is very thin so you may want to go over it a couple of times, but be careful. The razors dull rather quickly, but with 12 double sided replacements it should last a while.
B003YJ9YBU|5|I absolutely LOVE this cleanser!  I bought this after a recommendation from my new aesthetician.  She has amazing skin and I asked her about her skin regime.  She let me in on this secret cleanser of hers, along with PCA products (which I will also review) and have been using this for a few weeks, twice a day.  My skin has never looked better!!  It has glycolic acid in it, but it is gentle, does not hurt your skin or face, and yes!  You can use it twice a day!!  :)  I would recommend this to everyone.
B000NWGCZ2|5|We found this lotion about 2 years ago and it was a life saver. My 11 year old son has battled eczema since he was 18 mos.old so you can imagine the number of lotions and creams and miracle cures we have tried.  His eczema just made him miserable and I felt terrible that I was using the steroid creams and non-steroid Elidel prescription creams that I never felt could ever be safe for as long as he had been using them. My son had a really bad winter a couple years ago that required a visit to the dermatologist and once again they prescribed some prescription cream that actually did not work this time again. The nurse had also given us a couple tiny samples of this Vanicream and it was the nurse that urged me to try it. I wondered why I had never seen it or heard of it before but she had told me it was not a prescription, but you had to get it behind the pharmacy counter. We finally bought some after the Dr. cream didn't work again! My son tried it and he actually felt pretty soft after it and it lasted more than just a few hours. After about a week of using it after showers, his eczema spots were gone and he wasn't itching himself raw every night. He was the one that came to me and said that he liked it and it was working and of course it was easy for him because it was a cream but had the pump. So I cannot tell enough people how good Vanicream is and it doesn't have any fragrance or steroids. I was told that it was kept behind the pharmacy counter because it is used as the base in compounded lotion prescriptions. But obviously does an excellent job by itself.
B006JAPT6K|5|Delivery fast, long lasting batteries, will reorder when time comes. Easy to get out for turn dial and insert into aids
B000P3X9YG|5|This smells soooo good. Will purchase again!!
B004HYRH06|5|I love the brush liner which is so much better than the felt tip liners. I can create thin or thick lines especially the flicks. Ultra black is a great color and stays put all day. The product lasted for 4-5 months. Not sure if my lashes are longer or fuller but I would definitely recommend it as an eyeliner.
B007UM8ZGM|1|THIS LOOKS LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD PAINT A COLORING BOOK WITH. A BABY BOOK. BECAUSE EVEN CRAYONS ARE BETTER THAN THIS.
B008KNAHHU|4|I was looking for something inexpensive and added some of my mom's lace to it.  I didn't want to spend a bunch of money for something i would wear for 1 hour, so this worked perfectly!!
B00880VZPI|5|I was surprised to read the one review which said the product did not work. I did not get overnight results. But I kept with it and applied it every night. After a couple of weeks I thought maybe I could see some change. After 4 weeks there was definitely an improvement. After 8 weeks the difference was drastic and wonderful.<br /><br />For me, this most certainly worked and I am ordering my second tube now. I would recommend it to anyone. But be patience and be consistent.
B00ONFM5D8|5|Definitely makes my face softer than any other product I've used before.  Love it!
B0009VNIA4|5|I absolutely cannot live without this gel. I am Black with natural hair, and the way this specific blue gel lays my hair down it is incredible! And it holds ALL day, with no real hard, stiff, flaky mess to deal with later.
B00VGNWFO4|4|I decided to try this after seeing the infomercial. I came to Amazon to check out the reviews and bought the 3oz bottles at first. I didn't want to spend a lot of money, and I definitely didn't want to get enrolled in a monthly payment plan.<br /><br />I have very fine hair. Before WEN, it had been getting gradually more and more frizzy, to the point where I was convinced that I just had bad hair. It was depressing, and I was desperate for something that would work.<br /><br />When I first tried WEN, there was no immediate change. I decided to chalk it up to another product that failed to deliver. I also noticed that my scalp felt more oily and heavy.<br /><br />Then I saw the infomercial again and realized I was not using it as a leave-in conditioner. So the next time I washed, I put about a nickel's worth of it on my hair after rinsing. That's when I noticed a difference. For the first time in my life, my hair was curly! I've always wanted naturally curly hair, but I could never achieve it. I can't use a curli... Read more
B00BG5HJ16|5|Awesome other then it being really small. Didn't make it through the whole Key West trip
B000NBQUNW|5|Buy this product.  Tell your friends about it.  Unfortunately J&J doesn't have a clue of how to market this great product, don't let it slip out of production. I am in club Benecol and haven't received anything. Spread the word, a safer way to lower your cholesterol. Word of mouth is about it, lets hope it works.  <br /> <br />Don't expect miracles with Benecol, but if you are borderline, this is a great supplement in addition to diet and exercise. Take at least 2 per day.  Expect ~10% lower total cholesterol in a month or two, some have reported more. Could be enough to keep you off the risky statins.  However, some report using Benecol and Statins, but I can't vouch for the results. It would be good to hear reports of that combo.  <br />
B008LXAB5C|4|Nice adhesive, and handy applicator, only complaint is the bottles are tiny... But than again it's not like you need a Ton of this stuff anyway, a little goes a long way. Hold well...even while swimming in a pool and the ocean.
B00AMH8RYC|5|THIS IS A GRATE grate grate.....( product ) !!!!!!!!!!! I've  never felt so happy about my hair an the hole 2 years an 5 months I've been natural MY HAIR IS 4.C TYPE AN I WAS TOLD THAT 4.C HAIR is nappy an hard to grow but that where wrong i love my hair since i've researched how to grow 4.c hair an in fact 4.c hair has more protein layers then any other hair texture. So that means it's strong an it grows natural hair needs a p.h balance to help moisture an the hair an this conditioner is a ph balanced cleansing conditioner witch is grate for 4.c hair because it'd naturally DRY this hole line of cocoa curls is amazing an any natural that trys it will say so them self.
B000PU6A7C|4|WORKED GREAT ON MY WIFES HAIR
B00HWFW7ES|5|Love it! I use it every day. Best Christmas gift ever!
B0027LSEPS|5|Great product! Bought it for my 12 years old daughter, for her braces. Much easier and faster than flossing. She doesn't have to charge it every night. So less stress for me. Battery lasted surprisingly long... After 3 month still Ok. I think she is using at least twice a day. Easy to use, works great. Highly recommend.
B00II2FF3E|5|I bruise easily, especially after having my second child. This cream reduces bruises by several days, even if the bruise has been there a while. Big surprise to me was how it healed a deep bruise I'd had on my leg for 4 years - no joke! I kept hitting the same spot on my leg with the car door and this was a bruise within a bruise. I didn't think it would ever go away, and a few days of rubbing in this cream did it. Wish I'd known about it years ago! And it was especially nice that this seller sent an email to me outlining how to achieve optimal results. I would recommend this cream to everyone.
B000EOR49W|5|Another recommendation from a massage therapist that was well worth the purchase!  I expected little results and received much relief from knee pain!
B0033EUIO8|4|I love the wide jaw, but I with the blade was straight instead of angled
B000GI3TPO|2|I didn't like this product.  I think it actually dries my hair out.  It may not be the same for your hair.  My hair is of a fine texture so I have to be very careful with the products I use.  I usually love Senscience products but not this one.
B00DSJ3QGU|1|I bought the backpack for my 16 year old student and the straps separated from the pack within 2 weeks.<br />Cheap material
B003NV0QBG|2|The makeup is great. The packaging and container, not so much.  This is the second time I have purchased this product, only to open the box and be covered in mineral powder.  The \\"case\\" was covered; the brush was covered.  I opened up the case, and it was not sealed; powder came out and attacked me.  I spent 10 minutes cleaning up the mess.  I have no idea if I actually ended up with the amount of makeup I purchased, and they only have a horribly messy packaging plant.  I do know that it doesn't seem sanitary, and the case containing the makeup is incredibly hard to open, so when I DO try to use it, more will spill out.<br /><br />If you purchase this mineral powder, plan on opening it over a sink EVERY TIME.<br /><br />I wish they would go back to carrying it under the joint marketing with Costco/Kirkland.  That product was clean, sanitary, and well packaged.
B0031B1MMA|5|my wife loves this shampoo and Amazon has become the only store I buy it from I have heard or read reviews about people saying that the product was watered down but to avoid that I make sure that I buy from a Amazon prime vendor so that if I have that problem I can send it back
B00H1B19JM|5|great brush!
B00ICPLHCU|5|I have a bad habit of not wearing sunscreen and I have started to see the problems I have created for myself when it comes to getting wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. yikes!<br /><br />I was doubtful about a pill, but after a couple weeks this stuff really started to work! Sure enough my skin has become smoother again and I don’t actually need moisturizer anymore. I guess it makes sense for a supplement to work by adding to your health from the inside instead of just a topical solution. In a way it actually saves you money because you don’t have to buy a bunch of different products.<br /><br />Be mindful that you won’t see the improvement immediately; like all health supplements it takes at least a couple weeks, but keep going because it DOES work.
B002CVTVW8|1|After getting our new Healthy White SoniCare, we needed another brush head. The only ones I found while out shopping which fit the Healthy White, were the HydroClean brush heads. I don't care for these at all, since there is a thin row of bristles on the outsides. They are also scratchy on the gums. I much prefer the ProResults brush heads and would order online if need be (just to avoid the HydroClean type).
B00763LZWQ|3|The edges don't connect the whole length of the bristles and this causes toothpaste to get stuck and harden.  Would be a good tooth brush if it weren't for that
B001FWXFVS|5|I used to wear this back in the day. It smells awsum and still get compliments. I was shock to have found it on amazon as people on e-bay want premium price for it as it's not made anymore. you can't go wrong on this one.
B00C0CE98K|5|I have used this seller many times and you will not be disappointed using them! I had my tape in extensions in for almost 3 months and had to take them out so they could be moved up as you will always have to do. I am still able to use them and they are still as soft as when i first got them.
B00BQ21PGY|5|Luv it and would recommend it. It makes my skin feel moisturized. My mom used it 25 years ago I use to dip in it. Could not find it anywhere and lo and behold!
B00J86HFB4|3|The problem is they last only two times then need to be replaced.
B009HULKLW|5|Heatless curls for me started at bantu knots, twistouts, braidouts, and cocoon curls. The curls achieved by theses curlformers ARE amazing. For those of us that still remember shirley temple and her iconic curls, you would be gussing over your soft bouncy curls. So stop looking at the price and get them now, 40 in a pack is more than enough. I wish I could post a pic for everyone to see. If you have any daughters, this would be the most adorable hairstyle, but I don't know how little girls would enjoy sleeping with these curlformers over night. They haven't quite learned that with beauty comes pain lol. I have been told when you are in a rush you can just pop your head under a blow dryer but I do no not recommend any form of heat with these curlformers. These curlformers are made with some sort of plastic and heating up plastic can be very dangerous. When plastics heats up their bonds break and when these bonds break, the things that make up the plastic like dioxins are released and they are extremely toxic and carcinogenic (cancer causing). I know natural divas out there would not even dream about using heat now ;)<br />Still gussing over these curls because the compliments never stop. Be the trend setter among your friends make them green with envy then give out the name of this magic tool and they will surely follow. ENJOY!
B004BLXG5U|5|I've purchased bleach refills several times now and they all work as good as the next as long as the percentages are the same.  Now I just shop by price and quantity.  I keep them refrigerated until use and they work great.  Told my dentist when he tried to sell me more and he was not happy.
B00GR0EI9Q|4|First use was good overall. Uncomfortable tug first few passes. Aloe reduces redness on the neck. I did not get a chance to use the precision flip cap. Very smooth feel I hope it last as long as the last  cartridge razor I had
B00240MO2G|4|It's floss, this brand just seems smoother to me. It would be hard for me to use another brand.
B00A3C3N5O|3|a lot of the same styled designs. the stamp isn't that great and doesn't stop accurately, unless im just bad at using it. the plates are really sharp so be careful! wish it came in a more sturdy case or something because the plates just scratch each other if you don't find something to put it in. comes exactly like the picture in a clear bag thing...
B000C20ZKQ|3|I wish that you work the more and more to improve it quality because I find the quality isn't anough strong.
B003WR3QSG|5|This is so natural and good quality! Thumbs up!
B000H7O5M0|5|terrific till i dropped it in the toilet.  don't do that.
B001BBOLOI|1|I have purchased this product at Ulta in the past and loved it. Ulta is no longer carrying it,so I went with my staple for purchases lately;Amazon. It seems that the product has chanched after applying it two times I got the feeling and appearance of windburn on my lips. It took the problem about one week to heal. I had to use the Vaseline product for lips about twice daily for the week. It eased the discomfort while helping to resolve my problem. I,sadly,won't be applying it again.
B00DPICES0|2|The scent is too strong. I really can't say how well it works because I don't think I ever use enough of it. Not an overly bad smell, just too much.
B00MBL1K2S|5|Love it, I use the rose water and rose hip oil at night.  My skin is so soft and smells wonderful.  I've only used for a week and I notice the acne clearing up and some little bumps I've had forever on my forehead are gone.  Quality product for sure.
B00EJDAWYI|4|This eyeliner was so easy to put on!  It stays on where I put it, too.  It really is waterproof and is still on when I wake up in the morning.  There was no smudging.  The three &#34;prongs&#34; are great if you just want to leave dots of eyeliner between lashes.  It is more subtle than the stark line across the lid which you can also do with this tool.  Either way, it is a good eyeliner, and I recommend it...but there is a lower price elsewhere.
B002SV145E|5|Thanks soo much! The order was received fast and I got my item quickly, plus the price is very reasonable. I can only get 1 of these products for $10 at most stores & i bought two packages from you for about $14!  I will continue to buy this from you in the future if it's in stock. :) you have great deals!  thanks again
B002EP9OUG|5|I've tried it all, and this kit has been the best thing I've ever used for hair removal downstairs. Adding extra wax is a big no no with soft wax, and creates an impossible mess that practically requires a can WD-40 to clean up. I really like that with this product, if you don't get enough wax on an area, you can build it up by just adding more on top, and be able to remove hairs without all the excess pulling! The strip-less application and removal made for a lot less mess, and I was able to wax with complete confidence. I am a new addict to the Gigi hard wax, and I will definitely buy more in the future!
B0001ZZUBS|5|This nail polish is beautiful. My little girl loves how it sparkles. It does take a while to dry but otherwise it is wonderful. The company says to take it off with their remover or alcohol, but my daughter's wore off after a week (which was fine with me). I did not purchase their remover because it has some things in it I don't want on my daughter, I recommend just using alcohol (saves you money too).
B0014EBMJ4|5|Excellent purchase!
B001AC1V5U|2|Before buying this product I tried to research it as much as possible. I read the reviews on here which were mostly negative looked on YouTube which was a little better also googled it. The problem that I seen most people having was with matching the product with their skin tone. A lot of people said it was too dark though the product worked well was dark and had a clay look to it. Knowing all this I decided to give it a shot anyway but I told myself I would get a lighter shade. Ok I ordered the product the shipping was very quick which was nice. I put the product on my skin and looky looky it was too dark! I bought it lighter than me and it still was too dark. It had a reddish tint to it and my skin is a medium brown plus I tried to take it off and did not come off for the life of me even after I scrubbed it. My opinion of this product is that it works oh yeah it certainly worked BUT the color was all wrong unless you don't mind having two toned colored skin by all means knock yourself out but that defeats the whole purpose of buying the product! Don't make the mistake of buying this like I did.
B00J97OA10|5|Very pretty & sparkly!!!
B000N758A2|5|Best. Smells great, leaves hair soft.
B001CSZTFK|5|I love this toothbrush design.
B00DUFZYC6|3|I use it for cooking
B00H3GE5F0|5|The color matched perfectly! Its a lot of hair!<br />I got it super fast and love it!
B001KYOJDE|2|This does not last very long and gets funny looking. The Outlast Smoothwear 880 that I've used for years lasted all day and looked good all day. This is really not a similar color or similar quality. I will not buy it again.
B004O9TRVQ|4|It was exactly what we were looking for in a sample kit. My daughter enjoyed ever bottle and scent that was in the kit.
B004N8H2H4|5|I've struggled with dry lips for years and feel like I have tried a very wide variety of products, done a lot of research, reached out to my Doctor, etc.  For me, this Rose Salve has made night and day difference.  My lips are no longer peeling or chapped and I am no longer constantly picking at them.  The scent is stronger than other products but not overwhelming.  At first I needed to use it 24/7.  After a few days I was using it a lot less frequently but my lips were still happy.  Now I use it a couple of times a day and wouldn't dream of going back to any other product.
B0033AYPXC|5|I bought this palette to hold some eyeshadows that were taking up too much room and this palette holds all 15 of them with room for more. It also allowed me to color code them so they are perfectly organized and save a lot of space. i have not traveled with it yet but it has held up really well. I love all the color and pattern choices it comes in- I have the pink one but am looking into getting a small peacock or leopard print one for lipstick.
B000K5WKIA|5|Grate
B003DBIOJM|5|I had to go through some grief(tax) in customs but it was worth it. The product was genuine and packaged ok. Plus Gold Bond rocks!
B00188KN50|5|I love this perfume, bought it on Maui and cant be without it now!! Reminds my husband and I of how the air smelled while we were there. Beautiful and fragrant!! Thank you. Fast shipment and wonderful personal note included!
B0027LSEPS|5|For one who has a filling in every tooth, this product came uears too late.  Great dental health tool.  Government should provide one for everyone.
B004WPHZDO|5|Great scent for the summer. This is an unexpected combo but it works. It smells wonderful! Everyone i meet want to know what scent i am wearing.
B000VUXE5M|5|best lip balm ever.
B007ID2MS0|5|I love this product.  My hairdresser turned me on to it 3-4 years ago, and I re-order anytime I&#34;m getting low.  Holds great without any stickiness or tackiness -- leaves hair feeling like there's no spray at all, but holds well.
B00AHF1GTM|5|I was given a sample of this product by Schick.  Usually, a disposable razor leaves my legs feeling dry and itchy. I almost always cut myself if I use a disposable.  That being said, I had none of those problems with this particular razor.  There is a moisturizing strip built in that keeps my skin hydrated. In fact, I found that I don't have to use as much shaving cream! Before this razor, I bought expensive shave gel to help my sensitive skin.  I can actually use the normal brands of shaving cream with this razor. I recommend that you store the razor with the blades facing up so that the moisturizing strip isn't touching the shower.  When I place it blades down, there is always some residue left from where it was sitting even with the cap on.  Still, that's a minor issue for such a great result!
B0000Y3G0C|5|Like the reviewer below me said, I have sensitive skin that is prone to breakouts. There are very few products I can use other than Proactiv that don't irritate my skin, but this is one of them. I use it as a night time moisturizer since it doesn't contain SPF. When I wake up, my skin is so soft and never bothered by the product. From time to time, I will use it in the day time and it NEVER leaves any greasy residue. I HIGHLY recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin looking for a good moisturizer!
B009M1K396|5|LOVE IT!! LOVE IT!! This product should actually be rated 10 stars.  Besides it looking great (looks like real leather), its very functional.  Fits all my nail polish, even the larger sized ones, and nail accessories too!...excited to see what other products SHANY has out.  Will definately be buying from this company again!!
B009QFKFSC|5|Keri Advanced is the only choice for me because I like the &#34;ungreasiness&#34; factor, and when applied while my body is still damp after towel-drying from my daily shower, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and supple. My skin is 81 years young, and feels smoooooth!
B002Z6M22Q|5|He estado usando esta colonia por más de un año y debo decir que ya soy un fanático de ella. Con una esencia masculina y que perdura a l lago del día, esta colonia es un éxito seguro!
B00JJHUOUQ|3|The length is wonderful and the shipping was speedy! However the color is a lot lighter than imagined and I haven't found a dye that'll darken it to save my life.
B00AYJ2FM8|5|works!
B00L6JKSGK|5|I bought this mirror plate last year, it was good.
B00L7SNXN0|5|love it!
B007S3HUVY|5|CND products are amazing and speaks for itself. Great color for fall. Goes on smooth and dries nice and smooth
B00L0FAFHC|4|Wore this to a 1920s themed party and I got so many compliments!
B00BBJZJUK|5|I first tried these Loma products when visiting family who had them already. After using once, I am hooked. It's hard to find an organic hair product that smells amazing, but this is it.  It has a fruity tropical smell that reminds me of a resort I visited in the pacific islands.  The price is steep, but shouldn't scare away buyers who are already in the market for organics.
B00HS5NFPW|5|I had one similar to it so i got this one. Way cheaper than my last one, hope it lasts longer than the 4-5 yrs i had before. The color is beautiful, makes my hair smooth and curls the hair as a curler. It came with a helpful CD! i just need to register it for some type of warranty. Wouldn't think about owning a different flat iron, extremely happy with it.
B00GJXGMSQ|5|Excellent quality cosmetic brushes. They are soft, full, and don't shed. Good investment.
B001CJSKUK|3|I cant wipe off the ink so looks like a hot mess. I wish it was a better quality. But good practice
B001E96OYC|4|The oil is great, smells good and produces a soft sheen to my daughters hair. However, the product usually arrives with some oil leakage. The pop tops open and the oil usually spills out onto the packaging. Amazon has always provided the best customer service and replaced the damaged product. I hope the packaging improves (taping the tops closed) so that I can continue to purchase this product.
B003EH23N8|5|I have natural extremely curly hair which is naturally drying and this oil creme is the only thing I have found that makes my hair  soft.  This product gives my hair the much needed moisture!
B00BEJVOOC|2|it was leaking all over the package when i received it ...
B00G5CT4Y0|5|The bottles are well made, and the lids are of good quality. Labeling is easy to read. I like it this way as at this price I can share this product with friends pre-packaged. The shipping was faster than I expected. Will recommend!
B00E4MJE5C|5|I received this as part of a sampling program and was very pleased. I have moderate grey on the top and it covered wonderfully, leaving my hair soft with a great color. I will be buying this product in the future and highly recommend it.
B003CTTZQQ|5|Very thick, good for hair growth... The smell was awful though.
B00MWKV1F4|4|First of all I didn't like the color palate at all. The only one I kinda liked was whisper and it's sorta the color of foundation. The lipstick itself is nice not sticky but the colors just struck me as something a 90 yr old grandma would wear. For this color palate I would also suggest very white teeth because of the hues it will definitely bring out any discoloration. I gave it 4 stars because the seller sent quickly and because it's not their fault I didn't care for the colors I do really like the lipstick itself though. I think I would have liked other colors in this type of lipstick but I would suggest using a lip stick brush for the more pigmented colors but it does wipe off easy so it's not a necessity.
B0052P11F6|5|as i said above, this product is amazazing. i give this product 5.999999999 stars. yeah. ya know how i be. so y'all should really buy this thang. it frickin rocks. my hair looks sexay and beautiful e'rday. and at my school, that is quite rare, my fran. so just buy it. it will change all y'alls lives. it really will. even dr oz. recommended it.
B001LNWX1O|2|These are smallish poofs for adults but a good size for children. The first one I put in the shower started loosing form after a month of every day use by one person. They feel like cheap plastic with a lot of gaps in the weaving almost like the Baby Bell mini cheese nets. You know what I mean...
B003XUROEY|4|It may be that I am asking for miracles here. There does come a time when one is past the point of no return and I think I'm there, unless I try injections and fillers.<br /><br />I've tried this product now for two weeks and at least it has done no damage, which is great since I have extra sensitive skin. There is a little bit of redness around the lip line but they tell you that will happen.<br /><br />Let's face it, I've been a senior citizen for awhile now and I think no amount of applied creams will help everything. I do think the finer wrinkles are better and I will have to see how it goes in eight weeks for the wrinkles they call marionette lines. Stay tuned for more information in a month and a half. In the meantime, I do feel it's a good product, so I'm giving it at least a four.
B001E96NF2|5|ok
B000141POA|5|excelent!
B00B9M5OCW|5|Nice. Not exactly like a beanie hat, but pretty close. It doesn't hang, but cuffs the back of your head. All in all, nice.
B006Z8B5HS|5|I bought this over a year ago and there is just less than half left in the bottle.  This is the only shampoo I use.  At first I used 2 pumps cuz it was a little hard getting used to shampoo that didn't suds. Now I use 1 pump on my below shoulder length hair.  My hair stays cleaner longer too!  My 55 year old dyed hair feels like a teenager!  I love the It's a 10 product line!
B003JN7LSE|5|China Glaze is my favorite brand of nail polish.  Rarely do I find a shade I do not LOVE, and they did not disappoint here.
B001MA0QY2|5|Great product.  Love it
B00CD5YMRM|5|I absolutely love this shave gel. There is nothing better out there for a man to use if he has sensitive skin. I like to shape my sideburns and this gel being clear allows me to see exactly what I am shaving rather than having to guess like I used to. Since I began using this product I no longer cut or nick my face when shaving and rarely do I get any razor burn. This product is a must have for any man that still likes to shave with a blade.
B00CJHH2ZS|5|I really like these and for the price you cannot go wrong ,<br /> I use them on my lower lash line to really give the appearance of very wide eyes I am  very much into getting dressed up and having that Barbie look .very fun product !
B0012HCCNI|4|This product will not replace your standard anti-perspirant but its not a bad natural option if you don't sweat much and its not hot outside and you are willing to reapply it throughout the day.  I put this on in the heat of Southern CA and I started to stink within 2 hours. In addition, the wild rose scent reminds me of a grandma.  I only use this deodorant as a refresher before going to the gym.
B00081NFH6|3|I bought this for my dresser and it looks nice it's kind of hard to  clean though. I would recommend it.
B00PX8CMXC|2|Hurts my sensitive teeth. The one without whitening works much better for sensitive teeth
B0054MSD62|1|Packaged out of sealed paper box, unlike stores, hoping it's the real thing for the person intended to be given to.
B00NOBJMZQ|5|This works great. I used it between my Acupuncture Face lift treatments!
B0074NH9UU|4|During my Tokidoki kick, I picked this and a bunch of the other art palettes up. This one is probably my least favorite.<br /><br />The colors are VERY bold. In the others, the four eyeshadow colors compliment each other really well and are perfect to just throw in my bag. The make up look with these four is good for a night out, but not much else. I appreciate a dark blue, though. You don't see that as much. As well, the iridescent silver is a different texture than the rest and really cakes on easily. The blush, too, is a little bold for my every day skin tone.<br /><br />All and all, the product is fine quality and totally cute, just not for me.
B001ECQS22|5|I was introduced to Pearl Drops by a dental hygienist and loved the way its mild abrasive cleaned my teeth almost like I had been to the dentist. I used Pearl Drops for about 30 years before it started to disappear from the store shelves. For the last 6-7 years I had not been able to find it anywhere, so I was happy to see it was available on line.
B005IGUUBU|5|good
B00DSM1AKQ|5|Good product.
B003KRA712|5|Everything its ok, no problems at all.
B002EA6BK2|5|Wonderful product, very satisfing
B000GRB3SK|1|I bought this aloe Vera Ivory shower gel and used it for a few day. Now my whole body is cover with red spots, and rash, and they are very itchy. Now on my way to allergy skin specialist.
B00EV6J6UE|2|Compared to the regular gloMinerals Satin II foundation, Luxe felt much oilier on my skin. It also did not provide a full coverage like the original does. It also has some shimmering effect, or could it be just the oily nature of this foundation? I am going to stick to GloMinerals protective foundation (http://smile.amazon.com/glominerals-gloProtective-Liquid-Foundation-Honey-Light/dp/B001HXAI8S/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1416879845&sr=8-8&keywords=glominerals)
B005MZMET8|4|It's a thin consistency, dries quick and super hydrated. I use it on my body and face! It works pretty well on my dry hands.<br /><br />The only con is that it's expensive and I can only find it online.
B000NLS1MK|3|I have used home made that costs the same and i think i will go back to it. This soap smells fine but the scent does not stick around and it left skin dry. Its like a bar of lye soap to me with fragrance. Well back to the home made florida water soap for me.
B000U26ZZM|5|My  daughter says so...
B000EHNDD0|5|THIS TOOTHBRUSH IS EASY TO USE AND FEELS GREAT ON THE GUMLINE. I NOTICED THE MANUAL SAYS A FULL CHARGE CAN LAST FOR UP TO 2 WEEKS. THIS MAY BE TRUE FOR SOMEONE WHO BRUSHES ONCE A DAY. WHEN BRUSHING AT LEAST TWICE A DAY A FULL CHARGE WOULD ONLY LAST ABOUT 4 DAYS. THIS COULD BE HELPFUL FOR TRAVELERS.
B004CR3D4W|5|I've used this for years, and I love it. It doesn't sting your skin, and my skin feels refreshed afterwards. I don't have oily skin - if anything, my skin is on the dry side. Since I wear makeup daily, this helps get my skin extra clean and leaves me feeling refreshed.
B0081E6THU|5|I only got the primer & this powder out of the set and this powder is what really makes the difference. I have combination skin, but my skin is just naturally shiny without being oily (though it'll get oily later) & this really covers that up! my skin isnt shiny at all so i love it!! =D
B007JP6X0K|2|to my son does'nt like because smell like  an one kalvin klein (dolce & habana the one sport /1.6oz but think the same thing
B0019N6RFO|1|It does not work. It is not a konad product. Dont buy it. It a waste of money and time. Now i kno why is worth only 0.1 dollars. But the shiping it not free.
B000PY17PI|5|I love it.  It is the perfect hot air brush.
B001J3NDPG|5|I am a huge Jane Iredale fan. Her makeup is natural looking and good for your skin. I think these glosses are great-good color selection and awesome staying power.
B00AKFSG88|1|This in not the real thing, it leaves a terrible residue all over your skin. I'm very disappointed and want my money back
B008S8U48E|5|I originally purchased this to get rid of scars on my body that I had from scratching my eczema so hard. It was either this, or the expensive Mederma. So I chose this for  the price.<br /><br />I use it after every shower on all my problem areas and and a couple more times throughout the days. Not even 6 months have passed and there is a huge difference already! It leaves me smelling great each time as well. I only suggest being careful how much oil you use. Too much will leave you slippery and in hot weather, oil in general will leave you slippery as well. A little goes a long way, and remember to RUB IT IN and MASSAGE it into your problem areas!<br /><br />Also, I have been in and out of different dermatologists, have been prescribed different pills and creams and have spent too much money on other different thick eczema creams. But this works on itches INSTANTLY! If I have an unbearable eczema itch and I rub some of this on the area, within seconds I feel NO discomfort there anymore! What a surprising relief!
B00N55XA9U|5|I love this product. The hydro gel feels very refreshing and smooth. It fits like a glove. I find that after I use it my skin feels very hydrated.I love this brand biomiracle I hope I see more of it.
B000VPPUEA|5|I was given this product first by a friend from England as she had had lots of success with her stretch marks.  At the time I didn't use it but then I got pregnant and of course those stretch marks started to arrive.  I loved the feel of the oil on my skin and found that it really helped in reducing the itching while my body was stretch into forms I knew not.  I do have stretch marks but I feel the oil kept them down and also helped my skin deal with the pregnancy.  I have also found that when I have a cold it was a great product to dab on my nose and stopped it from drying out.  I love this product and now always have a bottle near by.     UPDATE:  It is 4 months since I gave birth to my son and I have been using Bio-Oil on my stretch marks almost every day.  I have found my stretch marks look a lot better.  I do have one on my side that I always seem to miss and I can see a difference between that one that has not received any Bio-Oil in the sense it is a lot redder than the others.
B00BF98G2Y|5|Wear it everyday along with the primer. Dermalogica is an excellent line.
B000UUF28U|3|I gave it three stars because it doesn't work that well on my hair.  I have very think and long hair, and the straightener doesn't work very well.  I did use it for curling my hair and it worked pretty well.  My cousin now has my Corioliss and it works great for her because she has fine, short hair.
B00GI23X5S|2|All but one were WAY too big. Ended up not being worth the money.
B005PNAOPS|5|Use it the morning before I leave the house.  Works very well.  Great conditioner.
B000UGUEYG|5|HAD FOR OVER YEAR NOW... WORKS GREAT!!  WET OR DRY!  very durable great price and you are sure to love it!
B00VL97E58|5|The first thing I liked about this Shea Butter is that the only ingredient is &#34;Organic Shea Butter&#34;, that's it. Then the amount that comes with the purchase, it's a 16 oz jar filled to the top, a great value!<br /><br />It has a light natural smell, very pleasant. I don't like the heavy perfumes they put in other butters.<br /><br />When I applied it to my skin it left it totally moisturized. The rough, dry areas, like elbows or heels of the feet, were left smooth. It instantly repaired the cracked areas, to my surprise. I like to apply it to my chap lips, it leaves them very soft. This is a great product.
B001KYQCDO|3|not as smooth as the samples of chamomile gold bond I was given. too expensive for what it is
B00127YHYK|1|This was a beautiful french twist hair pick. Unfortunately, it was wrapped in one piece of tissue paper and mailed in an envelope and the end was broken away from the pick part. The cost of return postage was almost as much as the price of the hair pick so I threw this broken item away.
B00126XOI6|5|awesome and very long lasting for cordless
B003OQMO24|5|I am very happy with this purchase. Item was delivered as described and in a timely manner
B00P8CQK90|5|Love this for my carrier oils, its light and blends well.
B006LPQLSS|5|SUPER QUICK DELIVERY!!  No stand, so beware if you are looking for that.  I am 100% pleased! Awesome!!  All of the colors are authentic and so gorgeous!  A Nicki Lover's MUST-HAVE!!
B00CM7YTO2|4|This curling iron heats up fast and works great.  It's survived months of daily use.  The cord is still intact, too, and hasn't work from being moved while curling.  It's already done a better job than the much more expensive iron I purchased previously.  I also love the color!
B00182ERTO|5|I am glad I ordered this product from Gold Bond.  The lotion is very smooth and works well to eliminate dry skin.  Fragrance is very mild too.  Would definitely buy it again.
B005VME166|5|Fabulous condition & shampoos!!  I had used a different brand a few months ago and went back to the Number 4 products.<br /><br />Will purchase again here pretty soon.
B00K374YV6|5|The aloe butter itself is awesome so I gave the product 5 stars...very disappointed in the way it arrived. It was boxed great, had air pillows to protect but when I got to the product the lid was completely off of the jar and laying loose inside of the zip baggie. If it had been warmer weather I would likely have just had a melted goopy mess in a bag! How could so much attention be paid to the box and cushioning and NO ONE noticed the lid was off??? When I screwed the lid back on it fits nice and snug so I doubt it worked it's way all the way off in a couple of days of shipping. I sincerely hope the aloe butter itself didn't get contaminated.
B001MKOKVW|5|The scent is perfect and the tiny jar is lovely. I can see myself collecting more of these to keep at work and home.
B00D2KW68Y|3|I didn't love it. It has a manly smell to it and it did not last all day. The ingredient list is very natural which is a plus, but the gritty texture chafes your skin and irritates it when you apply it.
B000EGIFB6|4|Still evaluating it since i have just started it and do not use it regularly for now. But so far no negative effect.
B005AZX976|5|I renewed my razor with this in about a year. Can't believe the difference. I shaves much closer again.
B00AJFAK92|5|So my daughter being the comedic type that she is says that Tom's of Maine Wicked Cool is wickedly refreshing. I suppose that's a pretty good stamp of approval. When she uses it she laughs and smiles because she feels like a hipster brushing her teeth. What is even cooler is the conversations it's stirred up at the watering hole (school). Apparently she decided to ask her friends about what kind of toothpaste they use. She told them all if they wanted a wickedly refreshing smile that they would need to make the switch to Tom's of Maine Wicked Cool Toothpaste. According to reliable sources at least one kid went home and asked their Mom to buy it for them. Apparently being hip is pretty important nowadays. So if it takes a cool tube and a clever name to get children talking about brushing their teeth than who am I to complain?<br /><br />I received a free sample of Tom's of Maine® Wicked Cool!(tm) Toothpaste from Smiley360.
B007J7M3N4|1|No tingle not hot feels like water not moisturizing at all worse lotion I ever purchased don't waste ur money
B0006Q7IMG|2|The blade was dull when i received  it. It looked as if it was a used blade instead of a new one.
B004DBU95I|4|Love them smell and the hold is great!  Got this at a good price too!  This is as good or better than pricier brands.
B003XDVERE|5|I can't find this in retail stores and it is the best floss I have ever used.  I like the thickness.  It's got some guts and bite.
B00362NDZI|5|Best room spray ever!
B00B1KGVBU|5|Works well with relaxed hair. Not too heavy. Nice smell
B003EA6TAI|5|This is a China Glaze polish so obviously but the polish itself is awesome. Its a really nice neon green. I ordered on the 15th and it was delivered on the 18th. It probably would have come sooner but it was over a weekend. Sovery fast shipping. Over all very happy.<br /><br /> For swatch check my blog at hannahsnails11.blogspot.com or on instagram at @hannahsnails11
B000GP78S6|1|I bought this thinking it would help me tan my face more (I go to a tanning salon) and it did NOTHING but make me redder than I already was getting in my cheeck area. I read the reviews on here FIRST and thought this would be good for me, but NOPE. I am now looking like I dipped my face in red paint. Thanks for wasting my money my Clinique moisturizer is a million x better than this stuff, oh well!!! WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN
B00099Z2OQ|2|I have read many blogs on which people rave about this product, especially for curly hair. I couldn't wait to get to Whole Foods to buy the Direct Leave-In along with Smooth as Silk shampoo and conditioner. Unfortunately, I am quite underwhelmed. I find the Direct Leave-In to be too light for my hair. It also took a while to absorb, so it sat on my hair until my hair dried. Not cool. No one likes to walk around looking like they didn't properly rub the product into their hair. This could be because I used more leave-in than I normally use since this product is not as thick as my usual leave-in. I hope other reviewers have a better experience, but I will not purchase this product again.
B001699TI8|5|I love this stuff because if you rub it into your hands, it doesn't leave your hands feeling greasy.  So you can use your phone or keyboard and not leave gunk behind.
B001UHN0NG|5|I have had numerous straighteners over the years from the original Hot Tools, Sedu, Chi - you name it.  I have extremely curly hair.  Humidity makes my hair frizz, rain drops make my hair curl, etc.  I'm pretty fussy/high-maintenance about my hair and all products that I use on it.  I was currently using the Chi when my friend at work told me about this straightener.  I didn't at all believe her when she said it was better than the Chi.  So I took it home to borrow...  and she was absolutely right.  The Chi straightens pretty good (in comparison) but also leaves your hair feeling kind of dry; the Paul Mitchell straightener leaves your hair silky smooth, straightens AWESOME, and your hair doesn't feel dried out.  Humidity/rain/snow didn't bother my hair too much with the Chi, but I do have to say that the Paul Mitchell straightener is one step above Chi.  If you are trying to decide between this straightener and the Chi....  hands down I'd choose this one. In addition, I do use a mixture of Chi Silk Infusion and Biosilk hair serum....  awesome combo!
B001KYNXKY|5|stores stopped carrying it, thank goodness the amazon vendors still have it. best brown out there. not too dark not too orange. perfect matte look. get lots of complitments when I wear it. stays well for hours.
B004VFXVJW|3|The mirror is the perfect size.  The shipping was great.  The seller is great.  But my mirror always fogs and I dont know why!  Im still happy with my purchase.  I can now shave in the shower rather than over a sink!
B000V3Q0EQ|5|a true feed for the skin.  i have been using it for years.
B00LITWPQE|5|I was pretty upset when Johnson and Johnson discontinued their woven floss with fluoride... but this woven floss is identical (minus the fluoride) and appears to do just as well on my teeth!!!
B00DOT0CSY|4|Good
B007P0ARXS|5|Convenient sized container. Oil has typical smooth feel, but also has subtle smell of rose, which was desired. Not as greasy as baby oil; a good alternative.
B007N4QERY|5|A very good tote bag to have. Very strong bag when you have alot of stuff in the bag. I recommend it to anyone.
B004RR6IO4|5|I have suffered from eczema for years and this is the best lotion I have found to date.  It has a creamy lotion and the best part is that it stops the itching so I don't scratch.  It also absorbs very quickly and is not greasy.
B009T8BF94|4|I bought this wig for an anime convention. It`s my first cosplay, so I was conflicted about wig choices. Once I got it, I was a little displeased with the color, because it had two very sudden changes from white to pink, then pink to red. The style wasn`t entirely like the photo, either, but it`s an easy fix~ Though some edits are needed, it`s a fantastic wig that fits perfectly and feels like real hair!
B00H8Z2LNY|2|Does not do what it says it will do.
B005HR601Y|5|I use this daily on my face, nails, and hair. It does the trick and has become my new favorite beauty product. I think I am a fan for life so please continue to carry this. I live in the Midwest and this winter has been harsh... Many days of below zero. That takes its toll on your skin and hair but this Argan oil is saving me! I couldn't be happier.
B001UTG1U8|5|love it..very natural looking
B00MR05DQ2|3|Item does do its job however this is not a all day lotion. It is just a night cream to put on and take off in 15minutes.
B00GY2J2CU|4|It blends well, great price, but will not be used for daily make up routine; I only bought this to add to my travel collection. But considering the price it's a good quality.
B000U2AQNY|5|Nourish and shine helps keep my hair moisturized in winter and a little goes a long way. The price I paid here was better than what I'd seen stores.
B000GCTDAK|5|I needed to ship shampoo to a man, and I thought this was great for its packaging.  I felt much more comfortable of it not spilling during shipment.
B000KOWJ8C|1|The color didn't hold as before.  Both application bottles were defective. Not happy will not use again. Wish I had my money back'
B00HUK5ZXU|1|I ordered a sample (pay for shipping only) bottle of this, and it very well may work, but I can't really say since it pilled up and rolled off my face when I tried to put my makeup on afterward. I had to wash my face and start over letting it sit on my face for 5 minutes before applying makeup, and had the same result. Makes a mess and you have to wash it off anyway. Maybe if you wear no makeup you might like this.
B00NGIZLHU|4|Great quality. Haven't worn for long, but seems like it will hold up for a long while. Great price. Shipping is very long so order with plenty of time.
B00IC4TUCK|1|I have used this product since the day that I received it. Nothing is true, I haven't been able to remove a single hair! Someone has to tells me how it is used or this product. As of today it is a total fraud.
B004Q1GCFG|5|Theses brushes are awesome, I never knew what I was missing out using the standard sponge brush. Using these brushes add so much more dimension to your shadows and makes even drugstore makeup look good, I highly recommend theses brushes to all.
B00EI3JUNS|5|Amazingly easy to apply, love it.
B000FTLI8E|5|This revived a razor that I thought would have to be thrown away.  It now works like it is new.
B000PKWAWQ|5|My dermatolist recommended this product over 10 years ago.  I know how dermalogiats and skin care technicians, love to hype the newest stuff, so they are probably now hyping some other product that is 5 times this price. I say if it isn't broke, why should I fix it?  ;-)<br /><br />I have tried most of them and have always come back to Dermalogica either Intensive Skin moisturizer or their lighter product, Active Moist or Skin Smoothing cream (medium).<br /><br />I use the intensive moisture balance mainly in th winter when my skin is most dry.  I like all their products, as none of them are pore clogging or feel greasy on your face.<br />Just be sure you buy from a reputable seller as there are fakes out there.
B00FA6P8GU|1|it burnt the skin arownd the dark spots...i had to use anti buning gel and still dark spot are the same
B003V265QW|1|Included glove does NOT sufficiently protect your hand from the heat. Ouch.
B001ECQ516|5|I have tried a few over the counter but prescription strength anti-perspirants but this one by far seems to work the best. It seems to prevent the extra sweating that I experience.
B001397BJU|5|This worked amazingly well to clean my flat iron! All the gunk that was built up came right off after letting the product sit on the straightener for about a minute. Made the iron look just like new!
B00T417IFQ|5|I have used many eyelash curlers, expensive ones, cheap ones, until I found this one. I truly think that this IS the greatest eyelash curler there is, period!! You'll never have to buy another one ever again, because this one will last you a long time + it comes with 5 replacement pads, what other curler comes with 5 replacement pads?? - none that I've seen, that's for sure!!<br />I highly recommend this product to anyone, great product + great price + fast delivery = happiness!!!
B004GNSLZI|5|this product arrived promptly and excellently packaged. All items we in great shape... it was identical to the description and the colors were exact! she LOVES it
B008TC2Y7S|4|Cuts well. Seem well made. Comes in a nice protective case. Gave it 4 stars because finger holes are small. They fit me fine, but I am a petite woman. My husband could not get his thick man fingers in them! I cut his hair, though, so it's ok.
B005I4C4ZW|5|I love it. Its non flaky and very light.
B003U8ESI4|1|Bad Bad Bad Bad!! don't ever buy it!! i throw it in the Trash!<br />1st :Uneven trim !!!<br />2nd  Noisy!!!  i bought a 15$ trimmer and its not noisy! this one is 50$<br />3rd : the led screen show wrong length!!<br />4th : the battery not as advertised!<br />5th : its not water resistent
B007636W9M|5|This is my favorite body spray.  Smells clean.  My sister in law introduced me to this product.  She works closely with the public and enjoyed the clean smell.  She is a smoker, so when after she washed her hands she carried a small bottle in her pocket.  Loved the way she smelled so I brought some for myself.  Wouldn't be without it.
B002XHACTM|4|I love the color combination
B0092ULVJS|5|I had these years ago. I need just a little volume on top, so I still tease my hair, and these really hold the tease.
B00KJWRIAO|3|Not as sturdy as it should be.
B0012K3RFM|4|The product is very gentle and without any smell. And it didn't cause any uncomfortable. But it just soften my cuticle ....not remove it.
B0046HJM1Q|5|As stated, this brush was intended for my fiances beard, after receiving it found that it was of much better quality than other brushes on the market anywhere.  It has nice firm bristles, of which we have not had loss in either brush.  The handle is made from real bamboo, being sustainable and much better feeling than composite or plastic handles available at stores that simply do not meet the overall quality of this brush, highly recommended.
B004B3B560|5|I bought this for my friend and I like the smell of it, very soft! Best part, it does not smell anything like grandpa cologne!
B001E723RG|4|Best for me.
B008ACAYR4|4|I own several items from the Goody Simple Styles collection, and I like them in varying degrees.  The Spin Pins (and minis) are the favorites with reason.  This one isn't bad, though; it's just not nearly as amazing or versatile.<br /><br />What's weird about this to me is that it's not a completely symmetrical shape; yet, I can't really decide if it's meant to work most easily to the left or right.<br /><br />My hair is on the thick side of average thickness.  It's a wavy, unruly mop at times as well.  And, all that seems to mean that my hair is a bit too thick for this item.  It works well for me for half ponies and half-up/half-down 'dos.  However, the featured side pony is all but impossible to accomplish.  I think it would work snazzily for thinner (or straighter) hair, though.<br /><br />For thicker hair, I would recommend the Goody Simple Styles Modern Updo Maker  [[ASIN:B008IRTHH4 Goody Simple Styles Modern Updo Maker 1 Pack Dark Hair Color]] instead.  (I have been told the updo maker doesn't hold well in thinner hair, btw).  My Updo maker is more secure and can accomplish basically all of the styles featured on this box.
B00359HZEC|5|I absolutely love this fragrance. The only negative thing about it is that It doesn't last very long, which is kinda annoying.
B0007MW2ZW|5|OMG. I shaved off my beard just so I could luxuriate in the smell of this shaving cream. I've become a huge fan of Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood products.
B00EYGFFBU|5|I absolutely love it! My skin feels soft and firm. Plus they threw in a sugar scrub and black head disolver for free!
B00GONVEA2|1|👎👎👎
B001ET76FI|5|Then you are bound to put wear and tear on your tootsies. There are many good formula foot care products; one which has proven to help in mild or extreme conditions is Zim's Crack Cr&egrave;me. Although good for other external skin locations this is where I found it to be most useful. This cream also works on more modest feet.<br /><br />Even thought it says natural ingredients as with any topical item you may want to try it in a small area first to be sure you do not have an unwanted reaction.
B00MVJOHVQ|3|I was expecting more of a peach color whereas it looks orange gold...too orangy for me.
B00GMUGB1E|5|I'm in tanning heaven. I have a big problem with my legs getting dark like the rest of my body. And this does it. So satisfied I will definitely be buying another bottle. And it smells amazing it's more amazing than the other lotions I've tried.
B0014P8L9W|5|This stuff makes my skin feel wonderful and helps clear out my pores.  Be sure you mix the clay with apple cider vinegar instead of water to prevent clumping.  It will leave your skin really red but it goes away after about 1 hour or less.
B00N1PW0NG|5|love it
B005KQ6L2U|1|There is absolutely no honey scent whatsoever.  This was pretty costly to not use, if I could return it, I certainly would. I even tried mixing but nothing will help this.
B00GQ0GD4A|5|Best nail clipper ever.  I am giving them as stocking stuffers for all my relatives and friends this year.
B0002JMSQI|5|great long lasting scent
B00IIXGNYI|3|I was not overly impressed by this product.
B001MA0QY2|5|Great product and I love the fact that it is dual voltage as I live overseas and travel back to the States regularly.  It shipped quickly and reached me in Australia in a little over a week.
B001SGEWOK|5|After more than 50 years and thousands of dollars, I found this product.  It covers all the imperfections and provides a smooth look without a heavy, greasy, pore-clodding feeling.  I don't even have to use concealer with this product.  It has shortened my \\"make-up\\" time by at least half.  My only worry is that L'Oreal will stop producing it.
B0007W1R58|5|good
B00A6H2DD4|5|This is a Great Product. Great Service. Quick shipping! Works really well. It's so gross how well it works and I love it! HaHa
B0026IBSVE|5|Very nice product for the money.  I bought this for my son and he has been more than pleased with it.
B00LO2D89S|4|Shipped quickly. It's looks great , except there's an extra chain going half way around, which you can actually see on the photo.
B002ZJWDBI|5|No more sunscreen in your eyes!  Easy to apply, great coverage, no more red cheeks and nose and kids can apply themselves.
B0001HAEQM|5|I have been using Renewed Balance for the last 2 years, and I couldn't feel happier and more confident about a product, as I am about this one.  It totally changed my life.  I was starting to enter a dark stage in my life, I was constantly moody and just plain unhappy with myself.  I was also dealing with adult acne at the time.  I was referred to this medicine by a sister of mine, she said it might help with my mood swings and clear my acne along the way.  Well, I'd like to share that my skin is cleared up, I only get minor acne once in a while.  But my mood is what Im happiest about.  I have found Joy in life, I feel happy 85% of the time.  I have the patience I always had before.  I'm back to being myself again.  I wouldn't trade this product for anything in the world. I recommend it to all my friends and speak of it's greatness.  So happy I found my happiness in a jar, at the perfect time.
B008D6YPD6|5|Same scent as I've always remembered it to be. No cap to the bottle, but I'll use it all before that becomes an issue. Wonderful!
B00008K4UA|5|This is my first and I love it.  I will admit that the reviews before about the pain were right.  I have come up with a tip though:  the instructions state to use the epilator after a shower when the pores are more open:  Well, I decided that using a heating pad on the area should work pretty good.  IT DID!  On the areas I don't use the heat pad I can't stand to use the epilator, but on the areas of the heat pad, what a difference.  I can tolerate it.  I was tempted to put the epilator away and never use it again because it did hurt so much.  But not anymore.  Give it a try.
B001EWEP4A|5|I love this cream. I used to buy it in bulk and finally ran out after years. I was disappointed that my old favorite cream had been reformulated but it turns out, this new formulation is even better. Has all the good qualities of the original but is not so heavy. This is great for dry winter skin... it really moisturizes the heavy dryness and soothes all those dry skin cracks. The best part is that it's natural... no perfumes or dyes. My husband and I used to fight over it until we got smart and got one for each of us!
B002P9IP3S|5|Very solid razor.  Don't be afraid to try a slant razor...this is the best shave I've had in years.
B004VMGTVW|5|I like this product.  Works good for dry skin, not greasy like some other products.  Scent of  lotion is okay.
B00686KJJW|1|I love the product but I was told it would take 3 days to ship and it took a week.
B005A11VFM|3|you have to shake it for approx. 4 min in order to get to color its suppose to be.
B001PLYV5I|5|Work great!
B000ODO5FO|5|Wow. Press on nails have come a long way since the eighties. These are so easy to use and look almost as good as a salon. They are very thin towards the cuticle part of your real nail making them look very natural. They are very flexible too so its easy to match the size to your real nail. These are great. Will use them anytime I want a quick nice looking french manicure.
B00HFQQ0VU|3|The switch to on the handle to turn the water on and off is one big pain to turn on and off - oftentimes it takes two hands.  The unit is very loud so if your bathroom is off your master bedroom don't think using this if your spouse is sleeping.
B00BOJTZVG|4|Delightful scent, but fades too quickly.
B000GDDKL2|5|I love this eye cream! I got the Murad Environmental Shield Essential-C Eye Cream to use under and around my eyes in the daytime, mainly because I like the idea of using an eye cream with SPF in it. It seems like thats the best way to really combat fine lines and aging (by using sunscreen to prevent those things.) I like that this product has Vitamin C in it as well.  It blends nicely into my skin, and absorbs very quickly. It leaves absolutely no white-cast. Makeup goes over it really well too! Some eye creams can sting a ton if you accidentally get them in your eye, but the couple of times I have gotten this in my eye, it just barely stings for a minute or two, and then I am fine. Early on when I had this eye cream, I dropped it, and the top broke. So that kind of stunk, but otherwise I love this eye cream, and highly recommend it to anyone!
B00CLID3WG|5|Works great for frizzy, thick hair.  I really like this one.
B00DVMHAUW|5|We have been using this product for years.  It is moisturizing without leaving a film on your skin.  Great for sensitive or troubled skn.
B001KYQM1Q|1|This looks like the same color on for a little bit-- then when it's almost gone it goes to a funny orange.  I'm thinking its a knock- off or something.  I still had a small amt. left of an original and it sure didn't do what this lipstick did.  My husband asked-- what do you have on your lips-- he rarely notices a thing...
B004X2XC3I|4|It's not bad but it's not great. I don't really getting extreme complements off of it. I like it though. And I think it smells nice on me. I am a person that has about 30 different colognes and I would have to say this is probably one of my favorites.
B000AA5VD6|5|I have been using this product ever since it came on the market years ago.  I have always done my own nails & this truly does dry in 30 seconds.  I highly recommend!
B004014R7M|4|Okay first off let me tell you I did a stupid mistake by bleaching my own hair like 2 months ago!! Fried my ahir and my poor scalp :( I bought this shampoo with low hopes honestly. But to my surprise I love it and I dont have to use much of it.. I have long hair. Idk if its just this that is working but I also use Rusk leave in conditioner and the pair is doing just great!!!
B00021A7UU|5|I LOVE this Cream Eyeliner from Smashbox!!! I haven't found anything close to it!!! I have even introduced my friends to this stuff.  They love it as well.  It goes on so creamy and I have not problem with it lasting all day, into the night and I can even see traces of it in the mornings!!!  You MUSAT try this fabulous eyeliner.
B002JPJ2ZS|1|I have been taking this product for two months now and have not seen any hair growth. I will continue to take it for another month or so to see if that makes a difference.
B008U12YV4|4|i am going to use it for my purse to keep things organized and for the price, it is fine...
B004Q1WT58|5|Great sunscreen. It's not greasy or stinky, and protects my lily-white skin from igniting in the Caribbean sun. The only drawback is that it rinses off easily if you get it wet, which is great for washing it off, but not so much if you're at the beach or pool. Just remember to reapply often, which you should probably be doing anyway if you're as white as Casper, like I am.
B000BOZCBC|1|I did not receive the After Shave Balm....Pre-shave Oil was received (I did not want to go to the trouble to send back).
B000G647Y8|4|I've been wet shaving since 2009 and I've always wanted a badger brush (only used a Vander Hagen boar) but they are really expensive.<br /><br />Bought this one for about $12 and it's been pretty nice so far. No complaints. Good brush.
B001E4KA6U|5|Excelent! Thank you very much! I will keep to buy it often!!
B0019NA0S4|5|awesome product
B008BWIQM8|1|I received an old mist. Since there is no expiration date on the bottle, I can be sure that the product is not fresh.
B00F14XI6I|5|My daughter really loved it. Received it really quick. Can get a bit tangled with your hair, so be careful.
B005FYJBME|5|Really like this shade of color!
B005Z49L7O|4|If you are looking for a traditional conditioner this is not your pick.  But for an organic product this works pretty well.
B001ARV4MU|5|Best brush I've bought in a long time
B001DL1G8K|1|It may work for you but didn't work for me.  I have used standard deodorants forever and in my case they can cause irritation after a few days of use and I would have to take a few days off. So I gave this a try.  It did nothing to protect me from the dreaded stank at the end of the day.  Other standard deodorants had worked fine for me and they passed the significant-other test (my girlfriend says I don't stink and trust me she would tell me if I did).  After one day of using this, she was very clear this was not working. I tried it a few more days and it did not get better. I wanted this to work, but I can't recommend it as it did nothing for me.<br /><br />I did not experience the \\"bad smell\\" that the other reviewer mentioned.
B000Y4357C|5|I brought it for me it has a very clean and fresh scent to it. Not overbearing like most male fragrances.
B00LC8QSPK|5|good soap
B00CO5UY6E|4|Love the applicator bottle this comes in, love the use of natural/organic ingredients, not a huge fan of the smell of the product...maybe thatz why i didnt give 5 stars and only 4. A product has to really impress me for that. No other complaints, however.
B001EWEP3Q|5|Great buy great product
B00NQ7UOP0|5|Worked perfectly! First time doing my own gel nails but it cured them perfectly and without the hefty price tag of the other lamps out there. I got the teal color as well and it's beautiful! Used it on Gelaze and FingerPaints gel polish so far and ORLY base and top coats.
B001FB5TPE|5|THIS IS THE ORIGINAL LEVER 2000 , THE NEW STUFF IN THE STORES IS WEAKER & REALLY NOT GOOD, WE LOVE THE ORIGINAL & THE ORIGINAL PURE RAIN, WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER THIS AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT, PLEASE LEVER 2000 QUIT CHANGING IT!!!!
B004TBJM9Q|5|Great product!
B00LWEYMXY|5|Loved this stuff - so sorry to see they stopped carrying this product.
B00MOJXCFU|5|Great
B00K0DWFYG|5|I LOVE these cases! They fit perfectly and they don't stick to your phone, making the phone look like it's stuck to the inside of the case! Buy them all! They're awesome!
B000Q6SU3C|5|Over the years I have tried numerous electric shavers and was always disappointed that they didn't come close to shaving with a wet razor. This Braun Pulsonic razor is the first that shaves almost as closely as a wet razor. It is comfortable in your hand, not as loud as some other razors, and you can lock the moving head to get into places like under your nose. I was a little sceptical of the cleaning accessory but that actually seems to work really well too. Overall, I am very happy with this razor.
B00AG92BXY|3|My razor handle needs to be pressed in because it's too small but i bought their brush and that just slides in, other then that great product.
B000XB5QGO|5|No wonder the bottles are expired.<br />L'Oreal pulled this item so no new stock would be available. The products are leftovers from at least two years ago being sold a discount price on Amazon.  Expired bottles are all that's left probably.<br /><br />It has been replaced at least in name with Youth Code Skin Genesis.  There are two formulas. One that is a replacement for this old favorite. And another formula that supposedly clears discolorations and spots.<br /><br />I'll try the new product and review it separately as Youth Code etc.
B000P20R1U|5|I use this fragrance every day.Scent is true to gardenia. One spray of this scent will give you the hint of the fragrance without being overpowering. Lasts all day.
B000VHH6TK|1|I had high hopes for this leave in. I color my hair and often use a flat iron so my hair is dry. I had hoped this product would repair some of the damage but it did not.  It actually made it worse.
B006GQYSGE|5|I've had my AT830 for about 6 weeks now. I was a Braun user for years, then for the past 5 years or so, a DE shaver with badger brush and shaving soap. The AT830 is giving me the best shaves I've ever had (started shaving in 1962).<br /><br />Technique is key with a Norelco: I picked up some really good tips from [...]<br /><br />1. Start with a freshly-washed face. But wait 10-15 minutes to allow for drydown.<br />2. Use a circular motion with this rotary shaver.<br />3. Use a very light touch.<br />4. Due to the Lift & Cut technology, your face will feel smoother a half hour after your shave. It takes that long for the whiskers that were lifted up to settle down.<br /><br />I clean my shaver after each use: just open it up and rinse with hot water from the tap.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B007YQURGU|3|It does not seem to go on evenly.  It also started to peel in less than two weeks.  The light should be a little bigger so that my entire hand can go under the light, the light is so small that my thumb does not fit in.
B000YL7V8O|5|Excellent  product overall.  very useful for cleaning the bathtub. without bending over.<br />Also useful in the shower.to wash your back.
B008LDFU26|5|Product works well for me. I'm a satisfied customer. Age spots much fainter and skin tone excellent. Very happy with Nerium.
B003A722RE|4|It has nice balance, but I often use the hand towell to open and close.
B007I01ABI|4|This is a very light scent...perfect for day
B00BT5HROC|3|It should have been clear that most of them were the same! I wasn't very satisfied with the product when i received it.
B00CHKKWV8|1|Not satisfied with this purchase  Would not purchase again
B0040TU5RU|5|I have used this product for a long time now, the only foundation I will use.  Never has given my skin any problems (acne). I'm a dental hygienist so wear a mask with this stuff too. Only a small amount will rub off, not a lot. Just recently I developed some kind of eczema or rosacia. I've used this product to hide the redness and it works beautifully! Some color still comes through, but it just looks like blush or a natural pink hue to my cheeks vs the other. Sometimes (since I have dry skin too), it can look powdery-but only up very very close. Like I dusted my cheeks with a powder compact. All in all, I just love this product and won't use anything else. It makes my skin look soft, creamy and healthy. Product can last a long time. A little goes a long way.
B00005JS5C|4|I purchased this in January 2011 and it worked until the summer of 2012 with 1 - 2x a month usage. I am considering buying it again because I can't seem to find anything else like it. I may opt for the Always Bikini Perfect since it can be used in the shower (even though it doesn't have as favorable reviews). I used it without the cover the whole time and you have to be careful. I wish it were a little narrower, like the ones sold in the drugstore (I think Venus has one -- but this one does not last more than a month). So overall I would recommend this trimmer but I wish it lasted a little longer than a year and a half.
B00H997Z8A|5|good
B000VKZMHK|5|Over the years, I have tried multiple electric razors from norelco and Braun but I always found myself going back to my gillette razors.....until now.  I've had the razor for a couple weeks and been very happy with the performance of this razor ... Especially when using it in the shower.  While the performance falls off a little when dry shaving... It's still a good shave.  Most tellingly, i have not used my fusion razor in two weeks....<br /><br />Unlike some of the reviews, i don't find the razor too noisy at all.  Also the charging and cleaning base is simple to use and works very well.  I highly recommend this razor
B00MCNQOEO|5|I originally used this soap for a rash that I had, but it is also great for my skin, especially in the colder months.
B00680WS24|5|Excelente
B000RLG8JE|5|excellent1
B0086VI9TE|1|Bad product. I would recommend to pay more and get real brush heads from Bed Bath & Beyond or some other store. These seem to me to be fake. Do not waste your money
B00KBIFO7A|4|This brush is super soft, but its not as dense as i thought it would be.  That's OK though, it really applies  my L'Oreal Lumi foundation flawlessly and doesn't &#34;eat up&#34; a lot of the product.
B00OS969KO|4|It's decent cotton,it does feel different then regular organic cotton,it is easy to works with and a little does go a long way,its texture is almost like Japanese pads but has a cotton ball feel,I'm not a fan of Japanese pads cause I feel that it can't keep up with my chain vape and there's always some juice left in Japanese wicking that I can not vape that has a dry hit even tho I see juice in the wick,but this cotton bacon always Vapes to the last drop of juice which I like,I purchase this just because there's is no boiling or any other special needs like cotton balls and u can tell that it was made for vapers when u pinch a piece off cause nothing compares to this at all,I gave this cotton a ratings of 4 just because there is a cotton taste to it at the beginning of a new build but goes away after about 10 hits,but does not taste weird at all,it taste organic,but I guess it subjective
B008DWDW8Y|5|great stuff...
B00016XJ4M|5|I have fairly dry/sensitive skin, so I was looking for a rosewater toner when I clicked on this. Decided to take a chance and order it - so glad I did. I use this every day, just after cleansing and before moisturizing. This toner smells fantastic - and the best part is that it's alcohol free, so it won't dry out your skin. I bought this over a month and a half ago, share it with someone else, and still have a quarter bottle left - so if you use it, on average, once a day, it should last you around four months.<br /><br />Since I've started using this, my skin has gotten a lot less dry/red - would highly recommend!
B00V98CB0Y|5|muy buen perfume
B007N3F1YM|5|I love how it makes my curls pop right in and gives it a beautiful shine.
B003Z4UKGM|5|I can not say enough great things about this face wash. Perfect for sensitive and prone skin and it removes all makeup with just a dime size amount. Been using for about 3 years and I will never switch to anything else
B003G94DJQ|5|I bought this product when I was visiting my brother in Pennsylvania I could only get a 3 oz. tube for the plane. I could not fine anyplace to buy it here. I was so happy to see Amazon had it as an add on. I bought four large tubes it makes your skin so silky and soft I just love it. I hope in the future they carry the product all the time.  Barbara
B000G647Y8|3|I ordered the Tweezerman Men's Shaving Brush for my husband's birthday, April 2012.  (His first shaving brush.) To make a nice gift I ordered the Omega 172 Chrome Shaving Brush Stand to ensure the shaving brush would dry properly after each use and last a long time.  My husband shaves about once a week, and had no problems until about 2 months worth of use.  The brush sits (in the stand) on the bathroom counter, and while cleaning, I lightly bumped it and the \\"ball\\" of dry bristles fell out of the wooden stand.  The ball of bristles were attached to the stand using some kind of wax.  Anyway my husband used krazy glue to reattach it, and got maybe 2 more uses and it the bristles fell out again.  Each time the brush is used, my husband takes care to thourghly rise the it and place it back in the brush stand to dry.  The ball of bristles were glued with a bit more krazy glue a second time, and thankfully it has not fallen out since.<br /><br />I thought the $12.09 I paid for this brush was a really good deal, and based on all the excellent reviews, I did not expect this sort of thing to happen.  There are however several reviewers stating the bristles fell out, as well as other complaints.  All in all, I would NOT recommend this brush.  I suggest spending a little more money on a better badger brush and not have the hassle of reattaching the bristles to the stand.  OR if you do buy this brush, don't expect it to last forever!
B00DPLIF3K|4|Everything as I expected . The wait is the hardest.
B004ZH5MTS|4|I received my brush set a few days ago. Although I have only used it a few times, I'm happy with the product. The brushes are really soft and seem somewhat durable. They are long enough to easily hold and do a great job at applying the makeup. I bought this because I just recently built my own Hollywood style Vanity. My colors are black and hot pink, it matched perfectly!
B00A99XF0Y|5|My wife likes the way this moisturizing hand soap treats her hands and myself I like the way it acts as a hand soap with such a small amount that I can use with the handy Simple Human Liquid Hand Soap Dispenser. Of the different varieties of liquid hand soap offered by Simple Human the moisturizing liquid hand soap is our favorite.
B004TSFE28|4|I'm just a beginner with doing fancy eyeshadow stuff (meaning using more than one color) and I LOVE this set! The brushes are super soft, easy to hold, and the bristles DON'T fall out, which is great because a lot of drugstore  brushes have bristles that fall out. These are sleek, high quality brushes with a low price. The only downside for me is that the crease brush is a tad too big I think. DEFINITELY get this brush set!
B0049CYN3A|5|This is a great product. .
B004KRVENQ|1|it looks like used and very cheap material, very disappointed.
B003ATS2QC|2|This stays in the bathroom but is not water proof.<br />Water fell on it and it doesnt work anymore :(
B008JHQ8HU|3|I don't like the smell, it doesn't come out evenly, it's almost like watery. And is just sticky.. I've been trying to find a nice hold hair spray that smells good, but this isn't it. Then I tried the Aussie, I love the smell, it did not hold, then I got the Aussie freeze, whoa!! Your hair will not go any where with that stuff lol.. I would only use that stuff if my hair is up, but when my hair is down and lightly spray, it's just to sticky, hard crunchie hair :( I guess I'm still on the look out for a great smelling hair spray that will hold, but not give me helmet hair lol..
B0006PJS3O|3|I really like it, I usually use Salt Scrubs. Oh, this sugar stuff is much better. If you ever used salt scrubs then you know how they can burn if you have any nicks or cut on your hand, body, etc. Sometimes I'll forget and shave my legs, well then I can't use the scrub. With the sugar scrub you can use it whenever. I like that. The product itself is okay. I would like it if the oils were a little thicker, for lack of a better word. Overall it's okay.
B002PISJE4|5|I have only used this 2 nights so I will have to do a follow up review, however I am very impressed with the results so far! I am 29 so at this point I'm dealing with acne, oiliness, fine lines, and a few brown spots/freckles. I don't have bad acne, but over the last year I have gotten a lot of bumps on my face, it seems like almost all my pores are clogged with a blackhead, and excessive oiliness. I have had extremely persistent clogged spots that last for months.  I used finacea for a while, which was good but my insurance stopped covering it so my skin was looking icky again.<br /><br />The instant I put this on my face I noticed it was much smoother. The following morning my skin looked good! Which was surprising because other than using that I didn't get much rest and wasn't exactly set up to look great upon waking up! My makeup went on so smoothly, it was almost too easy!<br /><br />The second morning almost all my pores are unclogged! The stuff clogging my skin is just coming out effortlessly! It's amazing because I've been trying to achieve this for months. Since I couldnt get finacea, I was prescribed metronidazole, which I think might have worsened my problem.<br /><br />In addition to unclogging all my pores, I have this one spot that is particularly dark from tanning when I was younger that is already less noticable and the lines that are starting to form between my eyebrows, around my mouth, on my forehead, and under my eyes. Everything is looking better already, so incredibly quick! And there are no side effects either! Even my fingertips that I use to apply it feel silky!<br /><br />I was at tj maxx and noticed this product. I don't use strivectin products, but I was into an antioxidant product of theirs a few years back that I found at tj maxx that was good. This caught my eye so I looked up reviews while I was contemplating purchasing it and they seemed good. It was only 20 bucks!!!!!! What an amazing price. I plan on going back to get 1 or maybe even 2 more because that is just fantastic.<br /><br />This is something that I will recommend to my friends and family. Maybe I will buy them out of if and give it as gifts as well!
B001KYS87M|5|Love the soft scent of lavender. Everything I expected,.I have received complements and requests for the name of the product.
B00GF1NZLY|5|Fast service and I LOVE the oil!
B00L2SWF7K|5|Ok Ladies... I have waited until the dead of winter to write my review because I KNOW how my skin reacts to the cold and the multiple steps I have had to resort to in past years to deal with the DRY, flaky facial skin.  I am very pleased to share that this moisturizer is the best I have ever used and I have purchased many different expensive brands in my day. This winter I have not had to go to Plan B or Plan C to either keep my skin soft or to address the flakiness.  My skin has remained hydrated throughout the cold winter months this year.<br />There is something great going on with the texture and tone of my face since I began using 3 of the OZ Natural products.  Using the Vit C serum , the HA serum and this moisturizer is providing visible results.<br />In fact, I was faithfully using my Stem Light and my Facial Muscle Massager and decided to stop using them as an experiment and surprisingly my face has only fallen a tad.  Before using these 3 products if I stopped my facial exercises I saw big time sagging within a week.  So something GOOD is coming out of using these products.<br />I am happy and very satisfied.  Want to try the Toner soon as I have one deep age spot that the Vit C has lightened but has not taken away and I am wondering if the Toner with GA in it would bring more fading.<br />Hope this comment is helpful.<br />Regards --
B005GQ6L0G|1|These are absolutely not rubberized. They slip through my wavy, long, medium thick hair and are not at all like the other Croc clips I've used. They look like cheap knockoffs and I'm sending them back immediately. These may be fine if you have low expectations but are severely disappointing if you believe this seller's FALSE ADVERTISING or have used Croc clips in the past.
B0050HO9MI|3|I was disappointed in the finish and quality of this razor when it arrived.  It is literally &#34;rough around the edges&#34; with uneven metal around the shaving head.  The blades that came with it were awful. With a good blade, it shave acceptably, but I much prefer my other razors.  I will probably put this razor in the camper for when I am away and don't need a really close shave.
B00EHQPXMI|5|My new \\"every day\\" styler for my wash and go. The curl definition is somewhere between Kinky-Curly Curling Custard and Design Essentials Curl Forming Custard.
B0029RCC9E|4|This is the second tube of this mascara I have used and I am happy with it. I have long, but thin lashes, so I want to accentuate them without having them look too clumpy. This mascara does the trick. The blue is not navy, but a bit brighter, which I like for daytime wear.
B00005NASR|5|I love this lotion.  It is all I have used for decades now.  It is gluten free, keeps my skin from being dry and itchy, plus smells wonderful.
B001T8M9WY|5|Easy brush to use! It does not pull or rip my hair and I have 3 feet of hair! Great with blow dryer my hair. I did have to get styling blow dryer but it was definitely well worth the buy!
B00F2RAYQ6|5|The tiara was beautiful. I found no stones missing. the tiara fit great. My niece loved this. Made her frozen costume complete.
B00I8WH8CK|1|This device is so weak and pathetic I'm not even sure what to do with it.
B008Z74UP6|1|It was suppose to be matted finish, not only was it not. But it was watery as if it the original nail polish was watered down with water.
B007M819DU|5|My favorite face lotion
B003LR6T86|3|Didn't clear my acne. Guess this wasn't designed for my skin. Us reptilians need to find a more thicker cream.
B001COG778|5|Bought this after my dentist wanted to charge me 600 dollars to do EXACTLY the same thing this product does. I've been using this a week now and it's simply amazing!  My teeth are already much whiter. The trays are very high quality and fit perfectly. Be careful with the gel as using too much really can burn the gums. Highly recommended!
B0081X4XEM|5|Great belt!  I'm curvy and it fits perfect!
B001OXZT3K|5|I've only just started using this product, but so far I really enjoy it. I've tried everything on the market so to find something I like and works is a major plus! Fast shipping and great service!
B000XTCFME|5|Fresh, clean fragrance.  Even though there's no cure for the hair loss I'm experiencing, I know I'm treating what's left with the utmost care by using this product.
B00HTIT3AY|4|I purchased this sunscreen because I have a well. The iron in our well water reacts with the avobenzone in most sunscreens and leaves horrid orange stains on our clothes after they are washed. Nothing like a brand new summer white shirt going into the laundry stainless and coming out orange! This did not stain, so I am very happy with it. It is rather difficult to apply. It I doesn't go on smooth like a lotion. It's difficult to rub in and you look a bit pale before it gets absorbed.
B00EL1HZ34|5|Happy with my oder love it
B00Q3FL712|5|Great product! See my review for the Revita Growth Stimulating shampoo 6oz & conditioner 6oz duo set. I only use Revita when I can use this product too. Although you can use this product alone or just use the shamp/conditioner alone as well too, it just isnt the same. The products are created to work well together. It is expensive yes, but it does work. DOnt be alarmed if you hair starts to shedd in the first two weeks. Its very normal! your fragile hair falls out as the product revitalizes your hair follicle. It allows for a healthier and fuller strand of hair to develop in the follicle. At first I freaked out, but then found that my hair became fuller. So i looked at the Q&A and that was one thing they mentioned and said not to worry. and they were right.
B00KV0LL5C|5|Got Spirits? Stuff that wouldn't stay buried? Chilly breezes in the house? Spirits can be such jerks..<br />Encourage the energies to get lost.<br /><br />Temporary relief with a spritz.! Man these beggars hate this stuff.
B002N5MHLU|5|I've used a rotary 3-head shaver for years and finally decided to try this standard shaver.  I've been using it for a month now and taken it on severl long business trips. So far it has worked well and I'm happy with the purchase.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone interested.  I love how easy it is to clean.
B000H0SCCG|4|I like this a lot but it is really messy. It smells amazing and its not heavy at all. I would recommend it and buy it again.
B000VOJ9BG|1|The perfume came in a box that was very wet and saturated with that perfume; the bottle was about 2/3 full, and when I wrote the seller asking how to exchange the perfume for a complete bottle, the seller didn't even respond to me.
B005IC2MTW|5|I cannot believe what a difference this balm has made for me. I've tried everything, have found this to be so much better than beeswax products. I have very dry, sensitive skin, this has been a life saver!
B00WKQAZ3O|5|Bought this for my wife. I don't think I've ever seen her miss a day where she doesn't wash her face. It's truly amazing her dedication to her skin. Anyways, I definitely scored some brownie points with the wife on this.
B0002KU6GG|1|Doesn't work, flakes off bits of purple everywhere, can't stand up against my calluses. this is not what they use when you get a professional pedicure.
B00IK8E6CC|5|These masks are awesome! I had never heard of the brand previously but I saw the good reviews and decided to buy. The masks are very very thin, cotton material that can easily rip on a fingernail. Because they are so thin they absorb really well into the skin. I use the essence left in the pack for days afterward and my skin is plump and more hydrated. My skin is oily/combo/acne-prone so the light hydration this mask provides works really well for me. I think this would not quite be hydrating enough for folks with dry skin though.
B0009XAHTM|5|Perfect curl without kinks.  Gave my hair the body it needed to be thick and manageable.  Easy application and beautiful hair in a short time.  Lasts for three months plus.
B00FNAR62W|5|Very good, ordered again
B00DEO27QE|5|Nice pleasant smell. Keeps my nails hydrated while adding a little shine. Happy with the ingredients which also helps protect my nails.<br />Also its not greasy which is a plus.<br />Nice buy.
B00CNTJHQO|5|This shampoo really took me by surprise! I am so sensitive to sulfates and fragrance and my scalp has no shame in reacting. My scalp loves the natural ingredients and I didn't have an itch for 2 days! Unbelievable! The scent is really good too. I thought it would be gross, but it's actually pretty peaceful. Smelled fresh and my husband totally agrees! He tried it and loves it, too! While in the shower, I followed the directions and left it on for 3mins, while I bathed and shaved my legs. As I washed it out, my hair felt really weird...is dry the right word? IDK. I was worried. I continued to use another natural conditioner, on my ends only. My hair when I rinsed was fine after. I again, followed directions and left my hair to dry for about 5-10mins. After blow drying, my hair was so soft! It smelled good and like I said before, there were no reactions!! Hallelujah!! Is it a little pricey? Yes, but how much freakin money do we spend trying to find a product that will leave our scalp healthy, smell good, and leave our hair in excellent condition?! I'm so happy, with this product already, I can't wait to find the conditioner to match!! I've been searching! (My only complaint)
B000W3WP1W|5|Good product.
B001LKOE9G|5|Excellent product at a reasonable price.
B002HJ3Y5K|1|Broke after a week  ....junk.  Getting refund from Amazon
B0069VM7NM|5|Love all these products.  The only thing i would like to see is the facial cleanser to be more concentrated.  Feel like i need lots of pumps to get my skin clean....too watered down.
B0045PCAI6|5|Have been using Thayers Unscented Witch Hazel Toner for a few months now, in lieu of another, way more expensive, toner I'd used for years.  So far, I seem to be getting the same results with the Thayers.  Really like that it is unscented; the product I previously used was not.
B0042SJOJY|5|Love the scent. So sexy
B00BC3AS24|5|love it
B0016LZUW0|5|This product works great on hardwood floors and this bottle design makes refilling from the large jug Bona sells much easier.  These have screw-off caps versus the old design of a pry-off cap.  Same contents, just a better design of container.
B00I9HIS64|5|I even use it on my face.
B00G193RVI|5|this is a potent product.  be aware of the effects so you use it properly.  great product
B003AHGRP2|1|I do not know what is in the bottle but it is NOT THE ORIGINAL PRODUCT!!!<br />It does not smell right, it does not work right, it does not look right.<br />DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, IT IS A SCAM!!!
B003WHBIRC|5|Love this stuff!
B002CMLRY2|5|I'll use this shampoo every other week or so to give my hair some protein and build it up. It smells great and i find myself only using very little of it to do the job, i have thick hair and this shampoo gets rid of all the product build-up yet doesn't strip my hair of its natural oils. Works great with the damage remedy conditioner. Highly recommended, especially for those with african american natural or relaxed hair.
B000C21032|4|Review title says it all.  This is my wife's favorite perfume.  Macy's stopped carrying it.  Glad I found it at Amazon!
B001BAFQOS|1|I have been looking for a new shampoo for thin, soft, flat hair that has a tendency to get oily. I can't handle heavy shampoos since they weigh my hair down instantly, or moisturizing shampoos or conditioners since they make my hair oily and never wash out. Clarifying, anti-buildup and volumizing shampoos are the only option. I don't need additional shine as my hair naturally has that, so I steer clear of oils. So far the only other shampoo that works for me is Tresemme's anti-buildup shampoo and conditioner (Deep Cleansing and Remoisturize range) and Pantene's Sheer Volume shampoo (the SV conditioner makes my hair sticky and leaves loads of build-up). But Tresemme's bottles are huge and impossible to travel with and I go through the shampoo 3x's as fast as the conditioner, which is annoying.<br /><br />I decided I would spend a little more and go for John Frieda. I should have read the ingredients more carefully instead of trusting the name. The main downfall here is the sea salt. Sea salt?! This is a terrible idea for fine hair. Instead of creating natural volume by deeply cleansing the hair of any impurities and buildup, this John Frieda shampoo tries to fortify the hair with salt. SALT. I don't know anyone with fine hair who has ever gone to the beach for a swim and gets out of the water and goes &#34;gee, this saltwater did wonders for my hair&#34;. No one ever.<br /><br />All this shampoo does is make the hair sticky, especially at the roots. It also dulls all natural shine so your hair looks matte which borders on looking unwashed. On top of it all, there is little to no volume effect compared with cheaper drugstore brands mentioned above. The last straw for me is that once you have washed your hair in the morning, then dried it (you have to use a hair dryer with this shampoo because of the sea salt, otherwise your hair looks dirty and sticks down on your head - the opposite of volume), you can't really touch it again. If you try to brush it during the day or at night, the static electricity is overwhelming and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like you stuck your finger in a light socket. Although you can get the comb through it, it makes the hair roots feel &#34;knotted&#34;.<br /><br />All in all this was such a disappointment, for no other reason than it does exactly the opposite of what it claims.at night, the static electricity is overwhelming and you would never be able to get it back into any style, even a pony tail, without looking like you stuck your finger in a light socket.

B0026I6K30|5|So far, so good!  I love the silky feeling this leaves my face and neck.  I've only been using it for about 3 weeks now, but can see suble differences in the texture and appearance of my skin.
B00LOGBIY6|5|Great product for nail art
B00OWZ0TVE|5|love this item
B001QY8QXM|5|These razors work great with Merker safety razors.  Nice and smooth, good wrapping, cheap!  I would buy these again for sure
B003AYEV4Y|5|I've been using Kiss My Face A&E lotion for my daily hydration for a while and found an old bottle of this oil that i had used a while back. I decided to try it out as the cold winter dry skin had started to settle in. I forgot how great this oil makes my skin feel. I also love the smell of it. It really does provide a fantastic glow. I find that it soaks in rather quickly, but sometimes when my skin is saturated I'll have to wipe off the excess oil to avoid that shiny-face look.<br /><br />So glad Amazon is carrying this miracle oil.
B00B6KK0M6|2|the gold was a rosy gold i was expecting a lighter  colored one..  they also break easily the infinity sign necklaces.
B00KCFAZTE|5|I love this eye gel so far.  I use it all over my face as the ingredients are primo for all of my skin, not just under my eyes.  The consistency is a medium gel that spreads easily anywhere you put it on your face and/or neck.  It is clear and thinner than another gel I've used with similar ingredients (I like that one also).  These two gels are my new favs on days that I don't use retinol products.  I usually use the gel at night, but yesterday I tried it during the day so I could try it under makeup.  Once dry, I put my usual foundaion on.  No balling or rubbing off at all.  It's a terrific base for all of your makeup.  I also put it on my eyelids, but only about 1/2 way down.  I can't speak to using it all the way to my upper eyelashes as I never go that far with anything since lotions, etc. have a way of moving into my eyes over the course of a day or night.  I also like very much that you get a full 1.7oz in this bottle.  I've seen several bottles with similar ingredients with only 1 oz or even .5 oz so be sure to check the amount when ordering.  The company is lovely to deal with. They have sent me emails with information on how to use the gel and even an offer for a free bottle of hyaluronic acid.  Highly recommend,  Time will tell on the wrinkle and other improvements. Update:  I'm still using this eye gel, only for me it's strictly used all over my face except under my eyes.  My reason for skipping this region is that at my age I need something with more moisture.  I have found that when the eye gel dries under my eyes it pulls at that delicate skin and then when I move my eyes around once it's dry, that it kind of cracks and then highlights every fine line there.  So I'll continue with it everywhere else as I really like how it makes my face feel, but will use something that is much more emollient under my eyes.
B0057FSPKU|1|I thought I would give these a try...I thought, they are qtips, how bad can they be?  Well...I stand corrected.  There is almost no tip to them so be prepared to gauge your ears out.  Also the center is very bendy/breakable.  Stick with the higher priced swabs...these are not worth it!!
B001ET76GW|5|recommended by dermatologist.  Have been using it for over 10 years and will continue to use it.  Great results in skin care
B00EYMWQRA|5|Goes on so smooth very light and smells great
B001H9404A|5|Love, love, love this color.  This eye shadow is my favorite!  It is an awesome color, it stays on all day, it sparkles (but not too much), and it lasts for a while.  I wear this color nearly everyday and a container of it lasts me a few months.  The only down side is that it is a little messy since it is a loose powder.  Also, the included brush for me is pointless.  I usually end up throwing them away, which is a waste.  But as for the shadow, it is my favorite!
B00BI172QU|1|I bought this based on a video saying that it reduces stretch marks, but it didn't do anything for me. I tried it both on my tiny stretch marks and on my thicker stretch marks and non of them faded. You might be able to use it for other purposes for sure.
B000DN7BUQ|1|Received a bottle with oil floating on top, myself and others thought it looked old.  I requested to return it and never heard back.  Don't order this subpar product!
B00KOUALMS|5|Loving this product already! Leaves skin feeling tighter, truly gives a healthy glow, and makes me look years younger. A little goes a long way, & absolutely can't beat the results for the money.  Also makes me feel good knowing what I'm putting on my skin. I don't give 5 star reviews easily, but this product truly deserves it!
B00B4JZ4JS|5|love this conditioner plus it is natural great stuff
B005JPOBEC|5|Exactly what I wanted and quick delivery.
B008CGOHK8|5|It's very hard finding great products, i don't know how this didn't work for anyone else's hair, but we're all different with different textures of hair and types, also women who dye there hair obv have frizzy damaged hair that won't cooperate with great products like these
B00QN25TZK|4|Love, love this facial mask...use at least once a week after I use Micro Needle roller (1.0mm)...it is the finishing product. Bought 3 packs so I would not run out! Happy using it.
B004SU1K8E|5|great for deer hunting
B001BZX2PS|5|Perfect.  Fits 3 different size pencils and  does a good job sharpening.
B00ABBC7XQ|1|They were okay nothing special eventually a bunch of hair falls off I just used them as an ombre effect under my Brown hair
B00FXYL1IS|5|I was so pleasantly surprised to receive this sooner than I expected. I love this particular scent and thought it would be impossible to use again from back in the days when I was young and carefree. I LOVE IT  and will be ordering more things from you in the future, Thank you
B007AUGQMY|1|I ordered the Person Care Age Defying Skin Cream because I had been using it for years and absoletly loved it.  I am no longer able to purchase it locally.  I was very disapointed with the product I received from Amazon.com.  It has a horrible smell and terrible tecture, nothing like the product I had been using.  I have an allergy to some perfume so I will not be using the product I received from Amazon.com.  The product I had been using was made in China but the product I reaceived from Amazon.com was made in Canada.
B008IRBK8I|1|I bought one of these at Walmart last night and tried every which way it said to use it, but my hair kept falling out, so needless to say it is going back to Walmart. I really do not recommend this at all.
B00005JS5C|5|Battery powered, no charging needed. Works great, cleans easily
B002CL9TTS|5|its amazing! only downside is, you use it sooooo much that it finsihes quickly. Purchase 2! :) trust me you wont regret it! Plus the pink lipgloss can be worn just on its own, and its so pretty
B001AJ6YS2|5|You can spend a lot more for an electric razor, but why should you?  This is my second Norelco shaver, and since my first, the technology has gotten better to provide an even closer shave! The new \\"flip top\\" design and the ability to rinse it under running water makes cleaning a breeze.
B009D5BWOQ|5|I love these cases. Very convenient, soft, and cute. However the 4 inch height is much more versatile because you can fit the larger bottles and rollers in them as well.
B000GAQS82|5|Shiny Silver Is a great product. I'm totally sold on it.
B003KJBK3E|5|My son loves these.
B003BWX17I|5|I use this with the Kevin Murphy Hydrate Me Rinse, and the results are amazing.  It seems expensive, but you will use less of the products than other less-expensive brands because they are so concentrated, and you can even dilute them.  Definitely use it with the KM Rinse as well.  I was out of the Wash for a while, using only the Rinse, and I did not love my hair at all during that time...it felt dirty faster and frizzed out.  Now I have my precious Wash back and soft manageability abounds!  Do not hesitate.
B00JIEYQNQ|3|nice look but still a a bit longer than I expected. It is about double the length of a lipstick. As a man that is way too big to fit nicely in my pants pocket. the ca is a bit too loose. so it does not stay on well. its spray  device. function well.
B008M9US4O|5|I ordered this as an accessory for prom and it came right on time and was very nice. Doesn't seem cheap and hasn't broken. It's also about the perfect size. I'd say go for it!
B0001ZA3Y2|5|good lotion.  great buy.
B00IEY8F9C|5|I use this with the shampoo as well. I spent years experimenting with shampoos/conditioners,  occasionally finding one I think is good enough and just sticking with it until those days come where you run out and the store doesn't have any in stock...yay I get to try something new. Glad I did!<br /><br />I have very long, thin, slightly wavy hair. I live in Hawaii, a pretty humid state and during the summer my hair is a hot mess. This shampoo/conditioner combo is a God send! For once I only need the smallest amount of conditioner and it glides right through my tangles. In fact I now use more shampoo than conditioner and for the first time I RUN OUT OF SHAMPOO FIRST. Ladies with long hair you feel me, right? Honestly I think you can use any shampoo, just make sure to use this conditioner.
B000C1ZA0C|5|Very happy with my Oscar !
B004K0CRIY|5|I have to say, I was completely worried this would be a piece of garbage and not work at all, but was so desperate to do shellac at home and didn't have a lot to spend...so I took a gamble! I was even more worried when I opened it up and found the instruction written in broken English on a sheet of paper! However, I've been using this for about 9 months now and it's been working perfectly. Very easy to use. So far, no complaints and I feel like I really lucked out.
B00GWZYXBO|3|Cute scarf, but it took about 3 months to ship to my house....
B00INX0WWM|4|the wife likes it and says it works well......
B001M0NFEK|5|As ordered and above expectations.
B00400KVDC|3|It works just as good as the regular Reconstructor but it is very soupy and watery. I love the Tea Shampoo and the regular reconstructor.
B001AJ6YS2|5|This is the first electric shaver i've ever bought, and I really like it. I'd always shaved the old fashioned way with dissposable razors and shaving cream, but I wanted to try something new because it takes me a long time to shave and I almost always cut myself. The shaver is liteweight, comfortable to hold, the battery holds a charge for almost two weeks, and it shaves pretty close. It doesn't get as close as a traditional razor. But on the plus side it doesn't cut your face, and the hairs gona grow back anyway so who cares! My job requires me to be \\"flexible\\" which means (my hours change every week) so one day I may not get off work until 10 at night and then I may have to be back at 8 in the morning, so its convenient (takes 2 to 3 minutes for me to shave). The 7310XL makes shaving quick and easy instead of a pain in the butt like it used to be, and before I used an electric, my skin would always break out after I shaved. But since I started using this shaver my skin doesn't break out as bad as it used to. The 7310XL is fast, easy to use, and easy to clean. So if your sick of cutting your face and your not real picky about how close the shave is I recommend you buy it.
B00KISWGSS|5|I already have long lashes but they arent very thick but with this theyre perfect! Gives them a little extra length and a lot more thickness. I had people ask me all day where i got my fake eyelashes and how i got them on so perfect! Will buy again!!
B004BCZ5KI|5|Color is as described in the pic. I bought 7 of them as gifts to some friends. They really love it. Recommend this color, it is not light, not dark, but still very natural. I love it.
B001B7GJ2E|5|Um...Works as expected.  Solid build quality.
B000II7DKO|5|I have been wearing this fragrance for several years and I love it and get many compliments on it.  I was very happy with the cost this time as opposed to department store costs.  I also was extremely happy with the service of receiving the product.  Thank you very much!
B003EMHV1C|5|I've been a big &#34;sweater&#34; as long as I can remember, nothing I tried worked or covered up the smell.  I would have to apply anti-perspirant 3-5 time a day at least. This doesn't necessarily stop my sweating, certainly stops the smell better than I had expected!  A little pricey - but a small price to pay for the difference it makes!
B007CTNHL6|4|Packaging unappealing but product seems pretty adequate, long lasting and stays in place.  I think I like it despite its appearance.
B00J2APS60|5|This time Gillette struck gold! When I received the razor from Gillette it looked space age but when I shaved with it was heaven. I'm hispanic so my facial hairs are not perfectly straight especially around the neck area, so when I used the razor it was amazing how I can go for longer strokes with out pulling out. It cuts close to the skin around the chin and with the vibrating it's effort less. You really don't have to reposition your self to get to tight corners or spots the &#34;flex ball does it all&#34;! My only flip side is how long it last. For the money it should give me a month at least. You feel the dragging after about 3 weeks. But over all good job Gillette.
B00C7UF0PG|5|This almond oil is a works great for sugar or salt scrubs. I also use it in some of my soaps
B002Z13TJQ|5|I've used 3 fragrances from Britney and they only make me want more
B001BKLFU2|5|This item served a dual purpose.  It was used as a centerpiece on a cake for my son, with insence burning. It looked awesome and my son got to keep it
B000V1QLEM|5|I am the type of person who NEVER writes a review but for this product I must! I have the most sensitive skin and am allergic to most anything! (shaving cream, soaps, basically anything scented natural or otherwise). This product is unscented which is very important to me. I must mention to  those who do like scented products I suggest you don't apply them to your face since products that contain a fragrance as even natural fragrances will age your skin. This product sinks into my skin within a few minutes and does not affect my makeup, if anything it makes it look better. This product has also allowed me to go down a shade (from nc10 to nc5 yes I am very pale) as I wear this everyday which some may not like however I do. If you don't want to get lighter I suggest getting one with a lower spf or wearing this only in the summertime or when outside for long periods. If you have sensitive skin like me this is a must have!
B000HQ0L2E|4|I read all the negative reviews.  yes when you get it, it does feel really cheap plastic, very lightweight.  Yes it can 'scrape' like sandpaper if you go too hard.  I have moderate back hair, it works good, you have to go lightly, like someone lightly scratching your back, you also have to go slow, so go slow and just repeat over the area, if you rush you will not get a good cut.  It works and the length of the device makes it easier (the philips device looks small) to get to the areas of your back.  all I needed was a mirror with another  hand mirror, do your back then turn to the side and do each side.  yes it feels cheap but it works and has good length to get to all areas.<br /><br />I tried the Razorba, you attach a razor to it and then the angled handle is similar to mangroomer.  The razor grip did not like my triple blade shick razor and it was too small to hold anything other than cheap razor, so i cut up my back, yuck... and i threw it away.  mangroomer will take some getting used to, if you go slow and develop strategy to  get to all the places on your back you will be fine.  and it does at least fold up for travel and stores well.
B005CHHO46|2|I have been using this for a few months now and have not really noticed any significant difference. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I have noticed that I dont sweat as much as I used to since using this product. Random, I have no idea why that is. So it doesnt really work for the hair removal for me but it does have one good thing about it. Again, this is just something i noticed and could have better results for someone else.
B002FBT6M0|4|The only issue I have with this product is that it tends to be unstable when I put the polish arm at a bit of an angle to get more out.  I solved it by taping a quarter to the base, so I still use it and am thankful to have it, but wish the base was a bit more stable.
B0052JN7XG|5|Even though it is expensive this has been a great toothbrush.  I travel a lot for work so it is very nice having the carrying case that doubles as a charger.  The charging glass is very nice and looks good on my bathroom counter..... since it is glass it is very easy to clean.  My mouth has never felt cleaner.
B002GUIDEM|1|HORRIBLE, DO NOT FIT, HORSE TEETH!!!!!!!!!! DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!! COMPLETE SCAM.  ONLY WAY THESE HORRIBLE THINGS WOULD FIT IS IF YOU HAD THE MOUTH THE SIZE OF A HIPPO!!!!!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!! Let me explain:<br /><br /> First:  they are too hard, they do not soften enough in the hot water to make it possible for a close fit. There is no way they would fit EVERYONE's mouth, not possible.  If your mouth is large, maybe, they would fit somewhat.  Also, they are very thick and protrude considerably...hence the horse teeth look!!!<br /><br />Second:  There is a hard ridge going along the bottom of the prosthesis which is supposed to give you a secure fit under you own teeth, BUT, this causes a poor fit because you can't get them higher in your mouth close to your own gums!!!!  As a result you look ridiculous and they subsequently stick out even more so and really really do look like HORSE teeth!!!<br /><br />Third:  You would have to file them down some how...Seriously???? I ended up throwing them away...Complete waste of money and I am demanding my money be refunded from Amazon.  Just a very very misleading product and advertising!!!
B00GBL8VJY|5|These BelleSha Eyeshadow Applicators are good quality and work well for applying eyeshadow. My daughter is fairly picky about her makeup and accessories, so it high praise when she goes out of her way to tell me that she really likes a product.<br /><br />An unexpected use (at least to me) my found was to use these to apply paint to candles.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH<br /><br />Note: Sample provided to review
B00FG6EFB8|5|Who would buy this if it didn't work well ?  Well OK , other than me , who? Good stuff for fat old men with lots of friction points.
B000I20Q72|2|I bought this in May this year, product &#34;holding straps&#34; broke a  month ago. Lasted not quite 2 months.<br />Company should have a better sew job. Should not break. Poor quality however the scrubbing part my husband loved.<br />I would not purchase this item again until the company fixes the problem.
B00J3L0AK2|3|The bristles are kind of weak and soft but OK. Not sure I would buy it again though. I wanted something besides plastic bristles but expected a little more stiffness.
B0011FWEVQ|3|Took this religiously for 4 weeks and didn't really notice if it made a difference or not.  It might have, but won't bother getting anymore.
B000PI30DQ|5|If you have fine hair and are concerned with losing it, this is the shampoo that will tremendously help!  I was skeptical with trying it at first but after reading the previous reviews, I decided to give it a try and I'm so happy I did! I noticed a change in my hair immediately--it was stronger, almost with an elastic texture, it was shinier and more manageable.  I can't say enough about this shampoo, I highly recommend it to anyone with fine hair and truly thank Mr. Fekkai for giving us such a great product! I hope it's never, ever discontinued.
B000BIXP5I|5|Great product at a great price!
B000TVNIY0|1|The product was not white in color but dark beige and texture like play dough . I think I got a defective bottle but it was too late to return it so I'm stuck with it and its too clumpy to use.<br /><br />The product could be good and maybe I got a bad bottle.
B000EG8HLE|4|This is a really good body trimmer... I would have given it 5 stars if you could use the trimmer in the shower. And note to some reviewers/new buyers....this is for your body hair note BODYgroom. Some people use this on their face to shave/trim their beard. It isn't designed to do that.
B00B5QXP6E|5|Bought as a birthday present....my husband is totally in love. Especially No. 1. Just the right size....its a scent most men will love.
B00DZWTTUC|4|This product is good, but doesn't make me look like a 90's swamp monster like I hoped. It's green, but not green ENOUGH. Also, thanks for the great price!
B005JECMQM|1|This Company is a fraud!!!!!! My product was used for one month and it quit working, I sent it into Jose Eber as per the life time<br />warnanty and they sent it back to me unfixed and told me that I was scammed and that this product was not theirs.  I am pissed.
B0019M1ARK|3|I was really disappointed in the smell. You think of field of flowers as being very good and flowery smelling but this was lacking in smell. It does make you feel soft but I would have liked to have more smell.
B002ZNJU1U|5|Very satisfied and would give 5 star rating.
B000GCURBO|4|I switch between this and Head & Shoulders regularly: no dandruff for years. Solid.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is that it comes out brown. For some reason, a blue/purple bottle should not have coffee-with-creamer colored liquid pouring out of its hole.
B00JBA1I5Q|5|Use this on my RDA for vaping. Works amazingly.
B001MA0QY2|5|This is by far the best flat iron I've used! Love the price too!  Easy to use for an amateur like me...
B00HG1JFXY|3|Not sure how well product is working yet.
B001GNVZW2|5|Great fresh and natural feeling to hair.  Does not strip out all the oils and does not coat the hair with lots of chemicals.  Excellent Product!
B009MLSJ38|4|As expected
B000RTXPRO|5|amazing lotion
B00743J4TY|5|Next to the Herban cowboy dusk deodorant milled soap, these are only of 2 kinds of soap that i possess and will keep buying. It's $10.50 a bar of soap, it's extremely expensive no doubt..but the fragrance of these soaps!? OMG! I personally think that whoever made these soaps must have put a bottle of very expensive men's cologne, the type of perfume that you only get from Macy's and Neiman Marcus because the scent stays with you almost the whole day. But then again it's Made in France and it's a milled soap meaning they spent a lot of time care research & effort making these and you know the French whose synonimous with perfection. These are the soaps MADE FOR THE GODS because it's luxurious, very pricey but worth it. it's a BIG BAR of soap and this soap does NOT fit in your average sized soap container.The last Mistral soap bar I bought before buying these 4 bars lasted me 5 MONTHS of everyday showers!!! I love taking showers, sometimes 2X a day specially with a luxury soaps like these. You only live once to try the VERY BEST of everything and you're not getting any younger as each day goes by..so why not try and buy the very best that your hard earned money can afford!?
B00NBAKXIA|5|I love Radha! I got this product through a promotion. I left a good review on another great product of theirs (the Radha Rosehip Oil) and was eligible for this product. My eyes are quite large and on my brown complexion, the dark circles can really make me look wiped out. I don't usually notice such a quick difference with products but this eye cream is wonderful
B00J2APR98|4|Gillette sent me this razor to try and overall, I've had no complaints with the use of this razor. It gives me exactly what I would expect. A good shave. The commercial seems to indicate that this razor would bend and flex around the curvature of the Earth itself. It might, but I don't believe it matters as much for the overall shave. Basically, if you're deciding between this razor and a more expensive one, then this is a good choice.
B000Z3YVVQ|3|The good thing is that it does cover your grey but it does not stay on for long and it is not water or sweat proof so be warned.Also you have to put a lot of it on so that it does cover the grey and you have to do this everyday until you purchase another product that will actually stay on. below standard but could be used for a very temporary fix.
B00028PSC0|4|These work just as well as the \\"toxic\\" brands but, I know that chemicals aren't leaching into my body every time that I use them.
B000DN7BUQ|5|We use Zum soap daily. So many scents to choose from. The mist are great since they can be used on body and fabric!
B00JY1014Q|3|I got this for my husband (not for him to sleep with,...wink, wink). He said that it is very comfortable, soft and the straps don't pinch or scratch. But he could see under it a little bit, no matter how we tried to move it around on his face to make it so that he 100% couldn't see anything.
B004REGO00|5|I couldn't be happier with this product. My daughter has been using one we ordered last year for her acne. Her cousin borrowed it for his acne and loved it. I told him to keep it and we ordered another. When I was ordering I noticed a review a lady had wrote about using the red light on her dads feet for neuropathy. My mom has that problem not only in her feet but also her legs and hips, so I ordered one for her too. She has been using it for a month now. It has made such a difference in the pain and movement of her legs & hips. She actually attended my nephews soccer game. (something she would never have dreamed of doing before, it would be too painful) It has really changed her life.
B00L84DK9K|5|This cellulite remover and retinol have worked.  My boyfriend noticed a difference I my legs in 2 weeks.  I have noticed it also.  I will continue to use this product.  It works to tighten skin  and reduce cellulite.
B009L9ZMY0|5|This is a super cute and functional wallet especially at that price. Credit card pockets are too deep but for 12bucks I don't care...just don't push them in too far:)
B000PI3BS0|5|Great for African American hair . It keeps the hair soft and smelling good. Not oily looking. My children are bi racial and this was perfect for their type of hair.
B00BTQCCAU|3|The mask seems to be of decent quality, but the sizing is way off on the elastic straps.  This mask would be much better suited for a small child than for an adult.  I tried it on, but it was too tight.  My eight year old tried it on and said that it was tight, but not too tight.  I'd give it five stars if it were properly sized or it had been properly labeled as being sized for children when I bought it.
B001YTD3BE|4|My hair stylist recommended this product to me. I have fair skin but after about 3 weeks of daily use, I can see a very nice tan on my unexposed areas. The parts that get some sun ( arms and face), darkened a bit faster. I always try to buy hypoallergenic products if I can. I haven't had any reaction like a rash or itching with this lotion, so it's all good. When I'm able to wear summer clothing then I'll just use a good quality sunscreen.  I made a mistake by posting this review, which I wrought  for the body lotion, but the result is the same for both Jergen's self tanning products.
B00F3339U2|4|These are fairly sharp so they're kind if hard to file without a drill.
B00T3XJNH6|5|The product has worked amazingly well in 2 applications.
B000P22UUG|5|I love this perfume
B001OJFZ4M|1|Picture shown is old bottle.  That is the one I wanted but instead, I got the new bottle- that I do not like!
B000BIRJPA|4|I can't say if it works better than my cheap, Dove facial moisturizer, but honestly, it smells so good, I don't care!  The smell alone, is a treat.  On the functional side, this is a light facial moisturizer, so if you're looking for somthing heavy, this isn't it.  My one complaint?  No SPF...
B000C233NM|5|When I was in high school a friend told me about Calandre, and how it was always her mother's favorite perfume. It smelled great on our friend. All of us girls went out and bought Calandre. It had become a favorite for all of us. I use to be able to buy it at the upper scale department stores. It is difficult to find now. Calandre remains my favorite. I am passing it on to my 2 girls for Christmas. I hope they like it too!
B000E0RFLI|5|Wonderful product, was very happy, it packs well in my purse for those quick touch ups!
B0050N4DLE|1|I've used many Garnier Fructis products and have been happy with all but this astoundingly misrepresented product. It's the least unobtrusive gel I've ever used. The first time I tried it, I came home and realized that I'd been out and about all day looking like a victim of the \\"hair gel\\" scene from \\"There's Something About Mary.\\"    I rubbed the gel between my palms as I would with any gel, and then made sure to distribute it evenly throughout my damp hair, then combed it through again. When I looked in the mirror later in the day, I was appalled (though I couldn't help laughing) to see wide swaths of opaque, glue-like residue in my hair. Even with a gel that doesn't claim to have \\"Zero Flaking\\" and \\"Zero Residue\\" I would have been disgusted with the results. But considering that this product is represented as it is, I was stunned by the sticky, icky results. And just try running your fingers or a comb through your hair after this gel has dried! I'd probably get the same results with Elmer's Liquid Glue. My usual gel (Pantene) worked perfectly, but I thought it would be better to try something without silicones or parabens. But this product is clearly (or not so clearly) not the way to go. When they say it contains acacia gum, they mean gum!
B000VZ25Q6|4|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He loves it! It feels expensive..heavy and sturdy. The only thing I can say is that the razor keeps slipping off which is annoying. My husband was really stoked on it. I HIGHLY recommend this as a gift!
B002LIXTFC|4|This is a great hair straightner. I bought it at the local Walmart and I have had it for a little over a year, and it still works just a well. The iron hits up quite fast (within 60 seconds) and you can get it pretty hot. Also it has an automatic shut off. The only thing I have a problem with is just when youre holding it you can sometimes press the heat buttons and make it turn down on accident. But other than that little problem I would most defenitly reccomend this product to anyone.
B000UQEOWO|4|They dont look anything like the picture. But they still work okay. I think the price should be lower but its whatever.
B00U2QJ4R2|5|I'm just getting really into essential oils and I have to say I love these! The scent is very clean and my house smells amazing. This scent is very relaxing. Even though I ordered many, they were very carefully packaged and there was no leakage! I have been using them in my oil diffusers all throughout the house as well as in the bath. I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00BV5EW98|5|Great price and quick delivery. Good product.
B00BDIE3QK|5|Great color
B00H4I2N1U|5|It is the softest brush I have used.  I was given one by my dentist and wanted more as soon as I used it.
B001EWF18E|5|This is one of the best hair products, that I use.  It does work as far as to make your hair straight with just blow drying it.  I didn't believe the reviews, but it got RAVE reviews so I had to try it.  I am about to be on my 3 rd bottle,it's a absolute if you flat iron or want staright hair.  This is product you need.  The great thing is my husband as well has long straight hair and we both use it, the down side to that is I buy it a lot.
B0009OAGZ6|3|I was running out of this cologne so I decided to buy one on Amazon despite some of the reviews. Well, i can tell you first hand something is wrong with these colognes. My original cologne which i bought at sephora smelled great and lasted the whole day. This one smells great but it last for 2 - 3 hours top; after that you cannot even tell you ever put it on.<br /><br />Again, this cologne is great if you buy it at a regular store. I will not be buying colognes at Amazon anymore.
B00AEYGIR6|5|Very pretty and not difficult to apply.. perfect red color
B00PFEFE3O|5|After using this for 3 months I have noticed the most difference in my neck. It seems tighter andthe skin has less of that crepey thin look. Also, the fine lines around my eyes aren't quite as deep. It is great at moisturizing under my eyes. I can't use on my cheeks as I have rosacea and it irritates them. But other than that I love it every where else.
B001AHAEZ8|5|This is my first diffuser. It fit perfectly on my Revlon 1875 dryer. When I first opened it I thought it was a bit large, but after using it I realize that this is actually great because it dries my hair in no time. Very happy with it overall.
B00935AXAU|4|This is a pretty good epilator for the price. I've never used one until I got this one.  It's really good.  It does its job.  Note for those who want a quick way out of shaving: This WILL hurt if you've never waxed/tweezed before.  It's basically like tweezing your hair, except it does it in a very fast manner.  That doesn't mean that you can use this to epilate your legs in five minutes though.  It isn't a very wide epilator and is best used for small areas, except the eyebrow region.  Overall, I like it.
B004E6YIHW|3|Not bad for the money.  Easy assembly, but it is not level after you put it together.  Looks nice, we are using it to hold baseball bats, can't imagine putting wet umbrellas in it.
B004TSFBNK|5|I love these brushes for the price! They are soft but firm and hold up after washing. I have not had any shedding and have washed them three times so far. The buffing brush is a nice size and density. I use it for mineral makeup or setting with a powder. It might be good for applying liquid foundation, but haven't tried it. I use the contour brush for just that-perfect for under the cheekbones. The foundation brush is a bit small for applying foundation, but is good for getting into finer areas or concealer. The detailer brush is small, and is good for concealer or around the eyes.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great kit. I find the quality better than some of my MAC brushes and they are much less expensive. I use most of them every day. All are fluffy and soft, but pick up product well. I am glad I bought these.
B00028LYO6|5|Awesome stuff.
B000Q632E4|1|I've used several electric shavers, and this is, without question, the worst. It's too bad that they don't allow you to give zero stars, because this item qualifies. Every time you touch the shaver to your face, expect it to buzz and slow down because it doesn't have the power to cut through the most basic and simple stubble. One good thing is that the buzzing acts as a warning signal that the shaver is about to start tugging hairs out of your face, rather than cutting them. To quote my favorite product review of all time, \\"to call this a flaming pile of crap would be an insult to fire and crap.\\" By the way, I paid about a third of the price on this site, and the item was brand new in its packaging, so clearly there is an issue with selling the product in the first place. Oh, it's the nicest looking shaver I've ever seen, if only the looks matched the performance...
B006POOQ1E|5|Love the ingredients and texture. Not sure if it actually reduces dark circles and puffiness but I don't know what creme actually does. Totally worth the price for 1 oz which is twice what most eye cremes are. And, if you like chocolate, you will love the smell! Feels great and works under concealer.
B008GOR6O0|1|This is crap! It's been 3 months and I haven't received it , I really hope you guys think before you buy. It's not what I paid but the fact that I feel like I got robbed .
B008DLT9H8|5|I just started experimenting with different bushes, and I love this brush.
B000FCCKW4|1|no vibrating rings in  package as mentioned in product description. Don't recommend this. It seems there are other better offers.
B0012RST8K|5|My favorite  scent. Big bottle. Always great! I get compliments often when I wear this, but it is not an overwhelming smell
B00CZA5OMC|5|My favorite powder for all over face. I use it all the time.
B000P20R6A|5|excellent!!
B004WG4CQ6|5|I love this product. It's worked like I expected.
B0017TK2TC|4|I use this bar for my hands after climbing and bouldering (especially during the winter) to prevent flappers. I also use it for other dry areas like my ankles and elbows. Feels great after a hard session.
B004R6HIR6|3|Thank you
B004NRDZYE|4|This whitener gave me ok results after two hours. The tray and product itself were easy to use. After each use I could see my teeth getting shinier. I think my teeth are really white anyway, so I was pleased with the results, but it wasn't the same results I have gotten from white strips used 30 minutes twice a day for two weeks. If you are looking for a quick boost of whitening, this product is good.  Also worth mentioning is that I did not have the same sensitivity as the white strips I have used in the past.
B0066FVFXY|5|This wig is so adorable! I'm in love with it! I thought it was going to be too short for my taste but I tried it anyway and I'm so glad I did! It looks awesome on.
B00KCFAZTE|2|Something makes me puffy, might be the aloe
B000YZ5C8Q|5|Having naturally curly hair, I have searched for a product for years that would make my curls soft and defined, without the gel or wet look.  A friend gave me my first bottle of this Kenra Curl Defining Cream.  I have ordered several more off of Amazon, because I love it and cannot fathom the thought of running out.  I have done my Aunt's hair, as well as a close friends that has naturally curly hair and they are big fans of the product now as well.  From one curly headed girl to another, buy it!, you won't regret it!!!
B005LH3X2E|4|This is certainly doing something! Ever since using this for a few days, I've gotten more attention from my female co-workers. They generally seem more friendly around me and try to get a little closer than normal. The scent itself is pretty nice too. Even without factoring in the pheromones, it's still a nice smelling cologne. Overall I recommend this product.
B001C4YD5G|5|I love this so much!! This lip gloss has an excellent shine with staying power. The gloss also smells great and taste great and doesn't have that lipstick taste. Perfect!
B0015KO3LQ|2|Didn't notice any difference in my hair. I wouldn't buy again.
B001F4QG2Q|5|They discontinue everything I love!  Everything!  So when I saw these for $11, I bought three...  They are only gonna go up...  It smells like Berry Skittles.  Amazing!
B009G81OMU|5|After using this product, I attempted to try others (all in the Revaeleskin line), thinking ...if this was good maybe there's even better.  Trial and error revealed slight but noticeably better results with this product on a regular basis. Combined with a daily routine that includes NIA 24, at night...it has proved to be the best \\"hope in a bottle\\" especially after age 65.  When little other than physician or surgical intervention offers any improvement, my skin is in better shape than many of my contemporary friends & relatives who've opted for the knife. (Keeping in mind that the knife is soooo expensive, and requires \\"updating\\" on a regular basis, this is a far, far better option at a much lower cost.<br /><br />I have used the most expensive products through the years but your skin changes at different stages of your life. Baby Boomers, this is the way to go after 60!
B0009F3OC2|5|love it
B004ZHTM2G|5|i love these needles. ive only had them for 1 day and ive already used 3 of them. they are extremely sharp so they pierce skin very well. they are indivually packaged and they came in sets of 20. evenly divided by size .
B00ZZ0VJL4|5|Quality is non-comparable.
B000R8UET2|5|This product is really great. It's too bad they discontinued it. I have yet to find another product to replace this when I am unable to purchase it in the future.
B00NR33JCI|5|I really like this produce.  I used it a couple of times and then gave it to my daughter-in-law who has a job in the medical field. She lives in the Chicago area where the winters are hard on your skin and she has to wash her hands frequently. Her hands crack and bleed. I have placed an order for more of the product. It really helps save your skin.
B000F37UNM|3|good quality steel but not as good as the as seen on tv clippers the as seen on tv clippers have a wider mouth and better gripping quality is just as good as the seki ones don't get me wrong these are nice clippers but there are better ones out there
B00OVG34ZC|5|Great product!  This is definitely the highest quality castor oil I have used and the dropper makes the product less messy and easy to apply.  The customer service is also phenomenal, so I will definitely continue to purchase from them.
B0012ZNKWM|2|I used theses only a few times over the course of several weeks, just to be certain it was the wipes which caused the reaction. I got a botchy appearance when used which took 3 days to clear up. Perhaps not a good product for sensitive skin types.
B002LTRIKI|5|I love this colour so much, but for some reason I can't find it in stores anywhere! I was so disappointed, I was wondering if it was perhaps discontinued. I even found two separate colours to paint on my nails that was close to this colour and figured that was as good as it was going to get. My fiance suggested looking on Amazon, and I'm so glad I did! My favourite colour is not back in my collection, and I couldn't be happier. :)
B007IT3Y54|5|Love this brand of shampoo's, i got hooked on them since i tried them at my mother in law's place back in Macedonia. This is the only brand i use now, it works great on my hair.
B000OR778C|1|You buy this product thinking you are obtaining a quality product, for the price. Then 6 months later, it stops working. Very disappointing. I have bought several other irons, hoping to find one that will last. I decided to spend extra and overpay for this one hoping it would be better. It states that there is a 4 year warranty. No there is not. They clearly state that they will NOT warranty any product from Amazon. So this has no warranty. Then even if you bought this product elsewhere, their warranty terms are so restrictive, you have to fill out forms in a certain number of days, and also pay an expensive handling fee. Sorry. that's useless. In th end, the unit simply stopped heating up, after only 6 months of use. And the manufacturer refused to stand behind their product. Just because I bought it at Amazon.
B00KVOR9VI|5|I found the back scrubber a great tool for reaching all of my back.  I love it. It was a pleasure dealing with Bixore through Amazon Marketplace with the little problem I had.  They were so quick to respond and immediately  replaced the torn one. I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys a smooth back.
B001EJOPQG|5|I have tried every denture adhesive out there and this is the best. It is all they say it is. It does not take much to keep your dentures in place all day. When you first get it the diagram tells you how to use and lets you know there is no taste and if your mouth is sensitive it may feel a little warm at first. I do have a sesitive mouth but the warm feeling lasts all of 30 seconds. Also I have some issues with the way mine fit as they are my tempory plates so some of the things I would have gone back to the dentist was cleared up with the right adesive. And you will have no problem taking your teeth out to clean. It once again reminds me that amazon does their customer a great service by haveing the reviews to help when buying an unknown product.  thank you  kb
