B0072UIU4Y|5|Great quality and amazingly easy install. 4 screws and about 5 minutes is all it took
B00815MNF6|4|At my age, crawling under the dash to install the Rostra in a Nissan Versa was not gonna work. I paid my mechanic to do it. He said it was a very tight fit. ;) After installation, it works just as it is supposed to. It makes for some interesting traveling with the Nissan CVT autotrans constantly looking for a proper gear, but the cruise control really earned its keep on a recent 2000 mile trip.
B0085IJMYO|4|Got it fast.  Installed quickly and easily with a good fit.  Plastic seems a little flimsy compared to the others on my roof, but okay with that given the price.  Time will tell.
B000CFSJCY|1|One of the two packages was opened, appeared to have been returned prior to sending to me.
B009KYYUJE|5|Perfect fit and an easy fix for my daughter's Schwinn Roadster Tricycle.
B00026Z3E0|4|The one safety pin does Not fit , that's why I gave 4 stars, I have to grind the hole open more.
B007URTP8Y|5|Wonderful fit.
B005CO9GX6|5|Excellent unit, highly recommend.
B00FALVU8A|5|wow, 2 thumbs up
B004BTOTZ8|4|Seems to be working fine so far.
B000C9J65Y|5|fast shipment, parts fit perfectly
B000637TE6|5|Lots of leather furniture and car seats. Nice to buy in quantity.
B002UD0GIG|1|Do not use on eye glasses....When I did the search this is what came up.  IT RUNINED MY GLASSES....COST ME $300.00
B00BSTWYCE|5|Fits and works good.
B000WK111K|5|Awesome purchase - turn my faded engine to jet black - and without much work on my part
B007Z2PTFW|5|Bought last week have 3 tractors, 61&#34; husquvarna zero turn, 54&#34; cub cadet, and 42&#34; craftsman<br />Was  able to pull blades/sharpen and put back on all 3 units in 1hr 15 min.<br /><br />Make sure the locking arms lock and hold mechanism, let the jack up/down a little so the weight is on the lock arms.<br />Never get under anything supported only by a hydraulic jack of any kind.<br /><br />If your looking to get one of these check your local menards, they are on clearance for 119
B00537G3CY|5|The installation does require a little mechanical aptitude. Basically, you have to drill two holes in the undercarriage, and fish some bolts through. If you can lift the car up, it helps tremendously.<br /><br />Having said that, the installation was still super easy. It took maybe half an hour, although I went through the extra step of adding rust proofing to all the bare spots left by the drill.
B000C55SXW|5|This is not an OEM item for my Goldwing but was easy to fit and only needed minor modification to be just right at a fraction of the cost
B006LJBMCY|4|Great delivery and product
B00FZVIDJO|2|Had to rework wires to get them to work. Could not just stick them in and go.
B0019BXL3M|5|I love my new grill!!! I got it for a great Bargain😉
B00Z2CXWB0|4|These work way too well, to the point where I am afraid they will break the hatch hinges if I let it open on its own. They should work for the foreseeable future though.
B0085XV9JA|1|My mistake =&#62; too small.  I should have read up on it prior to buying.
B000CNGRF2|5|great pads
B00PSRORH2|5|So far so good.  These things really stick.  I've even forgotten that they are on there and roll down the back windows and when I roll them back up, they just pop right back into place.  Really cool invention.
B00ELJ526S|4|Nice sticker looks good on my hardhat & received it faster than expected
B00523AMBC|4|The filter works fine, but the little extension hose corroded and broke off, leaving part of the fake brass hose end inside the plastic fitting on the filter. Had to drill it out, slightly damaging the plastic and making it hard to prevent leaking. Replacing it with a Culligan filter which seems identical except for the color and lower price.
B0118XI3PG|1|I ordered porsche cayenne ghost lights and recieved Cadillac ghost lights
B007V2CJIQ|5|This is so much nicer than the conventional silver roll-up shades. Because it is firm and paneled, it unfolds and easily slides down into the defrost area of the interior of my BMW Z4, perfectly cut around the mirror and the visors hold it in place. I have a camel-colored canvas top convertible with medium blue paint, this looks perfect in the gold tone and works so well. I believe this will outlast the factory mylar roll-up we bought from VW for our Passat, and that is a nice shade. Wish we had bought this for the VW.
B00E1D4HUQ|5|A Bell Star for the 21st century.<br /><br />It's a pretty comfortable helmet. It's nicely upholstered. It comes with an extra-fat chin strap, which is also more comfortable.<br /><br />I've had mine for over a year, and I'm happy with it.
B000CNNTTY|3|Did not have any paperwork or instructions with it and the listing says that there is a tech line phone number on all the packages which there was not.  There was an issue with installation and we had no way to contact anyone or instructions to verify.  It also did not come with the correct bearing, but we were able to locate the correct on through a local parts supplier/
B009G5ERVS|5|Fast shipping correct product and product as shown.
B00829L1ZE|5|This did fit my 06 b7 with cell phone cradle.
B00WJOA3KM|5|Fit perfectly and were easy to install.  Paired the mounts with Rigid's SAE compliant D-Series lights for use on or off road use.  Good, short instructions for removing the factory lamp housings and mounting the replacement brackets.  Included all necessary hardware.
B0024GJ4IM|5|i like
B000C5HH3G|5|This Valve for Villager 99 Sports Calfi,Exhoust not Fed, Exhoust it's located under the Van near fuel tank so if you getting Service Engine Soon light this is the valve you need to replace its also fit Nissan Quest 99.Nissan Quest & Villager are same except body parts
B00VNBEJ1G|5|Initially when selecting these lights as a replacement to my HID lights, I was skeptical. In all honesty, I did not read the full description, but loved the look of the lights.<br /><br />When I received these lights, they were very well built with good quality, and the light quality is superb! I have been thought many &#34;off the shelf&#34; and &#34;Name&#34; brand HID kits as well as other lights, and I must say this are by far the best of quality and lighting for my vehicle.<br /><br />Here is a quick run down of pros/cons<br />1. Well packaged - MOST HIDS come with just a cardboard box and plastic wrapped around bulb, the lights came in a well thought out box that had been packaged as to not provided damage to any part of the product.<br /><br />2. Complete easy to understand manual (not needed; so easy to install)<br /><br />3. Bulbs and Drivers are pre-wired - This beats having to scratch your head and get frustrated with learning &#34;How do I get these things to work&#34;<br /><br />4. Complete install in under 10 minutes (2013 Kia Forte H11)<br /><br />5. These LED are intensely bright; as bright if not brighter than HID<br /><br />6. Beam pattern is solid and at the appropriate angle<br /><br />7. Lights instantly turn on when activated; no delay and NO FLICKER<br /><br />8. Works with Auto-On function<br /><br />9. Drivers are so small and light; no need to mount them<br /><br />10. Bright white LED light actually improves visibility because it reflects much better off road signs and road paint<br /><br />Nothing more to say, I cut my HID bulbs and the install was done…Performance has been solid and they bright.
B002TNLF2I|5|makes your bmws look sinister, nice change
B008G2ZK2W|5|I ordered these tail lights for my 1995 dodge 1500 they fit perfectly and look great
B0094BFGG4|5|Locked my bag to my motorcycle with this locking strap. Worked great added security and stability
B00065W6ZG|2|Does not work well.
B004JBWCNY|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B003IS3HV0|1|The company's owner set along instructions for application, I used it on a new pair of shoes that were stiff, as I wanted to perhaps to soften them up a little. All it did for me was put a very high gloss shine that looks fake. I hate the appearance of the shoes now, and they are not any softer.
B000C9I038|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00CPL8PSG|5|Great stuff !!! Would buy again without hesitation. This is definately the best fuel injector cleaner I have used bar none. You won't be disappointed.
B001L4TRXU|5|Works very well.
B00DQRSK9C|5|Battery is great! However it does not fit in my 2005 Harley Davidson Fat Boy.Works great for jump starting pick-up trucks and tractors. I'm keeping it.The price was great, better than any on Ebay. Shipping was super fast and FREE TO ALASKA!!! That is nearly impossible to get here. I will buy the right sized battery, and anything they sell that I may need in the future, from this company. They are AWESOME! Alaska bikers THANK YOU Power Sports Batteries!.
B0039O2OAI|4|Worked great, easy to use, and affordable.
B0090DXBEK|5|Bought two of these for a 2006 Toyota 4runner. I had an original Mater key with the dot on it and these worked great. Got them cut at ACE and then programmed them myself for free. Took all of $4 and less than 5 minutes to do it. Suck it dealerships.
B005493J1E|4|This stuff worked well to toughen-up a section of rotted wood on my back deck. Area was about 4 feet long, irregular shape and about 4 inches wide and maybe 3/4 inch deep in spots. I chipped away flaky wood and then carefully poured two bottles of the filler along the &#34;wound&#34; over two days. Waited to make sure it sunk in and got &#34; shiny&#34; as the can instructed. It's not magic, but it does make the wood stronger. I then filled in the holes/depressions with a bondo-like product and trowel and painted over that with a tan outdoor paint (low gloss) that kind of matched the natural wood color of the deck. So far (three months) it is holding up well. If you don't stare at the patch it would pass for the original plank. Good product. (Update: After 6 months (over a heavy winter) the epoxy filler I put over the JB Weld separated. More water leaked in so the rot was deeper (maybe 1.5 inches) in a two foot stretch that I had poured the JB Weld in. I still think the Weld was a good product, just asking too much for it to fill a badly rotted section. I'm going to have to replace the board.)
B007KPXBD6|1|The switches are great for about 2yrs. Then the chrome starts to peel off. I saw other reviews and they said the same thing. So I made a point to wax them so they would be protected. Didn't matter, chrome still peeled off and look terrible. So for over hundred bucks you get switches that look good for about 2 years. You decide if it's worth it. Me, no way. Went and spent the extra money on HD switches and they are very durable.
B00YVC0HL0|5|Works good for 2004 Lincoln Navigator. Not sure how easy it is to program this key by yourself. I had to go through locksmith because I only had one original key. I'm happy with the product
B0000UZ514|1|Piece of crap. It's really cool until it actuall gets used. The metal pieces that support it popped out and aren't repairable. Now the thing is like a small sack on the floor of our Suburban. This trash stand is trash.
B005H73NUA|5|Love it
B00A5VM84A|4|Really like this hitch. Installed on 2012 Honda CR-V.<br /> Amazon doesn't pack it in anything really. When it comes, it just has a Fed Ex tag on it.<br />It would be nice if they wrapped it in bubble wrap or something.<br /> Install is not too bad, my teen son and I did it in about an hour. I think the one thing they could do to improve the install is supply with a template that you tape to the car. It's almost impossible to tell where the measurements are referenced to.<br />So you make your best shot at a first cut and then see how you did. I had to trim a little more. Fortunately the underside plastic on our CR-V,<br />cuts like butter with a utility knife.<br />We had to hit the muffler mounts with quite a but of WD-40 to get them off.<br />I tested it out with 4 pretty heavy bikes on a pretty heavy bike rack, it did great.  I add a wire harness and got a Bronco's cover since it's wife's car and she likes the Bronco's  ;-)
B00G3EAGMO|5|2 thumbs up
B00199JKPC|5|I installed these parts and I have had no problems at all none. Thank you.
B0007M308A|5|Hitch worked well but still need a bigger one
B00YIAY4FK|5|Great quality fit perfectly. Fast shipping
B005EGMPD0|5|fit my 05 volvo s60 great! arrived quickly which was also great because my old headlight had to be replaced before I could head out of town
B006UXRZCW|1|The 'got' was cut off on the decal. I tried to make contact with them twice. Noone ever reached out to me.
B001C0EZNA|5|Worked perfectly in securing a second battery under the hood of my chevy truck, bolted right into the factory location.
B00GV85NS4|5|Fits my needs very well
B007Y87U0E|5|Works perfectly for a great price. My husband got my parents car back up and running in about 30 minutes. Very happy with purchase.
B005SEJTYG|5|Good
B0084O11YI|5|Very cute!! Looks great on my back glass!
B007HG09NI|5|1st trip went to sturgis SD. The  hitch performed great!!
B00DD1019I|3|I give them only 3 stars because they move more than I would like and they smell. However, they do do their job and keep the carpet clean. They would do a better job if they didn't slide around. I even left the back floor one a little big and it still slides as much as the front ones.
B000VS7C20|4|East install, good quality
B001O0TZ8I|5|Quiet and easy to install. Fits 2007 Hyundai Tucson. Some said their's didnt' come with mounting clips, however mine did. I added high temp brake grease to back of each as well as the new clips where they meet the pads no noise at all.
B00IWN6Q00|4|Part was a perfect fit. Unfortunately the product came with a broken hose connecter on the rear lower section. I was able to salvage and glue a piece from the old intake but it was not an ideal situation. Also broken, part was not in box therefor was shipped in that condition
B00RBMN5CA|5|I like this little unit not that hard to figure out as far as the buttons go. but i was a little disappointed in the unit in the fact the pick up wire is almost to short for a adult size racing kart and i was hoping that there was a back light hold that would keep it light up when racing not there. last thing is that the my unit never turns off at all but for the money it works great just as discribed.
B0016IWD78|5|Had to purchase this cable to replace and badly corroded factory cable. This cable has had no problems.
B007QV4JC6|5|Exactly what i was looking for
B007FTV9Q8|4|I like the design of this shade.  If fits the windshield of my Tahoe well.  It does allow some light to still come through as it is not a dense as some others that I have had. But it's super cute.
B00IABFTTI|5|Fair price and it fits perfect.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|GREAT little device, works well, gives peace of mind!
B007BKEGCK|5|Works great
B000BUQODG|4|Third camper I have put these on, this one has three on top. Easy to install and clean and nice when you are travelling or sitting to keep the air fresh without worrying about water damage. Was in some pretty good winds and had no problem
B00M2QMHK6|4|I have bad legs and this is just what I needed to do various jobs around the garage.
B001F8OX6I|4|Look good and simple to install. I left the vent open while it rained, no water entered motor home.
B000C7QHX0|5|Cheap alternative if you're running low on cash. My car is going excellent with it!
B000GTURP8|5|Great feel and great look- solidly made.
B00C309SVW|4|we like them but unfortunately didn't fit out bike and had to return
B008QBTVG4|2|Light is quite dim. I returned this product. I suppose it would charge a device, but for the size, the light was not very useful; then again, the product may be about what you'd expect for the price.
B0048EE65O|5|As promised in description..would recommend.
B000NW4RZ4|4|worked good
B00IACGFOA|5|GOOD BUY FOR THE PRICE
B0002NUNIO|5|love it
B00RM26HHE|5|It's a key chain looks cool. I like it
B0015YBYCS|5|just what I ordered! All good
B00FJUZY8Y|2|It comes apart too Easy
B000J43HZM|5|fits really well
B004GE2DH4|4|Excellent fit and good finish.  Had to clean up some &#34;flash&#34; leftover from the molding process. Fit as well as the original. Center bar was easy enough to remove to prep for paint.
B00JN0U4SQ|1|IT TURNED AN ODD COLOR AFTER BEING ON THE TRUCK FOR A WEEK IM ASSUMING FROM THE SUN. THAT AND IT HARDLY PICKSUP RECEPTION MY RADIO STATIONS FADE IN AND OUT. I REINSTALLED MY FACTORY ANTENNA.
B001QWXIG4|2|Says for 2inch od pipes. But when installed u will have almost a 1/4&#34; gap from od of baffle to of  pipe.
B00QMWQK2M|5|Great price and great product.
B009WDVJGA|4|Very cool looking rotor, My only problem was that the bolt holes weren't the same as the stock one from my 1999 Sportster, I had to find bolts with slanted heads to make it work. It is a very solid quality looking rotor however, a step up from the ORI one.
B007TYIIQI|5|Perfect
B00PQ2AXMC|5|Great ..!
B0019I51JW|5|No noises, no dirt, easy to install and goo braking power.
B00LTQNDOE|4|👌
B001U31TME|2|THis product did not control odors in the holding tank!  I added extra twice to the tank and it still stunk.
B003TTL0TE|5|Works excellent. Is larger and holds soapy water well. It's made for the slight curves of the car not wheels and stuff.
B004RFKBEO|1|No unfortunately I am not able to attach it to my car because the engine is in the back and I can't figure out how to return it
B00G0HA4OY|5|Definitely will recommend this product. Worth the price.
B001DHE0KA|4|It was New
B00NEL6HT0|4|Like other reviewer mention. It smell oil as soon as you take filter out off plastic wrap. I left it outside almost 2 days then installed it, still can smell a little bit for few day then is fine now.  I believe this filter will save money as long as I still keep the car because do not need to replace it like factory one, and also can clean it anytime I want it, other than that performance is the same like factory one.
B002THX2TS|5|Great little product -- this really gave me a nice tote to keep my sunglasses and phone in.  So little space in  my car.  This wouldn't hook to my air vents (mine are designed a bit different) - -but I was able to slip the tab into the glove box and close it and it hangs there.  The tab is sort of a covered wire-- you can bend/shape it.  Love the product.
B00KTHU1QM|3|have to press really hard to get the doors to unlock. the double press doesn't work but half the time. But it works.
B000C2Y5CU|4|Matched fit of OEM hose almost perfectly. The only deviation was the support point for the smaller hose (to bottom of coolant reservoir) was slightly off in position, but could be relocated if desired. Three separate hoses plus 'T&#34; of Ford OEM part are replaced by a molded in &#34;T&#34; and fittings, eliminating 3 clamps. Only additional step required was swapping anti-chafe mesh sleeve from upper part of small old hose to the new one before installing.
B003BVK85C|5|Worked as intended.  Replaced my brittle shower cover.  Had to create new screw holes but other than that a perfect fit.
B006B2Y1A6|5|If you don't have one of these your missing out.<br />Great product good quality.
B001NZ0SP8|5|Exact part i needed. Works perfect. took about five minute to install.
B00MA7FGOG|5|I absolutely love these seat covers. Great fit, great quality, excellent price. Mahal nui!!!
B007VR6S7O|5|I put this in a built Chevy 350 that has an MSD CDI box, Accel super coil, and 8.5mm plug wires. I needed a distributor that can handle the voltage and this does a great job! It is very well built. The shaft is a lot thicker than the weak stock one. The price is unbeatable for a billet distributor of this quality.
B001VE1L9S|4|I had to return it because size is too small. I got XLARGE but it was on my lips and hitting my nose.
B00J6990A2|1|Lights are not as bright as I thought they would be.  Had to add lock nuts to each fastener.  Screw that holds light to mount on less that 1/8&#34; thread vibrated off on the first ride. I'm not going to be able to use these.
B00SVXS3A2|1|Lot smaller in diameter  then machines dump box. I would like to no were to send stuff back an get money back
B0085IIRY0|5|Just what we needed. Perfect fit
B007YYL6LW|4|The boots are pretty sturdy. Air gets in so the feet don't sweat. It's wide enough on the top that you can tuck the bottom of your pants in it. The zipper/velcro is a really good combo to make it a tight fit around the calf area. I usually wear a 9.5-10 and I bought a pair of 10 and they fit me well.
B001JT7AJA|4|Excelent product
B006RGRAOK|5|Excellent metal License plate holder that appears to be strong which should last until the boat trailer is gone. In the end, I didn't need it because I had to buy new trailer lights at harbor freight. Inside the package was a plastic tag holder, all the wiring and electric connectors necessary for about 20 dollars. I used this holder because it will out last the flimsy plastic one. I did my online research and found this holder and the seller to be my very best buy. I definitely recommend this tag holder.
B00CL02WX0|5|👍🏽
B00XV4W686|5|Super bright! Looking to do my rear light bulbs and will definitely go with JDM again.
B00ANZW28U|5|Fast Shipping, Great price and quality and easy to fold and put up
B00067BUTC|5|Haven't used them in the fog yet. Very nice high quality.
B0057O0GSA|4|These Cobra waffle weave towels do seem to work better than standard microfiber towels.  I use them along with Invisible Glass for cleaning my Audi windows.  I fold the towel three times leaving me with a 6&#34; X 8&#34; section.  I'll spray Invisible Glass onto half my windshield, wipe it off in circular motion with the 6&#34; X 8&#34; section of towel then flip over the towel and go over the glass once more with the new dry section of towel.  It seems to me that I should be left with a perfectly spotless windshield.  But when I drive into the bright sun, I invariably see sections where I apparently didn't wipe the windshield appropriately because I'll see wipe streaks even though I felt that I did a thorough job wiping the windshield.  If anyone sees a flaw in my method of cleaning the windshield, I'd be happy to hear their suggestions for getting a streak-free windshield.
B00SA43V1I|2|Did not come with the tube to view level. And the included hoses are not ment  to hold vacum. But for an extra couple bucks at your local hardware store you can get all you need and it's still a preety solid piece
B00080QHMM|4|Works
B00E5OUOCQ|4|Great product.  With the outside temperature at 113F, helps keep the car's interior temperature bearable.
B00B57W3A2|1|Left the dash cover on the dash in searing 98 degree weather. It never settled to the proper fit. It still is lumpy looking. I'm disappointed
B003ULSUIU|5|very good
B005DN1D1Y|5|Great product
B000PA00XM|5|Looks and functions exactly like the genuine BMW part, I have had no problems with it whatsoever. Don't spend your money on other cheap knockoffs! This cable has a low pass filter embedded in it, which prevents unwanted noise. I can even charge my iPhone while playing through the aux port without any annoying interference, that you commonly get on other radios (or adaptor cables) with aux in. The sound quality ,in my opinion, is superior to that of CDs and other input sources (given that you have a high quality audio source, like an iPhone playing high bitrate audio (you can get this from apple music or Spotify)). I know that I was surprised by the audio quality, even though I have the base model sound system installed. But you must make sure that your radio is supported, as just owning a BMW made in 2003 is not enough. I was able to get this to work in my 2001 330Ci (e46) with a simple radio swap from a junkyard. It was just plug and play, no programming required, the only thing I lost is the radio function, as the antenna connectors do not match. (from what I understand BMW changed the antenna connector and antenna signal amplifier in 2002 (but if you care to you can also swap these out to restore AM/FM radio functionality)). It seems like the majority of people having problems with this product, are really having problems with their amplifier. JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE A PLACE TO PLUG THIS CABLE IN DOES NOT MEAN IT WILL WORK! There is a great forum post that gives the model numbers of each radio, and the functions they support so please check this before assuming the product will work.<br /><br />http://www.bimmerforums.com/forum/showthread.php?1611782-Guide-to-Buying-E46-BMW-Business-CD53-Alpine-Radios-that-play-MP3-Data-CDs!
B00PI7JV46|4|good quality.
B0058TF7DI|4|Good quality. Only negative, if that, is that it stretches a lot. We knew we can't depend on only the net to hold our luggage up there since we ordered it, but it was big and we just used it along with the ratcheting tie-downs. Worked great.
B004Y9YIU6|4|Great
B00BQWQLQI|3|Three starts only because I truly did not feel as though these made much difference over the 140k-mile OE bulbs (that were still working, albeit, just not as bright as they once were) that I took out.  I'm not sure if some of the yellowing of the headlight housing may have anything to do with it, so take it for what it's worth...
B004Z1JH9A|5|That was the product I expected.
B002OAODZC|4|Works for my s<br />street bob
B000CP8DKC|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B00KTHWZIE|2|The key blank does not start the car because there is not chip in it. I had cut to match the original and it would unlock the door and fit the ignition and turned the engine over and it would not start up. The battery is good, but its like the spark plugs were unplugs.
B005H2SHS8|5|Shipped fast and was just what I wanted this oil is way better than stuff at national auto parts chains
B000BUOSGQ|5|If you camp, get this.  Have it screwed in next to the sink and counter and it is great.  Those bags that you never know what to do with after they pile up are super handy in a campground.  Buy this with the pop-a-bag hanger.
B00099DW6G|5|great batteries, functioning flawlessly.  delivered on schedule.  well packaged.  strongly recommend.  I will buy my next battery thru Amazon
B0076HTT0M|5|as described.
B009LM88MU|5|Great product with a great sound!
B00L8KV75S|5|Received quickly and was well packaged.  was very happy with the thickness and durability od this mat.  Great purchase!
B00651OAVS|5|This exceeded my expectations. There was one joint that I thought for sure was going to leak, but it didn't.<br /><br />Tip: Use slightly more material in your double flare tool as this seems to compress more.<br /><br />Hasn't gone through a winter, so take my 5 stars as ease of installation / perceived quality of the product.
B003OBPTV2|5|Worked
B009M4UTGA|5|Carburator was a very easy install. Can be done in just a few minutes. My seven year old lawn tractor now runs like the day I brought it home. THIS IS A QUALITY O.M.E. part. Be sure to use a new fuel filter at the same time. WE would not have these problems if thay stop using corn to make gasolline!!!!!!!!
B00QJRYMFC|4|I've been having a few issues with my 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid recently (Check Engine/ABS Lights) and wanted to be able to read the trouble codes without having to shell out $100+ to the dealer.  I didn't want an ODB-II device that used WiFi, since it's always on thus draining your battery and disables your phone's internet connection while you are connected to it.  So I chose this less expensive Bluetooth model and downloaded the recommended Engine Link app from the App Store for my iPhone.  The LELink works, it shows me all sorts of performance information from my engine.  But the only error codes it seems to show me are related to the emissions system. It doesn't show me the error codes when I have a service light on my dashboard.  I've even tried to clear the codes, but that doesn't seem to have an effect on the service lights.  Maybe I need a custom PID or something? I'm not sure, but this isn't the quick solution I was looking for.<br /><br />UPDATE: So I noticed a random note in the change log on a recent Engine Link App update which said something to the effect of adding support for Ford Escape Hybrid. Now the App and ODB device do pretty much what I wanted. I can see all the codes for my Escape. I haven't tried to reset them yet, but I'm so much more pleased now that the App Developer has added the custom PIDs (or whatever) for my vehicle.  If you're not seeing something that you're expecting, it might be worth reaching out to the developer to see if they can add support for your vehicle.
B008BC8EW0|5|Awsome product fit and finish are great easy to install and work like a factory opposition
B00SEN2QX4|5|how can you not like it !!
B005CLLYBQ|4|Just right
B00G49NYKY|5|Don't know why anyone would want their wheels to smell like oranges but I bought this because someone in my house had it and I used a lot of it. Keeps the tires wet and glossy. The smell is a plus I guess
B00YR3YMPU|2|The mirrors vibrate a lot.  Was hoping they would be better than the clip on tow mirrors that we had before.
B002T01JMC|4|Makes a big difference  ( much smoother)
B0023VKXAG|5|Very easy to I install . Just like a factory light
B00CHD6QXI|5|Purchased this bumper to replace a rotted OE bumper for my father's 2006 Chevrolet Silverado regular bed.<br />The installation went very well.  Great fit and really looked nice.  It has some nice weight to it so it will hopefully stand up to the elements better than the original bumper.<br />I reused the factory nuts and bolts rather than the provided bolts etc. because the factory bolts seemed better.<br />The supplied brackets made the project take little time.<br />I think it took me an hour.<br />I would buy from this company again.
B000E2CVI8|5|Good filter to use if you only change the oil once a season.
B001AV545Y|5|A+A+A+A+A+  Great product
B006GX8UK2|1|Not made well, returned it!!!!!
B004PQDNZ4|1|The frame I received isn't the same  as picture. I wouldn't have ordered it if the picture was accurate.
B000C54388|5|Fit perfect on my 1991 chevy k2500.
B003ZE6NW2|3|It's okay for the money. The screw threads are a bit off but it still works
B00HEEXIKO|2|These worked for a few days, even triggered a &#34;low pressure&#34; warning correctly (tire shop only put 30psi in them).  Then, I intentionally let air out of my 2 rear tires to go drag racing (from 40psi to 22psi)....I've done this many times with my stock sensors and never had any issues after pumping the tires back up.  Now I get an &#34;inactive&#34; message and am searching for a solution.....  Update: they are working again. 5 days in a row now. We will see how long it lasts....
B000EDQQJM|5|works great
B00ARD0IAW|1|lasted about a year had to change them again
B00LU9ROB8|5|A little difficult to fit the bag because mouth are universal.  But once on. The bags stay in place.  Good buy.
B00KQPMZIO|4|Very great to have for taking in/out town trips. Wouldn't use for long term storage.
B0002KKIXC|4|This stuff is seriously amazing. Gets out really tough stains, and I've had them all...chocolate, old coffee stain, rust,grape juice, these are only a few of the crusty event that occurs at my house daily. If you have any carpet keep a bottle of this stuff on hand.
B00DSD58DA|5|I LIKE IT
B00139FQSS|5|So far so good... haven't popped it yet...
B003LUPH2M|5|Excellent I love them. They are super bright
B00TO8CLHY|5|Love these fish tails!awsome price and sound
B00DSOL3OC|5|Worked great. If you remove the lower steering wheel housing, it's MUCH easier to get the airbag off!!!
B0002I9YKM|3|Pros - Looks great! Glows bright, but not too bright to use while driving. I have mine mounted on my dash line of my 14&#34; corolla S, looks amazing! Size was perfect, didn't need to cut.<br /><br />Cons - The transformer it comes with emits a high pitched whine when turned on, I can hear it faintly, very annoying. Also the super glue it comes with was hard as a rock when I received it. Minus 2 stars for these things.<br /><br />Yes, I would still buy it, but be aware that you will need to buy your own super glue and bury the transformer somewhere in your dash to muffle the sound it makes. Or just buy your own.
B00CPGQ1GO|5|works great
B00EELM7PM|5|Excellent customer service by far.
B00EI6CKVE|5|This super fun auto decal is on my minivan and I get complements on it all the time!  The YOUR STICK FIGURE FAMILY was delicious decal is whimsical and fun and best of all it doesn't let the whole world (read Dexter-type people and robbers) how many people are in your actual family!  I am a huge dinosaur fan so when my niece and I saw this she rightly suggested I buy one ASAP!  I really just love this decal and it was easy to apply and has held up very well, a definite recommend :-)
B0041TR892|5|Great! fits as is, blends in perfect without painting. Very easy installation. Only thing is the mirror is zoomed in very close as far as the reflection view. Becomes a little difficult to determine distance at night time, but can take some getting used too.
B005X9KO86|5|Works great! Better than the old one. Thanks
B00069IBFQ|5|Appears to work as described. Goes on waxy and white but dries clear. I have not tried to remove the product yet so no word on how that works. I am using it to store engine parts for a long term rebuild project.
B00B32DF24|5|Great kit, user friendly, easy install!!!!
B00GBBBBKU|4|Solid construction, but they'd better be for the price.  Nothing bad to say about these except that I'm one of the dumb people who bought a car and didn't insist on floormats being included, so I bought these on Amazon just to spite the local dealer.
B00AQ29FOY|1|sent it back
B001T4SK1W|2|I returned it because the padding moved around easily. I was confident that it would support the impact areas if I were to take a spill. A smaller size wouldn't have fit.
B007I8Q3M6|5|Makes my friend look really tough, but sophisticated!
B00M4OCEPY|5|Great deal Fast shipping!!!!!
B00V30J86I|2|It's a great idea but it doesn't work!  I have nothing to hook it to on the bottom and the elastic in the cords are to strong to stretch very far.  Like I said nice idea bit it doesn't work!
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Awesome fog lights!!!  They are super bright!  At night you have to turn them off when another car is coming at you.  They are a blinding at night.  The housings are solid metal construction and look great.  I've been very impressed so far.
B000NCOKQK|5|Worth the money! buy it!!
B004GC7HZE|5|Nice bumper, easy to install.
B003VFHSBK|4|Very good
B00BVB5C1O|5|Fixed the problem.  Easy to install.  Only needed a screwdriver to pry up the front of the old one.
B002UC2R8O|5|good product
B00I9AE392|5|This was described accurately and perfectly fit Dongfang scooter.
B007JLZJ1I|5|I purchased this fender to update the looks of my sons 2007 KX100.  The fit and finish is really nice and the plastic is thick and good quality.  He has laid the bike down a few times and it has held up perfectly.
B005FJ4U2K|5|Quick easy to do business with Works great
B00AOA3HGU|4|rear fit weird but front was great and seemless
B0002NILP6|5|Very nice peice.  Looks, fit and feels great!! Very pleased!
B003172CBO|5|Mounted on my crf 230 street scrambler. Had to have it.
B000C83PWA|4|the item we ordered is for a spare since GM has a problem with the item
B005DLNDVY|5|Work great on my bike!
B003YDY7YK|1|Risk of fire. The danger is between the 50A breaker at the campground panel and the 30A breaker in the RV. In other words, the 30A cord and where it makes the transition from cord to the RV's 30A hard wire that then goes to the RV's breaker panel. I have repaired an RV where the 30A cord/hard wire transition (in a metal junction box) burned up all of the wiring inside the junction box.  If it wasn't for the metal junction box, it would likely have burned up the RV instead. Everything between the campground panel and the RV's breaker panel (internal RV wiring and cord) is designed to carry 30A - and you will be plugging it into a 50A breaker. Ask any electrician about attaching a 30A cord to a 50A breaker. Use at your own risk.
B000ZO0CKE|5|Works well and is sturdy.

B001L47BRE|5|It wa perfect
B008J6J6IY|1|Part was nonfunctioning.  Requested refund.
B00R8N2R2G|5|no problem
B003CK5QKE|4|Fit as it should except the dust covers.  Still can't be beat for the price.
B004JAQN62|4|It's the end of my season and I wanted to drain this fuel tank. The bolt, as it turns our was screwed in by the mfg and it was stripped and driven in crooked. Now I need a new bolt to stopper the drain hole. Will the mfg. please send me one?
B00C5I4USI|4|excellent set of pads
B00G1YF068|2|This item worked okay. Only 1 bulb worked fully the other only half worked...the flat end would light up but not the surrounding led. If you fiddled with it they would light up but only flicker on and go out immediately, before anyone says it's the socket these are being installed in new sockets plus it was further verified by trying it in another socket on the vehicle same problem.
B001GBJVDO|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00K6D6TFQ|5|Great product very bright sticks to the back of my windshield very good!
B007JAFP6S|5|My six year old neice knows my truck by my cross.  Love showing my faith and love for God.
B00N34HIFA|1|This will NOT work with 2003 R6!
B00HFL73VQ|5|does a fantastic job ... where other products fail
B000GZMA3O|5|I recently installed this in a 98 Wide Glide. Install was pretty straightforward, with a few caveats....<br />1. Replaced factory INA cam bearing with a Torrington bearing, which is a necessary upgrade for reliability.<br />2. This cam needs to be shimmed in later year Evo engines. Simply order a 0.055&#34; shim and put shim between thrust washer and the cam. (Note: assembly order of thrust washer and shim are critical).<br />3. Not sure about how to measure gear mesh or if the cam has the right gear on it...easy no worries fix.... use hydraulic press to press gear off both cams and press the old factory matched gear on to the new cam. Use one of those big illuminated magnifying glasses and a carbide scribe to make index marks on the old gear, indexing off the edges if the keyway on the camshaft. I noticed that the new cam gear was already scratched in such a way. The gears press off fairly easy, old gear goes on new shaft fairly easily with a press, I heated the gear with a heat gun first to make it easier. I got the index marks lined up within the the +/- error of my uncalibrated eyes on the first try.<br /><br />Bike runs great with this cam,  no regrets.
B000GU0MMK|5|Really nice return signel, made of metal construction, not plastic, easy to install.
B00FQHY64S|3|I have a bottle of this an a bottle of Wizards Matte. I find myself reaching for the Wizards.
B00XM1078O|4|Very good price, easy to install. Look great in my BMW X5.
B0057GUKXE|5|Thought I wouldn't be able to take something on my wheel but it isn't bothersome
B00JGP8I1S|3|broke did not stay on visor very good
B00681BE2S|4|Very satisfied with item.
B003SKCARK|4|Bought this for my dog's leather harness and after using it, the leather looked and felt better than when I first purchased it. Highly recommend this preservative.
B004I12424|5|It fits, it works.
B00B9XDJMS|5|Great oil! Bought for my husbands Duramax transmission.
B00BNR85AQ|5|I love this technology for my 65 289. works great
B0053P69IO|5|Strong, very well made. Easy to put on.
B00RE6KV48|5|Good product. My leather saver. I use it for my leather couch and my leather jackets
B001O1L166|5|Excellent. Fits well & very good as a protectant.
B00NKMX27S|5|Works perfect for plugging lines and hoses. I'm a technician at a dealership and use these every day.
B007KPTKD6|5|Fits perfectly
B00GBSCSQE|5|Nifty little accessory for odd jobs around the house and garage!
B000BQ088M|4|Nice quality
B0000AZ68T|4|Seems to be working fine and installed easily.
B0044GJKKW|5|excellent product for price
B00684TIVE|5|Loved it. Easy to follow directions.  😃
B00JKSSXFM|5|100% satisfied. Real legit combo package!
B008DQV88Q|4|fitted into 7&#34; dia headlamp support and provides improved low and high beam.
B00I548T7O|3|Nice looking but didn't like the ends they had open gaps for the weather to get into during the winter months
B0071I2OHG|3|Okay quality did the job
B00547ITSE|5|its v good actually
B00BVPUU3U|5|did not use yet but I know it should work
B007VXD11O|4|Installed in minutes stopped water from leaking inside the cab.
B000BQSIWK|4|So far this is a good unit.  However I cannot use it as a 12 volt source as you would a regular charger.  As in while checking fence chargers, etc...  It just has safety features that prevent over loads that reduce the chargers usefulness,
B005P96MNA|5|All good !<br /><br />Around year 2007 (today is late 2015!) I researched a lighter but equal/or better electrical specs than my stock car battery, and discovered \\"Braille Auto\\", who was still a young company.<br />Never changed it since.  Works as advertised - extreme weight reduction & yet electrically equivalent to stock batteries if you match electrical specs of course (energy capacity, Cranking, ColdCranking Amps, etc.), more or less.<br />Only thing I changed is, I started with Braille's 15-pound model in 2007, but in 2015 changed to 17 pound to support the growth of my audio + navigation/etc. electronics (was afraid to overload such a little battery).<br />It dies about in the same time as your stock batery would (ALL batteries are consumables, i.e. expect its death & buy new, eventually), NO compromise, yet MUCH LIGHTER vs. stock or any commodity sold in stores (Braille seems is only orderable online, not in stores?).<br />The idea is: weight reduction = better fuel economy & agility (acceleration/braking).<br /><br />Comment: I mount unlike manufacturer intended - I use a rubber bracket (extremely light and flexible), which came with the first Braille in 2007 (but since then they changed to Aluminum), tied by two oversized wireties (black plastic) on each side, hard to explain without showing a picture.  This is softer than current mounting shown on their website, with aluminum bracket, etc.<br />Being \\"a little crazy & purist\\", I didn't want to add weight EVEN by metal hardware, I used a rubber/wireties, and yet battery doesn't shift due to normal vibration.
B00VUO53PW|5|Great product met my expectation in every way as always ARB comes up with great innovation. Really put your mind at ease knowing what the fridge is set at
B001G4Z5J0|5|It's robust, well build and I have been using it to travel many places. The only small issue is that the bolts and iron are not treated for rain...so, it's up to the buyer to find a way to protect the steel.
B00GPRPGOC|5|Great!
B004Z4LM5O|4|Great car wax
B00HL9P5SU|5|looks great on the 4 wheeler.
B005FFA55U|5|No problems.
B00JORJXRQ|5|worked perfect
B008IGKIOG|5|I have never done this before but it turned out great..My friend and I used this on the bed of his truck. This product already comes rationed to mix half the kit at a time. Makes it much easier no measuring needed! The prepping took us approximately 7 hours. After sanding entire truck bed with 120 grit and rinsing realized we barely got clearcoat off! Sanded entire truck bed again with 80 grit and that did the trick. Cleaned truck bed with soap and water and allowed time to dry. Spent at least 1.5 hours masking off everything and wiping down bed with a solvent just to be sure we got all dust up.<br />I sprayed this on truck bed using the gun provided. reducer cans double as paint gun canisters. MAKE SURE NOZZLE ON GUN IS TIGHT! my nozzle fell of mid spray.<br />Best advice I can give to anyone having just done this last night is this.<br />Spent time laying down substrate on ground under truck all the way around! this stuff is so messy I cannot stress this enough..<br />If your going to add 1 whole bag of rubber to mix add even more reducer than provided!  I learned the hard way folks. When I mixed second half of product I used very little rubber and this sprayed sooo much better. This product is so amazing if your smart and plan ahead. Good luck to all ! Check out my pics
B00HTP8N0I|5|Haven't had occasion to use them yet, but I like to carry them in the bike for that emergency tow.
B007IW0C4C|5|PERFECT FIT.
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works well with Carista for Android. Able to check codes and make modifications on a VW.
B0048FUS82|5|This fit perfectly.
B00JF5HR7K|5|Hangs a little low on my jeep.  Still a great product.  For the price I got it for couldn't be happier.
B00G620ZVU|5|Easy hookup and pretty bright. Took me less than 30 minutes to replace my old KC lights with these. I would buy them again.
B000CO9168|5|Stopped door rattle and sucked door in tight.
B00D2QL0DU|5|Good for what it is designed for, plan to have good use of it.
B0000AXY62|5|Solid & rust-proof
B00GJJNQB6|5|Quality OEM part. You can't go wrong.
B005H7DRQA|4|Good product
B00O92T1NC|5|Great product, but a little small.
B00X8SVVQI|5|I charged my Samsung S4 three times and it still had power left
B006P89JYO|5|Viet Nam vet...so this is a must on my vest!
B005PZMLDY|5|They look nice.
B008TG7JNI|5|2 day delivery,it fit and it works.
B010GJJBK4|4|Does the job.
B005NLQAHS|4|works well for what i use it for...i.e. basic analysis and diagnostics..
B00KFPDLZQ|4|I like the color of these compared to incandescent.  They aren't really any brighter than stock but since I used them to replace my liscense plate bulbs that is what I wanted.
B00VB2OE9O|5|Very satisfied.
B0074BPS9Q|4|I am very pleased with the product but wish company would send more instruction on how to install
B00DZL2BP8|5|great
B00B5HPP7A|5|Very Firm ride but lowered the car with no rubs even with full back seat. Great purchase!
B00KY0BYXS|5|Work great on 2000 Audi A4 1.8T.
B00JA3BMDW|4|nice toy.. checking everything and anything for temperature.
B00JRHI1LM|4|Was better than we expected.
B00GJQDRJU|4|Got these for my knock-off Chinese pocket bike engine. No issues, except it didn't contain the gasket for the carburetor bowl. I'll buy these again if I take then engine down in the fututre.
B00NLMDIDK|5|Love it, keeps my car clean and cool.
B00E9G1NU2|5|Worked as a perfect replacement on my 2000 Bayliner Capri 2150 Bow Rider, Merc Cruiser motor.  Not sure if the marine coating makes a difference but my last starter from Napa Auto parts only lasted a little over a year.  I've been using this new starter for about two months and has been working great.
B00265BWK4|5|Good looking filter. Fit perfectly.
B000VSYFFW|5|Great product. Very slimline and sleek. Only issue was my auto up feature on my windows will start to go back down sometimes. I am assuming this is a safety feature of the vehicle. With that said I think they are a little too snug in the channel but overall a great product.
B003CJAXX0|4|My stock exhaust didn't have separate gaskets so when I replied it with an aftermarket exhaust I needed these. They fit the bill and performed as expected. Good to have a few extras around just in case.
B00N58KQMQ|4|Works great. Installation was easy. I did have to grind a little of the lock so it would clear the screen door. Used a dremmel and took 3 minutes to do it. I would buy this again. Happy with purchase.
B005OVJU5Q|4|I haven't installed this yet, but looks to be typical good GM quality.
B001PLYWAM|4|switch works perfect the only problem is the lack of instructions. you can use multimeter to find out what terminals go to what. a simple diagram on the packaging would of been great. it gives you a little paper with a website to go two but that just makes you sign up to an instructions website.
B00CA5PJ5O|5|Worked great. I have AAA coverage and they programmed it for free. It probably saved me $4-500 by not going to the dealer
B00CB20W3A|5|Fit as expected
B00B2B5V00|4|Decent for the money, but the ride quality isn't very great. Will use again.
B00N3VGPYS|5|Very fast delivery, packaged was perfect, all parts were correct and finally, The PRICE was perfect!
B00IG0F06K|2|I love, my lexen leds they set of my road king , just the right  amount, of lighting, looks sharp
B000FSDZTU|4|Did a great job cleaning the soot off our mantle and fireplace. And my convertible top where someone thoughtfully rolled coals on me.  It did take a bit more elbow grease than the instructions implied, but what a job it did! Thanks! met all my expectations.
B00ODFOFWM|5|Top notch materials and construction!
B00D9C2CDO|4|Fits great. Spacious. Very cost-effective. Very happy with this purchase.
B00R8N39P0|5|As stated, works great.<br />Fast postage
B0039LDF4A|5|If your forks are leaking I would suggest buying and trying this before spending them money to rebuilt them. I'm glad I bought this as my leak was caused by a few grains of sand caught in the seal. Simply insert into the seal and turn around the entire fork a couple times and they are clean. Make sure to wipe down the exposed fork with some cleaner before reinstalling the dust seal or you will just have the problem again. A+
B00KY0ND7I|5|The starter is new, looks like good quality materials. It was an exact fit, came with instructions if needed. It worked fine with no issues.<br />Cant beat the price & has 2 year warranty. I would buy this brand again.
B000ZRW78Q|5|Great Product at great price. I used this to turn a rear camera on and off in the trunk area because the backup light would not handle it and I wanted the option to turn the camera while on the Interstate.  The 170 degree camera gives me a good view of all the lanes of traffic.  I am sure this will work for most anything 12V that you want to control. It turns the power on and off as soon as you press the button. No delays.  Works Great!!!
B0032H379E|4|Very good top for the money. My only concern is the &#34;hold-down&#34; system being strong enough for higher speeds. Time will tell if my fears are unfounded.
B001KQ43MY|5|VERY GOOD
B007GRSIUO|5|These reduced thickness cheekpads were just the ticket for my Neotec. The originals were way too thick, and actually gave me a headache after an hour. Shoei should have included these as an option with the helmet. Comfortable, easy to install, and worth the money, IMO.
B004C63F5A|5|works perfecly in my toy tacoma
B0002JMF9I|5|Does a fine job
B00J8WBICA|5|There are two different dipstick for the Toyota 2F engine. This one matches my date of Mftr and keeps me from overfilling. It also stopped a sneaky vacuum leak.
B002DLYR8A|4|Was perfect for the costume.
B00DQUA2OA|3|great quality but way too big for my car put in for a cover for a Mustang so granted it fits because its way too big for my mustang but i would rather too big than too small.
B003VLBPJA|5|Fast shipping. I use this constantly. Very stretchy
B009LN10X8|2|The quality was good, but it didn't fit my 2005 Pacifica. The glass was the correct shape but too small.
B00VZB15OS|5|Day delivery. Packaged well. Worked as advertised.
B003YJ8TVQ|2|It has a spring inside the lighter holes that keeps pushing the plugs back out. Why would you design it with such a powerful spring?
B004EKYB7U|5|The knob looks and works exactly like the factory knob.  Installation was simple, I would definitely recommend this product.
B00KTHXO2U|5|Took me a minute to program them but little problem doing that and working like a charm!!! Great product!!
B00BUAFRJ8|5|Provided as posted & on time
B00LX0C8XS|5|Love these. They're well made with multi strand copper and suitable connections. Realitively light weight to boot.
B00K36QPCS|5|Part fit perfectly on my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500.  No issues with installation or fit.
B00PRFGHB4|5|Great product!
B00QYEUSSA|4|Would recommend it, nice product easy to install but read the instructions and look at youtube videos to help remove the grill front first.  Only issue you have to bend it a bit as is not a perfect fit as first.
B000EQP9JC|5|Perfect replacement for 2007 Uplander but didn't fix my problem. Not the parts fault I am still troubleshooting my engine. 5 minutes to install.
B00VLD98YY|2|The lights are halfway decent but I was very disappointed when I received the lights and there was no gasket that goes between the light and the trailer I understand they are waterproof but I don't like the idea of having to mount a plastic mounted light directly to metal without there being some kind of a gasket to help with vibration and shock. I am going to go get some gasket material and make my own rubber gasket for all the lights. boat trailer into the water I noticed that there is water that stays within the light housing I had to drill 2 holes for drainage. But what do you expect its made in Japan.
B00F4M37FE|5|Amazing sound quality and volume!!! Worth the money!! Would highly recommend it
B00YTCRN5A|1|Clutch broke after installation,  ended up having to buy another clutch and spending more money !!!
B00M1OUBES|5|Great product, could start a car instantly with it connected.
B00LXTKX9A|5|This totally changed how the transmission felt after I installed it. Before I put the e-Focus mount in, I was constantly irritated with the clunky transmission feel of the manual. Now the car drives great -- it's more &#34;planted&#34; to the road, and it doesn't bog out when launching from a stop. It's about the best upgrade you can buy for a normally aspirated manual transmission Mk3 Focus.
B00U8DH142|5|Well made, worth the money. Fits 1/2 28 perfectly.
B0051PKG2G|5|Quality looks good and it fits my car washing bucket perfectly. I bought this because I noticed I was getting very fine scratches in the clear coat of my Camry when looking at the paint with a critical eye. I think my wash mitt may have been picking up some of the fine grit that settles on the bottom of the wash bucket. I bought this and a soft Meguiar's wash mitt to help diminish future scratching.
B00ZS9RWZE|3|Nice design
B00M5F8C26|5|Excellent
B001CUNFGI|5|Saved money
B009HU7HSW|5|Perfect replacement
B0073XIAWC|5|It looks great on my car and it functions just like it should. Easy installation. Literally unscrew old antenna and screw in the new one.
B0008FUHWI|1|Extremely uncomfortable trying to mount any balls
B00M3B6AP8|5|Exact OEM replacement.  The master cylinder end was clearly labeled.  The length was perfect.  Extra crush washers were provided, which is a must and makes life much easier for the DIYer.<br /><br />Liked it so much that I ordered and installed rear brake line (along with new Galfer rear pads) for the same bike.<br />Will order a set of new lines and pads for the front brakes later.
B00CEX5C9K|5|Works well .
B00068XCQU|5|Accurately described with prompt shipment.
B00C54L684|2|Didn't work
B00AGK2BWE|5|Nice decals,they came fast it'd be nice if it came in gold!
B000IZ1CRM|5|Works, looks just like the original that it replaced!
B00IO94JKQ|5|Love them fit perfect on my Infiniti
B00OEOSEBK|3|Not actually aluminum as the advertisement says, rather a plastic sheet with metalic paint
B00T6IWFQE|5|There really really well made. Don't come with bar end screw and push rubber hardware. No biggie just use factory screws with these. There heavy like OEM just much better looking with that nice looking yoshi sign on a sticky end cap
B008427D88|5|Best Ones to buy
B00CD2RHTU|5|This was the first time buying on amazon and I couldn't be happier. Great experience.
B000U3BS9E|5|Easy to hook up. Easy to adjust. I drive a wrangler with the top down and doors off so this is a necessity. Works perfectly.
B000EDUUIA|3|I purchased this item awhile back and it has worked out great.  However, I don't know if the adhesive cannot take the daily push of an SUB, but the block keeps slowly pushing back.  Maybe this is designed for smaller cars, as my wife's Charger's block has not moved yet.
B0040CTYAQ|5|Arrived fast. Door trim clips/pins
B00WY7HRYY|5|Cute and well received!
B00NX8EYFI|5|Well made decal!
B001DRI5LA|5|Fit my 2010 Corolla S perfectly.
B0000AXRH5|4|nice small funnel that works well for my old 1987 Dodge truck..
B000EDUUIA|5|Saved my new car from a disaster in a tight garage; easy to install
B00IX2XF0O|5|I love how this looks in my car window. It is vinyl and I was able to stick it on inside the window, not on the exterior. I was even sent a second, smaller logo I put on my laptop. If you believe the Brotherhood is the last, best hope for the wasteland through technological superiority and responsibility, you need this.
B001GH5O9S|2|Product was good but missing parts.  Simple things like a washer and 2 bolts, bag was also open.  I would not buy from the same seller again.
B003G25RVG|4|Sloppy fit, but decent with liners.
B000CQBNMQ|2|Used this for a couple of months to store and measure diesel fuel additive.  The seam split on the bottom and leaked out the contents making a big mess.  It worked good before that but I expected better longevity out of this product.  Now I need to find another product that will hopefully be more reliable.
B0032W3KH8|3|just average screen inside  but still better than nothing
B00O6MBS3G|4|Slow delivery but nice product
B00BFE5JQK|4|OEM seal for half the dealer price. So far so good.... but these are a constant issue with 2004-2007 Nissan Titan, a poor design but there is no alternative. The axle seal/bearing design (really the whole rear end) was of poor design (under sized) from the get-go.<br /><br />Installed perfectly found OEM bearing and spacer on Amazon for good price as well.<br /><br />This was my first axle &#34;rebuild&#34; and it went well. Now that I have all the tools I will no longer get raped by my local dealer. It will be only about a 2 hour job for me next time.<br /><br />We will see how long this one lasts... my old one installed by the dealer lasted only 25K miles...
B00MFROCAK|5|Nice but too thin, I already two creases
B000N9LF98|5|amazing to find stainless for such a great price.
B009FPDGNY|5|Easy installation
B000B68C0S|5|Looks exactly like original.  Fit perfectly.
B00QIT7WHG|1|Did not like it. I put it on and the took it back off. The gauges were sticking with it on.
B000O824Y8|5|excellent product for price
B007HRMYLC|5|This system works great, I hook the clips to battery on Super Duty so pump doesn't drain fifth Wheel battery, Grinds Pumps works great.
B00QQWNH6K|5|Excellent quality
B00AYXM4DY|5|good item
B000C7XQFM|4|Item just as indicated.
B0087NAZM0|5|Have been using these for over 3 seasons - excellent product - clear with excellent noise (wind) cancellation - I use it with 2 full face helmets.
B001KOB6XU|4|Very very nice lever. Has a little give towards the other direction with a spring. Works awesome fit right on to my 05 Rm 125
B00BTL6FRG|3|A little dimmer than factory lighting but factory lighting was very hot and these are much cooler to touch.
B001SLEPB0|1|Sent it back
B00SK0ZYLM|5|Look and work great.  Just make sure ya get the right size unlike me.
B005N6XIKK|1|The size was ridiculous.  I usually wear an XL.  This didn't even fit my sister who is 4 sizes smaller than I am.  Total waste.
B007Z2PTFW|4|Works good.  I wish it went a little higher though.  I don't feel completely safe laying under the deck to change the blades.  I still use a backup jack.  It's very bulky...I wish there was a way to fold it down to fit in my shop better...very heavy to carry around too...I guess that's a plus.
B0041G1C0Q|5|I mounted these to the big brackets that came with my Bed X-Tender as the big brackets have two bolts through the box of the truck (instead of using the three screws that come with these. Work great, super quick and easy to remove the Bed X-Tender.
B0002YR6EW|5|as advirtised
B00HJ15AFS|1|It was mine but it didn't fit my place
B00SITDUI4|1|Extremely bad quality:  This mitt was completely torn opened after two ordinary washes.  I also own a MicroCareful Car Wash Mitt and a Chemical guys wash mitt.  The chemical guys is by far the best of all 3, and, I recommend it.  I'd stay away from the Yepal, however.
B002UQIQZ8|1|Does not work as intended. Leaves lines & scratches on windshield. I used invisible glass cleaner and this wand made my windshield worse! Had to take the car to car wash for them to clean it.
B001F212OK|4|works just as well on a 2013 HD FLHR and cost less then the HD parts.
B001TLC12E|2|These covers did not fit my 2014 Dodge Charger. The front seat covers didn't fit on the back of the actual seat and ripped during installation but fit ok on the bottom. The rear bench did not fit at all. It's a solid bench with a folding cup holder/armrest in the middle and the back rest cover didn't fit in the slightest. When I attempted to put the seat cover of the rear bench on, there were no holes for the seat belts and there was no way for me to get a snug fit on the seat. The material of these covers is nice and they do look good on the seats themselves but they just didn't fit my specific car at all. I just didn't do my research on these too much but make sure that they fit your car by going to their website. They only specify that they fit a handful of makes and Dodge isn't one of them. Don't make the same mistake I did.
B000E28COK|5|So far it does what a filter is supposed to do. Works great in my Suzuki savage ls 650!
B000TTEX8W|5|OEM for me, and the price was way better than the dealer.
B004K9FWNC|5|I Love the Pivoting design with the folding pivot blade that folds in the event of a tip over,Awesome performance.
B00ATTQEJI|5|good
B008INUXVM|5|Great Deal Fast shipping !!!!!!
B00V55N402|5|Good quality, works fine.
B000F0YMIG|5|nice quality, a bit pricey
B00NQDQS86|4|Product arrived OK but it was not the right size for my vehicle I have a CRV 2015 product that receiver for 2013 and 14did not fit my car,I need a return label says emailed to me
B000C808SE|4|for people with Nissan Frontier, Xterra and Phatfinder with the 4.0L motor. This goes in the Reservoir tank not in the Radiator. The radiator should have one that looks like this but does not have the pressure coil.
B00B8ADHS8|4|I love it and the price. I ordered it on Friday and got it Monday morning. Not a big deal for me but there was no directions or parts list. So if you don't know what you are doing this will be a bit of a challenge to assemble.
B002TWWEYW|4|Nice lights. Look good, relatively straight forward install. If you buy do yourself a favor and check the bezels on the lights before install. I have a broken one that I discovered after install. Kuryakyn says that it must have happened during install which I'm not buying. What I am buying is a new set of bezels (can't buy individually) for $40. Not happy about that but other than that I recommend.
B001S8CXJY|1|I have ordered three of these from the same company. This product is either defective or the batch made was defective. Either way...the three I received all had to be sent back. When the controls were put on cold...the unit blew hot. When the controls were put on hot the unit blew cold. Very disappointed that the brand is ACDelco. I expected better. However shipping the articles back were made easy through Amazon.
B000BXOFI4|5|Works great
B00ESQKKXO|1|This item sucks bad! It barely wants to idle and made no difference in anything.  The original one works way better.
B00T1H5M2E|5|Easy to open up. My wife can do it! It rolls up nicely when you don't want it closed. Its easy to close after you have opened it. It looks very nice!
B00B6SQH52|5|I used this to clean mine timberland boots, and it did a great job on it.
B00Z8MIHU0|1|Head gaskets didn't hold up even the initial crank before blowing oil everywhere. I had the heads refinished at a machine shop prior and torqued the new head bolt according to manufacturer's instructions. So, I went with FelPro head gaskets instead. THEY are WORKING!!!...
B00CGRX6RE|4|easy to use and works great.  I definitely feel a slight increase in power.
B0051XBNDY|5|This worked great and was shipped on time.
B003554TB8|5|excellent roof top carrier. very sturdy, waterproof and important to me that it is made in USA. traveled from NY to NC without difficulty. we have a roof rack, and used our own ratchet tie downs.  very pleased with this carrier.
B00MVMRS6O|5|way too bright... i never though they woulb be so bright, as far as durability, well i dont know yet
B0009VKLZ4|1|suggestion in Amazon ad was that this is good for cleaning whitewall tires. AVOID THAT .... it scratches off the whitewall
B009E9J5A4|5|I purchased two and they both work great!! Fast shipping also!
B000C846QO|5|exactly what I needed - thanks
B000C8PA50|5|Good fit and installed fairly easily.  The installation hassle was due to the design of the car, not the filter.
B00MJU79TO|5|The shipment arrived in excellent condition thank you
B00F66YW9S|5|A+
B00NF9C1WI|2|Got this for Christmas, Have not used it to jump start yet but have used air compressor maybe 5-6 times and it is broken already.
B004PNPN82|5|These are nice dishcloths. Nothing too fancy, but they get the job done and are holding up well.
B00A8136F2|4|Worked perfectly. Only problem is there is a lot of wind noise when nothing is on top of them.
B00EF3YOZ0|5|These look awesome! Easy to install!!
B00704FD6K|5|Exactly as described!
B0073WEZU4|2|almost all my stations don't come in clear, quick delivery and easy install gets it two stars but the fact that i can't use it bc i have to much static means its not worth it, plan to return
B00369EUCQ|1|did not work. waste of money
B009DK56ZM|5|Worked the first time and every time after that. Great news for a street mechanic!
B0000UZ514|5|Like it
B001O08ADO|5|I liked how it was shipped so fast and great quality until now. It may be the best if they were more like the regular size (perpendicular). Overall, good product. Helpful tip. Make sure to use a plastic back to cover protect it from scratching when installing it.
B000C7XQQ6|5|Temp sensor for a 2010 Nissan Sentra.  The original one never worked right from the day the car was new. The dealer wouldn't do any thing about it under warranty.  It totally failed at 60 thousand miles.  This sensor from Amazon works perfectly and is half the price of the dealer item.  It's also made in Japan.  It doesn't come with the bracket shown on the picture .
B001QUFZR6|4|Purchased for 1994 Camaro Z28. Came with cap.
B004B61B34|4|Good investment
B005N53C9I|4|These did not fit my 2013 Ford Edge, but thankfully they did fit my sisters Scion TC! They look awesome and are so comfy!
B00WM2I19G|4|Product is bright and installed easily.  I installed on an electric golf cart and it wasn't difficult.  Love it.
B00466V9AY|5|Awesome! Cheap!! works great!!!
B0081ZYPLG|5|Right product, well made, works perfectly and at the right price.
B002VZUU2A|5|Nice decal.
B004J6XNKK|5|Did exactly what I wanted them to do !!!
B00JFALCVW|3|Installation was easy. After installed I had windows up for recommended 72 hrs to warrant seal. However, while fitting perfectly for rear windows, the driver side and passenger side windows seemed too tightly fit. There is a bump noise when rolling windows down. I'm worried if that'd slowly deteriorate motors for the powered windows. Attached link for observed behavior: http://youtu.be/R83iRUBmtNQ
B00X3HT3GE|5|Nice price.  Made of rubber so no banging against the bike.  Seems to be durable.
B00NWRKWOW|5|Absolutely love it! Looks very good and quality is amazing
B003ZWC8AA|4|GOOD
B003E2WQE4|3|It took a while to arrive and it didn't have assembly instructions. It went together without any trouble and works well.
B00RES4EZI|2|I was looking for headlight bulbs for my 15' Yamaha R3 to make the lights up front more uniform and white. My choices were between these and LED bulbs. I went with these because they were $60 cheaper and all the reviews said they were bright and white. They are a little brighter then the stock bulbs but they are the exact same color as stock. So instead of having a nice white, uniform look, I still have piss yellow looking headlights after spending $40. I guess I'll be using them for awhile until I burn out the bulbs.  The picture I added has the stock bulb on left and this bulb in the right
B00PP6C01G|5|Fits just right.
B000BPTUB4|4|They were ok I just didn't measure well an they were too short
B003Y92RUU|5|Nice improvement over the stock mirrors on my Victory and the price was more than reasonable.
B00N6D7K38|5|These are great looking bulbs but more for show than anything. The light is not enough to be used for driving at night. You will need something with more of a beam pattern then a flood.
B00EEKEYDQ|5|OEM martch
B001DRNNOE|5|Change my filter on 4 vehicles once a year for emissions test. Priced right, never a problem with using this brand.
B000MNN4WQ|5|Works just as it should.
B005ZRZPN0|5|Arrived quickly and fit perfectly.
B00M78820I|5|I have received it and used it every day last week! It is the first car shade I've ever bought and it made a significant difference in the temperature of my car in the Texas heat.
B0058FET8G|2|The handlebars were not anodized black, but painted black, which required taping and sanding for the controls and grips to fit.
B000N9TAEK|5|Excellent, simple, works
B007Q2PONS|5|Exactly what I was wanting for my car.
B00SXH866C|2|A royal pain to get on an IS17 helmet. Felt like I would ruin the rubber around the rim trying to get it in. And wouldn't be happy messing up a new helmet for this cheap accessory. Haven't noticed a big change in wind since it is mesh but at least it'll keep bugs out.
B000CIM3GO|5|Very good.
B0007TV6M0|5|ok
B00M09A888|4|I've changed my original review, at first i wasn't impressed. But I was stupid and totally didn't realize I was using my internal sunvisor out of habit. This pinlock shield does do as it states. Very hard to fog up. Be very careful cleaning. Scratches very, very easily.
B00C0X2D8M|5|works exactly as intended.  thick quality material.  Nice to be free of manufacturer markings.  Don't feel like advertising for some aftermarket shop.
B003TOKZ22|3|This could be improved is if it didn't cover up the year sticker for the tags.  Then I wouldn't have to completely remove it to replace my tags. Otherwise it looks good and I'm satisfied.
B000P70V3E|4|You need to buy an extra tube of hardner for each can of glazing putty. Mixes easily.
B000E24APU|4|Did the job. Took patience, time and a bit of an artist's eye, but I managed to make an eyesore much better, but not disappear. You may have to try it a second time to get it right but with patience .... it works.
B00267SQVK|2|This purchase was made two weeks before a road trip. We loaded it with already ice cold water and turned it on just to see how it would work. The humming wasn't bad if the TV was loud enough and the converter from 110v to 12v got so hot we shut it down for fear of a fire. That was in our living room. In the car on the road trip, we used the 12v cord that came with it and again, loaded it with ice cold water and Gatorade. It did keep the water cold but ran constantly throughout our trip. I would say that in a pinch, this product will work but don't expect it to cool anything from scratch.
B00GBOMUV6|2|feel cheap. fitment is not that great. will return soon
B000BPTUB4|4|Worked fine, would of been nice to include some steel washers to go over the rubber ones.
B007EHOWNI|5|Great product worked well easy to install
B00A14QREI|1|Same thing the part did not fit so Amazon gave me credit for the part once I sent it back.
B00H7HD9DO|1|It does not fit my car and it is nothing like the description
B00KTIMIFS|1|Poor quality. It initially worked for about two weeks but then it just malfunctioned. Very thin outer shell. When I would attempt to open just the driver's side door it would open the door on the opposite side (front, passenger) or just the rear doors would open. Sometimes none of the doors would lock/unlock at all. That's what I get for being cheap. I was trying to save money...you get what you pay for. I had it programmed at my car dealership and they did advise me...that the key fobs purchased online tend to malfunction.
B000JZIW6U|5|oem what more could I say
B00DKWJ9VG|4|Very good so far had to trim to fit, don't know if it will last folding it up each day
B000F192T4|3|Looked good but I couldn't exchange it because I thought it was the wrong one. But I ran over the time limit for return bummer.
B001F22FDC|5|GOOD
B00O83NY80|4|Love the lights....it gives my Tahoe a different look from the rear. Only reason i didn't give it a five star, because i thought the light cover was tinted more. But love the new lights.
B00H36XX6C|2|Revised...took this on the road with me. First charge, 68% of my Samsung Note 4. The battery was not completely empty to begin. Next two attempts, about a 40% charge. Now, the red light stays on and the unit never recharges.<br />Wow, this a terrific device for me. I travel weekly and carry a backup charger and a flashlight in my brief case. So, two become one. The flashlight puts out a strong beam. I haven't tested it for light on time. But I am very pleased with the strength and focus of the beam. I have used the battery to charge a bluetooth headset and my Samsung Note 4 when the phone is at 50% power. I will revise this review with time, but I am very happy with this battery pack.
B00VZOHVSE|4|Function as they should, no contact issues thus far
B002DOME64|4|Does the job it was designed to do. Gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because the straps that arrived with the cradles were stiff and difficult to attach/fasten.  Fortunately, I had ordered extra straps for my Softride bike rack and was able to use those with the cradles.
B00MANSZCA|5|The plate is just as described....metal!!!
B00BT8PUD4|5|Install these for I don't like the blue flint from the 6000K and loving it.
B006QLN9F0|5|I put this on my friend's Toyota so he could have a taste of what its like to be an American.
B0019MSJ6A|5|Very nice seat covers, worth the money, love the color
B004I0XJUG|5|Had to replace both sides headlight assemblies due to Toyota's making the running lights too hot and melting the plastic lenses. Found that most instructions for use on internet way too complicated.  Took me only a couple hours to do both sides.
B00AN5RX70|5|Pretty fast, good quality and easy to install!...thx
B0001L0DFA|2|Weak flow and spray pattern changes itself from a broken spray to stream and damages plants!  Will not buy these again.
B00JSAQFCU|5|Keeps the beer cold!
B0016GRTVU|5|I have not use this but my husband has and since I haven't heard him yelling and cursing at it , then it must be really good!! Does the job and reaches across the SUV!
B00XO0NV2C|4|stickers look great
B003YJI55Q|5|I kept losing these, every year buying more and more.....these units are different, they don't press on, they rotate and lock on to the lugs......they seem to work fine..........have not popped of yet..........(for about years travel).
B00WT68KB4|1|A buddy bought one for his race car. It worked great 3 times. On the fourth try it just clicked and would not start motor. Solenoid got extremely hot. Cannot find replacement parts, or contact info for Demotor Inc. Wasted money, plus we missed the race
B003TPOU2W|5|Bought for show car, feel better should the unthinkable fire were to happen.Great fire extinguisher!
B00FE0FNYY|5|got what I paid 4 good price @ quality
B00KZJQ2L2|5|awesome shade for my full size truck! absolutely no complaints. will buy from again
B00J4Z82PW|5|good
B009VYK0R4|3|Light was bright and sharp after charging.  When using the light it seemed the staying power was not the best.  The light began losing power after about 8 minutes and the reduction was notable.  It did recharge well but I guess I expected a longer charge.  Since I do not use the loght often it is hard to find fault with the item.  L Jones
B000EGZ5FK|5|Funnel came in orange color.
B002PQJ9H2|5|Fast shipping, nicely packahed, and a Great price
B004A6OBHI|4|Fit on my 2004 Saturn Vue Manual transmission AWD
B00I2I104C|5|The license plate light and some light are much brighter than the factory bulbs my Jeep used to have. I ended up using only one dome light and one license plate light, they gave a map light as well, but my 2007 Wrangler doesn't have any map lights.
B00L9L44E2|5|Brings out the color of  the  car /tan
B009Y7EE9I|5|Awesome light kit. Very easy install.
B002L4JHF2|5|Great thanks
B00KB08R7M|1|I looked up this chain be application on your site. chain arrived 3 days later. When I went to install the chain it was about 5 inches to short.<br />Its caused me to miss a very important ride. I ordered a new chain from a local Yamaha dealer.
B00BN5XV0M|5|For $60 this about the best you can get for a full faced motorcycle helmet.  Fits nice, and is comfortable after hours of use.  I can't notice any whistling and the helmet seems pretty aerodynamic to me even when going fast.  Nothing bad to say about it.
B000CQHUJ6|3|Did not fit my 2000 Toyota Solara  Camry, even though it said perfect match before buying, it's too small i couldn't use it. but it looks of good quality,
B00HTOB0NG|4|My lights would not turn on at all, plugged this in and it did the trick, downside is that they cutoff sometimes when I'm driving and I have to play with them to get them to come back on
B009KBUUL4|4|I love it, looks really nice on my car
B000M8RYMC|5|Great product for older manual transmissions
B007VRDEMQ|5|Exactly as is

B006N9775I|5|Everything included to replace the sway bar links on my 1968 mustang. typical install. very satisfied.
B00125ZMD2|5|Item as described.
B003UPVRMM|3|Although this product was list for the 2004 Toyota Matrix, the retainers were too small.  The one listed is for a 7mm hole and the actual vehicle has 9mm holes.
B0046ID5EK|5|It does wat it says it does no BS it literally took bout a min 2 min max
B005X4QCAA|5|great product!
B00A41T98O|2|Light don't light up the outside lights as intended, and the fix advertised is bogus.
B001QN7ED6|5|Very good.  No problems
B007GCEKLU|5|Easy to connect. works really well! I would recommend to a friend or family member.
B0044Z8DJW|5|The best battery that I've bought for the money....I have a RENOGY 100 watt solar panel connected to it and it took from 55% to 100% in about 7.5 hours in full sun. Please keep in mind that I only have 100 watt panel; if I had more it will charge in less time.....all in all this battery is the best when it comes to my needs.
B000QUXYWU|5|Perfect fit
B00BFDJ72S|5|Fits the washer bottle on my '09 Honda Fit just fine. It is an original mfr replacement part in a Honda bag
B00CWRDQEQ|5|Price is great and it works as its is intended to. Enough said!
B00ASB0CBI|5|Scares zombies. Not seen any at all .
B000BZG4Z4|5|Item exactly as described.  Works perfectly on my old Chevy inline six cylinder engine.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Very Good
B00BUSIKQ2|5|These fit my 2014 jeep grand cherokee limited like a glove. It's true about the back passenger may not fitting all the way under the front seats.
B00GSAUHB8|5|It has been wonderful to have all summer.
B0019FM05I|5|I haven't had to use them yet.  I have tried them on and they fit great.
B00COYNVLA|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B010LEVC1A|5|When I arrive at my campsite and after using the jack, I slip this on to keep out the sand and dirt.  If you're going to spend the money on an electric jack, then protect it for small money.
B005AUAOLU|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B0012WW3WS|5|Amazing product for half the price you'll find at your favorite auto retailer
B00KG14LBM|3|Its pretty good. Weather Proof.
B00CHDE3K6|1|The mirror I ordered did not fit. CarPartsDepot made it difficult to attempt to get the correct size.  I kept the mirror because it was going to cost almost as much as the item originally cost to return it. I would never recommend this company!
B00CS7ET9Q|5|Great quality sticker.
B00DPWSEAI|5|Item shipped was an OEM replacement part for my 2014 Ford F250. Arrived in good condition before quoted arrival date. Cits and looks just like the original part.
B007P4UWGQ|5|I love my key chain I just purchased a new 2015 Jeep Patriot . Now I'm completed . Thank you !
B00U9YYLE8|5|What they advertised. Went on easily.
B0011NMVLG|4|Item was as described.  No issues great fit.
B000EDUTOU|5|Works great, easy to install
B008032QKG|4|yes it was good  and i will order from again thanks
B004SFKJIQ|5|Wonderful to have on hand for little ones.
B00R248W1G|5|I am a former Police officer and display this proudly on my vehicle.
B002300KM8|4|Just the thing for easy access to more important things in my Box Top
B00796UQHA|5|Easy to install. Haven't noticed any loss of signal vs my factory antena.
B000EDUTR2|5|Plastic Caps fits snugly in RV Bumper, which is a good thing,,,some don't, and gets lost easily. We'll see how these hold up in time!
B00V97KY90|5|Great deal perfect match to original
B00LP7RJ4W|5|Looks great on car.
B0023VL0N0|5|Very good
B005OOGUQK|5|Looks good and not too heavy. After a little use the visor rattles a little. Other than that it's great
B00EJ6V35W|5|Awesome
B000CGKP02|5|works
B001H1OFZM|5|OEM Part... Great deal
B00K3GBRQ2|1|Really bright, FAILED IN MERE MINUTES. Would give ZERO stars if that was an option. All (4) of the ones I bought - purchased for 2 different vehicles....all worked (like I said, VERY Bright) and all failed less than 3 minutes of use. Needless to say they are being returned and I don't think I'll be getting the same brand/model to replace them. I hate it too - because if they lasted I was going to write a super positive review.<br /><br />FWIW - they were all HOT to the touch, and being familiar with the technology - they shouldn't be - LEDs inherently should run MUCH COOLER than their incandescent counterparts....something is wrong in the design of these things.
B00O4KRO5Q|3|Nice helmet under 200 bucks.  Comfortable, the vents work great.  However the tab to lower the internal sub visor broke off.
B00KUL73DG|5|It is what it is, a filter. It is exactly like the stock one.
B00DB8HL0A|5|Fit awesome
B00GSAUHB8|5|I love how convenient this is! It comes in a small storage bag. I like how it's different than most other shades because it's one large piece instead of two separate parts. It's easily collapsible. Love the bonus gift of the no slip pad. I no longer lose my phone when driving
B00427MIFC|5|Fit perfect in my 2002 Audi A4 Quattro 1.8L Thank You..
B000CFKS9Q|1|Site say's it is a fit for my 64 Chevrolet Corvair starter motor, however, the starter gear assembly (bendix) is not. Assembly is to short. Noticed after assembling starter that drive would not function properly when engaging with ring gear. Be aware that this kit IS NOT  a fit for 61-69 Corvair starter motors. Other parts in the kit like bushings, brushes, and washers worked fine. Disappointed, but not worth my time to go through the hassle of a return.
B000C5WF4W|5|excellent product
B008CF9P2Y|3|Kind of &#34;cheap&#34; for the price:  The bumper arrived in good shape (not very quickly though).  We paid our auto shop to put it on.  They didn't mention having any trouble with instillation, however, upon inspection we noticed that where the plastic (cheap plastic) part of the edge of the bumper aligns with the metal part of the bumper wasn't attached.  It appears that there is a hole there on both the metal and plastic, and the plastic hole fasteners were missing, so the plastic cover was flapping.  We went to an auto store and bought some hole fasteners, (87 cent fix) so no big deal, but the holes didn't align on one side of the bumper making it extremely difficult to get the plastic hole bumper fasteners attached.  Like we said:  kind of &#34;cheaply made&#34;.
B00U7XT1C8|4|It works as advertised, clips on easily.  Visors with integrated mirror have some limitations as to positioning, but wasn't a problem on our CR-V.  Bag hooks are a nice add-on.
B000MCXOYK|5|Just exactly what I was looking for.  Can't find in stores.
B004CQIJLK|1|Nothing more than a piece of material with elastic around it.  Not worth the money; easy to sew one myself.
B00180ITBI|4|Fit fine but not listed in the description that it includes the both needed exhaust gaskets.<br /><br />Bosal 256-025 Exhaust Gasket<br />Bosal 256-036 Exhaust Gasket
B00GIBEZB0|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00H8PC7DI|3|horn are a little crooked
B000GZPCYI|5|The Motion Pro Fork Oil Level tool was just what I needed when changing the Fork Oil and springs in my 2014 Iron 883's forks.  This tool made it a breeze to get the proper amount of oil in the forks.  I don't think I could have performed the install without this much needed tool.
B000C7XU2G|5|Have installed and it fit and works great.
B0000AX0YV|1|Not all of the parts were in the box- returned the item
B007GMHTQ8|1|Assembly was straightforward and install was easy enough, but I can already see puffing in the powder coat and there are rust streaks coming from every perforation. I installed it 3 weeks ago.  Not impressed.
B0013LBU2C|5|Put on the back of my wife's '09 Yamaha V-Star 250. It fit perfectly and really looks like it belongs on the bike. I was surprised at how large it was. We could have actually gotten buy with one 20-30% smaller. The rigid plastic liner helps to keep the shape of the bag so it always looks good. My wife is happy to have someplace to keep her water, purse, or goodies that she buys on the way.
B00YB5GAEA|4|Likes: Tool-less installation that allows it to be moved easily and quickly from bike to bike. Ability to recharge via USB cord (same mini USB plug used by most phones and many other devices). Seemingly sturdy construction. (Disclaimer: Have yet to test the sturdiness factor). Reasonable price.  Dislikes: Can't see any difference in brightness between the low and high settings. However, I always run my taillight on the blinking setting for better visibility, so the other settings aren't a big deal.  Update: My light recently popped off the rubber strap and disappeared while transporting the bike on a car carrier, leaving the strap connected to the seat post. Definitely a poor design feature. I'll be replacing the light with something else.
B003CJCPNG|5|This item was shipped quickly and works great
B001NI7KE2|5|Does what it is supposed to do .. holds may clothese, does not bend and eliminates multiple suitcases for a trip.
B004RCXBYO|5|was a quick and easy patch to seal a seam in my slide out roof
B0024E6ZW2|5|Ordered Saturday morning and it arrived Sunday morning - FAST shipping! I immediately went out and put under my tent trailer step, works great. No more blocks of wood for the step, the blocks of wood worked but this gives much better adjustability. Height is perfect for my application, but if you had a toy hauler or something that rides higher I would just add a block of wood underneath. I will be adding a rubber pad to the top to get a non-slip contact between the step and top metal pad. Should avoid any chatter that way too.
B003HFBQC6|5|What can I say they are pieces of wire, how could this go wrong.
B011SJIL8Y|5|These really are amazing  - reminds me of cool water by Davidoff
B0002SRH7O|5|Great value for a 5-piece kit.  The pieces that I did use worked flawlessly.  Great decision to purchase this kit.
B00404ZDAO|4|Awesome little keychain. My daughter loved it.
B001O1IY4I|5|Fit my Fit perfectly!
B004K6N8W2|5|This product came in a reasonable amount of time and in good shape. It does not look exactly like the factory blower and even has a slightly smaller blower fan. It fit in perfectly and runs great! Don't be afraid of the low price, I compared the original factory unit to this replacement, side by side, and did not see cheap junk. Due to the fact that the factory blower lasted almost 13 years I'm sure this replacement will go to the grave with my truck. Five out of five stars.
B004BE2CO8|5|Works very well
B00FWNGRSY|5|Fit great, feel great, look great! I love them!
B002R4WPDC|5|True to size and comfortable.
B009XRQM1W|5|fits right where I needed it, the decal went on nice and smooth. it looks great
B000CD6GLM|2|nice beam blade wiper - the only reason I give it only 2 stars is that they tend to leave a streak in the return motion only - I thoroughly cleaned my windshield before installing these wipers so they would wipe smoothly. Been on the car a while now and there has been no change.
B00FRHOMNM|4|My application, a Chevy Silverado uses some unnatural method of attaching the blades. I have worked on cars my entire life, and I cannot understand why this is used. The good news is that this has the parts to fit the vehicle and with a bit of figuring it out, they fit. All wipers work well when new, it is time that you can tell. But these blades were far cheaper than dealer replacements.
B0051TPJKG|5|good to have and not have to use!!
B006N9DCSE|3|It's ok
B00NLMDWRW|4|Works good
B00662CAV8|5|This was just enough to do both doors and the extended cab behind the doors on each side. Still holding up great and no problems to date.
B007JSGR9Y|1|This doesn't deserve a star. Don't waste your energy or money! This thing belongs in the rubbish bin. No matter how many times I plugged this thing in, it would not work! Nothing, not even a flicker on the screen! And speaking of the screen... the face place was warped and fell off! It's only attached by a bit of adhesive tape. I was so disappointed and felt totally cheated.
B000C9QJLI|5|Worked great for my 1997 Chevrolet Silverado K1500.  I used a small screwdriver to breakoff the mounting plate on each of both the existing driver's and passenger side switches since both were bad on my truck.  On the driver's side I then pushed the switch body back through the dash and was able to grab while reaching up under the dash.  I removed the electrical connector from the back of the defective switch and then pushed the plug back through the hole in the dash.  Connected the new switch to the plug and then snapped the new switch into place.  For the passenger side, I removed the defrost vent in the side of the dash which is close to the switch mounting hole.  I used a stiff wire to snag the wires going to the original switch and used them to pull the switch through the vent hole.  I removed the connector from the old switch and then carefully pushed the connector back through the switch mounting hole in the dash, connected it to the new switch and snapped the new switch into place and then snapped the defrost vent cover back into place.  This was easier for me that removing the glove box.
B002UC1AYQ|5|Perfect for the job and it was easy to install. It came with everything I needed to repair my RV toilet.
B00V9DZ58O|2|was to large
B0049E54G8|5|Great quality exact fit..!
B007CLLH48|5|Took 10 minutes to remove old mirror and install this one. Works perfectly. Rattled a bit but I just tightened it up and added the old insulation.
B000BGM240|5|I installed it on my popup camper. It was perfect. It was real easy to install. I do recommend go to a camper store and getting the RV caulk to seal around it.
B002LYQALQ|5|just what it saye works good.
B00HTP8N0I|3|They are not as heavy duty as some so I am using them as spares.
B00BVB4T3Q|1|It was damanged
B007I785C8|5|Everything was greatly done. Thank you.
B00FWD83RW|5|All good
B000CIZZQO|5|love it
B000N5JRI8|4|Arrived quickly. Package had rips and holes. No damage to equipment. Easy installation. Perfect &#34;non rice rocket&#34; can sound.
B007VRCA62|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B004ZF3KA8|4|Great product! The instructions were a little vague, but I watched a couple of YouTube videos and figured it out.  Nice bright white light, just what I was hoping for, and at a great price!
B00ABYVT64|5|These work great when you buy their, or any other companies product when it is liquid or slightly thick.
B005AZK564|5|S  good
B00LFL78N0|5|Price is amazing! ! Product has been performing perfect
B004ZBD69M|5|workd pefrect
B000BGOCPM|5|fits an works as it should
B0002JMEXU|5|THIS TOOL WORKS GREAT . I DO A LOT OF AUTO A/C . I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN .
B001UE93BW|5|Looking to re-plum your damaged tranny lines, then look no further than AC Delco originals from Amazon, great price and excellent fit. These are the same as the rusty factory lines that are now leaking and need replacing. Save yourself the headache of trying to repair and just buy the inexpensive originals. Pick-up a pack of dorman retaining clips since these lines do not include new retaining clips. Thanks ACDelco and Amazon!
B00IKQ25MM|5|perfect fit exactly what I ordered
B004E23FL6|5|OEM part, not some of the huge chinese emblems you'll see for less. I wouldn't powerwash the painted part, but it should hold up for a hand washed car.
B00YNJA8EW|5|Its a nice a. Just what we wanted.
B00PQWN5DQ|5|I ordered two JACO Superior Deluxe Tire Pressure gauges. One worked fine. The second would not hold air pressure dial indication after removing from the tire valve. I found using liquid soap that the leak was from around the clear plastic cover to the body. I used JB weld to fix it. Do't know how long that will last and the plastic cover doesn't fit well now. But it works!<br /><br />I then received an email from Nolan Jacoby at Jaco Superior company asking about how I liked the product. I emailed him back the above information and he sent me a new one in the mail free of charge. I must admit that I was surprised by the great service of this company and Nolan himself on a relatively low cost item. I wish him great success.<br /><br /> So many of these gauges are inaccurate and poorly made. I cross checked all three gauges this morning and they were in one half pound of each other. As an RVer and owning multiple older cars Tire Pressure is a critical thing to check and these gauges should last years. The swiveling chuck that attaches to the tire valve is a handy feature. They are easy to read and compact to store.
B0082ACB8E|2|This is a discount cover at a discount price. Spend a few more bucks and get something better quality. If you really need to read why... keep reading.<br />I figured I'd save a few bucks and go with this one because the price seemed great and the reviews weren't bad.<br />While it's true, the cover comes pre-assembled and installs very easily, the fit on my 2015 Ram Sport (5'7&#34; Non-Rambox Bed) was less than acceptable.<br />1. The cover clamps aren't deep enough to reach past the plastic Ram Sport top caps to clamp onto the actual metal underside of the bed. This means that the clamps try to push the plastic caps up and away from the bed and never really get tight to the actual bed. I circumvented the issue by putting some small wood spacers inside the bed lip to allow the clamps to tightly clamp onto the bed. (You could also cut notches into the bed caps with a hacksaw... but really?)  The wood seemed to help a little until I found issue #2...<br />2. The aluminum crossbars connecting the driver and passenger side end about 10&#34; from the rail side, and turn into plastic. This becomes a problem especially at the front of the bed near the cab. The covers frame never clamps down tight to the front corners. Sure you can put a wood spacer under the bed rail so the clamp doesn't bottom out (The threads aren't really long enough to get all the way down) but this results in the plastic portion of the cross rails flexing down to form a &#34;U&#34; shape where the clamp is anchored to the cover. That means that at highway speeds the front corners of the cover have &#34;flex&#34; and waive at you in your side view mirrors revealing up to a 1/2&#34; gap. Kinda scary when you are passing someone on the highway wondering if the cover is going to &#34;Un-install&#34; itself onto their windshield.<br />3. The clamps themselves want to murder the cover when folding it up. The plastic clamps are mounted onto metal threaded rod that if not properly folded (and watched with anuntrusting eye) try to impale the cover as the final fold toward the cab is accomplished. I can only imagine trying to load something in the back of the truck in a hurry (say in the winter, or a rainstorm) and realizing that I have some cool new piercings punched through the vinyl when I fold the cover back out.<br /><br />This was not my first tonno cover, and the last one I had lasted 140,000 miles through 8 New England winters. It was a pain in the winter but at least the design of the frame and clamps made sense.
B00KTHYCEO|5|works great
B00BRHM8FA|5|Completely changed the way my 2015 wrangler JK drives with its 33s. LOVE this little device. It improved my MPG as well. The great thing about this is that you can upgrade the software in it to that of the FlashPaq for just $90. I thought that was very reasonable when compering it to the price of the FlashPaq.
B00ICR1UB6|5|So far i have been very pleased. A nice bonus is that it does not affect data transmission, so I was able to monitor current and voltage while transferring files to the device. Even the iPhone hasn't complained about it.
B00M20YQNI|5|wonderful - the magnet sticks strongly to the exterior of my car, but it also can be repositioned easily, if needed.  Dark navy blue color background.
B00139WO9C|5|Has gotten me out of a few sticky situations. Really glad I bought!
B000CRO4IK|5|Works great, very convenient.
B00HYTQGAI|5|Just as advertised. A nice clear, white light
B002P31PW2|5|Works very well for my application in my mini house.
B00NM8SYWS|1|not a car alarm
B00KPWB1KQ|5|Extremely happy with the look, quality, performance and price of the Tyger Step Armor that I bought for my 1988 YJ Jeep.<br />Mounting did required drilling and bolting to the frame which was no problem. The fit was perfect.<br />Larry
B00ARBBO5W|1|I ordered two stickers, bother were inside their own clear bag, then shipped from China to USA inside a grey plastic bag. Bother stickers arrived flat, thus putting bend marks in them, now they won't stick to my vehicles. With them flat, it also peeled some of the backing off. One has a weird line down the front and the other has amfoot print on the back.
B00Q7MT6FU|5|slides on easy thightens down nice lines up well. Sounds a little like a four wheeler with the baffle in but take the baffle out and it sounds great on my 250. Also looks good as you can see from my pic a lot better than the stock pipe.
B000M5Y720|5|Very nice.
B001V5LLU6|5|just what we were looking for
B00K61CG5U|5|I'm so happy about this lights ,will buy them 4 all my cars.
B00MNT82HO|5|fits an works great
B00UZE88Z0|1|I liked CWS102 and thought this product would be even better.  Huge disappointment!  Everything that CWS102 does good, CWS808 fails to live up to.  Would not recommend.
B002JLV9Y4|3|Cute vinyl~!
B000C02WU4|5|been on my car over a year still working
B00AQ29EOA|4|They look very nice. Replaced metal ones because one was lost and couldn't find a replacement for it. Hope the plastic holds up.
B001EOV3JS|5|Installation was very straightforward and quick. I do recommend having some extra plastic wire ties to secure the wiring to the under frame. The absolute best way to secure the wires would be to get a piece of the split plastic conduit and run the wires underneath the back of the truck through it. I didn't have any so I just used extra ties.
B006QC36K2|5|met expectations at a lower than dealership price, genuine oem part
B004R7R1BI|1|The application was a fail...directions were clear but I still had trouble.  Great idea and message, too bad I couldnt get it applied.
B00HOMRLRM|5|Great
B00X11N2QO|5|Fits & wears well
B005FUUBZO|5|awesome lights
B00230PCD0|5|Always a quality product from UFO
B00OTDO3GG|2|Did not fit my 2011 BMW 335i
B00QWNTLHC|5|Very good replacement part and performed well.
B00GPWV7BS|5|Love it... it looks great!
B00U9YRSHA|2|Plastic fitting to put a shift nob is not a good idea if it's lose fitting
B00NB808P0|1|Junk
B00NCTS7P6|5|Long wait but very satisfied with this very attractive and well fitting Iphone case.
B002IBXYT8|5|For starters it fit. 2nd it works. Good job Amazon on getting the match right for my Nissan Xterra. Everything meets or exceeds the quality of the original including the plastic tank & cap which is where I have come to expect short cuts. Hopefully this one lasts 150K like the original.
B00IUGFZE2|4|It is a little much to expect an additive to clean out the diesel fuel injectors. The additive is changing things but it is a slow fix and requires much driving around. Truck runs great but still smokes at idle, a little or a lot depending. Too soon for a complete fix. Another month???
B00JKE84X2|1|Right out of the box, it didn't work! Waste of money!
B00A23V5EU|5|Received part as described. I'm not a mechanic, and I was able to  installed it in 20 minutes.
B000RTSS6C|5|Excelent product
B00AM1SAVI|5|These window visors fit perfectly and are a great help to the car. The shipment was on time and hassle free. Thank You, John
B0073Q48TI|4|Cool little mirrors. Very versatile mounting system.
B002DW256A|5|Perfect!
B00KFPDY1M|2|I bought this for my 2012 Lacrosse to have more light in my truck. The existing bulb was a 194 and was in a sideways mount with no reflector so only about a third of the light from the bulb was being directed inside the truck.  I bought this figuring it will fit in my fixture and all the LED's firing into the truck should give me much more light.  Well I was wrong, first the base of the LED was a little to big and then when it steps up to the wider area it was too wide to fit in the fixture.  After some modification to my fixture (bending it with pliers) I was able to fit it in. Now as to the light output it was a much whiter light than the 194 bulb but was barely any brighter then I had before I switched it out, even with all the LED's directing the light into the trunk area. So if your looking for more light with this type of design look for a different LED, I ended up buying a different one and it lit up my trunk just like I wanted.
B000KL4XT8|5|Worked great for my 2004 honda radio
B007KACXU8|5|Best textile jacket I ever had. The rain proof liner is a huge deal for me due to my many travels.
B004AH6PKI|5|These work Perfect
B005UO6EWE|5|Good stuff and cleared my injector problems
B00R1J66JM|5|Worked great.  Fast shipping.  No regrets.
B003V3RVWI|4|Griot does a good job of cleaning the car.  Just spray and wipe. The only  draw back was the sprayer, it spattered or shot out in a stream, had to buy a new spray bottle.  Griot should give decals with their products so others know we are not wasting water washing our cars during the drought.
B006QH6XQG|5|Already had this type battery in my truck.  I like the way it performs.  The sealed technology means you do not have to worry with the problem of corrosion.
B007JIO38G|5|Arrived in 2 days in padded envelope. Eight years of paint chips and scratches were covered up in a couple hours. The results were better than I expected and I recommend this product and seller highly. The paint matches the original factory color precisely.
B000GV7ULU|4|Direct fit easy to install quad runs great with it just wish it was not so noisy
B005ZH10O8|5|I used to use Astro Shield and was disappointed when it was no longer available.  Wizards Shine Master was recommended and I like it as well as, ore maybe better than, Astro Shield.  It goes on easily, gives the paint a glossy shine, and lasts a long time in the Florida sun.  Great stuff.
B00F0BSJVG|5|Item exactly as described.
B0006Z9SPW|5|Great price, Great product
B00KXNX3TE|1|may work well form other colors, but the pearl white did not match well at all!
B007IVCGJW|5|Item was as described.
B00UFERZKO|1|Caution! this item does not have any input circuit protection! I hooked it up to my trailer battery, which was also connected to the tow vehicle alternator for battery charging, and the input circuitry was fried . . with NO output connected!!
B000CDADFM|3|Holds up well but nothing special in my eyes.
B00BG4F30Q|1|The brass threaded sleeve inside the ball seems to be loose it rattles like crazy and is very loud and annoying
B00MXZYU7O|5|Great!  Just what I needed.  Received item in timely manner.  Thank you.
B00C1JZXOG|5|The air cond blower assembly in our 2004 Jeep Wrangler had been cranking out an annoying shrill ring almost constantly when running the air conditioner. We ordered the above new blower assembly piece and my husband said it was a breeze to install.  Unlatch the door to the heater/air conditioner motor housing, unplug the electrical wires to the old blower piece, turn the old blower piece about an inch to the left and remove; then you're ready to install the new blower piece.  Just reverse the above instructions and presto!!! No more whining blower motor sounds when we're enjoying that cool air here in our Florida heat!
B002PCBX5M|5|works great! easy to install.
B00L7XFUSQ|3|They look great, but the adjustment screws that are built into them are cheap. One of them broke while installing, and I can't adjust the headlight beam.
B0001MQ7E0|5|Work just as we expected!
B00KAMIOH4|1|Very disappointed.  The set looks nice but none of the original bulbs fit.  Some of the spade connectors fit loose.  The turn signals keep blowing fuses.  Still no high beams.  I went out and bought new bulbs that will presumably fit but I'm going to have to take the bumper off to remove the assemblies to get the bulbs in. Maybe I can do something with the turn signals when I have it all apart. If it works better later I will edit my review.  The headlights do look nice.  If only they worked.
B004BCJ8HE|3|The price is very right with bulbs included but please be aware that these are very cheaply made. The mechanisms used to adjust the headlamp assy (two per side) are VERY flimsy. I don't really see long term use from these. With vibration and bumps from road surfaces I predict failure of these adjusters but I can't say how long they would last. Be very careful with installation, as the adjusters will pop apart if you sneeze at them, and you may get many years out of them, then again you might not. I'd probably buy them again though, even knowing what I know now as prices are really high elsewhere.
B00L7X8QA0|5|vvery pleased
B004DVCQ72|5|Very good quality brake drums for the money over stock Toyota. They've been performing perfectly for a few weeks now without any warping issues. A very recommended brake product from Beck Arnley!
B00QNQOVC8|5|This hammock is seriously high quality. I have layed in friend's hammocks that were 60 dollars or more and this hammock is just as comfortable and lightweight. Although the ropes it comes with can be a little short and slide down trees that have little bark, they do come in handy and are lightweight. Overall, this hammock is a great deal for the money.
B008DHXGWG|5|Love these cute voodoo dolls! They look awsome with my backpack!!!!!
B000KKLLFS|5|I noticed I was missing a cap on one of my tires, so I bought this just to cover up. They fit just like any other, nothing special about these caps, but they get the job done!
B00Z7KIZPA|4|comes in handy
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Super bright
B00PXZ919I|5|Great product, professional results. I took a chance on this random orbital buffer over the Griot's and other brands and am very happy with my choice.
B003061JDS|5|Nice product
B000C8NTXK|5|ok
B00G52FDSQ|5|Fit perfect
B00QRVJ7XM|2|I originally place my order and waited 3 weeks for it to arrive. I finally contacted Amazon to find the order hadn't really been processed.  I was looking at a screen that said delivered, but never received the item.  Amazon corrected the order and issued a gift card and re-ordered using the gift card as payment.  When I received the item, to my dismay three tires fit, the fourth one didn't.  Instead of making a stink, I just kept the items and now one tire looks like it's wearing skinny jeans! Great idea for storage, but the maker needs more quality control.
B0012TRLVE|5|Great product! Screwed right in with zero issue
B00HHH1MUG|5|great color , better then the amber look
B00CR3D2SU|1|It came damaged and it s the wrong filter do not match description
B001F12LZA|5|Works as advertised. It took less than 5 minutes to swap it out with my 10 year old leaky one.
B000CC0HZ4|5|I love my cloths bar for the car. Fits perfect and very nice quality. Thank You. Maxie Gunderson
B00BHIAG5S|5|Works for me! I have yet to see an exhaust system fit perfectly weather its a cheap exhaust or magna flow or various other name brands. this required some messing around, the clamps are awful and if your using the stock down/mid pipe you will need an adapter pipe. If your not willing to work on the exhaust and maybe spend a little of the money you saved on it to make it work then its not for you. When the exhaust is on and sealed up properly it sounds and looks great!. my 2.0 didn't gain any power in my eyes but the sound and look has everyone asking about it so I'm happy now I just need the headers!
B00QWT5288|4|I only wanted the light fixtures which are of good quality however the wire harness was not so good. The switch has some electronics inside that apparently did not work and used up a great deal of my time to figure it out but like I said I bought it for light fixtures not for the wire harness which I found elas were at a lot better quality.
B00R1LP17S|5|Used them for the first time since I've bought them. Works as stated. I don't recall off hand, but you need to hold a button to set the pressure. This turns off once the pressure is reached, so if you need to fill another tire, you need to flip the switch off and on again.  * Update * Their customer service has been fantastic in working with me when my pump failed. What I didn't realize and from what I recall wasn't in any documentation, is that there is a fuse in the cigarette plug that you can replace if the pump stops working. That should be the first step to see if your compressor is indeed dead. You need to remove the screw on the plug to get to the fuse.
B00A3FMFNC|5|As described.
B00DRG71T2|5|What can you say about a license plate frame?  It came with mounting hardware that I didn't use.  My car already had stainless steel mounting bolts, so I just removed the dealer advertising frame and replaced it with this one.  This is a nice well-made frame.  I prefer the simple functionial plain look.
B00YDKD096|5|Light weight and love the strap ratchet clip.  Easy on easy off.
B00HX3XSTM|3|Universal fit does not fit properly for every car.  I had a 2014 Nissan Rogue.  But cheap price so I kept them.
B00KHD5JZG|3|Fit it to my G35 Coupe looks fantastic.
B00B1TNQCS|5|The rubber mat is exactly what I wanted and needed. It was delivered on time and installed in seconds. I always have items in the bed of my truck and now none of them move thanks to the rubber mat.
B000JZY93U|5|Great product!!!
B000K21KR0|1|I have no idea why anyone likes this stuff. I think they must have never tried rust converters that really ARE good. From descriptions of Skyco Ospho, I think the latter is very similar or identical (but cheaper). This stuff is &#34;water thin&#34; and has &#34;wetting agents,&#34; so it creeps UNCONTROLLABLY during use and everywhere it creeps to it leaves stains and/or destroys finish. It dissolved the primer on my car, for example, so now my car is worse off from using this stuff than it was before! It also left persistent hideous blotches of white haze, exactly like naval jelly. It may be a good product for dipping rusted parts, to convert the rust into phosphate, but for auto body work this stuff is just heinous, and for dipping there are cheaper options.  Meanwhile, Mar-Hyde One Step and similar products do exactly what I want. They're like latex paint with a phosphoric acid base. They build thick, stay EXACTLY where you put them, even on vertical surfaces, and cure to a thick, smooth, tough, perfectly uniform black film that you don't have to topcoat because it converts the rust permanently and is as durable as paint.
B0027687PU|5|Perfect size for the sign I made.  Put on card stock and laminated so that the numbers could be changed out based on the number attending.
B003UM9GDM|5|Easy assembly.  I put it together in less then 5 minutes.  Works great on my bike!  For those of you tired of changing your oil and doing that balancing act to check the levels...I highly recommend this.
B00Q0DMZSQ|5|Worked perfectly, made exhaust install a lot faster by not having to use old one....just cut old clamp off and Inot all ed cat back exhaust with new clamp
B00HSOKB46|5|Tire Cover came earlier than expected.  It is beautiful and sturdy.  Looks great.
B00T7Q0Z2G|5|Item arrived fast and in perfect shape , easy to install , arrived with complete instructions and tools for easy installation.
B00YI3IGA6|5|Neatest thing ever!!! *****
B008032PVG|5|I was hesitant because of the price but it has a warranty and has done a great job in my 1997 S10 2.2L. I always wait to write my review just in case it fails, but this fuel pump is EXCELLENT QUALITY
B000N3466S|1|I rarely review products but when one is this bad I feel compelled to do so.  I did order it with the expectation that it would fulfill its purpose for one job only. And by one job I mean greasing two wheel bearings on my trailer.  So I was surprised that it didn't even make it to the second wheel.  Seriously the quality on this is incredibly bad.  I ended up driving to Autozone and picking one up there for just a few more dollars that was better in quality and finish the job.
B008D72FUU|4|Cove worked out great.  It has a built in storage bag that makes it easy to store.
B00UE9PMJ6|5|Put on a pontoon boat. Very bright.
B0022ZV1KE|2|I thought it was a medium duty switch......<br />It's light duty at best.
B004I199JA|5|I like it. It Provides clear vision and good price.
B009Y7MJVS|4|its ok keeps coming off glass
B00JIIZCM6|5|Just treated some leather products that were dry and needed treatment badly, and was very impressed with the results. It cleaned and conditioned it beautifully, especially when followed up with the conditioner and restorer. Leather is only as good as it's maintenance and this product delivers.
B000CO9QBI|5|Great Staff. I love it.
B00YVELVEK|1|I ordered as picture master cylinder cable clutch in left hand and received in righ one. ( for brake)
B00J1VW6JM|3|The starter looked to be of good quality but it did not fit my boat.<br />It is listed as the starter for my Mercruiser 145 , 1988 model year.<br />The mounting holes we completely wrong. I should have pulled the old<br />starter out before I ordered and I would have seen the difference in the<br />bolt pattern
B00318NT1K|5|Good
B000HJ9T8I|5|I like these things. I can fabricate any sides I want to. I can a 22 gauge sheet metal to these things. These things are universal when it comes to different applications.
B00062ZSCC|5|Great Product!!! Thanks
B00KL5Q1Q6|1|mud flaps were inferior product and when returning had to pay shipping
B000E0SBXO|5|very good product and time to deivering
B00Q6DU96U|3|I thought two were included in this purchase but found out differently upon arrival.<br />The unit does what it's advertised to do.
B00G52H7YE|5|Genuine Toyota parts that fits and performs as it should.
B00WS15CG6|5|Nice replacement....good quality... Reasonable price.
B00OXZD9F6|5|Great product super fast ship
B002YIACG8|5|Super easy to use.  My first controller so I have nothing to compare it to but it worked well.  After following the simple instructions to adjust the max braking it worked great.  Towed a 3,000 lb trailer with a crossover with no issues in stop & go traffic.  Braking was as if I didn't have a trailer behind me.  I really like that it has an 'emergency' lever that will fully apply the trailer brakes if needed.
B009FU7RZM|5|Excellent replacement part.  Great quality. Great price.
B00DPYAGVG|5|Vinyl decal was as expected.
B00FRHOMNM|4|It's a good wiper
B000PHHSM6|5|Much better than I thought possible.
B0096DHODS|4|The princess design is made by plastic. I was hoping it was sewn into the mat but it isnt.
B00GZWF4SK|5|very nice very happy :)
B0024WU1UG|3|I was expecting a little more from Sonax with this product. The wand has a nice cover with a foam support, however a brush would be much better suited for cleaning dirty wheels.
B005DLLK9Q|5|Cured the partial throttle surge that the truck has had since new
B00NA8NOD4|5|These were a perfect fit though I found the instructions were a little difficult to follow. Then again, I am not the most hands-on kind of guy so they may have been perfectly clear to most people. They look great on the bike and over a good wind break.
B0013REXSO|5|The velcro handles cannot sit in the correct area based on the spacing between the door frame and the sound bar. These fit on to the sound bar in the perfect spot. Very easy to install and look great.
B000CPCBEQ|1|I have right to believe this stuff killed the transmission in my 05 Scion xB. After I put this oil in, the bearings inside the trans started making alot of noise in 4th and 5th. I drained it and put some Eneos fluid in and the noise is still there. Thanks Redline! Won't be buying your overpriced products again!
B00YMZAB2Q|5|Thiss does the job a lot easier than the original Mercury system did it.
B005UKZDR0|1|I bought this cable and the end that connects to the ball joint pops off all the time.  For every hour driving on the highway, I have to stop on the side of the road to reconnect the cable.  SAFETY HAZARD! DO NOT BUY
B000QUZ572|4|Thought they would be hard rubber, but they are plastic. Seem to work pretty good, but need to see how they long wear.
B002O30CGI|4|4 inch was the way to go for my 2002 F350 Dually
B007IO9IA4|5|Is what it is
B000CC9CDM|4|Installed this on 2003 Subaru Legacy Wagon 5-speed. Removed the stock muffler and had this installed, custom setup. The car also has a borla header.<br /><br />Sounds great but not much quieter than no muffler which was surprising to me. Very deep rumble and sounds good throughout the range. It does muffle some of the rawer elements but it does not quiet the car much and introduced some resonance to the cabin. I love the look, the sound etc but would like it to have quieted the car more.
B00CDAFT6K|5|Great product, great price. I got exactly what I was looking for. Too easy. Gald I found this
B00G733U10|5|fit perfectly
B00IG0F06K|5|These really work good. They have plenty of length in each light to go where you want. And they are easy to work when your riding to. I only had to put six on my bike because they are so bright.
B00B92QHEG|5|Great protection and adds gripping traction so you don't drop it. Everyone that sees it, wants 1!
B00JIJ4LWW|4|Good overall product, just doesn't seem to clean as well as hoped
B00HT1BAT8|5|Easy to installed and it was the part for my car.
B00KTIWDTE|4|just as expected. jus had to switch out my chip inside my old fob to this fob then bam its just shifted colors... great way to have your keys stand out. no more confusion at those key house parties...
B001AY2WLU|4|My husband keeps this in his pocket for minor repairs. So far, it's doing a good work for him.
B000630B1Y|5|Very good product. I will buy another soon.
B000CRVFYQ|5|It fits snugly and does the job.
B0010E1LYY|5|Ve r u good product for the price.
B001GO653K|5|IT S WHAT I SPECTED.
B00DPIDYL6|5|They look great, they fit great.
B0001MQ7EK|5|Exactly what I needed.  Keeps my drinks cool.
B005QABV2U|5|Excellent fit on 2004 Silverado EXt Cab
B000Z0HVHA|2|This works, but the plug on the end keeps coming apart. I snaps right back together, but it feels &#34;cheap&#34;. I might just glue it.
B00CQC8OP8|4|Function and fit as described
B0031BH9L8|5|great price fas shopping
B002OP7QO2|5|OEM  match
B005ST7W6I|5|They fit perfectly and work just as I expected! They keep my carpets clean!! Price was good and shipping was good.
B0050DBVXM|5|Worked perfectly on my Victory Magnum.
B009EU5ZNO|5|Worked very well
B0009H529I|5|happy w/purchase
B002T3FTTI|1|does NOT fit a 1990 honda trx300
B0041PXMIM|1|There is no room to use an allen wrench to tighten the existing risers once the Rox riser is installed... Only if you pivot the Rox all the way in one direction can you tighten only one of the bolts.  This defeats the entire purpose of pivoting, adjustable risers... I cannot use these at all.
B00BYH6C1E|5|I can't begin to sing the praises of this product. It has saved my IDs from sliding under my car seat so many times, not to mention other small items it has saved. I absolutely love it. Thank you Shark Tank for bringing it to my attention!!!
B00NLN899C|5|Works great.  Nice and sturdy.  You will likely have to drill out the hole at the base of the bar where the wires come through.  Also be very careful to make sure the wires do not get smashed between the jeep and the base when installing.  I learned the hard way.  I had to rewire the whole bar again.
B001UJMBWK|5|Five stars
B00I625KBS|3|The white printed words &#34;Live Laugh Love&#34; are a bit too small (especially in the &#34;script&#34; like font that it uses) to read from afar, but I like this better than the dealer's advertisement cover :-)
B000RH20T0|4|good quality but a little smaller than i thought it would be
B003E3OFNI|4|Looks great
B002O39E0S|4|I love HK and this was the perfect addition to my HK car accessories.  Looks exactly like the pic and the smell is ok.
B000COA1CQ|2|Very hard to work with
B00YBFUE1U|5|easy to use and worked as described
B0006301W8|5|Arrvd on time & well pkd. Must have for putting up heat film on windows!
B000IYPSZU|5|As a certified Honda mechanic, I'm often skeptical about aftermarket products that are inexpensive. The radiator fan motor went out in my personal vehicle, this entire assembly was cheaper than the motor alone. The fit and finish is excellent, it dropped right in and has been keeping my car cool in the Arizona summer heat for a month with zero issues. Buy with confidence, this is a great product.
B010HM4K1K|5|This thing is great, It's small size allowed me to drill a 7/8'' hole into my deep cell battery box lid, wired in series along with a momentary button/switch that is wired to the battery. So when pushing the button, this meter lights up and displays the voltage reading in the battery. Allowing me to keep on top of my charge in the RV, with a push of a button. The light in this is bright enough to be seen in the afternoon sunlight.
B007USCM7E|5|So far so good
B007HRSG3W|5|Worked as advertised!
B007TON0VQ|5|Husband loved this mat !
B004N6LN9E|4|Great replacement at half the cost but does get fogged up with humidity sometimes
B008G4Y076|5|Very good product, now I can see when I back up at night.
B004D5SUIC|5|ok
B000FPYESO|5|They are so brite and shiny and give a great look
B00E1SNXW4|4|Arrived on-time and in great condition.  Easy installation with little additional parts needed (ie. grease, pad lube, etc.).  I have used Callahan on both of my cars now and so far so good.
B0006VORDY|4|Could be a little better blocking wind. But overall works great.
B000HBNU9K|5|So many people have issues with their headliner falling down a year or less after install because they don't use the right stuff. This is the right stuff, worked and applied good.
B00MPAJ4CS|5|At first, I didn't think it will be strong enough to work since the struts were thinner than the OEM.  But once installed, they worked as expected.  It has been about 3 weeks now and I hope it continues to work for many months to come.  Great price and fast shipping.  THANK YOU!
B00F8PNNBK|5|Perfect fit for my Mini Cooper. Arrived in time.
B0002GXP40|5|They were exactly what my husband wanted.  And look great on his '66 Ford Bronco
B00YF4MVT0|5|Fast shipping, OEM quality
B00KWJV800|5|This bracket worker great. Just what I needed.
B001XCBCQK|3|Can't get the one foot to stay on.  Definitely has to be used in the rear portion, can't be used on top of folded down back seats.
B000EDUUG2|4|Works well for our camper.  Need to be aware of how it folds when sweeping.
B00192JGA8|5|WORK'S
B000X2533Y|5|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it and always brags that he has own and it comes in handy. Great purchase! Came fast and I live in the Caribbean. Also came neatly and safely packaged.
B0002Q7C1C|5|Good fit and quality.
B003UYYGWQ|5|Good quality
B00BZVYM98|5|I am completely amazed with this product! When I purchased my car, it only came with one key and remote&#62; Pricing it from the dealer, to have a spare, this remote was ridiculously priced. This one here on Amazon was extremely cheaper and easy to program! The step by step instructions made it a breeze! I'll definitely purchase my next one from here as well!
B0049EB43K|5|As advertised, and cheaper than OEM, plus a drain plug!! Great deal!!
B00BLZ9XQK|5|Solved my problem and returned my flashes back to normal.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|I like these towels.  I would have liked them to be a little thicker/plush, but they work for me.
B000CFO6KI|4|works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B00LP7TJFY|5|Very fast shipping, great product
B00CKEPUTA|2|not really what I was hoping for...expected the adhesive to already be on it.
B008HRX5PU|5|What can I say? It's a plug!
B000BZI4JS|5|Exact replacement for less money.
B00EJW49FW|4|Great Bluetooth system. Install was very easy, was able to listen to my ipod and iphone all the way to Sturgis and back.
B00O3GV26S|5|The logos are good quality.  I found the original KIA Logos difficult to remove from a 2016 Kia Sorrento.  The front Logo snaps into the grill.  I took it to MACO and they removed it for $35.  The back Logo is glued on but does not come off easily.  If I were to do another one, I would have MACO remove the back one too.  I asked the KIA dealer about removing the front one and they wanted about $150 to do it.<br /><br />Make sure you get the right size for your vehicle.
B00YTZGSKI|1|I was wary after reading the other review. Mine didn't fit either. It was kind of a nice piece, but it was at least 4 inches too short. Not even close.
B00FXY6W2S|4|Material is nice and what I wanted looks good and easy to work with
B004A1UNQ6|5|Fit my '03 1500 4.7. Works
B002GQ6RF8|5|fit well. good to go.
B00XQY8MZC|3|goggles is a toy.. helmet  ok.
B003CWP3Z0|3|Fitted the car like a glove. Material was heavier than I expected.
B007F11QC8|1|The backing that the decal is attached to is more tacky than the sticker itself and either will stretch the decal or tear it completely when trying to remove it.
B003Y323NC|2|Product was ok seller was not
B00JYMZ8HK|5|Easy to use and install.  Have not had any issues
B00G4RZZOE|1|It was not the color I wanted.  Wouldn't you think pearl is in the white\cream fami!y?  This was silver. I wasted my money.
B00I523D68|5|Too bad you can't just buy the driver's floor mat--that's all most people really need.  But aside from the fact that I didn't need to replace the other 3, they are an exactly perfect match to my car and existing floor-mats.  The size, shape and color were exactly the same--even has the same Lexus logo stitched in exactly the same spot.  Really a nice looking product.  I thought $80+ was a little steep for 4 small carpet remnants, but what are you going to do.
B00QFEJVG4|5|It fits a Mercedes ML350 perfectly. Just what I was looking for!
B00030DLEE|5|Got this for a family member thats always outside during the winter. They love it and says it keeps their food really warm.
B001EP292W|4|Did the job great!
B00UW4DNEO|5|Awesome!!  Bought 2.  My son-in-law was quite impressed with product when he took it camping. Used it for cell phone and jumped start a truck. My son bought a four wheel drive chevy pickup with a dead battery. He jumped the truck 8 times before recharging the  Scorpion. I don't travel anywhere without it. I have had two other jump boxes, neither of which worked as well as the Brighttech Scorpion.
B00666IO3C|5|These fit my Aprilia Rally 50 and worked as they should.  No squeaking and plenty of braking for my needs.  Excellent quality at an excellent price.
B00C94EYVQ|5|The measurements  was prefect!
B007GRFHN0|5|Made the engine look a lot better with the PM horn
B006NZTZLQ|2|Apparently there are problems getting this device to work with Windows 10.  I wanted avoid having a bulky cable connected, but bulky cables are good for one thing; reliability.<br /><br />This device works fine from my Android phone, and from a Windows 7 PC.  On Windows 10 it will pair but not connect.<br /><br />Maybe the company will put out a firmware update or at least some suggestions for getting it to work with Windows 10.
B00ARBO4C2|4|just the ticket for heavy truck transmissions and rear ends
B000JNTEJG|5|Fit my 2007 Prius perfectly. Well almost perfectly. The box must have been dropped at some point in delivery because one side of the hitch was bent in just a bit and made it difficult to install.
B00R94YUOM|1|They came in the mail, was really excited about it because my buddy has the same ones but for a Beamer and I put batteries in them, and they did NOT work. I'm livid.
B003ZE32F8|5|Just what I was looking for
B001DH4C76|5|Works as designed.
B001DR9VFY|5|Easy to install and my truck stops great. Installed them on a 2007 Toyota Tundra
B000CD579E|4|they fit.
B0074DFHLI|5|Works great
B003YJPIG0|5|These were perfect for our motorhome draperies.
B00F8UPJV2|4|Pros: Heavy duty metal and great craftsmanship<br /><br />Cons: One of the decals was a slightly crooked and they do not have any similar plates stating, &#34;I love an Irish Woman&#34; :(<br /><br />Overall great product and would recommend it to anyone!!!
B002ZTGLCK|5|Good line similar to Helix race line but lots cheaper
B00H7PQ50U|2|Bought this product at costco. the car wash does produce any soapy froth to clean and you will burn your arms rubbing.  It takes so much of effort. Not worth it.  the wax takes so long to buff that I am dead by the time it finished  and i still see streaks.
B00XQLFCI0|1|I wasn't satisfied because the gas civet literally flew off my truck as I traveled down the highway and one of my handles was the incorrect size so now my truck looks a mess from the adhesive prints and missing a handle cover. I'm disappointed and was very excited when I first received them but after all this I'm disappointed because now I have to try to redo my truck.
B00CIC0EE0|5|Worked great and the instructions for re=setting the ignition were easy to follow.  Lousy dealership wanted $800 to replace and re-code.  Well worth the money and took no time to install.  My 17 yr old son did all the work.
B00JNR2P6S|4|perfect
B0014JQ13Q|5|oem bmw
B008I7FE62|4|Not bad but there are brighter options out there...
B000COL4A4|5|My favorite truck accessory for winter trips.  Kind of difficult to install on a Dodge Ram 3500 but I got the second one on good.
B009P0QGRM|5|Easy set up, works great. Not 100% automatic but no issue just turn it to correct setting and it locks on. For th savings, works fine for me.
B000BZG5YE|3|I made these work for me on my 2002 4.7 liter Toyota Tundra.  The original units employed a mounting back plate with riv-nuts to accept the mounting cap screws.  These sensors are too large in diameter at the back of the two hole mount plate to allow the use of the original nut plate.  I used stainless bolts with stainless lock washers and nuts to mount them.  I hope they stay put.
B00GEI91KC|5|It's oil. Seems to do what it is supposed to do.<br />I do oil changes according to the manufacturer's maintenance schedule. When the the manual does not call for synthentic oil, this &#34;dino&#34; oil works fine.
B006JN7D3Y|2|didn't work
B002EW5G2O|4|Had to coat and re-apply on tough stains. Overall good.
B002VEX208|5|Worked great and installed with no problems in my 1998 Toyota Avalon with a V6
B00KOHHLTW|5|Did EXACTLY what it said it would do...after puting on some Vance and hynes short shots on my 883 iron I started having bad acceleration and lots of backfiring....after installing the fuel pack (which took me 10 min) my 2015 iron ran like a CHAMPION!!
B0027VT0I8|3|The fan is very noisy when it kicks on. And it does, a lot
B004EK94P4|4|Fine for the cost.  They seem to adhere and weather well.
B00HQPV29U|5|Installed on my 2010 GTI at stage 1+ (APR tune with Carbonio intake.) What a difference this thing makes! I had no idea I had slowly lost some power but I sure had. With this new DV+ installed my throttle response is much better and I hold boost much deeper into the revs. Very high quality product and very simple to install as long as you have enough room under the car.<br /><br />I also ordered some wheel ramps so I could get underneath the car and that made this job WAY easier. In fact, I think getting underneath with enough room to operate would be impossible without lifting the car up somewhat. On the 2010 GTI the DV is located right above the axle on the passenger side. Getting to the top bolt can be a bugger and unsnapping the clip can be a pain as well. There are ample youtube videos which show you how though.
B000A8OK6C|3|Required trimming and filing to get it to fit
B006DYEBKC|1|Did not work and wound up costing me $13.20 in shipping costs. Purchased another part elsewhere and problem resolved.
B00Y5MN97A|1|This item is junk from China. It is made of very lightweight aluminum and is EXTREMELY flimsy. Also, the hole spacing does not fit US license plates - you will have to drill holes in the bracket in order to attach your license plate. Further, the hole spacing on the mount is incorrect for my Toyota (which the vendor said was a fit for my car).
B00M0FQMQY|3|guuud
B007MVAVAY|5|They were slightly different than the ones that came with my car. After figuring out the differences, it was fairly easy to install these. So far I haven't had any issues. It holds my trunk door up without a problem.
B00U2OE29O|1|We are not at all pleased with this product.
B004ZF39T0|5|I ordered these lights Friday and got them the next day. I was so happy then the night time came I turned on my headlights and I turned the daytime back  on!  I am very satisfied with this product I even have little brief case I can use for whatever now. I am very satisfied with this.

B006VFEJJQ|5|Battery was delivered on time with good packing. The positive terminal plastic cover was missing, but that is fine as long as battery is good.<br />The battery was fully charged, my multimeter reading showed 12 V, and manufacturing date showed July 2014. I took me 20 minutes to install it on my 2010 Prius.Toyota dealer quoted me $250 for OEM battery, and I would guess another $100 for installation.<br />Now lets see how long it lasts compare to OEM.
B000EDOT7I|4|these work great!
B001AIZ5HY|5|Great solution to cloudy, discolored headlights. Much better than replacing the headlights if you don't need to. Get it, try it, and you'll be surprised how good it works.
B002MQMM4M|5|Looks just like it does in the pics
B00B5LPZLW|1|Let's start with the good... The part is very nicely machined. No chatter. The polish is even, with only a little bit of the tool marks showing.<br />It fits perfectly to the bike, and installation was exactly the same as the original cap.<br /><br />Now the bad... The thread interface between the cap and the mount are shoddy. If you thread it on a couple turns, you can still move the cap around a significant amount. Loose as a goose. I don't expect a 2a thread. But for $50, I expect much better than they are.<br /><br />This indicates nonchalant quality control.<br /><br />Next. The design for the oring seal outright sucks. When I purchased a gas cap that advertised an oring seal, I expected the oring to seat on the internal diameter of a pocket, and on the external diameter on the cap. In this example, the cap clamps the oring like a flat seal... Which doesn't really seal orings very well at all.<br /><br />The worst part about this design choice is that the designer could have easily chosen the superior path at the exact same manufacturing cost.<br /><br />This part does perform it's function and I won't be returning it. But I won't be excited to buy another Slingshot Racing product in the future.
B00S1PLGW2|3|It was very nice
B001BK658Y|4|Mirror is solid. Wish it wasn't as zoomed in as it is but that's such a minor complaint.
B001OCVBGA|3|you have to jury rig the rear bracket to make it level on a 2015 ram
B000B8VWP8|2|cheap plastic bracket was broke when received epoxied bracket & painted white to match my trailer. if could have found a better quality vent that would fit i would sent this one back.
B0082365AQ|4|Works great but they were right.....tires stink. Had to keep it outside for a little while.
B00K3ILOKE|5|Great equipment. Cooler on hot days than my last HJC. The SunShade is a nice option that allows me to ride into dusk and night without having to change shields.
B0041QOAAK|5|Very excellent product!!! Just what i need!!!
B000E7WLJW|5|This carrier is worth the purchase.  was able to fit 8 bowling balls (2 4-ball carriers) from Reno, NV to El Paso, TX and it survived a monsoon and the desert heat.  Kept my gear nice and dry.
B009HBNADC|5|The best sticker money can buy
B00BPF2YVM|5|Worked as expected... stabilized my ride
B010DP8PIU|5|Anker provided me with a sample of the Compact Car Jump Starter and Portable Charger Power Bank in return for a fair and unbiased review of the product.  It is currently charging a Samsung Tab 3 Lite tablet and an iPhone 6 simultaneously.  This is after using it this afternoon to start a 2006 Nissan Sentra SE/R 4-cylinder engine.  The Sentra was intentionally left with the headlights on until the battery was completely unresponsive--no interior lights and no starter motor activity at all when turning the ignition on.  I connected the Anker jump starter according to the directions, the green lights came on indicating it was ready to start, and the Sentra started immediately.  Very impressive for such a small unit.  It comes with a car power socket adapter, a wall receptacle charger, and the starter cables for a vehicle battery.  It has 2 Power IQ USB ports to charge phones, tablets, or other devices with the correct amperage for a quick charge without harming the battery.  It also has an LED flashlight that can either be illuminated steadily or set to flash as an emergency warning.  As always, the Anker fit and finish are excellent for the power pack, the accessories, and the carrying case.  I will carry this in one of my cars all the time now in case I need a start for a dead battery.  I will no longer have to wait for a service person to show up or hope a friendly person in the parking lot will come to my aid.
B000C2WD7E|5|Fits like oem on my 1996 Nissan 240sx
B00H15WTBU|2|One headlight brighter than the other

B0006IX850|4|Work okay.
B003DXV8DO|5|Mats are good quality and price is great! I love them!
B008EM5RQI|5|It works great!  It's been solid,  hasn't moved when I've rolled into it.  Definitely has done what I need it to do .. which is to stop my car from hitting my motorcycle.  I use this with a lighted stop sign and both have worked splendid so far.  Definitely recommend.
B00829PIR6|5|excellent product for price
B00N2T7216|1|I've had this for only two months. It's cracking and falling apart. The front, the black decoration part, is flaking off. The suction cups don't work. It's very thin and flimsy so it's impossible to get it to stay up on the window. I live in Arizona so it's in direct hot sunlight but it shouldn't be falling apart like this already. This is horrible and totally useless. The only good part about it is that the cat design is very cute, which doesn't matter now since it's flaking off
B001TNKZD4|4|They were easy to install and fit perfect. Just what I was looking for after I installed a 225lb IRON BULL Bumper.<br />After I added a Wench the truck got really &#34;Wallowy&#34; dove and washed out.<br />Its not all gone but it is vastly improved and now a lot closer to stock. I would buy again.<br />2003 Toy Tundra 4x4
B00KRQGXBC|5|High quality product, purchase from this distributor with confidence!
B00526K6E2|5|superman mickey!! so cute!!
B00FUNPBA6|5|Looks great on my 'bro cooler' (Yeti Tundra)  ha!  Afterall, a Yeti is indeed bigfoot.
B00AJF9OM6|5|Product had one bad terminal but owner made quick adjustment
B000NPUJQC|5|It holds sockets
B00IN5BT90|5|fast shipment parts fit perfectly
B002UC6XTI|5|it works fine.but the last one only lasted 2 yrs.the original lasted over 20 yrs.
B000AMGYJY|3|All plastic - you get what you pay for
B00XTJ34ZC|5|Used to build roof rack.
B00COYNZJ8|5|Loved this product the second I saw it!  It works great and has a silver reflector on the other side for the really hot days.<br /><br />I get many compliments on this and I bought another one to give as a gift and it was a hit!<br /><br />You just can't beat making your own car the Millennium Falcon!
B00CJ00OKK|3|Works for a fly rod but not a perfect fit.
B0000CBIK5|1|This product contains Lead and other chemicals known to the state of California to cause cancer or birth defects.  Extremely flimsy...  Buy something American.
B00M8N33R4|5|Easy to apply.  Like minded people love it
B0022ZK5JC|3|ok
B001CI33IA|4|Pipe fit great, better than expected. Amazon had this for a great price and it did the job. Have spent more money on pipes that didn't fit near as well.
B00OBTYD4A|5|Fit perfectly. Fired right up upon installation. Shipping was quick. Thank you World Power Systems. Word to the wise: 1. if your starter goes out, you might as well replace your solenoid along with it because it may be the very reason your starter went out. A solenoid is cheap and easy to install, so prevent premature starter issues by replacing it too. 2. This starter did not include nuts for installation, therefore I tried to use the old starters nuts which fit but stripped the bolts. Save yourself some grief and do not use the factory starters nuts when installing the new aftermarket starter. A suggestion for World Power Systems, please include the nuts for installation.
B003L2XPLA|5|Strong filter housing
B00LG07MZE|5|“Quality sunshade! I have a 2011 Honda Civic, and this is the closest sunshade I have found that fits. I don't like the accordion style shade, so it's hard to find a shade that fits the giant Civic windshield. This shade could stand to be a tad bigger, but it fits the bill!”
B00KQEHHPG|5|Great oil for my VW TDI.
B001FANR54|4|Good solid product. Texturing looks great. Install was a bit confusing - I had to use a combination of the directions that were sent and directions from the manufacturer. There are also extra pieces since it fits on multiple models. My recommendation would be to organize and layout all pieces prior to install and save some headache. Once organized the pieces easily mount. I was able to complete this in a few hours in a garage with a just a socket wrench.<br /><br />.
B000FG8B32|5|Very bright! Definitely would buy again!
B000CO7IIQ|5|Perfect universal switch
B00379ABX2|1|Signs look great except for the almost impossible to remove oversized bar code sticker that has been placed on the front of all of them.
B000C9JZH8|5|excellent product
B00A59HQAS|2|The joints are not sealed from the elements so I don't expect that they will last through the harsh winters that we have, or even the rain, for that matter. It has a rubber covering but the covering open.
B001JT98S6|4|Excellent, they only need to put one option to turn off the blue light because is so intensity.
B004AQXGH4|5|Fits perfect.
B00N2ZFH3U|4|Works ok but a bit expensive.
B00M77ZR0W|1|Not so bright... bad product... dont buy this h3 led bulbs...
B00AR0FEE0|5|works great
B00LEBLI82|5|I love these lights! Replacing inside lighting of the RV
B00SWI1TXY|5|that's fit exactly
B00GNVPRAI|4|Arrived in good condition but late since the box it was in was damaged and it was an inconvenience. Option for screws would be nice too since I had to alter the hubs and separately buy extra screws.
B00A1M2WWG|5|love it,look awsome in my rims
B000ET9SAA|5|as advirtised
B00DE0TMOI|5|It was a gift for my son who is quite the Eagles fan.  He was very happy to get it.  Nice looking.
B001R8ZS6A|5|Love it..
B00HRGLWH0|5|love it!!!
B00E01HTM2|1|These knee pucks are complete garbage and went straight to trash. They are super *THIN* plastic molds that I bet are hollow inside. Wasn't even worth attaching them to the suit since these would be gone within a couple of laps on the track. If you're looking for a good product - go for the chicken hawks and call it done.<br /><br />The velcro attachment on the back actually looks decent, so if you want them just for the show - they could do that. But if you need them to work as knee sliders, this is the wrong product.
B006LJAO0A|5|It was a perfect fit.  Easy to install
B00TXS42HW|4|Just installed them on my Ram 1500, will report back if there is any issues.
B00OXBTWK6|5|I love it! great quality!
B00DBBG450|3|Great LED's. Giving it 3 out of 5 stars for the following reason:<br /><br />• Came with no screws / hardware for installation<br />• Wiring was a backwards nightmare (see other comments). They look and work great once installed though!
B001CM5V4A|5|Best exhaust systems since they can be tuned for sound and back pressure easily and economically.
B0059XCVVO|1|Adhesive is awful looks and feels cheap
B000C1HGAE|5|Good product!
B000BZZTZK|1|The drum was not properly turned (rounded) and caused a knocking sound in my drum brakes.  I put on another drum and the problem immediately went away.  Sure I could fix it and have it turned, but for the price, it's definitely not worth it!
B003SWNVL2|1|I should listen to other reviews before buying this product. This product will not last a journey of more than four hours on HWY 95 to 75 MPH. After 6 hours of travel from Burke VA to Miami FL bag it shows signs of ripping through the stitches. After 9 hours of traveling the top bungee burst into two pieces leaving only the top strap to hold the top of the bag. We also went through a couple of bad storms and I was ready to see the entire contents of the bag wet I could confirm when we reached our destination. Luckily I made a couple of temporary repairs to the bag to help me last at least for the return, but the elastic cord superior burst back into two pieces, so I had to help with external elastic cords to hold objects inside the bag in place. By the time I returned home, the straps on the sides, front and back has remained too worn. It seems that the wind had rubbed while not last an hour on the road. One of the reasons I hate this product more because I bought more than a month ago, I used it once and now I can return this piece of junk.
B00AQ4VF0O|5|Ranger hasn't broken down yet. Good price.
B00AQB2V7S|1|I Installed a pair of these on my 1997 Tracer. After installation & road test I noticed that the harshness was a lot worse. Also when I changed lanes the car would dart to the side. I removed the ball joints & rotated the ball, It had a rough feel. Had to replace the Joints With a new set. I went with A/C Delco professional & they were fine.
B0006NCGMQ|5|fast shipping and good prices
B00R6LZWPY|4|Does just what it claims.  Could fit a little neater but otherwise an easy install and protects quite well
B00WID0OEE|5|I love it! I especially love their warranty and their promise of their service although I do not need their service at all so far. They show their customers that they care.
B00DT7C806|4|A bit pricey for what it is but looks nice on my 2016 MDX. Fast, no hassle delivery
B00K80L7TA|5|very good product and time to deivering
B001O7PNNM|4|Great Stuff!
B0031I1ZH0|5|Good, nice and big and the elastic is awesome
B002VE3VHW|5|great love the band on bottom!
B00M78820I|5|Keeps the heat down, loving it just for that reason alone.
B00348G9D2|5|No problems.  Works great.  I didn't need or like the plastic O rings that came with it.  Couldn't get them to work and the loose flap rubber ends I could do without.  Bottom line, it works and the price was a hell of a lot cheaper than other products being sold.
B00JR33MYW|4|no screws to install
B0024EBXL0|5|Great product for the price!
B003USYN6Q|5|I tired this leather cleaner to see if it would perform as well as the lexol cleaner and conditioner I have been using. I am happy to report that it seems to clean and condition just as well without all of the stows required with lexol.
B0031BEJEI|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B0009IBJE4|5|Finally I have a battery charger that is &#34;working&#34; like it should...
B00MU5X17M|5|Product is perfect - just what it stated to be on the web page.
B008PJDOSS|2|NOT THE RIGHT ONE--
B000IY4AL8|5|Works great. No regrets.
B00I0EAV8O|5|Easy to use. Thought it would be difficult because it weighs a bit more then I thought but no problems. Smooth and easy
B0016ITCVS|5|Great!!!!!!!
B000BUU5XG|5|Keeps the exhaust up away from the other tailgaters. Installs easy and keeps the exhaust above the RV.
B00IAZ5PWU|5|It was great
B00AGROIDM|1|Not working on my 07/ 300 base will be sending it back costing me money.
B000CLK92G|5|Works well, no issues with the arrival time
B00G71324M|4|They fit really well and are pretty easy to install
B000PAM9KO|5|Works great in my 2010 Honda odyssey!
B0069A089S|5|Great
B00LLLZ0YI|1|Really bad quality.  Screw was stripped before I even touched it.  Buttons sank in couldn't press them
B000CFQ2XM|1|Received bags with bracket metal on air bag in box, they don't  hold air, have to re air bags every day of our trip, checked air lines an bags can't  find leak, but the next day down 10 lbs
B00LBFC4VQ|5|Great product, very easy to install
B0002SRCMO|5|Use it at the job all the time, I love this little tool it has gotten me out of tight situations
B003CSQQDW|5|The first one I ordered came in a long skinny box and the hard plastic bumper protector got permanently bent during shipping.  Amazon replaced it quickly.<br />The second came in the same condition. Amazon replaced it quickly.<br />The third one came in the same box and was not damaged.<br /><br />It installed easily on my 2010 Scion xB and looks great.<br /><br />It does retain a little water in the gap under the bumper cover.  When you wash the vehicle, it will continue to drip after you have dried the vehicle.<br />Also, if you wax your car, put masking tape on the edges of the cover.  It has a dimpled texture and it is a bear to get wax out of the dimples.<br />Thumbs up!
B00GVOHX6S|1|Color wasn't even a close match to the original color of the car. Disappointed.
B0016IGZ18|5|Everything was perfect!, the part was as described in add..I am very happy...... Thank you
B00063X38M|5|Good experience
B009PF8FYY|5|Easy to install. Work great.
B008AW844Y|5|GOOD ITEM
B000C1MWAS|3|Return due to wrong part
B0067ES9M4|3|The front fit perfect, to many issues installing the rear, if i know i had to drop both rear shocks at the same time to install. I would not sent them back..  no problem returning full refund minus stocking fee i didn't care for that
