B00GOIGQ8M|4|I haven't used the hat yet but I expect to soon as it gets colder here in Minnesota. It's soft and seems like it will keep me warm on my runs.
B000WP0X1Y|5|I am more than thrilled with this camisole.  I bought it because I wanted something to wear under low neckline blouses and dresses, to hide the cleavage.  This fits snugly, so stays in place perfectly when turning or bending.  It is true to size.  The fabric is stretchy, and has light embossing throughout the material.  It is really classy, and if some shows at the top edge of a dress, I say 'WONDERFUL', for it is too lovely to hide completely.  I am more than satisifed !
B001MXIN4O|5|*-*
B00CF74G1K|5|THE DRESS FIT IN ALL THE RIGHT PLACES. IT IS THE PERFECT SUMMER DRESS. WE ARE GOING TO THE BAHAMAS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WEARING IT.
B004XMW586|4|these are so cute and really stay on his feet!  but beware that they are only for newborns.  I had an 8 week early preemie and they were too small on him when he reached 4 months old.  same issue with the 12-24 month size - they are almost too small on him and he is not even 6 months.  in hindsight, i would have only purchased the 12-24 month size from the beginning on.
B00013D2NI|4|I have the Slimmy special edition which is the same as the Slimmy only with a red lining. This is a great wallet. I carry a few bills, 3 credit cards, my license, and some receipts. I've been using the wallet for about 2 years now and it still holds everything securely, things have fallen out a few times, but how often are you whipping your wallet around?    My one issue with this wallet is that since there are not individual card slots, you must carry your cards together and they rub up against each other. After a while the magnetic strip wears down and some ink on the back of my ID is gone. My most used credit card is sometimes hard to swipe now so I've decided to replace the slimmy with a Dopp.    I'm not throwing the slimmy away though. Like I said it's a great wallet that has held up for 2 years. I'll probably use it when I know I'll only need my ID, a credit card, and a few bills. Like going to a restaurant or a bar.    I just thought of this now, but it does not carry business cards well. Because of it's size you need to squish them in and the corners get messed up. Also the cards get dirty rubbing against the leather or magnetic strip of the cards, though I guess that could happen in any wallet.
B0088A1LJS|4|my boy 5 yrs old loves this set i really like more the shorts than the tshit, since i bought this washed in the machine lotssssss of time and still looking nice
B002V75VAY|3|Soft and somewhat warm. Do not buy if you have big calves. 2 of the 4 ends were unfinished and fraying before I ever put them on. Would return them but it is not worth it.
B005TD6A5M|5|I keep my wallet in a front pocket so the larger size is not a problem.  Nice part is that I can keep everything in it.  Looks well made.
B00U6U7K5W|4|I'm a dd cup so I bought an xl. It is best as night bra. It didn't have enough support. In general the bra was too big. I am not sure if it was bad size guessing on my part, but the straps didn't tighten enough in my opinion. It is very pretty and very soft. It doesn't clip down, but it is very stretchy and pulls down.
B00YZJIHH0|5|Now that I'm into layered and looser clothing, I love these colors and how the<br />dress fits.
B00062DTGE|4|Really heavy duty suspenders.  Colorful and fun.  Really useful for working situations.  Wide with heavy clips.  Holds up heavy winter work pants.
B00062NHFC|5|They are soft, long enough to be tucked in, and fit nicely. I'm slender so I wear almost exclusively slim fit dress shirts. I like to have a tight fitting undershirt. These are not skin tight, but hug well enough that these are my go to shirts.
B00FSCGETG|5|love it
B00FFKZAZU|3|We shall see
B00TOTI6GS|5|Love the shirt. Fits really well. Big hit with grandson.
B003G5I8XW|5|Not only are these great hats for a fraction of the price of the high end hats, they come in a size to fit my giant head. I have all 3 colors. I often get complimented on them while wearing them.
B0014L0Y7S|5|I was extraordinarily happy with the suit I purchased. The quality of both the material and stitching was superb considering the price, and customer service was excellent. I sent that to a friend in the United Kingdom and he said he would never be able to find such good value, to buy a suit there of equivalent standard would cost hundreds of pounds.
B00IFQV4Y2|5|The socks work wonderfully with my shoes!
B00NISVM1C|4|This is a beautiful, well made, high quality bandeau. It just didn't suit me. It was too short & kinda squashy on me in the front, but fit nicely in the back. I tried a small, maybe a med would be better for my 34B size.
B00B70IC6G|4|I was pleasantly surprised with the scarf considering the discount I received. I am gifting the scarf so am only going on looks. I am giving it 4 instead of 5 stars as it does look better in the picture and I would never pay the retail price for this particular scarf.
B00A0612WE|5|fit well
B00SR8IS6A|4|I really like the way this belt looks and I like the buckle system. However they said it was 47 inches is more like 41.  Gave the belt away.<br /><br />On further review they contacted me after my negative review.  They have made things right.  They refunded my money and changed their description of the belt.
B008N8121M|5|Perfect fit and great socks for work!!! :)
B009ZOTNPU|4|I'm 5'7 and 135 and it is tight!
B00FXA02N2|5|This is a great jacket for the price but I had to have it altered as the sleeves were way too long.  I a 32.5&#34; sleeve and this was at least 35&#34;
B004GGUAL8|5|My husband loved this shirt.
B00FABKFVI|5|warm
B00147IYQA|5|Great product and great service from the vendor.     Wool is the best clothing product, bar none.
B00LWX2AWK|4|It came in 22 days early and i love it its exactly as described but one of the tassel things have already fallen off and the strap broke.
B00THEYG8C|3|Nice, but I didn't like the metal all the way around and then it has 2 chains that hang in the back.
B00OP48FQS|4|My friend own's a bar called Pirate's Cove. Fun to wear there.
B001D05ZJ2|4|This product looks very sleek and feels like it is well made cant wait to wear it.
B00JB59934|5|The gown was custom made and the manufacturer even contacted me about sizing and length of gown. You can see the quality and care put into the dress...Magnificent!!!
B006YEUFPG|4|I purchased these bow ties for my dog to wear during our wedding. He loves them and looks great in all of them. I think these would be suitable for a child or someone looking for some costume wear. I wouldn't wear them to a formal event as a human. They have held up and are very durable. I have a big dog.
B009A5Y04S|2|I love the design of this top, but I had to send it back because the material is extremely scratchy.  I could probably have tolerated it if it didn't have a turtle neck, but that was the worst of all.  Really wish they used a different material.
B00KT1DJRG|5|excellent product arrived in good condi...
B00EDGA3XQ|1|Hugely disappointed in this fleece jacket. Although, I went by their guide size, the medium was too small, so sizing was off.<br />Also, cheap fabric and the color is not sapphire but an ordinary blue.<br /><br />I should return it but I can't stand the hassle. I wouldn't recommend.
B007EKQCKQ|4|Second pair!
B00CXX6YNY|5|Absolutely perfect
B00EUW0DW4|3|The shirt is nice but too snug around the stomach . I got a large which is more of a medium size , looks nice though
B00Q51DYOM|1|Does not have the logo as displayed in the picture!!  The item shipped was the throwback logo.  Very disappointing. The hat quality etc seems just fine but; ITEM NOT AS SHOWN!  Too late to return as its a Christmas Present.
B00IMQPHK2|1|They don't look like they do in the picture. They are really long.
B004S3PNPM|5|I am a lifeguard, diver, surfer, fisherman, paddleboarder and all around water dog living in South Florida, and this is by far the BEST suncare I have ever used!We use it on all the kids in our Junior Lifeguard program and SurfCamp and they dont get burnt in the hot South Florida Summers with a uv index of 12, wont run, doesnt smell, doesnt burn my skin or eyes and doesnt come off even 8 hours in the water. I put it on once and it stays on all day. All our ocean rescue lifeguards use it, our aquatic center lifeguards and everyone who is serious about sun protection. Worth every penny and you wont be disappointed.My wife says it is so good that she cant get a tan when she puts it on!!
B009230GNW|5|Fabric soft, hangs loose which is a plus since I do not like tight sweaters, extremely comfortable, light weight but warm. True to size.  Cowl neck fits perfectly.  Very pretty with jeans or slacks.  Very good quality product.  Worth the money.  This is the second Design History Women's  sweater I have purchased and I am very happy with both purchases.  Will look for more sweaters from this manufacturer.
B00NF3WGSS|4|The shirt is really cute, the graphic is very bright and colorful. It definitely runs small though. A 2X should fit better than this does. After washing it will probably only get a couple uses as it's sure to shrink. But it's well priced and shipping time is decent.
B00OA0XX64|5|It's so soft and this is the only thing my baby won't be able get it off
B001H0F6GU|5|Good cheap lounging pants.
B000MX3QXS|1|This item was definitely mislabeled for size.  I've purchased this same bra from a few vendors off amazon & this is the first time it has drastically not even come close to correct size.  I had my mom try it on too as she has a smaller bust than me & it was too small for her as well.
B00F9SEL5I|1|TOO SMALL!!!!!!
B0069J5B6O|5|This fits perfectly true to size! It looks SO cute on and it looks good with a lot of my shirts... I got it in Java. It has really thin, even, well colored, material which is perfect for summer. Perfect skirt for so many occasions, I's both modest and sexy.
B00BJOGOQ0|5|Great fabric--a liittle large but my fault--I ordered extra large.  Came on time. Fine pajamas! Needed to shorten them but  no problem. As promised! Sherry Cohen
B00EAEBF06|5|I live all these tops. Every single one fits me beautifully. Keep them all coming! I can't wait for more styles.
B00DNGZ2R4|5|Thank you! it's just what I needed!
B000UPVCPW|5|wife looked great in it
B00HF4KNVK|2|Don't like the material,
B00CRRUG8U|5|Love this shirt. I am going to buy a few more because it fits me very well and look muscular.
B00J9APBWY|4|great
B0047588IU|5|This is a nice cheap tutu that looks like the picture and went fantastic with my costume.  The elastic is extremely stretchy so it fits a large number of sizes. I wear a 12 and it fit me fine.
B000MCQGM2|4|Nice heavyweight material.  Embroidery did not shrink in wash.  Overall a good shirt.
B00E3FNL5O|4|Nice skirt. Fit perfectly. I received many compliments.
B0017T51ZW|5|A+++++++
B00AHEB9LI|5|Yes, I ordered this to match Sherlock's blue scarf.  Granted it's not the exact scarf but the color is very close!  I'm not a cosplayer but will through in fandom pieces to my wardrobe here and there.
B005MH8SEG|5|These are a great quality for the price. I looked for something similar and the price was over $20. I was happy to find these!
B00C7XIIHA|5|32x32<br />Classy yet rugged. Optimal pair of jeans. One small detail worth mentioning is they are advertised as 78% cotton, however, after inspecting the tags I discovered the jeans are actually 98% cotton. No matter though, indeed, I prefer them this way. It allows for the perfect shrinkage in the pant length after the first wash/dry cycle.
B0054RDCAY|3|i am 170 pound and 6.2 it is good quality material and fitting will but  you cant see any throw it in the gloomy place or night clubs
B004A9XVMG|5|I love the outfit. Like how you can mix and match and looks like good quality materials. Would recommend to anyone.
B00L21DGJI|1|It doesn't have a shape! Im shapely but this looks like a blanket over you!
B00A3HG8AG|5|Good enough for my husband.
B00DTQVBA0|2|The headpiece is way to big for a newborn. It is really cute and had some great shots. Wish the head piece wasn't so big.
B00KLJUC1M|5|Great shirt! Fits a little bit larger than most shirts, but that's ok. Would rather have a little bit too big than too small.
B00KCIF46A|1|The underwire started poking out within the first 2 hours of wearing it. I am returning this item.
B00NILKAVM|1|Way too short and cheaply made. A consignment shop wouldn't even take it.
B007FLGEW0|5|Very lightweight and compact but sturdy. I feel efficient! And I like that it has a story behind it and is from Maine!
B00CUK9X42|5|Great color-material.
B00CXTD3BO|5|i  purchase them all the time they are the most comfortable and doup extremely well in the laundry and last a long time ,I highly recommend,I will be buying more this is my third time i have purchased Nautica socks love them.
B00GJZSU70|5|You really can't argue with the price, it's made of pretty thin metal but it's thick enough to allow you to shape it to your face without issue. I wear glasses, so I had to sew my frame to the corner of the eyes and the bridge of the glasses to the middle piece by the nose. It worked perfectly and stayed on for the few hours I needed it too, plus it looked pretty alright too. Overall, would buy again.
B00JQWEK8G|5|Super cute. Highly recommended !
B00CAXRBHK|5|Fits like a Hanes boxer brief should
B000CNOBXW|5|I utilized this neck strap to hold my camera while on a recent trip to Colorado, and really appreciated it.  It did its job very well.
B005N5DGNK|5|Excellent
B00ETSR5AC|5|This jacket has the basic features I need but they're all upgraded - the powder skirt has a snap to keep it out of the way when you don't use it, the front zip opens from the top and bottom so you're more comfortable when you're sitting on the lift.  The underarm zips are easy to reach.  The pocket for your music is just inside the main zip but covered/protected and has the gap to feed headphones<br /><br />The fit is perfect - enough shape so I still look like a girl even with layers underneath, but I can move and it's not too tight.  If you have Volcom pants you can zip them to the jacket (and unzip them easily when you go inside for a bathroom break.)  I got the pink and it's bright but not harsh. The hood is \\"helmet-friendly\\" but it's not removable. It's pricey but a great jacket.
B00DB73VK0|5|A little expensive, but the best running socks on the market.
B000HTKB30|5|Awesome fit.
B005ISEX6G|5|It fits perfectly. I am a Chun Li fan and my friends liked it. I recommend this shirt for any Street Fighter fans or fighting games in general.
B00JWG0F9O|5|Perfect
B00F0CTN10|5|I love Patty clothing her styles are different and this blouse is no different love the detail on the front. I have so much of her clothing my closet is full. I have noticed from buying so much of her clothing that some run small and some are right with the chart. This one runs a bit small I ware a med and I order a large and that was smart of me.
B0007QMK4G|5|The Flexees garment does exactly what I expected it to do. It holds in the mid-section area very well. The garment is also comfortable and very flexible. I think as long as you order the right size, the garment will feel comfortable. I would suggest ordering a size up from your regular shirt size so the garment can bend and move without rising up on you. I highly recommend it.
B00LSEGFCE|5|Gorgeous leggings, vibrant color~<br />Always pleased with this company!<br />Prompt service, products always as advertised.
B001MFK8G8|5|It's my second one. It fits great, even under my motorcycle helmet.
B0030W2XA0|3|These arm-warmers are very small for an adult arm, very tight.  The quality is very good, tho, and they are warm.  I'm keeping them in hopes of them stretching out a little after a few washings, just letting others know they run pretty small. :(
B0069I9G20|5|I bought many hats for my sister going through chemo treatments and this was one of her favorites. It fit  well and looked good. The ruffles help give the appearance of some volume in that area.
B00EFW9XNO|5|VERY NICE
B005V7KHCI|3|The mask performed as expected, creeping people out, no, I don't know why a rabbit would creep people out.  The only compliant is, although the eye holes are placed inconspicuously, they are too low.  It's was only slightly awkward.
B009Y9QBYW|5|Wow! Great quality and comfortable. I can't beat the price.
B007CFD6PW|5|work very well
B00C2DJ8YC|1|I sent it back, I am a 40 waist and I failed to look at the fittitng diagram. so I am waiting on a bigger sized one
B002BGNK7Q|5|Well... I'll be darned! I guess it's G-O-O-D that this picture looks SO0oo bad, because, it<br />reminds ME to remind YOU to remember to match YOUR skin with the color of the mask.<br />It fits MY head like a glove, but I have a big head[7.5]. If you have a smaller head, say a<br />size 7 cap, you MIGHT consier some liquid latex, or spirit gum to make sure you look A+!<br />I like to dress up for Halloween---see my Profile Photo... I'm nearly seven-feet tall with<br />my lifted biker-boots, so I prefer my Frankenstein mask.<br />Zagone makes great masks for your head... and even hand masks!<br /><br />Happy Hallowe'en Boils and Ghouls!
B003XT6BG2|5|This shirt has great colors with a soft cotton feel.  The sizes do run a bit smaller than normal.  I wear mostly large and it was a little tight on me.  If you're on the boarder with sizes like I am, I would recommend getting a size up.  The quality of the shirt seems good.  It's been washed and still looks as good as the day I bought it.
B001LNB10I|5|This costume is amazing.  I bought it for my son who is in college.  Everyone who saw him in it loved it.
B00QE5ZU7I|3|The only reason it fit as expected is because I read the reviews on sizing before purchasing this product. Based on others' experiences I ordered a size 4/5 years for my 2-year-old and it fit perfectly. So please do yourselves a favor and read the reviews before ordering this product or you will have a very disappointed child. Otherwise, this is a lovely dress and was the perfect addition to my daughter's Peppa Pig birthday party!
B0087S3IZG|1|Its a very big size. Totally useless for me now
B00ISQ33E8|5|Its an awesome shirt and my favorite shirt ever. I want to wear it everyday but I can't. Only once a week. They forgot to mention it is from Bethesda the Official site.
B0080C71ZM|5|What a great idea! Socks that stay on babies little feet! These socks work really well. They stay on her feet even when she kicks.
B003XG7UBK|5|This veil is absolutely lovely! The colors are rich, the silk is flawless, smooth, light, and glossy- unlike many other silk dancing veils I've seen that are more of a gauzy texture. It floats and flutters like a dream! I was uncertain about buying this at first, but now that it's arrived, it has exceeded all of my expectations and I couldn't be happier. I absolutely recommend this veil- in any of the available colors, not just the &#34;sinful&#34; coloring.
B0051D85KS|1|The outfit I received is not the outfit that was pictured.  I received a hot pink, black, and gray leopard print outfit that was very ugly.  The fit and quality are great, but it is U-G-L-Y.  The outfit pictured isn't exactly \\"cute\\", but babyhaven is such a reputable brand and the price was so good that I thought why not.  There is a reason the price was sooo low.  BEWARE!!!
B00KGITVX8|3|The jacket looks nice and fits good. Below 30s, you'd definitely need a fleece inside, this isn't warm enough. Returned it after using it for a week or so as I found the feather annoying. A jacket of this price should be stitched tight.
B00OC35GVE|5|Love it
B00LUNNE0O|3|Firstly, let me start by saying that I am not that huge fan of winter caps. They make me look weird. So when this turban style was out on deal on Amazon, I was impressed and thought will give it a try. Unfortunately, the cap had some weird defect and would not fit properly on my head and I ended up returning it. I am still going to go with 3 stars because of the wool material which was quite thick and would definitely have worked in snow as well. The embellishment was not that great but its not a deal breaker.
B00IPIGW74|2|My usual size was way too small. Like it was sized wrong or something.
B003KQ696A|3|It's just a little tighter than I would like and I am really stretching it to pull it down over my ears and the back of my neck when it gets really cold. Also , make it a little thicker with a denser weave. What we need is a super duty wigwam mill watch cap.
B00XMIWH9Y|2|My first and most pressing complaint is that I ordered the light purple color of this swimsuit and received a bright pink. It isn't even a purple-pink but straight up pink which isn't exactly what I wanted but I decided I could live with it. My next problem came along when I realized that the cup size of this bra had to be a triple D, because it is quite large on me (I'm a double D). The bottoms, however are rather small. They're tight around the waist area and squeeze my stomach in, making me look a bit lumpier than I am. I've decided that the suit is still wearable, but not at all what I was expecting to receive. Yet another little annoying issue is that the black lining on the bottom part of the top keeps folding under the suit, causing it to look strange. All I can say for this product is that if you're okay with receiving not exactly what you want but still Along the lines of it, and aren't too picky about what you're receiving then this should be fine.
B008P7ZD66|5|This cardigan is adorable!  Just what I was looking for!  As another reviewer mentions, it is long sleeved, but you can easily roll the sleeves up to create the look the model is wearing.  Well worth the price!
B0043VDJJQ|5|This was a Christmas gift for my wife.  My wife is short, so I opted for the shorter robe instead of the full-length.  She loved the robe, it keeps her nice and warm.  It is nice and comfortable and appears to wash just fine, no problems at all!
B001M0A2U0|5|Cool shirt
B00HLDODJS|3|the neck is a bit tight, and it's not easy to let it fall off the shoulder, as in the picture.
B00RNWL4PI|4|I like it, but will need a smaller size.
B0129CYEEY|5|Very flattering super cute swimsuit. Fits perfect. Washes well. Highly recommended.
B008VT4NR8|3|Thin hoodie like I wanted but runs real small. Doesn't feel as high quality as most original penguins to me do.
B00TQMXJE2|5|I like it very much. I was initially surprised by the detailing on the back.  It's subtle and a really nice design feature. I almost didn't get this shirt and I'm glad I did.
B00M747R62|5|My wife has no complaints :)
B00UV4T0NS|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Bought a size SMALL and have plenty of room.  Use this shirt to work in the garden as it is cool and lightweight.  I also like the snaps--easy in and easy off.
B00EMG3UPU|5|Don't freak, but I use these for my dogs. They wear baby diapers in public so we don't have messes. I use the Onesies to help keep the diapers on and covered, just like you do a baby. Amanda, my dog, LOVES them!! She loves to play dress up and look all pretty and get handed around when we go out and it's because she's the belle of the ball. The fit is high on the sides where her legs are and makes it really comfy and I know it would be for a baby too. Either way, dog or human, it's a GREAT product. (My boys dogs love theirs too!)
B0057LQVSM|5|I ordered an xxl and I'm a size 18 and this shirt fits better than I thought it would! I was nervous at first but it goes over my hips and my butt and hangs it doesn't suction to my body. I'm 5'8&#34; and it hits me mid calf and looks great under my tunic sweaters and long coats! I already ordered two more colors and the tank tops from this brand as well! Big girls don't be afraid of ordering this item!
B008IGH3LW|4|I ordered a 25 but they run a little short. I'm 5' 7 125 and the jeans are really cute but they stop above my ankle.
B005S6ALY6|5|These shoes are perfect.  They are just what we were looking for and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking.
B00AHOQBD4|5|Very nice for granddaughter. These came on time and will be great for baby  in this cold weather.good quality for good price
B00I0N0YJQ|4|This dress is beautiful, with brilliant burnt orange color that would flatter any complexion; however the dress tends to run a bit large.  For comparison, I am 5'3&#34;, 105 lbs., with a 36-C chest. I almost always wear a size Medium in Billibong dresses of this style, usually to accommodate for my bra size, but this dress was surprisingly big, baggy, and long.  Even with its straps adjusted to their tightest and wearing an amply padded bra, the front was still billowy, and length was nearly to my knee.  I will reorder in a XSmall.  Perhaps this product shrinks, because I noticed the washing instructions say not to put this in a dryer.  Fabric contents are: 50% Cotton, 50% Modal, and the dress was made in India. Cotton shrinks a little bit, but modal is a type of rayon, which is supposedly resistant to shrinkage and fading. It would probably shrink minimally, but not enough to fit me.
B00NJRXSTG|5|It was a Christmas gift - she loved the color and the flowing fit. The knit is soft and not clingy. As the giver - I loved the price.
B00FXLNU1M|2|These took a long time to arrive and they are way too small.  I usually wear an 8 and I order the largest size they had and they are TOO SMALL!
B008NA9C2G|5|Have the 2T for my daughter to wear now, and just bought the 3T for next winter. Great relaxed fit, and extremely warm. My daughter loves this jacket. Goes with everything, and is really versatile. The exterior of the jacket protects her from cold rain, sleet, and snow. The interior of the jacket is lined in fleece around the chest and back, and inside the hood as well. Perfect weight for our extremely cold Ohio winters. Returned two other ski jackets (Obermeyer and Spyder) for this! Love it!
B004NQSXD8|5|irregular sizing, off center image and running dye. You'll look great standing next to your Lada while waiting for a tow truck. added bonus! when you turn it inside out, you get an image of Che!
B0018Q37JQ|4|great everyday dress pants.
B009GSO23S|5|I bought a few of these shirts for a recent trip.  I got tons of compliments.  They are true to size, don't shrink and are thick well made.
B001GANVCM|5|This runs big for it's \\"size\\" (our son is HUGE, but it was bigger than the equivalently sized clothing he fit in at the time).  It is heavy duty and good quality.  Looks very nice, but almost a tad bit TOO dressy.  It is great for super-fancy occasions (i.e. weddings, funerals), but might be a bit much for anything less formal.  We ended up getting a different tie to \\"lighten\\" it up a bit.  Very pleased, though, overall, even though it was a bit pricey.
B00884DAIY|5|Made a Mary Poppins outfit and after taking the flowers off the rim and replacing with ribbons it was Perfect
B002NPCJ5E|5|These are just regular underpants. I thought they was training pants because that's what I searched for but they are just regular underpants. Good quality though nothing differnt from what you can pick up in walmart or kmart for the same price.
B00HPQIFBS|5|Loved it
B00NHIDRG6|3|I wear a 2, ordered a small. It's tight, no good for work.  I'll keep it for evening.
B00NZ4EOS2|5|Loved these - very comfortable and nice, bought another pack of 3!
B0009MZYEQ|5|These are wonderful socks, I have ordered quite a few pairs for my husband. He loves them. They are true to size and very comfortable. They wear very well.
B00KSVIX5A|5|fine
B00MHDY70M|5|Love the material!

B004Y538PG|5|Booties that are easy to get on and actually stay on!
B00826ZYUA|5|love these shirts
B00GAZYW2G|5|Great
B002QHIO4O|4|I have looked in every store for Flexees; but no one has them.....I love the style and the fit....Thank you for your prompt delivery.....
B00H57YK0W|5|my son likes this wallet he collects different color he got 4 already
B00Y9LEISG|5|Very good
B007KFZEP4|4|I like it, did the measurements as suggested to find the correct size but I think I could have gone a cup size smaller.
B00M27Z7UW|5|Love it! Could use one in every color!
B0094G8RKQ|4|I read all the comments, and my expectations were realigned. The undershirt is okay to throw on if I were painting or working out, but it's crap. The over shirt was very good though. I fit into a US size M (6/8) and the small was nearly perfect on me, the sleeves fell to a little past my elbow, I pull it above my elbow and the trim is a little tight. I have broader shoulders than this model, and my under shirt would not be able to be seen. Over all I like the look on myself. If you want the shirt to look the way it does on the model get the size you usually wear, just know it runs big, and you'll have to tuck the front in a little, it's the same length front and back.
B003379XL4|3|See review for 767.  Actually bought both to see which would work best.  This one slightly better but basically same issues.  Use all slots and will not close.  Closes better than 767, but not by much.  Plastic inserts really cheap.  This one lasted only 4 days before one tore off.  Slots slightly bigger but still tight but easier to find/access.  Better ID slots as same size as wallet.  Bill area same as 767, too shallow.  Overall, I'm going with this one as it folds better and easier to find/access cards.
B00BJ5GJJ6|5|The size large for my 10 year old fit great.  She loves wearing it under her dance costumes and makes her more comfortable to change in a dressing room with other girls.
B00IZQCS38|5|I purchased this beanie of Count Customs for my Mom. She loves anything of Count Customs Gear. She loves the fit and the design of the beanie as well. Perfect gift for any Count Customs Fan.
B008MLZ662|5|I love this shirt, it fits to size well and was worth the price. Would definitely let my girlfriends know about this brand!
B00421HIRQ|5|I bought these for my mother as a house-warming gifts of sorts and she loves them.  The theme was immediately close to her heart, but they are also the only house socks she has ever continued to wear.
B00KH6K0FM|5|Very Detailed, light-weight. Recommended if you're The Elder Scrolls fan.
B00L9TFKXS|1|Didn't fit.  Beware of sizing.
B00K1KZA4K|5|Love is beautiful
B000SQYYJY|1|Iresponsable , sanga costumes never send me the right costume , and when i send a letter they never answer me. the worst seller of amazon
B009YPX1LW|4|Very happy with the high quality of these shirts. Much better than the JC penny shirts I have been wearing,
B00X76NIZS|4|Very comfortable. I like the pocket most pants don't have that.
B00M597PJI|2|item smaller than what size indicated
B0061YLUX0|4|nice, loose fitting swim shirt for a toddler. true to size and good quality for the price. would recommend this product.
B00NHDJL0C|1|Run large and need to return.
B00FDQC8OM|5|My son loves it. Looks great and fits very well. Great product, will buy more.
B00TJXVM7O|3|The large size says waist 36-38, but I'm a 36 and this is pretty small on me.  I'd recommend going with the extra large if you are in the 36-38 range.
B001DTV14Q|4|My daughter needed this for an expelorers project for her class. Each kid had to research, write a report on, then present dressed up as the explorer they researched. We used this for Vasco Nunez De Balboa and it worked great. It was a bit loose for a 10 year old's head but not so much it covered her eyes or anything. It would easily fit an adult. Great for a costume, dress up or project such as my daughters.
B00QNQP9FQ|4|Love it
B009O94BAI|5|Nice fabric, good design, great quality. Seat well on body even when you dive from a cliff. Definitely recommend to buy it.
B000OAY1CO|4|Great jeasn. Several years of loyal service and good wear
B00OPQW6V6|4|We ordered a custom gown because we didn't like the standard lace up backed dress.  We were a little confused about when we would receive the dress as we received different emails that reflected different dates.  We were pleasantly surprised to receive the custom sized dress in only a couple weeks!  We measured my daughter very carefully, including height with heels, because we were told that custom dresses are non-returnable.  The dress arrived VERY close to size but still needed to have it taken in 2&#34; across the back.<br /><br />Still, a great deal for a beautiful dress.
B00JG3DX6U|5|According to the measurements, i should have ordered a Medium. I went along with everyone's reviews and ordered a size up. The large fits really nicely. I feel like if I ordered a medium it would've felt like a sausage casing- no way of knowing though. I'm 5'1&#34;, 122 lbs. The quality is realy nice- it's got a heavy well made feel to it. Very similar to Herve Leger dresses. This was worth the money! Can't wait to wear it out!
B001LN2IH8|5|Michael Kors has it all with this Austin small handbag. Style and function. I love this handbag because it holds everything I need but is small enough to carry and set down without getting in the way. Perfect strap changes from crossbody to shoulder. Excellent outside compartments for small items you need often. No digging through contents every time you need keys or cell phone. Leather is soft and comfortable against your body.
B00W3JJOJ4|1|Bottoms were too small, top was too big. The boob cups were way too far apart, and floppy. My boobs would have flown out of this thing. Couldn't wear it.
B000EGZCA8|4|Like noted in other reviews, the hood liner color is a little off, but otherwise it's a great Harry Potter robe.
B00MGJPJE0|5|I Looove this company! I am absolutely fabulous in their outfits! I look so good I can't stand it! 💋 kiss myself.
B009FV9L14|5|Love it fits very nice
B0057X9LXC|5|This is a good quality work shirt, I like to have a shirt with a breast pocket and it can be hard to find a good one. These don't shrink up like the other brands I've tried (Russel, FruitLoom, others). The only (minor) negative point is they seem to run a tad large. This is much better than running a tad small, or shrinking after a few washes so I don't mind so much. You might want to try a size smaller if you (like me) are used to buying a larger size anticipating some shrinkage.
B00MO72QV8|5|Compact, nicely made.
B003IC7KD2|4|I loved the costume. It has great colors and fit perfect (I am usually a 3 in dress) This is a small even though it says (4-6). The wig could have had more yarn to it, after wearing it looked like I was balding in spots but it's just not very full at the bottom. The wig was also hard to untangle. The gloves were cute and fit perfect. Overall I really liked the costume, only thing I would suggest is improving the wig.
B00I2T0I4Y|5|My girlfriend is 4' 9&#34; but well endowed so I initially ordered the medium. Whoops, WAY too big. However it fit me fine. I then ordered the Extra Small and it fit her perfectly. In fact the fabric was quite a bit nicer than the first one, VERY plush and elegant. But I kept the larger one for me so now we both parade around at night in our pink fluffy robes. It's more seductive than you might think!
B00CBG98HM|5|Cool color!
B00MW8JEYQ|5|Very soft and comfy.
B004EOBDIQ|2|The fit and color are great. The only disappointment is that it came with a white string and it is shown with a black string which looks much better. Would not have ordered it had it been shown with the white.
B00IZMVXOM|5|The colors on this swimsuit are vibrant.  The swimsuit fits perfectly.  It was helpful reading other reviews before buying this swimsuit.  I was unsure of the size needed to purchase.  After reading, I ordered the correct size.  I have had compliments on the design and fit of the suit.  I would definitely recommend this swimsuit.
B00K5RNYHE|5|Love it.
B00YD8VRLG|3|Overall the wallet serves its purpose. Especially if your like me and hate clutter. But it wasn't all what I expected it to be.
B00B7QIJUO|2|Different than what I expected usable
B00S1K6O7E|5|Teenage boy loves it
B006PI0IUI|3|While this is the year 2014, I do occasionally carry actual, physical dollar bills around with me, so I was disappointed in the size of this product. I just assumed anything that calls itself a wallet would be able to hold money without having to be folded over twice to fit. You could carry a couple large bills, but anymoret than 3-4 bills makes the wallet nearly too fat to close (full of cards, of course).<br /><br />That said, it does fit nicely in my pocket and seems quite durable so far.
B00DVGIDYA|5|I Ordered &#34;One Size&#34; id say this is a about a 0-8 I wear a large and about a 10-12 Yes VERY Very tight... But I expected this fit..  Very Nice though I love it..
B00S283WTS|5|Served its purpose beautifully ;)
B008I582CW|4|These shorts have a nice feel to them.The material is light enough for the up coming hot days of summer.The length is perfect for me,although the fit is a bit large on me. Pockets to carry all your phones, i-pods and wallets.
B00FDUWQP4|5|I love it and use it all the time. I have no complaints. It's comfortable and easy to keep on.
B00NYX8UAW|5|The materials is far better quality than I expected.<br />Note that this does not come with the rods, I suggest going to a home improvement store and buying 1/4 inch dowel rods to go down the premade slits on the sides.<br />I've attached a picture of the kids size gold one next to the adult sized white and rainbow ones.<br />I'm 5'3&#34; and the kids size comes to mid calf. The adult size drags on the floor just a bit.<br />The collar is not really much smaller than the adult size. I've always had to take in the collar on the adult sizes since they're so big.
B00EZBX2UA|1|I bought my husband an xxl which is what he wears and it doesn't even come close to fitting him. Very disappointed.
B003BYGMLI|3|A couple of beads fell off of it as soon as I took it out of the package. But it is a beautiful piece to add to any belly dancing costume.
B00GWKIMK2|3|Love the look of this jacket but it came with a button hole not sewn (I fixed it) and its too tight in the back. I kept it tho as love the look.. Its pretty cheap tho
B005UOLLPO|5|I gave these scrubs this rating because they are good. Made out of durable material. Big pockets and roomy enough for me, as I am slightly bodacious. My mom bought these for me because I am in nursing school and the scrubs they supply were either like a tent or a tube. I recommend these scrubs to either gender. Not a disappointment.
B00J7RKZ5M|5|This dress is very form fitting and runs small it didn't fit me so I gave it to my niece.
B00PIAPQUG|1|Too small and won't stay on.
B000ROFZCW|5|I bought this for my granddaughter for Halloween and she really like it. It was described just as advertised and the price is great!
B002DTZ1NW|5|I absolutely love this jacket.  I went to an outing at the country club and everyone kept commenting on how nice this sport coat was.  I took it to the tailor and had it tightened up a lil so it didn't have that off the rack look and the desired look was surely achieved.
B007IY97U0|5|It came in two days earlier than except. I'm happy about that and it is amazing! Better than I could have ever imagine! It is very soft and doesn't feel like I have it on. Very very happy about this!
B000SP7QEU|1|This was an adorable costume for my little one, but it didn't last for the first wearing.  There are two zippers on the front that are very flimsy.  I tried it on my baby for the first time, and one zipper broke off on the first zip up.  The second time I tried it on, the second zipper broke off too.  I had to pin it to make it work for Halloween.  The tag says it fits 12-24 months, which is way off. My baby was 6 months (and in the 10% for height) and just fit the costume lenght-wise.
B00LV0WZWE|5|Super cute outfit and it fits great!
B008TOTVEU|5|It's great to wear around the house instead of letting the girls hang free! It's comfy and I can even sleep in it
B00D9S87FA|4|I really liked it, the color is good and the leather is nice quality too. Also is very confortable and thin, some times I don´t even feel it on my pocket!
B00G9YT4HQ|5|Loved the colors on these and they fit really well. I have smaller feet size 7.5, and it they fit like a glove. Fabric was extremely comfortable as well. Would definitely buy more in the future.
B00AZORMDY|5|Whatever you've imagined this as...it is better than that! Seriously I EFFING LOVE SCARVES and this is my favorite! Just give them your money and be done with it!
B00PK732DA|5|EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED
B001T68IJE|5|Comfortable, esp after one washing.  Shaping is very nice - separation, but still minimized a bit (which is good for me!). No extra material, hopefully it will be cool this summer.
B008NE2P8A|5|This veil is perfect! After getting the wrinkles steamed out it fell perfectly, beautiful veil, no complaints! For the price it's an awesome deal! It's not cheap looking, it looks like the veils that run $120 in davids bridal! Happy with my purchase.
B002ITVQNQ|2|It was essentially a women's wig :-/. Perhaps ladies man wig meant man cross-dressed as a lady wig.<br /><br />I guess i shouldn't have expect it to be high quality given its price, but at least a male wig like it claims.
B00AQU2H9G|5|No more rummaging through my purse to find items. An idea whos' time has come! I definitely recommend this product...
B00M0G736G|5|nice quality and fast shipping!!
B00AJWZ11M|5|my baby like it
B00NTU6L8S|1|PLEASE DO NOT BUY, horrible quality.    I never bought a dress w/ this quality! Even after reading all the bad reviews, I gave it a benefit of the doubt and still ordered. Wow! So so bad.    I'm 5'2 and weigh 107 so I fit into most extra small but this one was way too small. After I put on the dress, I couldnt take it off so I had to literally rip the dress apart to get out.  The quality was so poor that ripping was easy to do...so guess thats a plus.    Please dont waste your money.
B005B8J5TI|5|Not as sturdy as expected but it is nice. Arrive quickly and shipped securely. I use this regularly and have no complants.<br />UPDATE: 10-20-13<br />Still using it and just as strong as the first day. Lasted longer then I expected. Very happy!
B002R0FG3M|1|none
B00JHZSVYG|3|i am usually a size 6 (36B) and I ordered the Large.  I could have ordered a size down and i think it would have fit better.  the definitely couldn't fill out the top and returned it.
B00945PCFA|4|Cool shirt.  Quick shipping.  Ordered an extra large and it fits a little too tight for my liking, so -1 star for that.
B00C9TMASA|5|excellent
B00G28G6U2|1|The hat is different colors than what is shown in the photo.
B00JLFF07I|5|Came in on time and fits well
B00IDMVHU4|5|Love this tie very stylish!
B00K4X29U2|5|very nice item
B00MH6FX70|5|Very confy and soft material
B00HCDDXPM|3|Pretty but a little boxy
B00GDDAUN0|5|Fantastic hat my co-workers loved it.got lots of compliments.wore it on my last day at work,when i retirerd.i told them werto order it on amazon.com
B000UJCFC2|5|Really nice wood iphone case I bought for my husband he loves it and it fit perfect.
B00I14CN34|5|Love it
B00HSCBLW4|5|Great present!
B00C99QBU8|5|I love it lol its simple but cute n the sizes for the shirt is perfect :) n awesome..... yup
B003UJQQJC|5|This is a very well made hat and shades my 2 1/2 yr old grand daughter's face nicely. It's just large enough to last through a couple more years ...
B0002TW5IO|5|I love these pants. They are very comfortable and the elastic waistband isn't as tight as my other Tiger Claw pants. The waffle fabric is soft and will get softer the more they are washed. The only negative is that there is a Tiger Claw logo embroidered on the right thigh. I never buy clothes with logos, so if I had the option, I would oder the pants sans logo.
B008M10GWQ|4|A good common sense hat void of any foolish advertisements.
B003ILBZZC|5|It's snug, but that's what I wanted.  I'm about 5'6&#34; and 145 lbs with short legs, long torso  - I got a medium for wearing with a long shirt-dress and boots.  The length is just right for me - I think it might be short on a longer-legged woman.  I could have gone with a large if I wanted a loose feel, but this is perfect for what I was after.  Great price, very happy.
B00BVQCZCI|5|A little small, but super cute!
B00TT2S962|4|Great stretchy, sexy tunic blouse!!
B00A17K110|5|A well known brand, and always good quality. Very pleased with them. Good fit, comfortable. Plus I like low rise.
B00CS5AWRQ|5|Costume is perfect! Color, material, fit eeverything is great! And best of all the price is awesome!! Thanks!
B0086SC2LS|5|These arrived a lot quicker than I thought - 2 weeks (since shipping estimated about a month). Such quick delivery!<br /><br />For the price, the quality of this wig is unbeatable! It's very soft and has an amazing bounce!<br /><br />When you first get the wig, style it!! The wig comes set up with very nice curls and give it a nice layer of hairspray to keep them intact! Taking the wig on and off will definitely tangle and mess up curls for any un-styled wig. The color is a bit hard to see in the dark, but in the light - they have such a rich purple color! Got a lot of compliments wearing this wig!
B007W4I6CG|3|the picture looks like it would be wider but for larger chests the coverage is lacking. otherwise they seem well made
B00S75WRVU|3|A little bit small to size but still good quality
B005F50IWK|5|After amazon messed up my order I had to reorder a Halloween costume last minute and I was scared at first to order from this seller because i thought it wouldnt reach in time for Halloween but after receiving my package within 2 days before Halloween  I was so happy because I was  very satisfied. I am 5'4 and weigh 125 and the small was perfect. I love this costume it fits so perfect only thing the neck piece is tight but thats ok. I would recommend this to anyone
B00DPY6EQ2|1|Returned. At least 2 sizes too small and rides up.
B0076R6NSI|5|Love it, good price!
B00F8D640E|4|Was what I expected to show up.
B0019VFOC8|4|OK, wore this as a chaperone to my kids HS senior party complete with sleeve tats and black accessories. Most everyone knew right away I was Ozzy, though some thought Howard Stern, which I could see too. Anyway, looked great right out of the package
B004XXUXLQ|5|What more can I say than these on my long legged partner YUMMMMM!!!!!!!!<br />Both she and i love them.  Great buy
B002BFNKOK|5|I love this fleece and have several in different colors.  They are very comfortable and wash up really nice.  They are great to wear as a little extra something around the house in the winter or something to wear on a chilly day in the summer.  Great for all year around use, wears really nicely, washing great -- win win all the way around.
B0017JTGPI|5|This robe is extremely elagant and beautiful for it's price.  You can put any woman in it and they instantly feel the soft caress of the silk and fall in love with it.  I think it is more than worth it to get this item!
B000GHMSAW|3|Too small
B003FP9X50|5|bought for the hubby during True Blood season.  it's comfy, fits well, and is casual enough to wear as a layering piece, a work out shirt, etc.
B004MVKTGI|5|I love it.
B00CSKBVIK|4|the quality of the product is great... i am 5'2 and 125 lbs and i usually wear a small in most cloth lines.. since this is juniors fit , thought i will go with medium...but medium turned out to be a bit loose...but good enough to wear... so i am going to keep it... i would say just go with your regular size ..the length of the shirt seems to be a bit on the longer side.. for my height ;) overall its a good quality t shirt...go for it...
B0042GNH9Y|4|Dress was great quality, but fit a little small!
B0041L35SI|5|I bought this for my mom and she loves it!! I bought a larger size because I past reviews and so glad I did because it does run small. She loves everything about it.
B00VV2G94C|3|Bottoms fit great top is awkward
B00I3MES5U|1|It's too small and the tag for the size has been cut
B005CSOZGA|5|I really wanted an oversized sweatshirt. I'm a 5'10 woman and I got a 3xxx.  It was really big at first but seems to shrink a bit after a wash or two. I think it's perfect now. Super comfy
B00LI0A9AM|4|The shirt is SUPER CUTE!! The quality is OK. It is not T-shirt material, something like pajama material. I can tell this item runs pretty small. My daughter wears a 2T but I have purchased Disney things before and always order a size 4. The 4 looks more like a 2T/3T, just for your reference. Overall all, I give it a 4 because it is still a great shirt for your pint sized Frozen fan!!
B004MKN1GE|5|This is so sexy. What more could I ask for. Hook and eye all the way up the back. Tricky to put on, just glad I'm not the one putting it on.
B0014M0B98|5|I ordered this for my son to dress up as Dr. Suess for a project at school. I ordered it and requested expedited shipping. I received it the next day as requested. The only disappointment was it was only the beard, but that was a misunderstanding on my part. I would order again.
B0090QHCWY|5|I got the grey.  It is from arizona jean company. I was a little worried about sizing when i ordered a small.  but it the size is just right.  I am exactly 5 feet, this fits perfectly.  It also came very quickly, i ordered it at midnight on 2/20 and it came by 2/23.
B0025T6KVC|5|This pretty floral print defines your diva status. Allover print tunic with a solid round neckline, full sleeves, and designer print in the front and the same design runs straight in both side of the sleeves to give it a finished look.
B00B7E2FZQ|4|Good product, timely delivery, and good fit.  Seems true to size.
B00A353ZMM|5|My husband loves them.  A little style with his comfort.
B002B9FHRE|1|These are so tight on my ankles and legs I have to return them. It's like wearing a bunch of tight rubber bands on your legs. The leg portion is also too short. I have used Dickies Steel Toe socks for years but these are nothing like my previous pairs which are very comfortable and wear like iron. Something has changed in their design but not for the better.
B00FRROV7O|5|This was a great deal and is a great product. Fits well, lays nice, and I will likely be buying another one in a different color.
B003EEMBMY|5|They fit true to size! Great quality! My granddaughter loves them!
B00NJ8FSHA|5|Wife loves wearing it. Soft material. Go Arsenal!
B00GKGX8CK|3|okay
B00DRNGMZO|1|Washed them in hot water to shrink them, should have ordered the large Insteed, but that's ok. I love these socks, very comfortable with my lace up boots for riding on my harley. Keeps my feet warm at night. I will be ordering a lot more
B00E1IG6FK|5|I love this dress, this dress is gorgeous. So many compliments on it. Two thumbs-up for the shipping, in which it arrived earlier than expected and the material of the dress. Awesome!!!
B0082RZG9I|2|Bad quality stretched and faded after about three washings. The design is cute but it just wont last long sadly.
B00KGE0CDU|3|I really don't like the fit on my daughter. She normally wears a size 10/12 but based on reviews, I bought a size bigger. Not too flattering on her. Well will keep it and just get another coat.
B00GHQZSS0|4|Actually got them for my son shoe size 5 in kids and they fit perfect for him and should be good for a while.
B00J3U6TI0|5|I got this for his summer pictures. The red really worked well along with balloons we had in the background. The shorts are the right length and the shirt covers his belly, unlike some others in this size.
B00CGW7TM2|4|Love them! The stitching is less than stellar (loose), but not a huge deal. I'm 6'2 and thin, got a large and they are perfect.
B004XLYVAW|5|i really like the design of this coat.  i've been using this coat for over a month and i'm very pleased of how warm it is.  i' m lived in south korea where winter weather is brutally cold and windy but this coat kept me warm.  the only thing i somewhat dislike about this coat is the hood is too big.  there's no drawstring to make is smaller but i rarely use it.  i like that its interchangeable where i can take off one layer of the coat depending on the weather. overall, very pleased with this coat and the price is not bad.
B00BZ5X9DY|5|This costume fit me exactly like I wanted it to. I bought a lightsaber also, and I was definitely a main attraction at the Halloween party!
B00UUWGCZ0|3|The color is more monotonous than the picture suggests. But the fit is good.
B007ZV6SAI|4|Product self inflates nicely, one big puff and its firm! downside is the plastic snaps dont seem to snap in. Plus the thing is super hard to get into the zipper roll sack it comes with. Once put away with too much effort its a nice car camping pad. Backpacking would probably not work for this but thats not why i bought it. I think i Will love this product once i find a good stuff sack for it. It's about 26\\" wide maybe 27\\" in the stuff sack. All in a solid 4 star product an super comfy to sleep on hardwood concrete or forest/camp floor/tent settings great. @ 18.20 I'm happy with this purchase.
B00FGJFAX2|5|excelente
B00793OVFG|2|Seller shouldn't offer color choice if it's not honored. I ordered 3 Metal Wallets in colors RED - WHITE - PINK.  Seller sent 3 BLUE Wallets instead. It doesn't matter what color you choose, odds are you'll probably get BLUE.
B00863IR0I|5|My almost 4 year old wore this today without any fuss. The jacket fitted well and she was comfortable in it. The scarf was a real hit! It is passed through a loop on the back so that it can be taken out if needed. The hood is not detachable but I didn't mind that. The jacket is fairly light-weight and is not bulky. It is nice, soft and keeps her warm. Worked great on a blustery, freezing fall day like today. Very happy with purchase.
B00FGH98NM|5|Soft and supple leather.. Great price! However, had to return as size fit a little larger than expected as I trusted reviews that stated it fit smaller. It is In fact true to size. When I received it, ordered a smaller size immediately as I was too happy with the product to wait for a return approval.
B00XHFSBFG|4|Nice quality but i didn't know it didn't come with pockets
B00IKCMPPI|3|It was ok, It complimented my Malificent costume well but looked very cheap
B00HUS792M|5|Fit well with no annoying lines through your clothes, or imprinted in your skin!
B00AKP3DD6|4|I liked the dress, it just wasn't for me.  A lightweight material and ran a bit large on me.
B003RAG5KE|4|Some of the eyelets are pulling away from the material, other than that, this item does the job very well!
B00O8SBCDY|5|very comfortable
B004NN692S|3|I'm only giving this 3 stars because while the quality appears to be good, the sizing is very confusing.  I ordered a large thinking it would be a size 12 but the large is a 14-16 so I have to send them back to get a medium.
B00N4SLXFQ|1|This looks SOOOOOO cute in the advertisement, but if you do buy PLEASE buy 2 or 3 sizes bigger. I usually wear a small/medium. I got a large just to be safe. It fits nothing like the picture. The girl in the ad must have been wearing an xxl . I can't return it for a bigger size. Not cool. This company sinks. I'd give it ZERO stars if I could. I love Amazon and shop all the time on here, but I am NOT A HAPPY CUSTOMER after this purchase. At least it was not too expensive. Just a waste of money.
B00EDSWMW4|5|These are personally, my favorite leggings.  The fit is great, and I like the fact that there is some slight sheen, as it keeps the garment on top from sticking to them.  I am small, but not a young girl, so I like the smoothing & control.  I wear them under knits in the winter, and the high waist helps my back, & prevents muffin top no matter how slim you are!  No roll down for me,  very comfortable & sleek.  Also wear them with tunic tops etc.  They are after all leggings, NOT pants, so if you are expecting to wear them as such, better choose another brand, or a &#34;jegging&#34;.  Love these!!!  This is my 4th pair.  Bought the nude as well for support under things.  Recommended to a friend & she loves them too.  Great price.  Paid $30 something for the first pair elsewhere.  Wish they made a bit longer pair too.  Size for me runs true.😀
B001XJ9K62|5|If you are a lady with a larger chest please understand the Goddess women's sports bra is possibly the best on the market. I love them. I have multiple ones and I feel very supported in addition to the fact that I do a lot of poly metrics (jumping) this bra definitely supports me and provides comfort. I definitely suggest it to any woman that is trying to be or already is active and has a larger chest.
B0006UD72C|3|The photo shows the top as NOT see-through; but, it is see-through lace.  The bottom is very transparent - yikes - so I can't run around the house in this.  The only good news is that it is comfy to sleep in. Kind of expensive for the quality.
B004BG1TXG|5|I love this vest!  It is perfect for the coast in the fall.  It was a bit bigger than I would like<br />but it works with a sweater or thick shirt underneath!
B00DUVPND0|5|I love these socks I bought my first pair a few weeks ago. this is my 8th pr. they come is so many colors and prints I don't know what one I like the best
B00HX9WPG8|5|So cute!
B00DZOI1ZY|4|Quality visor. It fits well, well made. I wear it all the time now. The only reason for 4 vs. 5 stars is I wish the logo was a bit more visible against the camo. But I guess that's the point of camo, huh?<br /><br />Overall, it's what I was looking for at a good price
B000IBFEEI|5|My husband works outside and this vest helps keep him warm in the winter. This was a great price and shipped quickly and promptly.
B00H87T95A|5|Exactly as described! Perfect! My new favorite shirt! Lightweight but not see-thru!
B00FVRG64G|1|Stitching isn't that strong and runs small
B00SCZUKE6|5|The dress is lovely and I feel beautiful in it.  It does require ironing but that thus far has been worth the way I feel wearing it.
B00DHHACNS|5|I have this in a 38D. I love that one, but wasn't fitting as perfect as it could be. Got the DD, perfect. Great bra. Comfortable. Really gives great support!! and looks super cute.
B004TQHKZO|5|My son is 13 years old and it is so hard to find jeans round enough and short enough to fit him! These are just right.
B00B3OV89Y|5|Adorable!!! And should keep our little girl nice and warm!!!
B00GTA8F02|5|Very pretty I bought for my mom and she loved it
B000E2D2GS|5|GREAT!!!!! FAST SHIPPING!!!! VERY PLEASED!!!!
B00KBXK95M|4|nice quality shirt happy with my purchase
B00S15E45I|4|Great value
B00HQ9R2EK|3|sent it back though it was a lovely color.
B008GTF476|5|I really love this sweater!  It is soft and warm, the very thing I was looking for to throw on during the winter months to keep warm.  The yarn combination of alpaca and silk is soft and smooth.  This sweater is an heirloom piece.
B00YCUVCL0|5|My baby looks cute in it... although she looks cute in anything so that's not really saying much.  On the other hand it was super cute to see her wearing this on fathers day morning.  Fabric is nice and thick/soft.
B002TNQAJQ|1|I am disappointed I spend about $30 on this shirt.  It's very pretty but way small and kind of cheap feeling as well.  I recommend buying two or three sizes up. I bought a size up and it is still way too tight. The black under piece disn't stay in place very well either.
B00J3ZZT18|5|Beautiful and comfortable , fast shipping too
B00422M6FY|5|Quality craftsmanship with all the essentials.
B00JFTVIBM|5|I was told that this product is cut a bit small so I ordered the next larger size. It worked out perfectly after my wife washed it. I have long arms and the bigger size came with longer sleeves. I just love this shirt.
B009Q9MIOC|4|aa
B001GKLT6M|3|The photo looks like the hat has dreads, which is what it should have to be a proper Rastafarian, but it actually has ringlets.
B00BYH6QQU|5|This has to be one of the most comfortable dresses I've ever owned.  Looks nice at home and just as nice when out in the world. I took it on vacation last summer and felt so stylish when we went out to eat.  And guess what?  Its made in The USA.  Doesn't get any better than that. I love it!
B00BYQO000|3|Good shirt but very large.  Normally I order 2XLT but on this shirt the sleeves hit at or below my elbow--feels like I'm wearing a tent.
B000BJO0CE|3|I bought this belt nine months ago and have worn it almost every day since that point.  The brown color has cracked where the leather passes through the buckle and is beginning to peel, exposing the black leather underneath the coating.  The rest of the belt looks good, with reasonable amounts of wear to the buckle.
B00BWJ31EU|5|Wonderful!!!!!
B00JB8P9YE|5|Was giving as a gift, it was well liked,
B00C78D3CK|1|I Would not buy these trunks again.<br />I Bought a size larger than i needed they were still too small.
B00MAKXICK|5|Cool bigger than I thought for a key chain and sharp.
B0072QTITO|5|delicate, elegant, wonderful !!!!
B00P7TN5II|5|my husband's jaw dropped when he saw me in this dress.... probably the best response I'ver ever received from my husband about a dress!  He has asked me to buy all the dresses in this style.
B00B8XFW9C|5|i don't use it yet. i think it's good. it do not compatible the first time, but i try i fix the bios.
B00GNUQ66S|5|Gift for daughter in college....she loves it because the lining makes it warm.
B00E0YE5Y4|4|I think it was a childrens size large  It was way to small..  Will give it to my grandaughter.  Thanks
B00PLP7606|5|This dress fits the way all dresses should,it didn't look that great on the hanger,but once I had it on,I loved it.
B006SRTFWI|5|This pair of long underwear fits me perfectly and feels great. I plan to use it under snow pants.
B007W0XRJ2|5|So happy with the product starting to wear them all the time. It gave me confidence
B00RVBI2LU|4|Bottoms were true to size but I wear a 36 C bra and the top was HUGE. Great suit for busty girls! Not so much for me :(
B00BM27Y0O|5|I absolutely love this shirt!!!! I would order more like it.....
B00BM1DZLW|1|I wanted to give 0 stars because this is horrible, I order the small in nude, im xs and this thing doesn't fit me right, im petite but with butt and this make it look like a weird stuff, I wanted to look fuller on my sides, but not with this it rolled up all the time I just try it home and haven't use it because make my body look weird.
B005DQ5C1S|4|arrived at time, the image of product was accord with the real product, i dont have any problem with deivery product
B00DONYQQE|1|Way too small.....I am only 5'2 and it was too tiny...waste of money had to throw away. Not up to body standards in US
B00IXIW99Q|5|I Really like this shirt.. It's very in your face kind off shirt lol..I'm 5,4 and weight 140 and it fits perfect..
B00DQO2WMG|5|I kind of think I should have bought two.
B00ZANY6UC|1|Too large
B000YXICPS|4|The hoodie merchandise is perfect. However, the XL size is what I would consider a L size.
B00CUM08GW|5|Received a few compliments that people liked the shirt. Fits well.
B00FEKZP38|5|I bought these for my wife, she fell in love with them!
B008PMY9GG|5|It was packaged well. It fits me perfectly. The design is trendy and modern. Good materials. I really like it.
B00FO3AR6K|1|The details of this scarf are very deceiving. It is so incredibly small it was even too tight for a 6 year old little girl.  I will not order from this vendor again.
B00I0WRRP6|4|Got this for my brother-in-law. He loved it, and they even threw in an American Flag sticker for free. 'MURICA.
B00LO3Z6CO|5|really cute wallet!
B0056FZXUQ|3|Had I known this shirt has princess seaming, I'd never have bought it ...which may be why the product description left out this detail. It is not a relaxed fit. Because of the seaming, the size large fits like a size medium, and what should be nicely shaped tails are simply a mis-shaped hem. No more Carhartt for me.
B00B5WSIUG|5|I needed a simple pair of black cotton pants for baby. These came quickly, fit well, seem comfortable, and are easy to get on and off.
B00DCXH9A6|3|There was not a picture of what the back of this top looked like. After getting it in the mail and trying it on we realized that my 10 year couldn't wear it without a tank top because it is that see-through in the back. I would've liked to have known that ahead of time prior to purchasing. Otherwise a cute top and fit true to size.
B00QIDJI60|5|Very nice
B008OIGS6K|4|It's pretty affordable and the quality is seems really nice. You get exactly what you're looking at in the picture.
B004HVKLXO|5|I got this for a friend who always walks around with a single key and a single credit card in her pocket or car, and always has issues misplacing them. She doesn't like and simply won't carry a purse or large wallet. A long time ago, I gave her an old coin purse of mine like this one, and it was the only thing she's ever carried consistently. She used it for many years until it fell apart, and then went back to the ol' pocket with associated hazards.<br /><br />She absolutely LOVES this item and really likes the red leather. It is a little more of an orange-red than I expected, which I found to be slightly disappointing, but my friend actually prefers the color. The color and description on the site are pretty accurate so I'm still giving five stars--just make sure you are viewing it in appropriate lighting. If you want a deeper red, though, go with another product.
B00E4PX49Q|5|I love it!!!
B004JCQ518|2|I wear size 11.5 shoes.  I purchase these at another store,  Right out of the bag they were too small, even before being washed.  I returned them.<br />I have had a terrible time with socks falling into my shoe or shrinking too much to fit me.  Good luck shopping for socks.  I use them in my tennis shoes.
B00JXFXGUE|5|This one fit a little bit smaller than the others i've ordered but I still love it and wear it
B00QNJKZHK|5|I truly love these t.shirts they are wonderful...
B00DU3A0G8|1|One size does not fit all.
B0053053M2|5|I think this will be perfect for sunny and windy days at the beach since it has a chin strap and the strap is removable too. Tired of my other beach hats without chin  straps blowing off.<br />the hat doesn't even have to be adjusted tighter since it fits just right. I have a small/medium head size so I I thought it might be big but wasn't. The brim is just right not too big. The fabric is light and shouldn't be too hot or heavy. It seems that it would dry quickly if it got wet too. I only wish this came in even more colors. I may order another color soon. I bought the navy but would love to see it come in a light tan and a medium blue.
B000GGLTOE|4|Great backpack. Nice and compact and durable. Fast shipping. Would have liked to have seen better dimensions on website, their lack of sizing made it that I had to guess and it was smaller than I expected. But on the whole happy.
B004EKOLJ8|3|It doesn't stay on....
B00MHOP3MW|1|I come not to order
B008X1JAHM|2|Even though we ordered a smaller size, it was still too large!
B00JY0WCKS|5|Perfect fit - not too tight or body-hugging. Very comfy
B00939OGV8|2|Was good for a day before the fan broke. Tested battery pack with another suit and worked fine, fan was the issue.
B00LNB8QF6|5|Good
B00HHH27PK|5|Very cute dress for a Whovian. Quality of dress is good for the price (not costume-like). It is very tight and the neck is low, so be prepared for that. Color and image are the same as the picture.
B00G6MWFKO|3|the length of the dress is past the knees its perfect. just order a size smaller. i got a 22/24 it was way too big. over all this dress is cute. i want to order in another color.
B000H3G1YE|5|Fits perfectly, keeps face nice and warm.
B00SZBGGRM|5|It fit just fine.
B00ACIFP6E|5|I'm 5'8 and a half 155 lbs with broad shoulders. These fit perfectly.
B000UVTVWW|5|Very good quality.  Quick delivery
B00MW804KY|3|I ordered this shirt for a &#34;National Survivor&#34; event I was attending.  I expected the shirt to come in 2 days, as I thought it was a prime sale.  It came much, much too late for me to wear.  It is too large, I wouldn't buy again or recommend.
B007IEGWJE|2|For the price the costume it was ok but it does run small. It's totally not made for talk women or a cup size larger then a full C unless you're comfortable with showing a little more. The wig is cheap and big but totally makes the costume you just have to get it on just right. I didn't wear the tie since it was too tight around my neck. The gloves were fine.  I  safety pin the bellt to the dress so didn't move. All and all it was ok.
B00315DOAO|5|just great for my troubled feet. they help keep me on my feet for work. and they fit good too for the sizes that was stated
B00N3SFFS8|5|👍👍
B00K27R39W|5|This is a gift! It is Gorgeous!!  TY!! Fast shipping!!
B008OL4WPG|4|it is good as the picture show<br />but the size is not perfect to me i need smaller than my usuall size
B00MAUZTU4|2|Caution as the men's XL I ordered and received was more like a men's Small. This is a known problem, so adjust and you may get more orders.
B0063Y1ORK|5|Great price great product. My g/f wanted one so I got her this fake but she knows and she loves it... I will get her more.
B00K81UXI0|4|Very nice socks, fit over the knee with great &#34;stay-up&#34; fit.
B003B2O8HK|5|Halloween is my favorite holiday and as such, I've purchased many a wig over the years.  This one exceeded my expectations.  The curls are perfect, they stay in place and don't get frizzy.  It fits my 10 year old daughter very well and it has held up to her constant fiddling.  I highly recommend this wig and will look to this company for further needs.
B007IJ78PQ|5|I've been looking and looking for a nursing cami with a full sling, and finally found one in this version!  I only wish I could buy them in other colors!  MUCH more support than a side sling cami.
B003BLZJJM|4|very cmfy .. wore day 1 after having a baby. i never looked like i was still pregnant when i left the hospital. I order a large ( I was a size 10 prepregnancy....) however the seemed to long. i wish the compression started lower. but i wore them also over hose for a wedding 2 weeks after having the baby... no pouch. thinking of getting the medium now
B0066YJP1Y|5|Meets my expectations
B000BNQND4|5|I got what i wanted and i am 100% satisfied with the product<br />thank you very much for this hat
B00W5D9L1E|1|I wanted a girls 6x, not a 16.
B00406YW18|4|Nice shoe. Hoping the leather stretches out a bit with use.
B00GIDTFR2|3|I orderd medium size,but it was so big that even my grandmother couldn't fit it..
B006K4ZQOU|1|i am unable to use this product as I ordered a size 4-7 and was sent a size xtra large. my child won't be able to wear these for another year or 2
B00HY3O7V4|3|They are not what you would expect but you cannot get hurt at 5.00 dolars.
B00LNKSJ7W|5|Always fits perfectly
B0055FKEO2|5|the camisole fit fine
B004YZO17K|5|Perfect jeans. the size, the fabric, the design, the color, the price, the general look, the feeling, all are perfect.
B0093AK9T0|5|It is so great I am going to order another one for myself and one for a friend.  Two more words are required to print so here are the two more words.
B004X2IUBM|4|First off, I'm an airsoft player. I used these for eight hours of play, so I review from that experience.<br /><br />The overall quality of the pads is good. Nothing spectacular, but rugged and functional. I have relatively skinny legs, but the pads are pretty comfortable. The straps are the only thing that disappoint a little. Not uncomfortable, but they didn't hold their adjustment very well and let the pads slip down. This was actually an easy fix. I just used something to tie the adjustors in place and it held for hours. Just as long as the straps don't loosen, these pads won't slip down.<br /><br />For the price, these pads are great! Any cons are easily fixed. A recommended product!
B00EDODZHE|5|I bought this for a special needs boy who turned 16 to show the world just how special he is........... great shirt great title.
B0077UXFU8|4|This is my first underbust corset, and I like it better than my overbust ones! It's a very versatile piece of clothing. Looks great worn over a black dress. The jacquard material covering is very pretty. Watch out for the size info, though. Order smaller than it says you need. My &#34;natural&#34; waist is 46&#34; so according to the chart I should have ordered a size 56, but I ordered a size 50 and it fits perfectly. This is a great corset, and I expect to wear it often!
B002YP9JDS|5|Searched Amazon for hours, looking for kelly green socks for my groomsmen. Finally came across this seller, who didnt want $20 a pair. After reading that the socks didnt have an elastic band to hold them up, I got the smaller of the two sizes, figuring 1. the wedding is in May so it will be hot, and 2. smaller size equals less sock falling down. The color is great! A little lighter than what I had hoped for, but will still work under tuxes. They do seem nice and thin, breathable. Plus for one night, cant go wrong on the price!
B00470LAXK|4|I've had this wallet for I want to say at least a year now and it's held up great. The only drawback is cards tend to slip out easily and I'm not a huge fan of hemp. But it's a good alternative to a leather wallet and seems to be holding up better than a nylon or vinyl wallet. Cool design of bike, too.
B00ESYAWTI|3|I ordered this hat in early Dec. 2013, and after several updates to shipping delivery dates, finally received it on Jan. 17th, nearly one month later. The color is more purple than gray; not the color shown in the picture. It looks handmade, so I'm not sure of the quality after wearing/washing. Not worth the trouble of returning it to China, so I'll likely keep it, but the color doesn't match anything I own. Disappointed.
B002XF4E8Y|3|I love the pattern and the material looks and feels great.  My issue is that I'm 6'5&#34;, 200lbs with a giant head...and it's just not as long as I would like.  It works great if I tuck it in but it's not a true wrap-around scarf unless you're smaller than me.  Which you probably are, I suppose.
B00OLPHGIO|4|Cute gown! Wish it was a little bigger.
B002SCJX2O|4|They are not standard in size. Took the boot to a local sales office for Redwing boots and they measured between 4.5 and 5, instead of the 3 that I ordered. Luckily for me, I have plenty of family members with small feet and it was just a matter of gifting them to one of the older kids. Still too early to tell if the quality of the boot is good or not.
B005T5Z3HG|5|One of the most desirable gifts at our work gift exchange.
B000FXUU2U|3|I'm fairly standard in size for different brands and have several Carhartt shorts and work pants.  So figured I'l pick these up in my usual size (40x36) and save some money.  However they pants were much larger than expected.  Waste was at least a 42 (although stated as 40) and the length was a good 2 inches too long.  Easy to return with Amazon so it wasn't a huge deal but reading the reviews, I wonder if these were mislabled or made off the wrong measurements?  I'll try again but I'm a bit 'gun shy' as I'm not sure exactly what size to order now.  I usually can't find this particular size at the local stores but they will special order for me so I can try them on before purchase.
B00CC4XPRW|5|I LOVE all the clothes Agan Trader sells, but this might be the best skirt they've sold me yet! Dress it up with a peasant blouse or one of the WONDERFUL blouses they sell in this line (several come in matching silver), or dress it down with a t-shirt or a funky tank top. Expect lots and lots of twirl! Makes you want to go sing on a mountain top like Julie Andrews.
B00NVEXSAG|5|Clothing is very beautiful and actually as required and an existing image
B00XI4WDU0|5|Cute, comfortable, my son just love it, for reference my son is  9 years old, 83lbs, and size large fits a little big, but it is okay he will use it in cold days only
B007KG3RU2|5|Great fit
B008KY3OOC|5|It's very good thing. I recommend. Child at the time. Cold keeps well. At minus 21 children in a warm and yet remains flexible.
B00T9A4LBQ|5|Awesome! Super comfortable and cute. Love the variety of patterns and fabrics. Won't fit anyone bigger than a M though.
B00Q88QUMA|4|The sizing information may be a bit confusing for some, so I removed one star for difficulty. I used a cloth measuring tape to get my son's measurements and made a reluctant guess based off of them. My six year old of average height weighs 42 pounds and wears a comfortable size 6 regular in jeans and shirts. The 120 fit him perfectly.<br /><br />Based on this, I would estimate the sizes to be:<br /><br />5-6 for  Height120: Length: 18.5&#34;, Bust:28&#34;, Shoulder:12.5&#34;, Sleeve:15&#34;;<br />7-8  for  Height130: Length:19.5&#34;, Bust:30.5&#34;, Shoulder:13&#34;, Sleeve:16.5&#34;<br />9-10  for Height140: Length: 21&#34;, Bust:32&#34;, Shoulder:13.8&#34;, Sleeve:17.7&#34;<br />11-12  for Height150: Length:22.4&#34;, Bust:34&#34;, Shoulder:14.5&#34;, Sleeve:19&#34;<br /><br />I hope that can be of help to others who are confused about what size to get. My son loves the hoodie and it seems to be good quality in my opinion.
B00M59FKKY|5|Great fit, very nice.
B00J2WIG26|5|The color and leather is rich looking and wallet is functional and sleek.
B00HRKAOIO|5|Perfect fit
B00NJANBNG|5|kids love them
B00SFHVJ32|5|I love it. My belly and boobs are a little big, and my butt is not, but the fit is pretty flattering anyway. I do feel like a pinup girl in it. I got a size 46 and I wear 12-14 in pants and 40C in bra. I am impressed.
B008N8121M|5|Just everything expected.Bought as a gift and she loves them. Really comfy...wears them all the time. Great price as well.
B00OIGLZXI|1|Looks nothing like the picture... I had high expectations from the image but it was rather cheap looking.
B00505DWNM|3|SHirt was great except it runs small. I ordered a X-Large and it fits as a medium. If ordering order at leat 3 sizes bigger than what you normally wear
B00AOH8VA0|5|and very comfortable and has a GREAT look !!!
B003GOSOUA|5|Best purchase I made for my son's birthday party! It totally set the mood before even entering our house. We loved it so much, we kept it up!
B000BVGLTM|3|To whom this concerns(amazon) and to any that are interested in buying these shirts , these t-shirts are not being displayed in the true colors that they actually are.  The three shirts I ordered arrived today 08/16, they are not the colors I excitedly expected and sunk my money into the thought of wearing.  Do not be fooled by the attactive colors displayed of these shirts, you will not get what you were expecting.
B009NWMSI8|1|I'm not sure what circumstance would make this thing better. It is very stretchy, not a firm support, and it just isn't what I need. Not as if I'd try to return an undergarment. Save your money.
B005XCT7MM|5|Got this for my husband for Valentine day, he has one just like it, but is worn and dirty!<br />He loves the flexibility of the wallet, not hard to set on!
B0012UXL8A|4|I have three kids so you know how the hips look, but I didn't want to look like a grandma so this is a perfect way to look my age and cover up all the imperfections!!!!!!!The only problem I had was when I ordered the suit, it runs small so order 1 size larger then what you really wear. I had to send the first suit back (which was easy) but I had to wait to recieve my next one!!!! But it looks great and I feel good with the coverage!!!!!!
B001PSQCB2|1|These pants are shown with pads, however, do not have pads in them. They are simply pants with pockets for pads to be inserted.
B00GK03RXQ|5|Works great they truly keep the snow my kids love to dig threw the snow so we needed gloves that would keep them dry and warm these gloves do the job.
B005TPS72O|5|The appearance is very beautiful, also very easy to get dirty.
B0041P0L54|4|I love this sexy outfit.  I played it down by painting a skeleton make up, so it's not too &#34;cute.&#34;  I got the small, I'm 5'3&#34; and 119 lbs.  I should've gotten the xs cause it kinda fits loosely.  I had a black strappy bra on along with the clear straps that came with the outfit and it looked fine with the bra.  I would recommend this.
B001QBRLDQ|5|Thank you!
B006H0J15C|4|good
B000WO1FB2|5|They fit great and are the perfect length. I bought as part of Halloween costume but she wears them all the time.
B00KRYPB80|4|I am normally an XL but ordered a XXL because XL in most exercise tee's are too tight and too short for me (5'3&#34; 177 lbs). I like my tees to come down mid-butt range. After washing & drying, it did shrink to a better fit, still a bit loose and short but very wearable with tighter pants.  I bought another one in an XL and it fit a bit snug.<br />For 9.00 I will not return!! Great price for an OK workout Tee in either size!!
B002FX4B46|5|I love this costume the it fits really good me and my husband dress alike, the only thing is that when I hand washed it the gold turned silver on some parts but I will still give it 5 stars for the price
B00JADSOGA|4|daughter loved it
B00QRHHXF0|5|Fits perfectly, flattering and sexy. My go to pair in hot weather!
B000P309AS|5|I actually bought these bc I thought the skulls were pink. Nope, very red, but I was still happy. And although I do not consider myself a stick figure (I have tiny legs with a big booty) these fit my body really well. Cute for dress up ;)
B00K6JOYA2|3|I ordered a size 4US but it fits as a size 8US.  On the product was hand written in ink size 8, but not whether it was 8US or 8UK.  Dress is too large and certainly does not fit as a size 4US, but as 2 sizes bigger.  The top of the dress is made from cheap material, but the skirt is a nice stretchy fabric.
B009PJ9SGY|2|I bought this, taking a chance, for the wide beige elastic, but did not like the quality of elastic.
B0096BXTA2|5|Everything about this shirt is perfect. the image isnt thick and overbearing, and yet durable feeling. the fit was perfect on me, shoulder placement and all. i got a large, and i am a 42 L jacket size, just as a reference.
B00BSE6UYC|5|I had a lot of trouble finding an age appropriate swimsuit that was still cute and showed off my figure without showing too much skin. This suit is modest, but doesn't look like something my grandma would wear. I am 5'6\\" and 125lbs with a long torso and a size 6 fit me perfectly. The suit also supports my 34C chest without flattening it down. I highly recommend this suit!
B007M8PAIK|5|I just love the fabric and the fit of the dress! It has the ability to seem chic or layback with it!
B00GAY96UA|5|SHE SAYS:<br /><br />1. THEY FIT PERFECTLY, JUST AS AN 8 SHOULD FIT<br />2. THE FABRIC IS NICE...NOT TOO HEAVY, NOR TOO LIGHT...PERFECT FOR HOT SUMMER TIME WEAR<br />3. WASHES AND DRIES NICELY..SHRINKS JUST A TAD, BUT STRETCHES BACK OUT ONCE THEY ARE ON<br />4. SOME SIZE 8 SHORTS BAG AROUND THE WAIST; THESE DO NOT. FIT AS THE WAISTE SHOULD FIT<br />5. LENGHT IS GOOD...AS SHOWN IN PHOTO...HITS 2-3N INCHES ABOVE THE KNEE. SHE IS 5'7&#34; AND WEIGHS136.<br /><br />SHE SAYS THEY ARE GREAT, RECOMMENDS THEM...AND P.S. WHEN AM I PLANNING TO GET HER ANOTHER PAIR?!
B006OUTIC6|5|My wife is trying to make similar shoes now, and it's really hard to make as they are really good, fit excellently, not just some loose bags with a button to tighten on a leg. A definite must buy for a little one.
B00P1IQZXW|4|I typically wear a medium but ordered a large after reading several reviews saying they ran small. Fits perfect! I'm 5'7&#34; 133 lbs. Nice coat for the price!
B0027VT6EQ|4|I am 6' and 210lbs and the costume fit great.  In broad daylight the bones and details are somewhat fake, but we were handing candy out around a firepit and tiki torches and there were many kids that would not even approach unless I came out of character and took off the mask.  It was a big hit.
B007J6CYUM|4|I bought this as part of my Halloween costume, i used it as a bottom. It's stretchy but also sticks to your bottom so make sure you get a size you're comfortable in.
B000VK7PFM|5|Love this brand!  I've bought two Glamorise bras and so far they have been great.  I will purchase again.
B000KB07YS|5|Super nice watch, my bf loved it and everyone compliments him on it. Hope it comes in white..you wont be upset with this purchase,
B0065K1QSE|5|Good quality, fits perfectly
B00DN5OZQE|5|love em
B00JAKFRRM|5|awesome......well made but then i wouldn't expect any less from Carhartt!
B006U1EM66|5|Love them get one or two now!!! :)
B00G1ZY8BU|4|It is a quality top, but if you are more on the modest side, you may wish to order a size larger than usual; a little less coverage than other triangle tops.
B00FQJG48C|3|The Hat is warm but the fit isn't the best.  It is a bit tight.
B0092SJZLQ|4|Love!  A bit on the small side but it fit my head fine.  It was great for my trip to Europe.
B00EDIW7EW|4|Beautiful color. Cups are straight up so very 40s pinup. Lots of padding in cups so there's support. Like all Gottex, quality all the way. I ordered a size too large. Runs true to size. In Gottex, order your dress size.
B0012HCTG8|5|This is the only brand I have worn for over 15 years (except for sports). Its comfortable, classy, and never disappoints.  Just be sure that you’re buying an authentic Wacoal and not a knock-off.  They’re worth every penny!
B00BNJ86EE|5|Bought it for my daughter she is very happy with it. She wears it all the time
B002NNHQWW|5|They are Levis, duh.
B0025GAQRO|1|Can we all try a little less bullying!?!?
B00RYOV12Q|4|The photo doesn't exactly match the pattern but overall it's nice and sheer and comfortable. I am 5t 2in and 135 and I feel like it's a good fit. I am going to wear it to Jamaica in a few weeks and the only thing I wish it came with is directions on how to tie the wrap. I tied the wrap under my arms and and around my neck, looks nice either way.
B00KMCDVLQ|5|😃
B009RHN5HW|5|Really cool to have.
B00JSJ5J0U|5|Great quality casual shorts. Love the Cubavera style!
B009OICQ5Q|4|I have to twist the arms to get the thumb holes to where I can actually put my thumbs in. Slightly annoying, but tolerable. Fits great other than that. I also like 1/2 the arms are ribbed (not shown well in photo), and the material has great gives; hugs just right, but gives too!
B007SK4C7C|4|Quality was good, as expected, but it was a on the larger end of 3XL. The bra cups didn't provide any support or lift. The fabric was a good quality. Overall my husband enjoyed this purchase!
B00IOU2Q96|3|more or less
B001OE0HKE|2|Belt had a strong odor of mildew. You could smell it from a few feet away.
B00BX9MUZU|4|Definitely Juniors age type style<br />The lace in the back looks a bit like a doily and I do not like
B002YC12S6|5|This hat helps to keep my husband's head cool while also shielding him from the sun.
B00MU2ACOK|5|Gorgeous, beautiful colors and lot's of compliments from everyone and how lovely it looks
B0072LCJIG|1|I wish this would've fit, but it was just crazy small!  I know it was sized as &#34;one size fits most&#34;, but when taking it out of the package, it was approximately 8 inches wide.  I thought it would've had more stretch like other fish-net items, but it didn't.  I had to return it.  Great customer service though.
B0063CHZRA|4|This bathing suit is of high quality and well made.  My only complaint is that it seemed to run a little small, but I think this will depend on the size of your child.  Also after you wash a bathing suit it tends to stretch so maybe it's for the better. I purchased this as a gift so I will have to check with the receiver and update my rating at that time.
B007TZBNNC|3|I bought these laces for my husband as he's had two back surgeries and is unable to bend down long enough to tie his standard type shoe laces.  These are a good substitute.
B003KURAL4|5|Even prettier than the picture. The gold shimmers!
B004EVPYPM|5|I have owned this hat for two years!!! still durable, still good looking. if you want quality, you pay for it. i wear it everyday and still is intact. best money i have spent, bow down old men, i am younger and know how to rock this bitch!!! recognize.
B008RYBVIG|1|Fit as expected, but I returned this item.<br />It's too bad quality I think. I'm very disappointed about the coat and think it's overpriced.
B00LHTGNJU|2|It's really cute, but the backing and bottom fabric are really cheap. The top loop/handle broke the 2nd time my daughter used it and other parts of it have ripped since. We've had it less than a week. It is also a lot smaller than I expected, but I also did not check the dimensions before I bought it. My daughter really loves it though.
B00A472P20|5|I gain ten more pounds after my second girl was born, and now I am 168cm, 153pounds, and I choose the size 10, it fits very well, and the quality is good too!
B003CMYTRS|5|My son absolutely loved these socks, we works outside in some of the coldest weather around and they keep him warm!
B001AQV1K6|4|We bought a few of these for a renaissance fair where a few of the guys didn't want to go all &#34;knight in shining armor&#34;. These fit the bill perfectly, they are a costume yes, but simple and don't stick out so much as to make the guys feel weird. They were extremely light, easy for pretty much any body shape, and laundered fine. (the guys that wore them were of average weight, one being about 5'11, other being more like 6'2 and the length was good, not super short, but it wasn't hitting the feet like in the photo either. The only thing I didn't like was that considering the simplicity of the costume and the thin/not great quality material, I think it was a bit over priced at just under $30. I think if I found it at my local big box store it would probably be more like half this price.
B00D4KTJEG|3|Top of the item was slightly too small. I was able to purchased another pair of legging and another top to match.
B007VUA28C|2|I would consider a XXL almost an average size L in other brands.  It was a nice shirt for a 10 year old,  but way to small for an adult male.
B009QH3KH8|5|I have a new favorite - not rediculously priced- bra.  Just what I have been looking for.  A little extra support, and nice wide cushioned shoulder straps.  Perfect!
B00L3231ZU|5|Very nice, room to grow in.
B000JE7UD2|5|well i am only thirteen and got the 7 1/4 size. I do have a rather large head (and feet) so it fits me vary well, if anybody else is thirteen or under i suggest you don't get anything larger than a 7 1/4. I ordered it january 6 and got it the 11 after school. some people might think that this was a long time to wait, but i have liveed in Bolivia for most of my life were if you even recieve it it takes atleast 3 months. So i am very pacient. It will hold up very well, its got the pocket things to put twigs, durable, looks awsome, and shipping was fast. I would deffinitly order from these people again. Ohh yes and in my opinion it is under priced, but it is not water proof, but will protect you from the sun and rain. ohh wait no it is waterproof
B0043RONNG|5|These glasses fit well over my ears, on the bridge of my nose and on the sides of my head without being too tight.  The bridge is part of the plastic form of the frames, so isn't pressing on my nose.  The lenses are large enough to provide an adequate reading space, but not too large as to make me look like Harriet Potter :-)!  When I get ready to move up to the next strength, I will order these again if they are available.
B00H5JTB4A|1|its the same pattern but not the same length at all huge difference ,
B00KBZU8CY|5|great shirts.  very comfortable.  ordered more after wearing them.
B00A29951E|5|Speedy Delivery,Great Hat.I Rockit Well!
B00CQ4EEJG|5|I pretty much only buy carters brand for my baby they hold up and are true to size. This outfit fits him well and holds up after many washes I love it and will always buy Carters for my baby :)
B0085KICCU|4|Ok so it is European standard sizes a bit tight. It is still a good product. Fabric is not what I expected as well. It is more sturdy than what is shown.
B00J345E32|3|was too big . and had no shape . I was expecting more of a fitted  t - shirt . and shirt was cheap thought it would be better quality .
B000FGVXZ0|2|Ok
B007OWVLFK|5|FITS WELL AND ISNT THIN LIKE MOST CRAPPY SHIRTS YOU SEE ON THE NET WILL BE ORDERING MORE FROM THESE GUYS IN THE FUTURE
B004NP881Q|5|My son had tried on a 2x at a store, and it seemed a bit snug so we ordered the 3x.  He feels it is a bit too big.  I think white makes one look bigger anyway.  He had to wear white, which is not a good color for him.  The top washed up well, so we will see how it wears over time.  I trust Dickies brand and am sure it will be fine.
B000MXLYFU|5|I work in a non-airconditioned space.  On those really hot days, it sucks.  I searched around to find the most comfortable, breathable pants I could.  These things are awesome.  Highly recommended.
B00SCMEKF4|1|Was delivered the wrong size. Which is a shame bc it's cute.
B00Q2GC964|5|I love this product. Wow, I was expecting to just like it, it was part of a lightening deal and I love tops for working out. I was thrilled that this top is one of my favorites. I'm 4'10 and 93 lbs, I purchased the x-small, perfect for me. It was a bit more on the purple coloring.
B004ON1BVG|5|Finally a good fit for a small man size.  They wash well and are very durable.  I was thinking about buying another pair.
B00LI6RVUW|5|A Christmas gift for my 7 year old granddaughter and she loves it.
B00CO9KWPS|5|I received in the eager to put on it was a fight . Got it on couldn't breate..I kept it on and continued my days ...I have had for three days and I must say not bad even for the little exercise I do in it. From having a 3 yr, 22 month and a three month old I'm impressed ...belly fat has dropped ... Ladies buy it ...worth every penny ... I love it and my husband loves it ... I feel like super woman. I'm 5'5 220 pounds I got the xxl perfect fit. Please ladies buy it you will not be sorry it supports your back and the compression with beauty comes pain!! Those rolls will flatten out workout in it even walking or even 8 hours a day to wear!!! Better than diet pills I feel this is a winning product !!!
B007PM5UJ2|5|I wish the lights was around the whole skrit other then that i love the way it lokks on me.
B00I8LUTWC|3|Make no mistake here, I really like this product. However, there is a glaring problem with it....the thing is made of synthetic leather. I don't want to cry &#34;false advertising&#34; but when you describe a product as being made of leather I expect the real deal, not an imitation. Real leather doesn't lighten considerably from slight stress bends, but &#34;pleather&#34; does.<br /><br />If you're looking for a somewhat screen accurate belt for your Jedi costume for a decent price, look no further. On the other hand, if you need a belt that you'd be proud to show off to the Rebel Legion, you may want to try and make one yourself.
B004VJMDP6|2|Besides being too large the color was not the same as posted.
B00JJUWQ90|5|I love the fit and the quality of this shirt. Normally will not pay this much, but I feel it is worth it, I could shop forever and never found a shirt like this.
B00CMNXZD2|1|The product tore at the bottom, and iI returned it. They gave me a new one and the top of coat broke immediately right after i opened the bag. The coat i received seemed to already be used. It was wrinkled and had wear marks. The stuffing also comes out of the jacket.
B00CEM3ZQS|5|Does the job.  Doesn't show under clothes and holds my jeans up.  I'm now wearing jeans that I avoided wearing because they would stay up.
B0047R9242|5|Awesome shirt!!!
B000PHN5TG|4|Good product.  Lasted a couple of years before starting to wear down.
B0056G4QSA|4|Overall these tights are great. The only reason I gave them 4 stars was the size said 0-12 mo but when I opened the packaging the inside label said 12-18 mo. They still fit ok but my daughter is long for her age. Nevertheless she can use them for a long time.
B0031QE3A8|5|These hankies are well made and very pretty.  I like to carry hankies with me every day.  These are pretty enough both to use and to give as a gift.  They launder well, but need to be ironed.
B002QREFKG|5|I really like this belt. Bought a blue one a month ago and didn't pay attention to the sizing. So it ended up being too big, which I can deal with. This one fits perfectly.
B000IBJ1D8|5|This is my third pair. I think they are very well made and they fit like they should .Each pair has lasted about 5 years .And that is wearing them every day for the entire winter . I highly recomend these for work and around the house. I also hunt in them as they are rugged enough for briars and such.
B00L21VYP6|5|I really like this top - the material is of high quality and well made.
B00GSNUJ5O|5|I purchased this dress in Petite and it fits very well.  I love the print and trust me it is even nicer than in the photo.  You can adjust the tie in the back and the fabric is soft and very lightweight.
B009X1NT7S|5|Bought for my husband and he loves it. He is 6'4&#34; with extra long arms so we were thrilled that this fit. A little large in the body but he likes it anyway. Very smooth polar fleece. Lightweight. Warm. Launders beautifully, like new.
B00KVPY6KY|5|My son just loves this shirt!
B0007USMVW|5|I have worn these for over ten years, in assorted sizes (pre baby, pregnant and now post baby).  Wonderful!!! I am a DDD.  This is by far the most durable bra I have  ever owned, and they are comfortable too.  The only other bra I will wear is Wacoal, and they are three times the price of these. Always hand wash it and it will last almost forever.
B00JFP32OW|2|This bag is a cute, I bought it for my daughter.  There is a pretty big problem with it, however.  It is made of thin material with no inner lining, so I have little hope that it will last for any length of time.  It is of very poor quality.
B006L1M1V8|1|The size XXL is too short. It doesnt fit. The XXL corresponds a L size or less. Dont buy this jacket. Terrible.
B009P8XWZI|5|Being an artist, I wanted a more arty design. It's clean and simple. The fabric is a nice thickness. I ordered a large because I like a looser fit. I love this shirt!
B005OHCWG4|5|Always love Jockey supersoft brief although they discontinued my very favorite style this is a good replacement.
B00LIY24CO|5|I'm 5'6 and 120lbs. It is slightly big on me, but I fail to see how that's a problem, as it is a robe. Robes are meant to flare out. The sleeves reach to my fingertips. It feels absolutely amazing, and the color is gorgeous. The material feels and looks very high quality. It appears exactly as advertised.
B001Q3KNCK|5|Yep. I spoiled my child. This shirt was soooo dope. People always ask me where I purchase her clothes, I don't have the heart to tell them they can find quality clothing through Amazon.
B002LBW5AO|4|very comfortable, fits nicely, and look great on me.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I even put in washing machine (which is not recommended) and it held up well.  Didn't fall apart.
B0007YR99Y|5|love it!
B0050UX4MG|5|Loved the fit, quality, design and price. Continue producing more designs. I recommend to anyone wanting to find a  cool quality priced right T Shirt
B007PKOMTS|5|very soft
B001DPMUFE|3|I returned this product because I didn't care for the material, and the information describing the product ommitted it was crotchless. Oh well, I purchased a similar item at a store.
B009D15PWU|4|I bought this because it reminded me of the Mad Hatter or from a music video i saw on the internet. But anyways about this product: 1st thing is the time it came to my house was VERY FAST {aka shipment} and it was covered in bubble wrap like no ones business...But I'd rather have it wrapped like that vs no care/ thought process while shipping it! {Good job!} As I unwrapped it, the pieces were intacted & everything looked just like the picture shown. Now some of the pieces are very delicate such as the 4 mini lenses but never less. It still made me smile & super excited to try them on.Oh also, It's not a heavy piece if your thinking it is because of all the stuff... I would recommend this as a stylish twist....I don't know about everyday wear, since I work in a hospital, but when I want to be different & put my twist & wear a bandanna & this... WATCH OUT WORLD... here comes trouble....
B008GXK4RC|1|My daughter received the tote bag that was in the picture for her birthday but it got ruined and I was trying to find a replacement. I ordered this one, basing it on the picture, not the description and what I received was nothing what I thought I was going go get. I was sent a tiny tote bag which is made of that recyclable material reusable grocery bags are made of. The picture was different and the colors were completely different. What I received is not worth the money I paid and I am returning it.
B00M2OW258|4|My daughter was absolutely thrilled with these pajamas. They are exactly as described/pictured. My only minor complaint is that they seem to stretch out and lose their shape rather quickly. But, this is common of most children's cotton sleepwear.
B00BOBEBOU|5|She loves it and finally is throwing her old ratty one away. She looks great in it.
B00E0KC7K2|3|First thing, the seller nor the item description did not detail the fact that it had words on the shirt. It states \\"Sun, Sand, Sea and SLT\\" on a bad screen printed skull. I had high hopes for this flowy top, but upon seeing this i immediately contacted the seller. They promptly refunded a portion of the cost as to ship back to China would be too much of a expensive and i was able to keep the top to give as gift or choose to do with as like.<br /><br />The black portion of the top is jersey material and the pink is sheer. It is true in coloring, but in size it is a little off. I think it depends on how you want to style it. The shirt fits but is a bit boxy and tapered. Would be cute with leggings underneath.
B004Q6VR88|3|It is slightly cheesy of a costume. It does not come with the pot, the pipe, the shoes, or the beard.<br /><br />It also has a habit of spreading little green sparkles on everything.
B002APTBQM|2|I ordered a pair of BLACK Docker straight-fit pants, size 33 - 30. I was sent a pair of TAN Dockers pants. I sent them back, still waiting on a refund.
B00BGD1LGW|5|I was looking for a flamenco style blouse and found this. It is exactly what I desired at a great price that includes free shipping. The style comes in a blue and also a black base with white polka dots. The material is polyester. Spandix gathers the material at the bottom. It was sent immediately upon ordering.
B009IR0LVO|4|I heard adidas tricot is slightly long for the age, and it was. Even considering my son is Asian.<br />Other than that, I am happy with the price and quality of the product,
B000GB76SM|3|I didn't expect much for the price I paid for this Superman costume but when I opened the packaging some of the threads fell out in small clumps.  I didn't think too much of it because when I get new shirts some small threads fall out due to being processed in a factory full of threads.  But when I put the costume on I noticed an opening in the crotch area.  The threads came loose in the crotch area in three areas (4 inch opening and 2 small 1-2 inch openings).  I sewed the holes so it is not that big of a deal but it is obvious that it was sewn in that area (probably due to my poor sewing skills).  Other than the poor threading, the costume is pretty decent.  Again, for the price I paid (less than $50), this is a decent costume and my nephew (and daughter in a couple years) is going to love this costume at his superhero themed 2nd birthday party!<br /><br />NOTE:  I purchased a Spiderman costume (full body suit) which was also less than $50 and I love that costume!
B00TG1RJLW|5|My daughter loved this shirt and it fit just right.
B008BHKA18|4|I'm an easy grader.  For the Deal of the Day price at $55 vs. the everyday $74.99, this was a good find.  Am calling it practical b/c it has a hoodie, can be used as a rain coat or everyday jacket, and includes an inner layer that I can add or remove depending on whether it's cold or colder outside.  However, the Large size I bought was bigger than expected so I exchanged it for a smaller size.  I guess I should have remembered that London Fog items tend to run big.  If you're looking for a practical, everday jacket that allows you stay somewhat stylish under-the-radar, this would be a good choice.
B00BXT4M4M|1|The material is extremely thin and transparent, almost like tissue paper. The photo is beautiful; the product is not. That's a very talented photographer. I wouldn't buy any other dresses from this seller, considering the extremely low quality of this item.
B00CDBTF4Q|4|These jeans look good, the pocket is cute, and they fit like other size 6 jeans (Banana and J. Crew). They are also the perfect length. I usually need a 32&#34; for my inseam, so these work great. The material is a little stiff and a little thick... otherwise I'd probably wear these more often. The other complaint I have is that they are really quite low-cut. I like low-cut, but these take it to another level. And when you add a couple extra winter pounds, your butt crack seems to make a showing more often than you'd like. The Natalie bootcut would be the better choice for covering up your bootie during the winter extra 5-10lbs. ;)
B001I125GW|5|I had so many broomstick skirts before our home burned down. I got this one and liked it so much, I ordered the only other color presently available via Amazon and that is brown. I work in the Church Nursery and it allows me to play and romp with the toddlers and still be feminine and unwrinkled after 2 hrs. Waiting for other colors...hint, hint. Arrived early and well packaged. Thank you!
B007UWFU38|4|look and feel just as expected.
B002H9WMSA|5|great find for people that don`t appreciate only pink and blue. love it (seems very soft and comfy)
B0050T57BI|4|These mitts are warm and comfortable for my daughter who is two. They fit wonderfully although there is room to grow in them. If there had been more colours available in this size I would have gotten them as well. I bought a very similar, if not identical , pair in pink from another amazon hit, but they are huge. Though the material turned pilly after the first wash (They looked several months old), we don't care since my daughter wears them at home/out on jogs with me. Overall, a worthwhile purchase.
B005GNOH5A|5|Loved this bra when I was pregnant - minimized my all of a sudden huge bust, and gave it a nice shape.
B00NMKHS7I|1|These ARE beautiful bras. But the material they are made out of is very stiff and very uncomfortable. They seemed smaller in cup size and width so I had to take them off after a few hours wear because they hurt. I however am a bigger woman and I think that this may be for more thinner women although the design seems that it would be fine for bigger girls. They did let me return them. BUT they are coming from GREAT BRITAIN so the least amount of shipping to send them back is $15.
B007GBZYU2|5|Good quality material. hang dry and ready to wear
B001QD1QUS|4|I love them ,but when I ordered a second pair I ordered small isted of med. I haven't got much of a butt bout too much middle. The elastic waist in a small still fits my middle fine. Length was fine with both pairs.
B00L9DMT8S|4|Its OK
B00O0KWNLK|3|These sleeves are made of comfortable fabric, but if your arms have any muscle mass they will be very tight. Also, if you have longer arms, you will find the cut-off to be somewhere around the elbow bend area, which can constrict blood flow.<br /><br />I bought these to alleviate wrist aches while playing the piano, and it actually starts to crush my arm after a while. After a week of attempting to wear these every day they have started to unravel and fall apart. Be warned if you are expecting these to last a while.
B007IEFWG8|1|Saying false advertisement is an understatement. The costume looks nothing like the one on the picture. The only similarity is that it is pink and it does come with a wig. Apart from that, the dress, the cut, the material, the finish of the fabric, the so called belt (that is cut-out fabric instead of pretend rocks), the skirt, everything is so different from the picture they use to advertise it that I feel like I've been ripped off. This was supposed to be a nice looking costume, not something I could have done myself (and I have no sewing skills, so you'll imagine how bad this is).<br /><br />I'm pondering if it is even worth it to return it because I needed it for an activity this weekend and might not be able to get something else on time. I was so excited about this and now I am too disappointed to even want to go to this thing.<br /><br />I'm not buying from Rubie's Costumes Co again, there was no need for them to use a picture of a better costume if that is not what they are selling. It is a waste of my money and a waste of my time, both of which I could have spent getting something else that really corresponded to what I was being told I was getting.<br /><br />I guess I should add that even the picture on the package I received is different from the one shown. I really thought I was dealing with a serious company.<br /><br />Update August 10, 2013:<br /><br />I wanted to add a few more details to the review:<br />-The 'Jabot' is not scarf-looking or satin-looking like the one in the picture, it's a strap of stretchy and transparent-like fabric.<br />-The wig is not as depicted: it is bright pink instead of orange, so it doesn't correspond to a Pebble's costume.
B004K4595S|5|In love
B0002TOZ0A|5|The fit is about right,but they dont fit like earlier Gold Toe,they feel like Unistyle one foot fits all spandex like material.Good Price and Quantity for your money.
B00VSGI70U|5|I am small and I can never find undies that will  fit correctly these after wearing them a few hours they get a little loose but as soon as I wash them they go right back to the size I need..  Other type of undies that I have bought stretch out and stay streched out even after washing. The one size fits all made me a little hesitant to buy these. I am glad I did and will be buying more. Well worth the money to me.
B004OVELEM|5|Wear a different color to work each day and they still look great after a year of weekly washings.
B000SKLT52|4|I have size 11 feet and they feel a little small for me.  In retrospect I would by the size above. but maybe after wearing they will stretch out more and then I'll be glad I bought the size i did?  otherwise comfy and very cushy/thick feeling even after 2 washes.
B008VS8R30|1|the studs arent the same color, the material is cheap, and it fits like i'm wearing a little girls tank, it's nothing like the picture
B00I0BUZOM|5|I'm a mom of 4 kids with 3 boys under the age of 5. I look for high quality, UNIQUE/cool-hip stuff for my kids at good prices. I don't do Carter's, for example. I SCOUR the internet to find, for example, socks that I like for the kids. That being said, these are GREAT socks. Very good quality and so cute. Ample sizing--I purchased for my 14 month old and they should fit for at least 6 months or more. He is &#34;average&#34; size/ 50%ile. The traction on the bottom seems to be very good to avoid slipping for my wobbly walker, and they washed very well.
B002APVNS6|5|Typical Carhartt!
B000GHO5YO|5|Carhartt products are great, right out the gate.  The denim is strong and nicely pigmented.  The Carhartt overalls prove to be comfortable and sturdy time and again.  Plus: At this price, they cannot be beat.
B00QMLP0R4|5|My husband loves it!
B00LGXZO2E|5|Very happy with it. Excellent quality product
B005CSNWE6|5|goood
B00IABZ402|5|This is quite easily the best bra I've ever owned. Going to buy several more as soon as I get paid!
B00OIRT70U|4|Hard to give 5 stars for such a simple pair of shorts… but they wear and wash well.. sizing is as expected..
B00DS5C41C|5|Just great. My feet were a bit too big for the leg holes but i fixed that right up. Great product though.
B00X5W6C0W|4|Got to me really fast.  Very light weight wish i had a little more cover over certain areas over all great product.
B0076S9SQQ|3|A pretty good hat. I've never owned a Flexfit hat before so I didn't know what to expect. It fits snugly which is good but the elastic can leave an impression on your skin if worn for extended periods of time. My only real issue is that I wish the elastic band was somehow more absorbent.  I have a different (non fitted hat) that has a better sweat absorbent band and I would wear it more often but it's not fitted and it has a there logo on it. If you're looking for a nice fitted style hat that doesn't have any logos on it then this is the way to go.
B00EB70G5C|3|Pretty bra, but with flaws. First off, it keeps my boobs VERY separated from one another, which might be good for some, but it wasn't my favorite look for myself. Definitely not flattering for lower cut tops. Also unfortunately the cups are slightly tighter at the top, and although when I put it on it fits, I find myself popping out over the top after a bit of movement causing a minor quadboob situation. I think this also contributes to a look of downward pointing boobs. Luckily it is quite comfortable and sits really well under the breast and on the breastbone. I wouldn't recommend this bra for cold weather climates as it is completely unlined, sheer, and WILL show your nipples. I'm returning.
B00BAW42QA|3|i dunno what i was thinking when i bought it but hey i cant go back now so i enjoy wearing it to musi events
B004K405JS|5|Quick service and it came with everything it said it would online! It fit and never had to return it!!
B00LEDTQKW|5|It's really cute. Im almost 5'10 and a size 9 and this fits perfectly. A little short but nothing that can't be fixed by wearing shorts underneath.
B00CYPXVZ0|3|Battery pack has to be carried in the side . Makes it less appropriate for riding bikes or skate boards
B00A2X524Y|5|I ordered these for my Mother and she said they fit fine and is very happy with them. They were a Christmas gift.
B00HWMKEFA|5|love it
B00EVKOHC2|5|These are well made camo pants. My son has worn these multiple times and they still look new.  I wash them inside out.  He loves them and I like that they are well made.  Fit as expected.  This is his second pair and washing them inside out seems to help prevent fading.
B00F0L9Y7E|5|Although some reviewers found the print to be blurry, I've received nothing but compliments on these, and questions as to whether or not they are tattoos.  The thickness is actually really good, and are more opaque than any leggings I've bought in stores. The fit was great, I am fairly athletic, 5'9 and 165 pounds, and there is no muffin top or uncomfortable fit.
B008437G16|5|Perfect size for my need. Good price.
B009ESZFH2|1|I have bought other shirts for my boss with the same size, which fit.<br />This shirt ran too small.  Very unfortunate.
B0018282PY|5|very good
B00KRHYFZ2|4|I had another one of these in black and wanted a different color. While the price was higher thru Amazon than at the retail store where I bought the black example, it is identical in all other respects and fits as expected.
B00E9ANUB8|5|I love it,my co workers  are asking where did i buy them,they love it great buy
B00AO8GTI0|1|this is a spinnoff of artisticreation. i have an artisticreation shirt i bought off the official website and there are noticable differences. first of all there is no patch on the bottom that verifys it awthentic. the shirt dosent fit like real deal around the sleaves and the cotton feels cheap. plus the image wore off in the wash, so its really faded. dont waste your money people, its not worth it.
B002RXG5OI|4|I purchased this for my daughters historical figure presentation at school. After reading the previous reviews, I bought a size bigger and it fits perfectly! The quality is fine, it's a costume, I didn't expect super high quality for the price. I'm not disappointed and would purchase from this company again.
B00MBCGH20|5|This is beautiful!!!
B00CRDITV0|5|Delivered as promised, super cute and something we will get multiple wears from over the years.
B00LNEC2DK|4|Nice quality.  It does fit small so definitely check the sizing chart. I would recommend for purchase.
B0054N2SRQ|1|I was happy with the last set I purchased, but these don't fit as good and have a cheaper quality material. They almost look like women's lingerie because they are loose around the legs. I won't be buying anything from Hugo Boss again. Rip me off once, shame on you. Rip me off twice, shame on me.
B000MCG6SG|5|this is really useful.  nice apron.  the pockets are really helpful and the color matches decor really well I dare say
B00O8B9F8A|5|i looked amazing in this dress, same fitting as on the picture, awesome buy, if you dare to be different get it.
B00CQ4BBIS|5|My grandchild will arrive in July. Her mother said this was her favorite outfit so far! Thanks for everyone's great reviews. You can't beat the price and it's Carter's, a trusted brand.
B00C6U9S8C|4|There are so many parts to this outfit that it's great to customize it. I ended up leaving the bolero at home since it was a bit too warm to wear out dancing. The boa is cute. For the second party, I just wore a sheet bodysuit under the dress went sans accessories.
B000M8T7D6|3|This seller takes almost a month to process your order before they ship, so be prepared to wait. I got my bikini 20 days after I ordered.<br />As another reviewer stated, the bottom has a Brazilian cut and from the back, it looks like a tube top one piece bathing suit. You can see the cut outs of the side from the back though.  The picture doesn't show the side of the bottom (hip). It's not stitched together but held to together by string, similar to the bust region. It is quite cute.<br />I ordered a Small size. I'm 5'2 and about 115 pounds.  The bust region does not cover me well (I'm a C-cup).  I really wish there was more fabric in the bust area to cover me.  There is not much support in that region either.  It does cover my bust, its just really revealing. The back of the suit does not hug my back so it's a little strange, it tends to hang straight rather than fall into the curve of my back.  If I turn to the side, I can see the back of my bathing suit through the side cut out.  I have to tie the string very tight in order for the bathing suit to stay covered over my bust, and it hurts my neck. Overall fit is ok.  I would probably buy it again if I could go back because its so cheap and its unique.
B003VW6T3G|5|This belt is made with high quality materials, and it has a great look to it. I think Ill buy it in many different colors!
B00LUCL3F8|5|VERY NICE COAT, FAST DELIVERY, AND PRETTY COLOR.
B000MFVU1Q|1|The skirt on this swimdress fell much higher than I expected from the picture.  I'm not sure if mine was defective or not but the skirt was not as long as the one in the picture and made my hips actually appear larger (I'm a size 4).  Newport News didn't charge me to ship it back to them, but I'm out the cost of shipping it to me initially.  All the reviews were glowing and that's why I purchased it.  I've learned my lesson...never buy a swimsuit without trying it on first.
B00AB0AX4C|5|It is great, sometime I even can't feel it in my pocket, it is really slim, but useful
B00QNF6M44|5|Adorable
B005CSNWEG|5|I really like these sweatpants.  They are not baggy around the hips and thighs.  They hang well and keep their length pretty well too.  They sit at, not below, the waist and are a good medium weight that feels warm on chilly days but not hot other times of the year.
B004BRJ3UG|5|Fabulous quality, great colorful patterns. Pricey but worth the cost! Look forward to more pattern options being offered. My son loves them and he's really particular about what he wears.
B003TY5ZDQ|5|this top is so cool i love the styling of it i will be getting one of these and be the first to get it around this way man utd for ever
B0071NRQQ0|4|These were a little bit smaller than I expected. Still fit great, thought and they are very soft and comfortable.
B0081GC3AK|4|We don't subscribe to the theory of evolution however it was cute and my son, who's an avid hockey player and enthusiast, enjoyed receiving it for Christmas.
B008G3L75U|5|The shirt was a  birth day gift for my boyfriend. It fit like a glove and he absolutely  loves it!
B00NS4XI3Q|1|The Color displayed looks khaki but is really olive. Buyer beware
B0055FFM94|1|these caps are very small, they appear to fit a childs head not an adult
B001PO6GR6|1|I found the garment to be \\"for me\\" uncomfortable.  I am a size 40B but my torso is larger.  I can't seem to find a body shaper that expands to meet the torso not just the bust.  It is either too short from the bust to the crotch (as this body shaper was for me) or the fit is not snug enough or both as is with this shaper.<br /><br />I am basing this on MY body.  For me, uncomfortable.  I wish some of these leading name brand makers would consider the squatty body women.  Very few of us are slim and trim enough to get away with this type of briefer.  It just did not fit well or comfortably.  The middle torso was squashed together because the garment did not stretch enough to contain the girth in the middle and around the back.  If I had ordered a larger size, then the breast cup would have been too large and I would not have support for my breast.  Design one for the squatty body.<br /><br />Thank you.
B0081X5MBA|5|I bought this for my 10 month old son, and am very pleased.  It's cute, and the quality seems good.  I wasn't sure whether to order the 12 month or the 18 month size, but I ordered the 12 month size and it fits perfectly!  My son is 10 months old and in the 50%tile for both height and weight.
B00E0IXF4G|3|Love the shirt but would order one size up if u like ur shirts lose the material is a little stiff
B001EVF17G|4|Runs large suggest order a size or two smaller than needed in band size, cups are more accurate.
B00850WLP4|4|I love gripper socks almost as much as chocolate.  My feet are always cold and these guys do the job.  These are a little big for my 5.5 foot; however, they keep my feet warm and keep me standing upright, as opposed to falling down.
B007RX4KEU|5|The costume is great and it got here alot faster than expected
B003N9BT3M|3|... and it works but I don't like it as much as the previous model that they replaced this with. It has a little bit more padding (which I don't need) and it just seems to not fit as well ... cant put my finger on it.
B0042U14RC|5|Excellent accessory for Glinda costume.
B0058ZYB34|5|Nice jeans good price, delivered quickly too!
B006WSEJWY|5|I bought these for my Granddaughters birthday gift.  When I asked her if she wouldl ike them she said they were perfect. So that is why I am giving them high marks.
B006YL7N4K|4|I ordered them previously and I loved them. Therefore, I ordered one for my sister. She likes them as well.
B00L3KOEGC|3|Ok
B00N9L0J30|1|These leggings are so thin, you can see right through them. These leggings should be classified as stockings. These leggings are not made of the same material used on the other Egyptian leggings from the same seller. I'm disappointed and Returning.
B0085ITFXC|4|I bought this hat for $8 on here... I took a gamble cause I couldnt really figure out what a size small was... but since it said baby-infant, and I live in MN, my newborn would probably wear it sometime this fall/winter/spring..... Well what I got was a size small TODDLER not a baby or infant product at all. Strange, cause even looking at the Zutano website after the fact, the Gnome hat size small range is 6-12 months. no separate toddler size at all (?)  I will say it is well made and cute.  Will probably give as a gift since I only paid $8, it is not worth returning.  Cannot comment on the fit cause it is way to big at the moment.
B00IB7LWGA|1|quite frankly horrible.  I had high expectations on these after reading reviews.  they are to big, they roll and they are not slimming in any way :( very disappointed I paid for these!
B002P2P0MY|3|So far I'm hoping the material does not get stained with bleach, other wise I will be ordering vestex products for scrubs since I work a lot with bleach. Material is great so far no bleach stains compared to Cherokee scrubs I bought from Amazon which are completely stained. Would order Landau again but smaller. Will be ordering again but small size.
B000811EWY|5|Got this for my dad to where.  Always wears a hat, and drives a vet.  He likes it.  Very pleased.
B00181BJEG|5|I turned this into my &#34;Winnie&#34; wig for my Hocus Pocus costume.  worked great!
B00KFEFHYK|4|Pretty cool a little too long it kinda covers my boobs so don't think you can wear this underneath clothing it will show
B00KM5QDZE|5|This is hilarious, and I love wearing it. The hood is sort of strange, but its awesome, and sometimes I wear it around the house. Super comfy and warm.
B001A674UW|5|This is my favorite scrub jacket. I usually buy Dickies scrub jackets because they're durable, comfortable and have the side cuts in the hip area. I am between a medium and a large, but in this style I buy a medium because they tend to fit a little big, which in my opinion is a good thing since I'm a dental hygienist and move around a lot during the day.
B001JJJIUE|5|Good product
B00Q8NCQB4|5|Great
B001MQ9P9S|2|paid for it, never got it. pfffttttt
B0097M9OMC|2|These were much larger than expected and the material was thin. Not at all the quality we always expect from Jockey. We've returned them for a refund.
B002KJ7DHC|5|Wore the outfit at a 70's party. Great fit!
B00362QDHI|5|I just received this shirt in the mail. It is great quality and fits well. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and any mars fan should have this ABL shirt.
B00BCN939I|4|I love these patterned leggings. The atomic bomb print is perfect for when I am feeling explosive on the inside. I have only worn them once, but they should be fun for the fall.
B00F0T01GY|5|Gr8 product
B00IVDXSEI|4|Like one of the reviewers mentioned, the material is not thick but that's what I love about the skirt. Not see thru at all. Just light weight modal jersey. I got this in 4 colors including the gardenia (white). You will need spanx but most of us (over 30) wear them anyway for a smooth appearance. I'm 5 feet and the skirt falls to around my ankles so not a midi on me. I like that because it makes it different!! The ruching on the sides makes it very sexy yet still appropriate for work. When I ordered the first skirt, I initially got the large but it was huge, especially in the waist. I'm a 6-8 and usually a medium but I'm very curvy with a badunkadunk (lol). The only size left was a small and to my amazement it fit perfectly. There is some give in it because of the jersey material. Glad the prices dropped so I snatched up the other colors (all but black). Highly recommend.
B00AFQG2T2|3|it's a bit bigger then I wanted but it's too later to return.
B003UO67IM|5|I ordered these gloves to replace a stolen new pair of $75 driving gloves made by Dent's of England (world's oldest glovemaker) have to say that I'm EXCEPTIONALLY PLEASED with these! The stitching and very thin leather (feels like kid leather, perhaps) are high quality and well finished; there are no loose threads, and most important, the fit shows that these are well designed for a man's hand, in that the finger length is not too long, proportionally, to the size of the palm. My hand circumference around the knuckles is between 8.5 and 9 inches, so I ordered a \\"Large\\" which is equivalent to a Size 9 appropriate for me, and the fit was excellent-- snug but not tight, with a perfect finger length. [Please note that a woman with typically longer fingers and a more slender palm might find these either loose around the palm or too short in the finger length.] The sense of finger touch through the thin flexible leather is very good. Now, if only these were offered in tan leather as well as the colors shown (the dark brown color shown in the image is an accurate representation, BTW). Excellent gloves, and at this low price (they're made in China, of course), a no-brainer decision. You won't be disappointed.
B00FXQV8QG|1|So small my size 6 daughter wasn't even comfortAble in it.  The design shown is deceptive because while wearing it, the two sides in the front don't overlap or even come close.  Can't figure out where the shoulders are supposed to be!
B007HRYQNQ|5|Cannot get enough of these.
B00GJ32E38|5|I love it
B00H40S2WW|5|Love it
B0064KU7UI|4|I have been on a diet for a while now and loosing weight.  I lost enough weight that I now need a smaller belt.  I purchased this belt and it's a great belt. However the drawback to this belt seems to be when your cloths are to big it doesn't do the best job of being the sole thing to hold your pants up.  Though being honest I can't say that this is really the belt's fault, since if my pants where the right size they would stay up on their own.  Over all the quality is nice, though I think the leather feels a little cheap where the holes are, maybe that's just me. Overall a good quality belt that will have  some strechyness on it for if you gain or loose a little weight.
B001I6QJPU|5|The shirt the color I was looking for and it fits well.
B00WO4HKS0|5|Is very nice, I love this produc!..
B0045BTJ6G|5|My child has had super sensitive feet since she was a toddler. However, it's been very difficult to find seamless socks now that her feet have grown into the ladies' sizes. I searched far and wide online and finally decided to try these. She likes them. They're not too thick which is nice. They stay up on her legs and they fit with no seams on the toes. She's happy with them so I'm happy with them. I bought two pairs each of the black and the tan and I plan to buy a couple more colors now that we know they work for her.
B00CVS489I|5|Fits great!  I receive compliments every time I wear it. I bought it for a cruise and felt comfortable walking around the ship with this and a pair of shorts.
B009K0TVAG|5|Ordered these for my 18 year old daughter that wanted the high-waist style. Hard to find in stores, I might add. but happy ending cause she loves them and they look great on her. Would recommend to others looking for this style.
B00AMTRTOO|5|Never owned anything like this.  Needed it to snow blow this winter and my husband loves it. Not sure what the 6 different ways to wear it are but we are very happy.
B0091SLSWQ|5|Best shirt I have ever ordered ordered a second one after receiving this one. hides all the imperfects of a plus size woman. Excellent quality.
B005442PUA|5|Bought this for my son for Christmas.  He works outside winter/summer and needs protection from the cold.  Very pleased with the fit, color and the warmth.
B0002TOTL0|4|My doc told me to wear stretch socks especially on long flights.  I find them to be comfortable if a little awkward to put on.  I haven't had them long enough to determine how they will stand up to repeated washing, but so far so good.  They seem to be doing their job.
B00K0VQ210|5|nice slippers
B003PWCPJ4|5|i could not find this anywhere in New Mexico, every where was sold out!! Was a great gift for my husband
B00H1I2RNW|4|I'm usually a M & that's what I orderd, tad bit tight in the bottoms but not unwearable. Quality is good, looks just as pictured.
B00LM7D4I0|5|I wore this dress a couple of weeks ago and got lots of compliments. It's a pretty dress that's not too heavy for spring. it fits nicely but is not form fitting.
B00VWFT8KK|5|I love this suite.. awesome for size 14-16 body type..hourglass.. good deal
B00NVLQ6TY|3|I love the way they look, but portion of cuff is already unraveling!!
B00NYXZ5D2|4|Here are my stats I'm 5'10&#34; 150lbs with a lean muscular build. I went with the large size instead of the medium I normally wear. Because these are 100% cotton and I planned for them to shrink in the wash and they did. Not much that they were unwearable, but just enough to be comfortable for working out in and not ride up. They are well made and the material is quite thick. Great for when the weather is cooler.
B001PU9A9Q|5|Fabulous.
B0060WDCIY|5|My boyfriend was in serious need of new undies so I searched the Calvin Klein page and picked out a variety of models and colors. This one, along with the Bold, were his two favorite. They fit true to size and according to him don't &#34;ride up&#34; and still feel fresh at the end of the day!
B00KFVR41C|5|This dress is beautiful and it fits great. I cannot wait to wear it! The quality of the fabric is also better than i expected.
B00KT2PUC2|5|I love it
B000TA39FY|5|so comfy
B003XXXD3M|5|Loved the fit, the sweatshirt has a little stretch so that it fits a lady's body nicely over skinny jeans - not bulky at all.
B009SRQ80M|5|Its was exactly what I wanted.<br />Anyone that is into this game would love this shirt. .My grandson will be so happy when he gets this for Christmas.
B00DQMCJ94|5|This is beautiful!
B00ESMUGN2|2|Like the fit and the colors, however one of the pairs of socks, the stripped ones, had a hole at the ankle area after one wearing.  Am  waiting to see if the same thing happens to the other pairs.
B006H6XGO8|5|This shirt fits me exactly as I was hoping it would. I feel that with the medium, some people might find it to be slightly snug on them, but that's actually what I wanted. If you do not want something that clings to you, you might want to go one size bigger than what you typically wear in a t-shirt.
B007OVAUKI|4|I am 5'3 and 120 lbs and the medium was WAY too big!! I could fit my both of my legs in one leg! So I bought a small instead and they are perfect!! The material isn't too itchy and has lots of pockets. I love the junior fit!
B00TJ59HVA|5|granddaughter loved it...
B005DJ8L2C|5|Excellent
B00E994FQI|1|Way to small
B00WAW08BM|1|Too small and terrible material
B00M0IHXXW|5|Cute and soft
B003T9T5UU|3|This wig is not quite the same color as the picture, it is a bit more black. the quality is really good, better than I expected. But for the money, this is really good for a halloween costumes.
B00BLXN8IG|5|Love love love! It is very hard to find SEXY big bust bras! In most cases I find you compromise somewhere: either in support or sexiness. Who wants that! I am a 34g and it fit perfectly. Fully supported but very sculpted and appealing. Also the straps are the perfect width so they add enough support so they don't cut into your shoulders but on the other hand you don't feel like you're wearing shoulder pads! In addition it provides the right amount of coverage (if you know what i mean) over parts of the breast that like to stick out and embarass you. All said Great buy
B00D6ZIXRS|4|It was a rather tight fit, and being only 5'3&#34;, I had to shorten the length of the dress. Other than that, I really liked the way the dress looked on me.
B00Y5646FA|5|Beautiful!!!!! Fits and looks perfect... Will buy again. Material feels and looks expensive. Thank you
B00NBT4F4O|5|Good outfit
B00R32D4RO|4|Material looked a bit too matronly for my age. Very pretty and did hide a lot of flaws because it basically hung from the shoulders. Sort of tent like. Woukd wear it for wedding - mother of the groom - but my 23 year old son has no plans of getting married s trine soon. Lol. Will be returning the dress.
B00UVPWA2A|5|I was hesitant to buy a bathing suit over the Internet but I'm really happy i did!! I ordered the medium and it fits me perfect! I'm 5'2 126lbs and wear a 34 DD. I have purchased one piece suits before where it fit body wise but to small in the breast area. This suit fit like it was made costum for me! But even if you have smaller breast, this will still work because it actually fit so good that it minimized my breast and belly which is what I was hoping for!! Also great qaulity and great price!
B005PTQZOG|4|I was looking for a small plastic LED flashlight which could drop into a running computer without shorting things out.  When I saw this product, there were no comments, and almost no description at all.  As it turns out, it is plastic, but not small.  It is 3 separate plastic LED flashlights which fit into a central handle which doubles as a vertical stand.  Each flashlight can be removed and used independently.<br /><br />Each flashlight takes 2 AAA cells and has a single modern bright white LED, plus a much dimmer blinking red LED.  Each somewhat stiff mechanical push-switch rotates through off-white-off-red.  There is a clear plastic band around each top, which shows the blinking red LED from the side.  The white LED produces a well-defined spot.  The lamp heads each adjust from straight out (held horizontally) past vertical to back at the user, over the button.  When held as a unit (about the size of an old-style incandescent flashlight), the beams can merge into a common bright spot.  Or the heads can be adjusted, thus spreading the light much wider.  When vertical on the stand, each light spot can be adjusted as close as a foot or so from the base, or reflect off the ceiling, or combinations thereof.<br /><br />The stand is unique.  It not only holds the 3 flashlights, it supports them vertically, with 3 legs that pop out.  The latch is magnetic and each leg is easy to flip out, making the release button on the bottom more cute than useful.  When the legs fold in, we get an old-style flashlight, now with LED's, 6 batteries and 3 buttons.  When the legs fold out, we get a storage stand, or a tent light, or a work light.  Cute.
B00KDCBPFY|2|Size chart not correct but overall great product
B00DRLJLVS|5|I bought this for my grandson for a birthday gift.  He loves it and shows it off to his friends in school.  They think it's sweet
B00WS9I7Z6|1|This is a shirt not a dress
B00EHSO8I6|1|Way too small. Can't even wear
B00DWBX7U4|4|Size was right on, nice shirt.  Came just as product was described, sealed in plastic bag and did not smell fun.
B00KYAPD1C|5|Great conversation starter. Quality is excellent.
B00EVVX5EC|1|Way too small. The package actually said youth large instead of an adult size. Misleading to say one size fits all.
B00B5EDYAI|1|Too big felt very cheap to the touch
B00A7B21O0|5|Great bag! My son uses this for his football gear and it holds up great.
B00UBMYA80|5|Adorable and good quality!
B00E8CMFX6|1|gave to a friend to small and very cheap looking. not happy cost more to send back work two job  have no time to go to post office yuk
B004HL64OE|5|I ordered these pants for my dad following major surgery.  They are comfortable and the fabric washes well.  A bonus is that he can wear them for CT scans as they have no metal buttons, grommets, or zippers.  I only wish that I could get them in navy too!
B00QE1NCIG|5|Feels, looks, and fits exactly like a Triangl bathing suit but $80 cheaper!
B00066NAPK|4|The pouch that I received is a nice rich brown leather. This pouch has heavy duty zippers. A small waisted man could very well use it. There was only one negative about this product and that was the belt...too small for a larger person! I felt that I liked it enough to sew a section in the middle and it looks great. The price was great! The seller shipped fast and they did a wonderful job of packing. Thanks for my fanny pouch, I do realize this seller is more than likely one of many and not the maker.
B006FE7BFM|5|The wig is awesome! It's better than I thought it would be! It's very soft and I really love the color as length :) the bangs are a little long but I don't mind! It even came a day before it was suppose to!
B00UNYXJX8|5|Precious
B00IQG8872|5|I bought this because it looked so hot in the picture, but I was expecting disappointment because that's usually the outcome when I buy clothes like this on amazon. However this was different.. I'm very curvy (skinny, but heavy chested haha) and this fit SO perfect! Very sexy and spot on with the picture. And cheap! Great product, highly recommend :)
B00PJ3OBBW|5|Great Christmas gift. Fast delivery.
B00I7XI96Y|5|Exactly as shows
B00Q8J9L5C|5|Very Cute hat true navy blue with a little bling love it.
B0043OA1A8|3|wife loved this hoodie
B0006I8ILE|5|I discovered these years ago and am thrilled that Vanity Fair is still making these panties.  They cover my largish rear perfectly and NEVER ride up, even as they become old & worn.  I machine wash AND dry them and they wear beautifully.  Because they have a satiny finish, pants slide right over them.  I wouldn't CHANGE a thing about them; I just wish they were available in additional colors and prints.  I had a leopard pair years ago and I miss them!
B00NYFCXQ2|5|I read the reviews that said that it runs a tad small, so I ordered up a size and it fits perfect. its lightweight but still keeps me comfortable. the color looks exactly the way it does on the computer. perfect zip up for the fall or spring.
B00B2IAIJW|4|Bought this for my hubby and now its his new favourite. He loves the colours, fit and feel. Almosy wearing it right out of the wash...lol
B0086TZ2LO|5|it{s very good
B00EC40NRA|4|Same thing-I bought 12 month and 2T in store. Red with white dots-reindeer emblem. I wanted to order a 5T but had to settle for size 6 in this pattern. When I received order it is solid red with reindeer emblem and feet. It will still work for the 3 boys Christmas Eve picture. But I was surprised that a substitute was sent instead of the polka dot.
B000NWP3N4|5|Great for riding or going to town in. Excellent fit. Will always have these as long as they make them. Good denim wei g h t on them drop
B00EI53NW0|5|Great!
B000WR3S82|5|The Costume was perfect... looked and fit great. It shipped early too! Who could ask for more!
B00OOL67Y4|4|This dress was very pretty and unique, really liked the gold detail and the zippers. However I didn't think it was exactly business attire, at least not for me. Maybe depending on your office atmosphere, not that it wasn't appropriate just that it seemed too dressy, more for a formal club or party, or nice evening out. I did inquire about the length on me (5' 7&#34;), which turned out to be just ok work-appropriate wise, a few inches above my knee; but the way the bottom hugged my lower thighs and the lower half material being almost silky with no give, made it slowly slide up as I walked. I did order a small but it fit perfectly everywhere else so if I went a size up it would've been too big around the waist and hips, where it already had a looser bunched up look. Overall a nice dress, loved the pattern and zippered top, comfortable material up top; and maybe at another time, for a different occasion I would've kept it, but prioritizing my purchases right now.
B00GB8EA8I|4|The sash could be a little longer and an inside tie would be nice. The material is awesome though, very luxurious!
B000PY9ZPW|5|I HAVE WORN SUPPORT UNDERWEAR FOR YEARS.  IT HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO FIND SUPPORT WEAR THAT FITS AND THAT IS QUALITY. BUT, I HAVE FINALLY FOUND THE SUPPORT WEAR FROM UNDERWORKS. THEY ARE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY AND THEY FIT FOR A CHANGE.  USUALLY MY SUPPORT WEAR IS NOT LONG ENOUGH AND JUST DOES NOT FEEL RIGHT. FINALLY I HAVE FOUND JUST PERFECT SUPPORT WEAR. IN FACT I HAVE ORDERED A COUPLE MORE.  TRY IT ..YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID. GO ON LINE UNDER AMAZON AND PLUG IN SUPPORT UNDERWEAR.
B0001HKL2Y|5|Before I washed it, it was very scratchy. Now one of the most comfortable, supportive brass I have ever had. The cup is only slightly big, but I fluctuate so much, it's perfect most of the time.  Very please with it!!
B00JABIYB2|5|Very pleased :-) But I must say I could have ordered an XS
B00G7JF59O|3|The fit was to be expected because it is an adult small they are a little long for my son who is 12!  I wish they made a child size in the PJs.  The color and print are beautiful.
B000LX4VDS|5|This is great- exactly what I wanted and it was delivered quickly!  I would definitely order from again-- thanks!
B00K16U6J8|4|Small rip in seam upon arrival :(<br />Ruined it for me!
B001O9BENS|4|These boxers work well, they're are reasonably priced and are pretty comfortable.  Overall I'm pretty happy with them.
B00D1W5WSE|3|items were to large even though I based my order on the size chart that was provided. Very very. Disappointed.
B00817DYUM|5|We love these t-shirts. Very comfortable. I buy them for my sons and husband all the time.<br />We all wear them.
B00N5TIM12|5|Ordered 2 in different patterns.  Reading the review I wasn't sure what to expect.  It is a sheer chiffon  and huge!  The sleeves hit my elbows.  I wear a long sleeve cream colored scoop neck tee under it and its amazing!  Very billowy and comfortable.  The neck is wide and I could definately  wear it off the shoulder.  Its been washed several times without shrinking but never dried.  It is the perfect thing to put on when I want something a little funkier.  I wear a size 12 shirt and ordered the XL.  It hangs well below my waist but being so sheer it isn't  frumpy.  I get a ton of compliments every time I wear this.
B004TERHUO|5|This bed jacket is soft and lightweight. Perfect for someone who needs something special while going through physical illness.I liked the idea of 3/4 sleeves because they to not land in the food plate. The color was very nice. We chose the lavender, and it was a good choice. I am not sure if it has been laundered but I am sure it will do fine.
B0047CUKPM|4|Love this wallet. Plenty of room for all my cards and bills.
B00A73XDTK|5|i love it
B00IIUGVIE|1|Although advertised as a children's shirt, these came as youth shirts and were much too large. I consulted the size chart before buying and picked the size that corresponded to my chidren's sizes, and that clearly was very misleading. I am returning the shirts. Too bad, because if they were the right size they would have been cute on my boys.
B002OF3HJK|5|My hubby LOVED it and all his army buddies wanted to know where he got it. Yeah this wife did good!
B00FECM8JU|5|I love this scarf so much it is exactly what I was looking for. I ordered another for my daughter and my coworker asked me to order two for her and daughter she loved mine so much.  The colors are vivid, they are 100% silk and very soft to the touch.  it took about two weeks to arrive and was packaged very well and the scarves come with their very own carrying case.  Nice when you need to travel with them.<br /><br />Update: Don't order this I believe it had some sort of mite, not to mention the color runs like crazy.
B005E1KR2Q|3|Decent quality, great experience with the seller.
B000CMOP8E|5|Everything went just fine. fast service, size was right.       thanks
B001PKUX6U|5|The jacket was a great gift! It was a wonderful find when I wasn't even looking for it!! The quality was exactly what I would expect from,Columbia products.
B00CG6FT48|5|This is not the picture of the product!  The dress fits very nice! Love it! The decollate is a little deep but i sewed it up and am wearing the dress in both red and black to work!!!
B00FPBEQB8|3|Love the shirt!  It was a gift for the Hubby.  He loved it, except it wasn't sized properly.  It was the equivalent of a medium...maybe a large...and I ordered an XXL.
B00MWQLHQG|3|Everything was good however mask is NOT the one from picture it is plastic and hurts ur eyes
B003PITK5U|4|Quality and overall fit is good, however another two inches in sleeve length would be better.
B00LXIUU7G|5|Good quality, cute socks.
B00D1H02U2|5|My 15 year old son loves the pants. My husband does not?<br />They wash well. Remind me of MC Hammer
B00BQ7XLPM|5|nice blend of cotton & linen. Fits well and looks cute. Like the gold imitation metal part. Can be worn to work or out to a restaurant.
B00JSJ4FZA|5|just right says goldie locks
B005GXRCLG|5|I was so happy to have found this discontinued wallet. It was my husbands' favorite now I have a successful Christmas gift!
B00AW47O6W|5|Best scarf I've had. Warm and looks great.
B00OQRQQSI|2|I'm very disappointed in the crazy colors in the package I received.  What happened to black and grey, like the colors in the picture shown?  I received a package with a solid green, striped green, red, royal blue and striped blue.  I'll be lucky if my son will wear any of these.  What a waste of my money!  He loves Hanes, but these colors are ridiculous!
B0078YZ45M|5|These are simply adorable, I just wore them to practice last night over my leggings. They are triple F: Fun, Frilly, Flirty!!! Great for derby.
B00FHK79D4|5|Very nice and fits very well, I have this in the white as we'll love them both will order again.
B00QEDMXK2|4|I got these for my 6 1/2 year old to wear under a costume. Fit him well (so size up if you're on the fence). They are a little thin but look good and do the trick.
B00PN4VGMO|5|This is adorable!!
B00K65DJTI|3|The fabric is okay. Runs super small. I am 5'4&#34; and 150lbs  and wore it a few times with tights for concerts but it fits my 11 year old niece better, she is 5'2 and 85lbs(all muscle!). Comes right above the knee on her and looks supper trendy for a 11 year old.
B00K5ODASU|3|Sleeves and ankle areas a little too tight on grandson.<br />He wanted to take them off. Uncomfortable in those areas.
B007L6V0A0|5|The Carpet Dancers really do allow you to glide on carpet while doing Zumba! Perfect for gliding exercises at home.
B007P295PM|5|I read about these socks on a running blog and decided to give them a try.  They perform better than expected and have become my new go-to sock for marathon training.  A perfect thickness and material composition to handle any sweat or irritation issue during a workout.  Highly recommend!
B00DQTOS7I|2|This run REALLY small.  They also are cut a bit strange.  The maternity band on them starts too low on the pants, so you have to...give yourself a wedgie... in order for the band to cover your butt. :)
B002MJV75E|4|The quality of this shirt is good, fit my husband nicely and cleaned up well. would order this again if need be.
B00EUM6NZU|5|got plenty of compliments and would use it again, pretty sexy costume does not come with abs though ha ha
B005GYGEXM|3|These are totally fine and functional if you are looking for affordable workout clothes. I bought these because I was running the tough mudder and wanted comfortable gym pants and didn't want to ruin my more expensive performance wear. I think if you are doing yoga these would be great. But running, they didn't feel super secure in the waist and weren't the ideal fit.
B003O0NLQ8|4|I have been looking for a pair of pants that could double for both business meetings, as well as when i coach sports.  these are the pants, baby!  they are so light and comfortable.  and dockers always make good stuff.  the lenght runs long, so if you are short like me, go with the 29\\" inseam.  i will next time.  but the 30s are good enough.  they go great with black or maroon shoes.  i think you will like them.
B00BSZQ7GC|5|I loved the look of the whole outfit. Who doesn't want a picture of their baby in a tutu with angel wings? I really liked that the top & bottom was two separate pieces. So if they outgrow one piece you can still wear the piece that fits with something else. Or if the top gets soiled, you can replace with another. I like to get my money's worth. I thought this skirt & flower would last awhile, we'll just have to keep changing the shirts for alittle while.
B003KQ696A|5|This is the best navy watch cap I have owned since...well, since I was in the navy. Don't confuse this cap with the cheap so-called official watch caps you will find at bargain stores. This cap will actually keep you warm.
B00J1JIA0I|3|The bra is nice, but very big.
B00GGE1P9E|5|Comfortable. Good Quality. Very flattering fit. Patty Boutik is always a good buy
B000A38FKO|5|Great shirt at a great price!
B00846IRWA|5|This is an adorable bag for my granddaughter.
B00IYV34TG|5|I needed a bag to use while traveling that would accommodate all of my &#34;stuff&#34;.  I love the many secured zipper pockets and the extra wide shoulder strap (adjustable).  It's on the big side so I may reserve it for out of town use.  Haven't decided yet.
B0011YUJZK|5|You can not beat Wacoal!! I have gone through many different brands and hands down it is the best. It's quality!
B00MHDXQ2C|5|😍😍in-love with this top!!
B0013FTLJW|5|We recieve the dress I order for my daughter for her prom.  The color that is displayed is not what I recieved.  It is a beautiful dress. We expected the color thats on the picture.
B00LO1RSM2|4|Is very comfortable to wear
B00N1XXWEY|1|This was supposed to be a women's shirt, but it's cut like a men's shirt. HUGE shoulders, not at all like it looks in the picture. I would not get this again.
B00KD6PDIK|5|good
B008I8U9RA|4|It was good just one problem but not a really big deal to me one sock was in the package
B0080YFYU4|3|Too high, not soft enough, band rubs the forehead.
B003VRKSWY|1|Very disappointed .....Wasted my hard earned money on this... I bought 2 after waiting quite a while for a previous product i bought to come back in stock....
B006HV5MBI|2|too small . the flap is too short
B00EPDXMO4|2|The material was also heavier than the other dresses in this category.  The pink and blues fit perfectly.
B0085IU27A|5|Items got here within two business days, and I love the quality of it. Looks just like a satin pink Victoria's Secret robe which i exactly what I wanted. I'm so happy with my order!
B00AZW2ZOM|3|Nice basic work shirt.  This is a very loose fitting shirt, but if I went down a size it would not fit in the chest.
B00MECJEP4|5|Love it
B00AJXO2WA|4|Very comfortable
B007WRIERA|5|I was sent the wrong size.  Mountain Warehouse went above and beyond what I expected and I am very satisfied.
B00EZJ1AEM|5|This was the best outfit ! I really liked it  I recommend it is really nice it's very cute .
B004WP64RC|5|This is a great jacket!  It fits nice; a little roomy but perfect if you have some layers underneath.  Has kept me nice and warm this past week in the frigid cold, and is very well constructed.  Very happy with the purchase!!
B000N8TK2I|4|The fit is really great I love it the quality is not bad as well I will be ordering more soon
B00OLJUWL8|5|Love this dress......it fits so nice and comfortable. Will be buying again. Arrived as expected.
B00GV5XIIY|2|When I ordered this item, I thought the material was going to be one that work-out pants would be made in. Instead, the material is thin and soft, which definitely feels like pajama bottoms instead of sweat pants. Honestly, I don't know if I will wear these with my fellow work-out partners...Don't want to make them think that I just woke up from bed. Also, there is a two-string draw-string to tighten the waist-ban since it is very loose compared to the minimum length. (I am 5'11, 29&#34; waist). This is good, since I am now able to wear the pants, but the quality of the string is very thin. Therefore, if the string breaks mid-way inside the waist-ban, then there wouldn't be much of a recovery. In conclusion, if you don't plan on being too active while wearing these, and are okay with wearing them as a pair of pajama-ish pants, then go for it.
B002HJ377A|5|This morning I awoke early and ran downstairs to open my Christmas presents. A pile of Amazon.com boxes awaited me. As I was deciding which to open first, I noted that I was drawn to one in particular. I felt that there was some intrinsic power within that I needed to release immediately. I grabbed it and ripped it open to find that I now was in possession of the awesome powers of the TWM shirt. Donning it post haste, I told my husband that I wanted to try it out right away. He had some doubts about its amazing powers, especially when worn on the torso of a female, but I could just feel the magic running through me. I dragged him out to the only place I could think of that was open on Christmas Day. Denny's. Within minutes the waiter was greeting us, seating us, and pulling out a special menu just for us. He could not stay away from our table the entire meal. It was like he was hypnotized by some unseen force. Finally, as he brought us the bill, he turned to me and said:  \\"I didn't charge you for your meal, mam. Merry Christmas.\\"    True story.
B00JMB1EEE|5|Love it! A must have accessory for anyone's wardrobe. I've worn it with a dress And a long sleeve blouse. A very versatile acessory that you can can wear with so many different wardrobe pieces.
B00FEJ6VMI|4|Snug for a size 10. Will be sure to wash in cold water! Like the color and grips. Wished in Pilates class for treads on the toes.
B00LH6HE7I|5|Like very much the item
B00866IYGW|5|I love these products from this seller.  They are amazingly comfortable and flattering, and they look good with shorts, capris, and jeans.  Also, I can seldom go bra-less, but this has several gauzy layers, so I can almost get away with it. I will always patronize this seller!
B00GOHS2VM|5|perfect for kids who just want to play in the snow and not worry about hats falling off.
B007IPIFW0|3|Very nice wallet! However, was disappointed to recieve the authenticity card since it does not let you know the player whose jersey it is.
B004H2GPV0|5|These pants are great- they are not too tight and they are good for tall people. Great product great pants  I had to order another size 6- they showed excessive wear in less than 1 month. Strange for expensive leggings.......
B00573RDN2|5|...this is an awesome T-shirt!
B000BXGXSE|5|These fit great at a great price.I'm really happy with these jeans. First, according to the tags these jeans are 99% cotton, so I imagine only some washes are made with polyester
B00NQKU8I0|5|Shipping was fast and the product was great
B00K6ZN128|5|I bought these because I was looking for long sleeved pajamas for my LO, but hated the ones with feet in them. These are the quality you expect from Carter's-- soft cotton, great fit, accurate sizing. The snaps are a little tough to unsnap, but it isn't really a big problem, I imagine they may get easier to unsnap with use. We've had a cool summer here, and these make wonderful pajamas without getting baby too warm, and the snap-up legs make diaper changes easy. Just wish I could find more in different fabric patterns!
B00L5GAIPK|5|It's the perfect fit!
B00OM54II4|4|This top is cute but not for my figure.  I have a large chest and am chubby so it just makes you look even bigger.  I felt like I had on a puffy shirt. :)<br />I give it 4 stars because it's a nice shear for Spring for someone else's figure.
B00F4N2OL6|4|these are great, fit and quality are very good.
B00TDK01J8|5|Great bibs. Durable and soft. Definitely nice to have for a teething baby. Stay on nicely with the snap closure.
B003CMYTAA|4|These socks are great. They fit well, are very warm, and have extra padding. Be sure there is enough room in your boots otherwise you will have a hard time getting them into your shoes. My only complaint is that they got very fuzzy only after a few washes. Hopefully, they will not fall apart after washing them too many times.
B005SW2L5M|4|Based on the size chart I should have ordered a size 14 but I read the reviews and ordered one size down (12) and it fits perfectly. I'm 5'6&#34; and 165 pounds.
B006LRY69W|5|Awesome. They stay up very well.
B00SW74UTU|1|they are supper thin, and nothing like the originals. Because they are thin, they feel like they are cutting your cheeks.
B008P2UKG4|5|very very lovey baby dress
B00404YCWO|5|PERFECT
B00IK4NOM4|5|Like them a lot.
B00LI2S7FY|1|These didn't work out for me.  The material is thin - way thinner than what it looks like on the website, and it's scratchy.  With no elastic at all on the top, there is no way these pants would stay up on me, and the last thing I want to be doing is hiking up my pants all day long.  If you're a smaller size, these may fit better, but for a plus-sized woman, the fit was all wrong.
B00DWGYUVY|5|I ordered this for my son for Christmas and he absolutely loved it. The item was just as described and in mint condition. Thank you!!!
B00M8RGDUE|2|Not for girls with booty, I read it fit small, so I ordered two sizes bigger, and the bottoms were still too small, but the top was too big. And it's definitely not true to color.
B00TPZODFO|2|I'm 5'10 and by third trimester, (@170 lbs) this dress shortened up too much due to bump growth.  I only got to wear it once.  Also the fabric isn't very forgiving and easily shows panty lines.
B0083QNR8U|5|This was perfect with my prom dress.  It fit comfortably and supported me better than I expected. I would recommend this to anyone with a need for this type of bra.
B00I15WEMS|5|Very happy with everything.  Condition of books and shirt, packagine etc.  Have not read &#34;The Woman in White&#34; yet but am looking forward to it.  I read &#34;The Moonstone&#34; and found Wilkie Collins is indeed an outstanding writer.
B00MVBTBTW|5|This is a great, beautiful top
B00HT78MTI|5|From Eau Claire Wi so I put in sons of Wisconsin and this came up. Told my people and they loved it. 5 star all the way.
B00N39V702|4|Got this as a quick solution for part of a Ren Faire costume. It was light weight and comfortable and very easy to add pieces (corset and overskirt, accessories) to fit our theme
B0034KWCYU|5|thanks so much
B000QWDQUS|5|All I can say is I am sooo extra sexy with this on. I plan on buying a medium to give my self a little more of a &#34;squeeze&#34;.  I am sure the manufacturer wouldnt recommend it, but I am still trying.
B00GRJ8GG8|3|I was a little surprised when I saw my order because the finger tips are not light gray as pictured but are actually charcoal gray and nearly blend in with the rest of the black glove. The construction looks good though not as perfect as the photo - there are a few loose threads.
B009Z2ZV2G|4|Good
B008Q7OGYU|5|Very Nice
B004VBPRKW|4|They're very comfortable, just to get used to the seat area.
B005SOW7JA|4|I normally don't like Jessica Simpson designs & I don't like turtle necks, but this is a really pretty knit dress and the turtle neck isn't tight and annoying; it's kinda a mini turtle neck.  I bought the dress at the beginning of the year and forgot about it until Thanksgiving when I finally wore it.  I got so many compliments on it and it was warm and snug.  Really cute dress.
B009L5AY3S|5|this was so cute. I gave it to my niece and she wore it for Halloween.  It was the way they announced they were pregnant.
B0047R4ISC|5|Excellent - as described Excellent as described excellent as described excellent as described excellence as described excellent as described Excellen
B00JJ8MYCG|5|Adorable and well made
B00CBAOGBQ|5|returned once they run small<br />but war and a good product
B00KZ1R6WY|5|Lovely skirt and very flattering
B00G3US2N8|3|It was smaller than the medium it was badged with, bought the same logo different t-shirt brand at another retailer as a medium. Perfect! This was more like a small.
B0069I9G20|5|As a chemo patient, I love my Abbey Ruffle caps when I don't feel like wearing a wig. They are light weight so great for the warm summer months.  Although I have several colors, most of the time I wear either the black or white one.
B00GNK1992|4|I ordered the coat one size larger than my shirt size so that it would fit over my clothes more comfortably.  It fit as I hoped.  Love the longer length.  The lining is like a brushed fleece, not a smooth lining, which can affect how easily it slips over clothing.  It is a good in between  season coat.
B00BKSNUQ2|5|Cool shirt
B00EVS6JG6|2|This is a VEST hoodie. Does not explain that at all and the picture is very deceiving. Looks like one solid piece!
B007J0PWE8|5|I had a pair of these for years and one days I popped one because I was leaning over a sharp corner and pressing hard with my body weight (mind you I had them for years by this point) I stood up and noticed my sweater was all wet - one had popped! Now I started trying to replace them immediately and every one I found I didn't like - I found a set of jelly ones (don't know if gel filled or what but very squishy jelly type - thought they would be perfect but because they didn't have the fabric layer they made my breasts sweat constantly and then smell like BO - so I had to keep searching - then I found these that are EXACTLY like my previous cherished ones I had for several yrs before one popped. I still give it 5 stars because I know it was really my fault and these are invaluable to me for balancing out my figure (I'm a pear shape - so like an hour glass but significantly more narrow on top - with these pads I look much slimmer because of the balance)FYI if you have never heard of pear shape - google it - people are either apples (round all over) celery (thin all over) pear (like me) there was one more I can't remember the name of but it was the shape of an upside down triangle (heavy on top and light at hips - like a reversal of my pear) once you figure out which you are then you can dress appropriately for your figure!!
B00MLVT0UW|5|pants were a little long, but she will grow into them.  My niece loved the pj's
B008U1CMNO|4|Jus a lil small
B00BJORF9U|5|GREAT
B000MNHMJM|4|Just a nice hat
B002J9T6RI|1|I bought this for my son for the 4th of July. He opened it the day before and by the next day it was dead. He got maybe 5-10 minutes of use out of it.
B0033PRG9M|5|Love the hat.  Very flexible - there is a small wire around around the rim when I received hat the end was sticking out all I had to do was bend and twist a little and all was good.  I look forward to using it at the pool.
B004KSUI96|5|Great product! Fast shipment!
B00DD169LW|2|The women's socks are made overseas and all the men's socks are made in the USA  Wonder why they would have two plants? tried to reach them to ask but they did not respond.  The men's socks are made better of course and keep us employed.  The men's have a huge made in USA sicker on the package you can check this by going to your local Walmart.
B000HTIZM4|5|Boyfried likes them and they sit very nice on him. I would get a pair for myself if I could!
B005341QDS|5|as described it is a beautiful color and very soft.  It's a nice size for multiple uses. I look forward to giving it to my friend.
B0077HZ4XW|5|Arrived faster than expected and fit great! Love them!
B004W5OKA0|4|My teenage son loves this hoodie for its durability. Doesn't like that the lining of the pockets in the inside aren't completing sewn down. It looks terrific on him and has kept him warm since he doesn't like to wear coats-an all around good buy. Will buy again.
B003IC965M|4|This is a good costume quality hair piece.  I used it for my tooth fairy costume.  Some people could not tell it wasn't my real hair.  I have dark brown hair.  You need to store it in the bag provided.
B00IVGB1YE|5|Looks  and feels great,  the color is beautiful, and the fit is perfect! It does require a tank top or camisole underneath, but I get so many compliments on this dress, and I feel comfortable and sexy when I wear it.
B00GHQZQTQ|5|Cool socks!
B00L58FWQ8|5|Nice shirt, good purchase...!
B00NVAKH1I|4|Xl was still to small and she wears a leg. But looks awesome
B004MNPB5K|4|I don't have much to say about this product - but here it is.<br /><br />1. the shipping wasn't that good-darts/needles were packaged in a too big box, and they ripped part of the enclosed bag off. Rough Shipping? (minus a half star.)<br /><br />2. The actual darts were nice, multi-colored rubber. The metal part was an elongated, thin, spear-shaped metal needle. Exactly described as in the seller preview and pictures.<br /><br />3. It was a bit expensive for my taste, 7 bucks for a tiny package of darts. (minus a half star.)<br /><br />Overall product is fine, perfect for blowguns.
B00K1B1XIG|4|Love the shirt. Just runs a little small
B00SZAONW8|5|Adorable pants! Fit amazing
B00AQTUECO|4|It looks just like the picture. There are plenty of pockets. My only critique was that it took so long to get it.
B006M5DJTQ|5|The quality of the knitting and the embroidery are very high. It fits well on my head and that of my 8 year old. We are pleased.
B0093KVDXG|5|I loved this corset! I have bought many corsets and this one is very comfortable and true to its size.
B000W5OTX2|3|This is a very cute costume but it really isn't made all that well. Not that I was expecting a high fashion design. But I was expecting something that wasn't so close to getting holes in it. It's a baby's costume, it should withstand a baby wearing it for a few hours. Oh well. The costume was snug on my baby but I figured that would be the case as he is a little larger for his age (7 months, ordered the 12 month size). The blanket doesn't really serve a function as it really isn't a blanket. It's more like a polyester place mat.
B000IOH08I|4|Well made. Very thick and tough. I wear a large/tall and the fit is as expected.
B00069IP3E|3|I have several FOTL Heavy weight Tees that are probably about 5 years old and after MANY washings they are still made from thicker fabric than these.<br /><br />For comparison, I weighed one of my old ones and it weighed 7-1/4 ounces.... the new ones unwashed weighed 6 ounces each.  I'll keep looking for a brand that puts more cotton into their tees.<br /><br />Even at this new weight they're better than Hanes' Soft and Supple tees which if they were much thinner they would have to be a hologram.
B00KBZONIE|5|Got a stain on my first one. Ordered two more. XL fit as expected.
B009NBQ466|5|Nice loved for me i wear every day
B00786Y6RC|5|great
B002D4GJQA|5|I like this jacket. I purchased it after the zipper malfunctioned on the one I'd purchased from Walmart.com after a mere 3 months of use (and even with my receipt Walmart said the computer wouldn't allow them to process a return). Never again! Anyhew, this jacket works fine for my thin, warm blooded 6.5 year old on days as cold as approximately 35-40°. Being any colder than that would probably require another layer underneath this jacket,  because it's not a heavy jacket. Also, I love the white nametag label;  the Wal-Mart jacket lacked any light spot to label their jacket.
B00RUQ4K3U|1|they came in a different color (blue/black)
B000NZVQJQ|5|Been looking for petite black jeans for quite a while.  And now I have them.  Gloria Vanderbilt was always my favorite: they do not seem to be available in this cold north!  Love them!
B0026F3D2Y|5|This item is exactly what it claims to be...and it's pretty fantastic.  Vintage all the way.  And glamorous too.  It really was pretty perfect in every way.  It does not breath at all on your head, but that's the whole purpose of a bathing cap.
B005FM6BM4|3|So I'm an adult, and at 5'6 and 207 pounds it's hard to find jeans that fit my hourglass shape the way I like. I've had three children so my hips have spread a bit and my belly has pouched making it even more difficult for me. I followed another reviewers advice and bought a size above my normal (I think) size because they are juniors. BIG MISTAKE! I bought them in a size 20 and holy cow are they HUGE for me! My hips are 48 1/2 inches and my waist is the same. These jeans fit my waist an inch too big and were like parachute pants on my hips and legs! I grabbed about three inches of excess jean on my back hip area that was just hanging off. I am going to get these altered because the quality of jean is great and I don't want to just throw them in the bottom of my closet. I love the color, the pockets and length but the hips are just too big! I ordered these jeans in another color and a size 18 so hopefully they fit better but we will see tomorrow when they come in. My advice to you is buy according to your normal size and don't be afraid to have someone alter these to the way you like.
B00ANLA30I|5|Love the color and outfit itself. Can't wait for Daphne to wear it.  I would recommend this to friends and family
B00I4HPNXK|1|It's more like pjs than a real top.
B00CY28PKY|5|its beatifull
B005GYGEWS|5|They fit good and haven't faded with washing them several times now. I like that you can slip a long sweater over them and run to the store. Very nice and comfy!
B0057I6HRA|3|The order was shipped promptly (dependable Amazon) but the pants were polyester material which I do not like.  Color was OK.  I will wear them while working outside in the garden.
B004R1JVYO|2|The shirt is of reasonable quality but the fit is somewhat on the large side by almost two sizes.<br /><br />Also there is an additional detail (3 white stripes - i.e. Adidas) not shown in the product illustration that run vertically down the center of the back for about six inches below the collar, I would have not ordered this shirt if I had seen this detailing,
B005A5WQMU|5|This is one of the top brands .. Really nice shirt and grat quality .. Never order it if you don't expect the best ..
B00DORY0TI|5|Again I love this manufacturer, the clothing are made well will wear great and are colorful and fun designs. I will continue to purchase this particular brand. Love it!
B0081EMCH6|5|I immediately took out the hood myself, but I got 3 compliments on it the first day that I wore it. It fits great. I'm 6' tall and 180lbs and it fits me great at a &#34;large&#34; size. It has 8 pockets so you should be able to skip the UHAUL the next time you move.
B005E1KR2Q|5|Nice leather and a great ant-pick pocket deterrent. I took it to Europe for a month and didn't have any issues with it getting stolen like another member of our party,  who got his wallet lifted on the 2nd day of the tour.  The chain isn't cumbersome or heavy and if you keep storage in the wallet to a minimum [2 or 3 credit cards/ ID and a few bills]  it wears well with your pants.<br /><br />As a fashion statement - i'm still not completely liking having it chained to me, but its better then having my cards and id stolen!!
B00DOXCD1O|2|Well my son tried to suprise me for Christmas and didn't hit the correct size. How can I exchange them! I love them but I need a 34
B000FE987C|5|for the longest time I would would wear under armour shirts as undershirts. Not because I was trying to suck it in, but because I liked that it was thin yet fitting and wouldn't bunch up under shirts.  Well luckily I was introduced to these since then! These have everything I like about under armour. It is tighter, it doesn't bunch up, it keeps me cool or warm depending on weather, and it is long enough to tuck in.  It really is GREAT as an under shirt and fits extremely well!!
B009IUGQVA|3|These looked sooo cute in the picture, but in reality they are not great, they are not very ling and when you put them on, they kind of bunch up close to your hand anyway and don't really go up your arm as the picture shows.  Also, they twist a lot and don't lie very flat, just bunchy and bulky.  Have to constantly twist them and turn them to adjust them with my arm and the hole for my thumb.  Not comfy like I had hoped.
B001FOR6TI|2|At least it was the correct length.  The belt has thin leather surrounding a cardboard center.  The portion that wraps through the buckle to secure it is glued together, not stitched through.  The glue was separated on the belt I was sent and the cardboard center prevents useful re-gluing.
B0008EOG0S|5|As anticipated, very love
B00JGSVF3S|4|Feels comfy, kinda form fitting. When I first wore them my friends asked if they were like male yoga pants. But I got to say my ass looks damn fine in them.
B00QILJ9G6|4|Shirt looks great, the only problem is it is somewhat of a snug fit which is fine with me but if you're looking for more of a loose fit it may not be for you.
B00FX1GNU2|5|Love the fleece lining. So soft and warm. Scarf just as pictured
B005UJTSBS|2|All edges become dirty and black just from wearing the waatch. You can wash it a bit but the white colour is fading and grey and black colour from cloths or whatever are staying. No point having white watch thats loosing color...
B00RB2ATNI|5|As this is now my third piece of henshin gear from Drive (which is probably all of them besides the exclusive Lupin Gunner) I can tell you flat out, this is the best of the three. This belt has something that very few secondary riders have or don't have at all: more compatability with the main toy line. Though it suffers the same problem that the Drive Driver and the Fourze Driver before it had(that being a generic finishing sound) it can read all signal bikes, shift cars and viral cores ( with the exception of the Lupin viral core since the blade part probably isn't detachable) and also produces new names for each shift car and viral core. Also, it retains the same Koukan or core exchange sounds that the Drive Driver and the Break Gunner have while adding in a little bit of Mach to each. The LED for the flame at the corner of the driver also lights up to correspond with each bike/car/core (examples: Type Technic turns the flame part green and Massive Monster turns the flame purple). Also, the button on the top functions like the shift up ability of the Drive Driver but can be done to add a bit more power to the attack or rider. The chrome on the plate that shows a signal bikes symbol is very nice and the grey piece that sits above the receiver for the gimmick is a plyable plastic so no worries of it snapping off. The belt takes 3 AAA batteries to operate and includes the buckle, belt straps, clip to cover belt connection and the Signal Mach bike. Overall, this set is a great addition to your collection and having either the Drive Driver or Break Gunner or any of the shift car set or viral cores adds a tremendous amount of playability to this toy and the toy line in general.
B004M6UDF0|4|This money clip is great, I carry it everyday. After over a year of use it is beginning to stretch out and sometimes my credit and debit cards slide right out, but the ID window is great and has not discolored at all. Not to mention the leather money clip is comfortable, you dot ever have any metal digging into your leg, and it has a nice low profile.  It would be 5 stars if the magnet on the money clip was stronger. Its a great product for the price point and I will buy another happily.
B00E1V5284|2|Returned
B00B1A9SX8|5|OK, you do need to wash it a few times before it gets that relaxed denim feel you want. So did Levis and other denim shirts back in the day. Having grown up inthe &#34;rag trade&#34; I know a little about thread, fabric,fastenings (buttons and such) and design. I highly recommend this product.
B00HWIC2EK|1|Pads were not removable and were the type that once they got crunched in the plastic bag they were mailed in, the crunches were permanent and showed through the fabric.  I had to cut them out and found that people were right when they said the shelf bra wasn't long enough.  The seam hits just under mid breast.  I'd say another work in the yard top, but the shelf hitting just under mid breast is so annoying that I'm going to toss it.  The fabric is very soft and stretchy.
B00761791O|5|I'm very happy with this purchase, the belt is a nice width. The decoration is lighter than it looks but really pretty. The elastic is soft yet holds really well. If I lost this belt I would purchase another one.
B00HWHHGGA|5|My 2 year old granddaughter loves this purse.
B000O1FD6Q|4|They work fine, I'm just not sure how long they will last being plastic. I've used them a week, so will repost my finding after a few months. My cloth ones have lasted many years and only replaced due to loss.
B0082D2PM8|5|A Christmas gift to my granddaughter. It fits!
B00362TRGW|4|Great shape and fit.  Just what was required for a wonderful celebration and bring back fun memories back to the now :-)
B00O0TT5MG|4|All the reviews said this jacket ran small and to order up, so I ordered a medium instead of small. I'm satisfied except it is a little big. I'm sure a size small would have been fine.
B00AARJ5P4|5|Worked in a nursing home and got a lot of compliments on this. 5'3, 95lb, xxs fits well, does not look boxy, good length.
B00D8GZD7S|2|I ordered the skirt and liked what I received, but the size is larger than what I usually wear.  So I ordered another one, but the next size down, and it fit correctly.  But when I tried to return the one that is too large, the Seller gave me such a hassle, that I just took my losses.  I am a regular on Amazon, but I will no longer order from Xclusive Collection.  Because of this experience, I will no longer order from any overseas Sellers in the future.
B00ED7KZ6K|5|Fits as expected. I really like the fit and it's very cute. Con: The wide elastic in the waist can fold over.
B00CI1HXLI|5|Great for wedding gown!
B00IX08UGA|5|Good quality and feels comfortable. Also received compliments on it.
B00F2ZX4ZQ|3|It took over a month to receive and once I opened the package I realized they sent the wrong color. Since it had already taken forever to receive I did not want to waste the time to try to return for the correct color.... so I decided to be crafty and bought some fabric dye and voila! Otherwise great hat
B00A86QF3M|3|I am 5'4, 125 pounds and typically wear a size 4-6.  After reading reviews, I ordered a large and it is still tighter than I would like.  The material is also very thin and in the color that I selected (yellow) it's almost see-through.  The color is true to what it looks like in the picture. I might be sending this one back.
B00CX0L55E|5|I had a treasured Levi's jean jacket when I was growing up. My husband had a treasured Levi's jean jacket when he was growing up. In fact, pretty much everyone had one, and everyone looked good in theirs.<br /><br />My son is just about 9, and he looks great in classic preppy/casual/collegiate styles. I figured it was time for him to get a treasured Levi's jean jacket of his own. Moms, let me tell you, when he put this thing on I couldn't believe how handsome he looked in it. The fade is perfect and real-looking -- it looked like a well-loved hand-me-down from an indulgent older brother.<br /><br />If you like the classics, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this gorgeous, versatile, layerable, and indestructible beauty that only improves with hard wear.
B000BB07HY|5|I bought this particular cover because it wasn't expensive and it keeps my hands warm in the winter. love it
B00SG7M5ZM|5|I'll give these a 5 star rating despite one minor detail:  I thought the color was a teensy, little bit off from the photos.  Overall, I think the photos depict the colors a tad lighter than they actually are.  For example, the &#34;blue&#34; socks in the middle top row are actually more of a &#34;royal blue&#34;, with a very slight purplish hue.  Likewise, the slightly socks in the slower right are black, not the slight charcoal I thought they were.<br /><br />Other than that these are a great deal.  The socks seem thicker than most &#34;cheap&#34; socks and the quality seems great.  I'll really know after a year and a few washes.  I have smaller feet, and wear a shoe size 8-9 so these were a tad too big, but nothing major.  Overall I'm pleased and wouldd buy again.
B000J392U2|5|ok
B00NC76CJQ|5|Cute, but too small.
B008R6TP5U|3|Pretty normal product.Was sliced thru probably by the warehouse workers.Would be cheaper at the store and if any detects, it would be easier to just go to the store.
B00TYVWJ3M|5|I'm not considered plus size since my regular size is a 10-12 but I'm currently 7 months pregnant and have sized up rather than buying maternity clothing.  I prefer not having a big elastic band that covers half my stomach show through my tops, so sizing up and making sure I have comfortable room for my growing little one is what I look for in clothing right now.  I recieved this pair of women's plus size brown jeans in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  The jeans feel great on, they're not the typical thickness of regular jeans. I would say they're more of a feeling of jeggings, they're extremely comfortable to wear and give me room in the waist as well. They're not incredibly tight which I like.  They're a nice deep chocolate brown color with goldish bronze accents on them. The zipper is a bit stiff, which is the only con I've experienced with the jeans. They have the same 5 pockets just as regular jeans do.  The jeans also have a nice slight stretch to them.  This is a HUGE plus for me since I'm pregnant and have a couple more months of growing and knowing that they stretch is amazing! They are the perfect pair of pants for me!  I love the feel and comfort of the jeans and I am even considering purchasing more colors. These jeans can be paired with a nice top and heels for a night on the town with or for a  more casual look with nice flats.  This is a staple item that can be worn to create multiple looks and I love they they come in so many colors.  I wore these to a gathering last week and my mom couldn't believe I wasn't wearing maternity jeans with how stylish I looked at 7 months pregnant.  It's always great to get compliments when you're pregnant!  Overall, these jeans are great! They look great on me, have the same pockets as jeans that I love in comparison to jeggings that only have back pockets, and they have s nice color and feel to them! Couldn't be happier!
B005442A0K|5|I purchased the Decky Cuff Jeep Beanie Visor Cap as well as this one. Carhartt is better in quality, but I love them both. Best winter cap for shoveling.
B003RYCGWQ|5|Bought two of these - one for a dear friend and one for hubby.  They both cracked up!  They've been taking them to parties and playing on words with them!  Friends see them and want one, too!  Lots of fun!
B00HDTMIZ6|4|Get compliments when I wear it.  Very bright and sunny.  I wear purple mostly so it goes with all my clothes.
B000G0SJOI|5|Have always had good luck with Lee pants and was so happy to find this pair that fits at my waist, not on my hips. Thanks, Lee!!
B002BTOP1I|5|It looks like leather in picture, but happily I read the description and it is not leather.  Very different looking.  Not everyone liked it on me.... But I loke it.
B002K6F7AK|5|Love this bra. Perfect for nursing and is super comfortable.
B00AWMO5UM|5|Very cute top, fits a bit free but same as on the picture, gives me very tender look, love it
B0014CNZK0|5|I love this and for the price it is great. The only unfortunate thing is that the sizes do run small. Other than that i absolutely love it. The material is soft, it came with a padded hanger for it. I definitely recommend it
B00GYEQXFM|5|I really like this scrub top.  It has a flattering fit and is a nice dark blue navy (which my workplace requires).<br />It washes well and the best thing about Grey's scrubs --- THEY NEVER NEED IRONING!!  I like Dickies<br />Youtility pants because they have more pockets, but the material they use does not come out of the<br />dryer well and I have to iron the tops and pants - not so with Grey's Anatomy.  They always look great.
B00859OQM6|5|Beautiful scarf and jewelry.  I only wish that the scarf were not packaged in a way that the scarf is rolled and in need of hanging the wrinkles out before wearing, but I am not disappointed at all.  It is very pretty and I know I will look good in it when I can wear it!!
B001B4P6K8|2|This was purchased as a wig for a Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction costome.  The photo indicates this wig was a longer bob and when I ran a seach using &#34;Mia Wallace&#34; for a wig, this was the result.  It appears to be chin length - it is not. It barely covered the back of my head and the &#34;hair&#34; of the wig was short and appeared to be curled.  The length of the hair was closer to the bottom of my ears.  I wanted to look like Mia Wallace from Pulp Fiction, I ended up looking like Miss Swan from Mad TV.  No bueno
B00KSO4S5G|5|This sweater jacket is not only beautifully made the color is fantastic.  Quality gets 100% from me!
B00LYTB2LC|5|super under layer, soft and well crafted
B006VYPLP8|1|The dress looks great in the picture, but it is very cheap and looks ugly. It is NOT worth $80. Buy Thanth women clothes if you are a crossdresser instead. This dress should be priced at about $20.
B008KKQF9W|4|Not as warm but nice looking.
B00AF0SXCW|5|Service was great item was as described would buy again
B002RL8JCQ|5|I bought 2 packages of these for my husband's stocking for this past Christmas and he LOVES THEM!  Fit well, better material and he looks GREAT in them!!  :)
B00KB2W92O|5|My daughter loves this shirt. It fits and looks great. Thanks!
B006WIYM3U|5|I love the control of Assets! Makes my already shapely figure even better. The quality allows for you to wash and wear these at least 3-4x before runnng, which is good because I want to feel like I'm getting my money's worth. These are pretty expensive pantyhose!
B00S9M9FBQ|3|This bathing suit is definitely good quality for the price, but the straps and number of ties on it get very annoying very quickly. There's a lot to adjust, and the ruffle in front is actually quite large. I am 5'7&#34; and 125 lbs and I got a medium. It was too small in the bum region for me to feel comfortable, while the cups up top were on the larger side (for reference I am a C-cup and I did not fill them out). This suit might be better for bustier girls with smaller hips/bum and more patience than I, but for me this suit is being returned.
B00TKOYREW|5|I odered a size larger after reading reviews.  Wish I would have stuck with true size. The size up isn't too big, just a little roomy and long. Overall fit as I would expect.
B00N3EMM9W|5|Perfect gift for my son. He really likes them.
B0042GSAEQ|5|I love fun socks and these fit the bill. I work with kids and these are a hit with the little guys, as well as making me smile myself.
B00IB6ONXK|5|Eileen West is high quality.
B00L2J2SOO|5|No headaches, yeah!
B000AO7PXQ|3|Do not be fooled by the &#34;One Size Fits Most.&#34; It doesn't. I'm a very petite 5'2&#34; with a 29-30&#34; inseam. My size varies between a 0 and a 4 depending on who designes an outfit. I got these on okay, but I cannot imagine how anyone with longer legs or a larger girth would ever be able to get these up all the way without turning them into thigh-highs!
B00AFUE448|5|These are awesome. Fit well, highlight curves. I don't think you can ever go wrong with Levi's. Now, let's hope I don't spill anything on them.
B00CODM5K4|5|best bifold wallet for the guy that has too many credit cards!!!!!
B00C9T1L1W|5|This is the third Carhartt J130 coat purchased in our family, and it is just as well made and heavy duty as it's predecessors.  Simply put, this is the best mid to heavy weight winter jacket with a hood on the market.
B00C20EBU6|5|ok
B00EMFS3EO|5|Love the t-shirt! Frankenstein image looks awesome.
B004ZWESQ6|5|This jacket is super cute and the price is excellent. I bought the small (I'm 113 lb, 5\\"3') and it fits very well. RECOMMENDED.
B005PU6YW8|3|I thought the material would be nicer, I bought it to take with me on my trip, not sure if I am going to use it or not, if not I will return it.
B0029015QC|4|I know eventually the care tag will unravel and fall off since the edges were not finished but for a baby who will grown out of these in a few weeks these are just perfect. they are just as pictured and very adorable. very worth the money.
B00PVF8AMO|5|usa size 9 fits very well?! VERY COMFY and very good quality.
B00D9RDGWA|5|This tie is a one of a kind.  I dressed it with a dark blue suit with a fuchsia shirt dress shirt.  People kept telling me to keep the jacket off.  It ties everything together with a fresh clean look.  James M.
B00ZWL7PIM|5|[[VIDEOID:543a40423c2f09b7f7f2e834c09d3a6e]] I am one of those that like for my clothes to be very versatile.  I want something that can be casual or dressy, depending on my mood or needs.  This Lyon Women's Black & White Flower Casual Skirt fits the bill perfectly!!! It is very well made, stitching is very nice, and it has scalloped lace edges.  The material itself feels so soft and flows when you turn.  And the best part is it comes with a beautiful Swarovski Crystal piece of Jewelry!!!

B00NV92LYU|5|Wore the pants for a tropical weather wedding. Looked great with a guayabera and was fresh enough for the heat.
B007VEEM34|2|These run really small. I got a little bit of a runaround with the seller to return them. In short, you cannot return them if you have tried them on. Luckily I had bought 2 and they fit my youngest but not my older daughter (they're only 11 months apart) so  I was able to return the unopened second pair.
B000FE9890|5|Badass shirts... I wear them as shirts.. Not undershirts. I buy everywhere just to get more colors. Buy a size bigger than you wear.. My advice.
B00NVOCYMO|4|I am pleased with the material, quality and the price of the costume. The only issue I had was the length of the dress, it is definitely shorter than the picture implies. I bought this for my 10-year old daughter, who is 5'1&#34; (too tall for the average kids costume) and I was looking for something appropriate for her age. I just added a pair of legging under the dress and all is well. The length is the only reason I can not give it 5 stars.
B00EKQXEIU|5|My son loved it!
B007WTURG4|3|The band around the top is a little uncomfortable
B000GE5OZ6|4|don't let the title dissuade you- this is a great t-shirt if you want this type of fit!  the darker colors are best so that the sheerness doesn't cause problems.  I am an adult woman, not a teen, and appreciate the longer length of this T which seems hard to find these days.
B001JBNDLM|4|works fine
B00C68ZVYY|5|Good value and truer to size than many others I've tried. Gotta have the 100% cotton, and they can be hard to find in stores in the right size at the right price. Very pleased with these for all three kids.
B00006446P|5|This bra is great.  I wish that it was still available in the stores.  Definately needs to be continued to be offered both online and in stores.  Would definitely buy again.
B00GD2DSAS|5|I love love love this!!!! I wore it with a little black dress but I could wear this with jeans or a skirt it's just so versatile. I always get so many compliments when I wear this. The material is a little rough at first because it's not a material I wear on a regular basis but it's not itchy; just different. I don't wear it when I'm with my kids as some materials seem more delicate then others.
B006MRNOHG|5|Coat is actually pretty nice for a costume. I got tons of compliments on this and will save to wear again years from now.
B00GCV4VDI|5|this jacket so amazing fits perfect an the colors amazing im 5foot 5in 140 pounds an it fit perfectly so happy with this jacket
B00AK7Q73M|4|I'm a breast cancer survivor, Praise God. But the reconstruction has caused an issue with finding a bra that fits comfortably and properly.  The reconstructed breast is flatter on top than the natural breast, so the one cup never fits right. This bra fits well, doesn't show a wrinkle, because it forms to the breasts. My only negative, which I did somewhat expect, is it rolls up some. I'm overweight, so it's not  all the bra's fault. I love the cushion cover over the clasps! No digging or annoyance in my back. Overall, I'm glad I've ordered more of these. Best fit I've been able to find.
B004L6WUGQ|1|Do not waste your money, upon delivery every feather had come detached. Total waste of money
B00J6ASS5O|5|Love it! Adorable!
B00LAVZ9P4|5|Love them - if you own other Diesel jeans, just order the same size and you will be happy.  I love the color on these too - the picture is accurate.
B00J2MHL6I|5|This costume was great!  High quality.  Came in a nice garment bag and was very impressive!
B00LCVQDUW|5|Fit as described in description!  Would absolutely recommend.
B00CSKDNPE|5|good
B00PW390LU|5|Very cool trunks and feels great compared to other trunks out there.  Comes with a cool bottle opener :)
B00JE8ZAUY|5|It looks so cute on my nine month old grandson today. It is just the perfect outfit for a cutie!
B004VMQPFW|3|Too tight around the waist.
B00C2XMP6A|1|buyers beware the belt has a very strong smell of leather. I left it in a small box of baking soda for a day and still smelled horrible. I ended up throwing it away. I could of bought some leather deortizer that I would only use once, but I instead just bought a name brand belt. I recommened to everyone what I did and just get a name brand belt its worth the extra few bucks of not smelling like cheap leather when you walk into a room.
B008G51XA2|4|I bought this dress for my niece. She love it. Four stars just because it fit her a little large.
B00HYMP1SI|5|Cool as hell. I love this shirt. Fits well, graphic is great.
B000JRM4SA|5|This is a wonderful product.  These shields really keep your clothes free of perspiration odor and stains.  I really like them.
B00IG2TO92|3|I like the feel and look of this jacket, however it does fit snugly.
B00CZ7VO2O|2|I'm looking to switch from an underwire bra since, as I have gotten heavier, the underwires tend to cut into my ribcage. Also I have heard that underwires are actually bad fro your health. Anyway, I bought this bra thinking it looked like a supportive and well-made item. Since sizing seems to be an issue with bras and I wear a C cup in some and a D cup in others I ordered a C cup because I'd rather have it a little small than too large. It arrived today and the straps are very short (which I can live with) but the cup size is too big and puckers. Would really like this bra to work out but there is no way a B cup is gonna fit me...haven't worn a B since I was 12 years old! Too bad because other than the cup size the bra looks nice and well-made. So I guess it's on to the next brand.
B007TMY2L0|4|Love the book bag, very durable. Only complaint is that the little diamond  shaped element logo's stitching is beginning to come out so i sewed it back on.
B002OB429I|5|Tend to buy a wallet every 18 months or so.  I think this has been my favorite so far.  Will post more if it fails in any  way in the future.
B00QFRG6QY|5|I love this shirt 👌👌👌
B00C3DS73E|5|Beautiful color. I plan on pairing it with my leopard heels and flats.
