B000056BAF|5.0|Very interesting! There is songs for rappers,rockers, or even both and if you get in to the music there is the G-sides (yes it is the b-side of the gorillaz) and Laika Come Home the dub version of the songs. If you have enough money to buy it? Buy it!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a must have for any diehard Shania fan, as well as anyone who likes a great performance by a lovely and talented singer! Shania is fantastic in this live performance, showing a great stage presence. Her beautiful voice keeps belting out all the great tunes we've come to love from this dynamic lady. Up(Live in Chicago) puts you at the concert with a better than front row seat, 'cause you get all the music and action from the comfort of your easy chair. Two thumbs 'UP'!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's newest album IN THE ZONE is such an incredible album!!! Every single song (except Everytime) has a great fast beat everyone can jam to!!!!! This cd was worth the wait and worth the money!!! If you were thinking of buying it then DON'T change your mind! You won't be sorry!! The best songs in my opinion are: Me Against The Music, Toxic, Brave New Girl, Breathe On Me, Everytime, etc.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I must say that i am really pleased with the outcome of Britneys fourth CD.  It mixes every style of music.  Every artist claims it but britney speaks the truth when she says that there are no two songs that sound similar.  I am so happy for her.  I strongly recomend that wether you are a fan or not that You but this CD as soon as possible
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain does it again, comes out of nowhere and blows you away from the Windy City itself...Chicago! Shania puts on a thrilling &amp; entertaining performance that's full of intense energy. What's great about it, is the crowd is so involved with the show, everyone is singing the words to her songs like only true fans could. If you don't have this DVD yet, you have to get it, and treat yourself to her New Album too!
B000066NW0|4.0|My first impressions of this cd... avril is cool!!! but her music isnt as good as she is.<BR>12 months later... avril may need a new stylist, but this album is great.<BR>With a mix between Michelle Branch and Pink, her music style shines through with amazing songs - with a range from being shallow to having deep deep meanings. <br />Before I bought this cd, I was impressed with Avril Lavigne because she (apparently) wrote all her own songs... but for people who get impressed by this as I do, don't be fooled, Avril did write this cd... with about 10 other people. Since when does co-writing get you a place as a singer/songwriter??<br />O well, I don't mean to give her a hard time because this album rocks if you like Stacie Orrico's style of music, or Michelle Branch. If you like Red Hot Chili Peppers, this may not be what you are looking for. Four stars out of Five!!!!!
B000000WHX|4.0|It was 1991. While being 12 years of age back then it was just the age to critically follow music. It was the year &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; was released in Holland, and became a massive hit, being at the number 1 spot for several weeks. The voice of Shara Nelson and the beats made this track unforgettable. And I still didn't forgot it. <br />Now, 12 years later, I'm in the position to explore music better than ever. I thought let's listen to &quot;Blue Lines&quot; with that hitsong on it. I must say that I was thrilled by the music. The strong &quot;Safe from Harm&quot; is a track worthy of a begin of an album. The second track, &quot;One Love&quot; was a little disappointing in my ears, but it was fully compensated by the rest of the tracks, with &quot;Be Thankful for What You've Got&quot;, &quot;Five Man Army&quot;, of course &quot;Unfinished Sympathy&quot; and the brilliant ending &quot;Hymn of the Big Wheel&quot;. This album is worth while listening to!
B00006CXXU|2.0|I know most people will disagree with me, but what happened to cute &quot;genie in a bottle&quot; christina? <br />This image of her does not impress me and neither does her music, her songs are soooooo depressing!!! I like optimistic songs please. I know she says that this album is actually her, so good for her. Because with the amount of albums she has sold, the people like her better this way too. So good for them. But please, if you are like me, and live a happy optimistic life, and LIKE it that way, DONT buy this cd.
B000002TQV|4.0|I didn't payed attention to Radiohead in the years. I thought that it wasn't my style. That all changed when I heard &quot;Creep&quot; and &quot;Street Spirit&quot;. This must have a better examination!<br />And it was worth it. Radiohead's second album was one of the finest rock albums of the 90's. It starts with the melodic &quot;Planet Telex&quot; and rocks further with &quot;The Bends&quot;. &quot;High and Dry&quot; is a melodic mellow rock song which gave me the shivers hearing it. &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot; is one of my three favorites on this album, beautiful song. The voice of Thom Yorke really excells on this. &quot;Bones&quot; is a song which starts easy but gets stronger as it goes on. &quot;Nice Dream&quot; is a quiet song, very melodic. &quot;Just&quot; is a strong rock song, &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; isn't really one of my favorites. &quot;Bullet Proof&quot; is a dreamy, melodic song and shows a more sensitive side. &quot;Black Star&quot; is, just like &quot;My Iron Lung&quot; not really my favorite, but they are not bad. Leaves my other two favorites on this album, &quot;Sulk&quot; is an energetic song with a very good end, and &quot;Street Spirit&quot; is just plain beautiful.<br />So if you are a rock fan, and you didn't try Radiohead yet, this album is a very good place to start!
0064409422|5.0|I read this book for the first time in second grade.  I loved it so much, I read the rest of the series.  I own the books now, in Hardcover.  I continue to reread them every couple of years.  They are outstanding!  Even in second grade, I understood the Christian undertones of the book and I think it is wonderful!  Even for those who do not believe in the Christian Faith, there are moral lessons for good living.  I have started to read them to my children, as well.  These are classic and timeless.  CS Lewis is one of the best authors of all time.  Even years later, I can't put them down!  Bravo!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I liked it, but not as much as the first.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Footnote: Official Actual Rating: **** (Four star rating).<br />In a misty cloud battered haze of physical violation, chemical indoctrination, and personal emotional dissociation, a beleaguered embittered surrogate adult emboldened to despair through an entire encompassing childhood chock-filled with apocalyptic prognostications that long ago whittled away at the isles of innocence of his past before they had any remote chance to take roost, John Connor (Nick Stahl) rounds the charred battered interior corner of Catherine Brewster's (Claire Danes) veterinary clinic only to uncover and beholden the perspiration lacking resolve of an unnatural athletic paragon of physicality, who known simply as the Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), wearing only the color black and marching glumly forward towards the potential future human leader of the post-nuclear war resistance and blankly croaks mechanistically &quot;John Connor...., it is time.&quot; This ominous introduction is the central narrative beginning of the inevitable arrival of the first non-James Cameron related cinematic voyage down the silvery paths of those adored mythical technologically horrific dreamscapes that had permanently laid waste and irrevocably attached themselves to the public psyche for these last twenty years. In the immortal action science-fiction masterworks that are Cameron's The Terminator (1984) and the peerless box-office behemoth standard Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), Cameron authored a melancholic private canvas of personalized metaphorical sacrifice that absorbed the inhumanity of personal indifference and its ultimate manifestation technology in a beseeching melodic lamenting wail that embraced the unnerving subliminal undercurrent of contemporary angst that remained smolderingly relevant in the decade of the 1980's and lent it an audibly smoldering permanent voice that blisteringly echoes ever-increasingly in the decades since. One only has to mumble \\"Hasta La Vista Baby\\" to immediately mentally time travel anew back to the early nineties when one first encountered that immortal film line and the emotional underpinnings that led to that ultimate masculine moment being said in the first place.<br />In these pure cathartic strangely dignified magnum opuses of rhythmically culminated completeness, Cameron's first two Terminator films will always maintain an indefinite hold of the literate action mantle (what little there is of one) for many inconceivable immeasurable years to come. The Terminator franchise became an international institution of blatant originality defiantly visible internationality and boldly exclaiming the arrival of a new poet laureate of the silver screen in the form of Cameron himself. Yet like some dreams, they ultimately have to come to the end of one visionary and enter the sometimes alarming new view of another. Jonathon Malstow's third essentially inevitable 172 million dollar budgeted continuation of the James Cameron saga was under such a firing range of mixed divisiveness on all sides it was very difficult to see the final product away from the immense conflictive disagreement that resonated from all sides of the cinema going aisle. Both purists and brand new fans alike could not authoritatively come to any sort of (unsurprisingly) coherent consensus over what conclusively was still only a movie after all things were said and done and will always remain one for as long as video stores still have the (loud crackling voice echoes from the heavens) \\"all-impressive\\", \\"all seeing\\", and \\"all knowing\\" $0.50 rack still there to enlighten us illiterate cretins out there in TV land with the light of day.<br />As for the film itself running a brisk formidably pressing Hollywood running time of only 110 minutes (ten of which are invested in the richly-deserved specials effects specific ending credits), Malstow's Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines, is actually an surprisingly effective, atmospherically chilling, disarmingly action abounding, and unqualifiedly monumentally sublime savvy repackaging of the Terminator myth. With as many captivating passages, spontaneously enrapturing action sequences, a droll superlatively macabre Schwarzenegger, two singularly unrivaled optimally unbelievable earthly leading performances by Nick Stahl and Claire Danes, a perturbing undefeatable notable heavy in the nimbly stupefying and viperously irreproachable Terminator T-X (Kristanna Loken), an incessantly untold quotable entourage of glib one-liners (\\"Talk to the hand\\", \\"She'll be back\\", \\"Your levity is Good\\"), an hysterically intense schizoid cameo appearance from our old favorite cerebral dunce Dr. Peter Silberman (matchlessly played by Earl Boen in his third consecutive appearance in the series), dauntlessly vivacious first-class photo-realistic special effects by Industrial Light and Magic ,and as many stirring ambiguous chronological essential mysteries as you have come to expect from the Terminator universe, T3 continuously ignited. Warts of new helmsmanship and all, this is a very commendably smooth-sailing ride of ideal action articulated accuracy. No one that ferries any ill-conceived slanderous notions of perfection, blasphemous torrents of acute betrayal, or grandiose anticipations of the second coming of Judgment Day should have any forcefully sound worrisome disagreements with the final supremely delectable terminal aftermath. Providing your mind is as inordinately open as Arnold's T-800 defender unit was in Terminator 2.<br />As for the Terminator 3: The Rise of the Machines DVD two disc special edition, it includes a stunningly defined 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen presentation, a clarified Dolby Digital 5.1 English audio track, two audio commentary tracks: a charitably forward cast and director commentary track including Jonathan Malstow, Claire Danes, Nick Stahl, Kristanna Loken, and (for a awestruck dramatic first time on DVD audio tracks) Arnold Schwarzenegger himself and an authoritative director commentary by Malstow, several tantalizing special effect supplements, the inclusion of a deleted scene entitled Sgt. Candy, a flippantly uproarious deleted scene excluded from the theatrical release of the film which embellishes upon the T-800's origins (Worth the price of the DVD alone), and numerous other textual inclusions that the round out the entire package.<br />P.S. Depending on how you discern it, this could essentially be a valiantly superior final capper for a richly multi-faceted well beloved film trilogy than the Matrix Revolutions. No offense meant Wachowski Brothers.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|The pop starlet has yet again released an album. Unlike her past albums however, this album has deep credibility in it's content. With producers ranging from RedZone to Moby, this album is a sure stepping stone in Spears' career. A definite move from pop princess to just plain pop queen. While her voice isn't the best in the buisness, it does have it's glory moments in songs like &quot;Toxic&quot; and &quot;Shadow&quot;. It is an enjoyable album to listen to whether you're a fan or not. There are many styles of music throughout the cd, even a little regae! Younger fans will dance along with the beats of &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, while Spears' older fans can get &quot;get inspired&quot; with songs like &quot;Breath on Me&quot; and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;. This is no doubt Britney's best effort yet and a great CD to listen to no matter what mood your in.
B0000TB050|2.0|I'm sure it was great to be at this show in person...but this release was phoned in. If you already own the Elevation - Live in Boston dvd, there's little reason to purchase this one (unless you are an obsessive collector). The camerawork pales greatly in comparison with the Boston dvd. The Boston show has arguably the best cinematography for a concert video ever...whereas this one is mediocre. The show was obviously shot with digital cameras and they are known to not be that great when filming in dark lighting (ie: concerts). As well, given that the Slane venue is sooo huge, there are many shots that don't feel intimate to say the least. As well as, there are many (too) far away shots of the band and tons of (unnecessary) shots of the audience. The setlist, given that it is from the same tour as the Boston show, isn't all that different. It's nice to see One and Pride which had been omitted from the other dvd...but most of these songs are the same. Out of Control is probably the highlight as it is rare that the band performs it. The sound of this dvd is great. The extras are inferior (again) to that of those on the Boston dvd. The inclusion of the Unforgettable Fire doc is kinda cool, but it feels a little out of place given that it is from almost 20 years ago. To me, this looks like the record company cashing in for the Christmas season. There is absolutely no need to release 2 concerts on dvd from the same tour...especially when one is so much better than the other. BUY LIVE IN BOSTON!!!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I have to say, I bought the last album, BRITNEY, with much skepticism.  I wasn't sure how much I liked SLAVE but i have to admit, I really liked the last CD a lot.  It was mature, yet still with a touch of innocence, which is what Britney I think symbolized back then.<br />She now returns with her &quot;mature&quot; disc and I have to say I am not as impressed.  Me against the music is an interesting lead off single and it features Madonna for the first time being a guest star on any record with the exception of her few unnamed cameos on Jellybean records.  After awhile, I must say it grew on me.<br />The rest of the CD kinda goes really good or really bad.  I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM is a joke.  It's hard to see Britney be credible with the Ying Yang Twins.  OUTRAGEOUS is horrid, produced by R.Kelly but I guess that really isn't my kinda music.  However, there are a lot of good track on the album.  TOXIC is a hard hitting beat of pop music with a Bollywood backbeat which strangely works while BRAVE NEW GIRL features her RAPPING! Yes rapping.  She's not gonna be the next 2pac anytime soon but it works on this track.<br />I'm glad to see Britney taking some co-writing duties, but I have to question how this album will do.  Of course, her fanbase will pick this up, but how about how long it remains on the charts afterwards.  Like most artists, her first album did well and the ones that followed lost sales.  Now 4 million CD's sold for Britney may be good but when compared to Baby One More Time's 12 million, you have to wonder where did it all go.<br />I'm hoping for the best for this new cd but I just can't help to think, this will be her &quot;flop&quot; in comparison to the other cds.  Here's looking to the fifth, which should really mark a triumphant comeback!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have loved Britney from the very beginning.  This album is pretty different from her past stuff, but its really great!!  It has something for everyone and definitely moves in a more mature direction.  My personal favorites are Breathe On Me, Touch of My Hand and The Hook Up.  This is a diverse CD that at first listen may be different, but is really worth giving multiple listenings to!  Give it a try!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's Chicago DVD is her best work by far! She puts on an awesome performance and empowers her fans everywhere!
B000089RVR|4.0|Starts out with the hit WhiteFlag - and doesn't stop - its not really deep lyrics - just a variety of upbeat beats and clam music - like a re-invented enya - well maybee not that relaxing but you get the idea....
B0000CAQ27|2.0|Ever since Pink released her first &quot;There you go&quot; single, I've loved her!  Can't take this home and Misundaztood were great.  So I've been waiting a while for this CD and yes I am very disappointed.  The only tracks I liked are those ones with Linda Perry.  I liked &quot;trouble&quot; but it got old quick.  I love Pink, her attitude and her voice.  But I simply did not like this album very much.  Let's try for the fourth one.  I'll be waiting.
0385335482|5.0|Sophie Kinsella introduces &quot;Becky Bloomwood&quot; who has a job at a newspaper in London. Not to mention an overdraft that keeps increasing, or should I say it is decreasing her banking account. And she has creditors who are knocking at her door and sending her letter after letter, amusing the reader with the excuses people will use in life. Becky Bloomwood was born to shop, and she loves clothing. Credit is due to her, in her attempts to expand her knowledge of &quot;accessories&quot; even in the workplace and work-related events:<BR>&quot;The FT [Financial Times} is by far the best accessory a girl can have. It's major advantages are: 1) It is a nice color.<BR>2) It only costs eighty-five pence, and 3) ...people take you seriously. With an FT under your arm, you can talk about the most frivolous thing in the world and insteead of thinking you're an airhead, people think you're a heavyweight intellectual who has broader intereste too.&quot;<BR>And Becky does have broader interests...like that new scarf at &quot;George and Denny's&quot; and her new handbag and...Luke Brandon, head of Brandon Communications. She sees him at all of these financial press conferences that interrupt her chances to take advantage of sales in her favorite stores. Or just any sotre. I also give Becky credit in that she guatantees to maintain her intellectual image. But unfortunately MY credit does not suffice for Becky's overdrawn bank accounts. She has to pay her bills and she struggles as her flatmate Suze helps her with her money issues. Somehow, the reader manages to love Becky because she is so honest and blatant about her knowledge - or lack of it - to the reader, at least. &quot;So anyway. There I am with the FT tucked under my arm, thinking I look pretty good, and half-wishing that someone from &quot;Just Seventeen&quot; would pop up with a camera.&quot; <BR>Hey, don't we all wish these things as we go through life, having to maintain an image while also maintaining our good spirits?! I read all three of the &quot;Shopaholic&quot; books, and Becky Bloomwood, now that I have finished the trilogy, is like a lost friend to me - I miss her!<BR>But I cannot wait to read Kinsella's next novels!!!<BR>Anyone who loves to shop, read, and laugh will enjoy this one!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is so far, Britney's best album. Every track is a jewel. Every song is totally original and perfect. My favorite songs are &quot;Breathe on me&quot;, &quot;Touch of my hand&quot; and &quot;Everytime&quot;. This is sophisticated, elegant and beautiful pop. Congratulations to Britney Spears.
B0000A36J5|3.0|Yes, the look of Middle Earth as portrayed by Jackson is stunning and perfect.  The casting, costuming, sets, etc. are perfect.  This whole production of the greatest trilogy in the history of literature (can even Dante compare?)came so close... so close... and yet, so far away.  Bad enough the stuff about Aragorn being a reluctant king (not in the books!)  Bad enough that Gimli becomes a comic figure.  Bad enough that Frodo & Co. end up kidnapped to Osgiliath by Faramir.  But then, when Frodo  ascends the parapet (really bad cut here; we don't see him begin the ascent, but suddenly he's up there) and then the nazgul rises before him... what does Frodo do?  He shows the Ringwraith the Ring!  And this is Peter's Stunning Error.  Earth to Peter ---  Show's Over!  <br />Once the Ringwraiths know where the ring is, what is the purpose of everything that comes after?  Aragon's tussle with Sauron via the palantir is meaningless.  Sauron knows who has the ring; Frodo showed it to a Ringwraith!  The battle of Pellenor fields is meaningless.  Every feint and subterfuge of Gandalf and Co. is meaningless.  Sauron knows where the ring is (unless you want to be so dimwitted as to assume that the Wraiths don't communicate with Sauron regarding the chief goal of his existence)!  <br />.  Oh well  Maybe fifty years from now, somebody will take a better shot at it, with even better technology.  I won't be here for it.  Or maybe Peter will wake up, reshoot the Faramir scenes, dump the trip to Osgiliath, and put Shelob back where she belongs at the end of the Two Towers, then re-release a new version.  Like I said... so close, and yet so far away.<br />BTW, the little statuette of Gollum is very well done and carries the WEDA imprimatur of quality.  I'm very glad to have it.  However, it's a real BEAR to get out of the package!
B000069CWE|5.0|If you have a DVD-Audio compatible player, get this disc NOW.  It was designed specifically for this multi-channel format and takes full advantage of the surrounds.  Its natural too and doesn't sound &quot;pushed&quot; or like you're listening to a CD in one of your receiver's Hall, Theatre, Jazz Club modes.  This is the real deal.  If I want to impress someone with my system and show off my new DVD-Audio player, this is the 1st disc I grab.  Even if you aren't a huge Linkin Park fan, you will still smile while listening to the sounds coming from your surrounds while listening to this amazing disc.  Other artists need to follow the leader here and give us more discs like this one.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Wow,<BR>I am at a loss for words, This CD is awesome, she has really grown up, I love all the songs on this CD. I am a Britney Fan she is a real down to earth sweetheart and she has a unquie voice that doesn't sounds like the next one-hit-wonders. You go girl, your new cd is wonderful, my favs would have to be &quot;The Touch Of My Hand&quot; &quot;Breath On Me&quot; &quot;I Got That (Boom, Boom)&quot; &quot;Shadow&quot; &quot;Toxic&quot; &quot;Early Mornin'&quot;. Brit, you are a very beautiful woman and I wish you all the success you deserve, I would say this is her best cd yet, it doesn't have that teen pop beat to it, it has more of an adult grown up beat, the music on this cd is banging, I can't wait till to see what her next cd is going to be like. Keep On Rockin!!!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This remix prompts a re-assesment of this underrated album. Let It Be has always been maligned because it was maligned when first released.  The White Album has always been a critical favorite because it was a critical favorite when first released due to its avante garde/anti- commercial image.  The actual music on these two albums has almost nothing to do with their long-standing reputations.  The fact is that there is nothing on the White Album that is anywhere near as good as the best 5 songs on Let It Be. And lesser songs like Dig A Pony and One After 909 would be among the best tracks on the White Album.<BR> So at last we hear this album the way Paul would have preferred it without the nearly muzak touches of Phil Spector.  The vocals stand out a bit more and everything sounds a bit clearer.  The sequence of the songs is the biggest change along with the addition of Don't Let Me Down.  The stripped down ...Universe and ...Winding Road are nice alternatives, but I won't be selling my copy of the original recording.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is Radioheads best album so far, and is the most musicaly accomplished rock album. Greatly advised. If you liked it, the next album to try is The Bends, then Hail to the Thief, then Kid A, which also is an amazing album once you understand it.<br />Mal-2
B00008S2VG|1.0|how is madonna famous? her voice is pittyful...i don't hear any range or high notes...her music is louder than her voice and that just sux i don't know why you guys are wasting your money or her???!!
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|Sounds pretty much like the first album.  If I had heard this one before &quot;This is it&quot;, though, I'd probably say the same thing about that album. So, both are good albums, but they probably could have put all the songs on one CD. They need to shake it up a little on the next album.
014028009X|1.0|Oh I wanted to like this. I'm usually a fan of diary-type novels but this was dire. The saddest part of the whole Bridget Jones lore is the fact that the book was so successful. So many women screaming with laughter thinking this novel mirrors their life when, if it really does, then it isn't really a lot to laugh about.<br />Fielding lays out a fairly bog-standard plot. Bridget is a loser, then a man enters her life and she is a winner. The man leaves and she is a loser again. Been done before, been done better. In addition, Fielding rips off an earlier 'diary' novel for the whole fancy dress/not fancy dress party plotline (Diary of a Somebody by Christopher Matthew, written in the late 1970's and obviously quite a popular read with Fielding).
B0000CAQ27|2.0|While Pink is one of today's most talented singers, she seems to have lost touch with her song writing &amp; interpretive skills.  I truly believe that Pink has the potential to become a legend.  Her voice is dynamic and soulful, but on this album it hardly shows.  I am truly disappointed.  Pink's album is a collection of spiteful trash.  It lacks direction and heart.  It's great to have an I don't care attitude, but it really shouldn't come across in your music.  Sorry, Pink, you really lost me on this one.  -Looking forward to hearing more and better from you!!!
0345440900|4.0|I am surprised by the level of negativity in some of these reviews, and by the fact that some people really took offense to suggestions in this book.  Although not everything in this book worked for us, (as not every book is tailored just for one person!) I took from the book some info that helped me listen to my child and ultimately made both of us much happier.  For instance, at 3 months of age my son wouldn't nap and wouldn't nurse without falling asleep every time.  Therefore I was feeding him almost every hour and feedings were backing up into each other because he kept falling asleep.  After reading this and a few other books on breastfeeding, I attempted to implement our version of EASY.  It took about 3-4 days in which I worked very hard to give my child some version of a nap (standing over the cradle patting, picking him up and walking, rocking, putting him back down when he stopped crying, etc.)  At the end of the week he would take a good 30-45 minute nap every 2-2.5 hours or so.  This is a shorter time frame than EASY suggests, but it meant that he was rested enough when he awoke that he could nurse effectively.  He's 7 months old now and we still have a version of this routine in place with a longer EASY span and longer naps.  It really helped me understand that not every cry is a hunger cry, if you have some predictability in your day then you can diagnose that cry pretty quickly and give your child what he needs.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Though critics claim that Britney is declining, I would have to say otherwise! Her 4th album is hands down the best yet! &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; is a catchy song, as is &quot;I've Got That Boom, Boom&quot; and so many others. In no way does any of her songs sound childish, as alot of them did on her previous albums. She may be a bit racy, but she doesn't go overboard with it. After listening to this album, you will be convinced that Britney is not going away...she's still the best! BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I LOVE BRITNEY AND I LOVE HOW SHE HAS MATURED AND THIS CD ROCKS!<BR>I AM 26 AND I DON'T CARE!  I WAITED IN LINE TO GET THIS CD AND IT WAS WORTH IT!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have always loved Britney and I am older than her normal listener....I wont say how old. <BR>This album is amazing. &quot;Everytime&quot; made me cry the first time I heard it. It reminds me of how it feels to fall in love and then get your heart broken. I know it is about her and Justin...and that just makes me crave more. But it does not stop there! Her other songs are so fun and energizing. They are great for the morning ride to work. Thanks Brit...oops you did it again. Keep rockin' my music world.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD shows why Shania is the entertainer of the year in my mind. She puts so much energy into her performances and the crowd feeds off of it.  All of her hits are performed here and you will love every minute of it.  Pick this up today!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is one of Country music's greatest artists. I have seen Shania live in concert multiple times and thought no concert DVD could come close to showing in her energy and enthusiasm for music but this DVD does.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I think that Britney hit it right on the head with her 4th album. She is not jumping the shark and becoming D-I-R-R-T-Y like some other performers. She really needs to change her image little by little or she won't be around much longer ,,, her 6-12 year old fans are getting older and so is she.<BR>Parents ,, stop looking to her as your kids roll model ,, raise your own kids and protect them from much more important things !<BR>The album is loaded with cool dance songs and really nice change up in vocals from song to song ...  I think she did Do It Again !   :)
0679720200|5.0|If you want to get into Existentialism and absurdity, this is the plave to start.  This book is an excellent character study on Mersault, an indifferent character who pretty much sums up the absurdist philosophy.  Camus is an excellent writer and philosopher and if you enjoy this book check out his other ones, especially his philosophical articles.  I have just started reading this book again for the 3rd time and i am enjoying it just as much, and I am moved just as much as I was the first time.  Definitely recommend it.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I have to say that I absolutely love this album. The beats are great a little Madonna-esque but I think it's Britney's best c.d. yet. Of course it's fairly juveneille and simple but it's all I've listened to for the past 24 hours and i haven't got sick of it yet so it can't be that horrible. Personal favorites are Toxic and Breathe on Me which is maybe the best song vocally on the album. I would recommend this album though for ten bucks and a lot of songs to shake your a** to it's worth it.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I want my money back! Try singing without back tracks and with a live band for once instead of back tracks, I like the jessica Simpson and Mandy moore Cd's much better. Suggest putting your clothes back on and learn to sing for real. Her song with Madonna does not add up to the cost of this junk......Yes I own other Britney CD's just want to sell this one fast.
B00005JM02|5.0|Great message that kids with &quot;handicaps&quot; (little fin, ADHD, addiction with the sharks, etc) can all make it through adversity and accomplish anything.  Pixar animation and humor are both wonderful...again!
B000002H72|5.0|Some would say this album is arguably the 'best' alternative rock album ever released. No need to argue. It is. From beginning to end, there isn't a weak track. Do yourself a favor and listen to this album. It'll make your life more enjoyable! <BR> On a side note, I don't know how the hell I missed the Pixies back in the late 80's. Where the hell was I? I'll never forgive myself. And I thought Nirvana were good, sheesh. But anyway...
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I submit  the real reason McCartney in particular spearheaded this release of Let It Be...Naked was the rarely discussed second disc entitled Fly On The Wall. &quot;Fly&quot; reveals for the first time the real dynamics behind The Beatles break up. Simply put, McCartney's talents were still blossoming and growing while at this stage Lennon and Harrison were not in step with keeping up with  McCartney's single minded devotion to the craft necessary to keep this legendary band in working order.<BR>Here are a number of shockers which are revealed historically for the first time by &quot;Fly&quot;: <BR>You hear somebody playing a piano to the tune of Lennon's legendary song &quot;Imagine.&quot; <BR>At best, this new revelation means the tune can no longer be classified as strictly a Lennon solo creation. (At worst, how do we know it is not McCartney actually playing this melody?) It has been common Beatle knowledge that another standout on Lennon's solo career Child of Nature was a Beatle work in progress (appearing as &quot;Jealous Guy&quot;) and Harrison's seminal &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; was another. It's almost as if Lennon and Harrison's greatest solo achievement were seeded as Beatles presumably with McCartney contributions sprinkled.<BR>McCartney directly addresses the other Beatles for bemoaning that &quot;things have gone downhill&quot; since the death of their manager Brian Epstein (who interestingly enough they all refer to as &quot;Mr.&quot; Epstein). <BR>As Paul says almost verbatim, it's as if daddy's gone now and that is the natural order of the world and it is time for Mr. Epstein's boys to stand on their own two feet; which they should be perfectly capable of doing having been fathered well for their formative years.<BR>Lennon expresses a concern most Beatle fans have been grappling with: How could a band that stands for &quot;all you need is love&quot; fall apart due to acrimony and disputes? <BR>It's always been a historical contradiction thatthroughout Lennon's campaign for peace, and Harrison's quest for global love that they were unable to coexist with each other or ever reunite. Fly reveals that the acrimony was inevitable due to the divergence of work ethic and appreciation for the significance The Beatles as between Paul on the one hand and George and John on the other.<br />Returning to the disparity of desire to strive for excellence between Paul and the other three consider the following examples sprinkled throughout Fly:<BR>Harrison good naturedly chides McCartney saying &quot;There he goes, playing the bass again&quot; to which McCartney responds by ripping into an amazing bass solo which manages to mimic (with Harrison's narration) an oboe and trombone. The disc then segues into a solo piano piece written and played by McCartney (never before heard by Beatle fans) that stands on a par with a J.S. Bach composition. This juxtaposed by sloppy playing on Get Back by both Lennon and Harrison on the song &quot;Get Back&quot; which has McCartney obviously frustrated and frighteningly aware these other three member were no longer on par with him.<BR>Even Ringo is cited for not putting effort into writing more after Harrison proclaims that a favorite song of Bob Dylan and The Band's was &quot;Don't Pass Me By.&quot; Harrison in general is infatuated with a childish grass is always greener view of the scene he recently returned from at Woodstock where in his words the guys all live together in a house..and happen to also be a band - making for a seamless work and living arrangement.<BR>But by far, the most enlightening nuggets of Fly comes in the various plans The Beatles have to cap off the movie documentary with a dramatic live show of some kind. At one point Lennon and McCartney are excited about the idea of performing on an ocean liner like the QE2. Harrison derides the idea as &quot;insane&quot; and too expensive. With historical hindsight can you Harrison's short sidedness in thinking a Beatle'sproject losing money in the long run?<BR>This desire to do something in terms of performing as long as it was unique and unexpected puts into a new historical light McCartney's rather bizarre early Wings tours where the band would get on a bus and showed up unannounced at a college campus. McCartney even through out the idea that the performance should end with the police and authorities showing up to halt the performance. The question now is was the rooftop raid by The British Bobbies a prophetic vision that McCartney had, or was the bust &quot;staged?&quot; <br />Notwithstanding all the light shone on The Beatles at this snapshot in time, Paul ends the disc in an amazingly humble and deferential fashion. He asks somebody &quot;Which way did John go?&quot; Meaning, in the end, Paul recognized Lennon for who he was and remained willing to follow his friends lead until it was no longer possible.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|I was intrigued with the 2nd album and songs like &quot;On The Air&quot; and &quot;DIY&quot; and the fact that Robert Fripp was involved.  But, this album does not really hold up well enough IN MY OPINION to have anything on a greatest hits album.  Maybe &quot;DIY&quot; should have been included just as a representative.<br />And, in my opinion, &quot;Steam&quot; and &quot;Big Time&quot; could have been left off, and &quot;I have the touch&quot; and one or two other songs added!  All just personal preferences that do not represent others opinions.<br />All in all it is hard to fault the selection based on my preferences.  Gabriel is so worth listening to, and that is why we are peeved at the song selection.<br />Why not a disc three - with all the missing favorites?  Maybe a fan club can take a poll and suggest a selection for a third disc.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|On Nov 29th 2002, the Royal Albert Hall played host to &quot;The Concert For George&quot;, in which all the proceeds went to some of George Harrisons favorite charities.  Organized by his widow Olivia, son Dhani and Eric Clapton, this all-star celebration of the life and music of George Harrison, proves to be both somber and happy, as friends and musicians play touching covers of some of Georges biggest hits.  Just like the &quot;Concert For Banglsdesh&quot;, the show starts of with an indian music session, which features a full orchestra of eastern and western musicians, playing songs composed by his friend and mentor, Ravi Shankar.  The real treat is watching his daughter Anoushka, play the sitar.  She was the centerpiece of the entire performance.  She was simply phenominal, proving that she is indeed, like her father, a master of the sitar.  The rock n roll side of the show opened up with Jeff Lynne singing &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot;, which set the tone for the rest of the show, in which the all-star cast played one Harrison tune after another with genuine feeling from the heart.  Dhani Harrison played rhythm acoustic and electric guitar during the entire show, and is the splitting image of his father.  The guest list reads like a who's who of music.  Besides Clapton, You will see Jools Holland,Tom Petty,Billy Preston,Ringo Starr,Paul McCartney,Gary Brooker,Jim Capaldi and great session people like, Jim Keltner,Ray Cooper,Jim Horn,Tom Scott,Albert Lee,Klaus Voormann,Chris Stainton,Henry Spinetti and Andy Fairweather Low.  Some of the highlights include, Billy Prestons take on &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Isn't It A Pity&quot;, Tom Petty doing &quot;Handle With Care&quot;, Paul McCartney and Clapton on &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;.  Overall, I must say that you can tell, that a lot of effort went into this production, as evident by the wonderful sound and picture quality as well as the handsome packaging that the DVD is housed in.  Hearing Joe Brown end the show with an emotional &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams&quot;, instead of an obligatory all-star encore jam, is what George Harrison was all about.  He was a simple man, who loved melodies, valued his privacy over his celebrity and always lent a helping hand to those less fortunate.  I highly recommend this DVD to one and all.
0618154043|5.0|An elegantly fantastic read! I continue to marvel at Tolkien's myth-making abilities. Like the Silmarillion -- which incidently I enjoyed even more than LOTR -- The Unfinished Tales read like the best of First Testament biblical literature. A true epic!
B000062X9B|5.0|Well where do u start with a CD as good as this??? I never thought I'd hear someone do \\"I won't back Down\\" better than Tom Petty, but gee Johnny Cash gives him a run for his money. Thats only one song but somehow its so good it makes the whole album worth it. And then the bonus is all the 13 other tracks are great too!!! The title track is done sooo well, then tracks like \\"Darkness\\" with its great line \\"And we can stop our whoring/and pull the smiles inside\\" I am shocked at how great he is. Johnny Cash was prodcuing some of the best music of his career even the final years, even in the final days. He was The Man in Black. A one in a billion. Peace Johnny++++++++++
B000005DQR|5.0|I must say this is one of my favorite albums that I own and I have over 300 cds.  I really don't know what to say about this album though.  It is different than anything out there.  It highly recommend that you purchase this album, get some headphones, and sit or lay in a dark room and just take it all in.  You will not be dissappointed by anymeans if you are a fan of music at all.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Shouldn't be that difficult to put together a definitive best of from such a great artist.  1st 2 albums under-emphasized, missing &quot;I Have The Touch&quot;, one of my favorites - didn't realize it was not on the CD until I got it home - it's such an obvious choice (&amp; better track than a lot of what made the cut)that I didn't even bother to make sure it was on the CD.  Does have &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, which the prior &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot; compilation inexplicably omitted.  Plus, &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; sloppily cuts in and begins in the middle of the first note of the song instead of the actual start - this will be annoying to anyone who really likes this song(if they needed to cut time, why not fade a song or two out a bit earlier, no one would notice).  It's this kind of stuff that pushes folks to the internet for downloads...
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...] For me, reviewing this CD is tough, as Let It Be has always been my least favourite of the post-Pepper albums.  Some great individual tracks, but never a standout for me as a collection the way Abbey Road was and is.  That being said, the least brilliant Beatles album is still better than 99% of the pop music in existence.  In comparison to the original, this disc sounds fantastic to me.  How much of it is due to the stripping of Phil Spector's work, and how much of it is due to the wonders of digital remastering is tough to say.  Most of the tracks sound pretty much like the originals, until you play them back to back.  Hiss and distortion on the original CD version of this album that you never knew was there suddenly becomes very apparent when compared to the new versions presented here.  The instruments on the original version sound like they are being played through wet towels, and the vocals being pumped through a tin can by comparison.  Crisp, clean, and clear is the new.  Worth the price of admission all by itself.  Like most fans, I've invested many hundreds of dollars into my Beatles collection on CD, and if all of them were to be given the same treatment as this one from a clean up point of view, I'd go out and buy them all again.  As for the tracks with major changes, Across the Universe benefited the most in my opinion.  As indicated by a previous reviewer, The Long and Winding Road seems to have less of a \\"grand\\" feel, and preferences on that are going to be pretty much up to personal taste.  As with the other tracks, the vocals are much more clear than the Spector versions.  Anyway, there is much to like about this version of the album, if not for the major changes to certain tracks, for the wonderful clarity brought to others.  This is as close as you're going to get to having the boys playing live in your living-room.  All that being said, this doesn't change it's place in my ranking of Beatles' albums, and I suspect that will be the case for most fans.
B0000TB03W|5.0|If you are looking for a great holiday gift, I would highly recommend Shania Twain's UP! Live in Chicago. This DVD has great footage of Shania. As always Shania will amaze you with her wonderful voice and you will be singing her songs for weeks! This DVD is just amazing!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Solid fun pop cd.  I am not a huge Britney fan, but I think people should take it easy on her.  The CD is not the best you will ever hear, but there are lots of fun dance songs and a few good slow songs too.
0393307050|5.0|This is absolutely a superb piece of historical fiction.  Patrick O'Brian had a craftsman's ear for period dialogue and a master storyteller's way with a tale.  All the Aubrey-Maturin novels are highly recommended.  For modern equivalents, I must recommend the newly published IRON COFFIN by John Mannock, also available on Amazon.  This WWII U-boat tale thrills and tugs the heartstrings like the best of O'Brian.  I mention it because it affected me much the same way as MASTER AND COMMANDER (the film) and I finished reading my advance edition of it the same night I saw the filmed version of O'Brian's work.  Two classics in one night.  Very satisfying.
B00009UW0N|5.0|This is my favorite movie of ALL TIME!  And it continues to give me chills whenever I watch it.  No other movie from nearly 30 years ago has ever been able to do so.  This is the most terrifying movie ever and it continues to have the same impact it did when it first came out.  A young Jamie Lee Curtis really made her mark and began her career with the role that got her deemed the scream queen (a real honor being the daughter of the original scream queen Janet Lee).  She followed up this movie with the sequel, although not at great, a really good movie in and of itself.  But the original Halloween just cannot be dupicated and no sequel or rip off has ever even come close.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|After 2 years of working behind the scenes, recording, and taking a break from show biz, this fourth album was going to either make or break Britney's career. The album is fantastic. There are funky beats that pick up right where 2001's Slave left off, and very few slow songs. The song topics are much more mature than previous Britney songs, talking more about partying and life as a young adult than ever. I bought it... and I can't stop listening to it. It is so catchy!
B00003CXA2|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 11, and remember it being one of the first films I knew was actually genius.  This movie is where I got the little history I know from.  One of Robin Wright's 2 breakthrough performances (along with Princess Bride) and another of Hank's Oscar winning roles (greatly deserved).  And you can't mention great performances without mentioning those by Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field.  Too bad they all couldn't have won Oscars.  <BR>I was really excited about the special edition DVD and was not disappointed.  Highlights include 2 commentarys, audition footage of a 5 year old Haley Joel Osment, a documentary and special effects footage.  The technological advancements made with this film are spectacular and it's really interesting to see just how difficult things that may only appear on screen for a few seconds were to film, take after take.  I greatly respect and admire all those involved with this film.  And agree with everyone that includes this movie as one of the classics.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I've liked (not loved) Britney's past albums, they each had some great songs amongst mostly filler songs,  but this one doesn't even live up to that low standard. Upon first spin, most of the songs encourage a knee-jerk 'skip' reaction. Definitely NOT something that you want in an album. Some of the songs have grown on me though, but there is no real vocal talent here. Most of these songs are very repetitive and lackluster, a-la Kylie Minogue. So why the three stars? She's such a nice girl. But as for the CD? Pass this one up and pick up Christina's latest masterpiece, &quot;Stripped,&quot; if you don't yet own it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is off the hook. Britney brings it on in this cd. Much more mature then her other cds. This cd will make you dance and her song Everytime will make you cry! That song shows everyone that she really can sing. Buy this CD!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Major opportunity missed here. This TWO-DISC package offers a total of barely 57 minutes of material! For the same cost, Apple could have easily given us this new LET IT BE mix along with BOTH of the original Glyn Johns mixes AND the &quot;Fly On The Wall&quot; montage!<br />Some songs sound very, very similar to previously issued versions. Others are presented in alternate takes familiar only to bootleg collectors. All of Phil Spector's strings and heavenly choruses have been removed. Sometimes this is a good thing (&quot;I Me Mine&quot;), but &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; sounds like an anemic demo without that Wall of Sound around it. All of the studio banter between takes has also been removed, relegated to a stingy, clumsily-assembled 22-minute montage on the second disc.<br />All of the tracks on this edition have been severely compressed to make them sound &quot;competitively loud.&quot; Compare to the current CD of the original LET IT BE, where the entire dynamic range of the master tape is presented intact. They did the same thing to the new YELLOW SUBMARINE remix. An ominous trend.<br />If you're a hard-core Beatles fan, you're already planning to get this release. If not, stick with the original Phil Spector version. It's simply a better record, Paul's misgivings notwithstanding.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is incredible. Perfect. Everything is perfect. That's the only word to describe it. Perfect. Well, actually. Not really. The only tracks that are outstanding are \\"Shadow,\\" \\"Everytime,\\" \\"Toxic,\\" \\"Brave New Girl,\\" and \\"Breathe On Me.\\" Everything else is exceptionally good, however the tracks mentioned are absolutely fabulous
0385504209|5.0|the Da Vinci Code is a wonderful book. It made me think, it made me do lots of research and it got me take another look at historical events and religious beliefs. Yet the story does not imply that faith is any less divine, it introduces other mysteries. It just brings up a lot of points and theories that are fasinating, yet I felt it was presented in a great story filled with mystery, intrigue and high action. I read so many books that I am rarely surprised or enthusiastic about what I read -not anymore! This book surprised me, made me question things I thought were written in stone, and I looked up every detail on the internet- go to Dan Browns web-site. The book cover is interactive! This book is just great! I mean it IS a story, but a lot of the theories check out!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This Cd is truely awesome! It proves Britneys here to stay! Every song on the Cd is amazing! If you a Britney fan you will love this its a more mature sounding album but awesome!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|No matter what opinions you may hold regarding Britney Spears' image, that shouldn't interfere with the music that is made.  &quot;In the Zone&quot; is her best album, hands down.  The music just makes you want to dance!  Music is meant to make people feel this good.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The first few times I listened to this CD I thought it was bland and uninteresting.  A few listens later and I was hooked - what Spears does here is subtle, but once it sinks in completely the album is transformed into an entirely new disc.  Spears has never been the strongest vocalist in pop, but she doesn't try to be.  The CD is full of whispers and moans, but it's what the material requires - no one could sing these songs better and have them work.  The songs are eclectic without being scattered.  Unlike Aguilera's &quot;Stripped,&quot; which covers every genre from jazz to grunge rock and can't seem to decide what sort of CD to be, &quot;In The Zone&quot; is consistently clubbable trip-hop with enough variation to distinguish the songs and prevent the album from getting boring.<br />Spears has certainly grown up with this project.  The saccharine teen-pop is gone, replaced by mature production values and enriched by a greater understanding by Spears of her capabilities and visions as an artist.  Spears is an entirely different sort of musician this time around, and the risks end up paying off.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|In case someone is wondering whether to buy it or not, let me provide them with some useful opinion, not tunnel vision statements and complaints. The album is totally DT. They have not changed their style, they didn't go thrash metal, Rudess shows and Portnoy doesn't suck. What I hear is a very eclectic album. I hear a lot of Metallica (J4All+Black Album), a lot of Faith No More (The Real Thing), a lot of Iron Maiden (Murray-Smith riffs) and also a lot of 6 Degrees (Glass Prision-ish). Generally this album is pretty dark, metallic, rough, in-your-face, angry, grey, but very accomplished. I could easily compare it with Metallica's masterpiece 'And Justice for All'. People who say 'this is not DT' is because they started listening to them with SFAM or 6 Degrees. This is totally DT, probably closer to Awake than any other. Personally, as in the first CD of 6 Degrees, I think many of the songs are too long and cumbersome. Those 12 minute songs are unnecessary at this point, under my point of view. I also thing songs 5 and 6 are way weaker than the rest. As we know, DT's records require at least 5 listens to get into them. Having gotten through that point, I really like the record. I'd advice anyone to buy it, not only because it is kick-ass, but because WHO THE F*** IS DOING METAL NOWADAYS OTHER THAN DT AND MAIDEN? This is a record that will stick around your car for a year easy.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|As one reviewer said, on In The Zone, Britney has grown into the artist she should be. Britney's best album to date. I love it! Ratings of the songs out of 5:<BR>1)  Me Against The Music (Featuring Madonna) - 5/5<BR>2)  (I Got That) Boom Boom (Featuring the Yin Yang Twins) - 5/5<BR>3)  Showdown - 4/5<BR>4)  Breathe On Me - 5/5<BR>5)  Early Mornin' - 4/5<BR>6)  Toxic - 5/5<BR>7)  Outrageous - 3/5<BR>8)  Touch Of My Hand - 5/5<BR>9)  The Hook Up - 4/5<BR>10)  Shadow - 5/5<BR>11)  Brave New Girl - 4/5<BR>12)  Everytime - 5/5<BR>13)  Me Against The Music (Featuring Madonna)- Rishi Rich's  <BR>     Desi Kulcha Remix - 4/5
B00005JKC3|5.0|After having just seen this amazing film I simply cannot understand all the negative reviews this much maligned comic-book adaption has received.<BR>This is a great film with a wonderfully paced and extremely well told story with fully developed, interesting characters.<BR>I'm convinced this will be regarded as a classic in the years to come. Ang Lee has done a superb job here.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|off the hook britney's back and with a bang,the new album is HOT that first beat comes on you just start to feel it in your vanes and it gose through your body and makes you move and you get to the point were you cant stop. the top three songs on the to me are toxic it's like you tasted the forbiddin fruit and you like it, touch of my hand just makes you feel sexy, and showdown the hook is so hot you can't get it out of your head the best britney album ever p.s get your own copy of in the zone hear at amazon .com DO IT NOW YOU WON'T BE SORRY YOU DID........

0316776963|5.0|I'd give this book 10 stars if I could. Need to revive a dead fish? Read him a chapter of &quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day.&quot; I picked it up at an airport bookstore this summer after previously bumping into David S. on NPR from time to time. I read it cover to cover virtually nonstop in about 3.5 hours. I laughed, and crying laughing, uncontrollably many times - part of the attraction. I started reading entries aloud to my friends in the weeks that followed. Any potential lulls in laughter are certainly the result of laughter overload and will, thankfully, give you a chance to refuel and read on! - Enjoy!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Loved Shania Twain's new Up! Live In Chicago DVD!<BR>She is very entergetic and fun to watch. She performs a mix of older tracks with new ones from her recent up! album. This one you can't miss. It's definately a must have for any Shania fan.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is probably the coolest, most exciting action film ever. The tension builds and explodes in total feverish madness. The action sequences are adrenaline-pumping and very VERY well-done.<br />They really assembled quite a cast here. These characters are so cool, you could watch them forever. Hudson, Bishop, Hicks, Drake, Vasquez, Apone, Newt and even Gorman. And let's not forget the fabulous Sigourney Weaver as Ripley, who gives a blistering performance here. <br />Anyway, enough reviewers have given the proper praise to this amazing film, so I'm not even gonna bother trying. I'm just here to give my 5-stars, and shut the hell up.<br />I love this damn movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I listened to it yesterday when I got it and it was well worth the wait! The cd is a great one. It really shows growth for her and its different than anything out there. Im really proud of her! I recommend this cd to everyone. Breathe on Me and Everytime are my two favorites so far.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay, so I don't own any of her other albums. I appreciated her radio songs, but that was it. This, however, is an excellent album. Very mature, very edgy, great to dance to. So maybe Britney never left the scene, but this album will definitely have her staying for a long time.
B00008972S|5.0|For all fans of film, musicals or all-around classics the Special Edition of &quot;West Side Story&quot; is a must have. This film has it all drama, comedy, music and stellar dancing.<br />Based on the 1957 Broadway hit, &quot;West Side&quot; was brought to the screen with all it's original energy and vibrancy. This special edition pulls out all the stops presenting the film in the widescreen format in newly re-mastered 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround with an option to view the film with or without it's original intermission. Bonus features include a stills gallery, collectible scrapbook, theatrical trailers and the original one-hour documentary &quot;West Side Memories&quot; which is great but is sorely missing the presence of two of its cast members: Natalie Wood (due to her untimely death in 1981; archival interviews would have been welcome) and George Chakiris (contractual).<br />Natalie Wood is perfect as &quot;Maria&quot;. She turns in a stellar performance. I disagree with her detractors. Natalie was the best possible choice to play &quot;Maria&quot;, with her dark hair and eyes she can easily pass for a latina, her accent does waiver in some spots but it doesnt hinder her performance. A latina wasn't necessarily needed to play this role, yes the role was that of a young Puerto Rican girl, but Natalie more than does the role justice. As I recall, the role of &quot;Maria&quot; was originated on Broadway by Carol Lawrence who isnt any more Puerto Rican than Miss Wood is. Listen to Miss Lawrence on the Original Broadway Cast CD, she doesnt even have an accent! Just one viewing of Natalie's performance in the final scene is proof enough she was more than up to the challenge.

0451199871|5.0|As a teenager, I devoured one Miss Marple mystery after the other, feeling all the time slmildly uneasy for wasting my time on such fluff. But as I grow older and read more and better, and as I'm less influenced by the opinion of the powers that be, Agatha Christie grows in my mind.<br /><br />Miss Marple is one of the most popular literary figures of the 20th Century, and yet she does not have the literary status of Sherlock Holmes. She's not required reading in high school literature courses, and she should be.<br /><br />Agatha Christie created an entire litererary genre, which is not the same as the genre created by Conan Doyle (whose unabridged Sherlock Holmes I'ver read with great pleasure cover to cover three times). I think it's fair to say that in some significant way, her mysteries are more similar to the novels of Jane Austen  than to those of Conan Doyle. Austen and Christie are fundamentally all about the motivations in human psychology. Where Holmes looks at a person's fingernails and deduces she is a musician, Christie watches a couple quarrel, and deduces they are really married, though they pretend otherwise. For her, such evidence is as solid as a footprint, and based on it, conclusions can be drawn.<br /><br />Nevertheless, she does revert to simple forensic evidence before convicting anyone. Her plots are always complicated, but Christie always provides a unique solution. If she did not, she would not be great. In th case of the Body in the Library,  there is as usual all sorts of evidence floating around to confuse you and occupy your mind, but 3 pieces of evidence in the end identify the murderer uniquely.<br /><br />An inattentive reader might finish the book concluding that had Christie modified the plot just a little, the outcome might have been different. Not so. Not any more than Dorothy could have stayed in Oz or Hamlet survived. Christie creates an entire self-consistent and carefully planned microcosm of motivations. However, in this case, the identities are veiled, the dynamo which drives the plot is the who-done-it. In this regard, her genre, of course, is in Doyle's tradition.<br /><br />And I so much like Miss Marple as a literary figure -- the enlightened being, British style. She lives in British society with its commoners and gentry, but is somehow neither. She easily consorts and sympathizes with both. She seeks neither wealth nor fame. She is content, fearless. Her mind and emotions are steady without being cold. And she does not pass judgement on her fellow man, though she stands unflinching in the face of justice -- Nemesis, she is called in one novel. She always knows who did it at the precise moment when all the evidence is in. In this case, that happened when the little boy showed her the clipped nails. Inspector Slack dismisses him as irrelevant. Marple does not. To her all men are created equal. Yet each is unique and understood on his or her own terms. Best of all, Christie accomplishes this through a truly endearing personality -- one with a penchant for tea and herbaceous borders, and a tendency, like most of us, to slip a stitch, though most of hers are literal rather than metaphorical
B000000OQF|5.0|Incredible.  As if you don't already own this!! Well go ahead, get the track listing, write it down in order, and go download it you sillly little freak!<br />One of the best straight up rock and roll albums of all time.  If you bought this in the cassestte era, you already know that the first side is an absolute classic. This album influenced everyone who has heard it.  HEY YOU- YOU HEAR IT NOW...
B0000E1ALR|5.0|It SOUNDS like the early stuff has been remastered...finally,<BR>Greetings remastered about damn time....These CD's sound KILLER....I got 2 for $25 CD/DVD at CC.
B00008MLSH|5.0|I had the chance of being in St Petersbourg in June and to be present at one the performances of Traviata by Verdi conducted by Valery Gergiev. Violetta was Anna Netrebko whom I was listen to for the first time : one of the best Traviata I ever heard not only beautiful to look  at young and charming but also  she has a perfect intonation as well as a perfect pronounce of the Italian language .  She possesses a perfect controll of the voice in the coloratura notes of the first act but though very young she can sing the last act with a very acceptable dramatic voice<BR>I was sure I was listen to one of the best Violetta of the moment , intelligent and with a very good control of her vocal qualities , volume and colours.    I wellcome this marvellous soprano
0805047905|5.0|My son is two, and we were introduced to this book first at the music class. The teacher was singing the verses;\\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What do you see? in the Twinkle, twinkle little star....adaptation\\", and from that point on we had to read/sing it every day. He did not have any interests in the books untill we found this one and he gets it himself and \\"reads/sings it\\". I realy recomend it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is britneys best album, i liked the last one, not so much the first two. This is a really good album, to dance to listen or listen as u drive in your car. I bet ill be hearing this at all the new clubs. Its definetly diffrent, and her single does no justice to the rest of the songs on the album, they are very unique. And even if christina sings better, her songs are over done and frankly poor. Also teh fans who were young and listened to her first album, have grown up as well as britney and they will appreciate this new grown up young woman vibe.
B00008LDPU|5.0|has 9 episodes, but the ones to really watch are &quot;The Reinssance parts 1 and 2&quot; to fully understand the matrix.<br />good stuff in here, and no complaints from me.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|Wash being the first or one of the first songs recorded by PJ according to Stone.  Wash blows most every other bands' first songs recorded.  Pearl Jam the greatest band ever?  Yes, I think so.  The rest of the album rocks as well.
B000092T6M|5.0|Granted this movie wasn't the best keystone in the Robin Hood mythos, but it has style and class.  For those people out there who have a problem with the costumes... are y'all forgetting the movie is set back in MEDIEVAL times?  The costumes reflect the depravity of that era and are pretty realistic in my opinion, would you rather a modern medieval tale with cross-dressing weirdos in tights and elf shoes? How homoerotic.<BR>    As for the acting, I find it pretty accurate for the roles portrayed --poor, ignorent farmers-- they aren't supposed to sound like they've just graduated magna cum laude from Oxford. Costner does wonderfully as the hero as does the rest of the cast, and Alan Rickman is marvelous as the Sheriff of Nottingham. <BR>   And the stuff about Costner's accent (or lack thereof), come on, if that detracted too much from the movie, you watch movies too seriously!  The lack of any good authentic accents doesn't add to the continuity or the mythos as a whole, but for this movie, accents don't detract horribly from it.<BR>   For those who compare this to the Earl Flynn version (think coloful Peter Pan) reffer to the paragraph about \\"homoeroticism.\\"<BR>   Overall, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves isn't the most Oscar Worthy movie of the 90's but it certainly isn't the worst either, and in fact is more fun than most; it definitely is worth your attention and ffits well in the modern day too. I personally love this movie, however, it deservers 4.5 stars instead of the full 5 just based on the fact that Kevin Costner appears naked briefly.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|No, you don't have to be naked to enjoy this stripped down version of the album Sir Paul McCartney detested due to Phil Spector's wall of sound.  Well, I could be, but I don't want to jack the thermostat up to 80 degrees, so...  However, this version of the Fabs' swansong, which has had a can of Spector-Off sprayed on it, is justifiably worth the purchase, as it is quite revelatory on certain tracks.  The only song excluded here is the short ditty &quot;Maggie Mae.&quot;  Instead, we get &quot;Don't Let Me Down,&quot; which was recorded in the same sessions as &quot;Dig A Pony&quot; and &quot;I've Got A Feeling&quot; on 22 January 1969.<br />The &quot;Get Back&quot; here is a single version, with Billy Preston on keyboards.  &quot;Dig A Pony,&quot; sung by John, is more or less the studio version, and is a throwback to their rock roots.<br />The blues &quot;For You Blue&quot; with some different asides from George, though the part where he comments on John's slide guitar playing to Elmore James is intact.<br />And now, we finally get to here Sir Paul's immortal &quot;uncluttered piano ballad.&quot;  There's also some guitar, and organ that have been excavated beneath Spector's wall of sound on &quot;The Long And Winding Road.&quot;  This throat-lump eliciting song will still leave me in pieces, and is even more stripped down compared to the version Sir Paul did for Give My Regards To Broadstreet.<br />No silly voices for John on this rendition of &quot;Two Of Us,&quot; as it starts from the opening guitars.<br />The bluesy rocker featuring Paul and John singing together is left untouched, but boy, can Paul still rip it out Little Richard-style when he yells those &quot;yeah!&quot;  Dual themes can be seen here, from McCartney's title melody meshed along with John's &quot;everybody had a hard year&quot; motif.  Oh, and the clowny &quot;Oh Danny Boy&quot; sung by John is deleted from here.<br />The upbeat &quot;One After 909&quot; is a throwback to their early influences, but that's because it's a remake of a song they recorded back in March 1963 but didn't release on album.<br />&quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; sounds different here, with a different ending and a more live feel to it.<br />&quot;I Me Mine&quot; is stripped of the Spector touch and it's gratifying to hear guitars, as is &quot;Across The Universe,&quot; which spawned two different versions of the single, one being the Spector version, the other being the World Wildlife fund remix found on Past Masters 2.  It's definitely quicker than the Spector, and just hearing the guitar makes quite a difference.<br />Then the tear-inducing title track, where one can finally hear organs, and none of the tape echo of Ringo's high-hat.  As for the guitar solo, it's not as hard-driving as the one on Let It Be, but not as muted as the single version.<br />The bonus disc is a 21 minute plus collection of studio chatter and brief song samples during the Beatles rehearsal in January 1969, which shows the Fabs acting cordial.  The song snippets include early fare such as the unreleased &quot;Because I Know You Love Me So&quot;, Ringo's &quot;Take A Trip To Carolina,&quot; and even twenty-one seconds of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;!  And the booklet contains excerpts from the Let It Be book, mainly dialogue between the Beatles.<br />Apart from hearing Let It Be the way Sir Paul wanted it to be heard, the other novelty is upon hearing them remixed and mastered in the current sound technology and not in the old AAD/ADD/DDD format.<br />As for Sir Paul's argument that this version is better, I agree that the versions of &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; are just as great, but me, I can live with both the Spector album and this one, which is quite a revelation in itself.

B0000DD7LB|3.0|This album sounds pretty good.  The beats are awesome.  It mostly has a dance, club feel to it.  You will want to just get up and dance.  I kind of think this is a good style for her; I think of her as a rising \\"dance diva\\" anyway.<br />I think that this album is more \\"stylized\\" than her others.  What I mean by this is that there isn't as much as an emphasis on having really nice vocals, but rather the sound of the songs in general.  I know most people think that all of Britney's music is like that, but I feel that on previous albums, her voice was showcased a better, or she had a few songs that had really nice vocals.  I think she has a decent, plesant sounding voice, and I wish it was showcased more ofter and consistently, so that more people could see that she does have talent.  There are a couple of songs that kind of showcase her voice, like the beautiful ballad \\"Everytime,\\" which Britney co-wrote the lyrics, and I believe the piano melody, to; it's a song about lost love, and she sounded even better singing it live on SNL.  The other song in which her voice is more noticeable is \\"Shadow,\\" which is another slower song; here, it sounds nice and smooth.  She always sounds nice on slow songs, so I was a bit disappointed to see that there were only 2 of them here.<br />This album has awesome beats; this is the strong point of it.  It mostly has a fun, feel good vibe, like most of her other albums, except this one is more grown-up.  She makes albums that are very good to listen to when you are stressed or just want to have a good time.  My favorite songs are \\"Everytime,\\" \\" Me Against the Music,\\" which is the first single, and \\"Toxic.\\"  \\"Toxic\\" has an fantastic, fast-paced strings beat to it that is extremely catchy; it is definitely single material.<br />Another noticeable thing is that this album is more sexier than her previous ones, which were pretty clean-cut.  There is a song called \\"Touch of My Hand,\\" which is about physical \\"self-love,\\" and \\"Outrageous,\\" which is an R. Kelly penned/produced song, so I think you can imagine what that song is like, compared to his own songs.  But the lyrics on this album aren't very explicit (not like other artists), so it's not too bad.  Some parents may not like it for their young ones, but it should be fine for the high-schoolers.  I must point out that Britney isn't the only young artist to have sexier lyrics; many young stars, such as Justin Timberlake, Beyonce, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Brandy, Monica, Ashanti, JC Chasez, abd Mya also have songs that have kind of sexy/racy lyrics.  So if you don't approve of Britney's songs, you probably won't approve of some of these other artists songs, either.<br />If you are a big Britney fan (especially an older Britney fan), or if you like dancing music, you will like this album, and I suggest you buy it.  I also think this album will attract some people who didn't like Britney at first.<br />Noted writers/producers:<BR>-Britney herself wrote 8 of 12 songs<BR>-RedZone (worked with Mya, B2K, 98 Degrees)<BR>-Moby <BR>-The Matrix (worked w/ Avril, Jason Mraz, Liz Phair, Hilary Duff, Christina)<BR>-R. Kelly<BR>-Cathy Dennis (worked w/ Kylie Minogue)<BR>-Bloodshy & Avant<BR>-Brian Kierulf & Josh Scwartz (Britney co-wrote songs from her last album with them)
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have to say, I really like this DVD!!  It's almost as if I'm actually there, since it's taken from thu UP! tour.<BR>Shania's songs have always been packed with lots of emotion and energy, and you can tell she's having a great time with the fans!!  A MUST HAVE item for any and all Shania Twain fans!!
0385504209|3.0|I don't generally read mysteries, but after much nudging from friends I decided to take up the \\"Da Vinci Code.\\"  It's not the 'Holy Grail' of books that many claim it to be...but it is a fun and easy read.  The symbology and theories explored inside are fascinating.  It's what makes this book.  Unfortunately  the characters do not.  Robert Langdon is written as such a weak and apathetic hero it's hard to really like him.  But if character development takes back seat to easy plotting, this book is probably your bag.  I could have done without all the good guy vs. bad guy, foot chases, gun firing, and plotting to take over the world action, and just stuck with a really good book on  hidden religious symbology and half-cocked conspiracy theories.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This has to be her best cd yet and not just that but all the songs are great and most of them are great dance songs. Absolutely amazing. My two favorite would probably be &quot;Breathe on me&quot; and &quot;Toxic&quot;. The rest are amazing too.
B000002UAX|5.0|As John might say, \\"Maybe you need another fix.\\" Not only is this the greatest Beatles album, it stands as the best rock album ever made. <br />Better than Pepper, more primal than Abbey Road, the White Album is the Walden Pond of music. Everything's in there: straight rock (Back in USSR), beautiful ballads (Julia, I Will), country (Rocky), plaintive wails (Piggies, Yer Blues, I'm So Tired) and madness (Helter Skelter, Revolution No. 9).<br />John's Happiness is a Warm Gun alone is better than any of his songs on Pepper, Let It Be or Abbey Road. Only his work on Rubber Soul rivals. Dear Prudence, Revolution No. 1, Sexie Sadie, Cry Baby Cry, I'm So Tired -- Lennon at his tortured best.<br />Often overlooked is Paul's acoustic brilliance -- Blackbird, Mother Nature's Son, I Will.<br />George shines with Piggies (\\"clutching forks and knives\\"), Long Long Long and Gently Weeps.<br />Forget the talk of \\"condensing it a bit.\\" The White Album is The Magna Carta of rock -- looking through a glass onion.<br />Gordon Ovenshine,<BR>Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania (USA)
B00005JM09|1.0|If I could give this movie a lower rating I'd do it, it deserves more of a 0.16 of a star.  This movie was horrible, not a good ending at all, the casting was fair, but not great.  The graphics were so-so, but not as good as I expected & hoped.  This movie by far (besides Gigli) has to be the biggest disappointment.  I wish it would've flopped in the box office, but like idiots we go see it & leave in shock of the suckiness that took place.  When the movie ended you were like \\"that's it, that sucked.\\"  I don't care if you vote that this review wasn't helpful, you know it was, because deep down inside (if you saw the movie) that it sucked terribly, admit it, & vote that I was helpful...horrible movie, one of the worst...
B0000TB03W|5.0|THe DVD brings across the excitement &amp; power of Shania's live performances ! A must have for any music fan - country or pop ! Shania brings mixure of her new hits &amp; old favorites. Wonderful DVD !
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie was great because it has comedy for anyone's age.  The characters were greatly animated &amp; they picked the right people to do the voices of the characters.  This year there wasn't a whole lot of good movies to come out, but Finding Nemo really delivered &amp; is now a children's classic.  I'm a teenager &amp; I enjoyed it.  5 stars for smart humor, mind-blowing graphics &amp; animation, &amp; a great cast.  You've gotta see this movie
B000001F60|5.0|I just wanted some other Moody Blues fans to know how much this album meant to me. I was born an only child to a single mom back in 1965. My mother passed away in 1998. I was pretty strong at the time, I barely cried during the whole funeral. A few days after the funeral I was playing some of my old records, and Seventh Sojurn was one of the records I was listening to. When I got to Living In a Land of Make Believe, I just started to cry. I couldn,t stop. I must have played the song 10 times that night. But I really listened to the lyrics, It made me feel very good because I knew that eventually I would see my mother again and I know that she,s watching me every day.<BR>It,s a great album all around but the 5 stars are mainly for that song alone. Thank you Moody Blues and thank you Justin for the emotional release you gave me that night....
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has outdone herself, with this new CD. The music is much more mature, and is really great. I recommend it!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania UP dvd is awesome every performane Shania is giving it her all. When she sings the song &quot;She's not just another pretty face&quot; she actually interacts with the audience by getting off stage and sings with some of the fans. A great holiday gift!
B000002MG1|5.0|In my opinon this is easily rem's best work, with Murmur in a close second. Although this album generally does not have a great number of hits (disregareding everybody hurts) this album is probaly rem's most solid effort as a band.  This album is not for everybody and might take a few listens before fully appreciating it. However the patience in listening to this album is worth it. Songs like &quot;Sweetness follows&quot;, &quot;Find the River&quot;, &quot;Nightswimming&quot;, and &quot;Try not to Breathe&quot; are all some of REM's best songs recorded and all are extremely emotional and deep. I highly recomend this album to anyone who appreciates good rock music and music as an art form.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|gone are the ballet / dance-like fight scenes, replaced with loud explosions and sophomoric dialog -'what do you want?' \\"I want the same thing you want - everything.\\" An abrupt cliff hanger ending, continuity errors, and overly long and frankly dull fight sequences.  The characters are more interested in hearing themselves talk than taking action - Morpheus becomes a bore, and Neo becomes Steve Reeves as Superman - only the music is different.<br /><br />You'll want to see this because the first movie was truly an act of genius, but the directors cut of this movie should be about 35 minutes long.
B0000A36J5|5.0|The &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; movies collectively represent the most amazing cinematic feat of at least the past decade.  Period.  The extended edition of &quot;The Two Towers&quot; continues a beautiful tradition that began last year with the extended &quot;Fellowship&quot; release, and is starting to make me wish that Peter Jackson wouldn't have to bother with creating 3-hour theatrical cuts that are quickly (and gladly) forgotten when his more expansive and complete extended cuts get released on DVD!  These 4-disc editions really immerse you in J.R.R. Tolkien's amazing and beautifully-realized world, and make you truly never want to leave!  If only all movies could be made with such vision, love, and dedication as these have been.<br />This Collector's Gift Set for &quot;The Two Towers&quot; is every bit as gorgeous and enjoyable as last year's &quot;Fellowship&quot; Gift Set was, although the bonus &quot;Gollum&quot; DVD is, somewhat sadly, little more than a 30-minute advertisement for Slideshow Weta's line of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; figures and sculptures.  However, the companion book (&quot;Creating Gollum&quot;) is a nice collection of stories from Gollum's cinematic creators, and it features a wonderful evolution of sketches, sculptures, and digital images to illustrate how the little monster was so effectively brought to life in the movie.  It's particularly interesting to get a look at all the Gollums that could have been, as I'd felt that Gollum was perhaps a bit TOO human in &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (an opinion which was probably left over from my vision of him from the old animated &quot;Hobbit&quot; movie).<br />Mainly, I'd like to know if any other fans out there have purchased this set and, like myself, are having serious problems removing the too-cool &quot;Gollum as Smeagol&quot; statue from the packaging without completely destroying said packaging.  Because it really is too nice a set to have to tear apart!  If anyone has found an easier way to accomplish this, please feel free to email me and let me know.  Thanks a ton!
0345457684|3.0|As a fan of both hard boiled crime stories and cyberpunk scifi, this book sounded like it would be my ideal.  Unfortunately, it mixes those genres but does not succeed in them.<br />The book's biggest failure is the lack of common sense applied to the premise.  In this world, any mind can be put in any body, and in fact the protagonist was born Japanese but inhabits a hispanic body throughout the book.  This concept is throught provoking but I felt it was mishandled by Morgan.  For instance, prison terms are served by putting a person's mind in storage while the body is given to someone else to use.  Since the mind has no consciousness, this amounts to punishment by time travel.  Also, characters constantly flip flop as to whether they associate their identity with their bodies or not.  At one point someone will say &quot;all bodies are the same&quot; and at another he will lament not having his original body.  This cognitive dissonance could have been an interesting concept to explore but it seem the book doesn't take the idea too seriously.<br />The writing is also workmanlike.  Morgan indulges himself is boring, cliched dream sequences throughout the book.  His attempts to imitate the classic hard boiled allegories manage to seem out of place primarily because they occur too infrequently.  That being said, the pacing is quite good and the book is a page turner.  Thought the story was ultimately overblown, I did manage to care enough to finish the book.<br />I think Morgan shows promise.  For his next book, he could use a better editor to reel in some of his sillier ideas.  But I will keep an eye on his work in the future.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has done it again! She took some time and has put forth a brand new album that tops all her others (even though I love them all) and is flat out amazing! She cowrote most of the songs on the album and it's a true reflection of hat an amazing artist she is. Every track on the CD rocks.<BR>1)Me Against The Music - 10/10 - A fabulous cross between generations with Madonna and Britney on the same track. It's a hot song and I love it.<br />2)Boom Boom - 10/10 - Everyone seems to hate this song, but I flat out love it! I think it's so much fun and just a great song to listen to when getting ready to go out.<br />3)Showdown - 10/10 - A really fun song that seems to draw it's influence from Madonna's erotica album. LOVE IT!<br />4)Breath On Me - 9/10 - Not a big fan of the trance influenced music but I do like this song. It's SO hot!<br />5)Early Mornin - 8/10 - Least favorite track. It's just kinda blah in comparrison to the rest of the album and its kinda chaotic. But I must admitt it's fun to hear Britney's lyrics and it DOES make me feel like Im hung over.<br />6)Toxic - 10/10 - GREAT track!!! I LOVE IT!!!! My favorite track on the CD!<br />7)Outrageous - 9/10 - Not a big R. Kelly fan but it's a lot of fun and I just wanna dance around when I hear this track.<br />8)Touch Of My Hand - 10/10 - The asian influence thing is a major no no ... but who can not love a song about Britney masturbating?! And plus it a good song with a great hook. Very mellow.<br />9)The Hook Up - 9/10 - This song makes me wanna do the Harlem shake! Love it but it's not my favorite ... it's just rather similar to other tracks on the album. And I hate the other people on the track.<br />10)Shadow - 10/10 - A very pretty song that has an old school classical ballad feel to it. It's a great song and I love it.<br />11)Brave New Girl - 10/10 - Love this song. Britney raps on it ... 'nuff said.<br />12)Everytime - 10/10 - My Favorite Song on the album. It brakes my heart and it is just abeautiful ballad about love lost.<br />13)Me Against The Music (remix) - 9/10 - A fun song, but why did we need another mix of this song? I would have preferred one of the other songs that are going to be on her Europe and Austrailian versions.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Quite frankly, it sounds similar to the previous album and I'm not sure if writing raunchy lyrics means she has become a more mature song writer. Not a good buy.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears was always great to look at and her performances were so extravagant, you couldn't help but look (even though they're lip synched).  On her first three albums, the music was just okay.  The same bubble-gum production ruled throughout those records, despite trying to make it sound different.  Now, with In The Zone, Britney has decided to ditch the producers of the past and buff up her sound.  The result is a groovy and deep resonance that makes you marvel at just how good Britney can sound.  She never had a great voice, but this record uses it in the best possible context and it sounds wonderful.  <br />The 12 songs (and one remix) on this record have the privilege of sounding different from one another.  By now you've all heard the first singls, \\"Me Against The Music\\" featuring the diva Britney aspires to be, Madonna.  But that track is far from representative of the rest of the album.  The sultry \\"Breathe On Me\\", which might be a single, is simply brilliant.  It sounds slightly reminiscent of Kylie Minogue ... .  \\"Early Mornin'\\" is another great track which should be a single.  This one is produced by Moby (and it's obvious).  Also check out the controversial \\"Touch Of My Hand\\", the sweet \\"Everytime\\", the erratic \\"Toxic\\", and the guilty-pleasure Hilary Duff-like \\"Brave New Girl\\".  This album unfortunately features the worst Britney song ever, the second single and track, \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" featuring the Yin Yang Twins.  The guest artists sound so horrible it makes you wince, which is a shame since Brit's part is actually kinda catchy.  <br />But aside from that song, this is a very good record and a breakthrough for Britney herself.  I'm sure it'll be a hit record, hopefully selling more than the third album, Britney.  Sure, the performances will still be lip synched, but Brit has proved she has staying power and will be entertaining us for a while!
B00005JM0B|5.0|I Saw and Have TERMINATOR and T2, and I also have the DVD's of Both ,Including the First release of the Special Edition ( Actually 2 copies, one unopened in a Metal Case, and the one I use in a Silver Cardboard Pack).<BR>I thoroughly Enjoyed T3.<BR>It's all Set up for a Franchise, and with any Luck Either Arnold, or someone else ( Please God not the &quot;Rock&quot;) Will Carry on the Series.<br />Hopefully the Script and Director for T4 will be better, but... It's a Blast, and the Sergeant Candy scene is full on funny.<br />No Deep Meaning, just a Standard set of Blow em up, shoot em out fun.

B0000TB050|4.0|I had already seen U2's CBS special entitled 'U2's beautiful day' that aired more than a year ago and knew how special this concert was to U2 fans and to the band. There was an incredible energy there that evening and U2 seemed to love every minute of it. Indeed, I have been hoping for this release since seeing that special. I even lobbied for its release with Bono when I ran into him in NYC this past spring. Usually U2 can do no wrong in my eyes. I guess I expected too much from the world's greatest band.<br />BOTTOM LINE:<BR>If you love U2, you'll like this DVD and it's worth purchasing. There are some precious moments, like when Bono is talking about their families' respective financial contributions when they were starting out 20 years earlier. This DVD adds some tracks missing from the Boston DVD: One, Mysterious ways, and Pride, all of which were sorely missed from that production. Where's the Behind the scenes/Making of documentary? Bizarre. However, I still get goose bumps whenever I watch `Where the Streets Have No Name' on this DVD, so it passes that test.<br />THE DVD:<BR>**16:9 gritty video with a substandard set of 5.1 mixes-- the DTS is not any better than the DD, but they're both below the standard previously set by the Boston DVD, which I thought was a lot better. However, Bono's vocals are incredibly good and come through very clearly. There are not enough crowd microphones-- you can barely here them at some key times. I can't even put my finger on exactly what's wrong with the audio, it just doesn't carry enough of the emotion that there was that night.<BR>**NO documentary of this show, which I found amazingly odd-- the CBS special had some touching moments of Bono talking about his father who had just passed away. I find it very strange that there's nothing about U2 returning to Slane.<BR>**Annoying menus that seem slapped together at the last minute.<br />OVERALL:<BR>Not a polished U2 production- better than Popmart, but certainly not as good asthe Boston DVD. I wish the audio was more engaging. Odd omissions (documentary about THIS concert and not the Unforgettable Fire) and I'll never understand why mysterious ways is a separate track, regardless of how it 'fit in.'<br />------------------------------------------------------------<BR>From U2.com:<br />U2 Go Home is presented in PCM Stereo, DTS and Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound. Aspect ratio 16:9.<br />Here's the tracklisting:<br />Performance from Slane, 1st September , 2001<br />* Elevation<BR>* Beautiful Day<BR>* Until The End Of The World<BR>* New Year's Day<BR>* Out Of Control<BR>* Sunday Bloody Sunday<BR>* Wake Up Dead Man<BR>* Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of<BR>* Kite<BR>* Angel Of Harlem<BR>* Desire<BR>* Staring At The Sun<BR>* All I Want Is You<BR>* Where The Streets Have No Name<BR>* Pride (In The Name Of Love)<BR>* Bullet The Blue Sky<BR>* With Or Without You<BR>* One<BR>* Walk On<br />Bonus track: Mysterious Ways
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I've been a Sarah Mclachlan fan for a while now, but I did not realize how much I missed her music until I purchased &quot;Afterglow.&quot;  I fell in love instantly with &quot;Fallen&quot; but tracks like &quot;World On Fire,&quot; &quot;Train Wreck,&quot; &quot;Time,&quot; &quot;Dirty Little Secret,&quot; etc. just makes me have so much more respect for her.  She is extremely talented.  Her voice is so healing and her piano playing is so beautiful.  Her maturity shows in this new album, and it only compliments the rest of her music. I literally found myself playing this CD over and over during a six hour car ride.  I just kept discovering wonderful things about it. It's worth buying!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I received my copy of the DVD in the mail today. and was happy to find that they released this DVD uncut! I was not able to attend the Chicago concert, but did see Shania on October 21st in Indianapolis. Every time I see her perform her show gets better and she gets more beautiful.  After the mailman delivered my copy of the DVD today I watched it from beginning to end twice.  It was a great show and worth every penny of the purchase price.  I would recommend it to everyone.  If your not a Shania fan before you see the DVD you will be after seeing it.  Without a doubt she is the most gorgeous, talented woman in music today.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This album is a dream come true for die-hard Pearl Jam fans, mostly due to the pristine recordings of the previously unreleased material.  The collection is a plus for casual fans on three counts.<br />1.  Songs like Yellow Ledbetter, Footsteps, Wash, and Hard To Imagine are very popular B-sides and soundtrack songs that will satisfy their craving for classic Pearl Jam within the collection of new stuff and rarities.<br />2. The order of tunes on here makes for a seamless collection that crosses Pearl Jam's history chronologically and stylistically.  This album sounds like it could have been entirely recorded in the last year if one did not know all the songs.  With some of the more unorthodox cuts, it plays like PJ's equivalent to &quot;The White Album.&quot;<br />3. The insight provided by band members is fantastic and adds to the experience.<br />I do miss Leatherman and Crazy Mary, and maybe State of Love and Trust and Breath, but those two songs fit well within the Singles soundtrack, and there is plenty of good music on that CD to merit its purchase.  Overall, Lost Dogs is excellent for all rock music lovers that can look past Pearl Jam's first three albums.
B00008PX8P|5.0|What can I say that over 300 people have now already said.  This is excellent.  Works Great In Surround Sound, and is a Must have with the CD triple \\"HOW THE WEST WAS WON\\"... Get one of them, you need the other.  Just wall to wall Brilliance.  The Very Fact that Jimmy Page was behind this certifies the quality.  Unsurpassable in it's genre, and a great Piece to buy along with THE SONG REMAINS THE SAME.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I personally think its the best yet from Britney.  I really didnt care for her music before but the music is just awesome
B0000BWVCM|4.0|When I see a movie I might buy listed on Amazon, and the reviews are mostly great like this, I go in search of the bad reviews to see what the minority thought. What I generally found with the bad reviews of X2 here are people who apparently think Brian Singer should have just scanned the comic and done a slide show or something. Look people, read the comics and stay away from movies.<br />They give it only one star because Iceman's skin didn't *ice* over, because Storm's eyes weren't blue, because in their minds Cyclops wasn't given enough screen time. Some of them gave it one star because they think they see a parallel to Star Trek 2. Grow up people. I submit most of this plankton decided that X2 stunk well before they saw it. These are people who wanted it to stink, and want you to believe them. So sad.<br />My personal favorite is from a moron who said, \\"We know Pyro is bad so can't we just get on with it so we can enjoy a Pyro/Iceman fight?\\" <br />Hey dummy, YOU know this, some us had better things to do growing up than read comics and watch cartoons. It's a continuous franchise, and you want the filmmakers to encapsulate all the traits and qualities of the characters in one movie, rather than watch them evolve into what you generally \\"know\\" about the character over time.<br />Here's the deal: since as of this review the DVD is not out yet, I recommend that those of you who want the movie to be a carbon copy of the comic book, save the money you'd spend on this to perhaps take a date (if you can get one) out to a movie you might both enjoy. I read the bad reviews of X2 and all I see is the comic book guy from The Simpsons, refusing to like a quality show, with a quality story and cast shot by a quality director. This movie could have been a flawless classic, and they'd all hate it anyway simply because it wasn't a direct recreation of a comic or just because they are outcasts raging against anything popular, unlike them. It's classic, bitter-geek B.S. Go aheadand click on how this doesn't help... I didn't write this for you dummies. I wrote it for anyone considering putting any stock into your negative, self-important comments, not that they actually will, considering all the people who disagree with you. <br />X2 is a good continuation of the first X-Men movie, well paced and well made. The opening sequence with Nightcrawler was an amazing way to start the film. I think he has become my favorite mutant not only with his abilities but with his take on life as a mutant.. His character showed how far special effects have come in filmmaking. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where the special effects were so seamless. From his transportation abilities to Mystiques shape-shifting between 4 or 5 characters in the span of a few seconds, everything looked and felt as though it was actually happening. <br />One of the loudest pops the movie got was for a small character who could walk through walls, and her part was only 30 seconds long. The audience was completely taking in by everything that was happening, and having special effects that made everything flow smoothly was a big factor in that. <br />Other stories were continued or added, such as the love triangle with Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine, as well as seeing Iceman's relationship with his family, and his ongoing love affair with Rogue. And then of course *pyro* the one mutant who goes over to the bad guys, and the one mutant who doesn't make it out alive, but is seeming to metamorphose into a much bigger character. <br />There were times however where the movie did slow down, which normally isn't bad, but when you have a movie with so much amazing action, any time it slows down, it feels like its crawling. In a normal movie it might feel like it flowed right along, but when you're going 100mph and you slow to 25mph, it hits you harder than if you're cruising along at 50mph the entire time.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's Newest Dvd &quot;Shania Twain - Up (Live in Chicago)<BR>DVD ~ Shania Twain&quot; has to be the dvd of the year!!!

B0000E6I1J|5.0|When one hears to these amazing tracks it brings joy and saddess to the listener. Joy at hearing this wonderful gift the performers give to there friend George, and saddess for the reminder of what the world lost all too soon. The performers which include Paul McCartney, Billy Preston, Tom Petty and the <BR>Heartbreakers and Eric Clapton, allow through their preformances the true star of the night to shine,George's remarkable work. Probably the most moving of the performances come from Jeff Lynne,George's partner in crime in the latter years of his career.In Lynne's singing of &quot;Give Me Peace on Earth&quot; and &quot;I Want to Tell You&quot; you hear the love and the loss Lynne feels over the loss of his friend.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I just got this CD today and I really like it. It's a very upbeat CD with a lot of different sounds. Britney's not the best singer in the world, but she's an awesome performer &amp; I give her credit for that. Track #9 (The Hook Up) is easily my favorite.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|Absolutely Best at the Highest possible Volume on a Surround sound system.  AC/DC  Deliver for the fans, and they deliver consistently.  I doubt very much that the DVD is Overdubbed, since the Sound is the Same as Every other AC/DC  Release. But even if it is overdubbed, WHAT THE HELL...  This is a Great Show, and the Goods are delivered.  Angus Plays brilliantly, and works the crowd superbly. As for the alleged disparity between what you see and what you hear... Angus is 5\\"2, so his playing of the Gibson SG he uses is deceptive, it looks one way when physically he is producing the sound by what his body does and his left hand technique. Hard to explain, but what you see is not always what you hear.  The other thing that I thought any Movie viewer would know, is that In Making a Concert Film, a Second , third, or whatever, camera is used for \\"Inserts\\", and this is matched as best as can be done... which does not always work; this does not mean that the Track is overdubbed, merely that the Line editor, and the Final Edit did not match.    Anyway, this is Superb.    Get NO BULL: LIVE IN MADRID, and The DVD of AC/DC  Live in Munich... Extremely Brilliant !!!!!!!!  This is a real Step up from the Original VHS  Release.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|One of the things that disappoint me about it is that we have already heard samples of the \\"stripped down\\" sound on Anthology 3. I guess I was expecting to hear new unreleased material. I still give it five stars because its a great album and the sound is superior. The second disc of studio chatter could have been longer. All in all, its still the Beatles, the greatest rock band of all time. I wish I can give it ten stars!
0609610570|1.0|Great 1950's style management approach, but who cares about going back to the 1950's. A poor example of caring about others.
B0000TB03W|5.0|this is a great dvd for all shania fans.i have all of shanias albums and all the dvds she has out now and this one is great.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I bought this CD because of Me Against the Music. Majority of the songs are horrible. There are a few good ones, like Outrageous and Everytime but apart from those, not a hype CD! The beat in toxic is ok, but I can see it getting annoying after a while. Hopefully she'll come out with a better CD next year or she'll have to do something really outrageous to get her name out there..
B0000TB03W|5.0|WOW! What can I say? Shania is the world's greatest performer. Today's younger &quot;divas&quot; should take some notes because Shania has become this dyanmic performer and still kept it clean! Now for all of those who were not able to see her perform live, like me, we have this DVD to enjoy Shania's music live! It also includes the video for her new single, &quot;She's Not Just A Pretty Face&quot;.  Shania, much props to you girl! Keep on &quot;keeping it real&quot;! Buy this DVD.....it is definitely worth it!
B00009P1O2|5.0|There is not much I can say about how Great this Double Disc DVD is for a view of QUEEN.  All I would really note is that if you Loved The Previous edited version of the Concert, this DVD will be a god-send.  About all I will say is that, as far as the Medley goes, it makes sense, since QUEEN have done Medley's since 73 at least, and of other people's material( the medley in the first release of this concert video was chopped to hell, and this DVD restores the full medley).  As for the choice of material... You have to realise that QUEEN shines as a Studio Band in the best sense, but to select the songs to play to a huge audience, you have to have material that works in that Larger Venue. QUEEN selected the Perfect Material , and Freddy \\"Sold\\" the Music to the people.  And Remember, if you have Surround Sound, this DVD is Brilliant, as is the DVD of the Best of Volume 1 re-release, with the complete edits, different to the way the Torpedo Twins botched up the edits of previous tapes.     If you want a Comparison concert, Check out the Must Buy  \\"WE WILL ROCK YOU\\"  DVD:  Brians  Solo on this item is great in Surround sound, absolute killer.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I never realized it more fully than now -- having heard Whitney's Christmas album -- that Whitney's voice is 'potent'.  I don't just mean that she can hit unearthly notes, but that, the material covered didn't mean so much Christmas as they did WHITNEY, to me.  I don't mean this in any negative way, just that Christmas here seemed to take second place, after her voice.  It was great, make no mistake about it, to hear these festive songs now, but really, Whitney fans know what they like best about Whitney's songs and it's her voice!  To use a cliche, Whitney claims these songs as her own by singing them.<br />I'm still amazed, and wowed, and absolutely blown away by the wonderful sounds of this recording.  Those who've heard it will know what I'm talking about, THE REINDEERS FLOOOOO, AND OUTTA SIGHT WHITNEY MADE THEM FLY!!!  AH!!!  Can you believe this woman!  Of course, she does more than belt.  You will smile warmly when you hear that last note in I'll Be Home For Christmas.  That is priceless.<br />The only bad thing is that there weren't MORE SONGS!  I would love to hear Whitney sing Silverbells and Blue Christmas.  Still, this would've made me very happy if I'd got it in my stocking, but I couldn't wait to get it as you can tell.  I guess all's I can do now is get more copies of this for my friends!
B0000CABBW|2.0|The girl, forbidden from taking the role of chief because she is female, eventually triumphs over the prejudice of her grandfather.<br />Yay. <br />We saw it coming. We saw her triumph in the voice over at the beginning. <br />This little girl is the Melanie Wilkes of this movie, who never does ANYTHING wrong.  Show me a girl as brutally verbally and emotionally abused as this one, and you can bet she won't be thorougly motivated and angelic. <br />The movie cuts her every break--when the boys practice martial arts, the director allows/makes them look silly.  She, of course, is just perfect.<br />And doesn't it bother any of the 5 star reviewers that the grandfather never shows remorse, let alone atonement, for his years of abusing his wife and granddaughter?   Or that the wife leaves the abusive man for a little while, pretty much \\"to show him,\\" never making any real changes in the relationship?<br />At least Bend it Like Beckham KNEW it was superficial. At least Billy Elliott showed the characters thinking about their choices.<br />Bleah. I give it two stars for at least being a movie about a female that doesn't unclothe her.   Thanks for trying, at least, to be progressive.
0385484518|5.0|I felt that have change the way i look at life now. I DON'T KNOW WHY MORRIE CAN TALK DYING AND LIFE SO GOOD. TO CHANGE THE SOMEONE FEEL ABOUT LIFE.
B00005OM4N|1.0|This album is so awful it doesnt even deserve &quot;one&quot; star! I only gave it one because, see... well, it just saddens me that a girl who thinks she looks good thinks that means she has 'what it takes' to be a singer! ugh...I don't think so girly! and if you've heard her voice when singing you'll know what I mean!<BR>No, no, no, the real reason I only gave her one star is really because I couldn't give her a zero! You know, everytime I hear one of her songs, whether it be on the radio or on television, I get sick to my stomach. I remember one time I almost nearly hurled! I kid you not! Please don't waste your money on this! It'll be your biggest regret!
B0000DYJM6|5.0|I cant believe a band can release an album of rare and unreleased songs that is this good. This has to be the best band ever. You get a taste of what PJ is all about, with Eddie giving amazing singing. Best songs not counting the obvious ones like YELLOW LEDBETTER, are Alone, Drifting, Brother, Fatal, but all songs have their touch, all very different from one another. I recommend this album to all music fans, as I am sure everyone will be completely amazed with this fantastic album. go buy it now.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD it's great she does an awesome concert i think this is the best DVD i've seen in a long time there are more song that didn't make the TV specail and it's just Great to see Shania out with a new DVD go out and buy it you won't be disappointed!! again it's just awesome!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Listening to In the Zone, it is very apparent that Britney Spears has definitely progressed in her music and her image. This album is a lot less pop and a lot more funky and grown up. Vocally, I think this is her best album also, with awesome tracks like &quot;Everytime&quot; and &quot;Toxic&quot;. Even if you don't like Britney Spears, I think you should check this cd out because it is so different from her previous albums.
076790592X|5.0|I FEEL THAT THIS STORY HAVE CHANGE THE WAY OF LIFE TO ME NOW. Morrie is very good person. He  strong about everything in his life because of his experience in life.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard, Billy and Crew have done it again. I was kind of apprehensive to hear this album, due to Jordie's and James' contributions, but the sound is pure and amazing. <BR>There are many people who try to relate this band to Tool. They dont like it on account of the fact that &quot;Its just not Tool.&quot;... ITS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE! This is Maynard's OTHER band, ASIDE from Tool. And he's proved that a &quot;side project&quot; (although Maynard despises that phrase for this band) can and will work when you've got nothing short of intelligence and brilliance at the helm.<BR>The Thirteenth Step opens with the amazingly angry and groovy track, &quot;The Package&quot; and takes you through a journey of desperation, truth, and anger all the way until the closing track, &quot;Gravity.&quot; It even has a moment of humor with the whimsical &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me,&quot; originally a QOTSA song. The song is lush and full with strings and elegant instrumentation.<BR>Some key tracks on this disc are &quot;Weak and Powerless,&quot; the first single from the disc that brings tears to your eyes even with the opening bass riff; &quot;Pet,&quot; a rocking track that any single parent in a custody battle can relate to; and &quot;Blue,&quot; another rocker-- this time on the issue of an overdose.<BR>My favorite track on this album would have to be &quot;The Noose,&quot; a very slow-starting song that brings you to an emotional climax by the end. In any case, there's not a bad song on the CD. I especially love Maynard's vocals- I've never heard something so soothing in my life. Its obvious he's vocalizing more on this CD. His voice shines through, as on the other one I think he kind of tries to hide it.<BR>Some songs on Mer De Noms (although its a great album all around) seem forced and less fluent, but great nonetheless. This disc, however, flows all the way through. I don't think the tracklisting could have been arranged any better. If you're a fan of any type of intelligent music at all, pick this album up. You will NOT regret it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|WOW Britney you rock. This cd has everything, pop, rock, a little rap, regge, sole and everything you could think of. Its such a good cd. I bought it when i came home from school that tusday and i havent stoped listening to it. Som eof the best songs are.....<BR>1) Me Against The Music- Really good fun song.

B0000TB050|5.0|I liked the Elevation DVD from Boston a lot, but this one from Slane Castle had a much more concert-like feel. The sound is better, and the set list is better too. It includes U2 staples &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Pride&quot; which were taken out of the Boston DVD. You definitely feel the energy from the 80,000 fans that were at the Slane show. I like the interactive features on the DVD too. The only songs that I would've liked to see the band do are &quot;Stay(Faraway, So Close)&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;, but other than that, it's a great way to spend two hours. My favorite songs on this DVD are &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, &quot;All I Want is You&quot;, &quot;Streets&quot;, &quot;With or Without You&quot; and &quot;One&quot;. I think over all this DVD is better than Boston's, though I liked &quot;Streets&quot; from that one better, and &quot;With or Without You&quot; is not as good as it is in Rattle and Hum (but not many performances are). I also think perhaps the band could've changed the set list even more from the Boston shows. Besides &quot;Stay&quot; and &quot;Bad&quot;, they could have included more songs from Pop. I expected this DVD to be very similiar to Boston, but it's got it's own feel to it. I'd definitely recommend it to all U2 fans.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|~First and formost the album is great!  I love the album, and my favortie songs on the album would have to be \\"Me against the Music\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Toxic\\", and \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\"<BR>They are all great song, but these are the tracks that stand out the most and are really good.<br />1. Me against the Music - 10/10 Best song on the album, and the video is great!.<BR>2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - 10/10 Great hip-hop/rap song, and the colaboration.<BR>3. Shadow - 9/10 This is a good song, i love the beat, seems familiar.<BR>4. Breathe On Me - 10/10 You have to love this song, i dont know why, but i love this song.<BR>5. Early Mornin' - 8/10 This is a good song, and it's produced by Moby and i love the chorus which i don't know who sings it?<BR>6. Toxic - 10/10 This is my favorite song and the beat is great.<BR>7. Outrageous - 8/10 This song did'nt catch my attention, i wasn't suprised of the lyrics, and the song was produced by R.Kelly.<BR>8. Touch of my Hand - 10/10 I like this song, but it's more... sexual.<BR>9. The Hook-Up - 8/10 This song isn't all that goog, but then at the same time it's a feel good song.<BR>10. Showdown - 6/10 This song is too slow, i think of it as \\"Touch of my Hand\\".<BR>11. Brave New Girl - 9/10 This song is more of the \\"Britney\\" type of record more like Legally Blond.<BR>12. Every Time - 10/10 I love this song, it's about Justin, i love that she wrote it about him, it's really touching, and she wrote it in 2002 in Jermany.<BR>13. Me against the Music (remix) - 10/10 Let me tell you the truth...this version is better than the original, way better and longer, trust me, you'll love it.<br />overall rating 10/10<br />And also go get the album, you wont regret it, the album is really good.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|There's nothing wrong with the songs on this CD.  It's a good  Hits album- as strong as Greatest Hits Vol. 1 (it repeats 10 songs from that CD), and a worthwhile purchase for Michael  Jackson beginners.  But the concept has some flaws.  Number Ones?  Glancing over the US and UK charts, these songs didn't go #1 in either Country: Thriller, Smooth Criminal, You Rock My World, Break Of Dawn. The version of Ben on this CD is a live cut from a 1981 Jacksons live LP (couldn't they license the original?, which was a #1).  Earth Song went to #1 in the UK.  As for the above 4, it's a mystery as the where they went to the top.  There are no liner notes or chart information. Oddly, the title track to Michael's 1997 remix CD, Blood On The Dance Floor, which went to #1 in the UK doesn't get a nod here.  Nor does Say Say Say, the duet with Paul McCartney. One note: the version of Don't Stop is the DJ 3:55 version-not the LP version.  All of this may sound like nitpicking.  But if you're gonna market a CD called Number Ones, then be prepared to back up your facts.  This is a good Hits CD.  If you're new to Michael Jackson and just want the goods, then this or Greatest Hits Vol. 1 will do.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Any TRUE Beatles fan should purchase this album,from a historical standpoint. In my opinion the release is similar in comparison to the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album produced by Phil Spector aside from these obvious highlights:<BR>1. The sound quality is phenomenal. Not buried in &quot;the wall of sound&quot;. Crisp! This is always a plus, even more so for this release. (Spector would have loved if everything stayed MONO!)<BR>2. The Long And Winding Road is the key track here! No orchestra! This is the version that was in the film, Beatles fans have preffered this version for years and finally get it on CD! This track alone is worth getting the album!<BR>3. Across The Universe get's second place! The Spector version was always too much reverb. The original on past masters Vol. 2 is so-so,and the one on Anthology 2 is better. But this version I consider best!<BR>4. The inclusion of Don't Let Me Down is a plus,but even this different version is compairable to the original.<BR>Other than the sound-quality, that about sums up this release for me. In my opinion, a double-disc set of the actual soundtrack of the film would have been a lot more interesting! The amount of material The Beatles recorded during this era (regardless of it's quality that I'm sure could have been salvaged in this day and age,they did it with &quot;Live At the BBC&quot; and how many &quot;Anthology&quot; tracks!)should have seen the light of day on an official release instead of &quot;slightly-remixed&quot; tracks we've had for years! All in all,the highlights I mentioned are worth it!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania absolutely rocks on this dvd. If you were lucky to see her concert, it's a great way to re-live the incredible show. It's also great for everyone else to see what a great show Shania<BR>puts on. This dvd is great!
B00009P1MP|5.0|I love this album and thought Don McLean was one of the 70's best singer/songwriters. &quot;American Pie&quot; is a classic and so is &quot;Vincent&quot;. The sound quality of this cd is excellent since it's been remastered. It also has bonus tracks that my old 1971 album never had. Buy it and enjoy!
B00005JKN9|1.0|I agree with whoever said that the entire purpose of this big-budget three-hour movie was to reassure white boys that they can be gangsters, too, and in fact the entire gang culture in New York originated with them. What an honor...NOT! BIG friggin' deal! I am NOT impressed. Since Eminem exploded onto the music scene, it's suddenly cool to be immoral gutter trash.<br />This historically inaccurate, boring, plotless, chaotic MESS is THE MOST OVERHYPED movie of all time! Save your time and money!
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido's &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is one of the best CDs I've bought this year. The songs are atmospheric and almost trippy, and seem to blend together into a cohesive whole. I was pleasantly surprised by the high production values and the sophisticated lyrics, which seemed to be missing from her previous album. The best cuts include &quot;Life for Rent&quot; and &quot;Stoned&quot;. <br />Highly recommended for pop rock fans. Do yourself a favor and skip over Sarah McLachlan's, and buy this instead.
B00000DG1R|3.0|First let me say that this IS a great compilation. Especially when compaired to Duran's previous best of package &quot;Decade&quot;. Due in part to additional tracks from the post-decade era and the inclusion of &quot;New Moon On Monday&quot;(a hit single).<BR>My confusion is based on prior to it's release,the UK issued store promos of the upcoming release that featured two key tracks,not included on the eventual Cd. They were &quot;My Own Way&quot; (Single Version) and &quot;Careless Memories&quot; (Single Version)! Why were these tracks scrapped in favor of the replacement tracks &quot;Electric Barbarella&quot; and &quot;Serious&quot;??? which in my opinion are hardly Greatest, and NOTHING compaired to the before mentioned tracks!<BR>My opinion is if you are a occasional Duran fan,get this CD. It would make a great edition to your collection. If you are a REAL DURAN fan,try and track down that promo version I mentioned. It's more up your alley. But to DIE-HARD DURAN fans,you've gotta get the Singles Box 1981-1985!!
B00005JM0B|2.0|What a major disappointment. A big time Terminator fan, I couldn't wait to buy this DVD. I even marked the date on my calendar. Now I'm sorry that I purchased it at all. The acting all around is atrocious, the dialogue lame. Storyline is passable with some ( emphasize very few) memorable effects although no where near T2's groundbreaking effects. To think that they had 10 years to develop this property. Maybe it's that Cameron's influence is missing but this is one vehicle where Arnold should never have come back.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is a must have for all country music fans.  Shania is one of the best performers and the live footage is excellent.  Next best thing to being there for the taping.  I will be getting a few for my friends/family for Christmas.  EXCELLENT*****
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Just gave it a first listen....<br />Incredibly warm-sounding - ah, analog.<br />Let me state that I was just a lad when my <BR>folks took me to a drive-in (never heard of 'em, eh?) to see Let It Be.<BR>'The Long &amp; Winding Road' stayed in my head, intoxicatingly for days - <BR>BEGGED my Mom to take me to EJ Korvettes to get it...<BR>I've loved the LIB album with the lush orchestration for all of these years,<BR>but, it's that haunting melody that hooked me.<br />However...some stand-outs for me:<br />'Across The Universe' is stunning.<BR>Just beautiful - they've added reverb to the <BR>Jai Guru Deva's at the end and they are CHILLING.<BR>Woth the price JUST for this.<br />'Let It Be' the song, is equally as beautiful to these ears.<BR>The backing vocals are wet with delicious reverb<BR>and Preston's Hammond forms a gorgeous<BR>symphony with sonic backdrop with them.<br />'I've Got A Feeling' is a different take altogether. <BR>The band totally rocks out on this, <BR>and Paul's lead vocal is raw and passionate,<BR>as it was on the 'other one', <BR>but this take is way cooler.<br />It's great to have 'Don't Let Me Down', <BR>(from which Bon Jovi and Co. totally lifted the <BR>verse melody for his, 'I'll Be There For You.')<BR>BUT, the version on the 'other' LIB is better, <BR>I must say.<br />The Fly On The Wall dialogue CD is really cool.<BR>Though I own TONS of boots, and have heard a lot of this before, what's assembled is so interesting, and clean as hell.<BR>Listening to John &amp; Paul jammin' out together on this disc, makes me think of Paul's tune from Flaming Pie , 'Here Today.&quot;<BR>(Many folks were made hip to this tune from Paul's last incredible tour...<BR>it being a total tear-jerker when he perfromed it, along with George's, 'Something' on a ukulele George gave him!)<br />&quot;What about the time we met? <BR>Well I suppose that you could say that<BR>we were playing hard to get, <BR>Didn't understand a thing<BR>But we could always sing.&quot; <br/>All in all, it's really wonderful to have this CD in my collection, <BR>as opposed to yesterday when I did not. (whoa, profound.)<BR>Yeah, I know these 4 or 5 dudes at Abbey Road <BR>put it together without any input <BR>from Paul and Ringo and George Martin, <BR>but it's a variation on a theme - <BR>another part of a sonic palette from my Heroes.<br />I dig this pony.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears is the most talked about person on earth. She practically is the unofficial ruler of everyone, no matter how far you try to go away from her, she always find you. On her fourth album, Britney finds herself, a hard partying, sexy vamp, with her barely there innocense scatter throughout the record. Britney proves that there is a reason why everyone is infatuated with her. The album is great, very different which is very hard to find these days with people like Beyonce' and 3 Doors Down dominating radio. Get this album now, you will not be dissapointed. Here is a track by track review to simplify things. (using 5 stars as the highest; 1 as the lowest)<br />1.Me Against the Music (Ft.Madonna) - ***** - This song is one of the best of 2003, it is funky and different from what you find everywhere else.<br />2.(I've Got That)Boom Boom (Ft.Ying Yang Twins)- ***** - This is very good! The banjo used in the hip-hop beats is extrmely creative. The Ying Yang Twins were a good choice to record a track with.<br />3.Showdown - ***** - One of her most mature tracks yet, includes seductive vocals and lyrics and a great background beat.<br />4.Breathe On Me - ***** - The most seductive track on the album. Thumping background beat, sexy vocals, and heaving breathing make this track great!<br />5.Early Morning - ***** - This is the Moby produced track. Britney lures you in with fresh vocals and a odd flute playing background.<br />6.Toxic - ***** - One of the best dance tracks. Britney uses Cathy Dennis to provide the music, which consists of fast dance beats and the surf guitar.<br />7.Outrageous - ***** - Slick hip-hop song with R.Kelly behind the production. Britney sings awesome, this would be a surefire hit!<br />8.Touch of My Hand - ***** - Best track on the album. The most erotic song touches upon a subjact not talked about most of the time. Britney is daring with a european sounding background and some of her best vocals on the album.<br />9.The Hook-Up - **** 1/2 - Easily the worst song, but it is still great! Britney has a reggae beat, almost something Sean Paul would use. This song is very out of place and Britney's vocals are overproduced at points.<br />10.Shadow - **** 1/2 - The Matrix are some of today's top producers and when I heard they did a Britney song I was suprised. However the song isn't great, it is a normal pop ballad. This is the \\"poppiest\\" song on the album.<br />11.Brave New Girl - ***** - The second best track. Britney sings in a slow rap almost with an extremely catchy beat. She really sings well on this track.<br />12.Everytime - ***** -Britney's best ballad to date. The music seems very raw, with a piano and Britney's vocals. It is one the album's best songs!
B0000C1733|5.0|Wow!!!!  Here we are 20 years later and the Red Hot Chili Peppers are still rocking.  This is such a great package, everyone needs to go out and buy it.  It is such a treat to the ears to listen to the Chili Peppers evolve over time.  Not only does their music evolve but the band members themselves do too.  They have seem to have gotten more musical as they get older.  Hearing how far these guys have come in 20 years makes me excited to see where exactly these pioneers in music will go with their next album.
0385505833|4.0|In this satirically entertaining book, John Grisham presents Christmas, a season of joy and much-celebration, through an entirely different perspective. Skipping Christmas shows us just how insanely chaotic the holiday has become.<br /> Luther, a grumpy accountant, and Nora, his obliging wife, are the Kranks, a wealthy couple who have a daughter off in Peru and a season of restlessness, headaches and mayhem fast approaching. So, they come up with an idea, to skip the holidays all together; to skip the crowded malls, hectic schedules and enormous bills and take a cruise down to the Caribbean. There is only one problem, their neighbours. Being that the Kranks house will be the only one on Hemlock Street without a Frosty on the roof, or even a Christmas tree, the neighbours are horrified and you will laugh out loud as the Kranks go through the pressures to conform and finally conclude in a tense, yet comical ending.<br /> This is not one of Grisham's usual novels about lawyers and juries and drama, nor is it his best but, Skipping Christmas is quick and fun and can be enjoyed by even teenagers like myself. It is a delightfully amusing book for those who understand the chaos and frenzy that have become a part of our holiday tradition.
B000050IE6|5.0|This is the best Opeth CD out there, and one of the best albums ever in my opinion.  There is not one average song on this, all godly. <br />But people Opeth is not Black Metal... they are Death Metal.  I know alot of people will say &quot;no they arn't cause they sing and scream and have acoustic!!!11&quot;  but keep in mind that not all Death Metal is trash just because alot of US bands litter the genre.
B00000JLWW|2.0|OK. So the action, the special effects, and the costumes are great in this movie. I have to give them credit for that. They really take you back to 1912. But the storyline in Titanic sets my blood boiling!  I'm sorry but love does not happen overnight. This movie is about two immature, selfish teens infatuated with each other. They hurt others and even risk their own well-being just to satisfy their lust.  Jack Dawson, makes for a peculiar and utterly selfish character. He is a poor but well-travelled man of his time???(A strange combination in those days.) Anyhow, he was extremely inconsiderate of his little rich girl Rose. What was he planning to do when they got off the ship? Sweep her off her feet, and introduce her to the wonderful life of 18 hr. sweat shops, diseased slums, and stillborn babies?  For a more experienced and more exposed man, he sure had some good intentions for his little princess! I'm sure that when the misery and reality set in, she would've realized just how much happier life was going to be with her new love! Definitely the new and better life that she so deserved.  I also didn't find it too amusing that he blatantly forced his way into an engaged couple's relationship and basically stole another man's woman. He then proceeded to take an inexperienced and naive girl's virginity in the backseat of a car!???? Yeah, he really treated her like a lady there. He sure showed her some dignity and respect.   It's good riddance that he froze to death in the end. Some things do work out for the best, don't they?   Titanic is a probably a good movie for those shallow, narrow-minded hopeless romantics. If one opens their eyes and take a really good look at it, they'll realize that this \\"love story\\" is not as cute as it seems.
6301797906|3.0|Social Consequences of dis-location and Poverty:<br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath&quot; is the story of an Oklahoma family moving to California during the Great Depression. They move to California to find better work and jobs, only to find that there is little opportunity. The family goes through rough times, but they hold together because they know that they can preserver. Henry Fonda plays an important role as Tom Joad. A convict out on parole, he goes with his family to California. Some experiences along the way help to change him and make him a better person. He soon realizes that people are more important and vows to devote his help to those who need it more and to those who aren't as fortunate.<BR>                                      The things which I found from the movie are:<BR>* There were no written papers that can prove that land belongs to an individual at that time.<BR>* Absolute poverty: people didn't have enough food and money to meet their basic necessities of life.<BR>* Poor people were dependent on rich for their basic needs such as food, shelter and clothes.<BR>*  Monarchy System: Poor people were doing whatever rich people were saying them to do.<BR>* Wages were low and workers had no rights to fight for their wages, working conditions etc.<BR>* Tenant Farmers<BR>* Unequal distribution of wealth.
B0000TB03W|5.0|every one should buy this dvd its the best dvd that she ever has  put out i am sure every one will love it she is so awesome i recommended it to every one so hit the store's and pick it up u will love it
B00006CXXU|5.0|Amazing lyrics, AMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZING voice, amazing beats...What else do u want??? It's hard for me to imagine that this Christina is the one that was part of the whole bubble gum pop phase...She has grown and changed TREMENDOUSLY, it's shocking...Props for her, she's been getting loads of respect for such an amazing album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's new CD is an upbeat, fun CD that will get you in the mood to dance! If you purchase it, be ready to get jiggy with it!
B00005JLXE|1.0|Translating an idea between media, i.e. comic book to movie, necessitates changes.  I enjoyed Marvel's X-Men, Spider-Man and Hulk movies; all embody changes from the comics but they were true to the spirit of the originals, and the changes were, in some ways, improvements.  In Daredevil, the changes damage the story line and lessen the character.<br /><br />Comic:  Jack Murdock is a constant moral compass to his son, he never betrays his ideals.  Matt is blinded in his first act of heroism; he races to push a blind man from the path of an on-rushing truck from which falls a radioactive isotope, striking him across the eyes.<br /><br />Movie:  Jack lies to Matt, pretending to be a dockworker; actually he's a bonebreaker for a loan shark.  Discovering his father roughing up a victim, Matt runs away, heartbroken, right into a spray of toxic waste.  Which is more interesting, makes the character more noble, lets us understand how a hero could have been raised by such a father?<br /><br />Comic:  Ben Urich is a tall, gangly chainsmoker, hag-ridden by his commitment to journalistic integrity.<br /><br />Movie:  He's short, artsy, with an effeminate speech pattern, wears his hat backwards and literally looks down his nose at everyone he talks to.<br /><br />Comic:  The Kingpin is a super-Godfather.<br /><br />Movie:  Ditto, but he's black.  Like all Mafia bosses, natch.<br /><br />Comic:  Matt becomes one of the nation's top trial attorneys.<br /><br />Movie:  he can't even convict one of the Kingpin's men of rape, he's not as good as the defense lawyer.  (And how much sense does it make for a private attorney to handle a high profile case against a known organized crime figure?  Can you say:  district attorney?)  He doesn't even charge money, clients pay him in barter.  Which makes the character more impressive?<br /><br />Comic:  The fact Matt is not a normal blind man is his greatest secret.<br /><br />Movie:  After being \\"blinded\\" he beats up the neighborhood bullies,complete with gymnastics.  You think someone might realize this isn't your typical blind kid?  He does the same thing with Elektra years later.  They do their best to beat each other to a pulp (it's shameless the way they flirt) with dozens of witnesses, engaging in flips, balance beam acts, martial arts moves. Goodbye, secret identity.<br /><br />Comic:  Matt's billy clubs snap together, disguising themselves as his blind man's cane.<br /><br />Movie:  The \\"disguised\\" cane is inset with raised devil head emblems. <Groan.>  As a direct result of this, Ben Urich realizes Matt is Daredevil.  A police scientist demonstrates how the billy clubs collapse down to a long, thin cane.  (But the police never, then or later, say to themselves, \\"You know....this looks a lot like a blind man's cane.\\")<br /><br />Comic:  Bullseye is a stone-cold costumed assassin.<br /><br />Movie:  Bullseye is a twitchy, undisciplined killer with a scarred forehead and trenchcoat. Bullseye's elegant black-and-white outfit would look great in live action. Why they didn't go for that is beyond me.<br /><br />Comic:  DD's mask is an integral part of the costume.<br /><br />Movie:  It's a pull-on hood, a horribly uncertain method of retention for such an acrobatic hero. But then, if the way the mask affixed wasn't so insecure, Matt couldn't have been unmasked so easily, not once but twice, during the movie.<br /><br />Elektra stabs Matt through the left shoulder, totally penetrating the scapula. Matt drops to the ground in shock, he can barely move.  But later he holds himself on ropes over an abyss (with his left arm), does gymnastics, blocks Bullseye's full-power kicks (with his left arm).  Remember the movie's opening image shows his blood dripping down dozens of feet of church roof and wall.  I can believe a man has super-senses.  It's called magical realism.  You ask me to believe a normal man - and that's what Daredevil is, no super-strength, no Wolverine-type healing factor - can still be upand running, engaging in martial arts battles, hours after having a steel rod punched all the way through his shoulder blade and losing, oh, five pints of blood, that's not magical realism.  That's impossible.<br /><br />Final absurdity:  Matt will kill a rapist but not the Kingpin.  We could debate the morality of the former death.  But when the man who's murdered the only two people you've ever loved is helpless on his knees in front of you, he knows your secret identity, he's saying, \\"I'm going to get you,\\" you know he means it, if you leave him alive he's going to kill you and/or more people you care about....it's not like he's giving you a whole lot of choice.  But Matt proclaims self-righteously, \\"I'm not the bad guy,\\" and walks out.  No, you're a moron.  This after throwing Bullseye from a 100-foot tall window and across a street onto a police car, which probably did kill him.  Dumb plot twist.  But par for the course in this movie.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|As with many pop CD's, you expect to hear a couple of good songs and the rest you quickly pass over. Every song on this album is AWESOME! It's different and full of energy! This is by far one of my best CD purchases and you won't be sorry you did, either!
B00005JMFR|3.0|This movie was so good i mean it was awsome it had it all. Battles, love, and intensity. But it seems that the makers couldnt figure out a way it end it all i mean come on people cant you come up with a better ending than that i mean 4 real<BR>wait till the video
B0000508U6|5.0|unlike most fans of this album, i found coldplay's first single &quot;yellow&quot; to be boring, way overplayed, and well, just not that great to me.  Dismissing them as a mainstream one-hit-wonder type band, i went on with my life.  Strangely, my father is the one who recommend that i listen to them, and thankfully i did.  From beginning to end, this is a remarkably strong album.  Personal favorites would be spies, everything's not lost, and high speed.  I'd strongly recommend looking into Radiohead if you are a fan of coldplay, because i feel that while coldplay is remarkable, radiohead manages to top them.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears 4th album. This has to be her most diverse album yet. It has everything to R&amp;b, Dance/Techno, to European Dance. She has worked with many famous musicians including Moby, P.Diddy, R. Kelly, Ying Yang Twins, and Madonna. She also worked with the great Cathy Dennis famous for her songs included on the S Club albums (UK Based Group).<br />Me Against The Music - The 1st single with a great guitar riff in the back to keep the beat. This is a great song. 5/5<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - This is a great club song. It reminds me a lot of 50 Cent's &quot;In Da Club&quot; I love the way she sings in this song. It also has that famous line you'll be hearing &quot; Yeah, I Got That&quot;<br />Showdown - Here's another uptempo song. It starts off a lot like &quot;Lonely&quot; with her speaking and then singing. 5/5<br />Breathe On Me - This is another great dance song. It has a European vibe to it. Sounds a lot like a song Kylie MInogue would do. 5/5<br />Early Morning - I love this song. It is just so great. 5/5<br />Toxic - Here comes a song from Cathy Dennis. It sounds like a song used in a James Bond movie. It also sounds a lot like Sweet Dream My L.A. Ex. 5/5<br />Outrageous - This song is good. It's a little repetative but still a good song. 4/5<br />Touch Of My Hand - I love this song. It has a Middle Eastern feel to it and is the closest song sounding like Madonna. Her false setto at the end is amazing. 5/5<br />Shadow - The most anticipated song on the album. It is a great song. You can hear many refrences to &quot;I'm With You&quot; by Avril Lavigne because The Matrix wrote the song. The bridge is identical to Avril's song. This could be a Justin related song. 5/5<br />Brave New Girl - Probably the most Pop song on the album. I love her rap in the begining. 5/5<br />Everytime - The second ballad on the album. This song is probably the most obvious song about Justin on the album &quot; I may have made it rain... my weakness caused you pain&quot; It'sa great song. It has harps, strings and a piano.<br />This is probably the best album. I guess you can say that it was definetly worth the wait and prooves she has what it takes to be in this buisness.
B00005Y6YB|3.0|DVD is edited.<br />However, they give you lots of bonus material that you can use as &quot;salt in your wounds&quot; while you steam over the hacked up product.<br />I was very disappointed.  How do you justify changing such a well received classic?

B0000CFW87|5.0|I have come across Josh Groban's music only recently, after  listening to other performers of his kind: Andrea Bocelli, Alessandro Safina &amp; Mario Frangoulis.<BR>After &quot;The Songs&quot; album, his true-brilliant creation - and several duets with other performers (&quot;The Prayer&quot;, &quot;There For Me&quot; etc..), Groban again shown at his best. There is no wonder, hence, that the neighbor down stairs is experiencing some difficulties sleeping... <br />Highly Recommended.
B000002ITW|5.0|I've been through so many copies of this album, on tape, and on vinyl--more than any other one I've ever owned.  And finally it came out on CD with the extra songs and I grabbed it immediately!  It's CSNY at their very best.  Southern  Man jam is awesome (&quot;usually a really long song...and tonight we're gonna do it real slow&quot;). As are Long Time Gone and the other electric shocks.  The acoustic tracks feature deep lyrics and gorgeous harmonies...the latter all the more impressive because it is live.  The added tracks were a delight to have added in...Neil's medley is so fine!!  ...and, as said in another review, the line &quot;one thing the blues ain't....is funny&quot; in the middle of the awesome Black Queen is a truly classic moment.  For now, I've misplaced my CD, so I'm looking for another copy (or two...it's a great gift!)...I'll never regret giving CSN&amp;Y another few bucks for this music that has carried me for decades.  Thanks, guys!
B000002UB3|5.0|A great CD that started as the first vinyl LP I owned in high school (after reel to reel tapes). This being the Beatles last effort was musically their very best and really showed the distinctive style each of the Beatles was growing into.  It also had the very best sound quality of any Beatles album showing how rapidly the recording industry and electronics had evolved during the 1960s.  Every song on side one is unique and displays a wide range of skills and musical styles and side two hearkens back to the White album style of many short pieces. Yet each one a fantastic piece.  If fame hadn't burned them out, I wonder what the Beatles would have produced in the 1970s.  Every Beatles fan should have Abbey Road, in my opinion one of the best albums of all time.
0688156819|4.0|I was lucky enough to have a co-worker share this book with me.  A collection of Tim Burton's short macabre stories with his own illustrations, written for more adult readers than children. For the example the title story regarding \\"Oyster Boy\\" features a bizarre ending in which the father eats his son to better his lackluster sex life with his wife.  In \\"Robot Boy\\" a women gives birth to a boy robot after having sex with kitchen appliances(!) much to her husband's dismay. Other stories in the collection that I enjoyed: \\"Stainboy,\\" \\"The Girl Who Turned Into a Bed,\\"  \\"Mummy Boy\\" and \\"Anchor Baby.\\"  As one reads this book we see the ever-present dark human side of a cinematic genius!  Interestingly enough the book is dedicated to then Burton's girlfriend Lisa Marie who has appeared in some of his films as well.  It should come as no surprise that the title character in \\"Stickboy\\" resembles Jack from the \\" A Nightmare Before Christmas.\\"  If you're a Burton fan or are inspired by his work this book is a definite must!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|It's got to be said, so I guess I'd better be the one. While the Naked version of Long And Winding Road most definitely destroys the overblown Montiovani-like production on the original release, other songs like Across The Universe, I Me Mine and even Let It Be suffer. Spector's version of Across The Universe wisely slowed down the tempo, the tape speed reduction making John's voice sound more Beatle-y and added droning tambouras and tasteful strings. On the song Let It Be, Naked goes for the muted guitar solo used on the single whereas Spector picked the superior fuzztone drenched solo, its nasty tone deflating the pomposity of the tune itself. And it should be noted that the horns &amp; strings on this number were arranged by George Martin not Spector. Plus, the new version eliminates a crucial drum overdub in the final verse. The Naked version of I Me Mine uses Spector's trick of repeating a verse to extend the song's length while omitting Spector's tasty string overdub. Overall, the new mixes sound a bit shrill by comparison to the earlier ones. A lot of the personality the original album had has been destroyed by eliminating the between song chatter. And I don't care what you say, the song Get Back is supposed to end with John saying &quot;I hoped we passed the audition.&quot; Maybe it wasn't always so, but after 30 years of hearing it that way it's become a crucial part of the song. So while it's nice to have this (after all, I did buy the thing), overall I still like the earlier version better.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|\\"Let It Be...Naked\\" could have been so much more, and it really couldn't have been much less.<br />I purchased the anthology collection under the thought that if anyone can remake a Beatles' song, it's the Beatles.  That about sums it up for this compilation - they had the best people for the job.  Unfortunately, they already had the job done the best way possible.  I love the sometimes wild, sometimes deep, and always energetic flair of the original.<br />The remake is strangely... lacking.  Lacking FUN.  As any Beatles fan can state, \\"fun is the one thing that money can't buy.\\"  With two songs (Dig It, Maggie Mae) missing along with all of the witty dialogue between songs, the cutting room floor is having all of the fun.  Second best is okay, though, and I appreciate the \\"as it was intended\\" theme.<br />The 22 minute long bonus disc is there and interesting (for a couple of plays), but after reading about all of the bootleg recordings that contain a vast amount of outtakes and rehearsing, this single could have been a 4 CD set.  Why not fill the bonus disc up?  Why not fill both discs up?  Wouldn't it be Nice?
B00009TB5G|5.0|The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers was a great movie and a tremendous achievement in filmmaking.  It reminded me so much of what George Lucas accomplished with The Empire Strikes Back, and the movie has that feel that it is a medevial Empire Strikes Back.  But Lucas has now disgraced the Star Wars franchise with Episodes I and II.  Thank God we have a director named Peter Jackson, who has more than made up for our disappointment with The Lord of the Rings.  This Lord of the Rings film trilogy will be embraced by audiences for years to come.<br />But is all this praise good enough for Jackson?  No.  Jackson wanted to go the extra mile and present to us fans the second part of a trilogy, the movie that he knew we wanted to see in theaters.  And he presents it to us in this Extended Edition of The Two Towers.  This movie is not just 43 minutes longer, it is 43 minutes BETTER!  The only way you will ever see a movie like this in a movie theater is on Trilogy Tuesday, prior to The Return of The King, on December 17, 2003.<br />What will you get in this Extended Edition?  A lot.  I mean, A LOT!  I do not want to spoil it for any of you, because it is best that you just stick the DVDs into your DVD player, push Play, and just watch the movie to see what a difference 43 minutes makes.  But a couple of scenes I will mention include Eowyn asking Aragorn on how old he is (87, BTW) and a homage to Tom Bombadil (yes, finally, for those of you thought that Tom Bombadil was permanently left out of The Lord of the Rings, Jackson has listened and responded!).  Oh, and Miranda Otto showcases her singing during a scene where they bury King Theoden's son.<br />This Extended Edition of The Two Towers also requires a superior sound system.  The movie has been remastered in DTS 6.1, which is superior digital surround sound.  You will notice the difference.  When Saruman announces that &quot;A new power is rising&quot; to 10,000 Orcs, the chants are loud and furious!!!!!  Imagine beingin a football stadium of about 80,000 screaming fans.  That is how loud the chants are.  And the Battle of Helm's Deep...run for cover, it is an earthquake.<br />I have yet to browse through discs 3 and 4, but I can say that Peter Jackson has clearly developed a tremendous adaptation of one of the greatest pieces of literature ever written.  The Extended Editions of both The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers prove it.  Now we have to wait another year for the Extended Edition of The Return of the King!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I THOUGHT IT WAS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO AD ANYTHING NEW, NEVER MIND BETTER TO AN ORIGINAL BEATLES' RELEASE, BUT THIS NEW ALBUM IS MORE SATISFYING AND COHESIVE IN MANY FORMS THAN THE ORIGINAL. I WAS NEVER AN ADMIRER OF PHIL SPECTOR SO CALLED &quot;EXPERTICE&quot; AS A PRODUCER..., (I SEE EYE TO EYE HERE WITH PAUL). HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR AMERICAN MUSICIANS, BUT NOT TO USE HIS IDEAS WITH THE BEATLES. THE SOUND IS DEFENETELY A LOT BETTER AND CLEANER, THE VOICES AND THE INSTRUMENTS SOUND CRYSTAL CLEAR, WITHOUT ALL THE ECHO AND &quot;SPECTOR&quot; EFFECTS OF THE ORIGINAL. THE ONLY COMPLAINT I HAVE IS THE OMMISION OF &quot;MAGGIE MAE&quot; AND &quot;DIG IT&quot; TRACKS, BUT THE NEW FEELING OF LISTENING TO THESE TRACKS HERE AGAIN IS VERY REFRESHING, SPECIALLY THE SOUND QUALITY.<BR>THE ONLY THING I REALLY HOPE FOR IS THE RE-RELEASE OF THE LET IT BE MOVIE ON DVD WITH ALL THE NEW TECHNICAL ADVANCEMENTS DONE TO THE SOUND AND THE PICTURE. IT MUST SURELY BE ANOTHER REVELATION ALSO. DEFENETELY 5 STARTS!!!!, GOSH..., ANYTHING THE BEATLES EVER DID DESERVES 5 STARS!!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This is one of Britney's better albums, and leads her in a whole new, more adult direction. \\"Breathe on Me\\" is a really sexy dance track, and Shadow is interesting in a slower way. All in all, I will be listening to it non-stop for at least a week, and it is the perfect soundtrack for getting ready to go out and have a good time.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Well, I just got finished with the movie, and I am amazed.  They turned an amazing movie into a spectacular movie.  All the deleted scenes and extended scenes make the movie much easier to understand and bring out more important themes in the movie.  There is more laughter, sadness, and joy.  It really expands on all the thoughts (2/3 of the movie has been changed with either extensions or completely new scenes).<br />WARNING:  This movie is just short of 4 hours, and therefore is very hard to sit though without taking a break.  I had to take a break for dinner, but without it I would not have been able to sit through.  And I could confidently say I am a HARDCORE fan.  So, make sure you are well rested and clear minded when you watch this.

B0000E1ALR|5.0|Creating a multi-disc greatest hits set on Bruce Springsteen, even within the context of Sony's acclaimed \\"Essential\\" series, was bound to present problems. His acclaimed 30-year career gathered fans from disparate camps. He had those remembering the huge impact of 1973-75's opening albums and repeat 70s concert legends. He had Top 40 fans joining for 1984's multi-platinum \\"Born in The USA\\" but left as his style turned away from that dated LP's anthems (Springsteen even joked of being a teen idol at 35 on 1995 greatest hits CD). Finally, he has hardcore fans seeking everything released yet seeking out bootleggers (against Springsteen's wishes) for more.<br />You can argue with this 3CD set's sequencing and song selection. \\"My Hometown\\" should have been here; it captured the heartbreak of Springsteen's beloved Freehold and Asbury Park slipping away while, even more than the now-cliched \\"Born in the USA,\\" allowing him the wide screen shot of 1984 America. Chronological sequencing deprives the listener of hearing how Springsteen wrote on similar themes (unemployment, indifference, loneliness), widening and deepening his characters' vision while songs grew more sparse. (Clarence Clemons, still Springsteen's onstage foil, is heard only in the margins after songs from 1980's \\"The River&quot;). It makes Disc Two a harder, more somber listen. But these 47 songs successfully show Springsteen's greatest gift to rock: his ability through sheer musical will to raise mundane human interaction to high art and anthemic drama.<br />It came down to ambition and adulation of his rock and roll idols. Bruce Springsteen wanted to tell Bob Dylan's stories with Van Morrison's spiritually soulful voice (\\"Rosalita,\\" \\"Blinded By The Light&quot;). He wanted to sing like Roy Orbison atop Phil Spector production (\\"Born To Run,\\" \\"Hungry Heart\\"). He wanted a band who could compress every 60s 45 into one performance, at once if needed, and wanted to front that band as James Dean, Marlon Brando, and Elvis Presley (sharing those legends' association with transportation as empancipation). He found it in his E Street Band, creating songs as grand and melodramatic, even as bloated and cloying (Springsteen always loved the huge count offs), as those classic songs were.<br />The songs sound better than ever thanks to Bob Ludwig's remastering, probably presaging re-release of Springsteen's catalogue in Sony's SACD format.  The extra songs are worthwhile for diehards (\\"From Small Things\\" waters down Chuck Berry, \\"County Fair\\" tenderly evokes, memories of a summer carnival, Jimmy Cliff's \\"Trapped\\" a dramatic performance originally released on 1985's \\"We Are the World\\" LP.) But it's Springsteen's collected works, intelligently gathered and presented, which makes \\"Essential Bruce Springsteen\\" a sterling introduction and near summation of this American rock and roll icon.nd Elvis Presley (sharing those legends' association with transportation as empancipation).

B0000C7PQK|5.0|Michael Cretu is one of the most gifted musical visionaries yet.<BR>He is the man behind the creative force called Enigma.  Sandra Lauer is his wife as well as a vocalist on many Enigma tracks.  Well studied in classical music, he has been able to transform and mold several styles of music into something spectacular.<BR>Don't consider the individual CD releases as single works, but as single parts of a series.  With each new album there is a flow and deliberate continuum.  Enigma does not rely on publicity, radio play or MTV videos to sell their albums.  They simply make wonderful music - From the heart and For the heart.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Anybody who is a Shania Twain fan MUST purchase this DVD, especially if they have never seen Shania live in concert. The show is energetic, fun, and showcases Shania's amazing talent. I purchased this DVD even though I recorded the special when it aired on TV. I'm glad I did, especially since there are extra performances that were not shown on television. I am extremely pleased with the mix of songs that Shania incorperated in this concert. Because I've been following her career since the debut of her first album in 1993, I love seeing her perform the Shania classics. It's refreshing to see she has not forgotten her past hits that launched her career, as some performers do. I guarantee a good time whenever you watch this incredible performance by Shania. So, do yourself a huge favor and buy a copy!
B0000E1WNV|5.0|Greetings From South Jersey and Im proud to say the Boss and His band have done it again. I am so glad Bruce decided to release the Riseing Tour on DVD. Not only it it his best album in years but the dvd captures Him and the band at what they do best. Plenty of old favorites and  plenty of classics from the Riseing-songs which are very moving and personal. Empty Sky, Into the Fire, Youre Missing ,Worlds Apart  and the romps Like Ramrod,&amp; Night. Unbelievable.  Bruce manages to Capture the best emptions and no matter where he goes from NJ to anywhere in the world he unites all of of us no matter where we are with his music. This Dvd is the first complete concert he put out and hopefully it wont be his last. (its even better than Madison Square Garden Dvd). So if you are a Bruce fan you know what to expect-- and if you are new to the Boss strap your self down and sit back and enjoy the power and the electricity of the E-Street Band Live -its a concert you wont soon forget. Bruce and the Band had Done New Jersey proud again!!!

B0000TB03W|5.0|This concert was her best television special so far and the dvd is even better!  Great deal for the money!
B00004S6GL|5.0|I won't repeat what all the other reviewers have said only that this is one of the best discs I've ever owned.  It's very soft and intimate.  I'm only sorry that Elliott is no longer with us.  Get this album.  You won't regret it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'll admit, I've been a big Britney fan from the very beginning but I think from an objective standpoint, this is her most competent album to date.  Contrary to some of the recent press coverage, the album is not that sexual in its lyrical content. There are a few lines here and there but I've heard far worse on the radio. <br />Musically, the tracks have some of the catchiest hooks I've heard in a while. And I think she successfully incorporated other musical genres from trance, to hip-hop, to dancehall. I think this album will have great staying power based on the strength of potential singles like \\"(I've Got That) Boom Boom\\", \\"The Hook up\\", and \\"Breathe on Me\\". The song \\"Everytime\\" is a very simple, poignant reflection on lost love that comes across beautifully. All in all, I think even non-Britney fans would enjoy this album and I highly recommend it. <br />(...) <br />If you're a Britney fan, you'll love it. If you're not, give it a try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I had such high hopes for Whitney Houston's new CD One Wish.  Finally, a whole CD of Christmas music from one of the best vocal talents there is.  The first feeling I got after listening to One Wish was that Whitney must not have been in the holiday spirit while she was recording One Wish.  Whitney's voice sounds strained and not as pure as it one was.  Unlike Barbra Streisand, who achieves near perfection on practically every record she releases, Whitney has definitely struggled during the past few years to match the glory of her earlier recordings.  I was also amazed that the music on the album seemed more suited to an R and B album (which is fine if you're releasing that genre of music) but if you're going to do a Christmas album (especially one that inlcudes so many classic Christmas songs) I think the music should somehow reflect the mood of the holiday season.  Whitney is without a doubt an amazing vocalist and I look forward to her future projects but quite frankly my one wish is that I could return Whitney's new CD for a complete refund!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the best television special of Shania and more are to come!  This dvd is better than the tv special.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is by far her best album yet!  Although I will say that don't let your first impressions get the best of you - like all good albums this one grows on you over time (unlike Sluttinas 'Stripped').  There aren't any obvious filler tracks like on her earlier albums; although I must say that the pacing in the middle of 'Boom Boom' is absolutely terrible as that is a good song that has been ruined by bad production.....<br />Apart from that one song though, the rest of this album rocks and is by far the best pop album this year!!! buy it NOW!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I have to admit, Let It Be was never my favorite Beatles album, mostly because I didn't like all of the orchestration on the album, it didn't seem to fit with the songs lacking orchestation. 'Across the Universe' sounds much better without the female voices, and although it was available without them on the charity recording, this version is a bit slower and a little more passionate. All in all, I don't think that this album was completely necessary, but let's be honest, neither was the original album. However I must say that this is a marked improvement over the 1970 version. My only problems with it are the fact that two songs were cut from the recording, and the original banter in between songs is now gone.
B00005UW9T|3.0|This is a cute movie and its a sweet fairy tale for kids and anyone that likes animation but it doesn't tell the real truth about Anastasia. Anyone that studied Russian history knows that the royal family didn't survive. They were taken to the basement and shot along with their servants. Women in the past that have claimed to be Anastasia & they were proved to be fakes. I can't believe the film makers had the nerve to put the tag line, \\"based on a true story.\\" Who do they think their kidding?
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a must have DVD  u guys!  It rocks from the beginning to the end...It so worth ur money for and I would definetely recommend this video to everyone who loves Shania and everyone who loves country music.  All the songs are performed well and with lots of excitement...Rated more than 5 stars...
B00008S2VH|5.0|Love it, Love her, Love everything. At first, was a bit hesitant but this CD really grows on you.
B0000AQZYM|5.0|I have watched this movie about 15 times with my three year old daughter and I still enjoy it.  The voice acting is superb and this \\"kid's\\" movie actually makes me feel good.  You have the ocean adventures with Nemo's dad and Dory and you have the aquarium adventures with Nemo and Gil.  Two different stories going on and both are very entertaining.  The Sea Turtles are my favorite part, they make you laugh and think a little.<BR>Must have DVD if you have kids of any ages, even if you don't, buy it, we won't tell anyone!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I just saw this DVD and knew I had to buy it! I like the way she went to the fans and everything about this DVD! This just has to be the best music DVD ever!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I think The Beatles is the greatest band in history. Just the fact that a remastered disc launched 30 years after the break up which is in the best sellers is a great success.  I never thought in my wildest dreams that I would be buying a new Beatles album in 2003.  The solely history of the sessions and the different approaches to the production until we finally have the version as it was originally planned before the break up is great.  The sound is incredibly, we can appreciate better the guitars and the drums which were some times shadowed by the production arrangements. I like this Band is more like a rock and roll band, the album was intended to be like this, no doubt.  After hearing this I think they should launch every single album remixed and all the Beatles fans would enjoy the sound.  Congratulations to all the people involved in this, of course Paul was the main promoter, not against John or George, but in favor as they were and still are a team.  [...]  Thanks.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I listened to the whole CD from start to finish, and let me tell you, it was awful.  I respect Britney Spears and her influence on the music industry, but most of the songs were just horrible.  Granted, there are a few (very few) songs on the album that are good (for example, I liked &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;).  However, this CD is really just full of club music.  Really bad club music.  Listen to the second song on the album, and you'll know what I'm talking about.  Britney used to have catchy songs that you couldn't get out of your head (seriously, who doesn't remember the words to Baby, One More Time?), but this CD is full of very forgettable music.  She should have stuck with her old formula.  Don't buy this CD.
B00005JM0B|4.0|I am surprised this movie did not make more money.  Not quite as good as T2, but an excellent movie none the less.  Great action and I really liked the two new hero characters.  Arnold was still good and I liked the human/caring type of machine he portrayed.  Lokken, the female bad guy machine was excellent.  She had the combination of being scary and very good looking, so I enjoyed when the bad guy was on camera.  With so many bad sequels out there, this the third in line was good at keeping the Terminator story alive.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I love this DVD because there are so many songs to choose from. My personal favorite is &quot;She's Not Just A Pretty Face&quot;. So go ahead, Buy this DVD before they sell out!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|umm...wat to say, well it was a waste of money!, britney claims she is a grown woman and has grown on this album yet there are no \\"real\\" songs talking about her life experiences excet for one ballad called everytime. as well, her vocals are even worse then b4, she's barely even singing in half of the songs mostly whispering and inhaling.lol, i have to say though her tunes and rythm is really good, she has catchy tunes. but i would jsut download it, her cd isnt wrorth one cent. if u compared her album to christina's stripped, u can really see who is really trying to grow and reflect upon what they have been through and who;s vocal range is amazing. Britney iisa a Great enertainer and thats about it, good luck britney:d...
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is one of my favorite albums of all time.  Every track is absolutely amazing, nothing comes close to this album since Rage Against the Machine's last album.  Incubus is one of the only original band's still around, everybody else just sounds the same.  Their sound has matured so much over time, but all their albums are awesome, I love them all.  &quot;Morning View&quot; is literally amazing and I can listen to over and over and over and never get tired of it.  I've had it since it came out and to this day i still get chills listening to it.  BUY THIS ALBUM.
B00005JMCN|4.0|Based off one of the best books I have ever read (Hildebrand), this movie did a great job of not letting the book down.  I still like the book better, but the movie had a lot of things going for it.  All the three main actors deserve some Oscar recognition, they were excellent.  The race screens and stories of Seabiscuit were very exciting and well directed.  The radio DJ added some nice humor to the movie.  A feel good/inspirational movie and must have for all DV collections.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums of all time.<BR>Just about totally timeless.<BR>It's all here.  The crunching punk sounds, the early use of reggae and the sound that every Ska band in England would use to forge their way.<BR>There are no clunkers.  There are no songs out of place.<BR>Just pure Clash.  They proved with this record they were &quot;The Only Band That Matters&quot;.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I'm a big Beatles fan.  Let It Be was originally intended to be a live concert album, but that never happened.  Eventually Phil Spector was brought in and he produced the original Let It Be album.  Sir Paul, however, was never happy with Phil Spector's work.  As a result, we now have Let It Be... Naked.  If you loved the original, Naked will probably let you down.  All of the fun of the original album has been digitally removed from Naked.  Naked is devoid of feeling.  It does not have the edge of the original.  Naked hiccups.  It starts and stops.  It doesn't flow.  Naked takes a set of classic Beatles songs and digitally neuters them.  Digital technology is very powerful.  It turned a great \\"live\\" album into a mediocre studio album.  [...]  Why go to all the trouble to digitally sterilize that sound?  And what's up with the reverb?  Half the time Paul sounds like he's singing in the shower.  Personally, I don't like all the strings on the original \\"Long and Winding Road\\" track and the loud guitar solo on the original \\"Let It Be\\" track bugs me.  I think the best versions of those songs can be found on Anthology 3 (and Paul hadn't even written all the words to Let It Be when he sang the version on   Anthology 3).  Naked did not improve on those tracks at all.  I did, however, like the fact that Naked includes John's \\"Don't Let Me Down.\\"  But, again, a live song that has been digitally neutered.  Bottom line... Naked has no balls.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's UP! dvd is great! I love the song: she's not just a pretty face and her title song, UP!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|first of all I would like to say that the sound is great,although the mixes for&quot;two of us&quot; and &quot;I dig a pony&quot; don't sound much different &quot;I me mine&quot; and &quot;1 after909&quot; and the alt take of &quot;don't let me down&quot; sound great&quot;let it be&quot;,&quot;long and winding ect&quot;,and &quot;across the ect&quot; are stripped of the phil spector stuff..the highlight is &quot;across the universe&quot; it sounds so great!! here's where I'm going to b@tch,first of all we know there are hours of unreleased &quot;get back/let it be&quot; recordings including the roof top concert (some songs which we never heard before)these songs were left off of this release!!for example the 5 minute+ version of &quot;dig it&quot; could have been on here but it wasn't also &quot;maggie may&quot; was left off,disc2 has too much talking and not enough music you get little 10,20,30 second versions of songs I would rather have the full versions and pay a little more.I would have done it different if I was in charge.here's what I'd do disc1 &quot;let it be naked&quot; and &quot;studio jams&quot; including the oldie cover tunes(save the last dance ect) and the long versions of some of the songs(dig it and maggie may),disc two. the complete rooftop performance and demos (child of nature ect)and end the disc with some various talking ect(I dig a pigmy,blah,blah,blah).well maby we'll get a &quot;get back&quot; c.d. with some of the ideas I suggested in the future.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh does not disappoint. His second album is a triumph. He makes his debut as a song writer with &quot;Remember when it rained&quot; and &quot;Never Let Go&quot; both beautiful songs. But I specially loved &quot;Remember when it rained&quot;. I was a huge fan before but now even more. I can't wait to see him live!!! If you like Josh Groban or this kind of music and you don't have this CD...get it now!!!!! You won't be sorry, it is truly beautiful!
B0000CC5CS|2.0|I'm amazed by all the positive reviews for this films, especially assuming most of these people watched T1 and T2.<br />Terminator 3 was a ca$h in waiting to happen. I saw this film based on my admiration for the previous two movies, and I'm sure it was the same for most people. So hey, never mind the fact the second film basically precluded any further development of the plot, here comes Jonathan Mostow and some other businessmen.<br />Terminator 3's plot is really a pathetic self-justifying web, but that is not the main problem. The direction and acting are just poor. Kristanna Loken is not frightening in the slightest, neither can she act (even as a robot). So many of the elements are tried-and-tested ones rehashed from terminator 2. The director has absolutely no concept of suspense. It is full of over-the-top action scenes which are not really beleivable, even for a sci-fi. Nick Dahl is a pathetic actor as John Connor, and the dialogue is generally very weak.<br />All in all a lowest common denominator cash in which uses old Hollywood formulas of gratuitous action scenes, humour, cheese and special effects. It gets 2 stars because it wasn't boring, the sfx were good, and Arnold still somehow makes the one-liners sound funny.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|The vocal's voice reminds me James of Metallica. They are heavy like typical new metal, but they are kind of special.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|No one can do it like Whitney. Whitney sounds wonderful! She really brings those Christmas songs to life. Bobbi Krissi sounds great too! She could be the next great singer of our generation of singers. Great job Whitney, keep it up!
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Phil Spector version is a lot better and cheaper! Besides, this copy controlled feature causes problems to my CD players! Buyer be aware!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I was fascinated since the very first time I heard &quot;Train of thought&quot;. After a few times of listening, I've found that there are new elements in this album without falling apart from the original concept of the band. Just to give a simple example:<br />Is the first time that Dream Theater works in a song like &quot;Endless Sacrifice&quot;. The mere fact to listen James Labrie singing the style of Eric AKa (Flotsam &amp; Jetsam) do not denote influences from other bands. Is almost impossible to judge Dream Theater since they blend almost all the styles in music.<br /> I don't understand why people who love the previous works of Dream Theater could disagree with the idea that this album is great since every previous work marks a new chapter in this band. If you want a band that never changes go and listen &quot;Korn&quot;, they would always sound the same. This album is plenty of evocative spots. It is powerful &amp; melodic. The lyrics are profound. The instrumental work is excellent, with remarkable guitar-keys solos. Astonishing artwork.  And the immense merit:  the idea of &quot;Train of Thought&quot; has its own theme.
B00008H2LB|1.0|who like the rap metal? Their music is like bullxxxx.
B00009MEJU|1.0|&gt;Indeed, Soderbergh's *Solaris* is remarkably free of dialogue altogether, which I personally found refreshing.<br />It is also remarkably free of content. Do you find that &quot;personally &quot; refreshing as well?<br />Unfortunately, Soderbergh's adaptation &quot;Solaris&quot; is not COMPLETELY free of flashback dialogue (dialogue contrived especially for this adaptation not found in its source), for that dialogue is distinctly puerile and insipid.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Im a little dissapointed.. her albums before this one were better, it might take a little time to like this one.. i have heard way better from her so im sad...
B000092ZYX|3.0|First of all I'm a big fan of Radiohead. O.K. Computer, The Bends, and Kid A are absolutely amazing albums, for their own reasons. However, they seems to have lost something with Hail to the Theif. It all seems like it's been done with more soul on their earlier albums. There are some high points, such as 2+2=5, There There, and A Punch Up at a Wedding. However, most of the other tracks leave me cold. The strange, dreamy sounds of Kid A are here, but they're icy instead of warm. The rocking guitars of the Bends make a guest appearance, but it's too short-lived.<br />On another note, though, the songs take on a whole new life live. Once in a while Johnny actually gets to play his guitar like a guitar, and at that point Radiohead starts rocking again, and you can hear where they were trying to go. Unfortunately, that feeling didn't make it into this album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|An immense pop album, from a well decided pop singer. Britney chose just the right producers for 'In The Zone,' and luckily avoided anything to do with the Neptunes. Just like any good pop album should sound, every song has an appealing, different, exhilirating, and interesting resonance. <br />This cd is definitly worth buying if your into Pop music. Simple as that. No doubt the best in its genre
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This album loses a star because of the expectations it was released under, not because of the music (all Beatles albums are 5 star!).  This was supposed to be Let it Be the way the Beatles would have released it.  I was expecting to hear finished versions of the songs without the additional production Phil Spector put on them.  Instead it is a compilation of songs from the Get Back sessions that are not quite polished enough to be finished products.  I know the original concept of the sessions was to produce a semi-live type album, but I don't believe the Bealtles would have released something this raw as a finished product.  I was expecting to hear versions of the songs that were better than the Spectorized ones, but instead some of the songs actually justify what Spector did to them, not improve on them.  In my opinion, Paul's remake version of The Long and Winding Road on his album Give My Regards to Broadstreet is better than the one on this ablum.  In fact, it is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard!  And it has always driven me crazy that they did not finish Get Back on the original Let it Be album (still waiting for the reprise!) and they did it to me again here!  Also, I was really looking forward to having Don't Let Me Down on the album, I always felt it was a perfect fit, but I like the original single release better than this one.  Don't get me wrong, this is a must for any avid Beatles fan and is worth listening to over and over, just don't expect it to be the ultimate Let it Be.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|True fans of Johnny Cash will recognize that his boomy voice had lost its thunder before this album was recorded, but that doesn't make this material unenjoyable.  The thunder was gone, but the authority was stronger than ever.  The frailty of Cash's voice and the fact that I thought he'd been near-death for years made the nature of these recordings and his voice appropriate for the time.  You can see this in the &quot;Hurt&quot; video...he is playing the guitar with bandages on his hand.  I enjoy this album beginning to end, and I only regret that he left more of his own old material out in favor of covers.  A haunting version of &quot;Sunday Morning...&quot; would've sealed the deal as one of Cash's best ever, and that's saying a whole lot.
0140072187|5.0|My mother bought me this book for my birthday once, unfortunately I put it on my bookshelf and forgot about it.  Some time later I picked it up whilst looking for something to read.  When I finished the book that night I realised that this had been one of the best books that I have ever read.  Indeed I have re-read it half a dozen times since.<br />This book is Masons personal account of flying helicopters in Vietnam.  Mason is a brilliant writer. Reading this book I was transported into Masons world.   Very few book ever do that to me.  I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of reading Chickenhawk.<br />I not only recommend, I insist that you read this book.  It is easily the equal of All Quiet on the Western Front.<br />Cheers
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I purchase Whitney Houston first ever Holiday album, and it was simply amazing I love Whitney version of &quot;O Holy Night&quot; it was beautiful that Women was Belting the crap out of this song. She made it into her own after hearing Whitney Houston sing this song. I don't wanna hear anymore version but her it's just that great. I see why this album is held the best christmas album of the year because its coming from our true voice Whitney Houston! I would recommend this cd to everyone for the holiday every track is very special and inspiring:0)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love Britney's new cd.  It is a really good look at how she has grown up as a woman and how she has grown up as an artist.  She displays a lot of new different sounds and a lot of new never before discussed topics.  She is not afraid to sing about topics that are close to her and express them through her music.  This is definetly an amazing cd and I recommend it to everyone.  I love to workout to Britney's music as well as listen to it at work and at home when I am blue.  Great Job Brit!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...] But unlike the White Album, it sounds like the Beatles are playing like a unified rock and roll band. [...] I am one satisfied customer. With the removel of Spector production, the chatter gone, and the sonic makeover, it is a more soild body of work than the uncertain 1970 release Let It Be Albums. A complant or two, sure, the sudden end to Get Back, I am sure I will think of another one later. My final thoughts, while Let It Be may not have as many consistantly great songs as say Revolver or Abbey Road, This new release is like a fresh start for a much troubled Beatle album.  Would Lennon have approve of the project, I don't know. Whatabout Harrison, well it is said that he gave his blessing during the early stage. I still like the orginal LIB album, so it is the best of both world. [...]
0679428895|4.0|Everybody thinks they know about the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius at Pompeii--79 AD . . .rivers of bubbling magma . . .citizens immortalized in pleading poses for all eternity by ash . . .the heedless rich getting their comeuppance from nature. Those basics are true, but Robert Harris reminds us that the eruption of Vesuvius was much more than that. It remains one of history's greatest and most dramatic disaster stories, and we know a great deal about it because one of the Roman Empire's greatest historians was there to write a blow-by-blow record of the destruction; and although Pliny did not survive, his report did.    Pompeii and Herculaneum were the Malibu and Santa Barbara of Rome. In the hot August of 79 AD, tourists were swarming to the cool coast to enjoy the luxury accommodations, crystal swimming pools, and elegant spas of the bayside resorts. Marcus Attilius is there too, but  he's not there to enjoy the occasional cool breeze, he's there to work as the new aquarius of the Aqua Augusta--the new water engineer in charge of the enormous aqueduct that brings endless water flowing to the nine towns around the Bay of Naples. Springs are failing for the first time in centuries and the flow of water is being disrupted to hundreds of thousands of people. Attilius' family has worked on the great aqueducts for generations, but even he is bewildered by the cause of this crisis somewhere along the Aqua Augusta's sixty-mile line--a line that stretches along the slopes of Mt. Vesuvius.    The Roman aqueducts were an amazing feat, and Harris describes their workings in great detail. He does an excellent job of showing, not telling, and through Attilius and his crew he weaves an incredible amount of information into the narrative and it is fascinating. Also excellently done is his description of the various effects of the eruption--which lasted several days--where he uses Pliny's observation of the event of excellent effect. Pliny, historian and general, was also a very fatand cranky old man by 79 AD. He took one of his ships out into the bay to watch and record the devastation from what he thought was a safe distance. But too soon the ships in the bay were in danger from the roiling waves and huge chunks of pumice flying down off the mountain. Pliny had his scribes don helmets and take down his descriptions as clods of pumice bounced off the old general's uncovered head--\\"The pumice is less like rock than airy fragments of a frozen cloud.\\" he dictates. \\"It floats on the surface of the sea like lumps of ice. Extraordinary!\\" Eventually it would clog the bay and begin to crush ships. Pliny knew he was too heavy and unsteady to escape the final firestorm from Vesuvius and ordered his scribes to save themselves and his precious reportage. Fortunately they did, and Robert Harris puts Pliny's observation to fine use in this novel.    Harris is a workmanlike writer with the gift of being able to integrate complicated information into a believable narrative. That's what made \\"Enigma\\" and \\"Fatherland\\" so interesting, and what works for \\"Pompeii.\\" The characters are take second place to the setting, and are not particularly exciting. However, they respond to the extraordinary circumstances around them in ways that are completely consistent with their characterizations. It is the same with Harris' establishment of place. He offers no special explanations of Rome, but builds it all into the action. As a result the Roman world seems very immediate and almost modern.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This c.d is so different than the others but it is so hot.  i love it, she has everything, pop, dance, rap, ragea, there is one song that is very rageaish (i don't think i'm spelling that word right.) but the album is hot as hell, it's on fire.  me against the music is hot, i've got that boom is so good, breathe on me is very kiley minoguish, toxic is hot, the hook up is hot, brave new girl is very dance club, go driving type of song, shadow is porbably the best song that showcases brit's voice it sounds so good in this song, everytime is good but i liked it better on snl, i love the me against the music remix.  the whole c.d. is good, and i would defintily suggest everyone should buy it because it is freaking awesome, and anyone that says otherwise should listen to it again, and again, and again, because it is awesome.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Once again, Shania is a huge success in her live performances. Her energy and spunk will amaze you. You will not be sorry with this dvd.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I was one of the crazies who went out and bought this at midnight last night, and it was completely worth it.  First off, let me start by saying that \\"Let It Be\\" is my least favorite Beatles album.  There are wonderful songs, but the record as a whole was ruined (in my opinion) by John's indifference and Phil Spector's stupid production.  Now, with this version, it takes it's place next to the others.  The songs of Let It Be are finally vindicated of their musical bondage.<br /><br />You have to give Spector this, though; with all of the hoopla made over his production in \\"The Long And Winding Road,\\" he was only covering up the many mistakes that are there in the previously issued take.  A bare look at that one (see anthology three) shows that John was simply wearing boxing gloves while playing the bass or something.  You can hear Paul grinning at John's ineptness.<br /><br />The take presented hear with Billy Preston's wonderful Wurlitzer solo is a complete improvement.  With all of the songs that use different takes here, I wonder why Spector chose the takes that he did... the mere run-throughs that destroy the original album.  \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" is a good example.  The take presented here is a much rawer version with a fine McCartney vocal-- he doesn't get into that nasally sound that he hits when not trying to strain his vocal chords on the high notes.<br /><br />That said, the production, as has been noted, is wonderful.  It sounds like playback from a studio.  Listening to the three sing \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" brought me to tears.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The good news: This is better than the original. The bad news: It could have been much better. First, I agree that the little quips, \\"I dig a pygmie, Arc the angels comin', Hope we passed the audition\\" etc., were good enough for the original soundtrack, more importantly, the original bootleg. They should have been used here, at least on the bonus disc. Second, Where is the truely naked version of \\"I Me Mine\\" with the flamenco intro? Finally, since many of us were hoping for \\"Get Back\\", would it have been so bad to include \\"The Walk\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\", etc., again at least on the \\"Fly on the Wall\\"? It seems the powers that let it be are still in denial about the original bootleg, which is still more exciting than any of the published versions. Next up, \\"The White Album...Fat Free\\" less filler and half the music.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Not a usual fan of POP music, but this cd was amazingly done very well. It is very trancey, dancey, w/ a sexual tone...great to keep you awake while driving! I actually wasn't sure with all the unneeded hype, but let me tell you I fell in love with Breathe On Me when I saw it on MTV, the CD is surprisingly very good, sure there are a few eh songs, but a majority of them are really really good! I am a huge fan of Breathe on Me, Toxic, Brave New Girl, Shadow, Early Mornin, Touch of My Hand. Of course Me against the Music is good, but already OVER PLAYED. If you are on the fence with buying the CD, I would definitly take the plunge...Right now you can usually get it pretty cheap the first week!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Hello everyone. First I want to say that this Special is the most energized concert I've ever seen of Shania. I've been a fan of her in the last 5 years, and I Felt in LOVE  since the first time I saw her. You have to buy this new DVD, its one of the Best concerts I ve seen of her............. by the way, buy the new Album too if you don't have it, its titled &quot;UP!&quot; its a 2-CD SET  You will love it!!! it's available here in AMAZON.COM too.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a great concert.  I recommend this DVD to every music lover.  Some of the songs performed are:&quot;You're Still The One&quot;, &quot;From This Moment On&quot;,&quot;Any Man Of Mine&quot;, &quot;Forever and For Aways&quot;,&quot;Up&quot;,&quot;Gonna Get You Good&quot; and my two favorites from her UP! album: &quot;She's Not Just a Pretty Face&quot; and &quot;Nah&quot;!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love Britney's new cd. If you love to dance and hear the best dance album out there, this is it. It branches out into new territory for spears and it really shows that she knows where she wants to go.  I've heard soooo many good things from everyone that has bought that album, but for you that don't like it, thats you opinion.  It may be your opinion but i think you have to stop trying to compare her to Christina Aguilera! I love Christina but they are 2 seperate people.  Britney is not a singer, she can sing better than people with out record contracts, but most other singers are better than her.  Big deal, its the music she comes out with that matters. It's her style and she is an entertainer above all, if u want to have a great thill bringing show, all you have to do is go to a Britney Spears concert, but if you want to go hear someone with a voice and can bring the roof down with that voice, see christina, but she barely does anything except walk around and few half assed dance moves.  Britney may lipsync from time to time, but her dancing and her overall show is well worth it.  This is so phonominal in my book, it has tight beats and crisp production, better than anyone out there.  So if you looking for moving emotional songs, this has a couple, but u'll be dissapointed, so don't hate britney for not coming out with something so mature ur grandparents would love it, its like all her other records, fun and upbeat, so i don't know why u'd expect anything more.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I can't recommend this DVD enough to other people.  It is a great performance!  Shania is better than even Madonna!
0802136834|5.0|I found the level of detail in this book simply fascinating.  I am not a history buff but found it really interesting to compare my own life with the life of a royal woman in the 1500's.  Certainly know which one I would choose!  I have also read David Starkey's book on the same subject and found Alison Weir's book to be so much better researched and not at all prejudiced towards her subjects (as flawed as they might have been).  I also recommend Alison Weir's &quot;Eleanor of Aquitaine&quot; - different time period but equally fascinating.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is the best concert video I have seen in years!  Shania is a great entertainer and I love the songs!  Shania has an awesome stage presence and I really enjoy her shows.  The DVD is the next best thing to seeing her live!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania Twain is at her absolute best during this performance! If you are a Shania Fan this dvd is a MUST have! I have not been fortunate enough yet to attend one of her shows, but You can bet, I will as soon as she makes her way to my area. Shania is so energentic, and boy is she singing from the bottom of her heart and soul! You can really tell her love for her fans, by her interactions with them! Can you imagine if you were there at this show, not only do you see one heck of a performance, but you also end up on her live DVD!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is a really good DVD and I highly recommend it to any music lover.  Shania is a great artist and is too big to be lumped into just one category - she is more than a country music artist. You would enjoy this DVD!
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have never seen another live performance with this much energy put forth! Shania is beautiful, and waht a voice she has! I think &quot;UP&quot; is a must have for any collection! If you want to see energy, crowd interaction and beauty, all in one, BUY Shania Twain's UP,Live IN CHICAGO DVD!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Hey, get this DVD it has some songs from all of her albums - well, not the first one!  She performs some from each album - She's Not Just a Pretty Face is done and it's awesome!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let It Be, while spawning, numerous, hit songs was always a bastard child of a Beatles' album. It got a raw deal and in this revisionist version of the album, it finally gets its due and stands side by side with the Beatles' best recordings. It's probably a stretch to say that this is what the \\"Beatles\\" intended since there are only two of them left, but either way, Let It Be...Naked, takes great songs and makes them greater with a more powerful aural presence only hinted at in the movie and original release. <br />Every song is improved; but, without a doubt, Across the Universe has finally been realized in this acoustic based ethereal mix that loses the lame Spectorisms and intrusive female backing vocals in the other versions. Lennon's voice on this is raw, naked and moving and is worth the price of admission to this album alone.<br />This is an album full of memorable classic songs delivered over 30 years later in righteous form to an era full of corporate focus group rock product that is lucky to have a shelf life of 30 days. Thank you, Beatles...again.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I can't say enough positive things about this DVD.  If you like good music and like to be entertained by an energetic, pretty, awesome singer then this is the DVD for you!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney's cd's get better and better and this one is the best yet!  Don't be turned off by the bad things people say about her.  They said the same about Madonna, Elvis, Eminem, and other controversial artists and these people end up becoming icons. Britney's no exception!!  Great cd, great music.  I give it 5 stars and recommend it to anyone interested in listerning to good music :)
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Finally the true Let It Be can be heard! When I first listened to \\"Naked\\", I was stunned. It was amazing how much clearer the sound was compared to the first Let It Be. The choir, horns, and maracas have been taken out allowing The Beatles themselves to shine through and be heard fully. I would recommend this CD to anyone! Songs include the rocking \\"One After 909\\", the monumental title track \\"Let It Be, and the the folky \\"Two of Us\\" with Paul and John harmonizing together which sounds utterly wonderful. An added bonus is a second CD named \\"Fly On The Wall\\" which is just of The Beatles talking and joking together which was neat to hear. THIS IS DEFINATELY MUSIC AT ITS BEST!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|As a long time jaded Beatles fan I am a bit disappointed with the overall track selection; I expected something more along the lines of the Glyn Johns &quot;Get Back&quot; project with the original intended song lineup and album cover. I am disappointed that the songs prematurely fadeout instead of including the dialogue between them ala the original &quot;Let it Be&quot;. I don't miss &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; but do miss &quot;Dig It&quot; as there is a longer version that could have been included.  The tracks sound good; I felt they were overproduced by Spector's &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; but knowing what has been released by bootleggers over the years there are alternate versions that could have benefitted from a digital &quot;cleansing&quot;.  As a novice being introduced to The Beatles for the very first time I would have a fresher perspective and thus would enjoy it more. When Apple/EMI come to their senses they will pick up some bootleg releases and listen to them for ideas as future &quot;official releases&quot;.  That is what the hardcore fans really want and have been waiting for since the mid 80's.  I gave the CD 4 stars based on overall price, quality of the package (Fly on the Wall bonus CD of studio work) and price.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This is a really, really good guitar album. Thats what it essentially comes down to.<br />I loved this release for one reason: it is full blown, all out metal, and Petrucci here is shredding like he's never shred before. The rest of the band seems to be following along his lead here. Its become more obvious in recent years, but especially now. <br />Rudess is immensley talented, but he is underutilized on this release and has become merely a backup &quot;guitar&quot; for Petrucci and his god-like metal bittersweetness. James Labrie follows up with his usual higher pitched squeals and some good rough vocals. It works, for the most part. His voice still can't quite match up to the crunching metal riffs, unlike most modern metal bands, but his unique voice has never hurt anything.<br />It saddens me to see DT having changed this way, but, at the same time, I'm quite glad I can finally headbang to this while deciphering Petrucci's intricate riffage in my head. Its almost challenging to even listen to. I mean this in a good way. This is why I like progressive anything.<br />Please DT: either use Rudess, like you've done so well on your two previous albums, or get rid of him. I've had it with his cheesy 70's keyboard riffs. This is the 00's already. Make it sound at least halfway natural.
B00005JMFO|5.0|To sum it up ABSOLUTELTY BRILLIANT, highly recommended!!!!!!!!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney Houston adds her star power to help make Christmas 2003 a little brighter. First, the voice. Yes, Whitney's voice is in top shape. The high notes are plentiful as is her falsetto. But Whitney also uses her lower register with new found security. <br />The arrangements of the songs are freshing and interesting.<br />This is the Christmas album of 2003 and helps Whitney recapture the gospel joy she first discovered in 1996 with &quot;The Preacher's Wife.&quot; <br />&quot;O' Holy Night&quot;, &quot;O Come O Come Emanuel&quot; and &quot;Deck the Halls/Silent Night&quot; are sure fire classics.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Well, did we ever think that we'd see this day any time soon?? I sure didn't until about two months ago. I don't think I've ever been more excited than when I opened my copy of this amazing album. This definitely is the album that I've been seeking out to find. Yes, we do have the many bootleg copies of the Get Back Sessions, but, do we have a coherent set of 11 great tracks that are digitally remastered and taken for what they should've been back in January 1969?? First, this album takes a new look at the original Let It Be track listing and, basically, tosses that aside. The new track list flows with impecable timing and catches your attention right away. The new Let It Be tosses out Maggie Mae and Dig It (two downers on the original, in my opinion)and are replaced by Don't Let Me Down. Second, the sound is beyond amazing. I played about half of the album in my car and the other half on my home stereo. It had the same effect no matter where I played it. Finally, this collection gives us not only the correct way the album should sound, it gives us a bonus disc that gives us an insight into the sessions. Now, for all of those who haven't seen the Let It Be documentary, the Beatles Anthology, or heard any of the bootlegs, this disc should be the only reason you spend the money to buy this disc. For all those, like myself, who have nearly every video, DVD, cd, tape, and vinyl of The Beatles, this bonus disc is just another incentive. I can't say enough to give this album enough praise. For all of those who are new to the Beatles (those who bought the 1 collection disc), you might want to buy the original album before buying this. You'll want to compare. Trust me, I did!! For those of us who have the boots and have no real need for another rehashing of Beatles material (or more ways that McCartney can make another dollar to support his new child), this still is an excellent addition to the collection. The good prices on this album won't last long, but the music will always be timeless. Peace and money.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|It may seem like overkill for MJ to release another greatest hits album after 2001's &quot;Michael Jackson Greatest Hits HIStory Volume 1&quot;, but these songs are strong enough to warrant it (all of them were number one hits).  This set omits the songs &quot;She's Out of My Life&quot;, &quot;Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'&quot;, &quot;The Girl Is Mine&quot; and &quot;Remember The Time&quot; that appeared on the 2001 greatest hits disc but adds 8 (!) other hits.  &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot;, &quot;Dirty Diana&quot;, &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, &quot;Earth Song&quot;, &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, &quot;Break of Dawn&quot;, his newest song &quot;One More Chance&quot; and the concert version of &quot;Ben&quot; from The Jacksons live album.  Although there are some number one hits still omitted, this CD is the more complete of the two.  As a bonus, the songs are presented in chronological order this time too.<br />The CD has been released in four different covers representing separate eras of his solo career.  Who knows which one Amazon will ship, but the cover pictured is my favorite.  Don't worry about not getting your favorite cover though as all are included in the bookelt.  Which brings me to the only downside to this collection - the skimpy liner notes.  Every greatest hits colection should list release date and chart information.  Not all of these songs were number one hits in the U.S.  It would be nice to know where it hit number one and how long it held the position.<br />MJ fans probably already have all 6 of his CD's and therefore the main reason to get this CD is for the new song &quot;One More Chance&quot; which is classic MJ R&amp;B.  If you only have one or two of his CD's then NUMBER ONES will be a perfect addition to your collection.  Highly recommended.
B00005JMFO|2.0|The movie has all the things that you would want to see at X'mas, however I felt that the plot was all over the place and that they tried to hard.. Wouldnt recommend it unless it was a rainy day!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I believe this new CD is the result of the lost Let It Be original recordings which were recovered earlier this year in a much publicized media story.The tapes were said to have been painstakingly remastered much to the joy of Paul who hated the Phil Spector reworking of the original.It has also been said that the original movie of the same name which accompanied the album release is to be digitally restored as well.Hopefully soon.To me the new version sounds great and I'll be looking forward to the DVD movie.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|Have the standards of Hollywood filmmaking dropped so far as to allow a movie this poorly made to crack the $100 million mark?  Apparently.  There is entirely too much dialogue in this installment, and most of the visual effects &quot;look&quot; computer generated.  What was so fresh in the first film comes across stagnant here.  There are a few CGI moments of note, but most look like I'm watching some kid playing a video game. The acting is sub-par as well.  Compared to &quot;The Matrix,&quot; &quot;The Matrix:Reloaded&quot; simply reeks.  The ending is like a cheesy Sci-fi original movie teaser to try and get the viewers to return for the finale.  I, for one, will not.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|This CD is extremely heavy...and I LIKE IT!<br />Some of the downsides:  There aren't many, but to me, the biggest downside was the use of gratuitous profanity.  This band is smarter than that, and can think of better ways to make the point.  The writing seems a bit rushed and less polished and thought out than some previous albums.  It was almost as if they have gotten so good at writing songs that they made the mistake of not taking their time.  And finally, a very picky point:  Petrucci's solos were incredibly fast and clean, but lack melody at times.<br />...but then again, I think most--if not all--of these &quot;flaws&quot; may have been intended.  This is sort of an &quot;angry&quot; album, and I think the band perhaps may have wanted to keep some rough edges.<br />As has been mentioned in other reviews, Dream Theater openly acknowledges their influences in their songs without being corny, and they continue that trend here.  Stream of Consciousness, for example, sounds a LOT like Orion at times.  And there are some other nods to Metallica and others scattered throughout.<br />There are also some very cool allusions to other DT songs.  This Dying Soul begins lyrically by taking the listener back to The Mirror.  But as the song progresses, it becomes obvious that it is a continuation of The Glass Prison.  You will also hear some Metropolis and Dance of Eternity in there if you listen carefully.  I love how this band can surprise the listener with the familiar!<br />LaBrie's singing is incredible.  He experiments with some new styles, and as always, pulls them off superbly without losing his own style.  For instance, he does a sort of &quot;nu-metal-rap/screamy&quot; thing (for lack of a better term)--but it sounds great even if you don't like that style, and then is singing super high clean vocals in the next verse.<br />John Myung is brilliant as always.  He has some fantastic bass parts on this album.<br />Portnoy is...just a drum animal.  Nothing new here.<br />Rudess' keyboards are often so subtle that you miss them.  He also uses a guitar sound quite often, so it sounds like there are two guitars and no keyboard.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|Okay, let's start with the good before I get too far into trouncing on this disc. There is some very clever and adventurous material on this disc and I was quite impressed with some of the production. The songs &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; (very &quot;Wild Thing&quot; in its rhythm and very Midnight Star/Cameo in its hook), &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Touch of my Hand&quot; and &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; (Very Kylie Minogue inspired ambient house-pop) are the highlights on this album. Admittedly, the song &quot;Everytime&quot; is quite well written... by Miss Spears, herself.<br />That song is the segue to what's wrong with the album. First off, there is a fair amount of junky sounding faux hip-hop gabaging up the disc. I don't know who put her on to this track but it needs to stop immediately. The style is horrible to begin with and then, when you slap a cut-rate singer on it, it just flounders. The aforementioned &quot;Everytime&quot; would be a great ballad if it had been sung with a little more conviction or, better yet, by someone who could actually sing.<br />One of the biggest problems with this disc (when it's not the hip-hop tracks) is the fact that the arrangements and production is so spare that it leaves Britney's vocal out to fend for itself. If that's not cruelty, I don't know what is! Britney just doesn't have what it takes to be a good sing. At least she doesn't anymore. She's gotten lazy. If you see footage of her as a young teen, her voice has a lot of depth and strenth. Now she growls a wind-up to each phrase and coos out the remainder of it. It's barely a wheeze at times. The poor thing can't even be bothered to sing live when she performs. I and many others find themselves increasingly ripped-off by this tactic. She really isn't growing as an artist. She's just changing the pieces of her wardrobe, musical and otherwise.<br />I hope that Britney continues to evolve and take risks. This was a noble attempt but her lack of vocal talent holds her back. Ifshe were to, say, take a cue from her partner in crime on &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; and get some vocal lessons in to help her out (and possibly save her voice from early burn-out) she may save herself from a backward slide into vapidity.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I wonder if Paul is a fan of the the self-titled Velvet Underground album, because the mix of &quot;naked&quot; bare's a strong resemblance to Lou Reed's decision to boost the presence on the vocals and bury the instruments a bit to give it that strongly intimate sound.  Nothing wrong with that.<br />I do miss the bits and pieces of musical and coversational shannanigans that gave the original release a little character.  Also missing is the excitement of the couple of live tracks that were originally included.<br />It's doubtful that many people will complain about losing some of the schmaltz that Phil Spector tacked on.  However, reducing Across the Universe to the single guitar, instead of including the droning, chiming accoustic of the original version that Lennon intended (included at the end of the 2nd Anthlology set) is a little disappointing.  And what's the deal with the cheesey new keyboard break in &quot;Winding Road&quot;?  This set may be somewhat &quot;naked&quot;, but there are more than a couple of places where some strategic alterations have occurred.  (How can it be naked when Paul sings both lead and harmony, or plays bass and piano at the same time?)<br />Not bad, but I gotta agree with those who wish the group had released Glyn's originally intended Get Back disc, blemishes and all.
B00005JM02|4.0|In the true spirit of Disney/Pixar classics, such as Monsters, Inc., Toy Story, and Toy Story 2. Finding Nemo is definetly one of the greatest family movies to come out on DVD this year.<br />The graphics of this movie are bright and realistic, it is easy for both children and adults alike to become entranced with the colors and animation.  Under the sea is shown as a bright blue with rushing currents and gurgling bubbles, and other realistic features of the ocean floor.  There is also an excellent depiction of a salt water fish tank in a dentist's office, which is represented realistically as well.<br />The characters in this movie have been brought to life with their human-like personalities and animated voices.  They are truly humorus and touching.  Nemo, the star of this fabulous flick, is a young clown fish who became caught up in an adventure of a lifetime.  His father Marlin, a clown fish as well, also becomes caught up in this fun-filled, family oriented adventure searching for his son.  There are many other characters in Finding Nemo who add to the sense of adventure and family.<br />Finding Nemo also has a lesson to be learned, as most Disney films do.  I  will not give it away, but I will say the story surrounds family relationships and friendship.  For children this is a great movie that impresses the importance of family and friendship in a fun way.  For adults, Finding Nemo is a simple way we are reminded of what is important in life.  This film has a certain family quality that most of us can relate to.<br />In conclusion, Finding Nemo is one of the most entertaining movies of the year.  With its bright graphics, animated characters, warm and touching story line, Finding Nemo is a definite must see for people of all ages.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spears has been known for outdoing herself, and once again she does it. This CD is great! 100 times better than her previous ones. The beats and songs are amazing. You'll get hooked to the CD. I think her voice is also better on this. I think Toxic, The Hook up, Everytime are the best songs on the album. Good Job Britney.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ok. so britney can't sing like whitney houston or christina aguilera. we all know that. This, however, doesn't mean the girl can't sing. She's got her own vocal style and, by the way, has anyone heard Madonna's old stuff? Their voices sound pretty much the same and i dont hear anyone complaining about Madonna. I say this CD is her best. I don't care that shes not the best singer. Shes an awesome dancer, a beautiful person, and all around one of the best entertainers of this generation. It doesnt just take vocal ability to make it in the music industry. Obviously, Britney's got talent. How many singers do you know of that have just &quot;okay&quot; voices, but still manage to produce three (going on four) multi-platinum albums in a row, sell out practically every event they're involved in, are seen all over the telivision, mentioned in just about every magazine or newspaper, and, oh yeah, get a star on the hollywood walk of fame? Not many. Bottom line, Britney's awesome, and &quot;in the zone&quot; delivers. No question.
B0000CFW87|2.0|This CD is boring to me. I love his voice and love him as a person, but the only two songs I can stand to listen to is &quot;You raise me up&quot; and &quot;Oceano&quot;. Wish there would have been more uptempo songs.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is stuff that you have to listen to a few times before it starts to grow on you. This album in awesome in a lot of ways, there`s no question Britney is a huge S e x Symbol and I think that it was time an album completely fit her image, the songs are so cool and sexy, really good to spend a good time... If someone doesn`t like Britney they can easily turn off the TV or the radio but face it Britney will be here for a loooong time.
B000002KGT|4.0|Cranky reviewer are you f**ked in the head, you knock all the classic real rock albums, but then you give metallica's st anger album 5 stars and hilary duffs album 4 stars. F**K you cranky reviewer. By the way i don't own this album, my parents do and they think its a 4 star album. I think this album is fine, however im more into rock and such.

B00005JKC3|3.0|WIERDO movie, even wierder MOVIE making , maybe theres just to many stories,trying to BREAK OUT,kinda like  the HULK,MUCH to ADOs, do this introduce this, THE MOVIE IS like an epic series of scenes,forget the good ones, THE ACTION, pure mayhem THRILLS, its gives the viewer,plenty but they lack A context PLUS this movie is like watching television with the remote stuck on SWITCH,ITS ENDLESS CHANNEL SURFING , hodgepodge scenes thrown at us,a little bit of this and a lot more of that, BOOM bang, smart bomb,KILL THE STORY,BUT LEAVE INTACT the GEE whizzes,excess,often it speeds up just right, its like a dog chasing its OWN tail, you can be left feelin spinNINg, but never giddy, CAUSE THIS MOVIE , lacks the simple,WHAT?

B00000I8NC|4.0|Usually my attempts to widen my musical horizons meet up with something that's less than desirable.  But occasionally something really unique and exciting pops up that makes me reassess the state of music as a whole.  Discovering Brian Eno was one of those watershed moments, and GYBE is becoming another one.  It's such a refreshing change from all of the copycat stuff that gets put out.  Much of the music I really enjoy has a great wide expansive feel to it, and this is no exception.  It's breadth and depth are staggering.  ...  <br />I've also been listening to Labradford (which I think is better) and Do Make Say Think (which is neither better nor worse, just a slightly different take on the same path)  If you like GYBE, try those too.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This &quot;new&quot; CD proves once again that the Fab 4 are still &quot;FAB&quot;!  While some of the differences are quite subtle, my first impression on listening to the new mix was that Ringo's drumming was more &quot;out front&quot; than on the original, as well as a more integral part of the whole.  The voices are also much clearer and give the impression that the boys were enjoying themselves.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's new video *UP!(live in Chicago) is worth the purchase price. Not many concert videos I have watched has actually got me up off my couch, dancing around my house,but his one did. Shania is on her game, her performance skills and relating to her fans make her both entertaining and friendly. It's almost as if you are a fan among the crowd in the video.That said, you will definately be a fan after watching ths video if you aren't already. You too will find yourself dancing and singing along to many of Shania's top hits. I highly recommened!
B00009TB5G|5.0|If you thought that the film you saw in theatres couldn't be better, prepare yourself for the special extended version...it's even better than the Fellowship of the Ring extended version.  You'll love how it fleshes out the story whether or not you've read the books. But enough review because the movie speaks for itself...GET THE EXTENDED VERSION NOW!  See it before Return of the King! You'll be happy you did!
B0000AXE8I|4.0|THE MATRIX RELOADED has seamless CGI special effects, great stunt work, and excellent fight sequences.  The jargon and philosophy might be a little too straining (reminiscent of STAR TREK-GENERATIONS) especially listening to Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) talking passionately of the prophecy, but the film is entertaining. One reason is that, in this second film, we care about these characters even more (Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity) and their exploits in 'The Matrix'. One might think that Neo/Keanu Reeves is the main character, but the film shows this to be an ensemble of cast and characters.  Good to see veteran character actor Anthony Zerbe in a high profile role and Italian actress Monica Bellucci in a pivotal role.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I admit, I was surprised at the quality of her last CD, but ITZ is the best album yet.  With multiple music styles, she tackles them all and they sound AMAZING!  My favorites are MATM, Breathe on Me, Toxic, Outrageous, The Hook Up (My fav), and Everytime.  I bought it the first day, and it's worth it!
B000002UB3|5.0|What can you say about ABBEY ROAD that hasn't been all ready written.  In the ANTHOLOGY series, George Harrison states that 'they' knew it might be their last so they had to 'tidy it up' and make one more good record and the Beatles did not disappoint.  The musicianship is on par.  Listen to Paul McCartney's bass playing on SHE CAME IN THROUGH THE BATHROOM WINDOW and on HERE COMES THE SUN..Excellent! Ringo Starr's drum solo during THE END..Great! George Harrison's complimentary contributions of SOMETHING and '..SUN' are his most perfect compostions that added more weight to the Beatles' song catalogue. Lastly, the guitar battle of Lennon, McCartney, and Harrison in THE END shows that the Beatles knew what rock n roll was.  Overall, one of the best albums in rock history!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I wasn't impressed with &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; to be honest.But being a loyal fan of Brit's former self, I decided to buy this<BR>album of that former reprieve. I'm really glad I did. I've come to<BR>respect her diverse nature, though I didn't enjoy her more perverse songs. Some of the music is very Madonna-esque. But Brit's stepped up to several levels of pop music to bring her fans this album. &quot;Toxic&quot; is probably my favorite, and her ballads, &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Everytime &quot; are really great they show that she doesn't only talk- the girl sings too. Though she doesn't prove the powerhouse she really is with these songs- they are nicely done. &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; demonstrates Brit's rapping ability- which is limited but decent none the less. There is an 80s theme to this song- very Madonna. But it's so jumpy that it kind of just catches you. It does sound as if it came off the soundtrack of a more provactive Nickeloden movie. With producers like R. Kelly and Moby- there's a whole new spin on her music. Brit wrote/co-wrote 8 of the songs on the album. Which I feel is pretty decent for a pop star. Christina may have a voice. But only Brit's got the charm to pull these songs off- and this change. Either way, Brit's come up with some new ground to cover and she does it justice. My ten dollars was well spent.
B0000A36J5|5.0|This is the movie Jackson wanted to release in the theaters, but couldn't.  And people who just see the theatrical version don't know what they are missing.  The added scenes do so much to flesh out other bits of the story (including much-needed characterization of Faramir).  The first few added scenes with Sam and Frodo are excellent: they really show the relationship developed in the FotR, and you understand the burden the ring is putting on Frodo when he lashes out at Sam later in the film.  It is just subtle touches like that which make me wait each year to invest in the extended edition rather than the theatrical.<br />The Gollum statue is finely crafted, and nicely detailed.  I have yet to watch the &quot;Making of the statue&quot; DVD which comes with the gift set, but the book of Gollum sketches is really neat.<br />If I hadn't pre-ordered this back in August, it would be first on my Christmas list this year :) I can't wait to have all 3 volumes standing in my argonath bookends.....
B0000DJZA5|5.0|A great CD, this version has a sound quality that is substantially better than that of the original. The lyrics are much easier to hear, and Paul's bass guitar work from his Fab Four days never sounded so good.   The real standouts are Let It Be, Across the Universe, a version of The Long and Winding Road that is free of Spector's spectre, and George Harrison's I Me Mine, which, to my surprise, has turned out to be the strongest case that Paul's bass guitar has been lacking in the Let It Be that so many of us have come to know.  [...] if there is so much room for improvement for the other releases as there was for Let It Be, then I, among many others, will face a future of buying Beatles material in newer and improved formats while contributing to what will one day be tallied as, if not already, multi-billion record sales of the greatest pop group that ever existed.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The Concert for George is a superb musical experience. If you are a Beatle fan, or a fan of the solo musician and philosopher that was/is George Harrison, this DVD is an emotional and proud experience. Most of you have heard his songs...but the renditions are done with such love, and quiet reverence, it's like hearing them for the first time.  You experience them. All of the biggest names &quot;Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney&quot; in particular, do not grandstand or make this concert about them. I was awestruck by amazing performances by faces I didn't recognize at first and I found myself scrambling to read the booklet inside the keepsake case to see who was performing.  There is superb slide guitar work. Unlike other tribute concerts, most of the renditions here were true to the original recording and no one dared to tamper too much with all George's licks and familiar middle eights. One must mention the Indian music. I know a lot of people who owned copies of &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; and quickly skipped over 'the Indian part&quot;.  You will not want to do that with this DVD! It was the most powerful music I have ever heard. So much so, that it dragged my husband out from watching a Star Trek re-run to give Ms. Shankar the audience she deserved. I agree with many that this version of George's &quot;Inner Light&quot; was just plain gorgeous. All under a lovely serene photograph of George.  I have also now discovered Joe Brown...who performed three of the best songs in the show. The third of which closed the concert and had me weeping from so many mixed emotions. George would have loved it. George was there.  I can't recommend it highly enough.
0060976624|4.0|I would have never guessed that I would even consider reading a book about a PR man for the tobacco industry ... and I certainly could have never imagined that if I did, I'd enjoy it so much!<br />I picked up Thank You For Smoking at the suggestion of a friend, and was pulled into the narrative immediately. The story is so tightly and entertainingly written that I practically inhaled it (pun intended), taking less than a day to finish the book's nearly 300 pages even though for the most part I had to read it a few pages at a time while working at a conference.<br />Author Christopher Buckley pulled off the seemingly impossible here: making a despicable protagonist like Nick Naylor seem sympathetic. I won't go into the way Mr. Buckley does it, but it is definitely worth finding out for yourself.<br />My only complaint is that the ending to the story wraps up a little too neatly, a little too much like Hollywood. It's a weakness, but not a serious enough of a weakness to cloud the value of this original and clever book.
B000007XUQ|5.0|These two CDs include the music on the original Christmas Portrait and An Old Fashioned Christmas albums.<BR>But there are errors in the songs listed as I write this...<BR>here on Cristmas Portrait...First Snowfall etc. is listed twice 11 &amp; 18...missing on the list is the classic Merry Christmas Darling, Christ Is Born, Jingle Bells &amp; Winter Wonderland/Silver Bells/White Christmas medley among others are missing.  <BR>On An Old Fashioned Christmas album...Old Fashioned Christmas is listed twice 10 &amp; 18...the unique version of Santa Claus Is Coming To Town &amp; I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day among others are missing.  <BR>Somewhere along the line someone has done a poor job of listing the songs for this two album set.
B0000CBHOI|4.0|The videos are rich in material but leave you craving for more.  The movies themselves run about 80-90 minutes each, covering a tremendous amount of ground but leave you with just little bits and pieces of the Blues.  There are additional tracks on the DVD's but I was hoping to hear more of Ali Farka Toure and instead got more of Corey Harris.  I like Harris, and I like the way Scorcese followed him on his pilgrimage from Mississippi to Mali, but Toure seemed so subdued on this recording.  It would have been better to see him jam with his own musicians.<br />The movies are reverential in their presentation.  The directors seem cautious in their approach, which surprised me given their own stature in the cinematic world.  Wenders flirts with his musicians the same way he did on the Buena Vista Social Club, without revealing what really makes them tick. However, there is a great mix of music and some fantastic old footage such as a couple of pieces with Son House.  But, it seems to me that Scorcese could have taken this PBS series much further.
0385504209|5.0|Think about this book as a work of fiction.  Great book.  easy read and fast paced.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I could not even watch the whole movie.  This is one of the most pointless and bizzare movies I have ever seen.  I wish I could give it 0 stars.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I think that Peter Jackson has done a superb job on the first and second lord of the rings films. At first, I thought the Two Towers wasn't too good. I am a big Tolkien fan and expected a lot from this movie. But after watching it a couple of times, I really liked this second film. I realized how hard it is to make such a detailed fantasy book into a movie. Of course, the movies will never match up to the books, but they are still great. In the Two Towers extended edition, you'll see a lot of cool clips during the helm's deep battle, hear some lines from the book including bombadil's words from treebeard, and you'll see why faramir acted the way he did with frodo. It isn't true to the book, but this movie, i think, couldn't have been done better.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|Just another movie where the writer/director/producers are trying to pass off their bizzare nightmares as something meaningful.  Wish I could give it 0 stars.
0517053616|5.0|I must say, after reading the \\"review\\" about shakespeare,<br />the one discussing the \\"cult of shakespeare\\"...<br />What is the point of this posting? It's not a review of the<br />particular volume, instead it is a rather caustic opinion of<br />Shakespeare, which focuses on current society's teaching<br />and appreciation of Shakespeare's works, and not<br />the actual works themselves. Why is this relevant, and<br />why has it been posted? Is it entertaining? Are we really<br />interested in his personal criteria for judging literature?<br />In defense of Shakespeare and this volume, whether it be<br />printed nicely or not, to have his works present is better<br />than to not, even if some might say it's only taking up<br />shelve space. I've come to his plays later in life, and<br />of my own volition. I need no glossary or interpreter.<br />Quite simply, there is a reason that Shakespeare is still<br />performed, and written about today, and it has nothing<br />whatsoever to do with this faceless cult conspiracy theory<br />that this guy is referring to. It doesn't exist.<br />What does exist is a great body of work which will provide<br />much pleasure and entertainment. I suggest that the<br />comments made by the cult conspiracy guy be taken with a grain<br />of salt. Some people just can't accept greatness in others,<br />even if they are dead, and must convince themselves that<br />the greatness is imagined.<br />Long Live Shakespeare (cult member since 2003)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|And that is saying a lot.  I knew this was going to be great as i am a huge, if not her biggest, fan.  She did everything I would expect and threw in some more for good measure.  As with any other CD by anyone else there are a few songs that I do not care for, but the ones that I like and love far out number those.  The song &quot;Toxic&quot; is by far my favorite and the song &quot;everytime&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard.  You can also hear a definite influence of Madonnas &quot;Bedtime Story&quot; on songs like &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; and &quot;Touch of my Hand&quot;.  You really cannot lose by getting this CD.  The pics of Britney on the pullout are awesome as well.  She is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful women in the world.  It really does not get any better than her.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Contrary to some [...] opinions, Paul didn't have anything to do with this set. It was approved by Paul Ringo and George (before he passed). 3 engineers were given a load of tapes and given the go-ahead to make something of it, and make something of it they did. The clarity is outstanding and much of this disc is superior to the Spector mix.Kudos to the Abbey Road team, and kudos to the surviving Beatles for giving us a better picture of what this lp should have sounded like from the beginning.
B000068OSK|5.0|I absoultly LOVE this album. its the one that got me into, and stayed in to the white stripes. biting barre chords and innocent drumming patterns are prodominant in this one in particular. this is the album where they first started embarking on an original sound. One More Cup Of Coffee is great for a cover, but I fought Pirrahnahs is perfect as the closing track. from morbid(St.James Infermary) to i-love-you-but-you-dont-love-me(Suzy Lee) to upbeat blues covers(Stop Breaking Down Blues)to 'i hate myself'(when I hear my name) and danceable (Astro) I've said it before, Ill say it again...absolutly brilliant.

B0000TB03W|5.0|Television certainly didnt do this concert any justice. I made it to 3 of Shania's shows in my area this year, front row center and she is full of energy and spunk. Shania is stunningly beautiful both inside and out and oh yeah..........she can defintitely sing. For those of us who couldnt get to this show, this DVD puts you front row center which is the only seat in the house for a true Shania fan, the next best thing to being there.

B000084T18|2.0|i love rap but 50 cent and this album is just average and not worth the hype. &quot;What Up Gangsta&quot; is the best track on this album, everything else is 50 cent selling his image. He got shot nine times, im sure that hurt, but since when does being shot make you a good rapper??. He was incarcerated, so was Sacramento's X-Raided, and he recorded 2 albums from prison and has a way better flow than 50 cent, no hype for X-Raided. 50 cent tries to be 2pac, he isnt, and his disses on Ja Rule were funny on the 8 mile soundtrack, ok that got him his boost, now he can lay off, oops, he feels he has to do it in every track except very few on this album, gets annoying. He needs to realize he is no more better than Ja Rule, they are both equally mediocre. Anybody who labels this gangsta rap is disturbed. Want gangsta rap, with some actual good rappers? check out RBL Posse, IMP, Celly Cell, Spice 1(old stuff), most of those bay area rappers. Always make sure you buy an E-40 cd before you even think of touching a 50 cent cd.
B000089RVX|1.0|Did anyone watch the 31st music awards?<BR>hehehe This &quot;band&quot; was nominated for &quot;best pop-rock&quot;! And to make things even more humiliating, it got beaten by Speed Metal god Justin Timberlake! lol<BR>But, i thought this &quot;band&quot; was something &quot;new&quot; because a female is the vocalist and because its &quot;new wave goth&quot; lol<BR>Did everyone also see them live? The singer is not that good live and the guitars seem sloppy.<br />These guys are as fake as rubber dog sh_t and its a joke that they are this popular. Dont buy this cd, there are other bands out there with femals singers eg Nightwish.
B0000E1WNV|1.0|I purchased my copy today and also found a defective second CD. I tried it on my DVD player as well as my PS2 and the same thing happens. There is no cursor to select the program. However, if I hit enter, the concert ultimately starts. While that would be tolerable, there is no way to access the bonus material. There's going to have to be a major recall on this one. A big disappointment!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's new video Up! (Live In Chicago) is worth purchasing. A complete set of the best performances ever.<BR>This is a must have for any Shania fan.<BR>What are you waiting for GO BUY IT NOW!!
B0000DZEE3|5.0|The Chilis confirm their reputation as one of the best live bands on the planet. This incredible performance, filmed in August in front of over 80,000 people, gives a glimpse of how 4 extremely talented people come together and become more than the sum of their parts.<BR>The Chili Peppers have always been about the fusion of different styles of music to create a unique sound all their own. The blend of funk and rock has always been at the core, with pop, blues and rap dancing in and out of their music. Their sound continues to evolve, and this concert is a showcase for what they are all about.<BR>Anthony, Flea, and Chad are all fantastic musicians and performers, and you could drop any guitar player in there and they would still be a great band. What takes this band to the next level and in my mind the best band out there is John Fruchante.<BR>John really shines in this show, adding layers of sound and melody to the songs beyond the studio versions. His ability to create new and different sounds with his playing is truly inspired. He can play funk, rock, blues and pop guitar with equal skill, and his instinct to back off at times and and let the other members shine is the strength of the band.<BR>Being a Chili Peppers fan from way back, I have followed this band for some time. They continue to amaze me, and this concert was even better than expected. The songs are mostly from Californication and By the Way, but there is enough older material to keep long time fans happy.<BR>My only complaint is that the director keeps changing camera shots every 3 seconds. There is plenty to look at, but I found the contant changes distracting.<BR>If you are a fan of music, you should check out this show and see what one of the most talented and creative bands out there today is up to.<BR>Fantastic show!
0316666343|3.0|I found it interesting that this book was written from a fantasy point of view and yet the author made sure to be realistic about how murderers get away. When Susie possessed Ruth's body that's where it all fell apart for me. First of all they both violated Ruth, Susie was still 14 technically but her boyfriend was a grown man, and how in the world was he able to get aroused under those circumstances?  And the serial killer of children had just driven by, you'd think Susie might have mentioned that and that her body was in the sinkhole where they were standing. I liked the icicle but think it should have killed him while he was in prison. I gave this book 3 stars though because it was unique and intriguing.
B000002UAR|2.0|There are a few good songs on this album, but much of it is just not compelling.  Not in the same league as the wonderfully produced, written and performed &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|If you are a fan of George this is a must-buy CD.  Every cut on side two is awesome.  Best cuts:  Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers cover of &quot;I Need You,&quot; complete with a jangly Rickenbacker sound; Paul's ukulele version of &quot;Something,&quot; with Eric Clapton taking over in the middle; Petty, Jeff Lynne and George's son Dhani singing &quot;Handle With Care&quot; (where was Bob Dylan?); and Ringo's &quot;Photograph.&quot;  Side one is interesting--if you recall the Concert For Bangladesh and George's facination with Indian music (ie: Inner Light) you'll give it a play or two.  Thanks to all the musicians for putting together such a wonderful tribute to a great individual!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Phil Spector did a nice job on the original. Both versions of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; are very good - the orchestra backed Spector production, and this new release. <br />Much of the remainder of the album is the same as the original release (so what's the big complaint with the original again?), therefore this release doesn't add that much.<br />Nevertheless this product says &quot;The Beatles&quot; on it, so everyone says that it has to get five stars.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Well done above for writing the biggest review of a film about one shot of a man's naked body ever.<br />Now, the film. It's biggest flaws seem to stem from the script, Soderbergh's own. After his recent, brilliantly scripted movies Out Of Sight, The Limey, Erin Brokovich and Ocean's 11, Soderbergh should take this latest offering as proof that Sex, Lies And Videotape was a one-off. Not only is the dialogue from the present day story vague, it's also very clumsy and banal. I can practically see Soderbergh struggling to write realistic dialogue but not finding the words. I can also see him struggling to fill the space inbetween Kelvin arriving on the station and his dead wife showing up. Somewhere around there should have been the mystery of what happened to the crew, but there's nothing. When Mrs Kelvin shows up, things perk up a bit - Soderbergh had obviously got to the bit he was interested in - but even then the terrific acting (check out the scene where Clooney first sees McElhone on the station, or the \\"You keep saying that\\" line - phew) is tested to the limit by the clumsy dialogue.<br />As you can see, it's easy to find faults with this film. What's harder is expressing what's so great about. Performances, asthetic beauty and haunting atmosphere aside, the highlights of the film are not in the main storyline but in the flashbacks. Here, several scenes showing the faulty relationship back on Earth are improvised, and so not hindered by Soderbergh's uninvolving, beat-around-the-bush nonsense. Particularly effective (and moving) is the scene where Kelvin finds out what his wife has done. The more typical Soderbergh cinematography comes into it's own, and the two central performances astound, especially McElhone.<br />All in all, it comes down to where you, the viewer, are coming from as to whether it is the film's pros or cons are most prominent. If the pros, then the film's great acting, visuals and tone will carry you through the mess. If the cons, then it's just a series of pretty pictures.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is a must-have for all Shania fans.  Even if you saw the special on NBC, you need this DVD.  The televised special was edited and in this edition, you are able to see and hear songs that didn't make it on TV.  Shania's tour is one of the hottest tours going right now, and seeing this will get you all psyched up for it.  I picked it up last night and have already seen it 3 times.  I am fortunate enough to see her live next month and this is a great concert to get me ready for it.  Don't miss one of country's talented artist and get your copy.  You won't regret it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania really shows you why she should have been voted the entertainer of the year at the CMA awards.  Her performances are so hot-wired that you can't help but want to get off the couch and do a little moving of your own.<br />unclechaz

B0000DD7LB|5.0|hey everyone! This album has to be one of Britney's best yet.  I'm generally not a fan of any kind of pop music but this has pulled me in on her(the songs have a tendency to get stuck in your head)I'm into punk rock/pop punk music but alls I can say about IN THE ZONE is...WOW!!!...Now, she has a couple of &quot;RACY&quot; songs(TOUCH OF MY HAND &amp; BREATHE ON ME) but &quot;Touch of my Hand&quot; is hands down one of the best on the CD! BUT, the best song on the whole album is &quot;EVERYTIME&quot; Supposably it is her song to justin but who knows..Anyway, this song is GREAT and a SERIOUS one at that.  Now Britney doesn't have the best voice in the world but what she is trying to do is put a point out there...and i give her big props for that!<br />I won't drag this on anymore, but i deffinatley reccomend this album!<BR>                                                 ~*~PEACE~*~
B000001FNL|4.0|A fine sampling of Bee Gee tunes.  Jive Talking and Nights On Broadway are the two big hits.  However, the third single, Fanny(Be Tender With My Love)is my favorite in this batch.  Super passionate vocals coupled with super hooks especially around the chorus make it a joy with every listen.<br />There are many other delectable tunes.  Their cover of Olivia Newton John's Come On Over is quite touching.  There are plenty of pleasing funky excursions including Edge of the Universe and Wind of Change.  Country Lanes is another pleasant tune with a charming vocal harmony between the brothers.<br />This may be the Bee Gees strongest recording before their forays into disco music.  A solid four stars for sure.
B00005JL9B|5.0|One thing to be said about Japanese horror/extreme action is that it could seldom, if ever, be accused of being formulaic.  Some of the most ingenious storylines ever thought of have come from Japanese films(see Ringu, Suicide Club, Kairo, Uzumaki).  But while the ideas are in place the problem is often with the execution of the film.  Overacting, cheap special effects and slow pacing between action scenes have often plagued the Japanese films I have bore witness to.  Not so with Battle Royale.  The concept is pure genius and believe me, the execution even better.<br />Kitano is a strict teacher whose source of pride comes from being able to instill discipline in the young.  He is for the most part very successful at this and highly respected among his students.  Then one afternoon, an out-of-control student who he reprimands stabs him in the back of the leg.  Following this incident Kitano quits his teaching job and disappears out of sight.  Fast forward to a few years later.  A group of 42 students(who appear to be in their mid-teens) board a bus to go on a class trip.  At some point during the bus ride a sleeping gas is unleashed and all the students fall asleep.  When they wake up, they find themselves cramped in a classroom and with a tight metallic necklace tied around their necks.  To their great surprise, in through the door walks Kitano, who most have had as a 7th grade teacher.  Kitano informs them of a game he has devised called Battle Royale that they have been randomly selected to be a part of.  Battle Royale is Kitano's sadistic vengeful way of getting back to the youths he feels lack discipline and `mock' adults.<br />The rules behind Battle Royale are this; The students are now on a remote island where all 42 of them will be pitted against each other in a game to the death.  Each student is given a backpack that includes water, food, a weapon, a compass and a map of the island.  The last person standing gets to go home free.  There is a catch however.  They only have 3 days.  If more than one person is left standing after 3 days, their collars will all blow.  The island is also mapped with regions that contain shifting `danger zones', of which Kitano informs them of over a loud speaker.  If someone is still standing in a danger zone after Kitano makes the announcement their collar will explode.<br />From the moment the rules of Battle Royale are transmitted to the kids, the film's frenetic pace never lets up.  Director Kinji Fukasaku pulls absolutely no punches here, making this a no-holds-barred extreme version of Lord of the Flies that is compulsively watchable.  The acting performances he is able to draw out of these kids is remarkable.  Part of what Fukasaku seems to be trying to achieve with this film is to give us a character study of how different some kids can be from others and how differently they can react when faced with peril.  One group commits suicide instantly, refusing to be a part of the sadistic game they're forced to play.  Another group spends their time shacked up in a cabin, trying to figure out a way to hack through Kitano's system so they can get the collars off their necks.  One group of women simply decide to live as normally as they usually would by cooking, exchanging stories, staying civilized.  And of course, some kids choose to become killing machines, determined to be the one to get out of the game alive.<br />Director Fukasaku's choice of filming locations is absolutely stunning, from the lush tropical jungles, to the edge of the sea, the lighthouse, etc.  The film's image looks surprisingly sharp and clear for a non-hollywood production.  The only thing I would have to complain about are the English subtitles.  They are filled with grammatical errors and poor sentence structuring.  I also got the impression that many parts of the dialogue were missing or were not presented accurately.  Hopefully, Battle Royale will see a North American DVD reissue that will be dubbed or at least have better subtitles.  I'm not hoping for a North American remake however.  It would probably be a PG-13 `message' film starring the likes of Frankie Muniz and the Olsen twins. Ugh!!<br />Battle Royale is an action classic not to be missed.  It's adrenaline-fuelled pace will appeal to action fans, it's bloody carnage and gore will appeal to horror fans.  This is a film that puts just about any North American action film to shame. A modern cult classic that deserves a wider distribution.t least have better subtitles.  I'm not hoping for a North American remake however.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|to really appreciate this version is - - some songs are missed however for the most part these are fresher and more alive in my opinion.<br />But - I think that they both are great - each in their own way.  I did miss the bantering on the first version - - mostly from John - that had made it fun.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have never been a Britney fan, I think she is pretty but her voice just sucks. But this cd is great! Her songs are really mature and catchy. I like it because its not the pop sound, she talks about sexuality and i like that because shes not 16 anymore. I love toxic its a great song and Boom Boom awsome beat. I want to give props to Brit for the songs she helped on, from writing non to write almost half. I think the lyrics make up for what might be missing from her voice.
B00004ZBVG|4.0|High octane action and the perseverance of some of the leads elevate \\"Bat-21\\" to that higher level of Vietnam movie.  Basically the story of how a high-level intelligence officer eludes capture after being shot down behind enemy lines in Vietnam, \\"Bat-21\\" is relentless and never exploitative.  Hackman is Iceal Hambleton, a USAF colonel who fights the war in Vietnam from the offices and golf courses of Saigon.  Tasked to identify communist missile sites, he boldly (and unwisely) tags along on an EB-66, an unarmed electronic warfare bird loaded with intelligence equipment.  The sole survivor after being shot down, Hambleton finds himself pursued by the enemy who apparently appreciate his value as a prisoner.  While the enemy (was it the NVA or the Cong? I could never tell) is unable to find Hambleton, they prove more than capable of making life hell for the rescue choppers sent to rescue him - including the crew of a \\"Jolly Green\\" cut to pieces over an enemy-held village.  While on the ground, Hambleton stays in contact with Bart Clark (Danny Glover), a USAF captain who flies spotter missions for more heavily armed bombers.  (Clark flies FAC - from his slow-moving Cessna, he finds targets for the strike fighters, marking them with white-phosphorous rockets).  Knowing that the enemy is monitoring them, Hambleton and Clark work out a code that posits the map of Vietnam as a big golf course.  As rescue attempts become more dangerous, Clark finds himself drawn ever deeper into the rescue, climaxing in his going rogue when his superiors throw in the towel.<br />\\"Bat-21\\" isn't really a classic.  There's plenty of thrilling action, and the script even manages to find room for irony (as when Clark pauses during a radio conversation with Hambleton while he zaps a few communist troops).  Still, nothing really convincingly explains how Hackman manages to elude capture...by anybody (the script makes clear that he is definitely no Rambo).  The film also breezes over the biggest irony - that Hackman's code is based on his smarts on the golf course rather than the battlefield.  If the film excels over cheap action flicks, it's in the determination and exhaustion of its leads and persistent refusal to avoid Hollywood glory.  Also, unless anybody knows of another film, this is the only one I've seen that captures the critical role played by Forward Air Controllers in both prosecuting the air war in Vietnam, and rescuing those airmen nearly lost.
B00005JM02|5.0|Cute Flick<br /> As I scanned through scenes and tried to find the perfect quote for this review, I thought, \\"Wow! There are so many great lines and most are enhanced by hilarious facial expressions - I just can't choose!\\"<BR> It is true - countless scenes contain awesome adult and kid humor.  Each time I watch \\"Finding Nemo,\\" I find new comedy and laugh a little harder.  This movie is great for all ages - from 3 to 93.<BR> At a recent family party, both children and adults enjoyed this wonderfully crafted Disney-Pixar film.  Many adults laughed as they quoted Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), \\"Hey, Mr. Grumpy Gills,\\" or \\"I can speak whale!  Whaaaatt'sss goiiiinng onnnn herrrrre?\\"  Although the kids did tend to wander in and out of the room (as kids do), they demanded that it be played.  Whenever they have a chance to watch a movie, they choose \\"Finding Nemo.\\"<BR> The voices fit the roles perfectly.  Ellen DeGeneres does a wonderful job with Dory - her voice completes the off-the-wall character.  Albert Brooks perfectly personifies Marlin as an overly concerned parent.  The Australian accents are fun to listen to and attempt to mimic.  Crush also certainly adds to the ocean atmosphere with an obvious surfboarder's tone.<BR> My favorite characters are the seagulls.  I roll with laughter because of their general character - they are shown in large, annoying groups and often squawk, \\"Mine!\\" whenever food is nearby.  You have to see the movie to fully appreciate the comedy and high-quality animation of this film.<BR> However, I did enjoy \\"Monsters Inc.\\" and both \\"Toy Story\\" movies better, but this film is a must addition for any Disney film collector.
B00004XQ83|5.0|A breath of fresh air, musically.  This CD contains a collection of great old fashioned country music.  Nineteen songs of spiritual enlightenment, hope, and the reality of the Great Depression.  If you liked the movies musical selections, you'll love the CD.

B00008RH1H|5.0|Of all Shakespeare's great tragedies, Macbeth is the play that people find the most troubling. It is the one work in Shakespeare's canon that comes closest to Greek tragedy with its outward inevitability and its conclusions seemingly predestined by the fates. We are also asked to identify with a murderer--an intelligent intriguing complex murderer to be sure--but still a murderer. This creates within us a moral tension not present in more clear-cut tragic figures like Hamlet and Lear, and this only leads to a greater incentive to excuse Macbeth as a victim of fate. It is easier to identify with a murderer who has no choice in his actions since his lack of choice absolves us of the guilt we might otherwise feel for sympathizing with him.<br />Kurosawa leaves us no such outlet. His Macbeth is an unrepentant schemer, opportunist and murderer. That he feels passing pangs of conscience is due to the remnants of his humanity, remnants that by the end have been totally subsumed by his overarching ambition. This is a subtly different presentation from the angst ridden second guessing Macbeths so often portrayed in western productions, and when Kurosawa's Macbeth meets his death, we are struck not so much by the waste of a potentially good man as we are by how completely he is destroyed through the workings of divine justice.<br />I am not going out of my way to be bookish here. This analysis is meant to show how well Kurosawa understands the moral message conveyed by the play as he constructs a Macbeth who, in spite of the ghastliness of his character, both fascinates us and draws our admiration. It is easy to admire obvious heroes and just as easy to condemn obvious villains and Hollywood has made a fortune from grinding away at this formulaic mill over the years. However, we are cast into contrary waters when we find ourselves admiring sympathetic villains and condemning failed heroes. Such characters are too much like our secret selves and their presence forces us into uncomfortable self-examination. This is Kurosawa's purpose: he is forcing each of us to ask how much like Macbeth we really are. How much blood would we spill for our own chance at a throne?<br />And Kurosawa does this under an all but impossible handicap. He cannot use Shakespeare's glorious language, so in its stead, he substitutes his genius in the filmmaker's craft: mood, lighting, shading, contrast; and most of all, imagery, both the shrewd and the shocking, like the famous closing scene in which justice is delivered with altogether gruesome finality. Nor does it hurt that he has access to one of the finest actors in cinema. Toshiro Mifune puts in an inspired performance as an unswervingly driven Macbeth.<br />This film and 'Ran', Kurosawa's later Shakespearean adaptation, are both bittersweet experiences. Kurosawa never had the chance to direct a production in the Bard's native tongue. He lived and filmed in a time when it was unthinkable for a major western production to be given into the hands of a Japanese director, so although we have had many notable interpretations of Shakespeare from many notable directors over the years, the now lost prospect of a definitive version from one of the best directors in history can only evoke regret.<br />This film is unusual in that it may appeal even to people who do not like Shakespeare. In sacrificing the language for his Japanese audience, Kurosawa is forced to compensate with his theatrical ingenuity, and this has the ironic effect of making his version more accessible to those who have always been put off Shakespeare because of the demands of the language. Against this, the acting is comprised of bold gestures and pregnant pauses, a style that may strike some as stilted and affected, but which actually comes from traditional Japanese Noh theatre and which grows on you and becomes more natural as the film progresses.<br />This is not a film for mass audiences, but if you like intelligent atypical challenging fare andare not afraid of subtitles, then this surprisingly original adaptation will make you think as well as enthral and entertain you.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I think this CD sux. It sounds like Britney is trying way to hard to be and sound like Madonna. I liked her old Cd's alot better at least in them she wasn't trying to be someone she isn't.
B00005JKN9|3.0|A troubling movement persists in art these days that invests brutality and depravity with a patina of panache. Apparently, if perversion is presented with enough flair, the professional critics and the viewing public can be conned into thinking it edifying.<br />This is how sociopaths, murderers, and parasites achieve glory. In an older simpler age, they were dismissed as the scum of society. In our more sophisticated one, they are elevated into New Age Philosophers, spouting pearls of &quot;street&quot; wisdom, feral insight and anti-heroism. Where we once honoured &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, it is now &quot;death, nihilism and the dregs of despair&quot;.<br />This movie is about death, nihilism and the dregs of despair. As such, it is sadly appropriate to our brutish times. The characters are psychopathic prima divas addicted to the sound of their own voices even more than they are to killing. There is such a profusion of soliloquies, oratory and high-flown rhetoric that Scorcese is clearly playing to Shakespeare. He manages to achieve a pale success: imitating the Bard's method while failing his larger purpose.<br />This is a revenge play. A son tries to avenge the death of his father, but must first overcome his own reluctance, a reticence that stems from self-doubt and concern about usurping the natural order. Sound familiar? It should. Shakespeare dealt with this thesis in one of his greatest plays. But unfortunately, this movie isn't Hamlet, hard as it may try.<br />And that is the essence of its failing. Hamlet's vengeance exists within a larger moral framework, and comes at a high price. &quot;'Vengeance is mine,' saith the Lord&quot;, and Hamlet pays for his presumption with his life, daring to appropriate to himself a justice reserved for the divine. But this film panders to vengeance. The anti-hero kills and then walks off into the sunset with the girl. In contrast to Hamlet, there is no moral cost. &quot;Go thou and do likewise&quot;, says the film, and in saying it, exposes the corruption that claims its soul.<br />There is a scene in this movie where the antagonist tells us how he lost his eye and both the protagonist and the audience are spellbound by the quality of the telling. Daniel Day Lewis embodies his character so consummately and Scorcese films the scene so masterfully that we watch mesmerized as this psychopath, with a lyricism verging on poetry, embarks on a long soliloquy describing his fight, his disgrace, his self-styled atonement and his eventual murder of the man who spared his life. It takes a steadfast moral sense to reject the depraved philosophy of a man whose twisted idea of honour necessitates the killing of the one who let him live. &quot;I buried him in his blood,&quot; says Bill the Butcher. &quot;Of all those I have killed, he was the only one worth remembering.&quot; Later, he is himself killed in a pool of his own blood, and only after he too first spares the life of his future killer. And of all those whom Amsterdam Vallon kills, we suspect that Bill the Butcher is also the only one worth remembering.<br />A marvellous device. The killer's code comes full circle. But there is something wrong here. Isn't this an affirmation of the Butcher's philosophy? Doesn't Vallon, in the act of killing the Butcher, validate what the Butcher stands for?<br />The power of this film comes from such technique: psychopaths are given heroic stature; anti-heroes are so anti-heroic that they are beyond redemption; lives come full circle, then spiral inward into destruction; the most accomplished of storytelling techniques are used in the service of the most deplorable of human specimens. It goes on. I am sure film buffs can cite dozens of perfectly executed samples of the filmmaker's craft: technique turned on the clever lathe of genius. But what is all of this genius dedicated to? The advancement of a philosophy expounding death, nihilism and despair.<br />The anti-hero shouldhave died in this film. That would have saved this story by giving it a moral heart and allow it to partake of tragedy. Like Hamlet, Amsterdam Vallon would have achieved a standing in death unattainable in life. He could have symbolized the understanding that vengeance exacts a price and leads to a cycle of death. Instead, we are given a moral perversion. Scorcese tells us that vengeance belongs not to the Lord, but to he who wields the longest knife. It's okay to kill, so long as the man I kill is worse than the man I am.<br />Judged by its technique, this film deserves five stars. Not many films achieve such mastery of method. But judged by its purpose, it is a failure. Speaking to nothing, it deserves nothing. Your enjoyment of this film will depend on how much you value its virtuosity over its degeneracy.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|After the first five minues of each fight sequence, the story could have been shortened.
B00005JM0B|1.0|This movie has all of the inevitability of Greek tragedy without any of its virtues. It is a stupid cynical manipulative affair with plot machinery so clumsy that one can see it clanking away in every scene.<br />It starts with a by now formulaic introduction, segues into a by now formulaic car chase, is leavened with by now formulaic wisecracks, uttered by now formulaic characters. If you never thought a car chase could be tedious, you have only to sit through fifteen long minutes of this one: the first of three. The filmmakers asked themselves how they could outdo the car chases in the previous film and settled on sheer mass. Since Arnie had already defeated full sized semi-trailers filled with gasoline and liquid nitrogen, this time, there was nowhere to go but a mobile crane. As this series grinds its way into puerile sequeldom, expect logging trucks, cement mixers and wide load transports. It never once occurred to the cretins responsible for this movie that they might, just might, do away with the car chases altogether and build excitement on, say, intrigue or suspense. Naw--that would involve actual INVENTION and CREATIVITY, and why go to such trouble when the consuming public can be cynically manipulated into spending their hard earned cash on recycled toxic waste?<br />The plot for this turkey is lifted wholesale from the last movie, but differs just enough to extinguish all hope. It holds out no message of vision or redemption. Nothing will stave off the coming Armageddon. Free will is futile, the struggle to shape our future is pointless and our aspirations are of utterly no consequence. Yummy.<br />This movie is nothing but a two-hour trailer for its too predictable sequel. Its intent is not to entertain so much as to extend a franchise. Consequently, it doesn't even pretend to care enough for its characters to give them interesting personalities or good dialogue, and it treats its alternate world as nothing more than a backdrop on which to flaunt mayhemand special effects. This movie distracts us with diversionary tactics, then picks our pockets clean with the skill of a pro. 'Cynical' doesn't begin to do it justice. It is crassly manipulative, remorselessly bleak and unforgivably stupid. Watch it at the risk of your self-respect.
B00000JLWW|1.0|Forget all the hype. This film is just about cashing in on special effects, a pitiful romance, Cate Winslet as the pretty female lead, and Leonardo Di Craprio as the other pretty female lead. The best part of this film is the ending where Leonardo freezes to death on a large icecube. I cheered at that point.
B00005JLEU|5.0|What a glorious, glorious labour of love. After watching it, I felt like hugging myself. Calling this film an 'animation' and thus lumping it together with the childish fantasies turned out by lesser talents doesn't do it justice, for this work of art deserves comparison to the best in any genre.<br />This is a film that has complex imperfect heroes, no villains, trials more internal than external, a world more vibrant than our own, a spirituality so deep as to reach the metaphysical, and yet will delight a girl of ten as much as a lifelong moviegoer of ninety. It is also surreal in tone, lyrical in composition, invokes tension and suspense without malevolence, and the filmmaker achieves all of this in an animated cartoon. `Spirited Away' is a work of sheer genius.<br />This film has pity and compassion, love and redemption, hidden strength and discovered courage, turbulence harnessed to an inner harmony; but it never strikes a false note nor succumbs to maudlin sentiment. Through gentle humour and understated dignity, it shows so much respect for the intelligence of its audience that I wanted to kiss the director's hand.<br />Calling this film a fairy tale just won't do. Unlike western animation, its magic is deep down, at the very roots of its make-believe world, so deep that it is worked into the very fabric of the story. There is no faerie flying around sprinkling pixie dust, no bubbling cauldrons, no evil-incarnate stepmother and no goodness-personified prince charming; nothing so obvious or so crass. Instead, the world of spirits into which our little heroine lands is as natural as breathing. In this world, humans are the intruders, and as gross material entities, it is we who bring disorder and upset to their realm.<br />It is not easy describing what makes this film so special, because the reasons range from the very small to the very large. At the small end, the film's eye for detail is simply marvellous. Even the act of a little girl putting on her shoes is given such character that we pause to admire the filmmakers' respect for children. At the large end, this film shares with us a journey of spiritual awakening. Our little heroine grows over the course of the film from a self-pitying self-absorbed little mouse into a loving openhearted daring soul.<br />But a word of caution: this is not standard cartoon fare. It assumes an intelligent audience and therefore dispenses with a paint-by-numbers plotline. Indeed, it isn't even about plot but about character, places, feelings, moods, and most of all, themes. For example, a recurring theme is that of purging. Various characters throw up throughout the film and this may disturb the fainthearted. But, if one is familiar with oriental thought, expelling poison to cleanse oneself is a common cultural theme and does not provoke the same disgust that it does in occidental cultures. Indeed, after our little heroine replenishes the river spirit, his gift to her is the medicine of purging. Later in the story, she saves a number of her friends by putting it to good use.<br />Obviously, this is a film that must be approached with some thought. Unlike most western animations, one cannot view it while idling in neutral. It has much that is beautiful and transcendent, but it also has terror and pain, and it demands our most careful consideration. Those unwilling to invest the required effort will get nothing out of it and had best stick with Bambi. Yet, for all its demands, this is a film that remains accessible even to children. Younger viewers may even have an advantage over their parents because they will approach it with open minds unconstrained by western styles and conventions. For them, the film's symbolism may not be apparent, but the filmmakers have applied such symbolism so gracefully that it will still be felt if not noticed, and this will be all that matters.<br />This film rewards open minds. To fully appreciate it, one must cast away ones preconceptions about animation.Western practice and tradition has sadly fenced animation into a marginal niche by considering it children's fare that is incapable of higher artistic expression. 'Spirited Away' is Hayao Miyazaki's exuberant response. It deserves the same consideration and accolades that we habitually heap on 'real' films and is frankly so far above the excrement endlessly churned out by Hollywood that it inhabits a different plane. This film deserved the Oscar in 2001, not for 'Best Animated Film', but for 'Best Picture'. It really is that good.
B000060OFT|1.0|William Shakespere will be rolling in his grave over this travesty. Why did they take a wonderful story and &quot;gangsterise&quot; it? As far as I can tell, the only purpose of this film was for Leonardo Di Caprio to prance around the screen for his teeny bopper fans and pretend that he can act. A total waste of time.
6305181772|1.0|This movie exposes so much of what is wrong with American cinema. It betrays its heritage, confuses action for suspense, substitutes plot twists for intelligence, worships formula, and takes cynical manipulation of its audience to new heights.<br />Its worst crime is its betrayal of its heritage. The original TV series embodied something rare in Hollywood: the recognition that a team is more than just the sum of its components. There were no 'stars' in the original TV production because the ascendancy of any one character would have destroyed the concept of teamwork that defined the very essence of the series. The only other production to understand this concept so clearly--and not coincidentally, to achieve similar success and staying power--is the ensemble drama \\"Law and Order\\".<br />This movie not only ignores that central fact, but takes malicious delight in destroying it. Its 'star' is so narcissistic and egocentric that he bought the rights to a series about teamwork and corrupted it into a one-man vanity show.<br />I actually looked forward to seeing this movie when it was initially released. I had remembered the series with fondness and had hoped for a rebirth of its ideas. Stupid me. I don't know if I was more foolish expecting humility from Tom Cruise or scruples from Hollywood.<br />The brutishness of this movie is almost as bad as its betrayal. The TV series was about not just teamwork, but finesse. Characters as often conned their way into restricted areas or out of trouble as made use of stunts and fancy gadgets. This was what the masks were all about. But in this movie, it's all about acrobatics and toys. There are so many stunts and gadgets (and so little else) that the movie becomes nothing more than a spitting contest between itself and the James Bond franchise.<br />This movie is a betrayal of trust. (...)
0671027387|5.0|After reading the Davinci code I had to read more Dan Brown.  I read Angels and Demons and was very impressed.  Execellent story, and similar to Davinci Code.  I just finished Deception Point and I loved it!  Great mystery, suspense, thriller.  I couldn't put it down.  I have heard they are making a movie of the Davinci Code, but I would rather see Deception Point on the big screen!  A must read for any fan of mystery/sci-fi/polital/thrillers!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I gotta admit the Beatles rule. I will almost never award a Beatles album less than 5 stars. But alas, this one is the exception. The removal of Phil Spector's influence from this album was definitely welcome. But it is obvious that the choice of what was left over leaves something to be desired. First off, the best song on this is Across the Universe, that is great. John Lennon at his best, arguably one of his best compositions ever, almost totally acoustic guitar and John on this one, almost worth the entire admission price. But Let it Be is dissappointing. There is a version of Let it Be that includes the ripping distorted guitar solo up front in the mix. I had that version on an Import LP copy of Let it Be that was breathtaking. But this newer version has replaced the guitar solo with the noodling tremolo/leslie speaker-laden noodlings by Harrison, and it doesn't build or go anywhere for me. I think that they took away the interesting tomtom beat that was apparent in the last verse as well. Some of these things were what made the song really great. They're gone now and the song lays inert, doesn't build and has less emotional power. Elsewhere on the disc like on I Me Mine, again it sounds like Ringo's drumming is further back in the mix, or that they used noise reduction that takes away the brightness and attack of the drums and cymbals. So the production process is a matter of choices. In this case I was just somewhat dissappointed with the direction they took. But Across the Universe is AWESOME. Everyone should hear this cut at least. ....
B00005JM02|5.0|Of course I loved the movie etc.. I've never been much in to animation and would probably have continued to successfully avoided it except for a certain birth some years ago. So I've watched a lot of animation, and the animation that I don't ever hate is Pixar. In fact, I quite like it. Nemo is a delicious new beginning for them - dealing with parenting and family. Love the humor as always and the pace and the visuality - everything. More female characters wouldn't be terrible of course yadda yadda...<br />Anyway, given that it came out in May 2003, and the main character is named Marlin, how obvious was it that Florida would win the 2003 World Series!?!?? Clearly there's some sort of force at work here - all that positive karma attached itself to that bunch of pretty good guys in Miami. Heh heh..
B0000DJZA5|5.0|[...] This is not REVOLVER or ABBEY ROAD - let's get this straight.  And LET IT BE was never their best album.  But it's still The Beatles, and still far beyond in quality than most music today, let alone in their time.  [...] Bottom line, it's not the GET BACK album, but instead LET IT BE...NAKED (unfortunate title aside) is TRUE to the original premise of the album - NO OVERDUBS (which is why \\"Let It Be\\" has a different solo).  For something that is supposed to be raw, it does sound awfully polished, I will admit.  The addition of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" (in a different take) is a great attraction here, and for those missing \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\", the Fly On The Wall CD showcases them and some very interesting conversation, as well as many interesting tracks, a Beatle-sung snatch of George's \\"All Things Must Pass\\", John singing \\"Child Of Nature\\" (early version of \\"Jealous Guy\\"), and two really early Lennon/McCartney songs (and no, Paul didn't have the credits swapped this time). It's a great taster for the upcoming DVD (and it is coming).  In summation, this is an ALTERNATE version of LET IT BE.  Buy the 1970 original and this and enjoy BOTH.  In short, this album is not meant to replace or better the original but instead should be PRESERVED alongside with it.  And for those who feel this was done without George's wishes - he personally gave his blessing before his death two years ago.  And I'm sure John wouldn't have too much to disagree with here either.
B0000CABBW|5.0|This movie is a great example of a young girl's moxie and her community benefitting as a result. Also meets my requirements of the characters undergoing a change during the movie - her grandfather completely transforms from a yesterday man to a today man (in terms of gender). Regarding the DVD itself, the deleted scenes were great to see - I always thought they would have been good to be in the movie (except for the terrible one, of course). <BR>I look forward to watching this movie whenever things get me down!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Haven't heard it.  Will never hear it.  Would never want to hear it.  A Madonna-wannabe and a terrible &quot;artist&quot;.  Can't wait til she's washed-up...and it won't be long.  14 min and counting...
B000008GAC|1.0|It is sad that the &quot;edited&quot; version of this cd is still filthy, yes, they are great musicians and have great music; however, why does a band or anyone for that matter feel it is necessary to be profane--for the money? This is why I stopped litening to rock music for fifteen years, and started listening to jazz, (most jazz music does not have words and the musicians have great technical ability like many rock musicians). I will always love rock music, my roots are there; however, I will never accept profanity. Sorry, 5 stars for the music, and zero stars for the profanity.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|You don't need \\"20/20\\" vision to realize BMG should have never offered to extend a new contract to \\"Diva Houston\\". I used to be a die hard HOUSTON FAN (I even enjoyed parts of her last studio recording), however on this CD, we witness an artist slip sliding down the \\"SNOW\\" trail.<br />Vocally, this CD does not present HOUSTON with a strong artistic achievement. This holiday cd is terribly cliche and a product most could live without.<br />MARIAH released a better holiday CD in 1994 as did CELINE with her seasonal CD of 1999.<br />The once impressive Houston now sounds frozen in time partly due to the horrid 1980's musical arangements.<br />For your money, you would be better off purchasing the new holiday CD from HARRY CONNICK JR ~ HARRY FOR THE HOLIDAYS.<br />One wish: EARTH TO HOUSTON ~ Get your act together it's a sin to waste a talent like yours.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney is not the best singer, but at least her other cd's were somewhat good. The whole cd is really a pathetic attempt to gain back her popularity. Her voice sounds like she is trying to hard and has music that would be better with no one singing. Me against the music is the best song and even that song isnt all that.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This collection of B-Sides is further proof that Pearl Jam needs to have careful consideration given to the fact that they are not just the kings of the 90's grunge movement but one of the best rock and roll bands of all time.  I have been a fan from the beginning and this two disc set takes me back to the early days...keep on rockin' the free world!!!!!!!!
B00005JMCW|5.0|If you loved the orginal verson then you will love this one even more. The story is pretty much the same as the old one only this story is set in today. This movie is so funny especially Jamie Lee Curtis. This movie you can watch over and over and still wanna watch it again. Its a great movie for any age group. Also the music through out the movie is pretty good not to mention how well Lindsey sings (Watch out Britney and Hillary Duffy)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|EFFE YEA! BRITNEY HAS GROWN AND IT ANNOYS ME WHEN PEOPLE SAY HOW SHE CANT &quot;REALLY SING.&quot; ESPECIALLY SINCE SHE DANCES HER ASS OFF AND GIVES AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE EVERYTIME LIKE ON SNL WHEN SHE REALLY SANG! LET HER LIVE HER LIFE AND MAKE GOOD MUSIC THAT I LOVE TO DANCE TO AND PEOPLE NEED TO STOP HATING HER!!!. I LOVE TOXIC AND BREATHE ON ME AND ME AGAINST THE MUSIC AHH SCREW IT I LOVE IT ALL..BUY THIS CD ..HURRY! BRIT ROCKS...
B00005JM02|5.0|Finding Nemo is one of Disney's best movies in a long while. The story is really sweet. This movie gives you a happy feeling and its great for any age group.The best parts by far have to do with the sharks, dorie, and the turtles.
0679720200|3.0|i feel very upset with this book, and all of the other european books we re-print and change. The books are classics for a reason, because they are adored, so we then take those books and change them? I am reading the ORIGINAL version of this book and it is amazing, when i see this, it makes me want to break something, why would anyone change a beutiful work of literature, this is just another example of American's doing this. I just finished reading the original version of a clockwork orange and the american version and i am appauled, the endings are completely different! we need to stop changing european works of art.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|In the Zone has finally come out! I've been waiting months!!!  This cd is amazing. You can really hear Britney's input on this album and her desire for an edgier sound. Her music is no longer oriented towards the younger audience; it lyrically deals with issues common to college-aged listeners and the 20-something audience. &quot;Breathe on Me&quot; is an addictive track that is sure to get you moving.  This cd is sure to be played nonstop at clubs in the upcoming months, and I can't wait to hear it. If you like to dance and love to hear music that reminds you of your favorite nights spent out at the clubs, then this cd is one you MUST own!  I applaud Britney for her music and her resilience in a tough business.  If you plan on purchasing a cd, make sure it's In the Zone!
006092988X|5.0|25 years after reading this book for the first time, I STILL love this book as much as I did the first time I read it. The characters are warm and real and the story still inspires me. I have given a copy of this book to every young girl in my life and everyone of them has been thrilled once they have read it. I re-read this book at least once a year and it has a treasured place of honor among my collection of girlhood favorites.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania never fails to deliver and this is an awesome addition to your Shania/dvd collection.  The songs and the show are so upbeat it just puts you in a good mood.  I have seen Shania in concert before, but after getting this dvd, I really can't wait to see her again.
0440236304|5.0|Donald Burgett writes with such amazing skill, he puts you there. You are standing in the fields; you hear the screams of the injured and dying; the whistling of the shells; you smell the gunsmoke and blood. You are there with him, experiencing what he experienced. Definately a must-read book, as are all of Donald Burgett's books!  I highly recommend them.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|708 reviews huh? Well what's one more? Actually I would probably give this album 3 1/2 stars. Now after having this album to digest for awhile I've reached some personal conclusions. I wouldn't rate this album as highly as Mer de Noms, yet at the same time I would rate some of the songs on 13th Step to be better than those on Mer de Noms. Songs like the opener, The Package I would consider a step forward from their previous album as well as Pet, the Noose, and the acoustic A Stranger. Songs like Weak and Powerless, Blue, Vanish, and Gravity are also strong songs though for me not as striking as the others or their previous work. Then we come to the inclusion of a cover song in The Nurse Who Loved Me, for me a weak song no where near the quality of music the band is capable of writing themselves. I would have by far preferred they held up the album release date by another month and written another of their own songs. Also the inclusion of short &quot;filler&quot; tracks like Lullaby, and Crimes soon seem to get old to my ears. Its very odd to think that they couldn't have come up with something better to fill the CD's time with.(like more songs!)<br /><br />The production on this album seems not quite up to the sound quality of Mer de Noms either. Part of this is the result of there being more songs in what I'd call a &quot;Cure&quot; type vibe, more reverb, less clarity. It just seems to have more of a fuzz to it for want of a better word. Also the effect of beginning the songs with flat dry drums only to have the &quot;real&quot; sound come in half way through gets a bit old after awhile. Its a good idea once, but after that becomes a bit predictable. <br /><br />So where does this leave us? With a very good second album from a great band. In a way it seems to me to be the album APC had to make to evolve hopefully into their next album. It breaks the boundaries set up by Mer de Noms much like Led Zep III broke the mold for what Zep would release afterward. In the end it seems a necessary album for A Perfect Circle to make, not perfect but highly worth listening to and buying. One can only hope that some of the less positively trodden paths will be not travelled down again on their next (hopeful) release...
B00005JKQZ|4.0|This is one of the very few films on my favorites list that is not war or combat-oriented. I still can't decide which Crowe film I like better, this or Gladiator. The acting is superb from all the chief characters (Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connely, Ed Harris), and I am very pissed that Denzel Washington robbed Crowe of the Best actor award for the crappy &quot;Training Day&quot;. The plot is a little screwy, but Ron Howard's good directing makes it work. The only thing that really kept me from giving this movie a perfect 5 is that it robbed &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; of best picture.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|After listening to this album for almost 30 years, it is amazing how clear, crisp and new this sounds!...like it was recorded this year!  All of the Beatles' albums should be remastered with 2003 technology.  Let It Be...Naked gives these songs a warm, live feeling.  The Long and Winding Road is now a spare haunting ballad...and was it possible to improve Let It Be?  It IS much improved here, now a live, emotional performance with amazing harmonies showing through very clearly, not drowned in echo and orchestration.<BR>This album finally does what must have been intended at the beginning: it shows the Beatles in the raw, and what a great live rock band they were!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this cd is the best. she really open up to a lot of new things. everyone who has not goten this cd needs to get fast because you just need to listen to it. All of britney cds are great but this one is the best one.

B0000DJE9R|3.0|After purchasing the CD ($18.99) and DVD ($21.99) at Toronto HMV (333 Yonge St.), I hope HMV is not selling them together at $22.99.  Not ONE copy was available in the CD/DVD combination at the Yonge Street location on Nov. 18, 2003.  If Jackson's 'Number Ones' is available in the CD/DVD format, then HMV is less than honest in its business practice and I've been really ripped off.

B00009TB5G|5.0|Words cannot express how great this version is. The extra forty-three minutes enhances the story in a way I'd have never thought possible, and helps Faramir's case greatly. The theatrical becomes obsolete, this one is so vastly superior.
B000002G87|5.0|This album is extremely powerful.  There is an emotional theme that runs through it's entirety that is quite evident and moving.  I have been listening to Eric Clapton for over 20 years and for some reason, never got around to this album.  Always a Cream fan, or his greatest hits or John Mayall, Yardbirds.  Well, this musical experience is in a WHOLE different league altogether than anything else I ever heard him do.  I would be hard-pressed not to agree with other reviewers that state this to be the greatest rock album ever - really, it is that great.  The real amazing thing also is that this is a double album.  Best advice you can give someone is to just buy it and see for yourself.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I've always loved Britney, but this new CD is quite a pleasant departure from her other CD's. This CD has a &quot;trancey&quot; vibe that is so chill. Some people might not like the quiet smooth beats, but those that do will definately like and appreciate this album. Just because it's different from her other albums doesn't mean it's bad. It's awesome! I recommend it to anyone that likes smooth, quiet, chill music.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I just saw the concert for George DVD and must say it blew me away, the players were all at their best and the selection of songs was just right. It was good to see Paul and Ringo on stage together, and Eric played the guitar amazingly. If you enjoyed George's music you'll love this DVD. Seing Dhani on stage it was like seing George still playing for us.
0316776963|5.0|Are you ready to read a book that is written as relaxed as you are reading it?  David Sedaris's Me Talk Pretty One Day is one of the funniest true to life books I have ever read.  This book takes you through David's dysfunctional childhood all the way up to his life in the present.  The situations he encounters in life are written so beautifully that you feel like he is sitting next to you at a party and everyone is laughing around him.  I started reading the first chapter, which is written about his eccentric father who loves his family but has problems expressing support for his weird children, next thing I know I'm on page 112 and hanging on his every word like it's juicy high school gossip.  Reading further in the book you come to know that David Sedaris's inner thoughts remind you of the thoughts you giggle about to only to yourself.  The life of David Sedaris you would think would be filled with happy childhood memories surrounded by scholarly achievements and lots of money.  After putting the book down I forget sometimes this guy is the author of a National Best Seller and not a buddy of mine.  You can find truth and humor in every one of his chapters as well as a story you can relate to.  Using humor and a great writing technique Sedaris takes you to Paris where he has moved without knowing anything about the French language.  He enrolls in a French class where he is instructed by a professor who takes her language a little too seriously.  This chapter starts his many triumphs to win over the life of Parisian in a country that hates him.  With his adventures changing in every chapter you never become bored with each insight he pulls you closer.  Sedaris's descriptive storytelling style is the greatest I ever read and I'm not surprised I haven't heard of him sooner.  When you think your life is crazy read a couple chapters and you can put that same funny twist on life and survive anything with a good sense of humor.  The last chapter like the first is about his father, there you see his father may be strange but the respect he has for the man that wanted David to be happy and supported no matter what crazy dream he would follow.  Finishing the book I reflected on the many different struggles David Sedaris lived through the most was drugs and the influence it had over his art and what he did to overcome his addiction. The end result impresses me the most; he has taken a troubled life and made it a funny learning experience that all can relate too.<br />  -Lee from Louisvilleis father, there you see his father may be strange but the respect he has for the man that wanted David to be happy and supported no matter what crazy dream he would follow.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|When I heard that Whitney was doing a Christmas album, I had mixed feelings.  After buying and hearing this CD, I am more than happy that I bought it.  The feelings she puts into each song can definitely be felt and sends a sense of love, happiness, and joy through your being.  I am generally not a holiday person, but this cd has inspired me to put a bit more effort in being cheerful for the holidays. Ms. Houston has chosen songs that have been recorded in their traditional style and made them her own.  One Wish is excellent and a must have.
B0000029DD|5.0|The world's greatest talent of the 90's only legacy to us.<br />A parallel could be drawn between James Dean/Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix/Jeff Buckley:the first two participated in 3 major movies/albums,were known worldwide and became spokesmen for their generation while the second two were more cult figures than stars,still they managed to produce in their brief careers masterpieces that outshine most of Dean/Cobain best work(&quot;Running on Empty&quot;,&quot;Grace&quot;).<br />Jeff Buckley didn't,unarguably,fulfill his astounding potential.<br />He had it all,though,he had the guitar playing(at times Marr-esque,at times crunching powerchords)he had the voice (of an angel or a demon)and soaring above everybody else he had the heart,the emotions that oozed from every sylabe he sang.<br />The whole album is a standout but &quot;Dream Brother&quot; and &quot;Grace&quot; are the best examples of his unparalleled songwriting.<br />Essential for anyone who really presumes enjoying music.
0767818040|3.0|but they don't get significantly worse.  Yes, De Palma's films are striking visually.  Yes, his Hitchcock (whom I love!) homages are witty and give reason to watch his films more than once.  Yes, De Palma is entertaining and full of style at all times.<br />That being said, time, maturity, and repeat viewings of de Palma's movies show the seams of his work more obviously.  &quot;Body Double&quot; is a prime example; it is a film that has lost a star or two in my estimation of it over the years.  It is high on style, and quite poetic at moments despite the sleazy elements on hand.  All in all, however, it appears more superficial and simplistic on repeat viewings.  Craig Wasson gives a terrible performance, while Melanie Griffith gives a thoroughly believable comic one.  The Donnagio score is evocative of Bernard Herrmann, which is never a bad thing.  The voyeuristic theme is both witty and sordid at once.  Ultimately, the film is a mixed bag that de Palma fans will enjoy deconstructing.
B000002H72|5.0|Early Pixies aren't,definitely,everybody's cup of tea,but if you do get hooked(and it takes some persistence from the listener)you'll be past the point of no return,you'll love every second of every song in a shamelessly passionate way.You'll be exhilerated by what Black does with a single word like &quot;estate&quot;(Number 13 Baby)or &quot;chained&quot;(Hey),you will be marvelled at the more perfect than perfect timing of Kim Deal's bass(Tame),you'll adore every second of Joey Santiago's power chord surges(Crackity Jones)and the way David Lovering always seems to find the exact beat for each song.<br />For the non-converts it may be a difficult sound but once you get into it the hooks will be flying from all angles.<br />The Pixies are probably the most original band created by America in the last 20 years(at par with the more avant garde Sonic Youth).
B00005MP58|5.0|This film is, indeed, utter perfection.  For those who quibble over the minor variations from the book, I encourage you to write and produce a better film from this sparkling book. Every change/addition is justified, every scene luminious, every performance practically perfect.  This is as close to being a filmed realization of the novel as one could ever hope for.<BR>That being said, the dvd could be better for such a beloved production.  Where is the six hour commentary that all of us die-hard fans would love to listen to?  Where are deleted scenes or snippets of scenes?  Where are bloopers and outtakes or an exhaustive 2 hour making-of documentary?  For a Special Edition, many of us have been waiting for this kind of treatment that lesser theatrical films get all the time.  I know this is A&amp;E/BBC territory and their resources are not the same as Warner Bros. for instance, but we fans will continue to wish for more features.  All in all, though, the series is a sparkling diamond of exquisite cut; the dvd is competent and serviceable until someone produces the &quot;ultimate&quot; special edition.
B00005KFUN|5.0|In this album all the Radiohead comparisons collapse(though not the Jeff Buckley ones)for Muse rock harder than Thom's gang ever did and they sure aren't afraid of sounding preposterous(owing certainly something to Queen)in every possible way,be it musically or lyrically.<br />The music itself is in one word:BRILLIANT with an excellent intersection between the hard riffing parts and the melodic highs that punctuate each song.<br />Definitely an impressive album by an impressive band and the one that sets Muse as an undeniably powerful force in the British music panorama.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|Janeites need to realize that making an adaptation of a novel isn't always or often successful simply by following a novel line by line.  A cinematic adaptation is a re-interpretation of a novel, and the director and screenwriter must make choices for their vision to come to the screen.  I have no quibbles with the choices made here.  The screenplay is respectful of Austen's work, but intent on being a fast, charming, witty romantic comedy.  It succeeds admirably as such.  Paltrow is perfect in her role, as are the other cast members.  No, it doesn't resonate as deeply and richly as the novel, but on its own terms, it is sublime.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Personally I don't even really like &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; and am surprised it was picked as the first single when there were so many better songs to choose from. My favorite song so far is &quot;Showdown&quot;. I really like that this album is so different. I was surprised to see such a great house track, (&quot;Breathe on Me&quot;). This cd is meant to be fun with a lot of great beats. If you're looking for something more serious I suggest you stay away from this disc and possibly out of the pop genre entirely.
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie is an absolutely wonderful story of how one young girl can touch the lives of so many around her. She is successful in helping her father, her friends, and even complete strangers find happiness. The problem comes when it is time to help herself. Can a shy girl who grew up alone with no friends overcome her anxiety in time to keep from missing out on her chance at happiness?<br />Highly recommend this movie as a real uplifting and thought provoking look at how sometimes true happiness can only be found when we are willing to take a risk.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is an absolute must for any Shania fan. Shania has had an impressive carreer so far and she is not slowing down. After watching this DVD you will run out to see Shania live next time she comes around. A lot of artists can make a decent CD but it takes real talent to put on a live show as awesome as Shania does. I usually don't bother with videos because I prefer to see an artist live but if you have already seen Shania live this DVD will revitalize those memories. If you haven't then you HAVE to see what your missing!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is just plain awesome it is like Shania never left and I think she is better than ever!!  You need to pick this DVD up! if you haven't already because it will make you get up and dance and sing along.  Very high energy and alot fan envolvment!!  What else can I say but go and get it!!!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|This CD is not radically different from the original release tho' &quot;Across the Universe&quot; sparkles as never before. I defy anyone to listen to the additional CD material more than once. My gripe with this release is the copy protection employed. I have had nothing but trouble running it on my work computer.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|All I can say is WOW!! This album is the best yet out from Britney and I thought it couldn't get any better than BRITNEY, her last CD. It's a great CD to dance to in a club and the mellower songs are just songs to chill to. This CD is great and everyone needs to go and get it. This CD is one that you can't get sick of because all the songs sound so different. You can listen to it over and over again!! You WONT be disapointed.
B0000TB03W|5.0|she is so energectic this dvd is one of her best yet what a concert! will keep you interrested the whole time it is on.as as<BR>always shania gives it her all in this dvd and it is great!
B0000E1WKE|3.0|To my dissapointment, Whitney has lost her beautiful voice. She struggles with the songs and really doesn't shine through. I can't help feeling that all her trials and tribulations lately have done something to her vocal power. The arrangements of the songs are fine, no fault on tye production value. My wish for Whitney that she gets back her lovely voice.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's DVD is excellant.  I have never seen a women with so much presence on stage.  The UP DVD is a must have.  It is like being at the concert all over again.  Any one that has attended one of Shania's concerts knows what I am talking about.  Get it today and you will not be sorry.  Pick up a few extra copies for stocking stuffers!
B0000AQS6R|4.0|OK, I admit I was forced to watch it, but found myself enjoying it anyway. Chevy Chase is back once more, and from the previous ones I've seen, it's the most disappointing. There are a few funny moments, but they were predictable. How many times can you watch someone stapling Christmas lights (talk about going overboard with THOSE!) without knowing they're going to attach themselves to the roof, and then fall off the ladder? Having the dreaded family over makes me wish I'm not going anywhere this Christmas! You've got all the worst family members you can possibly imagine ... and then add some! The mum is at her best in this film, and the children are Juliette Lewis is an early role, but still looking &amp; sounding the same, and the guy who later got a fish hook through the neck in I Know What You Did Last Summer. This isn't my fave National Lampoon Movie/Vacation movie. But it's a great movie to watch at this time of year - even though I keep complaining that I'm watching Christmas movies in the middle of November, and I want it to be Christmas NOW!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|For Dream Theater's seventh full length studio album, 'Train of Thought', the band offer up a slightly different album than one might expect. <br />The music on 'Train of Thought' is some of the heaviest of the bands career (quite often overpowering 'Awake' in the crunch department). Jordan is a little less in the mix then I would personally prefer, but he is still amazing, and still does have his moments throughout the disc. <br />The continuation of &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;, &quot;This Dying Soul&quot; is an album high point, along with opener &quot;As I Am&quot;, instrumental &quot;Stream of Conciousness&quot; (originally slated to be the name for 'Falling Into Infinity'), and the powerfull closing track &quot;In The Name of God&quot; (not a religion pushing song as one would gather from the title). <BR>With only one song not featuring lyrics from either Portnoy or Petrucci (&quot;Vacant&quot;, LaBrie's lyrical contribution), the lyrics are dark and often from not a very good place (&quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;), making this album a must have for metal/prog and of course, Dream Theater fans.<br />Throwing what you may or may not have heard about stolen riffs aside, enter this train of thought with an open mind, and a high volume, and once again, Dream Theater will rock your world.
B00003CXDG|3.0|I'm giving this movie 3 stars, but more on the side of two, rather than four. I found it boring &amp; predictable. And the don't take at face value is absolutely necessary. You don't know who people are going to be, as the mask of people's faces which was touched upon in the first movie, is now severely overdone in this, and now has a little sticker across the voice box, to make the voices the same too.<br />Tom Cruise reprises his role as Ethan Hunt, and along with Ving Rhames, are the only two surviving members of the previous film. Along come a whole host of other characters, including Thandie Newton, and Dougray Scott - a sterotyped Scottish character, playing the bad guy as usual.<br />This movie seems to steal a lot from a hyped film, which has influenced a lot of other movies - The Matrix. This film has a lot to answer to these days in the movie world, and I was disappointed to see Tom Cruise/John Woo steal certain bits to make their film better - and I'm sorry to say they failed.<br />There are a lot of fight scenes in this, but they're not sitting-on-the-edge-of-your-seat fight scenes. They're overdone, and don't really have any effect on you.<br />I was also disappointed by Tom Cruise in this. I much preferred his hair in the first film - the buzz cut - than his overlong, and unkempt look in this film. A year or so after this, Tom famously divorced Nicole Kidman, in favour of Penelope Cruz. I wouldn't be surprised if Nicole was jealous after seeing this film, as Tom &amp; Thandie (Newton) have a lot of chemistry, very unusual in co-stars. The fact that she also wears lots of low cut tops with push up bras probably helped.<br />I loved the scenes featuring Tom &amp; Thandie, or just Thandie alone, cos the music in the background was really nice and peaceful. The Mission Impossible score is used quite a lot, but it sounded different to the original, and is overused and overloud at some points.<br />Overall, I'm not disappointed I bought this film (it was on sale). And of course its a sequel, so I wasn't really expecting much. But I hope Tom Cruise doesn't think he's going to be onto a good thing if he churns out another one. We all know how the third movie always disappoints.on sale). And of course its a sequel, so I wasn't really expecting much.

B0000CAQ27|5.0|If you are looking for the R&amp;B of &quot;Can't Take Me Home&quot; or a page out of her diary like in &quot; M!ssundaztood&quot; you might be a little disapointmed.  What you will find is a solid album from a growing musician.  The more rock influenced &quot;Last to Know&quot; as well as &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot; are a nod to Co writer Tim Armstrong.  <br />To be honest I have found myself listining to this Cd over and over again since I bought it.  If you are looking for something with more a more rock vice then this is the CD for you.  I personally recomend it!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I picked up this album as soon as I got out of physics discussion, and I love it. Not that I have anything against the Phil Spector version, but this is definitely a cool remix of the original release.  God, I love the Beatles.<br />To me, about half of the songs sound only slightly altered (hissing- and clicking-wise) and the other half have actual instrument removal, like the Spector-orchestrations, which make the songs sound obviously different.  &quot;Get Back,&quot; &quot;I've Got a Feeling,&quot; and &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; (though an alternate recording of this song was used instead of the 45 version) fall into the former category, as well as the rest of the straight-forward rock tracks that never had any fancy symphony backing.  The other category of songs is the reason that everyone should buy this album.  &quot;Let It Be,&quot; &quot;Across the Universe,&quot; &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot; have had all their respective orchestration tracks removed and it's actually kind of surprising how great they all sound with just the Beatles' (and Billy Preston's) naked instrumentation.  Especially in &quot;Let it Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road,&quot; Preston's fantastic keyboarding is much more distinguisable than the original recordings.  It's impossible to describe just how cool these songs sound de-Spectorized, so you just have to buy this record and see for yourself.<br />Also, I got some special bonus disc in the CD called &quot;Fly on the Wall,&quot; which I thought was some kind of interview track or something.  Actually, it's a weird 20-minte voice and song mosaic of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions.  If it costs extra money to get this &quot;bonus&quot; disc, don't bother because it's dumb.<br />Anyways, the Beatles are the best group ever, so if you're a big fan, this album is a must.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The release of &quot;Let It Be . . . Naked&quot; is sure to prove a long term dilemma for radio stations.  Do they play &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; with its orchestral overdubs added by &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; producer Phil Spector, or do they play the &quot;new,&quot; stripped down version that's been &quot;de-Spectorized?&quot;  For my money, I'll take the latter version for two reasons.  First, the Beatles had never intended the &quot;Let it Be&quot; sessions to be augmented by other musicians, save the addition of Billy Preston's keyboard contributions.  Second, the sound on this CD is, arguably, the best that I've ever heard on a Beatles release . . . it is simply a superb mix.<br />The &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; bonus CD is somewhat of a letdown for me.  Checking in at just under 22 minutes, you hear snippets of the Beatles in conversation during the recording sessions as well as some brief musical excerpts.  Why couldn't this have been longer . . . particularly the musical pieces (the longest musical piece on this CD lasts about a minute and a half)?  Surely some alternate takes could have been included.  That said, the &quot;Fly on the Wall&quot; disc is still a must have for fans of Rock's greatest band . . . The Beatles.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I believe this is Britney's best album. The songs are cathchy and much more grown up then her previous albums. Here is my song by song review:<BR>1. Me Against The Music - One of Britney's best singles ever. Very catchy and Madonna sounds awesome too. 10/10<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - Really hot song! I don't really like the Ying Yang Twins but they sound cool here. 9/10<br />3. Showdown - This song is very different. I don't really know how to describe it but Britney raps the verses and the chorus is really catchy. 9/10<br />4. Breathe On Me - One of the best songs. Really sexy and catchy. 10/10<br />5. Early Mornin' - This is another different song. It has a really cool beat and a good chorus. 8/10<br />6. Toxic - One of the top 3 best. It's just an awesome, upbeat song and I love the ending. 10/0<br />7. Outrageous - I'm not a big R. Kelly fan (R. Kelly wrote and produced this song) but Britney can make any song hot and this is no exception. Awesome beat and chorus. 9/10<br />8. Touch Of My Hand - Probably my favorite song on the c.d. Really sexy and the music is great. This is probably one of <BR>Britney's best vocal preformances. 10/10<br />9. The Hook Up - Awesome beginning and the chorus is catchy. 9/10<br />10. Shadow - Great, catchy ballad with a chorus that will get stuck in your head. 10/10<br />11. Brave New Girl - Sounds the most like her old songs. Good verses and a good chorus. 9/10<br />12. Everytime - Beautiful ballad with great vocals from Britney. 10/10<br />13. Me Against The Music (Remix) - This is a great remix of a great song. 10/10<br />Overall I would highly reccomend this C.D. to Britney fans or any other music lover.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Well, I had to rush and buy it it's first day out. While worth the money and a must have in any Beatle fan's collection, I must say I was a bit disappointed. True, the sound quality is much better. The Long and Winding Road was there minus the stings. This is the way Paul has said (many many times) he wanted it. I agree; it is an improvement, but I believe the concept of the album was born from this idea without much other thought. Some songs haven't been touched other then a thorough cleaning, and others are entirely new takes, which were not the best takes of the particular song. Maybe I misunderstood the word &quot;naked&quot;. I took this to mean raw, rock and roll, straight from the can, inspired, but not mediocre. In many spots, the drums have been mixed too loud and the guitars too soft. In spite of this, it is still satisfying to hear the fab four in a new light. The best part of this package is the bonus disk of studio dialogue and inpromtu jams of earlier, unreleased songs and songs on future Beatles and solo albums. A fun album, but hang onto your &quot;clothed&quot; Let It Be.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This cd is very dancy-upbeat. It reminded me a lot of Madonna and Kylie Minogue - the dance theme reoccurs throughout the album. My fav song would have to be Toxic. It's definitely a very fun cd. However, britney's voice sounds very digital, and I was surprised to see not as many slow songs as her usual cds. I don't think this is her best cd, but it's pretty darn near close!
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a wonderful book.  Morrie is such a good person with a passion for life.  This book will make you stop and think about your own life and how you could make it better.  It makes you feel like you are in Mitch's shoes taking in everything Morrie has to say in his last days.  You can feel the passion and love throughout the book.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially if you want to learn a great lesson about life.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Awsome dvd!!! I love everything by Shania!! She is truly the most talented in country music today. This dvd is the best one out in a long time! I have seen Shania live several &amp; her shows are very high energy &amp; fun just like this dvd. Buy it for Christmas for everyone on your list! You will NOT regret it!
B0000DBJ2B|5.0|I originally saw this movie in the theatre with my [young] daughter in 1982. At the time, it represented a technical triumph of some significance. Others have discussed ad nauseum the story line... which, as a fantasy buff, I do find satisfying. However, as a movie collector, this film represents first use technology and technique... it is an important addition to any collection from this perspective alone.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I just finished watching the Shania in Chicago dvd and it was AWESOME!! I was in Chicago for the taping of the concert and it brought back all the wonderful memories of the show. It felt like I was in the crowd all over again! The DVD is great and Shania Definitely rocked Chicago!
B0000E1WKE|4.0|After taking eons between albums and soundtrack projects in the 1990s, Whitney returns with her second album in one year. This is a sweet Christmas album, and to hear Whitney sing &quot;O Holy Night&quot; and &quot;I'll Be Home For Christmas&quot; is a sheer joy. However, &quot;The First Noel&quot; and &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot; suffer a bit from cheesy modern R&amp;B production (she could have really delivered more classic, heartfelt performances) and the new song &quot;One Wish&quot; is a little tepid (it won't be a classic), but overall, this album is a pleasure. They did lift the final two songs from &quot;The Preacher's Wife.&quot; Since they did that, why didn't they lift &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear&quot; from &quot;A Very Special Christmas?&quot; That would have made the album absolutely complete. Oh well, thank God that Whitney still has her head on her shoulders and is still recording. AMEN!
B00005JMFI|5.0|This film had my stomach in so much pain and me wetting myself it was so funny. The actors and actoresses should be so proud of them selfs for what they have done.

6302794331|5.0|I do not want to go so far as to say that it is impossible to put together a really unsatisfying version of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens, first, because I have not seen all of the versions ever made, and, second, because I do not want to tempt the fates.  This is a classic story for which most people have several favorites, from the 1951 Alistair Sims film to the animated &quot;Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol&quot; (I could have easily named another half dozen films to replace either one of those).  Still, with all of those versions floating out there is still room for those that retell the tale with a humorous touch, the best of which involved Mickey Mouse and the Muppets.<br />In &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; Michael Caine is the sole &quot;real&quot; person, playing Ebenezer Scrooge.  The performance is rather impressive when you take into account that he has to play straight man to the cast of Muppets but still manages to give the key moments of Dickens' story their gravity.  Basically, this version works because Caine never lets you know he is working with Muppets.  Persuading you to see this one is fairly simple.  You know the story and if you mention that Kermit the Frog is Bob Crachit, Miss Piggy is Emily Crachit, Fozzie Bear is Fozziwig (who else?), Robert the Frog is Tiny Tim, Waldorf and Statler is Robert and Jacob Marley, and the Great Gonzo is Charles Dickens, that should be enough to fire your imagination.  The ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Yet to Come are &quot;new&quot; Muppets, which shows screenwriter Jerry Juhl and director Henson know how to preserve the spirit of the original while still letting the Muppets have their fun.<br />All things considered, &quot;The Muppet Christmas Carol&quot; is the merriest version of the Dickens' classic.  The songs are by that living Muppet, Paul Williams, the best of which is &quot;Marley and Marley,&quot; although the two big songs are &quot;When Love Is Found&quot; and &quot;It Feels Like Christmas.&quot;  None of these will become Christmas standards, but they are still enjoyable in the context of this charming movie.  Even better, it is not just for kids, but for all those who know Christmas and keep it in their hearts (and who are old enough to get all the jokes).;It Feels Like Christmas.&quot;  None of these will become Christmas standards, but they are still enjoyable in the context of this charming movie.

B00003CXAT|1.0|I have always said that the sure sign of a &quot;bad movie&quot; is when you start cheering for the &quot;bad guys&quot;.  In this poor excuse of a movie, I started hoping against hope that the dinosaurs would eat every human on the island.  The special effects are cool; the movie isn't.  A highly (and I mean HIGHLY) overated waste of time - do yourself a favor and read the book instead.
B000002L82|5.0|Whenever someone complains that electronic music is totally void of warmth or realism, I just point to this album. New Order play electronic music with the urgent and manic shifts of rock. Bernards vocals are earnest yet detatched, with guitar work that is jagged, random and sparse; Gillian and Stephen's percussion and synth sequences are both lively and rigid, an up-beat/down-march; Peter's basslines are fluid yet kinetic. This is a work of ironic friction. The warmth and humanity flow thru the restrained and urgent detatchment. The whole album sounds like a friend that wants to say something but can't, hiding it behind his/her eyes.<br /> I would consider Power, Corruption &amp; Lies an artistic/pop masterpiece in the true sense. The electronic and post-punk meanderings are only the charms that envelope the wonderfully angular pop sense that Bernard brings to his lyrics. Everything is so vague and pretty; it's like the album cover...just a random slice of still-life, full of colour and restraint. Tracks like 'Your Silent Face' or '5-8-6' explode with edgy, manic shades of light, sorta like impressionism via expressionism.<br /> You won't be let down by this album. With the band themselves producing it, it's a natural workout of rock and electronics, perfectly blended together to make a classic.
B0000TB03W|5.0|on this dvd u have one of the most beautiful women with in my opinoin the greatest voice in country music today live in concert and unlike going to a live concert where you pay watch it 1 time you can watch it over andover and with shania in it youll want to watch it till u wear it out what  ever this dvd cost its worth every penny and i give it 5 stars
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This CD is definately written for the clubbing, fire-twirling, ecstacy-taking, jumpy bubbly crowd. I just wonder how much of the worlds population is like that (outside of LA). Probably about 0.001%. Which means not alot of record-sales. This is what Britney thinks is cool right now I guess. And Madonna is trying to be cool by hanging with Britney because she knows she is fading fast. Poor Britney. How could she say no to Madonna? Anyway, I bought the CD to workout to - but I still like to workout to &quot;Stripped&quot; better. Madonna - leave Britney ALONE!!! She is too nice to tell you she does NOT want you on her album.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Train of Thought is an incredible album by these amazing musicians in ass-ripping, full blown metal onslaught. While I loved all the albums by DT including the very overlooked black sheep FII, I got a little dissapointed by 6DOIT because it was way too complex what with all those mini-concepts and so solid tunes, the weakest/longest DT release ever. Well, DT answered me with TOT, no concept, no intellectual debates, but an in-your-face metal mayhem which is probably one of the best metal releases ever. Expect here no DT of I&W or COS but expect here DT playing Awake style music on steroids. I hear Old school metal like MOP times Metallica, Megadeth, Pantera here and I am not complaining, I love it. The album is definatly a Petrucchi baby, as he transcends all that he has ever done before. While some people write that this is too much show-off, I call these reviews BS because, when you got it,it doesnt harm to flaunt it. How many people on earth can play like JP or JR or MP or JM or sing like JL? There are five of them and all of them are in DT!<br />As I Am, is perhaps the weakest track on the disk, but dont get me wrong, its only weak compared to whats going to come next. But the best part of the song is a mindnumbing lead from JP in the end. This Dying Soul ends where The Glass Prison begins, metal onslaught, a 5/5. Endless Sacrifice with beautiful Sanitarium style intro is about the sacrifices JP and rest of the crew make in their life as professional travelling musicians, away from their family. An excellent track makes me even sad when I think deep and understand that while providing so much joy to us fans, they are away from their own people. What on earth is this band? So INCREDIBLE!!!, 5/5, or infinity out of five. Honor Thy Father, MP's personal song with vitriolic lyrics is a straight 5/5 rocker. Vacant, a great respite with beautiful singing from JL, brings bloodtears to my eyes, JL is a cool singer, one the best on the planet, 5/5. Steam of Consciousness, a brilliant instrumental from the genius band, 5/5. In the name of God, a outstanding way to end an outstanding album, 5/5. 7 songs, about 70 minutes of music, this is one of the best DT releases ever. <br />Please dont compare the album with I&A and the old works of DT and say that DT has changed or what ever! No DT is change and what ever they change into is excellent. Here is perhaps the only band on earth with so much prodical talent (One must also try Porcupine Tree), and not a SINGLE bad album. Here is a band which cares about its fans, makes music for us all, comes out with so much material, CDs/DVDs/SideProjects so life is all the more worth living. Here is a band that has no ego, plays covers even after they have become a major band. Here is a band which is proud of its eclectic influences. No other band would ever dare play entire Master of Puppets or entire Number of the Beast, LIVE!!! God bless DT, Train of Thought has a special place in my life and DT, in my heart!!!
0385504209|5.0|i might be 12 but this book had me in awe. the fact that Dan Brown could come up with such a plot baffles me. The aspect of Mary Magdalene and the Priory of Sion gives the book unexpected twists of excitement. Read this book and i gaurentee you love it.
0553573403|5.0|Simply put go buy this book now it is the greatest fantasy book I have ever read.  I've read all the other proclaimed greats: Tolkien (Excellent) Jordan(Good) Goodkind(Average) Brooks(Good) etc., but I swear to you this has to be up there with Lord of the Rings and Middle Earth.  The detail and vastness of this series is incredible.  If it weren't fiction it may have been a documentary on another land.  In no way though is this series boring.  It's everything a reader really wants in a book, action, intrigue, emotions that the reader can feel and a very good plot.  Martin has beautifully weaved a masterful tale that can't really be described with words.I love this book.  I'm a high school senior and I never used to read on my spare time.  The first three books of this series got me to read, and now I love to read.  That's how good Martin is.<br />Buy this now you won't regret it, that I can guarantee.<br />The only cons I can see about this book, if there are any, is some people like whimsical magic, etc.  This doesn't have too much of that but it's still the best book series I have read to date.  I've read 40 different sci-fi/fantasy books and most were of series and so far this is the greatest.<br />Just buy it you will not be sorry.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I heard this played on the radio all the way thru last night. I am so glad I ordered this and I can barely stand the wait for it to get here! I still have my original album of this and I believe I actually prefer this version to the original. This should be a must have for all Beatle collectors and lovers. If you have a Beatle fan on your Christmas list. Buy this! They will love you for it. I predict it too will become another Beatle classic. &quot;Let it Be ... Naked&quot; proves that after 40 years the Beatles still live on and will for all time. If you have a teenager, buy it for them, this is a great way to introduce them to true legends and true musicians, singers, and song writers. Long live The Beatles and &quot;Let it Be .. Naked&quot;, will encourage this! You will like every track on this. I predict it will become your new favorite Beatle CD.

Why is it, for instance, that there are apparently no interviews, commentary or featurettes with Sigourney Weaver?? Without her, the series would be infinitely less accessible and interesting. Her role in \\"Alien\\" was a groundbreaking, gender-bending eye-opener, and her Oscar-nominated performance in \\"Aliens\\" was equally revolutionary.<br />Second, why was \\"The Alien Legacy\\" substituted for \\"The Alien Saga\\"? The latter, narrated by John Hurt of \\"Alien,\\" was a spectacular and riveting analysis of the making of each film in the series and their relevance. It provides a wonderful, insightful bookend for the series, and includes interviews with the principals, including Weaver!<br />Lastly, while some featurette material focuses on H.R. Giger, I wonder if it's too little? This master's imprint on the series - and subsequent sci-fi/fantasy films in general - is indelible and unmistakable. His creepy-yet-beautiful artistry not only created arguably the most memorable creature in film history, but supplied the wondrous alien environments as well. Directors come and go, but his influence was omnipresent throughout the series and should not be overlooked.<br />I mention these shortcomings simply because they're glaring in such a stupefyingly comprehensive collection. This is a must-own for me and should be for any serious fan of film. Twentieth Century Fox is to be commended for a collection that truly honors the series' fans and film connoisseurs in general.
B00006AG5N|4.0|This CD, like The Beatles 1, is a nice quick fix for Elvis fans who are in the mood for some good music from Elvis. If you're looking for 1 CD that has a lot of favorite hits and 1 new remix of an old song of his, then this is definitely the CD for you. I like to pull this CD out when I'm in the mood for some Elvis with out a lot of the movie tunes, and more of just the hits. If you like The Beatles and Elvis, and occasionally want to only hear the hits, then this CD is for your Elvis fix and above mentioned Beatles CD is your quick fix for them. Both CD's are very similar in the way they were put together to allow the fan to hear the number 1's and top 10's of these 2 pioneers in R&amp;R.
B000000H3W|4.0|Let me start out by saying sepultura really used to be the epitimy of heavy metal, but now they are just sad. they sold out and they just do not have the writing talent that Arise was so full of. This album despite there current state of self decay is pretty damn near a masterpiece. the song arise is one heavy mother f*cker and so is dead embrionic cells. desperate cry is one of my favorites on there and orgasmatron is incredible. i love motorhead but that song is just better. there isnt a bad song on this cd and it just has a dark heavy feeling throughout. i would definately reccomend u buy it if ur into metal and havent got a chance to listen to them. yeah i kick ass<br />sir didimus
B00004ZAV3|4.0|There really isn't anything on this CD that you haven't already heard by The Beatles. Yet it is still worth buying and listening to. All the cuts are familiar songs that you can sing along with and take you back to a time and place where you were when you first heard a certain song. This CD is a nice quick fix for you when you are in the mood to hear a few favorite tunes by the boys from Liverpool.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania is outstanding...what a voice. I did get a chance to see her live at the Mohegan Sun in CT. What a show she put on.<BR>And I think the Title &quot;She's not just a pretty face&quot; says it all.<BR>She is truly a great artist.  Can't wait to see her again.<BR>Continued success Shania!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Music has been in a slump for several years now, and now we get Jet to help bring it out.  I bought this album based on their single, and it delivers.  I was expecting a lot less than what i got.  I thought it might be one good song, and the rest was crap, but luckly i was wrong.
B00007G1ZC|1.0|My first recommendation is to rent it first - undoubtedly it will not be what you expect, good or bad.  This movie obviously has high production values, but the ultimate message of &quot;one with nature&quot; is really rather cheesily portrayed.  The same characters are seen in all the different episodes, which lessens the effect, and the acting is on a low-budget level.  Most of the time is spent watching people walk around and look around.  The cinematography can be impressive, but so much time is spent on each scene, that after so many number of camera angles it isn't as effective.  Some portions are so silly that I would be embarrassed to watch this with a group.  For example, the &quot;Fox wedding&quot; has a bunch of people dressed up with &quot;fox moustaches&quot; and the like.  Ultimately, the shortcomings make it too hard to enjoy and the whole effort is tiresome to sit through.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I wish I could rate this higher!!! Anyway,I Highly recommend this to ppl that are lovers of music,because I believe that you will thoroughly enjoy this disc.It is Excellent!After a couple of days you will not be able to get it out of your head-you will be completely intoxicated with this music it's truly a delightful treat to hear it:)You will want to hear it everyday!lol atleast,that's my experience,lol My Personal Opinion,of course.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is the first Britney album I ever purchased, because it's nothing like her others. Britney is growing up and this album proves it. She's not the new Madonna; she's where Madonna should have gone after Music. To compare this album to Christina is comparing apples to refrigerators. This isn't the \\"pop\\" we've been conditioned to. I think she'll get a much wider, albeit different audience with this album. She will loose some fans, as the other reviewers show, but she'll gain so many more.<br />The album is produced very well. The collaborations with other artists are apparent and give each song a very distinct edge that makes just about all of them single-worthy. She brings the subtlety back to being sexy.<br />I was definitely NOT a fan of Britney's music up until this album. She's gotten serious and ditched the bubblegum preteen virgin pop. I'm definitely on this bandwagon!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I personally liked the album entitled &quot;Britney&quot; better than this new release.I wouldn't recommend that you buy this Disc unless you are a hardcore fan of Britney Spears and you like every single thing that she does.I was really dissapointed when I first heard this cd.I thought I would like it but,it was so hard to listen to knowing that she could've done so much better:(but i know that her many fans will still like it and support her anyway;
B0000TB03W|5.0|Watching this DVD makes me re-live experience at Grant Park that night, which was completely AMAZING. In my opinion, Shania never disappoints when entertaining her fans, she's always so full of energy!!! The one tiny compliant I have about the DVD though, the footage of Shania around the city of Chicago, which was part of the TV broadcast, was not included on the DVD. Other than that, I have only one word, WOW.
B00004X01U|5.0|Wonderful.Go out and by it today.Or,rather stay in.lol
B0000DD7LB|5.0|She's Definatly Not A Girl Anymore... With Songs Like &quot;Touch Of My Hand&quot; &amp; Breathe On Me&quot; She Proves She's Grown Up... She Co-Wrote 8 Songs On The Cd.. Definatly In The Zone Is Britney's Best CD Yet.. The Bonus Remix Of Me Against The Music Has A Great Indian Style Beat... It Has 2 Great Ballads &quot;Shadow&quot; &amp; &quot;Everytime&quot; Both Very Good.. Like Me Against The Music REMIX &quot;The Hook Up&quot; &amp; &quot;Outrageous&quot; Have Indian Flavors To Them.. &quot;Toxic&quot; Something U Haven't Heard (Or At Least Not Me Anyways). &quot;Early Mornin&quot; Very Interesting Song. &quot;Brave New Girl&quot; Britney Goes Back To Her Pop Days With This Song. &quot;Showdown&quot; A Great Song. &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom&quot; HIp-Hop Style Song Thanks To The Ying Yang Twin. This Song Is Her Second Single.. <br />Definatly Worth Getting..
B00008S2VG|5.0|I Highly recommend this cd if u are a Madonna fan;U will love it!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Okay just got my Up in Chicago DVD....UNBELIEVABLE!!!!.     Those who haven't picked it up...RUN.  This is tons better than the televised special.  It's crisp, punchy very close-up includes lot's of never seen before close-ups it exudes tons of energy. <br />The televised special lost some energy and punchiness with all the commercial breaks the special although awesome does not compare to this DVD.  Anyone who's been to a Shania concert knows the woman doesn't stop the energy and vivaciousness goes on and on...this DVD captures Shania's breath-taking beauty and spirit and boundless energy.<BR> <BR>Please go out and buy it for yourself buy it for someone special they'll just love it.
B000002NJS|5.0|I Love This Album.I highly recommend it...I'ts very enchanting, it has a very spiritual nature,your soul will be longing for more and more after just one listen of Ray Of Light.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have been counting down the days until I could finally buy the album and listen to it and flip through the mini-booklet. When I finally bought it I opened it and threw it into my cd player, and started listening to it. I was so excited. All of the songs are great! Some better than others, but all of them are so good. <br />Me Against the Music- Such a great song. Wonderful single, and such a smart move to make it a collaboration with Madonna. GENIUS!<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom- Such a great song! Upbeat, fun to dance to, all around, just a great song. The record executives know exactly what they are doing. LoL<br />Showdown- I love this song! Its a great, slower song. The lyrics are good, the beat is good. I really like it. <br />Breathe On Me- I love this song. I love the lyrics, and some may say that she is going to far with this song, well guess what, she is 21. not 12. She is also one of the biggest recording artists...ever. So basically she can do whatever she wants and her true fans will still be there. Including me :). This song is awesome. Dont be narrow minded about it if you dont like Britney. <br />Early Mornin- This is a great song! I like everything about it! <br />Toxic- This song has to be one of my top three favorite songs on the whole album. It is so good, and I love the beat and everything about this song. Her vocals, the beat, the sound, its just all so great! I love this song!<br />Outrageous- This is a great dance song. It was written by R. Kelly, its so good! I love it a lot, and its a great song to dance to with your friends. <br />Touch of My Hand- I love this song! Its so good, I love the lyrics. It exudes female empowerment. I love that about this song. Also, the lyrics are tasteful and beautiful, and I think many people can relate to this song. Although some may not admit. LoL. Great song!<br />The Hook Up- I like this song a lot. I like the opening of it, too. It sounds really cool. Its a great club song, I love the lyrics and her vocals, too. <br />Shadow- Such a great, beautiful song. This is one of my other favorite songs because I can relate to the lyrics. Her vocals are very beautiful, and you can tell that she means what she is singing because of the emotion she is putting into the song. Its very beautiful. Christina may have the better voice, but Britney can really do ballads and get the haters to shut up. <br />Brave New Girl- I like this song a lot. The lyrics are great and so is the music. Everything about this song is good. Its a rapid song and its very fun to dance to. This is a great song! <br />Everytime- This is my top favorite song on the whole album. This might be because I can personally relate to it, but it is very beautiful, also. The music sounds like a musicbox, and her vocals are very beautiful. You have to admit that she has real talent. She is very beautiful and talented, in more than just singing. <br />I personally recommend that you purchase this album. It has everything that every pop album should have. Get rid of the wannabes like Hilary Duff, leave it to the pro's. Britney is here to stay, she isnt going anywhere, and if you dont like it, well too bad! In The Zone is awesome, and if you dont like Britney, I gurantee this album will change your mind, even if you just stay a closet fan :).
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Oh come on people, you can't be serious.  This CD does not stand against anything.  The producing is terrible, the songwriting is terrible, the lyrics are terrible, has she actually been able to hypnotize the world of music with her beauty and now sell anything?  This CD would not have been signed by any other artist other than Britney.  No label would have cared to listen to it.  And Britney, now that you are growing up.... actually do it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is the best one from Britney so far.  She sings on this album like she never has in the past; she shows her range and proves that she is going to be around a long time.  The best songs on the album are &quot;Shadow,&quot; &quot;Everytime,&quot; and &quot;Breathe On Me.&quot;  Britney added a personal feel to this album, especially on &quot;Everytime.&quot;  This new chapter to Britney's life just might not be able to be surpassed.
B00005QDW5|3.0|Facts: This is two discs of Pink Floyd songs.  It contains an unreleased song, &quot;When the Tigers Broke Free&quot;.  It contains the song Shine On You Crazy Diamond (parts 1-7), excluding a guitar solo and parts 8 and 9 from the original album Wish You Were Here.  It contains the title track (approx. 16 minutes) while originally released on Meddle it is more than 20 minutes.  It contains a shortened version of the song, &quot;Marooned&quot;, off of The Division Bell.<br />Opinion: The reader can probably see where I'm going with this.  Unless you would enjoy how all these songs are mixed together and manage to blend together, if you have all the necessary albums, just make your own mix of it.  Some of my favorite songs are cut short.<br />What I DO enjoy about this album is how is opens the ears of the listener to the earliest Pink Floyd through Set the Controls, Astronomy Domine, and a few others.  Also how it gives me an idea for what direction the band was going into when it released The Final Cut through a song like The Fletcher Memorial Home.  If you are disgusted by the turn that Pink Floyd made after Roger Waters was no longer with the band, you may have to just sit through or skip such songs as Sorrow, Learning to Fly, Keep Talking, and the tiny Marooned.  If you want to hear When the Tigers Broke Free, then you'll probably buy this thing anyway.  <br />If you have Dark Side of the Moon, you can scratch 4 songs off this album.  If you have The Wall, you can scratch off 4 more.  If you have WYWH, you can scratch off 2 chunks and with Meddle you can take away 2 more chunks.  That leaves you with 14 songs that you may enjoy discovering for the first time or you may not understand how they were all performed by the same band.  <br />My recommendation is to go with the way it should all be heard and go with the original albums that make up this &quot;Best of&quot;.  I hope this was helpful.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|At first glance, it could be argued that &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; differs only slightly from the version we've been used to for the past thirty-three years, yet these differences--program sequence, the substitution of two alternate takes, the deletion of one track, and the removal of Phil Spector's infamous &quot;wall of sound&quot;--add up to an album that is substantially more cohesive than the original, and has a harder, more muscular feel. It seems inevitable that Beatles fans will now be divided into two camps--those who love this album, and those who hate it. And the point has been made that it is impossible to tell whether this version is, as the publicity claims, the album that the group originally &quot;intended.&quot; All that said, the fact remains that &quot;Let It Be&quot; is much improved in this new incarnation. In this case, the whole is indeed more than the sum of its parts, and these seeming subtleties give a controversial classic a long-overdue new lease on life.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Although the theatrical version was very good, the Special Extended Edition of The Two Towers (TTT) blows it out of the water.<br />As with Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR), director Peter Jackson doesn't just tack on an extra 40 minutes.  Sometimes it's a different camera angle (for instance, watch for one during the Urak-Hai &quot;I smell man flesh...&quot; scene), or a new scene is added which perfectly segues into another scene (the theatrical version often seemed choppy at some points), or a scene is extended just long enough to give greater depth to it (see the above-mentioned Urak-Hai scene).<br />The sound quality is phenomenal.  One of the things my husband complained about the theatrical version is that the sound seemed drowned out.  Not a problem with this!  In the opening scene of Gandalf and the Balrog falling into the abyss, you can hear the crackling of the fire as if it were lit on your living room floor!<br />New flashbacks are used judiciously, especially one concerning Faramir.  It explains a lot about Faramir's motivations, whereas the theatrical version glossed over it.<br />I've only looked at a couple of the extras, and they were well thought out and interesting.  One is a documentary on Tolkien by writers as to where the origins of Middle Earth came from (and they talk about his literary style as well); another was editorial decisions on TTT.  The editorial documentary is a bit long, but you can get some idea of what went into the decisions to cut what scenes, which takes to use, etc.<br />The DVDs are in a box (naturally), this time in dark brown (while FOTR was in green).  The scene drawn on the back is of Legolas, Gimli, and Aragorn meeting someone in Fangorn Forest...<br />All in all, a splendid job, making a very good movie into a fantastic one!  Buy it - you won't regret it!
B0000E1ALR|1.0|It's bad enough that this guy literally raped the 911 victims and turned their horror into profit for his cd &quot;The Rising.&quot; Then, he made a song insulting police officers. All of this would be ok if he had any musical or vocal talent. The lyrics to most of his songs are clichs and he sings like he is on crack. His stadium shows, despite the hype, were NOT sellouts (Fox News reported that several thousand tickets had to be given away to many of his shows). Anybody who listens to this guy's music is a true zombie.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I was lucky enough to attend this show when it happened Live in Chicago! It was easily the greatest concert I have ever been to. It's a very rare occasion to be able to actually own a high-quality video of a concert that you were at- so of course I bought this DVD right away! It was everything I could have hoped for and more. Shania is the epidome of a performer. She owns that stage and her presence is astonishing. She sang every hit you could want to hear plus all her amazing new songs off her latest CD, &quot;Up!&quot;  I highly reccommend this DVD for any and every Shania fan out there!!!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|i am never going to touch drugs...ever<BR>this movie was a disturbing jolt of the realities of the streets. forcing us to recognizes our ignorant yet posh lives while comfortable im our little protecting homes totally oblivious to the sufferers of our crazy culture. <br />whoppaaai
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I liked some of Britney's older songs but was never moved enough to buy an of her albums or CD singles. However, when I heard the duet with Madonna off this album I thought it was very catchy, even though the song certainly sounds like it's against REAL music. Then, when I heard that Britney had actually written some songs on here and that she was going for a more adult audience, I decided to buy it today since in it's first week it is available extremely cheap.<br />Let's just say I'm glad I didn't spend much money on this CD. The single with Madonna is the only decent song on this CD, and let's just say Britney can't write any songs. At least she tried, right?<br />All in all, I do not recommend this album. The songs aren't catchy and all sound alike-like one big swirling mess.<br />I'm taking my copy to the used CD store shortly!
B000084T18|4.0|True enough thalbum may have been overrated.......50 came with tha heat. Between Dre's beats and 50's flow this album is a gangsta classic. <BR> I think in the future 50 should show more of his lyrical skillz, and not focus so much on wack ass Ja Rule and Murder Inc.<br />overall THIS IS A WESTSIDE CLASSIC!!!!!!<BR>WESSSSSSSTSIDE!!!!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Just to clarify for anyone who doesn't know what the deal is with this album, a summary follows: The Beatles were working on a concert/film/album entitled &quot;Get Back&quot;, which was intended as a &quot;back to basics&quot; album.  During the sessions, the band started to break apart, but moved on and made their final album, &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  While they worked on &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot; (now retitled &quot;Let It Be&quot;) was sitting around, and they let others take care of it without much involvement.  Eventually John Lennon brought legendary producer Phil Spector in to add his &quot;wall of sound&quot; treatment, overdubbing strings, orchestras, etc., which seemed to Paul to be the opposite of the original intent of the album (which they had agreed would have no overdubs).  Partially because of this (and, in particular, the overdubbing of strings on &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;), the Beatles broke up prior to the release of &quot;Let It Be&quot;.  (Ironically, &quot;Abbey Road&quot; actually made it out before &quot;Let It Be&quot; did.)<br />The surviving Beatles, Paul and Ringo (and, briefly, George) were somewhat involved in this project, which they fully supported, to remove Phil Spector's influence on the album.  The two albums are amazingly similar and startingly different. &quot;Naked&quot; is a much cleaner disc in many ways, the most obvious being the remastering and the removal of Phil Spector's overdubs.  Even the new track list seems preferable for several reasons.  &quot;Dig It&quot; and &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; have been removed, and I don't think many will particularly miss either.  The far superior &quot;Don't Let Me Down&quot; has been added, which was previously availble on &quot;Past Masters, Volume II&quot; in a slightly different format.  The new sequencing often feels more natural for reasons  I can't quite put my finger on.  I rather enjoy the combination of &quot;Two of Us&quot; followed by &quot;I'veGot a Feeling&quot;, but this is nothing I couldn't accomplish on my MP3 jukebox.  The removal of Phil Spector's overdubs does vastly improve the album, &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; in particular.<br />It seems at first that &quot;Naked&quot; is the clearly superior version of the two.  However, the album has lost a bit of its charm by cleaning itself up a little too much.  For instance, the dialogue snippets between songs featured on the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; are nonexistant, including the classic line about &quot;I hope we passed the audition&quot; at the end of the album.  I feel the removal of this is something of a shame, but this is one more reason why it is interesting to compare the two albums...  In an odd bit of irony, I also wonder if this may have been the worst choice of a Beatles album as far as remastering goes.  Somehow the slightly grainy sound of the original seems more suited to the purposes of the album.<br />And coming back to those purposes, you will be disappointed if you buy this album expecting &quot;Get Back&quot;.  This is, as mentioned above, exactly what it claims to be in the title: &quot;Let It Be&quot; with overdubs removed.  Anyone expecting more may end up feeling that they have thrown their money away, especially if they already have &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Anthology 3&quot;.<br />Which version is better?  It's hard to say.  &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; is probably better as a Beatles studio album, but may not be what people expected.  It has an excellent song selection, and is worth many relistens.  It may not be worth it if you already have &quot;Let It Be&quot; and the stripped-down versions of the songs featured on &quot;Anthology 3&quot;, which contains a de-Spectorized version of &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, among others.  You could basically put this album together from those two, so this is a bit disappointing.  The bonus disc (described below) does not contain any significant portionsof previously unreleased songs.  The liner notes are interesting, but not especially revealing for long-time fans.<br />With all of the little minor complaints, why rate it 5 stars?  Because it is truly a great album standing on its own, regardless of any specific expectations that anyone may have of it.  And despite having &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;Anthology 3&quot;, I still enjoy having this alternate version of the album.  Definitely worth a look/listen, especially if you're not familiar with the original.<br />BONUS DISC:<BR>The bonus disc contains twenty minutes of material on a single track.  The songs are played in these jam sessions are listed below. All lengths are in seconds:<br />Sun King (0:17)<BR>Don't Let Me Down (0:35)<BR>One After 909 (0:09)<BR>Because I Know You Love Me So (1:32) (Previously unreleased)<BR>Don't Pass Me By (0:03)<BR>Taking a Trip to Carolina (0:19) (Previously unreleased)<BR>John's Piano Piece (0:18) (Previously unreleased)<BR>Child of Nature (0:24) (Previously unreleased)<BR>Back in the U.S.S.R. (0:09)<BR>Every Little Thing (0:09)<BR>Don't Let Me Down (1:01)<BR>All Things Must Pass (0:21)<BR>She Came in Through the Bathroom Window (0:05)<BR>Paul's Piano Piece (1:01) (Previously unreleased)<BR>Get Back (0:15)<BR>Two of Us (0:22)<BR>Maggie Mae (0:22)<BR>Fancy My Chances With You (0:27) (Previously unreleased)<BR>Can You Dig It? (0:31)<BR>Get Back (0:32)<BR>(The rest of the time is taken by dialogue.)<br />The disc is interesting, but not incredibly revealing.  You hear snippets of conversation that give you an idea where the album is going.  Many may not feel inclined to listen all of the way through, although I did enjoy the disc.  Since these were not intended to be actual recordings, they go in and out of each song, so even those listed as a minute or more are rarely continuous.  You can see a bit of solo material here, notably George Harrison's &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; (later released on the album of the same title).  Perhaps most interesting is &quot;Child of Nature&quot;, which is brief, but very clearly the prototype of &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; from John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot;.  Interesting, but don't get the album just for this disc.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Once again Whitney has proven she is still the best. Even with dealing with the media constantly trying to get into her business she has proven she can sing.<br />This is a great collection of music where you can hear Whitneys strength. She has outdone herself. This Holiday album will be around for years to come.<br />Great Job Whitney.
B000001DTM|5.0|This could very well be my favorite album of theirs. I got my first dose of U2's music during 1995 when I first heard \\"New Year's Day\\" and another song called \\"One\\" on the radio in Chicago around that time. I eventually discovered that these songs were by U2 and eventually discovered their other hit songs from their \\"War\\" album through \\"Achtung Baby\\" and I have been a fan ever since then. U2's 1991 magnum opus \\"Achtung Baby\\" is easily one of the greatest rock albums ever made. There are a lot of reasons why this album is so. The music on this album is like nothing that they've done before or since then and is one of the greatest examples of a band completely reinventing itself. It's so hard to believe that this album, being so far ahead of it's time, is actually 12 years old now. \\"Achtung Baby\\" is so innovative in such a manner that it does not sound the slightest bit dated. To tell you the truth, U2 never sounded better than on this album.<br />The politically charged anthems that defined their 1980s albums are laid to rest and are replaced with more introspective lyrical writing dealing with everyday life and relationships but from a rather gloomy point of view. Musically speaking, they went into a totally different arena, moving away from the atmospherics of their 80s works and incorporated some grunge rock combined with punching industrial techno dabbling on here and the result is phenomenal. Every song on here is absolute brilliance like nothing else on any rock album. \\"Zooropa\\" while great, sometimes lacked the humanity and warmth that this album has and focused more on simply the electronic techno elements. \\"Pop\\" fared better at this. \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" kind of reminds me of this album to a degree but without a lot of the industrial electronica on here.<br />\\"One\\" is easily one of the greatest ballads U2 ever wrote and it's evident that Bono reached his peak on this song. This is a highly dramatic and emotional song that gradually builds up and reaches a climatic end. This album and song in particular was one of several songs on this album that got me through a rough point in my life after a close friend of mines died in a car accident in early 1999. As a result, \\"Achtung Baby\\" not only is one of two favorite albums by them but this album means something special to me. \\"Trying to Throw Your Arms around the World\\" is another track that helped me get through that sad period in my life and thus that song is a highly moving track. It's a very bittersweet and passionate song that gives me goose bumps every time I listen to it. Even before all the turmoil set in, these two songs made me a forever a fan of U2. The hit singles on here are just marvelous. \\"Even Better than the Real Thing\\" is just straight out fun. \\"Mysterious Ways\\" gets my nod as one of the best `sex appeal' songs that I've ever heard by any rock band or artist. The guitar punch at the beginning alone is unforgettable and the song has a highly danceable hip-hop oriented beat combined with electrifying guitars.<br />Even the non-singles on here merit a lot of attention. The opening track \\"Zoo Station\\" is the best opening song of any U2 album behind \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\". It starts with very odd guitar riffs and then electronic mechanical beats come in and the song becomes a very strange blend of rock, industrial and pop all mixed in one. Bono's distorted vocals on here are awesome to listen to and blend in perfectly with the songs mood instead of clashing with it. \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" is in my opinion one of U2's most underrated classics of all time being a highly dramatic yet fun song. I can't believe that this song didn't make it on their \\"Best of 1990-2000\\" collection. Some seem to not care much for \\"So Cruel\\" which is a shame as it's a chilling yet highly intelligent classic with an eerie and slightly creepy vibe to it. I'll admit, it took much longer for it to grow on me than the other songs but I now finally find it to be a marvelous song. The final track \\"Love Is Blindness\\" is a dark and mournful song with a very bitter and cold atmosphere to it. It starts with a haunting organ-like intro and becomes a mid-tempo rock oriented ballad with a dark and moody tone to it. Upon feeling that love and relationships seams to be becoming too media-oriented, I can really relate to the song title at times. This is an excellent closer to this album. The rest of the songs I didn't mention with this review also deserve a listen but the songs I mentioned are among the best on the album.<br /> While \\"The Joshua Tree\\" may be their commercial peak, \\"Achtung Baby\\" is by far their greatest and most ambitious artistic achievement in just about every way. Buy this album. If anything is anything, this album in my opinion, is where U2 came the closest to, if not reached perfection. I love both \\"Zooropa\\", \\"Pop\\" and even enjoy \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" a lot too but from my point of view, there is something that \\"Achtung Baby\\" has that seems to be missing on their latter works.. For all of the great reviews that I read on here, this album is arguably one of the greatest achievements not only in their career but also one of the greatest achievements in rock history. Along with many on here, I can easily say that while \\"The Joshua Tree\\" is their highest selling album, \\"Achtung Baby\\" is easily their best album. U2 fan or not, this album is a pivotal recording and is a highly recommended masterpiece for the ages.marvelous song.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Once again Whitney has outdone herself. More then ever she sounds strong, hits all the notes and has put me in the holiday spirit.<br />There are not very many Christmas CD's that I enjoy but this is definately a HIT, I have listended to it nonstop since I purchased it. I actually get goosebumps from some of the songs.<br />Once again Whitney has proven she is THE BEST.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I saw Shania in St.Paul on October 28th!  It was so much fun.  She even broke an attendance record!!  I love 'Shania's songs and her fun personality!  Even my 5 and 8 year old sons like her and enjoy watching her in concert!!!  Now, I can't wait to have her back in Minnesota for another concert!!!
B00003CXB4|5.0|My 3-year-old son and I watched the Lion King together and it was just as wonderful as it was when I saw it in the mid 90's.  It is a great movie! A must have for your Disney collection.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I like this a lot.  I really love the song with Madonna &quot;Me against the Music&quot;!!  I can't stop listening to it.  I also like &quot;Everytime&quot;!!
0385504209|5.0|A marvel of a book that perfectly blends the art of entertainment with wonderous, albeit theoretic, conclusions. I've read past reviews about this book being outlandish and completely out of line and all I have to say to those commentaries is: Get A Life! Well schooled in history, especially ancient history, I have only come to one factual conclusion in my life - that history is imperfect. Brown said it well himself, and I paraphrase, 'history is regurgitated fables that contstantly replay themselves.' If this is true, if history is indeed imperfect and merely blurred sketches of real truth, then isn't it safe to say that nothing is pristine - nothing is void of error? There are many instances where Brown might take some poetic license, but when he discusses the issue of women - he's dead on. His pagan and Native American (or tribal) research and how they respected women as great contributors to that perfect balance, (ying/yang), is well documented in many respected historical texts. I'm afraid that some of our devout Christian readers would like to 'turn the other cheek' when it comes to women's suffering and how it relates to the Church, but the truth is the Church very much fostered centuries of the feminine banishment from civilization (i.e: Salem). Being a man of faith myself, I personally cannot be swayed from believing in a higher power, however, I welcome all challenges knowing that I am only human and admittedly no squat when it comes to this immense universe we all share. Logically, it makes sense that we all came from 'some' kind of higher source, but acting like I definitely know what that source is just underlines how human I truly am. So for all you Bible beaters out there take notice, the Bible was written by man, man himself is imperfect (the Good Book would be the first to admit to that!), so the question begs - isn't the Bible somewhat imperfect? And if so, how is Brown any more misguided? I mean, he is a man - who wrote a book.

B0000TB03W|5.0|This DVD is a must buy for yourself and a great gift for a friend. I was at the concert and the DVD really captures the spirit and energy of a live Shania show. 2+ hours of great music by a great singer/songwriter with the best back up band in music today. Not a dull moment nor a bad song, and the DVD includes several songs that were cut to fit the concert in the time slot they had when it aired on TV.
B0000844IT|5.0|Army of Darkness is a B-movie done with such style, humor and finess that it has attained cult classic status.  The acting is goofy, the special effects are &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;-esque, and Ash seems to get his shotgun out of nowhere after coming out of the pit; but, you love it anyway cause its funny and good for a viewing at anytime of the day or night.<br />This edition of Army of Darkness is particularly special because you get the full-length theatrical release of Army of Darkness and the full-length director's cut (and not just the ending to the director's cut) in addition to a gaggle of interesting extras. <br />In my opinion, I'm glad that the studio made the director go back and recut the movie.  The theatrical ending is a lot funnier and more in line with the over-the-top tone of the movie.  Moreover, forgoing the other footage from the director's cut helps the pacing of the film enormously... but that's just my opinion.<br />If you are a fan of silly, over-the-top comedy with a satirical bent, Army of Darkness is definitely for you!
B0000TB03W|5.0|A must buy for any fan. I was at this concert in Chicago's Grant Park and the DVD captures the energy of her live show. Shania is the best singer/songwriter around today and this DVD is a 2+ hour live show of 22 hit songs (many of which were deleted when this concert aired on TV). She is also backed by one of the best supporting bands in music. Buy it! You won't be disappointed.
B000001IPL|5.0|The 90s are sooo dead! Can you remember the feeling in the air in that time? I remember everything was so right on, every one was ok with the music. Now were so devided by pop, and people starting to not care..I think its the end. I really think that whole collective feeling you got from the 60s-90s will never happen again. I remember this CD so very well, it was wonderful. I had turned 9, march 21st 1995. So for my birthday my mom took me to see the offspring in concert, march 25 1995. For some reason I remember them playing the album in its entirety. I would kill for a setlist, but I would kill even more for a bootleg tape of that show! About the album- well I cant tell you what youll like, i dont even like the 90s stuff anymore. Im more into the 70s thing now, but when I was a kid then it was a GREAT happy album so just buy it and get it over with. &quot;something to believe in&quot; was my fav
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is probally Britney's best work yet.  Every song seemed like a hit, very hip and clubbie.
B00004YX39|4.0|A common misconseption is that this album is 80s when its actually 1979. They just didnt release it then due to high record prices. Funny but Supertramp was recording &quot;breakfast in america&quot; the same time these guys were cranking this album out in 79`. Certainly is not as exciting as Aja!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania gives it her all on this great DVD! Her performances featured on her are excellent! She's an excellent entertainer &amp; knows how to have fun with the crowd! I highly recommend this to anyone who is a Shania fan!
B0000CAQ27|4.0|This is my first album by Pink....here is what I thought of the album song by song. <BR>1.Trouble....5/5 Excellent song...great beat...very upbeat!<BR>2.If God is a DJ 4.5/5 Another Great song....excellent tune! Starts out kinda with angst in the voice of the singer<BR>3.Last to Know 4/5 Excellent anthem to those that have those psycho ex's. <BR>4.Tonights the Night 4/5 Pretty good tune...upbeat<BR>5. Oh my God 3/5 This one is OK...kinda weak<BR>6. Catch Me While I'm Sleeping 3/5 Not one of my favorites, kinda slow <BR>7.Waiting for Love 3/5 Same as Catch me While I am Sleeping<BR>8.Save my Life 2/5 Way too slow, I dont care for or about this song at all...could have skipped this one<BR>9.Try to Hard 2.5/5 This one could also be skipped. Not my song. <BR>10. Humble Neighborhoods 4/5 Great Beat....Neat Song!!<BR>11.Walk Away 3/5 This one is OK <BR>12. Unwind 2.5/5 This one is OK...I think if I listen to it more, it may grow on me<BR>13. Love Song 2.75/5 This one is a definate love song....does not belong on this album. Pink had a good thing on here, it is a good song, just does not belong on here. <br />Overall Score of the Album<BR>4/5<BR>This is a good album to get started on if you do not have a PINK album. There are some songs that are great and some that are so-so!  Looking forward to the next recording
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Amazing... and the amazing part is how clean and fresh the music sounds!... it's like 'the lads' are right here on the other side of my PC monitor jammin' just for me.  I just compared the 'new' I've Got A Feeling with the version on Anthology 3 and I had never noticed the slight tape hiss in the background before... all that is cleaned up now...especially the vocals.<br /><br />  I think this is the 1st time I've picked up a Beatles release the day it hit the streets.  It is amazing how the magic (&amp; hype) continues after 40 years!!... there certainly was a big bag of talent in those four musicians!... especially when compared with many other groups since!<br />  The bonus disc with the new release is just a 20 minute teaser... with snippets of conversations and partial tunes (some previously unreleased)... I would have appreciated it better if it had included a little more complete versions of the 1/2 dozen 'new' songs.<br /><br />  It was kinda weird... last night when I spun the CD for the 1st time... it was like listening to some brand new music from the band... and it (we) ROCKED!  But for now I'll just...Let It Be.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|No matter what they do they still progress successfully. This album rocks, start to finish (Except for the ballad Vacant) Petucci- What can I say his God given talen will always blow my mind. After listening to him it almost makes me want to stop playing guitar. His writing skills are trumendous. I just love how this album flows. There are certain \\"Tributes\\" to their older music. Listen to This dying soul and half way through the ong you'll hear a few riffs from 6 degrees. The drums blow you away. They mixed this album perfectly with the bass. Everything is heard which again shows Petrucci's talent for producing the album Stop reading my review and go get it.
B00005V9HH|5.0|The Usual Suspects is a very effective movie for several reasons.  One lesser reason the film is good is the surprise ending, which is a shocker and comes at you from out of nowhere.  However, I don't think the movie depends completely on the ending; it works regardless.  In fact, I don't think the ending is all that great, for reasons I will mention later.<br />The story centers around a supposed drug bust gone bad.  Roughly 90 million dollars worth of narcotics were on a ship and a group of notorious criminals were assembled to get the money.  The very beginning of the film shows that things got out of hand and the boat actually exploded, with practically all people in the vicinity being killed.<br />The criminals were chosen by a character named Keyser Sose (so-say) who is so renowned for his criminal actions that the mere mention of his name brings panic and fear.  We see a flashback of his cold blooded nature: when thieves took over his house and threatened his family, he walked in calmly, shot his family first, and then shot the bad guys.  The implication is that he will kill instantly and without remorse.  He is almost mythical, no one has ever seen him and lived to tell it, and some don't even believe in his existence.  All five criminals (played by Gabriel Byrne, Kevin Pollack, Kevin Spacey, Benicio del Torro, and Stephen Baldwin) have done something to hurt Sose in the past, and so this is their chance to redeem themselves.  The cast is great, all bring the proper amount of intensity to their roles.<br />After the explosion, only Verbal (Spacey) is left.  He is brought in for questioning, given immunity for his information, and on his way out the door, answers a few more questions for Agent Kujay (Chazz Palminteri), where he talks about the whole situation.  We only see what happened through Verbal's eyes.  In this way, the movie is like the classic Rashomon or the more recent and much less effective Basic, where we see information through the eyes of onevery closely involved.  How much of what we see is the truth is the real mystery.<br />The ending is a surprise, and very well done, but I don't think the movie gave enough clues in order for us as viewers to figure it out.  In that sense, it almost cheats a little, because it's easy to fool someone when you don't give them a chance to solve the riddle.  Even keeping that in mind, though, this movie is one of the better mystery thrillers I have seen in some time.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Run, don't walk to get this dvd !!  Shania's Chicago concert was phenomenal and through the dvd you can relive it.  With the addition of songs not shown on the tv special this dvd is a must buy for Shania fans.
B0000CFW87|5.0|WOW WOW WOW WOW! No words can describe the amazing talent this man shows in his work on this CD. Such a strong opening song, Oceano, and doesn't look back! For even the person not into this style, this is one of those CDs that will even baffle them! This is amazing work and I only wish to see more of it! <BR>My favorite songs from the CD are Oceano, Broken Vow(also on Concert CD), You Raise Me Up.. well all of them are favorites, but through one listen through the CD, those stand out as top quality songs!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney has left me breathless with the release of this holiday CD.  Her voice explodes with power and range often leaving you stunned and overwhelmed with emotion.  This is a must have if you are a true Whitney fan.  It brings to mind her performance on the Bodyguard soundtrack (the raw power of her vocals).<br />My favorite at the moment is her rendition of Have Yourself A Merry Christmas.  You better sing Whitney.... I can feel the passion of this song from start to finish.  Her daughter shines on the Little Drummer Boy too.<br />All I can say is WHITNEY IS BACK.<BR>Merry Christmas to all.<br />One more thing.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this CD.  STOP HATING ON HER.  OK, she has had her share of problems, but lets move on and let her past stay in the past.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This Britney cd is the best yet. The songs are great, the lyrics are great, and the sound is great. Once again Britney has created a wonderful album. I definately recommend buying it. Christina Watch out you can't compete with this!
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie, adapted from a novella by Stephen King, crosses and defies the conventions of prison genre tales. Yes, there's violence, rioting, brutality, graft, dishonesty among officials, power politics - but it's really a story about faith in friendship and the raw skills of survival in an alien place.<BR>Tim Robbins plays the role of Andy, a banker who is sent to Shawshank Prison for murder. There he meets Red (Morgan Freeman in one of his very best roles), a lifer whose regular appeals for parole are just as regularly turned down. Andy, with his banking and organizational skills, becomes indespensible to the crooked warden, who is skimming money and taking payoffs. Then Andy escapes through a hole he's dug over the passage of several decades, a hole in his cell covered by a big poster of Raquel Welch - and in the process...well, I'll say no more, in case you haven't yet seen this superb film. <BR>... Shawshank Redemption is undoubtedly one of the best - and the closing 5-6 minutes are watchable over and over and over.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Hey, first off I just want to tell everyone that, just like you guys, I'm no big Britney fan but I'm not a hater either. She just pops up on the radio and her music is tolerable. I was on AOL when I saw a chance to listen to the full CD. I did and man I was surpised. Being a 16 year old guy, Britney Spears wouldnt exactly be a CD I would crave to buy but I did. You people complain that she's too pop? This CD is very different and Britney is at her height of creativity. The first single \\"Me Against The Music\\" is already something different ( featuring Madonna ) total club hit. Awesome. There's even a little r&b with \\"(I got the) Boom Boom\\" featuring the Ying Yang Twins. There's also quite a bit of Middle Eastern influence.. and... my favorite, asian instrumental influence on the track \\"Touch Of My Hand.\\" You ever watch those ancient chineese movies and you start to hear some haunting music? Well, thats the type Britney uses and it sounds AWESOME! And... A little techno on \\"New Brave Girl\\". What I can't believe is her ballads. They are good and actually... her songs arent so sex-craved as people said in the past. Is her voice great? no.. Is it horrible? no. Don't complain, this is pop and pop isnt about the best voice or the best lyrics, its about the most enjoyable, fun, danceable. If all you care about is deep meaningful lyrics and high pitches, listen to adult alternative and leave pop alone. For Parents: This one is actually ok for kids except for a little swearing towards the end.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|i listened to this album on mtv.com's the leak. this album is by far britney's WORST album! i read somewhere that it's a \\"dance\\" album. the only true dance song is \\"breathe on me\\" the rest of the album is pretty much britney trying to be a japanense pop star.<br />the first single isn't even catchy and i can't believe madonna would degrade herself and do something with someone who obviously copies everything she ever done!<br />the album itself gets old fast i tried to listen to it twice and it got old really fast!<br />she tries to get the \\"hip\\" producers for this album and instead of REALLY working on it she just spit out something rap filled and dated.<br />reagee might be the hot thing now,but in a few months NO ONE will be listening to this album!<br />she tries her HARDEST to be madonna during the \\"erotica\\" era,but unfortently for britney it just comes off chessy!<br />she also rips off the doors \\"light my fire\\" in \\"early morin'\\"<br />by saying \\"baby you light my fire now let's get a little higher\\"<br />this album makes \\"britney\\" look like a masterpeice!<br />britney is betraying her longtime fans with this album.<br />the song \\"brave new girl\\" britney basically rips off madonna's \\"die another day\\" and is barely audioable!<br />\\"everytime\\" has got to be the most depressing ballad i ever heard!<br />if we're lucky this is britney's last album!<br />whenever madonna did something sexual there was a deeper meaning behind it!<br />but when britney does it there's no meaning!<br />good thing i listened to this on mtv.com and didn't waste my hard earned cash!<br />\\"me aganist the music\\" is a terrible song and for britney to do a trip hop album now is  laughable!<br />tip hop was cool during the gansta rap time <br />britney should have already known this instead of trying to sound like she knew club music when she doesn't!<br />trip hop is no longer being played in clubs!<br />britney tries to be like kylie mingoue with the \\"breathe on me\\" song which is britney's verison of \\"come into my world\\" by kyile!<br />skip this album you WILL be dissapointed!<br />go buy pink's new album or christina's stipped album! at least those two have proven to be musicians unlike britney!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is the whole package.  What an entertainer!!  This is a great collection of footage.  Well worth the money.
B0000009TJ|5.0|I have to take issue with kireviewer's review.  This is a recording of the band, not just one element of it, but the entirety.  The song list is excellent and it is not just a pile of novelty tunes.  Unfortunately, one really needs to understand the historical perspective to be able to fully appreciate these recordings.  I recommend &quot;Electric don Quixote&quot; by Neil Slavin for those unfamiliar with the intricies of Frank's professional life.<br />As just one example of what I'm getting at, this disc was a change of style with respect to how Frank had been assembling his recorded music.  First off, many of his albums had a foundation from tracks recorded live, with some tracks pulled off of the multitrack live master, then overdubs (sometimes MANY overdubs) were later added in the studio.  At other times, solos were pulled off of one live tape and dubbed onto backing tracks from another performance - at times from a totally different song and maybe with the tape speed or even direction changed.  Frank was a tireless pioneer of studio technology and recording and mastering technique and what you heard on a disc often never happened anywhere but in his imagination, which was then crafted in the studio into the product.<br />This album was a huge switch, back to earlier days in a way.  These are live recordings with ZERO overdubs.  If you want to know what his music sounded like live back in the 80's, just listen to these discs.  His bands never quite met his expectations, but they were leaps and bounds, even light years ahead of any other band I've ever heard live - and I've heard quite a few that claimed to be the best.  Now, like I said, there are no overdubs, but what was done in some circumstances was to take part of a song from one performance and edit into a different performance, to capture the best parts of each.  It's easy to tell when this was done by reading the liner notes.  For example, &quot;The Eric Dolphy Memorial Barbecue&quot; was assembled from performances in Syracuse, NY and Detroit, MI, but don't expect to hear the edits.  I was at the Detroit show and that's my voice you hear in the background, saying: &quot;You guys are the greatest!&quot;  And they were.<br />About the song list: again, excellent.  19 tracks were from one location, 8 were assembled as mentioned above from two different locations.  Tunes from all periods of Frank's career, with numerous cover tunes thrown in for color, including Ring of Fire, I Left My Heart In San Francisco, Bolero, Purple Haze, Sunshine Of Your Love, When Irish Eyes Are Smiling, Godfather Theme Part II, Theme From Bonanza and Stairway To Heaven.  How's that for variety?  Of the Zappa tunes, we are treated to new arrangements of numerous tracks, including Heavy Duty Judy.  We have some excellent instrumentals, including Zoot Allures, Sofa #1 and an incredible performance of The Torture Never Stops.  Lots of American folks didn't get to see this tour, but I did and it was incredible, just like this set!!!m performances in Syracuse, NY and Detroit, MI, but don't expect to hear the edits.

B0000CDLA7|4.0|I'm not sure what people expect sometimes. <BR>Train of Thought is absolutely awesome. The musical performances here are simply fantatastic. Evertime DT releases and album, it seems slightly influenced by what's currently happening in music at the time, but DT always ends up showing everyone how it 'should' be done. Almost like they are 'social commentators'  except with music. <BR>The album, yes, is not quite as broadly epic as previous works, althought 'This Dying Soul' is out of this world, the opener 'As I Am' is straightforward but effective, and 'Honor Thy Father' is maddeningly good. 'Endless Sacrafice' also really gave me an 'Images and Words' vibe, especially on the intro and after the choruses, which felt very nice. James also proves on this song and throughout the record, that he is further beginning to understand his own vocal range, thus making him sound much more talented a singer.<BR>I guess what I am trying to say is that a band cannot make their best album with each outing (well, maybe Tool does, but I don't think they are human beings sometimes), yet Train of Thought fits nicely into DT's catalogue. Just listen to this right after Falling Into Infinity (a good album but below DT's standards) and you will realize how silly it was to call this album anything but great.<BR>It sure sounds like DT just wanted to rock out after all that heady, yet wonderful, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence insanity. In my opinion, no band sounds better just rocking out than DT.
B00005RY7X|5.0|After listening to this CD I realized what I'd been missing for the last 20 years.  I felt like a wall of music had fallen on me, and I wanted more!  When this CD goes in the player, there's no turning the volume down... it can only go UP!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|REALLY, unusual for Paramount because:<br />1. they have done a superb job tranfering it to DVD (it looks like it was filmed yesterday and not in 1967!)<br />2. they have released it with loads of extras<br />3. they have preserved the original aspect ratio (anamorphic!)<br />4. they have released it at a bargain price (2 DVD set)
0792163710|5.0|I just wanted to address the reviewer below who bemoaned the fact that Shane is presented in a pan &amp; scan format - It IS NOT Cropped, but is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 (or 4x3).  Most older movies were shot in this format....So enjoy it in all its splendor as it was intended to be seen.  <br />This disc is a great deal too....good to see Paramount coming down out of the clouds with their pricing finally.
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Here is what happens when Mr McCartney is left to gaurd the legacy, a cleaned up version of the long and winding road. First let me say I am a huge beatles fan, I probably listen to at least a couple songs a week if not a album or so. What we are given with Let it Be...Naked is remixed songs known all too well. And what happened to George Harrison's great guitar playing on I Dig a Pony and I've Got a Feeling; mixed down, so we now can hear Billy Prestons noodling a bit louder. Mind you I like Billy Preston. The remix is about giving us a drier mix; funny after first listen, most of Paul's vocals seem louder, even on the Lennon songs. So they've cut out all the talking, this does not present the beatles naked, just redone. The edits of I Me Mine still standing. The heavy reverb on the fade out of Across the Universe and the backgroud singing on let it be, not so naked in my opinion. I guess I am mad that I thought I might hear something new here. I was taken in or just stupid. Well, now...the bonus disc, little teases of things we fans might have wanted to hear more off, just glimpses, no full versions of anything and scrubbed clean chatter about... a planned concert the no one really missed. Maybe I was looking for a closer version to the original Get Back project or something closer to a Beatles basement tapes CD. Bootlegs win out. I can see why George walked out in the middle of the project and John needed Yoko by his side the whole time. The CD is a huge disappointment. Thank god the strings are gone, but give me a louder and more present George Harrison with a little reverb any day. Phil Spector might not have been so stupid.
B000002GKT|5.0|There's nothing humble about this recording; one of the quintessential Fillmore releases, and in some ways much better than the much-touted 'Allman Brothers Live at the Fillmore' album.<br />&quot;I'm Ready&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and &quot;I Don't Need No Doctor&quot; are the precursors to what meat'n'potatoes stateside rock would become with KISS, Blue Oyster Cult, and Cheap Trick, but blues-based rock and roll of this calibre, you just can't find anymore.<br />Absolutely phenomenal performance, wonderful sound, and rockin' attitude that's on par with any other live album on the market.  Much better than Peter Frampton's overblown Winterland concert.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is an AMAZING concert that no one should miss! If you were not able to go to Chicago and watch it live, then you should really purchace this DVD! Shania is awesome and her music is just great! This is an awesome present for anyone during any time of year! You will love it and so will the person that you get this for!
0345350499|5.0|I love this book, and I can not stress that enough. If you are a female, and a fan of Arthurian Legend, I am also sure you will love this book. It is a twist from the original, and it is written from the woman's point of view (Morgan). Although this book will be a favorite among woman, I am more than sure men will love it as well. Bradley, goes indebt with each of her characters, making you feel as though you know them, as though you are them. This book has become a favorite of mine. I can read it again, and again and still I never bore of it.  It is obvious that Bradley did much research on the Old Religion, and the time frame this book takes place in. It is magick, and beauty.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Did you all know that today, November 18th, 2003, is Mickey Mouse's 75th birthday.  Fittingly, Britney Spears has released her fourth CD today.  <br />I would say Britney's latest effort is a Mickey Mouse record, but that would be a deep insult - and a great disservice - to Mickey Mouse.  <br />Happy birthday, Mickey!!!!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Wow! What can I say!? Shania and her band have such chemistry together! I highly advise any Shania fan to get this if they haven't already. Shania's voice, attitude, charisma just take concerts to a whole new level! This DVD shows that beautifully! Shania can only go Up! Up! Up! From Here!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Sometimes knowing too much about the making of an album makes the listening experience less enjoyable. In this case, knowing how The Beatles felt about the original &quot;overproduction&quot; of the album brings this new release to novelty status at best.<br />The stripped down songs make for one or two rounds of curious listening. Having grown up hearing them played a certain way, these versions will never replace the ones we've heard for over 30 years. But as we've all heard for so long that the band simply hated what Phil Spector did to the album, now we have the opportunity to hear how it was without his help. <br />I think I still prefer the Spector version of The Long &amp; Winding Road...
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have always liked Britney Spears but could never bring myself to buy her music because it was garnered more or less to a teen audience especially young girls. Also, whenever I saw her do a show, she would always lip sync and I could never accept that. It is obvious, that she is no Christina Aguliera or Whitney Houston in voice but she she has the body of a goddess and great energetic dance moves. I would not define this cd as a crossover from an earlier audience of mostly teens to an adult audience. It is a combination of both. Britney is finding her place. I bought this cd soley for the ME AGAINST THE MUSIC duet with Madonna which also includes a dance remix.(Target stores also has it on sale for a nice price). I was very impressed with every single song on this album, some more than others. The first time I saw Britney sing for real was when she sang EVERYTIME(track 12) on a night show. In this song, she bears her heart and soul. It is truly a beautiful song and probably the best on this disc. SHOWDOWN(track3) is hypnotic, groovy and danceable. BREATH ON ME(track4) is sexy. It reminds of Madonna's WHERE LIFE BEGINS on her EROTICA CD because  the songs are talking or sending a message about a certain kind of sex. Like Britney, TOUCH OF MY HAND(track8)is a safe and personal pleasure that we are both guilty of. It is a kewl song. R. Kellys OUTRAGEOUS(track7) is bound to be a hit with a hot steamy video to match. SEX, SEX, SEX. It is a R&B and POP classic that I believe will heat up the charts in time to come. I do not know who the Ying Yang Twins are but I GOT THAT BOOM BOOM(track2) is \\"off da chain.\\" So is THE HOOK UP(track9) with its melodious reggae grooves. If Britney does a video for the latter it would be nice if it is filmed in Jamaica. <BR>Britney's Duet with Madonna on ME AGAINST THE MUSIC does not define this cd. This latest release by Britney can surely stand on it's own even without ME AGAINST THE MUSIC. Sure enough, some Madonna fans like myself will buy or have bought this cd just <BR>for this hit song only to realize that this cd is truly great. I can honestly say that I have ABSOLUTELY NO REGRETS!
B0000C6E4D|2.0|Wow, what a disappointment. All the songs sound the same, and some even do a good job of impersonating Enya. Her last 2 cds were so fantastic, that if they were records they'd be worn out. <br />Melodically speaking, the songs are really weak. Lyrics are about the same, songs about love, sensitivity, support, and lots of soulfullness, but the mixing and producing stink, it is hard to hear her voice under all the bland instrumentals.<br />I've seen so many great artists drift into mediocrity, madonna, sting, phil collins, just to name a few. I won't be taking this one to the used cd store, but I can't recommend buying this one. <br />Rex.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is not an impressive album. I thought maybe Britney would make a good comeback after her 6 month hiatus. The songs aren't anything to write home about. They are extremely ordinary. She sounds constipated in Me Against the Music, and sadly that's the best song on there. Unfortunately she hasn't developed her &quot;talent&quot; much at all, she still sounds babyish, her singing is nothing compared to Christina Aguilera. I think eventually people will get sick of her image and she'll have nothing left to really offer.
B00005QIPH|1.0|What do you get when you take a style of music that's been played for years by NY bands, and put it in the hands of a bunch of heavily connected European-boarding-school-bred Manhattan elitist snobs?  The next big thing!!  Pop history!!   Stop being suckers everyone.  <br />The Strokes aren't the worst thing I've ever heard, but they sure as hell aren't going to change the face of music.  Make the rich richer sheep!!!
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie was a poorly written book that restates the same ideas over and over. Morrie is a professor that is dying of ALS and shares one last &quot;class&quot; with one of his former students. He has an exceptional attitude about his approaching death and tries to share his messages about life and living with Mitch. Mitch seems to be focused on what society sees as success; power and wealth. With this as his focus, Mitch is deeply touched by Morrie's views of life and happiness. Morrie repeatedly tells Mitch not to focus on wealth and power, that true happiness lies in the simple things. Morrie says to focus on family and nature, spirituality and not &quot;selling out&quot;. Many people have shared these ideas for hundreds of years, but perhaps Morrie's situation is what makes his advice seem more life altering.<BR>The book overall was okay, the message was the same as several others I have read. Perhaps my expectations were too high, therefore leaving me disappointed. The book had great potential, but was not written as well as it could have been.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|This movie has made me laugh and cry since i was a little girl watching this with my grandmother.  I would sit in her lap until 1 in the morning, metally analyzing this movie for what its worth. even through my child's mind, i appreciated this truly beautiful, carefree, and heartfelt movie.
B00009TB5G|5.0|While I am sure that gushing reviews irritate cynics and nitpickers immensely, I have to applaud P.Jackson's (and his team's) work. This is a wonderful improvement on the original and while not to everyone's taste is an incredible achievement. And to those who think that Peter made a mistake in the scene with Frodo and the Nazgul in Osgiliath, may I point out that if they reflect a little further they may notice that there is no inconsistency at all. Let us not try to be too eager too find fault, eh?
B0000TB03W|5.0|Anyone who saw the TV special, only got the tip of the iceberg.<BR>The entire concert was a feast of high energy action as only <BR>Shania can provide it. All 22 songs from 3 of her albums had the<BR>crowd singing and dancing from the first note to the last.<BR>Shani adds some fans to the mix letting them sing along with her<BR>both from the crowd and onstage, and has an especially touching<BR>moment with a surprise propossal to by a fan to his girlfriend<BR>live on stage. No one who is even remotely a Shania, fan be it pop<BR>or rock should be without this dvd, whether you taped the show or not. I give it 2 big thumbs &quot;UP&quot;!
B000000W5L|5.0|You don't get more low down and dirty than &quot;Exile on Main Street.&quot;  This cd is raw and nasty and as addictive as nicotine.  It's a mixed bag of rock, country, soul, gospel and blues.  It's unapologetic, rebellious and streetwise.  Plainly stated, it has all the ingredients necessary to make the perfect rock and roll album.<br />&quot;Exile..&quot; grabs you by the throat from the very first song, &quot;Rocks Off,&quot; and makes the tone of the entire album perfectly clear (Headed for the overload/Splattered on the dirty road/Kick me like you've kicked before/I can't even feel the pain no more). Shortly following are the standout tracks &quot;Tumbling Dice,&quot; full of gospel soul, &quot;Sweet Virginia,&quot; a dive bar lament, and then &quot;Torn and Frayed,&quot; &quot;Sweet Black Angel,&quot; and &quot;Loving Cup,&quot; one right after the other.  Then just when you catch your breath, you're hit with the mindblowing &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot; and then the Beatlesesque &quot;Let it Loose&quot;.  But the top prize, in this reviewer's opinion, comes at the end with the fantastic &quot;Shine a Light&quot;.  Rock just doesn't get much better than that.<br />One of the Best Rock Albums of All Time.
B0000TB050|5.0|After watching this DVD I said to my wife that I thought I discovered gold. The DVD is amazing throughout and the Bonus track when Bono's daughter Eve comes on stage and dances to Mysterious Ways is awesome. Go buy it.
B00000IPAX|5.0|Going Away To College<BR>I listened to this song almost daily between the time I graduated for high school and started my first semester of college. The lyrics that really seemed to characterize how I felt were &quot;I haven't been this scared in a long time / And I'm so unprepared ...&quot;<br />What's My Age Again?<BR>This was the song that prompted me to buy the CD, mostly because all of the play it got on the radio. I've had boyfriends that really make me think of this song: one in particular thought his farting loudly in public was funny.<BR>       <BR>Adam's Song<BR>This was MY song when I was 17.  I really identified with the lyrics &quot;16 just held such better days.&quot; I would also change the words a little bit for &quot;please tell Mom this is not her fault&quot; to &quot;please tell Mom this is all her fault.&quot;  I was a little angry as a teenager.<BR>       <BR>All The Small Things<BR>&quot;Work sucks, I know&quot;. :c) This was the second song that prompted me to buy the CD. It was getting a lot of radio play.  It always makes me think of &quot;Don't sweat the small stuff...and remember it's all small stuff.&quot;<br />The Party Song<BR>This song cracks me up. It is just fun to listen to from a female perspective.<br />I really don't listen to the other songs on the CD that much, so I don't have any opinions about them.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|...Christmas came early this year and thanks to Whitney Houston,<BR>holiday music has been elevated.  Much has been made of the drama<BR>of Whitney, however the reason why she is the superstar that she is rests in the pipes that she brings to tackle this album of holiday songs.  Whitney lets loose like we've never heard her before, yet she maintains the crisp enunciation and awe-inspiring control of her instrument.  Her lower range oozes with soul and conviction and although we may not hear those spiraling high notes, Whitney knows how to use her instrument like none other.  It is encouraging to know that there are singers still<BR>around and Whitney ups the the competition a notch with her<BR>sense of soul and warmth.  We've been waiting for this album!
B00005OWIU|4.0|When I bought this, I really wanted &quot;Hedwig's Theme.&quot; Being a fan of John Williams, I was pleased to find out that he composed and conducted the music, as well as produced the album. Some the the music is outstanding, something that I can listen to over and over again.  Without the visuals from the music, other songs just seem to drag on forever (Invisible Cloak, Library Scene), but fortunately, most of the CD is great to listen to and is one that can play in the background without being obnoxious and disturbing your day.
6305878323|5.0|This film is one of the best Walt Disney ever made!! I have a twenty month old daughter and even she stops to watch \\"Mary Poppins\\"!! I even sing \\"A Spoonful of Sugar\\" while I clean house!! It is hands down a brilliant piece of cinematic history! You can't go wrong with Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke!
0385504209|3.0|The pacing of the story is great.  The author certainly manages to grab your interest at the end of every chapter, forcing you to continue reading to satisfy your curiosity.  So I was never bored.  But I was expecting brilliance and instead I found that the mystery and the puzzles were just ok.  The characters were mediocre.  Even though some may find the religious topic thought provoking, this book doesn't require deep thinking.  I read this book very quickly.  I think I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't heard all the rave reviews.  Entertaining read, but no wows from this reader.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Okay- those of you who are so critical of Britney and saying that Christina is better need to just not put your opinion because you're obviously missing the point.  Britney has never tried to be an &quot;amazing&quot; singer.  She just wants her listners to enjoy and want to move.  And she accomplishes that here.  With the majority of these tracks, it is impossible not to want to dance!  And her ballads have imroved SOOOO much since the first album, and &quot;everytime&quot; is amazing....she wrote it give her props.  She's an amazing performer who just wants her fans to have fun...not reward her for voice of the year, or smash her down for not being as good as Christina, or any other such baloney.  She looks amazing and gets way too much trash written about the way she looks and how she poses and what she does.  If anybody needs to be talked to about these things it's little miss Christina, so take a break from bashing Britney and reevaluate who has values, do you see Britney pulling the diva stuff that Christina is lately?...no!  And Britney's albums are sooooo much more fun than hers...as in the zone demonstrates.  Buy it you won't regret it.  i promise
B0000TB050|5.0|If you are any kind of U2 fan, you need to pick up this DVD ASAP!! The show is unbelievable. You can tell that Bono and the boys are having fun playing in front of their home crowd, it shows in their performance. All of the songs are great, with an especially powerful Sunday Bloody Sunday being my favorite of the show. U2 Go Home blows away the Boston Elevation DVD in my mind, which was an incredible show in its own right. Do yourself a favor and pick this up pronto!!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|All the politics and history of Let It Be aside, this is a great album on its own. In many ways is closer to the rock n roll the Beatles started out doing rather than the more produced White Album or Abby Road. With Paul's 'Get Back,' 'Let It Be,' and 'Long and Winding Road,' and John's 'Don't Let Me Down,' and 'Across the Universe,' this album is still far better than most of the crap out there. So here's the lowdown:<br />1) The main differences in this album from the orignal are on the tracks 'Across the Universe,' 'Long and Winding Road,' and 'Let It Be.' Without Spectors treatment these songs sound almost 'unplugged' and sparce though in my opinion closer to actual rock and roll then before. <BR>2) If you are an avid Beatles fan this disc is essential---the sound quality alone is worth it. I was especially happy with the clarity on 'I've Got A Feeling.' All the fuzz and feedback are gone you can actually hear the great contributions that Billy Preston made to these recordings on the organ.----HOWEVER, if you are a novice Beatles fan I still suggest the original album with Spector's Wall of Sound, it is easy to appreciate and includes the songs 'Maggie Mae' and 'Dig It' which this album SADLY does not. Just remember that you will not be getting 'Don't Let Me Down.'<BR>3) The extra disc is very interesting and contains many of the studio sound clips that Spector had originally mixed on the album. HOWEVER, I was upset that there were no almost no clips of the Beatles arguing and breaking up like we all know they did at that time--it seemed a bit whitewashed but the bonus disc comes at no extra cost, so I can't complain.<br />You will be happy with this disc regardless of how you feel about the Spector controvery or the politics. It is a great album on its own and deserved a second look.
B00003CX5P|4.0|I wass soooooo excited to hear that they were making 3 prequels.  I went and bought the 1st 3 just to remeber.  I had a blast watching the 1st second and 3rd.  Then, I went in to the theater wioth my piopcorn and they turned down the lights and it wasn't half bad.  If your comparing it to the other Stars Wars, Well, that's like comparing Wayne's World to National Lampoon's Vacation.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I saw Shania in concert in Chicago at the United Center on October 22, 2003 I won 2 balcony seats from US99 . This is the best concert I have been too and I for sure would like to see Shania again!
B00004XPP0|4.0|Well, I'm smart enough to know that the Force is just some weird cfreature he made up.  But apperently it's Canadas #1 reiligon.  I don't think that he intended to yake people away from God, which is why I'm not really mad, more as dumb-founed.  Other than that this movie is great.  It's about a boy named Luke Skywalker terying to deafeat Darth Vader.  But he also has to learn how to use the force.  And he must stop the emporor.  It's great.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|This is the newest hits collection from the King of Pop, released due to contractual obligation. Even though everything but &quot;One More Chance&quot; is previously released material, this CD has to be judged based on the music.  These are the songs that defined an era.  &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Beat It&quot;, and &quot;Thriller&quot; are three songs and videos that every pop artist today is still trying to duplicate. The &quot;Bad&quot; era is well reperesented, and the 90's are somewhat, although the number 1 R&amp;B hit &quot;Remember the Time&quot; is missing.  No big deal, if you own &quot;Dangerous&quot;.  Michael Jackson may never approach the level of success he once had, but he will always be the King of Pop.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|Well i've always have been a big fan of george harrison since I was a kid and first heard them(The Beatles) in 1964. I was lucky enough to have met him in 1974(I worked his Dark Horse plane-ground crew at LAX) along with billy preston, andy newmark, ravi shankar...then again in 1979, grand prix races in LongBeach(he was in the pit station handing out his new GEORGE HARRISON album- I said&quot;George&quot; and he turned around and I took his picture) so that was a real treat in Life to meet and see an elevated Soul such as George Harrison in this Life time...The DVD is absolutely beautiful in purple with a wonderful booklet of information...What a great great tribute his dear and close friends put on for him in his honor..I've watched it many times and will watch it many times again for this is surely a treasure chest of beautiful music for all to enjoy for it will leave you with a feeling of sadness for the loss of such a wonderful man who wrote so many many soulful songs to remember him bye..he will indeed be missed by all who loved him in their own way for all he gave to the World...
B0000A36J5|4.0|Having watched both extended films back-to-back, we escaped to Middle-Earth for more than six hours.  With the second film, I had hoped Peter Jackson had rectified some errors from The Two Towers -- which we had only seen thrice when compared to the dozen times we watched Fellowship in movie theaters.<br />I felt a great thrill throughout the first disc, because it followed the quality set by Fellowship's extended edition.  Frodo and Sam receive a better introduction.  Smeagol-Gollum plays more with pathos, although I miss his 'origin' story.  <BR>Who could argue with scenes for Gandalf and Eomer, reduced to walk-ons during the theatrical cut?  Initially, Treebeard shows decisiveness - In the text, he does not need 'convincing' to fight Saruman.  My hopes were buoyed when disc one ended.<br />However, the second disc contains the same elements that discouraged me from returning to see The Two Towers.  Arwen's tearful scenes with Elrond were romantic padding then and now. I feel Viggo Mortenson's Aragorn has little chemistry with Liv Tyler's Arwen.  I concede the necessity for Peter Jackson to bring love interest, but this subplot grows very tiresome.<br />I feel more narrative should have been provided to explain the coming of Haldir.  Instead, we have Galadriel's token voiceover playing through recycled footage.  I know there had to be one scene from Lorien cut from the original -- where did it go?<br />Helm's Deep actually suffers from poor editing.  One scene shows Aragorn plummeting from the scaling ladder, yet within seconds, he's already at the gates with King Theoden.  I also quibble with King Theoden's unwillingness to fight openly -- much like Treebeard, he is largely reduced to a passive character.<br />On the subject of the Ents, the new scenes built me up for a reinvigorated Entmoot, but aside from some whimsical scenes with Merry and Pippin, it's the same result.  Peter Jackson really missed a chance to follow Tolkien more closely for the fans. <br />Faramir receives much-needed development, but I never doubted David Wenham was the right actor.  His actions in the film make more sense, given his relationship to Boromir and Denethor -- another fine cast with John Noble.  Nonetheless, I still dispute Frodo's scene with the Nazgul -- wouldn't this have alerted Sauron to send the remaining Ringwraiths to Osgiliath?<br />The Two Towers extended edition benefits from sweeping camera angles, clearer characterizations of the Rohirrim, and the solid production values.  However, Middle-Earth does not mesh well with Hollywood, and the cracks are beginning to show.  7/10
B000002KCC|5.0|Rarely can music that is this bad be so good. This is what happens when five or six guys decide to throw a wake for a couple of fallen comrades, lock themselves in a studio with a lot of booze and drugs and record the results. The playing, naturally by Young's grungy band Crazy Horse, is generally as woozy and out of tune as Young's singing. Yet the context of &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; is the downside of fame, particularly an indictment of hard drugs, which permeates the majority of the songs. Particular gems are &quot;Speakin' Out&quot;, &quot;Tired Eyes,&quot; &quot;Albequrque&quot;, &quot;Lookout Joe&quot; and of course, the infamous title track, offered at both the start and closing of the album (the first, but not the last time Young has done this.) As a statement of freedom of expression, this album stands alongside &quot;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&quot; for all it's brutal rawness. This music is not'produced', in the normal sense of the term. You hear mike hits, mistakes (and the subsequent chuckles), voices that can't quite hit the notes (&quot;Mellow My Mind&quot; in particular)...I'm sure a lot of people's reactions was, &quot;Is this the same Neil Young who made 'Harvest'?!&quot; Yes it is. An album like &quot;Harvest&quot; is the work of a songwriter writing songs. &quot;Tonight's The Night&quot; is the work of a songwriter telling it like it is. Musical fame is not all ladies and limos; it can be dark and you can die from it. This may be a depressing message, sure, but you have to admire Young and his musician's for not caring and just letting it all hang out.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Now I have alwayz been a Britney Spears fan....I have been waiting for Britneys 4th album forever. Now that it's out it's good to see that this is her BEST album yet. This album was worth the wait. Britney has a whole new sound and the beats are awsome and new so if you think that britney is nothin but a hoe who cant sing then you are sooo wrong....Listen to this album and you will see for yourself that this is her BEST work yet. My favorite songs are &quot;Everytime&quot; &quot;Touch of my hand&quot; and &quot;whole new girl&quot;....these songs are GREAT.So go out and get this album...it is so worth it.
B000002UD0|4.0|Shunning the political sloganeering of his previous solo albums, on &quot;Walls And Bridges&quot; Lennon set out to make &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; Part II. Here we have Lennon once again exploring his inner feelings, with the perspective of somebody who has sobered up after a long binge, which was indeed the case when the album was recorded. Separated from Yoko Ono, Lennon had spent a year in Los Angeles drinking, smoking and snorting himself to death while making a failed attempt at getting back to his roots. Then he came to his senses, which is where &quot;Walls And Bridges&quot; comes in. Easily the most produced (posibly even overproduced) of all of his solo work, most of the music borders on adult contemporary rather than the raw rock and roll Lennon based his reputation on. He discusses his newfound sobriety (&quot;Whatever Gets You Thru The Night&quot;, a duet with Elton John which became an unlikely #1, &quot;Nobody Loves You When You're Down And Out&quot;), loss of Ono (&quot;Bless You&quot;, &quot;Going Down On Love&quot;) and even business manager Allen Klein's betrayal (&quot;Steel And Glass&quot;, which attacks Klein in the same way &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; did to McCartney.) Of course, there is some old Beatles-style surrealism (&quot;Old Dirt Road&quot;, &quot;#9 Dream&quot;) and even a guitar and horn laden instrumental (&quot;Beef Jerky&quot;) just to ease the melancholy feel of the rest of the material. Yet, after the failure of &quot;Sometime In New York City&quot; (an album doomed to failure no matter what) and &quot;Mind Games&quot;, you sense that Lennon was conciously trying to recapture the Beatles style in the arrangements. Perhaps trying too hard...in my opinion, the five &quot;Walls And Bridges&quot; demos found on the posthumous &quot;Menlove Avenue&quot; album are superior, since they are stripped down ala &quot;Plastic Ono Band&quot; and fit into that context better (apparently the demos for all the &quot;Walls And Bridges&quot;tracks can be found on a bootleg called &quot;Something Special And Rare&quot;.) In hindsight, considering &quot;Double Fantasy&quot;'s weaknesses: the collaboration with Ono, and Lennon's determination to fall back on cliches, &quot;Walls And Bridges&quot; is his most varied album stylistically and his last real solo album. But you couldn't blame him for 'retiring' afterwards...he'd pretty much said and done it all.
B00007E8V4|4.0|ok, after reading so many reviews about how political this band is and whatever i decided i had to add my 2 cents in. first off, system of a down is kind of political, they are not as political as some people say they are. if u think htis is political, listen to rage against the machine. they are way more political and angry than system, system is still cool tho. <br />this album is very good, but not as good as their first one. toxicity is by far my least favorite, but this and the self titled cd are both very well done. all in all buy this cd, but dont expect another rage against the machine, because u will be VERY dissapointed.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Because Spector we have two \\"Let It Bes\\", the old one and the new naked version...  The old women chorus in \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" (maybe mother,sister and Spector's auntie) and the unnecesary arrangements in Across the Universe made this record possible.  Thank for Everything Spector!!!!  Long Live to the Beatles!!!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|After two years of relative silence (music-wise) Britney has released her much anticipated fourth album.  Its a decent effor which sticks to the classic Britney formula and style, but with an updated sound filled with slick production, and not quite as blatantly poppy songs. &quot;It&quot; producer of a few years ago, Max Martin, is nowhere to be found as Britney does an impressive number of collabs.  So here is the breakdown...                  <BR>1) Me Against The Music - A good first single and collab with Madonna that is great to dance to and pretty catchy.  Not much to say as its really a choice of preference for htis one.<br />2) I Got THat (Boom Boom) - One big change on this album is Britney's use of sampling, something that wasn't so apparent on earlier albums.  This track has got a country banjo sample that makes the song unique.  A possible single as it'll probably do good in the clubs, although I don't think its the strongest song on the album.<br />3) The Showdown - The backbeat to this song is really good, although Britney herself doesn't do much singing, more whispering.  The chorus is sorta rasta-influenced, and very head-bopping worthy.<br />4) Breathe On Me - An avant garde Britney?  This track reminds me a bit of something Madonna would release, or of the Annie Lennox track &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;...its at that pace where you can't quite dance to it slow or fast, but is a good song nonetheless.<br />5) Early Mornin' - This is Moby's collab. with Britney and you can hear it in the samples used, giving the song a very urban feeling...in fact it doesn't even sound like Britney is singing the chorus.  Good track tho'<br />6) Toxic - Again another song that uses samples, this time a string orchestra on acid, suitable for the song which borrows from the house genre.  Very different song from other stuff shes done.<br />7) Outrageous - R Kelly's track for Britney, don't be expecting a slow jam like 'ignition' but rather it explores the trendy Indian music trend (Ex: Baby Boy by Beyonce) and is a possible single again for club playage, in fact it sorta reminds me of the track &quot;Boys&quot; from her last album.<br />8) Touch Of My Hand - I don't really want to explore hwat the lyrics of this song are about, it has an interesting production to it, lotsa different styles infused into one, but not really a stand-out fo rme.<br />9) The Hook-Up - Sounds like Sean-Paul invaded Britney's album for a few minutes in this catchy track that is perfect for the bars if she releases it.  Good track!<br />10) Shadow - Probably one of my fave songs on the album because its so different.  Very new age and dreamy, altho as it goes on it gets more and more poppy...really really nice, especially the beginning.<br />11) Brand New Girl - Probably the most poppy song on the album, but goes back to the 80's for its influence, rather then Britney's earlier stuff.  Similar to Madonna type tracks, employing an almost-rap by Britney, and heavy use of the Vocoder.<br />12) Everytime - Amazingly Britney wrote the piano riff featured in this song, which is quite similar to some of her other ballads of yore.  Not bad but not great.<br />13) Me Against The Music Remix - Again the Indian trend is big and Britney's first single is remixed in this fun bouncy version.  A nice bonus feature to the disc.<br />All in all if you are a fan of Britney's this album doesn't disappoint, but if you are looking for a new revolutionary disc, don't expect htat eitehr.  Britney takes big new steps (not of the dirrty variety) to a new sound and image but isn't quite ready for hte drastic changes a la Madonna.
B00003CX95|5.0|1995 Academy Award winner<BR>Rated R<BR>Color with a running time of approx. 3hrs<BR>Mel Gibson was the director and played the lead role with Sophie Marceau as his supporting actress.<br />Mel Gibson portrays William Wallace in this historic tale of Scotland's greatest hero. No one knew of this great hero until Mel Gibson brought his story to life.  Wallace believed in freedom and fought for it, not only for his self but also for his country.  This historical epic shares with the viewers the good/bad and dark/light during the era of Wallace's time.  It enlightens us to what the people did to survive and provide for their families.  Gibson made a remarkable movie of Wallace's triumphs and controversies.  Braveheart is an excellent movie that will warm your heart.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|First of all, my disc #2 is fine.This is a real treat. Filmed and presented in anamorphic widescreen(16x9), the picture quality, when displayed correctly,is crisp and sharp. Forget about what this looked like in the CBS special.The audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround or PCM digital.It's the sheer joy of the band interacting with an INCREDIBLE crowd that makes this one of the best shows of the tour. Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up........Five stars.
B00008H2LB|5.0|First let me start off saying Linkin Park is a truly awesome and unique band. But as I've been looking over everyone else's reviews on both Meteora and Hybrid Theory, people confuse Linkin Park with so many genre's. It's either &quot;If you want REAL pop rock get Justin Timberlake&quot; or &quot;If you want REAL rock get Alice in Chains,&quot; or &quot;If you want REAL hip hop get 2pac&quot;.<BR> Wake up, LP isn't just one genre. It's a mixture of all of those above plus the synthesizers used frequently. I guess because this is one of the only bands to combine all of these, not many like it. <BR> It's either the rap fans hating the screaming/rock to it, or the rock fans hating the rapping part. And to those who think they're too much like Justin Timberlake, lets try hearing JT with his high squeaky voice belt out those songs.<BR> And as for sounding too much like Limp Bizkit, try giving Fred Durst a dictionary and see if he can actually think up half decent lyrics without using the &quot;F&quot; word every other line, so that you actually have an idea what he's singing about in the first place.<BR>  This band is all about opinion, on whether or not you like changes or appreciate many different types of music. You got to appreciate many types of instrumentals and vocals to appreciate LP. Sure it takes some gettng used to, but dare to be different. Too many bands have the same music lately, don't you want to hear something unique and different for once? LP is just what your looking for then. Try it, you might enjoy what you hear.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine Dion is an awesome performer and this package is just a tip of what she has to offers. You will need to get her other cds to truly appreciate her. The new tracks all are great and none of them weak.  A must Buy.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Shania is a great performer and she is very energetic.  If you notice, all of her songs are very positive.  They are never about failed relationships or hard times.  She deserves more credit than she gets!   This is a must have DVD for every Shania Fan!!

B0000TB03W|5.0|Well, Shania as done it again!!!!!!!! She's a GREAT ENTERTAINER!! I really like it when the artist gets involved with their audience, and Shania as done that with UP! Live in Chicago....its just not there its anywhere that she touches someones heart.The DVD is great!<BR>Thanks Shania<BR>A Loyal Fan
B000023VR6|3.0|I would not say this is a classic cd, but it is still good nonetheless. Nice jams like forget about dre, still dre among others but some get lost in the mix with tracks that could have been left out off the cd.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have never been a Britney Spears fan, due to her sugary pop songs. This cd is another step for Britney, away from her days as a teen sensation. Yes it is sexual, but the songs have awesome beats, and it's great to put on for driving music. I love Me Against the Music, and Toxic especially, just because they are great to dance to. I'm not a dance music fan, but this worth picking up!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This cd is just plain awful. I agree with the other reviewer on this. Pink Try This cd is better musically than this. Madonna does not even help this cd at all. the entire cd sounds like rejectes from the previous album and some actually some like I'm a slave 4 you.
B0000CD5I6|4.0|Long-time Tull fan here, so there's the obligatory bias warning. Like many Tull fans, I thought a Tull Xmas album would be a logical extension of the career at this point.  Very few rock bands could pull of a serious Christmas, but it's done here.  Good on you, Tull boys!  As a Christmas album, it's excellent.  As a Tull album, it's good...well executed playing in places but sometimes nothing terribly new.  This disc is a case of the whole being stronger than the sum of the parts bringing in all elements of Tullness in a nice holiday package.  It belongs in heavy rotation on your CD player while flitting around doing your holiday chores in the house.<br />Of the three originals, \\"Birthday Card At Christmas\\" and \\"First Snow on Brooklyn\\" satisfy very nicely; \\"Last Man At The Party\\" is humorous but not as strong.  Of the re-recorded original Christmas songs from the Tull catalog, \\"Jack Frost and the Hooded Crow\\" significantly improves on the original, is the best song of the CD, and is an overall great five-star track.  The original version of \\"Another Christmas Song,\\" a favorite of mine in any season, fares better than the remake which is well executed but I don't think anything was really added to it.  It's there; it's nice.  \\"A Christmas Song\\" seems a little flat.<br />\\"Weathercock,\\" \\"Fires At Midnight,\\" and \\"Ring Out Solstice Bells\\" - Christmasy if not Christmas songs - belong here and are well-placed, delivered well enough but again nothing new is added.  I found \\"Bouree\\" to be plodding at the start, uninspired, and then revs up pretty much by the numbers.  A handful of other traditional holiday-inspired instrumentals are included. \\"Pavane,\\" \\"Greensleeved,\\" and \\"We Five Kings\\" are great moments on this disc.  I would have preferred a more tradional rendition of \\"God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen\\" this time out.  We've enough jazzy versions on record at this point I think, but it's well played and I was toe-tapping along.   Martin's excellent \\"A Winter Snowscape\\" closesthe disc and is probably the strongest instrumental on the disc.  <br />In short, this is Tull uncovering some old chesnuts, throwing a couple new things in the mix, and delivering a nice CD that on a whole comes off stronger than a couple parts when taken individually might suggest.  Makes a a good stocking stuffer if you want to pass it on to any people unfamilar with Tull, which I will be doing.  As a Christmas album 4 stars, as a Tull album 3 on the understand that a 3-star Tull disc is better than most all the drivel on the radio...since it's for the holiday season it gets a seasonally appropriate, well-earned 4 stars.  If it weren't a Christmas album, it would still be a welcome addition to the catalog, but as a Christmas album it's cozy and familiar, which is what we want at Christmas.  Happy holidays.
B00005JMEW|5.0|Yeeaaaahh!!!<br />Without a doubt Tarantino has set out to make the kind of movie that HE wants to see - and you should be glad that the studio has let him have his way. So if you are movie buff then you will be in heaven for the next two hours. However mainstream cinema goers may shy away from the heavy amounts of splatter violence, themes of extremely bad taste and what seems to be a very shallow plot.<br />First of all, Kill Bill is comprised of several different genres and themes stemming from femme fatal, the Yakuza, Spaghetti Westerns, Kick Boxer, Japanese Manga Anime, Lone Wolf and Cub, and Star Trek! Essentially the plot is simple. Uma Thurman plays a woman called **** a.k.a Black Mamba who is avenging the death or her unborn child after her wedding massacre. There seems to be some past employment link between her and a mafia of trained assassins led by an unseen Bill (David Carradine) and this is revealed in flashback style as **** goes about seeking her revenge. All of the characters have a background which is fleshed out visually during lots of these various flashback pieces that are extremely bloody and graphically violent in nature. In fact Kill Bill looks likely too be one of the most goriest movies ever made... however it is also extremely funny. There are so many taboo elements brought up like pedophilia, coma patient rape, parents graphically murdered in front of their children and women killing other women (Extremely violently I might add) but Tarantino manages to make us laugh at these things every other five minutes. Seriously - this film makes fun of all the things that you would generally shy away from even under the influence of a few bottles of saki. It is an extremely black violent comedy in many ways, but at the same time you can not help sitting there in awe as Tarantino pulls out every trick in the book and then some more. The Manga type cartoon in the middle will either turn you off or blow your mind... it sure did mine!<br />The ending is a real cliff-hanger and although this is not Tarantinos best film by a long shot it is certainly his most ambitious work to date - if not one of the most ambitious films this century.<br />By the way - did I mention that the film was extremely bloody? The GORE and I mean G O R E on display here is like nothing you have ever seen before. There is a shot of the Japanese club after a violent wake in what has to be one of the most longest and bloody battle sequences ever filmed. You have never seen anything like it, nor will you again.<br />The are some downsides to the film. The end fight sequence has too many pauses and some parts do drag on for five minutes more than they should which leads us to suspect that pieces of this film have been extended to help make up for the running time of what is a film of two parts. However these misgivings are easily cast aside by the sheer energy that is on display here. So if you got the stomach for it then you know what to do - Go watch the killing of Bill.<br />Role on the bloody part deux!is a real cliff-hanger and although this is not Tarantinos best film by a long shot it is certainly his most ambitious work to date - if not one of the most ambitious films this century. <br />By the way - did I mention that the film was extremely bloody?

0385504209|1.0|There must a million fourth-graders out there writing better sentences that this: &quot;As he stood up, Langdon was beginning suspect it was going to be...&quot; - wait for it everybody - &quot;a very long night.&quot; Cue: End of Chapter.  Dark and stormy, too no doubt.<br />Why are uni-dimensional-characters-in-a-spot always suspicious of the nocturnal dimensions?  I guess if they knew the date and their latitude they could work out the actual length of the night for themselves, and so could we...  And why don't readers ever find them in the middle of suspecting it, or even just a little after they have completed suspecting it?<br />Did that sentence make you just want to keep on reading?  Yeah, but something else... Does his editorial review team at Doubleday have no shame in allowing that miscarriage of a sentence to see the light of day?  And that's just the worst of a thousand other bland and featureless cliches.<br /><br />This book should have been an ironically humorous footnote in Eco's Templar book, Foucault's Pendulum.  In fact I think it was - the bit about vanity publishers for any text that mentions the Templars and the Holy Grail.  And the &quot;cryptology&quot; is risible.  You want to read about codes, try Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon.  Or The Times crossword.<br />Can anyone tell me what any of the characters actually look like other than the, sigh, albino?  There is just no description and absolutely zero development of these flat cut-out characters; its all plot, plot, plot.  I assume that Dan Brown (or his editorial team) had anticipated us imagining Harrison Ford as Langdon and Julia Roberts as Sophie, and so didn't bother any further with that tedious stuff.<br />Oh, what a silly plot this book has.  It really is nothing more than a MacGuffin movie, say Frantic, mixed with Holy Blood, Holy Grail.  Exceptionally unimaginitive.<br />I had just finished Vernon God Little when I started on this.  What a contrast!  There no code in this review and none intended.  Vernon was a dance in language by a unique and humorous voice.

B000006PYU|4.0|On \\"The Robert Johnson Songbook\\", and its 13-track companion volume \\"Hot Foot Powder\\", Peter Green goes through all of Robert Johnson's twenty-nine recorded songs. Or rather through twenty-seven of them, according to the track list here on Amazon, which doesn't feature \\"Kind Hearted Woman Blues\\" or \\"Terraplane Blues\\" (they are both on my CD, however, but that may be a European thing).    The arrangements are mostly acoustic, featuring guitars and dobros, piano and the occational harp, and while former Fleetwood Mac-guitarist Green's vocals aren't excactly powerful, he sings with a lot of soul and an impeccable sense of rhythm, sounding in fact very much like Eric Clapton.  Bad Company's Paul Rodgers guests on a couple of tracks, and vocal group Street Angels 98 lend a distinct gospel-like flavour to \\"Last Fair Deal Gone Down\\".    This isn't aggressive electric blues with lots of fiery lead guitar, rather it's mellow and rather faithful to Johnson's original readings. And virtually every song is excellent, from the classic guitar/piano duet on \\"When You Got A Good Friend\\" and the harp-driven \\"Stop Breakin' Down Blues\\", to the Paul Rodgers-sung \\"I Believe I'll Dust My Broom\\" and the delightful low-key rendition of \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\".  And Robert Johnson's version of \\"Walking Blues\\", which incorporates the rhythm, the phrasing and even the main slide guitar riff from Son House's \\"Death Letter\\", sounds even more than usual like \\"Death Letter\\". Not that I'm complaining, I love that song!    There isn't a whole lot to complain about here, actually. This is Robert Johnson's songs, after all, and while Peter Green has updated the arrangements to a certain degree, he doesn't really alter any of the songs enough to offend any Johnson lovers. A little bit more variation might be nice, but \\"The Robert Johnson Songbook\\" is a perfectly good record as it is.  And it's successor, \\"Hot Food Powder\\", is even better, so don't forget to pick up both of them.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this CD, it has a darkness and beauty that reminds of an Anne Rice novel. Its something that you would hear of either Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel. Fallen is wonderful
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Theoretically this is a \\"Beatles\\" album so it deserves at least 3 stars....technically it's Paul McCartney influenced remix of the original.  You can not call this \\"The Beatles\\" without George & John.  My guess is Ringo went along for the ride ($$$$$$$$).  Nothing makes this more apparent than the ommision of John's song \\"Dig It\\" & his \\"hark the herald angels come\\" comment right before the song \\"Let It Be\\" (John's comment was a little dig at the religious overtones of the song \\"Let It Be\\"). For some reason, Paul feels the need to rewrite the Beatles legacy in his favor. John got into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame first, you can't change history, so just get over it already!  I have not looked yet, but it will be interesting to see if the song credits are still listed as Lennon/McCartney.  I guess if one's current musical output is not selling albums, why not go ahead and cash in on the past.  I just find it amusing, hypocritical, ironic or whatever word fits,  the title of this album is \\"Let It Be\\"!  Anyway, having voiced my personal beliefs on the reason for this albums existence, the overall sound on the album is excellent; very reminiscent of Paul's \\"McCartney\\" or \\"Ram\\" solo albums. The stripped down sound benefits a few tracks like \\"Get Back\\" & \\"Long & Winding Road\\".  I know many people have written about John's \\"inept\\" bassline during \\"L & W Road\\", but often it's the human flaws that make something even better; and the version on this album is better than the \\"original\\".  I also prefer George's  more distorted solo on the song \\"Let It Be\\" compared to the more reverbed one used here.       Anyway, all Beatles fans will purchase this regardless of any reviews.  My advice for anyone who does not have the original Phil Spector produced \\"Let It Be\\", do yourself (and the Beatles legacy) justice and purchase that one first (or at least both together).

B0000B1OFL|4.0|A film by F. Gary Gray<br />I didn't think much of this movie from watching the trailer.  It looked a little cheap and cheesy and I didn't expect it to be remotely worth watching.  Then it started to make money and I started hearing positive word of mouth reports about the movie.  It became one of those \\"sleeper\\" hits that nobody expected, least of all me.  After all of the positive word on this movie, I gave it a shot.  Happily, I can report that the movie is actually quite good.<br />The movie opens in the midst of a heist.  Charlie (Mark Whalberg) is the leader of the group pulling off this heist.  It is audacious (stealing quite a bit of gold bricks) and it is creative in how it is pulled off.  It ends with a nice chase sequence and naturally they get away with it.  I'm not giving anything away.  Just when they've gotten away with it, one of the members of the group pulls a double cross.  Steve (Edward Norton) had his own plan in place to take the gold for himself, and he kills one member and gets away with it.  Again, I'm not spoiling the movie, I'm setting it up.  This is all exposition.<br />The main story comes some time after this.  Charlie finds out where Steve is living (in extravagant wealth), and he pulls together the old crew to rob Steve of the gold that Steve stole from the crew.  They add Stella (Charlize Theron) to the crew (for reasons that I'm not quite prepared to spoil) and plan the new heist.  There is some suspense and interesting gadgets, until it is time for the heist.  This is when things really pick up and we get to the point of the whole movie: the chase.<br />The simple fact is that is movie is a lot of fun.  It is very fast paced, and is like a quick reading novel.  It moves fast, keeps you interested, and gives a satisfying conclusion.  The acting is fine for what it is, and this is a stylish movie.  This movie will never win any major awards, but it doesn't have to.  It's better than most typical summer movies, and I would definitely recommend it.<br />The Italian Job co-stars Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham.nitely recommend it.  <br />The Italian Job co-stars Seth Green, Donald Sutherland, and Jason Statham.
1563890119|5.0|To start - Neil Gaiman is an immaculate genre writer, who blends in sophistication with the bizarre in almost all of his projects.  The Sandman Series is certainly one of his best works and , of course, keeps getting better.  I must admit, I'm currently on the Seventh Chapter, but the first book: &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; deserves a lot of recognition. <br />I had been warned that the first collection of his comics was one of the weaker installments.  But so far, I must disagree.  &quot;Preludes and Nocturnes&quot; is a fantastic introduction to the character of Dream.  For those who have not yet read started this series, the book opens with a underground society of necromantic cultists, in England, the early 1900's.  In an attempt to capture the divine personification of Death - they accidently capture her brother, Dream.  Though, this doesn't ensure immortality to the cultists anymore, they keep him bound in hopes of bargaining his freedom for power.  After imprisonment for almost a century, Dream finally escapes and takes his revenge on his captors.   The rest of the book, finds Dream severly weakened and missing his three artifacts, and sources of his power: his bag of sand, helmet and amulet.  Because of his absence, the items have fallen into the hands of others and his kingdom and responsibilities, having been neglected during his imprisonment, have all crumbled.  He spends the rest of the book reclaiming his lost possessions and reestablishing his authority as the Lord of Dreams.<br />For a writer who really didn't know where his story was going, Gaiman has given us an intriguing world to visit.  He intergrates the modern world and ordinary mortal characters with elements of the supernatural and mythology.  One cannot help but be fascinated by such scenes as Dream challenging a deamon to a duel of spoken words and image, while in a 1930's style bar in Hell.  The book contains a variety of colorful characters and an original storyline that really sets the stage for the rest of the series.  Also, being a graphic novel really adds to its presentation.  The images are sometimes beyond literary comprehension and now I just couldn't imagine just reading this story.  Gaiman has a way of creating images to vivid for words, so it seems quite appropriate these stories are told in a comic book style.<br />In addition, the book closes on a scene between Dream and Death, who is pictured as a flamboyant happy-go-lucky Goth girl.  He accompanies her as she collects the souls of the dying and brings an interesting sense of closure to Dream's experience.  The world has changed in his absence and there is much more for him to learn and to explore. <br />This is an essential book in the Neil Gaiman universe.  If anything, it acts as a much needed foreward to the rest of the Sandman graphic novels and sets the stage for our expectations.  But it stands on its own, the story rivaling the works of H.P. Lovecraft and Terry Pratchett.  <br />Happy Reading!
B000002OZY|3.0|Already known for their electrifying live shows and their pention for writing great singles, The Who were definitely on their way to rock superstardom.  The band, with the leadership of guitarist Pete Townshend, decided to push their limits even further with an ambitious double-length conceptual work.  It was a big gamble (double albums always were at that time), but it paid off in the end.  TOMMY, the first ever rock opera and entirely written by Townshend, became the band's breakthrough album and paved the way for others to do conecept albums and expand their creativity.  It's safe to say that if it wasn't for TOMMY, there would be no WALL (Pink Floyd), no OPERATION: MINDCRIME (Queensryche), no SCENES FROM A MEMORY (Dream Theater), or no SNOW (Spock's Beard).  Heck, there would be no QUADROPHENIA (the Who's second rock opera) for that matter.<br />Despite the fact that TOMMY was a groundbreaking achievement in rock music, it's not the great album it should be.  To quote Roger Ebert, &quot;It's all storytelling and no story.&quot;  The plot starts out simple enough, but then goes off the rails into bizarre territory and doesn't make a lot of sense.  There are a few great songs here and there, but not many.  There's a LOT of filler and it can get quite annoying.  Musically, the album is solid; lyrically, it's a mixed bag.<br />Let me try and explain the story for what it's worth.  It focuses on Tommy, of course, who was born before his father could ever see him; the dad died while fighting in World War II.  When he's a little kid, Tommy witnesses his mother do something that causes him to go deaf, dumb, and blind.  We see Tommy go from childhood (where we meet his evil family members) to adulthood as he unexpectedly becomes a modern-day messiah from playing pinball (!).  And that's...pretty much it.  The rest of the story is much too weird to be explained.<br />TOMMY does sport a number of good songs that have to outweigh the filler, and some good production, whichare the main reasons I gave it 3 stars.  The 5-minute &quot;Overture&quot; is a great way to start the album, as it introduces the main themes and combines the band's guitar, bass, and drums with a full orchestra to create a dynamic opener.  The &quot;Amazing Journey/Sparks&quot; medley is another good one, and sounds even better live (check out the live version on LIVE AT LEEDS).  &quot;I'm Free&quot; and &quot;The Acid Queen&quot; are solid hard rockers with great guitar riffs.  &quot;Cousin Kevin&quot; is a wicked song with some cool harmonies that perfectly showcase the nature of Tommy's evil cousin.  The 10-minute instrumental &quot;Underture,&quot; while a bit overlong, showcases the band's chops, especially Keith Moon's explosive drumming.  The 7-minute closer &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot; is a great grand finale and deserves to be on another album instead of this one.<br />That's it for great songs, though.  &quot;Pinball Wizard,&quot; while a classic song, doesn't really do much and makes the story ridiculous, while the short little segues sprinkled throughout aren't very good either.  They take up too much space.  &quot;Tommy's Holiday Camp&quot; is just freaky.  How did it ever make it on the album?<br />Personally, I can't wait to hear the Who's second concept album QUADROPHENIA, since I heard the story is more coherent and the songs are much better.  Overall, TOMMY is an uneven yet creative work that broke barriers, but did little to show for it.  Thankfully, the Who would get better in the '70s.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|ok i love this cd. britney did alot of growing up on this cd. but what i think is that people aren't going to give her alot of props for this album b/c trust me its a lot more racier than her other cd's. in my opinion i think this is her best album. the tracks are off da hook.  i really like \\"OUTRAGEOUS\\" which is my absolute favorite and i also like \\"SHOWDOWN\\" other tracks are really good liek the two songs everyone is talking about \\"BREATHE ON ME\\" and of course the most SEXIEST \\"TOUCH OF MY HAND\\" and since im from the islands reggae is very common to me and \\"THE HOOK UP\\" has this nice regggae beat to it. so all in all this album will please REAL TRUE BRITNEY FANS!!!!!!!!!! GO BRITNEY =:)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I liked Britney before, but this cd has done it's magic to love her, This album really rocks ass, the songs are all great and full of beats, My favorite is all of them!!! Britney has really grown up and sounds even better than before. Songs have this cool mid-eastern, r&amp;b, techno, dance, and raggae sounds. This week only you can get the album for 9.99 at Best buy and Circuit city. Enjoy IT
B0000DJZA5|4.0|i understand why this album was done. but if they were going to  redo it the way it was intended, why didnt they release it as get back with TEDDY BOY & THE WALK in the line up. from what i understand these songs were intended to be on there and cut at the last moment.i love the fact that they included DONT LET ME DOWN, it should have always been on this album. but WHY cut  DIG IT ???? it should have been longer,not axed !!!!!!! anyway ,its still a new beatles album so it gets 4 stars from me,  it just COULD have been REALLY good.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I have been listening to Shania since she first came out. I have all of her CD's and without a doubt Up live in Chicago is the best sounds I have heard from her. She shows a lot of life and spirit in her singing. There is heart felt warmth, love, friendship and just plain good advice in her songs. Shania showed she is a truely great talent all wrapped up in one women. She also shows her love for her singing and her desire to ensure her fans see and hear the best she has. Thanks for putting it all out and giving us all the talent you have in these songs.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I think this cd is pretty cool... I liked the way Britney's music was before, I don't think she needed to change the music much, but I think she did a pretty good job at it anyway. A few tracks I just can't listen to because I think they sound really dumb, but others are fun and enjoyable to listen to.<BR>I don't like when she has other people in her songs, I think they usually end up sounding cheesy (Ie. Madonna, those 2 annoying guys that yell stupid crap in &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, and that annoying guy/girl, I can't tell, in &quot;The Hook Up&quot;).<BR>By all means, however, this cd is a must have for Britney fans. It is a fun listen.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|My One Wish has come True for so long I wanted Whitney to do a Christmas album and for so long I had to listen to other people mess up christmas song but I can now say that Whitney has redemeed Christmas and One Wish is soon to be a classic in everyone Stereo this christmas. Our Diva is back and this time she aint playin her vocals are powerful then ever before.<br />Yall Haters watch because our girl is about to take the music world by storm again and this is just a preview of whats getting ready to come.
B000000WA4|5.0|A truly great album. There is no doubt in my mind of it as one of the great rock albums of the ninety's and all-time. Beautifully construced, hypnotic to the end, and definitally worth the change.

I Feel Like A Woman!<BR>Up!<BR>Honey, I'm Home<BR>She's Not Just A Pretty Face<BR>Forever And For Always<BR>Ka-Ching!<BR>When You Kiss Me<BR>Don't Be Stupid (You Know I Love You)<BR>That Don't Impress Me Much<BR>I'm Gonna Getcha Good!<BR>From This Moment On<BR>No One Needs To Know<BR>Thank You Baby!

B0000DD7LB|1.0|this cd sucks.  i used 2 like britney's music, but every 1 of her cds has gotten worse.  she shouldn't even get credit for singing these songs because it's not her voice.  it's all synthesized crap.  the only thing britney spears has going for her is hype, her looks, and dancing ability.  if u want a pop cd with some substance buy christina aguilera's stripped album.  now that girl can sing!  she writes her own songs too.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Wow. I have just finished watching this near 4 hour epic, and I am just blown away! After enjoying the movie version, it's hard to believe that an extra 42 minutes could make such a big difference, but it does and I absolutely loved every minute!<br />It's hard to imagine how a movie like Lord Of The Rings could be made better. And I haven't even looked at the extras yet!<br />This DVD set puts other DVD &quot;special editions&quot; to shame. If you're hesitant to buy this one, let me assure you, you won't regret it. If you enjoyed The Two Towers at the movies, you'll absolutely love this extended edition, as it really fleshes out the story, as well as providing a few very pleasant surprises.<br />Now stop reading these and go buy it :-)
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah Careys christmas album is by far the best that I have ever bought! I got it back in 1994 when it has been released. Its a classic for me ever since. A customer below wrote it and its true. This CD belongs to a time when Mariah was at the height of her career. She was awesome way back in the early 90! I loved her music so much during that period of time. This christmas album is one of the highlights of her career. She sounds amazing on every song! I can highly recommend everyone to buy this christmas album. If you are looking for something special, get this one! You will not be dissapointed! I even bought it twice!!
B00009L1TA|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, all my friends were saying how good it was. Then i finally got to watch it and found it to be very boring. First off they shouldn't have put so many twists in, it got confusing at times. Then John should't have been in their and made it kinda a love story slash army story romance isnt always needed. Their is nothing i hate more then a hard core army story mixed with love it just doesnt work. Then the end was weak some may say it was good but it was a very weak plot. It was just thrown in to make people happy oh noone died how nice. Well this movie gets a yank yank not worth the time of the day.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitneys One Wish-Holiday Album is the best out there you can get this year. She sounds strong on every song. Ill enjoy listen to this album over and over again. There are no songs to skip. Best is O holy night and One wish. Surely an album that will be a classic every year!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|After listening to this CD, I have to say that Sarah has changed herself in a big way.  Afterglow is a huge shift from the type of music heard on previous albums such as Fumbling Towards Ecstasy and Surfacing.  When I initially heard that Sarah was in the studio, I was blown away.  When I heard Fallen for the first time, I was amazed at how she was still going strong and I expected this album to be a huge success.  For me, Afterglow was one of the most anticipated albums this year.<br />Upon hearing Fallen for the umpteenth time and still loving it, I moved on to other tracks.  And I was confused.  This was not the same Sarah I was accustomed to hearing.  This was a different side of Sarah, more contemplative and thoughtful.  She's taken time to pick her words carefully so that they portray how much she's grown.  With tracks like Fallen, Stupid, Time, and Perfect Girl, Sarah will please newcomers to her music and will surprise even her most devoted fans.
B0000E1ALR|4.0|Yeah, yeah, I know: you can't do total justice to the Boss' catalog in just two or three disks.  And short of a big box set, you'll disappoint virtually every Bruce fan with omissions.  (Me? I'd like to have seen &quot;She's the One&quot;, &quot;My Hometown,&quot; &quot;Cadillac Ranch&quot;, etc.)  Even Boss himself is apologetic of the more obvious omissions in the liner notes.  That said, this is an excellent and generous (77-78 minutes each) 2-disc set and a fine overview of all his studio releases.  The sound is great, remastered-crisp, and the bonus disc is a joy (&quot;Trapped&quot;, a Jimmy Cliff cover that originally appeared on the &quot;We Are the World&quot; album, is the highlight for me).  If you're a diehard fan, you probably have all the songs on Discs 1 and 2 already, but if not, this is a perfect sampler to start with.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I guess the DT boys have decided that they don't like Symphony X watching them in the rear-view mirror. This is their best release to date-their &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;. Finally we have song writing instead of the tecno-jam sessions I am so tired of. This is the music that I have known they could make if so desired-this is incredible-Buy It!
B00005JM02|4.0|&#34;Finding Nemo&#34; is a film from Disney's master of computer animation, Pixar Animation Studio. Like all Pixar films, it was born of pixels, not animation cells, and so has a visual style distinct from conventional animation. The images have much more texture and subtle activity than films made from individually drawn cells. &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; takes us into the ocean, to an  imaginary world of marine life in Australia's reef. We meet Marlin (voice of Albert Brooks), a neurotic overprotective clownfish whose only child, Nemo (voice of Alexander Gould) has been abducted by human divers and taken away on a boat. Impelled by his great love for his son and aided by a hyperactive blue tang fish with a terrible memory named Dory (voice of Ellen DeGeneres), Marlin sets out to find Nemo and bring him home. Marlin and Dory encounter perilous creatures and make many new friends in their tireless journey to Sydney harbor. Meanwhile, Nemo is residing in a dentist's aquarium where he and his fellows captives are plotting an escape of their own.<br /><br />&#34;Finding Nemo&#34;'s animation is beautiful. Writer/director Andrew Stanton and the folks at Pixar made it hard on themselves by setting this film underwater. The ocean and the reef are is constantly in motion, so every bit of the image must be moving. This makes for some gorgeous scenery and gives the eye a lot to take in. The movement of the water provides some of the film's most striking animation. And, as we've come to expect from Pixar, there is a lot of clever but good-natured humor that's fun for kids and adults. At times, I was struck by the tremendous creative talent exhibited on the screen. The only thing I didn't enjoy about this film is the constant chatter. The sea critters talk all the time. Literally. At times I felt that the film should have slowed down and shut up long enough for us to take in its stunning artwork. Marlin and Dory really could give you a headache. The humor in &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; isn't as sophisticated as that of &#34;Monsters, Inc.&#34;. The writing is more Disney-influenced. But &#34;Finding Nemo&#34; is entertaining and its strength is its beauty. Kids and adults will both enjoy this gorgeous film.sophisticated as that of &#34;Monsters, Inc.&#34;.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|Some of the most memorial songs plus the new incredible performance \\"One more chance\\" has turned Number Ones into a number one album ever.<BR>For those who have grown up with Michael Jackson this is a perfect diary which reminds their life process. It is really fabulous to have all these tracks in one CD.<BR>No need to write about tracks because every one have at least heard them for one time except the last masterpiece \\"One more chance\\" which is a prove of a great return and makes fans eager for his exclusive performance \\"Xscape\\".
B000055ZB8|4.0|A real estate agent (Alexander Granach) in the town of Wisborg, Germany receives a letter from a foreign aristocrat, Count Orlok, expressing an interest in purchasing a home in the town. The real estate agent dispatches his clerk, Thomas Hutter (Gustav von Wangenheim) to Transylvania to offer the Count a suitable house. Hutter bids his disappointed young wife farewell and eagerly sets out to make the sale of his career. He reaches Transylvania at the same time a mysterious disease is ravaging the countryside and finds the locals to be inviting but oddly superstitious. He also finds his host, Count Orlok (Max Schreck), to be an imposing and frightening figure. He finally senses that his wife, Ellen (Greta Schroder), may be in grave danger and makes haste to return home. Meanwhile, Count Orlok is also headed for Wisborg, where he plans to  occupy his new home.<br /><br />&#34;Nosferatu&#34; was directed by F.W. Murnau in 1922. It was written by Henrik Galeen and is a loose adaptation of Bram Stoker's classic novel &#34;Dracula&#34;, faithful to the novel's themes but not to its story. The cinematography is by Gunther Kramph. This version of the film's score (Image Entertainment DVD) was composed and performed in 1991by The Silent Orchestra and Timothy Howard, who sought out music by 19th century composers who would have been contemporary to Murnau's youth when creating the score. Like many films of the era, &#34;Nosferatu&#34; was filmed in black and white but then tinted so that the final product is a colored film. Murnau uses no fewer than 5 colors in &#34;Nosferatu&#34;. The colors are especially important in this film since they are used not only to convey mood but also to represent the passage of time: Sepia for daylight or indoor light, blue for night, mauve for dawn and dusk. When we see the color change, we feel time slipping past. Much of the movie was filmed outdoors in bright sunlight, which it seems was too much for the film stock to handle. Highlights in the film are terribly overexposed, which annoyed me almost immediately. Unlike many of his expressionist contemporaries, F.W. Murnau didn't like to shoot indoors in front of sets. His love of nature is commendable, and it distinguished his work, but super-contrasty scenes with no detail in the highlights are the inevitable result. &#34;Nosferatu&#34; is so replete with symbolism that you will have to watch it several times to catch it all. Count Orlok commands attention whenever he is on screen. He is fascinating. But the narrative itself is weak. If you're just watching this movie for the story and its terror-inducing properties, as I did the first time I saw it, I think you will find your attention waning during scenes which don't contain Count Orlok. The film is best viewed as allegory. Seen as Freudian, Christian, pagan, expressionist, romanticist, and/or social allegory, the story develops so many facets and implications that the viewer can't keep up with them all. Taken literally, the narrative seems sloppy and nonsensical in places but is saved by Orlok's strong presence. I recommend numerous viewings, including one with the audio commentary enabled. Intertitles in English only.<br /><br />The DVD (This refers to the Image Entertainment Special Edition DVD only.): Bonus features include an audio commentary by film historian Lokke Heiss, a tour of the film's locations, an essay explaining the phantom carriage ride scene, and a gallery of still photos and drawings with explanations. The audio commentary by Lokke Heiss is excellent. He discusses the romantic and expressionist influences in the film, as well as its structure, symbolism, technique, and allegorical implications. I highly recommend listening to the audio commentary on a second viewing. The tour of locations is also interesting. The condition of the print from which this DVD was made is reasonably good. There are some visual noise and imperfections, but not enough to be distracting.re terribly overexposed, which annoyed me almost immediately. Unlike many of his expressionist contemporaries, F.W.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|This CD is bland, all of the songs are about the same exact thing, lets go clubbing ... no real emotion into it. Britney should start writing because although the writers she has do a very good job, she has very little variety in the songs she does choose. I gave it two stars because when I listened to it, a song actually caught my attention, \\"Toxic\\", and I fell in love with it after awhile. The other star came out of, She actually collaborated! I was expected way more since she \\"took time off to make this one good,\\" but I guess I look at Stripped by Christina Aguilera(One of the best CDs ever by a female artist, in my opinion). I do not disrespect her or dislike her at all, but if she's going to be the next Madonna, she's got to get into Madonna's shoes and reinvent herself.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I love this DVD. The songs are great and the live performances are awesome. Even though it was shot at a pretty big venue, it was still very intimate! Shania can sing very well and I am so glad that she chose to release this concert as a DVD. I am sure that this DVD will sell well and if you have not purchased a copy of it, please do so now. It is well worth it!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album meets and exceeds my expectations from Britney's 4th release. <br />Gone are the sugary-sweet pop songs (Come on, you know you loved 'em!), and in their place are a collection of super-sexy tracks that make you wanna hop onto the dance floor or into your bed (with company, or as \\"Touch of My Hand\\" suggests, by yourself!).<br />I would highly recommend this disc to anyone who wasn't feeling Britney's previous albums. It has a completely different vibe & is much more mature.<br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC - The first single from the album. Rapid fire lyrics & guest appearance by Madonna. Hot! 5/5<br />(I GOT THAT) BOOM BOOM - I could have gone without the Ying Yang Twins blabbing at the beginning of the song, but that aside this song is really awesome & terribly catchy. 5/5<BR>SHOWDOWN - Really fun song...sounds a bit like a jab at a past boyfriend. Not to name any names..*ahem* 5/5<br />BREATHE ON ME - Undoubtedly one of the top songs on the album. Very breathy vocals on this one. Lots of grunting & groaning, too. Fun for the whole family! I hope this is a single...5/5<br />EARLY MORNIN' - Okay, so right as we're starting to get into this amazing album, along comes \\"Early Mornin'\\". Don't get me wrong, this song isn't terrible, but it leaves a lot to be desired. The lyrics are pretty lame, and Britney just sounds bored. I'll pass. 2/5<br />TOXIC - But don't hit the stop button just yet! Sandwiched between two not-so-great songs, Toxic is an excellent example of Britney's new style. Fast-paced & catchy, this song is most likely going to be a single. 5/5<br />OUTRAGEOUS - What on earth is this? I wonder how much R. Kelly got paid to write this. The lyrics are redundant and pointless.<BR>1/5<BR>TOUCH OF MY HAND - This song opens with beautiful eastern-influenced music followed by Britney telling the world how she likes to play with herself. Really pretty song. 5/5<br />THE HOOK UP - Sounds like Shaggy yelling at the opening of the song...Anyway, another fast & fundance track. Kinda hard to describe. 4/5<br />SHADOW - The first ballad of the album. Don't roll your eyes, this song is really powerful. Britney's voice sounds amazing. 5/5<br />BRAVE NEW GIRL - The one ultra-glittery, bubblegum, cartoonish, vocoded-to-perfection pop song on the album. This song comes at just the right time on the album & is just fun as hell! 5/5<br />EVERYTIME - A fantastic way to bring the album to an end (not counting the MATM remix), Everytime is a really emotional & touching song that everyone is saying is about JT. Whatever. It's beautiful. 5/5<br />ME AGAINST THE MUSIC REMIX - This is a fantastic remix of MATM, but after hearing \\"Everytime\\" this song kinda shocks the hell out of you. After a minute of this you're ready to dance all over again! 5/5<br />Overall, this album is a a masterpiece. The songs are original, Britney's vocals have never sounded better, and the music itself is really awesome. And one of my favorite things about this CD is that FINALLY Britney saved the ballads for the END of the album so we can have an uninterrupted jammin' good time with all the more fast-paced songs until the end of the album when it's time to cool off and slow down a bit.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|At first when I heard this album, I wasn't too happy, but once I started listening to it more and more, I began to like it more. I think that the time she took off and made her fans wait for this album was well worth it, cause I think this is her best album yet.
B000003TA4|1.0|I dont like Nirvana<BR>they werent good<BR>Led Zeppelin is better than Nirvana<BR>Pearl Jam is better than Zeppelin<BR>Nobody is better than Pearl Jam<br />Nirvana sucks &amp; will be forgotten cus only teeny boppers like them
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There is now only one reason to own the original Let It Be--to hear how awful it was compared to this one!  The vocals and instruments are crisp.  (Check out the guitar solo in Let It Be.)  Nothing gets lost in the \\"wall of sound\\" anymore.  And then there's \\"The Long And Winding Road.\\"  Finally, Spector's schmaltzy string section is gone.  That one song is reason enough to buy the CD.  (And there are ten more!)  Get Naked!
B000002AZ8|5.0|You may have to listen to this album 3, 5, even 10 times before you really start loving it<br />Theres really no other album like this out there, its so dark &amp; experimental, it forces you to change the way you listen to music the second you hear it
0316776963|5.0|Interestingly, this is the most serious funny book I've ever read. It will make you laugh out loud, no matter where you are, it made me cry (I never cry) and it sweetly describes everything that is lovely and depressing about the world we live in.<br />What I also found is that this book fairly speaks about the true nature of France and the French.  It speaks honestly to the dilemmas Americans face when dealing with the French, without resorting to stereotypes and doting, blind admiration.<br />But make no mistake- this is not a book about international relations, gay issues, greek heritage or the trials of being poor in New York.  It is a book about a life, played out and described in simple, self-deprecating prose, by a man who is halfway through and still learning to talk pretty.
B000003TAR|1.0|I gave this 1 star because ive only heard 1 song off the album<br />I didnt hear the song that well, it was blasting in a furnace<br />Running into telephone polls<br />This album just isnt very good, ive only heard 1 song off the album though, but if i may quote some lyrics<br />&quot;Hay! What?!<BR>Ive got a rude compliment<BR>Only looking out of my heart shaped box!&quot;<br />THose lyrics Cobain wrote arent very good, someone needs to tell this guy to get his head together
0440180295|3.0|I have never read anything by Kurt Vonnegut before and thought I should read this book.  I cannot say that I found this book to be \\"enrapturing\\" or \\"dull.\\"  It sort of fell in the middle.  So it goes.  Vonnegut's writing style is light and quick-paced, which helped me finish it very quickly and he had very unusual subplots going on all the time.  I like the aspect of time and the lack of chronology in the book.  As muddled as the timeline is, I can't say I found it confusing.  <br />I would have to say that Catch 22 in many ways was better.  I compare it to Catch 22 because both are about WWII and both are satirical in nature, being anti-war books.  I didn't especially like Catch 22, but the sense of an underlying theme was stronger than in this book.  All Vonnegut was trying to do in this book (as I see it) was to make people see the ridiculousness of war and do so by treating it lightly.  He makes many things that are important (like death) more trivial.  So it goes.  I don't mind this, but it got boring after a while.  I like light books that aren't overly dense about things this touchy, but because of it I can't call this book a masterpiece.  It is hard for me to take a book too seriously that doesn't take its subject matter that seriously.<br />Interesting read, though.  So it goes.
B000002BYD|5.0|'Yield' is incredibly awesome , emotional, &amp; one of Pearl Jam's more fun albums<br />Also one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the 90s, if they made more music videos for this album besides just 'Do the Evolution', it couldve sold 10 million
B0000DD7LB|2.0|I love Britney but this is her worst CD in my opinion.   I was really disappointed.
B000002IWQ|4.0|This album is a little &quot;cold&quot; for Rush...not that they are known for their warmth! But it feels just a bit more slick that usual. So a little bit of a barrier is set up between the listener and the band.  But give it a second listen, like I did, rather than dismiss it.  I'm a HUGE Rush fan, but this one took me longer than any other album to warm up to...but now I'm a big fan.  Almost all the tracks are stellar, but there are three I'd like to highly recommend:<br />1) ANIMATE, the opening track, is almost three songs in one. The opening riff is catchy, but the least interesting. Later in the song, when the tempo goes upbeat, this thing really starts rocking!  Lyrically, it's interesting too...Peart makes some interesting comments about the need for our &quot;manly&quot; side to be balanced by more &quot;feminine&quot; aspects, either internal or external.  Peart is always exploring the idea of balance, between heart and mind, usually, so this is a departure of sorts.<br />2) STICK IT OUT  Kinda in the vein of FACE UP (my favorite from ROLL THE BONES), it's the closest that Rush does anymore to a kind of anthem...a crowd sing-a-long, if you will.  It jams!<br />3) BETWEEN SUN &amp; MOON.  The song rocks pretty hard, with a clear, crisp guitar riff, more &quot;shiny&quot; than usual for these guys. But the song has a real beauty behind it as well. They performed it during some of their shows on the recent VAPOR TRAILS tour, and even though it was one of their lesser-known songs on the set list, I found it one of the high-points of the show for me.<br />The low point of the album is NOBODY'S HERO.  I appreciate the sentiment, particularly as Peart, through the voice of Geddy Lee, expresses the pain at his loss of a friend due to AIDS. It's nice that the guys feel politically correct, but the lyrics fit VERY awkwardly with the music, and frankly, I just skip this track most of the time.  Everyone can misfire once in awhile and be forgiven.<br />The musicianship is, as always, stellar. Alex Lifeson's guitar is more front and center here than in the last few albums, and the keyboards are starting to recede into the background...a foreshadowing of their disappearance on VAPOR TRAILS.  For the most part, the lyrics are very direct, and Rush fans won't be disappointed.  The album got virtually no radio-play, and didn't sell as well as others...which is a shame. I think it is worth a second look.  Not the album to introduce someone to Rush, but for fans, it really deserves a place of honor.
B0000296SI|5.0|What the hell is wrong with you ppl? this album is definatley one of the greatest albums of the 90's!!how can you say that Nevermind is one of the greatest albums ever when you just crap all over Enema? nirvana was just as mainstream as blink 182 is if not more! this cd has really great songs and the drums are great. tom and mark do rad jobs on the guitar and bass and vocals! this is a great cd..so stop bad mouthing it. you guys rock luv ya 4ever!
B000001FI7|5.0|Listening to Dummy while driving up a dark canyon at night in winter was probably the best place to first listen to Portishead.  It's creepy to me, that's for sure.  It's not something that i listen to to feel safe.  It's not comfort music.  But it's amazing in it's own right.  People of all different music tastes should love this.  If you don't, oh well.  You're missing out on a great piece of music.
B00003CXD5|5.0|John Huston's The Treasure of the Sierra Madre is my second favorite film of all-time. The first being Tod Browning's Freaks from 1932. This is Humphrey Bogart at his best. It is fascinating to see Bogart as Fred C. Dobbs break down. This film showcases greed and paranoia like none other. Walter Huston is also very good as Howard, an old prospector that knows what gold can do to a mans heart. Many films have been influenced by Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Among them - Henri-Georges Clouzot's Wages of Fear, Sam Peckinpah's Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, and Brian DePalma's Scarface. Look out from cameos from Robert Blake, Ann Sheridan, and Jack Holt. The DVD has some terrific extra features as well. There is a 2-hour documentary on director John Huston, a 1-hour documentary on the film, a Bogart trailer gallery, Lux Radio Theatre Broadcast of Treasure of the Sierra Madre, 8-Ball Bunny - a Looney Toons cartoon, and lots more. Just watch it, folks.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|As a long time fan of Pearl Jam it is great to finally get the long rumored compilation of B-sides and rarities. &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; (30 tracks plus 1 hidden; 113 min.) is a redemption after last year's uneven and ultimate disappointing &quot;Riot Act&quot; album. I say this because &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; feels like another &quot;proper&quot; album, more so than a compilation.<br />CD1 (14 tracks; 53 min.) starts off with one of the strongest tracks, the heavy &quot;All Night&quot;, from the &quot;No Code&quot; sessions (it still remains my favorite PJ album). &quot;Sad&quot; and &quot;Down&quot; are almost as powerful, very good. Other highlights include &quot;Black, Red, Yellow&quot; (also from the &quot;No Code&quot; sessions), &quot;U&quot;, and of course &quot;Yellow Bedletter&quot; the concert fave which finally gets released on album.<br />CD2 (16 tracks plus 1 hidden; 58 min.) generally speaking finds a more laid-back, accoustic Pearl Jam at work. Again the highlights are many: &quot;Fatal&quot; (from the &quot;Binaural&quot; sessions), &quot;Footsteps&quot; (from the &quot;Ten&quot; sessions) and not the least several of the Christmas songs released previously as fan club singles: &quot;Strangest Vibe&quot;, &quot;Drifting&quot; and &quot;Let Me Sleep&quot; almost feel like the band jamming in your home room, just great. The hidden track (about 5 min. after &quot;Bee Girl&quot; ends) is &quot;4/20/02&quot;, Ed solo, lamenting the death of Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley that very day, hauntingly beautiful.<br />In all, this is of course an essential album for any Pearl Jam fan, but I venture to say it's also very accesible to the casual fan, simply because of the strenght of the songs and the smart sequencing of the tracks. In the excellent liner notes, the band says there's lots more tracks like these in the vaults. Here's hoping &quot;Lost Dogs 2&quot; will see the daylight!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This remix is cleaner, clearer, more cohesive, and has a much more consistent overall sound than the original.  It sounds much more like an album - the songs now fit together as part of a package, rather than disjointed pieces pasted together.  Ironically, this new remix reveals just how far Phil Spector had descended into the production \\"crap\\" that John Lennon had told George Martin he wanted no part of.  Listening to \\"Naked\\", one can now see just how much of that \\"crap\\" Spector had crammed into the original album, and why Paul McCartney hated it so.  The original album version was as erratic and uneven as the band itself appeared to be, in the contentious first half of the \\"Let It Be\\" movie.  With tracks that veered from snippets of raw demos to lushly overproduced hymns, Spector had made a hobo stew out of mismatched leftover scraps, mixed with complete, well-crafted songs, and topped off with heavy doses of sugar-coating that turned rock classics into what John called \\"ice cream.\\"  It is now apparent how schizophrenic and haphazard that original version was, because this new version - especially with the re-ordering of the track list - unifies the album in a way that now seems entirely natural and obvious.  Longtime fans will find themselves saying \\"ah, of COURSE, this is the way it was MEANT to sound!\\"  The Spector version had always carried his baggage, and seemed out of sorts and inconsistent.  Now the album truly represents the Beatles \\"as nature intended\\", and provides the missing link in their musical and creative development.  Not their best album, nor truly even their last (Abbey Road retains both of those honors) \\"Let It Be - Naked\\" is nonetheless a gem, and is what the original album should have been - the bridge over troubled waters that connected the White Album to Abbey Road.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This album is quite different than her last two. I'm still deciding whether I like it or not. I'd probably say that I liked her 'britney' album over this one. The beats are interesting, but at times she's drowned out by the music or her backup singers. It is much racier, lyric-wise, but still tasteful, I'd say. Although the songs are fun, they're much harder to 'sing along with' than her last couple of albums. There's just not as much singing!!! My favorite song on the album is &quot;Breathe on Me.&quot; And of course, being a huge madonna fan, I love &quot;Me against the music,&quot; but it doesn't need a re-mix on the album. I think I gotta let this album grow on me for a while.
0812548094|1.0|Is this only the second book in the series?  Feels like it was written 1000 times before, only better, and by better writers.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Normally I'm a fan of Spector but never liked what he had done to LIB. I had heard bootlegs of what Glyn Johns had originally mixed for release. This blows it all away. Check out I ME MINE. It's startling how much better the separation of voices and instruments are. The bonus disc of Fly On The Wall also has snippets of unreleased Beatles songs and conversation. Do Not Hesitate!! This is the real deal.
B0000C0FJB|1.0|I think 2 things are more important to this record than any other things mentioned before:<br />What you hear is three guys having fun and feeling the atmosphere. From this point of view it's true. Rish in Rio sounds a bit like ALL THE WORLD'sS A STAGE. The sound isn't bright. The vocals are behind the guitar, the drums are missing a bit on the toip end.But: When I heard different stages for the first time, I thought: Hell: I would have liked to be there (no dates in europe...). But when I heard this one, I thought: They sound like they are 25 again. May all the rock icons with dyed hair,bear-bellies and whatever grab a copy of &quot;Rush in Rio&quot; and decide that it's time to quit. 26 years after &quot;All The World's A Stage Rush sound like they still haven't lost the fun in playing!<br />The audience is too loud? The sound is too dull? Oh boy! Listen!<br />They (Rush) show everybody what it means to be a live band and to play.<br />By the way:<br />I still would like to hear them in a show with 300 people. I think they showed us (with an audience of 40000 people!!) that they' re still able to play a show for the fans no matter how big the audience is.<br />And if that's the last record os Rush... well you should leave when it's time and when you're on the top of what you can do!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This has to be by far the best cd that Britney has released. Alot of the songs are very tasteful and they show how much Britney has matured. My favorite song on this album is a ballad called Everytime. The song is very personal and the lyrics are great! The one song on the cd that I'm not crazy about it called (I got that)Boom Boom. The Ying Yang twins make the song a somewhat obnoxious. Besides that song, the album is really good. Buy this album!!! You won't be disappointed!!
068817776X|5.0|This book is an amazing, true story about a courageous lady! I couldn't put the book down once I started reading!
B000002BQK|5.0|This is Mariah Carey's best album in my opinion. It is her most personal and well rounded album. Who could resist the first single and opening track, &quot;Honey&quot;? It has an infectuous groove and great vocals from Mariah, another #1 hit for her. This album came on the heels of her divorce from Tommy Mottola, so it's very personal and goes deep into matters of the heart. &quot;My All&quot; was another #1, a great emotional ballad. My favorite is the title track, I don't think she's ever written a song more beautiful than this one, and shows an impressive vocal as she transcends over each note, from high to low, almost effortlessly. &quot;The Roof&quot; is a great ballad, with a unique feel to it. &quot;Fourth of July&quot; is a really nice love song, so is &quot;Whenever You Call&quot;. I actually prefer this version over the duet version with Brian McKnight, it's another beautiful song with a great vocal. &quot;Outside&quot; and &quot;Close My Eyes&quot; are very personal, and very relatable. &quot;Breakdown&quot; and &quot;Babydoll&quot; are nice R&amp;B numbers, and she does a nice cover of Prince's &quot;The Beautiful Ones&quot;. Overall this is her best album in my opinion, I don't think she'll ever top it.
B000002IFP|5.0|This may sound totally pedestrian and vapid on my part, but the remake of &quot;If You Don't Know Me By Now&quot; is actually better than the original! Please forgive me Blue Notes, but Mick Hucknall and Company manage to update this 70's soul classic with the perfect amount of polish, elegance and soul. The choruses have a yearning, slow burning, gospel feel that makes the love song sound like a spiritual reaffirmation. The rest of this 1989 release shouldn't be neglected either, but &quot;If You Don't....&quot; is the crown jewel here, a remake that actually works and improves on the original. The guys are terrific!
B00000DFRS|5.0|This was Whitney Houston's first album in 8 years. She did a lot of movie and soundtrack work in the 90s, most notably THE BODYGUARD, but this was her official follow up to 1990s IM YOUR BABY TONIGHT. I believe this is her strongest effort to date. There isn't a weak track in the bunch. Whitney worked with a lot of contemporary producers at the time, like Missy Elliott, Wyclef Jean, Lauryn Hill, Rodney Jerkins, and more. The album opens with the anthem &quot;It's Not Right But It's Ok&quot;. The album version is good, but the remix is even better. &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot; is a showstopping performance by Whitney, Faith Evans and Kelly Price. The title track is the song that Wyclef Jean produced. &quot;When You Believe&quot; is a nice duet with Mariah Carey, they compliment each other well. These 4 songs were singles from the album in the US, and the Diane Warren penned &quot;I Learned From The Best&quot; was also a single. I like the Missy produced tracks, &quot;In My Business&quot; and &quot;Oh Yes&quot;, the latter being a perfect piece of soul. There's some good uptempo R&amp;B on songs like &quot;If I Told You That&quot;, &quot;I Bow Out&quot; and &quot;Get it Back&quot;. She collaborates with Lauryn Hill on the hidden track &quot;I Was Made To Love Him&quot;, which is nice. One of my favorites is the inspiring ballad &quot;You'll Never Stand Alone&quot;. Overall this is a top grade effort from Mrs. Bobby Brown, worth repeated listens.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This sequel really threw me for a proverbial loop.  I was going into it expecting Bill, Ted; you know maybe a cameo by Napoleon...  When I saw Keanu I figured, &quot;Alright, so he's goth now, that's cool.&quot;  Then out popped his NEW friend Trinity, and apparently this Morpheus character took over for Ruffius (Did the actor who played ruffius die?).  Anyway, I did like the substitution of the &quot;Hovership&quot; for the phone booth, a little more time-travel realism (After all, I've been in phone booths, and I've never time-traveled).  And that first Bill and Ted movie must have made some !CASH! because they pumped this new one full of special effects!  All in all, I liked it, but I think that they could have done a better job of connecting the plots of the 2 movies.
0446530891|1.0|Split Second is by far David Baldacci's worst book. When he is right on, he is one of the best. But this book is so full of trite, overwrought dialogue and cheesy situations, that I almost couldn't pick it up. This book reads like a contract filler--he had to write a book, didn't care about anything but the money, and cranked out a tepid, hackneyed piece of tripe.<br />Believe it or not, I am a Baldacci fan when he is focused. His &quot;Wish You Well&quot; is a beautifully crafted bit of heartfelt fiction. The writing is clean and precise, and the dialogue flows beautifully. Split Second is not. It reads like a second- rate first attempt by a mediocre writer. It is sorely disappointing. <br />My only hope is that he has made enough money from the sales of this turkey that he can spend the time to write to the level he has already demonstrated that he can achieve.
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I eagerly bought this cd, thinking 'it's about time', but I was sorely disappointed.  I will admit that I was a big fan back in the 80's, but my enthusiasm had waned, despite any drama and/or bad publicity in her life, I think she is an exceptional singer and was really excited to hear her Christmas cd.  I was, however, shocked and saddened by her voice - oh my god - what has happened to that beautiful instrument?  Make no mistake, she still can sing, but it doesn't even sound like the old Whitney, in fact, if I hadn't known it was her, I would have been hard pressed to tell it was.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|When I saw the original Matrix, I was not impressed. I never even bothered to see the Mmatrix Reloaded until recently. I was missing out.<br />The Matrix Trilogy has a wonderful storyline, and Reloaded is the most important of them. While the original sets up the storyline and the finale is all about the war and Neos battle with Smith, Reloaded answers a lot of questions and creates even more. I mean, the Wachowski brothers did make some good plot twists.<br />Each character seems unique, and every one is there to serve a purpose. I feel like the Keymaker could of been more developed, and his role should of been much more important. The Merovingian and his wife Persephone are examples of new characters that are fantastic.<br />I do not really care about special effects, but these were grand. The freeway chase was visually pleasing, especially sequences with the Twins. Also, Neos fight with the 100 Smiths was fun to watch. I love the song they play.<br />The DVD has some fairly good extras, if you are into documentaries on how the film is made. It also talks about the Animatrix, the Enter the Matrix video game, and includes the MTV Movie Awards parody of the Matrix Reloaded.
B000063CMK|5.0|My path to Pain Of Salvation has been a long one. I first saw the band name on a music community on Livejournal. I wrote it down. Nearly half a year later I found it again and out of idle curiosity found some of the songs off of 'The Perfect Element.' They were good; though at the time I thought they were nothing stellar.<br />But since two of the songs, 'Morning On Earth' and 'Ashes' began to catch my interest, I kept Pain Of Salvation in the back of my mind. After wending through Opeth and Symphony X and Dream Theater, I arrived at my Remedy. I really love this album; I've only had it a few days and it has been played pretty much constantly.<br />I admit: I do not understand the full concept of the album. I'm beginning to grasp at some of the intent, but it is convoluted. Probably not as complicated as Dream Theater's 'Scenes From A Memory,' but every bit as memorable.<br />The songs range from sweet to marring. Songs like the oft-mentioned 'Rope Ends' and 'A Trace Of Blood' deserve their accolades. Both are indeed wrenching, even if you've never had similar experiences. On 'Rope Ends' in particular, the production for the vocals is superb (I still wonder what Porcupine Tree producer Steven Wilson would have done, though); layered and lush in the chorus. 'Ending Theme' reminds me of Opeth's 'The Drapery Falls' with beautifully textured guitars in the opening and a stunning chorus. 'This Heart Of Mine (I Pledge),' despite the cheesy title, is like a brief zephyr through the Lane of arching trees. 'Dryad Of The Woods,' an instrumental, is nearly five minutes. A lot for an instrumental, but it is far, far too short.<br />There are great guitar solos through here, folded seamlessly into the surrounding song, and the vocals...the vocals. Some have found them annoying - I think they're superb. 'Fandango' has some odd vocal sections, which can be a bit off-putting, but they all resolve eventually into a rewarding melodic line.<br />This band reinforces my view that the best bands come from Sweden (and Finland, I mustn't forget them!). I hope more good music comes from them, but I don't think there'll be a problem with that.

B000002MG1|5.0|This is the most groundbreaking R.E.M. album ever, which is a hard feat to surpass,since nearly every record they have ever put out merits tremednous praise(with the blunt exception of &quot;Reveal&quot;...too half baked and unsure in its experimental Brian Wilson oddities)but this certainly takes the cake. It's a beautiful music that is like rapture to the soul. Listen to the thrill of &quot;The Sidewinder sleeps tonite&quot; and you'll feel the regal effects of a band who can make you leap with their musical execution. &quot;Drive&quot;, the opener, sets a moody pace and is unlike most of the album(except for &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot;). &quot;Everbody Hurts&quot; is an eternal anthem that could very well be the most important song/statement of all time! If you think I'm kidding, you should check it out for yourself. Also of glorious note, are the two tracks that end this beautiful record: &quot;Nightswimming&quot; and &quot;Follow the River&quot;. They ache with beauty in such a bittersweet way, it brings tears to your eyes(and you'll cry alot through this record.) This isn't just art; it's a transcdential experience of art over commerce, of purpose over inertia. This is the reason why R.E.M. have consitantly endured. They have made tremendous music. This disc is their best! Also, check these out(in order of greatness):<BR>1. Automatic for the people<BR>2. Murmur<BR>3. Document<BR>4. Reckoning<BR>5. Out of time<BR>6. New adventures in Hi-Fi<BR>7.

The thinking man's music with a heck of a lot of heart to spare!
B0000TB03W|4.0|The DVD is awsome even though its live the sound is great all her songs are really up beat and positive.  Its a lot of fun to listen to and its well worth it.
B00004T9UF|1.0|How do the folks at Interscope sleep at night?
B0000CFW87|5.0|It was absolutely terrific!  I could listen to Josh all day.  The foreign language pronunciation is superb!
B000001Y2U|1.0|Here's the plan: Let's find some freakish fiend who can out quote nietze with sensless overwraught drivel, and let him be Trent Reznor's puppet to create a hate infused musical retread of Alice Cooper and Black Sabbath, minus any semblance of humor, actual skill, talent or erstwhile artistic commodity. Mission accomplished! Here's yer &quot;Antichrist Superstar&quot;!!!
B000002KKD|4.0|The B-52's added a welcome shot of humour to the post-punk scene from 1979 onwards. Not only did they look kitchy and weird in an over-the-top 1960s type of way, their sound was something quite distinctive and they wrote great songs.<br />It's still hard to define the music which is a fun blend of pop, quirky funk and experimental rock. In addition to the jerky arrangements, the innovative vocals are what made the mix so successful and distinctive. The male voice hovers between a singing and speaking style while the female vocals frame it with tight, urgent harmonies and shrieks. The closest comparison I can find of a similar band from the same era is The Flying Lizards, but they were much more obscure.<br />My favourite songs include the jerky Rock Lobster with its great hooks, the tuneful Planet Claire and the infectious Dance This Mess Around. Many of the tracks are good for the dancefloor too. Although not all the songs are up to the quality of the aforementioned hits, they're all innovative, funny and listenable. After all these years, this album still sounds unique.
B000003TAW|5.0|Yep. This IS one of the best rock records of the nineties, and for that matter,of all time. It's arguably their best, but it's so hartd to choose among evry album they've ever put out since all are so dynamic and spectatular in their own right. This is probably considered to be more of a commercial endeavor( as it helped them land at Geffen) but it whips the tar out of a lot of other supposed slacker bands of the 90's and beyond(Blink 182? Uh!)There are no weak tracks. This album helped me discover Weezer and it was actually something that my mom and I listened together when I first got it(at a second hand shop, mind you). She loved it too, so there's crossover appeal into even the baby boomer generation(unlike alot of the tepid acts like Blink 182 that, frankly, suck). Not too many artists can write like Rivers. His melodies are flawless and their signature sound and vibe can appeal to all of us band geeks and nerds. I think the most touching song is the last song, \\"Only in Dreams\\". The last creshendo chorus really touches me and it will you too. It's sort of sad, because sometimes the best things we hope for seem like a dream away and out of reach, but hey, that's life, and just be thankful we have a brilliant band like Weezer who can exemplify what alot of us feel or have felt. It's an emotional record. \\"Say it ain't so\\" is about River's father who abandoned him(I can relate) and \\"The World has turned and left me here\\" describes the true viewpoint of a misguided youth(Like Will Hunting or something). Also, \\"In the Garage\\" kicks major butt and I love when Rivers sings about his so called \\"stupid songs\\" because that's what my father calls mine.But, just like Rivers, I love every one! Listen to this record and you'll be on your first musical diet of the rich Weezer buffet! Cheers!
0385504209|2.0|The plot is really tiresome. Very disappointed.
B000006NPY|4.0|This album hold up well. Forget all the mumbo-jumbo namby-pamby cynics who complain that this is tepid and &quot;soft&quot; and completely caused S.P. to lose a chunk of their fanbase.Billy has ALWAYS been writing songs like these!!! On every Pumpkin's album, there are traces and hints of &quot;Adore&quot;. So, forget the jaded opinions you may have heard. This record is beautiful and ambient. &quot;To Sheila&quot; is a stellar acoustic number and opens up the album well. &quot;Ava Adore&quot; is better then most techno acts out there, yet it's still really a rock song! &quot;Perfect&quot; is a good song. &quot;Daphne Descends&quot; holds a very ambient mood unlike anything Billy has recorded before. &quot;Once upon a time&quot; is a call back to &quot;Galopogos&quot; or &quot;Hummer&quot; in that it captivates the ears with beautiful and simple melodic sensibility. &quot;Tear&quot; is a VERY powerful and tragic song that hurts to hear. It's a bit sad(and based on a true incident). &quot;Crestfallen&quot; is a gem of a beautful bittersweet song. My favorite on the album! &quot;Appels + Oranjes&quot; is a nice hybrid of electronica and beats and it is, admittedly, unlike anything S.P. has done before. &quot;Pug&quot; is like a less intense version of &quot;Ava Adore&quot;. &quot;The tale of Dusty and Pistol Pete&quot; is, plain and simple, a beautiul song that sounds in touch with the vibe of Pisces Iscariot(think &quot;Whir&quot; or &quot;Obscured&quot;). &quot;Annie-Dog&quot; bites, however. Sorry Billy. A pointless inclusion. &quot;Shame&quot; is o.k., very moody and trance inducing, but really just a 6 minute + meditation on a simple melody. &quot;Behold! The Night Mare&quot; is a stellar song, just a bit long. &quot;For Martha&quot; is the records best track!!! Think &quot;Thru the eyes of Ruby&quot; or &quot;Silver%#@$&quot; in terms of epic grandeur, and then just acousticify it! &quot;Blank Page&quot; is very beautiful and it ends the record well. &quot;17&quot; is a snippet of a song called &quot;Blissed and Gone&quot; , but it still pinpoints a very important meaning(see liner notes). All in all, a great album. Can SEEM sluggish, but listen to it under the stars holding the hand of the one you love, and you'll get the point of it. My third favorite S.P. album. Go get it now!!!
B0000DJE9R|5.0|First off, like Elvis did with his #1's cd, &quot;Number Ones&quot; is a compliation of MJ's #1 hits in both the UK and the US. The songs featured here that did not hit #1 in the US did so in England where he is still a HUGE star.<br />Unlike his recent HIStory Greatest Hits Vol. 1 package, these songs are the versions as they were released as singles, some slightly edited. All in all, it is a great collection that includes the great &quot;Smooth Criminal&quot; and &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; not included on the previous collection.<br />My only disappointment is that we were given an unecessary live version of &quot;Ben&quot; instead of another new song. I like &quot;One More Chance&quot; as it brings us back to the older, less harsh and more pop Michael Jackson. <br />Even if you already have all his CD's this is still a worthy CD to add to your collection.
B000069AUI|5.0|I cried when I listened to this album. Not only is it better in scope and beauty then anything Radiohead have put out, post-OK COMPUTER, it actually cements Coldplay not only as the NEW Radiohead, but a far better one, with their own style and musical chops to spare. This is one of the best rock albums...EVER. I highly recommend it, although I know most of you already own it. Stand-out cuts include: &quot;Clocks&quot;, &quot;The Scientist&quot;, &quot;Politik&quot;, and &quot;In My Place&quot;. I've long yearned for Radiohead to quit fiddling around with their toilet-bowl worthy endeavors like &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and get back to music that has passion, purpose and heart. Coldplay exceeds these excpectations and righly own the throne and mantle , much like U2 eventually did after &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;. These songs are aching with purpose and beauty. Wonderful stuff! And this is their SOPHMORE record! Very impressive and dazzling. One of my favorite records ever...it breathes and aches with enchanted beauty, like the colors of a rainbow. Politically, as in the case of U2 , it brings to light some worldly concerns, and that, also, is to be highly commended. Buy it here at Amazon. NOW!
B000002KZ6|5.0|I remember the first time I ever heard this disc (actually LP)was in Northern Lights Music Store in Minneapolis shortly after it was released.  Burning Down the House came on massively loud and frankly I was stunned.  I had never heard anything so quasi-funky/rocky sort of thing in my life.  I thought.....who are these guys?  Needless to say I wasn't listening to the Heads much then, but this album changed all that and a whole lot more.  From this I discovered their older stuff and have really enjoyed them ever since that mind altering day in Minneapolis.  <br />Anyway, in my opinion the best of the disc, and because of these tracks the reason you should buy it:<br />1. Girlfriend is Better<BR>2. Making Flippy Flop<BR>3. Naive Melody (Absolutely beautiful)<BR>4. Pull Up the Roots<BR>5. Burning Down the House<br />Talking Heads: 77, Little Creatures and Stop Making Sense are all superb in their own right, but it all started right here for me and I'm really glad I was in that store that day.
B000000WA4|4.0|I'd give it 5 stars, but the production isn't as taut or as grand as Butch Vigs and there are some filler tracks here. Anyway, this is still one of my personal favorites, and it is certainly worth owning, no matter what taste of style you are into. Flood produced this record with Billy Corgan and there are certain elements of Flood's work with Erasure (on songs like &quot;Love&quot; and &quot;1979&quot;) as well as some U2 like moments (&quot;In the arms of sleep&quot; AND &quot;Thirty-Three). If I could spilt the disc into one solid 5 star record, the tracklisting would go as follows. Ready? Get out your pens, music lovers:<BR>1. Tonight, Tonight<BR>2. Zero<BR>3. Here is no why<BR>4. Bullet with Butterfly Wings<BR>5. To Forgive<BR>6. An ode to no one<BR>7. Galopogos<BR>8. Muzzle<BR>9. Where Boys fear to tread<BR>10. Bodies<BR>11. In the arms of sleep<BR>12. 1979<BR>13. Thru the eys of Ruby<BR>14. Stumbeline<BR>15. X.Y.U.<BR>16. Thirty-Three<BR>I think that &quot;Porcelina of the vast oceans&quot; is a great epic crooner, and I like every song on here, but for sheer brilliance and compact cinergi, I'd have narrowed it down a bit. By the way, &quot;Thru the eyes of Ruby&quot; is one of the best S.P. songs of all time, and it is certainly one of the best rock songs, period(even though it was never released as a single). Anyway, I am still glad that Billy made this record the way he did. &quot;Siamese Dream&quot; is their best effort, but this is certanily their undisputed epic masterpeice...just wish it had been slimmed down a bit!
B0000DJZ7W|5.0|This album is nothing short of spectacular.  Musically, this is one of the best albums I have ever purchased.  I was very skeptical of purchasing this CD, because I don't speak French.  Don't let that deter you.   You will be pleasantly surprised at how easy the music is to listen to (yes, even without knowing the language).  I haven't taken this CD out of my player yet, and don't intend to.  It is artistically her best album to date.  Great music knows no language, and this is great music.
B000001Y5X|1.0|If I melt dry ice, can I swim without getting wet? That is more thought provoking then the entirety of this hate addled piece of trash..instead you should look into Zao, sold here at Amazon.
B0000E1WKE|1.0|It seems the once powerful and classy woman we know as Whitney Houston has fallen even further.  This album needed a different producer.   Her voice sounds terrible on almost every song.  I don't know if she will ever regain her &quot;edge&quot;.   Her career needs help, and this album is not going to help.  I hope she tries again because she has so much potential.
B000007NYS|5.0|Unlike most of the gushing reviewers, although I've been a fan of Lucinda's for a decade or so, I feel ambivalent about a lot of her music. I discovered her on an Austin City Limits episode about the time \\"Sweet Old World\\" came out, and my first reaction was to laugh out loud. I don't care how many \\"not helpfuls\\" you give the reviews that say she can't sing, or how many reviews say she has an amazing voice: I honestly thought I'd tuned into a Saturday Night Live sketch and that her performance was a joke. That voice seemed so awful to me at first. Same for lyrics that seemed repetitive and without substance. The utter lack of charisma may have been what sent me over the edge - she may have more stage presence these days, but on television back then she put the \\"dead\\" in deadpan. When I saw her perform live in the mid-90's (I really do love her, honest!), she was still underwhelming in terms of stage presence except when she got into old blues songs or a long version of \\"Hot Blood\\".<br />So I think it's only fair to warn a newcomer that this may be a voice they love to hate. I love Patti Smith and Bob Dylan and Neil Young and PJ Harvey, but let's face it - they grate on a lot of people's nerves, and Lucinda's voice does the same. Heck, I'm a fan, and I own all her CD's, but if I'm not in just the right mood she grates on mine. Thus, I disagree with those who think the cover versions are inferior - I'd often prefer Mary Chapin Carpenter doing \\"Passionate Kisses\\". For all I know Lucinda might too. In my youth, I once told Don Schlitz it was too bad some country artist had ruined one of the songs I loved hearing him perform. He looked at me like I was crazy and told me he loved the record. Maybe I didn't like commercial country music, but just because we sometimes think it's best hearing the songwriter's own interpretation doesn't make it true. Often another person interprets a song better and makes it their own. Or at least, in the case of Lucinda covers, sings in whatwould conventionally be considered a much better voice.<br />Later I saw her on TV again, and she began to grow on me until eventually I came to enjoy a quirky voice and lyrics that are poetic. I wouldn't be here writing about her if I hadn't come around, I'm just saying it's good to have some reviews here that are helpful to non-fans, and to acknowledge her weaknesses as well as her strenghts. The woman can use words; it just took me a while to get used to someone saying so much with so few of them. And when I'm in the mood to enjoy her voice, it's a joy to just sink into such luxurious lyrics. So - that's the stuff for people who don't know Lucinda at all. On to the comparisons.<br />Like others below, I only have the original CD and can't comment on the bonus tracks except to say that \\"Sweet Old World\\" truly is a great song and that I wouldn't mind having an extra version. \\"Sweet Old World\\" was the first Lucinda CD I ever bought, and my favorite until \\"Car Wheels\\". This one was always last on my list, though \\"Essence\\" made me think twice. Going back today and listening after spending a good deal of time with \\"World Without Tears\\", I realize how great the original \\"Lucinda Williams\\" was, though, and how much it foreshadowed her future music. The production isn't as sophisticated as on \\"Car Wheels\\" (probably still the best entry point for someone new to her music, as well as the most likely one) or the recordings following it, but the songwriting is so remarkably consistently good.<br />It's funny how things change with time, too. Most of the songs I considered amazing classics seemed less so today, while others I'd glossed over in the past, like the sublime \\"Side of the Road\\", stood out. There just isn't a bad song here. What struck me most was how much this recording foreshadowed her future songwriting. The way \\"I Just Wanted to See You So Bad\\" expresses so much passion with so few words, no matter how repetitive or how unusual a voice. And the sheer poetry here- if \\"Side of the Road\\" stands out in terms of its imagery, it isn't alone in using words better than most songwriters can dream of. I also just noticed the gritty sensuality in \\"The Night's Too Long\\" that came back back later on \\"Car Wheels\\" with \\"Right in Time\\", or \\"Essence\\", or \\"Righteously\\" on \\"World Without Tears\\".<br />This is my longwinded way of being the 58th person to say this is essential classic wonderful Lucinda, but with a grain of salt for those who might not find her voice palatable. This is a shopping site after all, and I'd never tell a friend to buy a Lucinda CD without first making sure her voice didn't drive them up the wall, or that she wasn't too country for them, or that the lyrics seemed as brilliant to them as to me - she really isn't for everyone.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's energy never fails. She is upbeat and enthusiastic right from start to finish. Her interaction with the crowd is effective. Many times you see the crowd sing along. The bands joy and love of what their doing and the music their playing is energizing. If you weren't a fan before this DVD will make you one!

B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania never seems to lose the ability to entertain and bring the crowd on their feet. Back up by the Fabulous Falls she once again delivers an amazing performance. The best part of the dvd is that by owning it Shania will be able to give you a private concert in your home every single night. Delivering hit after hit from Honey I'm Home to Your Still the One. Want to hear the new songs. There on here of course I'm Gonna Getcha Good and boy does she. Love Nah! and seeing the crowd do the Nah wave great fun!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|This soundtrack is well worth the money. You don't even need to have liked-or for that matter seen-the movie to appreciate it. <br />I have new appreciation for Kelly Clarkson after hearing her version of &quot;The Trouble With Love Is.&quot; She really does have a great voice. I had dismissed her as a gimmick because of American Idol. <br />I also renewed my appreciation for the Beach Boys &quot;God Only Knows.&quot; To hear it on a track away from their other beach songs made me realize its haunting quality. <br />Joni Mitchell's cover of her classic hit &quot;Both Sides Now&quot; makes you ache. When I saw the movie, I was near tears when it played under a very emotional scene with Emma Thompson. When I heard it minus the visual cue, I teared up again-it's that heartbreaking. <br />Finally, two of the most fun tracks come at the end: &quot;Billy Mack's&quot; hilarious Christmas tune and a very catchy jingle by the young OLivia Olson &quot;All I want for Christmas is You.&quot; The Olson tune is playing under the commercials for the movie right now: perfect commercial music as it stays in your head. <br />Good movie, great soundtrack

B0000DJZA5|3.0|As a Beatle Fan since the first Ed Sullivan appearance, I need to profer my two cents about the Let It Be remix. All of the agonizing by fans about whether this is the genuine article or a McCartney vanity project is a wasted of time.  After hearing the bootleg countless times on my college radio station, the GET BACK album was highly anticipated, as was any Beatles album. As with Dylan, from Rubber Soul onward we were at the point where there was great curiosity about what the Beatles would sound like next.   To great surprise, during the wait, Rolling Stone reported that the lads were back in the studio and presto - Abby Road appeared on the shelves. The release of Let It Be was anticlimatic and upon first listen it became apparent why it was fiddled with and shelved temporarily. It was a nice album and probably if done by a lesser group it would have garnered better reviews. Particularly annoying to me was the variation of Let It Be and Get Back from the single releases. The more  subtle Harrison work on the LIB single as well as Ringo's restrained high hat were replaced and Get Back was truncated.    However, for me at least, Let It Be became over time more listenable, though I have never replaced my vinyl with the CD.     Despite the hype, Naked is probably not exactly what the Beatles set out to do originally, but its virtue lies in the clarity of the remix. Even without Spector's fine triage, there is a sparkle and depth in the sound that reminds me of how wonderful the sonics are on the Yellow Submarine reissue of a few years ago and makes me wish the entire catalog would be cleaned up.    So, the bottom line is that in, whatever form, Let It Be  is a fine, though not great Beatles album and both versions belong in your collection.
B00008AWOD|5.0|I heard this band, like many others, on the Music Choice channels that I have, but I usually skipped over them.  But when I played the game SSX 3, they were one of the bands featured with their song &quot;The Bitter End.&quot;  I decided to hear a little more of them so I got this cd.  Well, I'm glad I did because this band rocks.  <BR>This cd is almost like the ultimate feel bad album because it makes you feel so sad even when there is nothing wrong.  The cd starts out with a powerful instrumental titled &quot;Bulletproof Cupid.&quot;  Then it heads into songs that get sadder the more you listen.  Each song has so much emotion and can really break you down if you just broke up or someone died.  Some personal favorites of mine are &quot;The Bitter End&quot;, &quot;Second Sight&quot;, and &quot;This Picture.&quot;  I love this cd and I highly recommend that you get this cd.  Please get this cd and play SSX 3, too!

0440180295|5.0|After reading Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, I found myself wishing I had read it long ago and not waited so long.  I had heard mixed reviews, a lot of negatives, and never decided to find out for myself until this year.<br />While the book has been reviewed as both a comedy and a tragedy, I could not help but feel pain throughout the book, pain for Billy mostly, but pain for the human race.  <br />Vonnegut seems to know our faults, including his own, and exploits them in such a way that we are faced with a horrible image of how we treat one another, even in a time of tragedy.  We seem blind to others pain and focus solely on our own, and Vonnegut has something to say about that.  He introduces us to a character, both pathetic and not, stronger perhaps than most people, someone that would be and has been kicked around.  What makes Billy Pilgrim a hero in my eyes is not his plight, but his tremendous ability to survive, to find happiness in memories of what seems like a miserable life, from his overweight wife to his experieces during WWII.<br />We can learn much from Billy about our own lives, about finding happiness where it seems unavailable, about how we should treat one another.  This lesson alone helps keep this book on my list of favorite books of all time.
B00006EXDM|5.0|First, I agree with the prior reviewers about the content.<br />I already own this compilation as a two-CD set, and ordered this version solely because I thought all songs were on one CD:  They're not; they're still on two CDs.

0385508417|4.0|Grisham takes a cold and hard look at the over-materialism rampant in the celebration of Christmas today.  The characters are real, the challenges that someone would face trying to distance themselves from all the hubbub that is modern Christmas is highly believable.  A very well written and thought out book - if a little short.

B000002I25|5.0|The Doors arrived in 1967 right on time to bring darkness into mainstream during the Summer Of Love. 1967 was also the year The Beatles released &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot; and both albums were pivotal moments in a pivotal year. While The Beatles reflected more the hippie tone of peace and love, The Doors were about the darker visions of psychedelia. Today &quot;The Doors&quot; is still a stunning record, a piece of music and art that survives the test of time like all great, memorable artistic works. Of course, the spirit of the album lies in Jim Morrison, the legendary frontman who introduced William Blake, Nietzsche and Artaud to the rock stage. Morrison set the tone for the kind of wild, theatrical kind of performance that would be expressed by artists like Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Scott Weiland and Marilyn Manson. But the legacy of The Doors is more than just stage lunacy, there is the music's sound and Morrison's poetic flights (he considered himself a poet above anything else) which changed the way rock songs were written. Here was a band who indeed took you for a surreal trip, but the words were encoded with everything from Blake to Kurt Weill. If you liked driving hard rock then The Doors were it, if you were also a literary person, then you could also appreciate this band. &quot;Break On Through&quot; opens with an exhilarating, driving feel powered by Morrison's voice and lyrics which chant for transcendence. Other highlights include the band's two popular covers of &quot;Alabama Song (Whiskey Bar)&quot; from a German opera and Morrison's wild, acid-soaked take on Willie Dixon blues with a crawling &quot;Backdoor Man.&quot; &quot;The Crystal Ship&quot; is a hypnotic gem, the instrumentals are spacey and Morrison's croon is rich and clear. And of course there is &quot;Light My Fire,&quot; one of the great rock songs of all time. It opens with Ray Manzarek's memorable organ intro that drives the song forward with John Densmore's blendof jazz and rock drumming for a 7-minute ride that is pure psychedelic virtuosity. There is also the dark, dreamy &quot;End Of The Night&quot; which features some excellent bottleneck guitar from Robby <BR>Krieger. The masterpiece of the album is of course &quot;The End.&quot; This is a perfect example of what rock aficionados mean when they term a song &quot;classic.&quot; Every band member shines here and Morrison's visions and words resound like great literature or a midnight invocation. &quot;The Doors&quot; is one of the essential rock albums, it never grows old and expresses what rock creativity is all about. The sound, the words and Jim Morrison's poetic, wild, leather-clad stage persona has influenced so many artists such as Stone Temple Pilots, U2, The Cure, Patti Smith, Iggy Pop, Aerosmith, Soundgarden, Echo And The Bunnymen, X, Billy Idol, Pearl Jam, Creed, Jim Carroll and countless others. &quot;The Doors&quot; is a call to ecstacy and an album to cherish.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Incredible.  Listening to this moved me so much it brought tears to my eyes.  They sound like they are in the room with me.  What magic it was when these four musicians played together.  Yes, they've certainly passed the audition.  It's wonderful to finally hear what the Beatles originally intended for these tunes.  Their instincts were right!  This will be a Beatles staple with me.  It's a superior album and I recommend it to all.  It was entertaining listening to the accompanying \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc of 1969 conversation, little snippets of music and general goofing around, Beatles style. It's good that they included this, because unfortunately, the banter that is in the original \\"Let It Be\\" (before and after certain tracks) is not in \\"Let It Be...Naked\\".  Also included in the jewel case is a booklet with conversation excerpts from the \\"Let It Be\\" book.  I think this is a great package and well worth the money.  Of course, it is, and always was, about the music and the music is superior...first rate!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is realy great.... I was intrested in hearing it after I heard about all the collaborations she had on this one (singers and producers), and I wasn't dissappointed! this cd is great, probebly her best... If you didn't like her last cd 'Britney' and if you didn't like the first single 'Me Against The Music' you should still give this one a try - this cd is VERY diffrent from the last one, and the first single is diffrent from most songs on the album... The songs are great, and Britney proves she's still the queen of pop!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the \\"Let It Be\\" I've been waiting for since the soundtrack was originally released. It fulfills the promise of the intimate, live performance that the Beatles intended it to be. Gone are the dreary strings and choirs. The order in which the songs appear makes much more sense and you can hear all the nuances of the music and vocals for the first time. The song versions are sometimes different from both the original \\"Let It Be\\" release and the Anthology release, but that is a plus because it gives us both a different perspective on, and often a definitive take of, many of the songs. The bonus CD also gives us a look behind the scenes and dispels much of the popular myth that the Beatles were completely at odds during the recording of this historic album. The original soundtrack and the Beatles Anthologies are in print and available for anyone unhappy with this release, but as for myself I have all of them in my CD rack.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|It's amazing how a double CD of b-sides and unreleased tracks can wind up being one of the most amazing albums to be released by the band in a long time.  I love all their stuff but something about this album seems like a special gift to their fans.  The fact that the songs seem random only helps to reinforce the amazing versatility yet recognizable sound they have.<br />Unlike some people who can not get their heads around Pearl Jam's newer material and only want them to keep releasing \\"Ten\\" over and over again, I think they have continued to push the boundaries of real rock and roll without selling out and jumping on any of the fads like nu-metal and what have you.  They are one of the greatest rock bands in the history of rock and this album only further proves it.<br />And the fact that its priced the price of 1 regular CD again shows that Pearl Jam really respects their fans and is not just trying to gouge them for an extra buck.
B0000E1ALR|1.0|You know what? All these disasters, happening or waiting to happen upon us, global warming, mutant foods and humans, viri escaping our labs, wars over oil, wars over religion, and all the rest of it, well, the more i live the more i understand that we haven't actually earned ourselves anything better.<BR>    Lemme see here: this this the guy that bills himself, or more precisely his songs as &quot;working class&quot;. Nice one Bruce, but I also know a good joke or two. It reminds me of the other classic touch of humour when Clapton was singing (and still is) the blues with an armani suit or when M.Jagger sings for the billionth time &quot;I cant get no satisfaction&quot; while having x-amount of millions in his bank account. It's all hilarious really.<BR>    Working class? Well, unless the working class is supposed to be a mindless horde that will rave over anything with slightly more substance than the intelligence of a microwave oven I'm truly at a loss here.<BR>   Not to mention that if the working class is supposed to be as dumb as buying the same Greatest Hits CD with the addition of 2-3 more songs, or, even worse, if they're supposed to drain their wallets for the old &quot;remastered songs&quot; trick then we truly all deserve another Bruce Greatest hits. <BR>   And, not to forget, that immediately preceeding this was the &quot;Rising&quot;, a valiant effort at milking public sentiment for more $$$.<BR>    And to keep this short, all the abovewritten arguments are perfectly in naught. Because the &quot;working class&quot; will nicely fall (once more) for all the old tricks. And it wont be the last time either. Man, may the cosmic forces help us all endure.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|First of all, we all know that Brit was not going to come out with the greatest album of the century.  We got what we expected and wanted, a fun group of dance songs to play in the living room and jump around to.  Nothing that will make us think too hard, but will induce some singing along and shaking of the bootie.  It's halarious that people get all worked up about the music, its not about the music, its about the hair, the beats, the videos, the stories...it's about Britney.
B0000T6JH4|5.0|this cd was worth the money. the songs do sound different, but i think it was in a good way, this is the way the beatles wanted to us to hear, and its how i wanted to hear it. the second disk was fun, listening to them talk and stuff<br />well worth the money
B00000FCBC|2.0|This 2 cd set is not as good as I thought it was going to be.There is probably 7 songs out of 27 songs that are good and the rest is just a bunch of cover songs that I dont really care for.What is the deal with removing 2 good songs from kill em all and placing it here?Maybe to make more money.To conclude,I dont really think this cd is worth buying.DO NOT SUPPORT THESE LOSERS ANYMORE!!!
B0000A36J5|4.0|I have written this review to make one simple point... not to go into detail of the plot of the movie. I'd be surprised that anyone reading this doesn't know the plot already.<br />When the first &quot;you must be a nerd to get this edition&quot; gift set came out it was fairly cool. The national geographic special was cool and the book ends were neat because I can stack all my lord of the rings DVDs on the shelf between them.<br />With this edition you get a Gollum statue and a DVD on HOW THE GOLLUM STATUE WAS MADE! Yes.. wonderful idea... I am so interested in polystone statue work. I was thinking of quitting my job and selling little statues like this at renaissance festivals for the rest of my life so this DVD has the perfect timing. Personally, I don't think stone craft got enough attention in this multi million dollar trilogy. In fact, they should have made the entire movie about some guy in a cheap workshop carving a statue instead of all this &quot;the ring must be destroyed&quot; nonsense. Maybe the Two Towers would have been successful if they had done that instead of only making the paltry sum it made in the theatre. I know I've already lost a few people so let me say that THIS IS SARCASM.<br />While I was loser enough to get the gift set of Fellowship, this time around I think I'll be getting just the regular four disk release and not the gift set version. I love the extended editions. For people who want more out of the movies they're great.<br />Remeber... I wrote this reveiw just to give some perspective and perhaps make you laugh a little.

B00005JMFR|5.0|The Matrix Revolutions is the BEST Film to date. It had Love, Sorrow,Art,Religion,Action and very good action that is. Many people disliked this movie for so many reasons 1 being that it talked to much and 2nd that they didnt get the ending.Here's what i think there was talking to tie the loose ends from part one and two of course but people these days jus want action action action. Andy and Larry ended this movie with u thinking y wouldnt they, they created this trilogy by making the viewer think and thas good because in movies no one likes to use their minds.They want you to make ur ending since this ties up with religion \\"THE ONE\\" or The Messiah or Savior will unite evil with good and he will lead his people to prosperity like Christ and Muhhamad and Buddha. This movie will effect other movies and productions (Like as if hasnt already done that)hundreds of films have followed this movies footsteps from film making to a concept and the way Andy and Larry ended their Trilogy was unbelievable.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Following a 16-year hiatus from the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy, writer/director/producer George Lucas returned with the beginning of a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy set years before the events that take place in the first trilogy.  This set of &quot;prequels&quot; (as the term was coined) begins with the 1999 film &quot;Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace&quot;.  In this film, the Empire does not yet exist.  Instead, the galaxy is governed by the Republic, whose main political body is a large, elected assembly of representatives known as the Senate.  The chief executive, known as the Chancellor, has very limited powers and is elected by the Senate.  Unfortunately, due in part to its size and countless political interests, the Senate operates extremely slowly and is incapable of making quick decisions when necessary.<br />Such is the case with the planet of Naboo, which is headed by an elected queen, Queen Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman).  Naboo is under threat of invasion by a group calling itself the Trade Federation, which is headed by Viceroy Nute Gunray (Silas Carson), because Queen Amidala has refused to sign a peace treaty with it that would ultimately deprive Naboo of its sovereignty.  Naboo's senatorial representative, Senator Palpatine (the returning Ian McDiarmid), is able to have Chancellor Finis Valorum (Terence Stamp, who played &quot;Bernadette&quot; in the 1994 Australian film &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert&quot;) send two Jedi to Naboo to broker a peace agreement.  Upon the advice of a cloaked individual known as Darth Sidious (also Ian McDiarmid), the Viceroy orders that the two Jedi, a young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and his teacher Qui-Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson), be ambushed upon their arrival to the Federation starship.  However, they barely escape to Naboo's surface along with the Federation's invading droid army.  On Naboo's surface, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon meet an irritating, non-human Naboo native named Jar Jar Binks (voice done by Ahmed Best) who helps them obtain transportation to Queen Amidala's palace without being noticed by the invading droid army.  Once there, they help the resistant Queen escape the planet's surface (along with Jar Jar), but damage to their ship forces them to travel to the desert planet of Tattooine instead of the Republic's primary planet known as Coruscant.  On Tattooine, their search for replacement parts leads them to a winged individual known as Watto (voice done by Andrew Secombe), his very young slave, Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and Anakin's mother who is also enslaved, Shmi Skywalker (Pernilla August).<br />As with any previous &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, the cinematography and special effects used in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; are excellent; but sadly, the writing and dialog are pallid.  The film's two biggest problems are the character Jar Jar Binks and Jake Lloyd's portrayal of Anakin.  When George Lucas released the previous &quot;Star Wars&quot; film in 1983 (&quot;Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi&quot;), he introduced a bunch of furry little creatures known as Ewoks.  Many people found them endearing, but some found them annoying.  In similar fashion, Lucas created an underwater species on Naboo known as the Gungan, of which Jar Jar Binks is part.  Unfortuneately, the Gungan's Jamaican accents and immature vocabulary made them (especially Jar Jar) far more annoying than endearing.  As for Jake Lloyd, it is very strange that with so many fine, young talented actors, that Lucas would select a highly animated and unconvincing actor to portray one of the film's most important characters.<br />There are, however, many memorable scenes in the film that partially make up for the film's inadequacies including Obi-Wan &amp; Qui-Gon on the Federation starship, views of Naboo, the pod race, Qui-Gon's first encounter with Darth Maul (played by Ray Park, voice by Peter Serafinowicz), Queen Amidala's address to the Senate, Anakin standing before the Jedi Council that is headed by Yoda (voice done by Frank Oz), the Gungan/droid battle, the Naboo castle invasion, and the final battle between Darth Maul and Qui-Gon with Obi-Wan.  Other memorable characters include C-3PO (the returning Anthony Daniels), R2-D2 (the returning Kenny Baker), Sebulba (voice done by Lewis Macleod), Captain Panaka (Hugh Quarshie), Jabba the Hut and Boss Nass (Brian Blessed).<br />Overall, I rate the double-DVD version of &quot;Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace&quot; with 4 out of 5 stars.  The additional DVD includes many fascinating clips of how the film was made, including the creation of Darth Maul and the choreography of his fights.
0140277447|5.0|I read this book when it was first published, and I was very intrigued by the evidence provided in the book. Along the way, I learned much more of Naking Massacre's history from my parents, friends, and other historians.  In short, I believe every native or foreign-born Chinese should read this book not to hate but to understand the working dynamics of Chinese and Japanese.<br />For many of those that are familiar with the regional hatred: why so many Chinese, Koreans, Philippinos, etc. simply hate Japanese. It is not only because of massacres such as this (which I can assure you there were many well-documented Japanese atrocities inflicted on other groups of people in Asia), but it is because there are powerful groups in Japan that simply refuse to acknowledge and consequently to apologize for the past crime. Did you know that the standard Japanese textbooks (until recently and perhaps still is the case) still did not recognize the Japanese invasion of Asia in WW2?<br />Furthermore, it is readers like &quot;eligarf&quot; who are brained washed by Japanese schools' teachings. It is sad, therefore, that these innocent Japanese growing up neglectful of the truth and yet wonders why all the neighbors hate them. Why is it such a big deal when Koizumi visited the Yasukuni Shrine? Why the mere mention of Naking massacre to some Chinese bring forth raw emotions that is at least on parallel with 9/11. Why Japan's largest trading partners are not its close neighbors, but western nations such as the US. With ignorance such as this, the current and future generations of Japanese are at a huge disadvantage, on the regional age, in school, in business, and in life. That is the real tragedy.<br />Truth does not always set one free, but it at least brings one on to the path of reconciliation.
B00005JMFR|3.0|Though I enjoyed this movie tremendously, as well as I enjoyed both Reloaded and the original. It seems as though the movie's climax came to soon and was rushed. From the first Matrix I beleived we actually had an intense Sci Fi story on our hands, which we did to a point. Once Neo goes into the Matrix and learns all of the tricks of the world, it quickly shifts towards an action movie. Not that I minded the change but I thought that at some point throughout the second or third movie we would have some more science fiction. Though there were small parts of it in reloaded, the ending where you learn about the past of the matrix, they failed to make an impression with it. It seemed like throughout the second and third movie they were trying to confuse people so much that they put themselves in a corner when it came to the ending. It drops off at a point and leaves you wondering if maybe its would have been worth it to make a fourth one and actually show a good ending. One of the major disappointments is the lack of creativity when it came to action points. The fight in the lobby with seraph to free neo is a rehash of the first movie, only this time people can use antigravity. This goes against what was explain in the first movie, \\"rules of gravity can be bent but not broken\\", and the attack on the dock was almost the same images over and over. I wish that a true sci fi series could be made and i thought we had one with the matrix but by the end all we are concern about is mathmatical equations.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|I have to say that while I enjoyed this cd, the only thing that went through my mind is &quot;why does he have to sing so much.  His voice is almost intolerable...yet he continues to sing on the majority of his songs.&quot;  If I'm not mistaken, I think my eardrums started to bleed.  It goes without saying that the first album was absolutely amazing, but I would like to see a return to the beginning, which is what attracted Enigma's audience in the first place.  The chanting was Enchanting.  Cretu is extremely talented, and I'm sure can find ways to keep the music fresh and new.  His wife's vocals are so soothing that it seems crazy not to feature her more.  What she did with &quot;the Principles of Lust&quot; is nothing short of mesmerizing.  I just hope Cretu will listen to his fans and give us a quality piece of music that we so longingly yearn for that has more instrumental and less vocals.  We don't want a pop album, but the stuff that Enigma is made of.  We all know he's capable of it.......  but that's just my opinion.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let it Be...Naked is the fulfillment of a vision 30-plus years overdue.  The Beatles wanted this album to be raw--no overdubs, no studio tricks, and for goodness sake, no strings or horns.  The Let it Be that we've all come to know (and, let's face it, love) is an entertaining album despite Phil Spector's intrusion; it's just not the album the Beatles conceptualized.  THIS is that album.  Yes: it is less polished in spots than the original Let it Be.  But that's the beauty of it.  We finally get to hear them play, warts and all, without a sea of sappy strings in the way, sweetening up what was intended to be sugar-free.  I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because I liked the inclusion of Dig It and Maggie May (the latter especially) and find myself missing them on the new disc.  Well done to Sir Paul and the rest.
B0000C9ZLD|1.0|I read lots of great reviews both for this album and its predecessor, Is This It, and I went out about bought Room on Fire on a whim.  I listened to it all the way through once.  I tried to listen to it again, but...couldn't.  It was just so bad.  The bass figures are the sort of simplistic crap you expect from a high school garage band, the guitar doesn't do anything interesting on all but maybe one or two songs, and the vocals are buried so deep in the mix that you can't even hear them (though after looking at the lyrics in the liner notes, I decided this wasn't necessarily a bad thing).  The whole thing just seemed bland and uninspired.  I really did want to like the album, honest.  But bottom line, if these guys are supposed to be the &quot;saviors of rock and roll,&quot; I don't think I want to be redeemed.
B00005JM0B|4.0|When I first heard about this movie I wondered what in the world they were going to do with the plot.  The first one was fresh and has become a touchstone of the popular culture.  The second one had so many wonderful and fantastic effects that you can forgive the plot for being a tweaked version of the first (with really cool tweaks).  Well, what they did was remove most of the requirement for a plot by making the killing machine absolutely relentless, hopelessly advanced, and who has maybe 100 words in the whole movie.  She is just there to chase and kill and then be squashed.  Kristanna Loken is effective in this role, but I don't find her as menacing as Robert Patrick was.  Her face is so controlled that you never get a sense of power.  You SEE the power and she is playing a machine after all, but there you have it.<br />Arnold reprises his role as a third identical robot (as close as you can be to identical 10 years down the road) and he does it quite well.  But he too is given few words.  Some of the jokes he gets are pretty good, but a couple of them are groaners.<br />The stunts are visually very powerful, but the bigger your screen the better they will look.  Some of them are so large that the actors almost disappear on a small TV screen.<br />Nick Stahl is OK as a whacked out John Connor, but he seems to be panting in every scene.  Does he have a breathing problem?  Clair Danes is the best thing in the movie.  She is terrific.<br />The DVD extras are OK. There is a pretty funny scene where Arnold plays the soldier who was used as the model for the robot soldiers that became the terminators.  I don't know if it was made for the movie and taken out or just made as a joke, but it is memorable, but would have drastically altered the tone and pace of the movie as it is.  There are out takes, a special on the action figures for adults that is weirdly commercial but interesting at the same time, some stuff on the T3 video game, the HBO show that you have probably already scene and the customary voice over tracks by the director and another with some of the actors.<br />I enjoyed the movie and realize it isn't as powerful as the first two.  For what it tried to be it is very well done.  We hoped for more and were a bit disappointed that we weren't blown away.  But as I have thought about what is really there, I think it is OK for what it aimed at being.y already scene and the customary voice over tracks by the director and another with some of the actors.<br />I enjoyed the movie and realize it isn't as powerful as the first two.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I've already read a number of the reviews of the latest from Dream Theater on here and they as varied as can be. Much like any band's new release (especially in the metal genre), it's goes directly under the microscope for close examination for any differences from previous outings and, more often that not, how far a departure it is from said person's favorite catalog album. From my readings, everyone has what they consider to be the quintessential Dream Theater album and I, as well, have my own - Metropolis Part II: Scenes From A Memory. However, I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Six Degrees&quot; after a few listens and went into &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; with no expectations other than to enjoy it.<br />What I got was; in my opinion, the spiritual successor to &quot;Scenes&quot;. I will admit, I read some news posts that lead me to believe that this album was going to be heavily influenced by Metallica and be more straightforward overall and that scared me some. I feared that the superb balance of melody and technicality was going to be submerged in an attempt to appease mainstream rock radio. Luckily, I was wrong and &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; is classic Dream Theater, through and through...albeit a bit heavier.<br />The opening riff of &quot;As I Am&quot; bears similarity to the first track on Acid Bath's &quot;When The Kite String Pops&quot; album and though it's the most &quot;radio friendly&quot;, it opens a glimpse of the technical precision that emerges as the CD moves forward. Once again, all talent here is very present and accounted for. Mike Portnoy's fluent and rapid fire drum mastery is nothing short of breathtaking and he proves once again why he is a close second to the crown held by Neal Peart of Rush. Every instrument is in perfect symmetrical balance with one another and even when one player as at the far end of the spectrum playing something that most people don't care to fathom, the rest of the rhythm section can be playing something elementary and simple and everything will remain in complete harmony with each other.<br />My only complaint is the hip hop tendencies that rear their ugly head in the 2nd and 3rd songs. Though they are few and far between, James LaBrie breaks into these occasional rap-like fits that do little to compliment the song overall. If anything, they give the listener a momentary scare, praying that this isn't the main direction of the song but before it can settle in, it's gone. Aside from that minor gripe, James LaBrie's vocals are still in outstanding form and he is fast becoming one of my favorite vocalists in metal today.<br />The downside to this album is that because of it's outstanding musicianship and technical stylings, it's likely that it will not see any major airplay which is sad because &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; is such a good recording. As a society, we are racing towards wanting everything better, bigger and faster but when it comes to music, we want everything short and sweet so it's easier for the masses to digest and DT's shortest track (minus the instrumental) is 7 1/2 minutes long which is about 4 1/2 minutes too long for rock radio.  Despite the lack of publicity that they will receive from their label, Dream Theater has concocted yet another metal masterwork and to the real fans, that is the most important thing.nd simple and everything will remain in complete harmony with each other.<br />My only complaint is the hip hop tendencies that rear their ugly head in the 2nd and 3rd songs.

B00005JM0B|1.0|Of course he ran for Governor of California, he hasn't had a hit movie since True Lies (over a deacde ago). And of course the lemmings voted him in.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|D.T. have been on a downward spiral for sometime, but Train Of Thought is a new low. This is not something I say lightly. I've been a fan since Images And Words, but when I hear Linkin Park style rap on a Dream Theater CD something is wrong! And it's not just the rapping, it's the muddy sound, lack of melody and juvenile &quot;angry&quot; lyrics.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This is one of the all-time classic westerns and my favorite &quot;spaghetti western&quot; from Sergio Leone. It features outstanding performances by Claudia Cardinale, Henry Fonda, Jason Robards, and Charles Bronson. Claudia plays the character of Mrs. Jill McBain, whose husband and stepchildren were ruthlessly murdered by a gunman named Frank (Henry Fonda) who works for a business tycoon named Morton. Before dying, Mr. McBain purchased a large piece of railroad land by a big waterwell which he hopes to build into a big town called Sweetwater. Jill inherits this property but Frank and his henchmen try to wrest it from her. The mysterious lone gunfighter Harmonica (Charles Bronson) and the outlaw Cheyenne (Jason Robards) come to Jill's aid. Harmonica has something of a personal vendetta in mind while helping Jill and hooking up with Cheyenne. <br />The movie pays homage to the great American westerns in the past (movies such as &quot;The Searchers&quot; and &quot;Shane&quot;, plus many others), while putting on a revisionist twist of its own in the story. Curiously, among the spaghetti westerns made by Leone, this is the only one which features a woman as its central character. This movie talks about the passing of the era of gunfighters into the modern industrial era (represented by the advent of railroads). One of the great features of this movie is the classic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. <br />I really love this Western and it only gets better through the passage of time. The 2-DVD set is great -- it features a commentary on the first disc and several featurettes (a 3-part documentary which interviews cast members, the director, cinematographer and admirers of the movie; another documentary on the revolution of the railroad) on the second disc. There are some scenes included in this DVD which were absent in the video version (the complete version). The picture and sound quality are excellent. If you love classic westerns and are a fan of Sergio Leone's westerns, you will definitely love this movie. It is a must-have!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Although Ian might think war is horrible and evil, it sometimes is needed. What are Holy Wars for? Man kind isn't perfect. Yes, it would be easy if everyone just sat down and said, &quot;I'm never going to start war again,&quot; but it's never going to happen. Don't live in your, &quot;everything should be perfect,&quot; world because it's never going to happen. You're going to have people hating each other because of religion, land, and jealousy. It's man's nature. I bet even now you have a sort of &quot;war&quot; going on when you fight or yell at someone. You contradict yourself.<br />In those times of dispute you need people willing to go out and say, &quot;hey, I will get myself killed if it saves 1,000 lives somewhere now and in the future.&quot; And having an uncle in WW2, this movie made me even more proud of him. I would find myself bragging that my uncle fought to save lives, even if he had to take some in the process, and after this miniseries I found myself even prouder. This movie makes you proud of them because you see what they have to put behind them to do. When I watched the scene with Maj. Winters running onto a hill only to see a young boy kneeling in the grass and he hesitates to shoot him, you come to realize this is something these men will never forget. They realize what they're doing, but they do it because it's their duty.<br />This was an amazingly well done miniseries. I was so proud of it. I remember before it came out on HBO I would count down the days waiting for it to come on. Then when it did I would record it every week because I had school the next morning and couldn't stay up late. So I'd get home on Monday and sit down and watch it. There's nothing to explain the feelings you get when you're watching this. It's like you're actually living through it.<br />And it was actually nice to see a war documentary type movie that didn't have a love story written in. I can't tell you how much I loved this mini series.<br />I'm 18 and can respect a movie like that. It's more than just about heroes and winning, it's an insight on the horrors of war that you've only heard about.<br />Who could foget the poor guy who died yelling, &quot;I don't want to die,&quot; over and over again?<br />Not to mention the music composed by Michael Kamen is beautiful. Rest his soul.

B0000CD5I6|5.0|We saw Jethro Tull in concert and they played some of the music you will find on this CD. I highly reccommend it. It does not diminish the beauty of Christmas music, but enhances it with a fresh new approach. Let me assure you, I have been  a fan since the 70s and this is Jethro Tull at their best! Why settle for Bing Crosby when you can have REAL music this holiday season!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album is ten times better then Mer de Noms. If it wasn't for \\"Judith\\", Mer de Noms would be a complete waste of plastic. With this album they got closer to the Tool sound but there is enough difference to make them a credible band, independent of Tool. \\"Pet\\" is my favorite song on this album. The Package, Weak and Powerless(although the remix on the underworld soundtrack is better), Blue, and The Outsider are also great tracks. \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is the type of song that is perfect for getting high and singing along to. Actually the entire album is great for that, or at least the getting high to it part. This album is well worth the the listen. <br />The Package 7.5/10 <BR>Weak and Powerless 7.5/10 <BR>The Noose 6/10 <BR>Blue 8/10<BR>Vanishing 7/10<BR>A Stranger 7/10 <BR>The Outsider 8/10 <BR>Crimes 5/10 <BR>The Nurse Who Loved Me 8.5/10 <BR>Pet 9.5/10 <BR>Lullaby 5/10 <BR>Gravity 8/10

If you haven't already picked up a copy for yourself, I'm sure there's a Shania fan on your Christmas list that would love one!  They won't be disappointed!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have always loved the persona of Britney but found some of the tracks on her past CDs to be very bubble gum and boring. In The Zone is one of the best CDs I have bought in ages. The whole CD is perfect to jam to in the car, while getting ready to go out, or at the gym. My personal favorite is \\"Toxic\\", but I also am really into \\"Me Against the Music\\", \\"Everytime\\", and \\"Touch of My Hand\\". The beats are electronic and Britney's voice is sexy but not over processed. There is also some clear Madonna influence on a bunch of the tracks. You need to own this CD!!!
B00004U8P9|1.0|Maybe it's the camp. Maybe it's the grating music. Or just having to see Tim Curry and Barry Bostwick in drag. This movie is AWFUL, and I certainly don't mean \\"it's so bad  it's good\\". It's puerile and self-indulgent, and a sure-fire remedy for boredom. Because faced with the prospect of having to watch this movie would get me motivated to do anything but that.<br />OK, I'm willing to concede that RHPSh as some sort of attempt to make a 70s anthem for gays (or anyone else unaccepted by mainstream society). Find the courage in your alleged \\"freakishness\\" and ta-daa! It's outta the closet and \\"Heeeelloooo world!\\" After all, the \\"straights\\" and their society are the true freakish forces in the universe, and the \\"evil\\" Frank 'n Furter just wanted to create a safe haven for his kind. And besides, EVERYONE has a little hidden freak inside them just clamoring to get out.<br />Still, this movie is beyond unwatchable. For freaks on parade \\"Breakfast Club\\" was more entertaining.
0060012218|5.0|When I picked this book up off the shelf at a bookstore in Boston, I expected nothing special.  I was looking for an edgy teen novel and I just coulnd't find one that day.  I looked at this book, deciding if it didn't sound interesting, I'd just leave.  I read the front flap and fell in love.  This way the edgy novel I had been looking for.  Homosexuality in a teen book seems to be frowned upon lately.  People say younger teens aren't old enough to handle that kind of thing.  That is totally wrong.  Not only is the main character gay, his best friend is bisexual.  This correctly portrays the main character's relationships with his friends during high school.  I loved it.  It's a quick read, but worth it.  If you were ever homophobic, it will make you regret it, or at least I think so.
B00005214X|5.0|'All Things Must Pass' is a classic album and the excellent remastering work done here ensures that it's the best it's ever sounded. The packaging is also terrific, with the CDs being held in two cardboard sleeves, a booklet with new notes from George, and a sturdy and attractive box to store it all in. The artwork on the front of the box, CD sleeves and booklet is a little depressing as we see industrial and commercial &quot;progress&quot; growing around the photo of George and the gnomes taken from the cover of the original vinyl release. George definitely makes a statement with his choice of artwork here. <br />You can read detailed critiques of the music contained in this set in other Amazon reviews...but I'd like to mention the new version of 'My Sweet Lord'. It's received some flak from some critics, but I love it. Sure, it's somewhat different, but the incorporation of Indian music combined with Sam Brown's backing vocals makes for a very memorable and enjoyable alternative take on the classic hit. I listen to it more now than the original. It's a more intimate version and I'm glad that George decided to re-record it. <br />I sincerely hope that younger music fans listen to this album and discover the superb tunes and meaningful lyrics on offer here that still stand the test of time. In a world where artists are considered &quot;cool&quot; for offering up increasingly hateful and negative images and messages, and where there is so much meaningless and empty pop/dance music cluttering the airwaves, I think now is a perfect time for a new generation to discover and hopefully appreciate the musical legacy of George Harrison.
B0000E1WKE|3.0|I am so glad that Mrs. Houston-Brown is still in the game.  I have admired the entire family: Cissy, Dee Dee, Dionne (of course) and Ms Missy (Whitney, that is!)<br />While it may be disheartening to know about her trials and tribulation, I am certainly glad that Whitney STILL SOUNDS GOOD.  My hope is that there will be different producers on the next project, just to mix it up a bit, ya' know??!!  <br />This is a great cd to get the family in the mood for the holiday's.  When ordering, keep in mind that while nothing lasts forever, class and style are never lost.  And this &quot;Holiday&quot; album is proof of that!!!! Thanks God that there are still singers that make music for the &quot;GROWN FOLKS' :-)<br />KEEP ON GOING, WHITNEY!!!!!!!!
B0000E6I1J|5.0|From the opening track, Sarve Shaam with its wonderful intonation of bells, sarod and hypnotic voices and Eric Clapton's introduction until its conclusion on the second disc with Joe Brown's wonderful &quot;I'll See You In My Dreams,&quot; this set is as wonderful a remembrance any man could hope for from his friends and loved ones.<br />Olivia makes it clear in the notes that George, the quiet one, was in fact full of life, pursuing his marriage and family with the same intensity and respect that he treated his career, all the while retaining the playfulness that set he and his Liverpool colleagues off from everyone else ever in rock. When you consider that this man is one of the 4 reasons anybody ever wanted to be a rock musician, you might think you were approaching the sacred. In fact, as is clear from his friends, he is someone they went to to play ukeleles with as well as to worship or garden with.<br />He was a whole man. His music in his Beatles, solo, Travelling Wilbury and final days was always about life led on the ground, in the material world, yet not bound by it. It was Harrison who first saw the difference between Haight Ashbury and enlightnement. It was Harrison who realized his tremendous good fortune could be harnessed to work remarkably good things for less fortunate people. He respected what his craft could accomplish and was a selfless, ego-free spirit who could race cars, produce silly movies and prove loyal to family and friends. He was Everyman who had come into good fortune and knew not to take it for granted.<br />As to the music herein: it is just GREAT! His mates came to this project with great love and respect for their fallen comrade. Ravi and Anoushka Shankar get the project off and running with a couple of sitar pieces and a terrific rendition of &quot;The Inner Light&quot;. One is reminded of the start of THE CONCERT FOR BANGLADESH, and its tremendous setting of a tone of consideration. Much the same effect is produced here. It anchors you in the spiritual world that Harrison embraced.<br />The second side essays his pop work. Wilbury buddy Lynne kicks things off with &quot;I Want To Tell You,&quot; and the CD rocks from that point on. The emotional centerpiece is Ringo's &quot;Photograph.&quot; Tough to listen to that without getting misty. It is absolutely the best Ringo's ever done that. Paul kicks in with a very bright and emotionally uplifting &quot;Something&quot; that comes from the heart, as well as the uke. He returns with Clapton to blisteringly deliver &quot;While My Guitar,&quot; nearly as transcendent as &quot;Bangla Desh's&quot; version. Tom Petty is just the right touch, especially on &quot;Handle With Care,&quot; handled with Dhani Harrison, as sure a chip off the old bloke as you might get. Dad must have been beaming! Billy Preston ecstatically revels in &quot;My Sweet Lord,&quot; then Clapton burns it up again on &quot;Wah Wah,&quot; which was a reference to him anyway, before Joe Brown sends it all off lovingly.<br />The son of a Catholic busdriver and Nurse in Liverpool who often said he was sure he would never have amounted to anything had it not been for The Beatles, obviously took from his parents a sense of finding a spirituality to guide his life. That he touched so many of his colleagues as all of us as always and forever being the genuine article says all there needs to be said about the importance of living in the material world with a sense of faith.u in the spiritual world that Harrison embraced.<BR>The second side essays his pop work.

B0000E1WKE|3.0|I have always been a fan of Whitney Houston.  Her voice is now, and always will be, incomparable.  Watching her personal struggles over the past few years has been disheartening.  How could somebody who seemingly had it all fall so far so fast?  After last year's haphazard &quot;Just Whitney&quot; album, &quot;One Wish&quot; is a return to form, vocally.  For the first time in years, Houston's singing seems almost effortless.  Her voice touches the diva-like highs and lows that have been missing from her most recent works.  Unfortunately, Whitney overdoes many of the songs.  The excess of ad-libs takes away from the simplicity of the songs, and the attempts at modernizing the music hurt the overall package.  While the album has its moments, it is not a classic.  Had the Whitney of the late '80's or early '90's recorded it, it could very well have been timeless.  While Whitney's heart is certainly in the right place here, she fails to realize that less is sometimes more.  The best tracks are those recycled from &quot;The Preacher's Wife&quot; soundtrack.  (&quot;Who Would Imagine a King&quot; and &quot;Joy To The World&quot;)
B00008J4P5|2.0|Yank four-piece the White Stripes - consisting of Jack White, Meg White, and their respective egos - used to be good when nobody paid them any attention. The album before this, whatever it was called, was a masterpiece of raw, untainted rock 'n' roll. Then they got all artsy and old-school and started trying to make statements about the state of the music industry today (which is to say, dire) by using 1920s (or whenever) equipment. All very well and good, but ultimately pointless when your head swells over your eyeballs and you can't see the pencil in order to write a decent song.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Enigma is one of those ambient prototype organizations that has to evolve to stay on top of their own game.  Even with Enya she must not put too many albums out so her consistant style doesn't become old hat.  However, she too evolves on subtle uncurrent as Enigma does.  I was one of the few, or so it would seem, that actually found Screen Behind the MIrror to be excellent.  I like the use of Carmina Barina (O'Fortuna) on the signature tune.  <br />As for Voyageur it has subtle sounds that return me to not only their first album (which is sampled in several tracks - listen very closey and you'll hear it) but is by far the best album since Cross of Changes (which is my personal favourite! - Return to Innocence ROCKS!!!)  I am a huge Mike Oldfield fan and Michael Cretu and MIke Oldfield are friends.  You can hear many many similarities (and the same drum tracks used) between Mike Oldfield's 2002 album Tres Lunas and Michael Cretu's 2003 Voyageur.  I find Voyageur so appealing partly do to this reason.  It has a very nice ambient flow where one can just bob their head along without causing neck injury.  <br />Unlike the main reviewer for, I guess Amazon.com, (Matthew Cooke) has no feel for the beauty of Michael Cretu's raspy vocals and how nice an accompaniment they can be!!  He sees them as an annoyance - probably Matthew is a fan of Britney (NO TALENT) Spears (who should be Speared! - might shut her up and get her out of the way for more talented individuals!!!)  Michael Cretu's vocals are beautiful and Total Eclipse of the Moon is one of my favourites on Voyageur (but is far too short a piece - should have been longer in my opinion!)  To Matthew and others who dislike Voyageur because it does not capture Enigma's debut album - Chant was popular at that time in history!  It would not have been prudent or good business sense to use that formula again and again to dislike of music listeners everywhere.  Basically, it would have gotten old quick!  Let's use Mike Oldfield's constant rehash of the Tubular Bells franchise as an immediate example of a marketing disaster!!  Four BELL albums plus a remake of the 1973 original (TOO MUCH OF THE SAME FORMULA MAKES PEOPLE SICK - hince why the boy and girl bands have gone - BUH BYE in the past year - OVER IT - DONE WITH IT!!!!)<br />Voyageur brings a nice new and fresh approach to the techno-oriented ambient style. I highly recommend picking up this album and show the music biz and especially RIAA what REAL music and REAL musicianship sounds like!!!
B000002SE0|5.0|I saw Corelli toward the end of his career, back in the days when the Metropolitan Opera toured the country each spring.  He was Romeo and, in his mid-fifties, made my then-19-year-old heart beat faster.  He was a wonderful singer, and romatically convicing to boot.  In &quot;Turandot&quot;, he is at his best, singing a role so challenging that few tenors attempt it, except the absolute best.  His singing is ringing and virile, but also has grace and nuance.  This role, I think, defines his abilities as not other does.  Treasure it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania and her band are great performers and they deliver big time on this DVD.  Shania is an excellent live singer and her band really play well together.  Her interaction with her fans is fun to watch and don't be surprised if you get up off your couch and start dancin'.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney Spears is not the &quot;Madonna of our Generation&quot; and it becomes painfully obvious after listening to this CD. This CD is mediocre but it has its shining moments. &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, &quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, and &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; are the only songs on this CD worth listening to.
B0000024V2|5.0|Johnny Winter at his finest. He shreds through Dylan's Highway 61, jams with brother Edgar and adds about 10 chapters to the blues-rock bible.  The original vinyl was great. It was a three sided double album; side four was blank!
B000000IV0|5.0|This is a truly exceptional album and it did change music. AS far as Pearl Jam vs. Nirvana, I don't really care and i do agrree that led zeppelin is one of the greatest rock bands ever. However you ahve to go back a little bit farther to say who inspired modern rock. The band that paved the way for Led Zeppelin and other rock like Queen and Kansas was the Beatles. from 1963-1970 they took music from 2 minute songs like i want to hold your hand to classics like come together. George Harrison was creative when other artisits were not and they revolutionized the face of rock more then any other band ever has.
B00006IU73|5.0|These guys are really something. I actually came across them by accident. I was going to see an opeth concert in toronto and these guys were co-headlining. So opeth plays first and it was good and then theres these guys. I had never heard of them but i paid good money for my ticket so i figured i'd stick around and see whats what. Wow! The next day i went out and bought In Absentia. This is one moody album. At times upbeat but more often acopolyptic in a despairing kind of way. This album has put a voice to the sound of pent up feelings let out. Its not a rage thing, its simply a sound that wants to be heard. Look no further than .3 or collapse the light into earth. Than theres the haunting tale of gravity eyelids or the bluster of blackest eyes. You cannot go wrong here.
B000067CPX|4.0|By The Way is at the very heart of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band that makes its own music. In this album, the forefront is placed on guitarist John Frusciante, quite frankly one of the greatest guitarists in the history of rock music, let alone today. In the unforgettable Venice Queen, Frusciante blends electric and acoustic guitar to create a colourful and vibrant piece of music. The album begins with the title track, a high-energy that finds Frusciante playing successions of muted frets to compliment bassist Flea's technically proficient Funk bass and Chad Smith's recessive but effective drums. Anthony Kiedis is not brillant in the album, but his vocals are an integral part of what defines the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Strong points in the album include The Zephyr Song, a Beach Boys inspired track that beams optimism, Can't Stop, an extremely catchy song, Throw Away Your Television, a tribal backlash against the media, Venice Queen, and Cabron, a latino-inspired song featured Frusciante on the acoustic guitar.<br />This album incorporates bits of many genres of music, including ska, jazz, blues, along with the 'typical' Peppers sound (funk rock blended with rap with a hint of punk). Along with this comes the dreaded word 'pop'. Are there pop songs on this album, yes. Is pop bad? That's another question. The pop of today is manufactured trash, but there was an era were pop was just as innovative and new as punk, or space rock, or fusion. This album is not Blood, Sugar, Sex, Magik, its also not Calfornication, or Freaky Styley, or Mother's Milk. Its not supposed to be. There's a lot of metaphor in Kiedis's lyrics, him alluding a lot to the bands turmoils and how they rose above it all. Its not as easy to pick out as in an album such as Californication, but that's one of the strengths of By The Way.<br />There was one weak song on the album, I Could Die For You, a overly song attempt at the innovative Porcelain from Californication, and that is my complaint with thealbum. It shouldn't have been on the album, it served no merit to the album's dynamic. <br />One of the top albums of 2002, after 20 years, the Red Hot Chili Peppers continue to lead the venture forth into the vast world of music.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|me against the music... this is extremely accurate as Britney Spears is against everything that REAL music is.  This is the latest in a long string of pop garbage, which also includes such masterworks of shallowness as the N'sync and Christina Aguilera (hey at least she can sing though, but in a show-off was) that has pervaded the music market for the past 5 years.  I like listening to real music performed ny real people.  Britney Spears cannot even sing without &quot;electronic aids&quot;... her voice has to be run through about 13 filters before it even sounds remortely decent.  I go to concerts to see intense bands perform energetic music... not to see a body with no talent other than the ability to poorly shake itself.  If you want real music with real meaning i suggest Coldplay for those who enjoy mellow, properly done music, and if you want music with high energy and a termendous amount of talent i suggest such bands as Smile Empty Soul and Staind.  Avoid this like the plague.
B000002LQR|4.0|Just when the world was settling into the grunge scene, this album turned it all inside-out. Fueled by the funk-driven brilliance of bassist Flea and an emergance of guitar prodigy John Frusciante, the Red Hot Chili Peppers re-defined the early 1990s with this album. Considered by many the Chili's finest work, BSSM is a high-energy ride that combines funk, rock, rap, punk, and Frusciante's unique guitar to form a nearly perfect set of music. Chad Smith provides complimentary drums, though some instances contrasting the bass too much. Anthony Kiedis's vocals are as good as they need to be, as he provides that essential energy that ties it all together. Although some of the lyrics are rather shallow (I'm not referring to Sir Psycho Sexy, that song is a very beautiful song), others are hedonistic and some even insightful.<br />Out of this album came two singles that rocked the mainstream world, Give It Away, and Under The Bridge. Both of these songs are incredible. Other strengths are the beautiful I Could Have Lied (Frusciante's solo is breath-taking, and Kiedis pours emotion into this song), Funky Monks (a testament to the nature of the Western world, later perfected in Californication), My Lovely Man (dedicated to late guitarist Hillel Slovak), Sir Psycho Sexy (shows that funk may actually have a deeper side to it), and Suck My Kiss.<br />There are three weak songs on the album, unfortunately, thus this album doesn't constitute a 5 star rating. If You Have To Ask, The Greeting Song, and They're Red Hot seem rather boring compared to the other songs, and were not necessary to the album.<br />That being said, this album is absolutely essential to music lovers.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|'' It's like a competition me against the beat i wanna get in the zone ''! Yeah,she's in the right zone with a brand new music.The 1st single Me Against the Music feat Madonna will be one of her memoriable experiance with the queen of pop.I love the Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix where there's an india beat in it.My Fav songs in the album are:I got that(boom boom),showdown,shadow,toxic and brave new girl.I think for the next album in future, she will work again with Max Martin with a new kind of music! <br />PS: ''In the zone'' will be at no.1 on the Billboard US 200 Album Sales next week with 500,000 units sale in a week. For Pink fans,she only debuted at no.9,poor girl!
B000002MTR|3.0|Since first listening to this album, it seems like this album consists of a bunch of good songs thrown together to make an okay album. Contrary to what everybody says, there is some chemistry between Dave Navarro and Flea, inconsistent, but a few of the tracks have them playing very well together. Chad Smith's drumming is the most noticeable change in the album, very prevelant, very loud, a result on the influence Navarro had on the band. Anthony Kiedis provides lyrics that are somewhat unmeaningful and rather random in a way. (The intro to Deep Kick, Pea, and My Friends have excellent lyrics.) I believe that Navarro and the other Chilis could've put out a better album than this, he brought a unique and wonderful energy that is heard sometimes, unfortunately, not all of the time.<br />Highlights in the album include the absolutely..warped, Warped a song where Kiedis's voice is synthed in a truly unique way, its quite innovative. Deep Kick has a wonderful feel to it, psychedelic as well. Pea is probably my favourite song on the album, truly I haven't heard anything like it. The rest of the album sounds tried and tested, it doesn't really infringe on many 'limits' of the mainstream music industry, which is what the Chili Peppers are all about, a band that makes its own sound, and not one that follows the standards of the music industry.
B00000293E|5.0|I enjoy the Blues.  This album was one of my first and favorites.  The album presents a few awesome and frustrating points for the listener.  The musicians who accompany Willie are out of this world; my CD came with no credits so I can't name them.  The harp and pianist play to a level beyond belief, and the rest of the cast fall right into place.  These were tight slick sessions.  But the producer who mixed the tracks really missed the mark.  I can only hope that someone will resurrect the original tapes and re issue these tracks in a fresh release.  As for Willie, he's no Howlin Wolf or Muddy Waters but he sings well, these are after all his songs.  If you like the harp and piano, this album gives you one of the best performances ever captured on celluloid.
0385486804|4.0|Being a 9th grade English student, this was a very intriguing book.  It caused me to reflect on my life.  Some people condemned this book because Chris McCandless showed pure stupidity and arrogance by going into the middle of nowhere in Alaska.  He entered with little sustenance, a bag of rice, and a book explaining edible plants and berries of the surrounding area.  He dropped everything he ever knew and started a new life to fulfill his dreams.  Chris gave 25,000 dollars to charity, he abandoned his car and burned all the money in his wallet. Yet people called Chris foolish for fulfilling his dream, but they don't have enough guts to do it themselves. In this book Krakauer also talked about a mountain ascent preformed by a man, the same age and with little preparation.  At the end of this book it became very emotional. This book is not just for the avid lover of the  outdoors.  It is a good book for just about everyone. I would recommend reading this book if you get the chance.
B000002UR7|1.0|I liked the song \\"Creep\\" better when it was called \\"The air that I breathe\\" by the Hollies. No wonder they hate it and won't play it live-- the song that made them so popular is not theirs.      Don't believe me?  Then how do you explain the fact that Albert Hammond and Mike Hazelwood's names are in the publishing credits along with those of the five band members?  Were they feeling generous?    The songs have an almost identical bass line and the verses have the same chord structure and a similiar melody.    Learn a thing or two about music theory.    This band [is not good]
B00005JKED|5.0|Denzel was incredible.  I've always liked him, but he truly startled me in this movie.  &quot;This is chess, it ain't checkers!&quot; his character declares at one point.  <br />Of course, upon repeated viewings, Alonzo comes off as more of a slimebag than urban philosopher.  Note his words on the cell phone upon exiting a house where he has murdered a man in cold blood (&quot;make sure the tub is clean&quot;).  Thus, his entire speech to Hoyt (including the &quot;chess&quot; remark) was entirely two-faced.  He had already arranged Hoyt's murder at that point.  A deleted scene reveals he'd planned to murder Hoyt's wife and child as well, along with burning down Hoyt's house, all to make an example of him.  Of course, this makes me wonder (why didn't he let Dre kill the guy?).<br />I don't know if I like Hoyt, but at least he stood for something when most of us would have folded.  I can almost understand Alonzo's point of view, and that scares me.  I suppose that's the point of the movie, though.  If we had just looked at the philosophy that Alonzo spouted, we could perhaps ride along.  <br />But it's his willingness to murder a fellow officer to keep him &quot;out of the way&quot; that shows us who Alonzo truly is: someone who lives by the street rules of &quot;look out for Number One.&quot;  His loyalty is only to himself and, to a limited degree, the people on his team that are just like him (as long as they assist him and go along with it).  He's not loyal to Hoyt, a fellow officer, to his wife, to his numerous illegitimate children, or to the welfare of others.  I don't know if he saw that girl being attacked by those crackheads, but I do know he felt it was a waste of time and resources to stop to help her.<br />This movie has its heaviest impact in the first viewing, before Alonzo's flaws become apparent enough to discount his vocalized philosophies about the street.  After the first viewing, he looks more and more like a manipulative hypocrite, hard-talkin' but with no loyalty to others.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I hesitated giving this 5 stars, only because as a major Beatles fan, i had actually anticipated that this would be more than what it turned out to be.  So, is it worth the 5 stars?  Of course, it's a Beatles album.  The sound is outstanding.  The elimination of all the overdubs heard on the original record really adds to the songs themselves.  Now, each song is very crisp and every instrument can be heard. I really like the new version of \\"I've Got a Feeling,\\" while I think it is taken from the same tapes as the original album version, the timing is different (not cleaned up) and it adds something special in my opinion.  My disapointment lies in that \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Dig It\\" had been eliminated.  I Guess this is to ensure that every fan will buy both versions of the album, that sucks. When I read about this album coming out, I was excited to finally get a nice clean full-length version of \\"Dig It.\\"  Perhaps this is being saved for another compilation in another couple of years.  Another fault I have with this release is the mysterious inclusion of the \\"Fly on the Wall\\" disc.  I listened through it once to find it was only a collage of random dialogue and song segments.  I would have much preferred to get some full songs here.  There are maybe hundreds of hours of tapes that exist from the \\"get back\\" sessions.  I was really suprised there wasn't more included on this second disk.  I kind of thought that this was a waste of the plastic it was burned on.  Overall, if you are a Beatles fan...Buy this, it's worth it to hear these cleaned up versions, but don't expect anything extra.  It just isn't here. Heck, burn a copy from a friend if you can...on the back cover of the cd there is a \\"friendly\\" warning about copywright laws, that just makes me want to make illegal copies even more (HAHA).  I'd also recommend searching out a few bootlegs from these sessions.  They are fun to listen to, as long as you can ignore the extra tape hiss and the sounds of the film crew. Finally, When can we expect to see the LET IT BE film on DVD??? I have seen the film once, over ten years ago and I think it's about time it is rereleased!!!lly, When can we expect to see the LET IT BE film on DVD???

B0000CEB4V|5.0|AWESOME! There is perhaps no better way to describe this experience. I saw the theatrical release in the theatre and was just blown away by the compassion, by the scencerity and by the shear genius of the group of musicians that came together to celebrate George's life through his music. Now having watched the dvd, I am even more blown away. It is truly an awesome experience. You must get this and you won't regret it.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|Bootleg quality?...2nd disc doesn't work correctly?. I'm sorry for the latter, but for the person who said this is of bootleg quality must be just trying to plant some bad press.This concert DVD captures all the excitment and raw emotion of any dozen or more Springsteen shows I've been to.The quality is so good you feel that you can almost touch Bruce's guitar. This Barcelona crowd is so pumped up that it seems that it's the last show they will ever see. The band delivers, Bruce delivers and this disc delivers a complete Bruce show from beginning to the end of pure Rock n Roll bliss.
0671799320|5.0|I am on my second pass at this book.  I read it about five years ago, but due to recent world events and oil shocks, I decided to read it again.  Even the second time around, I found this book to be so thorough and facinating that I felt compelled to keep reading long after my eyes tired.  This account completely modified my understanding of world history for the past 150 years.  Oil today is central to the world economy, but yet it seems we are remaking many of the mistakes of the past.  The middle east has been and continues to be a remarkable but challenging place to deal with.  Not a day goes by that I don't see some important news story regarding oil or the middle east.  Reading this book has helped me to more clearly understand why many of these important world events are happening.  Oil has had more economic impact on world events than any other invention or commodity, so I feel it is important for people to understand how it has shaped our world.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in the most important commodity &quot;King Oil&quot;.
B0000E1WNV|2.0|The music is great of course and the 1st disc was good.  I concur with many of the other reviews for the music.<br />The manufacturing defect and customer service from SONY is complete crap.  This is unaceptable.  It's obvious they don't care one bit about customer service, otherwise they would do a better job.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|When i first listened to this cd...i will be the first to admit, i didnt like it AT ALL. But after a few listens, i cant put my headphones away. For all of you that thought Britney was too scandalous before, it might be best to keep away from this CD. Its hot, its sexy...It's Britney. How much better does life get?<br />1) Me against the music-(10)-This song has got some crazy beats and it of course features one of the greatest artists of our time. A definite hit!<br />2)(I got the)Boom Boom(9)-This song is going to be a hit at the clubs. Listen to this song before you hit the town, because it makes you wanna get up and dance<br />3)Outrageous(9)-This is another song you could hear at a club. She really lets goes on this song. A great one to workout to...the beats are insane<br />4)Breathe on Me(7)-This one isnt a favorite of mine. Its starting to grow on me little by little. Its a very sexual song, which matches the whole theme of the cd<br />5)Early Mornin'(8)-This song is for any person whose partied the night away, hooked up with some random person, and lived to do it all over again the next night. Definitely an amazing song...It really shows the better side of being hung over :)<br />6)Toxic(10)-This song is by far one of the best...Everything about the beats and the lyrics makes this a top 10 single. A must hear!<br />7)The showdown(10)-If you are ready for a late night hookup, this is your song. Its all about sex and how incredible a \\"showdown\\" between you and your partner can be. Turn this one up loud.<br />8)The touch of my hand(9)-If you like to..well touch yourself, this is your song. Its very sexual and describes how Britney feels when she is all alone...<br />9)The hook up(10)-need i say more? My absolute favorite song of the album. Pop this song in, and turn it up. This song is hot, sexy and steamy. I love absolutley every lyric in it. <br />10)Everytime-(8)-Not a fave of mine...Its more of a subtle Britney, talking about love. I see some true feelingsbeing shown in this song. All in all, a nice ballad.<br />11)Brave new girl(5)-i dont like this song at all. Can we say Madonna imposter?<br />12)Shadow(6)-This song is really different. Its one thats growing on me. Its one of the only 2 slower songs on the cd. It once again talks about love...wonder who shes missing?<br />THIS CD ROCKS! Buy it if you are looking for a good time, whether it be with yourself, your friends or some random guy/girl that you meet at a club.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|There's never been an argument as to whether this record was another milestone in the monumental legacy that the Beatles blessed us with, but the original production has always been questioned - until now.  Stripping Phil Spector's self-indulgent \\"wall of sound\\" makes \\"Let it Be\\" sound like the intimate, revealing record that it was.  Whomever is responsible, thank you.  A beautiful, timeless release - this CD should be under everyone's Christmas tree this season.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I recently bought The Long Road and it is great.  I loved Silver Side Up, despite its not so uplifing lyrics, and this CD is just as good, probably better. There are no bad songs on this CD.  Play it loud and enjoy.  Here's a breakdown of the songs:<br />1. Flat on the Floor: good one to start with, kinda short and confusing, a little hard too<br />2. Do This Anymore: GREAT!!!! Best song by far on the CD. Lyrics great and melody/beat compliments the lyrics. Should be second single.<br />3. Someday: First single good song, but it is overplayed right now, can see similarities b/t it and How You Remind Me<br />4. Believe it or Not: chorus sells this song, dont really like the guitar part, but good song overall<br />5. Fellin' Way too Damn Good: great chill song, love the airport PA thing adds to the mood of the song<br />6. Becasue of You: hated this song at first, but after listening to it more and more it wore on me, a little hard for nickleback, but well done, another great chorus<br />7. Figure You Out: my second favorite great song!!!! Melody reminds me of Woke Up This Morning from Silver Side Up<br />8. Should've Listened: another slower song, chad shows diff. side of his talents in singing this one, very well done<br />9. Throw Yourself Away: good song, but not enough for me, harder than most Nickleback songs, chorus keeps it from being a little under par<br />10. Anotehr Hoel in the Head:  good song, great lyrics and title<br />11. See You at the Show:  my least favorite song, just donesn't have enough<BR>BONUS SONGS<BR>12. Saturday Night's Alrigth (For Fighting): not too great cover of the original, leave that one to Elton John<br />13. Yanking out my Heart: good song, good melody and beat, best of the bonus songs<br />14. Learn teh Hard Way: a little hard, faded voice thing not working
B000002BQK|5.0|It's true, eh? I loved this CD. There were no fillers or boring funeral ballad-like tracks from her previous CD, Fantasy. I didn't have to skip any songs....what a first!<br />After this CD, everything just went up and down for her. \\"Rainbow\\" was just horrible....a few good tracks, yes, but most were hard on the ears. \\"Glitter\\" was good, no one liked it thought, due to the first single, Loverboy, but it has some amazing ballads on there. \\"Charmbracelet\\" had it's moments, but also it's misses.<br />So anyways, this is her very best. I know, I have all her CD's. On here, tracks produced by Puffy, Poke and Tone, Corey Rooney (better known for work with J-LO cause she stole him from Carey, LOL) and of course Walter A. who does all her slow songs.<br />A+!
B00005JMFO|4.0|If you're on the fence about seeing 'Love Actually,' perhaps you're not aware of the pedigree of writer/director Richard Curtis.  He's been the guiding hand - in one way or another - behind a remarkable string of movies...Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary (and the upcoming sequel to that).  Plus, as long-time collaborator with Rowan Atkinson (the various incarnations of 'Mr. Bean' on small- and big-screens), the guy knows how to stage physcial comedy.<br />So, it's no surprise that 'Love Actually' is (mostly) a triumph.  There's a lot going on here; some of the stories are stronger than others, most notably the tale of married couple Alan Rickman (fantastic here) and Emma Thompson (who is looking more and more like Hillary Clinton with each passing day).  There's a brilliant bit of serious acting here by Thompson locked away by herself in her bedroom.  Grade A stuff.<br />From a comedic standpoint, the movie is absolutely stolen by the incredibly gifted Bill Nighy as 'wrinkled rocker' Billy Mack.  If you've never seen Nighy do his schtick (check out his over-the-top performance in \\"Still Crazy\\"), you're in for a real treat.  Plus, his holiday rendition of \\"Love Is All Around\\" sets the tone of the movie from the opening scene.  It pops up over and over and never wears thin.<br />Hugh Grant is the surprise here as a Blair-like British PM (without the Cheri).  I know he can do the serious stuff.  Check out his sublime performance in 'About a Boy' - the bumbling, stuttering Grant persona is nowhere to be found.  The eye-openers here are twofold:<br />First, Grant was quoted during \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" that he \\"doesn't do physical comedy,\\" and would leave that to 'Two Weeks' co-star Sandra Bullock (the best physical comedienne in film today).  However, here he is shaking his booty through the halls of No. 10 Downing St. to the Pointer Sisters' \\"Jump.\\"  It's quite good stuff.  Grant has sold himself short all these years.<br />Second, there's this one bit of politicking that Curtis slides into the movie.  Grant meets with the US President (Billy Bob Thornton is a stellar cameo in which he oligeneously combines the worst qualities of Bush and Clinton).  Expected to parrot the U.S. line in a press conference, Grant ferociously blurts out a statement of independence.  Curtis' less the veiled intent here:  \\"Message to Tony Blair; don't be anyone's poodle any longer.\\"  Frankly, the only way this scene works is via Grant's ability to deliver those lines and have it seem credible.  He does that.  You never doubt him for an instant.  For anyone with an interest in the U.S.-Britain 'special relationship,' this scene alone makes 'Love Actually' worth checking out.  It'll spark hours of conversation.his one bit of politicking that Curtis slides into the movie.

076790592X|3.0|Reading this book brought tears to my eyes and watching the movie flooded them more. I felt melancholic about my own life, seeing myself in Mitch's shoes before the reunion with his favorite teacher, Morrie; always hurrying against time, meeting his goals,aspirations &amp; successes at work and thinking that his quick and fast snatching loving moments with Janine should be fulfilling enough for both of them. From Morrie and his generous sharing of his life experiences from childhood in poverty and deprivation through fulfilling adulthood and then the finale physically debilitating but enriching emotional and mental closure through impending death, he evaluates the true values of life that should bring meaning to all of us. This is a moving story of life's lessons learnt : to be generous in showing and sharing love before it is too late, in being forgiving to ourselves &amp; others to find peace within us,  in  balancing time for all that matters most, in reminding ourselves the responsibility to give to the community &amp; not just career, in being kind to ourselves to grieve and cry to wash away our pain and create rainbows in our hearts and never to make excuses for things that do not appear to be right and wonderful. Morie has &quot;early morning moments&quot; to cry which he gives himself the time but not for long, just enough to wash away the pain and move on to celebrate the joy of living. He values the time ALS allows him to share his impending death in dignity with the public and enjoy a living funeral. This lesson on time persuades Mitch to cast away his cellphone to give his time for the 2 people he loves and asserts his right not to be enslaved to this world's pursuits of fame, glory &amp; money. Through Morrie, he reevaluates his life's priorities &amp; rediscovers that life offers choices which hunger doesn't,as Morrie says. Through Morrie and Mitch, I now think of my mother and the reconnection I have to make, the love I have to show and the time I have to give. Morrie regrets not forgiving himself for the resentment towards his father's indifference &amp; not forgiving his father for the love that he did not show. I felt the same and must do the same. Thank you, Mitch Albom for giving me this chance to learn my life's lessons and a post-humous kudos to Morrie for the courage, wisdom and dignity I learnt.
B0000E1WNV|5.0|What you have to do is turn it up really loud, I mean so loud that when you clear your throat you can't hear yourself.  Then close your eyes and I'd swear you think Bruce and the Band is right in front of you playing there hearts out.  Buy it.  It's incredible.

B0000TB03W|5.0|I loved this DVD!  there is a lot more footage and more songs than the TV special!! I relived it all over again!!  I even found all of my newFan Club friends and I in it!! Excellent Buy!!  Go and Get it!!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|This release is a \\"must have\\" for Beatle fans and music historians and the material is unquestionably more interesting stripped of its Spectorisms. However, I doubt they would have been satisfied to release it quite like this, perfectionists that they were. Some of the cuts are big improvements. The Long and Winding Road, Let It Be, Across the Universe and I,Me Mine. Others are pretty much the same...Two of Us, Dig a Pony, Get Back.  I think Don't Let Me Down is a perfect fit for this collection. Yet, with that said and recognizing fully that the boys wanted to make a no frills record, it all seems to have an unfinished feel to it. Alot of the cuts seem like very well rehearsed demos. The acoustic guitars on I, Me Mine are gorgeous and the quiet simplicity of Across the Universe is breathtaking (listen for the entrancing drone of the Indian instrument deep in the mix...I never heard that before). Paul's voice on Let It Be is crystal clear and emotional. I was a little disappointed in the guitar solo there, I always preferred the contrast provided by George's growling, distorted solo on the original album version to the more tame solo found here. Although the Fly on the Wall disc is a nice touch, a disc of the oldies through which the band romped through during these sessions would have been better appreciated here.  Bottom line...as with any Beatles material, turn off the computer and run out to get it.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Wow!  This DVD is awesome!  The concert is great and you really get to see the real side of Shania Twain in the interviews.  She sings all of her great songs and some from her new album.  Shania is so energetic on stage that I just had to turn up the DVD and sing along!
B00008PX8P|5.0|After seeing the new Zep dvd, I would rate the top  5 as follows:<br /> 1. Going to California- from the new dvd. (really Magical)<BR> 2. Rock and Roll-from the &quot;song remains the same&quot; dvd.<BR> 3. The Song Remains the Same/Rain Song- from the &quot;srts&quot; dvd.<BR> 4.

B00005JM02|5.0|\\"Finding Nemo is one of the year's best films,\\" explains Joel Siegel form Good Morning America. \\"Hugely entertaining and way cool,\\" says Peter Travers of Rolling Stone. Finding Nemo is being compared to the Lion King and it is ranking up with the movie also. Finding Nemo is a family movie that everyone in the family can relate to. <BR>When you watch Finding Nemo you can't help but get into the movie. When I first started to watch the movie it was not what I had expected to see. With all of the hype about the movie I thought it was going to be like the Lion King and start off like that, but it does not. Instead the movie starts off with Nemo at home and showing how he lives. <BR>After watching the movie I found that this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. It has all of the elements that a great movie has. I think that a great movie has all of the emotions that people feel with in a day. Excitement, scared, sad, happy, and all of the other feeling that are out there are in this movie and you do not realize that they are there but they are. <BR>I love how you can feel what Marlin (Nemo's dad) feels when Nemo gets taken from his home. With the music that plays and the looks on the faces of the characters all makes you feel so sad that Nemo is taken away from his home.  Through out the whole movie it plays with your emotions with all of the different interactions with animals that you would think would not get along help each other out. <BR>With all of that said I would most defiantly recommend this to people.  At first I was hesitant of the movie but by the end I loved it. I would most defiantly recommend this movie to people. Not only is this one of the best movies that Disney has done but also with all of the extras that come on the DVD it is worth the money to buy this movie.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok I started out a hater of Avril Lavigne, they played Complicated to DEATH here. But, despite my better judgement, I listened to this album cuz my friend gave it to me as a gift, begging me to listen. So, bleh, I went into my room, popped it in and listened. And, HOLY BEGEEBUS, I love it! Losing my Grip is one of my FAVORITE songs now. So now, when people diss Avril just for being mainstream and popular, I have to say - Give her a CHANCE. ;)
076790592X|5.0|This book contains a wonderful story that everyone can relate to.  It is true to life and each person can take away valuable life lessons.  Morrie was a truly inspirational mentor to Mitch.  It was very emotionally rewarding to see how Morrie was able to touch Mitch's life during the end of his own.  This relationship is a great example of why all people should slow down and spend more time with those they care about.  Life is full of obligations and responsibilities, but in the end, it is the memories that we make with others that will sustain us.  Morrie and Mitch were able to reconnect and both of them reaped the rewards of the relationship.  Morrie was able to generously impart the wisdom of his own life experiences, thus gaining closure on his own life by touching another's.  Mitch had the opportunity to reap the rewards of Morrie's sage advice and life lessons.  This book is one of the most inspirational and touching stories that I have ever read and I feel that this book has, in some small way, made me a better person.
076790592X|3.0|This is a book about a man named Mitch who befriends his old college professor.  The Proffessor, Morrie Schwartz, is stricken with ALS.  When Mitch hears about his old proffessors situation, he goes to visit him this visit begins a weekly schedule where mitch visits with Morrie every tuesday.  As he visis go on everytime Mitch sees Morrie he is weaker.  Morrie is a very wise man and before his time comes he shares his advice with everyone.  Mitch learns more about himself and becomes a better person.  Their relationsip gets stronger and stronger. In overall this is a good book.  At times it can loose you but for the most part it is a good read, with a positive look at the kindness of human beings.
B0000E1WNV|4.0|As with most recent Springsteen products, the quality control seems to have gone out the window.  The special features simply don't work on a lot of DVD players, and you must order a &quot;replacement&quot; disc, to be sent to you only after you return the defective disks.  Just as the liner notes for Tracks and Essential were chock full of erros and typos, so too does this leave a lot to be desired.  If you can get it to work, however, it's a great show.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Absolutely the best concert film you'll ever see. Watching the musicians give their best makes you understand the love they had for George. Somewhere in the interviews someone says they rehearsed three weeks for this concert...I don't know of any other man, politician, president, or athlete that their friends would put aside three weeks to pay tribute. Absolutely a stunning performance on DVD... I too dreaded the Indian music segment (having seen George on tour in the 1970's) ... that is before I saw it ... absolutely some of the most touching powerful music I have ever heard and I have been a player and listener for a long time. Thanks Ravi - we should all be lucky enough to have a friend compose such a beautiful musical work for us. Someone needs to get an award for this DVD!!!! Now everyone go buy a ukelele and keep George in your heart.... a great artist and man. Watching the interaction between Dhani and the other musicians, should father George be watching down... he can feel confident that his son will be guided through life by his loving friends.
B0000DJE9R|3.0|First off, all of these singles were not #1 hits so the title is misleading. Some were: &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Bad&quot;, &quot;Black or White&quot;, etc. Some were not: &quot;Thriller&quot;, &quot;You Rock My World&quot;, &quot;Smooth criminal.<br />In the 80's, Michael Jackson recorded some incredible music that was really cool and innovative at the time. His singles are still cool, but have grown kinda tired over time as classics sometimes do. But by the early 90's Michael was really starting to change and now he seems like a completely different person and with the exception of &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot;, his music after the &quot;Dangerous&quot; album just falls flat. This collection really was not needed at all. His &quot;History&quot; album or &quot;Vol. 1 Greatest Hits&quot; are completely suitable collections. This does include his new song &quot;One More Chance&quot; .... Still, there were already collections avaliable and this really doesn't offer much.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This cd is her Best cd yet. It's a great dance cd and its not that POP. I LOVE Breathe On Me.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|So here we are...another Britney release. As usual, you basicly only get two types of reviews on here. Either \\"OMG! Like, I love Britney! She's the best!\\" Or the infamous, \\"I hate Britney! I wish she'd die! If you buy this u are stupid!\\" People need to get a life. But anyways, if you have actually tracked Britney's work over her four albums, this album does show a significant growth. \\"Britney\\" was good and a change of pace from \\"Oops\\", but it lacked catchy songs. \\"In the Zone\\" makes up for that. <br />\\"Me Against the Music\\" is a fun collaboration with Madonna. I was uncertain of it the first time I heard it, but after a few listens, I love it. Two icons in one song. \\"How would you like a friendly competition? Just take on the zone!\\" \\"Boom Boom\\" is a catchy piece of funk and I love the littel banjo sample. I could see this as a single. \\"Breathe On Me\\" is very Kylie Minogue-ish but that isn't at all bad. I'd love for this to be a single cuz it's a great song.\\"Toxic\\" is catchy as hell. The instrumentation is fun and funky. Yet again, this would make a great single. The R Kelly penned \\"Outrageous\\" doesn't really compare to some of the other tracks, but it does have a hot beat. \\"Touch of My Hand\\" is a song I can see getting parents upset. In the 80's, Cyndi Lauper did it with \\"She-bop\\" and in the 90's the Divynls did it with \\"Touch Myself\\" and now Britney comes to us with a new female ode to self love. Despite the meaning, the Middle Eastren feel is really cool and its actually a very pleasing track *no pun intended!!!!* \\"Shadow\\" is a sort of mid-tempo-ish ballad and is a pretty decent track. \\"Brave New Girl\\" is upbeat and danceable kinda mirroring on something that might have been on the \\"Oops\\" album. BUT, even though I love \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Toxic\\", and \\"Touch of My Hand\\", my favorite track has to be \\"Everytime.\\" Now Britney's ballads have never been her strong suit due to her lack of vocal power, but this a gorgeous track. I love the chorus and would love to see it asa single. Then the album closes with a jamming remix of \\"Me Against the Music.\\"<br />Yes, Britney is not that great of a singer. Yes, she tends to lip sync live *much to my disapproval*, but her recorded music is awesome. The girl can entertain, and on \\"In the Zone\\" flexes her writing muscles. It comes off as a very good album. Warning to parents: there are a lot of sexual themes, so it might not be the best gift for young children. Britney has grown up. And as for you people that have and will get on here and voice your hatred of Britney without even listening to the album...get a life. Do something more constructive with your time. Knit a sweater. :)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This disk is full of hot dance hits that you can really move to. It is a great cd to work out to. There isn't a song with out a beat. For all of you who are looking for a hot album this is it. She isn't comparable to anyone else, she's got her own thing going let's let her be.
B0000DJE9R|5.0|I think that these songs are truly great and the CD provides a homogeneous mix. The new song, One More Chance, is really deep and you can sense that he really wants to bring himself back up. You gotta love Michael for his music, ... he is truly the greatest and i think, as a great fan, this CD is BOMB.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|After years of being the sugar pop mainstream princess Britney finally finds her groove. In The Zone is a dreamscape of trancy club songs that are perfect for dancing or escaping the madness. The album has an excellent flow and despite the apolegetic ballad to Justin &quot;Everytime&quot; the album is completly dancable( No skips I promise). Standout songs include: Toxic, Outrageous, Breathe on Me and the controversial Touch of my Hand (Girls need satisfaction too!)In The Zone is seriously a must have if you want to have a good time and get it on!
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This album is very congruent and has many positive aspects.  The addition of Don't Let Me Down adds so much stregnth to this already impressive track list.  Another change is heard in The Long and Winding Road.  The track has a more Beatlesque feel without the symphony.  Whether or not this is how the album was truly intended to be or just a McCartney \\"remake\\" the album is remarkable.  It does not take away the fact that you must own the orginal but is a great addition to a Beatles collection.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|First of all I would like to point for those who quite rightly did not like the director's cut, that included in this DVD is the original concert (minus the interviews) untouched by Adrian Maben totally unnecessary new indulgence.<BR>Pink Floyd Live At Pompeii is probably one of the best music documentaries ever filmed, and captures perfectly the essence of the band, from choosing a location that fits the music and the mood of Pink Floyd so well,to deciding not to have any audience:the emptiness,silence and morbid history of Pompeii with its live volcanos add an invaluable depth (Echoes!) to the songs. Moreover,to watch the interviews, rehearsals and samples from the studio,recording Dark Side of The Moon,is to witness an unpretentious and raw creativity at work.<BR>The film also offers an early indication and insight on the condition of the band, and the inevitable break up years later that was in a way waiting to happen. With all PF members admitting to a friction that resulted in many fights back in '71, and with Roger Waters obvious controlling and imposing attitude,it is surprising the band survived until The Final Cut!<BR>The selection of the tracks is very good indeed, getting to hear again the 'forgotten' Floyd repertoire. The term 'Mind Trip' and 'Masterpiece' are overused these days, but one should really listen and as equally vital watch Pink Floyd to really understand what these terms mean!! To listen to Careful with that Axe Eugene, Set The Controls for The Heart of the Sun and the epic Echoes  is to be taken on a mind trip like no other music manages to take you in the true sense of the word(strangely and sadly these songs are very much omitted from Gilmour and Waters concerts-it would make a very interesting listen to hear them again using modern production/or with a new interpretation).<BR>I also loved Maben's emphasis on Nick Mason's play, (in my opinion with Kansas's Phil Ehart and Eloy's Fritz Randow, the best drummer in rock, in all its genres).You will simply look in sheer amazement at this wonderful artist 'playing his heart out'.<BR>Now to the Director's cut.<BR>To be honest it was a total futile and strange exercise. In some parts I cringed at the new shots inserted! especially the Koyanisqaatsi influenced space rocket in first part of Echoes..the musuem shots of statues, or worst of all the virtual reconstruction of the Pompeii temples in the second part of Echoes!! It is bewildering!! Why would the very same man who conceived and directed the original film would want to tamper with it in such a cheap way?  I can not start to imagine! <BR>Nevertheless, since the original concert is included, with little nice extras as well, and since it is Pink Floyd with their ethereal and timeless music, (hence my 5 stars) this DVD should at no account be missed.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater, and I couldn't wait for this edition to come out. It was a long wait, but well worth it! What the film makers have done is a take a great film and made it BETTER! Great, in fact. With an addition 43 min. worth of film what we get is more character development, more explainations into major plot points, and old characters doing new things! More Gollum, more Treebeard, more Faramir, and more of the Fellowship's journey. Simply Amazing! Also the bonus material is well worth your time! It is amazing to see the care, sweat, and tears that the film makers put into these films. <BR>GO OUT AND BUY THIS NOW! If you are a fan of the series, GET IT NOW! If you are not, do yourself a favor, get this and the Fellowship of the Ring: Expanded Edition as well! You'll get two wonderful films that are truly epic in size!<BR>Bring on RETURN OF THE KING!!!<BR>(GIFT PACK INFO: This comes with a great little statue of Gollum, an additional disc on the making of this statue, and a little booklet about Gollum. It is well worth the extra money, as the statue makes a great display piece.)
B00005JM09|2.0|I have to say that after waiting for many years for the third installment of the Terminator series, that this movie was a big disappointment.  The acting was marginal and the characters didn't even seem likable.  Claire Danes was very annoying throughout the movie, and I think they could have picked someone better.  Arnold did good, but I really didn't care for Terminator X.  She was just plain boring.  Nothing really stuck out in the movie.  I hated how the movie ended only because I felt like nothing was accomplished from the beginning to the end.  This one was a big let down.
6305558167|5.0|OH, yes indeeed - this is one for all ages, beautifully cast, costumed, photographed, etc. etc. etc.<br />FASCINATING TO WATCH after two decades is it?  [and we make such a fuss over the current &quot;Ring Cycle&quot;]  This one's also pre-CGI - and such splendor.<br />New faces of that time include Gabriel Byrne and Liam Neeson - but it's the brilliance of Nicol Williamson and Merlin and Helen Mirren as Morgana that impress and continue to impress.<br />A rare treat for myth lovers!<br />[Great 'repeat' shots - the Lady of the Lake vs Mr. Boorman's shotgun holding hand in 'Deliverance' and for more fun there's always ZARDOZ!]
B000002ADT|5.0|I hear this album almost every day and I never get tired of it. I listen to it when I'm in the computer, working, web-surfing, whatever. This is one of those masterpieces that will be around for ever, no matter if the album is now more than 40 years old. Even in the year 2050 or 2500, this album will still be heard by many people around the world. Also if you are a newcomer to the music of Miles Davis, I think this is a good album to start with. I have showed Kind Of Blue to some friends who know nothing about Jazz or Miles Davis and they really liked it.<BR>BUY THIS ALBUM
B0000691U1|5.0|This is one of the truly great albums, an album that epitomizes the great preoccupations of jazz--the breaking down and building back up, the fighting between the old and new schools. It is also more evidence of the Duke's continued reign as undisputed champ of music in America; he was willing to do anything, go anywhere. And so he followed Mingus and Max Roach into their world, and what may have turned into a sort of gang initiation for any other musician becomes an all-out musical brawl, a record that is hard-driving and forceful and unpolished but still beautiful. It's not surprising that Mingus, in the presence of Ellington, plays as well as he ever has. No matter how far Mingus reached, no matter how experimental he got, he came from Duke, and worshipped Duke (even though he was the only man Duke had ever fired), and this anxiety is palpable all through this record. And Duke? What can one say... In addition to being a wonderful soul, he was a very smart man, and knew quite well that he was not Bud Powell or Oscar Peterson, and he doesn't try to be, he doesn't need to be. He didn't sign up with Mingus and Roach for a gag, to dip his toes cautiously and quickly into the bebop waters. He wanted--like all great artists--to challenge and to be challenged. So it is not terribly surprising that he sounds at times like Thelonious (another who was deeply touched by Duke)--angular, sparse, very rhythmic.  This is above all else a confrontation of styles and ideas and personalities. It is musical interplay at its most complex because it plays off of what we know and what we expect from these musicians, reaching and eventually exceeding those expectations.

B0000AMRJC|4.0|HIGHLIGHTS: Al Pacino's exaggerated full-throttle no-holding-back performance; Steven Bauer as his friend sizzles on the screen; cinematography; Oliver Stone's ever-quotable script; certain scenes startle with their intensity.<br />LOWPOINTS: Giorgio Moroder's score; overdramatized at times; lacks consistent structure; gratuitously violent; Michelle Pfeiffer's acting; overlong.<br />CONCLUSION: One of the most influential films ever made, 'Scarface' failed both critically and at the box-office when it came out due to its three-hour length, Giorgio Moroder's straightforward synthesizer score and the ambiguous protagonist, Tony Montana. Not sure whether to root for him or loathe him, audiences failed to recognize a hero in the scarred face of Al Pacino, whose overall flaming performance was deemed offensive - Montana only wanter the cream of the crop, and nothing would stop him . Similar to 'Blade Runner', which also failed at its premiere and only now is considered classic due to its influences, 'Scarface' was later established as one of the most powerful gangster epics. <BR> Brian DePalma ALWAYS exaggerates - it is the director's auterish touch that he inserts into his films to emphasize the action. While the film IS slightly off-putting in its structure (it lingers too long on unnecessary periods of Tony's life and skips significant ones, like his rise to success), and the Moroder score, along with Pfeiffer's uncertain amateurish performance, plainly suck, it is the palpable invigoration of the director at his peak in each scene that makes 'Scarface' a true classic. The violence IS excessive, but all is forgiven, because Pacino's forceful acting accomodates DePalma's style smoothly. Montana is all raw nerve. It is scarier to watch him snap at his friend, played impeccably by Steven Bauer, when Montana's sexually-charged obsession with his sister is challenged. <BR> Uncompromising, elusive, offensive, 'Scarface' has become the landmark for the majority of rappers, including the likes of Method Man, Guru and,um, Scarface. Pacino's character is now a cult figure, cherished amongst the hip-hop community. The reason is clear: Montana's brutality, ambition and arrogance allowed him, a Cuban immigrant, rise to apocalyptic success. Rap artists mostly come from ghettos and projects, so they can sympathize with that strive, they know how it is. For an average viewer the film's brutality (amazingly stretched out in the controversial chainsaw scene) might be too much. Otherwise, 'Scarface' is a masterpiece of bad movies that re-triggered Oliver Stone's career, showcased De Palma's stylistic trends, shocked and provoked with its acting and amounts of gore, and inspired a generation of music and film.<br />SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: Gangsta No1; Carrie; Donnie Brasco; Bugsy; Bad Lieutenant; Carlito's Way; Dead Presidents.<BR><BR><BR>DON'T SEE THIS IF YOU LIKED: A Walk to Remember; Bugsy Malone; Hudson Hawk; Empire
0385486804|4.0|A book review for Into the Wild<br />Starting a new life is something that just about everyone has thought of, but not many actually peruse it.  The real question is how many people in the world are following their dreams to happiness?  A true story about one particular man by the name of Christopher McCandless is one that leaves many pondering.  He left his life in search for a new one although his new life is not one that many who chose it seems to be the way he wants to live.  He kept journal entries about his journey through his new life even though his journey was not one of discovery and glory.  Also most of these stories have a happy ending, this one did not because all they found left of Chris was his decomposed body.  Jon Krakauer wrote about Christopher's journey and in the book Into the Wild.  It started me at the edge of my seat and left me with some amazing thoughts.  This is a book that I recommend too and one not just as a book but a way to look at life in a whole other state of mind.  It makes you feel like taking a journey with Christopher McCandless and actually being there beside him, feeling and understanding the amazing things he went through.  I give this book four stars it was not the best book I ever read but it was very good.  The only parts that bothered me were that it commonly went off the subject and told parts of the story that were not really relevant.  <BR> The book definitely had its flaws. Krakauer is the narrator for the story and he seems to fill gaps in the story with meaningless other short stories from people that had met him.  There were some parts in the book that I felt were just not very important.  The author wrote a lot about the people that McCandless met or worked for during his journey to the life he dreamed for himself.  I felt that the author spent too much time talking about the people he met and worked for and the author talked about their lives and their family.  It wasted a lot of time and I feel that it didn't need to be told as through or with as much detail as the author did.  It would have been better if the narrator talked more about Chris than the others around him at the time.  Also it bothered me that the author did not really have a clear reason for why Chris left his life for a new one.  Especially when the life he had was blooming.<BR> I rated this book with four stars because I felt it was an extremely intense book, which kept me at the edge of my seat.  It did this through the majority of the book by constantly rising and dropping the level of intensity.  I liked it because I could relate to it but at the same time I could not understand what Chris was physically feeling and going through.  On the other hand I related to this book because I understood his feelings of wanting to give up everything to start over.  The book gave me a new look at life through someone else's eyes and through my own, mostly because it was a true story and it did not have a happy ending.  I also think the book having a unhappy ending gave it a twist of reality because some time life does not always end up the way we want it to.  <BR> I would recommend this book to just about anyone over the age of fifteen.  Also to people who like mystery, suspense, and thrillers books, and this is a true story.  This book helps you see life and relive it through Chris McCandless's eyes. If you want to know the real life true story about Chris McCandless then this is a book for anyone.  I think others will enjoy this book as much as I did because it tells the true story about a man who died fulfilling his dream.<BR> Over all, the book Into the Wild was a book that touched me.  I feel that it could do the same for anyone that reads it.  It was not the greatest book that I have read, but it defiantly gave me a new way to look at life and not take it for granted.   No matter how bad life might be, the grass is not always greener in a new life.  It is a shame that Chris McCandless had to find that out thehard way.

B00004T9UF|1.0|I bought this to listen to because i'd heard that this cd was being hailed as an artistic masterpiecce by a genius, and that the cd was hyped up to almost Godlike proportions. I never want to hear this again. Eminem's main goal is to deliberately shock by putting in tons of swear words and writing songs about murdering or hurting his girlfriend/wife/ex-wife Kim, whatever she is to him now. The only good track is Stan, because it had a good story to tell. The song where he's literally screaming his head off at Kim and then strangles her is probably the most hateful piece of junk i've ever heard. He comes off as a whiny, immature child who has anger management problems and also issues with his Mom. Eminem needs to spend his money on serious time on the psychiatrist's couch and not on making  more cds to torture us with. This cd makes him come off as very self-aborbed. He needs to get on with his life and stop putting out songs where he's angry at the world, the critics, his mom, Kim, and blaming everyone but himself. And any artist who puts down another artist in a song is very pathetic. What's even more shocking is the fact that kids under 17, especially VERY young kids who are probably 6 or 7, will be listening to this cd and worshipping Eminem. This cd is NOT suitable for anyone under the age of 17, i don't care what anyone says. Videos and pop radio stations may be geared at the youth of today, and Eminem may be targeted for a youthful audience due to marketing, but that doesn't mean a lot of his material is appropriate for really young kidlets to hear. Of course Eminem would disagree with everything i've said in this review, but i frankly don't care. It really disturbs me that kids under ten listen to music with a lot of swearing and disrespectful language and subject material.  I seriously hope Eminem is a fad. I really can't see him having any long lasting appeal. Just because MTV tells us something is cool to listen to because they shove it down our throats doesn't necessarily mean it's good stuff you're hearing. This cd is not the stuff we should be awarding tons of Grammy awards to. There are so many more talented artists out there more deserving. Not buying his cds is the smartest thing you can do this year, or any year for that matter. Don't buy into the hype, people. Use your brain and listen to real music with lasting appeal, not the crap novelty of the moment.
B00008YLV2|5.0|EXCELLENT.  TEACHES MANY LESSONS ABOUT OUR MILITARY AND ALL OF THE RED TAPE INVOLVED.    IT EXPOSES THE AMERICAN MILITARY DOWN TO AN ORDINARY MILITARY FORCE (WHICH IT IS)    EVERY US PRESIDENT NEEDS TO SEE THIS DVD BEFORE SENDING MORE OF OUR TROOPS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD IN MY OPINION..
B000007MVD|5.0|I didn't intend to write a review of this CD, but I was just rifling through the Beatles catalog and noticed that this was way toward the bottom, which meant that, in terms of sales rank, that's also where is was.  To think that more people are buying the Anthology series than this is a damn shame.  <br />I guess it's easy to overlook this CD. It came out before all the hype over the anthology, and had been cut out by that time.  Also, for some reason, many regard the Beatles' early recordings (before Rubber Soul and Revolver) as dismissable.<br />Boy, are they missing out!  Music does not have to impart a profound (or pretentious, depending on how you look at it) message in the lyrics to be profound.  Just listen to Lennon's reading of Baby It's You on this collection and you'll know what I mean.<br />Maybe it's just a matter of perspective. Maybe younger fans just aren't looking for that niave rush that these guys generated with these songs.  Maybe they need to feel that they are finding &quot;the word&quot;.  If so, they probably will find this album &quot;kid stuff&quot;.  But, believe me, it's not.  In most cases, they lend more grace, excitement and musicainship to these songs than the original artists did, and in some cases that's no mean feat.  Plus, they had impeccable taste in the songs they chose to cover.  This CD is more than an historical document; much, much more.  These are great songs, all given the Beatle touch, at a time when the Beatles were still hungry and at a performing peak. That would soon change.<br />But, this CD is relatively overlooked.  I shouldn't be surprised, because Please, Please Me, With The Beatles and most disappointing, Hard Day's Night are also bringing up the rear in sales.  That's a shame, because those CDs, like this one, contain the finest examples of early 60s music that exist, and, believe me, that is really saying something.<br />This is a classic record.  It contains not only textbook examples of what made the Beatlesgreat musically, but also some of the banter and humor that made them such cultural icons.  The banter and the humor, like the music, stands up to repeated listening.  If the Beatles music has moved you, and you haven't heard this CD, you should do yourself a favor and see what all the fuss was about.
0156027321|3.0|The book is well written, concise and with a lot of<br />vivid details. What I actually like most is the first<br />92 pages of the book, which took place in normal human<br />society, instead of later the survival and gruelsome<br />killing environment on the sea. From the child's eye,<br />this book gives interesting account of zoo animals,<br />their behavior and their relationship with humans. It<br />took away a lot of illusions about wild animals, which<br />are portrayed as cute and &quot;free&quot; and in the wild<br />world. I like the author's frankness in his<br />observation of animal nature, and sometimes human<br />nature.<br />However, I deeply dislike the violent account of the<br />stories in the end, and the description of all those<br />gruesome details. I don't think a &quot;realistic&quot; story<br />has to recount those violent details. It's like a war<br />movie does not have to show us all those blood. I have<br />no objection to the believability of that second story<br />(in fact it is truer than the first one, with<br />animals). But I am appalled by the author's indulgence<br />with those violent description, and felt violated as a<br />human being. Some people said they hate &quot;The Blue<br />Velvet&quot; (movie) because a woman was raped on the<br />screen, which make them feel personally violated. I<br />have the same feeling with the second story of this<br />book.<br />In the end, I don't feel I &quot;learned&quot; that much from<br />this book. To me, it's dark survival story, and a<br />crying of a lonely human soul. It's revelation of<br />trauma that has not been healed. It does not leave me<br />with uplifing spirit after reading this book, which<br />was what I got from books by Tolstoy such as &quot;War and<br />peace&quot;. The value of a book that carries spirit of<br />humanity is showing the triumph of human courage and<br />kindness, not carnage and violence. Jack London has<br />many stories on survival in the nature, but how<br />uplifting they are. Even his story of that man with a<br />wolfe, it leaves with hope and admiration in the end.<br />To me, this is the key difference between a great novelist<br />and a small one who caters to low tastes.<BR>wolfe, it leaves with hope and admiration in the end.<BR>To me, this is the key difference between a great novelist<BR>and a small one who caters to low tastes.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban's new CD, Closer, is AMAZING!!!  Everytime I listen to it, I am transcended by his gorgeous baritone voice!  Being a singer myself, I notice more than the fact that his voice is clear and smooth.  His diction on the Italian and French songs is impeccable.  I can hardly believe that he is only 22!  And Josh did more than just sing on this album.  He also co-wrote a couple of the songs and played piano as well.  What a talented guy!  I hope he's around for a long time!
B0000AMA6E|5.0|for spanish purpose info.  The Platinum Editon series 1st Snow White, 2nd Beauty and the beast, and this year Lion King have all had a second edition made in Spanish. So you will only get French choices on the English version.  This seems only to be with the Platinum ediitions Monster's Inc.  Others such as Sleeping beauty and Finding Nemo seem to have boyth English and spanish in ine set. I don't know why they choose these technical details,  but for my Aunt who wants to teach her daughter Spanish, I did some research as to what titles were accible in Spanish.  Most of them are produced in Spanish in VHS and easier to find, such as Alice in Wonderlad, Tarzan, etc. Please emai me if I can help find you a disney spanish title.
B00004U45G|5.0|Fans of Led Zeppelin or fans of The Black Crowes, and certainly those who are fans of both, should buy this album immediately. I understand the fear... I had it, too. Who could ever top Zeppelin? Who could possibly do justice to the canon in cover form? And in the &quot;modern&quot; era, what would happen if the incredible saviors-of-rock Crowes were to try to recreate something as mythological as Led Zeppelin that had at the same time been dead for thirty years?<br />And so... I avoided this release for two full years.<br />It was finally hearing the live version of Ten Years Gone on a friend's sound system that did it for me. After spending more than a few minutes to collect myself (and playing the track again... and again... and again), I knew that my next purchase would be Live at the Greek.<br />Not to worry, your fears (as were mine) are unfounded; you won't be upset by thin, embarrassing Zeppelin covers, nor will you find The Black Crowes struggling to be Celtic gods and coming off as pretentious as you've always known they weren't. What you will be is STUNNED at how incredible, how fresh, and how thick all of these classics sound.<br />In fact, Chris Robinson's voice brings a whole new depth to some of the songs. What Is and What Should Never Be is made anew, earthy and worldly. Ten Years Gone, while still a heartbreaking tune, also becomes a deeper lament, with more soul than the studio Zeppelin version. In My Time of Dying becomes dirtier, harder, more challenging. Even Yardbirds tracks like Shape of Things to Come are as fresh as they've ever sounded. I'm as big a fan of Robert Plant as anyone, but I'll be damned if these tunes haven't been ENHANCED by being played... Live at the Greek.
0312263120|1.0|I doubt this will be a popular review, but I feel obliged to tell it like I see it...or read it, in this case - and &quot;Digital Fortress&quot; is a waste of time! I have now read all of Dan Brown's books and am a big fan. Brown tackles unusual subjects, conducts impeccable research on his topics and writes fabulous suspense thrillers, with the exception of this one. His characters are cardboard, totally without depth. The plot could have been believable but it is not written in a credible or logical manner. The action is chaotic - and there is too much action and too little substance here.<br />The National Security Agency, (NSA), has a top secret, totally invincible code-breaking machine called TRANSLTR, especially effective against advanced electronic terrorism. A disgruntled ex-NSA employee, Ensei Tankado, is a genius computer programmer and author of encryption algorithms. He has written a program that creates unbreakable codes and is using this program to blackmail NSA. Tankado wants a public disclosure of TRANSLTR. This multibillion dollar wonder machine that supports the CIA, FBI, DEA, IRS, etc., and traces &amp; monitors drug cartel shipments, corporate money transfers and terrorists chatter on the Internet, also grossly violates human rights. It is able to open and read everyone's email and reseal it without public knowledge. The US government has the capability, with TRANSLTR, of violating the privacy of computer users around the world. And Tankado is sworn to protect the peoples' right to privacy. Sounds like a terrific plot, right? That's why I bought the book.<br />Enter Susan Fletcher, the beautiful, talented, brilliant NSA cryptologist and mathematician who steps in to investigate the unbreakable code that threatens to render TRANSLTR useless. What she uncovers should be shocking and terrifying, but it isn't. It's blatantly unbelievable. The theory is realistic, but the people who take action, and their different rationales, are totally ludicrous. How could people like this be in charge of national security? I could understand a bad apple, or even two - but there are just too many wackos populating this novel, and all with mega-responsibility. It would be horrifying if there were a secret code that would cripple US intelligence systems. But Brown tampered too much with a potentially great plot. He has Susan's boss, Commander Strathmore, deputy director of NSA's CRYPTO facility, send Susan's fiance to Spain on a Top Secret errand...and the fiance doesn't even work for NSA! He's a foreign language professor! Apparently Strathmore has his own agenda, which is ridiculous and totally weakens the storyline. There is unnecessary globetrotting, too many needless murders, silly dialogue, uncalled for disasters, etc., etc. If Dan Brown were not the author, I would have closed the book before the halfway mark. I kept waiting for the author to make some sense out of all the malarkey.<br />There is so much potential here for a super suspense techno-thriller. And the issue of where to draw the line between national security and personal freedom is a wonderful one to explore. Unfortunately the novel contains too many special effects, unbelievable subplots and flat characters...and all the above mentioned needless action. The fascinating information about real life technologies, cryptography and the battle for privacy in cyberspace is lost in the mega-murders and catastrophes that plague this novel. If you are intrigued by the subject matter, then by all means read the book, and you may even enjoy it. It seems that other reviewers have. I don't often award 1 Star, but I really believe that that's all this novel deserves. I find Dan Brown's other books to be excellent - across the board.<br />JANAow could people like this be in charge of national security?

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|i first heard remenissions and thought it was a very good song.  i decided to check out the cd to see if the rest stacked up to remenissions.  it truly did.  this is one of the first cds i have found with a numerous number of VERY GOOD solos.  the fact that the vocalist can scream, and sing very well just blew me away.  that is a very rare combination and i have found very few vocalists who can match up (former vocalist from killswitch engage is one of them).  this is probably the best metal cd of the year and possibly the 00's, matching up against &quot;Alive or Just Breathing&quot; from killswtich engage, and &quot;Through the Eyes&quot; from Flaw.  Buy it if you like metal, especially melodic metal.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|In spite of the grumbling by a few, this version of Let It Be is as originally intended and not another rewrite of the Beatles legacy by Paul McCartney. In fact George (prior to hid death) and Ringo both work on and approved this remastering. What you now have are the tracks as originally envision before Phil Spector either improved or ruined (depending on your particular opinion). I agree with Glyn Johns' (the original enigineer) assesment of those mixes when he used the phrase \\"Phil Spector vomited all over the tracks\\". Here we have the raw, gutty and outstanding versions that were hinted at in the Anthology 3 release. I am glad that we are finally getting to hear them. I was not disappointed! In fact the standout tracks are \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" (which comes across as a more personal and emotional version without the sappy chorus and strings -- plus now you can hear Billy Preston) and \\"Across The Universe\\" one of Lennon's best works. Here his haunting vocal and fine guitar work are able to shine like they should. These plus the added bonus of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", which is a truly great and underrated song, make this album a must listen to for any music fan. I wholly recommend it to anyone.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney's new album In The Zone certainly has a central theme - DANCE.  And furthermore, it seems she has taken some direct & indirect lessons from dance music's ruling queens.  The obvious is the infectious duet with Madonna on Me Against the Music - the fast beats, lyrical breakdowns and competing background vocals make for a great club hit (the bonus remix version is worthy on its own merits).  Brave New Girl is reminiscent of Madonna ala 80's (think Like A Virgin/True Blue era).  The feel and sound of Breathe On Me comes straight out of Kylie Minogue's 2002 megahit album Fever - so similiar in sound, it seems as if Britney just attended Kylie's concert and started recording from the parking lot.  Overall Britney has created a great fusion of sounds (from hip hop & R&B to dance & pop) and has reinvented herself into a sexier, aggresive image of a \\"girl not yet a woman\\" for today's younger, I just wanna watch videos and dance, cd-buying generation...sounds like anyone we know from the last two decades?  It seems Madonna quite possibly has found her heir.  Congrats Britney on following in the right footsteps.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I knew nothing about the Matrix series. I received this as a gift instead of the usual after shave or Hickory Farms gift pack and after viewing the movie was pleasantly surprised by the spectacular special visual effects and one of the most hair raising car / motorcycle chases on film.  I'm not that big into science fiction as I was when I was  younger and I was a bit worried about viewing a movie sequel without any idea what it's prdecessor was about. There was enough background to figure out the plot after a few minutes. I'll keep my review brief, after 1100+ reviews already, you probably have a good idea of what this movie offers. Sight unseen, I probably would not have bought this. After seeing The Matrix Reloaded (Widescreen Edition) I'm ordering the original Matrix and the third in the trilogy when it comes out. The DVD includes some extras but the one most worth watching is the making of the chase scene.  The stylized kung fu / Bruce Lee fight scenes were entertaining for the first few minutes.<BR>John Row
B00000DC7J|5.0|...but your father might have liked it, if he listened with an open mind.  For me - this is absolutely one of the most stunning recordings I've ever heard.  Piazzolla (bandone&oacute;n) and the musicians he assembled for this quintet (Fernando Su&aacute;rez Paz, violin;  Pablo Ziegler, piano;  Horacio Malvicino, Sr., guitar;  and H&eacute;ctor Console, bass) gave the performances of their collective lifetimes when they made this album, recorded in NYC in May of 1986.  It is the zenith of Piazzolla's career - and that's saying a lot, considering the contributions he made to music in his lifetime.<br />The music is nuevo tango - the traditional soul of tango, full of the emotion that it has always carried (and with which it carries its listeners and dancers), charged and reborn with all of the grit and grime that exists `at street level'.  Gosh - if the tangos we're used to hearing and seeing in the old films made your grandmother blush, this would most certainly put her on the floor in a dead faint.  The music is intricately composed - but at the same time, it is FELT in the depths of the soul.  There is nothing whatsoever cold and emotionless about it.  The musicians themselves are of the highest caliber - some are classically trained, some have their roots in jazz, but they are all under the spell of Piazzolla's vision.  The quiet passages purr and stroke the senses, the more strident ones will pick the listener up and toss them around.  The music will make you want to close your eyes and drift away one moment, then have you sweating the next.<br />Piazzolla made one more recording with this group, LA CAMORRA, and one featuring some of the same players (but not all of them), THE ROUGH DANCER AND THE CYCLICAL NIGHT (based on a story by the great Argentinean literary master Jorge Luis Borges).  These two are very, very good - but ZERO HOUR is his greatest.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is an unbelievable CD!  The songs are so infectious with their awesome, eclectic beats.  Her ability to entertain and change her style is unreal...she's fantastic!  I have been anxiously awaiting this album ever since they announced a release date and I am not the least bit disappointed.  I am actually pleasantly surprised that I love it as much as I love her third CD &quot;Britney&quot;, which has been in constant rotation in my car since it came out two years ago.  My favorites so far are &quot;I've got that Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;Early Morning&quot; and &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, but every song on the disk is a treat!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|To say I'm a Britney Spears fan is an understatement.  I absolutely love her, her music is very addictive.  I still listen to Baby, One More Time a lot, I think I'd call it my favorite song.  I had been waiting for In The Zone for many months, and 2 weeks prior to it's release I found myself listening and watching more Britney than I had ever done at one time.  Thanks to MTV's The Leak I was able to relieve some of the built up tension of the initial CD release and listen to Britney's beautiful voice sing songs that were a little different than her previous music.  Then at midnight on November 18th I was a very happy man finally holding the CD in my hands.  Her music is a rare kind that really moves me, and in In The Zone it's the song Everytime that moves me the most.  This is Britney's 4th gem and I'll be looking forward to the 5th, 6th, 7th, and so on.  Keep it up Britney, this is one devoted fan you will never lose.
B00009MEJU|1.0|&gt;As you can see, it's easy to find faults with this film. What's harder is expressing what's so great about [it]. <br />Three guesses why that is.
B00005JM02|5.0|I'll keep my review short and in agreement with the large amount of positive reviews already expressed. <BR>I would just add: Besides being one of the year's most entertaining movies for youngsters, Finding Nemo astounds grown ups with \\"how'd they do that\\" art for the total length of the movie. This movie has a sophisticated plot.  Lot's of laughs yet poignant. The animation is so good you forget you're watching animation and not living creatures! I also appreciated that both the widescreen and fullscreen versions are included in the one package. The behind the scenes extras show how enthusiastic and professional the creative staff are. <BR>This is another DVD that makes your player, TV, etc look their best! And, if not obvious from my review, one that I think should be in everyone's DVD collection!<BR>John Row
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Whatever.  If you're looking for an historical reference, to \\"hear it the way the boys conceptualized it\\" then by all means, get this one.  Yes, there are improvements which have been discussed and lauded AD NAUSEUM. My favorite track has to be \\"I, Me, Mine\\" sans strings, which made it worth the purchase price for me. But I disagree that \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" is a vastly superior album in this form.  Frankly, not all the versions presented here are improvements over the originals. Get Back, Dig A Pony and I've Got A Feeling for example, were better before.    Not to mention what's missing -- that great echo on the rooftop songs, \\"thanks Mo; Phase One, in which Doris gets her oats; 'ark the angels come; HOLD IT!; I hope we passed the audition,\\"  -- all those comforting little quips which have stood as examples of the humanity of the lads? Wiped away. And you know what else? The guitar solo from the title track is less than inspired. [...]
B0000C6E4D|3.0|I was really looking forward to this album.  Maybe that was part of the problem.  Then again, I was waiting desperately for &quot;Surfacing&quot; to be released, and I got kind of dissapointed by that too.  It's very possible that I'm being one of those 'elitist jerks' who whines about how things used to be 'back in the day,' but I have to say that I'm really not enjoying the direction that Sarah McLachlan is taking, musically.<br />There is something very much missing on this album.  Something that's been slowly dissapearing since 1996's &quot;Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff&quot;.  That missing element?  Experimentation.  I absolutely *adored* &quot;Solace&quot;, &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstasy&quot;, &quot;The Freedom Sessions&quot;, &quot;Rarities, B-Sides, and Other Stuff&quot;, and various singles and one-offs that she did before 1998.  There was such eclecticism and this amazing feeling of atmosphere.  There was depth and texture to the backgrounds that totally set off and highlight Sarah's beautiful voice.<br />No, I didn't love every track on all of those CD's, but I appreciated them because there was variety.  &quot;Surfacing&quot; still had a shadow of that, but mostly on the tracks released previously.  The real stand-out tracks, for me, on &quot;Surfacing&quot; were &quot;Full of Grace&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; (before it got played into the ground.)  But with &quot;Afterglow&quot;, the only track that really grabs me at all is &quot;Fallen&quot;, and I'm guessing that's going to get over tired pretty quick, with all its radio play.<br />Don't get me wrong.  The musicianship and vocals on &quot;Afterglow&quot; are really solid.  I'm just really sad that both kind of blend into a monotone by the end of the album.  I miss the experimentation and the mood that was so wonderfully present in her early to mid-1990's albums.  I hope to hear them again one day.
B0000A36J5|5.0|This DVD is of course excellent. But pertaining to the gift set, how do you get the Gollum statue out of the box without destroying the package? I'm still trying to figure it out. From the top? Bottom? I'v tried every which way but everything is glued together. Any help?
B00005JKNF|4.0|The first time I watched Gosford Park, I was a little bored, and a little stressed out. It was difficult to catch what everyone was saying, and I could not keep track of who was who! When it was done I was relieved, and wondered why it had won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in the first place. I slept on it, and the next day I decided to give it a second chance--and am I glad I did! I pretty much knew the names of all the characters and such so I could focus on the story and also the great dialogue. It reminded me of the old classic movies that were made up primarily of really good dialogue. <BR>The movie also had a really good idea about the upper crusts and their servants (who know more than their employers would like!). One line in the film says it all: one of the detectives who is interviewing all the people in the house after the murder, sees no point in speaking to many of the servants. He only wants to investigate the people, he says, \\"had a real connection to the victim.\\" Oh, contraire!<BR>There is a wickedly good twist at the end (though I kind of suspected it earlier on), and it just cements the statement the film makers were trying to say.<BR>I highly recommend Gosford Park, and even if you enjoy it the first time around, watch it again, maybe even more than that, to be sure you catch every bit of brilliant dialogue.
B000062Y98|3.0|At the end of the day this does not sound as epic as middle- earth the songs don,t seem to stand out and the melodies arent quite as good
B0000CFW87|5.0|I've been too busy listening to this gorgeous album over and over to stop and actually write a review, until now. This is the sophomore album every artist dreams of.  In Closer, Josh has created a masterpiece that truly showcases his growth as an arist.  The song choices are more mature, and he sings with much more strength and passion than on his previous album.  And is this album passionate!  Each and every song on this CD will grab your emotions and not let go till the end.   &quot;Oceano&quot; and &quot;All'improvviso Amore&quot; are uplifting songs that let will make your soul soar as much as Josh's voice does. The Spanish guitar makes an appearance in the bittersweet but powerful &quot;Si Volvieras A Mi&quot;. On &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot;, Josh displays some rather poetic songwriting.  Every song on this CD is amazing; there isn't a skippable track in the bunch.  It's definately a must for your music collection.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania definately gives her all in this LIVE performance ! Filmed in the Windy City Shania takes the breath away from her wide fan base ! Mixing our favorites with songs from her 4th album, Shania makes everyone happy ! Would be a wonderful gift for any Shania fan !
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I liked Britney Spears in the past, but now I LOVE the woman. First of all, let me say my taste in music is diverse. I love her in addition to Madonna, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Coldplay, Guns N Roses, Janet Jackson, John Mayer, Eminem, etc... So I'm not just some britney fanatic that only listens to Britney's music. As a music lover, this album is phenominal! &quot;In the Zone&quot; takes Britney to a whole new level. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I love this album. Usually when I get a cd, I'll like a few tracks and end up skipping songs to get to another one, but I keep listening to this one all the way through to the end because every track is a favorite. It is THAT good. Its high energy music combining regular dance along with some hip hop.  There's only one ballad at the end of the album but its a beautiful track and a great way to wind down just before you get to that remix of &quot;me against the music&quot; at the end. This album is also great if you need something to just pump you up for the day, or work out or to do whatever. Now obviously if you didn't like Britney before, then you probably won't ever like her, but if you're open minded, appreciated her work in the past and ready to 'get in the ZONE', BUY this cd! Its a MUST HAVE.
B00003CXAW|5.0|Classic theme, breakthrough effects(for it's time), and awesome casting.  This was the first, best giant monster movie.  Boy, can Faye scream!!! Keep in mind folks, this was at time LONG before George Lucas created ILM, so the effects have to be appreciated for what they are. In 1933, I'm sure it looked real enough. Kong's impact on pop culture was as tremendous as he was.  Enough so, that several other studios had to borrow or steal aspects of it in more than one way. Yes, I'm talking about TOHO also.<br />A timeless classic that I will never tire of, and will pass down to my children.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|One thing I like about DT is their ability to change their sound with each studio release, while at the same time keep true to their musical form.  This album is a move away from the more symphonic SDoIT and a move towards the metal side of things.  Although I've heard heavy things from them before, nothing quite this heavy.  <br />I have to say, though, that I like this album.  There are times, as some people have pointed out here, that Petrucci is a bit unmelodic (like on &quot;Dying Soul&quot;).  And I don't know if they meant to do this or not, but when I was half way through &quot;As I Am&quot; (which I am assuming they have realeased with a radio-edit) I thought I was listening to Metallica!  I don't know...I guess Metallica could learn a couple of things from these guys.<br />Truthfully, I had hoped that DT would continue making more progressive and melodic pieces like Six Degrees.  I am a bit disappointed that they moved away from that to turn towards a heavier sound.  But at the same time, I'm glad they're keeping true to form and exploring new musical avenues.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This set is by far a greater buy than the original.
B000005Z0G|1.0|My faverit songZ by tupack are Gansters paradis wich was featured in the movie Dangris Minds.  Also I like the song California Love.  I love it when he's like :&quot;everybody welcome to the wild wild west&quot;  because that happenes to be my favorite will smith movie!  The favorite tupack record is the ARE YOU STILL DOWN, but i have the edited version because my dum parents disaprove but uyou still know whats hesayin.  I am from a white uper class naebor hood by i still understrand tus lyrics because i can relate with his issues i havent got everything i want when im a kid like he didnt get. but i feel connected with his words because he talks about how hje likes to be high and my dad is a pilot and we fly in his plane a lot and we have a good time.  Tupack talks alot how he liked to be really high in his plane.  His music has inspired me to dop the best i can in school.  I like tupacks thuglife tatto because my grandpa has an anchor tattoees on his arm and i like tatoos.We are allsorry that tupack was shot after leaving a party with his manager puff diddy, but his legend lives on.  He will live in all our hearts forever,.  My other favoruite song by tu is the new one made by M&amp;M called 'RUNNING' featuring nortoris big, it is about how when pack was young he was in track and i run track so we also have that in commun.  I dont like nortoris big as much because his rcord label (Aftermath records) was behind the release of the wu tang clan which i dont like because they have satanic refrecnes. But i really like this tupack cd and thats why i gave it the #1 star!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|Maybe I have too many fond memories of this album, or maybe I'm just old and don't deal with change well, but somehow this remix just doesn't sit well with me.  Yes, it sounds fantastic, almost as if you are in the room with the fab four as they were making one final attempt to rekindle the spark that defined their early years.  Recording technology has greatly advanced since these tracks were first laid down.  In this new mix the separation between the instruments is phenomenal, there is clarity and snap in the performance, but just because you can change a historical document, doesn't mean that you should.       Why was this remix done?  The true fan says that they have been unhappy with the Phil Spector production since it's release.  The true cynic says that EMI is repackaging the Beatles over and over to squeeze every penny out of this cash cow.          Should you not buy this?  You'll have to decide that for yourself.  There are some good tracks here.  \\"Across The Universe\\" is a revelation.  Ringo's sparse drumming is given a more prominent place in the mix, proving that a great musician is known not only for what they play, but also for what they don't.  The production is stupendous, but for me, I like the original mix of Let It Be, not in spite of its flaws, but because of them.
0671027344|3.0|At the beginning and middle of the book it is boring.  I say that because throughout the beginning and the middle of the book, you are lost and you can't really understand what is going on.  There is also too much mentioning of crying and laughing through the whole book.  The beginning is really boring because Charlie doesn't tell you much about himself because he wants to stay anonymous.<br />   The end of the book is okay.  Things start to get clearer and it is sad because all of his older high school friends leave Charlie because they are going off to college.  At the end of the book you're not really lost anymore than what you were in the beginning and middle.  The end just seems more interesting to me than the beginning and middle.<br />   Seriously, I don't think Stephen Chbosky should write another book in this type of format, which the format is journal writings.  This was just not one of the books that I like to read.  It is not very amusing.<br />   If you're going to read this book (you shouldn't) but if you are I think the age range is anywhere between a mature teenager through an adult.  It has some pretty nasty stuff and bad words in the book.  Overall it was average, just because of the ending though.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Critics are quick to point out the similarities of tone and theme betweeen songs, but this by far is Britney's best attempt at showcasing the new direction of her sound...I really loved track #8 (touch of my hand... yes the subject is a little taboo--self-pleasure, but were all human and its better to be safe and love yourself than to get your rocks off with someone you just met)... and track #12 (Everytime... it's believed this was written about and to Justin Timberlake... and I think it's beautiful, heart-felt and very touching)... the album needs to be listened to a couple of times in order to really understand and &quot;feel&quot; each song for what it has to offer... I am a die-hard BRitney Fan and I think she's criticized way too over, her voice is OK (even she admits this compared to others such as Christina Aguilera), but what she really sells is her IMAGE and there's no doubt about it, she's HOT! You watch her because, like Madonna, you want to see what she does next, how much further she's going to push the envelope in order to peak our interests. ROCK ON BRITNEY!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I expected a mature, grown up Britney with this album, but WOW I was wrong...The album is TOOO \\"samey\\", and it's still bubble gum pop...She's yet to establish herself as a grown up artist...Why is it so hard for her? In a nutshell, this is just another Britney album.
B000005J56|5.0|One of the greatest records ever made. A classic.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|When I first heard about this release, I, like countless listeners I'm sure, was really looking forward to hearing the GET BACK album that was pulled shortly before the record was to hit shelves; this is not that album, despite the schilling of the hyperbolic sticker on the cd.  Instead, what we get is yet another attempt by Mr. McCartney to re-write the legacy of his former band.  How else to explain the suddenly thundering bass levels at the expense of Harrison's now muted leads?  As someone who always gave McCartney the benefit of the doubt, his actions of the past few years have served only to strengthen claims by Lennon and Harrison as to the selfish egotism of his character.  LET IT BE - NAKED is NOT The Beatles, it's PAUL McCARTNEY's BEATLES. Perhaps this time, fans should Listen to What the Man Said and not give him their money.
B00009N828|1.0|The entire purpose of this big-budget three-hour movie was to reassure white boys that they can be gangsters, too, and in fact the entire gang culture in New York originated with them.What an honor...NOT! BIG friggin' deal! I am NOT impressed. Since Eminem exploded onto the music scene, it's suddenly cool to be immoral gutter trash.<br />This is historically inaccurate, plotless, chaotic MESS is the most OVERHYPED movie of all time. Save your money!

0553269631|5.0|McCullers writing is both Southern Gothic and Existential. In the Southern Gothic tradition of Faulkner, her characters are both larger than life and grotesque. Many of them exist on the seamier side of the tracks. She shows us the dark side of the South. There is the loner, alcoholic that ends up as a carnie. There is the restaurant owner who is bitter and lonely. We also meet the old black doctor that while dedicating his life helping less fortunate in his oppressed community is so filled with bitterness and hatefulness that he can't bring himself to reconcile with his son. The son is an activist that feels his father has sold out to the white man. We also meet Mitch a young girl oppressed by her parent's poverty trying to find her way in the world. This book is an unbelievably rich reading experience -- one that should not be missed. I Recommend this book with all my heart. Other titles I enjoyed: As I Lay Dying by Faulkner, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie is brilliant - a wonder ride for children of all ages, from 4 to 84!  The voices of the colorful characters are very well cast (Ellen Degeneres as Dory, and Willem Defoe as Scar are so convincing you almost want to believe that they *are* talking fish), and the adventures are breathtaking, exhilerating, and frightening all at the same time.  Plus, the movie has so many hysterical moments -- pelicans crashing into windows, the famous &quot;bird bubbles&quot; scene (which is definitely in one of the trailers), and of course the evil seagulls croaking &quot;mine&quot;.  No one could resisted being amused, amazed, and satisfied with this movie.  You'll want to ride the East Australian Current again and again!
B0000E1WKE|2.0|I have supported Whitney ever since she dropped her first album. She USE to be one of the best vocals out there.  However, this CD is just average.  <BR>It's not filled with her high pitched hitting notes and several times she sounds like she is straining!  Most of the songs could have been produced better.  She shouldn't have recorded Freddie Jackson's christmas song, &quot;One Wish.&quot;<BR>I'm so glad that I listened to this CD at a friends house before I spent my money.  The project before this christmas CD had given me plenty of warning.  I like to warn you!
B00008NRLX|2.0|This album is embarassingly maudlin and cheesy; lyrically way out of step with the charms of previous Jayhawks records. Save for the opening two tracks, Rainy Day Music is a Hallmark card of a record, a real cringe-fest. Skip it.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|I had this album on CD for a long time and enjoyed it immensely.  It is a very well written album and the songs rock.  Then I saw it on SACD, so I had to buy it.  When I got it home, it was just like listening to a different album.  The clarity of the vocals was amazing, along with the clarity of the instruments.  David Bowie's voice echoing around my living room made it though.<br />Each SACD release is making me hope that it is here to stay because it is so awesome.
B0000636UN|4.0|Plain and simple -- this album rocks.  At least, a number of the tracks do, and those tracks are so good they save the rest of the less interesting songs on the record.  &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is simply the best old-school Rock 'N Roll song to be released in 5 years at least.  It has an incredible, cutting drive to it.  &quot;You're An Original&quot; is another fantastic rock song, although I have to wonder what Lenny Kravitz is doing on it - he doesn't sound very good.  But Sheryl's voice and the song itself are so good you just don't need to pay too much attention to Kravitz.  There' s a bit of a breather in the middle of the album, but things heat up again toward the end - &quot;Abilene&quot; is an awesome anthemic rock piece that could have come out of &quot;Tommy&quot; in a different era.  &quot;Hole In My Pocket&quot; is a funny, peppy piece about a girl who's a little bit scatterbrained.  But it has a great groove to it and you can't help but start shaking something when it comes on.  If you want to catch the essence of the album, you can just download those four songs I mentioned from the iTunes music store, and coupled with the airplay the album still gets, you won't be missing too much.  But this album is still worth four stars, one for each of those fantastic songs.
B00009RGBS|5.0|I was really excited to see this film in the theater. It's been ages since I've seen a Broadway like hit at the movies. Some people liked Moulin Rouge. I love Chicago. The cast is incredable: Renee Zellweger (who learned to dance and sing in a matter of months) is spectacular and should have won an Oscar for this film, with along side the extremely talented and strong voiced Catherine Zeta-Jones, Queen Latifa (who's the best in this movie, then I've ever seen her in anything else), and the amazing Richard Gere who will make you smile with his numbers and dance moves.<br />The movie is set of course in Chicago around the 1920's, where we meet a woman named Roxie Hart who will do anything to become famous. Starts off on the wrong foot by killing a man who she had thought could get her into vaudeville. Now thrown in jail Roxie becomes famous due to her lawyer Billy Flynn turning the story around to where Roxie is the innocent one. Meanwhile, while making enemies with the famous singer/dancer Velma Kelly who then both compete for media attention. And love stepping over each other's toe's. During this time Roxie daydreams of song and dance numbers at every event she experiences while in prison.<br />The storyline, the music which fits extremely well and I have listened to this amazing soundtrack over and over again, makes this the best classic movie of all time and is well worth all the awards and nominations. Nothing is played down to the audience and there's no body doubles in this film everyone did their own song and dance.<br />And from the behind the scene's look that's featured on the DVD this one story is based on a bunch of 'like' stories from around that time - minus the song and dance - but a reporter Mary Sunshine who was played by Christine Baranski in the film - actually wrote stories of women killing their men and writing about them in the paper to get the public to feel sorry for them and which stopped them from getting hanged. She then went onto writing the play which turned into the Broadway Hit with help of Bob Fosse.<br />So in summery the movie, the music, the dancing, and the DVD is all the way an A!!
B000002G7E|5.0|I read the criticisms of this album and my assumptions were right, they knew nothing of what they were talking about. They fail to understand the sonic brilliance and courage of the Velvet's masterpiece WHITE LIGHT WHITE HEAT. The last with the great John Cale and the first without Warhol or Nico. This album contains Lou Reed's most abrasive and finest songwriting and the musicianship, while not efficient, is downright deranged!!<BR>This album contains six unforgettable Velvet Underground tunes, containing some of the heaviest work they ever produced. It kicks off with the title track, Lou Reed's upbeat ode to his two drugs of choice, amphetamenes (White Light) and heroin (White Heat). Unlike his previous drug songs (Heroin and Waiting for the man) this tune is like a poppy jingle celebrating and endorsing speed, and lead to many expansions when played live. The tempo is slowed down for a more ambitious, experimental piece, The Gift. Reed, Morrison and Tucker play tweaked out R&B while John Cale reads one of Lou Reed's tragic, but hilarious short Stories. A strange tale of a man named Waldo who so misses his ex lover that he decides to (literally) mail himself to her, only to lead to his own bloody death. The story is well written and Cale reads it with a good dramatic style which is sympathisized by the band's music. This is followed by a similar, but lyrically more shocking tune. Lady Godiva's Operation, Sung by Cale and Reed, is one of the sickest, most bizarre songs ever written. an adaptation of an old folk tale, the song tells the story of transexual who dies during his sex change, preceded by a leak in his ether tube, creating immense pain and suffering before he dies. This perverse tale is also complimented by an R&B flavor similar to that of The Gift. But the band quiets down considerably for the delicate beauty of the fourth track, Here She Comes Now. This lovely ballad can be interpreted as a straightforward love song, but the beauty lies in it's arpeggiated lines and Cale's Viola. This is the album's sole pretty song and marks the end of the more experimental side of the album.<br />The last two songs are pure sonic energy. I Heard Her Call My Name is definitely a precurser to Punk Rock, but has influences of freeform jazz in Reed's deranged guitar lines. Then, finally, the album is finished off with the 17 1/2 minute Jam session, Sister Ray. This is one of the most innovative songs of its time. Unlike most long jams, which incorporate patterns of improv and solos, Sister Ray is an all out war between the musicians. Reed and Morrison play driving, menacing rhythm chords on their guitars against John Cale's overdriven Organ while Moe Tucker holds the rhythm. The two forces battle each other, taking over from time to time, only for the other to take full force again. This generates massive feedback and more insanity is added through Reed's most menacing lyrics, telling a story of sex, drugs, violence and murder. This track has great courage and majesty. A great innovation. It's been said that this was the closest they came to reproducing the feedback improvisation of their lives shows from the 1967-68 period, which sadly, were never recorded.<br />I will say this, White Light White Heat is the least accessible of the VU's work and is very often misunderstood. But contrary to what a previous reviewer said, it is possible for some with a sophisticated understanding of music to enjoy this album. As a matter of fact it takes a sophisticated mind to really understand this work. WLWH is the Velvet Underground's undisputed masterpiece and if I had to guess, was probably the most satisfying to them, considering their avant-garde roots. Due to the absence of John Cale, The Velvets became somewhat deluted (not that they didn't still Rock!!) but the height of their energy, exhuberance, and style is all on these six numbers.
B0000TB03W|5.0|AMAZING....I am just now discovering Shania as a great performer...This DVD showcases her talents and energy to perform..The songs just get better and better each time I watch the DVD (3 times already)...If you want an unbelievable experience get this DVD for yourself and others...
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|The immediate, propelled, surf-guitar sound on the leadoff track, \\"What Ever Happened,\\" signifies the Strokes aren't changing for anybody on their second album -- nor should they. If anything, \\"Room on Fire\\" is a little less catchy than its predecessor, [[ASIN:B00005QIPH Is This It]], but it's still a hot little 33-minute album well worth getting if you dig this band.<br /><br />The Strokes are great because of the way they use their instruments to propel a song forward. Everything sounds so timely and good on this CD. \\"Automatic Stop,\\" for instance, features awesome drumming by Fab Moretti; his drum beat in this particular song is addictive, and I'd love to hear him play at a live show.<br /><br />A great early-1980s vibe soaks the song \\"12:51,\\" one of the catchiest new tunes I've heard in a long time. If you enjoy the keyboardlike guitar sound on \\"12:51,\\" you'll love the same sort of thing on track ten, \\"The End Has No End,\\" which I think should have been released as a single. (I also think this tune should have swapped places with \\"I Can't Win\\" to end the album, but hey, it's just my opinion.)<br /><br />These guys have said many times they'll spend hours in the studio perfecting the sound of their instruments, and that comes through in the Strokes' driving sound, where every instrument can be heard clearly and each musician does his part to carry the tunes. In all, the Strokes are just a cool band: independent, talented, fun, dark, pop, punk, party animals and rock stars. They did themselves proud with this CD, and fans won't be disappointed.<br /><br />Like the Shins, the Strokes kept their second album short and to the point, not changing things at all, but still managing to evolve.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I know they've released the Alien movies about 5 times already, but there's no way on Earth they can ever release something better than this. This has got everything about Alien that has ever existed. Including a longer version of Alien 3, I didn't think that was possible. This has got the be the most amazing thing to ever be realeased on DVD. How long is it all, 500 minutes? This is simply amazing. I know you've probably already paid about $150 for all 4 Alien DVD's, but just sell them and just that will be enough to buy this. This is so cheap too, I can't believe its not selling for $300.

0156027321|5.0|The synopsis for this book is short, and already fullsomely covered in the reviews on the site. I shan't go into the wither-tos and why-fors of the story for fear of repetition. I simply want to sell this book as a good Amazon reviewer should, and one of the most obvious aspects of this particular work that springs to mind when I consider my feelings whilst reading it is it's life affirming qualities. Now, I really don't like that phrase, 'life affirming'--it reminds me of words like pro-active and Salt Lake City--but I must concede that, on this occasion, it fits perfectly.<BR>For me, to have life re-affirmed by a work of art is to be injected with a sense of hope for our species. When I look at \\"The Sunflowers\\" or listen to the last movement of the \\"Glorious Ninth\\", I am reminded of just how much we are capable. So too with \\"Life of Pi.\\" This, like all the greatest works of art, is a piece that stands alone; a universe all to itself. This work is like a key in a lock; one gets the sense that it couldn't 'work' any other way. The world here created is a closed circuit lesson in humanity, reality, family and religion, whilst at the same time just being a beautiful composition with no real grounding in documentary reality whatsoever. 'Tsk tsk' I hear you say, 'some passages in the book couldn't be any more real if they were, well...real'. I agree, but that's not to say that they could ever actually happen in the real.<BR>Martell's Pacific is at times an almost picture perfect rendition of the actual ocean, but like all great novelists, he is perfectly at home with just making it a stage; a big empty, lonely stage. Near the end of the book, such abstaction takes hold that I must confess, I felt like I was reading \\"Waiting for Godot\\" on acid! Fantastic.<BR>Pi has to be one of my favourite literary characters. I've read reviews that refer to this 'child's' suffering, but what sets this protagonist apart from others of his kind is his unfathomable wisdom. When a child can attest to being a follower of all three of the world's major religions and defend his stance pitted against the 'wise men' of those orders; when he can then, without adult guidance, tame a Bengal tiger in the middle of the Pacific ocean; when a child behaves in this way, one is given the distinct impression that he is not a child. This old soul is the fulcrum for the whole book, and his compatibility with his purpose is, for me, unsurpassed. Again, he reminds me of all that is possible as a human being, in fact making me feel almost ashamed that my most exciting experiances have all been confined to my own cozy home land and mind-set.<BR>The blurb on the back cover of the book announces that it's a story to make you believe in God. For me, to say that one believes in God is like saying one believes in the Sun. God is undeniable; everywhere and everything. In this respect, the book has only bolstered what I already knew to be true, and maybe, just maybe, it could swing a non-believer at least to concentrated thinking on the subject; a seldom made claim in this day and age<BR>It's a book that stays with you long after you've finished it, and anyone who doesn't read it is either stupid or American or both (he said with his tongue firmly in his cheek.)
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Not known for her singing ability, this CD still showcases other industry people who prove that they know what they're doing.  The CD is catchy, fun and energetic.  I'm a fan of Brit's, but not a delusional one..I know her limits (and can hear them), but the overall work is still pretty good.  Besides, I got it for $13...for sure worth it!
B000001E3V|4.0|For Peter. Your information is incorrect. The best solo's are all mainly Allman.  Duane does the best guitar work on &quot;Bell Bottom Blues,&quot; continues with is slide solo's on &quot;Key To the Highway&quot; and is even better on the first solo in &quot;Have You Ever Loved A Woman,&quot; which is Allman&quot;s slide followed up by Eric's solo and finishes up with Duane's second slide solo.  Mindy is correct that the best solo's are from Duane Allman.  Let this be credit to Eric's practice of letting others handle some of the limelight with out any jealopusy.  &quot;Live at the Fillmore&quot; is a great album which would have been better had Duane been there.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|What they've done to this album goes beyond the removal of the controversal Phil Spector additions and manipulations that were on the original release. Playing the CD on my stereo, it felt almost as if the Beatles were actually performing in my living room. Compared to the original, the vocals in particular are much more distinctive and alive in this new version. These are definitely not the cuts heard previously on the Anthology release.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol is really a pretty good Post-Punk band who's 1 CD TOTBL is evoking incredible emotion. It's clear to me that it will go down in the history of 2002 releases as the CD which keeps me laughing longest.<br />It seems I've found, hands down, the best comedy site on the Web. Please keep running to the defense of poor little Interpol. I'm having a blast with these reviews!!!<br />This is great. Keep `em coming folks. You've got me in stitches!
B00001QEE8|5.0|My whole family simply loves this movie.  As I stated in the title I give this movie 100 stars.  It was Walt's last and arguably one of the best pieces of entertainment to be produced while Walt was still alive.  Can there be a more perfect matching of characters and voices in an animated film?  I don't think so.
B00009V7T2|5.0|\\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" is possibly the prog-rock album of the year.  I hope I don't turn off potenital fans by using that label to describe them, but they break the rock mold in a way that really can be defined in no other way.  Don't expect \\"At the Drive-In on Ice\\", by any means.  Instead, expect to find music that is written for the sake of music, that breaks boundaries, that forces the listener to think and experience concepts outside of the easy boundaries of culture and social norms that are forced on us by the media.<br />Of course, like any good prog-rock project, \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" is a conceptual album.  The main character Cerpin Taxt, who is based on a real person that the band knew, falls into a coma due to self-abusive behavior.  While in a coma, Taxt experiences a (possibly) hallucinigenic journey through a landscape of his own decay.  The intellectually poetic lyrics make references to medical terminology, ghosts, public transportation, isolation, confusion, philosophical figures, and (self) deception.<br />Sonically, the Mars Volta recalls the best of progressive's past and present.  Like some idiot-savant with Turret's Syndrome, they seem to embody both effortlessly.  It is difficult to point to one musician in the group that is not necessary for the overall sound.  Every player in the group deserves mention.  Guitarist  Omar Rodriguez-Lopez plays with an measured angularity that recalls Robert Fripp's late '60's/early 70's work but with the passsion of a young Carlos Santana.  Cedric Bixler-Zavala sings like a young Geddy Lee being possessed by the passionate spirit of Tool's Maynard.  Drummer Jon Theodore recalls the aggressive technical chops of Neil Peart, but with the instinctive recklessnes of Keith Moon.  Using classic hammond/mellotron/fender-rhodes piano sounds, keyboardist Isaiah Owens recalls the necesssarily transparent playing of Billy Preston.  Then there's Flea standing in on bass, and holding on for dear life.  He seems actually quite challenged in this project, so much so that he never really gets the chance to \\"Flea out\\".  He just plays some fantastically solid and distinctive bass, which is great to hear from him, especially in this context.<br />How does one reconcile the gap between punk and prog?  Take the in-your-face aggression of punk and put it side-by-side with darkly beautiful ballads, compelling soundscapes, metrically  complex and angular riffs, and freely open jams. This recording can't be described witout referring to pure emotional energy.  Again, like in precious few recordings that I have encountered, my stereo just does not go loud enough to make me feel the emotional connection that is obviously intended here.  Live, though, it shines through.  See them if you can.<br />The lowdown: Simultaneously being a music lover and cynic, I am usually hard-pressed to easily accept new music by a band I don't know much about.  I am used to the few listens it takes for me to decide what I really think about a project.  The Mars Volta convinced me immediately, and is still convincing after several months of heavy rotation and an extremely memorable live experience, which is beyond the scope of this review to recount.  Long live The Mars Volta!eems actually quite challenged in this project, so much so that he never really gets the chance to \\"Flea out\\".

B00008J4P5|5.0|I dont think anyone who is knocking this band totally understands them. They are a minimalist band. Meg White isnt a bad drummer. She has the ability to play normal rock beats, but the type of music they play requires her to not play flashy beats. That is also why they dont have a bassist. I love this album for what it is, not for what people want it to be. Pick up this album, but expect a minimalist album not a normal rock album.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|The Original \\"Let It Be\\" was the opposite of what it was supposed to be.  Just as much as Sgt. Pepper was to Revolver, so is Let it Be to the other preceeding Albums.  The Title of the original Album that Let It Be was to have was \\"Get Back\\". The whole point of this album was a reaction to the Beatles increasingly more complicated, unperformable music that they were writing.  This album was to be a back to basics album, the sound of them, and only them,(and Preston) and the sound that they made in a room, with no polish added.  So, when the sessions never yielded an actual album, and the beatles inevitably broke up, and John gave the tapes to Phil Spector to do something with, it was ironic.  \\"Let It Be\\" in Phil Spector's hands created an oxymoron.  The album, instead of showing the band, and the sound they made, with no overdubbed help, became like a disney movie soundtrack, drenched in Spector's wall of sound.      So, this release is in a way, is the \\"real\\" Let It Be coming out.  I wish this album would have carried the title \\"Get Back\\" as it was meant to be.         That said, the few tracks that are really affected are better off without the \\"wall of sound\\".  These songs sound more intimate, hollow, empty, but intentionally.  They carry more weight in the absense of Spector's sound.  They sound more honest, like the Beatles' were.         Also, this album has a different lead in Let it Be George Harrison plays.  The lead in The Long and Winding Road can actually be heard as well.  Dig It and Maggie Mae are removed and Don't Let Me Down replaces them, and good riddance.  Dig It and Maggie Mae aren't real songs.  They are the sounds of a band working on songs that weren't that good to begin with.  Don't let me Down was recorded at the same sessions, so it's no crime by exchanging these songs.  Had the album been in the Beatles' hands to begin with, Dig It and Maggie Mae would probably have never made it to actual release.      The two things I don't like about this album is that the talking has been eliminated from the tracks.  Also, digitally remixed means that it isn't as \\"live\\" as everyone thinks.  It means that protools, or something similar was involved, which means that they cut and spliced, lengthened, lined up, shortened, and evened out certain sounds in this recording to make them sound a little better than they actually played in the actual recording.
B00003CXB4|2.0|The advertisements for this film that you see on other DVDs and videos are purposely and horribly misleading.  You buy this video expecting a joyous musical romp with animals of the Serengeti for your children.  Plain and simple this is a movie of death.  The lead character dies a horrible death and there are fights to the death.  This is not a children's movie.  See the first &quot;Editors&quot; comments.  Compared to NEMO, artistically the animation is simply not that great.  The background scenes are repetitious.  Disk 2 is basically an advertisement for the musical. My youngsters never get tired the the original Disney Jungle Book.  We've seen it hundreds of times.  We viewed this movie once and that was enough.
B000002KBH|4.0|This is supposed to be the Grateful Dead's masterpiece.  I'm not quite sure.  It has what are probably the best 3 Dead songs of all time, Sugar Magnolia, Friend of the Devil and Truckin.  But, the rest of the tracks are not that great.  I feel that some portions of the album border on boring, with Garcia droning while you wait to get the great stuff.  Note that this is the worst of the Rhino remasters of the WB records.<br />This is the Dead's first complete collection of real, straight ahead rock songs.  The first four albums were a mixture of studio rock songs, live music and some really wierd stuff (except Live Dead, which was all live).  The fifth album, Working Man's Dead was heavily country/folk oriented.  So this was the first accessible rock album from the Dead.  And it did have the 3 monster tracks plus some other good ones.  And during the sixties, it was unusual to get even 2 monster songs on one album.<br />Note that all of the Grateful Dead albums on the Warner Brothers label have been remastered by Rhino records.  The original CD issues on the WB label are getting hard to find, being replaced by the Rhino reissues.  (Rhino is owned by WB).<br />If are considering buying any of the early Dead albums, you should be sure to get the Rhino remasters.  They have done a wonderful job.  There is nice packaging with extensive liner notes.  They use up every second of the CD with bonus material.  What I really like is that they place a 10 second pause between the original and bonus material, so you can take the in original material without being hit by something you might not want to hear.<br />But...American Beauty has the worst bonus material of all the Rhino reissues.  It starts out with the single version of Truckin'.  I just heard the wonderful full length version of Truckin', I don't want to hear the edited version directly afterward, or anytime for that matter.  There are a few more single versions of songs.  The rest are live versions of the songs done in a stripped down, laid back matter.  They are interesting but not great.<br />If you already have American Beauty, it is not worth seeking out the reissues.  If don't have it, look for the Rhino remaster.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Unlike many of the reviews posted here, I am actually writing this after viewing the special edition DVD.<br />The additional footage was extremely enjoyable. I loved the Two Towers, the additional footage in this DVD enhanced the story line. Especially my wife, who is a casual fan of the lord of the rings, loved this movie.<br />The extra footage highlights:<br />- additional ent footage, including a discussion of the entwives<br />- a lot of stuff with Grima, Theoden, Eowyn, and Eomer that really enhanced that story line.<br />- the back story with Faramir &amp; Boromir was also very informative<br />All in all, this is the Two Towers DVD to buy. It shows more of the story which is great for both the hardcore fan and the casual observer.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|It's my opinion that when you rate an artifact, whether it's a CD or a movie or whatever, you shouldn't compare it with the same type of artifact; you should compare it with the standards it is presenting.  For example, there's no way you could compare Britney's &quot;In the Zone&quot; with Outkast's &quot;Speakerboxxx/The Love Below,&quot; or even Christina Aguilera's &quot;Stripped.&quot;  Britney is an entirely different breed of performer.  We know she's not the best vocalist, so that shouldn't be a factor in a review of this CD (unless you're not a Britney Spears fan, then by all means, criticize).  I happen to be a big fan of hers, despite all of her criticisms.  I also have a diverse taste in music that ranges from the aforementioned Outkast and Christina to Linkin Park and Jay-Z and Beyonce, among others, and can appreciate the type of music Britney makes for what it is.<br />So what did I think of &quot;In the Zone?&quot;  I actually thought it was pretty amazing for a Britney album.  It's probably the best album of her career.  I enjoyed every song on the set, with the exception of two (the ridiculous &quot;Shadow&quot; and &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;), which is more than I can say for her previous efforts (although I maintain that &quot;I'm a Slave 4 U&quot; is still her best song ever).  I also commend Britney for mixing genres of music onto her CD...there's hip-hop (&quot;I Got That Boom Boom,&quot; &quot;Outrageous,&quot; &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;), trance/techno (&quot;Early Mornin,&quot; &quot;Breathe On Me,&quot; &quot;Showdown,&quot; &quot;Toxic&quot;), and even a stab at reggae (&quot;The Hook Up&quot;).  Britney seamlessly melds them all onto one CD without making it seem ridiculous.  <br />I think the song that will become the most underrated is the ballad &quot;Everytime&quot;...I know that a lot of people will think of the idea of a Britney ballad and immediately chuckle (and after &quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman,&quot; who can blame them?), but &quot;Everytime&quot; is a standout track (rumoured to be about Justin Timberlake himself).  Its beautiful lyrics (&quot;Everytime I try to fly, I fall / Without my wings, I feel so small / I guess I need you baby...&quot;) and melody (the opening chords of the song continue to stay with me and haunt me days after I first heard it) were co-written by Brit herself and deserve a listen, and so does the rest of the CD.
B0000E1WKE|4.0|Whitney is back and her voice is pretty strong.  Stand-outs are O Holy Night and The Christmas Song.  She's missing her upper register, but all-in-all, probably the best holiday CD out there right now.

Although, there are some differences in sound from the original LP's and I think I prefer the LP versions.  But, mostly the sound is great.<br />With these remasters, Rhino has used up every possible second on the CD with bonus material, so they are all 80 minutes long.  What I like is that there is a least a 10 second pause between the original material and the bonus material.<br />American Beauty has the worst bonus material of all the Rhino releases.  The bonus material starts out with the single version of Truckin'.  I just get done listening to the fantastic full length version of Truckin'.  I don't want to hear the edited version directly after that.  There are a few other worthless single versions.  Then there are live versions of the tracks on the album.  They feature a very stripped down, laid back sound.  They are interesting to hear, but nothing special.  The versions on Europe 72 are much better.<br />If you already have American Beauty in some form, this remaster is not worth getting.  There are remasters of other albums you should get before this one.  If you don't already own a copy of American Beauty, this is one the Dead albums that is a must have.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is all the hook! Every song has a different flavor and all are great for the clubs. My favorite songs are &quot;Breathe on Me,&quot; &quot;Toxic,&quot; &quot;Outrageous,&quot; and &quot;The Hook Up.&quot; BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LOVE HIP-HOP, RNB, AND POP!!! Moby  and R. Kelly do amazing jobs as producers. BRAVO BRITNEY!!!
1573301183|5.0|This was a great DVD. I have watched it several times, and still enjoy it. Layne's voice wasn't nearly as powerful as it once was, but it fits the show perfectly. It's great to hear him belt out &quot;Would?&quot; and &quot;Rooster.&quot; &quot;Down in a hole,&quot; in my opinion, was the best song mainly because of Layne and Jerry's voices feeding off one another so harmoniously. It's unfortunate what happened to the band in the years following this performance, but at least we got the performance?? I also recommend the Music Bank DVD...it was put together nicely. <br />AIC Unplugged - Simply a must have for any Alice in Chains fan...
B00008PW2D|1.0|Like everybody else, I enjoy the show. I went ahead and bought seasons 2-4.  But I saw 2 season 5 episodes (or 1 whole 3rd of the entire season for you math students out there) and they were the worst episodes of Sex and the City I've ever seen.  I still would have considered dropping $15 on a 2 disc set just to catch up on the story lines, but $32 (ON SALE) or $4 per sub-par episode? You've gotta be kidding me! if I have money to burn I MIGHT pay $4 to rent the whole thing from my video store, but that's about it.  Here's what I'd like to see with Season 6: A 3-4 disc DVD collection that's actually worth the *$30-$40* price tag because A. the discs are packaged in something other than cheap plastic that completely falls apart the third time you open it, and B. it actually has \\"extras\\" on the discs that you couldn't get anywhere else.  And when I say \\"extras\\", I mean something more than 4 episode commentaries by the always enthralling Michael Patrick King.  For example, the latest Simpsons DVD had more discs than any SATC release and commentary by Matt Groening, writers, directors and at least 2 cast members on EVERY EPISODE, and I STILL paid less for it than my SATC dvds.  I'm sure they could also find outtakes, gag reels, and other material that would be of interest to us fans to include.  I think even the most loyal fan should avoid buying this set and encouraging HBO to continue this ignorant brand of customer service.
B000001IQH|5.0|Several years ago I was a huge fan of punk music but over the years my interest in the music quickly diminished because I got fed up with the holier-than-thou attitudes from the Maximum Rock 'N Roll crowds and hearing the same ol' song be rehashed over and over. One of my favorite cds from those days was \\"And Out Comes the Wolves\\". There was something edgy to the music that is sorely lacking in the garbage I am hearing nowadays (i.e Good Charlotte). Unfortunately Rancid was subjected to endless comparisons to the legendary punk band The Clash and to a certain extent you can hear The Clash in songs like the reggae-influenced \\"Time Bomb\\" and \\"Roots Radical\\". I must admit that I bought this cd (back in the mid-'90s) when I would hear songs like \\"Ruby Soho\\" and \\"Roots Radicals\\" over and over. I almost forgot just how good \\"And Out Comes the Wolves\\" until I threw the disc in this evening. It is an album just chockful of melodic yet blistering punk music. There isn't one song on this album that I didn't like. Of all the songs on this cd, I must say that \\"As Wicked\\" is my favorite non-single track on the album. The production by Jerry Finn is the perfect example how punk albums should be produced...loose and raw. Bands such as Good Charlotte and Blink 182 are nothing more than boy bands with guitars and wearing clothes from the Goodwill. Their music is overly polished and lacks the edginess that bands like Rancid and The Clash has/had. \\"And Out Come the Wolves\\" is a masterpiece.

B0000DJE9R|5.0|Michael Jackson is still the King of Pop, and this collection of hits proofs it. My favorite song on the Cd had to be the live version of BEN. I loved it. It almost sounds like he is thaking us. And it is a very beautiful song. I recommend this Cd 100%!
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Ever since movies started being transferred to DVD, this is the one I was waiting for. And boy, did I wait. And it sure was worth waiting for. I can't express enough my excitement of having this DVD finally. <br />This is a great transfer. Images are crisp and clear. You can even see the details of the back lit Mitten Buttes of Monument Valley. Now, you can kiss goodbye to the VHS tape you had for years.<br />When I saw \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" for the first time, I was 14. Seeing Cardinale's buggy cross Monument Valley made me shed tears. It's such stunning beauty! I could feel Leone's deep affection to the western in this scene. This is his homage to John Ford and all western movies. <br />There are not so many directors who know how to use wide screen effectively. In Leone's films, space seems to expand to form massive cosmos. No other director could perform this type of magic (perhaps with an exception of David Lean). <br />This is a movie that deserves the word \\"masterpiece\\" in every sense. And this is an utmost form of film as art. The tempo throughout the movie is meticulously calculated. Camera movement and editing are extremely creative and cinematic. Morricone's haunting music flows with the images (I don't hesitate to say Jill's theme is the most beautiful music on earth). Dialogue is limited to optimize its dramatic effect and superbly well written. Movements of actors are deliberately slow and stylish. Carlo Simi's art direction for set and costume designs plays a great role also to help Leone's perfectionism and realism. <br />This is not just the best spaghetti western. Some dare to say this is the best western ever made. And so do I. <br />Three documentaries on the second disc are wonderful treat to Leone fans. Through numerous interviews, you can learn how \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" was started and how it was produced. Very briefly, you can see Leone himself in one of the documentaries. My only regret is that other key people like CharlesBronson, Jason Robards, Ennio Morricone and Sergio Donati were not interviewed. <br />One of the noteworthy special features is Location Gallery. I'd like to thank Don Bruce for contributing valuable photos of locations used for \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" to make comparisons to actual scenes in the film.<br />This is one great DVD made with passion to reflect diehard Leone fans' never-ending love for this monumental film.
B0000DJZA0|4.0|This album is great. I love watching the lead sing his heart out to these inspireing lyrics. Style sounds simmilar to REM and U2, but the songs speak for themselves. DVD quality, good selection of songs. I question anyone that denies this band's originality, this is a disc worth watching; the live cd is icing on the cake. Buy it, try it, u'l love it.
B000006MS3|5.0|My favourite album by my favourite singer. Kate Bush, where are you now that we need you - in other words, now that Celine Dion has taken absolute control of the airwaves? On this, Kate's most rewarding album precisely because it's her most &quot;difficult&quot;, every track takes you to a different area of her ever-exploring mind. No safe pop fodder here - in fact, none of these tracks ever received airplay in South Africa. Boldly pushing back boundaries to show how broad her musical vision had become via her three previous albums, Kate offers ten diverse stories laced with lyrical and instrumental innovation. It starts with a bang and ends with one, with no dull patches in-between. It was a commercial failure in comparison to her previous releases, but then again so what - the Spice Girls were a commercial success.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Fantastic, wonderful, beautiful, can listen it to all day.
B00006BTCA|5.0|It is a great listen.  I get a distinct &quot;mood&quot; when I listen to it, and I can listen to it all the way through.  Two pre-requisites for a great CD.  Rather than being a music snob spouting about how lame the band is because they may sound like other past bands, I'm rating them on their own merits.  Just because I loved Joy Division, doesn't mean I can't really enjoy this disc as well.  And no, if a band that put out a disc that I could listen to all the way through and walk away with a good feeling wounded a bit like Pearl Jam, I wouldn't come here b****ing about &quot;grunge poseurs&quot;.  Come on, grow up.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is back!!!<BR>She has done it again with this special.  Nothing flashy about it, just a talented singer and songwriter singing all her hits and new songs surely to follow.  It doesn't seem to take much for her to get you singin' and dancing along.  This DVD is what it is all about...the music.  You can never go wrong with Shania and this DVD is a must for any fan.
B00003003R|5.0|I have been to a few Gn'R concerts, including last years short tour.  This is about as close as your are going get to the \\"real thing\\". Sadly, it is a bittersweet reminder of  what could have been........<br />Just to set the record straight:  Axl did not skip a beat in his ability to perform, last year.  Aside from the obvious change in the cast of characters, you would have thought you were reliving a day when real Rock n' Roll made you bang your head and not regret it in the morning.  If another miracle happens to occur (or Axl decides he needs a couple of $$) grab the opportunity to see Gn'R.  Of course, I cannot be held resposible  if Axl decides it is a bad hair day.
B0000TB03W|5.0|I've watched this five times since I got it, and let me tell ya it's amazing. I have Shania's other DVD's too, but I just have to watch this one today before I go for the other ones.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Karma Police, arrest the reviewers who gave this alien-rock masterpiece anything short of 5 stars.<BR>Radiohead's 3rd and best album, OK Computer, is nothing short of a brilliant, illuminating work of art. A truly headphonic experience, the highest highs (&quot;Let Down,&quot; &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;) of this album will make your heart and soul soar in epileptic, robotic happiness. Conversely, the lowest lows (&quot;Climbing Up the Walls,&quot; &quot;Lucky&quot;) will make your skin shrivel up in goose-pimpled fright. Meanwhile, the stale apathy of songs like &quot;No Surprises&quot; will freeze your heart to the core and make you cry tears of utter sadness and loss. On the very first listen, &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; will give you the strange yet undeniable impulse to simultaneously weep uncontrollably and violently smash everything in your household. The computerized &quot;boops&quot; that precede that manic war of a song will become your most favorite random noise of all-time, guaranteed. Furthermore, the subtle, quiet beauty of &quot;Airbag&quot; and &quot;The Tourist&quot; will, at the beginning and end of the album, respectively, provide both the question and the inevitable answer that lies at the heart of this incredible concept album. Never before has an album essentially about unfeeling cyborgs emitted so much raw emotion and humanity. A true masterpiece.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|DT is my favorite band and the epitome of prog rock today. But this CD is disappointing. The lyrics are angry, which is okay if it is cohesive like the 2nd CD of Six Degrees). DT has always been melodic, challenging and awe inspiring. Most of the album is derivitive of nu-metal. Very little melody, muddy sound, too much use of &quot;telephone&quot; voice, intricate guitar parts are extremely self indulgent and lacking soul. &lt;sigh&gt;
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie was truly a must have in my household.To me this is a great family film that age is no issue.My little one loves this movie with wide eyes and with great joy,which in turns makes me very happy just to watch my child so involved and interested it makes me wonder what is my baby thinking at those touching moments in the movie.Again just a terrific film.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Keep an open mind when you listen to this, Britney has done something new here. For the most part, this is not a pop album, instead it is much more hip hopish with a club beat, which will attract a somewhat different audience. If you prefer pop, you may want to skip ahead to \\"Brave New Girl\\" (a catchy song) and \\"Everytime\\" (a nice ballad she wrote herself, which would be even better if she sang out a little more). The rest of the album is very beat oriented and flows well from one song to the next. \\"(I Got That) Boom Boom\\" is a little obnoxious, but seems to be stuck in my head. I like the next 4 tracks \\"Showdown\\", \\"Breathe On Me\\", \\"Early Mornin'\\", and \\"Toxic\\". The album puts you in a groove. There are no serious subjects here until near the end of the album, it is not meant to enlighten anyone with deep thoughts, instead it is fun and sexy, and it works. She has succeeded in coming up with a new, older sound and has proven that she has some versatility. It makes me wonder what she will do next. She's a smart woman.
0676973779|5.0|I read Life of Pi last month and fell in love with it. It is an amazing story. I was pulled into the world of Pi and loved it! Martel creates a very realistic character that you can't help to love. <BR>The story made me laugh out loud and cry. The adventure Pi goes through is amazing. <BR>This book would make a great Christmas present. I plan on getting it for quite a few people. <BR>I'm actually sad to hear that they are making a movie about this novel. I just don't see how a movie could recreate the scenes that Martel describes. <BR>Amazing book, you won't be dissapointed.

0780020685|5.0|If the title seems to be hyperbole, I should point out that it's not just my opinion, but the opinion of almost all movie critics.  This movie is on many top-ten-movies-of-all-time lists, for good reason.  For many years, this movie was seen only in a shortened form, but Criterion has restored it to its original cut as first released.  Not only that, but it has included a superb commentary that was so good that after I watched the DVD for the first time without commentary, I started to watch it with the commentary thinking I would spend a few minutes and was so fascinated that I watched the whole movie again just to find out what the commentator had to say!  And this is a long movie, over 3 hours long, but it doesn't drag.  <br />The basic story (ripped off by the inferior U.S. remake, The Magnificent Seven) is pretty straightforward.  Bandits attack a village and take its crops and some of its women.  When the villagers learn that the bandits plan to return, the decide to hire itinerant samurai to defend it, with the only pay being room and board.  They find a remarkable samurai as the leader, and he recruits the other six, including an expert swordsman who lives for his art (the actor who played this part had never handled a sword before this movie, and never did learn to ride a horse!), and a crude bumbler (played by star Toshiro Mifune)  who is actually a farmer's son pretending to be a samurai.  Incidentally, Mifune was originally considered for the part of the expert swordsman, a role which he played brilliantly in two other Kurosawa movies, Yojimbo - the basis for Clint Eastwood's hit A Fistful of Dollars, and Sanjuro.  But this is no simple good versus evil story.  Even though the villagers have hired the samurai, they don't trust these &quot;heroes&quot;, and hide all their women.  And it appears that in the past the villagers may have killed other samurai and hidden their armor - when the samurai discover this, they are not sure they can trust the villagers either.  This ambiguity adds depth to the story.  All this is gradually revealed as the remainder of the film shows the samurai training the villagers, attacking the bandits to cut down their numbers, and finally, after a few skirmishes, having the climactic battle scene in the driving rain and mud, which captures the chaos of battle as well as anything ever done in the movies.  Unlike most movies where the battle scenes always seem to be staged, with the big explosion center screen and nothing much else going on, Kurosawa seems to embed you right in the action so you feel as if it is going on, not just in front of you, but all around you, off- screen as well as on. This is great movie-making, and the commentary explains how he achieved this effect.  And at the end, the villagers go back to rice planting, and the samurai &quot;heroes&quot; stand to one side - no triumphal banquet and procession for them.  Now that their job is finished, they are ignored.<br />As I mentioned, even though the film is long, it doesn't drag, because Kurosawa omits unneccessary exposition.  One example, early on after one of the samurai is killed in battle, we have a burial scene.  Mifune's character, in grief, grabs a battle flag made by the dead samurai, runs on top of one of the huts in the village and defiantly plants it on top of the roof. The camera then pans up to the hills beyond the village, where we see the bandits descending to attack the village.  In a few seconds the mood changes from grief to exhilaration as the long awaited battle is joined.  <br />On the other hand, Kurosawa also includes images which, although not strictly necessary to the main narrative line, will remain with you long after the movie is over.  An example, at one point the samurai locate the bandit's hideout, and set fire to it to force the bandits out.  As the samurai look into the hideout, they see a woman, captured by the bandits.  In a silent scene, except for a lone flute playing plaintively on the soundtrack, this woman awakens, sees the fire off-screen, starts to cry out, then decides to remain silent, even though it means she will die a horrible death.  The usual martial arts movie would never even consider having a scene like this, but this short, wordless scene speaks eloquently about this nameless woman's condition and deepens the story.  It is little touches like this that linger.<br />Martial arts movie with incredible battle scenes, character study, social commentary, as with all great art, there are a lot of different ways you can view this movie.  At the time he made it, Kurosawa said he wanted to revitalize the samurai sword movie, which he considered a dead form.  He did more than that - he transformed it!  A lot more could, and has, been said about this movie, but bottom line:  Nobody who loves movies should miss this - it is essential!
B0000E1WNV|1.0|Couldn't wait to get DVD, ripped the cover open, and......not good.<BR>Video is decent, audio is almost unlistenable.  This product is bootleg quality. I will probably send it back.
B00005UEAR|5.0|This album took a while for me to get into, but once I was in it, I loved it.  I didnt care for 'The Glass Prison' much until I saw it live, and ever since, I've been hooked.  The 2nd and 3rd tracks are really good also.  The 4th and 5th arent too great, but still Dream Theater's style nonetheless.  I would buy a single just of The Glass Prison, Blind Faith, and Misunderstood.  However, the 2nd cd comes on with the 6th track, '6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence', which is another concept album.  The song is divided into 8 parts, and all of them are great, and LaBrie's voice is very emotional throughout it all.  The concept cannot compare to Metropolis Pt. 2, but its great nevertheless.  Buy this now if you havent already!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney Spear's latest album, In The Zone, is new, funky and hip with new genres of music. This album is way far like her previous teen-boppy hits, but instead shows another side of the ex-virgin. This album is mostly full of fun and up-beat, sexy club songs. Some songs, like \\"Toxic\\", is a real good good to get up and dance to. Another called, \\"Hookup\\", shows a little reggae in it and its a fun song to listen to. I think the best song on the album is track number two, \\"(I got that) Boom Boom.\\" This song, I gurantee, will be a hit when she releases it as her next single. The Ying Yang Twins added their flavor to the song and it came out excellent. Theres also a ballad \\"Everytime\\" in which Britney is talking how she is lonely and still wants to be with her ex-lover (Justin Timberlake) and says she is sorry for what she might have done and needs him in her life. Overall, I think the money spent on these 13 songs is well worth it and I think Britney Spears is at her best with In The Zone. Go get it, well worth it.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is by-far the best Britney cd i have heard. I am a big fan of catchy dance beats and this cd has tons of them! Granted the slower songs on the cd im not loving, but everything else is awesome! My favorites songs are showdown, toxic and the hook up. I would definatly recommend this cd!!!
B0000E1WKE|1.0|All past accomplishments behind us, Whitney's voice is no where near the caliber that it used to be and this album is just a sad attempt to regain her fan basis since her last album flopped. I can't believe she would release this sounding an absolute wreck.<br />&quot;The First Noel&quot; &amp; &quot;O Holy Night&quot; are the only tracks on here that are tolerable. Besides that Whitney ruins gorgeous classics such as &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;I'll Be Home for Christmas&quot; &amp; &quot;Little Drummer Boy&quot;. The album's sole new single &quot;One Wish&quot; is awful and one that showcases Whitney's new lack of talent.<br />Skip this album, it is a complete waste of money and one of the most depressing albums in the world (because Whitney's gorgeous vocal talents are gone). I used to think the worst thing that ever happened to Whitney was her marrying Bobby Brown, but I retract that statement, cuz this is the worst.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Once again, Peter Jackson has outdone himself with the Special Extended DVD Edition of THE LORD OF THE RINGS:  THE TWO TOWERS. Besides the original nearly three hour film, this edition includes just over 43 minutes of footage that was not shown in the original cinematic release.  I realize why some of the scenes were not included in the movie, but some of the other ones I just don't understand: they add such depth to the movie and make it better than it was. Since the series has been such a success, I don't think audiences would have minded at all to have 15 or 20 minutes of these deleted scenes in the original release since it flushes out the film and characters so much more.<br />Anyway, if you sit down and watch all of the extras included with this set, it will take you about 2 1/2 weeks to get through it.  There are four commentaries to accompany the film, thirteen documentaries, maps, thousands of images and stills and sketches, and a whole lot more.  For around $30, it is more than worth the price and makes a great gift for any LORD OF THE RINGS fan.  Here's to the journey!
0385504209|2.0|Very disappointing political/religious thriller based on a controversial and intriguing hypothesis. A predictable plot line with just a few surprising turns had me to the point of dropping the book altogether several times. Very weak support for some of the, potentially, juicier claims and total ignorance of the inner workings of the Roman Catholic Church.<br />For anyone interested in the subject I would much rather recommend &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail&quot; which - despite its sensationalistic treatment of the matter - does indeed raise some interesting questions.
B00009RDG9|3.0|From the first frames of this interesting and somewhat offbeat movie, I found myself fascinated by the setting in the snow-graced forests of the Pacific northwest, where retired government martial-arts and assassin training expert Tommy Lee Jones walks with both grace and purpose through the winter splendor of the chilly landscape. However unlikely the action as depicted in the scenes, it was a marvelous set of opening scenes, providing a key insight into the lead character's humanity and perspective. Little would I know that this was perhaps the most satisfying aspect of this taut suspense thriller.  Lee is soon whisked away almost involuntarily to help solve a pair of horrific murders of seasoned and well-armed hunters in the area, only to discover the assailant was one of the expert assassins he helped train. From there the mystery begins to deepen, and Lee finds himself locked into a death struggle on a number of levels both with the assassin, played well by the charismatic Benico Del Toro.<br />Del Toro's character is haunted by memories of atrocities he witnessed in Kosovo, and his former government handlers are trying to convince Lee that Del Toro has simply gone renegade. Yet there are signs that there may be some truth to Del Toro's suspicions, as told to Lee indicating that he had been set up, that the hunters he executed in the forest were in fact government assassins come to terminate him. The viewer is taken on a whirlwind ride through forest, suburb, and through a variety of cityscapes, and a few of the chase scenes are entertaining, amusing, and quite ingenuous. The plot sometimes suffers from more bullet holes than any of Del Toro's victims, but if you can suspend your critical faculties enough to enjoy the fireworks, you will likely enjoy this potboiler effort at government intrigue gone horribly wrong. Enjoy!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|the album will take some getting used to. phil spector did an admirable job considering the task he had before him (plus he was the premier producer of his day). the plain fact is this was supposed to be a completely stripped down record. the band worked dilligently to learn all new songs, rehearse them and eventually perform them live as the show stopping segment for the film of the same name. the album used to have a friendly vibe to it with all of the in between song chatter that was featured. parts where you are expecting to hear a sardonic remark by lennon, or some encouraging comment by paul you dont hear anymore. unfortunately that did help to ease the listener's aural experience. its a bit like re-learning how to read and write after they have changed the whole alphabet. hopefully in time this will replace the album we came to know. i always personally felt there was much more potential for the album. they should never have messed with the winning formula which was to have george martin perform all production duties.  keep in my mind that every member of the beatles had a problem with the final version of let it be. lennon, harrison and starr were the later converted. paul from the very beginning. the songs sound more crisp, less muddled and hearing a song like long and winding road sans orchestra is almost a breath of fresh air. i am glad they decided to \\"revive\\" let it be, finally this album will stand aside the likes of abbey rd and white album as one of their best. paul might get slammed for his efforts to reboost let it be but i applaude him for being so daring and sticking with the plans for the album that was supposed to be released.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Wow, the big guy is really back, at long last. But this bang-em-up sequel to the sequel was well worth the wait. It is not exactly Academy Award winning stuff, but then again, we are talking about the Terminator here. Sometimes it's a bit hard to find the big guy amid all the pyrotechnics, explosions, and spectacular truck crashes, but Arnold is definitely back! One thing I find amusing, however, is that the basic cybernetic model Arnold plays keeps getting slimmer with each film, but since the original version was likely easier to spot as a machine due to its incredible bulk and muscularity, maybe such a revised this model could blend into human company and pass without being detected. So perhaps the machine makers reconfigured its armature as they went along, explaining AHNOLD's progressively slimmer physique in each film.<br />Anyway, I defy anyone to show me another 55 year old who is this buffed, this muscular, and this awesome! And in the Terminator movies, what really counts here is the combination of special effects and terrific action sequences, which certainly is where the producers have invested most of the effort, energy, and funding. And while I personally was not as impressed with this effort as I was with the superb production values evident in T-2, there is no doubt that this roller coaster ride of an action flick, which includes an eye-popping and heart-pumping sequence with fire trucks racing through the city streets, will enjoy a wide audience and have a lot of success just based on such pyrotechnics. Yet, having said this, in some ways the only continuity with the first two terminator films is the presence of the big guy himself. In this sense it is less a sequel than it is another episode in the Terminator series, and there is a difference.<br />The story is set ten years after the closing of the second movie, with John Connor (played here by Nick Stahl) now a young adult living on the margins of society to avoid detection, existing without an apartment, a telephone, or credit cards. He finds himself being hunted by the T-X, the most advanced model of the Terminator series, a prototype designed with cutting-edge capabilities including being disguised as a female. The T-X is superbly underplayed by the fetching Kristana Lokken, being programmed as a murder machine that dispatches anyone it comes across en route to its intended prey, the clever young John Connor. Enter our boy AHNOLD, an obsolete T-101 model originally programmed as a hunter-killer, but now sent back to rescue Conner so he can prevent his murder so he can survive to become the adult who somehow keeps sending Arnold back to rescue him. Got it?<br />AHNOLD must also save the comely young Kate Brewster, an old friend of John's who The T-101 has been programmed to recognize as an older Conner's future main squeeze. Kate is played well by the ever more attractive Claire Danes, who has a terrific future in the film industry, never mind with young John Connor. So the stage is set for yet another protracted series of uneven battles between the mismatched terminator models, with the T-101 attempting to fend off the T-X while keeping the two youngsters alive in the process. As with the previous movies, there are wonderful one-liners, and some gutter humor that we find ourselves laughing along with despite our better natures. I enjoyed the tongue-in -cheek repartee, which is often witty and funny, and this adds a valuable dimension to this film so often missing from other action-fantasy films. All in all, this is a great evening's entertainment. After all, he told us he'd be back! Enjoy!apartment, a telephone, or credit cards.

B00005JLF5|4.0|The DS9 series was a bold step into the unknown. It is true that people did not really travel away from the station , and the neighbors were restless , but it was those uncertanties that did make DS9 a good series. Not every episode ended with happiness and not all problems were solved in 45 minutes like the other series did. There were more background elements that made this series more real and to me more enjoiable to watch. DS9 may not have been the best sci-fi series out there at the time , but it was a lot better that most and in the long run I think that it could turn out to have been the best of all the Star Trak series.
0790744295|5.0|I doubt a truer ad line was ever concocted.  Back when it was made, Creepshow was a serious happening.  The world's bestselling horror writer and the respected and fiercely independent director of two icons of horror cinema [Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead] had joined forces to make a horror movie.  Needless to say, more than a few stars were willing to take a trip out to The Burg for the honor of getting rubbed out by zombies, crate monsters, weeds, or cockroaches.  King's script (his best in my opinion) is simplistic as a comic should be and Romero's direction is highly stylized (great care was taken to give the sets a simplistic look, as if they could be drawn instead of photographed), thus making Creepshow one of that last truly great anthology horror movies.  No fan of King, Romero, or horror movies should be without a copy.  Highly recommended.
B00000DC7J|5.0|Wow.  This is kind of music that can be only created by someone who's live a lifetime of love and joy, regret and sorrow.  This is the music of being human.  I don't know how else to describe it except that listening to this album was a transcendental experience.  I hope you will give this album a shot because you will be doing a travesty to yourself if you don't.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Amazing cd!!! After years of waiting you don't know how much you truly miss something until you hear it return.  This album is beautifully orchestrated with musical hints of Sarah's early sounds like on cd's Touch &amp; Solace.  If you're new to Sarah you'll think this cd is a little slow because it doesn't have the more rock/pop-oriented sound that Surfacing had, but there's a nice balance of everything on this cd.  Welcome back Sarah!!!!!
0385504209|5.0|In his book, &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, Dan Brown has integrated many levels of mystery and puzzle solving, intertwined with suspense and murder. Add the secrecy, spanning hundreds of years, that surrounds various individuals and groups, and you have a magnificent page-turner of a book.<br />The 454-page book is comprised of a prologue, 105 chapters, and an epilogue. The chapters are short and usually end with a compelling urge to continue reading the next, and the next, and the next, etc. &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is a fast read because you won't want to put it down.<br />Da Vinci -- what a clever fellow!
B00005JKN9|2.0|I give the DVD set high marks for including the Discovery Channels story of the New York gangs.  I also credit the film for what seems to have been an effort to infuse historical accuracy in the characters and atmosphere of those times.  But, I dont understand why the movie was split between 2 disks, why it was as long as it was, or why anyone still thinks that DiCaprio can act?  <br />Daniel Day Lewis performance was excellent.  Scorsese would have done well with more subtlety and editing.  Apparently, he believes that viewers are too dumb to connect the dots on our own.  The blood scenes are stomach turners, and the sex orgies were gratuitous.  The scenes of prayer before the climatic violence was lifted out of the Godfather, and Cameron Diaz looked too clean and pretty for a character from that neighborhood.  I liked one reviewers attempt to analogize the plot to Hamlet, but DiCaprio lacked any of the Hamlet inner turmoil.  Overall, it was only satisfactory and not one that I will revisit.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Why do people keep making such a big deal over talentless performers like this?  Does anyone honestly think they'll be listening to Britney Spears in 10 years or care who she's dating?  It's the shamless promotion of people like this that denies legitimate musicians their chance to be heard.  Thank God for the Internet where you can find true up and coming artists.  <br />Attention Record Companies!  Quit crying over people trying to download music from the Internet.  Maybe if you offered up some decent music people would start buying CD's again and maybe even pay $$$$.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Yes, I liked \\"Me against the music\\". (I liked it, but not loved it). But the other materials on this album is not strong enough.<BR>There are some tracks which tried to copy the style of Beyonce's \\"Baby Boy\\", and there are some tracks that copy the style of Kylie Minogue , and there's even a track which sounds like an old Madonna song \\"BRAVE NEW GIRL\\". But none of these are memorable, and Britney's voice is not good enough to make these songs her own. And the whole album sounds way too monopolous for it to be interesting. And the whole album is just about sex and dance, is this what adulthood is all about? As I read from another person's review, \\"it is fine to do an album about sex and dance, but if you're doing one, at least make this fun.\\"But Britney way too serious about these sex and dance messages. Britney voice will never be sexy as Toni Braxton or Kylie Minogue, if so, then why try to be sexy? Britney is trying to be sexy, that she forgot real sexiness comes from deep inside, rather than from trying to dress and pretend to sound like one.<br />And the only two ballads on this album is not touching my hearts either. These two songs are just too pretentious, and predictable for my liking.<br />No, \\"In the zone\\" is not a complete disaster. It is at least much better than her last album \\"BRITNRY\\", which includes laughable songs like \\"I love rock and roll\\". Britney really tried to have a theme and style with \\"In the zone\\", and this I will give credit to her. But her voice does not match this style of music, and rather than copy the styles of other artists, Britney should really figure out her own style. There are just not enough memorable tracks on this album.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is by far Her best. All I can say is buy it! Even if you weren't really a Brittany fan before, this is a must buy. Her new sounds are excellent and her beats are fun. If i must compare this to something i would compare it to 80's Madonna, upbeat, fun and very sexy!!!
B000002UHG|2.0|with the album having much in common with the Division Bell (age, musicians, sleeve art  etc) i was expecting it to be like the Division Bell, which it isn't, with the obvious exception of Coming Back To Life. When it works it is fabulous, but this only comes in spurts: the guitar solo on Along the Shoreline, Sinead O'Conner on Breakthrough. There are few songs which are classics, yet musicianship and production values often lift them above the ordinary. It is th production that so often marrs the album, though. Night of a Thousand Furry Toys is a horrid with dated dance beats and embarassing lyrics (Wright can't seem to bring himself to sing the chorus). It is a song that seems like a joke , yet the album is entirely without humour, and the album never really recovers from this track. It's only in the less gloomy momens that the album picks up, and these are few and far between. A real mess, whilst still hinting at greatness.
B000006SBY|5.0|Bryan Adams is my #1 fave singer and I love all of his songs equally.  So in my bias opinion, all of his songs are the best.  However, propably only die hard fans should get this album.  I have it on both CD and LP and I love it.

Fergie, even though she should be called Jamie) is so the new Britney Spears/Xtina version 2.5, or least she should be.  Fergie is illin' always chillin' and definitely helping make the BEP sound mainstream.  The shut up video needs to be on TRL and bumping in all your SUVs with 22s.  The cd is consistently good, eclectic, and multi-faceted.  Definitely a &quot;listen-all-the-way-through&quot; cd.
B00003XB8K|5.0|If you own all of the Enigma cds, you will notice subtle changes between each one.  MCMXC a.D. is full of chants, drums, flutes, and just has that gothic, yet spiritual feel to it.  The Cross of Changes has more of a pop beat to it, but still has elements of the the first.  Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi, seems to be the product of MCMXC a.D. and The Cross of Changes.  It combines gothic and pop, if that's how you would like to word it, plus the trademarks of Enigma, such as the chants and flutes.  Each of these three cds flow into one another, but when comparing the first to the third, there's a MAJOR difference.  This is where the fourth comes in.<BR>The Screen Behind the Mirror wasn't the result of Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi flowing into it.  Although it has some of the basic elements of the Enigma music, The Screen Behind the Mirror is almost its own sub-category in Enigma's music.  It turned from flutes to electric guitars, yet it still of course had some flutes and chants, but not like the earlier cds.<BR>The Screen Behind the Mirror, just like Voyageur, is somewhat controversial amongst Enigma fans.  This cd hinted that the Enigma everyone knew and loved was changing and evolving into something new.  It was straying away from your typical Enigma sound and feel.  Listening to the first three cds, the music paints a picture of being at a temple or in the middle of a monk sancturary or in about any nature wonderland you can think of.  The Screen paints a nigthlife scene in a European city into your mind.<BR>And that was just the beginning.  When LSD came out, the two new songs, The Landing and Turn Around, as good as they are, are not early Enigma.  You can obvisiouly tell that Cretu made a turn down a different road and was intending to stay on it.  So is this a road full of potholes and mud or a road of smooth pavement?  Defiantly not potholes, but not quite smooth pavement.  There are patches that need to be filled, but they will be.  This is defiantly a roadworth turning onto.  The Screen Behind the Mirror is the conclusion to the first half of Enigma's music.  It's still as wonderful as the other cds, just something different.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|Let It Be - Naked is what original long time Beatles fans always wanted the first album to be. The original was good but always seemed out of place. One would go from The White Album to Abbey Road and then Let it Be. I'd play the original and after a couple of tunes put the White Album back on.....<br />Now you can hear this actually fit right in after the White Album as far as sound and song development.<br />The band sounds every bit as good as Rubber Soul - 2 of Us could have been a track on that one. One after 909 has the energy of Kansas City on Beatles VI. Across the Universe sounds now like it could have been on Lennon's Imagine album.<br />Let It Be Naked takes me back in time and it is great!!
B0000E1WKE|5.0|I have admired whitney Houston for years. Her ability to make a person feel as though they are in the song is amzing. Whitney really brings it home for the Holidays this year. She sings out of her heart. That's what this album is, from her heart. Not technical or commercial but deliver straight from the heart from one of this generation's Greastest Vocalist. Whitney really delivers. I love it!! O holy Night! DAMN She blows it UP. You'll have to hear it for your self to see what people are talking about. People are always going to have negative things to say about whitney. But again she delivers great, great music!!!<BR>She's worth all the money and more. Love you whitney. BIG UP!!
0380713802|1.0|After the author began  bragging about his lack of foreign language knowledge, I recognized a familiar type of traveller - opinionated, not interested in learning other peoples culture, ready for derision. That exactly what this book is about: derision and labeling of peoples and cities. Too bad, a city cannot sue for libel!  That's Bill Bryson's characteristic of a wonderful German city of Cologne bustling with life, very comfortable to live, with beautiful scenery, lots of public spaces, museums, a famous opera, etc.: \\"Cologne is a dismal place, with its Cathedral occupying a huge ugly square similar to an empty parking lot\\". (something like that - I listened to an audio version). Bill Bryson is so sensitive - he left Cologne in disgust after a night stay since he happened to find a pornographic shop at the train station! How ironic - considering that his book is a fine example of pornographic writing - sexual remarks in bad taste on each page. He described a bad travel companion who annoyed him by categorizing his farts - I can describe his book instead as a collection of verbal farts. Who is it written for? I can imagine someone who hates travelling (especially because of all those foreign languages), so he enjoys Bill Brysons book, and thinks: \\"How wonderful this guy saved me the trouble of seeng all those disgusting European places, with all those French and Germans who want me to obey their stupid rules!\\". But someone who is open minded and curious please don't trust this bunch of lies and distastful jokes. Go and see by yourself, or read Mark Twain if you want a funny travel book.
630575067X|4.0|A good movie about the struggle of the Queen of Naboo (Natalie Portman) to maintain the freedom and way of life of her people, against the scheming Trade Federation.<br />Reminds me of the struggle of the State of Israel, and it's courageous people, to survive against the machinations of the United Nations, European Union, Non Aligned Movement, International Media, World academia etc.<br />Portman is lovely and vivacious, with an unforgettable smile.<br />Queen Anakin refuses to abandon her people in their hour of need and stands against the powerful forces rather than yield. The two Jedi knights,played by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, aided by the and of then the over the top Jar Jar Binks (something between a dinosaur and a hippie) battle the forces of evil , .<br />But aside from Portman 's Queen Amadala, the other unforgettable character is the small boy Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) , apparently the future Darth Vader.
B000089RVR|5.0|Although it is definitely contemporary, it reminds me of <BR>classical music - it is so beautifully crafted.
0316096199|4.0|This book held me captive at night over a period of a few days, and I spent a few days sleepwalking at work as a result.  The book is Alice Sebold's true story of her struggle to find herself again after enduring a violent rape.  It is a rich story that manages to be both heartwarming and heartbreaking.  Being young and finding your path in life is hard enough, but Sebold's journey is compounded by a mother who has problems with anxiety, and then compounded further by being raped by a stranger.<br /><br />In addition to the story of how rape changed her, Sebold tells the story of where she came from and the people who shaped her.  Her personality is portrayed as complex, and her marvelous sense of humour is revealed, even despite the darkness of the book's subject matter.  My favourite illustration of this is when she plays a prank on her uptight and stodgy father while they are staying in separate beds in a hotel room.  The results of her sneaky trick are hilarious!<br /><br />The reader follows Sebold's changed version of herself as she picks us the pieces of her life in the aftermath.  She goes through the stages of grief in a way that is unique to Sebold, proving that we all cope differently when faced with a traumic event.  Sebold releases her feelings and her anger through her poetry, with the help of her friends, and yet there still remains a large sense of loss in her.  Perhaps this book was finally her vehicle to closure and healing, as is suggested in the Aftermath that follows the story.<br /><br />This book will shock you, sadden you, and yet still entertain you.  Her writing is intense and just wonderful, and I highly recommend this book.
0671027387|2.0|An interesting, well developed, fast paced plot which unfortunately is undercut by predicable and uninteresting characters. But the real problem with this thriller is that the escapades of its characters are simply not real
B0000DJZA5|2.0|Why can't Paul leave well enough alone?  This is the SECOND time - not the first - that clean versions of the Let it Be songs that Spector tinkered with have been released.  (Remember the Anthologies anyone?) The original Let it Be album didn't sound bad anyhow. Maybe it wasn't the way Paul wanted but it still sounded great.  The chatter and busking added fun and character to the album.  The title of this release is simply appalling and is singulalry the lamest thing to have the Beatles name associated with it. (\\"Anthology\\" or \\"Past Masters\\" - as lame as they are - sound like wonderful titles in comparison.) The cover art is vapid. And considering the volume of Let it Be outtakes available on bootleg, the Fly on the Wall disc is simply paltry.  So, the Beatles argued during the making of the album. Yeah, I knew that. Give me selections from the outtakes - not the darn arguments. This could have been so much more. Why not a LONGER version of \\"Dig It\\" rather than DELETING it from the album?  I want MORE Beatles stuff - not less - for god sake!! What a disappointment! I can't give the Beatles one star.  I just can't.  The music is fabulous regrdless of how much it's rehashed.  But really that's all this release deserves.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I could praise for hours on this CD.  It is absolutely amazing, it's one of the few, new artists today where you can actually hear their voice - and it's a beautiful one too!  Norah Jones' silky music and style can make anyone a poet - including me.<br />1) Don't Know Why - probably the most recognizable song on the CD, and the whole reason why I decided to buy it.  Beautiful, simple, and the kind and just makes you want to sing soulfully along... 10/10<br />2) Seven Years - this is one of my most favorite songs of all time, I almost cried as I listen to it the first time and heard the words.  It's a story whose words steal you away with their sadness and wonder.  11/10<br />3) Cold, Cold Heart - well done, although I don't believe that this an original of hers 9/10<br />4) Feelin' the Same Way - So, so well done.  It gets into a little more moving and upbeat music that just lifts you.  Extremely pleasing to the senses...it reminds me of a summer wind.  9.5/10<br />5) Come Away With Me - Obviously a good one if it's the one that's labeled for the CD itself.  Well done, although almost too slow for my taste...but never to be considered dull.  9/10<br />6) Shoot the Moon - the kind of song that you want to listen to more for the lyrics than the music...but then you realize that the music is just as interesting as the lyrics themselves.  Constantly moving and changing.  9.5/10<br />7) Turn Me On - Oh, this just made me laugh when I first heard it.  One of my favorites, it just makes you smirk the whole time.  Beautiful, although the music is a little uniform for the CD.  9/10<br />8) Lonestar - Well done, but kind of got lost in the shuffle of the others and nothing seems to pop.  8.5/10<br />9) I've Got To See You Again - alluring, and more pulsing sort of music add just that little splash of flavor that turns this into a new tune for the CD, well done.  10/10<br />10) Painter Song - Interesting lyrics, but it's slow and can get old quickly.  8/10<br />11) One FlightDown - Very cool and neat beat and music to it. Lyrics don't really seem to be anything special.  9/10<br />12) Nightingale - Awesome, beautiful, thoughtful, and makes you just want to lay out under the stars...a great great song.  10/10<br />13) The Long Day is Over - Amazing for when you are in the right mood for it, otherwise it can be extremely boring.  Especially with the first lyrcis being 'feeling tired' :-).  8/10<br />14) The Nearness of You - Interesting to listen to the lyrics here, but other than that it isn't anything too special.  But otherwise it is a nice wrap up to the whole CD.  9/10<br />--<br />The only downfall of the CD is variety.  As the title says, if you love one of these songs, you will love and and every one of them in their own way.  One or two faster played songs would be all she needed to get 5 stars.  If you want to hear some real music, real vocals, real instruments - then you must buy.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I was so nervous about this cd! Sarah's previous musical accomplishments have been so beautiful and astounding that I really didn't know what to expect with this album...but, I absolutly LOVE this cd! Sarah's voice is as powerful as ever...maybe even more emotive and breath-taking. You can tell that her life has changed personally through her music. The birth of her daughter has truly effected the way she makes music and it is a good thing. Her songs seem more raw and haunting. Fallen is probably the most &quot;radio friendly&quot; song on the album and definetly one of the best. Train Wreck and Stupid are two other more upbeat songs. ANSWER is one of the albums most starkly elegant songs. Sarah has always been in her element with just the piano and her angelic voice carrying the song and this one is no different. Seeing Sarah in Concert is an amazing experience...I would definetly reccomend seeing her live to experience just how wonderful of a performer she is. My personal favorites on this album are TIME, FALLEN, PERFECT GIRL and ANSWER. BUY THIS CD!
B0000C6E4D|5.0|The lyrics of &quot;Time&quot; are worth the price of the album.  They could stand as a written poem on their own.   Of course all the tracks are good in their own way, especially Fallen, World on Fire, TrainWreck and Time.<br />Sarah is a welcome gift in these dark ages.
B000001A3H|5.0|This is an ambitious work since Kyuss is clearly not satisfied with just playing badass stoner metal with guitars tuned as low as possible. The songs are dynamic and well-structured, the instrumental tracks are very atmospheric. It is amazing how much of their melodic gifts the band was able to display midst the crushing downtuned guitars. Stoner metal never got better than this.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|...But I actually like this cd. I don't know why, but I do. Maybe its the fact that she's showing some growth. I like it when artists turn left, when you expect them to go right. Don't get me wrong, she needs ALOT of work with her vocals and her \\"songwriting\\" is ok. But somehow everything comes together with this cd. Even her attempt to sound sexy (I had to laugh at times because she sounds like a little girl)doesn't take away from the fact that this is a good dance cd. My favorite songs are \\"Showdown\\", \\"Toxic\\" and the Kylie's rip off \\"Breathe On Me\\". Even R.Kelly writes and produce a hot song for Britney. This is a good cd to play when you are hanging out with your girls and heading to the club. Britney's best work.
B00009TB5G|5.0|40 more minutes than in the theatres! This is the movie you will want to own. Like the Empire Strikes Back, this is a brilliant middle act. Having seen it several times, it remains entertaining. The hyperkinetic cinematography is possibly the best ever filmed. Breathtaking shots. Golem has some outstanding comic moments. The battle scenes are some of the most involving and exciting. <BR>Isn't it interesting that this blockbuster hit has moral clarity and is written buy a guy named Tolkien! This looks great on DVD!
B000000OPZ|5.0|Led Zeppelin, while they've been around for a while, have been making music since the '60s. They're hardly 'modern!!!'
B0000C0FJB|5.0|THERE'S NO EXPLANATION! It's rush back on the road! Man, I was very excited to see these guys in front of me, playing that songs I've listened for a life, and never imagine that I could see that alive! Now I also can buy the live album and remember all those magic moments again! Buy it, if you're a truly Rush fan!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Generic dance with a topping of cheesey pop.<br />*Juevenile lrics<BR>*Bare minimum vocals<BR>*bad mix of genres from soft ballad to faux rap<BR>*bubble gum dance music for the older teen group<br />Not for the sophisticated listener who has an inkling about music.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Is what this album sounds like.  A lot of the times, it doesn't even sound like they're trying.  Very tame, very &quot;Let's pander to the millions of American college students that will love anything we do&quot;.  Granted, there are some exceptional moments, but a lot of time, it is more dilly-dallying and whining, and less undiluted creativity.  This is the sound of Radiohead making pop songs with chugs and twinkles and calling it experimentation.
076790592X|5.0|\\"Each night, when I go to sleep, I die. And the next morning, when I wake up, I am reborn.\\" The book Tuesdays with Morrie was written by Mitch Albom; I think it deserves a five-star rating, because the author, the old man Morrie, and a young man can hopefully help us see some of life's greatest lessons.  If the reader ever had any questions about life, they could read this book and answer your questions.  The author's intentions in this book are to reveal lessons about life, like to never give upo no matter what happens; as long as the reader keeps faith and the reader keeps giving your love things will work out.  My evaluation of this book is that it is a great lesson because it shows that people don't always have to care only for ourselves because now days that is how a lot of people are. In this book, it shows that Morrie thinks about his self last even when he is the one that is dying, since he was like that people are coming back to see and help him now.  In this book Mitch Albom had heard of Morrie and started meeting every Tuesday in his study like they did back in college.  I like it because it's one big lesson in how to live, and it was a true story.<BR> First of all, I would give this book a five-star rating because it can be a very inspirational story.  This is also a great story because even know that Morrie got Lou Gehrig's disease that he wasn't afraid of death.  Morrie was a great teacher, friend, and coach.  Even know that Morrie's illness crippled him daily he always was in great spirits.  This book deserves five stars because it just very touching.  Even know Morrie was going through this pain and debilitation of this devastating disease he was still a teacher through it all.  He some how never felt sorry for himself and was always so grateful to be surrounded by so much love.  This is one you just can't help but be touched by.  This can also show us how to interact we those around us.  It deserves such a high rating because it can very much so affect someone's life.  If can show how important a relationship or a friendship can be because Mitch experienced what it was like to have someone in there life and then have been gone.<BR> Secondly, one of the best parts of the book was when Mitch saw Morrie on TV and heard that he had this disease (ALS) so he decided to get a hold of him.  This book has so many great parts, lessons, and advices in it; right as you don't think there's no more there is.  It was very sad when Mitch was walking up to his house on that very wet and damp hearing all those things about how Morrie is not doing very well.  This book has a lot of great examples in it.  <BR> Lastly, I would recommend this book to anyone that wanted a touching and good story.  It shows that even all the pain and debilitation of this devastating disease Morrie continues to be a teacher the whole time.  He never feels sorry for himself and is always so grateful for everything that he has especially all the love that he has there.  When he was on his deathbed, he still manages to completely live life robustly and fully.  It would be so great for some people even like Mitch was because they hate death and love, and after he got done meeting with Morrie his point of view was totally different about it.  This book could change peoples view in a lot of different ways whether they think so or not.  This book should be mandatory for a lot of high school English classes.  It would be a good lesson around that age because so many things are changing in life at that time.<BR> This is why Tuesdays with Morrie would be a very good book to read and a great life's lesson.  If they made high school kids read it I guarantee that the majority of them would give it a five-star rating, would see that it is a life's great lesson, and would recommend it to other people after they read it.  This book was recommended to me and I would do the same to someone else.  There would be a lot of people that would learn and realize what friendships are all about.  One of the last things that Morrie told Mitch when he said goodbye several days before his death that they could still talk when he visited his grave. \\"You talk, I'll listen,\\" he suggested.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This is an super DVD.  Shania is a great performer and I recommend this to any music fan!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|What a significant differnce from &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; .I personaly have enjoyed every step of her carrer thus far and this is her best work yet. Having written 8 tracks relfects her feelings at this point in her life and makes the CD VERY personal and refreshing. However if you liked any of her previous releases like oops..I Did It Again you might be disapointed or rather surprised with this new release. It has a very different feel much like &quot;Erotica&quot; or &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.Once you play the first track I garuntee that you will be unableo turn it off until the last track...this album consumes you and allows you to feel, both physicaly and emotionally, what Britney felt putting into the music.Along with being very different and having a &quot;cluby&quot; feel to most of the tracks,as i said before it is very refreshing.If you are not a Britney fan I suggest you give her new sound a try...you wont be disapointed.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I think critics just enjoy saying bad things about big-hype CD's for singers like britney spears.  i mean we all know britney isnt known for her voice, so why keep picking at it? her songs are catchy and evolving to her new stage, and i think this is her best CD yet.  it has a great collection of types of songs, from trance, pop, r&amp;b, rock, slow jams, etc.  this isn't called &quot;Collection of #1 hits by Britney&quot;, so it isn't that.  but for what all other CD's are, this is a great album.  my only complaint is the album cover.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Very often, soundtracks serve as a platform for unknown artists to try out material to an audience by slipping a few moments of it into the underscoring of a movie.  Over the years, this has become such a common practice that soundtracks have become less and less popular and generally get looked over by consumers.<br />The soundtrack to &quot;Love Actually&quot; does exactly the opposite.<br />This soundtrack, which features a wide range of talent, includes some of the top names in the music industry today.  The songs, a few of which are re-makes of some of the top love ballads of all time, are a collection of pieces that, like the film itself, reflect the many facets of love.<br />Norah Jones, who has become recognized and praised by the music community world wide, graces this soundtrack with the beautiful ballad &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, a beautiful, sultry song that is so much more than its name suggests.  <br />Lynden David Hall provides a new rendition of &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot;, which he also sang in the film.  This new arrangement, which features a gospel choir, gives a new vitality to this song which will give the listener goosebumps. <br />Joni Mitchell brings vitality into the blues arrangement of &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, which is haunting in this rendition and her voice wraps itself around the lyrics of love and love lost in a way which touches the soul.<br />A particular favorite is Eva Cassidy's songbird, which is a beautiful ballad about finding love, and the powerful impact that true love can have.  Its a beautiful piece and a definite head turner.  Like many of the other ballads on this album, the song is deeply moving.<br />Don't be mistaken from this review about the substance of this album.  Although the soundtrack contains a number of slower pieces, it has a couple of up-tempo songs that are familiar and fun.  The Beach Boys &quot;God Only Knows&quot; takes listeners back to a time when these guys were a staple in the music industry, serving as a reminder why-the Beach Boys are as vital today as ever.  Kelly Clarkson (of &quot;American Idol&quot; fame) belts out &quot;The Trouble With Love Is&quot;, and demonstrates why she is the American Idol....her voice is dynamic, nailing highs and lows in the song with an inflection and skill that gives her the sound of a veteran singer, not the rookie she, in actuality, is.<br />Other talents included in this soundtrack include the Pointer Sisters with &quot;Jump (For My Love)&quot;,  Texas, Dido, and a selection from the instrumental scoring of the movie, which was mastefully written by Craig Armstrong.  <br />So whether you are looking to set a romantic atmosphere, or simply looking for a solid collection of great music, this soundtrack is a worthwhile purchase which promises many hours of listening enjoyment.  I promise you will actually love the &quot;Love Actually&quot; soundtrack.<br />Scott Kolecki
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Finally, after more than 33 years, the non orchestral arrangement of Let it Be has been released! On Nov 14, I purchased highly advertised Let it Be...Naked 2-CD set here in Japan. There was a long line to get the new set, so I knew it must be good. I must say, I was quite impressed with the sound quality, and the removal of Phil Spector's various orchestral and choir arrangements.<br />Now for the comparisons of the two albums. First of all, as many people expected, the sound quality is much better, and there is virtually none of the original tape hiss (The only exception is Disk 2, which is mostly studio chatter)<br />Now for the songs:<br />\\"Get Back\\" suffers from being cut by some 38 seconds. The Naked version of Get back is only 2:34, compared to the 3:12 original release. The song is exactly the same otherwise.<br />\\"Dig a Pony\\" is also the same, but it does not have the false start that was included on the original.<br />\\"For You Blue\\" seems to be unchanged, just much crisper, without any hiss.<br />\\"The Long and Winding Road\\" is a totally different take. The Naked version is slightly faster and without the orchestra. Some of the words have changed. The part that goes \\"Anyway, you'll never know, the many ways I've tried\\" has been changed to \\"Anyway, you've always known, the many ways I've tried. Another change in lyrics is where \\"Don't keep me waiting here\\" becomes \\"Don't keep me standing here\\" The end portion where we hear Paul say \\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\\" is not on this version. This is my favorite song on the new release.<br />\\"Two of Us\\" the song starts immediately, without the short intro that is on the original. The song itself is the same.<br />\\"I've Got a Feeling\\" sounds the same, but Paul and Johns voices have been put on the center channel now, which provides more range for the instruments.<br />\\"One After 909\\" does not sound any different.<br />\\"Don't Let Me Down\\" is a song which was not included in the original Let it Be Album from 1970. It can be found on Part Masters II. This version is different from that version. This version has not just Lennon, but the other Beatles singing as well.<br />\\"I Me Mine\\" is nearly the same. The only difference I noticed was that the stereo separation was slightly modified.<br />\\"Across the Universe\\" is now a beautiful Acoustic song, without the orchestra or choir. This is one of the best songs on the Naked release.<br />\\"Let it Be\\" is a different take. A little shorter, by maybe about 15 seconds. Paul's voice has more life to it. The organ is much more defined and louder. The backing voices of the other Beatles sound much better. The guitar solo is different, but better I think. The drums toward the end are somewhat different, but only serious Beatle fans will notice it. There is none of the orchestral arrangement from the original. This is a great song, and I think this new version is better.<br />The 2nd disk, called \\"Fly on the Wall\\" has one track, about 22 minutes in length consisting of various Twickenham sessions from 1969. This disk is a treat as it shows the Beatles attitiude in the studio where they recorded their music. I am assuming this starts Jan 1, 1969 due to everyone saying \\"Happy New Year\\" to each other. There are a few minutes of various Beatle songs such as \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" and \\"One After 909\\" It is quite humorous because you hear the Beatles talking about the song \\"One After 909\\" they talk about how they never really thought about the meaning of the lyrics in the song.<br />I don't want to spoil it, but this disk is quite great: both humorous and serious. If you listen well, you will even hear Yoko Ono laughing and speaking in the background at one moment. These various sessions show how the Beatles had arguments such as Ringo Starr's decision \\"Not to go abroad\\", and how they should all split up to do separate projects.<br />To sum it all up, this new release is exceptionally good. The best songs on the album are \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Let it Be\\", and \\"Across the Universe\\", All of the songs sound great in their new Digitally Re-Mastered and \\"naked\\" form. I hope this set receives as much success as the Beatles \\"1\\" did.<br />Enjoy the version of \\"Let it Be\\" the way it was always meant to be heard!heir new Digitally Re-Mastered and \\"naked\\" form. I hope this set receives as much success as the Beatles \\"1\\" did.  Enjoy the version of \\"Let it Be\\" the way it was always meant to be heard!
0156027321|5.0|This book kept me on edge till I finished it. A real page-turner. Being lost on a lifeboat in the Pacific is scary enough - surviving the ordeal with a carnivore on board is simply something else, especially as a kid. Was just amazed that this boy never let hope die and never let his mind stop thinking - ultimately his intellect, his efforts and his faith are what brought him ashore. A lesson for us all.
6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell takes the most common themes of Japanimation and shows it to you in a different spectrum, wide open solidly in one point of departure, from there its interpretation expands to everyone's own perception of the concept. The film essential story uncovers the elusive meaning of life by this new technological era, where everything can be assimilated by computer intelligence and political will to drain information and manipulate the spheres of power with all their generous killing for the sake of National Security, but the movie goes even further, convey modern science and method is the existentialistic question represented metaphorically by Motoko Kusanagi, in a multiplex compilation of uncertainty and doubt into the depths of artificiality. No cheap Matrix Reloaded philosophy, no free given action, just pure state of the art reflection and a resolution of the story line that is completely breathtaking, the result ends in the beginning of a new frontier of thoughts and memories.<BR>Similar at first sight with Blade Runner, but far from it's point of view and treatment, Ghost in the Shell offers both emotion and sense, with smooth and much wise touches of intellectuality expressed in a level of animation that takes this genre and style to new boundaries. The Wachowski Brother (The Matrix trilogy), took from here their visual style and blended closely in flesh and blood, but always the main source stays magnificent, becoming the standard for new projects in this field; unprecedented. <BR>Complex and beautiful, the film enters a world based on computerization of the human being, over specialization, and the unique characteristics of our personalities, the Ghost is the only thing that separates the organic real from absolute artificiality. And so, we are connected to a vast net, parallel to our own world, complex overwhelmingly by information, life multiplies responses and conducts improving it self by mechanic adjustments, man defines it's actions, but actions defines mankind, no proof of existence, where no modern science nor philosophy can't give an accurate explanation of life, a fragile state of lost conscience and greed for the objective in every aspect of life. <BR>Project 2501, becomes aware of his existence, and so targets Kusanagi for his only and last attempt to blend himself and the Mayor for the organic achievement of breeding, perhaps to fully become touch by emotions and the tragic fate of dying someday, it really doesn't matter, all for the being, away from the synthetic is the goal, anything else is unsubstantial, beneath the remains, politically it ends in a draw, individually it ends in new possibilities with never before seen points of view, a completely new life, a new born child, this is the analogy of doubt becoming answer. <BR>Mamoru Oshii directed this landmark movie, far surpassing any predecessor  (including the legendary Akira), in both animation and storyline. The graphic Japanimation style blended with computer effects, along with the smart script, created an unforgettable piece of science fiction, and most important, contributed the genre with an intellectual mood, elevating Japanimation to the highest level: an adult masterpiece. The film artistic and emotional level is magnified by an excellent original score by Kenji Kawai that perfectly matches every frame and adds more Insight and atmosphere to the story. Detail, architectural design, and colors contrasting the moods by expressing them into forms, pushes every scene to magnification and simple state of the visual manifestation, straight and solid.<BR>A great DVD, where the transferring of every image is a pleasure to watch, the 5.1 Dolby Digital sound is one of the best I've heard so far, and the Making of, illustrates clearly and in much detail the ways of such a magnificent film. This is one of those few pictures that grasp its theme and elegantly enhances it in the big screen for a mesmerizing ride. The Animatrix will be the next step in out breaking Japanimation and story line concerning science fiction, but still this are short films; no animated full length picture is at this level.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The version of \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" is incredible. The Billy Preston organ ditty that was before covered up by Spector makes this song the classic it should be. I agree with McCartney that this song should have been left alone.
0553269631|5.0|i choose this book out of many like it from my crazy english teachers list of books written in the first 50 years of the last decade. let me tell you something... if you dont want to hear it, you have no choice... i FOUGHT through this book... it took me a week of intense reading to get through it, but i am so glad that i did, because it really hit home. i have friends who attempted suicide, who are depressed , who cut themselfs... so i realize how important it is to listen. but the fact that this dude Singer had no one and they were so wrapped up in themselfs to care, made me really sad. also, i grew up in an all white country. i was never &quot;taught&quot; racism, because there just wasnt any, people were just people... and this book definetly caught me up on what i missed, and it made me feel stuff for diffrent cultures and races , and made me realize how ignorant americans really are... great read of you got time.. i, unfortunatly only had a week... presentation tomorrow... but i definetly know what to say.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The film itself (first two discs) seems great, and is a definate must buy, but on the copy I purchased the 3rd and 4th discs do not play.  They continually bounce between the 1st &amp; 2nd index markers, never showing anything but a black screen.  Trying to jump ahead does nothing.  It's as if they were indexed incorrectly.  Has anyone else had this problem?  I'll be returning the discs to Borders today to see if it's just this copy.
B0000TB03W|4.0|Amazing!!! I love this woman. She is so talented and she has come so far from her past. She has overcame so much and achieved so much. This DVD is a collector's must have. It is so great. She does some great live performances! Her vocal is good and the songs are great. Please go and get this DVD now!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As a huge fan of The Beatles, as well as well as his solo endeavors, I have been following George Harrison's career for some time.  He was truly a gentle and inspired soul who opened my mind to higher spiritual pursuits.<br />This production is a success on many levels.  It is an excellent concert featuring several of rock's legends.  It is brilliantly produced, and is somewhat reminiscent of The Concert for Bangladesh.  The spiritual/musical current of the sixties and seventies is brilliantly preserved with 21st century technology and precision.<br />This gathering of friends is NOT one of mourning, but rather, it is a celebration of the life, music, and spirit of George Harrison.  <br />George Harrison lives on through his friends, his family, his fans, his music, and most importantly, his spirit! <br />GEORGE, MAY YOU FIND PEACE AT THE LOTUS FEET OF LORD KRISHNA.<br />HARE KRISHNA!<br />johnboye777@yahoo.com
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a very sad book, but it is touching. I'm not very good at reading so I got the book on tape and followed along, reading the book for 4 hours. If I had read the book without the tape I would have been distracted and it wouldnt have been such a good experience. The book has lots of good topics that are important in life. Several things in the book made me think and look at my life. Morrie was a very special individual and his life made me want to live my life better. It made me think about lots of aspects in my life that I need to work on. I worry alot about several little things and I care about what the society thinks of me. This book made me realize that those things are not important. I always wondered what was the most important thing in life and with the help of this book, I realized it was love. Love is such an amazing gift and it is so important in life. Morrie said that if you dont love then you die. If a person has love in their life then they will be so much happier. Morries words on death also made me think. His idea of \\"once you learn how to die then you learn how to live.\\" This really made me think too. He was so strong when he was dying and he was so positive. This book just made me think about so many things and realize that Morrie was so right. It changed my life in a good way! I would deffinitely recommend everyone to read this book!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|This is definitely a new sound for Britney.  I have all of her other CDs, and this one is TOTALLY different from the others.  It's not in a bad way.  I can't even say which one is the best, because they all sound like totally different artists.  'In The Zone' is really a more risque CD than her others.  She gets a lot more personal on this album, for sure.  I like 'Britney' better than 'In The Zone', but it's a very good dance/workout CD.  'I Got That (Boom Boom)' is probably one of my favorites on the album.  I like the Hip-Hop feel of it.  'Toxic' is kind of an eerie sounding track, but it's very fun.  A good song to dance to when you're bombed.  Overall though, the album doesn't even sound like the &quot;Britney&quot; we all know.  Give it a chance, and you may just like it!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying, I don't have anything against Britney Spears.  I like a lot of her music, I think she's expressing herself as a young artist, and she's really no better or no worse than most of what is on the scene in young female pop stars.  Each one of them has their own issues, Britney has hers, but I believe Britney is having a hard time finding her place as an adult music artist.<br />The album is somewhat near the middle of what I'd called average/good (3.5 stars).  Britney's voice has changed some or either it's the product of over-production in the studio (which isn't uncommon these days, see Jessica Simpson's In this Skin).<BR>Much of the music sounds familiar and somewhat duplicated from other artists (a little Madonna &quot;Ray of Light&quot; here, a little bit of Pink/No Doubt type songs, etc.).  Obviously, much of it plays to the Euro/Asian fanbase--heavy techno beats, bubblegum poppy lyrics.  But, somewhere along the way in the album, you have to wonder--is Britney lost?  There's a lack of consistency in what she's singing here.  <br />Better songs on the album--Breathe on Me, Touch of My Hand (I get what she's singing about, but there's a little bit of a double entendre going on here), and Toxic (so dang catchy).  Not so good songs on the album--Shadow (by NO means a Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know), Early Mornin', Outrageous (I knew when I Believe I Could Fly came out R Kelly SUCKED).<br />For the listener--at least give the album a chance. <BR>For Britney-- please, find yourself and get back to us.
B000089RVX|4.0|I love that the lead singer is a female.  It shows that us girls can do our share of rocking too.  It's very refreshing to have Amy's voice in these edgy songs.  &quot;Going Under&quot; is one of my favorite tracks on this album.  The lyrics are really great, and the music has an awesome beat.  &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot;, of course, everyone knows from the 'Daredevil' soundtrack, and it's a great song.  &quot;My Immortal&quot; is by far my very favorite song on this CD, if not my favorite song period.  The combination of the piano and violin with those amazing lyrics sends me into a state of relaxation.  The entire album has a haunting type sound and presence, and it's actually very refreshing, compared to most rock today.  I could comment on every song, but that would take up too much space.  Just buy the CD and find out for yourself--it's great!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I knew I was going to rush out November 18th to get this, I'm not going to lie.I didn't expect it to be this good.This album has it's upbeat dance club music, (&quot;Me Against the Music&quot;, &quot;Boom Boom&quot;, &quot;Showdown&quot;, &quot;Early Morin'&quot;, &quot;Toxic&quot;, &quot;Outrageous&quot;, &quot;The Hook Up&quot;, and &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;) then there's the slower stuff, (&quot;Breathe On Me&quot;, &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, &quot;Everytime&quot;, and my personal favorite, &quot;Shadow&quot;.)All I'm saying is give this cd a chance.Various friends of mine who have never liked Britney are rushing out to get it since listening to mine.Britney did it with this one, her best ever.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney new album is the best she has ever done! With amazing songs, and refreshing beats, Britney does it again!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|This release is evidence that Phil Spector added a nice dimension to songs like \\"The Long and Winding Road\\".  As time passes, the orchestral Phil Spector produced version will be the one that stands as the hit.
076790592X|5.0|If you wonder what the meaning of life is, or need some inspiration to cope with hard times, this is the book for you.  It deals with all the hard issues we must face at one time or another, in our lives.  This book teaches you to be gratefull for all you have and especially the love and support of family and friends.  If you ever feel lost in life, give this book a try.
B000002UAX|2.0|Having the potential to have been the strongest Beatle album to date with 12 great tracks, instead the group and George Martin put another 18 weaker songs and made this album difficult to get through.  Songs like Goodnight (who cares if there is a lullaby on this?) Savoy Truffle and Long Long Long have little attraction.<br />It is tough to produce a double album that carries its weight.  Few have done it, but many are better than this.  5-stars for the 10 good songs plus 1 star for the 20 other songs = about 2 stars.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania is once again  successful in entertaining her fans in this new DVD, UP! IT's a muct have for any Shania fan, and a must watch to anyone who is not familiar with her (where have you been?). Everyone will certainly come away a fan after reviewing this video. The video actually makes you feel you are one among the crowd at this her awe inspiring concert of her best hits. This one will definatly get you UP! and moving!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I was eagerly awaiting the release of this album only to be totally disappointed and baffled as to the direction this young pop star has taken.  I am a Britney fan and have been following her career since she first came on seen, but I think she is at the point of going mock 4 straight into a brick wall.  <BR>This album is full of breathy lyrics backed up by the repititous sounds of various beats.  The songs are good, but that is only if you take away the repitition she seems to have fallen in with every song after - Me Against the Music.  Hate to say it, but it aint worth buyin or burnin.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|This CD shines as brilliantly as the Christmas star itself. Mandolins, flutes, whistles, drums, guitars, accordian, organ, and sweet glorious vocal harmonies -- they're all tucked perfectly together in this simply amazing holiday CD. In my estimation, this one is destined to be Rock's flagship contribution to the holiday genre. Compare to other lagging efforts by Tull's contemporary peers, for example, the Moody Blues and Chicago, and you'll see what I mean. Tull's is at once both happily optimistic and seriously reflective, both musically and lyrically, whereas the others, although not bad, just don't fire on all cylinders as does this one. And it's appeal is intergenerational, judging by the fact that both my children and my elderly parents enjoy it as well. As is typical with Jethro Tull, it is difficult to pigeon-hole this CD. It's not Rock, it's not Jazz, it's  not Celtic, it's not Classical, it's not World, and it's not Folk, yet it integrates elements of each into some fantastic greater whole. It's simply amazing -- a real holiday masterpiece from a venerable, veteran band obviously at the peak of its game. Do yourself a holiday favor and buy this CD -- for yourself, your family, and your friends, neighbors, and colleagues -- just share the experience. It's just too good not to!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|If you like pop and/or dance music, you will really like Brit's new CD. She is awesome. She really stepped it up on this album.  I honestly only liked Britney in the past because she was adorable, but now I see her talent coming through as she grows up. This album has elements of her poppy past, but has a lot of great beats and hip-hop elements also. This album definitely makes you want to dance. Brave New Girl sounds a lot like something that the Bangles would have done in the 80's, but better. Early Mornin' completely rocks, it is like a hip-hoppy/dance track that you could listen to while getting ready to hit the town. <BR>I'm not going to lie, this album is for the girls. Britney is all grown up and shows it. With only two ballads, one of which is actually not too cute-poppy, this is an album you blast while hanging out with your girlfriends. <BR>Oh, I forgot to mention Me against the Music...but do I have to? I think everyone understands how hot that song is.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have been a Dream Theater fan for several years now. I have back tracked and have listened to just about everything they have recorded, including most the side projects of the band. I thought they might have made an commercial attempt with this release but THANK GOD they did NOT! This album rocks in a BIG way that other bands could only aspire to be as good! The first track is the most &quot;commercial&quot; and the follow pieces takes us down heavy hard prog roads too. The band works to tight as a working unit that it never seizes to amaze me that they can pull it all off live as well! <br /> I guess this may not be for everyone, but if you respect solid power prog with darker song writing &amp;  moods, definately get this one. It is as good as Six Degrees if not better. This band evolves and grows.EXCELLENT SPIN!
B000001Y42|5.0|This is Limp Bizkits best CD, bottom line, period.  Since this hellraising, heavy, in your face effort came out, the band has yet to match this type of intensity on any of their albums.  If you were a fan of &quot;Chocolate Starfish....&quot; or &quot;Results May Vary&quot;, than I don't think you will like this album.  This is definately for those who like it heavy, and want to hear what Limp Bizkit sounded like before they were making any money.
B0000DJZA0|5.0|I have both &quot;Parachutes&quot; and &quot;Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;.  This package combines the best of both in exquisite live performances destined to be classics.  If your a fan, or a newcomer, you'll enjoy this CD/DVD over and over.<br />The video is a bit MTV'ish.  To many camera angles and edits, but the sound quality is perfect.<br />The CD eliminated several great tracks.  Not sure why. Kind of a bummer but still very satisfying.
630027120X|3.0|En mi opinin, &quot;The Mission&quot; era una pelcula muy buena porque hay mucha referencia sobre la vida de los indgenas.  Los indgenas no pueden vivir sin el otro grupo que quiere controlar a ellos.  En realidad, el tema de esta pelcula es horrible, los indgenas nunca pueden vivir sin la influencia de los blancos que invadieron a la tierra de los indgenas.  Pero despus de unos meses, los indgenas aceptaron a los blancos y su religin de cristianismo.  No me gusta el tema de esta pelcula porque los blancos invadieron a los indgenas solamente porque ellos quisieron que tener nuevas miembros para su religin.  La vida entre los dos grupos era mejor despus de un tiempo un poco largo, pero en el ltimo momento de la pelcula, haba muchos problemas porque los indgenas realizan que los blancos no aceptaron a la vida de los indgenas.  Los dos grupos que van a vivir juntos necesitan aceptar las diferencias en los dos grupos, porque si no, los grupos van a tener un conflicto muy grande en el fin.  Este es el problema en la pelcula porque los indgenas aceparon a la cultura y religin de los blancos pero un da ellos realizaron que los blancos no van a aceptar a la cultura de los indgenas.  The Mission es una pelcula muy bien hecho porque hay muchas personas en el mundo que no aceptan a otras culturas o religiones, por eso hay mucho conflicto.  En el fin de la pelcula, los dos grupos pueden vivir juntos ms o menos tranquilamente, por eso, es una buena pelcula para el mundo realizar que no es mal para aceptar a otros grupos de personas.
0062502182|5.0|I loved this book! I am one who likes an easy read. Reading through the other reviews I realized that many of the people found it too simple. I like to get my lessons in an easy way through an entertaining story. I would highly recommend this book. Everyone needs to dream for something better than they have right now and believe in dreams that can come true!
B00000ILDF|1.0|What an absolute travesty.  By far, this is the LEAST favorite of all the Alien movies.<br />&quot;Aliens&quot; left off on a hopeful note of &quot;no more bad dreams&quot;...until Alien 3 came along and injected its OWN &quot;bad dream.&quot;<br />Hope for the fragile human spirit?  Love of childhood innocence?  We're sorry, that's not allowed in this third farce of a movie.  Let's squash it head-on early in the movie by killing off two of the characters that we grew so attached to in the second movie as this may complicate the intricate plot of the 3rd movie.<br />Oh, I'm sorry, WHAT intricate plot?  Originally, some of you may remember a teaser trailer that stated something along the lines of &quot;On Earth, EVERYONE can you hear you scream.&quot;  Chills galore!!  Aliens on Earth...how scary is that prospect?<br />Oops, we're sorry, no film budget...guess we're going to have to go to butchered plot #2:<br />Let's see...as J. Bollen describes in his review, how does the whole facehugger loophole work?  It doesn't...see his review...he covers that ground QUITE NICELY, but I will paraphrase here.  Facehuggers do not, repeat NOT, impreganate hosts MORE THAN ONCE.  If they did, then the first Alien movie would have been quite different.  It's laughable that an Alien egg is shown at the beginning of the film as this would imply that it had been deliberately placed there somehow.  Nah-uh...the Queen could not have laid it and NO ONE ELSE FROM THE SULACO GOT BACK TO THE SHIP UNTIL THE VERY END.  So...how did it get there?  How does Bishop know there was an Alien on-board and, if he knew through the computer system, why hadn't the computer tried to wake its passengers when something foreign was detected?  It knew well enough to eject the pod when a fire started.  This in itself is somewhat weak...what fire could be so severe that it could not be quashed with some sort of Halon system?  Everyone is in their cryo-tube, so a fear of not having an oxygen supply would have been meted out.  Sorry, it's really weak...the film-makers would have done well to explain it.  However, they don't and intent to insult your intelligence by throwing it in your face with brief clip-shots of languid explanations.<br />Ok, loopholes aside, we are on a new planet.  Nothing real exciting to look at.  All right, let's just move on to the facility which looks industrial to say the least.  Okay, nothing new here either.  Let's move on to characters.<br />The warden, a cardboard cutout of the disbelieving members of the Company from the second movie, explains his disbelief of the Alien in such a similar way to cause eye-rolling &quot;get on with it&quot; looks.  No weapons?  A cloaked way of saying:  &quot;No budget for the film.&quot;  The explanation?  Prisoners. <br />Ah, yes, prisoners.  As Ripley tries to convince them to fight the Alien (especially after being nearly brutally raped at one point), one tends to wonder, &quot;How can somebody be callous enough to use human beings to protect one's interests in thwarting the Company's plans?&quot;  The answer is quite simple -- they are murderers and rapists so nobody cares if they die.  Ripley would lead you to believe that SHE CARES (and she does), but the audience is left to feel no remorse for those who committed heinous crimes in the first place!!<br />And that's yet another point to emphasize!!  Where is the human spirit?  There are some characters that we could care for.  There's the doctor, but for crying out loud, let's get him killed before we get too emotionally involved!  There's the preacher, but again, what's the sense in maintaining hope for the human spirit...off with his head, too!  There's Ripley...again, I think you see where this is headed!<br />The whole lead facility at the end of the movie had me rolling around in laughter in tears.  It's almost as if somebody wanted to make a really cool Halloween maze; you know, the kind that pops up in the middle of fields in some cities that triesto scare thrill-seekers with fake chainsaws, etc.?  None of the doors work, so this is somehow supposed to increase our fear of automatic doors not working while we're being chased.  Oh, and let's not forget this appears to be the part of the facility where nothing works.  Except for the lead.  You would think that something like the lead works, if fully functioning, would have fully functioning doors as well.  Ah, yes, prisoners...nobody cares for the prisoners.  What a wonderful loophole of disregard for human life that we have found!<br />My least favorite aspect was the Alien itself.  CGI was still somewhat in its infancy and it is painfully obvious here.  Whereas the first two movies frighten us with their implicit size and strength, this one is supposed to frighten us with its speed.  It does not appear to be too strong.  At one point, as it's &quot;chewing&quot; on a victim, it looks as if it's convulsing in its attempts.  I'm not sure if I needed to get in there and perform a Heimlich on the poor wretch or if I was supposed to be frightened by its gyrations.  I did not do either, in any case.  This Alien does not frighten me one bit.  The first two movies scared the hell out of me, though.  This one, not even close...not by a long shot.<br />Skip this movie.  Alien Resurrection was a decent effort at apologizing for the 3rd movie, but it should have ended with the hope of Aliens.
B00005JM02|5.0|i loved Finding Nemo - Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich are amazing! Let's get one thing straight: Disney did nothing but finacially back this movie - the incredible animation and story lines are by the good folks of PIXAR! I loved that the extras of this DVD included the short film, &quot;Knick Knack&quot; because that's a great movie! This movie definietly earns the title of &quot;Best Movie of the Year.&quot;
B00004TH83|5.0|i bought this cd the first day it came out.  i can honestly say that after 3 years, this cd still goes everywhere with me.  sometimes i need to hear lara sing...she transports me to another world. the power, the control, and the beauty of this voice far outweighs that of her contemporaries.  no one compares.  highs, lows, and in between, lara's voice oozes with emotion and elegance.  she is the ultimate singer--hand's down.  i still get goosebumps everytime i listen to &quot;to love again&quot; and &quot;adagio.&quot;  can't wait for another english release!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|I am so Happy that Eric Clapton was the &quot;music coordinator&quot; because the concert runs so smoothly and sounds really amazing.  After watching it through I realized something which most people would probably disagree but after McCartney comes out, he tries to &quot;steal&quot; the show (as he always tries to do)...but because the band is so &quot;solid&quot; by this point...he doesn't get anywhere, and he almost takes a &quot;backseat&quot; as a one of the performers, instead of being &quot;the Main Performer&quot;.  <BR>Overall I really enjoyed this DVD...it would have been nice for Joe Brown (ukelele player) to cover some of George's Brainwashed Uke stuff...or even have Dhani sing a song.  <br />Good Stuff!!!
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Like many other Dream Theater listeners, it usually takes several playings of one of their CDs for me to decide how much I like it and how it compares to their other recordings.  Regarding Train of Thought, that trend has been broken...<br />Right off the bat, this CD feels like a focused, all-out, frantic effort by every member to better their performances from Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence.  The efforts of each band member to make each of their solos and technical musicianship brightly outshine those of past recordings is almost effortlessly brought together in one, huge, 70-minute push - And the result is a seamless, amazingly well-produced, lush sounding recording of blistering solos, thunderous harmonies, and clear, outstanding vocals.<br />I initially thought that Six Degrees was the very best Dream Theater album ever made, but even after just one spin, I have to say that Train of Thought has surpassed it in every way.  It is the essence of what Dream Theater has come to be, and isn't missing ANY of the things that you love about their other records - It just seemingly has MORE of everything, fantastically interwoven, seamlessly arranged, and impeccably played.<br />If you're a Dream Theater fan, this CD will take first place in your collection.  If you're not yet a Dream Theater fan, Train of Thought will be an outstanding introduction to the blindingly technical emotion with which these guys play.<br />In a word...awesome.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of this cd; it's beats are energetic, the lyrics are catchy, and the album has a great delivery. Songs such as 'Boom Boom', and 'Toxic' will make you want to get up and dance, acting as a great work out cd. At the same time songs like Britney's own (and first) self written 'Everytime' is as refelctive and beautiful as her voice, which is best displayed on this album. For fans of Britney, this album exceeds all expectations, and will turn nay sayers into Britney believers. In summary, the 'break' Ms. Spears took paid off, and the result is this awesome album.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Peter Gabriel is one of the most innovative and challenging people in the mainstream music business today, and this collection is a very good introduction to his ever-evolving style.  However, as with every other review here, I have some pretty solid reservations to the selection.<br />1) Nothing from album 2, of course.  &quot;DIY&quot; and &quot;On the Air&quot; are the most obvious candidates.<BR>2) &quot;Here Comes the Flood&quot; in Shaking the Tree version-Not that it's a bad version, but the 1st album version has an arrangement that matches the apocalyptic vision of the lyrics, and since the early albums just went through remasters, it would be nice.<BR>3) &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot;-havent heard the original album in a while, since I only had it on vinyl, but I could swear that the chorus is different the second time around.  The line in the first chorus reads &quot;kissing baboons in the jungle&quot; while the second chorus has &quot;piss on the goons in the jungle&quot; a minor change, I'll admit, and probably done to increase radio airplay when Shaking the Tree came out, but the original 2nd chorus lyric seems fitting to a song that progresses into &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; territory.  &quot;Hit&quot; uses the STT alteration.<BR>4) The song selection is a bit &quot;UP&quot; heavy, though mercifully without the &quot;Barry Williams Show&quot; song, probably the only PG song I've actively disliked.<BR>5) I realize that PG probably prefers to let the music speak for itself, but it would be nice to have some commentary, a brief essay maybe.<BR>6) A few of the songs are in radio edit versions.  It would be nice to have the album tracks.<br />All of that being said, if this collection is a contract ender, as many people suspect, it is a damn good one, and better as a representative collection than Shaking the Tree was.  There are a few nice soundtrack contibutions, and the import-only OVO gets a few numbers.  And, if it should get a few more peopleto listen to Gabriel's pre- and post- &quot;So&quot; material, it would be well worth it.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|Whitney Houston's latest CD offering &quot;One Wish&quot; is a superb holiday staple.  The arrangements are very jazzy and has such a live gospel feel to them.  I loved the fact that she didn't take the tradtional trite route of singing the same ole christmas songs the same way.  Most artists of her caliber couldn't get away with this.  Whitney Houston proves that she has true showmanship.  Her voice Is haunting.  I believe that she felt ever note that she's singing on these songs.  O Come,O Come Emanuel,I'll be Home For Christmas,Oh Holy Night,The Christmas Song,First Noel and the title track are all worthy of making this a CLASSIC WHITNEY CHRISTMAS for YEARS to come.  Some traditionalist might be turned off by the arrangements,but for those of us who are Interested In quality and artistry.  You won't be disappointed.  I think that Whitney Houston has truly captured what many of her peers such as Celine Dion,Mariah Carey,Toni Braxton and others has yet to do.  It takes a special kind of artist to take risk and chance on some things that or tried and true and give substance and hope to a new generation,who need a reason to believe.  Whitney Houston answers the call of duty.  Her voice has more depth that she's Illustrated In recent yours.  Whatever her struggles may have been In her life...I do believe that she's a living testimony of what God can do.  She's back to singing like a angel.  One Wish will go down In history as a TIMELESS Classic.  God Bless you Whitney.

B0000DD7LB|2.0|Once again Britney Spears has proved that she can neither sing or write good songs.  She may be a good performer but she doesn't actually EVER really sing!!  To be a good artist you must actually sing at a live show Britney!!This album totally sucks like the rest of them and I can honestly say that I am waiting for the day she poses in Playboy when the public realizes that all she is is a pretty face.  Trust me, don't buy this album.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Madonna, who once sit at the top a tower of unbreakable pop queen status, continues to spiral downward into an abyss starting with American Life continuing into one of the worst songs I have ever heard, &quot;Me Against The Music.&quot;  That's saying something for someone who's collected Madonna memorabilia for 20 years.  I don't know why Madonna is letting Britney pull her down.  Britney Spears is trash, and any comparison to Madonna of old is laughable, as Britney can't break any &quot;new ground&quot; because Madonna did it 21 years ago!  I yawn at Britney's attempts to market herself as the virgin gone harlot.  Been there, done that.  This CD is trash as is all of Britney's music.  I listened to it at Tower, lord knows I'd never buy it, but was stopped by the heaves.  If you want real music with actual depth, get Tori's latest.  To those who say comparing the 2 is unfair, you're right; Britney can only sink lower as she can't even get good pop music right.  Britney's &quot;fame&quot; will end soon, and many people are turning away from Madonna's idiotic lyrics and headache-inducing electro chords.  There are so many choices right now: the new Sarah Mclaughlin, Cyndi Lauper or Tori's collection.  BTW, who is the me in against the music, and what exactly are they against?  Hmmm...some riddles aren't meant to be solved I suppose,
B00000099Y|5.0|Aenema is a work of pure genious. This album, in my opinion, is Tools best. Every song is so deep and diverse. Maynard's vocals are absolutely amazing. If you are a current Tool fan and do not have this album, get off your rumpus right now and go buy it! And to those who are new to Tool, I suggest Aenema as your first album to invest in. I could go on and on about this, but to prevent me from boring you even more,I will stop here. *whispers* Tool rocks
0156027321|5.0|The novel received the Man Booker prize, and for good reason. I read about a book a week and I would say that this was by far the best book I read last year. The main character, Pi, named after a swimming pool in Paris, is a loveable, intelligent survivalist who finds himself on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic with one friend, Richard Parker. Richard Parker, unfortunely for Pi, is a Bengalese tiger, the only survivor, aside from Pi of a shipwreck in which Pi looses his whole family and their zoo which they were moving from India to Canada.<br />I never wanted this book to end and am hungry for anything else Yann Martel plans to produce. I have given THE LIFE OF PI to my 75 year old grandmother, my 52 year old step-father, my 21 year old sister and each age group has given the same reaction as myself: absolute love.<br />I highly recommend this novel, you will not be disappointed.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The original \\"Let it Be\\" was always dismissed as a haphazard collection of uneven songs, either over or under-produced.  Although I liked Phil Spector's work with George's album, I never realized what a hatchet job he did with the songs on \\"Let it Be\\" until I heard this clean, crisp and strikingly intimate re-issue.  The studio versions of the \\"rooftop\\" songs are tighter and better recorded.  The songs cleared of the Spector over-production have a pulse and showcase the group's intrumental abilities (especially Billy Preston).   John's \\"Across the Universe\\" is hauntingly touching and Paul's \\"Long and Winding Road\\" conveys the spirit of gentle longing that it was meant to originally.  I wish they could have included some other tracks on the bonus CD, but this is well worth having.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|I'll leave the track-by-track evaluations of this gemstone to others. But take this observation to the bank if you like: the sheer sound quality of this rethink, compared to that of its namesake, is truly revelatory.  As one who has giddily bitten on the \\"get this latest and greatest DIGITAL remastering from the original source\\" lure many a time - and felt let down by the marginal return on my investment more than twice - I can promise that you will not be disappointed with \\"Naked,\\" if only for the sonic sublimity alone. If every remastering job produced improvements like this on its predecessor, all us sound-obsessed collectors would be as pleased as we would be penniless.    Really, folks...kick Phil out of your headphones. Hear this music the way it should have always been heard, both in terms of interpretation and reproduction.     Who would've imagined we still be hearing new works by the Beatles in the 21st century?
6305308659|5.0|&quot;And every one of those things is in you all the time, if you just have the guts to look for them.&quot; -David/Bud Parker (Tobey MacGuire)<br />I got this movie because I am a fan of a majority of Reese Witherspoon's work.  I was presently surprised with this movie.<br />The movie opens with statistics about the bleak future (AIDS, famine, over population, etc.). It come to what appears to be (with line eye match) David (Tobey MacGuire) asking a girl out. Only when the camera pulls back you see he wasn't really talking to her.<br />After a sibling spat over who gets to watch TV downstairs, Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) and David are transported into the black and white TV world of &quot;Pleasantville&quot;. Jennifer is now Mary Sue and David is Bud Parker.<br />Mary Sue is up to her act being the 'bad girl' on her date with Skip (Paul Walker). The rose is the first thing in Pleasantville to be in color. After Skip tells his friends about hit date with Mary Sue, more colors start to appear.<br />I don't want to give away the whole movie, but it is a good movie.<br />Fiona Apple's rendition of the Beatles' song &quot;Across the Universe&quot; is a great way to end the movie.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This really is the Let It Be that the Beatles set out to make almost 30 years ago. All the songs sound great! The songs that had the most reworking were The Long and Winding Road and Let it Be. This is great for any true Beatles fan.
B000002KDO|5.0|While \\"Paranoid\\" had the great individual songs (War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man) it was really on \\"Masters Of Reality\\" that Black Sabbath really came together left their mark upon music. This is without a doubt Black Sabbath's darkest record, a cohesive slice of dark rock that would create heavy metal.     Seemingly coated with layers of tar, Iommi's guitar riffs are the centre piece of this black hole of a record. Everything else seemingly hides behind the sludgy riffs, even Ozzy's wail seems to come from behind the heavy chords. Even the folky (though almost gothic) \\"Embryo\\" and \\"Orchid\\" the accoustic interludes somehow fuse perfectly into the records flow, escalating the sense of creepy darkness.     Surprisingly the 'softer' song \\"Solitude\\" is one of the best. Managing to escape the self indulgence that many heavy metal bands sink into why they attempt to show their 'tender' side. \\"Children Of The Grave\\" meanwhile seems to gallop towards the apocalypse the band seem to fear is imminent.     More over the flow of this album mimics the stages of depression leading to suicide. \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and \\"After Forever\\" signal escapism and a search for redemption, \\"Embryo\\" as well as \\"Orchid\\" are musical equivalants of inertia. The rest is fear of impending doom (Children Of The Grave), cynicism (Lord Of This World), despair (Solitude) and finally the anger and frustration that lead to a suicidal act in \\"Into The Void\\".     And still people claim heavy metal has no soul. Compared to \\"Masters Of Reality\\"'s endlessly black one, everything else seems shallow.      Sabbath would never make an album this great again, though they still had quite a few great songs in them. Ozzy may have became a public joke and Iommi may have driven the band towards medicore oblivion, but with albums like this and Paranoid to their name their reputations as musical icons is secure.

B00000JLWW|1.0|There are few movies in memory where I have found it necessary to fast-forward through most of it so I don't fall asleep before the end.  This is one of those movies.  Overhyped and overanalyzed, this movie proved that the Academy Awards are based more on public relations and public opinion than they are on talent, quality, and art.  It is still difficult for me to believe that this mishmash of pure nonsense won Best Picture over the far superior movies L.A. Confidential and As Good As It Gets.  11 Academy Awards?  It equals Ben-Hur (1959) in the number of awards, but will never equal it in artistic achievement or dramatic tension.<br />Except for the cinematography, costume and set designs, and some of the special effects, this is a perfect example of what Hollywood calls &quot;high art and entertainment&quot; today.  Poor story line, lousy acting, a total waste of time....

B0000CEB4V|5.0|I've rated this a star more than the CD only because the true impact of the concert is felt with the visual aspect. This terrific tribute concert managed to rope long time friends of Harrison into performing many of his classics. The most moving moments were seeing McCartney, Starr and Clapton (along with a band handpicked by Eric)perform Something with McCartney and Clapton sharing lead vocals. I did miss McCartney's &quot;busy&quot; bass playing on the track but, well, you can't have everything.<br />The DVD includes the overlooked original theatrical version, an extended version (on the first disc)plus a video documentary about the concert with comments from key people in George's life. The sound is beautifully mixed (production was handled by Harrison's frequent collborator in later life and former ELO frontman Jeff Lynne)and the show nicely put together. It's a class job the whole way. While no one makes mention of it, the first superstar rock concert for charity was put together 32 years ago this year with Harrison's Concert For Bangela Desh.<br />The only folks MIA are Bob Dylan and Leon Russell. It was a real highlight to see Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers (with Jeff Lynne) perform the song they recorded with The Traveling Wilburys &quot;Handle With Care&quot;. It was handled with care, compassion and class. Great job organizing this one Eric. Thanks George.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Admittedly, the title of this release is a drag, as is the cover art.  From what I understand, \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" is not what the band had originally intended as the \\"Get Back\\" album (which was never released, the material for which was rehashed by Spector and eventually released as \\"Let It Be\\"), but certainly \\"Get Back\\" would have been a better title than \\"Naked\\".  And who knows what other kinds of original cover art the art directors at EMI could have devised, but it most likely would have been better than what is on this release.  Having said that, this release is a triumph musically.  I doubt you will find many people making the claim that this music, either in this release or in the original Spectorized version, is The Beatles' strongest material; \\"Abbey Road\\" makes for a better swan song for the band, and earlier albums such as \\"Rubber Soul\\" and \\"Revolver\\" show the band at their peak. But the music here is still of a definite period in The Beatles' career, and is as essential to any Beatles collection as any other release.  The original \\"Let It Be\\" obscured the sound the band was attempting to achieve during this period, and while the album is not awful, it certainly is not The Beatles getting back to where they once belonged.  To have this music finally presented as it was originally intended -- sonically pristine and stripped of artifice or studio tinkering -- is a joy.    The remastering is amazing, allowing us to hear with clarity and detail just what the band was doing in the studio and on the rooftop; those who claim it sounds too clean or sterile should keep in mind that the original recordings were so clean sounding that they were bordering on being anemic.  (John Lennon referred to it as \\"badly recorded sh**\\", after all.) The reordering of the tracks also helps make this album seem more whole, more of a piece with itself.  Setting aside preexisting notions of how this album should be ordered based on the original \\"Let It Be\\" album, it really makes sense to start this album off with \\"Get Back\\" and to finish with \\"Let It Be.\\"  And while many feel that the removal of the chatter and banter makes the album less charming and \\"human,\\" it should be remembered that no original Beatles album had any such studio excerpts; every album that the band approved while they were together was a produced collection of songs, which is what we finally have with this material.  Having it available in this context finally gives closure to a musical story that, until now, felt incomplete.  Obviously, fans are split on how much they like this release.  Many people are complaining that this album is woefully lacking in completeness, that there is so much more material from these sessions that is going unreleased.  It is apparent, though, that completeness is not the purpose of this release.  \\"Naked\\" simply attempts to put the original \\"Let It Be\\" material into the form of an album The Beatles themselves, along with George Martin, would have assembled, rather than leaving the task to a heavy-handed third party.  In this regard, it succeeds brilliantly.  For those of us who always felt that \\"Let It Be\\" was a flawed gem in an otherwise flawless setting, \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" is a welcome, and much needed, addition to the Beatles catalogue.  I, for one, am glad that it is finally here.  The bonus disc is interesting, but not essential.  Fortunately, one is not required to pay any extra for it.  I think it was included as a salve to those who would rail against the removal of the chatter and banter from the actual album order.  However, it also helps tell the story of the evolution of the Get Back/Let It Be project.  One very interesting inclusion is the sound of John tinkering around on the piano with a sketchy instrumental arrangement of \\"Imagine.\\"
B0000E6I1J|4.0|He wasn't a saint nor did he pretend to be. George Harrison attempted to just be a little better and closer to his God. His friends and family decided after his death to put together a tribute. Concert for George features a number of stellar performances by Harrison's old friends Eric Clapton, Gary Brooker, Ringo Starr, Paul McCartney, Tom Petty and Billy Preston. Strange as it may seem the only person missing is close friend Bob Dylan.<br />The performances of Harrison's songs written for and after The Beatles are all exceptional. Starting backwards with disc two (since that's the disc that appealed to me most)the stand out track for me is McCartney's remake of Harrison's All Things Must Pass (by the way you can hear a brief snippet of The Beatles rehearsing the song on the Fly on The Wall disc for the newly remastered/remixed Let It Be...Naked). Harrison's While My Guitar Gently Weeps is movingly performed by McCartney and Clapton. McCartney has always had an odd affection for one Harrison underdog--For You Blue from Let It Be. He and the band rip it up turning Harrison's minor classic into a raw blues gem.<br />Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers rip through a trio of Harrison classics covering in microcosm Harrison's career. From the pop of I Need You to the angry Taxman and back again with the gentle Handle With Care (from The Traveling Wilburys). Starr recognizes Harrison by performing Photograph. Starr was having problems with the song he had a couple of verses and the basic melody and couldn't get anywhere with it. Harrison offered to help him out and co-wrote the song, arranged it, sang backing vocals and lead guitar on the original single. Starr also pays tribute to Harrison and his guitar playing idol Carl Perkins with a fine performance of Honey Don't. Joe Brown tackles a number of Harrison classics and does a good job with them; the stand out track for Brown is Here Comes The Sun.<br />Billy Preston cofidently tackles My Sweet Lord while Gary Brooker shuffles along with Harrison's odd classic B-Side Old Brown Shoe. Jeff Lynne turns in nice performances of Harrison's I Want To Tell You, Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth) and the charming The Inner Light. The latter tune is the highlight of disc one with Lynne performing with Anoushka Shankar. There's also three Indian flavored tracks . Your Eyes is a sitar solo by Anoushka Shankar while Arpan is conducted by Shankar. Both are interesting and soulful particularly if you appreciate Indian music.<br />George's wit, songwriting and unique slide playing will be missed but, more importantly, a talented human being was lost to all of us when he passed away.es along with Harrison's odd classic B-Side Old Brown Shoe.

0312263120|5.0|The first of many excitingly fun reads by author Dan Brown is more of a techno-thriller than the more traditional thrillers his books to follow have become, but Brown shows flashes of his more polished writing style in this book about secret government spy agencies and conspiracies within them.<br />When the fiancée of government techno-wizard Susan Fletcher is hired to embark on a dangerous mission overseas, she is naturally petrified for him. When she finds out he is being used as a pawn in a government conspiracy involving her own boss (who secretly pines for her attention) all hell is about to break loose. Nevermind that the super-computer that protects all secret government information is about to go down....inviting anyone with a desktop computer to hack into anything they have ever wanted to know...<br />If you are a fan of high-tech thrillers, this will be a very fun read for you. It may be a bit too \\"tech-y\\" if you are not into that kind of thing - so bear that in mind as well. All-in-all it's a very fun book to read and I would recommend it, especially if you have read any of Brown's other novels (Deception Point, Angels &amp; Demons, The Da Vinci Code) and enjoyed them. Sit back and have fun with this one!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is very good. It is good for all genders. I'm a 17 year old guy and I didn't like Britney's previous Cd's because they were too girlish. Now this one is actually ENJOYABLE. There is not even one song that is bad. They all have unique beates. Some songs are for male audience (Outragous, Showdown, The Hook Up),<BR>for females (brave new girl,breath on me,toxic,everytime,shadow) and for more RAP fans Outragous is DA BOMB! It is produced by R. Kelly and it is amazing! Touch of My Hand is a very sexual song but done very good. Boom Boom is for all the POP haters it features The Yang Yang twins and could be a great single. My personal favorite is Outragous and Boom Boom. I listen to all of them most of the time. This is how I rate Britney's Albums<br />Baby One More Time - 4/10 <BR>Oops I did it again - 4.5/10<BR>Britney - 7/10<BR>In The Zone - 9.8/10
B00006J9OT|5.0|What can you say about Diana Krall's contemporary jazz style that would do it justice? Do yourself a favor and listen to the sample tracks Amazon provides and then you will no doubt want to make her vocal musings and jazz piano playing part of your collection.<br />While many &quot;greatest hits&quot; CDs are merely republications of tracks from previous CDs, &quot;Live in Paris&quot; makes you a part of a concert experience - hearing and no doubt loving some of her favorite tunes as if she were there live singing for you. Sit back, close your eyes (unless you're in the car of course) and just imagine you are there listening to that incredible voice in person.<br />If you are a fan of contemporary jazz, or just easy relaxing melodies this is definitely the CD for you. If you only like heavy metal and hard rock - well, why are you looking at this CD anyway? :-) Highly recommended.

If you act like it's Britney's job to babysit little children then you're confused and if you aren't a fan then why waste your time writing snotty reviews?  This CD is a HUGE improvement for Britney and I haven't taken out of my CD player since I bought it.  There's only one song on here that I don't like and usually there's about three or four.  Toxic, Everytime, Boom Boom and Brave New Girl are great if you're able to get over yourself long enough to enjoy a good beat when you hear it. It's not profound, but it's fun - and if you're expecting much more, then don't buy it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|The jacket of the original Let It Be album claimed that it had the \\"warmth & freshness of a live performance.\\"  That turned out to be a lie, thanks to one Phil Spector.  Nearly 34 years later, Paul, Ringo, & George (who gave this project his approval before his death) hope to correct what they and many others feel was an injustice.  The result is a dazzling feast for the ears...in other words, what the original album SHOULD have been--a true Beatles album.  There is no clash of live intimacy with overproduction.  Any trace of Spector's involvement is gone.  And good riddance.  The sound quality of Let It Be...Naked is so crisp (thanks in part to today's technology), each individual instrument, every voice can be heard so clearly, as if the Beatles are playing in your living room.  That's the first thing you'll notice upon hearing \\"Get Back,\\" which more sensefully opens the album this time.  The songs which sound the most different are \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" & \\"Across The Universe.\\"  If you've seen the Let It Be movie, you know how intimate \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" was meant to sound--as if Paul is playing piano and singing directly to you.  Gone are Spector's choir and extra instrumentation that Paul hated so much.  This song alone is truely worth the price of the album.  \\"Across The Universe,\\" in all its original simplicity, sounds almost like a demo.  It's very similar to the \\"wildlife\\" version but without the distracting sound effects and fades out in a ghostly echo.  \\"Let It Be\\" also sounds fresh & new, with Billy Preston's organ pushed way more towards the front of the mix.  My only disappointment is that the guitar solo is more similar to the unfortunately better-known single version rather than the ripping version overdubbed onto the original album version.  That's okay, though...it fits the mood of the album better this way.  The biggest surprises on this album come from the songs \\"One After 909\\" & \\"I've Got A Feeling,\\" two songs I never really careda whole lot for.  Before hearing Let It Be...Naked, I never realized how dreadfully muddy these songs sounded on the original album.  You can actually hear the keyboard in \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" now and the song sounds great.  Both songs are so much more coherent.  The only song that I felt benefited from Spector's production was \\"I Me Mine.\\"  It sounds a bit loose here (only three Beatles played on it, after all).  One of the rawest songs the Beatles ever recorded together, \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" is presented here in all its glory, sounding more natural than its somewhat polished original.  The rest of the songs are ones which Spector did not impose on very much, so they don't sound too different from their versions on the original album.  However, the aforementioned clarity of sound is what makes these songs worth hearing again.  Some people may complain that \\"Maggie Mae\\" & \\"Dig It\\" are not included.  Well, \\"Maggie Mae\\" was always just an expendable jam (which they did many of during these sessions) and the short excerpt of the original jam \\"Dig It\\" on the original album is pretty much it.  The bonus disc called \\"Fly On The Wall\\" is somewhat interesting.  It's a mish-mash of the Beatles discussing their music & the direction of the original project and excerpts from a few unreleased songs & early takes.  The disc is a perfect supplement piece to the movie, but I doubt that anyone who's lucky enough to own the complete session bootlegs would find it interesting.  A lot more could have been included on this disc, but it's free so it's hard to complain.  My guess is that people like myself who are artists or interested in music production will get the most out of Let It Be...Naked.  But in truth I believe that anyone who is a fan of the Beatles will appreciate this album.  After all, this is how Let It Be was meant to sound.  One more thing, to the people who keep saying that the \\"naked\\" versions are already available on Anthology 3:  Those are obviously NOT the finished versions!  That version of \\"Let It Be\\" is a demo, for gosh sakes!  (Sorry.)
B000089RVX|5.0|This is just a rant from a frustrated music lover, so just skip it if you dont want to hear my thoughts.<br />  I hate it when people constantly slam bands for being a knock off of another, or for only using bar chords. No band today is truly original. I know I am going to get flamed for this but it is just fact. Every artist or band draws on some influences to make their music, whether they realize it or not. This is not a bad thing either. I want to hear good music. The influences put into it are irrelevant. <BR>  <BR>  And also for the people who immediately write off Evanescence as a Lacuna Coil or Gathering knock-off, where's your album? It is easy to sit back and criticize everything. I'd like to see how original you could be in today's world. <br /> The way I approach music, and how I think everyone should, is to forget everything you know about music before listening to a record. If the music appeals to you, then it is good music. Don't shut it off, in evanescence's case, when you hear &quot;bring me to life&quot; because you think it is a carbon copy of linkin park. Then you hear a woman's voice over soaring guitars and you think 'Lacuna Coil' so you break the cd in two. Oh no, they only use bar chords! That must mean that it sucks! It is really sad and shallow of people to do look at music this way. Appreciate the music for what it is, don't degrade band's efforts by stamping everything with a label. <BR>  <BR>  Saying this, &quot;Fallen&quot; is a great record. It's delightfully haunting and the sorrowful ballads &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; bring a tear to my eye. It is definetly worth the investment and is a smooth intro into goth/atmospheric/prog rock, whatever you want to call it.<BR>(and if you enjoy this cd, definetly check out Lacuna Coil)
B00005JK8K|4.0|One of the best movies I have seen. Very realistic like and true. Shows a lot of blood but hey, that was how war was like. There was a flaw in the movie though that the movie should have reflected more on how the navajos used their code rather than World War 2 battle scenes. One flaw, but everything else was good.
B0000AUHPG|3.0|--hardly the greatest ever.  Ponderous.  Too long by an hour.  And, even with that length, some of it makes little sense. A truly great score lifts the picture onto a level that the rest of its components don't merit.  It's a good movie, but it doesn't stand with THE WILD BUNCH et al.  Get a grip, people!
B00005JM1F|5.0|A Hilarious masterpiece from director Todd Phillips.  Staring Will Ferrel as Frank &quot;the tank&quot;, Luke Wilson as &quot;Mitch&quot;, and Vince Vaughn as &quot;Beanie&quot;.  This instant colt classic represents the ultimate college comedy since &quot;Animal House&quot;.<BR>   When Mitch catches the early flight home from Denver only to catch his girlfriend cheating on him inspires his good friends Frank and Beanie to through him a &quot;kick off&quot; party in Mitch's new campus house as a way of &quot;releasing him out into the wild&quot;.<BR>    Due to regulations set forth by the Dean, Mitch is forced to turn his home into a faternity house, while recruiting fourteen new pledges.  The Dean does everything in his will to get rid of this new fraternity.<BR>    The new fraternity is the new &quot;hit&quot; around school, so the boys decide to do everything possible to keep the fraternity.  With scene after scene of hilarious footage, &quot;Old School&quot; will have you on the edge of your seat with non stop laughter.<BR>    Overall, I give &quot;Old School&quot; 2 thumbs up!  It is the ultimate comedy for more then just a few laughs, and gets funnier each time you watch it.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|Don't get me wrong. This is a five star album. Actually, I prefer this Naked version to the original. It's more intimate than the original release and I just simply prefer it to the over-produced original (albeit the original is still a classic). My One star rating is in reference to the packaging of this release. First of all the cover and overall artwork is pretty dull isn't it? Not a bad cover but just not amazing considering how \\"long-awaited\\" this release was. Paul or someone could have put a little more thought into it. There's gotta be a picture of The Beatles naked (or semi-naked) out there somewhere. Wouldn't that kind of been fitting?...Maybe not, but I just don't like the cover. Beatles albums were always colourful or creative for the most part (insert White Album crack here). All of the info inside is great. It's a nice booklet with lots of goodies for the Beatles fanatic. The thing that bugs me the most is the double CD part. The first disc is 35 minutes. The second disc is 22 minutes. Is there some reason that the whole 57 minutes couldn't fit on one disc? The second disc is merely one 22 minute track studio jabber as if you were a fly on the the wall during recording (hence the track title), which I'm sure is essential to any Beatle fans collection, but why here on a whole second disc. There's obviously more studio extras than that around. They could have at least made it 70 minutes or something. There's many options they could have explored. They could have easily squeezed the Naked version and the Original version of the Album on ONE DISC!!! Or even better, why not put both versions on a two disc set, and put 20 minutes of studio jabber at the end of each disc (or a couple extra takes or interviews even)???? Wouldn't that be a great package? Two versions of The Beatles last official studio release in a set with new and original artwork and all kinds of goodies!?! They could even have put a DVD re-release of the film instead of the second disc. That'd be even better. Or hell put out all 3 discs.  Isn't this more for the fan and more cost effecient? I just wish it was presented better.  I guess this is how Paul wanted it. Ah well, that's my useless rant. Don't let is stop you from buying the CD cause it is wonderful, but damn....for such a long awaited release, it could have been such a gem.  Maybe in another 30 years it'll come out again properly.  Extra Naked or something.
B0000TB05A|3.0|Sure, this concert is considered a historic homecoming, lodged tightly between the death of Bono's father and 9/11.  However, with all of its imperfections (most of us saw shows better than the two that were documented from the 2001 tour), the 'U2 Live in Boston' DVD represents a better performance and better song selection.<br />This DVD also includes a rather overrated documentary on the making of the rather overrated 'Unforgettable Fire', but I would characterize this as a plus only for those insane U2 completists like me.
B000002BFZ|5.0|the best cd I have ever heard.  It is simply awesome.  The only track I don't love is off he goes, everything else is amazing.  pearl jam albums seem to have songs that either all stand out, like ten and vs., or, like no code, all sink in.  either way, though, I am always amazed at how well they manage to fit the albums together, none of the songs sound out of place, and they all blend together into an album.  The one complaint I have about no code is how long it takes to get into it.  I had it for about 2 months before it actually started to grow on me, and it was my least favorite cd at the time, but just listen to all the songs a bit and you'll realize how good it is.
B0000C9ZLD|2.0|&quot;Is This It?&quot; is a great album, but that's no reason to release an (attempted) carbon copy of it as a follow up.  That's what businessmen do, not artists.  Actually, I guess the Ramones did it, too, but they were so brilliant that no one cared.  The Strokes don't have that luxury....
B0000A36J1|5.0|Although I have watched the original 'The Two Towers' many times, I was enthralled by the extended version. So many of the side stories are brought to life here that one wonders how the film managed without them. Merry and Pip and the entwater are real entertainment; Frodo and Sam and the elvin rope really illustrate the elves gifts; some parts of Aragorn's background and skills are introduced. Best of all is to see the forest which moved to Helm's Deep to slaughter the orcs. That to me is an essential part of the story.  I shall watch this version again and again.

0792157850|4.0|After the success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, series creator George Lucas and director Steven Spielberg took the Indiana Jones series into its dark second installment, 1984's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.<br />Written by American Graffiti's Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz and set in 1935 (making this film a prequel to the first film), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom takes its archaeologist hero (Harrison Ford) from a swank Shanghai night club to the rain forest of India as Indy, his orphaned sidekick Short Round (Ke Huy Quan) and his very reluctant companion Willie Scott (Kate Capshaw, who would later be Mrs. Steven Spielberg) go on a quest for an Indian village's sacred stone, which has been stolen by evil Thugee followers of the Kali cult.<br />Indy is at first reluctant to go on this quest for yet another mythical artifact, but when the villagers tell the archaeologist and his two companions that the followers of Kali, now based in Pankot Palace, have stolen their children, Jones agrees to pay the new Maharajah of Pankot a visit.  His interest is peaked when a dying young escapee arrives at the village and hands Indy a scrap of cloth with a fragment of tapestry.  Reading its Sanskrit inscription and by looking at the pictographs on the cloth, Indiana discovers that the villagers' sacred stone is one of five Sankara stones, left to men by the Hindu god Shiva.  When a puzzled Short Round asks Indy what a Sankara stone represents, the professor/adventurer replies, \\"Fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.\\"<br />But Indy's quest for \\"fortune and glory\\" takes a disturbing turn when the trio reaches Pankot Palace.  The prime minister, Chattar Lal (Roshan Seth) appears to be just another Oxford-trained Indian bureaucrat, but in reality he's one of Kali priest Mola Ram's (Amrish Puri) lieutenants.  Soon, Indy, Short Round and Willie go from honored guests to prisoners when they discover the goings-on behind the high walls of Pankot Palace.<br />Although Temple of Doom is an enjoyable adventure film, its dark tones (both in storytelling and visual terms) and a few gory scenes involving a really gross banquet and a human sacrifice made it the least favorite entry in the series.  And even though it was rated PG, the criticism Temple of Doom received caused director Spielberg to be one of the advocates of the PG-13 rating that the Motion Picture Association of America created within months of the film's release.<br />Nevertheless, the film's action set pieces (some of them conceived for Raiders but left out for time constraints) are still thrilling, Spielberg's directing is top-notch and John Williams' 1930s-flavored musical score is, as always, brilliant.  Although the other two films in the series are more fun and lighter in tone, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is still worth watching.<br />Just not, of course, right after dinner.<br />Alex Diaz-Granadosle of Doom is an enjoyable adventure film, its dark tones (both in storytelling and visual terms) and a few gory scenes involving a really gross banquet and a human sacrifice made it the least favorite entry in the series.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|I broke down and decided to give her CD a chance. I loved the earlier ones but wasn't sure of her new edgier move. I was wrong! Very ... and smooth... ....! I do agree that it really isn't for the younger crowd but you have to understand that Britney has stated she is trying to reach the older audience now. Sorry young girls Britney's growing up! Breathe on Me...You done good with that one Britney! Be proud of this CD it's great!
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Britney's new CD seems &quot;Britney&quot; but a little more mature. But the real problem is...Why she copy other singers?? Her CD sounds like Kylie, Madonna, Beyonc... She seems she has to copy other people to make a good CD. And for those who say that Christina haven't got much to do after this Britney's CD... I can say YES! After this CD I realized that Christina haven't got anything in common with Britney. Congratulations Christina; You Won!!!
B000084T18|4.0|If you want to get an idea of what 'Power of a Dollar' would have sounded like, then get 'Guess who's Back'.  His first album with Shady/Aftermath isn't as pure as the bootlegs or mixtapes as far as hip hop is concerned, but there's no major crap on this disc.  Even what would be considered filler material for the album is still pretty good.  There are more things to listen to than just the radio hits so give a listen.
6302516919|5.0|I personally think Stephen King is a wonderful author and his movies are just as great, Christine is one of my favorite Movies and as old as this movie is it will alway's be scary in it's own right way's and just make's you shiver and want more.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am absolutily amazed. I was wary to buy this CD, what if i hated it? Before i had chance to go by it a friend bought it for me, and we both sat for fifteen minutes just listening to his voice and these amazing songs. He has an all new kind of sound, but yet the same. It is hard to explain but there is no way that anyone on earth could live without this CD.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|After several close listens to this CD, I have to say that I'm impressed. First, let me say that if you didn't like the original Let It Be, you probably won't like this version. And this new version won't suddenly turn Let It Be into a Beatles classic rivaling Revolver. I didn't give this 5 stars because the CD is great (I never considered Let It Be a great Beatle's record anyway). The music is, for the most part, the same as that in the original. But I think McCartney did an excellent job correcting some of the mistakes Spector made in producing the original. For that reason, I give it 5 stars. I never liked the choir in Long and Winding Road (although I did like the strings). He removed the \\"chatter\\" that preceded and followed some of the songs, and thankfully got rid of Maggie Mae and Dig It (what was Spector smoking when he made that decision?).   The biggest improvement, however, is the inclusion of Don't Let Me Down. This is the star of the show and, in my opinion, makes it worth the price on its own. It's an outstanding version and John's voice sounds great. I always thought the original sounded muffled. In addition, the quality of the sound is vastly improved (also reason enough to buy the CD). And to his credit, McCartney didn't try to \\"bury\\" the other Beatles. It sounds like he gave as much attention to John's and George's songs (and Ringo's drumming) as he did to his own songs. In short, I think the claim by Paul that this is how Let It Be should have been is accurate. It sounds like a very good recording of a well rehearsed Beatles playing \\"live\\" (ie, no overdubbing). I can only hope that none of the money goes into that pervert's pocket (Beatle's fans know who I mean).
B0000AUHPG|5.0|This DVD set rocks.  Image quality is better than some recent film DVD's.  And yes, it's full 2.35:1 (I don't know how you can show this film any other way, given Leone and Cinematographer Colli's use of frame-- Not to mention the \\"John Ford\\" vistas.).  I have MGM's THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY for comparison, and the image quality of that DVD doesn't even come close.  And what's crazy (after all my raving about the image) is that the sound is even better.  I've NEVER before heard Ennio Morricone without it sounding like it's played on a mishandled LP.<br />I'm too young to have seen this film when it was in the theaters.  I bought it to see it with my dad, who's a big Western fan (It was either this or DJANGO).  Suffice to say, it did not disappoint.  It's the first time he's seen the ENTIRE Sergio Leone masterpiece, uncut.  It's all there: the tedium, the off-pacing, the weird camera angles, the extreme depth of field, all of the wonderful stuff that throw \\"purist\\" Western fans into a tizzy.  Claudia Cardinale in her prime can still clober any current model/actress in vogue in the looks department.  And no matter how long it's been, there's still a small gasp when you realize that it's Henry Fonda in the black hat-role (The role freakishly DOES fit the blue-eyed actor.).  And the two (until-now) missing scenes with Jason Robards--  the film wouldn't be complete without them, added length or not.<BR>   <BR>Now if they could only release Leone's A FIST FULL OF DYNAMITE with this much quality, then we'd all be happy.  I want to shock my dad again with how good DVD's can be with old(er) flicks.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney Spears is probably the most awful thing to hit music within the last 20 years.  She is so terrible that it is painful to listen to her.  She cannot sing at all.  God only knows why she would title a song &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;.  It just asks to be made fun of.  It sounds like someone is choking her on every song on this stupid CD.  She is not a pop star and she is not the next madonna.  She does the same thing over and over again and people keep eating it up.  Like &quot;I'm a Slave 2 U&quot; is so much like &quot;Me Against the Music&quot;.  She is so afraid to try new things.  Pink is awesome.  Buy here albun, Try This, instead.  Pink is the next madonna, becuase Pink keeps re-inventing herself, where as britney is too afraid to even change her hair color!  Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage!!!
B0000E1WNV|3.0|Many reviewers are right - it's a fantastic concert.  Bruce and co really gave it their all.  The first disc is great.  The second disc, however, is where the problem is.  The menu function doesn't work, so you can't access the special features.  I will return my copy to the shop, and wait for the second, proper, batch, if Sony ever wakes up and does something about it.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|As someone's explained to these Paul haters who think they're more authentic Beatles experts than HE--a Beatle--is, all three surviving Beatles were supportive of this and involved until George's death and all 4 are on record as the originally released version not being what they'd intended. (Read George's comments on the reissue of All Things Must Pass to see that he found it very difficult not to do same thing--liberating the tunes from the overproduction--on his own album.) Things were so strained they didn't even want to finish it; John's view from interviews (with Jan Wenner, Playboy, The Anthology) seems the most to the point: that Spector did the best he could with a lot of tape that the rest of them couldn't bear to deal with at the time. That's why this is such a great great reissue. (I've been waiting for this for nearly 20 years.) Fans know the history and know why this is important. And we all understand the way things were then between them, and that they all were looking for a \\"pure\\" album. (Paul haters, be sure to note John's request in the liner notes of George Martin that they not put any of his production \\"rubbish\\" on this record. By his own accounts and all surviving members, this is as close to what they intended the album to be as I think any fan could hope for or expect.) And the sound and songs on this are incredible. Everything: Paul's bass, John's voice and slide guitar, George's deft playing and clever songs, Ringo's being so incredibly solid and sensitive to the tunes, and Billy Preston's presence is so natural and groovy... it's musicians playing real music and enjoying each other musically despite the fact that the band was falling apart and they were growing apart individually. But they were still an incredible band. I believe the Beatles: this record is as they intended it. And it sounds great! (And it's not at all supposed to compete with [Sgt. Pepper] for those grousers either. It's supposed to NOT compete with that. That's why thisis such an important release for those of us who love the band, respect them as individual musicians, and appreciate these songs.) It stands on its own, finally as it was intended to.
B00009TB5G|4.0|I'll admit I was underwhelmed by the first LOTR film yet, when I bought the extended edition, the experience completely changed by opinion and made me a fan. The Two Towers, IMHO, was far more clunky, poorly written, and far less engaging. Does this extended edition work?<br />This DVD is worth it for the extras alone. As before the wealth and ease of extras, including  the casual, friendly manner in which they are introduced, make the viewer feel welcome and satied with info. No stone goes unturned, as it were. Nothing feels left out. <br />The film itself, however, carries over 40 minutes of extra footage. Only a third, in my opinion, make the film better. The rest are either extraneous, irritating or (in one scene) downright embarrassing. It's a scattershot effort. I would have preferred a selection of deleted scenes among the extras that were filmed but didn't work at all, and the addition of only 15-20 minutes of the better footage would have been, for me, a better choice. It is clear (and the creators admit) that TTT got the short end of the narrative stick...and it shows.<br />Bottom-line? Worth it for the extras and for some of the added footage that do help make this a slightly better (but still not great) film.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|Honestly, I don't have the original Let It Be. I've listened to it so many times and at some point I was really going to buy already. But somehow, I just hesitated and then didn't buy it at all. There's something wrong with the overall track by track flow. And the sound...Believe me I have almost all the Beatle Albums and when I heard the original Let it be...it was one of the worst sound I've ever heard. And the whole album in a way was quite unattracting to my ears even though it contains many classic songs such as \\"The Long and Winding Road\\", \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Get Back\\".       Enter Let It Be...Naked. At first (and again) I'm really not quite sure if I'll be buying it. So I listened to it first and the sound was totally different. This is much more sharper, crispier, cleaner. And in the end I bought it (and at the back of my mind thinking...get ready to be dissatisfied). I listened to it from the beginning to the end. And what did I discover...that this Let It Be is the official Let It Be as Paul McCartney and Ringgo Starr proclaimed prior to its release. This Let It Be release deserves to belong to the other classic Beatles' albums [which with the help of Sir George Martin, produced crisp, clean and sharp sounding releases such as Revolver, The White Album, Abbey Road and Rubber Soul which may explain why EMI haven't made an SACD hybrid version/DSD edition of their albums because the sound is already great especially on the latter albums (starting from Rubber Soul) when it was first released 1987 or 1990].        Try to listen the CD from start to the end. Of course, the classic \\"aura\\" sound is lost...But try listening to Let It Be (Original) and compare it to the sound of, let's say, Revolver. Then listen to Let It Be (Naked) and compare it again to Revolver and you'll get what I mean. Try also to observe the track flows of both the original and Naked. For me it's really a vast improvement.       And so, I say...This is THE-SHOULD-HAVE-BEEN CLASSIC LET IT BE release. And I'm really happy that I bought it.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|I have been waiting forever for 'Once Upon a Time in the West' to finally hit DVD and now it's here. Trust me, it was well worth the wait. Sergio Leone's masterpiece centers around Jill McBain (played by the beautifal Claudia Cardinale), a woman brought into a struggle for land by some very tragic circumstances. Cardinale steals many scenes with her sheer beauty and ability to optimize Leone's signiture style of facial expressions and body actions  to express emotion. Henry Fonda shocked many by going against his usual castings by playing the ruthless Frank, a killer without a conscience. Charles Bronson is wonderful as Leone's signature mystery man without a name, and Jason Robards shines as Cheyenne, a roughneck accused of a crime he didn't commit.<br />OUATITW is quite different than Leone's other well known westerns starring Clint Eastwood, although he does still capture some of their magic here . Where this film differs is in it's characters and sheer scope. Leone's style is still well intact, but his storytelling is much more diverse here, not simply relying on one mechanic throughout.<br />The DVD was very well done with a good quality picture and adequate sound. The second DVD in the set is loaded with features including documenteries and various featurettes. The commentary tracts are also well done and very informative as well as entertaining.<br />All in all, this DVD was well worth the wait. For fans of the film, this is a gem for the collection that must be bought.

B00006LLNU|4.0|REASONS WHY I SHOULD BE MAKING FUN OF THIS ALBUM:<br />1. The songs have no titles, and the name of the record is &quot;( )&quot;<br />2. The singer sings in a made-up language that basically consists of him saying &quot;you sat along the fire&quot; and &quot;you're so&quot; in funny ways.<br />3. There are no liner notes, but rather 12 blank pages that the band insists you write your own interpretation of the nonsensical lyrics on (which translates to &quot;we're lazy, and this makes us look cool and arty&quot;).<br />REASON WHY I CAN'T MAKE FUN OF THIS ALBUM:<br />1. The minor silliness of the band's ways are FAR outweighed by the pure beauty, emotion, and, at times, power of this album.<br />This album is absolutely incredible.  Take one of the most beautiful things you can think of, and multiply that by 10, and you'll pretty much get the idea of how amazing this album is.  None of the songs are shorter than 6 minutes, with most songs on the first half being in 6-8 minute range and the ones on the last half in the 10-12 minute range.  They hover for gorgeously extended lengths of time and take time to unfold and completely envelope the listener.  ( ) is definitely a headphones album, as well as the quintessential &quot;winter&quot; album, the honor previously held by the Cure with &quot;17 seconds&quot; until I found this one.  The first half of this album (or &quot;(&quot; as I like to call it), is light and optimistic, with more emphasis on keyboard than guitar, while the 2nd half (or &quot;)&quot;) is bleaker and more melancholic, with more emphasis on guitar (which is played with a cello bow).  The standout tracks are definitely #1 (the video will change your life), #3, #4, and undoubtedly #8, the album's chilling climax, with the most amazing drumming I've ever heard (OK, so that's a bit of an exaggeration, but it's still awesome).<br />THIS ALBUM IS MOST HIGHLY RECOMMEDED FOR:<br />-Fans of Radiohead, Bjork, Mum, My Bloody Valentine, Godspeed you black emporer, Mogwai, or (don't laugh) Enya<br />-People who prefer long, beautiful, drawn-out mood pieces to catcy, poppy, 3-minute singles<br />-People who have the time to sit and listen to an 80 minute album in one sitting<br />NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:<br />-People with short attention spans<br />-People who are expecting something aggressive or hard-rocking<br />-People who overuse the word &quot;pretentious&quot;i, or (don't laugh) Enya<BR>-People who prefer long, beautiful, drawn-out mood pieces to catcy, poppy, 3-minute singles<BR>-People who have the time to sit and listen to an 80 minute album in one sitting<br />NOT RECOMMENDED FOR:<BR>-People with short attention spans<BR>-People who are expecting something aggressive or hard-rocking<BR>-People who overuse the word &quot;pretentious&quot;

In her diary it's like a story she explains the way her rooms and how she had to leave most of her things behind. She talks about the other family that is staying with them, she also talks about that they had no privacy they had no shower so they either showered by the kitchen sink and warn the other people that they couldn't go in the kitchen or carry a bucket of water to another room for more privacy. That's what the whole family had to go through no school, no friends, and nothing fun to do. So imagine having to spend several months in an attic with out seeing the outside world.<br /> Anne Frank was a young girl, she had a sister and her both parents that where Jews. They also stayed up in the attic with another family named the Van Daan and they had a son named peter. Mrs. Van Daan was a lady that was hard to get along with, she never wanted to share anything and she always had mean remark to Anne, but Anne learn how to ovoid her comments and just stay out of her way. Peter their son was a young man that liked to do what he wasn't suppose to, because they had books that the kids where not allowed to read and he always managed to get his hands on the books and most of the time he would get caught. Margot thought of her self as a mature person she would always act correctly and that's why Mrs. Van Daan liked her, she was very smart and she like to read all the books that they had taken with because she was the only one from the three kids that was allowed to read them.<br /> In the beginning of book she talks about how she tries to very good in school and so everything that her parents tell her to do. And she also has a boyfriend that she walks with to school and later they had to break up because his mom did not approve and because they went into hiding. When they are in the attic she talks about how she misses her house and everything that they left behind because they couldn't keep most only the things that they needed and they also had some things in neighbors houses, so that when they had to leave the hiding they wouldn't of lost everything.<br /> Anne also gets taught by her father while they are in hiding because they couldn't go out he also taught Peter and Margot. He teaches them the basic things that they have to learn and he would also give them home work and have them read out loud to reach other. Anne liked doing that because she loved to go to school, she always talked about that she wanted to make her parents proud of her so that was one thing that she could do, be a smart girl. Anne went through that and I won't tell you the ending, but one thing I can say is that it worth you time reading it.he three kids that was allowed to read them.<br /> In the beginning of book she talks about how she tries to very good in school and so everything that her parents tell her to do.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|I am really liking this holiday album, Whitney is back... Her voice sounds soo much better and is stronger and clearer these days... The duet with her daughter is very cute and shows that their is a diva in training... Thoe entire album is enjoyable and relaxing, its great to see Whitney back and in a better and peaceful place... This is a MUST have holiday album..
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This CD is totally worth it! If you didn't like Britney's old CD's try this one. The CD is upbeat and includes a lot of other popular artist's influences. I was excited to purchase this CD knowing Britney was eager to crossover out of the &quot;teen bop&quot;, I was overly impressed and definetly agree that she reached her goal.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Listening to this CD is like watching the movie with no screen. It is absoloutly phenomenal, second to none but ithe Lord of the Rings Scores, which also make you feel like you're in the movie with just your headphones on. This score really makes the movie, I don't know what I would do without it! I live on it. It's like yoga without the effort, therapeutic. I can listen to this repeatedly without it getting to me. It suffices until the DVD is released. Get this cd!!!!
076790592X|5.0|This book was an awesome read.  You feel totaly conected to Mitch and Morrie.  In each chapter I found something that was either applicable to my life now or I know it will be in the future.  I feel that everybody who reads ths book will decide to take a step back to look at their life, and reevaluate where they are, where they are going, and what they really want.  The reader really can feel the love that Morrie has for everyone in his life and for his life.  And you can feel the transformation that Mitch goes through during this last class.  This book is a must read for everyone.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|This sequel is full of non-stop action that - as they claim - lifts the bar on what to expect in movies of this nature. The Wachowski brothers and their team have definitely outdone themselves on that score. The fight scene between Keanu Reaves and the hundreds of Smiths has to be one of the best martial arts sequences on film (OK, maybe not). The special effects are crazy, with Neo (Reaves) gaining superman like powers that enables him to fly, and bounce off walls like Spiderman. That isn't new but there are more such sequences in the sequel.<br />The emotional attachment between Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss gets stronger and we see more of the human-side of Neo than we did in the Matrix. (I thought the sexual scenes in the film were unnecessary) Lawrence Fishburne doesn't fail to disappoint as the general with a dream who inspires the resistance. More characters are introduced like the twins with their crazy hair and ability to become temporarily invisible, the Keymaker, Jada Pinkett Smith (Morpheus' love interest) and the Chief architect...<br />The extras on this DVD are excellent, check out the MTV spoof with Justin Timberlake and that dude from `Dude where's my car'. It's funny, especially the Chief Architect part, a definite must-see.<br />All in all, a great sequel, don't believe everything you read though...Watch it and decide for yourself.
B0000TB03W|5.0|This concert is totally awesome!  If you want to see an awesome concert, pick up this DVD.  I happened to be in the audience the night this was taped, and Shania had us on our feet the whole night!  I was singing along.  Sparks fly, fireworks erupt, It's just great!  A+!!!
B000002C1V|5.0|This record saddens me.<br />Well, I guess the record doesn't sadden me nearly as much as the personal drama involved in its making, and fans' reaction (or overreaction) to that drama.<br />Yes, the band wasn't getting along at the time.  Yes, Roger Waters was attempting (and succeeding) to iron-fist the project.  No, the album is not a failure in any sense of the word.  Artistically, I would go so far as to say that this is arguably the single finest 'Floyd album ever produced.  That statement certainly depends a great deal on one's own personal tastes (I also like Meddle and The Wall), but since this is my review, my tastes are the ones that currently matter.<br />This record embodies Roger Waters' finest hour; his vocals are achingly emotional and drive the project flawlessly.  The Final Cut is certainly the most powerful record 'Floyd has ever produced.  Lyrically, no punches are pulled, and whether or not one agrees with the political statement made, one cannot doubt the sincerity of the message or the power of the delivery.<br />The arrangement and flow is superior, easily matching, if not surpassing, The Wall.  This record truly demonstrates Waters' genius, even when embroiled in the mess that was Pink Floyd at the time.  The mediocrity of 'Floyd's next record, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, serves to amplify and highlight the lyrical genius and overwhelming vision Roger Waters brought to the troubled table of this legendary band.<br />Judge this record on its artistic merits as opposed to the troubles of the band that produced it.
B00005RG6B|5.0|If your a fan there is no excuse, for you not to have this in your collection, and if you want to relive this show there is no better way. All concerts should be captured this good.
B000002H70|5.0|Yep.  Top 5.<br />The Cure is a very good band.  Some folks don't like Robert Smith's voice, some don't like the gloom n' doom, yet The Cure is an artistically magnificent band, and this is far and away the finest work they, or anyone remotely resembling them, have ever produced.<br />If you have a heart, if you've ever been in love, if you've ever been hurt, unless you're a cyborg, this album will draw tears.  And to me, that's a good thing.  Show's you're still alive.
B000000OQY|4.0|how can that 1 dude say that one in a million made him have a shower? what is he thinking? and he thinks &quot;wham&quot; are better? hmmmmm whatever you un-educated idiot.<br />This whole cd is pretty awesome, the live tracks show you how good GNR were if you got to see them in person, and the accoustic tracks, well they are pure genius. Such a pitty that we wont be able to hear anymore of theese from such a great band.
630542828X|2.0|The movie is fine... but the book is an amazing read.  There is so much detail and nuance lost in the adaption to a visual medium.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Miss Spears is In The Zone on her 4th ablum. This album is delightfully non-cry-ie. I like Britneys last three albums, but after awhile they got annoying because she sounded like she was singing in a cryish voice. Like a baby. This Cd is tottaly diffrent...she took a chance with a diffrent style and it worked in her advantage. Rock on Britney! Let me give you the run down on this hot album.<BR> TRACKS<BR>1. M.A.T.M - 8.5 This track is deffiently made fo the club.    It has a great hook and the beat is funky and fun<BR>2. (I got that)Boom Boom - 9.5 (this song will make you shake yo BUM BUM To prove if you got that BOOM BOOM. Its got a good beat as well)<BR>3. Showdown- 7.9 This is a dare song. Defiently good if your in the \\"Don't test me mood. I'm liable to show you up\\" <BR>4. Breathe On Me- 5.5 This is defiently one of the least of my favs. This sounds a little too techno for me. Its very diffrent from the rest of the album.<BR>5.Early Morin'- 9.0 This a fun song all of us teenagers can relate to. Its spunky and teasy.<BR>6.Toxic-9.6 This song is hooking. Britneys voice is very growly in this track which is awesome.<BR>7.Outrageous-10.0 this Song is tight. My fav one on the album. This song will hook you like no other. Even if you didnt want to be hooked...its all over for ya when you hear this one.<BR>8.Touch of My Hand-8.2 This is one of Brits more sexy songs. No where near as Dirty as she could of been and critics need to leave her alone. Go pick on other Britney wanna-bes(Christina a.k.a Crusty-na)<BR>9.The Hook Up-10.0 This song will have you singing along even if you dont know the words...its very difficult to get this song out your head. Its defiently a dancey song. <BR>10.Shadow-9.5 This song is deep. Good beat and Brit sings wonderful on it. <BR>11.Brave New Girl-9.5 Again this track sounds a little techno but more happy pop. Lyrics are fun.<BR>12.Everytime-10.0 This song is without doubt one of Britneys best ballads ever! This will put a tear in your eyebecause you can feel her emotion on this one. <BR>13.M.A.T.M Remix-5.0 I don't really care for the remix I think the first one was GREAT, but its still Good. <BR>Britney is deffiently all alone in the zone that no other artist can reach.<BR>ALl and All Britney is deffiently the best pop female singer/proformer out there. This album is diffrent from her bubble-gum pop image. Britney will be around longer than Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera and any other blonde Britney wanna-bes because she started it ...she brought the level and everyone wanted to copy her. Once again she set the bar time for people to copy her again. Watch out world Miss Spears is back and IN THE ZONE!!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|All of the scenes are wonderful! Let me just say that some people were not responding to the \\"Platinum Series Special Extended Edition\\", which does NOT come with the bookends, gollum statue, and making of the gollum statue. (Consequently, it is 1/2 the price though as well.) Criticism on the \\"making of the gollum statue\\" should not be attached to this edition.<br />All of the extended scenes are marvellous! The story is more fleshed out and better-prepared. The best movie is made even better! As I know what is coming in Return of the King (not the movie, but the story), let me just say that it was very refreshing to see additional foreshadowing. The Treebeard/Merry/Pippen storyline is fleshed out a lot more. The threat Aragorn poses to Sauron is better-developed. All of this is good preparation for the third film! And you get more of Howard Shore's seamlessly brilliant music. Gotta see this extended version!<br />As for the person who had 3rd and 4th discs that do not work, they are merely defective discs (which happens in all movies to a small percentage of discs)--exchange it where you bought it from and you will have working 3rd and 4th discs. The 3rd and 4th discs, though I have not seen it all yet, have clips from Return of the King as well (just enough to be a teaser), and a great tribute to J. R. R. Tolkien. Note that all of the features are completely different than those for the Fellowship's extended edition. I can comment on the ones I have seen: the aspects of JRR Tolkien's life that are discussed are different, as is the writing of the script. So do not fear about getting duplicate material on the third and fourth discs either! All of the material is just awesome! Where is the 6-star rating for those few exceptional movies?! Anyone who even remotely liked the original at least has to see this extended edition once. Anyone who wants The Two Towers would be crazy to not get the extended edition. Oh, and one more thing...if you already have The Two Towers theatrical release, then you get $5 back when you purchase the Extended Edition, and then you can sell the Theatrical version on E-Bay and the Extended Edition would cost you very little, if anything!
B0000DD7LB|1.0|when i listened to this album on mtv.com's the leak i was shocked to find out that this didn't sound like britney spears!<BR>the first single \\"me aganist the music\\" gets old just like the rest of the album fast. this album is full of club music.....bad club music. the sexual part of the album gets chessy and lame rather fast. it sounds like she is just learning about sex on this album. she PATHETICALY tries to be like christina on this album Unfotently it fails. christina did the stripped album cause she was being herself. britney just tries to rip off other artists on this album including her idol who i can't believe worked with her. this is britney's worst album!<br />\\"slave for you\\" doesn't even look that bad now compared to this album!<br />skip this album and get pink's new album at least she can sing and write all of her songs by herself.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|this album is awesome, it is utterly addictive. britney has definitely put alot of effort into finding new sounds, to add a different flavour, which is especially evident her awesome song toxic. the more you listen to this album the more it grows on you.

B0000DD7LB|1.0|Then you will find this CD silly and childish.<BR>The lyrics are for 18-21 yr olds who are experiencing nightlife for the first time.Its blatant sexual aspect says otherwise but the blatant and immature attempt at trying to sound grown-up make it hard for anyone over 21 to get into.<BR>Its surprising that the CD has P.Diddy,R.Kelly,Moby and other well known artists on it because the music is extremely generic-sounds like every thing out today thrown together without flow or even a try at authenticity.<BR>If you are into music then as you listen to this CD you will be able to name the artist she copied.<BR>Britneys CD is just a danceable rerun of all the stuff out today.Nothing original here.<BR>There is nothing to grab onto and equate it with an artist behind it.It sounds as though she is trying to grab anyones attention with the crazy mixed types of music-ALL genres are represented here.Except maybe hard metal.<BR>It smacks of commercialism and is a little disengenious to anyone with a knowledge of music.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|This CD is really different of the other! It's less bubble pop than it was with her previous CDs and that's a really great CD. It sounds a bit Indian by moment too and it adds a little something. I was a little disapointed because there are only 2 ballads on this CD but they are really great. The rest of the CD is more energic and have beat even if 2 or 3 songs are a bit dull according to me. But this is a really good CD, worth buying!
B0000TB03W|5.0|This dvd is awesome and a must for any Shania fan.
B00009MGQL|3.0|It's already been said before, but the production on this album is bad. The drums on this album are purposely mixed &quot;hot&quot; and they sound like a distorted mess. Plan B and Pork-u-pine are cool songs but the drums are so distorted I can barely stand listening to them. I don't mind the use of sequencers and synthesizers like some do, but purposely distorting things doesn't do it for me. <br />The positives are some of the songs that really catch my ear:<BR>&quot;Plan B&quot; has a really spacey sound with a clean expressive lead riff. Pork-u-pine has this interesting use of samples with a lyrical lead. &quot;Line Dancing with Monkeys&quot; has a really mean riff and solo. &quot;JB's Blues&quot; and &quot;Pay Me No Mind&quot; are good. My favorite songs that sound like more traditional mellow JB songs are &quot;Bulgaria&quot; and &quot;Why Lord Oh Why?&quot;. The last song sends chills down my spine it is so eerie and ethereal. <br />I give this 4 stars for music, 2 stars for sound for an average of 3 stars.
B0000TB03W|5.0|She did it again!! This dvd is the best yet for any Shania fan.  I was also at Grant park and watched the NBC Special but the dvd tops it all!  It is packed with the real show and just as exciting as being there.  Shania is definitely rearing to go in Chicago!!
B00005JKC3|1.0|Safe to say this film was very poor. Considering recent comic book adaptations have for the most part been excellent of late this was a major disapointment, I would consider Batman and Robin more entertaining.<br />Acting wise the movie is poor, Eric Bana's accent is bad considering how poor his fellow Aussies do with accents thats saying alot. The emotions run from depressed to really depressed, to super depressed, their was no range of emotions, no smiles, just constant monotone sadness. Nolte seems drunk or on drugs in the film which probably isn't short of the truth. The bad guy actors seem to have little to no motivation in the film and have absolutely no reason to act in the manner which they do. Whats worse is you have no reason to care for the good guys, their is no sympathy engendered towards them.<br />Length, its about an hour too long, this film would be fine in the span of 80 to 90 minutes, short and sweet but its just way too long.<br />Special effects are poor considering what is currently out there, they seem fake. <br />The split screen effects are just arty and makes the film seem even longer.<br />All in all my friend recomended this film, I will reconsider any recomendation he gives in the future. <br />View with Caution
B000002U9W|4.0|Facts: This album is roughly 52 minutes long.  It consists of 5 tracks.  The first is roughly 30 minutes long and contains no set lyrics.  The second song, &quot;If&quot; is sung and written by Roger Waters with guitar alongside.  The third song, &quot;Summer of '68&quot; is sung and written by Richard Wright.  The fourth song, &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; is sung and written by David Gilmour.  The fifth song is approx. 12 minutes long and contains no set of lyrics.<br />Opinions: I thought this was a piece of crap when I first listened to it.  The title track seemed like psychadelic garbage.  It will most likely take the listener a few attempts, but this album will most likely grow on you.  If you are NOT into the idea that this is considered a &quot;psychadelic&quot; album, I lend my words here to say that it does not REQUIRE any assistance from psychotropic substances.  <br />If you enjoy the song &quot;Echoes&quot;, the first track may not exactly be what you are expecting since it does not have any lyrics as &quot;Echoes&quot; does.  Also, it does have more orchestration of horns and string instruments than &quot;Echoes&quot;.  But it will grow on you when you listen to it more than once and discover the layers.  Very soothing and can put you to sleep by the time you reach minute 5.<br />I don't like the voice of Roger Waters, so I don't enjoy &quot;If&quot;.  Also, the song feels too naked after the layers of the title track.  I enjoyed the nakedness to the opening and closing tracks off of Animals, but this stuffed in the middle of the album, just leads me to wait patiently for &quot;Summer of '68&quot;.  I suppose if I had listened to this album in its original format and not on CD, &quot;If&quot; would indeed be the opening number for the second side.  But on CD, it doesn't work for me.  If you enjoy his lyrics (the feeling of these are more Dark Side... than The Wall), then you will most likely enjoy this song.<br />&quot;Summer of '68&quot; will bring the listener to a sort of up-tempo feeling after the slowness of &quot;If&quot;.  Richard Wright's song will most likely be catchy and if you enjoy his piano and David Gilmour's guitar and horned instruments, you will most likely enjoy this song.<br />I enjoy David Gilmour's &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot;.  If you enjoy his guitar or his voice, you will enjoy.  If you think his lyrical abilities are on par with the stuff you find in the corners of your eyes when you wake up, then this is better than your expectations.<br />The final piece is only a waste of space during the moments when there is no music.  It will help the listener fall to sleep (if they haven't done so already), but the sound effects of food cooking and talking will also make you hungry.  It's a fine ending to the album.  <br />Since this album was briefly considered for contributions to the compilation, Echoes, I understand that this album is the least favorite of all the members of Pink Floyd.  I hope this was helpful.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|For the hardcore Beatlefan, this is a must-own, but don't toss your original copy either, whether it's on CD, LP, or as I suspect in most instances, both.  The obvious benefit is not only the \\"clean up\\" of the tracks which sounds great--you can hear Billy Preston come through where he was previously stifled, and the removal of the Spector-noise on Long and Winding Road is an improvement on a song that would give us a glimpse of PM heading towards the orchestral treacle he became so fond of in subsequent years (e.g. \\"My Love\\").  To me, the biggest improvement is Across the Universe--no more flapping birdies or heavenly chorus, just JL telling us that nothing's gonna change his world in the simplest of ways.  I miss \\"Dig It\\" and I miss \\"Maggie May\\" because I miss JL and want to be reminded of him in every way possible.  I also love the way that \\"Maggie May\\" transitions into \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" in the original.  But the addition of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" on Naked is worth the purchase price alone, and what a version it is.  In sum, buy it, play it, and treasure every moment.
B000006TRV|3.0|Facts- Two discs, 26 tracks.  Features &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, part 2&quot;, &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Hey You&quot;, &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;, and &quot;Young Lust&quot;.  All songs written by Roger Waters.<br />Opinion-I don't want to write long.  I just want to say three things:<br />1.  If you are curious because of all the talk, check it out.  If you go into it with moderate expectations, you will likely see what all the buzz is about.<BR>2.  This is my least favorite Pink Floyd album.  <BR>3.  The songs are incredibly sad and morose.  Make sure you have some sort of human contact immediately after you listen to this album.
B000088E6D|5.0|As my husband pointed out, Michael Buble doesn't necessarily have the age to give some of these songs the \\"flair\\" that they need, but he comes pretty darn close!<BR>We absolutely love this CD!  It's hands-down the best CD we've purchased all year.  That's saying a lot coming from two very picky Virgos and fellow singers.  For people who love musical theatre, classic \\"standard songs,\\" and anything evoking thoughts of Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra and a glamorous time unfortunately long past, Michael Buble is smooooooooth, ..., and very, very classy!  You can't go wrong with this CD!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I first listened to this CD when it was leaked on an MTV site and only liked one song Everytime.  Now that I got the CD for my sister and listened to it again, I must say this CD is mostly very good.  I am 43 years old and a Madonna fan as well as listening and liking a number of other music types i.e. New Wave and Alternative.  It's hard to describe this CD.  It's got New Wave/Alternative instrumentals along with some Middle Eastern influences and Madonna influences.  Like a good vocalist Britney casts her voice to have the same tones as the instruments in the backgrounds (either that or it was the other way around they made instrumentals to match her voice).  The register in her voice is, as said, she does indeed use a lower register in a number of the songs on this CD.  In fact the song Shadow is one heck of a standout because her vocals are so good in this--the best Britney song yet.  A number of the songs play like Madonna's Immaculate Collection--great dance beats and vocals to the tune of the instrumentals.  What makes it extra nice is she also adapted to the New Wave/Alternative style of singing for a number of the songs.  Toxic is especially good.  The best I can suggest is to ask for a listen of the CD from a friend--it's a very good overall CD.  Great for dance tunes and sets a new standard for pop music--earning Britney's deserving title of a Pop Princess.  Madonna fans will like this CD.  After listening to this CD I think I'm going to get Madonna's latest CD--Britney's new CD reminds me again of why I like Madonna music.
6301967992|5.0|I started getting interested by vampires with this movie.  I saw it for the first time at age 8 in 1982.  It made me laugh a lot, and the overall texture of the set, lighting, music, cast and script, creates tension, even though the movie is meant to be funny.  My parents presented it to me as a comedy, but when they first saw it, back in 67, my mother got scared!  Let's just say that she doesn't know much about vampires...
B00008S2VG|1.0|I hate to say but being a fan of many years, THIS ALBUM STINKS!! What the hell is this piece of crud?! This album is just a slap dash dish of electronic noise and sloppily arranged songs that have sloppy rhythm and just bloodless melody to them. <br /> I admire that she could go for 20 years without a bad album so I'll continue to be a fan but I stand by my dislike of this awful album. Maybe next time Maddy! Now excuse me while I put in &quot;Ray of Light&quot;.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|I am completely amazed by the negative reaction from many of the reviews to ths album ! What ungrateful people some of you are. So what if its a greatest hits album with all the songs coming from his albums - what exactly do you expect a greatest hits compilation to be ??? Of course its not going to have all of everyone's favourite songs on it, there are quite a few that I would have liked to see on it but maybe a lot of other people wouldnt like them. But as for the argument that he is cashing in ... PEOPLE GET REAL ! This album is part of Sony's &quot;Essential&quot; series and comes with a FREE bonus CD of unreleased material (in other words effectively a CD of &quot;new&quot; stuff) - how many other of the &quot;essential&quot; series have provided anything more than the basic greatest hits (answer...none). I bought this (triple) CD from Amazon for around the price of a normal single CD. So all in all I bought a single CD of material that I had not heard before and as a bonus got 2 CD's of selected old stuff that I can use in the car, personal stereo etc instead of carting about all the albums.<br />As far as I can see this album is well worth the money for the 3rd CD alone and as for all those reviewers accusing Bruce of &quot;cashing in&quot; well all I can say is ... if you dont want it then dont buy it (your loss).
B000025TI2|2.0|Doo do do dooo. When luv breaks down. doo do doo do. I heard so much raving about this record, but it's got no balls. All hail the Bryan Adams of the UK!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is one of the best concert dvd's I've ever seen. The performances, the song selection, the sound, the video direction and the picture quality are everything one could ask for.  Sure, there were several more of George's songs that I would have loved to have seen performed, but I'll not be greedy about it.  If you've ever enjoyed a George Harrison song then this dvd is for you. The menu alone is practically inspirational. Love it, love it, love it.
B00009TB5G|5.0|This dvd is so amazing. My brother bought it the first day it came out. The extended parts are very important. These parts  add even MORE magic to the masterpiece. The behind the scene footage is very interesting. Most dvds that have extra disks, aren't that exciting. But this, you'll never get bored of. There's even parts you'll laugh at. I gaurntee this dvd to everyone! If you like special dvds then you'll love this edition. And if you like The Lord of the Rings then you'll love it even more.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I think this isn't that great of an album. Her other three albums are way better than this and I think she should have stuck with more of a poppish move and not this HIP HOP wierd stuff. I mean the CD is okay having listened to it over six times but its an OK album and i hope on her next album she don't have any bad words and have more songs like Brave New Girl, Everytime, Shadow, Breathe On Me, and Touch of my Hand. Those were basically my favorite songs and also Me against the Music but my opinion i don't like much of that rapping stuff and Earlin Mornin with the background ladies singing shaking my *** in the earlin mornin, that really wasn't necessary. That's all for right now.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This latest offering from Britney Vanilli (has anyone ever heard her actually sing live and not just lip-sync?) is just track after track of trash.  She is clearly devoid of all morals and no longer appears interested in even pretending that she had any shread of dignity left.
0385504209|1.0|Dan Brown is to Da Vinci what Oliver Stone is to John Kennedy's assassination, i.e., a purveyor of pure fiction for the sake of self enrichment.  As for the suggestion of a reviewer to read Beauseigneur's Christ Clone Trilogy in ADDITION to Da Vinci, I say read Christ Clone INSTEAD.
B0000CDL93|5.0|The last words he heard were, \\"You can't say Dallas doesn't love you, Mr. Kennedy.\\" The sky was blue and the sun was shining as gun shots echoed in Dealey Plaza.  At that moment, all he was fated to be was done and his self-named Camelot vanished.  Immortalized in death, the man became a myth, and a mystery was given life.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's JFK -- DIRECTOR'S CUT (Warner Home Video) is a new two-disc Special Edition with an extraordinary commentary track by Stone that explores in detail the paradoxes and enigmas of Kennedy's assassination and aftermath.<br /><br />New to this edition is the superb feature-length documentary, BEYOND JFK: The Question of Conspiracy.<br /><br />If everything in this movie were fiction, it would still rank as one of the great political thrillers.  This superior piece of filmmaking that looks behind the mirror at the moment in American culture when our collective paradigm truly shifted.  Highest recommendation.
B000127LW2|5.0|Definetly the best Trek out there is Star Trek Voyager.  It had the best characters, stories, and adventures.  Season One was packed with action, betrayal, and a growing love for the nine characters.  \\"Caretaker\\" is Trek's best pilot that created a true dilemma for Janeway and her crew.  Watching two enemy crews unite is something worth watching throughout the first season.  Season One also had a lot of great sci-fi and time travel and each character had a shining moment in this short but memorable first season of Star Trek: Voyager.  The journey begins with a blast and is worth every cent to have on DVD.
B0000E1ALR|1.0|I love the five star fans here getting on the one star reviews. God forbid St. Springsteen gets criticized. The problems here are well documented but worth reviewing. Bruce use to be a quality control nut, to the point of playing his guitar while walking through empty concert halls to insure the sound will be good for everyone. Now he walks away from projects that bear his name. Yes, even a series like Essentials are subject to the approval of the artists. So where was St. Bruce when the booklet had obvious errors in lyrics and pictures? Where was St. Bruce when the tape stuck in Sandy and where in the church of Bruce was he when disc 2, of the DVD, was being authored by Mo, Larry and Curly? A good bet is that he was counting his cash. You know for a socialist who preaches government entitlement programs from cradle to grave, he sure is one heck of a capitalist. Which is fine because I'm one heck of a capitalist myself, only I'm not a hypocrite about my belief system like his highness from N.J. Let's see, in concert America is wrong, Bush is a menace and Clarence should be president. Off stage the mansion on the hill suits him just fine. Hypocrisy? YOU BET! That's what's wrong with ESSENTIALS. You 5 star people are Bruce apologists who are gullible enough to buy two discs of hits to get one disc of misses. At the end of the day he's human and some of you think he's much more.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I confess: I never really liked the first movie, the plotline was shortened, the acting never lived up to my expectations and the whole thing had a feeling of cheap and poorly written D'n'D adventure. But the second movie simply redeems the first. First of all unlike FoTR TT preserves the epic tolkien feeling that was in the novel, and the soundtrack is just awesome. Though Eliajah Wood as Frodo still bothers me a bit (by his a la Leonardo di-Caprio appearance, not by acting) I daresay its the best movie I've seen for a very long time. Sir Ian McKellen as Gandalf was great, not to mention Chris Lee as Saruman. The style is just epic (no other way to describe it) and the beginning will just left you breathless (as the batlle of Helm's Deep). The whole movie got a slight Warcraft feeling to it but it only adds to the movie. In short: if you want to see a perfect fantazy epic(and you liked the original novel), this movie is just for you.
076790592X|5.0|Everyone should read this book. You will come away a better person. The part that really got me was when Morrie said how too many people today walk around in a daze- so busy worrying about the past and the future, they don't live in the moment. This book changed my life as much as any self-help book ever has. It only takes a couple hours to read, and it's a couple hours I will never regret or forget.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Repeated listening to this record (sans rose-tinted memories) reveals a band working, playing and enjoying making music. The production is simple, clean and very friendly to the notion of a few blokes sitting in the basement playing and singing together. When you hear this, everything about the music that's not the Music just goes away. All the tired mythology, Onophobia, addictions, feuds, jealousies etc. having nothing to do with the strength of song and arrangement, evaporate. Strange, but this new record reminds me of the Grateful Dead - without the Spectorish orchestral mud, you can see these guys getting free and expressing themselves intuitively with whatever they want, the musics they love, a little country, a little blues, rockabilly. The freewheeling, music-genre-bending '60s San Francisco scene, rock-and-roll bands in cowboy hats, may have struck a few Beatles as a liberating relief compared to their usual workaholic studio sessioning. Naked's fundamentalist recording style plays up the voices most importantly: this is a singing group. Every lyric and syllable is clear and loud. The lads sing with great gusto, delivering the songs with conviction. I think this is a look at how the Beatles heard themselves as they sat around together in rehearsal and hacked out songs. That's a special treat. A couple of things on the Fly on the Wall disk are incredible: song snippets, &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; played by the Beatles, Paul's lobbying his band to hang together and work on their career, John's dissipating non-sequiturs, the stupid idea about a concert on an ocean liner, the band falling apart before your ears...But it was a band, and this record is bandy as hell, all rocking, all present, all conscious, all Beatles in every note.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|I like the album.  Maybe it will catch on more for me as I hear more singles released.  Maybe she will release different mixes as airplay singles.  The reason I say I expected more is that I don't think it matches up to her previous album.<br />My favorite track is Toxic.  I like the mix of acoustic guitar and strings in a very unconventional way/sound.  Both give the song this &quot;tripping over the music&quot; feeling which I tend to really like.  Whenever I listen to the track, I always want it to be longer.<br />I don't like the choice of the second single being Shadow, which I just heard on the radio the other day.  I think this ballad needs a lot of more developement on the part of her voice and the instrumentation in order to pull it off well.<br />Everytime is an awesome track.  Give it a good listen, as well as Touch Of My Hand.<br />I've heard a lot of talk about Breathe On Me.  I don't really care for the song.  Listening to Breathe On Me reminds me of a Kylie song, pick one.
B00000IAU3|4.0|This cd is a good effort and but almost has the smae vibe throught the cd. If you know thank you, then you basically got the jist of the rest of the cd
B0000TB03W|5.0|Whether you were at the Chicago show or not what better way to experience this concert then on the dvd. Unlike some performers Shania doesn't lip-synch she sings every note herself. The energy of the band is incredible. The costume changes. Lots of audience shots. Definitely a dvd you want to add to your growing collection.
B00005JMFI|3.0|While I found the show to be cute and somewhat entertaining, I also want to warn the families out there created by adoption, that there are some messages in this film that they should be aware of prior to viewing the film.  The basic story is about a little orphan baby who accidently gets himself into Santa's toy bag and is transported to the North Pole.  He is named Buddy and raised as an elf.  <br />The main story in the film is Buddy's search for his birthfamily.  Unfortunately, as you may guess, the film is full of references to the elf's \\"real father\\" i.e. his birth father. <br />Other minor irritations (from my perspective as an adoptive parent) include the fact that the elf's adoption was kept a \\"secret\\" from him until he was an adult; he is initally rejected by his birth father; and there is a subtle implication that one cannot be raised by a parent that is not of a child's birth culture.<br />On the positive side, Buddy the elf does find he has been enriched by his Elf family.  He doesn't seem to be mortified by his adoption (as in Country Bear) and on a few occasions he states with a bit of pride that he was adopted.  <br />The difficulty for me is that if the writers of this film had bothered to have a conversation with a few professionals in the adoption field, they could have made the movie less offensive for adoptive families.  This could have been a really fun movie even for families affected by adoption.  For example, the substitution of the loving title birthfather, rather than \\"real father\\".  Or, perhaps Buddy could have known along that he was adopted -- the scenes of an elf in Manhatten would have been just as funny.  <br />Just a cautionary note for adoptive families.
B0000TB03W|5.0|From the moment i turn on the dvd player i was in Shania Heaven. She starts off with Man I Feel Like A Woman! and your heart just skips a beat. The way Shania moves around stage and down into the crowd you know she's a woman who knows how to put on a show. No doubt in my mind once this dvd starts you will not be picking up that remote until the end of the show.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|I have the displeasure of having to listen to this awful cd at my job everyday. Britney attempts to reach a more diverse audience , and that is rather tough for an artist who isnt that diverse. With guest appearances by rappers ,&amp; techno remixes of singles, its obvious that this has-been pop star is desperate. Im assuming she wasnt counting on an audience of intelligent listeners , and more or less kids who watch TRL relligously. The production of the sound ( or beats) is good , but since she cant sing either the singles that are remotely decent are filled with corny choruses and hooks.The sad part ( which may make me seem hypocritical ) is that the dumbest songs from this albulm are in my head . Like I said earlier get this for your daughter , guys your girlfriend will dump you ( your better off giving her an apron , lol) , and your friends will sue you if you buy them this as a gift.
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania delivers moves that puts other artist to shame. For over 105 minutes she is non-stop energy and her band keeps up. The audience just beams with love of the music as well as the entertainer. From start to finish you'll be tapping your toes and dancing in your home. Definitely add this to your collection.
B0000A36J5|5.0|I've been waiting for this DVD ever since I saw it in the theaters last year.  Personally, I felt somewhat let down by the theatrical release of TTT since everything seemed so rushed and incohesive.  I figured that just like my experience with FOTR, I'd like the extended DVD version better.<br />It turns out I was right.  WHY oh WHY didn't they show this version in the theaters?  Then I wouldn't have to suffer for a year waiting for the extended version to come out.  Sure it's longer, but it also makes more sense.  I don't want to go over the additions here and give anything away, though.<br />If you bought the regular version, you're cheating yourself out of a much better extended version.
B0000TB03W|5.0|With this dvd!<BR>This dvd instantly became my favorite and i'm sure you'll feel  the same way. The sound and the look of the video are fabulous. Shania looks so incrediblely happy. If you saw the tv special you'll find by watching the dvd 6 extra songs.No way will any fan be disappointed by adding this to your collection. If you went to the chicago concert you just might see yourself as there are plenty of fans shots.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Say no to Celine, say no to Mariah. There is only one VOICE, and it's Whitney. This album proves that she is STILL the greatest female singer in the world. This album is gonna be Christmas classic because the album is just amazing! Nobody does it better than Whitney. The album highlight is 'O Come O Come Emanuel', her voice is just perfect there. 'O Holy Night', her version of this song is great and original. Her holiday songs got new life and new look. This album is really worth your attention! BUY IT!
B0000TB03W|5.0|Shania's first concert here in the U.S. in over 2 years and wow did she deliver one great show! You get to see the excitement of appoximately 50000 people. Who all look thrilled beyond description. The dynamic performance of Shania Twain will leave you breathless. There are 22 amazing songs. Each one will have you singing along. Shania has intertwined  her classic hits beautifully with her new sure to become classic songs in this cooncert.
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the Way 'Let It Be' should have sounded when it was first released. Although I am confident that if the Beatles were able to hear this CD as released, they would have nitpicks that annoyed them about it, I am also confident that this is far closer to their original conception of 'Let It Be' than we have ever heard before. Although the fillers \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It\\" are notably (and I think, thankfully) absent, as is the banter from the rooftop, I think this is a much more pure album in concept, and certainly the digital processing has cleaned it up a lot. Gone are all the traces of \\"Spectorization\\" the guys (especially Paul) hated. Although never one of my favorites \\"The Long And Winding Road\\" sounds especially better without the extras.   Standouts for me are \\"Get Back\\" (although I do kind of miss the rooftop chatter), \\"One After 909\\", which sounds wonderful: it is now so much more polished and crisp than ever before, \\"I Me Mine\\", on which George and the guitar work sound especially powerful and the title track, \\"Let It Be\\", which is, evidently, a combination of edits, featuring the George solo from the movie, which I have always preferred above all the other solos (especially the John solo on the original LP) which sounds incredibly sharp. Ringo's drum part seems more pronounced and crisp, and the whole song comes across as the melodic masterpiece that it is.   Downsides for me are \\"I've Got a Feeling,\\" which, though never a personal favorite, is particularly raw to an uncomfortable degree, especially vocally, and the bonus CD \\"Fly On The Wall,\\" which could have been a good 'alternate takes' or 'deleted tracks' CD. Instead it is really a very disjointed set of snippets of different songs some of which you have heard before, and some you probably haven't (included are some songs that would shortly become solo releases of former Beatles, notably \\"All Things Must Pass\\"). The bonus is worth listening to about one time for a historical perspective, but in myjudgment that's about it.   There are things that long time Beatles fans such as myself would change about this CD, but overall it is indispensable and deserves to be on every music lover's CD rack. Buy it today!
B0000TB03W|5.0|As always Shania knows just how to rev up the crowd. From top charting classic hits like You're Still the One and Honey I'm Home to new and sure to be classics songs UP! and In My Car Shania has everyone on there feet start to finish. If you saw the tv special you will find that the extra 6 songs on the dvd rock! Is there any other band that makes you wish you could do for a living what they do? Shania's band always amazing.
B00007KQA3|2.0|Please don't get me wrong. This movie is EXCELLENT. It does have some *ahem* changes in the story that are contrary to Orwell's version, but when you transition a novel to a movie, it just happens. There is no way around it. Period. So get over that, if its bothering you.<br />I am rather disappointed with the DVD, however. Earlier on in DVD production, this would have been a fine edition. But that was then, and this is now, and there's no reason or excuse for a DVD to be this shallow, especially with a movie like this. Im sure they will re-release it in a better version with two or three discs and all that stuff, but until then, making a DVD with a trailer for the special feature and a MONO SOUNDTRACK - MONO FOR CHRISSAKE!! Where are the edited scenes, commentaries, documentaries, and all that good stuff?? If they had no time to make it, or no access to it, they SHOULD HAVE WAITED before they released this.<br />They can do better than that. This movie deserves it, and the current version does not do the film any justice. They did the same thing with Alien 3, Clockwork Orange (although those are in for being changed), etc. There's no excuse for it these days.
B0000TB03W|5.0|105 minutes of Shania is never bad. Quick camera shots during the fast songs keeps you on your toes as a viewer. Blink and you'll miss something. If you attended the concert you may even get to see yourself on camera. If you didn't attend you'll want to see what you missed out on!
0061015725|3.0|In Michael Crichton's latest novel, Prey, the author revisits one of his oldest themes, in particular the dangers and unintended consequences of developing new technologies.  In this case, the technological development is nanotechnology and, as typical with Crichton, the effort is a mixed success.<br />The story in this case involves a company that has developed miniature robots for medical diagnostics.  Necessary to their success is a program that allows them to act as a swarm (since any individual robot is too small to perform complex tasks); this swarm eventually gets loose from the supposedly secure facility and starts multiplying and preying on the local animals.  The narrator is called in to try and rein in the nanobots, but they are evolving faster than he can come up with ways to stop them.<br />Crichton is an idea guy, and this story - like many of his novels - is dominated by the idea at the cost of other considerations such as plot or character.  In fact, most of the characters are little more than talking heads designed to represent various viewpoints (the voice of reason, the amoral entrepreneur, etc.) in the discussion of the dangers of this nanotechnology.  Despite a string of best-selling novels, the number of memorable Crichton characters can be counted easily on one hand, even if you lost a couple fingers in an accident.<br />This story is not completely original, revisiting elements from such books as Jurassic Park, The Andromeda Strain and Sphere.  In the end, however, this is standard Crichton:  fast reading and thought provoking without really being good writing.
B0000TB03W|5.0|From the scenes of Shania and her band playing along side one another to Shania going down into the crowd. You won't want to miss one single second. The picture comes in crystal clear as does the sound.  All the songs are a must to see performed especially Juanita, men will love the shimmy Shania does while singing this song. This dvd proves without a doubt Shania owns any stage she sets foot on!
B0000CDLA7|2.0|This isn't songwriting, and it isn't a group of people working together, it's the Portnoy & Petrucci Band featuring James Labrie on vocals and 2 other guys whose names they forget. Please. What can they *possibly* be angry about? They're professional musicians who make a comfortable living doing what they love, unlike probably all of the rest of us posting reviews here. I don't care about their agendas, their intentions, or anything else - I care about the music itself, period. This is an album of 6 songs played on a heavily distorted 7-string guitar with an overdose of double-kick madness. The sole music here is the shortest tune, \\"Vacant\\", which not surprisingly comes from Labrie, Myung, and Rudess, the guys who are shockingly absent in the other 6 songs (and 70+ minutes). Most of the \\"solos\\" in this recording sound like angry hornets dive-bombing my ears. Rudess and Myung, very gifted musicians, phoned in their parts; are they planning to stick around, or is this a sign of their intentions?<br />I find almost nothing of interest here. How terribly disappointing - I look to these guys for inspiration and technical motivation. But I can blur sextuplets as fast as Petrucci with as little soul or melody as he shows here, and who cares? Considering how quickly this album was constructed, I find this more an exercise in noise than song, and that bothers me. The OSI release had much more to offer, and that's supposed to be a side project for these guys! After several listens, I still don't find anything I like about this release, and I'm increasingly irritated at how little they let Myung and Labrie participate in the creation of DT's \\"songs\\". Even Rudess gets pushed to the back on ToT, and that's a musical crime. These songs have little difference among them, other than \\"As I Am\\" and \\"Vacant\\", and that's what makes this release so different than anything DT has released before. Different in a deeply disappointing way...<br />This album is a slap in the face to this fan of over 10 years. This is Speed Theater, a showcase for how loud and how fast Portnoy & Petrucci can beat on their instruments. I no longer care about their technical prowess; there's no songwriting here and nothing to hum in the shower. No soul. No heart. No dreaming. And in the end, nothing to recommend.of over 10 years.

B0000TB03W|5.0|I saw the tv special when i was watching the dvd i noticed there is footage that was  not included on tv. So that alone makes this dvd a must! Shania is an incredibly talented singer whose energy never fails to come across she'll have you tapping your toes unable to sit down the entire length of the dvd. You never waste your money when you purchase something from Shania!
B0000DJZA5|4.0|I had high hopes for this CD because this was the way the Beatles really wanted this music to sound like and because of all of the hoopla over the existence of hundreds of hours of Get Back tapes.  At a mere thirty five minutes, this is somewhat disappointing.    This is not without bright spots, particularly with the crisp sound and the delightful instrumentation, particularly in the breaks of Let It Be, Long And Winding Road, and Across The Universe.  Music buried for so long under Phil Spector's Wall Of Sound finally comes to light.  With slightly altered vocals, these are new recordings, not just remixes.    This CD actually serves to whet one's appetite for remastering and upgrading the rest of the back catalog, which was originally released at the dawn of the CD era.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I love Britney she is the best, and this cd is her best work
B0000TB05A|5.0|When I heard that this show was going to be released as a DVD, I was a little apprehensive. There was already a DVD issued from the Elevation tour and feared fans might find a home town event too parochial.<br />So many events conspired to make this show truly unique. Slane Castle has been host to Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Guns n' Roses, Thin Lizzy, Queen, Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers (this year, and whose slane DVD is due 1 week after this one) but was never headlined by U2 until 2001.<br />The first Slane show on August 25th sold out in 10 minutes, 80000 tickets in 10 minutes. The result was that a second show had to be held. This meant that planning permission had to be pushed through very quickly by the Irish government.<BR> <BR>The setting for the concert is unique and magnificent. The hill outside the castle is a natural amphitheatre. The castle itself was lit up with various colours throughout the show. Behind the castle lies the river Boyne, the setting for the 1690 battle that has left so much emotional baggage between the 2 people who share the island of Ireland.<br />The 2 other events that make this show equally jubilant and emotional is fact the Bono was in mourning over the death of his father. The funeral was the eve of the first Slane show. However, the truly magnificent event that had the crowd on a high all day was the World cup qualifier held that afternoon in Dublin. The 2nd half of the match was screened to the Slane audience.<BR> <BR>A chance of an Irish victory was slim and was further reduced when Ireland where reduced to 10 men. Imagine the ecstasy of the crowd when Jason Mc Ateer hammered home the only goal of the game to knock the mighty Dutch out of the world cup and keep Ireland on the path to the world cup.<BR> <BR>These 2 events are so apparent during a lot of the banter with the crowd. 'Kite' is dedicated to his father Bob Hewson, Bono changes the words of beautiful day to 'beautiful goal' in reference to Jason Mc Ateer's wonder goal. (He did dedicate 'One' to Jason Mc Ateer, but this was edited out for one reason or another, most obvious one being the scope of Mc Ateer's fame, the other may have been an attempt to ease the suffering of Dutch U2 fans).<BR> <BR>Other highlights include, Sunday Bloody Sunday, in which Bono recalls the names of the victims of the 1998 Omagh bombing. This is quite powerful as it helps to humanise the victims instead of making them statistics of a bloody outrage. The Boyne river in the background makes the message even more potent and relevant.<BR>Bullet the blue sky is brilliant. The introduction by Sinead O Connor is inspired. However they did leave out the Charlton Heston footage at the end of the song. The only cringe-worthy shot is Bono's Ireland flag waving moment, however considering the days events, he does go out of his way to explain its 'just once, just once for Jason Mc Ateer' and not some jingoistic retarded nationalistic jesture. 'Mysterious ways' was taken from the main track selection and placed on the DVD as a bonus track. No idea why, but its a great tune made all the better by Bono's daughter accompanying him on stage. Likewise he dedicates 'All I want is you' to his wife Ali. Bono also summons up their early days with a rendition of their first single 'Out of control'. During which he recounts the story of raising the 2000 pounds necessary to fund the band and how the band decided to stay and live in Dublin with 'the tribe'.<br />This is a truly unique, excellent and uplifting DVD that all U2 fans will enjoy and which U2 themselves will find difficult to replicate again.
B000002G8H|5.0|Clapton Is God! I mean it the man rules over Hendrix, Zappa, Page, Van Halen you name em and Clapton will knock them all down! I love Eric Clapton as a guitar player, I mean no one can touch him he is truly in the top 2 (right behind Joe Perry of cource) Slowhand was his biggest album in the 70's well as far as his solo material goes. Every song on Slowhand is a Classic I mean 'Cocaine' and 'Wonderful Tonight' are worth the price of the album alone. The solo on 'Cocaine' is just killer I mean Clapton tears it up on the track, and 'Wonderful Tonight' has amazing lyrics and the guitar is mind blowing! 'Lay Down Sally' was another Clapton classic. 'The Core' to me is probly the best track I mean its just to perfect, well the album as whole is really nearly perfect! Its a must own classic you cant call yourself a Clapton fan without it!

Twiggy Ramirez's bass is impeccable! 5/5<br />Wrapped In Plastic - Not very catchy, but good lyrics 4.75/5<br />Dogma - Creepy, but Impossible not to sing along! 5/5<br />Sweet Tooth - Nice Saxaphone And Lyrics, this has more of a \\"Sadistic\\" aproach. 4.75/5<br />Snake Eyes And Sissies - KABOOM!!! Another Hit!!! Manson & Pals really can harmonize in a sick way. 5/5<br />My Monkey - Funny, but Mediocre Lyrics. I think this was origanally based on a Charles Manson song, give or take a few lyrics. 3/5<br />Misery Machine - Good way to end the album, for some reason theres a 6-7 minute silence period at the end making this song only about 5 minutes compared to 13 mins. 4/5<br />Overall this album Kicks...!!<br />YOU SPOONFED US SATURDAY MORNING MOUTHFULS OF MAGGOTS AND LIES DISGUISED IN YOUR SUGARY BREAKFAST CEREALS.

B000002UDB|5.0|This is a truly Tripped out record! Maybe even more so then the great Srg. Pepper, and album of which I have mixed feelings about. Magical Mystery Tour has one low point and a whole bunch of high points. The low point being the title track Magical Mystery Tour, I am sorry but I truly can not stand that song I dont know exatly what it is but I think it is just a very bad song. Other then Magical Mystery Tour, ever other song is good and probly all the other songs could be concederd Beatles classics. 'Blue Jay Way' is just a really great song. And I am a firm beliver that anything Lennon or Harrison did is better then anything Paul could have ever done so on that note I belive 'Your Mother Should Know' is catching and a good pop song but I am not a big fan of it. Now on to the classic of all classic Beatles songs, 'Strawbarry Fields Forever' this is one of the top 20 songs of all time I mean it is truly original and its just a great song as only the Late great John Lennon could write. This is essential for anyone who calls them a Beatles fan! infact this is one of the best rock and roll albums of all time! I think its better then Abbey Road, but hey thats just me.
B00005B36H|4.0|When I picked this disc up, I did so with a sort of subconscience resistance. Overtly speaking, I was not exactly a Tool fan and had heard enogh God- bashing Maynard James Keenan sound bytes to frighten a small army of nuns. But, I gave fate a chance, and emerged upon the exit of this listening experience, a happier and changed man. Of course, I'm kidding. Despair breeds despair, and there are hints of such tension on the tracks. But, and let me say BUT, I actually found a sense of refreshment in Maynard's lyrics that alluded to forgivness, self-acceptance and a healthily balanced momentum toward postive change. This isn't \\"We are the world\\", but it is the least sharply offending Tool disc I have ever heard. The songs, pretty much , all roll along as mini-opus's that are sprawlingly evacotive  , but with tighly wound cohesion and formulaic warmth. The passion is here and on songs like \\"The Patient\\", \\"Schism\\"(the record's best track)and \\"The Grudge\\", the door is open to healing and transformation. These are good themes, and not exactly excpected ones from Tool's main vocalist and lyrist.The only break-out/freak-outs of fury, occur on \\"Ticks and Leeches\\" and although it weirdly sounds homosexually oriented, it isn't;instead it's about being taken advantage of, whether by thier overwhelming popularity, artistic temperment, or personal lives.The song doesn't offend, but it breaks up the running pace of thematiclly weaved issues of forgivness and communication. In closing, I can't say that this is a dark-free, happy go lucky record, but I can say that it's a nice change, not only in Tool's already evolving musical sound, but also in the lyrics; ones that actually point upward to healing instead of down to despair and continued frustration. I'm not exactly a Tool fan, but this disc is very good(although there are some filler tracks, mostly lame instrumentals) and I can rightly reccomend it. \\"The Grudge\\" and \\"Schism\\" are the record's best tracks and I personally think that\\"Schism\\" is one of the best modern rock songs of all time. As a Christian, I don't exactly find myself drawn to darkly disturbing peices of art, but this one is a rare oddity that points to hope's shining star, and it is a big crowning achievment for Tool, one of which I hope continues. <BR>Cheers!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|'In The Zone' is by far Britney's best work yet. Every song is very different. The album has a sexy vibe and great beats. My favorite tracks include: \\"The Hook Up,\\" \\"Brave New Girl,\\" \\"Everytime,\\" and \\"Early Mornin'.\\" This album is hot!
B00005QIPH|5.0|O.K. In all fairness and truth, this is a great disc. O.K. Followup opinion: they are not the best rock and roll band in the world(sorry Rolling Stone). Theses catchy and brief songs roll along at a hare's pace and excude melody, charm, style and tightly crafted musicianship coherence. But, The Strokes are mightily overpraised for inventing a sound they didn't invent, and for adhering strictly to hammering out a consistently self-styled formula that spans the entirety of this disc without changing. I can't knock it, because this is truly a very good album;great in fact. But, the Strokes sound like their just having alot of overdue fun...art is not the key here. It's not a bad thing. It's just an eletist frat party sort of thing whether you're either in on the running gag, or not, and by the gag, I mean the hipster, rocked out, NYC trendy cool of the strokes and their tunes. Buy this disc. It's great. It dosen't have alot of passionate heart into it...there are no aching or haunting tender ballads. It basically is a long running ode to rock excess, but it's worth every dime. Boys and girls, leave your wallets and your brains at the door, and get drunk on the Strokes. They don't dissapoint. They may not be rock and roll's saviors(that long running position is still filled by U2 ,thank you very much)but they are rock and roll's 2003 awnser to Television, The Stooges and even Blondie, and that's not a bad thing. That's what makes this disc such a joy to listen to. Go buy it here at Amazon and rock out to this deleriously blissful,bare bones, underproduced but charming disc. Get it.Now!<BR>Cheers!
0792151712|4.0|Directed by James Cameron, this 1997 film takes the viewer back to April of 1912 aboard the maiden voyage of the Titantic.  Known for its size, the ship was believed by many to be unsinkable.  The movie starts off with a search crew, led by \\"Brock Lovett\\" (Bill Paxton) who is exploring the remains buried at sea, particularly a 56-carat blue diamond necklace named \\"The Heart of the Ocean\\".  Upon discovery of a safe, \\"Brock\\" reveals a sketch of a young woman wearing the necklace. The picture is dated April 14, 1912.  Upon hearing of the search for the diamond on a news station, a 101- year-old lady \\"Rose Dawson Clavert\\" (Gloria Stuart) contacts \\"Brock\\" to inform him of information that may help him in his search.<br />Upon arrival to the \\"Brocks\\" vessel, \\"Rose\\" identifies herself as the woman in the sketch and beings to reveal her accounts and secrets of the voyage.  <br />This film takes us back and forth from 1912 to present day. \\"Rose's\\" story begins when she, as a young woman accompanies her wealthy obnoxious fiancé,  \\"Cal Hockley\\" (Billy Zane) and her socialite mother \\"Ruth De Witt Bukater\\" (Frances Fisher) aboard the Titantic on it's maiden voyage from Ireland to America.  <br />The death of \\"Rose's\\" father has left her family in extreme debt and her engagement to wealthy \\"Mr. Hockley\\" has been forced upon her by her mother \\"Ruth\\" to help them from losing their social status within the community. Although \\"Rose\\" has captured the love of her fiancé \\"Cal\\", she doesn't love him and longs for a life that offers her more. <br />\\"Jack Dawson\\" (Leonardo DiCapario), an aspiring young artist who has won his 3rd class ticket from a poker game is also boarding the ship unknowing that the love of his life is also boarding the same ship. <br />Having been pushed to her limits \\"Rose\\" rushes to the bow to jump over board.  \\"Jack\\" sees what is about to happen and rescues \\"Rose\\" from ending her life.  The two find an attraction to one another and steal time away to be together.  \\"Jack\\" talks about living live to it's fullest and \\"making it count\\".  The two are captivated by one another and fall madly in love. As the ship smashes into an iceberg and begins to sink, the two rush to find safety only to confirm that the ship is not equipped with enough life- boats to save everyone aboard. <br />After the ship has sunk, together they find a single piece of wood that is only big enough to hold one of them.  \\"Rose\\" climbs on the board while holding onto \\"Jack's\\" hand as he floats in the icy water. As they float waiting for the rescue team, \\"Jack\\" forces \\"Rose\\" to promise that she will fight to stay alive and to never let go.<br />This epic offers a love story and drama along with the excitement of exploration.  Costing $200 million to make, James Cameron does an outstanding job of taking us back to April 15, 1912 during the first and final voyage of the Titantic while entertaining us with a love story, that who knows, may have truly happened.
B000007T1M|3.0|First up, this is a dissapointing album. When I listened to \\"Toxicity\\", it was boldly charged up with musical variety and intense passion. This record feels slightly unsure of itself, and it shows. The stand-out cuts (\\"Sugar\\", \\"Spiders\\", and \\"P.L.U.C.K.\\") do bring an innovative fresh air to the musical table, but I found myself offended at the opeing track which talks about the \\"failing\\" of Christ. Their personal agendas drastically differ with my own, and I wasn't sure I'd proceed to track two after the blunt blasphemy of \\"Suite-Pee\\", but I did and emerged with the finished opinion that this album lacks the depth and strength of \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Steal this Album!\\". I don't listen to much hard rock, and I find plenty of insult in creativly lukewarm acts like \\"Disturbed\\" and \\"Cold\\" and all the \\"Mudvayne\\" copy-cats out there that spill their putrid venom onto impressionable teens. Kids have it hard enough enduring issues of alienation, suicide, family and social relationships. Bands of such ilk as aforementioed, are really a drag down force that sucks hope out of you like a black vortex. This record, however, DOES possess some bright spots, and in all fairness told, it is basically an anthemic cry over the mistreatment of the Armenian people and even of others in general. There's a distinct admiration in that. But, I can only reccomend this disc based on the strength of a few standout cuts(such as \\"Spiders\\" with it's rich melodic poignancy and power\\"). I certainly won't find myself listening to it again, but as a debut, it's better then most in the nu metal field and even hard rock acts in general. No brownie points though to the disc's opener. Christ seems to be an easy scapegoat for the cause of the despair and misguidance of the enraged. Try blaming satan instead. That's HIS job.<BR>Yours truly,<BR>Luke
B0000DYJM6|5.0|If you are a real Pearl Jam fan, this album is a must!  They have yet to show me that they are anything other than unbelievable.  The mix of music is ridiculously good and can be appreciated by all.  Definitley worth buying.
B00007E8V4|5.0|In some ways, this disc exceeds &quot;Toxicity&quot; in dynamic variety and styled substance. I'm a Christian, and I happened to listen to this album without much peace present. It's an anarchistic mess, but it sprawls beautifully and breathlessly. Some of the tracks, sadly, scapegoat the police(with such reiterated lines as &quot;F@#k YOU PIG!&quot;)and the &quot;american dream&quot;. But, let art have its way, I told myself, and proceeded to finish up the disc with alot of admiration for their obvious genius. As I have reviewed before, I come away after listening to System of a Down, with the fairy-tale wish that I had a magic wand to modify their lyrical and political stance. Defying and hate-mopngering the police and the governement is not my cup of tea. Protest with purpose, for instance, at the mistreatment of the Jews, or of native and african americans are all agendas we should support. But to sharply finger-point our national government and fault find our american system is actually a watered down form of treason. Politics aside, this disc rocks. I never thought a song about pepperonni pizza could actually rock the house, but it does. Musically, this album, in some ways, is better then &quot;Toxicity&quot;. I reccomend it for the musical element. But, be at your discretion for the lyrical agendas.<BR>Cheers!
B000088E6D|1.0|I listened to this cd once (thank goodness I never bought it) and know what, it just sucks.  I don't understand all the fuss surrounding this guy Michael Bublé (hey, he's quite big here in our country).  Don't get me wrong... I'm a young kid myself but I also love to listen to ballads and stuff, especially the old ones. Or the so-called &quot;retro&quot; stuff.  But this is no good... I find him to be trying too hard and it shows.  He's no different from all the other posers out there (behind his so-called &quot;classy&quot; veneer).  <br />But hopefully this will only be a blip and he could improve himself the next time around.<br />(A friendly PS:  check out &quot;A Secret History&quot; [or any album] by the Divine Comedy.  It's a gorgeous,  brilliant album, believe me!)
B000021YQV|5.0|First up, I'm a dedicated Christian, and \\"Chop Suey!\\" seemed to misquote Christ as giving up on humanity, and crumbling into self-styled pity and suicidal despair.The happy themes of Elvis and Chuck Berry, these songs ain't. Still, after some self nudging (and an extra 20$ bill in my wallet) I picked the disc up and gave it a spin. Said truth be told, IT in fact IS an excellent album, one of the supreme best of it's kind, emerging with spectacular production values, innovative musical skill, and bold, defiant songwriting, from Serj's vocal prowess, to the underpinning radical social commentary. Unfortunatly, I am not in the \\"System's \\" majority who feel that the government is a turncoat threat to the welfare of our country, or in regard, to the prospering policy of other nations. \\"Prison Song\\" is an excellent song, complete with mid-tempo changes, witty lyrics(Malakian is a toungue in cheek prodigy) and style to spare, but frankly, our governement is not the epitome of an evil empire. System rails against the system and that is some what of a turn-off, because as a proud american and Christian who stands next to Bush, I can't support lyrics that scream anarchistic defiance toward towering authority figures. A divided nation cannot stand(thank you Jesus and Washington) and their political views slightly obscure and mar my listening appreciation for the band. Anyway, politics aside, the disc is musically excellent. The only cuts that are just so-so involve \\"Bounce\\", \\"Shimmy\\" and \\"Science\\". The rest of the disc stacks up as a mammoth plethora of meaningful ferocity. So, while I can't condone the philosophy that the band has sharply imbued, I can say that this music alone is some of the best hard rock music ever written. As a Christian, I don't find myself listening to the album any more (it's long since been buried somewhere upstairs in one of my filing cabinets)because I object to the tarty sexual innuendo of the crass and musically underpolished \\"Bounce\\" and while \\"Chop Suey!\\" may be the most powerfully great song of extremes ever written, I've learned that God forsakes no one if they turn to His son. The 5 star review is given because it is a stellar musical recording. Unfortunatly, they havn't yet invented a scrambler to change the lyrics.
B000002UAR|5.0|I say this for a special reason:  &quot;Revolver&quot; comes halfway across the strains of &quot;Sergeant Pepper's...&quot; and the rest of latter-day Beatles stuff (numbers like &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; and &quot;Love You To&quot;) but at the same time leaves some of their early rock-and-roll sound.  &quot;Revolver&quot; is sort of &quot;in the middle&quot; of things, but it's the very reason why, to me at least, it's the best Beatles album ever.  That's all.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Whether you are a fan of bodyBuilding or of Arnold Schwarzenegger, this film is a must have!
0385484518|5.0|I believe that this book is a wonderful book and should be shared with everyone.  I think many can benfit from what Morrie has to teach and apply it to their own lives.  If we could have a small amount of people be more like Morrie then maybe this world would be a better place for all of us.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|THIS CD IS THE BEST EVER. IT'S SO MATURE. IT HAS AMAZING BEATS.<BR>I THINK EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT!<BR>THE SONGS ARE BEUTIFUL.<BR>BRITNEY IS THE BEST!
B000002HRE|4.0|Do you know that this album is excellent? I think yes. I like this album's songs, they are really very good, but not each of them. I know all the Metallica fans have this album. Hey ! People !, I really recomend it for you ! BUY IT ! BUY IT ! BUY IT ! Trust me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|My favorite tracks and why (in order of appereance within the album):<br />2. Paranoid Android - 2 contrasting themes, brilliantly laid out in a unique way.  After the first &quot;explosion&quot; (you'll know what I mean if you listen to it), the band delves into a beautiful chorale, with multiple voices of Thom Yorke all melding together wonderfully.  It's a prayer, a man wailing at the world.  &quot;Rain down, rain down...come on rain down, on me.&quot;  Thom Yorke's words meld into a weep of unknown syllables and unspoken words.  You almost wish Yorke's prayer never ended.<br />4. Exit Music - Soft. Soulful. Touching. Meaningful. Climactic. Brilliant.<br />5. Let Down - I ask of you one task: Listen to this song, the whole way through. Maybe you think &quot;It's a nice song&quot;.  Then, listen again, paying special heed to the third verse.  Cry when you hear two Yorke voices simultaneously beating your heart to a pulp.  Grab a tissue and realise why music is the language of angels, and humans are gifted to hear one like Thom Yorke speak it.  <br />10. No Surprises - Hauntingly beautiful theme throughout, with an astonishingly peaceful interlude.  &quot;This is, my final fit, my final bellyache.&quot;  I feel sorry for all who have yet to hear those words spoken so softly...<br />11. Lucky - An all around great song.  Depressing albeit upbeat in a sense:  &quot;It's gonna be, A glorious day.&quot;  Many have said that. None as convincingly.<br />12. The Tourist - A great concluding piece.  A sense of urgency lurks, leading perhaps the ultimate demise of our hero and indeed to the conclusion of the best album to grace our world.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|The beats are not that great and the only good songs to me are #4, #5 and #8...all the rest are just lame. Most will probably be dissapointed
