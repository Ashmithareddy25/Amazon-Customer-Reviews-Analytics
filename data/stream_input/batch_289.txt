B000068TPN|5.0|This is one of the best portrayals of the Viet Nam War I have ever seen.  They really did a great job showing what the women went through at home, and that's rarely seen in a war movie.  Mel Gibson is one of my favorite actors (not to mention he's a hottie with the bluest eyes I've ever seen), and he deserves an Academy Award for this one!  If you haven't seen it - YOU GOTTA GET THIS ONE!
B00005YXZH|3.0|I'm tired of singers who sound tired. Love the music though.
B00007E8O5|5.0|No question about it, Degradation Trip Vols.1 and 2 is the most awesome piece of art since Alice's \\"DIRT\\".  If you liked Degradation Trip, you'll love this.  Jerry's dark signature guitar and lyrics are remeniscent of Alice in Chains and it hauntingly reminds of the great Layne Staley.  The album rocks!!<BR>All fans should buy this record.  It is definetly ashame that masterpieces like this get no airplay. My favorite track is Bargain Basement Howard Hughes but they are all strong.<BR>If you are still into so called \\"GRUNGE\\" like myself, this TRIP is worth the taking.<BR>ROCK ON!!!!!!!!
B00000AFWZ|5.0|Great collection of that era , it's double worthy your money , and for the kids who expected some Green Day/Offspring stuff I'm suggesting to \\"open\\" their ears....a bit......
B00004Y6NP|2.0|I like Dire Straits with their more laid back approach due to the singing and playing by Mark Knopfler, but listening to \\"Brothers in arms\\" is in the long run a rather boring experience. This album was in a way Dire Straits big breakthrough and includes the excellent \\"Money for nothing\\", and the catchy and happy \\"Walk of life\\". But the rest hasn't the quality I'm used to when it comes to Dire Straits.<br />Skip this one, and go for their debut \\"Dire Straits\\" (1978) and the even better \\"Making movies\\" (1980)  instead.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Folks,<br />For several years, the Russian music scene has exploded with a wealth of talent. Tatu is not the best Russian group, but they are pretty good, their music is very catchy. And...if you listen to the Russian versions, they're even more hypnotic.\<br />According to people in Russia, Tatu is a kids band, a little 2nd rate, but what the heck, the songs are great, good melodies...I sing to them! My only problem is I heard them first as Russian songs, now they have been transformed into English!<br />Perhaps someday the USA will be graced by even better artists, like Alsou Safina, someone who is a serious singer and can sing extrememly well.
B000002O5L|5.0|Tom Petty's \\"Full moon fever\\" is a masterpiece. Nor before or after have he been able to release such a solid album of (in lack of better words) pop-rock. His collaboration with Jeff Lynne (ELO) turned out to be very successful, and this record is truly one of the absolute best in its genre. Most songs on \\"Full moon fever\\" goes straight to your heart and you can't resist singing, or at least humming, along. <br />Beside the instant favorites in form of  \\"Free falling\\", \\"I won't back down\\" and \\"Running down a dream\\", the album has many more songs of very high quality. Almost every tune has potential to be included on a \\"best of Tom Petty\\".
6305784116|3.0|My 2 year old daughter likes this movie and does watch it occasionally.  The story is similar to that of &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot;, but where I can watch Tramp and Lady singing and romping around over and over and over again, I find duchess and her kittens all a little too sweet.  The songs are OK, but they get annoying after a while.  There are better movies out there.
B000002KHB|5.0|Sorry, this reveiw should be for the ALBUM, not the dvd...<br />\\"Machine head\\" from 1972 shows Deep Purple at their prime, and is without competition the best album in the bands career. From the opening \\"Highway star\\" (usually a concert opener) we get a feeling of what to expect. The following \\"Maybe I'm a leo\\" and \\"Pictures of home\\" are among the best Purple songs ever. \\"Never before\\" is good but not outstanding. Then comes \\"Smoke on the water\\" (the world's most known song?) that of course doesn't need any comment, followed by a blues tune: \\"Lazy\\". The album ends with \\"Space trucking\\" - the only one below average. <br />If you only want one Deep Purple album, this is the one!
B00004W52U|5.0|If you like music that is FULL of energy and passion and really good lyrics, then buy this album. it is definetely worth your money. Operation Ivy is one of the greatest bands I have ever heard. ALL 27 songs on Energy are excellent. And the best ones are even better than excellent, they are glorious. Some of the best ones are Sound System, Unity, Bombshell, Here we go again, I Got No and lots of others. JUST BUY THE FREAKIN ALBUM!
B00003CXXM|5.0|Well, now, Matt's really intimidating, and we all can be coerced by this tough-guy image that The State Department puts across, I just have to say that the film does make some positive non-violent statements, the gun issue, when there isn't serious carnage breaking loose, the hero character chooses to avoid carrying a weapon and uses his matial arts and thinking on his feet, except when he has to take out a spoiled lime in that field with a shotgun.<br />This is all mute of course while we dwell in a time where \\"The sky is falling.\\", i.e. 9-11; and like other fictitious super heros the film industry falsely reassures us with, nothing can save Gotham, but the people who have to live there, instead of those jet set havens and hideaways.<br />I do think the bullet wounds were unrealistic, in the frogman's back, maybe he is a man of steel.  I guess its all operative conditioning at the Daisy Hill Puppy farm somewhere, sort of like \\"The Center\\" that tv's pretender Jared comes from.<br />That black budget short-shrift thing at the end was comical as well.<br />The bored identity of the all powerful and mighty Big Bother, is that, within the parameters of The Paradox of Omnipotence, it has at last found the problem of knowledge versus power.  Maybe abundant diversity of communities on earth, was a design specification modeled on the rain forrests, and we ought not go and try to pillage and plunder humanity for scumbag porkorations.  Let's hope so.<br />Then again, makeover propogandizement movie \\"The Core\\", will have us all convinced the wrath of God is to blame for the wholesale mismanagement and over militarization of the planet.
0316666343|2.0|At first i was excited to read this book having heard and read so much about it but it turned out to be disappointing particularly the character of Susie Salmon's mother, Abigail. The author never made clear her emotions and why she left her family ro drift off in some far away places only to come back when her husband had a heart attack. I thought the author made a very superficial character, weak and undeveloped. All in all this book is a big disappointmnet and it reads more like a third grade novel than a literary achievement it was hyped to be.
B00005JL78|5.0|I've seen a lot of reviews for MINORITY REPORT, both good and bad, and have come to the conclusion that those who criticized the movie may have largely missed the point. With any movie that deals with future event/time travel, there are going to be minor inconsistencies or incidents that require some suspension of belief (BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 is a case in point here).<br />I'm not going to rehash much of the plot because you can read about it here on Amazon. Let's deal with some points about MINORITY REPORT's \\"flaws\\" first:<br />1) Some reviewers have mentioned the eyeball scenes where John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is able to gain access to government buildings. One reviewer said that the eyeballs would have started decomposing by that point. However, the movie does not specify how much time elapsed since Anderton's eyes were removed; in fact, we know it can have been no more than a day, because he is \\"scheduled\\" to commit murder in 36 hours, and that's way before his eyes are removed (i.e. more time has elapsed, so there is closer to 24 hours remaining).<br />2) I agree with others that some suspension of belief is required for when Anderton re-enters the Precrime Unit so he can kidnap Agatha. In such a \\"perfect\\" system, it seems highly unlikely that the authorities wouldn't revoke his access immediately when they realize he is wanted for a future murder.<br />3) Some reviewers have said that it would be impossible to predict the future because it hasn't happened yet. This concept depends on your beliefs (possibly religious) and your view on the paranormal. There are many who believe that hindsight and consequence are closely linked and that anything one does to try to alter the future is completely missing the point. Trying to change the future implies that it CAN be changed, when in reality it is already predetermined and your actions, including trying to alter any future events, are also predetermined. I will leave that for you to make you mind up about.<br />MINORITY REPORT is arguably one of Spielberg's finest movies for a long time, probably the best since SCHINDLER'S LIST, although the two are very different genres of films. It's an action movie, but only to some extent, because the action is always supporting the fascinating plot developments (and there are many) that keep the audience guessing. The action is great and some of the special effects scene are breathtaking, particularly the first chase scene which features a sprawling suburban freeway system, complete with futuristic vehicles and roadways. <br />There are also many sinister moments, which portray a dark image of what life might be like in fifty years. One scene, where robotic spiders enter an apartment complex, is particularly sinister, with residents forced to submit to retinal scans so that the Precrime cops know that they are not the fugitive they are looking for.<br />The best moments of MINORITY REPORT are, however, not the action scenes, nor the sequences packed with special effects. It actually has some astonishing drama, with Cruise in his best form since JERRY MCGUIRE. One of the movie's climaxes (because there is more than one), where Anderton comes face to face with Leo Crow (the man he is supposedly destined to kill) for the first time, is heart-stopping stuff. Anderton has had no intention of killing Crow; after all, he doesn't even the man... but what he finds in Crow's apartment, as the clock counts down towards the moment he is meant to murder him, turns the whole movie on it's head. The question is now...will he or won't he pull the trigger?<br />The movie is worth watching just for this one sequence alone. If you liked THE MATRIX, BACK TO THE FUTURE, BLADE RUNNER (or even a lesser known made-for-TV series called MILLENNIUM [with Lance Henriksson] that aired in the 90's), you'll love MINORITY REPORT. Ignore the bad reviews and give the movie a chance. I'm the guy who foolishly walked out of the theater during THE MATRIX because I couldn't understand what was going on. When I watched it again on DVD, I loved it. Maybe those who doubt MINORITY REPORT need to sit down and watch it again. Open your minds and your wallets - you won't be disappointed.

B000069AUI|3.0|First few listens:<BR>No track instantly stood out. It was more of a feeling of 'is that it'. Seemed quite lifeless, underproduced and unplugged. Track 'clocks' was emerging after 2-3 listens.<br />A couple more listens:<BR>Tracks at the end of the CD started to kick in for me. Last two tracks are my kind of 'dwell on life' music. Noticed that lyrics were starting to break through.... some two liners were getting quite catchy. <br />The BUZZ hits:<BR>For every great Album.... there is always that defining moment... that buzz you get all of a sudden, when you know you have just experienced a great album. Its the peak of your experience and further listens are an attempt to ride it out as long as possible. Well it came after 7 listens. <BR>Track 1,2,4,5,8,10,11 become incredible<BR>Its a wonderful experience. A continous long walk on the beach in the rain. Sound familiar?. That kind of expirience can be very refreshing and cleansing. <BR>It's a great album to track with accurate intensity, word for word.... or just mellow to as background music... hum your own thoughts with the melodies.<br />Problems<BR>Simply put.... there are fillers. 3,6,7,9<BR>I have listened to the Cd 20 times now, so fillers have been filtered out by now. Its up to you I guess. Some like to call fillers songs that are 'different'. The truth is, these tracks have little merit on their own... your not gonna throw the Cd in the Juke box to hear them first. At best they are A grade fillers which are listenable if you listen to the Cd as a whole. Nevertheless.. if Im close to the controls... I can't help inevitably skipping them. <br />The formula for most of the successsful songs is the same... few lines of hangover dribble, then the higher pitched voice chorus. Followed by ooooyeeeeehh or ahhhhh or hhhhhaaaaa<br />Conclusion<BR>There are moments when ColdPLays 'Rush of blood' is like water for the thirsty.... cleansing and satisfying. But then there are fillers that make you want to go to the toilet, like you have had too much of the same...
0060523794|4.0|My first job after college was with IBM - during the boom of the S/360 computer introduction. These were glorious times with IBM. I left IBM eventually (for reasons not negative to IBM) but have always had a special fondness for the company. Even though IBM's internally focused management style ultimately got them into trouble, it spawned a workplace that treated the individual with the utmost respect which all of those who once worked for IBM could not help but appreciate.<br />This book was a simply written and accurate depiction that covered the latter years of T.J Watson Jr.'s era through to today and the viability that the entrenched 1960's IBM culture had in the 1990's. The story is a facinating one and worth reading since I believe it is a 20th century story unique unto itself.<br />For any of you who are IBM history buffs, two other books that I found very interesting fill in some of the detail around the 1970 and 1980 time period of IBM when Microsoft and Intel were taking market share. They both lay the groundwork for what Gerstner describes in his book:<BR>1. Big Blue, the Unmaking of IBM<BR>2. Hard Drive, Bill Gates and the Making of the Microsoft Empire<br />Clearly Gerstner could not have seen every turnaround action he initiated through to conclusion. Many of these will take years. But I for one wish IBM the very best in the future and thank Lou for taking on this mission.
B00005YXZH|5.0|This is a C.D. that can be played over and over again.  From start to finish there is so much going on in this album, it's simply amazing.  I've been a Wilco fan for several years now and I think the band is growing into something spectacular.  This album is a must have.
B00007BH5C|5.0|The soundtrack of the Two Towers is so amazing.  Many songs are similar to the Fellowship soundtrack and that makes it so great.  The addition of some fantastic tracks to accompany some similar tracks from the Fellowship, it makes The Two Towers remarkable.  It is a marvelous piece of work.  Howard Shore has done such a great job in bringing Tolkein's vision to life.  I get chills listening to it.  Should bring in the best soundtrack oscar from the Academy Awards.
B00005A46T|4.0|I know that its not as good as the first one but this album by slipknot called &quot;iowa&quot; still sounds pretty intense with that same rock epic sound following the deathmetal elemends and hip-hop influence... It still is slipknot ! The reason i respect these guys is simply because they have talent and Corey's lirycs are original and  twisted which i realy enjoy. Well, if you like good music buy it !
B00005221L|4.0|like the title says its good the predator(man also played chewbaca) IS PRETTY COOL lookint the predator is cool. IT is yellow and black and looks kinda old in predator years. number 2 is the movie you want to see if you dont like arnolds stupid jokes.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|I was very impressed when i heard slipknot's selftitle album  because i realy think its not only  intense but fast and heavy with a  epic rock sound with deathmetal elements and hip-hop influenced musical tunes. Slipknot's seltitle  is worth own it, so go in the store if you already haven't and go buy it now !
B00006RU5B|4.0|Well for starters this cd is breath of fresh air!! With all the ... that MTV and FM radio tries to cram down our throats, this cd just stands out. It retains musical value and its just good to hear Chris Cornells voice in some new stuff..  The guitar synth solo is nice in \\"like a stone\\". Im glad that Rage and Chris teamed up. I hope it lasts<br />Mike @ guitarpiks.com<br />Sounds really good ad 120DB....
6305609705|5.0|It is a world unlike anything that we will ever experience in our lives. It's a world of fear, hate, misunderstanding and death. It's a world without reason. It's a world of horror. This is the portrait that is painted for us by Francis Ford Coppola in his 1979 masterpiece, Apocalypse Now. Loosely based on Joseph Conrad's 1902 short story, Heart of Darkness, the legendary Coppola, director of the immensely popular Godfather trilogy, tells us the story of Vietnam that screamed to be told and mesmerized audiences in the late 1970s to the tune of $150 million, three Golden Globes and eight Academy Award nominations.<BR> Apocalypse Now is the unnerving tale of the fatefully intertwined lives of Captain Benjamin Willard (Martin Sheen) and Colonel Walter E. Kurtz (Marlon Brando). In Willard's narration at the beginning of the movie, he tells us \\"I wanted a mission, and for my sins I got one. And when it was over I'd never want another.\\" The mission in question is the quest that Willard is sent on, boating with a small crew of young sailors on a river that runs throughout the heart of the Vietnam War and into Cambodia, where Willard's assignment is to seek out the renegade American Colonel and terminate his command \\"with extreme prejudice.\\" The movie follows Willard on his journey and gives us a glimpse at the horror and the hell that stemmed from this jungle conflict thirty years ago. <BR> Coppola uses long camera shots and slow transitions between scenes throughout the better part of the movie, and they work wonders in relating to the viewer the feeling that these brave young soldiers must have had as they floated down the river on that deadly journey. The long shots create a cryptically slow and methodical pace, and they give the viewer ample opportunity to try to analyze the state of mind of both Captain Willard and Colonel Kurtz, thus making Apocalypse Now a wonderful psychological thriller in addition to being the tremendous war story that it already is.<BR> Coppola's film also benefited heavily from the genius that he showed in selecting his music and sound. In fact, Apocalypse Now won an Academy Award for Best Sound and a Golden Globe for Best Original Score. He mixed in some rock n' roll, like the Rolling Stones, to give the viewer a sense of time and place and in order to increase their adrenaline during some of the more exciting scenes (such as when Captain Willard rises from the water en route to slay Colonel Kurtz), plus he used some popular classical music (when Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore leads his flock of helicopters against the Vietnamese village), and the wonderful classical score throughout the film was reminiscent of Coppola's previous success, The Godfather.<BR> Of the eight Academy Awards that Apocalypse Now was nominated for, it won two, and one of those (Sound) has already been mentioned, but I'd be remiss not to mention the second, Best Cinematography. This award was well deserved as Apocalypse Now used many aspects of cinematography and mise-en-scene in order to create so many wonderful and thoroughly memorable scenes. One such scene was when Willard's crew arrived at the Do-Lung Bridge. Coppola showed the view from Willard's eyes, as he was ducking down in the trench and asked a soldier named Roach if he knew who was in command. You could only see the faces of Roach and Willard when the darkness was interrupted by slow, pulsing bursts of light that were created by the explosions and the flares shot into the air as Roach gave his spine-chilling reply. A second scene that I'd like to mention, that was alluded to before, was when Captain Willard rose from the river, face covered in mud and camouflage on his way to kill Colonel Kurtz. This scene was beautifully done as the camera was kept at water level to see Willard slowly rising, not unlike an alligator, to the surface in pursuit of his prey. Smog billows off the water and Sheen's character brandishes the sword with which he is going to honorably kill Colonel Kurtz, so that Kurtz can go out the way that he wanted to - as a soldier. The whole movie was filmed in this manner, and that is why it warranted its Academy Award.<BR> I really loved this movie. It kept me entranced from beginning to end, and whether or not it is an accurate description of what life was like in the Vietnam War, to me is irrelevant. For me, Apocalypse Now was nothing more than a tremendous story about one man's journey through hell, in order to relieve a tortured man's soul that has experienced more horror than anybody should ever have to endure, from his greatest burden. His life.
1577311523|5.0|This is the best book on spiritual enlightenment I have ever read!  Tolle's insights are amazing and ring true.  They make sense intellectually and \\"feel\\" true from within.  I have heard, read, and agreed with the basic principle of living in the present for years; but this is the first book that brings it all together in a way that enables the reader to begin practicing the NOW right now.  I thank authors like Deepak Chopra, James Redfield, Thomas Merton, and C.S. Lewis for preparing me to so readily embrace the teachings of Tolle.  But this book far surpasses all the others in presenting the amazing Truth of who we are and how we can realize our true lives as manifestations of God in the joyful manner intended by God.  I am on line today to buy copies for my friends.  It is the best gift they will ever receive.
B0000640S1|1.0|This DVD is a good transfer.  If you watch the ..,.\\"edited\\" version on tv you get to see the whole movie, minus a couple of graphic scenes and language.  The speical edition has missing parts (ie: An entire beginning conversation with the sherif and state Police Chief which makes things clear about what the sherif really thinks and what really happened in his jailhouse), and is no different than the regular version at a cheaper price.  This DVD doesn't deserve to be called a \\"SPECIAL EDITION\\" it has nothing different.  Don't waste your money. (Unless you don't have it at all, it's still a good movie)
B0000067L2|4.0|One of the truly classic rock albums, Disraeli Gears was the album that made superstars of Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker. Recorded in 1967, this was the group's follow-up to the blues-rock masterpiece, Fresh Cream. Disraeli Gears is far less blues-based than its predecessor and goes more towards hard rock. Although it is a great, classic album, I find it to be less solid than Fresh Cream as it contains a few weak spots which that album did not. I'll elaborate on a track-by-track analysis. <br />Strange Brew - Perfect album opener. This is a Cream classic and one of their most well-known songs. Great song and a good groove with Clapton imitating Albert King on the solo.<br />Sunshine Of Your Love - Classic, classic, classic rock song. One of the all-time great guitar riffs. Excellent solo. Absolutely perfect. <br />World Of Pain - A bit slower than most of the songs on the album, and not one of the most memorable either. Clapton's guitar, however, is the high point of this song with nice wah-wah rhythm parts and a cool solo. Great bass playing by Jack too.<br />Dance The Night Away - Another good, but not great one. One of the lesser songs on the album.<br />Blue Condition - Who's idea was it to let Ginger sing? This song really isn't bad, but Ginger Baker is known for being a drummer, not a singer. This song illustrates why. One of the low points. <br />Tales Of Brave Ulysses - Short, but sweet. Great wah-wah guitar from Clapton and weird, poetic lyrics. A real high point. <br />Swlabr - More psychedelia. A pretty hard rocking tune with an unpronounceable title (actually stands for &quot;She Walks Like A Bearded Rainbow&quot;). More weird, psychedelic lyrics from Pete Brown.<br />We're Going Wrong - The tempo slows down again on this Jack Bruce song. A very nice vocal from Jack and great drumming from Ginger, but it's kind of dull. <br />Outside Woman Blues - A great bluesy song with vocals by Clapton and a nice riff. One of my personal favorite songs onthe album. Great guitar solo.<br />Take It Back - Another blues tune sung by Jack, with some nice harmonica blowing too. I like this one a lot.<br />Mother's Lament - An interesting conclusion to the album. An English pub song sung with thick cockney accents. The only instrument is piano. It's a slight, but enjoyable addition to this fine album. <br />Overall, this a great but uneven album. I find Fresh Cream to be Cream's best overall album. Disraeli Gears, even with its flaws, is still a very strong album with more high points than low. An essential rock album and very necessary for Clapton fans.
078062369X|2.0|After watching the movie Blade, I've got to say that it, well, it bites. (Sorry, couldn't resist.) Wesley Snipes is buffed up, but with no place to go. I can't imagine a more one dimensional performance than the one he mailed in on this movie. Come to mention it, just about the entire cast seemed to sleepwalk their way through this. Stephen Dorff was the notable exception, with a solid and sinister performance. In defense of the movie, there are some very stylish camera work, such as the &quot;bloody disco&quot; scenes. Soundtrack pretty much rocks, and a nice use of Kung-Fu fight coreography and Japanese manga images help out. But still not enough to really recommend this movie as anything other than 2 hours worth of mind numbing fluff. Hey, I like sci-fi as much as the next person, probably a lot more than the next person, but this movie comes across as toothless.
B000002GJS|5.0|Hmm, where do i start. Let me just say that I don't really listen to a lot of hard rock but I love Bryan A. His music is quality over quantity. His work breathes talent and brilliance and I think alot of people can relate to his music no matter what their tastes might be. With this album, Brian Adams set a milestone for the 90's, not only being outstanding piece of work that it is but also releasing one of the greatest hard rock songs ever; \\"anything I'll do\\" which was a soundtrack for a great movie to say the least. I have tons of records in my collection but i'll tell you this; if my house was on fire and I'd have the time to grab just one cd and get out, this would be it!
B00003CXXO|3.0|Don't have any pre-conceived ideas before watching this movie.  It's not an action film.  A reviewer said the movie is sad and cold and he/She(re) hopes to never, never get into such a world.  That's part of the movies' point: In the future, Technology mixed with human emotions such as love, hate and greed will make it a bad place to live.  Kind of like the Present.  But it reminds us that there is no substitute for real life(humans and pets).  We should never even TRY to give machines emotions:It would be very dangerous. But we are already using technology dangerously: Nukes, small pox production(even in the US),Cloning, genetic enginering of food, pestisides and other unnatural substances causing cancer,diabetes,Etc.
B00005YXZH|2.0|Acutely aware of the fact that too much hype and anticipation can obscure one's judgment in either direction, I calmed myself down before giving YHF my first listen.  In spite of wanting desperately to like it, to see some glimmer of hope in modern music, to avoid being let down by yet another band who believe their wheel is the original wheel, YFH not only confirmed my suspicions of the death of pop, but raised others on the poverty of taste and discernment displayed by 'knowing' critics who ought to know better.  Further listens fared no better.    After nearly surpassing themselves on Mermaid Avenue I & II, Wilco seemed set to write their magnum opus.  YFH, however, is a batch of timid, insipid compositional cliches that would sound perfectly ordinary without the special effects that mask them.  David Gilmour once observed that Floyd's music was quite simple but well dressed and dramatized in mighty-sounding studio effects.  True enough, but what sublime simplicity that was!  Wilco, by contrast, seem to use effects to disguise simplistic and petty ideas that would otherwise be dumped in the demo bin by any self-respecting musician.  Wilco appear to believe that by throwing out a few echoes, some pre-recorded atmosphere, a synthesither squiggle here or there, YFH can be considered a fusion of folk and avant garde:  A combination of a tired imagination and a lazy attitude is more like it.    As for the rabidly favorable reviews, I can only suppose that we've moved so far from the bull's eye, from what was once innovation and tasteful craftmanship, that we can't tell a gem from a lump of coal anymore.  Perhaps that's what \\"an American classic\\" is made of these days (Rolling Stone).
0151008116|5.0|This book is deep, thought provoking, intelligent, charming, sad, imaginative, funny all rolled into one wonderful story with a spiritual tone.  Definately worth the read.  Also, when it comes to spiritual books my book club also recommends the book, I Talked To God And He Wants To Talk To You.
B000065U1N|5.0|This movie was an excellent.  Some of the review I have read said it was not good.  But I think thoes reviewers, either dont have a good choice in movies or just arnt &quot;USA made&quot; but I'm not even a ture american.  I was adopted from India but now have lived in the US for 16 years.  The movie is great.  I highly suggest you rent it, then go from there.
0062502182|1.0|Paolo Coelho's spiritual roots were very occultic - he was greatly influenced by a friendship with Aleister Crowley, a satanist who referred to himself as &quot;The Great Beast&quot; and was well known as &quot;the wickedest man in the world.&quot; Both Crowley's wives went insane and five of his mistresses committed suicide.<br />Mr Coelho later developed less damaging beliefs and continues his quest for spiritual truth in this book. He is a gifted writer with an excellent mind.<br />However, he is not a Christian and many of my Christian friends think he is.

B000059TEQ|5.0|If you like love stories, then you will love this...Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw play two college students who meet, fall in love, and marry over his fathers objections...only to find out that she is dying...Movie is very touching, without being too corny...And yes it does have a sad ending...but it's very heartfelt, not maudlin...DVD picture and sound quality is pretty decent...buy and you won't be having to say you're sorry...

B000068IEU|1.0|Let's hope this is truly the last house on the left, and that there aren't any others!  I cannot even sit still long enough to get through this tripe.  Bad acting, horrible music, and that's just in the first half hour!  The extras are downright disgusting, like we really need to see someone have their bowels fondled by some crazy sexually confused psycho-chick.  UGH! Thought that scene would never end.  PLEASE spend your hard earned cash on something a little more worthy than this trash.  Any of the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET flix come to mind...If I could, I wouldn't even give this one star...
0790729628|2.0|First off, I must admit that the first contact I had with the 'Blade Runner' universe was with the book. It is a good but short and to the point novel, in the likes of Bradbury's 'FARENHEIT 451'. <br />    The movie was more of an adaptation, but it was achieved with so much skill that when I saw the movie for the first time (I was alone, in my darkened living room), I had to watch it a second time right away. This is one of the most artisticly genuine movie ever. I have seen it again and again, but there was always something wrong: the dialogue is scarse. when I learned that the narration was cut out in the Director's cut, I started looking for the original version. It is nowhere to be found.<br />All the collector sets, special editions, and other re-editions are lacking the original version. Why it is not released, I don't know; but I'm sure a great lot of folks are waiting for this event!<br />I'll never buy a Blade Runner DVD without the original version, even if I think the 'Director's Cut' is still in my top 3 movies of all times, with 'The Big Blue' and 'Run Lola Run'.<br />My opinion: if you are already addicted, you probably are waiting like me for a re-edition. If you have yet to see the movie, buy it and you won't be disappointed.
B000000W5L|5.0|Since I'm a young dude, most of the music I have is from 1980-the present, except for aerosmith, led zepplin, the doors, and maybe a few others.  One day last year I realized I am probably missing out on a lot of great stuff, so through the magic of the internet I have been trying some old records on for size.  This has lead to some dead ends (Bob Dylan and the Beatles are not my cup of tea) and some music I can't believe I've missed out on for all of my 20 years (Velvet Underground, Stooges, Johnny Cash.)  <br />Based on the singles I had heard on the radio, I figured the Rolling Stones wouldn't resonate with me, just as the Beatles hadn't.  I avoided them until someone suggested I check out Exile on Main Street.  This goes on the \\"can't believe I'd missed out for so long\\" list.  This is soulful and gritty and real.  These are not anthemic overproduced singles you hear strung together on a boring classic rock radio station.  These are not songs a fat middle-aged guy warbles while washing his car in the summer.  These are cigarette-and-whiskey tinged slabs of rock and roll meat.  This is sex and menace and swagger.  The recordings are dusty and heavy and real.  This is undiluted rock, blues and country reflecting off the smoke stained wall of a bar at two in the morning.  Exile on Main Street is a snapshot of a world you wish you could inhabit full-time.<br />I am almost afraid to check out their other records, because I don't see how they could top this.
0066214122|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The wonderful style of writing<BR>made me think I was watching a movie rather then reading a book.<BR>I couldn't turn the pages fast enough. I had little knowledge of <BR>nanotechnology until now and found it both fascinating and scary.
B00004XONN|5.0|Read the one star reviews with this in mind: this record is god, and he doesn't reveal himself to everyone.<br />If you like Autechre, Bjork, and Sigur Ros, then you already have Kid A and just come here to read the bad reviews and laugh.<br />If you like Starsailor, Travis, and Coldplay, you will not like Kid A.  Buy it anyway and listen to it over and over.  <br />It's not a difficult record.  Everything you like is just way too easy.
B000001DTM|5.0|I love music and my tastes range from The Beatles to Talib Kweli, Flogging Molly to Bob Marley, The Cure, Guru, Nirvana and everything in between, and I declare this to be beyond doubt the single greatest album.  <br />Obviously when you think U2 ballads yout think of &quot;One&quot;, a great song, but to my suprise another track made it look mediocre, that being &quot;Acrobat&quot;.  This album is so unique from anything especially early U2, which I also like.  The music stunning and the lyrics are emotional, dark, and introspective.  Every song is quality.<br />Zoo Station- &quot;I'm ready... ready for the laughing gas/ I'm ready... ready for whats next&quot; a fitting intro to a great and unique album. 10/10<br />Even Better than the Real Thing- this is just a straight groove song, and a great one at that. 10/10<br />One- An amazing song that saved the band.  The pure emotion and lyrics that can be read many different ways make this a classic. 10/10<br />Until the End of the World- A very dark sounding song with great lyrics and rocking guitar.  I have heard it is actually about what would Judas and Jesus have to say to each other, but if you didn't know this you would probably just assume its a sinister look at the nightlife. 10/10<br />Who's Gonna Ride your Wild Horses- Good song with an emotional delivery from Bono.  Nothing spectaculer in comparison to other songs on this album. 8.5/10<br />So Cruel- Almost plays like a more somber continuation of Wild Horses. 9/10<br />The Fly- Great song, to try and point out any one thing about it wouldn't scratch the surface of its greatness. 10/10<br />Mysterious Ways-One of the great bass parts of all time, and very good guitar work as well. 9.5/10<br />Trying to Throw your Arms Around the World- Starts great ends a little weak.  Kind of slow and monotone for my taste. 8.5/10<br />Ultra Violet- A very good song, but not my favorite. 9.5/10<br />Acrobat- I could right a term paper about the pure greatness of this track.The kind of echoing low music accompany the great lyrics.  To appreciate this song you really just have to here it.  20/10<br />Love is Blindness- I very nice track to close a truely classic album with. 9.5/10
B00005JLF5|5.0|With glee I write this review for my favorite show of all time.<br />If you passed on the Deep Space phenomenon at the time, you were'nt alone. Many who had interest in TNG didn't really take to DS9 at first, myself included. I started watching it again in the second season and it slowly grab held of me. There are a few bad episodes (\\"Melora\\" for one), but overall these are the most fascinating, imaginative stories ever collected into a series of any kind. It's a saga no doubt, a soap opera of sci-fiction, but Deep Space went so much further. With great special effects and audio, the production value alone was entertaining. But the episodes were extremely dark at times too, with the greatest characters, a healthy budget and fantastic writing. This combination led \\"Kira\\" in an interview to state that she believes this will be one of the most time enduring Television shows ever created. I really agree. If your on the fence about whether to invest yourself in the series, maybe wait for the second or third season (it generally becomes a sleeker show over time). My favorite episode of all time \\"In the Pale Moonlight\\", I believe is in the fourth season. An episode where the absolute moral boundary of war is questioned and Sisko and Garek do all this crazy stuff to assure security for the federation. A Narly episode. Garek actually kills a Romulan Senator by sabotaging his craft and Sisko actually trades biogenic weapons material for information. All to draw the Romulans into the war, I was stunned. There's another episode where Garek actually kills several Star Fleet Officers on Empok Nor in reaction to a violent drug meant for Cardassians. As I said, this is a pretty dark show at times. Don't miss it, treat yourself to good, exciting, well thought out sci-fi for a change. ENJOY TREK FANS! - Thanks Paramount... it only took a decade.
B00006V9A0|4.0|It could not be more obvious how much of an income attempt this entire CD is. With the disc and Kurt Cobain's &quot;Journals&quot; out &quot;just in time for the holiday season&quot;, it doesn't take a genius to figure it out: the exploitation is insulting. While every track on the disc is extremely good and complete (as well as remastered)you begin to realize just how bland it is. With a band like Nirvana, an artistic purging of the most unique kind, you'd expect a couple of non-singles on there. Really good songs that weren't radio-friendly but truly represented what the band was about in full context. Instead, you have a bevy of all of the hits, which obviously is to be expected of the average band. But the original idea (that probably would have happened had Courtney Love not gone into a seizure over it) was a boxset full of rareties and material true to the band. It would have marked the 10th Anniversary of the release of &quot;Nevermind&quot; and it most likely would have been awesome. This album takes it's place, and with the exception of &quot;You Know You're Right&quot; (the overly-hyped though still really good &quot;last Nirvana song&quot;) it pales in comparison to what could have been. Forgive me. I'm somewhat selfish. I'm obviously grateful, yet somewhat let down.
0393307050|4.0|I must admit that I found Patrick O'Brian's style a little different from most of the other authors I have been reading  recently. Not bad--just different. Conversations and manners of speech were alot different in the time in which these novels are cast than today. A big jump from W.E.B. Griffin to O'Brian!<br />After three books by the author I have finally gotten into a real reading groove and am beginning to enjoy this series immensely! This particular volume is an imperetive &quot;first read&quot; in order to really comprehend the flow of the series. In this volume recently promoted commander Jack Aubrey chances to meet Dr. Stephen Maturin at a concert and somehow manages to strike up a friendship with the somewhat eccentric physician. In fact Aubrey manages to convince Maturin to sign on board his new command ,Sophie , as the ship's surgeon.<br />Dr. Stephen Maturin is a true &quot;lubber&quot; as far as we are able to tell , and he is instructed in the sails of the ship by the bosun's mate in a manner that makes clear some of the nautical terminology later in the book. We are also introduced to the natural scientist Maturin--a role that develops in later books.<br />After running around the the Med chasing prizes and engaging in several nasty battles , the Sophie is captured and ultimately destroyed.<br />Any more detail than this would ruin the book for the reader!<BR>At any rate , I'm hooked now and will read the rest of the series. I'm already on book 7. Recommended for all age groups--something I can't say 'bout much modern literature. Only 4 stars since it is primarily a setup novel for a series. It does get better in the later books.
0783230702|4.0|This movie kept me thinking. It is set in both the near future and the present. Brad Pitt does an excellent job of acting. I definitely thought he was crazy. There are points in this movie that are very strange. But in the end when you look back on it as a whole, it is all good. If you like strange movies that don't make sense until the last scene, then this is your type of movie. It does just that. You can guess throughout the movie and frequently change your mind and you will still be surprised in the end. I like it that way. I gave this movie four out of five stars.
B000085RTZ|5.0|Hot off the heels of the incredible \\"Karma\\" I wondered how Kamelot could ever top such a great album. \\"Karma\\" had set a new standard for Metal and the band has forged a special and unique sound that other metal bands aspire to. Well not only have they topped Karma, but with \\"Epica\\" Kamelot has created a classic! A concept album that may be the album of the year and possibly spawn a new sub genre for Metal. The story is inspired by Goethe's \\"Faust\\". On \\"Epica\\" the main character \\"Ariel\\" represents all of man's curiosity of the world. The story touches on life, death, religion, decadence, love and other classical themes. The fantastic opener \\"Center of the Universe\\" kicks off a voyage of the senses. And the journey begins! Listening to Epica is like listening to movie. Kamelot somehow paints a screen in your mind with the intricate yet melodic music and fantastic vocals. Prominent of the album is the grander and space that Kamelot and producers Sascha Paeth and Miro has somehow spun. Producer/keyboardist Miro once again adds magic touches to the album with the most fantastic and original orchestrations I have heard in the genre. The team of Khan/Youngblood have set a standard in songwriting that will be hard to top. Every song has its place on \\"Epica, every song has flawless arrangements and memorable chorus'. Sanctuary/ Noise Records plans a Limited Edition of \\"Epica\\". They won't last long having that Kamelot has continued their Legacy with a true masterpiece of Metal! \\"Epica\\"!
0780622553|5.0|This movie is one of the most under-rated films I have seen in awhile. I saw this for the first time in Film Club last semester. I own it now. This film bursts with creativity. To me, it seems that Star Wars had set the standard for space ships (i.e. they look like boats, planes, things we drive). The space ship in this film is nothing that I've ever thought of before. I will not spoil it, you will see. You have to see. This film is not one to be missed. Look up the reviews from the critics from when it was released. Roger Ebert for one praised this movie. That should be credibility enough. If not, my input is 5 out of 5 stars.

B000068IEU|3.0|This classic Wes Craven film is a very disturbing nightmare about three sickies who kidnap, torture and kill two girls and then get killed by the parents of one of the girls.

B00005LQ04|3.0|I've been hearing about Suspiria for years; I had seen it once, ages ago, on Cable, and didn't really think much of it. I dedided to buy this 3-disc set on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon, and the past quality of Anchor Bay's DVD line.<br />  The package itself is gorgeous; The set includes a great booklet with a ton of information about the film, and a packet of 8 lobby card reproductions. Disc one is a restored, uncut version of Suspiria, and it looks absolutely stunning. The colors are crisp and vibrant, and the sound is spectacular. The story, however, is lacking. In fact, it's virtually non-existent.<BR>The plot is reminiscent of a fairy-tale: An American student arrives at a German Ballet school, and strange murders ensue. That's pretty much it. The murders are gruesome, and the ending is intriguing, if somewhat abrupt. My overall feeling about the film was that the over-stylization was there to cover the total lack of coherent plot. There's a lot to look at, but in the end, what's the point? Disc one also includes Radio & TV spots, American & International trailers, Poster, Print Ad, and stills gallery, and a video of the Suspiria theme by Daemonia, which is REALLY gay. (I don't mean homosexual; I mean gay, like seeing guys in their 40's and 50's dressed up like goths...freaky stuff.) There's also a hidden outtake of the Udo Kier interview, which is pretty funny.<br />  Disc 2 is the mostly sub-titled 25th Anniversary documentary, which has interviews with Director Dario Argento, Star Jessica Harper, and others. Some interesting stuff, but not nearly enough for 52 minutes. I didn't find any Easter Eggs on this Disc.<br />  Disc 3 is the Suspiria score on CD; Their music is very unusual, and fits the movie well. It's a nice extra; The main theme has been stuck in my head for days. Unfortunately, there isn't a track listing, so I have no idea what the song titles are.<br />  I don't feel cheated by Suspiria; The package and extras are so attractive that you more than get your money's worth. I just would have liked some steak to go with the sizzle....

B00006AL1G|5.0|I will get to the point. This film is for anyone who likes music. This film is for anyone who enjoys film. Rent this film from the video rental. Buy it from a store and pass it on, once you're done watching. Tell your public library to add it to the collection because everybody should see this film.
B00006EXL5|4.0|While oftentimes bands like this one are immediately pigeonholed into a specific genre and left there to rot for all eternity, I think My Chemical Romance is deserving of a closer look.  Their album is an album of polar opposites: slightly schizophrenic in feel, pulling punches of both extreme joy and deep sorrow and regret almost simultaneously.  While a couple of the songs have sugary overtones (\\"Drowning Lessons,\\"  \\"Early Sunsets Over Monroeville\\") that might lead you to believe upon first listen that they are simple pop-emo songs, upon subsequent listens you'll find added depth in the rushing guitar lines, the emotive qualities of the singer's voice, and the sardonic lyrical content.    My Chemical Romance seems to be an anomaly in the emo/hardcore/indie world in that their music reflects both an airy lightness as well as a troubled darkness, but in the end somehow manages to strike a near-perfect balance between the two, creating an album that will immediately catch your ear but is deep enough that you'll come back to listen again and again.  I highly recommend both this release as well as their frenetic live show and hope for nothing but the best for this band in the future.  Enjoy this release!    Favorite Tracks: \\"Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough For the Two Of Us,\\" \\"Vampires Will Never Hurt You,\\" \\"Our Lady Of Sorrows,\\" \\"Demolition Lovers.\\"

1573228214|5.0|Let's not mince words. This novel speaks for itself, so I will spare the plot summary, and simply say that this is a fast read with much to consider and delight in. You will be there, right in the story, smiling and laughing. And for your efforts you will be treated to a wonderful ending which avoids any trace of sap. This is no small achievements, and I tip my hat to Nick Hornby. Thank you, sir.
B000075BFK|5.0|This album couldn't have been better, it's real and it's how he feels within his heart. I love Tupac so much ,and what makes me care so much about him is the way he carries himself. He doesn't live his life for anyone else, he just says what he has to say when it needs to be said. His album, in so many ways are just like his life. He speaks from his heart and some people can't understand that. I love and miss him so much, I would buy his album as many times as it needs to be bought to make it #1 on the charts, But thats something that I won't have to do because he has way to much support to not make #1. He will be forever missed and respected in the eyes of his family &amp; fans. (BIGGEST FAN)
B000005RT8|1.0|I bought this album the day it came out in the U.S. with high hopes after loving &quot;Back To The Egg&quot;.  Boy oh boy, what a piece of garbage.  Thank God &quot;Coming Up&quot; was thrown in as a bonus single with the album, or I'd flung this like a frisbee.  Speaking of &quot;Coming Up&quot;, the LIVE version, it is probably one of my all time favorite McCartney/Wings songs - but who played on that with him?  Wings?  Dunno.  But man, I was at the peak of my Beatle fan-dom when this came out, I don't believe I ever bought another McCartney CD again until &quot;All The Best&quot; came out, and now &quot;Back In The US&quot;, which are great.
B00006M183|5.0|To begin, this is not Pearl Jam's greatest album.  It wouldn't be appropriate to place it on the same level as \\"Ten,\\" \\"Vs.\\" or \\"No Code\\", three albums that, taken individually, should have come around once in a great band's lifetime.  But this isn't meant to detract whatsoever from the power and beauty of \\"Riot Act.\\"  It's simply to give respect where it's due, and it certainly is in the case of those three works.<br />Now, while \\"Riot Act\\" may not be PJ's greatest album, I would be hard-pressed to convince myself or anyone else of a Pearl Jam album that is, from beginning to end, more pleasurable to experience.  From the opening drumming of \\"Can't Keep\\" to the mournful fading out of \\"All or None,\\" this album keeps the listener captivated.  Every song sounds fresh and full of life, despite the fact that Ed's singing is somewhat more reserved than on previous albums.  This fullness of life is also ironic, since \\"Riot Act\\" deals with the topic of death more than any other PJ release.  Also attributing to the pleasure of \\"Riot Act\\" is the variation of style throughout, owing much to the wider creative input supplied by those members of the band who don't go by the name Eddie.  Matt Cameron's contributions, in particular, lend a real vibrancy to the record.<br />I must have listened to \\"Riot Act\\" five times through the first night I bought it.  And since then, it's been the most played of all my music.  I can't say that any one song off the album ranks among Pearl Jam's best, but there are some beautiful pieces.  \\"Can't Keep\\" is an amazing opening track--it really sets the tone for the album.  I loved another reviewer's comparison of it to \\"Sometimes,\\" one of the most underrated of PJ's songs.  \\"Save You\\" was one of the songs that I really enjoyed from the first time I heard it.  \\"Love Boat Captain\\" is just a beautiful song, from every angle.  It reminds me of \\"Better Man\\", with its degrees of building and its heavenly use of the organ.  The first single from the album,\\"I Am Mine,\\" is one of those songs that, after hearing it for the first time, you're certain that you've heard it before.  It's as if the melody always existed somewhere in your mind, but it was just made known to you through that song.<br />Thinking over the album now, I find myself wanting to go into the way that each song moves me in its own fashion, but that's really something you have to experience for yourself.  While not the band's masterwork, \\"Riot Act\\" has managed to be the most enjoyable listening experience of any of Pearl Jam's offerings.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the finest collection ever conceived for DVD.  I just got it for Christmas and Ive watched it several times.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  Its worth every penny!!  Although it focuses on Easy company, it is an extraordinary tribute to all Americans, and fellow allies, who fought so bravely during WWII.  <br />There are so many great things about the episodes/collection it is difficult to highlight the most compelling aspect.  I am a very visual person (I dont know very much about filmmaking and cinematography) and the episodes look breathtaking.  The sets, costumes, action, everything is perfect.  I wonder how much the series cost HBO???<br />Anywayone of my favorite parts is when the actual men from Easy Company give a brief synopsis of the upcoming episode; so poignant and emotional.  Its truly amazing how anyone can live through such a horrific experience, go on, and have some degree of normalcy in their lives.<br />Thank you Easy Company, all of those who fought in the US Armed Forces, and our fellow allies, who rid the world of such utter evil.
0767849493|2.0|What an achievement, for Mr. Smith to recruit a dozen or so top celebrities to recite bits and pieces of his personal religious beliefs to a captive audience.  Truly unbelievable.  My guess is that most religious and non-religious viewers will find something to their distaste in this film (the appearance of the \\"fecal Golgothan\\" was particularly unpleasant to sit through).  In addition to the unconvincing and gruesome special effects (Ben Affleck's head gets blown off!), Mr. Smith's eclectic philosophy is not terribly original, taking bits of Catholic mythology and peppering them with obscure Fundamentalist rants (i.e., the Virgin Mary has other children by Joseph, the \\"morning star\\" of Isaiah is a reference to Satan).  Meanwhile, the bloodier side of Christianity is laid bare as we hear that Damon and Affleck's characters have been on earth \\"since the time of the plagues\\", and watch these two angels \\"smite\\" a boardroom full of entertainment execs who operate a company named after the \\"golden calf\\".<br />Go out and watch \\"Clerks\\" and forget about this nonsense from an amateur theologian.  Smith is a better authority on \\"snowballing\\" than on transubstantiation.  Stick with what you know....
0316666343|4.0|I really enjoyed the main character's point of view and perspective. Wonderful! Rare is a book that makes me want to read it again, and this one is a keeper! Better yet, pass it on to a friend when you're finished.<br />They'll thank you, like I'm thanking my Mom for lending this to me.<br />Thanks mom!
B00005YW4H|4.0|No surprise here that Norah Jones Come Away With Me is nominated for eight Grammys, including Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Jones unique vocal talents resonate throughout the entire album.<BR> Norahs piano talents are evident in Dont Know Why, the best song on the record. <BR> To pull off a remake, an artist must top the original piece. Jones triumphantly accomplishes this with the jazzy remake of country legend Hank Williams Cold Cold Heart.<BR> For all of you ladies (and men I guess) out there:  fix a nice bubble bath, pick a nice book and try popping in The Long Day is Over after the stresses of A LONG DAY. I suppose it could be very relaxing. (Not that I would try it.) <BR> The Nearness of You, part of the soundtrack to Two Weeks Notice, a romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, is also a nice addition to the album.<BR> One cant go wrong with Come Away With Me, perhaps the most popular hit from the record.<BR> Very good album!!!
6303471730|5.0|In this film the 56-year-old Wayne sensibly steps back from &quot;action-hero&quot; roles and plays a man of his real age, whose romantic focus is a woman old enough to actually *be* his wife (he and O'Hara had previously teamed in &quot;Rio Grande&quot; and &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;).  G. W. (for George Washington) McLintock is a wealthy New Mexico cattle baron who has watched the West won (and played a big part in that winning), and now, sinking into comfortable middle age, he suddenly finds his life disrupted by the return of his estranged wife Kate (whose reasons for leaving him he has never really known), their daughter Rebecca's completion of her schooling (Kate's chief purpose in coming back to the Territory at all is to convince him to allow the girl to return East with her and spend her time in a round of New York, Europe, and &quot;Newport in the season&quot;), the machinations of pompous Territorial Governor Cuthbert Humphreys, and the attraction of his new hand, Dev Warren (Wayne's son Patrick), for Becky.  He must also find a way to help his old enemies, the Comanche chiefs recently released from prison, bring their people's plight to the attention of Washington (Humphreys would rather keep it at home), and cope with an influx of homesteaders hoping to farm a nearby mesa which, he maintains, &quot;God made...for buffalo!&quot;  These complex story threads play out with wondrous clarity, helped along by a sterling cast, among the best of whom are Jack Kruschen as McLintock's longtime friend and chess partner, storekeeper Jake Birnbaum; the delightful Chill Wills as his majordomo and equally longtime right-hand man Drago; Edgar Buchanan as local derelict Bunny Dull; Michael Pate as Chief Puma; Chuck Roberson as the somewhat put-upon Sheriff Jeff Lord (who has eyes for Dev's widowed mother); Bruce Cabot (a long-time member of Wayne's &quot;stock company&quot;) as neighboring rancher Ben Sage, and Edward Faulkner (another) as his son; and Leo Gordon as homesteader Jones.  There's a wild slapstick brawl in a clay pit that follows upon McLintock's attempt to prevent the lynching of an Indian, and a comic chase through the holiday crowds as G. W. and Kate finally play out their quarrel.  Wayne had a definite gift for comedy, though he used it seldom; in this film it gets full play as he creates a sort of straight man to all the craziness going on around him.  A delightful comic Western that should be enjoyed by all ages.
B0000028M7|5.0|I'd like to start out with saying that when I first got this Cd, I was in shock of how good Alice in Chains was. It's not that I wasn't a big Chains fan before, it's just that I'd never heard one of their produced albums, and let me tell you, this album is the best of all. I mean, facelift was hardcore, Jar of Flies was a little softer, but still enjoyable all around, and the self-titled album was great to, but this was just brilliant altogether. I've never heard anything with such power and energy. If you're interested in Alice and Chains, and you want to hear more, but you don't have this album, I suggest you get some cash together and BUY IT!!!
6300268470|4.0|Director Hawks and star Wayne liked this film so much that they teamed up to remake it twice ([[ASIN:B00008CMR6 Rio Lobo]], which wasn't as good, and [[ASIN:6305754969 El Dorado]], which was better).  Wayne plays John T. Chance, a former gunfighter who has settled down as sheriff of a dusty little Texas cowtown.  Haunting the bars and back alleys of the town is his former deputy, Dude (Martin), who has turned to whiskey after being cruelly jilted by a woman.  When Joe Burdette (Akins), the bullying, gunslinging brother of the area's biggest cattle baron, coldbloodedly kills a man for trying to interfere with his baiting of the hapless Dude, Chance arrests him (with an unexpected assist from his old partner) and settles in for trouble.  Dude, for reasons unclear, decides to help, and much of the story turns on his self-doubts and his efforts to pull himself up out of the slough where he's spent the last couple of years, supported but never babied by Chance and his jailor, Stumpy (Brennan).  Joining them when they fort up in the jail to await the U.S. Marshal is Colorado Ryan (Nelson surprisingly effective in the male-ingenue role), a young gunfighter working security for Chance's old friend, freighter Pat Wheeler (Bond), who comes aboard after Wheeler is shot in the back, on orders of Nathan Burdette (Russell), for attempting to drum up support for Chance among the townsfolk.  Angie Dickinson makes her film debut as the otherwise-nameless \\"Feathers,\\" a gambler's widow who comes into town on the stage and stays on (much to Chance's dismay) to give him whatever help she can--and indeed plays a pivotal role in one confrontation.  The bad guys are one-dimensionally evil, with hardly a redeeming feature among them, and the relationship between Chance and Feathers echoes the \\"romances\\" so often found in Wayne's later oeuvre, but the buddyship of the four leads, Dude's gritty resolve to redeem himself, and the climactic set-piece shootout make up for them.

0792106989|4.0|Most people think &#34;Western&#34; and think &#34;shoot-'em-up&#34; or sweeping full-color panoramic views.  This movie has neither (it was shot, as were many of Ford's classics, in black and white).  Early in the 20th Century, Senator Ranse Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles), after 30-odd years spent chiefly in London, Washington, and the state capitol, return to Shinbone, a town somewhere &#34;south of the Picketwire&#34; (probably southern Colorado), in a region dominated by homesteaders and small ranchers rather than big, powerful cattlemen.  They've come to attend the funeral of an old friend, Tom Doniphan (John Wayne), who long ago was very important to both of them.  Pressured into an interview by local editor Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young), Ranse tells the story of their relationship.  When he first came to Shinbone, long before the railroad, his coach was held up by gunman Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin) and his two followers, Floyd (Strother Martin) and Reese (Lee Van Cleef), and he was beaten and left for dead.  Doniphan, a local horse rancher and trader on his way home from a buying trip, found him and took him to the cafe owned by Peter (John Qualen) and Nora (Jeanette Nolan) Ericsson, where they and Hallie, their then-waitress, took him in, cared for him, and gave him a job washing dishes &#34;until you can get on your feet.&#34;  Being a lawyer, Ranse was determined to bring Valance to justice, but Doniphan advised him to get a gun instead and settle the matter personally.  He also came to Ranse's defense when Liberty and his partners came into the cafe and began baiting the tenderfoot, hoping to goad him into a fight he couldn't win and thus dispose of the chief witness against them.  Dutton Peabody (Edmond O'Brien), then editor of the local paper, let Ranse hang out a shingle at his office, but Ranse spent more time chasing down news stories, lining up subscribers, and running an impromptu school for both adults and children, including Hallie, Nora, Doniphan's black right-hand man Pompey (Woody Strode), and Julieta (Jacqueline Malouf), the very bright and articulate half-Mexican older daughter of ineffective Town Marshal Link Appleyard (Andy Devine).  At last he and Peabody were selected to attend the statehood convention in the capitol.  Liberty, a tool of the big cattle interests, ambushed Peabody in his office and beat him badly, and finally Ranse knew he had to fight.  Against all reason, he apparently killed the gunman; not till he got to the capitol did he realize that Doniphan had actually fired the fatal bullet (&#34;Cold-blooded murder.  But I can live with it.&#34;).  Doniphan, who had been courting Hallie, had realized even before Ranse did that she was in love with the tenderfoot, and her happiness mattered more to him than his own.  So Ranse accepted ownership of his title as &#34;the man who shot Liberty Valance,&#34; and on the strength of that went on to a successful political career.  &#34;This is the West,&#34; says Scott.  &#34;When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.&#34;  And that, in a very real sense, is what Ford has done here, even more than in any of his other Westerns, because in fact &#34;big cattlemen&#34; very seldom had to resort to hiring gunmen to move homesteaders off--only about 10% of original entrymen lasted long enough (thanks to weather and undercapitalization) to prove up, and in times of drought, grasshoppers, and so on the figure was even less.  Nor did they necessarily resist statehood, since they already had money and power, those two indispensable routes to political influence in the Gilded Age.  Yet the movie's picture of the understated conflict between old ways and new is almost heartbreaking, and succeeds in making you wish, on one level, that the New hadn't won.  Withal it's not without its comic moments, particularly Shug Fisher as stuttering cowboy Kaintuck, whose appearances on screen are well worth watching for.  Love interest Miles, though she generally keeps to the background, provides the key to the whole film by being the focus of both Wayne's and Stewart's dreams.  And Marvin as the title villain is absolutely splendid--this has to be one of his best roles ever.  The pace may be too slow for younger audiences, but older Baby Boomers nostalgic for a genre they cut their teeth on will enjoy it.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Like many of Miyazaki's previous films, Spirited Away (Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi), is an artistic masterpiece. Though released in the U.S. by Disney, Spirited Away follows in a long line of wonderfully original storylines along with the unique animation distinguished with other Studio Ghibli films. The storyline is so very original and was very well put together. There's nothing like it. And the animation was flawless. The movie takes you on an adventure that you've never experienced. The emotions of what the main character, Chihiro, feels fuel your own emotions. I cried when she cried, I happy when she was happy. Chihiro seems so much like a real girl, what with the way she acts. The movie also included real life elements. To fully understand the meanings expressed in the movie, you've just got to watch it. Remember the phrase \\"there are no words that can express....?\\" This is it folks. Following the tradition of many of Miyazaki's other films, the theme music for the movie is beautifully orchestrated. I also recommend watching it in its original Japanese content. There's just something special about the original thing. Other movies by Miyazaki that I recommend you watch would include Totoro and Mononoke Hime. For those of you who have already seen Totoro, you'll be delighted to see the return of those cute dust balls ^_^
B000006TSC|4.0|When I first heard Breathless, I must say,I was disappointed.<BR>I was worried that after producing masterpieces such as MoonMadness, Mirage and Snow Goose along with their underrated self titled first, that Camel were truly moving in the jazzy popish direction, the clear influence of the great and sadly departed Pete Bardens,a period that spanned over three records (Breathless, Rain Dances and I Can See Your House..)<BR>However some consider Breathless, to be Camel's transitional period between Bardens influence and Latimer's symphonic direction, and indeed it was obvious that the harmony and musical partnership between the two maestros that made earlier records such classics, was not there anymore.<BR>This was so true, for Bardens left the band to pursue a new agey-jazzy/New Age solo career, while Latimer continued with Camel and returned to the band's original musical vision with Nude, one of their best albums.<BR>Yet why would I give Breathless four points?? well there are two tracks that are absolute classic progressive rock. Echoes, which is complex, melodic and typical Camel sound, and Summer Lightening, which although is jazzy, it has one of the best Latimer guitar solos ever..long, emotive and very melodic.<BR>So as a Camel fan, you should have this album in your collection, if only for these excellent tracks,and as a tribute to a very talented band that is responsible since the early 70s for producing ageless melodies for the heart, mind and soul.
0066214122|4.0|Creighton's, \\"Prey,\\" is an intriguing and suspenseful novel with a technological edge that will keep you riveted throughout the book.  The storyline is represented by nanotechnology (micro-robots) with a shrewd adeptness to form anthropomorphically in subterfuge and to exploit its code-enhanced erudition through artificial-distributed intelligence.<br />The main characters are developed entirely with a rich plot surrounded by a scientific experiment that goes awry.  \\"Prey\\" is a great title for this book, as the nanotechnology gains life through its `realistic' experiences as a hunter and hunted.<br />I would recommend this book.  It is an easy-to-read, captivating, and mind-provoking novel.
B000055Y0X|3.0|Please don't get me wrong...Dr. Strangelove is an incredible satire that humorously illustrates how governments behave like children. Though this DVD is an improvement over VHS in regard to picture quality, it pales to several other black and white movie transfers...especially Sunset Boulevard, All About Eve and Citizen Kane. It reminds of a dusty print at a movie theatre.<br />On an upper note, there are some interesting extras about Kubrick that are worth seeing. <br />I might hold out for a restored copy...but if you gotta have it, you gotta have it.
0805047905|4.0|This cute, simple book really sticks with you!  It's repetative words, \\"brown bear, brown bear what do you see?\\" really hold the kids attention.  Its simple pictures and simple words are prefect for little ones.  It is also a great way to learn animals and colors but much cuter than one of the many color-oriented books out there.  I also love that it is a board book so it doesn't get so beat up.  I adore this book but a neighbor came over, read it to the kdis, and then said...\\"What is this?  I could write this and draw those pictures!\\"  Maybe so, but he didn't.
0440237688|5.0|The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a much different society than our own.  When Jonas come of age, he is trained for what he is going to do for the rest of his life. While other young men are being trained how to be doctors or scientists, Jonas is being trained to be the next Giver. The Giver is a person who holds all the memories of \\"the old ways\\" such as color, snow and twin babies.  When Jonas sees how life used to be, he tries to escape to life in a more democrative society.<BR>  I felt this was an outstanding book.  I thought the plot was very suspenseful and it is so well written that you would never have guessed how it turns out to be. It also had a profound effect on me becuase it made me see the point of view of another society and what it is like to live in another than my own.<BR>   Please Enjoy!!
0345403959|5.0|For anyone who has fallen as deeply in love with the Belgariad and the Mallorean as I have will truly cherish and enjoy this book. Told from the straight from the heart of the centuries-old, wise, witty, overdramatic and altogether lovable sorcerer Belgarath, the Old Wolf, this novel is a captivating and entertaining novel that expands on the beginnings of Eddings' world. Throughout the book we are introduced to the first people, and the first gods that roamed at the beginning of time, and the marvelous events and prophecy that lead up to the stories of the Belgariad and Mallorean. We finally are given a history of Belgarath's remarkable beginnings, from the small vilage of Gara, to his first encounter with Aldur and the other disciples, to the Breaking of the World, and onwards, following his footsteps in all the adventures and exploits that he experienced even before Garion was born. We finally are able to appreciate and realize the depth and intellect of the often shabby Old Wolf through his experiences and dialogues, and are able to hop right into his shoes and personally get to know the other characters whose presence is pivotal in directing the flow of time. Eddings ties together many loose ends and allows us to understand the many facets of Belgarath's life, from being the shabby old story teller to being the most powerful sorcerer in the world, able to instil awe and fear in so many ('Grat is not nice!). This book lacks nothing and is rich in depth, articulate and descriptive writing, and is peppered with the classic dry humour and penetrating wit that Eddings has mastered, and will keep you enthralled and laughing for ages.
0440416027|5.0|I think this book is a wonderful book for all ages.  This is definitley a must read book, and whoever reads this book will not regret it. I can't imagaine who will not like this book.  So if you're not sure if you want to buy it or not take my word for it and buy it.
0151008116|4.0|At the beginning of the novel, Yann Martel outlined his objective for the story: he wants to give us a story that will make us believe in God. And in a way he did.<br />After introducing us to the very early years of Pi Patel, his childhood, how he got his name, his background with animals, Pi was then shipwrecked at sea during the journey from India to Canada. With a zebra, hyena, orangutan, and a 450 pound tiger named Richard Parker as his companions, Pi knew what he must do to survive in a cramp lifeboat alongside these wild animals. From here on, Martel gave us a harrowing tale of survival at sea, rich in details and fantasy. Plotwise, there isn't much; it's just Pi and Richard Parker inventing new ways to survive at sea. However everything does get illuminated at the end when Pi gave another version of his survival story, a story without the animals. Which story is more believable? Which is more interesting? If a story can't be proven based on scientific facts, why not go with the more interesting story even if it sounded more fantastical? This is Martel's premise of convincing us to believe in God: If the existence or nonexistence of God can't be proven based on facts, wouldn't it be more interesting and beneficial for us to believe that there is a god?<br />The ending of the novel will make you think, and Martel accomplished a great deal with this novel.
B000001ESJ|4.0|This follow-up to the classic 2112 has a couple of Rush's greatest moments on it, and just a handful of cringe-worthy moments too.  I am a huge Rush fan, and I still listen to this album A LOT, but I have to admit it isn't my favorite.<br />FAREWELL TO KINGS  The solid opener for the album kicks off with an extended acoustic guitar lead-in which is quite nice.  When all three band members kick in, the song rocks very nicely.  Basically the song ponders how our society will be remembered in the future history books.<br />XANADU  One of their greatest songs.  Based on the poem we all had to study in high school.  The variety of music, the building of mood and atmosphere are wonderful.  It is a transcendent song to me, evoking a sense of wonder at first (as the narrator discovers the world of Xanadu, decreed by Kubla Khan).  He proclaims with joy that he has \\"dined on honeydew and drunk the milk of paradise.\\"  But the joy turns to bitterness when this now immortal man discovers he cannot leave.  The same lyrics are thrown back with bitter irony.  Musically the song is very complex and Rush uses keyboards very effectively.<br />CLOSER TO THE HEART  Who doesn't know this song?  It's the perfect encapsulation of one of lyricist Neil Peart's great themes, finding a balance between the heart and mind.  In less than four minutes, we go from pleasant acoustic guitar to a blazing electric guitar solo.  Truly a crowning moment for Rush.<br />CINDERELLA MAN  \\"Because he was human, because he had goodness, because he was moral, they called him insane...Delusions of grandeur, visions of splendor, this manic-depressive who walks in the rain.\\"  I'm sorry, but the lyrics to this song are just awful.  Geddy Lee is responsible for them, and I love Geddy, but let's leave lyrics to Neil, except in the case of...<br />MADRIGAL which is a pretty enough \\"romantic ballad\\" (the music is really too simple) but the lyrics don't really come across as sincere.  It's as though they wanted to showthey could do a \\"pretty\\" song, but their heart wasn't in it.  Much like TEARS, from the 2112 album, an easily dispensible song.<br />CYGNUS X-1  A hard song to warm up to, but it actually has an amazing build to it.  It takes its time, but unlike FAREWELL TO KINGS, for example, which suddenly switches from acoustic to all-out electric noise, this one builds SO gradually it kinda sneaks up on you.  And it evokes a feeling of outer-space mysteriousness.  Lyrically, there isn't much here, but it that isn't really critical.  It's the music that's so much fun.  Many of these musical (and lyrical)themes are followed up on HEMISPHERES, their next album, and if you can, listen to those two together one after another.<br />Naturally, I recommend the album, but for a casual fan, check out 2112 or HEMISPHERES  (although XANADU is awfully good).
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash is a country legend and even if you aren't a country fan you have heard his music through his collaboration with other musicians or through television.  I first heard his song \\"Personal Jesus\\" on our campus alternative radio station and was shocked that this legend was being played on a station that played alternative.  I knew I had to know more about this CD and instead of stealing it from the internet like I usually do in MP3 form, I bought it.  Never have I heard that much emotion in a song like I did on Hurt.  Cash is not young anymore, you can hear his age in his voice showing that he knows his days are number.  The sound of his voice is the same and is still comforting but the new rasp from age makes you realize the youthful man in black is gone, replaced by a timeless yet ageing man.  I played this album for my parents and they weren't interested in some of the newer songs he was singing but that was because they had never heard of them before but Cash bridged a gap between generations.  The generation that grew up listening to Folsom Prison Blues can now hear Personal Jesus and appreciate it with their younger generation children.  Cash had my respect before but now he has my admiration for sharing his music and soul in this album.  He touches every song he sings as he brings life to old and new songs.  This man is dying.  This is a man giving his last breaths to what he loves and what he has lived for the past 50 years of his life.  This is a poignant, stunning, and emotional album for any generation.
0151008116|5.0|It's hard to add to the fantastic reviews already written about this book, but I'd like to voice yet another opinion about how wonderful it is.  I thought the premise utterly intriguing from the first review I read about the book, and I was in no way disappointed. The character of Pi Patel is engaging and charming, and he's one of the most endearing characters I've &quot;met&quot; in recent fiction.  Having finished this book just yesterday I am still in the process of digesting it. This is a book that will remain with me for a long time and one I plan to re-read at some point in the future. I'm positive it will hold up to my high opinion of it when I do get around to the re-read.  This book has renewed my faith in contemporary literature.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|The DVD issue of Mildred Pierce does the movie proud. Joan Crawford won the best actress oscar in 1945 for her role as a woman left alone to raise her two daughters, one of which is spoiled rotten and portrayed by a young Ann Blyth. The movie begins and ends with the same murder scene. While in a police station Mildred narrates her struggles as a jobless mother after her husband leaves her. In desperation she takes a job as a waitress and is so driven that she finally becomes owner of her own restaurant. But there's no pleasing her ungrateful daughter Veda (Ann Blyth) no matter what sacrifices Mildred makes. The DVD issue boasts a pristine picture quality. The flip side of the DVD contains a wonderful documentary \\"Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Movie Star\\", the best I've ever seen. My only complaint is that the DVD cover art and back cover photo of Joan sporting a pistol is actually advertising a different movie. Hopefully someone will notice and correct this mistake soon. Otherwise, highly recommended.
B00005JL96|4.0|It's about what I thought it would be. It's funny at moments, warm at moments, sad, and exciting. Everything that makes a good movie. However it lacks that Disney magic. I really did not feel like I was watching a Disney movie. You can't compare this movie to &quot;Snow White&quot;, &quot;Beauty &amp; the Beast&quot; or any other of the magical movies Disney used to make. The thing I liked most about this movie was the excellent hand painted backgrounds. They were truly beautiful to look at. Disney had better get back on the ball because they are no longer the only company out there who can make a good cartoon. &quot;Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron&quot; was a far better movie.
B000002LQR|4.0|The second album featuring John Frusciante and Chad Smith, Blood Sugar Sex Magik represents a growing maturity that began with the previous Mother's Milk, and in my opinion it stands as their strongest release yet (most of the Hillel Slovak/Jack Irons-era albums don't do much for me). This 1991 Rick Rubin-produced release is their longest album, and as an interesting sidenote it was recorded in a house in downtown L.A. There's some moments of applause and people chattering in the background, giving this album the feel of a laid-back jam session.<br /><br />John Frusciante's more psychedelic guitar playing brings a different element to the Chili Peppers' sound. While Blood Sugar Sex Magik still goes into all-out funk mode (witness Give It Away, If You Have To Ask and Funky Monks, where the \\"funky-ass Flea bass\\" is still fully intact), Anthony Kiedis has also added a mellow croon to his vocal repetoire, which he uses to great effect on the beautiful Breaking The Girl, I Could Have Lied, and Under The Bridge (a ballad dedicated to the fallen Slovak, a victim of drug abuse). Of course, the fans who knew RHCP as a juvenile funk-rock outfit saw this as an attempt to \\"sell-out,\\" but the softer songs are still quality work.<br /><br />The reason why this stands as the greatest RHCP album are the first 12 songs. While there are a few other RHCP songs that stand at the same level or higher than any of the songs on the first half of Blood Sugar Sex Magik, this is the only RHCP album that delivers so many great songs in a row without any inconsistency or a spot of filler. Kicking off with the political Power Of Equality, the album then launches into helpings of both raunchy funk and tender ballads, with the Flea-propelled Suck My Kiss and Breaking The Girl, with its steel drums at the climax, as my favorites of both styles respectively.<br /><br />As usual though, Blood Sugar Sex Magik unravels toward the end. While The Greeting Song and My Lovely Man are both great funky tracks, Apache Rose Peacock is rather bland, Sir Psycho Sexy suffers from rather inane lyrics (pretty jam at the end, though), and the one-minute closer They're Red Hot is kinda pointless. Still, this is one of the best albums released in '91, and worth your attention.acock is rather bland, Sir Psycho Sexy suffers from rather inane lyrics (pretty jam at the end, though), and the one-minute closer They're Red Hot is kinda pointless.

B000002UA0|4.0|in the middle part, the guitar (using a vocoder or bag or some kind of effect like that) 'says ', in a gasping tone, &quot;you're choking me&quot;.  The end of the song ends with an odd drum cadence with off time rimshots: running footsteps and gunshots.
B00006I9HJ|5.0|I'm greatly irritated by the apparent lack of good music taste that some people (like Mr. Minnesota) have.  There is but one way that I can believe that a person can be completely dissatisfied with this album and that is if that person bought the album expecting 10 or 12 tracks of \\"Popular\\".  Realize that this is not the same grungy-era band of 1995 that produced the one-hit wonder \\"Popular\\".  <br />That band is virtually history and they have regrouped and produced some masterfully melodic work on their last two albums.  As honest reviewers have already noted, Let Go is not of the same attitude as Proximity Effect.  It provides a calmer, more reflective rainy afternoon feel.  It's hard to point out \\"highlights\\" because every song on this album (even the usually worthless bonus tracks) is something special.  <br />Like on Proximity Effect, it is obvious that a lot of time was spent composing the melodies, perhaps one reason that some of this generation's clowns are dissatisfied with this album.  If you buy this album, you will be treated to songs that actually stress elements of a musical effort, rather than a mixture of all-out distortion and fuzz with mind-numbing bass lines.  Nada Surf is one of the few bands that has been able to mature from this sad, money-hungry garage band era.  And for those who believe that Nada Surf \\"died etc,\\" Nada Surf has developed a great following not only in the States, but even more so in Europe and it is unfortunate that such a talented group of hard-working artists have been plagued by the self-loving bussiness industry that is the modern-day music world.  <br />I'm not comparing Nada Surf to them, but recall the troubles of that little group called the BEATLES!!!  Goes to show you that you cannot always trust the product that the industry yields...maybe your friends won't all have heard the songs or seen the videos, but...<br />...well, to make a long story short: DON'T DEPEND ON REVIEWS OR RATINGS TO MAKE YOUR DECISION FOR YOU!!!  Listen to the clips...if at any point you want more, BUY IT, you won't be sorry!!!
B00005JKDR|5.0|I really didn't think that I would like this movie, but I'm glad to say that it proved me wrong. What a funny animated film and a little weird at the same time. I really like the balance of characters and their personalities in this movie. Pixar entertainment did a fantastic job and it's worth seeing it over and over again with your kids and their friends. Enjoy!
B000002OZY|4.0|Yes, Tommy was innovative as the first rock opera. Pete Townshend should be proud of this achievement. And yes, there is classic Who material on this album, that was especially noteworthy at their concerts. From the opening notes of Overture to the \\"Listening to you\\" coda, Tommy never failed to rouse an audience.<br />...But unfortunately, my reaction to the studio album is more lukewarm. Yes, there are brilliant songs here--Pinball Wizard, Sally Simpson, Amazing Journey, The Acid Queen (a favorite), and Christmas, but there is a surplus of small bits of filler between the highlights. Pieces like Tommy's Holiday Camp, Miracle Cure, Do You Think It's Alright, and There Is A Doctor aren't really necessary to the concept and Townshend could've edited these tracks from the album without ill effect.<br />Also, the album suffers from thin production. Keith's drums, always a highlight of other Who albums, are buried deep in the mix, while Entwistle's bass is also pushed out. Townshend and especially Daltrey turn out great performances, but overall the studio version lacks the trademark muscle of other Who recordings.<br />While Tommy is a worthy achievement, Townshend would incorporate the lessons he learned from Tommy into Quadrophenia, the definitive Who opera. Buy that first, followed by Who's Next, Live At Leeds (preferably the deluxe version with a complete live version of Tommy), and The Who Sell Out.
B000066C1N|2.0|Well, based on what I've read from the other reviews, maybe I just got a bad apple.  I do LOVE the songs on this CD, it's just that they all sound like they're coming out of two bad speakers (and they're not).  The music sounds a whole lot smoother coming from my Spirit VHS movie.  The music from my CD (bought brand-new) has a sort of scratchy sound to it, not just Bryan Adams but the instrumentals as well, no matter how I adjust the sound.  Just in case this is how it is supposed to sound, I would advise you to listen to the music before you buy the CD, because to me the soundtrack is a disappointment compared the the music in the movie.

B00006JJ1O|4.0|As he did with Propaganda oh-so-many years ago, Trevor Horn proves that Europop synthesisers and an interesting female accent make for a potent pop combination. This time around, the fact that there are <i>two</i> mysterious eastern european females involved - teenage lesbian lovers, no less! - merely enhances the mystique. Horn clearly understands the value of good packaging, but happily this isn't a case of all-wrapper-no-sandwich...
B00006CXXU|5.0|i TOTALLY dig this record for lots of reasons, most of which cuz christina a. is finally doin' what SHE wants ta do, not listenin' to the perpetrators who THINK they KNOW what she should do.<br />but this album rox cuz Christina a. uses her soulful voice to scream her message.  she don't need to use sex as a marketing tool like Brit, Whit, J-Lo on da block or Mariah \\"MC\\" Carey...no, Christina a. gots the goods to go far, and she does it with her voice, plus a wide range of musical tastes that vary from the usual pop formula norm.  Way to go, Christina a!!<br />Well, all I can say is you gots to listen to her beautiful voice to believe it.  no computers on these vocals, folks, just good old fashioned soul to make ya' groove....<br />I'll see ya later.
B00005YW4H|3.0|I'm enjoying this CD very much and think it worth the purchase--if you love, like I do, jazz vocalists.  The voice, her handling of the materials, the tunes--it's an unusual, pretty package to listen to.   That being said, the CD suffers from problems with pacing, energy, and intensity.  Jone's moody, sensual delivery can and does slide into sleepiness, as others have noted.  Her delivery needs work, the selection of the material could have been made more upbeat, and her own compositions trimmed or perhaps removed altogether--they seem a bit premature.  BUT this singer is a mere baby; give her time, there's much talent and potential here!
B00005JKZT|4.0|I have seen the movie twice and, at least during the first hour of the movie, I thought that it couldn't be closer to J.R.R Tolkien's words. <br />Frodo and Sam capturing Gollu; Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli chasing the uruk-hai; Gandalf and the Balrog (the last fight between these two characters seemed kind of how-did-they-got-there-and-why-did-he-die-after-the-Balrog, but it wasn't that important to me); Rohan; Saruman; Treebeard; and then began the problems. <br />I find the fact that the elves had anything to do in the battle of Helm's Deep insulting; of course, it filled the battle with action, but they were not supposed to be there. They took away the victory from men. I mean, \\"the alliance between men and elves is over,\\" didn't Gandalf say that \\"it is in men where we must place our hope\\" in the Fellowship. If Jackson wanted to show the death of thousands of elves, he could have shown all the times Lothlórien was assailed. If they took the Arwen-Aragorn story out of the appendixes, why didn't they show Celeborn fighting orcs? Lothlórien was assailed like three or four times before the end of the story. <br />Why was Eomer vanished? I don't know. Eomer was supposed to be there from the beginning of the battle at Helm's Deep. If Jackson didn't want to show the trees that help them win the battle, then he should have sent ents (at least that would be closer). <br />The scenes when Pippin and Merry are carried by Treebeard got a little boring. Merry and Pippin spend almost the whole movie on Treebeard's shoulders and seem to be getting nowhere. Worst is the fact that all the Ents refused for so long to go into battle with Saruman and ended up destroying the undestructible Isengard five minutes before the movie was over. <br />They also made Gollum more the victim of Frodo's actions than of the ring. In the book Gollum wanted to take Frodo and Sam to \\"Her\\" so he wouldn't have to go against his promise, but in the movie it was because Frodo led him to the hands of the Gondorians who battered the old creature. The closing song was even about that. <br />I recognize that if I hadn't read the book, I would have thought Gollum to have a touching and interesting story, but that was just cheap. I won't even talk about Faramir or of the meeting between Frodo and the Ring-Wraith mounted on his fell beast or Aragorn's adventures or Gimli's new job as the buffoon of the story or Theoden's presumptuous character, he's supposed to be very different from Denethor, and in the movie he is a bit worst. I disliked the Théoden from the movie more than I disliked the Denethor from the book.<br />Of course, I cannot deny that the movie has its good side. There would be no flaw in it for anyone who hasn't read the book or who considers that a script has to be different from a book. It is better than \\"The Fellowship\\" and a lot of work went into making the story, but I cannot help to think that if what Peter Jackson wanted was to make a story of brave warriors and love strories, he could have made a re-make of \\"King Kong\\". <br />But well, nobody's perfect and there are many good parts to the movie that outweight the changes. So, if you are not a die-hard fan of the book and will not break your TV when you see that the movie is a Peter Jackson story based on the story by J.R.R Tolkien and not a J.R.R Tolkien movie, I recommend it. <br />All in all, with all its changes, \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" is a good film.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I can only repeat the great things already written about this film -- but on another level, THELMA & LOUISE probably changed the very face of movies, and its influence remains today.<br />How, you may ask?  Through one scene and one scene alone, the definition of male sexuality in American cinema was forever changed.  It also made Brad Pitt a major Hollywood star.<br />I'm talking about the scene in the lonely hotel room where Pitt took off his shirt for Geena Davis, revealing six-pack abs, well-defined shoulders, a muscular chest and nary an ounce of fat to be seen.  Brad Pitt took off his shirt and the women of America lost their collective minds.  The reaction in movie theatres to that scene was so visceral that every Hollywood leading man since has learned the potential value of hitting the weight room to \\"pump up\\".<br />Think about it.  Today, a movie producer wouldn't dream of casting a leading man who wasn't at least in top physical condition, and preferably with a killer bod to boot.  Before THELMA & LOUISE, a good male hardbody was a luxury in movies, and it usually manifested itself in action movies -- think Schwarzenegger or Van Damme. Today, a Hollywood male actor has zero chance of being considered \\"sexy\\" unless he's got that Brad Pitt bod that America first saw in THELMA & LOUISE.
B000065U1N|5.0|This is  the best movie that depicts a crisis like this one in times of Peace-DON'T FORGET, WE WERE NOT AT WAR, WE WERE MERELY TRYING TO HELP OUT THE 500,000 PEOPLE WHO HAD DIED FROM STARVATION, because of their corrupt leader. I would say that this movie is just as good as Saving Private Ryan, if not better. This is a movie to own!
B00004VVNB|5.0|'Logan's Run' is a great film about the city of a fascistic society in the future where no one is allowed to live past 30, instead they are transformed into dead people by a futuristic lightshow celebrated by the town's inhabitants.  The society is controlled by a 'Brave New World' type Bacchanal government, which means you can do what you want, but at 30, make way for others like a good citizen.  No one knows that they are actually killed, however.  <BR>Logan decides he don't play that game, and goes on the lam with a girl, finding his way outside and past a cheesy robot that likes to store running people as food.  The robot is humorous in a 'Black Hole' sort of way, but probably the film's only low point.  <BR>The special effects surpass previous 70's sci-fiers (aside from '2001').  This film is perhaps more poignant today than when it was made in the 70's, when now it appears our American society is used to the Bacchanal mind control that was merely in its infancy when this film was made.
B00005JL2O|4.0|The third Austin movie is the best of the three! <BR>I was laughing out loud at some points. <BR>Mike Myers new character \\"Goldmember\\" is hilarious when he speaks whit a dutch accent and eats his own skin. <BR>DVD owners can watch a really, really funny (deleted) scene where Goldmember is explaining to dr Evil what a \\"fazha\\" is!! <BR>If you like this type of humour, give this movie a try!

0316666343|2.0|At first i was excited to read this book having heard and read so much about it but it turned out to be disappointing particularly the character of Susie Salmon's mother, Abigail. The author never made clear her emotions and why she left her family ro drift off in some far away places only to come back when her husband had a heart attack. I thought the author made a very superficial character, weak and undeveloped. All in all this book is a big disappointmnet and it reads more like a third grade novel than a literary achievement it was hyped to be.
B00000HYXB|5.0|when i saw this disc i was a little skeptical.  i enjoyed classical and prog. rock interpritations of middle earth, but considered the idea of a &quot;rock opera&quot; a little out there.  still, after reading some lyrics and listening to a few sample songs, I was hooked.  I bought the CD the next night.<br />opening with the sounds of war, this cd takes you from the depths of the dark lords realm to the mourning of the Noldor in Valinor.  the style changes from song to song, jumping genres faster than a hobbit can drink a glass of mead.  all of the songs were wonderful.  my favorites were: into the storm, nightfall, the eldar, noldor(dead winter reigns), and some of the short intros were interesting.<br />I am not a power metal fan, but i recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys good lyrics and a great story.  the music fits the mood exactly.  I think that i will burn out the cd before the year is done
B00006JJ1O|5.0|This cd is a must have no matter what what you \\"might\\" think or pretend to know about julia and lena.They are like any other pop group \\"hidden identity\\" so ignore the rumors, take them for what they are worth, and just enjoy their music.<br />As for the UK recent ban on them on tv, I think all you people over there controlling the music television channels are pretty narrowminded, ignorant, and simple.tATu is #1 over there, and I hope you loose alot of money for being such dumb ....<br />TATU FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Moulin Rouge is an unique, ambitious and heart-wrenching movie.  Baz Luhrmann is a creative genius and a visionary who definitely deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Director in 2001. I personally feel that it's a crime that the movie did not win the Oscar! This movie has all the elements of a classic: great music, excellent performances, breathtaking sets and a beautiful love story.  Ewan McGregor's performance is truly amazing.  Not only is his singing fabulous, but he plays Christian with total abandonment and passion.  He moves me and also deserved an Oscar nod. Nicole Kidman's performance is gutsy and heartfelt.<br />The DVD of the movie comes with many extras that definitely make it worth the money.  First off, make sure that you have a surround sound system.  It's is the only way to really appreciate the music.  The musical documentary portion is very interesting and gives an idea of the work that went into selecting the songs for the movie.  I also recommend watching the movie with the commentary from Baz Luhrmann and Catherine Martin.  It provides great insight into the movie making process.  <br />If you saw the movie in the theater and didn't like it, I recommend trying the DVD.  Watch it with an open mind and you won't be disappointed!
6305922756|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Like the Blair Witch Project (except good), it is filmed as a documentary which follows a legendary British rock band on their comeback tour. Unfortunately for them their popularity is waning and everything is going wrong. Their on-stage mishaps are extremely funny, probably more so than usual because it is easy to forget it is just a movie. Besides their concert mistakes, the characters themselves are extremely entertaining and convincing. Not only are the actors convincing, but they are talented. They have good voices and although I am not a fan of that type of music it is still kind of catchy. If you like to laugh you have to watch this movie.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Derivative, boring, and beyond stupid, zombie flick \\"Resident Evil\\" misses every possible opportunity to scare, thrill, or even make sense. It doesn't even have the gorey guts of its video game inspiration. Your best bet? Skip this soulless claptrap and see how good movies weave complex plots, well-drawn characters, and true scares into a terrifying whole. \\"Aliens,\\" \\"Dawn of the Dead.\\" and \\"Blade 2\\" are an excellent start.
B00006M183|5.0|I really had high expectations for the new pearl Jam album and to tell you the truth I think it's amazing and I can't wait to see them in tour.  This is their most heartfelt album and they just continue to make good albums from Vitalogy and on. Long LIVE PEARL JAM!
B00003CXCD|5.0|This movie is a classic. Heburn and Peck have great chemistry. The movie is funny and entertaining. It is about a princess who runs away and tries to enjoy her freedom as a normal girl. Little does she know that her new friends are aware of her identity and are trying to get an exclusive story on her. If you like Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, classic movies, comedies, or simply being entertained you should definitely try this movie. Now it is even sweeter because it is out on DVD. The DVD is lovely. It has a beautiful animated menu with bonus features such as documentaries, a photo gallery, and even clips from Hepburn's audition. Buy it. You will not be disappointed.
B000003TAW|5.0|When Maladroit came out earlier this year, a lot of people were buying it and raving about it. I had never really heard Weezer before (except for &quot;Keep Fishin'&quot;), but I thought that it was worth the money to give it a try. A friend of mine who has liked Weezer for a while said &quot;No, start with the basics. Buy the blue album.&quot; I bought it, and it is great.<br />Every song has a certain feel to it, and they're all fun to listen to. Some are more upbeat (&quot;Buddy Holly&quot; &quot;No One Else&quot;), and some are more on the slow side (&quot;Only in Dreams&quot; &quot;Holiday&quot;), but I gotta say I love them all. Yeah, they are somewhat on the simple side, but if you actually listen to them, they all have something to say. Rivers Cuomo is quite skilled with a pen and a piece of paper. <br />The best song without a doubt is &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;. <br />I love this cd. I think that no matter what kind of music you're into, this is definately worth a try.
B00005JKZT|5.0|If you thought that the ending in the \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" was dumb, you would be wrong! \\"The Two Towers\\" continues the terrifying journey of Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Austin) in an attempt to destroy the Evil Ring, the ancient Ring of Sauron, by casting it back into the fires of the volcano, Mt. Doom. It's a classic adventure story, a true epic novel from author John Ronald Ruel Tolkien.<br />While Frodo and Sam struggle to reach Mt. Doom through the help of the mischievious Gollum, Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are out to save the Kingdom of Rohan, and Merry and Pippin, who've been kidnapped by Orc and the fighting Uruk-hai, have just escaped, and now, they've met a new friend, the Ent (tree guardian) Treebeard! Join the talking tree and the two hobbits as they go for some Orc/Saruman fightin', rock throwin', a feel the joy as they break the dam of Isengard and flood the place!<br />In this novel, we are introduced to King Theoden and the Kingdom of Rohan, who are corrupted by the king's advisor, Wormtongue, who happens to be a spy from Saruman! Can Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas, who are reunited with Gandalf the White (perviously Gandalf the White) (played by Ian McKellen), save the day? Sure they can! And we are introduced to Eomar, the king's nephew, and Eowyn, the king's niece. See the most exciting part in the story, the battle in the Rohan fortress, Helm's Deep, as the heroes battle millions of Uruk-hai!<br />Meanwhile, while the battle rages on, and while Merry and Pippin are with Treebeard and his Ents, Frodo and Sam, who've just met Faramir and his other men, are learning to trust Gollum. He happens to be one of the funny characters.<br />This movies was awsome, and best of all, it'll probably become a classic. Here at Amazon.com, it has received many 5-Star reveiws, but that bad part is that it also has 1-Star reveiws, but don't let that stop you from seeing it.  Though \\"Chicago\\" took the Best Picture Award, \\"The Two Towers\\" will always be the bestpicture of 2003 to me.
B000066NW0|3.0|This cd isn't that bad, and I don't mind listening to it, but come on, this is not punk. &quot;Let Go&quot; is and okay cd, but Avril parades around saying that she is a skater punk and that her music is punk. It is not. If she didn't go around saying it was, I would probably like it more. <br />In its own element, this cd isn't really all that bad. The songs are fun to listen to. The lyrics are a little corny sometimes, but they're not bad. By corny, I mean that a lot of the songs are saying &quot;I'm different! I'm no teeny bopper!&quot;. She REALLY runs it into the ground sometimes. <br />So basically what I'm saying is that if you buy this cd hoping for some punk extravaganza, you will be very dissapointed, but if you buy this cd for something fun to listen to, you won't.<br />If you want punk, listen to something that is actually punk, like the Clash.
0792151712|3.0|This film, which is based on the real-life story of the Titanic, but includes a cheesy love story between two stupid people, won eleven academy awards and is considered one of the world's greatest films.  Yeah right!  It doesn't have any best actor/actress awards, and Leonard DiCaprio definately didn't deserve an oscar.  The only time where he express any feelings was when he and the other men began to break the bar door with a chair.<br />Setting during the time of the Titanic, which is during 1912, \\"Titanic\\" tells the story of two crazy lovers, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor guy, and Rose (Kate Winslet), a rich girl who's just plain sick of her life.  During a suicide attempt, she gets \\"saved\\" by Jack, who teaches her the meaning of life.  Blah, blah, blah, blah.  Soon they fall in love, even though Rose is engaged to a rich guy, Cal Hawkly (Billy Zane, the best actor here, aside from the guy who played the captain). <br />Then, the two stupid lovers start running around in the Titanic, doing all so sort of things, oh, who knows what!  Let's forget Leonardo and Kate, and let's all focus on the Titanic, the TRUE main character of the story, as we witness it crash into the iceberg and sink.  With dozens of special effects, the sinking of the Titanic was the best scene in the movie, not the nude drawing (Kate Winslet's bare breats are seen!!  Ahh!!).  And yahoo!  Dumb Jack died!<br />Here at Amazon.com, \\"Titanic\\" has many negative reveiws, but personally, I think it was okay.  I think that the Titanic and its sinking was what made this movie cool and greatest movie made, not the two lovers.  It won the Best Picture, but hey, where's the Best Actors and Actresses Awards??  And where are all the other oscars???  <br />I kind of liked it, but there are problems here, which just brings the film down.  For that, I give it less than five stars.  I hope Leonardo does a good job \\"The Gangs of New York\\".<br />The End
B00005JKZT|5.0|I suppose this is directed mainly to those, like me, who have read the Lord of the Rings many times, each time finding more to enjoy. Fantasy lovers cannot help but be swept up in the book, which is at the same time simple and profound. Peter Jackson undertook the huge challenge of making a movie of this complex tale covering a years time in a place long lost in time - Middle Earth. Jackson triumphs, blending first rate casting, breathaking cinematography and stunning visual effects to recreate this marvelous time and place and tell the tale of a great burden borne by an unlikely hero, aided along the way by brave and faithful friends who walk through \\"fire and death\\" to complete the quest. The movie is true to as much of the tale as can be squeezed into 3 hours, with only a few nods to political correctness amd losing none of the key elements of the story. Some gripe because a part of the story they felt was important or particularly enjoyable was omitted, or that one of the characters is not portrayed as they fancied them. If that's the worst that can be said, then this is an achievement indeed.
630575067X|5.0|As the first chapter in the saga, Episode I introduces us to young Anakin Skywalker (played by Jake Loyd), who takes the first step in becoming a Jedi while remaining unaware that he will soon become the evil Darth Vader. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), the beloved, wise master, is introduced as a hard-working apprentice, who is under the teachings of Qui-Jon Ginn (Liam Neeson). And before there was Princess Leia, there was a young Queen (Natalie Portman).<br />Twenty years after the first \\"Star Wars\\" movie, George Lucas has returned to directing a movie, but he probably doesn't remember how to direct. With Episode I, Lucas takes us to the golden age of free people, when the Jedi Knight are the supreme protectors of peace a justice, while they are unaware of the spying ways of the Sith, Darth Sidious and his apprentice Darth Maul, who performs an awesome fight.<br />Many have complained about the foolishness of Jar Jar Binks, and many fans have feared that this is the end, but to me, Jar Jar was okay. I was even amused by some of his jokes. Though the movie is okay, the pod race was heart pounding, and Darth Maul was so awesome! I just wish they showed more of 'em. I also wish that they had not used to much CGI. So, c'mon people! Let's not get too harsh over this film, just give it a chance! Because of the many angry reveiwers, I do not recommend this to the drama fans.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I walked into a CD store shopping for something else and they had Norah Jones playing on their in-store system.  I got totally distracted by her wonderful voice and song selection and had to own that CD.  After I finally recovered from the wonder of hearing her voice, I finally remembered what I had gone there to buy in the first place and I bought that CD and &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; by Norah.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I've seen a couple of reviews here that tackle the task of commenting on albums by breaking it down track by track.  So here's my attempt to do the same with Binaural.<br />1) Breakerfall - one of the weaker tracks on the, in that, as another reviewer put it, it's  your \\"riff-heavy standard opening song.\\"  A decent rocker, to be sure, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Brings to mind \\"Brain of J,\\" the opener to Yield, while, for instance, No Code's \\"Sometimes\\" ignored PJ's own standard that the album opener must be a hard-driving rocker.<BR>2) God's Dice - Initially, this track did nothing for me, but has since grown on me considerably.  Not a great song, but a speedy, thought-provoking number, just the same.<BR>3) Evacuation - My favorite on the album; seems to give the the album considerable punch.  I love the Dave Grohl-like vocal intensity Ed Vedder imparts to the refrain, something you mighn't think he could duplicate onstage, but, amazingly, he's capable of coming really close.<BR>4) Light Years - The track that first made me sit up and really start listening to the album.  If Pearl Jam really wanted a hit from this album, this would've been it.<BR>5) Nothing As It Seems - The first single, I believe, or at least the first song played off the album on radio.  Not a track that immediately grabs you, but one that, like many of PJ's post Ten/Vs/Vitalogy songs, require time for appreciation.  An intense, brooding, haunting anti-ballad (for lack of a better term).<BR>6) Thin Air - Here's where my \\"bit too even\\" summary remark comes into play.  For the next six songs, starting with this song, Ed and Stone Gossard alternate songs, which struck me as a little weird somehow.  It points to a deliberate attempt to space everyone's songs out evenly on the album.  In fact, I don't think two of any songwriter's songs are placed next to each other.  This is kind of where my problem with the album is; it's not just that Ed and Stone alternate songs, it's that they also alternate mood.  Except for Gossard's \\"Rival,\\" EV's songs are the power numbers and SG's are the lush ballads.  This kind of makes the album too even, perhaps that's why it's perhaps perceived as being a little flat.  Anyway, enough kooky rambling, on to the song.  Like I mentioned earlier, a lush ballad that invokes No Code's \\"Around the Bend.<BR>7) Insignificance - A haunting rocker lamenting hopelessness and helplessness in the face of destructive powers.<BR>8) Of the Girl - An even lusher, sexier ballad than Track 6.  There's a very palpable Eastern influence present.<BR>9) Grievance - Back the \\"evenness\\" comment, Vedder's two songs with similar suffixes.  But that's about all I can find bad to say about it (and the album in general); this song simply rocks.<BR>10) Rival - At last the pattern is broken, and the album finally turns up the volume on a song by Stone Gossard.  It's not a fast number, but it is a loud and crunching and absolutely amazing one.  The way the song opens, a dog growling, kind of tips you off that you're in for a rocking good time.<BR>11) Sleight Of Hand - Here, PJ finally remembers that Jeff Ament is a pretty good song writer too and he contributes to the (the music halfsongwriting on this track ), which is yet another ballad.  But it's a good one, and a hugely atmospheric one at that, so why complain.<BR>12) Soon Forget - Nice little ditty playe on a ukelele.  Perhaps it's a throwaway track, but it doesn't detract from the album.  And after all the atmospherics of the previous track, it's a nice change of pace.<BR>13) Parting Ways - Wouldn't you know it, yet ANOTHER ballad.  This one seemed to take an age for me to really appreciate, but it was worth the wait.  A great end to an, overall, very good album.
B000002KY8|5.0|Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remsater and reissue all of Prince's Warner Bros. catalog, and since there's so many albums to cover, they should release everything in 2-CD sets.

B000000W5P|5.0|\\"Some Girls\\" still remains the last truly great Rolling Stones record, a title not likely to be usurped any time soon. While it's not quite up to the level of the 'Big Four' from 1968-72, it head and shoulders above \\"Black and Blue\\" and lightyears beyond almost anything that came after it. \\"Some Girls\\" is loaded with grit, raunchiness, attitude, edginess and all the things that defined the band at their peak. Though it capitalized on the peak sounds of the day - punk and disco - the band still had enough creative juices flowing to make a distinctly Stones sounding record that merely incorporated others' sounds without aping them (the exact opposite being the problem with the reggae and funk forays on \\"Black and Blue,\\" which often bordered on parody).<br /><br />\\"Some Girls\\" yielded two of their last major classics, the funky \\"Miss You\\" and the slow burning \\"Beast of Burden,\\" as well as the seedy New York City love letter \\"Shattered,\\" Keith's jovial anthem of survival, \\"Before They Make Me Run,\\" an aggressive update of The Temptations' \\"Just My Imagination,\\" and several other well respected album cuts. The new remaster of the album is excellent, the songs' often fast and furious sound exploding out of the speakers like they're meant to be heard. The new packaging is terrific and the bonus live dvd from Houston represents the band while they were still incomparable live, relying on raw energy rather than fireworks and pyrotechnics.<br /><br />The one disappointment for me is the bonus cd of outtakes. Often there is at least one hidden gem within a collection of outtakes, but I find nothing memorable about the songs chosen for this collection. Some are humorous (the true like crime tale \\"Claudine\\" and the vulgar \\"So Young\\") and \\"No Spare Parts\\" is actually rather well done and touching, but other than that none of the tracks stayed with me enough to ever give them a repeated listen.<br /><br />Despite that, this deluxe edition is still worth purchasing for the remastered sound, excellent packaging, and the Houston dvd., and the Houston dvd.
B000002KLP|5.0|DIRTY MIND is defintely the most straightforward album Prince has ever made - though at eight tracks and 30 minutes, it's more like an EP. Warner Bros. or Rhino Records should remaster and reissue this album as well as all of Prince's Warner Bros. catalog because the original CD pressings don't sound as good as they could be. In fact, since there's so many albums to cover, they should rerelease his music in 2-CD sets to cover everything - and the first four albums are short enough that they could all fit on two discs. Here's what should be:<br />PRINCE/1978-1981 (FOR YOU, PRINCE, DIRTY MIND, CONTROVERSY)<br />CD 1<BR>1. For You<BR>2. In Love<BR>3. Soft And Wet<BR>4. Crazy You<BR>5.

B00006RAKP|4.0|Here's the thing: If you already have Elton John's original Greatest Hits CDs, I & II then you have all of whats on the first CD of this set and more, but minus the last track, \\"Sorry seems to be the hardest word\\", which can be found along with \\"Blue Eyes\\" (not included on 1970-2002) on Elton John Greatest Hits '76-'86. Also if you have GH '76-'86 you have 6 of the songs from CD 2 of this set. Next, if you bought the CD \\"Love Songs\\" and the '97 Candle in the Wind/Something about the way...CD single, then you have another 7 songs from CD 2.  Leaving you with four tracks included on the new set that you don't have: \\"I don't wanna go on with you like that\\", \\"Written in the stars\\", \\"I want love\\", and \\"This train don't stop there anymore\\".  So no matter what way you go there's always going to be at least one track you're looking for.  You may not be able to avoid overlapping.<br />If you don't have anything, I would recommend getting 1970-2002 along with either \\"Love Songs\\" or \\"1976-1986\\" and if that's not enough Elton, you probably ought to just seek out his original albums.  The real Elton freaks probably won't even consider this set, but for the casual fan, it just about has it all.

B000001EYO|2.0|Disappointing. Dylan's \\"Man In Me\\" carries the soundtrack. Don't know why this soundtrack didn't have \\"Run Through the Jungle\\" and \\"Lookin' Out My Back Door,\\" the two Creedence Clearwater Revival songs you hear playing during The Dude's escapades in his car. This leaves you with Kazaa, or buying Creedence's \\"Chronicle.\\" I had the CCL album anyways, which, on its own, has 20 awesome songs at an incredible value.

0783235666|3.0|'The Birds' Is kind of a 50-50 movie. At times, if you've never seen it before, it can be a little, well, shocking. The plot, however is actually very thin, and the movie virtually has NO ending. I don't like sayng anything negative about a Hitch movie, I'm typically predjudiced in his favor. This movie, however, is rather mediocre. Buy it and watch it, you might like it, but give 'Psycho', 'Rope', and 'Rear window' a try too. They're considerably better.
B00006LPER|3.0|Don't expect exploitation movie it's not a Ilsa.  It's not so disturbing. Not so bad but not enough explicit and no shock value. We know the teacher is a bad girl but she could be more dirty so the film is not enough graphic to be remembered. It's cool to have long dialogues but if it's going nowhere (like this one) it must, at least by compensation, show some graphic\explicit scene to enjoy something in the movie. Not just a nowhere blah blah like this one. Not a bad story but nothing to see.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash has improved with age, not like a fine wine, but more like a mature whisky.  A young man could not sing these songs with such depth and such profound personal faith.<br />&quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot; is another in an astounding collection.  Continuing the theme in the previous American recordings,  Cash performs a mix of modern interpretations of other musicians coupled with his own current creations.  If you are not familiar with the originals, it is difficult to tell which category a song falls into.  Each song is a treasure of intimacy, and I feel privileged that he has chosen to share them.<br />I enjoyed &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot; and &quot;Desperado&quot; as the familiar cowboy songs that they are.  &quot;Danny Boy&quot; is every thing you think it would be.  Truly touching, however, are the versions of &quot;In My Life&quot; and &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water.&quot;  I am amazed that anyone ever sung these songs any other way.<br />Highly, highly, highly recommended.

B00006FDCD|1.0|The book is great; the movie is terrible.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Wow! Beck doing Diamond Dogs and Bowie doing Nature Boy - that's just the tip of this extraordinary musical iceberg that prances elegantly through the corridors of techno, rock, theater, glam.<br />This unique work also captures the two main actors performing Heroes, among others. That is the testament to the production value and the qaulity of songs on this disc - that two actors not known for their singing are able to pull it off in the company of seasoned musicians.<br />I think the disc captures the magic of the movie so well.
B00006AFUR|5.0|this is one amazing cd.  melodic and full of layers and textures with great vocals and superb music.  the band is primarily actor jared leto playing almost everything but drums which is left to shannon leto.  there are two other members who help out live, one of which helps out sporadically on the album (sorry i forgot their names.  <BR>     the music has alot of synth and can be descriped as spacey but yet it still rocks and do i hear a small dose of tool/APC in some songs?!!? there are dense layers of music with alot of things going on.  the vocals are wonderful adn this cd is a scorcher from begginning to end.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Truly a spectacular work of sound and vision that keeps you tapping your feet and on the edge of your seat throughout. Any film that features the beautiful and talented Nicole Kidman with a soundtrack including David Bowie and Elton John (among others) is worth the time. Soon enough you are swept up in the energy and fusion of total entertainment.<br />The performances are hyperkinetic and mesmerizing while the visuals are stunning. This movie is pure fun!
B00006F2TV|4.0|I have always been a Spiderman fan so I was pleased when they finally decided to make a movie out of the character.  This movie is a lot of fun and true to the comic book hero.  Some people have complained about the special effects not being that spectacular, but that's nitpicking.  The actors and actresses play their roles well, and the movie holds your interest throughout. Even people who are not big comic fans will like this movie.
B00005QDW1|5.0|I had always enjoyed No Doubt's blend of pop-rock and ska anthems, but never actually bought one of their CDs until Rock Steady. This CD shows a band that is embracing new things and won't simply spend the rest if their career trying to regurgitate prior successes. No Doubt is on the verge of becomming legend material. They aren't their yet, but their willingness to accept change is the first step.<br />This is a 5-star CD not because it's absolutely perfect, but because it's as good as CDs get. The genius of Rock Steady is how the band managed to scout out the best artists in their field as producers for each song, yet was able to create a complete, unified album. Some songs scream New Wave, others electronica, and others ska/reggae, but strangely, they're not very dissimilar at all. If I had to describe this album under one genre, I'd say electronic rock, which is why I immediately thought of Garbage as I first listened to this CD. The amazon[.com] review notes this as well.<br />Besides the obvious Hella Good, other standout tracks include Making Out, the Ric Ocasek-helmed \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and \\"Platinum Blonde Life.\\" Note that each song is great though.<br />This album is a great time, so just buy it. Don't keep putting it off.
B00000JGEH|5.0|This is a movie that will be watched for many years to come.  It is so well done I am not even sure where to start.  The movie is hopefully far-fetched, (only time will tell) but the writers and actors have made it believable.  This is an action packed film, that keeps you on the edge of our seat.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Al Pacino (as always) gave an astonishing performance in this psychological thriller. I have to compliment the producers on this one for their intelligence in who they casted. When a theatrical trailer shows that three academy award winners are casted, and that it is from the director of the acclaimed \\"Memento,\\" whether it is even good or not, the film is going to intrigue many people and rake in loads of money. This movie was not at all a disappointment though. Robin Williams was very fun to watch, and seeing him play as a psychopathic murderer for a change kept me as the viewer interested. Hilary Swank is also a brilliant actress and it was good to see her as a woman again! (Boys Don't Cry) Good movie, great acting, and well directed. I give it four stars out of 5. The R rating reflects violence, language, and some ever-so-brief views of a nude corpse.
6300213749|5.0|This is a film that will have you laughing from beginning to end as it transforms that &quot;good cop teams up with a villan&quot; theme.  The good cop in this film (Nolte) isn't actually all that good, and the Villan (Murphy) isn't all that bad.  It seems they both may just end up in the wrong place at the wrong time often.
0060278269|5.0|Abhorsen was an excellent read that i would recommend to anyone. Like its predecessors, it is \\"dark fantasy\\" (which makes them so good) and is one of the top books that i have read. The only bad thing about it is that it's ending is so vague, it leaves the reader thirsting for another novel (which is probably Nix's intention). I really hope that we will get a new book in the future, for goodness knows we need one.
6304618344|5.0|This movie is based on a very strange idea, that doesn't seem all that possible, but the writers and actors have showed their skill once again.  To watch Travolta and Cage strut their stuff as the pretend to be each other only deepens your admiration of them.  They are extremely talanted and to anyone who may not think so, just watch this film.  You will not be dissapointed.
0930289234|5.0|For anyone to ever argue the point that comics should be seen as actual literature should use this as their only example.  Alan Moore crafted an unflinching, highly intelligent, and unbelieveably haunting story with this original 12 issue maxi-series (originally published in 1985) that is considered Moore's best.  In a world where super heroes are no longer fantasy, we see a society torn apart by cold war paranoia, and an uncertain future.  When a retired super hero is mysteriously murdered, an almost fascist hero named Rorshach is trying to find the killer, which leads him to convincing his old partner Nite Owl to come out of retirement to help.  What is uncovered is more than either could have ever imagined, and what develops is nearly beyond comprehension.  Moore's explosive, compelling storytelling and Dave Gibbons' great artwork make Watchmen an unforgettable read whether your a fan of comics or not.  Everything about this collected story is exquisite; from the interludes to hero interviews and autobiography excerpts to the complex yet riveting story all make Watchmen truly one of a kind.  All in all, this is an essential book to be in your comic collection, or even in your book collection as well, it is just that ... good.
6303824382|5.0|I have followed the life and times of John McClane from the beggining, and have always loved Bruce Willis' abilities to make this character come to life and seem so real.  For this reason I wasn't happy to find that he and hife &quot;wife&quot; had divorced sometime between the last movie and this one, but that aspect alone makes the ending of this film worth waiting for.  I also liked the very original escape scene in the film as McClane runs for his life through water filled tunnels.  This is one film you shouldn't miss.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I listened to this &quot;ground breaking&quot; CD and my advice is to go out and buy some Velvet Underground and Stooges CDs and cut right to the source.
6304414145|5.0|This film was a little too typical for my tastes.  The characters follow too many of the same motions as have already been carried out in many other movies by many other characters.  There wasn't much originality.  That doesn't mean that this wasn't a good film.  The cast is filled with strong actors, and they really make theis film work.
B00005B58Y|5.0|There will be 14 reviews posted beneath this one, and most of them agree with me. This is a happy, uptempo disc with several of the greatest musicians in jazz sharing the billing. No atonal dissonance as with the end-stage Coltrane nine years later. No monotonous slow fusion as with the 1970's Davis. This is fun, but done by serious artists. A year after this was released, many of the same performers collaborated on &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and took jazz into a new direction...a good move, by and large, but the bebop, hard bop, cool jazz stylings weren't unpleasant at all, just fully exploited in MD's view. If you like the pre-'70's Miles Davis, and  Coltrane  before &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; and the Cannonball Adderley of the &quot;Somethin' Else&quot; album, you will want to own &quot;Milestones.&quot;
B00000K2SC|4.0|I forced myself to put a 4 star rating on this film. This film has a story line that I had a hard time believing in, and I can't even say that the acting of Keanu Reeves made the film any better. I have never really been impressed with Reeves abilities, but I am less impressed now that ever. <br />I loved the special effects though. They were spectacullar. I found myself rewinding the action packed scenes for a second go-round. The effets themselves probably could have made up for an actors short-comings, unless of course the acting was of an extrodinarly low caliber, such as was the case with Reeves. <br />As I said I forced myself to give a 4 star rating. That is because the special effects were wonderful and the other actors and actresses have a fair amount of talent. The story line, although I wasn't convinced it could happen because there were to many open ends, was very orginal. If only it had undergone a little more development...
B00003CWL6|5.0|Most of us already know that.<BR>But why call this DVD &quot;The  Awards Edition&quot; when there are no others released?
0790737442|5.0|Of course sequels can be as good as the first, but it is very, very rare.  Not in this instance. The 1st movie was much, more serious that the 2nd, but that left more room for the 2nd to be more commical. I loved this movie, and the writers didn't stray too far from the original style of the first movie by giving it a lighter feel. It is still action packed, and full of suspense.  The characters were developed more fully, but remained easy to relate to. A must watch for Mel Gibson lovers and Danny Glover fans.
0783225849|5.0|The one and only PSYCHO! First of all, the shower scene isn't the scariest scene of the movie, and would future reviewers quit putting spoilers in their reviews. This is an incredible film, full of jolts, great suspense, and amazing acting. You just have to see this. Watch it alone in the dark!
6303269842|5.0|I enjoed this flick very much.  The cast was absolutely superb, and they had a charisma that couldn't be beat.  I laughed so hard, but was also sitting on the edge of my seat wondering what trouble happen to hinder the characters next.
6305137293|4.0|Well as you know, \\"You can't kill the boogeyman,\\" explains John Carpenter in Halloween, and to prove it he brings Michael Myers back in this handsome but grisly sequel. This isn't nearly as good as the first, but it is better than the third one. Jamie Lee Curtis returns as Laurie Strode but spends most of her time cowering in a hospital gown, and Donald Pleasence runs around like a maniac as the panicky doctor desperate to hunt down Myers before he kills again. Carpenter writes and produces with partner Debra Hill, and together they replace the mystery and uncertainty of the original with an exponentially bigger body count and some strange tales about the Druids and pagan ceremonies, and the now-familiar family ties between Michael and Laurie. That was original, but this doesn't have the suspense that the first had. Watch it alone in the dark.
6301208773|5.0|Bruce Willis has found a role that he can do well!  I enjoyed this film very much, and found its orginality and cast refreshing.  This film is action packed and entertaining through the end.
B0000029GA|5.0|Some of the past reviews have said that this cd lacks beats; I agree.  Although it isn't a \\"hits\\" album, Illmatic is a cd that grows on you after several listens.  At first, I hated it because no particular songs stood out.  However, after giving the cd several more listens, the lyrics started to sink in.  Nas is indeed one of the best lyrists (Tupac is the greatest), his rhymes are incredible and his flow is superb.  For those who like hip pop, this isn't for you.  For everyone else who want a cd that they'll listen for a long time, pick up Illmatic.  At the same time, I suggest Stillmatic (skip all of Nas' trash CDs between the two).  THis is rap at its purest.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Being on the coffee house circuit myself, I know it's very hard to create a sound that can get some recognition. Today's music has been nothing but punk/rap as of late. I welcome the popularization of someone who writes a song based on observations about life. John isn't writing stuff because it has a nice &quot;hook&quot;, he's making music that relates to everyones life. And furthermore, a real songwriter doesn't just write lyrics. They write the music that it's played to as well. That's John Mayer.

B00005JLS0|3.0|A rehash of the 1930s classic Adam's Rib which starred Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn, Two Weeks Notice revitalizes the formulaic romantic comedy mold through the energetic pairing of Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant without running into stereotypes that bogs down most films of the genre. Bullock stars as Lucy Kelson an ardent environmentalist who turned consultant for millionaire George Wade (Hugh Grant) on the condition that he preserves her community centre. The job soon proves arduous as Wade over-relies on her and she gives her two week notice, only to find herself falling in love with Wade. First-time director Marc Lawrence prudently sits back and lets the hearty comedian Bullock do her pratfalling while Hugh Grant charms effortlessly with his cavalier quips. Alicia Witt stars as the unscrupulous love-rival who gamely joins in this hilarious romp to make this an enjoyable fluff.
B000002513|5.0|The Wild,the Innocent, and the E-Street shuffle did not sell well enough to suit the Columbia Records boys.  After this one, he got it right in their eyes (and ears) when Born to Run hit the steets in '75, but E-Street Shuffle was a one of a kind masterpiece.  Friends who jumped on the Bruce bandwagon in the 80's and 90's, but never cared about his old stuff, are floored when they really LISTEN to this album.<BR>I agree with another reviewer that hearing New York City Serenade on tv would be a religious experience.  I believe it is one of the most underrated tunes ever recorded.<br />I've been listening to this album for almost (gak!) 30 years, and I never get tired of it - so much soul and sweet imagery... Sancious is masterful on the keyboards.  This is Bruce's biggest sleeper of them all.

B000067CPX|1.0|this cd is way too boring and soft rock for the founders modern punk rock. their old stuff is way better, the only good track was &quot;by the way&quot; which sadly was over-played by radio stations, don't waste your money.
0451207521|2.0|Not Ken Follet's best effort.  This book is basically a feminine reincarnation of The Dirty Dozen updated for political correctness.  It's a triple dip: strong woman versus evil man, politicians who are bigots and liars, and the drag queen with inner strength and beauty. Then, throw in some romantic tension...boy and girl, that girl and her husband, her husband and another girl, girl and girl, and the Nazi and the sweet hooker.  There are enough gays, lesbians and affairs in this book to keep Jerry Springer in material for a month.  I'm a Ken Follet fan but this one just doesn't measure up.  I felt as though the author was being condescending.
B000066AXC|3.0|I saw this movie in the theatre, and was very impressed.  Russell Crowe is a very talented actor, he proved that to in \\"Gladiator\\" back in 2000; yet it's a little off course from what John Nash's real life is about.<br />I looked into it more, and found out that John Nash was actually bi-sexual.  This is something that the movie never really hinted at all. I'm not to sure, now that I think about it, but that's pretty significant information that is being withheld.  I guess they omitted it to give us a better opinion of the character; at least that's what I came up with. Another thing that was left out was the fact that Nash eventually got divorced from his wife.  Which is no surprise, they almost made it seem in the movie as if his wife would leave him.  But it did allow the film to be more gratifying and uplifting.<br />I did like the movie; even if some key parts were left out to better the film's stature.  I mean, they do say: \\"BASED on a true story\\".  And I can only assume that the main message from John Nash's life story was covered.  On a much more positive note, the direction of the movie was outstanding.  Ron Howard gave us probably his best directing performance since 1995, when he released the blockbuster hit \\"Apollo 13\\".  And I think that's what made the film.  The director plays such an important role in the making of movies; more so than the actors most of the time.<br />This movie is very well done.  It has a great starring cast including Russell Crowe, Ed Harris and Jennifer Connelly.  And being the Awards Edition, you get a great feel for how the movie was made.  I'd recommend this film to anyone.  Anyone at all.  It's very good.
0553274503|5.0|I first had to read Flowers for Algernon as a school project, but as soon as I started to read the book, I was hooked. The story is beautifly written, despite all the spelling errors. <br />Flowers for Algernon takes place in New York, around 32-year-old Charlie Gordon. But Charlie is not ordinary, Charlie is mentaly disabled, with an IQ of 68. Despite his low intellegence, Charlie is happy with the way he lives his life. He goes to night school with the beloved teacher Ms. Kinnian. <br />But soon all this changes, when Ms. Kinnian, suggests that Charlie be part of an experimental surgury that is supposed to triple a person's intellegence. In spite of Charlie's low IQ, he qualifies for the experement. <br />The experiment dose increase Charlie's IQ to a level of beyound a genious. Soon Charlie becomes awhare of his position in life, and how he was always teased and taunted before the sugery. Yet is having a high IQ really all it is cracked up to be. With his increased IQ, Charlie also begins to learn the lesson of life. <br />This book is by far one of my favorites. The story is written in Charlie's point of veiw, and the author really gives the reader a peak at what Charlie thinks in his head. All the spelling errors, and grammar mistakes all add up to how Charlie's life changes with the surgery. After I read this book, it gave me a whole new out look. This book gave me an idea of just what mentaly challenged people think, and how they long to be like average people. To have the gift that most people take for granted. <br />This book is very heart warming and touching. I cried at the end of the book, and of how Charlie dose what he can, with his limitaions. This book is a wonderful read.
B00005ATQG|2.0|First of all I want to say that i really loved the book <BR>lolita.But when i saw the movie it was a big dissapoitment,<BR>and thats a shame for such a beautifull story, lets start <BR>with the main characteur 'lolita' of course, yeah sure<BR>sue lyon is a beautifull girl in the movie ,but lets face it<BR>she's just 2 old, she has 2 play a 12-year old, and whe all know<BR>how whe are when whe where 12 right?Her real age was fifteen!!<BR>allright i thought mabey she could play her part real good.<BR>But instead she plays the nymphet  of 12!!!, she acts<BR>like a grown-up not only that....she even looked older than her real age, in spite of that they diddn't want to shock the world<BR>with giving the part to a real 12-year old girl, i think it was better that they did!!!  IM 12 YEAR OLD MYSELF.if you want some advice from me watch lolita 1997 with jeremy irons.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|A brillantly directed and filmed, with a written script that could riddle the most elabrit of minds into confusion.  A ultimate trip on your senses, and a wild ride for your imadgination. The story surounds a teenage boy in his time of depression and finding out about life and change.  With a little twist in reality, a mistrious bunny aids him in finding out were time really go's.  Were the end of the world could be.
B00007BH5C|4.0|I purchased this CD for my husband and I should preface it by saying we are huge LOTR fans, both books and movie. My spouse has a passion for swelling, powerful soundtracks (his other favorite soundtracks include Braveheart and Gladiator), although I continue to be amazed at his ability to match the music with the exact movie scene. He also enjoys Enya and this combination of the two fits the bill nicely.<br />The only disappointment on this soundtrack, for both of us, is the inclusion of a vocal song that literally drips syrupy emotion. It detracts from the power of the music and the atmosphere of the movie.
B0000399WI|5.0|This movie begins in a way that is amazing in many ways. In growth with Friendship, Honor, Dignity, and Faith in the world.  A quiet buisness man (Tim Robbins) is thrown in a world of corrupt judicial courts. Accused of murding his wife wile haveing afair with another man. Starting his new life or ending his life in the Shawshank Penatentury. With all odd's against him, and betting inmates that he won't even make through his first night. He show's incredibal stregnth through out his journey in proving justice in the most coruppt of ways.  With incredable narration by Morgan Freeman he adds a earthy and knowledge that could pour out on the ground as thick as old pine sap on a hot July day.  In final note looking for a moment in a movie were all thing's are possible in the darkest of times, anythig is still possible.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is a masterpiece. Superb music, breathtaking photography and beautifully captured scenes. I can't praise this film enough. Don't waste your money on Koyaanisqatsi/Powaqqatsi. Baraka puts these to shame.
0316096199|5.0|The book Lucky, is a memoir about Alice Sebold. In the beginning, Alice describes a brutal rape in her freshman year of college. She went to her dorm room, told a friend and they went to the hospital. Alice underwent tests that would later help the police prosecute a criminal. She went home for the summer and returned back to school at Penn. State. She then ran into her Rapist on the street and called the police. They filed a law suit in which many people testified. <BR>Alice is able to look at her case impassively enough to see that she had many things going for her in achieving a conviction; Things that were a matter of chance, as it happens, but which allowed her to see it through in a way that someone of different circumstances might not have.  <BR>She amazingly, is able to portray herself, as \\"lucky\\" - lucky to be bright, well-spoken; lucky to have been wearing concealing rather than revealing clothes on the night of the rape; lucky to have had no sexual history to hold against her; lucky to be alive. <BR> Alice has a true talent for telling her story. And it is a story full of pain, healing, rage and sadness. She tells the story with such passion and such detail that it's hard to put down for five minutes. <BR>I would recommend this book to anyone who can stand to read a sad detailed account of a rape and the aftermath of one. Girl or boy, Man or Woman, this story is a sad but true story, a story that I think every one should read. I would give this book 5 out of 5 for its sad story, the sad story that will haunt you for the rest of your life.
B00003CXAY|2.0|The first time I saw Baraka, I fell in love with it. Mesmerising, haunting, beautifully filmed and a great soundtrack. I thought it was a one of a kind till I heard about Koyaanisqatsi. Reading all the reviews I purchased this together with Powaqqatsi. What a dissapointment! both these films fall drastically short of Baraka. I found the music nausiating and the photography irritating. I really don't know what all the other reviewers are on about. I guess it proves that we are all so different
B00006RIO7|5.0|I had absolutely no desire to see this movie, but my atitude towards it changed dramatically when my girlfriend dragged me to see it.  What a wonderfully amazing film!  The best movie I've seen in a year and the best time I've had at the movies in a long time!  Needless to say, the day after, I ran out and snagged the CD.  While I could do without the &quot;extra&quot; tracks featuring Queen Latifah, Lil Kim, Macy Gray, and Anastacia, I do really like the addition of the two bonus cuts of &quot;Class&quot; and &quot;I Move On&quot;.  Here's hoping that the cut &quot;Class&quot; number shows up on the DVD!
B00004T9VY|3.0|I used to love this album, but ever since the Cat converted to Islam and calling for the death of people with opinions that differed from him I've been unable to listen to it or any other CS album. What an incredible shame. He used to fill my heart with joy. Now my heart runs cold and fills with the hollowness of evil. <br />But if you live under a rock or can otherwise remain unaffected by the man's religion or politics, this album is beautiful.
B00005K9LK|4.0|I've been listening to this album since I was 8 years old.I'm 28 now and,unlike me,it hasn't aged one bit!Priest had some great stuff before this,but nobody could've seen this beauty coming.It is a true metal masterpiece,covering all moods with a heavy metal feel.Closed-minded people will miss out on a truly brillant effort by one of metal's godfathers!Unfortunately,Judas Priest has been going down hill ever since.But,there's only one way to go after releasing an album like this.
B00006RU5B|2.0|I bought this CD on the strength of the Cochise single.  I thought the powerful guitar and great singing would lead to a great album.  As it turns out, the singing is without any real surprises, nothing very melodic or musically interesting.  No twists, no turns.<br />The guitaring is powerful, but also dull.  A few cool tricks here and there, mostly in the 'cool noises' category, but nothing to make me perk up and listen carefully.<br />Also, I found the dynamics were flat and boring.  Since I wrote this originally, the music has grown on me (well 2 songs have).
B000002KIT|5.0|Music doesn't get any more masculine than this.From the lyrics to the brutal guitarwork,this album oozes testosterone.Lizzy was at the top of it's game right here and the double Les Paul attack of Scott Gorham and Brian Roberstson is just incredible.This album is so good that all of the versions here are better than the ones on the studio albums!It's so good even a guest appearance by Huey Lewis can't ruin it!
B00006V9A0|5.0|The punk ethos of late frontman Kurt Cobain still shines through post-mortem 'greatest hits' collection.<br />Admittedly skeptical when the radio announced new Nirvana material was going to be released after infamous legal battles between surviving members, Cobain's estate and the reccord company were cleared, I figured I could at least give it a shot.<br />The much-heralded one \\"new\\" track \\"You know you're right\\" features Cobain's morose vocals at their prime. Reccorded shortly before his 1994 death at the age of 27, this track's experimental musical arrangement adds to the tense enviroment promoted through the lyrics. Of course, Kurt ultimately left this world, the song now ironically sounding like communication from the great beyound.<br />Nirvana was never explicitly political in the sense of the Dead Kennedys, Bikini Kill, etc... but their frequent statements in the early 1990's in support of youth participation and political awareness against Bush the elder and his friends were a prominent fixture in news interviews. However difficult this participation might be, it was preferable to letting people you disagreed with walk all over you and continue to do whatever they wanted.<br />Now as junior makes plans to decimate the world in his own image, we can again hear the passionate doubt of Kurt Cobain throughout the song and be transported to a time when America was forced to admit youth revolution had never really disappeated and we would have to be listened to on our own terms.<br />Other tracks are live versions and B sides from Nirvana's other hit songs. Previously owning Incesticide, I nevertheless appreciate addition to my musical catalog because the beauty of a non-polished version comes from the organic nature of the finished product. Multiple performances of the same song will never be completely the same, and the different perspectives remind us the Washington state band was \\"Alternative\\" well befoe it simply became another demographic term for corporate music.rate music.
0393038912|4.0|I thought that this book really put a spin on the way that I viewed the world.  I was willing to accept the ideal of evolution but it never made so much sense to me until I read this book.  The ideas behind how societies developed really surprised me.  I did not expect it to be based so much on food production and animal domestication.  The thing that surprised me most about this book was that before the Europeans arrived there were no horses in America.  Finding out how people progress because of East West alignment as opposed to North South alignment made perfect sense to me.  I never knew how many people were killed off with the germs from other societies.  I was surprised by how many people were in the Americas and were killed off in order for the most immune race to survive.<br />I got a little dull near the end when he was talking about the New Guenea stuff but besides that it was an interesting read.
B00004XONN|5.0|This is probably radiohead's greatest work to date.  It is one of the most disturbing albums I have heard, but also one of the most amazing ones.  The story is of a persons journey from perfection to suicide.<br />The frustration starts in the opening song where it blurs into the repeated line &quot;What was that you tried to say?, tried to say?, tried to say?&quot;<br />The album has an emotional but detached feel to it.  A surpressed power as oppose to powerful strumming of guitars.  It is an interesting album both musically and psychologically.  The third song on the album seems chaotic and a mess but somehow makes sense musically.<br />This album has almost all types of music, but they are all in forms that i have not seen them in before.  It has been said that Kid A is the album where song structure was thrown to the wind.  I prefer to think of it as a revolution in song structure.<br />This is a must have album, i would take it over OK Computer any day.  Also have a listen to Amnesiac and The Bends.<br />This is not your average band, this is radiohead!
B000002UZ6|5.0|I love Tina Turner, she's an incredble singer who has everything, style, voice, rhythm and incredible legs.<BR>\\"Simply the best\\" is called one of the best years greatest hits albums.

6305076626|5.0|This movie is the best ever! I'm only 14 but I love the movie just as much as any fan who got to go at midnight and see it in full costume! Lucky people! I can't keep my love for the movie inside me. In school I sing and dance with my friends to the tunes of the movie. I've seen more times I can remember and I know it word for word. I'm starting a new generation of Rocky Horror lovers at my school in Connecticut. I love the message it sends, that you can be whoever you want to be and do whatever you want, make your dreams reality,DON'T DREAM IT , BE IT! It stands the test of time and will remain a cult classic forever!
B0000025ZF|1.0|Well, after listening to this album, now I know where Marylin Manson got his inspiration for the insipid \\"Antichrist Superstar\\". Waters has got to be the lamest, dumbest, most rediculous excuse for a \\"cult icon\\" ever. At times, I almost pity Rog. It's so easy to see that he's pretty much just an average joe blessed with exceptionally mediocre intelligence and little natural musical talent.<BR> The only reason to listen to this album is for the lyrics, as there is no musical substance to be found. And if all you want is to have lyrics recited to you, why not just get some good poetry on tape? .<BR> Seriously, Waters should just write a book filled with all of his \\"insights\\" and just get it out of his system.<BR> Don't even think about listening to waters other solo albums either, they're just as popouse and senseless as this on. All in all, the only solo Floyd matrial worth checking out is Syd Barrett's first solo album, \\"The Madcap Laughs\\".
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural will not be remembered alongside classic Pearl Jam grunge albums like Ten or Vs. It's better; second only to Yield as their best. I can understand why some people may not be enamoured with it; I didn't love it at first. Give it some time; it needs to grow on you. These aren't simple, radio-friendly pop songs, this a complex collection of diverse music that takes more than a spin or two to appreciate.<br />It starts with the traditional rocking PJ album openers, then moves on the jarring \\"Evacuation\\" which annoyed the hell out of me first, but I have since come to enjoy. \\"Light Years\\" is one of Pearl Jam's best. A mid-tempo ballad about the death of a close friend, it is a simple, beautiful song with a nice intro and outro.   Even the most jaded grunge fan would be hard-pressed to find fault with the rockers \\"Insignificance\\" and \\"Grievance,\\" both which feature some top-notch drumwork by Matt Cameron (this being his first outing with the band). The unsung hero of the band, Stone Gossard, shines with the songs he has written: the Middle Eastern sounding \\"Of the Girl,\\" the fantastic love song \\"Thin Air,\\" and one of the band's most underrated songs, \\"Rival,\\" a haunting song about the Columbine shooting with a delightfully eerie vocal double tracking, a very unusual guitar riff, and simple yet effective use of the piano. I don't know how to describe \\"Sleight of Hand.\\" It is so unlike anything you've ever heard, a fascinating, somewhat melancholy song. Then there is the brief ukelele ditty \\"Soon Forget\\" and \\"Parting Ways,\\" which ends things nicely.<br />I wouldn't recommend this as your first Pearl Jam album, but if you enjoyed No Code, Yield or Riot Act, I can't recommend this enough. If you claim to only enjoy their grunge stuff, give this a listen anyway. It's vastly different. Unlike many of their grunge contemporaries (coughNirvanacough), Pearl Jam dared to evolve. You may not love it at first, but give it some time, and you will be rewarded.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I did not particularly like the action, and I found the whole movie a bit gloomy, lacking some lustre, some glamour (even though the close-ups on the pupils of Mila Jovovich are interesting). This is partly due to the origin of the movie (a video-game). Apart from that, the story itself is original and interesting (the T-Virus, the Hive, etc.) and there is some suspense. This is probably not the best movie of Mila Jovovich.
B000085RTR|5.0|This band amazes me! Every time they somehow expand and achieve even greater songs! COTU is a fantastic song and I am sure from the reviews that Epica will be a classic. Thank you Kamelot for making such incredible music.
B00005JKCH|4.0|The story is very good, Kirsten Dunst is the perfect pretty girl next door (Marie-Jane, MJ), the fights and the special effects are great, the luxury arppatments beautiful ... it is a perfect action movie, and a simple one too,  so it seems to be intended for children as well as grownups (but there is sometimes quite a lot of violence and tension). The images are great, so is the soudtrack. However, I found the actors and the dialogues very unconvincing in several scenes (one of the dialogues between Peter and MJ is really dumb). That is not too serious though, because this movie is essentially an action movie, and there are plenty of excellent action scenes ; all the fights between Osborn and Peter-Spiderman are fabulous, especially the attack on the Roosevelt Island cable car. One of the interesting points of the story is the fact that many people wandered if Spiderman was doing good or evil, in spite of all his good actions... even the Police was against him in an incredible -but real- scene. Also interesting is the scene near the end when Osborn realizes that he is losing, he starts to lie to confuse Peter's mind (he tells him that he never wanted to harm him or MJ etc.). Altogether, this movie is really enjoyable.
B00007E8V4|5.0|this cd was much better than i thought it would be.  it is much heavier than toxicity, and the songs went well together.  a must-have for any s.o.a.d. fans.
B000063DI9|5.0|I've been a big Iron Maiden fan for about 5 years now. I had heard that this was an excellent album by Iron Maiden and I received it for Christmas.  When I put the cd in the stereo I was instantly amazed.  The opening song \\"Moonchild\\" with it's fast guitars, excellent vocals, and amazing solos is a metal masterpiece.  The Evil That Men Do is one of the absolute best songs Iron Maiden ever composed.  Can I Play With Madness has a humorous sound to it, while still sounding like great metal.  The title song is another one of their great epic songs, describing an interesting story and featuring great instrumental sequences. The Clairvoyant is in sound an upbeat song yet lyrically in depth.  Only The Good Die Young is fast and ends the album on excellent notes.  The other two songs, The Prophecy and Infinite Dreams are very good also with both songs being a little slower than the rest of the album for the most part but, still very good.  The use of synthesizers on this album was done very well.  Lyrically, I think this is one of Iron Maiden's most in-depth albums.  There's not one song on this album that I don't like.  The whole theme of the album revolving around the seventh son myth was a creative endeavor.  I definitely recommend this album to any metalhead or Iron Maiden fan.  If you can, get the enhanced CD version with the book containing artwork, photos,and tour notes plus the music videos, biography, and artwork and other features in the computer part of the CD.
0060278269|5.0|I have been a large fan of Garth Nix's writings, and I have only read 3 books of his in the Seventh Tower series, but the Sabriel, Lirael, Abhorsen books were absolutely amazing! The plot thickened with each book  and at the end you were left off with no other option but to jump in the car and speed over to grab the next book. After I had finished Sabriel I actually took a calender and counted the days untill the release of his next book. I deeply loved the series and how it was complicated with many things to remember and recall, how beginning charcaters, ones you would never suspect become the center of your high point in the book, I loved the way he wrote these books with such amazing dialouge and description of each and every movement. The interludes from accross the wall in Abhorsen were beautifully done and the ending made me drooling for more. Don't end the series Garth! We love it too much.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The realism of this series is amazing, and the acting is excellent.  I've read the book, Band of Brothers by Mr. Ambrose, and many incidents that were in the book appeared in the series, often word-for-word.<br />Great battle scenes, great emotion from the actors.  Very thought-provoking.
1573225517|5.0|Like many people, the narrator of High Fidelity is always looking for something better.  As a result, the protagonist Rob doesn't realize when he does have a good thing.  Breaking up with girlfriend Laura doesn't even initially faze his; among break-ups, it doesn't even make his top five.  But soon enough, he is a wreck.<br />His life after their break-up is both humorous and sad.  The best humor actually comes from his record shop where he and his employees have a chance to display their musical knowledge and snobbery; Rob probably insults every reader somehow with all the musicians he puts down but it is done with a light touch.<br />The story of Rob and Laura will never be mistaken for their Dick van Dyke show namesakes.  Their relationship is at best rocky, but Rob's efforts to become a better person, though awkward are refreshing.  Will there be a happily ever after?  Hornby is good at letting you know that such things are really rare, but there is at least the possibility.
020530902X|5.0|In honor of the great William Strunk, I will attempt to heed one of the basic rules of this little book and omit needless words. So, in brevity....<br />The Elements of Style should be mandatory reading for all who dare to pick up a pen or pencil or sit at a keyboard.<br />The rules are simple, clearly explained, and highly effective.<br />E.B. White has softened the otherwise harsh tone (incurred by the brevity) by adding some chapters at the end on style and such and by touching up Mr. Strunk's thoughts here and there. Excellent job.<br />Read this book, read Stephen King's On Writing, write about a million words of your own for practice, and you'll be good to go.<br />Was that brief enough, William?
B000002U8G|5.0|Meddle is a wonderful piece of mood music by an accomplished band.  Slow tempos, heavy guitar breaks, and exciting crescendos.  The fact is, the musical quality of the album is questionable.  It's organic nature and it's ability to move a rock listener to another place is not.  The member's of Pink Floyd would be the first to tell the public that their musical abilities at that time still left much room for improvement.  There are many greater musicians who cannot wring emotional response from a listener like Pink Floyd can.  <br />The classic song is the 23 minute long `Echoes'.  David Gilmour has noted in an interview that he recalls Nick Mason and Roger Waters drawing a chart of the emotions the song must evoke throughout it's progress.  The music is a talented example of what happens when 4 highly creative musicians get together with limited special effects capabilities of the times, and create music that was considered very cutting edge at the time.  <br />In the English college dorms of the early 70's, Pink Floyds Meddle and Mike Oldfields Tubular Bells were considered the ultimate in progressive music.  Best listened to with headphones and your favorite mind altering substance back then.  More than 30 years later, I still cannot listen to Meddle without being brought back to those days and the London scene.   To gain a full appreciation of Echoes on this album, it must be listened to in context with other Floyd offerings at the time.  Songs to listen to are `Saucer full of Secrets', `Heart of the Sun', `careful with that axes, Eugene', and the atom heart mother album.  Listen to live versions if you can.  The studio versions are somewhat clinical, and this goes for `echoes' on Meddle.  It's live versions are magical, if you can find them, and contain some great differences from the studio version of the song.   Pink Floyd had played this song live before it was done in the studio.  The same goes for `One of these Days'.  The first track of the album and a crowd favorite when played live.   The song is introduced with syncopated bass, and slide guitar with swelling Hammond and cymbals played backward. The effects are simple to do, the end result is stunning, and when the drums come crashing through half way into the song, musical Nirvana is realized.  Other cuts on the album are interesting and pleasing, `fearless' and St Tropez are quite pleasing, but I cannot stand `seamus' and the barking dog.  I'm sure it was fun to make, but it's novelty wore off a long time ago.  Meddle was the album released just before Dark Side of the Moon.  I consider Meddle the last of the experimental albums, before pure studio artistry, excellent lyrics, and musicianship  took over in Dark Side.   It's easy to follow the musical progression of the band from atom Heart Mother, to Meddle, to Dark Side and on through to the Wall.  <br />I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have.  I still listen to it often, but I do prefer live versions of the main songs.  It's reassuring to pick out the mis-cues, and catch the band recover in mid break.  It show's they're human.
B00004XPP0|5.0|I don't need to describe what the Star Wars Trilogy is, if your a Star Wars Fan, you KNOW what it is... THE BEST, period.<br />But, I'm just hoping and waiting for the DVD version, since I'm playing this VHS's over and over, guess the tape will fail one of this days....
B000002UJQ|5.0|With 1005 reviews of this album before me, I doubt I can add anything other than my personal thumbs up to this album.  My brother played this for me the first time, and while he was singing along with every song, I wasn't so sure about it.  I eventually found a used copy and decided to give it a chance (you have a month before you have to return it).  Lucky me, lucky, lucky me.  If paranoid android isn't the most phenomenal song in my collection, combining so many great properties, I don't know what is.  (Maybe some alltime classic like &quot;Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad,&quot; but that's a whole other category which doesn't belong in comparison.)  The soundscape of this album is so rich and so beautiful, that I don't know how you could not be absolutely captivated by it.  Simply put, an essential for any music fan anywhere.
B000069AUI|5.0|To me, the true test of a perfect album is if you can press the play button on your CD player, kick back, relax, and not once think of pressing that skip button to go on to the next track.  It's got to put you in a mood where you feel like you're on top of the world, and you can relate to every single word out of the singer's mouth.  And then when the CD stops playing, you desperately want to press play again and start the amazing musical journey all over again.  That is, by my definition, the perfect album, and Coldplay's 2002 release, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is about as close to perfect as I've ever heard.  It almost satisfies every single one of my requirements for a perfect CD.  The lyrics and instrumentals are profound and uplifting.  The album flows from song to song effortlessly; never once is its sound redundant or overused.  You can just feel the emotion in each and every song, with each and every guitar note, every drum beat, and every vocal.  It would be utterly flawless... were it not for Track #9 (A Whisper).  It's not that \\"A Whisper\\" is a bad song...it's just not quite in the same league as all the others.  In Whisper, I find every so often that sole flaw with the album ... that longing to press the skip button, even if only a momentary thought.  Nevertheless, \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" is to date easily the best [$$$] investment in the music industry.  While I consider all the songs on the album tremendous (with the exception of \\"A Whisper\\"), if I had to highlight a handful of songs on the album, they would be In My Place, Clocks, A Warning Sign, and Green Eyes.  \\"In My Place\\" and \\"Clocks\\" are the two singles currently playing in the US and are some of the finest (if not the finest) and most inventive songs from 2002.  However, \\"A Warning Sign\\" and \\"Green Eyes\\" manage to steal the show by revealing an even softer, more intimate side of Coldplay that leaves you wanting to repeat them over and over again until your CD player batteries run out.As an aside, I encourage all big-time Coldplay fans to see them live on their current tour if you have the opportunity, regardless of the cost.  I saw them recently in St. Louis and they were even better than on the album, if that is even imaginable.  Look for a new album later this year or early next year...and if it sounds anything like the sampling of new songs being played on their current tour, it may even top their first two.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I love this movie when I saw it in the theaters and so did everyone I took with me. Spirited Away was playing in a select number of cities and theaters so when I saw a poster for it I jumped at the chance. I went to go see it in Japanese the first few times and all the otakus were there. The whole place was packed with adults who had Japanese dates of were wearing anime t-shirts. When I went to see it in English, however, there were kids that were 8 yrs old and below... mostly in the range age of 4-6. That was really bad. The first 30 min into the movie kids started to cry and go out of the theaters and start to talk. By the time the movie was over more than half the theater was empty. Now that might have been a freak event but I would not recomend this movies to yongsters...I dont think the little girls want to see a wolf-dragon snarling blood or a black ethareal body with a mask stare at an equally scared girl... So dont watch it with the kids watch it for yourself. Five stars for anyone 7 and up... dont let the young (5 and below) watch it because it might scare them!
0307203204|5.0|I grew up on this book, and I loved it.  It says that everything is possible for a child with imagination.  \\"I can be anything--that's my way.\\"  (That's from memory.)  Now that I've found it again,I'm getting copies for my niece and nephews--and one for myself!
0316666343|4.0|I originally picked this up skeptical of the fantastical narrative device.  I was quickly assured that this was no gimmick, that the narrator was in fact serious, and had a beautiful story to tell.  It is amazing how Sebold was able to tell you so much about each character she introduces, fleshing them out from the inside out (as the title might suggest).  It is a book about family, love, and the endurance of the spirit like none I have read before.  <BR>There is, however, an abrupt and convenient ending which I believe contradicts the contract established between the reader and the narrator.  I was unable to take that leap with the narrator, and would have preferred a more literal than fantastical end.
B0000640VO|1.0|Now I am ready for beddy bye. I gave it 45 minutes of my time. I was bored from the start. Very odd movie. One of the first irritating things about the movie was the constant narration. I suppose the movie is supposed to be funny. I did not laugh! <br />I did not find anything enjoyable about the film. I also could not watch the Royal Tennenbaums. Although the stories are different the films both have the narration and odd characters. Just not my thing I guess!
B00007G207|5.0|The extended DVD version has been released in some countries for many months. For those who loved the original theatrical release, this extended one is a MUST. See for yourself.
1878424319|5.0|This book is full of insight and inspiration. It is very easy to read and I found it to be particularly helpful in encouraging personal growth and awareness.
B00004WEJZ|2.0|I was really disappointed by this movie.  In my opinion, it is the worst James Bond movie ever made.  It is a remake of an earlier Sean Connery movie, Thunderball, which is a far, far superior 007 movie.  This movie has an overall bland feeling to it because no one really seemed to care when making it.  Connery was great as James Bond in the 1960s, but in this movie, he is much too old for the part.  And since the movie was not made by MGM/UA, you don't get the usual actors portraying Q or M.  I really don't think I'll watch this movie again.  Stick with the original Sean Connery or Roger Moore James Bond movies.
B00000IONU|4.0|I believe most know the white stripes for thier most recent work on white blood cells. I belive that album to be the best album of my very short lifetime.This album is not closely related to white blood cells. People call them a garage band and this is their most garadge band-like material. So if you were not a fan of thier single \\"we are gonna be friends\\" but you liked expecting or dead leaves, this is for you.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is a most wonderful movie. <br />Capturing the energy, vitality and spriteliness of an enchanting young lady, the movie flies through a determined search for a fellow who just might be... well... the love of her life. But how does she know for sure? And how does she communicate this? In her own wonderfully quirky way, that's how.<br />The movie is surprising, and uses an interesting method to push the plot along. You really do have to see it, but the use of imagery, photos, and artistic games lures both of these characters to one another. The test is in whether the fellow will understand her manner, and she's convinced of it because she thinks that she understands his obsession with getting passport photos from booths all over subway stations.<br />The movie is playful in such a charming way. Sold from beginning to end. The result is a feeling of warmth, and a smile is just bound to creep all over your face.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this cd without knowing very much about the artist.I can honestly say this could possibly be added to my all time top 10 list of favorites.It is the best new music I've heard in a long time. Norah Jones vocals are sensuous,original and she has definately created her own style.
6300214370|4.0|Footloose is a rock rebellion story about a big city kid (Kevin Bacon) who moves into a deeply religious small community that has banned all manner of things, like rock and roll and dancing. Bacon's character is determined to change peoples minds about the 'dangers' of rock music and gyrations of the body.<br />The movie is rich and paradigmatic of the rebellious teen genre. Handsome people, great music, impatient screen shots, and a plot that includes some dynamism and general excitement.<br />There are two trouble spots, however. For one, I can't quite understand why Kevin Bacon's character falls for the preacher's daughter. Shy of any redeemable character traits, she is a crass, rude, obnoxious, and terribly immature young lady.<br />Agreed, she has a troubled life, and throughout the movie you do get hints of what she may be like in the future. There is clearly a sense that she will stop living through the rebellion of others, and will grow as a person. Nevertheless, other than her beauty, it is difficult to understand why Bacon's character falls for her.<br />The other trouble is with the big defense scene, where a case is made for allowing the teens to have a prom dance party. The defense is structured entirely out of a biblical perspective--since they danced to celebrate and give thanks to God, so, too, should the kids be allowed to celebrate by dancing. This is smart because the town is a Bible-thumping town, but the writers could have added a defense of dancing on grounds other than religious (freedom of expression, for instance).<br />Other than that, the movie is fabulous. Great dance scenes, and music that still inspires and is catchy many years later. I especially enjoyed the portrayal of the preacher in the movie as dynamic, rather than as a stale caricature of the small-minded, small town preacher cliche depicted in many other movies. His eventual tolerance, if not acceptance, of rock &amp; roll dancing was endearing and appropriate.<br />Overall, themovie is worth a look.
0553274503|4.0|Flowers For Algernon is a very powerful book about a mentally challenged man named Charlie.  Charlie had dreamed of being smart his whole life.  Charlie's dream came true when scientists from a university selected him for an experimental operation.  After the operation his intelligence increased greatly and a whole new world opened up to him.  He explores the wonders and the horrors of a world that has just been opened up to him.  He found the hardships and the qualities of a regular life.  The ending is surprising and sad but it makes you appreciate your life more.  I liked this book because of the ending and if you don't read it you're missing out on a great story.
B00005B36H|5.0|The title of this review implies the two words that, I believe, best describe Lateralus, Tool's most recent music on offer; compelling, and complex.<br />Lateralus is compelling because of its rhythmic beauty. Each song builds on a spiritual base at the core of Tool's musical offerings. That spiritual base is made more palpable by what appear to be musical essays on spirituality, and epistemology.<br />The claim Keenan seems to make is that we can come to know things in more than merely a conventional, and sense-oriented way. Think of lyrics like \\"prying open my third eye\\" and the sonic dissonance that accompanies the song (from Aenima). And the bands comments about drug use and alternate states as methods of \\"coming to know\\" things. <br />Personally I think the content of their philosophy is foul nonsense (assuming my analysis is correct and strictly with respect to epistemology) unless they mean things metaphorically or poetically. Still, the essence and presentation of the philosophy is completely enchanting. The combination of musical experimentation and lyrical richness produces this compelling outcome.<br />Complexity is also made plain. Tool is, in my mind, the classical music of a contemporary generation. It is richly layered, methodic, subtle and overwhelming. Stark beauty and barefaced shame, distortion and ugliness. A good listen will reveal new insights each and every time.<br />Couple this with Keenan's lyrical and singing abilities and you have a recipe for a singularly profound musical masterpiece. Lateralus is just that.
0151008116|4.0|First of all, when Pi begins his castaway journey I couldn't put the book down.  The description, the terror, the combination of the various elements interacting with each other was brilliantly done.  I had slowly chugged my way through the opening section, with Pi Patel's life in Pondicherry India as the son of a zookeeper; his observations of how animals are no freer in the wild than they are in zoos, and Pi's flirtations with three religions at the same time.  At this point, it seemed too typical of recent novels, heavy on the philosophy and analysis but lacking in narrative and flow.  This all changed when Pi became a castaway at sea.<br />No spoilers here; I was glad I knew next to nothing about what this book was about before I read it, because it is quite the reading experience.  Others are welcome to decipher all of the symbolism, but to Martel's credit he doesn't make it heavy-handed for those who just want to read for pleasure.  For those who enjoy magical symbolism though, there is plenty here for you.  The mysterious island still has me thinking.
B00004Z400|5.0|The White Pony is an essential album. Complex and rhythmic, deeply disturbing, and enchantingly melodic. <br />Initially, the album disturbs and almost irritates. The beats are not quite right (are they?), the tempo is not like others (what tempo?), the sway and mood is off-kilter (it is?), and the rhythm takes getting used to (it does?). Then you sink into it, and you're surrounded. <br />Pony's highlight is its moroseness. The album, taken as a whole, has the character of producing a thoughtful ambience, punctured by trepidation and hesitancy. You're in the thick of it.<br />There is a story in the album, of this I'm sure, but what overwhelms me is the confusion and incoherence that doesn't manage to frustrate. Instead, you can't help but enjoy the confusion of lyrics that make sense only in retrospect, and the Deftones' particular manner of producing, layering, and structuring sound (and it is particular).<br />Of note is the song with Tool frontman Keenan, a track that immediately compels and enchants but, even after a few listens, does not lose its appeal.<br />This album is stunning, but requires more than a superficial listen. Recommended.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This album is awesome.. Flaming Lips still manage to take you to that floating level.  This album shows that they're progressing and and still have the same focus in their music.  Shows they're poppy Beatles influence but also a range of other things that mix in to form that surreal Flaming Lips sound.  Great album, Highly recommended.
0226264211|5.0|In the tradition of Hayek, Friedman's Capitalism and Freedom attempts to make plain the concern we should have with centralized power. Although it is rather compact, much like the Road to Serfdom, and lacks the comprehensiveness of a Free to Choose (also by Milton and Rose Friedman) it still comes across rather forcefully. <br />His attention to principle, and his ability to come to logical conclusions is remarkable. This approach can have drawbacks (for instance, ignoring the consequences of policy for philosophical consistency), but it is important to bring out our assumptions, and correct mistakes. <br />To give an example from a conversation I had with Friedman, what difference is there between being able to \\"ingest\\" the books that you'd like, and being allowed to ingest mind-altering drugs? (There is a difference, of course, but *essentially* we are dealing with things that can alter the content of your mind). <br />I gave the book five stars because I welcome such analysis and believe the book to have achieved what it set out to do (at varying points in the book Friedman would point out that this book is not meant to be 'thorough' in the sense of a complete exposition and refers the reader to alternate books for further discussion). A must read for all politicians and government types alike (whether in Canada or abroad).
B00005MP58|5.0|This has to be one of the best period drama.  It is a relatively faithful adaptation of Austen's novel.  The cast was excellent, the leading actor and actress were near perfect.  I appreciated tremendously the preservation of the original dialogues and the beautiful music.  And look at the costumes and the dances!  But other reviewers have said enough about the merits, now I will pick nits.<br />1) The ending was a little too explicit, and contradictory to the subtlety of the entire series (and the book).  Who needs to see the actual wedding?  I laughed out loud here...<br />2) Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's intelligence and dignity was not shown at all in the series.  Darcy respected them not only because he wanted to show Lizzy that her reproofs (false pride, for one) had been attended to, but also because the Gardiners were indeed very respectable people!<br />3) I'd like it better if the adaptation kept more of the dialogues between Lizzy and Darcy at the end of the movie, if they had time to ellaborate how their feelings towards each other changed, the impact of Darcy's letter, etc.  The book had very nice dialogues here.<br />4) The wet shirt scene, although extremely cute, is perhaps unnecessary.  Lots of viewers who respect this movie are not those who look for \\"sexy\\" scenes.  This scene, therefore, is a little bit, only a little bit, cheap.<br />But I still give the movie 5 stars because its overall achievement is great.
B00006879E|1.0|I went out and bought \\"Songs About Jane\\" based upon online reviews and the impression \\"Harder to Breathe\\" made upon me. I am music lover of varied styles and genres, but I must agree with several reviews that this album to closely resembles 'pop, boy band music'. Do not take the single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" as a good indicator to the sound of the entire album. From the second track the album becomes a soft, generic sound of funk beats and groove rock. The lyrics are nothing to speak of, and the vocals began to get under my skin.  If you like \\"Harder to Breathe\\", and you are still intrigued, then buy a used copy, for I am sure there will be no short supply. I have already traded my copy.
B000002U8A|4.0|Duran Duran's debut was remarkable. Rio was phenomenal. Between the two, I'm hard-pressed to pick the best. Both albums were filled with cohesive songs and there were no weak filler elements. Seven And The Ragged Tiger does however suffer from that problem. Two songs in particular bring this album down: '(I'm Looking For) Cracks In The Pavement' and 'I Take The Dice.'<br />With them, this album is about ***1/2 worthy. Delete them altogether and the album is a solid ****+. Replace them with, in this order, 1983's 'Is There Something I Should Know?' and 1984's 'Wild Boys' and this is a five star album all the way. <br />Don't think things like that should be done? Consider the fact that 'Is There Something I Should Know?' came out the same year as Seven And The Ragged Tiger but was put on the re-release of the 1981 debut album in place of the track 'To The Shore.' 'Is There Something I Should Know?' doesn't entirely fit the feel of the first album. It does fit particularly well with the likes of 'Union of the Snake' however. And since Duran Duran history has proven with 'To The Shore' that it is possible to delete a track altogether and replace it with a later track, go ahead and put 'Wild Boys' on there. It goes remarkably well with 'The Reflex.' Want to make Seven And The Ragged Tiger a 6 star album? Add 'A View To A Kill' in after 'Wild Boys.'<br />But to be fair, the debut Duran Duran album and Rio are two of the best albums of the era. Seven And The Ragged Tiger was Duran Duran competing with themselves and losing to a degree. Seven And The Ragged Tiger is a great album with two of the best Duran Duran singles ever (The Reflex and New Moon On Monday) and a couple of choice album cuts (Tiger Tiger and The 7th Stranger) that harken back to the darker, moodier elements of their debut (Nightboat, Friends of Mine and Tel Aviv). <br />Then there is the quite solid and required single 'Union of the Snake' and very enjoyable 'Of Crime and Passion' and 'Shadows on Your Side' which are comparable to likes of 'New Religion' and 'Anyone Out There,' impeccable and single-worthy. <br />If you are going to buy Duran Duran albums, you MUST BUY the first three, it's just that Seven And the Ragged Tiger is the weakest among them for the two problem songs alone. If you can look past those two songs, you will enjoy this album much, much more.
B00005B36H|5.0|Ever since I heard AENIMA on the radio, I liked tool... but ever since I got my hands on the album, I've been hooked.  And not because it was good music... because it was GREAT imagery that inspired thought.  I listened to that album constantly for years, and it NEVER lost any of it's slimy touch on my brain.<br />Of course, I also thought that there was no way we'd ever recieve an experience this deep again.  Lateralus came out, and I grabbed my copy right away.  I had doubts.  Plugged it in and... WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???<br />It was a possitive one though... I could never have imagined anyone being able to make up such a complex... complex... I'm not even sure what you'd call it.  It can't be &quot;music&quot; by what people term music as... it is so much more.  You have to throw everything you know about music in any way out the window to begin to understand what you have here... the most psychologically impresive album ever.  I couldn't say that pink floyd had anywhere near the vision of LATERALUS.<br />But this is all my opinion.  Have fun with it.  If it doesn't catch on to you (because you cannot catch on to it) then you will never know what you are missing.
B00006AW2G|5.0|For all practical purposes, this album could be considered Keith Richards' first solo album. Most of it was recorded while Mick Jagger was busy filming bedroom scenes with Keith's girlfiend in the movie \\"Performance\\". Brian Jones had already become a has-been that never-was. Of course Bill and Charlie took their orders from the Glimmer Twins. While one twin's away....Keith layered and layered guitars to the point producer Jimmy Miller was screaming \\"overkill\\". Of course all Stones appear for the final product, but it is Keith Richards' intricate playing of both acoustic and electric guitars that is fabulously displayed here. One must also remember the ages (26-25, Jagger/Richards) of these fellows with the intelligent (sometimes macabre') lyrics. Classic dirty-boy blues with a horrific bend (\\"Midnight Rambler\\"); Old classic down-south blues (\\"Love In Vain\\"); The great country version of \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\" (\\"Country Honk\\"); Heartbreak (\\"You Got The Silver\\"); End-of-World ideas (\\"Gimme Shelter\\"); Classic suburban radio choir sing-a-long (\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"); and the brilliantly guitar-layered (\\"Monkey Man\\"). Then there is sheer nastiness (\\"Live With Me\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\"). What is remarkable is this album was released AFTER the '69 tour and Altamont. So a lot of these songs were performed before being released publicly. In fact, the Stones were in post-production of this album in Los Angeles (October '69) just before the tour kicked off (also October '69). Eerie indeed. A great companion piece for this album is the Stanley Booth first-hand account titled \\"The True Adventures of The Rolling Stones\\". This is the 2nd best Stones album (ie, Exile). Of course this is one fan's opinion.
B000069HKH|4.0|READ THIS PLEASE!!<br />The Rising is the album plugged as a \\"9/11\\" tribute. A stirring, emotional take on feelings from the September 11th tragedy that stirred Bruce to write a few songs about those feelings. Feelings he felt, his family and friends felt, and his country felt.<br />It has been a year and a half since the events, and it has been 7 months or so since the release of the album. <br />I listened to it a few times when i first got it. i was compelled, but put it aside, in retrospect, puting aside feelings i had had about the events in september. I instead listened to other boss records. studied his career. his life. i got it back out and imediately decided the album was good. stirring even emotionally charged at times. but again i put it aside.<br />The last week in January 2003, i visited manhattan. I am from California. Upon entering the city, i put on New York City Serenade, from his second album The Wild The Innocent and The Estreet Shuffle. It went perfectly, almost like a movie soundtrack. It wasn't until seeing faces of new yorkers, faces of americans that actually seemed still so effected by 9/11, but were coping. <br />That was when i got The Rising back out of my cd case, and listed to it. continuously.<br />The Rising is a beautiful and stirring album, end of story. And what makes it more beautiful is that it is done by Bruce Springsteen, a man who is affected by America, and doesn't put aside his feelings or emotions from things that happen in america. Instead, he writes powerful pieces of music.<br />The album is like this:<BR>Lonesome Day is a hit-you-hard-in-the-guts type of rock ballad. It speaks the message, hey my day is lonesome, and alot of stuff does suck, but i'm ok with that because i'll get past it some other lonesome day.<br />Into the Fire is poetic and heartfelt, at first listen perhaps corny, but it grows on you, until you find yourself getting teary eyed. <br />Waiting On A Sunny Day is a feel good, Hungry Heart type song. Itis has a singalong chorus and beat that speaks volumes, even if it is simple.<br />Nothing Man is moody, dark and brooding, emotinal and tragic. Reminds me of stuff from his Streets of Philadelphia period. Lyrics are a gem.<br />The next two songs I tend to skip. I kind of don't like Countin' On A miracle. But Empty Sky is heartfelt as well, but sometimes tends to sound repetitive.<br />Worlds Apart is also haunting, but because of the ironic cultural twist it plays on. Booming.<br />Lets Be Friends is dismissable, but after a few listens, and giving the track a chance, i actually like the song. It seems to play out like a fun backyard party. Cheesy, but it gets to you after a while, and makes you wanna dance and clap. I especially like the duet with the younger girl, and the feel good do, do, do, do, do, parts. Clemmons shines on the Sax. Corny but still very much Bruce.<br />Further On (Up The Road) is fist pumping and eerie. Very Rock, VEry Roll.<br />The Fuse has become a favorite track. extra points for studio production. <br />Marys Place is like Rosalita, without the classic tinge. But still fun.<br />Your Missing is haunting, eerie, and tearful.<br />The Rising is a song like born in the USA, which gives you somewhat an assured energy. Stirring, poetic, and sing songy.<br />Paradise as well is haunting and reminds me of Nebraska and Ghost of Tom Joad era songs.<br />The final track, My City Of Ruins, is fantastic, and fits perfectly.<br />What needs to be reminded is the feelings you felt on that day. The anguish and emotion. Let those feelings come to you. Get in your mind pictures of a scarred america, of a scarred american public, and let these songs be your soundtrack.<br />I am a [person who] loves music. and I love Mr Springsteen, with out a doubt, seven months later, the best mainstream album of 2002.
B00005B4GU|4.0|The mood of this album is the logical progression for Radiohead.<BR>Though Pablo Honey was serious, and slightly doleful at times, The Bends was introspective, earnest and bittersweet, OK Computer was mournful, mysterious and melancholy, Kid A was experimental, sorrowful and dissonant, Amnesiac is downright dark, cacophonic and unpredictable.<br />Because Kid A and Amnesiac were recorded around the same time, the similarities are evident.  However, I think it's safe to say that Radiohead didn't just choose the songs at random.  Where Kid A delved into textured, electronic soundscapes, lacking melody and direction, it had more conventional songs to outweigh that imbalance.  Amnesiac contains only a few &quot;normal&quot; songs, and a bunch of strange ones.  Even the &quot;normal&quot; ones, like Knives Out and Pyramid song are depressingly downbeat.  The techno-to-pop ratio on this cd is much greater than it was on OK Computer, which makes the album even less accessible.<br />Where Amnesiac isn't droning on with slow, melancholy melodies, it seems to focus more on gritty, raucous ambiance and atmosphere.  &quot;Hunting Bears&quot; and &quot;Pull/Pulk Revolving Doors&quot; are a couple prime examples of this.   <br />Then, of course, they sometimes combine the two, like on the startling opener &quot;Packt Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box&quot; and the brilliant finale &quot;Life in a Glass House.&quot;  <br />All in all the cd is worth picking up, if you're actually willing to accept the fact that there are several songs on here that you most likely will not like.  There are also several which you probably will like, but the ratio isn't necessarily even, nor is it definite.  Where the cd isn't breath-takingly beautiful, it's interesting, at least.
B00006LSM3|5.0|I was totally suprised when I first heard my copy of \\"Brainwashed.\\" Being a posthumus release I wasn't expecting the album to be a proper representation of the last music of George's life. However, once again, George suprised me with his strength, diginity, and style.  I can't believe how lifelike and positive this album is given the fact that George was dying while he was putting it on tape. Like \\"Cloud 9,\\" and the mighty \\"All Things Must Pass,\\" this is a cohesive album all the way through. Good from the get go, with \\"Any Road,\\" the album seems to naturally ascend through each song until \\"Marwa Blues.\\" Like an Indian raga, the instrumental \\"Marwa Blues,\\" is hauntingly beautiful. It's feel and structure seems to bring the album to a higher plane, and then it just keeps getting better with \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud.\\" The final title track, is a final reminder of the dead end road of the \\"Material World,\\" and George ends the album with a touching chant accompanied by the Tabla. George was a honest, positive voice in a corrupt and negative world, and while other albums (or product) will come and go, this album will continue to grow like an evergreen.
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is the long-awaited sophomore LP by Christina Aguilera. It's really worth the wait because this album really shows her talents and her songwriting skills. The songs are very meaningful in terms of giving a useful message to the masses. The lead off single is practically the only song that is totally different lyrically from the rest of the 19 tracks.<br />The album chronicles the life of Miss Aguilera herself and the important message that you always need to believe in yourself and not to listen to anybody else who try to bring you down. Each song has its strength and power to captivate you when you listen to them. Most of the tracks are produced by Scott Storch and Linda Perry. Christina co-wrote all the songs except for Beautiful and Impossible which are produced and written by Linda Perry and the talented Miss Alicia Keys respectively.<br />The stand-out tracks in this record include Beautiful, Infatuation, Dirrty, Walk Away, Impossible, Loving Me 4 Me and I'm Ok. I liked almost all the songs excluding Underappreciated and Make Over. Christina's amazing vocal virtuosity is clearly displayed in this record. Her Latin influences are reflected in Infatuation. The latter song is a potential single in my opinion. Loving Me 4 Me is reminiscent of the songs that Mariah Carey would actually sing in the past. I'm Ok is another amazing song produced by Linda Perry. Can't Hold Us Down featuring Lil' Kim is one of the kick ... songs. Others include Fighter, Soar (look out for that high note) and Dirrty. However, Christina excels in her ballads (unlike some other artist who can't sing ballads because of their weak voice). `You listening Jenny?'<br />My all time favorite track is the current hit Beautiful. The message is so strong that it's becoming her theme song (and mine as well). I'm sure this song is clearly reaching out to all those who feel insecure about themselves. `You are beautiful / No matter what they say / Words can't bring you down...'<br />In conclusion, this album is a must have even though you aren't a Christina fan (I ain't ). I was driven to get this album as I realize the songs have an impact on me. She is truly an amazing vocalist. You won't regret buying it. Trust me.
B000050FEN|5.0|Stunningly morbid, Fincher's \\"Se7en\\" is a morose and disturbing flick without senselessness.<br />The plot is rich and textured. On the basis of the seven deadly sins, a serial killer plays out each sin in detail. Murder is the method, gluttony, greed, lust, envy and so on are each the subject matter, and apparent societal depravity is the canvas. Two police officers, a rookie detective, and a seasoned veteran, are left to put the pieces together and to try and stop the massacres from unfolding.<br />A deeply disturbing, and downright frightening, movie, \\"Se7en\\" accomplishes the purpose of this genre in a surprising and intelligent way. Both Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are exceptionally cast in roles each of them excel in, while Kevin Spacey's portrayal is nothing short of chilling.<br />The movie manages to surround you in a sense of morbidness. The rich texture (from, I've heard, the use of an innovative lens that alters the general colour of the movie) elicits a frightening calm, and a certain pitch and level of anticipation that captures the intent of the movie.<br />If you like this genre, \\"se7en\\" is worth more than a cursory look. Highly recommended.
0060930187|5.0|Lorna Lindquist<BR>bamalorna@hotmail.com<br />Looking at what's under the glass<br />A review of Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar<br /> While reading Plath can be muddied by all the \\"Plath baggage\\" that history has shown us, I think that coming to and away from this book with an open mind will help the reader enjoy it as much as I did. Plath's untimely end is not a mystery to the current reader, but to expect this book to be depressing insults the message that Plath tries to convey.<BR> The main character, Esther Greenwood, obviously suffers from a chronic depressive disorder. She constantly thinks to herself that she should be happy. She looks objectively at her sadness and explores it as though it is simply a bad habit. Greenwood comments again and again that she knows she should be excited about her fortunes in life.<BR> These fortunes mimic the fortunes that Plath herself enjoyed as a young writer. She was published early and had early success, but still her life felt blank enough for her to stick her head in the oven before she turned 30. I think that in this way, The Bell Jar is a thinly veiled autobiography. I also think that she wrote this in third person not so that her personal life could be kept hidden, but so that the examinations of depression could gain a sort of validity by being removed from the author and her stigma.<BR> One farce of depression that Plath destroys in Greenwood is the cliché that all depressed people simply lay around feeling sorry for themselves all day. In fact, Plath suggests that people who are depressed know that there is a problem with themselves, but lack the ambition to root it and solve it because even life as a whole has lost its luster. <BR> As a work, message removed, Plath's talent as a poet comes shining through. She uses phrases that so accurately describe Greenwood's situation that you feel like you can see her thoughts. She uses childish language that indicates the childish tone Plath thinks that life has to offer. She constantly says that things are \\"stupid\\" she is \\"stupid\\" others are \\"stupid.\\" <BR> Overall I think that The Bell Jar offers more to the reader than a simple story to read about what appears to be a \\"crazy girl,\\" it offers instead excellent insight made by a talented writer.
B000088E6M|5.0|First off let me say that this is pretty much the best rap cd i have ever heard.  This ranks up with the classic albums of NWA, 2pac, and biggie.  <br />Every song is quality.  no filler.<br />My personall favorites are patiently waiting, blood hound, Like my style, 21 questions, and dont push me.  <br />This cd carries the style of the old 50 cds, but with a more polished sound.  DEFinitely a must buy for rap fans.
B000088E6M|5.0|50's major label debut is going to prove one of the hottest albums of 2003.  From the sweet beat and lyrics to \\"What Up Gangsta\\" thru the Eminem-blessed \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Don't Push Me\\", from the hot single \\"In Da Club\\" to the Murder Inc diss \\"Back Down\\", 50 is beginning to affirm himself as one of the smoothest rappers in the game.  The production collaboration of Dr. Dre and Eminem proves quite prolific, and I'm definetely looking forward to another production project by these two.  The album features great guest spots by G-Unit soldiers Young Buck, Tony Yayo, and Lloyd Banks on 3 different songs as well.  The bonus tracks \\"Wanksta\\", \\"U Not Like Me\\", and \\"Life on the Line\\" are an excellent ending to a classic album.  Get this!
B00004YRQA|5.0|You really can't go wrong with buying this. You will need a memory card for almost every game on the PS2. 8 Megs is enough for almost every game, with the exception of sports games. Sports games can take over 2 Megs each, so you will need more than one card. But for most other games 1 card will be enought, at least to begin with. Most of my games are less than 350 kilobytes. Other companies have larger cards, but they are not as safe as the Sony card. I have never heard of anyone having a Sony card corrupt thier game data, while many people have lost data on 3rd party cards.

I was almost expecting a Dickensian twist; that he and Vianne might have been siblings!<br />Yes, the lines were drawn a little too distinctly; the Bad with Reynaud, Muscat and Caro; the Good with Vianne, Armande and Josephine ....<br />...but then the grey area was intriguing...why did Vianne suddenly sleep with Roux; what was that all about? What will happen now that the wind &quot;allows&quot; her and Anouk to stay in one place; what of the fatherless child to come?  What of Josephine's relationships with both Vianne and Roux?  Will she feel betrayed by them both?<br />The story switched gears when Vianne slept with Roux and betrayed her friend; she knew Roux and Josephine were burgeoning in their relationship, but she slept with Roux anyway...at that point Vianne's goodness gets muddy; was she selfish?....what consequences will she face?<br />I hope there is more to this story to come.

B00000IMTE|2.0|The very first album by post-Purple Ritchie Blackmore´s project. Unfortunately, this debut is two steps behind in the quality department compared to the next two studio jewels by the Blackmore/Dio association.<BR>This CD still sounds excesively derivative from the decadent Deep Purple that Blackmore so desperately left behind. Music and production are in general unexpressive still making evident the creative void of our guitar hero in his late Purple stint. However, there´ s still some life in Blackmore´s Rainbow in songs like &quot;Sixteenth Century Greensleeves&quot;,the enigmatic and beautiful &quot;Temple Of The King&quot; where the medieval and gothic sound of future releases can be perceived and finally &quot;Man On The Silver Mountain&quot; that althought sounds like &quot;Smoke On The Water part II&quot; is still a nice rocking track; Ritchie ironically admitted in a GW interview that he confounded the riffs of &quot;Water &quot; and &quot;Silver Mountain&quot; during a concert repeating the latter twice.<br />Ritchie Blackmore´s Rainbow in resume, is an anticlimatic record with a few sparks of geniality.
B00005ASOI|5.0|If you've never seen a Dario Argento film and are curious as to why he has such a huge cult following, &quot;Suspiria&quot; is a great place to start finding out. The atmosphere Argento creates in the film fills you with such a sense of heavy dread, it's no wonder that he claims that this film and &quot;Inferno&quot; (an inferior but stylish follow-up) were exhausting to make. Most likely, he probably creeped himself out. &quot;Suspiria&quot; will make your skin crawl, even when nothing seems to be happening. Argento even makes falling rain seem disturbing. The film moves like a dream, and the Goblin soundtrack is haunting. This is the best, creepiest music I have ever heard in a horror film. The storyline is basic, as in most Argento films, and what moves the viewer is not the story (centering around a dancing-academy run by a coven of witches) but the style and dreamy-quality of Argento's directing. The gore is strong in this movie, so sensitive viewers beware. For any fan of good horror, this film is a must. If you've never seen Argento, now is a good time to start. And start with &quot;Suspiria&quot;!
B00000IMTF|5.0|Rainbows second play, Rising, is along with 70s efforts by Judas Priest an authentic monolith and cornerstone in the development of Gothic Metal, also paving the way for the prolific althought somewhat saturated Power and Epic Metal movement of our days.<BR>Rising is an eclectic mix of gothic-progressive tones, funk and the best hard rocking sonics of Deep Purple. The technical wizardry of the band reaches its zenith on the mini-opera &quot;Stargazer / Light In The Black&quot; specially on the latter in which the interplay between Blackmores axe and keyboardist great Tony Carey delivers one of the most exciting moments in the metal pantheon.<BR>Is hard to explain with simple words the impact of such a perfect and monumental recording, so the best you can do is listen to it over and over again in order to appreciate the slightest magical details.<BR>Definitely a truly originator of a new sound in Metal, blending majestic orchestration, technical vituosity and westerns civilization folklore and imagery of the middle ages. Essential stuff.

0553062182|5.0|Being a highly sensitive person, I started to understand my traits through the years, but here in this book is where it all comes together and is acknowledged in a way like never before. For anyone who is highly sensitive, this book let's you know that it's perfectly ok to be exactly who you are, in the clearest way imaginable. I am very grateful that it is here. It is a very validating thing.<br />For those reviewers who found this book to be off the mark or a bad thing, then it was probably not written for you. I'll echo the many who have said that if you are the kind of sensitive person that this book speaks for, it will resonate within you deeply. It brings peace to me, and if anything, it gives me more courage and strength to thrive in this world. Those who said that this book does more harm than good by \\"sinking you into your sensitivity\\" are truly missing the point. That is like telling someone not to be themselves, and is the very thing that sensitive people have been painfully dealing with in this culture for a long while. When I become more of who I am, I will only be better for myself and better for the world. Being more accepting of myself within, is something that will bring me more comfortably out into the world, not push me further back from it.<br />One reader thought that this book was written from the \\"female perspective\\" and therefore not as useful to males. I am a male and find that it was very fitting to the person I am, so it may just depend on the individual.<br />If you are a sensitive person and you have ever compared yourself to most others in the society we live in, you understand that you do not fit the mold. What this book delivers is the point - \\"it's ok\\" and in doing so it helps one to deal with oneself in a much kinder and constructive way in the world. I don't think this book is a miracle worker, it does take personal steps to be fully accepting of self, but this writing is a big help to the sensitive soul. My wish is that everyone who needs it, finds it.<br />To all those gentle, kindred spirits out there, I offer my heartfelt best wishes for much happiness and peace. I plan to order a couple of copies of this great book for friends whom I know will surely love it.<br />Thank you very much, Dr. Elaine Aron. Great job.

0452282152|4.0|Famous Dutch painter Vermeer left behind thirty-five works and little else.  In Girl with a Pearl Earring, Tracy Chevalier puts forth the possible story behind one of the more famous paintings.<br />Griet is a teenager when the failure of her father's eyesight causes him to abandon his tile-making trade.  The family's financial instability forces her into work for a wealthy Catholic family and her brother into another artisan profession.  Griet's new life with her \\"new family\\"-that of Vermer-is certainly different, in terms of religion, daily routine, social status, and financial status.  After a few months, she adjusts to her new life and finds herself separating from her family.<br />Chevalier's descriptions of the Netherlands and of painting in the seventeenth-century helped the book because they provided a framework for everything else.  Although I loved Griet, she seems too strong and too modern for the novel's time period; could a sixteen-year-old maid, with no formal education of any kind, really have outsmarted Vermeer?  Her observations about her master's art seemed too astute and too quick, even if she was supposed to be a fast learner.  Overall, I would recommend Girl with a Pearl Earring to anyone looking for a quick, engaging, and light novel.

B00000AFGM|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite albums of all time. I have all of Manson's cd's and this is my favorite one. Even though Trent Reznor didnt produce it, the music is beautiful and the songwriting is clear. Slower than Antichrist Superstar but it has some fast songs on here. Unlike Antichrist Superstar, you can play this cd in shuffle mode and every song will still sound in correct order. If you are just getting into Manson, start off with this album. If you like noise and screaming then buy the Antichrist Superstar. If you like soft music and singing then buy this. If you like Manson period then buy all of their albums.
B000088E6M|4.0|If you've heard any of 50 Cent's earlier stuff, you'd know a big flaw was weak production (and most of his independent releases, although hilarious, had ripped previously used beats). Now he's got the greatest EVER at the helm, Dre, as well as some other A-list producers (Eminem, Rockwilder to name a few). \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" as a whole is pretty solid, it's got some faults like most albums, but there's not a single song that's completely wack. There are the obvious crowd pleasers \\"In Da Club\\", \\"P.I.M.P.\\", and \\"21 Questions\\" (although it's easily the worst song on here).  Besides the hits tracks like \\"High All the Time\\", \\"Don't Push Me\\", and \\"Many Men\\", \\"What Up Gangsta\\", and \\"Bloodhound\\" are sure to entertain even the most casual listener.  The real gems on here are the memorable Ja Rule diss \\"Back Down\\", the gun toting \\"Heat\\" and my favorite \\"If I Can't\\". It's to no surprise all are produced by Dre, his beats just brought out the best and most intense rhymes 50 has to offer.  Also some bonus tracks like \\"Wanksta\\" as well as \\"U Not Like Me\\" and \\"Life's On the Line\\" are included (both where on previous 50 albums).  \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" on a basic level manages to be really entertaining and engages the listener throughout its entirety, which is why its so appealing to so many people.    On a deeper level, the album cracks tend to be as noticeable as the shattered glass on the cover art.  For the most part 50's style and swagger gets the listener so wrapped up, you almost forget his lyrics are more often sub-par.  At his best, he'll give you a clever line or make you laugh.  He's usually there when he's spitting venomous lyrics (\\"I'm back in the game shawty, to `Rule' and conquer/ You sing for hoes and sound like the cookie monster\\").  At worst his lyrics can be almost painful (\\"I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper/ The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper\\").  But, if you actually take the time and listen to his lyrics, there's really nothing memorable (unless you think the ridiculous line \\"I love you like a fat kid love cake\\" counts).    Sure 50 can't hold any of the all time greats jocks (or even just the current day greats), but while his content and skills may lack quality, 50 and this album are just entirely too entertaining to cast aside.  That and the production boost up this album so much it sounds incredible, despite the glaring flaws.  \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" is pretty much all style and very little substance.  However, this album is going to be memorable for the landscape of hip-hop and when it blows up, you'll be forking the cash over.  He said it long before: 50 Cent is the Future.  (7/10)
B00003CXCQ|5.0|The Disney Company has over used the term Masterpiece when referring to its own movies. But this one truly deserves that title. While its animation betray its age, the story and characters are still fun, and its place in history also makes it a must.<br />The story is simple and familiar. Snow White's wicket stepmother wants her killed because Snow White is \\"the fairest of them all.\\" She is saved from this fate, and hides out with seven dwarfs. But will the queen find her and try to kill her?<br />Walt's genius here was in creating the characters. The dwarfs have very distinctive personalities, and some of the best scenes in the movie revolve around them. (The scene where they first come home is a classic.) The animals add some humor as well, especially when cleaning the cottage.<br />The plot moves along well, and when I first saw it in college, I was drawn into the story even though I knew the ending. I actually felt tears when the dwarfs were mourning Snow White.<br /><br />By today's standards, the animation is flawed, especially for the prince. However, there are some truly beautiful scenes as well, particularly the sun set when the dwarfs are coming home. Fans of Disney in the 30's will recognize the feel of some of the silly symphony cartoons. The important thing to remember when watching this movie is its place in history. This is the first animated movie ever, produced when everyone thought no one would ever see it. The fact that we're still watching it is a testimony to Walt as a filmmaker and pioneer.<br />This DVD set is the perfect way to enjoy this movie.  The picture and soundtrack have been lovingly restored, and look and sound incredible.  The sound is presented in Dolby 5.1 and its original mono.  I didn't notice that much difference between the two modes, but it's nice to have the option.  The first disc also contains a wonderful audio commentary.  Recorded interviews with Walt Disney are interspersed with comments from John Canemaker.  I learned quite a bit about the film from this commentary.  The second disc contains all you would ever want to know about the history of the film.  They've got character design changes, completely abandoned concepts, deleted scenes, and information on the releases over the years to name a few things.  I spent hours soaking up the information and enjoying every moment of it.<br />This is truly a classic movie that belongs in any film fan's library.  Hurry and get this wonderful set before it disappears.ite a bit about the film from this commentary.  The second disc contains all you would ever want to know about the history of the film.

She deserved to win the OSCAR for her role as the long suffering wife and mother who does everything she can to better her life so she can provide her evil seed daughter, played beautifully by Ann BLyth, to a better life.<br />Joan is PERFECT for this role, as if it was written for her.  She actually underplays alot of her scenes.  Eve Arden is her usual wonderfully sassy sidekick.  Her lines are so witty and quoteable. <BR>The DVD is terrific and as an added bonus it contains the WONDERFUL TNT bio Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Star, narrated by the wonderful Anjelica Huston.  It sheda ALOT of light on Miss Crawford, even gives insight into the wire hanger fetish.<br />See this movie, It is Joan at her best.  How sad that a woman who worked as long(almost 50 years)and hard should be remembered for a campy version of her tourtured life.
B000088E6M|4.0|I bought this album after all the hype, and its lived up to its expectations.  Compared to his first album, Guess Who's Back, it barely misses the mark.  Although, you cannot doubt 50's lyrical ability and Em and Dre's production, you have to bang this album!  Most rap albums have 2 or 3 hot tracks, and this album comes through with a mix of 12+ banging songs.  The last 3 songs off of the album are from his first record to give you a sample of the 'greatness'.  <br />The Bonus DVD is an insight into his life and how he came to be.  If you buy this album, you will not be disappointed, and his style is a refreshing change from the current game.  All I have to say is pop the CD in, and turn it up!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I'm not generally enthusiastic about superheroes, comic book characters, or even special effects movies--but I have to say that SPIDERMAN is easily the best movie of its kind that I have ever seen, a movie that packs a tremendous whallop in terms of being just flat-out fun to watch.  The cast is solid; the story is entertaining; the special effects are first rate all the way.<br />Unless you've been living in a hole all these years, you already recognize the character--one of the last to emerge from the golden age of comic books and still one of the most popular.  But Spiderman differs somewhat from most comic book superheroes: he is insecure, angst-ridden, and carries with him all the uncertainties of youth; consequently, the character foreshadowed the current wave of much darker comicbook characters, many of whom might be described as underdog anti-heroes.  While the film departs from the original comic book storyline in a number of ways, it retains that element.  And it follows the legend in general outline: Peter Parker is a brainy but slightly nerdy and insecure kid--but when he is bitten by a radioactive (in this case a genetically mutated) spider, he develops amazing powers.  And when crime hits home in a personal way, he sets out to rid the city of bad guys and comes face to face with supercriminal Green Goblin, who is determined to tempt Spiderman into a life or crime or kill him trying.<br />I would have never imagined Tobey Maguire in the role of Spiderman, but he brings the right blend of uncertainty and joy in his newly discovered powers to the role, and as a result is a superhero character that is a lot more believable than most other big screen efforts.  Willen Dafoe, who has made a career of playing unexpected characters, is also perfectly cast as The Green Goblin, and the supporting cast--which includes Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Cliff Robertson, and Rosemary Harris--is also extremely good.  The film moves at a good pace, alternately witty and actionpacked, touching and sharp.  And although the special effects are a bit dimmed by the translation to the small screen (I always find that CGI works better on the big screen), it is still fascinating stuff to watch.<br />The double DVD set comes with a host of extras, including computer games, outtakes, and the like, but the most enjoyable of the extras are a documentary on the making of the film and a documentary re Marvel Comics with an emphasis (of course) on \\"your friendly neighborhood Spiderman;\\" frankly, bonus packages don't come much better.  Now, if you're not a comicbook or superhero fan, you might want to rent this one before you buy it; the fact that everything is on the surface (no seriously deep meanings here) is also likely to annoy people looking for depth.  But that aside, SPIDERMAN is just a tremendous amount of fun to watch from start to finish, and if you can enter into that spirit of fun you'll enjoy every minute of it.ionpacked, touching and sharp.

B00000064F|4.0|Definitely Nick Drake's most mainstream release in his all too brief discography, Bryter Layter is filled with more somber guitar lines, Nick's expressive vocals, and even drums/flutes/other instruments! Wow!<BR><BR>Those elements are a turn off for those who like more of his raw and unpolished music, but a lot of the songs on this album are just as emotional as those on Pink Moon or 5 Leaves Left, though some of the songs can do without the overproduction.Still worthy of a listen, and of a purchase.
0060523794|5.0|I worked for IBM in Israel for 8 years, 1984 until 1992.  The full employment policy was used as an excuse for lower salaries, as we were guaranteed employment as long as we wanted it.  When I confronted HR with the fact that I am being sold an insurance policy that IBM can't possibly maintain in a competitive market I was branded a troublemaker and all my chances of promotion were eliminated.  Managers were the people that made the least number of mistakes, 'we are IBM, we can't make any mistakes' was the leading concept.  All this culture was there for Lou Gerstner to change.  My friends at IBM tell me that he had done a tremendous job at that, and this book is a great description of what he did and how he did it.   <br /> <br />For those with internal IBM knowledge it is a hilarious reminder of the old IBM, for those without, it is an invaluable lesson on business.
B0000026T4|5.0|Great CD, some of coopers best work..  Trash held as my favorite cooper CD until Brutal Planet was released but I still love it.<br />This is one CD you should defiently add to your collection.
B000088E6M|4.0|It's good.  Really good.  But it still lacks something.  The beats are okay, but 50's rapping through is teeth sound isn't too good.  I still really like this CD though.  The first time I ever heard \\"Patiently Waiting\\" the Eminem verse put me ....  I also like \\"21 Questions\\", \\"Many Men\\", and \\"P.I.M.P.\\".  Definitely worth buying.
B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie Smalls is truly a legend in music.  I have yet to hear anyone who could think up the clever rhymes that he could or anyone who could take the rap world by such storm.  The greatest flow of any rapper of all time and great CD's.  To this day, Biggie still remains #1 on my list, and on a lot of others' lists too.  This CD is the first album by Biggie Smalls and possibly his best.  It might also be the best CD I have ever heard, songs like \\"Machine Gun Funk\\", \\"Ready to Die\\", and \\"Everyday Struggle\\" were my favorites on this album.
B00005JKZT|5.0|As anyone who has ever moved out of their parent's house knows, no movie is exactly like the book it was BASED upon. It's simply impossible. By their very nature, every book causes their readers to create an interpretation of the story in their heads, and each reader will have a different interpretation. This movie the version of the book Peter Jackson created in his head.<br />That being said, please automatically disregard any review that is negative based solely on the fact it doesn't follow the book to the letter.<br />Is this movie a good movie based soley on it's own merits? Sure it is. The acting is superb, that action sequences and special effects are amazing, and the sets and locations are breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Peter Jackson's INTERPRETATION of Tolkien's masterpiece.<br />Also, keep in mind that just like the books, these movies are a continuing story. In a traditional trilogy like Star Wars, each movie has a beginning, middle and end and can stand on their own. These movies are a beginning, a middle and an end, and really should be seen in the context of each other, so don't be suprised by the non-ending.
B000088E6M|5.0|best rap album of the year!
0553573403|5.0|In the first book of what looks to be a great series, Martin tells a masterful story from the viewpoints of eight very unique and uncommon fantasy heroes.  While Lord Eddard Stark's bastard son, Jon Snow, is dealing with his hard life on The Wall, there is trouble brewing in the Seven Kingdoms and across the sea.  A mystery sends Ned on a wild goose chase and eventually brings havoc to his entire family sending the Seven Kingdoms into war from three sides.  Daenerys, the \\"last\\" of her kin, tries to reclaim her family's once great status.<br />Martin does not fall prey to usual fantasy novel clich&eacute;s and provides both action and suspense while giving a very in depth and well-told story.  No one is immune to the hardships of this very realistic world and one shouldn't be surprised if the \\"bad\\" guy turns out to be the \\"good\\" guy and vice-versa.
B00005YW4H|1.0|Norah Jones is part of a popular trend that's going on right now: putting a pretty girl behind a piano. I really expected more from Norah because of the ravishing reviews and Grammy nominations, I really did, but this CD turned out to be as tasty as a rice cake. Norah has \\"sultry\\" voice, but she lacks any kind of vocal range and doesn't display any kind of emotions throughout her songs.  \\"Come Away With Me\\" starts off on a smooth note with \\"I Don't Know Why\\" and makes you think that you'll be in for something more, but after that song everything that comes after it just goes downhill. If you're not paying attention to the CD it would be hard to find out if a song has just started or ended because they all sound the same; there is nothing unique about any of them. I was hoping there would be some experimentation with certain sounds and that she'd have some East Indian influence in her music, but there is none.<br />How is her music considered jazz and who had the nerve to compare her to Billie Holiday? After I listened to Norah's CD I listened to Billie's CD- immediately and thank goodness it was close at hand- and I realized that there is nothing similar between the two of them. While Billie was able to express emotions through an array of beats and melodies, Norah's \\"sultry\\" voice- along with the music- remains stagnant and monotonous throughout \\"Come Away With Me.\\" I didn't feel relaxed or inspired at all, just bored and anxious. Sure, Norah wrote some of the songs, but that doesn't make her better than other *real* jazz greats like Billie and Etta like one reviewer tried to imply. It's not *what* you do but *how* you do it. Billie didn't write many songs, but it was her voice and feeling that she put into the songs that touched many people. Norah writes lyrics, uninspiring and dead lyrics, and puts no magic into them.<br />While Norah Jones may want you to \\"come away\\" with her, she ultimately leads you nowhere. Don't believe the hype about this CD. It's definitely the most overrated album of the year. \\"Come Away With Me\\" has just tied with Sade's \\"Lover's Rock\\" CD for being just one long boring song. If you want to listen to REAL jazz, skip this floozy and get Billie Holiday or any of Sade's earlier work.y the most overrated album of the year. \\"Come Away With Me\\" has just tied with Sade's \\"Lover's Rock\\" CD for being just one long boring song.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|About two months ago I was flipping through channels when MTV2 ran a video of Johnny Cash doing a cover of Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot; -- which is an excellent song/video in its own right -- but the Cash version gave me chills. Whether or not you're a fan of either, it must be said that Mr Cash's interpretation is simply mesmerizing. Here is a man that has been kicked to the ground so many times and has battled so many demons that the pain registers. It's unnerving and it's frightening. In this cover, he just hangs on to each word of the song beautifully. And there's a scene with his wife (June Carter Cash) that's almost too painful to watch. She's clearly uncomfortable with the subject matter. Breathtaking. I immediately bought the album and was BLOWN away. With pared-down vocals and sparse arrangements, you're given an intimate and very dark look into the psyche of a man so multi-dimensional that he can BEAUTIFULLY remaster otherwise feeble works written and performed by &quot;artists&quot; like Sting and The Eagles. It's a shame that kids are SO over-exposed to unoriginal, rehashed garage punk (it's over); the &quot;diva&quot; caterwalling (it's WAY over) and over-sampled hip-hop (when it's popular in the Burbs kids, then it's time to step away from the gangsta-rap aisle). Mr. Cash is a true legend. This CD is a masterpiece.
B000000OAA|5.0|In Queen's early days the band was more progressive and diverse musically. It was difficult to put a label on Queen, some songs were more or less hard rock/heavy metal while others were leaning towards swing or even jazz. It's no doubt that all of the members were very talented and the voice of Freddie Mercury was great.<br />I would say that \\"Sheer heart attack\\" is the best over all album from this super group. From the beginning of hard rocking \\"Brighton rock\\" via the piano driven \\"Killer queen\\", through the masterpiece in the shape of \\"Tenement funster\\" that fades into the equally great \\"Flick of the wrist\\". We also get the fast and almost heavy metal-like \\"Stone cold crazy\\" (covered by Metallica!) and something that can be regarded as total opposite: \\"Bring back that Leroy Brown\\", a song that makes me think of New Orleans for some reason.<br />Every Queen album is good and worth having. Some are better that others of course, and I'd start with \\"Sheer heart attack\\". Then \\"A night at the opera\\" followed by \\"News of the world\\".
B000088E6M|5.0|This one lives up to all the unbelievable hype. Truly the best album that has dropped in a long, long time. 50 Cent will blow you away. He alo has the best beats in the game backing him up.<br />Every track is enjoyable. This alone makes it a 5 star album. A true rarity in rap.<br />If you enjoy this you should try to get your hands on the numerous mix-tapes he has released as well as his last album &quot;Guess Who's Back&quot;. <br />Cop these and they will carry you over till the next 50 drops.
B000069AUI|2.0|So...350 (!) people have told us their opinion of this album, and we get an average rating of 4.5 stars. Don't believe it.<br />Coldplay can be compared with Oasis and other pop bands from England. I bought this album cos I was curious to see if it was that good everyone said (even Joey Tempest from Europe - remember \\"The final countdown\\"? - was praising this album). I have to say that Coldplay gets a bit boring, but on the other hand boredom seem to be what many English pop acts build their music around.<br />I certainly don't get a rush of blood to the head from listening to this album. There's only two good songs: \\"The scientist\\" and \\"Green eyes\\", and one decent: \\"In my place\\". The rest makes me wanna shout to these guys to stop. I don't listen to music to get depressed, do you? [...] I might think this one is perfectly suited for you.<br />Me? [...]
0316666343|3.0|This is not a suspense book.  Yes, the story is about a girl who is murdered, but the storyline has little to do about the murder itself.  This book is more about life and death, and about a family and a community coping after this young girl is murdered. <br />Lovely Bones truly grabs you in the beginning, more than any other book I have read.  The tone of the book is not depressing...the best word to describe it is heartbreaking. But the ending is not what I expected.  It kind of got a little strange and uncomfortable for me.  Overall, I liked the book.  I would have liked it to have ended differently, but that's just my opinion.
B000000OR9|2.0|I'm not that excited, but it has at least one excellent song: \\"Jelly roll\\". The rest is average heavy metal. Sometimes too frantic if you know what I mean.
B000084T18|5.0|Being compared with 2pac, Biggy, and all of the other HOT rappers, 50 and his crew G UNIT are going to the top, very quickly. With many underground CD's being produced and many songs, such as &quot;Wankster Remix with 2pac Shakur&quot; being made, 50 cent is very hot with the streets. Real lyrics, Real niqqa.

B00005JKDR|5.0|When we saw this in the theater, I *knew* I needed to own the video... the details are just amazing (especially the movement of Sully's fur), and Billy Crystal and John Goodman do yet another fantastic voice-over job.  This a movie adults won't mind watching more than once.  However, small kids may have a little trouble near the end... my 3-year old did not like the scene where the little girl was kidnapped and threatened.<br />The extras are pretty amazing, particularly the \\"how-to\\" stuff, which I love.  The navigation through it is a little tricky though... especially trying to figure out exactly under which category subject can be found.  Still, a must-have DVD.
0780624890|4.0|i like this movie alot it has somesort of romance action and vampires. it is about a vampire hunter named blade. it could work a little on the storyline but...<BR>i reccomend you rent or buy is today.
0393964582|4.0|If you think you know Frankenstein because you have seen the classic 1930's Hollywood movie, then you really don't know Frankenstein.  The short novel upon which the movie is loosely based (so loosely as to be almost a different story)is a morality tale on the creation of life and the obligations of the creator and the created.  Mary Shelley was only twenty when she wrote the novel, begun when a house party attended by the poet Byron and Shelley's husband, the poet Percy Shelley decided to swap \\"ghost\\" stories one evening.  Only Mary Shelley completed her story and this is the 1818 text presented in this book.<br />One main objection I have about this book (and the only reason that kept it from getting 5 stars) is basically the plot itself.  If you think that a tight plausible plot is needed, then this is not the book for you.  There are too many holes and too many times I found myself asking, Why would the character do this?  But if you read for language and philosophical thought, then Frankenstein is a perfect short read.  The monster is very erudite and able to express his emotions perfectly.  Why was he created and how can he endure if all he receives is the scorn and hatred of those around him?  What is the obligation of the creator-to please his creation or keep him from doing harm to others?  This is the true core of the story and the contrasting feelings between Victor Frankenstein, the creator and the monster fill the pages.<br />While not a difficult read, it is one that is totally unexpected if you have no prior knowledge of the novel's difference with the movie.  While the movie is rightfully a classic, the book delves more into the spiritual and emotional realms of creation and its affect on all.  I would highly recommend this book for those who are intrigued by the beauty of language and thought.  J
B000068QY7|2.0|I guess its hard to top thier huge hit record \\"Whats the Story...\\", but this is the same old same old as what came after it.  One or two half decent songs and some brief moments of the playing and singing - I happen to like Liam's raspy Lennonesque sound - that help the CD limp back to shelf instead of the rubbish bin.  Don't bother.  Good thing Man City play better than the fans here.
B000088E6M|5.0|This cd is unbelieveably great.  Of course its produced by eminem, an absolute genius.  His rhymes flow smoother than anyone elses and he has had the most hype probably since eminem came out with his cd.  the best songs are &quot;P.I.M.P.&quot; &quot;What up Gangsta&quot; &quot;High all the time&quot; and all the rest of his songs are great.  In da Club is another classic and wanksta is on the cd as a hidden track.  He has 19 songs on this album with no skits except for a 5 second as the first track.  I highly recommend this cd to any rap lover and i hope to see many more albums from 50.
0060536969|1.0|Now Crichton is just churning out movie outlines. That's all this book is. There's very little substance to the &quot;science&quot; here. It's an interesting concept, but very little explanation of why or how things happen. And the characters are equivalent to those fabled teenagers in &quot;Friday the 13th&quot;. Nobody has any sense and people keep wandering off and doing stupid things that get them killed. And the most frustrating thing: no one EVER thinks to pick up the phone and call the police or other authority for help. Silly, just silly. Save your money and wait for the movie, then save your money again.
B00005JKG9|5.0|The sheer joy of Glengarry Glen Ross is watching seven great actors clearly relishing the oppurtunity to work in a truly exceptional film.It's an absolutely compelling and absorbing drama blessed with superb performances.Al Pacino gives his best performance since Tony Montana as slick Ricky Roma,Ed Harris is a dynamic font of rage as Dave Moss,Alec Baldwin is memorably loathsome as Blake but it's the late,great Jack Lemmon who walks away with the film with his superb performance as the weary but energetic Shelley Levene.Glengarry Glen Ross is an incredible movie that everyone of age to see it should see.<BR>But while the film is worth five stars,the DVD is only worth two.Despite the large list of extras,it's actually a big disappointment.The commentary by Jamie Foley is full of long pauses,he doesn't have much to say and is frankly boring.The Jack Lemmon tribute just consists of a bunch of unnoteworthy people telling their boring stories about Jack.A montage of clips from his career would have been a better tribute for the late,great Jack.The clip of him on Inside The Actor's Studio is great though.The &quot;Always Be Closing&quot; documentary is completely bewildering.There's nothing worse than having people bore you with stories that don't go anywhere.That's what this documentary is like.It barely focuses on the film at all,instead it mainly consists of utterly obscure real life salesmen talking about their profession.Alan Arkin is the only guy from the film interviewed on it!The &quot;J Roy&quot; documentary is equally mysterious.It's an ancient,black and white short film about another obscure real life salesman.These two featurettes are boring and a big disappointment.They actually have very little relevence to the film so why were they included?It's not all bad though,Alec Baldwin's scene specific mini commentary is excellent.The others are good too.The Charlie Rose interview with Jack Lemmon is very good and there's a very funny clip of Kevin Spacey on InsideThe Actor's studio.Overall though,it's a letdown and the extras have a woeful lack of Pacino.But when the film's good,f**k the extras!
B000088E6M|5.0|Get rich or die tryin is FIRE!were Im from Rap is like Religion and there hasn't been a more highly anticipated album in recent memory.back to the point 16 tracks of fire including a couple of bonus tracks.one of my favorite's \\"Patiently waiting\\" Ft.Eminem could be one of the best 50cent songs I ever heard. Also if its posible his flow is even hotter his timing and melody definitly show Eminem & Dr.Dre's influince its the perfect time for this colaboration.Im not going to name songs its all hot if you love REAL rap do yourself a favor and buy it.
B00005OM4N|3.0|Britney claims on this junior record that she is \\"Not girl\\" but still \\"Not yet a woman,\\" and like Britney, the listener will also be stuck between loving this cd and hating it.  Some songs on here profess her mature attitude, while others still allow you to cringe at the corny words and simple beats.  \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", \\"Boys\\", \\"Overprotected,\\" and \\"What's like to be me\\" show her ability to grow as an artist (compared to previous album songs); however, \\"Bombastic Love,\\" \\"Anticipation,\\" and \\"Cinderella\\" all prove that Britney is NOT A WOMAN.  These filler songs bring the quality of the album far down.  Overall this record is a pretty good POP album, but when compared to other artist, Britney stands no ground.  Her voice is MUCH better than previous album's, but she is a performer--not a singer, and without a video to back up these songs, they might not stand a chance on the radio.  Overall: Buy it . . . if you like Britney.
B000067J1H|4.0|A great film. Don't be turned off by the 'male testosterone flick' vibe this film might seem to give off in the ads or in its name. It's really a very original, ingenious, subtle, and engaging film. The cinematography style is intrepid and highly polished, and the storyline never ceases to grab you when you least expect it. Do not read about the plot of this film, or what happens. Just check this movie out 'cold turkey' and your mind is sure to be blown!
B000088E6M|5.0|50 cent refuses to be underground.  He refused to go six feet underground after receiving nine bullets out of the gun of a notorious Queens drug dealer.  He's paid his dues on New York's mixtape scene, where today's best hip-hop is slowly surfacing, and being recognized even more slowly.  Finally, the same rapper that boasted, \\"If I aint rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail,\\" has the opportunity to become rich.  50 Cent's debut album on Shady Records is an remarkably strong studio debut for a rapper that debuted on the streets long ago with his smart-tounged ode to larceny, \\"How to Rob.\\"  50 is witty, has terrific flow, and proves that he is able to write songs and hooks that go beyond his two-minute freestyles on mixtapes.  The production on this album is flawless, with Dr. Dre, most likely the greatest hip-hop producer of all time, providing most of the beats.  The remainder of the beats are generally handled by Dre's protege, Eminem, making a name for himself currently behind the boards as a producer, and Shah Money XL, who has produced many of 50's previous songs.  This album is more than worth buying, and should be an essential element to any serious hip-hop collection.  50 Cent is undoubtedly the future of hip-hop music, and will carry the torch with a new breed of New York rappers after the careers of the current kingpins, Jay-z and Nas come to an end.  50 Cent has paid his dues to the streets, and will finally be able to enjoy success.  Any true fan of hip-hop, someone who loves and understands the genre, would be a fool to sleep on what could be the biggest album of 2003.
6304698798|5.0|I remember seeing ads for this movie when they would show it on TV, during those \\"Movies that Guys Like\\" marathons. I don't know why, but for some reason I thought it would just be a boring Western shoot-em-up. Now I'm 25 and I just watched all of Sergio Leone's westerns, and I have to admit that I was dead wrong. These aren't just among the greatest westerns of all time, they are some of the greatest movies of all time. \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" are Leone's two stunning masterpieces. <BR> <BR>This film isn't just a shoot-em-up, although it has some of the best gunfighting scenes you will see. It is a mesmerizing epic about the old west, the Civil war, friendship, greed, and revenge. It stars the greatest Western hero of all time, Clint Eastwood, in the role that made him famous. It also stars the great Eli Wallach as \\"the Ugly\\" and Lee Van Cleef as \\"the Bad\\". Superb characters, good humor, amazing battle scenes, and incendiary cinematography make this a movie well worth buying.
B00006LLNV|5.0|I fell in love with the film. So many layers. Visually stunning. Breathtakingly acted. Then I bought the cd. I play it nonstop. This is an incredible addition to my cd library. Great as background music anytime. I teach art to elementary students and they absolutely adore it. We are even doing projects based on listening to the score. Fabulous!
B00005V3Z4|1.0|Like a lot of other suckers who bought this movie, I thought it would be a cool, atmospheric horror film with some sort of monster bunny rabbit.  Needless to say, I was dead wrong.  This is a bad movie from beginning to end, one that tries to be artsy by providing a convoluted and incoherent plot about a depressed high school kid.  The bunny rabbit turns out to be some mask, not a real demon or anything, and the horror elements are very poorly handled. <BR> <BR>Most of all, I found this movie to be BORING.  But like a lot of boring, overrated films (such as IN THE BEDROOM or BREAKING THE WAVES or, dare I say it, SPIDERMAN) this movie has managed to trick a lot of people into thinking it has worth.  Save your hard-earned dollars and buy one of these great films instead: <BR> <BR>THE STEPFORD WIVES <BR>VOLCANO HIGH <BR>THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY <BR>EQUILIBRIUM <BR>UNDISPUTED <BR>JACOB'S LADDER <BR>NIGHT OF THE HUNTER w/ Robert Mitchum <BR>KEOMA <BR> <BR>If you haven't seen these movies, check them out.  You will thank me later.
B000001F3C|5.0|If I had to single out one album in U2's history as the defining moment as a band, it would be War.  The reason is simple this album saw them break away from being 4 guys who were just another in a long list of part Punk and Part New Age bamd, and established U2 as a unique band.  The songs are largely political, Bono's voice has always been their, Larry delivered some hard hitting drums, and Edge and Adams produced some memorable tunes as well.  <BR>This album was also important as the band was struggling with religion and the fact that the band wasn't showing signs of being a big success.  <br />Then Edge was hit with a moment of inspiration and wrote the guitar part for \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".  Fitting since that track would set the mood for the whole album which is simple, an idealistic young rock band lashing out at a world content to divide and destroy itself.  The album has no stand out tracks, but is just a great overall album.<br />Sunday Bloody Sunday- For those who don't know the name is reference to an event in which British guards opened fire on protesters in Northern Ireland back in 1972.  That said the song isn't so much about Bloody Sunday itself as the never ending cycle of violence it set off that is still carried out today in Northern Ireland.  It pleas for non-violence in the North, while also pointing out how nobody seems to care with the \\"Its true we are immune/ when fact is fiction and TV reality/ And today the millions cry.. we eat and drink while tommorow they die.\\" 10/10<br />Seconds- I really like this song, and when you think about what happening in the world today the \\"In an Apartment above times square\\" lyric is chilling.  The song is very dark humor really its about the danger of weapons of mass destructions. 10/10<br />New Years Day- Very good bass part in this track.  I heard it was about something in Poland, but its basic premise is reconciliation and unification so it can be applied to many events. 9/10<br />Like a Song- Lyricallythis is the best of the political songs on this album.  It sounds like an outcry against partisan violence, or violence in general.  I would venture to guess this was a more angry outcry against the violence in Northern Ireland. 10/10 <br />Drowning Man- This is a little break from that angry at the world songs, a mellow song that shows how far U2's ability with softer songs has come since their early days, not really that good at all. 5/10<br />The Refugee- \\"Another high energy song, about well a Refugee, whos husband goes to war\\" and \\"whos mother say one day shes gonna live in Americaaaa.... in America\\".  A little on the short sidae but still good. 8.5/10<br />Two Hearts Beat as One- Despite attempts to read more into it, it sounds like another Northern Ireland refference at times, and taking into account Bono wrote this on his honeymoon I think this is just a love song; a somewhat mediocre one at that. 7/10<br />Red Light- The female voice in the back is a little haunting, but this song like Drowning Man reflects the bands difficulty with soft songs at this time. 6.5/10<br />Surrender- How this song escaped radio is beyond me, this would have been the bands break out single had it been.  Very smooth song documenting a woman fed up with her place in society searching for meaning.  So maybe I was a little hard on them about there soft song ability as this is well done. 10/10<br />40- this track is a very good type of track to close this album with.  The echoing lines of \\"How long..\\" are a more scaled down version of what the band has been saying about the divided nature of the world through the whole album. 9/10
B000088E6M|5.0|All i have to say is &quot;awesome&quot;.  i think rap has been waiting for someone like this... In my opinion...  all Tracks..  (16 + 3 bonus tracks) are great. He talks a lot about Ja rule and thats acceptable... and the DVD that comes with it is tight as hell so...  get this as soon as you can!   G-UNIT!!
B000001FS3|4.0|Alright this is a great album and I will not argue that, but in my opinion it gets more praise than it deserves.  I rate this as U2's 3 best albums among the ones I own, with Achtung Baby #1 and War #2.  The album has some classics, but also some songs that are lets just say not classic.  One thing is it is a much more acustic album thats carried by Bono's song writing and voice.<br /> I was 4 when this album came out and only bought it about 6 months ago so I missed the media blow up and \\"Rock's hottest ticket\\" days of U2 around this time, but it seems what made this the bigger breakout album than War or Unfergettable Fire was that this was unlike anyother music put out in the hair band and pop days of the late 80's.<br />As for the songs everyone probably has heard the first 3, \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", \\"Still Haven't Found what I'm Looking for\\", and \\"With or Without You\\", they are all classics.  All are 10/10 in my opinion.<br />After that its a mixed-bag,<br />Bullet The Blue Sky- You know that chant at sporting events when a really hyped up player or team gets taken by an underdog, that applies to this song.  Its ok, but not as good as the political songs from War.  7/10<br />Running to Stand Still- I listened to it once though it was a good song, then found out it was about a woman addicted to heroin.  I listened to it again and it was even better, probably the best of U2's heroin songs. 9/10<br />Red Hill Mining Town- Lots of good imagery in the lyrics, but the music is a bit bland. 8/10<br />In God's Country- Very good song both lyrics and music, though it could be longer. 10/10<br />Trip Through your Wires- I kind of like the Blues feel of this song, but its just missing something. 8.5/10<br />One Tree Hill- This is one of the bands greatest song, and a very touching tribute to a lost friend of theirs.  This exert, \\"Jara sang his song a weapon, in the hands of love/ You know his blood still cries from the ground\\" is just one of many powerful imagesin this song. 10/10<br />Exit- Way too short, but it does have a great bass part and some dark lyrics about either a person snapping and killing himself, or a guy snapping and killing others.  You decide. 9.5/10<br />Mothers of the Disappeared- Its touching and it has some very nice lines, but its also really long with large segments of nothingness. 8/10
B000069AUI|2.0|I give this record 2 stars for only the simple fact that they are young and have already done what many took years to accomplish.  However, that is all the stars it will recieve.  This record simply does not grab the listeners attention during the first listen.  Or the second for that matter.  It could be argued that the record is more subtle, not intended to actually grab our attention at first listen, however, the truth of the matter is after listening to it a few times over and not yet catching anything in my ear, I gave up on it.  <br />Aside from a few tracks that recieved substantial radioplay of the sugarcoated tracks &quot;In My Place&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot;, and the bittersweet different sound of &quot;God Put A Smile Upon Your Face&quot;, this record is not worth your money.  Coldplay seems to have elements borrowed from something in the range of Radiohead to Oasis, and they did succeed in making their own unique formula and selling quite a lot of records.  However, it would be smarter to save your money, as simply buy the new Radiohead or Oasis titles.  A Rush of Blood to the Head is simply not an up to par record from a sub-par group.
0782006809|3.0|Cary Grant and Doris Day made some great movies together.  I can't get enough of Pillow Talk or Lover Come Back.  That Touch of Mink falls a little short of that mark.  While it's as charming, it's just not as funny.  I own several of the movies the two did together, and I find that I don't watch That Touch of Mink as much as I thought I would.  If you're a fan of classic comedies, this is nice one to add to your collection.  Just don't start your collection with it.
B00006LSM3|4.0|With much joy George Harrison says goodbye with the songs on \\"Brainwashed.\\" This picks up right where \\"Cloud 9\\" leaves off. This is much more optimistic than his previous works.  Of course his familiar sense of humor is prominent.  The Bob Dylan influence is also very prevalent.  I'm glad that Jeff Lynne did not overly produce this one. These tracks were made shortly before his death.  The CD begins with a little chatter from George and then the festive \\"Any Road.\\" There's a lot to like about this swan song.  All the songs have conviction as if this was the last opportunity for him to share his message.  Maybe he knew his time on earth was coming to an end. His slide guitar and even his ukulele playing is inspired. The string arrangement on \\"rising Sun\\" is very reminiscent of the element of ELO that I like.  There are a few strange sounding songs reminiscent of his dark horse years.  This raises the question, \\"When are the dark horse recordings going to be reissued.\\"  The highlight is the standard \\"Devil and deep blue sea.\\"  I guarantee that you will shuffle to work the next day.  The album concludes with ancient chants as he summons his spirit to the next plane.  It is a nice goodbye letter from St. George, the quite one.
0312265859|5.0|Prepare to be addicted.  Janet Evanovich has created one of the best series of books I've ever read.  From One For The Money right through to Hard Eight, you won't find a better combination of humor and suspense.  Not to mention some men that make you want to climb into the pages and be Stephanie Plum herself.<br />Hard Eight is the best so far.  It gives you everything you want.  Hillarious bouts with the classic characters of Grandma Mazur, Lula and the rest of the Plum family plus unexpected new twists that break away from the rut of the romantic plot line.<br />If Hard Eight is your first Plum novel, you have to go back to the beginning and read the rest.  Whatever you do, don't be tricked into buying the other Evanovich books.  \\"Full House\\" and the others fall far short of the Plum books.  Save yourself the disappointment.  And don't buy Visions of Sugar Plums while trying to tide yourself over to the release of the ninth book.  That turkey is on the marked down list for a reason!
B000002LAB|5.0|Everyone remembers that special someone who years later seems more fanatasy than real. Every time I hear this album's title track I realize SHE WAS REAL and as perfect as this piece. Honestly, the rest of the album is only &quot;very good (!)&quot;,but TUTU-its as amazing as my jr year at WVA State-88-89. Both TUTU and she changed my life forever.
B00003CXB2|5.0|Although it's a long movie, and although the dvd lacks a DTS track, this is without doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. The American Film Institute rates it as #5. In my opinion however, I believe it to be #1 better than the Godfather, or Casablanca, even better than Citizen Kane(#1), which I love greatly, but not as much. The characters' performances are extremely powerful; the views, breathtaking; the story, involving and impressive. All in all this is a wonderful movie to own. No collection should be without it. Don't forget a nice bit of special features, like \\"making of\\" docs and interviews.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Brian Wilson was so blown away after hearing Rubber Soul by The Beatles that he felt the need to compete with them, so he immediately went to work on a new album in the first few months of 1966. What he came up with goes even further than the amazing Rubber Soul in melody and harmony development. Brian had a genius ear when it came to crafting melodies, so he was at the height of his powers here. He went to work at this while his fellow Beach Boys were on tour and developed a dozen sophisticated songs that expressed how he was feeling inside. This was totally new in rock music at the time so it is a landmark recording. To open up the album we have &quot;Wouldn't It Be Nice,&quot; which is a sweet song with a phenomenal bridge. &quot;You Still Believe In Me&quot; is a minor melody ballad that is really beautiful. The song is very emotional with moving progressions and is most striking at the part where he sings &quot;I wanna cry&quot; over a feast of notes.<br />&quot;That's Not Me&quot; is sung by Mike Love and is another highlight with its key changes. Then comes &quot;Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulder),&quot; another emotional ballad that comes to a climax in the middle when Brian tells us to &quot;listen&quot; with the sad violins coming directly afterwards. &quot;I'm Waiting For The Day&quot; is faster and neat, but then comes &quot;Let's Go Away For Awhile&quot; which is a very moving instrumental full of violins, Hawaiian-styled guitar, and strings. &quot;Sloop John B&quot; is said to be the least striking on the album, but it's actually really good and it has a beautiful a capella section in the middle. &quot;God Only Knows&quot; has been called by Paul McCartney the best song ever written; so many excellent songs have been written but it does have excellent harmony vocals and it's another highlight.<br />Then comes the wonderful &quot;I Know There's An Answer,&quot; and after that is &quot;Here Today&quot; which is the most ambitious of all the songs.Although it appears quaint with its production, it has some neat key and tempo changes within its fairly sparse minor-key melody. Next is &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; which is sung from the heart and is another minor ballad like the rest. Near the end we get the title track, the second instrumental of the album, which uses two coke bottles for percussion and more Hawaiian guitar. Finally &quot;Caroline No&quot; ends the album on a graceful and sad note and shows that this is a truly genius piece of work. It's hard to express the utter perfection and beauty on this record (even though the bonus track &quot;Hang On To Your Ego&quot; is nothing special). You'd really just have to hear it. Buy it, you fool!
B00003CX97|5.0|It's #13 on the American Film Institute's (AFI) top 100 list and is from David Lean the same director who made Lawrence of Arabia, both these movies earned 7 academy awards, including Best Picture for that year; so obviously he must know how to make a movie, a good movie.
B000002H70|4.0|If you've ever been in that kind of mood where absolutely nothing is going right in your life and you just feel like crawling into a hole to die somewhere, this is a band that you could find potential solace in. The Cure (aka tormented lead vocalist and guitarist Robert Smith with rotating backing musicians over the years) are widely regarded as a major influence on the goth music scene, and that is pretty much true. Their gloom and doom soundscapes, often dirgey song arrangements and miserable lyrics of several of their numbers seemingly offer little hope from a bleak existence.<br />At this point in The Cure's history, Robert Smith seemed to be incorporating more and more uptempo pop tunes into the songwriting, but on this one, he seemed to have a serious change of mood. Apparently, he decided that instead of using the double length 70+ min. material for the kind of stuff that was so prominent on Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me, he just felt like stretching the songs out to long lengths (several of them hit the 7 to 9 minute range), and an absolutely miserable mood throughout. Pornography might beat out this one in being the bleaker album overall, but this one speaks to me a lot more. It is crammed with well-developed melodies and a majestically beautiful tone to the bleak guitar lines and keyboards.<br />The most notable thing about this album, though, is that these instrumental parts are, at their best, amazing. Occasionally, the listener might think that a particular band has hit upon the perfect instrumental part that appears to be so simple, yet seems to timelessly come out of nowhere to rise the song to new heights in such a way they might wish the song could go on forever. Well, this is exactly the impression I get during several of the songs here, and it could be used to perfectly assess the keyboard and guitar majesty of the opening \\"Plainsong,\\" as it has unique textures. And the steady rhythm, keyboard tones, guitar line and the gloomy lyrics come to form a melancholy minor masterpiece like \\"Last Dance,\\" maybe one of the quintessential songs in defining the album's impact.<br />\\"Pictures Of You,\\" meanwhile, is essentially a 7-minute groove that, in its repetitive guitar and bass parts, doesn't really have any build to it at all, but then why is it so gorgeous and addictive? It's instrumentally majestic, and it's more proof of Smith's terrific songwriting skills. This otherworldly sound even helps a song that might have sounded like filler otherwise (\\"Closedown\\") absolutely come to life. When they attempt a more hard-edged sound, like on \\"Fascination Street,\\" the effect is breathtaking enough for me to call this song, among a few others on this album, one of the ultimate exercises in minimalism - there's nothing remotely complex about that bassline or guitar part at all, but the way it builds together in its simplicity with that magical tone, the overall energy, and that atmosphere...let's just say that the lyrics and vocals really add to that once they come in.<br />Sometimes, though, the minimalism of this album takes getting used to - the first time I heard the title track, for instance, I was horribly bored by it. All it consists of is a simple, plodding dance groove with the same rhythm and guitar part over and over with occasional choir-like backing vocals for 8 minutes, but be patient with this one - it grows on you. Somehow, this one is thoroughly addictive in all its plodding tendencies. The melody is insanely catchy, and the pace gradually seems to rise all the time by way of the lyrics (which are some of Smith's best ever - pure poetry). And unfortunately, on occasions the epic tendency gets out of hand. \\"The Same Deep Water As You\\" is a really slow 9-minute exercise in melody-less despairing boredom. It doesn't go anywhere or captivate at all. I could say the same thing about \\"Homesick\\" which has very nice piano work, but really not much of a melody, and it drags at 7 minutes. \\"Lovesong\\" is an excellent track and I won't diss it, but the radio-friendly 3-min. time and poppy sound makes it feel a little out of place here.<br />Wow, somehow I've gone reviewing this whole really lengthy album (12 tracks, 72 minutes) without mentioning \\"Lullaby,\\" a scary little tune that I love. Everything about the music is just extremely ominous and creepy, from the violin-like keyboards to the haunting guitar parts, with Smith singing in a quiet and calm voice to further add to the terror, and of course, the lyrics about how the \\"spiderman is having me for dinner tonight\\" work about as great as they possibly can. This song, like everything else on the album, should be played loud in the dark. This album is great, with only a few overlong and boring moments keeping it from classic status. The best material here is just astonishing work and makes it my favorite Cure disc, and as a whole, it ranks as The Cure's darker side at its most quintessential.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I don't know what happened when this movie came out, but it didn't do as well as it should have. And no nominations or awards, what's up with that? Breathtaking visual effects and amazing directing are what make this film truly remarkable. And the screenplay? 100% attention grabbing. This movie drags you in to take you on a ride full of emotions as you wonder what will happen next. And the very interesting subject of artificial intelligence and robots appears once again, and the question of how far will it go? comes up as a result of this.
B000002N2Z|4.0|A hardcore-sounding metal-punk-hip hop hybrid, I can't fathom why the Deftones were initially lumped together with bands like Korn (who call them their \\"brother band\\") - the 'tones are far more intense and original. And they are anything but generic trend-hopping rap-metal. The band has been doing this since 1989! I don't see why any fan of hardcore music would dislike the Deftones, especially Adrenaline. It's a hard-edged, raw, and just plain insane piece of music. Rage comes crashing through the speakers for the entire 40+ minutes of the disc. It doesn't sound fake or forced at all. You may not be able to understand exactly what Chino is screaming about, but you can tell he's pissed off. This is the kind of stuff metal lovers dream about. There is some subtlety here, however. The band does several softer, more haunting sections in the songs to contrast with the aggression. The Deftones have a truly terrifying vocalist in Chino Moreno, who goes from unsettling whispers to horrifying screams. (Dear God, does he scream. One of these days he's going to wake up with his lungs on the pillow next to him.) Guitarist Stephen Carpenter offers simple, but direct and scathing riffs, that perfectly match this style.<br />The brutal songs on Adrenaline are more than the best example of their style. It shoves pure rage into your face with its obnoxious and sometimes unintelligible lyrics and attitude, and is one of the most positively convincing 90s metal albums. After the first couple of listens, it sounded to me like extremely unvaried guitar riffing, weak melody and talentless screaming. But after awhile, Adrenaline opens up and reveals its strengths as a very heavy, direct, and emotionally powerful offering. Stephen Carpenter creates somehow unique-sounding riffs like the chugging opener \\"Bored,\\" where the power of the band's chemistry comes together in a forceful mix, produced well by Terry Date. \\"Nosebleed\\" is a very harsh tune with truly angry and scathing, explicitly profane lyrics and hardcore energy in the music that somehow doesn't come off as merely juvenile, but as a genuine threat, and it's contrasted by a slower middle section that builds up again to the heavier verse part, all with the band remaining tight. \\"Minus Blindfold\\" is also a strong track, and an indicator that Chino is one to watch out for (or stay the hell away from, depending on your point of view). \\"Root,\\" meanwhile, hints that the band is capable of expanding its creativity before this direct material could become stale in the future, featuring the most complex riff on the album and tremendous energy.<br />The quieter moments, \\"One Weak\\" (with nice bass work and frantic vocals), the closer \\"Fireal\\" (featuring a dark and desperate atmosphere before building up to a gripping ending), and \\"Birthmark\\" are also good songs. \\"7 Words\\" is an amazing wake up call that starts off quietly with the controlled vocals in the verses (helped out by an awesome bassline) before again going into unparalleled heavy viciousness. \\"Engine No. 9\\" shows a bit of a hip hop influence in the lyrics, which makes the attitude and the screaming chorus even more effective and noticeably psycho.<br />Of course, this IS a debut, and it shows. It often sounds underdeveloped, the production is quite raw, and the band is not as mature-sounding as they would be on later releases. Yet that's part of the fun. The reckless intensity displayed here is something they haven't captured again since (not that they're trying to). Not to mention that this record has incredible staying power. The Deftones aren't considered a band of great melody-writing power, but listen to the excellent riff of \\"Bored\\" or the haunting vocals of \\"One Weak\\" and tell me that stuff won't stick in your head for a long time to come. So is it a masterpiece? Not by a long shot, but it's essential nonetheless. Try to forget those new-metal biases, and you'll have a hell of a time. Adrenaline isn't for everyone because there is quitea bit of an obnoxious feel to it that may turn a few listeners off, and the songwriting doesn't quite sound developed to its full potential. But for classic aggression, this is an excellent record.
0375414053|2.0|I was initially excited to read this book.  I am a working mother who is married to an Englishman and loves English books.  I am not a violent person but, after a few chapters, I wanted to smack Kate and tell her to grow up.  If I were her husband, I would have left long ago AND taken the children with me.  She is obviously self-centered and career obsessed.  I never once got the feeling that she enjoyed being a mother.  Then we are supposed to believe she just gives it all up (not until after pulling a juvenile stunt at the office) and is \\"Mary Poppins\\" all of the sudden?  There were a few incidents that made me laugh or cry but overall the rest did not make up for them.
B000002I25|5.0|It's hard to find a better example of a band that defines the phrase \\"unique\\" than The Doors. They never quite fit squarely in the pigeonholes of psychedelic, blues, hard rock or pop, but they epitomized all of those attitudes and musical sensibilities at the same time, relying on the flamboyant vocal, poetic theatrics and undeniable songwriting talents of Jim Morrison. Jim, who joined the \\"27 Club\\" with his death at that age in 1971, is a hugely imitated personality - people make a point to say how the band's sound was never imitated as a whole, but this is one aspect of it that surely was. Listen to modern rock singers like Eddie Vedder, Michael Hutchence and Scott Weiland and tell me you can't hear a large Jim influence in their lyrical and vocal approach. I've always loved his provocative, interesting poetry and lyrics, and I don't think he was overrated at all as a frontman.<br />Undoubtedly most responsible for the band's unique approach, Ray Manzarek had a carnival-esque and technically impressive sound to his playing, and it very much took on an eerie-sounding tone that added a majestic horror to the music. His playing is distinctive to the point where it's possible to recognize a Doors song strictly from this style. I should also mention that since the band never employed a bass player (using session musicians on their albums instead), he often had to fill in that void with keyboard bass in a live setting, which probably made the sound even more distinctive. And as for the rest of the lineup, Robbie Krieger had an inventive, bluesy style that was helped by his non-use of a guitar pick, and quite a few of his songwriting contributions are easily among the best songs the band ever did. John Densmore was a really efficient jazz-styled drummer who provided a steady backbeat for the sound.<br />This is unquestionably the album that defined The Doors sound as everyone knows them, the strikingly original style of the band breaks through immediately throughout these 11 tracks, with the mysterious organ sound in full force that gives the album its timeless atmosphere. Of course, the presence of Jim Morrison doesn't really hurt either - on his technical ability, he doesn't have much range, but his charisma and overall mystique gives the songs something they would have lacked otherwise. And these songs hold up today, showcasing nearly everything that made the band special. From catchy pop tunes, entertaining organ-led rockers, atmospheric ballads, raving epics, and even blues and 20's style interpretations, it's all covered here.<br />Everything begins explosively with the driving and intense \\"Break On Through,\\" which has incredible energy, a fantastically catchy melody, and a distinct main organ part. The following \\"Soul Kitchen\\" is a great pop-oriented groove, and its pace is among the more lighthearted moments of the album. That uncertainty is allowed to break through a bit for the first time in the majestic ballad \\"The Crystal Ship,\\" a dreamy mini-epic that sounds peaceful and calm, but it does have an edge to it. I dig the piano break there.<br />Like I hinted at before, though, the sound isn't just limited to renditions of the band's own material. There are also two cover versions performed here, and passing through the minds of musicians that had a real desire to achieve something different, they take on the Doors stamp, even when they're on completely different ends of the musical landscape. The 20's style musical number \\"Alabama Song\\" is entertaining as hell, with that cool organ groove leading an irresistible singalong. \\"Back Door Man\\" is actually an old blues from the Willie Dixon archives, and Jim plays that part well over the main organ riff and bluesy guitar, with the screams of \\"I'm your back door man!\\" and tone of his singing on \\"the men don't know but the little girls understand...\\" really working.<br />The ultimate highlight, though, is \\"Light My Fire.\\" In one of the few coincidences of this sort, it was also their hugest hit single. One of two lengthy showcases on here, \\"Light My Fire\\" was the first song Robbie Krieger ever wrote for the band, and it begins on a simple, catchy melody. The catchiness of the tune alone, however, isn't what really makes the song. It is the stunning middle jam, with solos by Manzarek and Krieger respectively, and the effect of how they both seem to play off each other's parts and Densmore's rhythm with the effortlessly flowing, memorable structure of their showcases is exceptional, and the transition into the song's final verse is a perfect way of capping it off, with the vocal yell of \\"TRY TO SET THE NIGHT ON FIRE!\\"<br />The other extended track is the notorious 11-1/2 minute closer \\"The End,\\" which gives insight into Jim's poetic dark side. The musical backing is quite eerie and hypnotizing, with the organ over haunting guitar lines. The whole thing might be somewhat overlong, but the lyrics are incredible (with disturbing bits such as the part where the killer murders his family, and that rave about the insane children) and the mood is interesting enough to justify its length. The way it crashes at the end is so powerful, too. It's built in like one chord sequence, but it still works well. \\"Take It As It Comes\\" is a minor pop classic on here, with breathtaking speedy organ. I hear people complaining about \\"I Looked At You,\\" but damned if I know why - I love that song. Simplistic, but it's a very sweet little ditty. The clever \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" is fun and catchy, and the haunting \\"End Of The Night\\" features more gloomy organ. This is my favorite Doors album and it is definitely the place to start as your introductory journey to the thrilling sound of The Doors.
0060925000|5.0|One could say that \\"A Suitable Boy\\" is the perfect title for this work by Vikram Seth as it is indeed the tale of Lata's search for an ideal husband, according both to Lata's own and her family's definitions of \\"suitable\\"; be they social, religious, political or personal. Alongside her and her family, we are lead to antagonise over how much she should value love; how much she may be willing to sacrifice for it and where following intense love might lead. We share these and many other quandries with her. However, around Lata there are many other lives, each inter-twined with her own, yet heading in its own direction. As is the case in real life, there is never just one story, and I am tempted to say that reading \\"A Suitable Boy\\" is like living in the heart of India and, more specifically, in the heart of the world Seth created, with all your soul. <br />So much are we drawn into the characters' lives by the rich nature of Seth's descriptions and dialogues, that it is very tedious to have to do anything else but read and be with them all. I am not sure what I will do without them now that I have sadly reached the end and discovered who the suitable boy actually was.........<br />This is a very special book indeed, perhaps the best I have ever read.
B00006L7XQ|4.0|My overall assessment of this album is that it is very good; by the standards of most artists, it's outstanding.  However, when comparing it to the first three Cash Releases on the American Recordings label (American Recordings, Unchained, and American III: Solitary Man), this one isn't quite at the same level.<br />The one new Cash composition is the title track.  It's a very good song, with great symbolic biblical references, mostly from the book of Revelations.  It may remind you a bit of &quot;Redemption&quot; from the first American Recordings album.<br />Some of the covers are innovative, some less so.  &quot;Hurt&quot;, &quot;I Hung My Head&quot;, &quot;Personal Jesus&quot; and &quot;In My Life&quot; are interesting and very well done.  Cash does lend his own unique style to &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot;, &quot;First Time Ever I Saw Your Face&quot;, &quot;Desperado&quot;, and &quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&quot; (a duet with Nick Cave, who wrote &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot; from the Solitary Man Album).  However, these songs have been done by so many artists so often, that Cash's versions, while outstanding, are not as innovative as previous efforts.  I'd heard he was considering adding John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot; to this album.  I wish he had.  I'd love to hear his take on the song and it would be very timely about now.<br />I was also a bit disappointed with the remakes of songs Cash had done previously, such as &quot;Give My Love to Rose&quot;, &quot;Sam Hall&quot;, &quot;Danny Boy&quot; and &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;.  These are great songs and Cash does them in new and somewhat interesting ways, but I would have preferred more original songs.  <br />&quot;Tear Stained Letter&quot; is the one up-tempo song on this album and a good one.  Lately Cash has seemed to end each album with a song that reminds us that the album could be his last.  This is no exception as a nice version of &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot; rounds out American IV.<br />Again, overall this is an excellent album, just not quite as good as American I-III.  Real Cash fans will want it in their collections, though casual fans may want to start with one of the previous efforts.

0393312836|5.0|Honestly, I have to say this before I begin my review. I wish people would STOP COMPLAINING about the Nadsat. I mean, I read this book as a junior in high school and a page into it I understood it completely. <BR>Anyway, after venting, here I go. Burgess is a genius and this book is definetly on my list of everything I must read twenty times before I die. Alex and his desire to destroy and corrupt is so perfectly like what every teenager, whether they admit it or not, feels like. The government, which has gone to the ultimate extreme to stop crime, is so real, I could picture the Minister and the Doctors myself. <BR>The transformation, which even I must admit, gets a little difficult to believe, is the perfect ending, which the Introduction explains so well, I can't even do justice to it or the book. It's well worth every second you spend on it, and generally I'm not a fan of science ficton.<BR>Item: as a photography student I'm obliged to mention the brilliant movie by Kubrick-- one of the gods of directing. It ends without the 21st, but it is so nearly as amazing as the book itself.
B00006M183|5.0|Simply put, this is the bands best effort.  While early &quot;fans&quot; want to sit around and wait for the next &quot;ten&quot; to come around, they are missing great rock n' roll.  Love Boat Captain, Save You, Cropduster, I am Mine... this album is a ten.

Still, it is a pretty  good overview of his career with the essential early ozzy and early sabbath hits all here.<br />I think if you have this album and speak of the devil, it is all of the live ozzy you would need.  the sound on the remastered album is really cleaned up, and the packaging has lots of interesting information

B00005JL7Q|4.0|I was so happy to see a main character that had it made and appreciated his position in life. I was ecstatic to see Hugh Grant's character acknowledge how easy his life was. The supporting actors were good also. The little boy was a great character with a very interesting personality. This film was very entertaining to watch. I myself am a collegiate bum. So I liked this film mostly because of Hugh Grant's character. If you are like me though, I'm sure you can relate. I rated this film four out of five stars.
B00005JL78|2.0|Based on a book, this thrill-a-hour movie didn't make any sense. Unresolved philosophical musings abound. Like, if the alien lady saw the future, then how did it not happen? Was she a liar? And who stole his kid? One of those three water aliens? I liked tihs movie less than AI.
B00003CXXM|3.0|I have a high expectation with spy films. James Bond and Mission Impossible films have raised the bar so much that good films like The Bourne Identity struggle to remain in the minds of the theater patrons (i.e. avid movie goers). This is a good action movie, and the plot is difficult enough to pass the test. But as I said previously, other spy films are just so good they make it hard for others to compete. As a result, it makes all other movies seem not so hot. I only gave Bourne Identity three stars because I have seen so many other superior spy films as well as action films. Next time Doug Limon will have to step it up a notch. Okay action earns 3 stars.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Keep you eyes peeled for young Matt Damon. He played the intrepid Bourne, but don't get the idea that he was playing around!! This was all for real.<br />Imagine waking up on a boat not knowing who you were or why you were there. Now imagine that the only thing you remember is karate.  Now imagine international intrigue and a beautiful girl. You've imagined the life of Mr. Bourne, played by the fantastic Matt Damon.<br />A little reminiscent of The Long Kiss Goodnight starring Gina Davis and Sam Jackson, but riveting still!<br />Buy this on DVD or VHS.
B000069HKH|3.0|thereare some really great tunes on here with great melodies.  there was of course some problems.  this may sound stupid but the thing that i had the most problem with was, on the second track there is a melody line that just doen't fit with the song.  it is not hard to hear at all.  also the greatness of the material is not consistant.  anyone can just listen to 5 tracks and be happy, therefore 3 stars.  and those stars are mostly for those 4 or 5 songs.  the best track on the entire album by far is the 3rd track.
B00005B36H|5.0|You have to be a sponge, absorbing it slowly, letting it seep into your pores, starting behind your eyes and then slithering down, curling your toes.  From the first track, (The Grudge), you feel the almost tribal rhythm in your gut and you have to move something, even if it's just a finger to tap along.  Tool has always found something diverse with each album, but Lateralus plunges even deeper.  It is not an album to be taken lightly. It is spiritual. It's an emotional revival.  Avril Lavigne fans need not apply.  <BR>Don't throw Lateralus into your CD player on the way to visit grandma. Instead, I suggest you light some candles and settle in for some chaotic, spine tingling, beautifully placid sounds.  You have to digest it song for song.  Tool has truly put the art in art rock.  They managed to make a hard rock album brutishly beautiful.  It makes your stomach uneasy, your heart restless and you succumb to it. If you're not moved by it, you're dead.  The track Lateralus lures you in with a soft guitar riff sending you into serenity, with a slow build of the bass drum.  Before you know it you are slammed into a thunderous song. Then enter Maynard's almost angelic voice, comforting and guiding you through the maze.  Many of Lateralus' songs are at least eight minutes long, giving you more to hang on to and more to experience.  Danny Carey's expeditious and inexplicable drumming will leave you astounded.  And of course there is Maynard.  His voice is soothing and powerful, striking and gentle.  It is arguably the most beautiful male voice on earth.  He acts as a guide, moving you in and out at all the right times, making your eyes heavy, then alive again.  For over a year I listened to this album every day and still felt something new, something apprehending me every time.<BR> If extraordinary music isn't enough, this album possesses true poetry.  Never fluffy, Maynard writes lyrics you'll want to hang on your wall, lyrics you'll read over and over dissecting each succulent verse.  Maynard pours his soul into every word whether it's sentimental, infuriated, or derisive, though always honest.   Instead of me rambling on about his lyrics, it's best I give you an example:  I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm/ to feel connected enough to step aside and weep like a widow/ to feel inspired/ to fathom the power/ to witness the beauty/ to bathe in the fountain/ to swing on the spiral of our divinity and still be a human.   Every song is pure poetry.  One will make you close your eyes and smile, while another will bring you to tears.<BR> ...

B000088E6M|4.0|I just got this album and I think it's almost a classic. The best tracks are \\"In Da Club\\", \\"Patiently Waiting\\", \\"Many Men\\", \\"If I Can't\\", \\"Back Down\\", \\"Like My Style\\" and \\"Don't Push Me\\". These are really hot! No doubt \\"In Da Club\\" is one of the best I heard the last couple of years. You really should buy this album! Some songs I don't like (\\"Wanksta\\", \\"Heat\\", \\"PIMP\\"), that's why I didn't gave it 5 stars!
B00005JL2O|5.0|Bought the DVD to watch on my laptop with my friend who was sick in the hospital.  Needed a comedy to cheer us up.  I bought it only because neither of us had seen it before.<br />As it turned out, it was the best of the Austin Power trio of movies.  <br />The actual Goldmember character was boring -- and I still don't like Fat Bastard.  But Mini-Me was funnier than ever before, and I was unexpectedly surprised by Beyonce Knowles (who is also gorgeous in this movie).   Story is a bit weak -- but the individual scenes are truly funny.  Best ones are Austin Powers and the fountain, & Austin and Mini-me walking in the hall-way, and Austin and Mini-me in the doctor's office.  The final part of the doctor's office is classic -- laughed and laughed and laughed.<br />Highly recommended -- didn't expect I would like it so much.
0375414053|5.0|I fell in love with all of the charactors of this book...espically the children.  Allison Pearson is one the best authors that I have read in a while.
B0000797IO|1.0|Overall this is a bad movie. Sorry Jennifer* - It's not you're fault... &amp; I hope to see her in something alot better soon! <BR>Don't buy this one... rent it first... just in case you feel the same as I do after watching it.
B000002H2H|5.0|All of the songs are brilliantly written in lyrics and produced excellently.  They are each their own masterpiece, and although their consistent thrash relentlessness that are packed onto eight tracks have a tendancy to overwhelm you, it overwhelms you in a good way.  This CD is the definition of hard rock, with great songs such as 'Fade to Black' proving that slowness can rock without being repetitive, and entirely musical songs such as 'The Call of Ktulu' can amaze you and blow you away.  Although the storytelling is brutal, it is impossible to not like this CD.
B000088E6M|4.0|It's a good cd, at times even brilliant.  But, it's no classic in the vein of Reasonable Doubts or Illmatic or Ready to Die.  Several songs (P.I.M.P., If I Can't, 21 Questions, Blood Hound) motivated me to push the skip button.  Track 14, 21 Questions, sounds way too LL Cool J for my taste.  For those who have any of 50's previous work, you will be disappointed to find out that 50 wasted two song slots by lifting 2 songs (U not Like Me and Life's on the Line) from a previous cd, \\"Guess who's back.\\"  Highlights on the album are the Megahertz produced Gotta Make it to Heaven, Heat-produced by Dr. Dre and is appropriately titled, Backdown-Dre, Patiently waiting-Eminem...well you get the point.  It's got a lot of good songs, but it's got enough songs that are JUST OKAY to keep it from classic status.  50 is unquestionably a victim of industry wide over-expectations.  But the expectations are warranted as he has given us a wealth of classic underground material.  I view this album as just a peak of things to come.  So, its good cd, well worth the cash, just not a classic.
0312958455|5.0|THE LAST COYOTE is the fourth Harry Bosch novel in Michael Connelly's series and the fourth one I've read. I haven't been disappointed yet. Connelly writes taut, suspenseful mysteries that keep you guessing right to the end. His background as an L.A. jornalist gives him the experience necessary to depict criminal investigations in a realistic and believable way. His stories are gritty and graphic, so be prepared for that, but he definitely keeps you turning the page to see what happens next.<br />In THE LAST COYOTE, Harry Bosch is on suspension and under psychiatric evaluation. With time on his hands, he decides to take up the investigation of an unsolved murder from thirty years ago. The victim was his mother.<br />Connelly's Harry Bosch series is great. THE LAST COYOTE is the fourth one for me and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all (if you're new to Harry Bosch, start with THE BLACK ECHO and read them in order). The characterization has depth, the plots are well-constructed and full of surprises, and Connelly's writing is well-executed. I recommend this, and all of the previous Harry Bosch books, very highly.
B00006JIA4|5.0|I bought this box set today, and I've been listening to it for hours.  My favorite disc is disc 1, but this is a great price for all that is comes with.  Really, I'm speechless.  I would have bought just the Greatest Hits (1) but I think it is a better deal to just buy the box set.  Can't get enough of Freddie Mercury's voice!
B000088E6M|5.0|This album is crazy. First of all, its selling like nuts. I had to go to four stores before I got my copy and I payed 16 dollars for it and I didnt get the dvd but I don't really care. I popped the cd in my car and man it was off the chains. I raised the volume on that sh** and believe me I was feeling it. The beats are crazy, the lyrics are crazy, damn it 50 cent is the man. You got to hear \\"Many Men\\". That track is hot. It's been stuck in my head all day. You got to hear \\"Patiently Waiting\\". 50 really does his thing on that one and Eminem just rips it. \\"What Up Gangsta\\" is also hot. Dre and Eminem really did a good job on production giving this album a wonderful touch. The whole album is bananas and it was worth the journey that I took to finally get it. 50 is king.
B00005JSGK|5.0|As in [[ASIN:0783230478 Hellfighters]], the Duke here explicates a little-known modern profession, in this case that of wild-animal catcher for zoos, film companies, laboratories, and the like.  He plays Sean Mercer, the senior \\"hunter\\" in a multinational group based somewhere in East Africa and working for the daughter (Giardon) of their old (French) boss.  Complications begin when The Indian (Cabot), one of the most experienced men in the group, is gored by a rhino, and continue when an arrogant young Frenchman (Blain) tries to muscle in as his replacement while he's in the hospital.  Then a newcomer (Martinelli) arrives at the farm: an Italian photojournalist who neglected to mention, during negotiations, that she was female.  She and Sean enact \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" for the rest of the film, while Pockets (Buttons), the company's driver, struggles to overcome his shy devotion to boss-lady Brandy.  Filmed on location, the movie includes some heart-pounding animal-chase scenes (watch those rhinos!), splendid scenery (you'll gape when you see the open-air well used by the Masai), and liberal humor (Dallas and the baby elephants, her \\"adoption\\" by the local native tribe, and Pockets' scheme to bag several hundred monkeys in one go).  This epic comedy-adventure should be popular with all ages.

1573229725|4.0|I think my head is still spinning. But wow!! What a book! I was intrigued from the first chapter and it just got better and better. Every time I thought I had a character figured out, something happened and I was proven wrong. This is a beautifully written story filled with mystery, love and betrayl.I loved every minute of it.
0792839625|2.0|This was one of the last movie musicals, until recently, for good reason. It's terrible. The genre was on it's last leg, and this movie put the final nail in the coffin. After &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; the movie, the only musicals you saw on screen were made for television. The soundtrack replaced the musical. But this was the first musical I ever saw and it did introduce me musicals, so I have to give it credit for that. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to look back on it today and reflect on how terrible the movie is compared to the countless other movie and theatrical musicals I've seen. The music is wonderful but that had nothing to do with the filmmakers, so they can't get credit for that. Since the music is so great I would suggest you buy the original cast recording from Broadway, and wait until it comes to your city. If you feel the need see the movie, rent it, don't buy it.
0066214122|5.0|This book can be summed up in three ways: very,very, scary. I personally love survival horror books and sci-fi books that are not out of the ballpark and the only man who can do this is Crichton. The suspense is so thrilling for the fact that each enemy is different than the last and the plot never gets boring while rushing with excitment and suspence till the delicious last drop. Also what you have to love about Crichton is he does not ask WHAT IF he says THIS IS HOW. You can tell through his remarkable quoations that he has really thourghly researched every aspect in this book. He sums all of his ideas into a thought provoking essay in front. This book is not for the weak of heart or mind!
B00005OAIE|5.0|I agree with many of the reviewers that John Mayer's true guitar ability got clouded out in the production of this record.  However anyone doubting his ability as a guitarist need only listen to him play \\"Neon\\" acoustically, just him.  The guy is amazing.  As a songwriter myself, it's easy to see that Mayer knows what he's doing from a composing standpoint.  He obviously knows his music theory and his technical understanding shows in the songs he writes.  It's nice to hear something different than the power chord(stuff) that makes the radio these days.  Give this guy a chance before lumping him in with the gone-in-two-weeks pop rock on the radio.
0800187792|5.0|If you hate family movies that are funny, then this movie (Fly Away Home) is not a comedy. And I don't know if drama is a good word for this movie either. While the kid's mom dies in the opening of the film. But does happens so fast that is just does seem to be much drama. Jeff Daniels and Anna Paquin (The Piano) stars is in this movie who teaches baby geese to fly south. Anna's parents were dicorved (I guess) when this movie opens.
B000088E6M|5.0|All fans of true hip-hop/gangsta rap have been waiting about five years for somebody to come along and knock the rap world on it's %$#. The wait is over. 50 cent has come along and will finally take rap back to a level where it was in the early & mid 90's. This is the most exciting moment for a hip-hop fan since the release of Makavelli's last album(while he was still alive). I've only heard about half of the cd, but this is truly, truly a masterpiece. Eminem is probably the most talented lyrical tactician out right now, but(sadly, because of the color of his skin) he will never be able to get truly gritty on the mic. People, if you're even a little bit interested in rap, invest in this album, you will not be sorry you did. Plus he busts on them \\"wankstas\\" for murda, inc., and that should be enough to make you want to own this cd.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus is a phenomenal album, its just not quite Aenima. Tool's second record is a masterpiece, but that is another review.<br />Lateralus is a huge scape of music. At 74 minutes, its long.  DOn't let this turn you away.  The band does not rush anything on the album and it must be listened to many times, so if you are in the mood for some thought-provoking music, this is a good CD to check out.<br />The songs on this album are decidely more progressive than Tool's previous efforts. The album begins with the 8 minute, throat grabbing \\"The Grudge\\". Danny Carey's prowess takes center stage on this song, and on most of the album.  Tool shied away from the filler tracks on this album, with only 3, but these (Eon Blue Apocalypse, Mantra, and Faaip De Oiad) all fit much better than Aenima's transition songs. \\"Tick and Leeches\\" is the only song which really harkens back to Tool's younger days. It begins with a ferocious drum solo and moves into a very, very angry Maynard. This song is the exception though, as most of the album is very spiritual, and talks of healing and discovery. <br />Songs:<br />1. The Grudge - 8 minutes of hard, hard rock.  From the opening drum and guitar riff it hooks you in and takes you on a ride.  It really makes brings you into the album as a whole.<br />2. Eon Blue Apocalypse - A Segue into the Patient, a very cool little guitar song.<br />3. The Patient - An emotional song about...being patient.  It's my least favorite song on the album, however it is still good.  It is a slower pace, but still carries the underlying aggressiveness of Tool.<br />4. Mantra - Buddhist chant segue between The Patient and Schism.  AS I said above the segues link the songs together much more effectively than on Aenima.  It is a very interesting track to listen to.<br />5. Schism - A catchy (dare I say that about a Tool song?) song about a broken relationship.  The musicianship on this song is amazing.  It got tons of radio airplay because of the almost hooky riffin it.  It still clocks in at over 6 minutes.  A great song, one of the best on the album.<br />6. Parabol - A short intro to Parabola, Parabol is a quiet song with just guitar and lead singer Maynard almost whispering.  Feedback ends it and transitions into Parabola.<br />7. Parabola - Another song that got a lot of radio airplay.  The drumming here is superb.  It is over 6 minutes as well.  It has a great positive set of lyrics and really is a great rock song.<br />8. Ticks and Leeches - The angriest song on the album, however it still sounds like it belongs.  The drum solo beginning is amazing and Maynard has never sounded angry than on his screams in this song.  This song really rips the record industry and lawayers a new one.<br />9. Laterlis - The title track is a great song, which was released cut for time on radio.  It was not a good version if you did hear it.  This version is great.  It is 9 minutes long and the drumming is amazing again.  Tool prove how great of songwriters they are on this song.  It rocks you and then comforts and rocks again.  Amazing.<br />10. Disposition - This song begins the 'Triad' as many Tool fans have come to call this and the two tracks following.  This is a song unto itself, however it acts as an intro to Reflection.  It is very quiet and reflective with some beautiful guitar and vocal work.<br />11. Reflection - At 11 minutes it is the longest song on the cd.  It is a great song, however it is a lot better live.  On the cd, it sometimes drags and lacks the energy of the rest of this album, but if listened to with Disposition and Triad (the following track) it is a great song.  I cannot even listen to the 'Triad' apart now.<br />11. Triad - An instrumental ending to the 'Triad' and an amazing song on its own.  The drumming is great, and the playing is great, it almost has a middle eastern feel.  This is Tool at it's best.<br />12. Faaip de Oiad - A somewhat hidden track.  It is a phone call, and then a mystery.  Very ominous,I won't ruin it.<br />Lateralus is a great departure from Tool's more aggressive days, and musically it is far superior to their other albums. However, for my money, Aenima is their masterpiece, and the emotional power on it is unequaled. Lateralus is not the point to start with if you are new to Tool. If you like Tool, of course buy it, if you jsut an intelligent music fan, its still amazing music. It is the best record to come out since the year 2000. At least until the next Tool album.
B000002542|5.0|This first effort from Journey is a fascinating look at a different type of prog rock. They don't use british classical touches at all, its more latin/jazz/hard rock. This is a very interesting workout for all of the instruments; singing is optional. Not that Rolie had a bad voice. This is when the musicians just played, before they were replaced by more radio friendly types.
6305428042|5.0|Though some Pagons and Wiccans may find \\"Hocus Pocus\\" to be insulting to their religion, it is really not. It is just another little harmless Disney gem that was meant to entertain. And boy, did it EVER!<br />PLOT SUMMARY: The story of \\"Hocus Pocus\\" revolves around the three evil witches--Winifred (Bette Midler), Sarah (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Mary (Kathy Najimy) Sanderson of Colonial Salem, Massachusetts. They are hung to death by the townspeople after they supposibly killed a young girl and her older brother, Thackery Binks. But in reality, they sucked the life out of the young girl to make themselves younger and more beautiful, and turned Thackery into a black cat. Right before they died however, they promised the townspeople that they would come back to life and suck all the lives out of children in Salem when a virgin lights the black candle in their home. Flashfoward to preasent day, Salem. Max Dennison (Omri Katz) is a rebellious teenager who recently moved to the town with his family from Los Angeles. On Halloween night, Max is forced to take his kid sister, Dani (a young Thora Birch), out trick-or-treating. While out (and after being bullied by some neighborhood guys), Max and Dani arrive at a very large house. It happens to be the home of Allison (Vinessa Shaw), Max's new crush. In school that day, Max and Allison's teacher told them the story of the Sanderson sisters, which Max didn't believe. To impress Allison, Max suggests that they go to the home of the Sanderson sisters so he can light the black candle and prove that the story is false. Both Allison and Dani, who strongly believe in the story, agree to go. Once at the Sanderson house, Max is about to light the candle when they are stopped by a strange black cat who can talk--it's Thackery Binks, who warns Max not to light the candle. Max, however, ignores Thackery and lights it anyway, bringing the sisters back to life so they can finish their sinister scheme. Now, it's up to Max, Allison, Dani, and Thackery to finish the sisters off once and for all.<br />MY OVERALL THOUGHTS: I found this film extremely hilarious and entertaining as a kid, and I still do today. Excellent acting performances by the entire cast--Midler, Parker, and Najimy are particular standouts, as well as Katz. The special effects are great, and there's a wonderful storyline. The music is haunting, too. Wish I could find the soundtrack CD. Though slightly predictable, it is still a lot of fun. The DVD lacks though, big-time. Only drawback--should have added special features, at least a trailer or commentary track. If you want thrills and laughs on Halloween, look no further than \\"Hocus Pocus\\"! The DVD is available in wide screen format.<br />I highly recommend \\"Hocus Pocus\\".<br />Score:<BR>100/100<BR>A+
0066214122|4.0|A remarkable book. He still has problems with plot and character but he has a gift for projecting the present into the future. I have read quite a bit about nanotechnology in the science and investing press, but I didn't have a mental image of the creation and actuality of nano-things.  Now, after reading Crichton's worst-case scenario, I have a hard time getting nano- out of my mind.
B000065V41|4.0|I love the Muppets, ask anyone of my friends...and I love their interpretation of the classic.  I personally get tired of remake after remake of old classics, but when the Muppets re-did this movie, it was if I was six years old again watching my favorite Muppet pals.  <br />Michael Caine is wonderful as Scrooge, Gonzo is a great Charles Dickens and Kermit is a heartfelt Bob Cratchit.  <br />The DVD has some great extra features, primarily an interview with Brian Henson, in which he is joined by Gonzo and Rizzo the Rat.  There are also some snippits of an interview with Caine as he relays his first experience of working with the Muppets, great stuff.
B000050IE6|5.0|From The Moor to White Cluster, this album takes you on a melodic ride that is more creative and complete than any metal album I have listened to.  Moonlapse Vertigo, The Moor, and Serenity Painted Death are incredible. Be warned though, Opeth is not for people with short attention spans.  It is nearly impossible to get into Opeth the first time you spin the CD.  It takes months for Opeth to climb up the rankings of your favorite bands.  If you like metal, I garauntee you that Opeth will be one of your favorite bands within 6 months.  Someone in another review said, \\"Opeth is like a fine wine,\\" and they couldn't be more correct.  Opeth seems like they just play and don't worry about things like song length.  The song determines its own length, whether its 2 minutes or 20 minutes, as opposed to a top 40 CD that comes out of a factory with every song taliored down to 3 minutes so it fits nicely into the morning countdown on the radio.  Still life is the album to get if you want to give Opeth a chance, ...  Also give Deliverance, Morningrise, and Blackwater Park a listen to.
B00007CVSH|3.0|Curious trend this, whereby italian operas in major centres are now commonly  cast without a single italian singer, at least in the main roles. Whether that obeys to an acute scarcity of competent, world-class Italian singers remains to be seen, maybe globalisation arrived to the arts with its full impact. Any way, this release is typical of its source, very well produced and with interesting and pertinent supplementary material, a feature other publishers ought to imitate.<br />The end result is uneven, though, in spite of the stunning Moshinsky production for The Royal Opera, a significant improvement over his previous Australian effort which has been variously broadcast over world television and seen in many countries. The main problem lies with Cura's Manrico, caught here in a problematic evening none the less the loud cheering and applause at the end courtain calls; visually he certainly looks the part. I can't say whether he's going through recurrent vocal problems or if this was an isolated incident, but what we have here is a very wobbly vocal production that to me marred an otherwise wonderful night at the opera (London, 3rd May 2002), where with  \\"tricks of the trade\\" Cura tried, sometimes more successfully than others, to conceal the fact that his vocal instrument was in substandard condition; alarm lights up for the listener from the very \\"Deserto sulla terra\\" moment. Top honours are shared by Hvorostovsky and Naef, in their respective roles of the Count and Azucena. The siberian's is one of the most effective impersonations of the Count I've ever seen, acted with utter conviction and bravado, sung with impeccable and effectively nuanced vocal production, velvety when it calls for, full voiced when pertinent; no wonder then that \\"Il balen del tuo sorriso\\" brings the house down -I'd add that young italian baritones aspiring to tackle the rôle ought well study this portrayal-. Nor less can we say about the Azucena, the part chosen by Naef to show her proficiency at the ROH for the first time. Looking perhaps youngish for the part, especially in her scenes when she shares the stage with Cura, her powerful mezzo voice soars majestically over the Covent Garden stage, bringing memories of earlier, italian famous exponents of the part. Villarroel's voice is perhaps not strong enough for Leonora but she in the end acquits herself quite successfully, not a great Leonora but satisfactory all round none the less; her pianissimi are exquisite. The Ferrando equals Cura in wobbliness, the Inés seems cool and detached. The chorus and orchestra are in top form, Rizzi's tempi in the fast side, sometimes unnecessarily so, or maybe uncalled for (I went back to Carlo Maria Giulini's essay on the subject of this work's suggested tempi, originally marked by Verdi himself on his score, which the illustrious Italian conductor studied closely whilst preparing his excellent audio-only recording made in Rome some 20 years ago for DG; the essay is published in the booklet that accompanies it and is recommended reading for those who own the album).<br />In sum: peaks and valleys, but an all-round satisfactory experience, well directed for television by Brian Large and very well recorded, sound-wise, like most BBC Opus Arte releases I've come across. If you happen to live in a city which is a major opera centre, you may well experience the work live and in a similarly good -or even better- performance sometime or the other, with even perhaps at least some of these same singers and thereby doing without this album perfectly well. But if, like most of us, you don't, you won't go wrong by ordering this DVD, which for a fraction of the price of a decent seat at the Metropolitan Opera or the Chicago Lyric Opera -and certainly at Covent Garden, where the performance was recorded and good tickets go over the £100 barrier-, renders all round satisfaction, with the caveats referred to above.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|In the last few years of prefabricated, corporate, guaranteed-to-sell pop music, we've had boy bands and girl bands, so why not a girl-girl band? Enter T.A.T.U., individually known as Lena Katina and Julia Volkova, two teenage girls from Russia marketed as sex-kitten lesbian lovers. (Think of a younger Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera doing a duet with less clothing and more fondling.) For the record, the girls deny the lesbian part, but they do claim to love each other. ... <br />In yet more proof that sex sells, and that lesbians sell even better, T.A.T.U. has already topped the charts in Europe, and they are now showing up on radio stations here. (Who ever thought the Russians would invade America with fake lesbians?) Their video \\"All the Things She Said\\" has already become controversial for showing the girls kissing, but as any PR flack will tell you, there's no such thing as bad publicity.<br />Once you get past the teenage-lesbian marketing ploy, the actual music is not much to write home about. It's really not much more than the standard over-synthesized pounding-bass music which will certainly get heavy play in dance clubs. As is the norm with such music, the vaguely suggestive lyrics -- the usual lovesick female singer pouring her heart out, but to a girl instead of a boy -- are usually all but inaudible. It's not good or bad, it's just bland.<br />The girls' Russian manager and handlers have clearly studied American pop music for tips on how to manufacture a hit group, and they have learned well. T.A.T.U. is but the latest example of how clever marketing makes actual musical talent less and less important. They will, of course, make a bundle.
0060506989|4.0|(quote from Plato) We Were Soldiers Once...and Young is an awesome book. The savagery and terror of the battle at Ia Drang is told in a gritty, heartfelt realism that explodes with a flash far more vivid than any movie could hope to strive. Their story told by their commander, the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry's fight against the NVA in November 1965 glows with bitter, effervescent glory. We Were Soldiers Once...and Young is a monument to anyone who has ever fought, and a monument to anyone who has ever lived. Its emotion will sting your eyes, and if you react otherwise to the book, it just might be a war cry.<BR>\\"We killed for each other, we died for each other, and we wept for each other. And in time we came to love each other as brothers...this is our story and theirs. For we were soldiers once, and young\\" (2-5)
B00003CXMG|5.0|First, this is an excellent film. Second, it's an authentic portrayal of life in the early 70s, the rock band culture, and growing up during that period - at least for me. I was in a rock band, and I saw myself and the people I knew at every turn. My goodness. This was like looking into a mirror that shows the past. This film is a work of art.
0385484518|5.0|I was required to read this my senior year in college, and was dreading starting the rather large stack required for this class.  I started in on some boring book about what I can't remember and decided I needed a break from the monotony.  I picked up this book and for the rest of the afternoon, I could NOT put it down.  <br />The book shows you how you should learn to appreciate the little things in life, like being able to tie your own shoes, and having control over your day to day bodily duties (ie: showering, using the bathroom etc etc), as well as live your life to it's fullest!  Don't let a day go by where you find at least one happy thing somewhere, it doesn't matter what it is...there are bigger issues in life to worry about than if your sweater shrank in the dryer!  Imagine having to have someone wipe your butt! (I'm quoting the book here...)  Do you think that anyone is really ready for that to happen once we are old enough to do it for ourselves?<br />I have recommended this to numerous people and have given it as gifts to many others.  A great book that everyone should read at least once in their lifetime.

B000001Y2U|3.0|Marilyn Manson is an artist who's frequently misunderstood by many people, but I don't think this album is that offensive, especially compared to Portrait of an American Family. At first listen, I really didn't understand what all the controversy is about...he looks like a freak, yes, and has undeniable influence on a lot of teenagers who saw the videos for \\"The Beautiful People\\" and \\"Tournique\\" on MTV and ended up dressing like him, and he has said a lot of things that make John Lennon's controversial jesus comment sound quite harmless, but he also has some insightful thoughts about society nonetheless. Backed up with the harsh industrial music, the lyrics can sound threatening and scary, but when I actually read the lyrics by themselves, I was suprised at how intelligent and collected some of them are, especially compared the crude and hilairous \\"Cake and Sodomy\\". Not ALL the lyrics struck me this way, though, because some of them are actually really stupid. As for the music itself, it's VERY noisy, but noisy in a very organized, melodic fashion. Only problem is that it hasn't aged well since 1996. I mean this came out the same year as Tool's Aenima, which still sounds way ahead of it's time. Whatever, I know a lot of Manson fans won't agree with me, but hey I loved this album when I was 14, but now i'm 18 it sounds...okay, I guess. It has REALLY good production, and a unique sound to it, and the concept is admittedly very well-thought-out and well orchestrated. And at least it's unique! I still can't imagine what would drive him to blatantly rip off David Bowie and Faith No More (listen to FNM's \\"Be Aggressive\\" and then listen to Manson's far inferior rehash \\"mObscene\\" to see what I mean) years later.

0380725398|5.0|In \\"Myself When Young\\", author Daphne DuMaurier tells of a riding expedition on Bodmin Moors where lost and tired, she put up at a local hostelry called Jamaica Inn. \\"It was my first sight of the place that would later grip my imagination . . . a temperance house in 1920, it had been a coaching stop in the old days, and I thought of the travelers in the past who must have sought shelter there on the wild November nights, watched by the local moorland folk. No temperance house then, but a bar where the little parlor was, the drinking deep and long, fights breaking out, the sounds of oaths, of men falling.\\"<br /><br />And grip her imagination it did!<br /><br />Du Maurier brings to life all the sounds and sights she imagined she saw on that day at a wayside inn with so much history. The lonely local, the brooding weather, the harsh tors looming over the moors and the bog, all make for what is now the almost trite accoutrements to any Gothic melodrama. But in Du Maurier's expert hands and imagination, the story that evolves could never be thought hackneyed.<br /><br />Mary Yellen, a staunch working class young lady must leave her beloved farm on southern coast of Cornwall for the bleaker northern side. Here she will live at lonely Jamaica Inn with her mother's sister Patience and her innkeeper husband, Joss Merlyn. When she arrives, Mary, who prides herself on her good sense, intrinsic goodness and her willingness to work, finds her situation at the inn in dire opposition to anything in which she believes. Her heart breaks when she discovers her aunt has become a shadow of her once frivilous self, broken by the drunken Josh and his rude occupation. Mary's dream of travelers stopping at the inn and taking the usual friendly custom aburptly dissipates when she realizes the inn is no longer in use, but like her aunt, is just a shell of what it once was. Most distressing of all, she concludes that Joss's business is a treacherous and nefarious one which instead of commanding the respect of the local villagers and townspeople, causes them to turn away in helpless fear and disgust. Her guilt by association follows quite naturally and Mary vacillates between what she knows is right and her love of her childlike aunt. In her mind, her future spins out before her, likely to trail in the wake of her aunt's disastrous path.<br /><br />The light of hope shines in the appearance of the landlord's brother, Jem. A much younger man than Joss, but similar in looks, Mary can well imagine what had enticed her aunt so many years ago. In spite of herself, she finds she has feelings for Jem that she must put aside as she comes to terms with what she must do for her aunt and her community. Like Du Maurier's other female heroines, Mary eventually succumbs to the world of men; she is dependent, knows it and comes to terms with her lot only by accepting her fate.<br /><br />The story is told in the third person; we eventually discover the secret of Jamaica Inn as Mary does. On all levels, the story and its telling are superior to other books of this genre. Often dismissed as a romantic escape, the novel is nothing of the sort---it rather depicts the marital relationship and other man/woman situations with a violence that is disturbing.  Mary does not find romance, she accepts that Jem is no better than another strong male.  Another aspect of Du Maurier's fanatastic Cornwall comes alive as it did in her other novels, Rebecca, Frenchman's Creek, My Cousin Rachel and The House of the Strand. As a backup to the book, rent the Jane Seymour mini-series of the same name. The film representation doesn't really do justice to the literature or theme of Jamaica Inn, it relies instead on the brooding atmosphere and desperation of the heroine's plight rather than the true horror of the man/woman relationships.<br /><br />I have read this book many times, but I find the best way to enjoy it is on unabridged audio--acted by a trained reader brings the words alive and forces you to listen (instead of skipping over) to the passages describing the moors.(instead of skipping over) to the passages describing the moors.

0684833395|5.0|This is my title: and I believe it.  The greatest novel of all time.<br />The reviews below will doubtlessly get further into the more complicated issues--the themes, the meaning of certain characters, the fractured chronology--but the fact remains that this will be, for a great number of people, the most profound work they ever read.<br />Catch-22 is a riot from start to finish.  There are plenty of hilarious books, but few that will make you laugh as often or as embarrassingly loud as this one.  The book, however, is not just about comedy--that's just another level on top of the heartfelt sadness that consumes the book's greatest heroes (Yossarian and Dunbar).  The true meaning lies somewhere between the moral decisions of every character of the book--Yossarian's decision to live through the war or die trying; Dunbar's decision to spare all innocents at all costs; Col. Cathcart's decision to win the war at all costs; Doc Daneeka's decision to complain about the war while doing nothing to counter the immoral acts taking place all around him.<br />It's a book for rebels; fine.  It's an anti-government book, anti-war book; fine.  It's hysterical, depressing, life-affirming, epic, fascinating, and, at a basic, human level, true.  Fine.<br />The fact remains: Catch-22 has more to offer than any book I have ever read.  Try the first chapter and you'll know it's for you; it's the fastest 463 pages you'll ever read; the world's greatest combination of comedy and tragedy in one work.<br />I can only gush so long.  Just read the ... thing.
B0000004V2|5.0|oh man, what a great, great album. Just really good innovative brit-pop. It's obvious that each and every one of them were extremely accomplished musically and the songwriting is flawless. Very catchy vocal hooks, a bright, crisp and clear sound, well-thought out chord changes and melodies, it's got everything! Well it's actually not completely perfect...the only bummer has to be the annoying \\"Don't Stop\\" which sounds like a backwards \\"Waterfall\\", a song that comes directly before it...but it's just a minor distraction. Otherwise every song is a winner and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005YXZH|4.0|I bought this as it was on many recommended lists.  It is certainly different.  I don't know how often I'll listen to it, but I can say that when I do, I'll have to listen to it beginning to end.<br />Not your ordinary album.  Truly different and intruiging.
B00003CXE7|3.0|As a historian, I found the inaccuracy of this film bearable as I have seen a lot worse, and we have to have a good story or it's not worth watching, right?<br />However I found that the film was too long, especially the battle scenes and Russell Crowe's Aussie accent really got on my nerves.  I don't think he deserved the oscar for this role, he should have got it for the insider but that is the way it goes.<br />And I think by far the best performance was that of Joaquin Phoenix (Emperor Commodus), who not only looked like an overfeed ceasar, but convincinly played a madman obbsessed with winning the affection of both the populace and his sister and yet tormented by rage and jeleousy.  The final mockery is when his body is left unheeded in the colosseum while maximus is given an emperor's send off.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Good nu-metal album.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Though t.A.T.u. seem to be playing the \\"lesbian\\" angle of their personas up as much, if not more, than their actual music, said music presented on their debut is actually pretty good, disposable though it may seem.  First single \\"All The Things She Said\\" is a nice, propulsive blend of Europop and techno, with a slight alternative edge.  Other highly addictive tracks include \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", \\"Show Me Love\\", and a love-it-or-hate-it cover of the Smiths' \\"How Soon Is Now?\\"(high camp, though not nearly as bad as you would think).  Vocally,their chirpy, untrained singing might suggest the second coming of Bananarama, and their stilted English might grate on some.  But for pure ear candy, it beats the pants off anything that's come out of American teen popsters of late--anyone dying to hear Britney's \\"I Love Rock 'N'Roll\\" karaoke disaster again?  Didn't think so.

B000088E6M|5.0|It's hittin' hard.  Ya' heard me.
B00005JKZT|3.0|I can see JRR Tolkien rolling over and over in his grave.  Purist that he was, I doubt he would have approved of the first film, but this one would have killed him (if he weren't already dead).  All of the epic grandeur, the grand scope and stunning developments of plot and characters--gone.  What we are left with is a Hollywood adaptation--basically, something that sells well.<br />First, for what I liked about the movie.  The effects were absolutely stunning, and I thought the Ents' assault on Isengard was one of the greatest special effect action sequences ever.  Helm's Deep was pretty good, too, though almost all the characters were in places other than where they are in the books. And Gandalf's fight with the Balrog was awesome. Had there never been a LOTR book, I would have loved this movie. <br />Now, for the bad.  Knowing what I do about the books, having grown up delighted again and again by the incredible power of the story, I couldn't help but let out a sigh for what might have been.  What might have been if Peter Jackson was as big a Tokien fan as he says he is.  What might have been if Jackson would have realized that Tolkien possessed a genius for storytelling that he never will.  <br />Like many others, I was abhorred to see Faramir turned into a bad guy.  The whole purpose of his character in the book is to draw a noble contrast to Boromir.  The whole montage of Arwen and the Elves leaving middle-earth (which there is NO way Elrond would ever do, since he is guarding one of the three elvish rings and will wait till the One is destroyed before setting sail) was nothing short of ridiculous, not to mention completely unnecessary.  <br />Gimli has been reduced to a babbling buffoon, good only for comic relief and modeled (in my opinion) after the donkey in Shrek.  Frodo has turned into a Freudian nightmare, proving that the ring, in fact, makes you more crazy than evil.  Sauron must be a nutcase.  Eomer barely plays a part, and Theoden is a stubborn oldcoot.<br />I loved the Fellowship of the Ring--I thought Jackson did a wonderful job.  But I was so disappointed with this one that I can't hardly bear to watch the first film anymore.  It IS entertaining, I'll admit that much, but for anyone that admired Tolkien for his the sheer power of his narrative, this movie will not do.  We're just going to have to keep waiting for the faithful movie version of The Lord of the Rings.
B000003BDJ|5.0|When you think The Rolling Stones, you think \\"The Greatest Rock N' Roll Band Ever.\\" The Beatles would most likely claim that title, but the Stones come in a close second. Although I have never been a huge fan of their music, I can easily understand why they are considered so great.  But, don't get me wrong, I do like their music and think it's far, far, far, far, far, far better than today's [stuff]. Great collection of the Stones' greatest songs and some of the greatest rock songs written. So, go pick this one up. Easily 5/5
6300138798|5.0|This movie changed my life when I was 16!<br />The new DVD looks very nice, but they made a lot of strange decisions while remixing the audio that REALLY annoy me. So I still prefer this original VHS release. <br />Also, this version has 3 songs (Cities, Big Business &amp; I Zimbra) that weren't included in the theatrical version, but never should have been cut out in the first place. I think the film works even better with them in there as part of the flow, and on the DVD you can only watch them separately as bonus tracks. <br />So I highly recommend you grab this version while you can.
079284209X|5.0|This is a film which exceeds all expectations, with a clever plot which improves with multiple viewings, one of the few films to do so. And the car chases are sooooo fantastic. Anyone who falls asleep in this film should rreturn to their [blah] disney films with a plot for their mental age, 'cos this is obviously too complicated for them. Even with the main characters being Irish this does not hamper the plot or decrease the viewability. Thsi is one film you MUST see.
B000062XFG|3.0|&quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation's&quot; second season begins with Riker's new beard, Geordi's promotion, a new (but not better) doctor, and Wesley the weasel deciding to stay aboard. Sounds like a mixed bag to me. The season premiere &quot;The Child&quot; doesn't have much in the way of excitement, and Marina Sirtis wasn't quite as good yet to carry the episode, but it looks great with some neat looking exterior shots and an introduction of Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan the bartender. The from there the season continued with a few gems (&quot;Elementary Dear Data,&quot; &quot;Q Who?&quot;) and a few more missteps (&quot;The Outrageous Okona,&quot; &quot;Pen Pals,&quot; &quot;Shades of Gray).<br />We meet the Borg in a great episode with Q, played by the always-dependable John DeLancie, Data butts heads with a holodek version of Moriarty, Riker finally comes to terms with his father, and Wesley is given his first command. With a writer's strike hindering the production of the episodes, many of them feel rushed. A few potentially cool ideas like &quot;Contagion&quot; and &quot;Peak Performance&quot; feel lacking in suspense or direction.<br />Ah, but the cast is perfect and carries out each episode wonderfully. Even the terrible stock-footage show &quot;Shades of Gray&quot; is handled well by the cast. However, the season lacks two major characters from season one: Tasha Yar and Dr. Crusher. While Yar can't come back (she died late in season one), the good doctor does return in season three and she's welcome. Diana Mulduar is a talented actress, but Dr. Pulaski just isn't compatable with the other characters.<br />My recommendation is to get season two only if you're trying to collect them all. It's not the perfect season and there's much better ones out there.
0440539811|2.0|First off, let me first say that I'm not one of those reviewers who say this book is total garbage. Wilson & Shea are clearly well-read and have quite a breadth of knowledge. <BR> Much of the facts the use to establish the framework are true (Important exception [among several]: The Great Seal of the United States on the back of the dollar does have 13 levels, but there are NOT 72 [or is did they say 73?] sections in the pyramid- there are less than 64, and it doesn't occur to them the 13 stands for the number of colonies that became the US after the revolution! Also, that is not a marijuana plant being held in the eagle's left talon. I understand the book isn't meant to be taken seriously, but the part 've mentioned is possibly the most idiotic part of the book.), even though the plots that are based on them quite often go off the deep end.<BR> I laughed my buns off when the reviewer below actually thought the George Washington \\"pot farms\\" were RAW's invention. Even though it's not mentioned in the book, Thomas Jefferson also smoked it, and he even developed a sort of \\"cotton gin\\" type device for processing it!<BR> There are many other examples, but the weaknesses of the book and the authors are sufficient to knock it down to two stars. The book sloppily written- the plot has a tendency to ramble.There is little to no character devolopemnt, and when it does occur it is presented unrealistically. There are too many characters, and unlike Shakespeare's Julius Caesar, they aren't very functional. In addition, it's pretty clear that RAW and Robert Shea are classic cases of being intelligent people who know a lot, yet have little or no comprehension of how thing operate (which explains most of their inanities). <BR> The Stream-of-Conscousness(sic) style of writing is abused in a way that blurs determination of context for the reader. In the typewritten format of the book- not in the novel itself, mind you, but in the way the text is actually arranged on the pages of thebook- there is no horizontal line to seperate(sic) distict sections within chapters, like in most decently written books. <BR> RAW would probably claim that this is becuase it would destroy the continuity of the novel (a suprising cocern to me, given the Battlefield Earthisms that pervade the plot). However, I believe the true reason for this is due to the fact that the huge need for these divisions in the text to make the book more readable would substantially (sic?) increase the physical number pages required fo the book (by probably 40 or more), and was avoided to use less paper (and therefore keep the book cheaper!) for marketing purposes. <BR> There is a Battlefield Earth like tendency to create major plot threads, but diverge off when creativity runs out. For example, the Ferdinand Poo plot thread that dominates the begining of the 1st Book was clearly intended by the authors to figure heavily in the later plot of the book, but end up ignoring it for several hundred pages before mentioning it again. <BR> It's clearly superior to Hubbard's BE in terms of humor, and I died laughing at some of the more whack inside jokes- like the fact that the reviewer in the book who gives \\"Illuminatus!\\" a poor review, Epicene \\"Eppy\\" Wildeblood is actually an open parody of Oscar Wilde, the not-quite-hidden revelation that the God's Lightning affiliate KCUF, is F--- reversed, and (I basically died for half hour when I cuaght this more obscure one, at least for non-punk rock fans) the presense of JAMs in the book and the reinterpretation of the phrase \\"Kick out the jams, brothers and sisters!\\" This is a quotation from the band MC5 (there's the law of fives again). The quotation is kind of ironic in light of the fact that RAW is actually unaware that \\"Kick out the jams, brothers and sisters!\\" is actually quotes an edited sourse record and that in the unedited version of that song, the vocalist shouts the phrase \\"motherf---ers\\" in place of \\"brothers and sisters\\". What a doofus!<BR> I think the most hilarious moment in the book is near the begining of the 1st chapter of the 3rd book, when they're naming the bands in the Woodstock Europa Festival. My first take was, with the exception of the five groups in that list that were actually real (Steppenwolf, Mick Jagger, Joan Baez, the Zombies and Nirvana), the whole rigamarole looked like a list of names for bad indie rock bands. A side note for you fools who aren't into prog-rock: Long before \\"Nevermind\\" broke No. 1 in the U.S., in the late sixties and then the seventies Nirvana was the name of a post-psychedelic experimental rock group from the U.K. and probably the band refered to in the list. It wouldn't be out of character for the author, given the geist of the book. Same reason I know RAW probably knows the Zombies were a real band- he at least heard THE TIME OF THE SEASON! (Laughs without mercy at the puzzled book review lurkers).<BR> Anyway, I've read the whole book except for most of Book III and most of the appendices (the most coherently written part of the book, ironically). It's pretty clear to me that despite actually being pretty funny, and having well-written sex scenes among other things, RAW & company (at least at this stage- the book was written 30 years ago) have no idea how to write round, dynamic characters, with realistic character development, and need to take grade-school level courses in plot developement. It wouldn't hurt this book one bit to SIMPLIFY the plot. <BR> I don't regret reading the book and I intend to finish it, and I'm glad that there are books in this field that are far superior, if the other posts are to be believed. However, despite being quite interesting, the book is just plain miswritten.

B000063V8T|5.0|Sure, seasons 3 and 4 were great, but season 5 is where everything starts to feel comfortable. Season 4 was the setup, the ultimate test for TNG to see if it really could boldly go. Season 5 is the confirmation that it passed.<br />It opens with the excellent conclusion to one of the best two-parters, \\"Redemption.\\" New areas are explored with the Klingons and Romulans. This is the best season premiere of the whole series, loaded with plot twists, space fights, and some more character development.<br />What continues in the season are the greatest episodes of the series. In \\"Unification pts. 1-2,\\" the crew finally meet Spock and the \\"unification\\" between the two series is complete. Wesley the weasel gets in trouble at Starfleet in \\"The First Duty,\\" proving that the little twerp really can make mistakes. But the episode is also great in that we learn more about Picard's training at the academy. Another great episode is the remarkable \\"Darmok,\\" in which Picard and an alien captain are trapped on a planet with a deadly monster. The two have incredible trouble communicating, but it turns into a bonding experience for both of them, turning in one of the best \\"Trek\\" episodes ever. In another remarkable episode, \\"The Inner Light,\\" Picard is zapped by an alien probe and sent into a coma. While thirty minutes go by on the ship, Picard experiences a lifetime on another world.<br />Season 5 of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" boldly goes where no other Trek series has gone before. It has all of the Trek elements perfectly in tact and is also one of the best years of any television show. No fan of good science fiction should be without it.
0441172717|2.0|I can't help but feel the need to write a less-than-memorable review on these books of Frank Herbert.  I'm on the verge of giving it away, but if you read them, over %90 of them are people sitting on rock ledges or balconies thinking of plans and plans and plans.  The action scenes seemed to be written as if they were afterthoughts, almost a &quot;by the way&quot; feeling.  The characters were elaborate, but making them ACT was impossible, and that's why I gave the whole Dune series 2-stars instead of one.  If you're thinking about reading them, ask someone who has already read them and then get a summary; it'll be quicker.

0312305060|5.0|Don't miss the book, even if you catch the movie.  The final thread connecting Virginia Woolf, the New York Mrs. Dalloway, and Laura Brown arrives with considerable affection and subtlety.  The writing throughout is spare, precise, sympathetic and true.  The novel, far more than the movie, delivers on the title: every single human battles depression and loss, but there are those Hours, when life is suddenly all that we think it should be always.  They come unexpectedly, often unrecognized but we stay alive for them, alert for them, even when it seems impossible that any one will ever come again. <br />Highly praised novels often disappoint me when I finally get around to reading them.  This one did not, but understand that conventional action and plot development are conspicuous by their absence.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I have been a Britney fan since the \\"...Baby One More Time\\". Her third album has definitely shown considerable amount of growth artistically and in terms of creativity. \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", the first single from this album is definitely a club-banger. My favorite track from this album is \\"Anticipating\\"; and I think that this should be released as a single worldwide, but of course the song only got released in certain countries... I believe it was France and Philippines.<br />One thing I was a bit disappointed about the album was the fact that there were 4 Max Martin-produced tracks on there (\\"Overprotected\\", \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\", \\"Cinderella\\", and \\"Bombastic Love\\"). This means that some people may get tired of this sound... I wished that Jive Records would replace \\"Cinderella\\" and \\"Bombastic Love\\" with \\"Before The Goodbye\\", \\"When I Found You\\" and \\"I Run Away\\". The three latter songs appear in international versions of this album but they were not included in the North American version of this album... so that was a bit disappointing. I mean, she co-wrote \\"Before The Goodbye\\" (and \\"I Run Away\\"... I believe...)<br />With Britney co-writing 5 of the 12 tracks, it's definitely a good start... After all, she is only 21, so there's definitely lots of time for her to growth artistically in her upcoming albums. I am also looking forward to know what track she will be doing a cover for in her next album. I'm gonna give this album 80%. There's room for improvement. Keep it up, Britney!
B00007H1Y2|5.0|If you liked the sounds of the other Cuban based records Ry has made, then you will love this album. It took me back to the sixties when my parents used to dance the samba, cha cha cha and the rumba at real cocktail parties. The music is soothing, rhythmic and arresting. I can't keep humming it to myself. This is for people who enjoy latin spiced music in the vein of Joaberto. Buy it, you will not be dissapointed.

B00005NTN5|5.0|Kind of like Martin Scorsese with lingerie. Ok, not a pretty image, I admit, but it sort of describes this movie! Although Marty didn't direct, Bound follows gangster movie themes which remind me of some his films, at least up to a point. There are plot twists aplenty here as the two heroines play out their plan to steal $2 million from the mob. It's also good to see two central characters who are gay, shown in such a positive (and sexy) way. Great acting from all concerned, and the movie manages to create a hugely enjoyable mix of bloody gangland stuff with humour and satire. You won't know how it's going to end and you won't want it to end. Superb.
B000088E6M|4.0|this is a great cd.  eminem and dre made a smart choice signing 50 and G unit.  this cd comes with the already classics in Wanksta and In Da Club, but the rest of the cd is what makes it great.  the whole album as a whole is on par with The Eminem Show, if you wanna compare those.  the beats are bangin, obviously, with dre, and 50's lyrics are his normal street rhymes.  my favorites trax are Patiently Waiting, and Back Down, which is a diss to biatch Ja Rule.  you'll laugh hard at the end of the song.  get this album-along with his other underground stuff-you won't regret it.  peace
B000088E6M|4.0|Most people picking up this album never heard of 50-Cent prior to his radio / TV / club hits, \\"Wanksta,\\" and \\"In Da Club.\\" However, 50-Cent has been around for a good while. A lot of us who have been a fan of rap for awhile and stay on top of the newest artists and songs heard of 50-Cent back in 1998 when he dropped the single \\"How To Rob,\\" which took shots at various artists in the industry at the time. This made a very big street buzz for 50-Cent, but also killed a lot of ties with successful rappers that could of helped him blow up earlier. Within the last year or so, 50-Cent and G-Unit have been all over mixtapes from DJ Clue, Funkmaster Flex, Kay Slay, Whoo Kid, and many more, making a great buzz for him and G-Unit in the streets. 50-Cent then finally released \\"Guess Who's Back\\" which is a collection of some of his hits since \\"Power Of The Dollar\\" was never officially released to do bootlegging and label issues. 50-Cent's sophmore debut on Shady Records entitled \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin\\" appeals to a broad audience, from his long time fans like myself, and just about anybody who goes clubbing, listens to the radio, or watches TV. 50-Cent put a few \\"club hits\\" on this album which makes his buzz off the streets strong now as well. While this album is great, I was expecting more from 50-Cent, hoping it would be a grimier album where he had songs along the lines of \\"Gun Runner,\\" \\"The Good Die Young,\\" \\"Ya Heard,\\" \\"Slow Doe,\\" and more. However, I'm still pleased with this album and happy for 50-Cent, he's finally getting the respect he deserves. Some of my favorite cuts off the album include \\"What Up Gangsta,\\" which is a short track but shows a lot of 50-Cent's energy and charisma on the mic. \\"Many Men (Wish Death),\\" is probably my favorite cut off the album, the beat is insane and 50-Cent shows how his flow is versitile, it's almost never the same. While \\"High All The Time,\\" might not be the best track for kids to listen to, a lot of us can relate to the song if you know what I mean. On \\"Heat,\\" Dr. Dre provides a gunshot beat that he has been talking about doing for who knows how long, another track I love. At first listen, I didn't care too much for \\"If I Can't,\\" but it has become one of my favorite cuts off the album. \\"Poor Lil Rich,\\" is an old track which sounds like it has been re-mastered which is a great thing because it's one of my favorite 50-Cent tracks of all time. If you're a fan of 50-Cent, make sure to pick this album up. If you don't know much about 50-Cent or maybe have never heard of him, I still recommend picking this album up, as well as \\"Guess Who's Back.\\"
B00005B36H|5.0|Lateralus is Tool's best album, and the masterpiece that I was hoping to come from Maynard Keenan.<br />Now I realize that's a bold assertion, especially for the Tool fanatic who thinks that everything the band has done is pure gold. I on the other hand have different feelings about Undertow and Aenima. Undertow has some great songs--Prison Sex, Intolerance, Sober, and 4-Degrees--but the album as a whole is inconsistent. I found most of Aenima forgettable, except for Forty-Six and Two, Jimmy, and parts of Third Eye. Both albums showed a band with potential, but falling short of being truly great.<br />Lateralus is the album that fulfills that potential. It is music as art in an era full of mainstream fluff. It is dark, beautiful, disturbing, angry, sad, and spiritual all at the same time.<br />Tool fans who claim that the band has sold out with this release are utter fools. This is probably Tool's LEAST commercial effort. The compositions are long, deep, and cerebral, and there is no attempt at the dry humor found on tracks like Disgustipated (Undertow) or Eie Von Satan (Aenima). The profanity and angst are kept to a minimum. In many ways this is Tool at their most progressive and intelligent, a challenge to their audience.<br />It has been said that the members of Tool are not master musicians. While this is true, the result is much greater than the sum of the parts. Maynard is one of the most distinct vocalists out there--in this album his voice is a bit more restrained than on Aenima, but on occasion he lets the rage fly with stunning results. However, if I had to say which musician of this tightly honed group really stands out, it's drummer Danny Carry. This guy sounds like he has more than two arms--listen to his stunning opener on Ticks And Leeches. Danny makes his prescence felt throughout this album, and he really is remarkable.<br />Every composition flows together gracefully. Some songs serve as interludes to long pieces (Eon Blue Apocalypse, Mantra). I especially love how the beautiful and quiet Parabol segues into the violent, powerful Parabola. Schizm is perhaps the most mainstream track, and can effectively stand alone. Ticks And Leeches and the title track really display Tool's incredible power--the former sounds like what Aenima should've been, full of bile and rage, yet it flows well in this album. The latter is an amazing epic piece that displays an mathematical buildup of rhythm up to an amazing finale. The instrumental suite Disposition/Reflection/Triad sounds almost like a King Crimson piece, and it is a glorious 20 minutes of music.<br />This album is a testament to the fact that intelligent, thoughtful music still exists in the mainstream. If you love progressive rock, heavy metal, or anything in between Lateralus belongs in your collection.I especially love how the beautiful and quiet Parabol segues into the violent, powerful Parabola.

020530902X|3.0|A high school teacher told my class about seven years ago that this book would be a good investment.  So I read it.  I've heard people since I've purchased this book rave about it.  First, a college grad or competent high-schooler should alrea be well-versed with the &quot;info&quot; in this book; so, second, it's not very elucidating on the speicfic troubles a wrier may run into.  Three stars since it's a good &quot;overview.&quot;  I've always found Diana Hacker's A Writer's Reference very helpful, though it's kind of pricey, but, as they say, you get what you pay for.  grammatical pun intended.

B000002U82|4.0|Dark Side Of The Moon: Everybody and their mother has this album, it introduced Pink Floyd to the mainstream, it was groundbreaking by 1973 standards, it has one of the best covers ever, and it is an indispensible prog-rock recording.<br />But it's not Pink Floyd's best work. Not even close.<br />And that's a hard thing for me to say, because I love this album. Time and Money introduced me to Pink Floyd, when I used to listen to a lot of classic rock radio. Brain Damage and Eclipse are an incredible listen every time, and that insane laughter at the end of Brain Damage still gives me chills.<br />However, both Roger Waters and David Gilmour are still far from hitting their potential on this album. Listen to The Wall or Wish You Were--these albums were the pinnacle for each artist respectively. There's nothing approaching the hooks and brilliant songwriting of Another Brick In The Wall I-III, or Wish You Were Here. There's also none of the great long compositions that Pink Floyd is famous for--no Echoes, no Dogs, no Interstellar Overdrive.<br />And then there's the Syd Barrett album, Piper At The Gates Of Dawn. For all of its psychedelic idiosyncracies it is a real trip, and is more memorable in its madcap-nutter ambience than any other album of its decade. Dark Side Of The Moon falls well short of Syd Barrett's only LP with Pink Floyd.<br />Perhaps the one thing that Dark Side Of The Moon has over other Pink Floyd albums is its immaculate production. This album set the standard for the music industry, and it sounds pretty fresh even after 20 years of advances in equipment and technology.<br />I can't deny that this album is essential to any rock fan, but other Pink Floyd albums are conceptually tighter (The Wall, Wish You Were Here), more engaging (Piper At The Gates Of Dawn), or more demonstrative of their progressive nature (Animals, Meddle). Dark Side Of The Moon is a great starting point, but go back and buy the other great albums in the catalog too.
B000059PR3|5.0|I was lucky enough to find this gem at my local video store and I was not dissapointed. The opening scene is great. It took me a little while to find this title, but it was worth it. Its right up there with the other Fulci greats such as Zombie, Gates Of Hell (city of the living dead), and The Beyond. Although it isnt technically a zombie movie, i loved in nonetheless. Dr.Freudstien is a crazed Zombie-like creature living in the cellar of a large, mansion like house and hungers for human flesh and sets out to devour the houses new inhabitants. I like it. If youre a fan of low-budget gory creepy movies, eurohorror, or youre a Fulci fan who still hasnt seen this one, I reccomend it.
B000088E6M|5.0|This album in my opinion is exactly like Eminem and Dr Dre said it would be. An instant classic just like the Marshall Mathers LP and The Chronic. I can listen to the album from start to finish everytime. Theres not one track to skip. Eminem makes a couple of appearances of the album in Don't Push Me and Patiently Waiting. He also produced them. Dre also helped on a few songs and did a great job. BUY THIS IF U DONT HAVE IT!<BR>The free DVD is worth the $$$ alone.<BR>J-Roc
B000005IU2|5.0|I honestly didn't know what to make of Fun House when I first heard it at a friend's house. While I was familiar with some Detroit proto-punk and loved the MC5, this was something completely different. Heavy, sludgy, primitive, and (VERY) loud, the second Stooges record did not so much captivate me as bludgeon me to a pulp and fill my ears with sonic freakout. I couldn't quite handle it, at first.<br />Several listens later, it was a different story. I now was starting to really enjoy it. I also took the liberty of listening to other Stooges records, and while both the debut and Raw Power were decent albums Fun House still rocked harder than either, and that's no small feat. I HAD to find this album.<br />Sonically, Fun House feels more like the blues gone to hell or a severely drug-addicted 'Stones than it resembles the MC5 or the punk rock that was to come. The album is fairly loosely constructed--seven tracks, each about 5 minutes long on average. The album kicks off with a pair of dense hard rockers, Down On The Street and Loose. The tracks keep getting crazier and more sonically chaotic from there, from the paranoid TV Eye to the adrenaline-fueled mess of 1970 to the final and complete head-splitting destruction of L.A. Blues. The only real departure from this is the 7-minute blues grinder Dirt, which calms the listener down before the last three tracks blow the mind.<br />The band was at its apex here. Iggy Pop howls, grunts, and screams his sexually driven lyrics, and his cocky sneer and insane on-stage antics established the template for Johnny Rotten and countless others. Ron Asheton tears it up with his wah-wah heavy riffage, proving that he is the one and only guitarist that can do justice to this band. On the last three tracks, session player Steven Mackey adds his tenor sax to throw in a free jax element, suggesting perhaps that the Stooges weren't as \\"stoopid\\" as people thought.<br />To sum up, this was punk before there was punk; this was Black Flag when Henry Rollins was a mere tot; this is what the Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat should've been; this was the touchstone of 90% of what was to follow in the rock world. Absolutely essential to people who embrace punk, metal, indie, whatever. Nevermind all the hyperbole, just BUY IT.lag when Henry Rollins was a mere tot; this is what the Velvet Underground's White Light/White Heat should've been; this was the touchstone of 90% of what was to follow in the rock world.

0812550757|5.0|Orson Scott Card came up with the central idea of &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; before &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, and after you read both books you'll understand why he originally thought of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; as just an introduction.  The two books are separate works that share only their one major character.  &quot;Speaker&quot; is set three-thousand years later, when Ender is still alive because of the relativistic effects of space travel.  He's spent the time wandering among various planets settled by humans and speaking the deaths of various people, a newly invented ritual where he attempts to tell the deceased's entire life story from an impartial perspective.  On the planet of Lusitania, meanwhile, humanity has encountered a new and intelligent, but technologically primitive species known as the Pequinos.  Because the destruction of the Buggers is now viewed as the worst crime in human history, this new lifeform is seen as a chance for redemption.<br />&quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; is a big, ambitious work, and its topics and goals are very different from those in &quot;Ender's Game&quot;.  While the idea of alien contact does get mentioned quite a bit, large portions of the book are also focused on the experiences of one particular family whose members work with the Pequinos.  Religion plays a big role in this book, and Card has a unique vision of how authority, in terms of both church and government, will be organized in the future.  Like all of the very best science fiction novels, &quot;Speaker of the Dead&quot; presents us with a lot of original insights about the future of human society, and raises countless questions that are relevant to us today.<br />Card's writing is, needless to say, outstanding.  While reading &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;, I was constantly stunned by his accurate dialogue, and by the way that he is able to bring a huge and diverse cast of characters to life.  It's interesting to note that Card spends almost no timeon descriptions, yet he still effectively communicates the look and feel of almost every location in the book.  &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; shows us one of the greatest authors of a generation at the top of his game; it's a book that nobody should miss.
0671045857|5.0|This is a good Stephen King novel.  It's relatively short, and has some of the mystical element that King is so well known for.  What works in the plot is how you follow the trail of this girl from getting off the trail, to what could be the end of the line.<br />However, what made this most memorable was the stellar performance turned in by Anne Heche.  She not only did the narration; she brought this girl to life, and more importantly, brought this girl's fears to life.  I still think of &quot;Tough Tootsie&quot; when I think of this book, and I loved listening to the &quot;play-by-play&quot; of the Red Sox, since I've listened to Joe and Jerry quite often over the years.<br />A good reading can make a good book outstanding.  This is truly a book you should listen to, whether or not you read it.
B00003CXXM|5.0|Basically, if you like action movies, this is for you.  I don't really spend a lot of time analyzing whether what happens on screen is realistic, I just enjoy the show, and this was great.

Laugh out loud at the swarm dragging bodies across the desert you will!

B00006BS6T|3.0|Actually, it's about 3.5 stars; they really need a .5 option here, don't they?  Anyway, I have to admit, I didn't expect this movie to be so great.  I rented it on hopes that it would be good, and it didn't let me down.  Owen Wilson may be one of the most underrated actors in today's distressing 'teen idol' movie business.  And Gene Hackman proves once again why he's such a dominant force in film.<br />Wilson stars as Lt. Chris Burnett, a fighter pilot on his way out of the force.  Then on a simple routine flight, him and his partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) cross into territory they shouldn't have been near; which makes things take a turn for the worst.  Wilson ends up on the run, alone, from the Russians who want him dead.  Meanwhile, Adm. Leslie Reigart (Hackman) is forced to put many lives in danger for just one.  It's an awesome action movie that holds your attention throughout, even if the plot seems to be a little dull (which it's really not).  It ranks right up there with &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; and &quot;The Patriot&quot; as one of the best military/war movies one can view.  Wilson is great; he handles the action perfectly, and he even chips in some good comedy towards the beginning of the movie.<br />Also, this is not the first time Gene Hackman and Owen Wilson have teamed up.  In the same year (2001), both starred in the hilarious hit comedy &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;, a movie that has quite a different style than that of this one.  Grant it, I don't think they'll turn out to be the Ben Affleck/Matt Damon of the 00's, but they do work wonders together.<br />In seeing this film, you won't be disappointed with it.  Although &quot;Behind Enemy Lines&quot; does not have the blood and guts/guns-in-your-face of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; or even &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot;, it's still a good action thriller you souldn't miss.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This album was great. I like the singles she chose too.<BR>Nice lyrics.
B000002KP3|5.0|<br />The most amazing thing about listening to this in 2003 is you can clearly hear the influence this has had on artists after it was released: David Bowie basically re-created this album's vibe verbatim while cranking the guitars a bit more on &quot;Ziggy Stardust.&quot; The vocals and arrangements on &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; are also dead ringers for several songs from &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show.&quot; Tell me Tim Curry's Dr. Frankenfurter doesn't sound (and look) like Marc Bolan!<BR><BR><br />I really enjoy the guitar sound on this record too. Unlike the album cover with Bolan posing in front of a towering amp stack, the guitar sounds like it was plugged directly into the mixing board, giving it a uniquely understated distortion, and allowing all the strings, congas, background vocals and a beautifully dense bassline equal time in the spotlight of this landmark disc.

1567230466|5.0|I have read and re-read all of my Georgette Heyers every few years since 1973,and shall probably continue to do so for the next 30 or more years.Her dry,acerbic heroes,spirited heroines, and the not-too-bright characters who confuse everything and hence contribute to the plots,all add up to a great read.<br />I have a long list of Heyer favourites,but the Convenient Marriage tops the list.The Earl of Rule is a perfect hero,Horry isn't such a perfect heroine but very likeable all the same,but the stars of the book would have to be Horry's brother Pelham, and his singularly inept friend Sir Roland Pommeroy,who gamely try,and fail,to rescue Horry from her various scrapes.<br />Highlights for me are the drunken scene in Half-Moon Street and subsequent confusion at Lord Lethbridge's house;also when Pelham,Sir Roland,and Captain Heron take to the high toby,particularly when Sir Roland attempts to buy a horse from a very irate victim;and when Sir Roland invites Rule to a card party.This last is worth a quote:-<BR>(Sir Roland has gone to Rule's house in a desperate bid to keep him away from a party in Vauxhall Gardens,using a card party,for which he needs a fourth player,as his excuse)<BR>'Now don't say you cannot come!Can't play whisk with only three people,my lord.Most awkward situation!'<BR>'I am sure it must be,'agreed his lordship sympathetically.'And I expect you have tried everyone else.'<BR>'Oh everyone!'said Sir Roland.&quot;Can't find a fourth at all.Do beg of your lordship not to fail me!'<BR>.....The Earl appeared to meditate.'I am of course very fond of whisk.'<BR>Sir Roland breathed a sigh of relief.'Knew I could count on you!Beg you will dine first-five o'clock.'<BR>'Who are your other guests?'inquired his lordship.<BR>'Well,to tell you the truth-not quite sure yet,'said Sir Roland confidentially.'Bound to find someone glad of a game.Have it all fixed by five o'clock.'
B00005QGAX|5.0|Michael outdoes himself her. He wrote all of the songs except for two. These songs display his ability not only as a singer, but a songwriter. <br />Bad: Great song. Very catchy.<br />The Way You Make Me Feel: One of the three best songs on the album. This song is perfection and will remain timeless.<br />Speed Demon: A very different kind of song, very good.<br />Liberian Girl: This song is just very pleasing to the ear. <br />Just Good Friends: I don't particularly like the song but maybe it has something to do with the fact that it was not written by Michael.<br />Another Part of Me: Displayed in movies such Rush Hour and Epcot's Captain Eo, it has a very catchy beat accentuated by Michael's excellent vocals.<br />Man in the Mirror: One of the three best songs on the album. It is a very powerful song with a positive message. Michael's voice and the chorus do an excellent job of making you feel the music.<br />I Just Can't Stop Loving You: One of the three greatest on ther album. It is a duet with Siedah Garrett who also does an amazing job. Pure Perfection. <br />Dirty Diana: Critics claimed this was just an attempt to imitate Thriller's rock song Beat it but this song can definitely stand alone as a rock song. Michael truly has a rock edge as evident in his follow up album Dangerous and songs such as Come Together. At any rate, Dirty Diana is a great song. <br />Smooth Criminal: Another different but very catchy song.<br />Leave Me Alone: A great song in which Michael discloses a part of himself, the part that wants some privacy.<br />This CD also features the previously unreleased Streetwalker and Fly Away which are fabulous and the Spanish version of I Just Can't Stop Loving You which sounds great no matter what the language.All the songs are great, but The Way You Make Me Feel, Man in the Mirror, and I Just Can't Stop Loving You are reason enough to own this album.
B00005QK3W|4.0|People seem to go so hard on Paul. They always forget, The Beatles were a pop band, and Paul is a pop musician. Lennon and Harrison were the rockers of the group. Sure Paul has some rocking numbers, but Paul is the greatest pop writer of the century. Here's a song-by-song review.<br />Lonely Road - Pretty good track. Sounds like something from the let it be/abbey road sessions. Nice drumming and bass<br />From Lover to Friend - Really drawn out ballad ... not bad, but not a stand out<BR>.<br />She's Done Talking - Slow rocker about being tired ... another filler<br />Driving Rain - Besides the annoying \\"1,2,3,4,5, Lets go for a drive!\\" chorus, this song is really good. Nice acoustic melody mixed with great bass and drums. Definitely a stand out.<br />I Do - another beatles-esq track. Kind of cutesy rocker.<br />Tiny Bubble - Nice melody with a driving bassline, really one of the better tracks on the album.<br />Magic - A drippy rock ballad with some chiming guitar work and a pretty good melody.<br />Your Way - The best so far. Awesome bassline, cool guitarwork/soloing. Good lyrics, good melody. Definitely the kind of song you put on \\"Track Repeat.\\"<br />Spinning on an Axis - Kind of a boring song....<br />About You - Cool rocker. Great melody. Another nice bassline and cool guitar work<br />Heather - vocals don't come in until the songs is over. Kind of nice but obviously filler.<br />Back in The Sunshine - Very cool song. Reminds me of a Lennon song. Chiming guitars and aggressive bass, good production.<br />Your Loving Flame - the most popular song on the album. It's the best ballad on the album hands down. Nice guitar solo, pretty catchy song about Paul's new wife.<br />Riding in Jaipur - Boring middle-eastern flavoured instrumental trying to sound like a Harrison song.<br />Rinse the Raindrops - 10 Minutes of rocking fun. The fastest rocker Paul's done in years, definitly one of his best songs.<br />Freedom - nice melody..... but a little too simple for my tastes.<br />So overall, there is some filler, but overall some of Paul's best songs.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of those films that knocks you off your feet.  I must say I had few if any expectations when I rented this, and boy was I surprised.  Excellent acting, a great story, good character development, and some twists you just don't see will keep you in your seat.  I have watched this movie several times, and it only gets better.  I won't give anything away, but the movie is worth the money, and is worth adding to a collection.  The additional included material that is not very comprehensive, so don't expect much.  And the deleted scenes are, as usual, deleted for a reason.  Take note, this is not some run of the mill, dumb hollywood blockbuster.  This is the good stuff that gets made occasionaly.
0345448898|5.0|Ok,so these books do have dark parts.But that's life,take the good with the bad.During the first few pages of The Golden Compass,I was hooked.I love the plot and how Lyra had a tough life.She stumbles upon a door to a different world and gets taken on an adventure she'll never forget.The Golden Compass has to do with an artifact with special powers.In the Subtle Knife,Lyra meets Will,who finds a knife that can open up doors to the other worlds.The Amber Spyglass is when Will and Lyra go on a trip,I won't say where.I love all three!
B00005JKCH|5.0|You must hand it to Raimi for not only successfully translating this larger than life legend to the silver screen, but also toppling the George Lucas juggernaut.  I think the charm of this film is that it is a nerdy hero puts aside his pride and steps up to his duty and calling as a superhero.  It is a very intimate and emotional movie that hits all the right butons.<br />Maguire plays Peter Parker perfectly.  I am glad that they found an actor who actually looked and played the part, rather than taking Hollywood's flavor of the month.  You believe that Parker is really a goof and a nerd, and you know that he revel in being Spiderman, the coolest of he cool.<br />My favorite scene is Parker's epiphany, when he decides to take up the mantel and captures the man who killed his grandfather.  Parker is awkward and clumsy as he begins his chase, but he eventually get the carjacker, and gets a clue that he need to be a super-hero.  I think the nice touch is when Park swings on street level, he has to dodge the streetlights.  They paid that much attention to detail.<br />Kirsten Dunst play MJ well.  She is caught between several men: Flash Thompson, Harry Osbourne, Peter Parker, and Spiderman.  Yet she manages to keep her head, and play a darn good scream queen to boot.  She is the love interest, but is able to transcend the role and bring life.<br />Judging from the gag reel, I think Willem Defoe was having too much fun playing the Green Goblin and it hurt some of his performances.  He wasn't an menacing as he could be because he was laughing his head off behind the mask.<br />As to the DVD, I am one of those people who likes the features disk over the film disk.  Seeing all of the behind the scenes  clips enhances the film for me.  I love the commentaries, and especially the gag reels.  I just wish there was a way to be able to reintegrate deleted scenes back into the film.  \\"Buckaroo Banzai\\" and \\"X-Men I\\" have this feature, and I hope it catches on.
B000000HRP|5.0|I had this record back in the seventies and will be buying it again! <BR>One: You will be astounded by what an excellent drummer Phil Collins is! <BR>Two: Goodsall and the rest of the players on this record are astounding. <BR>Three: This will still sound fresh today! Nothing cliche' on this record. <BR>This Brand X is just plain good, supurbly executed Jazz/Rock/fusion! To be honest this one is sooooo good, there is nothing else that Brand X ever did that even came close. Awesome Spin!
B00005JLRR|4.0|Nemesis was a very well scripted event. Not as good as First Contact, but still very good. I was a little dissapointed that they killed Data, but they brought him back in another form. If they make another movie it will be interesting ot se how B4 develops and assumes data's identity. Tom Hardy and Patrick Stewart did excellent job's portraying there characters. I wish the other members of the Enterprise had more involved roles and sub plots. I think with that many members of a crew the movie should have been longer and more involved. But all in all it was a good movie. I think it only did poorly at the Box Office due to it's release so close to Lord Of The Rings.
B0000024JN|5.0|not necessarilly their best, but it's still amazing.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Nothing else can be said except that this is amazing.  I agree with other reviewers that the last two tracks are not necessary to the soundtrack, but the other songs, even if not obviously in the film or not in the film at all, are stupendous.  The movie was an entertainment smorgasbord for kings, and this soundtrack allows for lovely memories of a wonderful meal!
B000002P5R|5.0|To me, this does not sound like a posthumous release. Except for Hey Baby (New Rising Sun), this sounds like an album that Jimi himself completed before his death. Some of his best songs (\\"Freedom,\\" \\"Angel,\\" \\"Dolly Dagger,\\" etc.) can be found on this album, and they also branch into different generes (funk and the like) that Jimi had yet to explore on his three studio albums. Bilyl Cox is wonderful on the bass, and Mitch Mitchell (with the exception of Earth Blues) is at the top of his game.<BR>Why do I think Mitch did not do a good job on \\"Earth Blues\\"? Well, to me, this song is suppose to be an anthemic funk rocker with a steady groove, something Buddy Miles did well on his version (found on the \\"Jimi Hendrix Experience\\"). In this version, Mitch goes all over the place on his drum kit, making it hard for the listener to establish a steady groove (even when Mitch does groove on this tune, its very loose). The best example is during the \\"Everybody!\\" bridge (as I like to call it); whereas Buddy plays a funky drum beat that sounds like he's playing to a rockin' gospel song, Mitch attempts to play with the ride cymbal and an odd snare combination, which would have worked...if he did it right. Sadly, its just messy, and no groove is established. Now that I've made my case, Mitch does play fabulous on the rest of the album...and he plays \\"Stepping Stone\\" MUCH better than Buddy did :-).<BR>So, what are you waiting for...get this album!
B000088E6M|5.0|This 50 Cent album is on fire man.  Every single one of the main 16 songs on this album are tight, the three bonus songs are hot too.  I especially love Wanksta, In Da Club, Blood Hound, What Up Gangsta, Like My Style, Back Down (At diss song dedicated to the wanksta Ja Rule), and P.I.M.P., Poor Lil Rich, and Don't Push Me.  I advise all rap heads to go get this album, if you love his first two singles (Wanksta & In Da Club) then you'll definitely love this album.  Get Rich Or Die Tryin is so far the best rap album of the year.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This has to be the best music I have ever herd!<br />I would even pick this insted of my favorit singer Enya!<br />I rely rely would love for people to hear and love this music just like I have~<br />My mom even likes it!<br />I lisen to this with my frinds once at school....<br />Before my teacher told us to put it away.<br />But it IS very very good music.<br />Gentle and grately done John Willlems has outdone himself from all others hes done!<br />YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS AND SEE THE MOVIE!<br />TAKE MY ADVISE ITS A GOOD PRESENT!
0385493800|5.0|It starts as interesting as all of Grishams books, but as it goes deep into its chapters, it becomes more and more amazingly interesting. You will learn from it, as well as you will laugh with it, and then you will cry with it.  I think that in some way this book relates to just about everyone. The theme of the book relies on the cases of the legal (material) world we live in, but I think that the real core of the book lies in the spirituality that takes place in the most inner part of the book.  <BR>After I finished the book, I somehow felt like a new part of ME had been awakened, and believe it or not, all of a sudden i just felt like smiling at the whoe world.  <BR>I think that you should give this book a try, and experience what i experienced... you will very much enjoy it.<BR>PS. Ignore my grammar please, english is my second language
B00006IR5S|5.0|The Harry Potter music for the first movie was grate and I think this is just as good!<br />This music has a light and slow at some places and fast and quick at others.<br />A good exsample is Hedwigs theme.<br />It is the music you hear all the time when it first starts out at the movie theter.<br />IT starts out slow-only chims or something- then other more loud instroments come in and it slowly picks up speed untill it's melody is just making you run around the houce like crazy.<br />This music is lovely to lisen to wether your relaxing or just whanting fast party music.<br />GO GET IT AND GO SEE THE MOVIE WHICH IS BETTER THEN THE FIRST!
B000088E6M|4.0|This album is hot. It definetly lives up to the street hype. Great production from Dre & Eminem and good lyrics. Not too many guest appearances either, which is unusual nowadays.
B00005R2M3|5.0|this is not the music you may think.  there are artists out there who hurt a true artist such as shakira.  there are things like the backstreet boys or n sync that dance and sing well but write or play nothing of their own and do little else.  it is NOT music but, what i call, perfectly packaged PRODUCT.  it is dangerous in the sense that it really lacks substance.  n stink is evil because it is mindless \\"music\\" but it really is not music at all.<BR>     now we have shakira who embraces all britny or n-stink  have that is good such as melody yet rise above the mindlessness by giving us substance thus avoiding the bad side of pop.  shakira may look good but do not assume anything.  she can play and sing.  you may not like her music or voice but she has talent, of that there is no doubt.  <BR>     shakira uses her roots and combines them with amercian pop to create such a mind blowing style.  she has the voice of an angel, a siren to soothe me and then she plays such melodious notes from her guitar that the guitar drips with magic.  this is one awesome album trip, from begginning to end.
B00000IQC8|3.0|You can probably read the other reviews to figure out the plot.  And you're supposed to review the DVD, not the movie itself.<br />This is a very bare boned \\"Collectors Edition.\\"  There are a few deleted scenes as well as directors commentary, but now that is NEEDED even on non-collectors version DVD's.  Considering you can go to Kevin Smith's webpage and watch all the \\"Extra's\\" on that are on the DVD, it makes this whole \\"Collector's\\" thing pretty useless.  If you haven't ever seen the movie, buy the VHS for much less, unless you find the DVD on sale.
B000088E6M|5.0|With his \\"debut\\" album, 50 Cent has truly proven himself as the most talented rapper in the hip-hop industry. Now, technically, this is not 50's debut album. He has released several albums under smaller labels, including \\"Guess Who's Back\\" and his G-Unit's \\"50 Cent Is Tha Future\\". And as good as those albums are, they cannot compare to the absolute perfection that is \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\". Absolutely every track on the album is a classic. The radio-played hits Wanksta and In Da Club, although overplayed, are still excellent. But the standout tracks are Many Men, Heat, What Up Gangsta, and P.I.M.P. That's not to say, however, that the other tracks are weaker.<br />I'm dead serious when I say that this could be one of the best hip-hop albums of all time. 50 is here to stay, whether y'all like it or not.
B000002UCN|5.0|I am extremely satisfied with the selections on this CD.   It has all his biggest hits of the early to mid 70s and several well-known (and not so well known) Beatles recording that he penned.   THe only thing that I would change would be - I would have added &quot;Savoy Truffle&quot; and &quot;Long Long Long&quot; from the White Album and &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; from Magical Mystery Tour.<br />Higly recommend this CD.
B000088E6M|4.0|This is the first banging CD of the new year. The most anticipated rapper since the late Notorious BIG has finally dropped his \\"offical\\" debut CD \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\". 50 Cent and his G-Unit crew are tearing up the streets of New York as well as all over with their mixtape classics and with the help of Dr. Dre and Eminem have put together a definite \\"platinum plus\\" masterpiece. First thing is first, 50  is not going to \\"Wow\\" you with his lyrical skills. He is a marginal rapper at best. But you're not going to buy this CD to hear him drop complex rhymes. You're going to buy it for it's tight production and an MC that does what he does best, Keeping it real. If you've heard any of 50 cent mixtapes he is best known for jacking other people's songs and re-doing them. As well as his constant bantering on the whole \\"Charlie's Angels Inc\\" oops, I meant \\"Murder Inc\\". But that whole beef is only limited to the banging track produced by Dr.Dre \\"Back Down\\". Dre also assists on other cuts, the first single \\"In da club\\", \\"If I Can't\\" and my personal favorite \\"Heat\\". Eminem also is included on the production credits with \\"Patiently Waiting\\" and \\"Don't Push Me\\" featuring Lloyd Banks. The album includes bonus cuts, \\"Wanksta\\", \\"Your Life's On the Line\\"(Vintage 50 Cent) and a surprising lyrical 50 on \\"U Not Like Me\\". The bonus DVD is pretty much a documentary of 50's career to this point as well as his well-known personal drama incidents. Pretty entertaining. The only problem that I have with the CD is the limited use of the G-Unit Crew: Lloyd Banks and Tony Yayo. Their mixtapes are legendary and it's because of the chemistry between the 3. However, I believe that this was done on purpose for this album because it really focuses on 50 and Banks and Yayo will get their own shine on a \\"G-Unit\\" compilation album which is set to drop later on this year. Besides that, a definite banger for the streets, club, and just about anywhere. 50 cent is the future!!! G-G-G-G-G-G-G-Unit!!
B00005UEAR|3.0|The creation of this album is really commendable. The songs are long and orchestrated, and probably took many hours to write. If only more musicians put that much effort into creating an album. Reminds me a lot of Fates Warning, one of my all-time favorite bands. These guys are very talented, and \\"Glass Prision\\" is a really awesome song that I just cant keep still when listening to it. Unfortunately this album drags on and on in some spots. Some of the lyrics are so sappy its pathetic, and some just arent very good.  The singer has a very 80s metal style to him.. no rap metal or gurgling here. Sometimes they have true magic that is really impressive, but they struggle at times to persist it and it sounds too forced. There are a couple of songs on this album that I will load onto the MP3 player because I imagine enjoying them for years, but  lot of this album is also discardable. The truth is I think these guys have their heads on well enough, and are well adjusted enough, and are so drug free thaty they do not have the ineer turmoil and darkness required to write really deep movig music consistently.
B00005B23A|5.0|If you have any doubts about Arnold's abilities then you need to see this film. It has humor, action, romance, intrigue, and an actual story line. I loved it.  The special effects were not as good as the terminator, but they were still great.  Tom Arnold plays oppistie Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis, and really makes a person laugh.  Jamie Lee Curtis is beautiful as ever, and does a terrific job portraying a career mom who longs for excitment in her life as she has begun to feel her life and family are nothing but ordinary.  That is until she learns her husband is a government spy.  This is a very enjoyable film, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is a great album. Its powerful, energetic, exhilerating, beautiful, dark music that is FULL of life. These guys have passion in their souls, and this album is not the least bit forced. OK, so the singer cannot sing well in a live concert, but he KNOWS how to use what he has in the studio. Im writing this review to add a well-deserved 5-star rating. Excellent, indespensible, a must-have.
B00005B238|5.0|I was throughly impressed with this film.  The cast nad their acting, the special effects, and the story were all very memorable.  This is a science fiction movie brought to reality, and theterror you feel while you watch it is very real.  This is a film that will be added to my list of all-time favorites.
B00003A9QL|5.0|I have always believed that the best in heavy metal approaches classical. Unfortunately, I have been disappointed by previous attempts to integrate rock and classic instrumentation...That is until now.<br />This combination really is the best of both worlds. I must admit that I am a fan, but not a big fan, of Metallica. However, I am well on my way to wearing this one out! The band plays in a way that is far superior to anything they have done previously. In fact, I often have to turn off the studio version of some of the songs on this album, because they're just not the same. <br />There are two important details that make this such an exceptional offering - the energy that the SFO and the band deliver playing together (I only wish I could have seen the show in person!) and how well the SFO and band mesh together to deliver emotion unmatched in most music today - classical or heavy metal! <br />The first CD is a good warm up. It would make a good stand alone offering all by itself. However, the second set really hits home. For Whom the Bell Tolls, Until it Sleeps and several of the others are truly intense. The winner, however, is One!. This must be played with your speakers wide-open. The SFO delivers an arrangement behind that band that could not be better. The band itself delivers the music as if they were the subject of the lyrics themselves. As you sit and listen, you will likely find yourself jumping between visions of the band and SFO throwing sweat in every direction and pictures of a soldier fighting his last battle with his own battered body! <br />This really is how music was meant to be. I firmly believe that, if some of the masters themselves were alive and composing today, they would want their music to sound like this.<br />This is a must have CD for almost anyone who likes classical and rock, or even just rock!
B00000JGEI|5.0|The special effects in this movie were better than the last, and the returning cast did a spectacullar job yet again.  This film is action-packed just as the first was, and even has room for a few tears for those of us who are criers.  There will not be a disapointed viewer.
1577311523|5.0|... Reading this book is great for keeping life in perspective.  We are not supposed to be happy and satisfied all of the time.  ... Good to know that the power of 'word of mouth' is working, and this book is now on the NYTimes bestseller list. ... It is excellent!  Very thought-provolking!
0790741520|4.0|This was a good film.  It immediately caught me off guard as Stven Segal was killed off in the first action scene.  Although I don't dislike Segal and his acting this movie was probably better off without him.  This is the first action film I have seen Kurt Russell in since Brackdraft and Stargate, and I always forget just how wonderful he doed in this type of film.  <br />The story line is a bit far-fetched as far as the rescue goes.  I don't see hooking up to a commercial jet-liner with a stealth via a cloth-like tube in mid-air probable.  I guess if anyone could find a way to make it happen it would be the military with these types of tools, but I just don't think it would happen.  If it did it probably wouldn't come off as well as it did.  If you can get past that you should enjoy the film however.
B000002U82|5.0|It took me about 2 year of listening to this album to discover its true meaning to it. At first I recognized it as a beautiful peice of music, which it is. One night after listening to the whole album right before falling asleep I realized what they were actually trying to get at. <br />First of all this album is beautifully melodic, and very atmospheric. It paints pictures of beautiful haunting places. Often times this album is sharply jarred away from this from the 3 tracks, Time, Money and Brain Damage. The album besides these 3 tracks are describing the great potential of human beings. But these 3 tracks show 3 great burdens that differs humans from reaching this goal: Time, Money or greed, and Mental Unstability.  The last track is amazing with the lines \\"And everything under the sun is in tune/ but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.\\"<BR>The moon being a metaphor for of course, Time, Greed, And Insanity. <BR>This album is nothing short of brilliant, an artist who approaches song writing with their mind on the album as a whole as an art peice rather than seperate songs is a dying breed.
B00003CXXM|2.0|If you want a more faithful adaptation (and I use the term lightly), you will have to suffer through the old mini-series starring Richard Chamberlain. Although, Damon is definately a cut about Chamberlain as an actor, the screenplay for this version of the Bourne Identity takes too much license with original plot. Important incidents are glossed over in favor of action scenes. And it seems the screenwriter only read two thirds of the novel because the last 80 or so pages are completely missing from this film. Dissappointing.
B00005QDW5|2.0|Pink floyd songs are great, yes. But, Pink Floyd albums are supposed to be listened to one album at a time for the full effect to take place. Combining various tracks into 1 cd would be like taking a bunch of artists paintings and cutting out parts of each one and randomly placing them as 1 painting, it doesnt give the proper effect.
B0000640VO|5.0|The first time I saw &quot;Amelie,&quot; I knew I had to buy it!<br />Audrey Tautou plays the adorable Amelie, a young woman with a mission to help make good people happy and punish the bad with mischeviously clever tricks.<br />This is a charming movie, very well played by the entire cast of actors.<br />If you want a movie that'll make you giggle, this is it!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|After watching this film for the SECOND time, I realized how brilliant it was. This movie shares an amazing soundtrack, with vivid imagery and cinematography to create a truly artistically moving film.  A blatantly honest film about addiction, this movie made my tummy hurt.
B000001IQH|5.0|Just as Green Day aped the Ramones, their contemporaries in this Southern California punk quartet aspired to be the Clash. But also like Green Day, Rancid's fresh approach and excellent songs (including the ska-punk MTV hit \\"Time Bomb\\" and the anthemic \\"Roots Radicals\\") rose far above tribute-band level. These guys are better than The Clash (which is also a great band) and it is full of awesome punk/ska songs. This is a must have CD for any punk fan. Buy it today!
B000002H70|5.0|A girl in HS gave me this cd back in 1989...  I should call her and thank her! This 72 minute melancholy musical masterpiece will inspire, and move 9 out of 10 listeners. Every track is worthwhile. This is one of those cds that invites you to listen to it from start to finish and loudly! There's a small pasage in the liner notes that states this cd should be played loud! Disintegration is definitely less pop than some of the other offerings of the cure, but that's a good thing. This is The cure at their best!
B000084T18|5.0|What can i say? This album is awesome! When you get the biggest names in the industry backin this album like dre and eminem, you create somethin special. And thats exactly what this is, special. The production and the beats are killer. There are so many good tracks on the album its hard to say which one is best, but wanksta gets better everytime I hear it. GO OUT AND BUY THIS ALBUM RIGHT NOW! Im serious, you will not regret it. This definetly is one of the top albums to be released this year. So get this album and listen for yourself!
B00006RU5B|4.0|This is the one cd I waited all year for and the wait was worth it. This cd is much more than a melting of rage and soundgarden. The first 4 tracks come on with the best parts of rage and soundgarden preserved... my favorite song is &quot;gasoline&quot;. Then something cool happens, you forget the bloodline of this band and really start to hear Audioslave. I hope they stick around and give us a few more awesome cds.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|Tatu is the first Russian group to be such a success around the world.  I heard all of their albums and every one of them is great. Everyone should find something that they like from this cd for sure.<BR>P.S. TA lybit TY is the meaning of their name, which means one girl loves another one.<BR>TATU is the best of the best!
B000088E6M|5.0|I downloaded this cd about a week ago and after i burned it i havent stopped listening to it.. every song on the whole cd is worth listening to. 50 cent is the man, on Back Down he goes at ja rule the whole song,  so buy it download it burn it do whatever just get this cd its worth 10 stars
B00005M91K|5.0|This is a great film, so great that I now own three copies of it (I am not making this up).  It is a testament to the ignorance of DVD developers that I have had to abandon my second purchase of Baraka (my first was the VHS tape) because it was not in anamorphic widescreen format.  This means that on my 30\\" widescreen HDTV, my only two choices were to watch the original aspect ratio in a tiny little centered 20\\" screen, or to watch it stretched out and distorted.<br />On this third go-around, I finally have a decent picture and am happy.  I hope that Amazon.com proceeds to always be vigilant about reporting whether or not the DVDs that it sells are in anamorphic widescreen format.<br />This is a great film and is a casual-viewing alternative to the more substantive and didactic -qatsi trilogy by Goddfrey Reggio.
B00006950W|4.0|To begin with, lets get one thing straight, video games do not make great movies. Like books, video games are a different sort of medium and when turned into movies are usually nothing more than cool bad movies. With that said, I was really surprised by RESIDENT EVIL.  I had never played the video game, so I wasn't sure what to expect. The movie uses film techniques and cliches borrowed from a host of other films, e.g. THE MATRIX, ALIENS, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD just to name a few. Yet, the movie sucked me in. I was enthralled by it. I got caught up in the action and the story and kept wanting it to go on.<br />There isn't much dialogue here and therefore the acting is limited to physical reactions, facial expressions, body movement, and action sequences. The movie starts off slow and confusing with the seemingly hodge-podge of scenes not making any sense. However, once the background to the film is given and after a few flashbacks are seen, things begin to fall into place.<br />The movie is classified as a horror movie. However, it's really more of an action/adventure or sci-fi movie with a little gore and for a horror movie the gore is rather tame.<br />I've read a lot of mixed reviews about people who have played the game. Some say it strays from the games plot, while others say (with the exception of character changes) stays pretty close to the original video game. I don't know. However, I do know that I really didn't think I would like this movie, but I ended up liking it and was thoroughly entertained for 90 minutes.
B00005N53P|5.0|A lot of people say. It's all hype and this really isn't all that great. Which is fine people are entitled to their own opinions. I bet though if Pet Sounds, Revolver or any other classic album came out today those people would be saying the excact same thing. The point is years from now all the people who say it's all hype and this and that will have to eat their words. Is This It is the best album to come out in a long time. It made rock 'n' roll fun again. It made rock bands cool again. It's packed full of catchy rock and roll songs. There isn't one filler on the album. Even if the band never top this we still have this album to listen to as much as we want.
B000088E6M|4.0|50 Cent should be glad that Slim Shady heard his mix-tape several months ago during a trip to LA via New York. 50 Cent has been featured on several compilations over the years and even had a \\"Best of 50 Cent\\" out in the streets. <BR>Today, 50 Cent is a \\"Rap Star\\" and Get Rich or Die Trying will only enhance his reputation more. We all heard the hot single \\"In Da Club\\" a million times over so there is no need to take it there. \\"Patiently Waiting\\" featuring Eminem will get the adrenalin going. Nate Dogg stops by on the west coast inspired \\"21 Questions\\"..50 Cent is in good position because hip hop heads on the east and west coast will enjoy this album. This is a platinum album but it falls short of a classic because of the subject matter. Like most gangsta mc's.....the concept of every track centers around brothers getting shot and robbed. 50 Cent is hot...no question but this fire want last too long...if you are looking for sunbstance...go cop Nas, Talib Kweli or Common..if you like that bang bang...50 Cent is your man...<br />t-hanes
014028902X|5.0|I've been to Corfu twice in my life and wish I had been 10 instead of 30 when I arrived the first time! This book I have reread probably 8 times and still find it amusing. Read it once and you will find yourself wondering why your parents took you to Disneyworld when Corfu was just a 7 hour flight away! Read it!!
B00003CWL6|5.0|Dustin Jones coplains that the bad parts of surbia is forced on you in this movie. When the truth of the matter is, no movie forces anything. It's an exelent movie that only a mature smart person can relate to. It's artful and the flaws it has is infact the beuty of it. As well as the stuff that is ment to be artful. <br />P.S. if any of the families of the astronots that died are reading bless you and the rest of your family and hope you guys will be able to deal with everything ok.
0972169504|2.0|I bought this book due to the recommendations listed here and was very disappointed! Not only was the print quality of the book very poor, the comic strip was only mildly amusing at best. This was surprising to me, because as a Ph.D. student, I am intimately aware of the insanities associated with grad student life, and thought they would be humorously profiled here. Although a few of the strips made me smile, none of them evoked the rolling on the ground laughter that I was hoping for. I guess I will have to find another diversion from my thesis! :)
B000084T18|5.0|i just bought this cd, its worth every penny and more.<BR>definately a cd you can listen to in the hood :)
B000063DS1|5.0|You just cant  get any better than the music these men have made, with the help from fellow performers such as Neil Young, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan, and many more.  With songs like &quot;Helpless&quot; with Neil Young, and &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;, from beginning to end this CD is a masterpiece.  You simply lose yourself in  the songs and are brought back to the time it all took place with the live recordings.  Ending off with &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; sung by everybody involved in the concert , it is one of the most beautiful songs ever. The DVD &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; is a must have as well.<BR>Enjoy

0140177396|4.0|Of Mice and Men<BR>                          ---------------<BR>                         By:John Steinbeck<BR>                        Reviewed by:S. Akkar<BR>                            Period: 1 <BR>  Of Mice and Men is a tragic story about the life of two different people. George, a short guy who is really mature, and Lennie, an enormous adult, who thinks like a toddler, have a goal. Their goal is to settle down in a land with many acres after getting a job somewhere successfully. Finally, George gets a job, and he has to protect Lennie from wandering around and his immaturity. Later, George kills Lennie because he knew he could not stand living with Lennie.<BR>  I liked this book. It shows how two totally different people live together. The character of George and Lennie was interesting in this book. It compares Lennie's immaturity and George's mental adulthood, which made me understand them more. Some examples in the book of their character comparison are when George gets mad at Lennie, who doesn't understand his anger. Quotes, such as,&quot;'I like'em with ketchup.' Lennie said. 'Well, we ain't got no ketchup,' George said&quot;, compares George and Lennie's behavior.<BR>  George and Lennie's goals were interesting to read about. Their goal was to &quot;live in a small house&quot; where Lennie could &quot;tend the rabbits&quot;. Their dream almost came to life when I read it. It was so descriptive and dramatic. Suddenly, when George killed Lennie, I felt sad, for now their dream was spoiled. This book was so interesting to read.       <BR>  My Favorite part of the book was when George and Lennie got the job. I thought they would not get a job, because in the book, Lennie &quot;lost every job for George&quot;. When they got their job, I was amazed to read how happy they were. Overall, this book was really entertaining, and I am sure readers from around the world will enjoy it too.
B00000AOUD|5.0|This album has always been my favorite. I say Jethro Tull live at the Cape Cod Melody tent 2 summers ago and they are just amazing. Definately purchase this album if you want the ultimate concept album.
B00006LSM3|5.0|This collection seems to have come from George's spiritual awareness, the contemplation of his own death, and dis-satisfaction with the Our mixed-up priorities.<br />Tremendous slide guitar (HOW DOES HE DO IT?!) and superb vocals.<br />Remember the intensity of The Art of Dying from All Things Must Pass?  This collection came from the same soulforge, if more introspective and somewhat more sedate.<br />This CD is full or winners.  I was going to list the better tracks, but they are all superb.  The only track that I don't love is (oddly) the title track which seems somewhat forced and a little heavy handed.<br />If you really get into Brittney Spears, move along, nothing to see here.  If you like music with some thought and honesty behind it, you're gonna love this collection.

6300263673|4.0|This movie is still fun to watch even though it's been out for fifteen years.  Patrick Swayze and Jennifer Grey are excellent in the lead roles of Johnny and Baby, and Jerry Orbach does a terrific job as Baby's father, Mr. Houseman.<br />The basic plot to the movie revolves around Baby and Johnny.  Baby and her family are on vacation at Kellerman's lodge.  It is here that she meets Johnny Castle, the smooth lodge dance instructor.  Although Baby has been brought up in a prim and proper manner, she is intrigued by the rough-looking Castle.  Soon, Baby is spending all of her free time with Johnny learning about him and his life.  The two become closer, and eventually a strong bond forms between them, much to the chagrin of her father.<br />The atmosphere of the 60's is evident throughout the film.  The clothes and music are sure indicators as are the innocent games of croquet, volleyball, and charades offered by Kellerman's.  Many references are also made to events of the 60's, such as the JFK assassination and Baby's desire to join the Peace Corps.<br />The best part of this movie is the music.  Several hits were spawned from the excellent soundtrack, and I always think back to the movie when I hear them on the radio.  The acting is excellent as well.  Swayze, Grey, Orbach, et. al. do a first rate job throughout the movie.  This movie has become and will remain a classic for many years to come.  Watch it and experience its magic.

B000001F9E|4.0|Although Thin Lizzy's one US hit was the rocking \\"Boys are Back in Town\\"  there is a lot more to be found on JAILBREAK. A sci-fi concept album with a rather confusing story, JAILBREAK is really about the dueling lead guitars of Gorham and Robertson, the growl of front man Phil Lynott (along with his far from shy bass playing), and Brian Downey's solid rhythm section.  Thin Lizzy just rocks along in a fashion that was a bit more sophisticated the many of their contemporaries, with shifting tempos and Lynott's obvious charisma. While not my favorite recording by this band, this is the one everyone knows and if you're a fan of \\"Boys\\", you won't be disappointed by the whole thing.
0316666343|2.0|This book came highly recommended from several sources and had a lot of buzz.  It turned out to be a lot of meandering new age hooey.  The writing was pedstrian, the plotting was not much either. Thumbs Down.
0596000480|5.0|Usually putting a subtitle such as &quot;The Definitive Guide&quot; on a book is a setup for a joke, but Flanagan's &quot;JavaScript&quot; neatly avoids this trap by being truly definitive.  JavaScript should be familiar as the implementation of ECMAScript found on most web browsers.  I actually picked the book up when I needed to embed ECMAScript into a speech recognition grammar formalism for work, a rather daunting task for someone who'd never read a line of JavaScript. JavaScript is designed for embedding; unlike Perl, Python or Tcl, it's completely isolated from the operating system.<br />The ECMAScript specification is dense, but more readable than the specs from the W3C. &quot;ECMA&quot; used to be an acronym for the European Computer Manufacturers Association; now it's just a name for yet another standards body.  Flanagan's book is the perfect bridge for a programmer who knows nothing to the spec.  <br />Flanagan assumes a reader who is an experienced programmer; this is not JavaScript for novices.  Basically, this is the Kernighan and Ritchie of JavaScript.  As such, the book is classically organized, taking the reader from syntax and control through the object model.   Most usefully, Flanagan clearly describes how the JavaScript object model works, which is no mean feat given the double inheritance chain along with the overloading of members, methods and constructors.   <br />For those who prefer source code, Mozilla distributes their reference JavaScript implementations: the Rhino implementation in Java, and the SpiderMonkey implementation in C.  The code is quite well organized and the Mozilla message boards are closely monitored by the coders. You'll also find the latest information on known bugs through their Bugzilla trackers.<br />Note:  Because I was using JavaScript for an embedded application, I thoroughly studied the first half of the book, but never even cracked the DOM sections in the back, which describe JavaScript's integration with web browsers.
B00005O5CM|3.0|Basically this movie starts out with Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) being the head of her sorority, a calendar model, and, well, ditzy. Her boyfriend is the very prestigious Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis), and things appear to be going fine between them until they go to dinner one night. Elle thinks he is going to pop the question, but instead he tells her he's leaving her because she's not excelled enough, so to speak, and then he goes to Harvard Law School. Surprisingly, she also gets accepted to Harvard Law, and she tries to pursue Warner while battling his new girl Vivian (Selma Blair), and the reputation that she's not smart enough to be there.<br />This movie is better than most people think. It's more interesting than your average dumb-blonde-esque flick. It's not the BEST movie I've seen, but it IS pretty good.
B000088E6M|5.0|Ok this CD can be sum'd up in one word. tight! Go  get it!
B000002UAO|5.0|This album to me epitomizes the true, classic Beatles; the point at which they had developed into mature, sophisticated songwriters, but before they had sold out and resorted to gimmickry. \\"Rubber Soul\\" is an album devoted entirely to honest, rock-solid songwriting, rather than the pathetic attempts at psycedelia that would charaterize their later albums.<BR>  That's not to say that this album isn't ahead of its time. \\"Rubber Soul\\" is a completely origional sounding album shaped by the Beatles' musical vision-a vision that was theirs and theirs alone. It is certainly one of sweetest, most heartfelt pop/rock albums ever recorded.
0767802470|5.0|Wolfgang Petersen's \\"Das Boot\\" has been called \\"the most realistic movie ever filmed.\\" I would have to agree. The film, based on Lothar-Gunther Bocheim's novel, documents life on board a German U-boat as the tide of the battle of the Atlantic was turning in favor of the Allies. Lieutenant Werner (Herbert Gronemeyer), a war correspondent, is assigned to cover the voyage of U-96 for the Nazi propaganda machine. By the autumn of 1941, the cream of the German U-boat crews were being replaced by hastily trained recruits held together by the few surviving veterans. The Captain (Jurgen Prochnow) and his trusted Chief Engineer (Klaus Wennemann) represent the last of these dying chivalrous knights of the high seas.  The result combines the loss of innocence coupled with the ultimate goal in warfare: basic survival.Prochnow steals the movie with a stellar performance as the Captain. Prochnow reveals the multi-layered personality of his character with finesse. On the one hand, the captain is obsessed with the hunt. He pushes his vessel and its crew to their limits. He seems to relish the stalk and the psychological game of wits waged between himself and the unseen enemy above. The crew learn to trust his intuitions and cunning as a means of their own survival. On the other hand he shows compassion for his own men as well as the enemy. For instance, when one of his officers reaches the end of his tether and abandons his posts during a long and brutal depth-charge attack, the captain was torn between shooting him or having the officer court-marshalled. He did neither. After resurfacing to finish off a crippled freighter like one would put a dying animal out of its misery, the captain is horrified to see crew members floundering helplessly in the water. \\"For the love of God,\\" he says, \\"why weren't they rescued by their own ships?\\" Knowing it was impossible to take prisoners aboard the U-boat, the captain agonizes along with his officers as he leaves the survivors to their fate.Thinking the British \\"no longer make mistakes,\\" the captain cannot understand why the destroyers hone in on his exact location and return again and again to drop their deadly depth-charges. In reality, for which the film does not make clear, the allied navies were constantly improving the three most important weapons against the German U-boat menace: radar and sonar; the convoy system with improved destroyer escort tactics; and wider air cover. The latter is not emphasized until the end of the movie. The U-boat captain's cunning and stealth was being outwitted by technology.As in Petersen's later effort \\"Stalingrad,\\" U-96's captain was bound to obey orders from the high command regardless of their futility.  Following orders, he attempts to sneak past the British fortress of Gibraltar knowing it is darn near impossible. The crew's efforts to revive the crippled submarine from the bottom of the Mediterranean will leave one on the edge of their seat. Again like \\"Stalingrad,\\" the ending will erase any semblance of political ideology and magnify the human nature of survival in war.The director's cut far surpasses the original VHS version. As in other DVDs, a full director's (wing-it) commentary adds interesting behind the scenes anecdotes from the making and reproducing of the film. I wish the producers would include an \\"historian\\" in these conversations to add the realm of historical accuracy to films of this genre. This DVD is a must own for the war movie fan. This masterpiece of film making gets 5-stars for its realism, action, and Prochnow's solid performance.inking the British \\"no longer make mistakes,\\" the captain cannot understand why the destroyers hone in on his exact location and return again and again to drop their deadly depth-charges.

B000065U1N|5.0|A very, very good war movie indeed, about a true story (which I did not know before). The action is great and very realistic, and there is lots of suspense; you actually get in the middle of the action and you might believe that you're part of it !!! The confused environment of the fight is also perfectly depicted. Finally, the necessary human touch is also present. It's the best war movie I've ever watched, and it's a movie to feel as well as watch.
B00006RCNW|5.0|But this show deserves a moment of my time.    The storyline (kudos to Shawn Ryan on that) is AMAZING. You watch the show and just get [drawn] in.     I remember sitting back and watching it the first time... I don't recall which episode but it really doesn't matter...    You see the NYPD Blue type show, you see the cops at the precinct (which they call the Barn), and then you see something amazing. Something the opposite of what a 'good' cop would do. Something bad.. but good.    And you like it. In fact with every move made by Vic and his team, you realize that things aren't done as nicely even by Andy Sippowitz, or the other TV cops. They are brutal. But generally, they get the bad guys off the streets, and get money on the side.    You just have to watch it. It's the best show on TV. And considering how many shows I've watched for a while and abandoned... that says a lot :)
B00006L7XQ|5.0|If you can find it, get the vinyl version.  It sounds better, and includes two additional songs--&quot;Whichita Lineman&quot; and &quot;Big Iron.&quot;<br />My favorites song on it is &quot;Sam Hall&quot;
B00005QFE5|5.0|In the fine tradition of Chinese movies, lost on US film-makers, is &quot;The Road Home.&quot;  Tender, endearing, moving, filled with hope, sorrow, and togetherness the film is crafted to depict life's passage and future.  Yet, for all of this, how can you argue with the added value of China's most outstanding young female star today in Zhang Ziyi?  Painstaking attention to the finest details and most poignant Mandarin Chinese dialog.  Love this film forever like, those of us, who have been so deeply touched by watching it!
B00005221L|5.0|Seriously, how could you hate this movie, and still call yourself a man.  The ultimate in survival horror movies.  The same team that brought us the first die hard movie brings us this masterpiece of a movie.  Each soldier in Dutch's squad is a true warrior.  And they're up against the ultimate hunter.  This is a must see for anyone that wants to be thrilled and chilled.  Buy it, watch it, and tell a friend.
B000088E6M|5.0|Without a doubt 50 Cent is the hottest album I've bought in months. I've been able to get a hold of a lot of his underground albums, so I been feelin 50 for a while now, and he continues to keep it flowin' on Get Rich Or Die Tryin'. You have to pick this one up A.S.A.P.
0060278269|3.0|Abhorsen is a good book to read if you have read the other 2 in the trilogy, however I wouldn't say it was the best book of the 3. There are lot's of bits and pieces that need to be sorted out. Lot's of questions remained un-answered. That is primarily why I didn't enjoy this book as much as I wish I had. It is truly disappointing how you are left hanging there. I have read other books that have left you somewhat hanging there, but this... there has to be more! Hopefully the Sinopsis above is correct and that Mr. Nix really DOES have some more \\"tricks up his sleeve\\". Although my review isn't very cheerful, I would definately recommend this book to anyone who has started the series!
B000VUQ4HW|2.0|This review has been written on May 4, 2008 (despite Amazon's header), and is a review of the Kino \\"Ultimate DVD Edition\\" of Nosferatu.    The only reason there are two stars rather than one is that this issue has an excellent restored and digitized print.  However, at 18 frames per second, it still seems jerky to me, with people's movements still not appearing to be natural.  Other marks against it are that the music score is uninvolving (despite it being \\"authentic\\"), and the English intertitles are too flowery to be taken seriously.    This has been a film I have tracked for years, having purchased the latest \\"restored\\" version as each has come out.    However, this time, since the print is superior to anything else I have seen, I decided to take matters in my own hand, and instead rip the DVD into my computer, and have my way with it with my editing software.    So now, the version that I have on my self-produced DVD is shown at 15 frames per second (what I always understood to be the European standard for silent films).  All the motions now seem very natural and emotionally involving, without any jerky or unnaturally rushed movement.    I also created my own English intertitles, drawing from the original German intertitles on the second disc, which produced a much more direct impact to the story.  Having control over the editing process also allowed me to shorten the length of the narrative intertitles so that you don't have to wait forever for the movie to continue.    Finally, I added my own film score, drawing from the many classical CD's in my collection.  The music is now emotionally involving, and helps carry the movie to its poignant conclusion.    Of course, having Danny Elfman do the film score would be even better, but short of that, all I need now is a good attorney who can help me secure the rights to the video and all the music tracks I have used, and I could market a production superior to any out there today... :-)
B00005ASQ1|5.0|As a published novelist, I was immediately drawn into this story.  In FINDING FORRESTER I could identify with the two central characters' passion for writing, for telling a story, conveying a fresh point of view, recharging creative batteries.  This beautiful film was like a taste of sweet nectar.<br />The story is more than compelling.  Jamal Wallace (Rob Brown) is an inner city teenager living in the Bronx with a declared passion for basketball--a secret passion for writing.  He makes mediocre grades in school so as not to call attention to his phenomenal writing ability.  A boyish prank suddenly thrusts him into the life of William Forrester (Sean Connery), a disgruntled, bitter, reclusive author living in a shabby third-floor apartment.  Forrester has published but one novel, half a century ago, a Pulitzer Prize winner.  He recognizes Jamal's talent, becomes his mentor.  The dialogue between the two characters as they discuss writing is powerful, mesmerizing.  As the story unfolds, Jamal proves to be as much of a mentor for William Forrester as the aging author is to his teenage friend.  The ending is tender, bittersweet.<br />F. Murray Abraham is excellent as the snooty Professor Robert Crawford, the film's psuedo-intellectual antagonist, and director Gus Von Sant gives us a story more entertaining than &quot;Good Will Hunting.&quot;  FINDING FORRESTER is highly recommended.
B000001E3L|5.0|If you're new to Van, start with his GREATEST HITS, VOL.1. If you're an established Van fan & looking for a live album that's nothing but Van, go with IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP NOW. But if you're looking for a live album that's a collaborative effort with great guest artists & plenty of soloing by the band, this is the one. I was initially hesitant because I don't care for medleys or extended jams. I expected it to sound fragmented & disjointed, but the whole show flows naturally. Van does indeed prove himself to be a generous artist, allowing others plenty of time in the spotlight, & the show is all the more entertaining for it. The guest artists enhance the performance, rather than getting in the way. Brian Kennedy & Van's own daughter, Shana, are both amazing vocalists. Candy Dulfer is great on sax, as is Georgie Fame on organ. Van, himself, even seems to be enjoying the show, in contrast to his more straight-to-the-point approach on IT'S TOO LATE TO STOP NOW. The back of the CD pretty much sums it up; ballads, blues, soul, funk & jazz (and I would add gospel). If you like these varied styles of music and a performer who's great at every one of them, don't hesitate to get this one.
B000088E6M|5.0|Wow! This cd is off the chains....if you dont have it u gotta get it....its a must for any1....50 does it with the lyrics and the bangin beats......i gave this cd a 5 because it deserves it
B00005U1YO|1.0|The Chemical Brothers prove to have some rare talent. The first track titled &quot;COME WITH US&quot; is truly absolutely great, stylish, climatic, cool, powerful, and damn memorable! That is one of the greatest techno (with possible trance-influenced) tracks I have ever heard by them. &quot;COME WITH US&quot; reminded me of the intense energy that track 1 on the first Crystal Method album gave us. Also, the final track on this album starts off &quot;okay&quot; at best, but than turns into something else. Very melodic, cool, something with lots of feeling and a catchy, interesting, uplifting chorus. <br />From reading this you might ask what is wrong with this album since I rated it a terrible, poor 1 star out of 5. The truth is ... that every track after Track-1 and before Track-10 on this album are the most generic, low-key, unambitious, boring, unoriginal, repetitive techno. Tracks 1-9 never come one-third to the greatness or quality of the first and last track. Unlike VEGAS, the great and only worth-owning album by the Crystal Method to date, Chemical Brothers don't make any truly good or decent tracks in the middle. They put all their talent, work, and creativity into the beginning and end track on this album. In the end, the final track can not make up for the boredom and tiresome tracks. It is as if they had more tracks than 10. They must have cut down their final songs to their best ten tracks, because it really seems that some of these tracks did not need to be here. They are worse than fillers. They are annoying, generic, boring. One song is actually club-trance or club-techno. It is a weak attempt at trying to create something aimed at the dance floor. Anyay, a true dissapointment to what has been done already. Chemical Brothers prove that they can compete against huge, known techno bands like The Prodigy and Crystal Method. However, by doing so with only one great techno track will not keep the audience. It will fade the few memorable moments of this overall below average with-one-great-track album. I wanted so bad to say more good, but everyone knows the first track is the album. Better luck next time.
B00000JPHD|5.0|For the age of this film, the acting is really quite good. Despite some great preformances by Bela Legosi(Dracula) and Edward Van Sloan (Van Helsing) the mad man played by Dwight Frye(Renfield) is the best part.<br />Just like wine is refined by age so is this film, a must have!

B000002OX7|3.0|This album is better without all of those \\"bonus\\" tracks. instead of adding all that [junk] to a good album and many others, why didn't the Who just use those songs on their box set...<br />It's not that the material added is bad, or that the material there originally was bad either, it's just that when you think of all these tracks that should've been on the box set, and how after \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" ends you just turn off the player, were all these extra songs used as wisley as they should've?<br />The answer is and always will be, a resounding no!
B00004Y6NX|5.0|This is not only my favorite Dire Straits recording, it is one of my favorite rock CD's of all time.  Never has Mark Knopfler's guitar work been more passionate.  Never have his lyrics been more poetic.  Never have his vocals been more emotive. &quot;Tunnel of Love&quot; has an unforgettable melody, dreamlike lyrics, and a haunting guitar that add up to one of the greatest songs ever. &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; tells a heartbreaking story, told perfectly thanks to Knopfler's dead-on vocals. Not a weak song to be found in this masterpiece.

0618001905|5.0|Most readers encountered Joseph Conrad's novel \\"Heart of Darkness\\" in English Lit 101. I was taught that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" was a metaphorical journey into the darkest heart of man rather than a realistic novel.  Reading \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" I realized that \\"Heart of Darkness\\" has a basis in cold, hard fact -- the brutal regime of King Leopold of Belgium in the Congo from about 1890 to 1910.                  It is often said nowadays that Africa was better off when it was ruled by the European colonial powers.  Hochschild's book will make you question that statement as he piles on example after example of Belgian brutality in the Congo.  Certainly, Africans were killing other Africans and an Arab-operated slave trade existed before the arrival of the Europeans  -- but the \\"civilizing mission\\" of the Europeans is revealed as mostly a scramble for the almighty franc.  Hochschild speculates that ten million people -- half the population -- of the Congo might have died of violence, disease, and mistreatment during King Leopold's rule.   The apt subtitle of the book is \\"A story of greed, terror, and heroism is colonial Africa.\\"           The author finds several possible prototypes for Conrad's fictional character, Kurtz, the colonial official who ornamented the fenceposts around his house with severed human heads.  As Conrad said \\"Heart of Darkness is experience...pushed a little (and only very little) beyond the facts of the case.\\"   The heroes of \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" are the human rights advocates and Protestant missionaries -- mostly British and American -- who brought the brutalities of the Belgian rule to light.                             The last chapter, \\"The Great Forgetting\\" is one of the most interesting.  The author details the efforts of the Belgians and other Europeans to forget, deny, and cover up the records of their abuses in Africa.  \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is a hard-hitting book that tells a story too little known about the seamier side of imperialism.

B00007E8O5|5.0|Jerry Cantrell once again proves himself at being one of the foremost Guitarist/Songwriters in the Hard Rock scene.  Degradation Trip Vol. 1 & 2 is the full vision to Cantrell's recent album, simply titled Degradation Trip, which came out earlier in 2002.  This new album is spawned from a 1998 intense writing mission, in which Cantrell isolated himself from the outside world and wrote for a few months.  It sounds extreme, but what came from it is no less than fantastic.  This album is a solid second coming for Cantrell, following his 1998 release Boggy Depot, which was his first solo attempt since the days of Alice in Chains.  <BR>Jerry Cantrell has really come into himself now.  Not since the Alice in Chains days has he been to solid.   Cantrell has put together a phenomenal band for this project as well, featuring Mike Bordin of Faith No More and Ozzy fame on drums and  Robert Tujillo, of Suicidal Tendencies and Ozzy's band, on the bass.  It is really quite impressive.  With this, plus some of the best songwriting of his career, Cantrell has really hit the mark.  Featuring the singles \\"Anger Rising\\" and \\"Angel Eyes,\\" this album is strong all around and if you are a fan of hard rock, heavy metal, or just good music, you'll love Degradation Trip Vol. 1 & 2!!!
B00005JK8K|2.0|John Woo: possibly one of the greatest action directors. \\"Face/Off,\\" \\"A Better Tomorrow,\\" \\"Mission: Impossible 2,\\" \\"Hard Target.\\" All great movies. So why does \\"Windtalkers\\" stink to a new high level of stinkness? Well, it's not very exciting, it's terribly predictable, and it's just not that realistic. I must say, as much of a John Woo fan as I am, he just didn't do too well with this one. Nicolas Cage is miscast as a war-weary veteran assigned to protect a Navajo codetalker from getting captured by the Japanese. Christian Slater plays his expendable buddy and the movie flops around for a long two hours with cheery war action, lots of dying, and no resemblance to the realistic movies of recent history like \\"Black Hawk Down,\\" \\"Band of Brothers,\\" or even \\"The Thin Red Line.\\" Heck, \\"Star Wars\\" is a more accurate war movie than this. I hope this is just a temporary setback for Woo, Cage, and Slater. They've all done much better.
6305537798|5.0|10 Things I Hate About You is a finely crafted and well-acted masterpiece in the teen movie genre.  The young actors in this comedy play their updated Shakespeare-inspired characters well, and help explain the Bard to a younger generation in a much easier and less &quot;Thou-filled&quot; manner.<br />Unfortunately, this movie was released at a time when a lot of teen movies were coming out, and all of the movies seemed to have a common thread of a guy getting paid to take out a girl (or betting on dates).  At that time it seemed a bit annoying, but now, it's just cool that so many were released because it gives teens a better selection.  10 Things is definitely one of the best selections that a teen (or a person of any age) could make.
B00000FCBC|1.0|Those must have been the words Lars used when this one came to be discussed. We all know by now that after the black album, Metallica sold out to mainstream rock radio so bad, that even ridiculous bands like System of A Down probably wished they had thouught of this: putting out a batch of HORRIBLE cover songs that makes James sound like he can't sing anymore. The 1st disc is a disaster: the Sabbath cover was bad enough, and not just vocally. But did they have to try and do the Mercyful Fate cover medley????!!!  I keep hoping Cliff Burton can't hear all of these releases, God knows what he'd be saying? The second disc is where the big rip-off and more bad covers come into play. They release all the old stuff off the 1st Garage Days, and then do the WORST covers of Motorhead!?? I mean these were REALLY bad. My advice: do what I did when I got this for a gift, and keep it on the rack collecting dust, until a day comes when it's out of print or something and you can make money on it. It's worth no more than that. This is the worst rip-off a major label band like Metallica has ever pulled off in my opinion. CAN THIS BE THE SAME BAND THAT RELEASED THE MASTERPIECE, MASTER OF PUPPETS???????? ZERO RATING Lars.
6305212139|5.0|Yeah, that's right this tape was awesome.  Not only does it have awesome music from a Spice Girls' concert, it also gives the average person who didn't go to the concert a chance to see the concert.  Definitely, worthy of coolness points.  :)
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is an amazing DVD. Ordering on Amazon[.com], it's SO unbelievably cheap - less than 12 dollars! Wow. And it's got loads of great extras. You get two commentaries, both very insightful and entertaining; you get 20 deleted/extended scenes, all with optional commentary; then there's the art gallery, the music video of the beautiful \\"Mad World\\" song, and tons more special features. If you're going to buy one DVD in 2003, buy this. And at Amazon[.com's price you can't go wrong. Amazing!

B00005V3Z4|5.0|There is always apprehension when the main cast of a science fiction/horror movie are teenagers (I know what you did last summer...). Unlike other teen flicks, Donnie Darko is in fact one of the most elegantly done teen science fiction movies I have ever seen. A wonderful blend of science fiction, fantasy, and macabre I highly recommend Donnie Darko.
B00000HYXB|5.0|What can I say? J.R.R. Tolkien + Blind Guardian = The Best Music Album Ever. As simple as that.<br />Blind Guardian is without any doubt the best power/speed/epic metal band that exists. This guys knows how to compose a song and how to write a lyric. But with this album they have reached the highest point in both areas. The music fits perfectly with the words, and with the concept of the album. Making a conceptual album always takes a very hard work, and this album is based in the most complex work of Tolkien: 'The Silmarillion'. But the germans gods of power metal are succesfull on translating the stories into the songs, sometimes with the beautiful lyrics of Hansi, sometimes with the brief interludes between the songs, and sometimes with the powerful, yet melodic, music of the band.<BR>I could write lot more about this wonderful state of the art album, but all you need to know is that this is a must have album. Get it as soon as posible. A M A Z I N G
B00000K19E|4.0|Whenever I am stumped at which movie to rent I always end up renting The Matrix. Without a doubt, this movie continues to amaze me with its special effects. It is expected that the plot would fall second to its special effects, but it holds its own quite well. I cannot wait for the next installment of the Matrix. I
B000002KZ6|5.0|I had just been to see Talking Heads' amazing concert film &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot;, and asked my parents for the album for my birthday (I think this was 1984). My family had just bought our first CD player, and I was looking forward to getting my first ever CD. On the day, I was disappointed to rip open the wrapping paper and discover a different CD to the one I was expecting - &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;. Apparently, the &quot;Stop Making Sense&quot; soundtrack had not yet been released in Australia. I hid my disappointment well, which was lucky - on first listening, the album was amazing.<BR>What is more amazing is that nearly 20 years on, it remains one of the most played CDs in my collection (and there have been a lot more added in those 20 years!) Also, the first track, 'Burning Down the House' is the most sublime pop song ever recorded.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|A great re-release from Russia with love. Definitely on the light side of the bubblegum scene, but with Trevor Horn behind them it may go good. Everyone has heard/seen \\"All the Things She Said\\" and I don't think anything more needs to be said of that. Just to prop these babes up from the one-hit classic bunch, I have to give a thumbs up for \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" as well as \\"Show Me Love.\\" I just hope that they don't let their image eat away thier chances at making a musical statement. We saw this in the last decade with Fem 2 Fem. I hope this helps open the door to more of the talent hidden in Mother Russia.
B00004ZD69|4.0|Godspeed You Black Emperor have become the new millenial<BR>darlings of high-IQ rock, and &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists&quot; is my favorite of their sweeping instrumental efforts.  &quot;Orchestral-rock&quot; is a good description, and at times one will be reminded of Mike Oldfield's fusion on 70s works like &quot;Incantations&quot; (although the end result definitely has a sound of its own).  Catagorized thusly as either an extreme prog-rock effort or (for those who do not wish to be identified with such the dinosaur genre) as an entry into the &quot;post-rock&quot; sweepstakes, the group lie comfortably somewhere in-between.  I say comfortably, because they manage to largely avoid the occassional pitfalls which have plagued both genres.  As one reviewer noted, the style of &quot;Lift Your Skinny Fists&quot; can become formulaic after a while (every track is based around an ambience which builds, crashes and then repeats), but the rich, full instrumental layers and original musical ideas found within the formula are for the most part exhilirating.  Whereas most popular post-rock acts like Tortoise, Labradford and Jessamine are characterized by an extreme minimalism and deliberate lack of energy that sounds like aural wallpaper, GYBE (with the exception of a few ambient passages within each 20-minute piece which predictably overstay their welcome) manages to be exciting and emotionally involving.  The finest track just might be the opening &quot;Storm&quot;, which is built around an ecstatic movement which does not sit still but seems to propel itself forward with the addition of new instruments and thematic sections into greater musical revelations with each repetition (the editorial review above gives one a perfect description of the piece).  <br />Anyone who says this album is bland or devoid of hooks must be kidding, for it is the prog-rock fusion blend of orchestral and rock instruments to create a sweeping sound, and the compositional prowess (both rhythmic and melodic) with which that sound is manipulated, which makes the group such a find. Furthermore, the playing seems very confident, as if the group has been a slick professional outfit for decades.  Although I can see that it certainly may not be to everyone's taste, the CD should appeal to fans of prog-rock and post-rock, or anyone who is interested in epic instrumental music with a powerful and distinct emotional pull that is as high as the geeky  compositional credentials of the musicians who created it.  At the very least, it's the best music to come out of Canada since Neil Young picked up a guitar; after offering us Rush, Celine Dion, Alanis Morrisette and other terrors for consumption, Godspeed You Black Emperor seems to have arrived with precisely the urgency of its name to redeem our neighbor to the north.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina told it herself, after her recording LADY MARMELADE she felt like changing direction, moving on and leave the teen bubblegum pop formula behind her.<BR>Well, this album will be some kind of a shocker.<BR>It opens with the feminist manifesto of CAN'T HOLD US DOWN, ft Lil' Kim as rap guest artist.<BR>WALK AWAY is a bluesy-tinged tune, a desperate admission at not being able to let go of someone who's bad for you but still makes you feel alive. <BR>FIGHTER is the rock song off the album, with Dave Navarro playing hard guitars all through it, and reminds me of Janet Jackson's BLACK CAT.<BR>INFATUATION and LOVING ME FOR ME are the more chart-oriented tracks: the former bordering to latin pop and the latter to ballad.<BR>IMPOSSIBLE is a work of love by Alicia Keys (writer,arranger,producer and back up/instrument performer), while UNDERAPPRECIATED is one of those big, old '70's R'n'B songs in the line of Aretha Franklin... <BR>Sure, she did stick to chart aims with this kind of track list.<br />The harsh part comes along when it is Linda Perry being behind the wheel...the album turns dark, haunting with tunes like MAKE OVER and I'M OK (strictly autobiographical and very punk-rock) - except for a couple of real sweet songs such as CRUZ and BEAUTIFUL (this one with a great line such as \\"We're the song inside the tune, full of beautiful mistakes\\"...one of the best lyrics i ever came across..).<BR>YOU GET MINE, I GET YOURS is the only exception to some kind of dance vibe, stands out maybe just for this one reason alone!<BR>DIRRRTY is the hip-hop transgression...the real first single that showed to the audience worldwide the new Christina Aguilera.<BR>Christina closes the album with another couple of ballads, maybe to sweeten things up - honestly, i would have preferrred a couple of Diane Warren songs, but hey...she's the artist in control...<BR>One thing is sure: she's grown up a lot..either you're shocked and [mad] at this new project, or you're thankful for her newimage, one thing cannot be denied...you have to grant her lots of guts and artistry in following her vision.
B00005OAIE|2.0|Don't get me wrong -  &quot;No Such Thing&quot; is a good pop song. In fact, my kids and I enjoy the song a lot and hence we bought the CD.  &quot;Why Georgia&quot; also is fairly catchy.   I also like the liner notes and the Periodic Table of the Elements graphic on the CD.   But, the remainder of the album is all about looking back on the good ol' high school days - something John Mayer has been out of for, what, three years? <br />The album has a very monotone sound with the same tempo and feel and same chord structure song after song.  I imagine that the lyrics have some relevance to those in the teen/ early twenty set - probably the group that he is aimed at - but I don't get it.  As an example, having John dream about what it will be like to go back to his 10 year high school reunion just does not resonate. <br />Maybe John Mayer will be worth listening to when he actually lives life for a while.  In the mean time, buy his CD single and forget the album
B00003W8NM|5.0|Another great film in the list of good Brad Pitt movies. He made a great career change starting with Seven and has yet to dissapoint. Norton also gives a great performance, which is par for the course with him. Kinda dark and violent, only a good date movie if your girlfriend is into S&amp;M.
B000002B7U|3.0|This is definately Ozzy's most underrated album. He teamed up with glam-rock produced Ron Nevison,(who produced Heart's self-titled album a year earlier, and Kiss' CRAZY NIGHTS the next), and the result is interesting. The title track opens with Castilo's pounding drums, and fades out with Lee's yawning guitar. Jake E. Lee wasn't as good as Randy Roads, but he definately has talent. \\"Secret Loser\\" isn't that good of a song, but \\"Never Know Why\\" is much better. It slower fades in Lee's guitar, before the drum track kicks the song off. \\"Thank God For The Bomb\\" is a rather lousy track, but \\"Never\\" makes up for it. \\"Never\\" is my favorite song on the album, beginning with a heavy guitar solo, and rolling out with a melody that matches Ozzy's echoing vocals perfectly. \\"Lightening Strikes\\" is a definate glam song, as is \\"Shot In The Dark, \\" and both are verycatchy. This album was simply an experiment that Ozzy did in the glam metal era, and it shows his ability to alter his style of music and still produce good material. Judas Priest experimented with a glam rock album this same year called TURBO, and it did very well. This Ozzy album is worth the buy for any fan of 80's metal. Add it to your collection today.
B0000399WI|5.0|With tremendous performances by Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins this movie is a work of art that leaves you warm inside. A must own for any respectable collection. Based on 80,000+ votes on IMDB this movie is rated second only to The Godfather, as the best movie of all time.

0767817478|1.0|This movie was terrible. It had every overused hollywood action movie cliche. The biggest insult of all was the final scene where one egg manages to survive. Hollywood can't forget their bottom line, no matter how terrible a movie you've always got to leave room for the sequel. I am ashamed that matthew Broaderick would associate himself with such a BAD movie.

B00005JKCH|2.0|This movie is everything I expected, a fine adaptation of a great comic, following the trend of X-men. But it is nothing more. If you want all of the excitement without the recycled hollywood superhero try reading the comic books. The only thing that might be worse is the new Ben AssFleck superhero movie.
0385484518|3.0|This book has received a lot of positive reviews over the years from the book-reading community. My personal view is that it may be slighly over-accredited. The book will however inspire you to think about life !! <br />Mitch Albom shared with us his real life lesson from his old college teacher Morrie (the 'Coach' as he called him), who was dying of ALS disease. In his so-called fourteen-week of lessons, Albom was enlightened and inspired by Morrie about \\"the meaning of life\\". Topics like Death, Family, Emotions, Money, Marriage, Culture, Forgiveness were covered.<br />I feel like Mitch Albom didn't put much time and efforts in writing this book. He just finished this as a project which he promised and felt obliged to Morrie. The depth of content is shallow, even it covers pretty lofty topics. Many of the pages are spent talking about Morrie's getting-worst-every-week dying conditions, while only a small fraction of the paragraphs are used to describe Morrie's conversations and his 'teachings' to him. <br />The structure of the book is also quite loose. Flashback memories written in between chapters are confusing sometimes, and look like they're just to fill up pages. Some of these 'interlude' paragraphs don't really have much relationship with what was written in the previous chapters.<br />The intention of the author, though, is still good. It could well be a good introductory book for teen or young readers. As for me, who is approaching 50 years of age in two years, this book seems to be too elementary with the depth it covers.<br />Now, tell me what you think....
B000084T18|5.0|This cd is one of the best cds that is coming out this year.  If you got a ride bump this, If you dont got a ride bump it.  50-Cent and the whole G-Unit click put it down.  Dont sleep on this cd ya heard.
B00005MP58|5.0|Marvelous adaptation, as praised before. However, I want to make some technical remarks on this widescreen edition. The back of the box claims an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 which is known as Cinemascope, but the true ratio is approximately 1.7:1. Secondly, the so-called Ultimate Picture Quality is exaggerated because the colors are as pale as on the TV-edition. On the other hand this edition has a Making-of featurette, which the TV-edition lacks. All in all it is undoubtedly worth five asterisks.
B000001Y2U|5.0|yes im a manson fan!! this is an AWESOME cd!! my favorite song on the entire cd, and possibly my favorite song in general, is 'deformography'. i just love the chorus, its awesome. this isnt my favorite manson cd, though, that would have to be 'holywood'. Dont listen to those d*cks who say marilyn manson is a 'machine' or just 'screaming' because if u actually listen to what he's saying in his music he's a brilliant man and he has his own beliefs, which i respect. Oh, just so u know, im not goth and im not suicidal and im not one of those stereotypical manson fans everyone assumes i am just because im a fan, so quit ur labeling! Anyways, forget about those people that say this isnt music or this isnt real metal! Because u know what, marilyn manson isnt metal. But manson is definetly music and definetly friggin great. i love manson, order this cd and i hope u will too.

B00005QDW5|5.0|<Echoes> has some of the best prog rock/rock songs by one of the best bands that has ever existed. From the rebellious \\"Another Brick in the Wall (Pt. 2)\\" to the soothing, deep \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" to the power-driven \\"One of These Days,\\" and to the irresistable \\"Bike,\\" <Echoes> houses everything. If you start at the beginning of the first disc and listen all the way to the end of the second, you'll have gone on a vertible roller coaster of emotions, ranging from sadness to anger to bliss. Pink Floyd are masters at that, screwing with your feeling through the power of music. The gems on this two-disc set include such works as \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"High Hopes,\\" \\"Learning to Fly,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Sheep,\\" and my personal favorite Pink Floyd song, \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond.\\" The range of music on here is vast: some songs are fast, powerful songs, others are touching, sad songs, while others are completely blissful and beautiful.<br />But, Pink Floyd botched, if just a little. They left out some vital songs that would have made this an essential collection: \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" is probably the most obvious, but other songs like \\"Speak to Me/Breathe\\" would have been a pleasant addition. <br />Nonetheless, <Echoes> is a must-have for any Pink Floyd fan, plus for those who are just getting onto them. <Echoes> has songs that will please a wide range of people, so it should be in almost any music fan's collection (unless your idea of \\"music\\" is rap).
0780631684|5.0|Final Destination is a great combination of black humor, horror and basic thriller. The movie opens admirably at the airport, Devon Sawa has a vision of his plane crashing before a class trip. He and several others get off the plane only to discover that it does crash, but things take a turn for the worse when they all begin to die strange deaths. Sawa, Ali Larter, and Kerr Smith all play their roles very honestly and naturally. As for the supporting characters, Kristin Cloke, Chad Donella, Seann William Scott, and Amanda Detmer all turn in excellent performances. Tony Todd makes an amusing and well conceived cameo as a sinister mortician who may or may not be death himself. The death scenes are original and unexpected and the special effects are breathtaking. The plane crash is one of the most realistic you will see. This movie also makes you think about destiny and how you live your life. Final Destination is definetly on the top of my teen horror favourites and a nice change from scream type movies. It's suspenseful, it has a great story, the deaths are unique and the gore is a visual treat. Highly recommended.
0425170349|2.0|Having read many Clancy novels, I was thoroughly disappointed with this work. His books have always dripped of his political and ideological biases, but this book was quite unrefined amonst its siblings.<br />I agree with another reviewer; the book does feel very James Bondish, but that is not a good thing IMHO. 007 is an exercise in absurdity, while Tom Clacy's works has historical been masterpieces of research and detail.<br />Mr. Clancy already touched on idea of chemical/biological terrorism in \\"Executive Orders\\" which was a far better story, in addition to being a much better political vehicle. The characters in RB6 are very shallow and their commitment to their ideals far too blind to suit their (supposed) intellect. Furthermore, the coincidences, which all Clancy novels tend have, were far tackier than usual.<br />I guessed the whole ending by about the halfway mark, skimmed the rest, and felt the hours were a waste of my time. I recommend reading older Clancy's -- for example Sum of All Fears -- instead.
B000088E6M|4.0|I just got 50's new joint and it is hot. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I haven't listened to the whole thing yet. I've only listened to the first eight tracks and it is sick. 50 is by far one of the hottest MC's out right now. That little runt Ja Rule better watch his back and start makin real music.  The DVD that comes with the CD is hot too because you get to know who 50 is, why he is the way he is and why he feels the way he does about Ja, etc. If you pick up one album in the next 6 months it should be \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin.\\" Holla At Ya Boi  GGGGGGGGG- G Unit

B00000099Y|5.0|Tool is the most definitive and emotional band I have ever had the privlage to listen to. I saw them in concert a while ago and they are unbelieveable. Anyone who does not own this albulm is missing out. This is the first Tool albulm that I ever heard, and I just couldn't stop listening to Mynard. This led me to discover the later Opiate and Undertow albulms from tool and they are just as good if not better. This CD deserves 10/5 stars.
B00005JLSC|5.0|The days of Hollywood musicals are back with the release of Chicago.  I cannot even begin to applaud this movie that is everything anyone would want in a musical.  Basically the plot is as follows: Velma Kelley (Zeta-Jones) is a cabaret star in 1920's Chicago who murders her husband and sister after she discovers their affair.  This double murder skyrockets Velma to fame.  Roxie Hart (Zellweger)is a wannabe star who uses murder to rise to fame.  Roxie and Velma meet when they are both imprisoned in the infamous Murders Row.  There they are taken under the wing of Matron Mama Morton, wonderfully acted by Queen Latifah, who helps them get lawyer Billy Flynn (Gere) who has never lost a case.  The stage is set for one of the greatest musical plots to unfold.  The only difference between the musical and the movie is that the musical numbers occur in Roxie's head allowing them to be as magnificent as they can be.  Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Richard Gere are excellent in their roles and they can definitely sing their hearts out.  With the songs \\"All that Jazz,\\" \\"Nowadays/Hot Honey Rag,\\" and \\"Roxie Hart,\\" this movie proves that musicals are back.  Everyone should see it.

B000001DV2|5.0|Yes, I know Hysteria and Pyromania are better all around, but this is still an excellent CD. Even with the death of guitarist steve clark, the band managed to march on and make some excellent tunes. Let's get rocked was made to be a single and songs make love like a man and have you ever needed someone so bad got significant radio airplay. Heaven Is is an excellent song, while Tonight and Stand Up are touching ballads. White Lightning, the seven minute epic dedicated to Steve Clark, is a beautiful song and I wanna touch you is very provacitive but is still a great song. Personal Proprety and tear it down are very solid songs as well. This album has gone triple platnium in the us and sold about 7 million worldwide. This CD, while not as good as the  classics mentioned above, is still a rocking CD drom beginning to end. Come on, Lets Get Rocked!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|When i first heard about the imminent release of Brave New World, i waited with great anticipation, knowing that the ultimate Maiden line-up was finally together. The return of Bruce Dickinson was a long time coming, and his return meant that Maiden would hopefully improve on the two, somewhat disappointing albums they made with Blaze Bayley at the healm. The welcome return of the masterful Adrian Smith would also ensure Maiden was in its strongest position since it began.<br />Upon first listening to Brave New World, I was instantly hooked. I realised that this was not just a great Maiden album to rival Killers, The Number of the Beast, or Powerslave, but this was actually Maiden's best ever album.<br />It is without doubt the strongest album they have ever done, and without any bias at all, i firmly believe that there is not a song on Brave New World that is even slightly disappointing.<br />From the start, Maiden showed a definate direction for their slightly modernised sound, without forgetting their original, classic feel. This can be demonstrated on The Wickerman, with its thunderous riffing, but with that unique 'Maiden' sound.<br />Whilst there isn't a disappointing song on the album, for me, the two standout songs are 'Ghost of the Navigator' and 'The Thin Line Between Love and Hate'. 'Ghost of the Navigator' is one of Maiden's catchiest and best ever songs, good enough to rival such classics as 'The Clairvoyant', 'Killers', and 'Hallowed be they Name'. It has one of the best choruses I have ever heard, and combines classic Maiden riffage, with sublime melody to create the 'perfect' song.<br />'The Thin Line Between Love and Hate' shows that maiden can add different dimensions to their songs, with 'The Thin Line...' being more of a rock ballad, whilst keeping that classic heavy chugging to ensure the Maiden sound is kept.<br />Brave New World is not only Maiden's best ever album, but quite possibly the greatest Metal album off all time, by any band. Brave New World shows that, whilst all the new rock and metal bands are trying to keep all the limelight, Maiden will never be broken, and so they remain the quintessential heavy metal band.<br />LONG LIVE IRON MAIDEN!
B000088E6M|4.0|If you like Eminem and that kinda stuff you should buy this CD. I heard some of 50's older songs and i couldn't wait until this CD came out because it is produced by Dre and Eminem. There are a lot of good songs, some of them are: Patiently Waiting, Don't Push Me, Like My Style, If I Can't, Many Men, Gotta Make It To Heaven, 21 Questions, Heat and more! There are two songs that feature Eminem and there both really good, and there are appearences by Nate Dogg, and some members of G-Unit. Buy This Album!!!
B00006ZSAD|5.0|From the first track of the album, 'Mysteries', you will be swept away by the acoustic sound and haunting choir that won't leave your head for days. Not to mention the Billy-Holliday-ish 'Romance', which is truly, maybe the most beautiful modern-day standard ever put on record. Every song in this record is flawless, except (maybe again) the last track 'Rustin Man', which is sounded like a forgotten demo version of a Portishead album. What can I say? This is the record that makes you want to spend your evening with your chick, burning arometherapy candles, sipping wine and make love all the same time. But beware..this is also the record that will creeps the hell out your thirteen year old sister who likes to sing Avril Lavigne tune in the shower!!! Apart from her day job as one of the respected singer ever to face from Britain, Ms. Gibbons truly is a gifted singer and songwriter that - as we witnessed this year - has made one of the most beautifully haunting record ever put on tape, with Out Of Season. I give it a 10/10.Period.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I'm not so wowed by this movie as some people seemed to be but I did think it was pretty good. The plot seems to do a good job of following what I remember of the comic book plot line, the dialog is comic book in nature but all right( after all it is a comic book not real life) and the special effects seem to do all right by me. Some complain that some of the action scenes don't look right but considering that a man is being portrayed swinging on a strand of web (the spider characteristics are the biggest variance from the historical plotline)I think they were well done.<BR>I got finished with the movie wanting something more, maybe the next one will do an even better job.<BR>The extra's should be a lot of fun to see, if I get it they will be the reason.
0812548094|5.0|I am breathless. <BR>I picked up this book 5 days ago and couldnt put it down before I knew how everything turned out. I had read the first book in the series a long while ago. Somehow i remembered how great it had been and anticipated a lot of its sequel as well.<br />I am breathless. <BR>The reading left me nothing short of my expectations. It is very hard for me to say whether the book is better than the first one. The books are excelent, yet they both seem to stand out on their own. If you liked the first book, you will love this one as well and after finishing it-<BR>You will be left breathless.<br />Goodkind begins his story exactly where he left off in the first book. However, he manages to pull in a great new set of characters (some likeable and some not) that add spice to the story. I'm not going to give any of it away - find out for yourself - it's well worth it!<br />Dear Spirits, please let me sleep at least one night before I pick up the third book...
B00006BTCA|2.0|Ok, I just borrowed this CD from a friend that has been raving about Interpol for awhile.  So, I listened to it a few times to give it a fair shake.  What I just can't shake though is the impression that the lead singer of Interpol is trying so hard to sound like Ian Curtis from Joy Division or Peter Murphy from Bauhaus.  I mean, if I had never heard either of these bands, I probably would have been pretty impressed and thought they were one of the best bands I have heard in quite sometime.  But, the sad reality of it, is that I grew up listening to bands like Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Bauhaus, and Joy Division.  Why do I need a new band that is trying to do what they did and not even do it much better?  <br />If you support this kind of music, then what incentives does it give to new artists to do what artists are supposed to do - be creative?  Sorry, but any band with the talent level that Interpol has (and looks) can listen to Joy Division day and night and then rip them off.  This is the same tactic that Creed did on Pearl Jam and they succeeded in pulling it off for a certain segment of the population.  I, however, thought the indie crowd was more sensible than that.  But this new breed of NYC retro bands like the Strokes and such are almost as bad.<br />What we need are more fresh innovative bands like Radiohead, Tool, Primus, Pavement, and Queens of the Stone Age that dare to be themselves instead of carbon copies of something that has already been done.  As much as I try to say, &quot;ah, just don't think about it and try to enjoy it&quot;, it's hard to dismiss the lack of originality, genuineness, and courage to do something new.  If all bands were like Interpol and the Strokes, music would never evolve and never be daring.  How boring would that be?<br />The hype machine can enjoy Interpol while the hype lasts.  I'll just throw my Siouxsie CDs in and listen to the real thing.  I'd rather not support Joy Division tribute bands that try to concealthat they are anything but that.<br />Music needs to progress, otherwise, stagnation will set in.  What is so hard about being yourself?
B000002B7O|5.0|If I was to make the top ten all time great rock albums, then surely this one will be on the list. 5 stars hardly do it a justify. Many people gave a higher rate for Ozzy's debut album &quot; Blizzard of Oz&quot;. Wait a minute, take a careful consideration and you'll see that this sequel easily outclasses that Ozzy's first solo album.<br />Each individual song in the album was great. I won't go for the individual song reviews. Overall, the songs may be less ear-catching than what are in the Ozzy's first album but musically it's no second to, whatsoever. Complication made simple, the composition beautifully combines a power of rock/heavy metal music into a farflung musical ideas, and eash song belongs to a class of it's own. <br />Equally important, the band's performance in this album totally shines over the first album's. Bob Daisy ( bass guitar )/Lee Kerslake ( drums )'s Rhythmic sessions was totally respectively outclassed by Tommy Aldridge and Rudy's Sarzo demonic performances. The star Randy Rhoad hits his summit on guitar voices on tbis album making his playing on the first album looks like a child play. <br />The all-time great. It's simple like that.
B00004R99J|5.0|This movie has to be one of the best Disney movies out right now. Disney goes for a more adult approach and puts a Romeo and Juliet type romance. And as for historical and geographical accuracy, sure the surroundings down in that area are very flat and don't have cliffs and such, the overall feeling of Virginia is maintained. (This is coming from an ACTUAL Virginian.) Plus, yes..Pocahontas was between 10-12 when she met John Smith, but... I honestly don't mind that they changed the facts around. It gives room to play with the story a bit..I mean, historians can't figure out what really happened anyways! There are 3 theories about Pocahontas saving John:      1. Chief Powhatan was really going to kill John and Pocahontas saved him      2. It was a ritual of the indians      3. It never happened because John was known for writing stories about leading ladies saving him.      So Disney took the most popular conclusion and the rest is in the movie I guess. So for those angry historians out there, stop being so literal and take a look at the movie to actually see the magic it holds.
055321263X|5.0|Laura Fairly is the innocent, the young, sheltered, Victorian maiden who abides by her departed father's wishes.  On his deathbed, he bids her to marry Sir Percival Glyde.  Enter villainy.  The grasping, frightened, short-tempered Sir Percival insists on a speedy wedding.  He handily dispatches any obstacles thrown up in his path; he is damned and determined to wed Laura--and her fortune.  But Laura has a sister, Marian, a strong-willed, independent, fiercely loyal sister who at first champions the marriage and then recoils once she realizes the true nature of Sir Percival.  The man is a monster.  And Marian will do anything to protect her sister.  Heroism, and then some.  There is also another, a drawing master named Walter Hartright, commissioned to teach Laura and Marian the fine art of watercolors.  He falls in love with Laura, and she with him--before her marriage to Sir Percival.  The drama should be obvious.<br /><br />But what of the title?  Who is the Woman in White?  Her chance meeting with Walter Hartright on the road to London provides the catalyst upon which the entire narrative turns.  She is at once and both the key and the puzzle.  She is a victim.  She is a harbinger.  She scares Sir Percival out of his wits.<br /><br />This book offers vivid portrayals of Victorian England, its mannerisms, its wardrobe, its inhibitions, its attitude.  This book eerily reflects our own time, our own angst, in the 21st century.  Once you read it, you'll know what I mean.  Deception has no age.<br /><br />P.S. Whatever you do, don't turn your back on Count Fosco!
B000084T18|5.0|There is not alot of words to explain this album so i'm going to make it as simple as possible. Pure Hotness. This is one of the best albums to come out this year..I know it's only Febuary, but come December people will still be talking about this masterpiece. Exective Producers Dr. Dre and Eminem do a great job of laying down the tracks and keeping the energy flowing through out the entire album: all 19 tracks.<br />With guest apperences from the GGG G-Unit!, Nate Dogg ans Slim Shady himself, 50 proves that is a true MC that deserves all the props that he does.

Running Time: 94 mins.<br />One side of disc is wide-screen, the other side full screen.<br />You are in for a real treat! I consider this film a comedy film noir, but serious enough for the viewer to enjoy a good murder-mystery. This film has a few twists in it. Just when you think you know who the killer is, Surprise!, they gotcha. There is plenty of fun and adult humor along the way.<br /> Excellent all-star cast to enjoy: Alec Guinness, David Niven, Maggie Smith, Peter Sellers, Richard Narita, James Coco, James Cromwell, Eileen Brennan, Peter Falk, Nancy Walker, Estelle Winwood and Elsa Lanchester.<br /><br />Option of language in English (mono), Spanish.<br />Option of subtitles: English, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Korean, Thai.<br /><br />Special Features: A Conversation with Neil Simon.

Sometimes I will watch this film again just for her comedic performance. Her delivery of lines is perfect. David Niven always a class act.<br /> Peter Falk wears a trench coat again, which of course reminds us of his \\"Lt. Columbo\\" character he played for 32 years in the [[ASIN:B0002COTDA Columbo - The Complete First Season]] (1971-78) tv series and returned for 24 tv-movies (1989-2003).<br />  It's neat to see Eileen Brennan in a good, funny role.

6305609705|5.0|\\"I watched a snail crawl across the edge of a straightrazor. Its my dream, its my nightmare. Crawling, slithering across the edge of straightrazor and surviving.\\" That's the voice of a man called Kurtz, an enigmatic officer that's gone \\"native\\" in the depths of Combodia. Your mission objective is simple enough, go up the river, locate Kurtz, and terminate with extreme prejudice. Unfortunately, many things are remiss in the oversimplified statement, \\"Go up the river and kill Kurtz.\\" Just ask Captain Willard, who's been wanting to submerge himself within the depths of warfare once more and has now been given this onset of a message, intercepted from the prize, Wiliam Kurtz. His mission is simple enough, going up the river and finding his prey of a man, or at least that's how it seems. In the beating heart of the firestorm called Vietnam, nothing is easy, though, and Willard, submerged beneath the veins of madness and brutality as he seeks that elusive objective, begins to understand that more and more in the process.<br />The strange thing about Apocalypse Now, set in the tinderbox of Vietnam, is that it isn't focused upon the sole event of the man forging through the jungle to go and capture the renegade named Kurtz. Instead, borrowing from its predecessor \\"The Heart of Darkness\\" - to which the film makes it clear that it pays a great deal of homage, it is about the madness of the events set into motion engulfing this one small figure and the futility of many of the actions/interactions located along the way. As Willard tells you in the beginning of the film, this is his confession on the matter, letting you know that he, too, is a guilty party in the chaotic affair that gnaws hungrily at the souls of all involved. Therefore, in a sense, he is also a party to the insanity taking root all over the feature. I found this to be an interesting affair, not only in the conceptual depiction of the insanity feeding upon the soldiers that we find ourselves focused upon, but in the questions the movie poses as it presses onward, showcasing more and more of the perversities by the same forces that label a man like Kurtz mad and yet birth asylums in their own ranks. The stellar casting accents this further, letting forces like a young Larry Fishburne and an equally young Harrison Ford play side by side with the Sheens and Brandos as they showcase a diversity of talents. All to destroy an enigmatically tormented soul.<br />Even if you've seen the movie before, the DVD is a pristine example of restorative technology can do for movies that deserve preferential treatment. This example is one of the best I've seen, showing its viewers the wonders involved in the art of making a very dramatic example of what warring encompasses. It also has some interesting extras, including the comparisons to Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" letting someone that hasn't been inducted into the work taste some of the symbology buried within those pages. For these reasons and because of other, more addictive loves that encompass the \\"smells of napalm in the morning,\\" the abnormality of the color spectrum when one  chemically bends it in the middle of a battle, and because of the sheer scope of the cinematic equation, I'd have to issue directives for everyone to buy.n the questions the movie poses as it presses onward, showcasing more and more of the perversities by the same forces that label a man like Kurtz mad and yet birth asylums in their own ranks.

B000002C1W|5.0|This is the first post-Waters album released by Pink Floyd.  How good this actually is really depends on who you talk to.  Clearly the band lost a monstrous talent when Roger Waters decided to leave.  His lyrical and conceptual ideas, as well as his sense for dramatic presentation (both on stage and on record), are unmatched.  Pink Floyd became the band that it is in large part because of Waters.  Equally responsible for their direction and success, however, is David Gilmour.  He is a masterful musician and a brilliantly passionate guitarist who has helped shape the band with his unparalleled playing.  Arguably it was Gilmour's emotional guitar and musical talent that gave power to Waters' words.  Though noone can dispute the vital contributions both Rick Wright and Nick Mason made to help forge the band (nor founder Syd Barrett who laid the template for the rest to follow), most would certainly agree that Gilmour and Waters have always been the main driving force.  <br />Now where does all this leave A Momentary Lapse Of Reason?  With Waters gone, obviously a large portion of the chemistry that spawned such classics as Animals and Wish You Were Here is missing.  The band's direction and approach to writing would naturally have to adapt, in much the same way they had to adapt after Barrett's departure.   Lyrically the album is weak in spots.  It contains no conceptual thread nor does it even begin to approach Roger's level of clever wordplay and stinging sarcasm.  The lyrics are more poetic generalities than they are deeply  held convictions.  That being said, this album is a gorgeous work of music that, in certain ways, harkens back to Wish You Were Here and Meddle.  Sounding like neither, but capturing the spirit of both, A Momentary Lapse Of Reason is absolutely a return to form.  Without Roger's lyrical genius, Dave wisely focused on HIS strengths and passion: the music.  From the chilling instrumental opener Signs Of Life, to the glorious raging darkness of thealbum's closer Sorrow, this is Pink Floyd in all their musical glory.  The album has a dark haunting quality to it, each song moving through several interesting parts that  never sound dull or forced.  The beauty of this band's sound has always been that it's very visual and evocative.  This album certainly delivers that.  In particular the last half is one phenomenal stretch of spine-tingling music.  Keyboards, drums, bass, and the occasional saxophone blend wonderfully with sinister sound effects to create beautiful soundscapes - and Gilmour's spectacular guitar slashes, cries, whispers, screams, and howls throughout the entire journey.  It is a ride worth taking.<br />As you read through many of these other reviews, it's obvious that alot of people feel very strongly that this is not a Pink Floyd record.  I understand but disagree.  As much as the band had a right to carry on after Barrett left, clearly the band had a right to continue after Waters.  Arguing over the &quot;authenticity&quot; of this album (and all those that followed without Waters) is pointless, as every listener has his or her own idea as to what Pink Floyd is to them.  To put it simply, if you feel that the lyrical and conceptual content of Pink Floyd is undeniably the most important aspect to you, then you're probably better off passing this up.  At the very least borrow a copy before you buy it.  However if the music of this band is what has always moved you, then you're going to love this.  Roger Waters may have left, but Pink Floyd remains.
B000088E6M|4.0|This is real classic hip hop.  If ur lookin for commercial rap this aint the album straight hardcore hits. Only 2 tracks wasn't hardcore in da club and 21 questions.  And they r still basically gangsta rap.  Dre and Em gave him what I thought was great productions.  All the beats is just rugged and his lazy flow makes it work.  Just like he said in one track if david can go agains goliath with a stone I can go at nas and jigga.  The track when he dissed ja crazy just back down.  Jah u ain't ready just like he told irv if he could he would sell his soul 2 be suge.  It's 2 many hot tracks on here 2 say my favorite he has only 1 decent track and that's 21 questions.  This is true hip hop at it's best if not then u don't know music.  He won't win any awards cus his style but like he's said on 1 track u like his style.  This album can have the whole hood jumpin.  HOLLA AT 50, Murder Inc or anyone has anything on GGGGG-UNIT  I wanted 2 give it a 4 1/2 but didn't know how so.  I didn't have 2 skip not 1 track I just let it bump all the way through cus u couldn't stop.  Didnt' matta how hot the track was i was just anxious 2 here the next track.  Only thing wrong wit the album its one sided and a bonus track life on the line (from his first album) is on here.  I didn't understand that.  But this one sided album is better than havin' a onesided album of straight commercial rap.  How he said u sing for the girls(explict change the word) and sound like the cookie monster.  Which is true, Ja is wak and he let the world know (like we ain't know already).  Get rich or Die Trin' that's all I have 2 say, just me he's gettin' rich now and his music ain't gonna die like some artist.

It's hard to believe that Off the Wall has never got the respect it deserved because of Thriller.

0345413377|2.0|As a child, I remember reading The Chronicles of Narnia, adoring them,  and then feeling cheated when I was old enough to realize that C.S. Lewis was really talking about Christ and Christianity (I was raised as an Ethical Humanist). Eventually I got over it and learned to love the books again, as well as the books of Madeleine L'Engle and  other Christian writers.<br />But as an adult who has since become a Christian AND a scientist, I don't know if I'll ever be able to get over my disappointment with the Amber Spyglass. I read the first two books and loved them, and was very interested to see how Pullman would resolve the theological puzzles he had set up in The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife.  When I read that one of Lyra's names was \\"Aeshaster\\" (excuse the spelling), I wondered if Pullman was alluding to 'Easter', and planning to link Lyra with God's love and desire to wipe away sin, turning her into a Christ figure.<br />Instead, Amber Spyglass resonates with deep disappointment in Christianity and especially Catholicism. We are served up God as a dying angel and the Church as a mix of murderers, pedophilic priests, and inquisitors.  Christ, unsurprisingly, is nowhere to be found. After all, a loving Christ who gave his life to bring people closer to God and free them from sin and death would not fit into Pullman's assessment of the Church as being interested only in obliterating every good feeling and impulse.  Nor is it spirituality and the supernatural that are on trial here, it is the Christian Church, period. Pullman gives a loving or at least balanced treatment of shamanism, witches and Tibetan Buddhism, for instance.  I don't object to Pullman listing the abuses of the Christian Church, past or present. I think that's a worthy subject. But in writing this kind of one-sided portrayal, Pullman is at best attacking a straw man, and at worst , is offensive and deeply misleading. Even C.S. Lewis's treatment of the Calormenes in the Narnian Chronicles, which has justly come under fire for tones of racism, is more positive and balanced than this stuff (and Lewis was writing fifty years ago, after all).<br />Perhaps it's ironic that, although Pullman casts Lyra in the role of Eve, she ends up becoming a Christ figure after all. She travels to the land of the dead to redeem a life and rises again, which no one in that world has done before. Like Christ, she desperately wants to provide comfort to all souls, even ones as difficult to love as the Harpies. And again, at the very end of the book, she makes a great sacrifice for the world  because of her great love. There are even overtones of this in Asriel and Marisa Coulter's decision to sacrifice themselves for the sake of their daughter, all in the name of love. If children and adults can recognize Christ or Christian themes in these roles, then that gives me a little comfort.<br />I'm giving this two stars, because the storytelling is still excellent, although this seems like the weakest of the three books.hich has justly come under fire for tones of racism, is more positive and balanced than this stuff (and Lewis was writing fifty years ago, after all).<br />Perhaps it's ironic that, although Pullman casts Lyra in the role of Eve, she ends up becoming a Christ figure after all.

B000088E6M|5.0|From the clanging of change in the ominous introductory track to the final fade of the third bonus track, 50 Cent's major label debut has certainly lived up to its gargantuan hype. Here's a quick review for each track on the album.<br />1.) Intro - (N/A)<br />2.) What Up Gangsta (10/10) - An excellent song to start off the album with. Catchy hook, well-produced beat. Possible future single.<br />3.) Patiently Waiting (8/10) - A quality song featuring Eminem, who comes through with a rather tight verse.<br />4.) Many Men (Wish Death) (9.5/10) - Another amazing hook and beat. One of the best songs on the album.<br />5.) In Da Club (8/10) - Second single off the cd. Better than \\"Wanksta,\\" but not by much.<br />6.) High All The Time (9/10) - One of the best ode's to marijuana in many a year. Twirl your green up for this joint.<br />7.) Heat (8/10) - Another good song.<br />8.) If I Can't (7/10) - Decent song, 50's done better.<br />9.) Blood Hound (10/10) - Oh man...... I can listen to this song all night. Instant classic.<br />10.) Back Down (10/10) WHAT?! TWO CLASSICS IN A ROW?!?!?! Anyone who insults Ja Rule this maliciously deserves respect in my book. Add in stinging lyrics and a hardcore beat, and you get Back Down.<br />11.) P.I.M.P. (7.5/10) - Misogynistic as hell, but any and every pimp can ride out to this one.<br />12.) Like My Style (8/10) - A hot song. Would've scored higher, but the track didn't showcase Tony Yayo's talent as it should have.<br />13.) Poor Lil Rich (9.5/10) - An older track given a facelift by amazing new production. Killer beat.<br />14.) 21 Questions (8/10) - Nate Dogg blessed this track. Good song.<br />15.) Don't Push Me (10/10) - Wow..... Another one of my favorites. Lloyd Banks is amazing, Eminem is even better in this track than in 'Patiently Waiting,' and 50 is on point ONCE AGAIN.<br />16.) Gotta Make It To Heaven (8/10) - A good track to end off on.... BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!<br />17*.) Wanksta (8/10) - First single off the cd. Oddly enough, it's only a bonus track. A good track, but there's better on the cd.<br />18*.) U Not Like Me (10/10) - A street classic, was first released just after 50's last incident being shot. Incredible track.<br />19*.) Life's On The Line (10/10) - The true final song on the cd, yet another street classic. Old 50 cannot be beat.<br />* = bonus track
0671027344|5.0|The thing that really makes this book great is how much I related to it. Is it possible to be in love with a book character? I only wish Charlie was real so I could have a chance of knowing him. The way Charlie says that the most recent book he has read is his facorite is me. The only thing is, I have read other books, and this is still my favorite.
B000088E6M|5.0|This is one of the best CD I've listened to in a long time.  He is real, and ain't afraid to say what he has to say.  Ja Rule you better watch your tongue because you ain't ready for 50 cent.  If the rest of G-Unit is say good as 50 cent then that means we have great things to come.
B000002LUB|1.0|To give this album 5 stars you gotta be out of your (musical) mind! This is without doubt the second worse album from Sabbath. If you like \\"Heaven or hell\\" this is not for you, but if you think Dio's \\"Strange highway\\" is a masterpiece, I guess this one will satisfy your twisted taste.
B000056K04|2.0|I felt that this CD was sub-par for Dave Matthews Band records.<BR>While it would have been a masterpiece for any other band, fan of the Dave Matthews Band have come to expect more musically from the band. The lyrics were almost there, but the music was just way off. If you liked Crash, Live and Luther College and Under the Table and Dreaming, I wouldn't recommend this CD for you.
B000005RNQ|5.0|In the late 1970's a new (sub) genre begin to rise - New wave of British heavy metal - combining traditional hard rock with punkrock. You got a lot of young bands with energy and attitude. One of these bands were Saxon, and together with Judas Priest and Iron Maiden I'd say that they inspired many to follow. Saxon's \\"Denim &amp; Leather\\" isn't just a milestone in the bands career but also a very important contribution to the development of heavy metal and the shaping of the group feeling among heavy metal fans. In the song \\"Denim and leather\\", Saxon are not only paying respect to their fans but also plays a major part in the forming of the metal community \\"...denim and leather, put us all together. It was you that set the spirit free\\". In \\"Never surrender\\", Saxon gave voice to those who weren't born with a silver spoon, and in the great \\"And the bands played on\\", Saxon even further let us know that we all belong together: fans and bands. This album is packed with great heavy metal songs and especially worth to mention is the excellent opener \\"Princess of the night\\".
B00006J9OT|4.0|Diana Krall is an excellent piano player and quite a distinctive vocalist.  The thing I love about her is that she continues to work at it.  Her interpretations of this music are intelligent, studied, and fresh, but they are also passionate.  And as her interpretation of Joni Mitchell's &quot;A Case of You&quot; shows (without question) Diana can also be very sincere.  I hope that she continues to move in this direction; her voice is just fine without all of the vocal tricks and various breath gimmicks.  It also re-establishes some of her street credibility as a serious musician after some serious marketing faux pas's.  I certainly don't mind gawking at Diana's gorgeous physique (her Honolulu concert that year was also quite good), but that's not why I buy her records.<br />This is an excellent presentation of how affecting Diana can be, and is, I think, overall her best album yet.
B000084T18|5.0|MARK MY WORDS! 50 CENT WILL BE A STAR! HIS INDEPENDENT CD'S WERE THE HOTTEST AND NOW HIS MAINSTREAM DEBUT WILL BLOW THE ROOF OFF! THE GUY JUST KNOWS HOW TO PUT A SONG TOGETHER. SO DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND GET 5O CENT IS THE FUTURE, NO MERCY NO FEAR, GUESS WHO'S BACK, AND MOST CERTIANLY COP THAT LATEST ONE GET RICH OR DIE TRYING.                      I'M OUT!!!
B00003CX95|5.0|One of the Best Movies I've seen-many times!!
B000088E6M|5.0|I think 50 Cent is one of the greatest out right now. He is so talented. he got great hook great song n he just doin it from thae heart. This album is the one u could put it in your Cd player n let it play through . so it you read u know to go buy this album G_Unit<br />Free Yalo
B000088E6M|5.0|An awesome cd of the hottest up-and-coming rapper since eminem!<BR>I was a little hesitant at first, because I wasn't sure if 50 Cent was the real deal.  Luckily, after listening to the whole cd, I was amazed at how many HOT tracks there were! Just about every song has a great beat, and I especially loved the tracks with eminem (\\"Patiently Waiting\\"; and \\"Don't Push Me\\").  \\"What up Gangsta\\" is a tight track too.  If you loved \\"in da club\\", you definitely won't be disappointed with this cd, so get it quick!!! Even the bonus tracks are incredible, which includes his classic \\"Wangsta\\", plus \\"U Not Like Me\\" and \\"Life's on the Line\\" (both of which complement this cd as well).  His name may be \\"50 Cent\\", but this cd says \\"a million bucks\\".  It even comes with a free dvd.  I mean, what can you lose?  Buy it now, and don't spend it on cd's that have only two or three hot tracks (such as Nas' \\"God's Son\\", Nelly's \\"Nellyville\\", and Jay-Z's \\"Blueprint 2\\")!
B000088E6M|5.0|This CD is HARD! I mean damn this is the first 50 cent cd I bought and it's great.
B000066NW0|2.0|I liked this CD the first five times I listened through it. After that, all the songs started to sound the same and I realized how annoying her voice got. Her lyrics are less than original and no where near creative. <BR>Doesn't really take a genius to rhyme 'red' with 'head.' Example: \\"My cheeks are turning red\\" to \\"I'm searching for the words inside my head\\" (taken from Things I'll Never Say).<br />The beat gets repeatitive. And what really ticks me off is the fact she yodels in \\"I'm With You.\\" If you can't carry a note for that long, just soften it up or edit it out. Don't butcher a good song by sounding like you have the hiccups.<br />Note to all those judging her image: This isn't a picture. It's a CD. A CD has music on it. Listen to the CD before you critize (sp?) the music and artist. So what if she says she's punk and doesn't sing it, she can say she's a donkey for all I care. She's a singer, not a role model. It's the music that counts anyways.
0440180295|5.0|fyi for vonnegut fans: he was in fact in the 106th division in WW2. The 106th was in Europe for 15 days prior to absorbing the brunt of the Germans at the Battle of the Bulge. He was became a prisoner of war, and was sent to Dresden just prior to the fire bombing. The American prisoners were in fact kept in a makeship slaughterhouse. Read \\"A Blood Dimmed Tide\\"
B000088E6M|5.0|The only word for this Cd is DAMN! I mean i bought the cd and from the beginning to the end it's nothing but straight up tight music. You can get down to every song on the CD. There ain't no song on there that's not tight. From the wild combinations or lyrics to the tight ... beats this CD will go over Triple Platinum. I hope, matter of fact you...better get this damn CD...
B000088E6M|5.0|Man, this is the hardest album to date. Everywhere you go you will here it all over the streets in every state. Selling out everywhere. The hardest song on the album is &quot;In da' Club.&quot; I personally talked to 50. He cool and his album will bang heads. For all the h8ters, go cop the album then come and holla at me. No doubt 50 is hott. Hotter than fire itself.<br />Mz. Kitty
B00005OAIE|5.0|I was a little edgy when it first came to buying this Cd, after only hearing the single &quot;No such thing&quot;, but it turned out to be a great investment. John's style of music is a fresh break from everything on the radio, and I enjoyed the variety of music he provided on the CD. Not only does he write catchy lyrics and have a unique voice, but he has a great talent for playing guitar. Absolutely inspirational, I've never had such good things to say about an artist (except maybe Norah Jones and Avril Lavigne). I suggest that before you decided that you don't like his music, check out a few other songs like &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, &quot;Not Myself&quot;, and &quot;3x5&quot;, they are all played extremly well and yet very different from each other. Can't wait to hear more from you John!
B00004XOWM|1.0|.......seriously,don't waste your money in these stupid things....you rather give it to welfare or something....we hope not to see these guys once again ever....and we hope that Less Is More never face the day light
0689835604|5.0|Purchased this for my 8 month old grand daughter and it is always new and fresh for her--she simply loves it.  I have now purchased all of Karen Katz's books.   You won't regret buying these for your babies!!
B000088E6M|4.0|overall pretty tight for a debut album, just what you would expect from 50 cent.  Some standout tracks are In Da Club, Heat, Patiently Waiting, back Down, and Poor lil rich.a lot of singin outta 50 and its tite. buy this 4sho if u like dre production, some tight ... beats(Heat, poor lil rich, in da club) dre and em are the best producers on it, but only a couple are produced by eminem(dont push me, patiently waiting) a few by dre.  overall 8\10.
0201485672|5.0|This book is a classic, it changes the way you think about programming.<br />If you are two or three years into your programming career, you have probably had the urge to take a project and redesign it from scratch. You may have said to yourself &quot;if only I had known about x methodology or y framework, this code could have been a lot cleaner.&quot; Sometimes these experiences can amplify a programmer's inhibitions. An inhibited programmer is often a less productive one.<br />Refactoring eases a programmer's inhibitions in two ways. First, it shows why there is no need to create a PERFECT design up front. If better ideas emerge later, they can be integrated safely and securely. Second, the book provides methods for changing existing code using step-by-step &quot;recipes&quot; for dozens of refactoring scenarios. These recipes guide you through the tasks in such a manner that all possible holes exposed along the way are protected. <br />Another small gem of this book is a guide for identifying &quot;code smells&quot;. Code smells are pieces of code that compile, test and run correctly but nonetheless look bad or ugly. The section on code smells help you pinpoint what is ugly about it. As they say, &quot;a well-stated problem is a half solved one&quot;.<br />After reading this book you will finally understand the XP edict &quot;Refactor early and often&quot;.
B000088E6M|5.0|This album is a must buy 50 is the bomb....its 16 tracks of thugged out street realism....50 is whats HOT!
B000002UE9|5.0|This was my first Poison CD and I have to say, it is possibly their best.  It is a great CD for in the car and just belting out on the hard rock and the beautiful ballads.<br />Love On The Rocks:  one of my favourite songs, an awesome start off sound<BR>Nothin' But A Good Time:  everyone knows it, the best way to get a party started<BR>Back To The Rocking Horse:  a good song with amazing vocals by Michaels, an overall awesome tune<BR>Good Love:  a decent track, not one of my favs but still above average<BR>Tearin' Down The Walls:  I love this track, 'screaming, scratching' just a nice track to sing along to!<BR>Look But You Can't Touch:  a nice rock song, fans of 80s metal bands will love this song<BR>Fallen Angel:  obviously, one of their biggest hits - everyone knows it, it doesn't get old!<BR>Every Rose Has Its Thorn:  a sweet ballad that everyone loves<BR>Your Mama Don't Dance:  a remake, very good song to &quot;bop&quot; around to<BR>Bad To Be Good:  my favourite track on the album, an all around great song with great instruments.<br />(Bret) Michaels shows off his vocal talent throughout this album, C.C. Deville is possibly one of the best guitarist known to man, Dall is jamming and Rikki Rockett is simply amazing on the drums.  I think Poison definitely had it going for them with this amazing album.  I recommend it to anyone.
B000068FY0|3.0|a little too cerebral for someone new to Supertramp like myself
B000088E6M|5.0|first off let me start off by saying big ups to em for putting 50 on shady records.he juss made his record company even bigger than before. Wangsta was too dope to be played out, its still new to me.for the album i admit i heard people w/ ths album before it came out, but i wanted to get real copy so i waited two weeks. when i put the album on my cd player i just couldnt skip a track, every track on this album is sick.is even better than nas's gods son, and nas is dope 2.
B000084T18|4.0|...i just finished listening to this album and every single track is a standout!The whole album is a masterpeice.50 cent has outdone himself on the record amd \\"maybe\\" just maybe it had something to do with Eminem and Shady Records..Eminem once said that 50 was one of his favourite rappers and with Em's production skillz he has put 50 on the road to commercial success, which some people might not like (including me).But anywayz this album has to get at least 4 mic's in the source and if it doesn't i swear never to buy another copy.....Classic album but let's hope shady records doesn't end up being a kiss of death...
0316666343|5.0|alice sebold's novel, \\"the lovely bones\\", was terrific!  it grabs you from the very first paragraph.  what genius to write a story from the perspective of a dead person whose life is cut painfully short by murder.  it was sad and uplifting at the same time.  wouldn't it be a comfort when we die to see those we love remember us with joy and be able to watch them as they continue to live their lives and be happy?!<br />a definite must read!!!
0316096199|5.0|I read a lot & it is seldom I come across a novel I enjoy as much as I enjoyed \\"Lucky: A Memoir\\" by Alice Sebold. I came across moments in my memory where I confused this novel with my own life. I feel as if I have experienced it, in a way.  Everyone hears of rape, this made it seem real, instead of something that only happens to other people. Overall, I feel the novel was wonderful, truly captivating, I didn't want to stop reading it. It is great to go through the brave character's journey of the rape, trial & healing process. It was written so beautifully and I find it to be an amazing contribitution to literature. I think 'Lucky\\" deserves all of its 5 stars and I applaud Ms. Sebold for her outstanding work.
020530902X|5.0|This is NOT a grammar, it's about style.  You won't find ANY inane lifeless nonsense rules like \\"don't split infinitives\\" (a red herring itself).  That said, I suppose another flattering review is superfluous -- Strunk would disapprove -- but this book's rating is a half star below five!  I have been writing in one capacity or another my entire life and cannot think of a single volume as fundamentally influential as Strunk.  I have had a copy since high school, though I couldn't tell you where it is now; not that it matters, I've committed it to heart. By providing the table of contents, Amazon[.com] has essentially given you the book save its illustrative examples -- that's how tight it is, and yes the examples are worth having.  Perhaps the somewhat militant author could have slipped \\"please\\" in here or there, but that would violate rule 13, \\"Omit needless words.\\"  Strunk doesn't want you to write better to please him, he saying if you're serious about your work you'll allow your assumptions to be challenged; and if you look closely you will recognize a compassion between the words, a committment to teach not browbeat.  This book is nearly a century old and will be relevant in a century more, barring some sort of natural calamity, nuclear war, or extraterrestrial invasion.  If you like, preview an old edition in the public domain at Bartleby.
B000001FNL|5.0|Main Course was a gamble. But it paid off. So much so, that it is likely the best studio album from the Bee Gees. It reflects the amount of time they spent updating their sound to the styles of pop music at that time without sounding like a copy. Better than that, everyone wanted to copy them! It is also the seminal album of their 1970's career. Nearly all their work that followed up to 1981 originates with these compositions.<br />This album contains significant musical advancements in the career of the Bee Gees in 1975. There's a new kind of beat and rhythm by the group, more of a funky, driving kind of beat, not quite disco (Jive Talkin', Nights On Broadway, Winds Of Change). This style would advance onto the next album, as would the updated pop-ballad sounds (Fanny, Baby As You Turn Away, Edge Of The Universe). Less emphasized but not forgotten are the traditional Bee Gees-type ballads, and country-and-western (Songbird, Country Lanes, Come On Over). The 'silly song' tunes would be dropped after this album (All This Making Love).   <br />Barry, Robin, and Maurice Gibb, the Bee Gees, were looking for a new direction after 1972. While they had some big sellers in the U.S. in 1970-71 (Lonely Days, How Can You Mend A Broken Heart), their U.K. success at that time was minimal. It seemed that the sounds of pop music were changing, leaving them behind. But what kind of sound could they capture that would put them back on again? It wasn't readily apparent: they made another two albums between 1972 and 1974 before Main Course. During that whole time, they tried different styles and musical approaches. This redesigning culminated in Main Course, released in Spring, 1975.<br />Absolutely recommended -- and it's at a good price!
B00006CXSS|1.0|I have never looked more forward to owning a DVD and I am giving this a horrible rating because of one thing.  - It's lack of English subtitles.      I watched every edition of this when on HBO and the encore as well, all the while having close-captioning on to aid me in the dialog when battle scenes got intense.      I was utterly dismayed after I bought the DVD that no built in english subtitles are available.    I really wonder who's snafu this was and what they say to the veterans seniors of this country that might want to watch it, but can't follow things well because of there hearing.   My grandpa for one fits this bill.    Great Series...  Scrap that...  Phenomenal Series!   -Yet no CC!  ...      nuff said
B000088E6M|5.0|This is single handedly the biggest and best drop of the season as of yet, no doubt.  I usually burn my cd's, but I went out and bought this cd first day it came out.  After listening and analyzing all 19 tracks, I can say that every one is worth listening too.  My personal favorties are tracks 3,4,5,7,10,11,15.  Wanksta (Track 17) is also included on the cd. 50's flows and beats right now are untouchable, and I see it stayin that way.
B00003CXXM|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a refreshing change is the Spy movies that are out now, why? Here is the reason, frist this movie dose not involve high tech devices, that can do almost anything and everything that a person can think of, a story plot that isn't over the top, and action schenes that don't require the used of skills rather than techonology. The best part of the movie is the car chase in which Matt didn't need to used of missles and machine guns. <br />If you sick of seeing spys movies that used high tech devices and plots that involved world domnation, go and watch this one.
B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent is the best new rapper of 2003!! Shady Records really put together a great album. If you enjoy any type of gangsta rap you must buy this album. Sounds great in a car with subs, most of the songs hit pretty hard. Overall this album is just the .... Fa Sho...
B000084T18|5.0|I think that 50 cents newest cd get rich or die tryin is great. He is the hottest thing on the street right now.  Everyone is bumppin 50.  Get rich or die tryin got alot of cameos and it sounds great its better than Ja Rule!! haha
B000088E6M|5.0|5 mics.This is what the rap world needs right now a real cat spittin real ish.
B00006RCOB|3.0|Back in the 1980s, Americans couldn't care less about bearded Islamic militants in the backwoods of Afghanistan.  Our big concern was the big, bad Soviet Union.  Even though we were the most powerful country in the world by a large margin, we feared war and invasion (World War III, Red Dawn, Amerika), espionage (virtually every Bond film from the period), and annhiliation (The Day After, WarGames) at the hands of the U.S.S.R.<br />Firefox fits neatly into this us-versus-them thriller, with iconic American loner/tough-guy hero Clint Eastwood penetrating into the Soviet Union to steal the world's most advanced aircraft, which was invisible to radar and America's defenses.  The movie had the potential to be a spectacular spy/action thriller, but the results are something of a mixed bag.<br />When I watched this film as a child, I was impressed by the seeming omnipresence of the KGB.  It was creepy to think that people lived in a society where no one trusted anyone and any loose words could mean certain death.  In retrospect, the portrayal of the KGB is somewhat cartoonish.  Perhaps most laughable was when Eastwood was asked for \\"your papers, please\\" while taking a shower.<br />Another aspect of the film that seems somewhat dated is the highly propogandistic way in which the dissidents were portrayed.  Several of Eastwood's helpers in the Soviet Union risked death by transporting him or giving him secret information, yet they seemed flippant, almost casual about their impending doom, as if being found out and killed by the KGB was just a normal, expected part of the plans.  \\"Oh, don't worry about me,\\" they would say in a dismissive tone, explaining that without the freedoms that Eastwood took for granted back in the West, life just wasn't worth living.  While history is full of people giving their lives for freedom, the shallow way in which these characters faced their fates could be chalked up to either poor scriptwriting, shallow Cold War propaganda, or a bit of both.<br />A couple other criticisms.  The dialogue is rather flat and the storyline is somewhat predictable.  Eastwood's character remains elusive (one-dimensional?) and stoic (wooden?) throughout the movie.  I don't want to criticize the special effects for the flying scenes, though, because they were considered top-notch at the time.  Publicity made much of the Star Wars legacy of some of the special effects personnel.<br />In the end, what we have is something of a cartoonish spy-thriller that entrances starry-eyed children into the epic struggle between East and West, but feels more like a Cold War cops-and-robbers flick for more mature audiences.
0783226063|5.0|I watched the movie at the theaters when I was barely 14, it still amazes me how inspired was David Lynch when he commited to this film project.  I have read the book many times, and the first time it only took me one day to finish it, I just couldn't put it down!!  I have also seen the Dune TV Series, which left me with mixed feelings. Lynch's film succeeded absolutely in portraying us the rise of the messiah, the awakening of the sleeper, the chosen one, something that even the book did not accomplish. The quality of the film and the special effects are great by 80's standard, but today it may seem a little outdated.  The casting was great, every leading role was portrayed perfectly, Duke Leto, Gurney Halleck, the Baron, the emperor, Paul's mother Sarah, chani (played by Sean Young), unlike the TV Series, here you see a Paul Atreides that changes into the man he is destined to be and more (played by Kyle McLachlan), his sister Lia who shows her extraordinary powers in such an excellent way that is it almost disturbing watching her.  Also the music score is of such an excellent quality (played by Toto) that can be compared to the best music scores ever written for a movie.<br />Lynch's film version of Dune is not as close to the book as the TV Series, but then, how could it possibly be in a 2,5 hour film, this is as close as it can get, and again, being close to what it is written in the book doesn't guarantee an innovative and inspiring vision, take for instance the TV Series, which is very close to the book and the political intrigues that were depicted in the book, but at the same time so far away to the spirit of the book that one can sense after reading it.<br />There is an scene that I completely love and that is when Paul goes to the desert to drink the water of life in order to become something more or perish in the attempt, the worms then appear and seem to be feeling Paul's journey, as well as the Bene Gesserit witches. Paul then understands the role of the spice and his role among the Fremen and then awakens to his true power.  There is so much mysticism in this scene that you could almost relate the Sufi's tradition of the awakening of men.  What we have here is an scene that was completely made up and had nothing to do what it is written in the book, but adds so much to the rising mysticism that you start feeling from the half of the movie and into the end.<br />To my opinion both versions of the Book (Lynch's movie and Harrison TV Series) were a good effort, and they are worth watching.  What happened to me was that I saw the TV Series and never watched it again, didn't want to, better off reading the book again, but I still enjoy watching Lynch's Dune.<br />For the uninformed: this is a movie that it is hard to watch, you will have to see it a couple of times in order to understand it, and then a couple more times to really enjoy it.  But then if you really sense the spirit behind it you will always be coming back for more.  For me this is a definitive must-buy, a movie that you have to keep in your personal collection of the best all time movies!!!  Enjoy!!!
6304806442|4.0|This film is pandemonium. Disorder, Confusion, Turmoil, and Discord could very well be considered the supporting cast. The plot is a complete frenzy. Amongst all the craziness is the interest that you will find most enjoyable. This movie will make you laugh, it will make you gasp, and it will make you imagine yourself in the main character's shoes. The foundation of this film is a struggle between adolescence and adulthood. This film will be most enjoyed by those who find themselves fighting the same struggle. It will be most understood by those who realize that they are leaving the teenage years and need to find they place in society as an adult. Whether you completely understand or not, this film is still fun. You may not get the most enjoyment out of it if you don't truly understand it, but it is entertaining to watch nonetheless. I rate this film four out of five stars.
B000088E6M|4.0|After classic material since 1999 from underground talent 50 Cent, this album is completely dissapointing. However, it does have its good points. Heres a breakdown of categories for each track on 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'':<br />[Lyrically/Production Wise/Replay Value] Best Songs:<BR>2. What Up Gangsta<BR>3. Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem)<BR>4. Many Men (Wish Death)<BR>5. In Da Club<BR>8. If I Can't<BR> 9. Blood Hound (feat. Young Buck of G Unit)<BR>10. Back Down<BR> 13. Poor Lil Rich<BR>15. Don't Push Me (feat. Lloyd Banks of G Unit & Eminem)<br />[Lyrically/Mostly Production Wise] - Average Songs:<BR>6. High All the Time<BR>7. Heat<BR>12. Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit)<br />[Lyrically/Production Wise/Replay Value] - Worst/Whack Songs:<BR>11. P.I.M.P.<BR>14. 21 Questions (feat. Nate Dogg)<BR>16. Gotta Make It to Heaven<br />Production wise, this album is even more of a let down. Respected productionists create majorly less-than-perfect beats that are/seem extremely out of place for 50 Cent. Dirty south production on a new york record = uncomfortable feeling to tracks and album. <br />50 has even said himself that he had no creative control with the album which....well, [is bad]since the guy has/can make classic hip hop. I just hope that in the future he will brake away from Dre and Em more and go back to his older, more real hip-hop based lyricism and beats. 4 Mics....
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is truly one of a kind. This is one of the only movies that I strictly disagree with Roger Ebert on. He gave this film a low rating. I on the other hand praise this film and give it five stars. This film is great in several ways. The cinematography was exceptional, the cunning allusions to real events were amusing, and the originality and intelligence of letting a character giving a voice-over converse with another character simultaneously was genius. This movie is truly and completely absolutely eccentric. I gladly give five stars for this film.
6304076517|5.0|If youve never done acid but plan on doing it in the the future, DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE WHILE TRIPPING!!  Honestly, you dont really dont have to do acid just watch this movie and youll practically get th esame effect, just without the permanent effects and trip flashbacks.  Other than that though its a great movie, I didnt really listent to the dialogue as much as I just watched everyting happen.  The red guy that dances is really crazy.  In conclusion, if your a fan of acid and surreal stuff then you should see this movie.
B00002MZ2T|2.0|Actually... The lyrics and songwriting here aren't bad. They aren't bad at all.<br />Fact remains I don't think his voice is soulful enough to lift this music up to appropriate heights. He sings &quot;correctly&quot;. It's musically &quot;right&quot;. He's not off-key. It's just... flat. You want my standard for empathic and soulful singing: listen to Otis Redding's &quot;These arms of mine&quot; and then listen to this. You'll see what I mean by &quot;flat&quot;.<br />Also I hear: drumcomputers, synths and I suspect even the guitar sounds that pop up here and there come from a keyboard. Where are the instruments?<br />Put these songs into the hands of a better vocalist and add a real band (not a band in a box) and you'll come up with a much better album.
0440234743|2.0|Finally Grisham writes a novel that is based elsewhere, in this case Washington and Brasil. The storyline is interesting - excentric spiteful billionaire wanting revenge one last time on his ungrateful children and ex-wives. However, there is a lack of tension in this story, which seems to end a little too easily and with apparently no conflict. The winning side in this case is clear right from the start. The story has some interesting elements to it, but I found it overall disappointing in the end.
B000088E6M|4.0|Man where do I start.  I really like this album. I'm not going to compare it to Em or dre but they really bought his talent out.  I just like 50's style.  The I dont give a [hoot] attitude really works.  The beats are great.  If you cruse and bump in your ride, this is a must.  Its and instant classic.<BR>  I like track three, Patiently Waiting (feat. Eminem), I like the smooth beat and Em's I don't care lyrics.  In da club been played allot, but I really like it.  Personally I don't like Ja, so I'm all bout 50.  Check track 19 out it's a great diss.  This cd also features cuts from Nate Dogg and 50 own gang G-unit.<BR>  If you like to hear a good diss on murder inc, Em, I don't give a [hoot] lyrics and smooth beats defiantly check it out.
B000088E6M|5.0|There comes a time in hip hop when you just know(from first listen) that a certain artist will bring something unique to the game. As a teenager growing up in the 90's Tupac and Biggie were those cats who just gave you this feeling whenever they spit their street poetry to the masses...Chills came over your body whenever you heard their songs on the radio. 50 Cent has that gift...He has the ability to make the listener see themselves through the music. Now I gave this album 5 stars not because the album is flawless but because I could see where 50 wants to take the music...For instance: P.I.M.P in my opinion is not a great song but it is good song and the bonus tracks were old. However, the album had me \\"stuck\\" in my wooden chair waiting to hear what 50 was going to say. That is a sign of a great album because I got the same feeling when I first heard REASONABLE DOUBT BY jay-z, Stillmatic by nas and Blueprint by jay-z...Yo buy this album...and the DVD is filled with some phat features....
0792838068|1.0|As I said in my review for &quot;Blue Steel&quot;; getting a well known actor/actress to star in a movie does not gaurantee a great motion picture. The only reason I watched this movie was becuause it was late at night and there was nothing else on television. However, I couldn't believe how dull and depressing it was. Well, actually I can believe it after watching it based on the plot itself. But as I said earlier the two words to describe Leaving Las Vegas are DULL and DEPRESSING. I only give this movie one star because Elizabeth Shue is a babe.
0028643151|5.0|This is the first real pager-turner ever written in the genre of non-fiction, science-based books.  Mr. Moran lays out ten exciting scenarios that could one day lead to the extinction of humankind: Weapons of Mass Destruction, Asteroid Impacts with Earth, Massive Volcanic Eruptions, The Greenhouse Effect, The Coming Ice Age, Mega-Tsunamis, Plagues, Cyberterrorism, Insect Invasions, and Bioengineering Blunders.   <br />One of Mr. Moran's predictions has already been proven possible; in the \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" chapter, he discusses the possibility that other countries may, in the very near future, use chemical, biological and/or other WMD against the United States.  With a potential war on the horizon, this possibility has become a glaring threat we may have to face in months, or even weeks.  <br />I found DOOMSDAY to be extremely well researched.  Mr. Moran knows his stuff, and he explained terms and concepts a hundred times better than even my favorite college professors.  I recommend DOOMSDAY to all interested in learning more about the dangers we may face both today, and in the future.  Just because there is a very slim chance that an event should take place, does not mean it still does not pose a violent, and horrifying threat to all of humankind.
B00007GZQI|1.0|I think I first saw &quot;Magic Christian&quot; in the early 70s. I thought it was philosophically interesting, funny and fun. I watched it last week and kept waiting for the good parts. Even the good parts I remembered weren't as good as I remembered them, and the slothly pacing made me restless as a kid in church. I watched the first hour then ejected the disk. There are better things to do.
B00006RCNW|5.0|I love this show! I first got into it after reading some of the reviews posted here on these Season One dvds, so I thought I would give it a try and I purchased this complete season. I am truly glad that I did. I was hooked from the first episode to the last and I am now watching Season 2 on FX. What makes this show far better than all the other cop shows is that the production value is more in line with HBO or a movie than a cable television show. The acting is extremely good as are the scripts and dialogue. Even though Vic and his team are labeled \\"dirty\\" cops you can't help but root for them in the end. Michael Chiklis deserved his Golden Globe award for best actor, he takes on this role as if Vic Mackey was himself in a former life. I was also glad this show won the award for best drama series on TV. If you haven't seen the show yet and are unsure if you would like it, give it a try. It's a bit brutal and graphic, but by the time you finish the final episode, \\"Circles,\\" you will be speechless, praying to catch repeats of Season 2.
B000088E6M|5.0|The ne 50 cent cd is by fa one o fthe best new rap albums I have ever heard.  This is a must have cd for any rap fan.
B00000ING2|5.0|It is one of those movies that you don't mind watching again...and again....and again....and again... An odd gem that just sticks with you, and becomes a classic on you shelf.<BR>It has all the detail and quirks of the classic movies from an ere long gone by, yet is in the comedic beat of today. The humor is like every other coen brother movie, with the same mix of wit and physical humor that is their trademark. You almost feel embarrassed for Norville Barnes, and at the same time, can snicker at his predicaments. (Anyone else notice that when he dreams, he doesn't think women have bellybuttons?) It's odd little details like that that really are over the top.<BR>All the details point to what it does best -- poke fun at a bygone era -- the '50's. Anything like that is worth a looksee.<BR> The only regret for me is that there isn't any extra features about this movie. I would really like to know what the actors and the director thought of this movie in retrospect. Or at least know what went into cooking up such an experience as this.
B00005JKZT|4.0|I think I have read the books at least 7 times over 15 years, and I really enjoy them.  The movies have both been cinematic triumphs, extraordinarily impressive.  I am, however, one of those people having difficulty with the changes Jackson is making, and they have a theme.  He is taking the heros of the story and giving them flaws to make them seem more human.  This is a fantasy!  The heros are not supposed to have these flaws.  Gandalf never told Sauramon about the ring, he knew better.  And Sauromon was never obviously in league with Sauron, he was seeking the ring for himself.  Aragorn never inteacted with Frodo as he was leaving the Fellowship, much less hinted at taking the ring from him.  And Farimir was almost instantly aware that the ring was not something he wanted to posess, but helped Frodo & Sam get back to their journey with as much speed and help as he could offer.<BR>I have minor issue with the change of Glorfindel to Arwen in the first movie, and actrually appreciate Jackson trying to incorporate some of the scenes in teh Appendix into the story to exaplain the history between Aragorn & Arwen.  But the scene he inserted about Aragorn being afraid to take up the Kingship. Please!  And the scene with Arwen leaving for the Havens, fabrication.  Once she made the commitment to Aragorn, never in the books was there a suggestion that she waivered.  The change in the reaction of Treebeard to the information provided to him in the meeting with Merry & Pippin is another (minor) irritation.  The Ents were already distressed about the unnecessary hewing of trees by the Orcs, and the story of the treachery of Sauramon pushed him over the edge.  Not the other way around.  Granted, most of these are in the first movie.  And I realize that these are all very human reactions that Jackson has created, but they are not in keeping with the construct of the original books or with the concept of fantasy.  For those who have never read the books, or do not remember them,it is a wonderful movie.  For those who love the story, it can be a bit hard to see it changed.
B000002JSN|3.0|Com Se Come sa would be the best way to describe this Led Zeppelin CD.  The drumming as usual is strong and Jimmy Page has some nice guitar runs.  However, Robert Plant's voice and the length of some of these songs just try my patience.  In My Time Of Dying bleeds for over eleven minutes of grunting and screaming guitars.  The tone varies a little at the beginning which is somewhat creative.  However, this song should be about five or six minutes at best.  Kashmir is another song that at eight and a half minutes really is annoying as well.  Just don't like Plant's tone at all with the ooh yeah hee yeah's here as well as as his caterwailing on the more tolerable Trampled Under Foot.<br />High Points on this recording include Houses of The Holy, Down By The Seaside, Night Flight, and The Wanton Song.  Great riffs on that last tune and some good variations in the melody as well.  Night Flight features some cool drumming by Bonham.<br />Boogie With Stu and Black Country Woman are decent numbers but not first rate material.  The music is cool but the lyrics are kind of pedestrian. At least these songs add a little variety to this disc.<br />Throw in the cool cover design and I'll round up this recording to three stars.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|To oversimplify the film, Donnie Darko is about a boy who may have paranoid schizophrenia who is saved from being crushed by an airplane engine which crashes into his bedroom by an imaginary friend that resembles a guy in a demon bunny costume. This new \\"friend\\" begins manipulating his actions which creates a chain reaction inevitably leading to the end events. Throughout the film Donnie finds himself confronting such issues as predestination vs free will and the existence of God. The story takes place in the late 1980s, apparently so the viewer will have some expectation of what won't happen in Donnie's future.<br />The time travel plot provides moments of interest, but is ultimately weak and pointless.  I cannot give a full critique without spoiling the ending, but this storyline completely contradicts the point the film is trying to make (see below for more details). However, where the film excels is as a character study of Donnie himself and his interactions with several other interesting characters. Some of the other characters are a bit one dimensional, but that is the point. Such shallow people do exist in real life and never look at the world with the amount of depth or imagination that Donnie does, and seeing the two extremes come into conflict is priceless. This is one of the funniest satires of suburban life I have seen since American Beauty.<br />If Richard Kelly were more confident to stick to straightforward storytelling and directing (the shifts in camera speed for example are just annoying and campy) and left out the superficial gloss and unnecessary time travel storyline, this film would be a true masterpiece. He does appear to have the potential to create surreal masterpieces like David Lynch, but he first has to figure out how how to avoid completely contradicting himself. It will be interesting to see which way he goes in the future; if he'll make the next American Beauty or the next Mulholland Dr. Maybe he'll surprise us and make a more successfull hybrid.<br />SPOILER: The film is supposed to divine intervention leading to Donnie's self-sacrifice. However, the tragedies at the end of the film are solely caused by this intervention.  For example, Donnie would not have flooded the school or burnt down the kiddie porn house or visited Grandma Death's house without the encouragement of the bunny, so his mother would not be on the plane, his teacher wouldn't have been fired, his girlfriend would not have been killed,  nor would the guy in the bunny suit have even died if not for his own intervention!  So the whole film lacks even any internal logic (something essential to any surreal film), Donnie's \\"self-sacrifice\\" is just plain stupidity, and the emotional impact of most of the events in the film is completely undermined.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This film is one of my favorites. It has a genuinely original plot, a superb cast, a non-cliched script, and great humor. This movie works on several levels. On the surface, it is a light-hearted comedy, and stands up extremely well to the best comedies ever made. However, it has much deeper meanings as well. (Warning- Spoilers to follow. If you have not seen the movie, I suggest that you stop reading and experience it for yourself.) <br />When Phil first gets stuck in the existential glitch, after some confusion, he takes advantage of it by eating obscene amounts of junkfood, getting into legal trouble, picking up women, and general self-indulgence, knowing that the next day, everyone will have forgotten about the day's events. Phil grows weary of it eventually, and tries to get Rita, Phil's producer, to love him. However, he goes about love by trying to bend the world around him to fit his needs, and it does not work, as Rita rejects him several times. Phil realizes the utter futility of his approach to life, and kills himself, several times, only to wake up to February 2nd, Groundhog Day. <br />When Phil finally convinces Rita of the truth of his experience, that is his turning point. Rita tells Phil that it could be a tremendous curse or a blessing, depending on how he looks at it. He spends the day(s) helping others and improving his life. Phil is not delivered from his crisis until he lives the day exactly the way he needs to. Rita finally falls in love with Phil, it is through Phil's qualities which are now genuinely his, and not an artificial part of his experience.<br />We never find out exactly how Phil got stuck in the same day, or why. And that is one of the best things about the movie. Any attempt at a detailed answer would almost certainly leave more questions than answers, and would distract from the themes of the film.<br />In short, this is a highly recommended film, and one of the few that I can watch again and again and never get tired of. *****

B000003TAB|5.0|This was sort of a make-money-fast album after the monumental success of Nirvana's first major record, Nevermind. However, because it was labled a collectors-only record from the get-go, it didn't sell too well and got absolutley no credit for anything, and it is likely that In Utero's sales (the &quot;real&quot; follow-up to Nevermind) suffered because of this. If you take the time to listen to this record that is stuffed to the top with Nirvana, you'll find that it really is the most underrated album of the 90's. Songs like &quot;Been a Son&quot;, &quot;Sliver&quot;, and the briliant Vaselines cover &quot;Molly's Lips&quot; give a lighter, more loveable teenage anguish feel to the LP. On the other hand, &quot;Hairspray Queen&quot; and &quot;Mexican Seafood&quot; restore the Nirvana that everyone knows and loves, loud, direct, real. However, without question, the best song on the album is &quot;Aneurysm&quot;. It's raw, outright feel captures every aspect of Nirvana, while giving off a patented Kurt Cobain glow. <BR>If you are a Nirvana fan or just a grunge fan looking to remind you of the greatest years in music since the british Invasion, buy this album. R.I.P. Kurt Cobain.
B000084T18|5.0|I gave 50 Cent five stars for this joint.  There ain't one track on this album that I did not like.  50 Cent came wit it for sho!  I usually pick favorites as far as tracks on new albums, but there all bangin'.  I ain't heard nothin' like this for a minute!  This cd is a must have.
B00007H1Y2|4.0|If you are a fan of Cooder's Buena Vista Social Club you will also want Mambo Sinuendo. Billed as &quot;Cuban soul and high-performance twang,&quot; this album explores the roots of Cuban music and its influence on American pop music, especially in the '50s, '60s. Cooder and Galb&aacute;n play guitars accompanied by a Cuban rhythm section of two drum kits, congas, and bass, evoking memories of Duane Eddy and Henry Mancini. The two guitar masters are familiar and comfortable with each other and they shift between traditional and experimental music with ease.  Mambo Sinuendo moves effortlessly from the graceful &quot;Dru Me Negrita&quot; to the perky &quot;Monte A Dentro&quot; to the complex rhythms of &quot;Echale Salsita.\\" Throughout, the melodies and rhythms are fresh but familiar, reminiscent of so much you have heard in classic American pop music. It's a very accessible album that easily enters you and makes you bounce if not dance.<br />If this sounds like a lot of fun, it is. It is obvious the musicians are having fun, putting their hearts into the music.  While not a truly great album, it is solid, and will add pleasure to your life.
B000088E6M|4.0|Whoa! an album that lived up to its hype, 50 is tha future fareal, this entire album is hot from front to back it has every aspect of a good hood banga from street joints (what up gangsta), to comercial club bangas (In da club) it even has a joint fa da ladies (21 questions). Lyrically 50 isn't that impressive but his delivery is intoxicating that southern drawl of his makes for very catchy hooks and drops and his flow is solid he's like a mix of 2pac and mase with that vicious but lazy way he spits his rhymes. the production on the album is off the charts Eminem (patiently waiting) and dre (heat) did most of the beats on the album but 50 does have a couple other producers on the album. guest appearences are hot aswell Eminem (don't push me), Nate dogg (21 questions) and GGGGGG G-unit (like my style ect) accompanies 50 cent on the album to add more heat to the package. What can I say? I like this album and don't get it twisted i'm a real hip-hop head not just some guy who watches mtv and trl and I say go buy this [stuff] it's a banga.

B000003TA4|5.0|The Pioneers of grunge are at work here with a timeless record that will forever hold a place in music history. Much more so than Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\", Nevermind has influenced all kinds of music from bands like the Smashing Pumpkins to Greenday, while producing the most original and influential energy since Jimi Hendrix. This trio from Aberdeen, WA was on the verge of something that nobody had accomplished since the Beatles, and Kurt's untimely death decelerated grunges popularity after albums like Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness died down. These are the masters of an art lead by the greatest songwriter of our time. R.I.P. Kurt Cobain. <BR>                               Track Analysis<BR>1)Smells Like Teen Spirit: 10/10<BR>This is the anthem of the 90's, the song that started it all for Nirvana and grunge. A power lick that never gets old, not to mention great lyrics.<BR>2)In Bloom: 9/10<BR>Great ideas behind this one but I have to admitt it does get a bit old after you've listened to it over and over and over...<BR>3)Come as You are: 10/10<BR>A feel like nothing else Nirvana ever did. Sort of a sad happy combo with Kurt Cobain patented lyrics. Amazing.<BR>4)Breed: 9/10<BR>Extreme riff that is stronger than anything else on the record. Also can get a bit old, but great all the same.<BR>5)Lithium: 15/10<BR>The greatest song on the face of the Earth. Exceeds all, with the best lyrics ever written. The experience of listening to this song is inexplicable, it reaches to places nothing ever has and nothing ever will. \\"I'm so happy, cause today I've found my friends, they're in my head...\\"<BR>6)Polly: 10/10<BR>Their first of two antirape songs, a beautiful and horrifying acoustic riff that is more powerful than any of the screaming  guitar riffs and 2nd on the album.<BR>7)Territorial Pissings: 9/10<BR>\\"Just because you're paranoid...\\" Need I say more?<BR>8)Drain you: 10/10<BR>Brilliance in a Kurt Cobain form. A solid song that represents this album very well, powerful, gross, Nirvana.<br />9)Lounge Act: 10/10<BR>Very underrated in it's field, could have been a classic for any other band. This record is so packed full of the best music on the planet we don't stop and appreciate songs like this one. <BR>10)Stay away: 10/10<BR>Ditto<BR>11)On a Plain: 9.5/10<BR>A different feel but still very Nirvana. This is the kind of song that you would expect if Nirvana slowed down a bit.<BR>12)Something in the Way: 10/10<BR>Inexplicably powerful, even more than Polly. Something you have to experience to understand. The best possible end to one of the best possible albums.<br />Go buy this to understand the world around more. It changes everything.
B000088E6M|4.0|Hip hop hasn't had a major label debut album that has been as anticipated as Get Rich or Die Tryin' since Can-I-Bus.  And considering the astronomical flop that Can-I-Bus was, 50 Cent's task seems all the more daunting.  However, where Canibus failed 50 succeeds.  <br />With the exception of a couple songs, 50 does not stray away from the style that has made him the star of the underground for the past few years.  In fact, this album may scare away some of the younger crowd that is expecting more light hearted hip hop like Wanksta and In Da Club.  Simply put, this is an extremely dark album, which is part of the reason why it's not a 5 star album.  It gets a bit redundant at times. Rarely does a hip hop album have a shortage of guest appearances, but this is an exception.  50 is by far the best out of his G-Unit crew, but a concept song with another New York City rapper couldn't hurt.<br />With the bad out of the way, there are some excellent songs on this album.  On the album's highlight, Patiently Waiting, 50 comes with typical street talk and then gives way to Eminem who completely destroys this song.  One of the best verses Marshall has ever hit us with.  What Up Gangsta, Many Men, If I Can't, and P.I.M.P. are also standout tracks.  For a good laugh, turn on Back Down.  50 completely embarasses hip hop's biggest tool, Ja Rule with his verses and then does an impression of the gay stripper that Ja allegedly had an experience with.  Masterful.<br />All in all, Get Rich or Die Tryin' somehow finds a way to go above the massive hype that surrounded it's release.  If you can get past the very dark subject matter, you will love this CD.
0393317552|5.0|This book is the most captivating book on science and discovery that I have ever read. For those willing to approach it with an open mind, it can change the way you see race, history, and destiny. I can't recommend this more highly. The story begins with the author being asked a simple question and spirals into a thought-provoking and ground-breaking view of world history. Why do some peoples and nations have all the wealth? All the food? Why have other societies been shackled with poverty? Why have some societies seemed to have been given the short end of the stick by fate? Could it be race? Or is it something a bit simpler, something most of us would fail to ever consider? It is wonderful to read a book and feel your world view changing in the process.
B000059T5O|4.0|If you're familiar with both John Hammond and Tom Waits, you've probably guessed (correctly) that this album was not going to contain the average coverage of Waits' song catalogue. It's the bizarro bluesy side of Tommy the Cat that gets covered here, as opposed to Waits the jazzbo or Waits the down-and-out saloon crooner. Hammond and band give a earthy kick to such Waits growlers as &quot;2:19,&quot; &quot;Get Behind The Mule&quot; and &quot;Buzz Fledderjohn.&quot; With Waits himself in the producer's chair (and adding guitar and, on one track, a harmony vocal), Hammond makes these sound as earthy as Howlin' Wolf (city) or Charley Patton (country), and gets you as psyched about his interpretations as, hopefully, you'd get about Wait's own versions. The only less-than-stellar track is &quot;Shore Leave,&quot; which doesn't cut it put side-by-side with Waits' version on his album, SWORDFISHTROMBONES. But that's a minor gripe with the rest of the album to consider. I hope Hammond will think about a sequel to this album, as there's lots of Waits in them thar hills just waiting for the right kind of venue. This album is a good start
B000003TAW|5.0|You might now be looking at me with the most awkward of looks, but yes I do think that this is the best overall album ever created. &quot;Why?&quot; you ask. The first thing is that there is not one song on this album that I would skip over, many of the critically acclaimed albums have a bum track or two, but the Blue Album does not. The music is good American Geek Rock-N-Roll, (I guess because I'm kind of a geek, that really boosts my opinion), with songs and hooks that are as catchy as clamidia. This album has almost been around for a decade, and unlike most music from the early 90s, it remains fresh, and probably has a fresh shelf life for another decade or so to come as well. Another fine point about the album is the flow of the album, it is practically indescribable, but one listen and you'll know what I mean. <br />Granted, it is only my opinion that this is the best album ever, and has a number of great songs, &quot;Only in Dreams&quot; tops the list. This is the one album I still have yet to tire of, and would be my pick if I were stranded on a deserted island with only 1 CD to have.

B000084T18|5.0|The long awaited Get Rich or Die Tryin' album from Shady/Aftermath's artist 50 cent, is here. First the \\"Intro\\", it starts off change dropping and a gun being cocked to show that 50 is coming. The second track, \\"What up Gangsta\\" is a smooth song that i liked a lot and shows how real he is when he says \\"What up cuz, what up blood\\" like he's use to that sorta of thing. The 3rd track, \\"Patiently Waiting ft. Eminem\\" is a bure car-banger with a good hook and Eminem at his best. I feel Eminem came through producing this track. The 4th, \\"Many Men\\", has an awesome beat with 50 talking about all the people that are hating on him. I really enjoyed this track after multiple listens. Of course the 5th track \\"In da club\\", i can't say much about, but you know it's power! The 6th track \\"High all the time\\" I really didn't like at first. It's basically 50 talking about smoking. After a while, it's ok. The 7th track, \\"Heat\\" is my favorite track on the album. This track has the whole package, a good beat, awesome chorus, and sweet ryhmes. After one listen, you wont be able to stop singing \\"I'll ride by and blow ya brains out\\". \\"If I can't\\" is also nice. It's 50 talking about simply that if he can't do it, know one else can. That he is simply THE BEST!The next track \\"Blood Hound (feat. Young Buck of G Unit)\\" is strictly gangsta rap and the same for the next track \\"Back Down\\" in which 50 disses Ja-Rule. The 11th track is one of the two tracks that i simple did not like. Maybe its because of who I am, and im not a pimp. The next track, \\"Like My Style (feat. Tony Yayo of G Unit)\\" is 50 speaking on his evryday life. Tony ya-yo rips it up. The 13th \\"Poor lil Rich\\" is the other track I didnt like because everything in it is just boring. \\"21 questions ft. Nate Dogg\\" has a good chorus for the ladies and the whole song is mostly about the ladies.The 15th, \\"Don't Push Me (feat. Lloyd Banks of G Unit & Eminem)\\" is a song you can listen to 100 times and still love it. The track is pure fire.\\"GottaMake It to Heaven\\" is a hip-hop classic. 3 bonus tracks including \\"Wanksta\\". This is simply a rap classic.

Hammond and band give a earthy kick to such Waits growlers as &quot;2:19,&quot; &quot;Get Behind The Mule&quot; and &quot;Buzz Fledderjohn.&quot; With Waits himself in the producer's chair (and adding guitar and, on one track, a harmony vocal), Hammond makes these sound as earthy as Howlin' Wolf (city) or Charley Patton (country), and gets you as psyched about his interpretations as, hopefully, you'd get about Wait's own versions. The only less-than-stellar track is &quot;Shore Leave,&quot; which doesn't cut it put side-by-side with Waits' version on his album, SWORDFISHTROMBONES. But that's a minor gripe with the rest of the album to consider. I hope Hammond will think about a sequel to this album, as there's lots of Waits in them thar hills just waiting for the right kind of venue. This album is a good start
B00003CXPJ|4.0|I love Ben Stiller and eagerly anticipated this movie after learning about it's premise.  However, I didn't see it in theatres because it received lukewarm reviews in the press and I had a friend who didn't rave about it.  I finally saw it on cable a few weeks ago and it was HILARIOUS.  I know a little bit about fashion and the industry so I could relate and laugh at so many of the jokes.  It's probably funny no matter what your knowledge of the fashion world is based on all of these positive reviews.  It seems like you'll either love it or hate it.  I think that makes it worth seeing on cable or renting.  I'm going to watch it again tonight on cable then I'm going to order the DVD.  I loved it, but it's certainly not for everyone.
B00005MP58|3.0|First of all, let me say that the 3 stars are not for the performance.  I also have the VHS set, which I would give 5 stars.<BR>The DVD version looks washed out.  If this is really &quot;remastered,&quot; they ought to unremaster it.  What is surprising is that the colors in the scenes shown in the &quot;featurette&quot; appear to be as rich as in the VHS version, but this is not the case in the body of the DVD.<BR>I bought the DVD to get to my favorite scenes more easily, but it appears that I will have to keep my VHS edition if I want to see them in good color.
B000088E6M|5.0|This CD is perfect.  Perfect production, prerfect lyrics, perfect vocals. BUY THIS NOW! All the songs are great. I can't think of one problem with this cd. I got it the day it came out cause I knew it would be great. and it was, get up and get this.
B000088E6M|5.0|There are no words that can explain what's going on in the world of Rap. 50cent is a true entertainer. His life story is incredible, Ozzie of the hood. He's the Mr.Hyde of the rap game, and there's no sign of Dr.Jekyll. Dr.jekyll disappeared, the will was written and its our duty to carry out his wishes. The Rap game belongs to 50. The album is an instant classic. Its not just the music, its his ability to say the things others don't dare to say. He's how most of us wish we can be, FEAR-LESS..50CENT A PRODUCT OF THE HOOD..G--G-G--G-UNIT.
B000088E6M|5.0|...<br />Well I've been listening to Hip Hop(my fav artists: 2pac, Em, and now 50 Cent) all my life, and this much potential is inevitable to blow up. I bought this CD the day it came out..and I WAS NOT DISSAPOINTED.<br />Trust me, you will love this CD. Starting w/ a quiet intro and proceeding to a Dre produced song \\"What up Gangsta\\". It introduces 50...and continues on to \\"Patiently Waiting,\\" which includes killer verses from Eminem.<br />Guest Appearances: Eminem, Lloyd Banks, Young Buck(G Unit), Tony Yayo.<br />Buy it and get blown away!
B000088E6M|5.0|I purchased this CD with very high expectations. After all, 50 has been ruling the mixtape circuit, released several bangin underground joints as well as the classic How to rob, has a dope flow, witty lines, crafty lyricism, and can write a deep song with a catchy hook as well as freestyle with the best of them. Now that Dre and Eminem are involved, I expected a very solid album, but I would have NEVER expected the absolute masterpiece that \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" truly is!<BR>    Each track on the CD is worthy of it's on review:<BR>WHAT UP GANGSTA: Tpyical into track. 50 showcases his gift for writing a catchy hook, and it's good to see him working with a dope underground producer like Reef, who laces 50 with a dope beat<br />PATIENTLY WAITING: The only reason 50 shouldn't release this as his next single is because he would run the risk of being upstaged by Eminem, who steals the show on this track both with an incredible verse ( \\"Shady records was 80 seconds away from the towers/those cowards messed with the wrong buildings, they meant to hit ours\\"), and a menacing sting/piano beat that just plods along. Not to be outdone, 50 also shines on the track with his tale of struggling to get on<br />MANY MEN: 50 telling of haters who want to bring him down. This is actually a rather deep track and showcases what seperates 50 from the rest of the pack: his ability to spill his soul.<br />IN DA CLUB: This song has already been tearing up radio stations, clubs, and now car systems everywhere. You will NOT find a song catchier than this one. Big up to DR. Dre on the crazy beat.<br />HIGH ALL THE TIME: 50 blends his brashness (\\"I can battle Nas and Jigga BOTH for the throne\\") and a dope Digga beat to create a phat track to either smoke or ride to<br />HEAT: This is 50's ode to guns. The sheer rage in 50's voice combined with the way he blends crafty lyricism and threats to haters really show why 50 is so dope. However, Dr. Dre provides an INCREDIBLE track with actual gunshots for the beat! <br />IF I CAN'T: This track should be the next single. Dre hooks 50 up with ANOTHER blazin' track and 50 rips it up with yet another crazy hook in the middle<br />BLOOD HOUND: 50 and his G-unit partner Young Buck create a rediculous flow that fits's Sean Blazes uptempo track perfectly.<br />BACK DOWN: This is the track that will have people talking for a long time. Over another hot Dr. Dre beat (notice a trend here?) 50 cent totally destroys Ja Rule and is quick to point out Ja's lack of street cred as well as the fact he can't stand on his own two (\\"Jay brought you up, X made you hot\\"). What really takes the cake is the guy at the end who claims to be Ja's \\"Boo.\\" A classic track!<br />P.I.M.P.: If it wasn't for the subject matter, this too could have been the next single. Denaun Porter laces 50 with a funky carribean beat and 50 destroys it with his ode to pimping. WHile it's an old subject, 50's charisma and flow make the track a sure winner.<br />LIKE MY STYLE: Rockwilder shows up to provide 50 with a simplistic, yet very dope beat and 50 again rips it up with a Jay-Z type Braggidagio complete with a dope hook.<br />POOR LITTLE RICH: Sha Money XL provides the kind of beat the shows why he was 50's main underground producer on this one: Blazin' Hot! 50 raps about his \\"Rags to Riches\\" story with (guess what) another hot hook!<br />21 QUESTIONS: May also be a future single. Nate Doog appears on this one over a radio friendly track by producer Dirty Swift. THis is a deeper song comosed entirely by 21 questions that 50 askes to his boo. It's incredible that he does this in verse form! And who says 50 isn't a songwriter?<br />DON'T PUSH ME: Eminem and Lloyd Banks share the light with 50 while all 3 shine while warning foes to stay away. Em's beat allows the MC's to flow crazy over this beat, and they do not dissapoint.<br />GOTTA MAKE IT TO HEAVEN: Megahertz creates a CRAZY beat over which 50 writes a deep song how he \\"has to make it to heaven for going through hell\\". Similar concept to Raekwon's \\"Heaven and Hell\\", but just as dope.<br />Just for icing on the cake, 50 adds 3 bonus cuts: the hit \\"Wanksta\\", \\"U not like me\\", and \\"Life's on the line\\", all very dope.<br />In conclusion, I am Amazed! Not one weak cut! Outstanding production the whole way through thanks to Dre, Em, Megahertz, Denaun etc, and 50 showing why he is the most complete MC in the game right now: flow, lyricism, battling, deep songs, catchy hooks, and charisma that won't quit. This is the best CD in a long time, even compared to Nas's \\"God's Son\\", Jay's \\"Blueprint 2\\" and Scarface's \\"THe Fix\\". This will go down as a classic! GET THIS CD RIGHT NOW!!!!!
B00005QZ7U|5.0|For about the first 2/3 of this DVD, I wasn't sure whether I loved this movie or hated it, but I knew it was like nothing I had ever seen before. I'm a huge fan of musicals and was interested in seeing where this movie was headed. I didn't expect to be taken on such an extraordinary ride. I think this updating of familiar opera themes is done well and the special features of this DVD make what was already an amazing experience even better.
0553573411|4.0|Poor Fitz. Of any character of any fantasy novel I've read, I've never sympathized with anyone more than FitzChivalry. He wants so desperately to love and be loved, but due to traumatic events in his youth, he can never trust anyone completely. In both the Farseer and the Tawny Man series, he strives to find a way out of the vicious intrigues that make up court life in Buckeep. Ironically, however, the same courtiers who have used and manipulated him are the closest he has to family, to acceptance. It seems to Fitz that the only way he can be valued at all is as an assassin, yet every time he kills for his king he feels slightly less honorable, less worthy of love. Because of his deeply rooted moral standards, he manages to keep going. But he can never seem to find happiness. <BR>   Rarely in Science Fiction or Fantasy can one find a character this well drawn. Rather than taking the \\"bad guys attack, good guys get together, kill bad guys\\" path often taken in the genre, Robin Hobb focuses on internal conflicts, letting Fitz tell his own story through his own unique voice, letting us see through his eyes. This technique does not allow for the expansiveness of other SciFi/Fantasy novels, and Fitz's narrative often gets stuck in the mundane. Overall, though, Hobb manages to maintain the momentum and create heart-stopping drama that always leaves you wanting more. You find yourself thinking about Fitz's story even after you put the book down. You know that the \\"good guys\\" will win, but, you cannot help wondering, will Fitz?
B000088E6M|5.0|I would recommand this album to any G-Unit lover. Great debut album for 50, He proved that he's not one of those hype man that come into the game all hot then suck on their first album. Thank 50, oh yeah i forgot GGGG G-Unit.
B00001QEE7|5.0|I was three when the movie came out to theaters and it has been part of my life ever since then. I don't think there's ever been anything that appealed to me as much as The Little Mermaid has. I find it hard to write a review and find the right words to describe this movie. The Little Mermaid sparked something deep down in my soul a long time ago. It reminds you of your dreams and your hopes. It's pure magic! This movie touched so many people over the years and it's still waiting for another generation to do the same. Today or Tomorrow, even a hundred years from now this will remain one of Disney's greatest.
B000088E6M|4.0|If ...u have no idea what the street's is about, don't cop this cd. On the another hand, if u wanna witness first hand the birth of a legend in this game, cop it. 50 Cent is the perfect combination of clever word play and real lyrics. Much like 2pac did, he has the ability to crossover without crossing over and that's where I can see him being around along time. 50 Cent is the 2pac of this new generation. He's everything that Ja Rule wants to be but he can't and that's what he hates about 50.      JSTEED. IM OUT..............
0446605409|1.0|This is not a book that rises above genre conventions to do something interesting.  For one thing, it's really difficult to get past the cliched characterizations and contempt for women that this book displays.  Author writes with a sense of humor, sort of a smug tone that can sometimes make  you laugh and livens up the otherwise fairly conventional narrative.  But ultimately, it is just way too falsely macho/masculinist for me; the women are ALWAYS evaluated on their physical attributes (described in cliched fashion) and then they must sleep with the protagonist and (look out) fall into jeopardy.  The most stereotypical sexist approach to women characters possible--which just makes it boring; the attitude towards women is completely condescending and betraying some kind of weird masculine anxiety when it's not just straightforwardly frat-boyish.  The strangest part is that the talk about women seems tacked on, almost like the author feels compelled to throw in these comments because the plot itself is not compelling.
0789423952|5.0|Des Pawson created a great manual for tying all types of knots. He successfully breaks down the various categories to include essential basics, their technical counterparts and various other useful techniques for both decorative uses and inquisitive minds. <br />As an avid sailor and user of all types of knots, I can't emphasize enough the importance of strongly knowing how to tie the perfect knot when needed. I've been waiting to buy a knot book for years and this one is perfect. The first time I came across his book, a fellow sailor pulled it off the shelf of his vessel to quickly show me an example. After that I was sold on the colorful pictures, simple explainations and great organization of his collection. <br />Pawsons book is a great guide and I find myself picking it up at various times to simply relax, practice my old knots, and learn a few new tricks.
B000002UBU|5.0|Don McLean's album, &quot;American Pie&quot;, is one of the most poetic and moving musical experiences I have ever encountered. Song after song, McLean's lyrical magic weaves a tapestry of such immense beauty that the listener is forever changed upon hearing. Obviously, the title track is the most recognizable of the songs, but everything from the heartfelt tribute &quot;Vincent&quot; which itself paints a picture as magnificent as the artist ever could, to the sarcastically upbeat &quot;Everybody Loves Me, Baby&quot;, to the quiet, but visionary &quot;Till Tomorrow&quot;, to the haunting, yet beautifully crafted &quot;Empty Chairs&quot; deserves a listen. Most people will pop this CD into the CD player, sing along to &quot;American Pie&quot;, maybe skip to &quot;Vincent&quot; and be done with it. Don't do that. If you really listen to McLean's words in EVERY song, you will enjoy a far more rewarding experience than you would have ever thought.
B000088E6M|4.0|This is a very tight album but it's not a 5 star classic like everyone anticipated. First, he should have used production from better producers. Don't get me wrong Dr. Dre did his thing on this album, but Eminem got to step up his production. Second, he talks about Ja Rule singin on songs but he's doing the same throughout the album....And last, he could have used more guest appearances.<BR>Other than that, this album is worth every penny and I advise everyone to go [get] this album...)<br />I give this album 4.5 stars, but it is not a classic.
B000088E6P|5.0|50 cent has been coming on strong in the past year. If you have not herd of 50, or his G-Unit crew then maybe you herd of Emenem and Dr. Dre. Shady and Aftermath Records have signed 50 and helped to produce it. Dre and Em's influences are all in the album. Bringing a strait street style to every track. Every song is good, no skip overs. his lyrics are direct and his hooks are smooth. This is an instant classic, 50 cent is the next big thing.
0345440900|5.0|... This book helped me to understand my baby (especially the crying part) and the emotional roller coaster that goes with being a new mom.  Her techniques (which I combined a little with Baby Wise) helped me through the first 3 1/2 months of no sleep and nursing every 2 hours! It was very hard at first to let my baby cry when we started to put him on a routine.  But I'm so glad that we did it for my on sanity.  I love the fact that I know what's coming up next.  I'm not sure if the routine is more for my son's benefit or mine. :)
0767817648|4.0|After seeing reviews on this flick, I decided to pick it up at the local Media Play. I remembered loving the t.v. show as a kid, but I never got a chance to see the film on which it was based. Let me just say it's a great 80's action movie. Roy Scheider gives an impassioned performance as an L.A.P.D. chopper pilot on the edge. When he signs up to test a new, powerful military helicopter (for use in urban warfare-here!), he soon realizes the potential danger it poses to the general public. I'll leave it at that. For anyone who feels just a little uneasy about the encroachment on civil liberties since 9/11, this movie hits home. If you haven't thought about it, you will after seeing this. I thought silent, black helicopters didn't exist? Maybe they're blue...<br /><br />UPDATE- I bought the special edition on both DVD and Blu-ray, and was surprised to see the blu print to not be a noticeable improvement over the DVD version. Still a classic '80s flick, in my opinion.
B000088E6M|5.0|ja rule is sorry as hell 50 and gunit is da best
B00001U0E1|5.0|I have read through a few reviews stating you needed to know something of Shakespeare to understand this movie.  This just isn't true.  You do not need to analyze this movie to enjoy it.  Just watch it and be delighted.  It is a wonderful love story.
0783225482|4.0|My dad says its too 'freaky' for his liking, but I think it's hilarious! Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn are perfect as the immortal brats that hate each other (but evenutally must learn to live with each other). Isabella Rossalinni was slightly scandalous as the enchantress, but she did well all the same. My favorite part was when Streep and Hawn were battling it out with the shovels, then realized that it was pointless because they couldn't hurt each other. See it!
B000088E6M|5.0|I've been listen for 50 for a minute now...sh**, if u have been listenin to G-UNIT you knew they were gonna blow up. I saw it coming didn't you? all of G- Unit shi* is the truth so u know what i put down... thats how we get down. Hey someone remake &quot;streets of NY&quot; for me... good lookin 50.
B000088E6M|4.0|50 Cent won't die tryin to get rich because this album is pure satisfaction.  All the tracks are hot with the exception of a few dissappoints.  Overall this album is definitely a must get for all gangsta hip hop fans.  GGG G-Unit !!...
B000002LGQ|5.0|This album is not only one of Madonna's best, but probably her most autobiographical as well. This album covers such themes as love (Like A Prayer, Cherish), childhood innocence (Dear Jessie), pain and loss (Promise To Try, Spanish Eyes), divorce (Til Death Do Us Part), the importance of family (Keep It Together), personal empowerment (Express Yourself), relationships with authority figures (Oh Father), and humor (Act of Contrition). This album is awesome, even if you're not a madonna fan, get it!
B0000027I6|5.0|It's easy to dismiss Amused to Death as no more than the cynical rantings of the dark and enigmatic Roger Waters, a man once labeled \\"the gloomiest man in rock.\\" Certainly, it's no understatement to say that this album is so dreary it makes \\"The Wall\\" seem like a Jimmy Buffet album in comparison. Nevertheless, there's a wealth of lyrical talent to be found in Amused to Death, a sprawling epic that leaps from the pages of history and neatly summarizes the decline of civilization. Waters exposition begins with World War I, in \\"The Ballad of Bill Hubbard\\", and then takes the listener through Vietnam, Tienenmen Square, and all of the trademark details of the twentieth century - cable TV, laser guided bombs, Jessica Hahn, and so forth. He contends that the rise of the entertainment industry and media has destroyed the human spirit, wars have become entertainment, the people have become ignorant and unwilling to feel or care anymore. Take these conclusions or leave them if you prefer, but there's no denying that Waters is a master of words, and Amused to Death is humbling in it's lyrical power. There are moments of musical greatness here, augmented by near-perfect audio quality as only the perfectionist Waters would have it. It's heady stuff to be sure, but Amused to Death is a poignant summation of our times and a provocative, intelligent poem of worldly despair.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Move over Britney, there's a new chick in town - and this one's got genuine singing talent!!  Norah \\"NJ\\" Jones is one of the best female artists - and one of the best artists in general - that I've heard in years, superceding even bands like the Strokes and Gwar.<br />To me, it's basically wonderful how she blends such a mix of styles; country, folk, pop, rock and everything in between can be heard on this gentle collection of soothing songs.  Norah would have fit in great at Lillith Fair - if only she would have been a little older back then!!<br />IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO HEAR!!!
B000002KBH|5.0|This CD is incredible. It has all of the Dead classics. It's hard to live without this CD. It has everything you need of the Dead like Box of Rain or Truckin. A must have for a true deadhead.
B00004Y6Q5|3.0|I saw the movie itself about a month ago and, though I think I liked it (still not quite sure), the music was what really struck me.  It's haunting- especially the theme that keeps popping up.  A weird mix of the brilliant Kronos Quartet and what sounds like computer generated sound effects.  I use it a lot for background music because, besides the theme, there's hardly anything solid to hang on to or hum.  I recently had to write a lengthy essay on a poem by Sylvia Plath and engrossed myself in this soundtrack for three straight days because it is probably the most depressing sounding music that I have.  Anyway, I think the paper turned out well . . .<BR>All in all, definitely interesting.  Like the movie, it leaves a haunting after-taste.
0316666343|5.0|Mesmerizing.  I cried the whole way through this incredible book.<BR>It is touching and reaches your soul on a deep level that cannot be explained to non-readsrs.  Read it and you'll know.  Be Susie and feel your heart touched.
B000084T18|5.0|this is an amazing cd definitly one of the hottest records recently released. 50 rips it and with guest apperances by em and banks this cd rides almost all the way through. hot songs include [patiently waiting,many men,back down,poor lil rich,high all the time and of course the club banga in the club]. i recommend this cd 2 any1 who really likes rap music.
B00005QK3B|4.0|A longtime Marillion fan, I'm still surprised how Misplaced Childhood is so celebrated, usually over other albums.  It has always come across to me as a rather weak album by the group, especially in comparison to the the powerful albums Fugazi and Clutching at Straws (released before and after this album, respectively).  After two albums that did not sell well at the time, the group was under heavy pressure to get some \\"hits\\".  They had to come up with some pop ballads to keep the record company happy.  The result is the songs Kayleigh and Lavender.  Kayleigh is especially poppy, and sounds forced and fake, uncharacteristic of the band's music up to that point.  Of course, the songs did become very popular in England, so they achieved their desired goal.  But the songs are bland and don't seem to fit the style of the band's music.<br />Continuing on, the next song Bitter Suite sounds like the group is just going through the motions.  The song is kind of low-key and doesn't really go anywhere.<br />Now the album does pick up on the second half; what used to be Side 2 in the record/cassette days.  Waterhole (Expresso Bongo) actually rocks, and is the only significant \\"heavy\\" song on the albums, but it is a rather short song.  The album continues to improve with Lords of the Backstage, Misplaced Childhood, and White Feather.<br />This album isn't necessarily bad - it's still better than probably anything with singer Steve Hogarth - but it's a puzzling mixture of songs, and is missing the power and guts and even beauty that was the norm during this period of the band.  On the bright side, the group really turned things around with the next album (Clutching at Straws - their best!).

0385508417|5.0|I just finished reading Skipping Christmas.  BRAVO to John Grisham!  I'm not one to be able to gage the literary quality of this book, but I do know that it made me laugh.  I was able to chuckle aloud as I read it in the waiting room of the doctor's office, and again at home when all was quiet and my husband and myself were doing &quot;serious&quot; reading. It's so nice to read something that is non-violent, non-vulgar and just plain funny.  After reading most of his other books, this one was a pleasant surprise.
B000088E6M|5.0|this album is going to be in the top five albums of 2003 whent he year ends, no exageration.  the songs are amazing, and if you thought in the club was a big hit, listen to the others!  go get this cd, you wont regret it. AMAZING!
6303257844|1.0|Did you ever actually sit down and watch this movie, it's ridiculous.  It's not believeable at all, a large city bus could not jump a gap in a 50 foot gap in a bridge at 70 miles per hour.  That may be cynical but it's the truth.  Anything to get attention to the films poor acting and horrible plot line.  The only thing that saved it (and not by much) was Dennis Hopper, but I don't understand what he was thinking by being in such a terrible movie.  I find it sad that this movie actually became a blockbuster hit, and so much so that they decided that there must be a sequal to it.  I don't know who made that decision but there should never have even been a first one.  If I'm wrong and you like this movie more power to ya, but if you have never seen this movie...go get something better, anything better please...don't waste your time...I know this movie isn't suppose to be a work of art...so you be the judge...but I'm sure I'm wrong
0385503954|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful books I ever read in my life. It's powerful, intriguing, spellbinding. The writing is so rich , the story so intense, the characters so very real. It starts  slowly during a hot summer in England in 1935,  it develops in an unsuspected and dramatic way during a span of 5 years of time . It ends  beautifully  in 1999 . I was so involved in  the story I  wanted it to never end.
B000069HK2|5.0|This is one of the best bands you will ever hear.  If your into hardcore punk you will love this cd.
B000088E6M|5.0|this album will easily be one of the best of 2003, no more catchy poppy corny songs like ja rule, this is just straight hardcore. only one intro and no filler tracks, every track is bangin. i highly suggest this cd it was produced by eminem and Dr.Dre for cryin out loud
B000084T18|5.0|This was a highly anticapted album and it came through. 50 Cent is going to blow up with this cd. Every track on this album is playable. The only downside is the intro is 6 seconds long.Other than that this album is great.Even the bonus tracks are good: Wangsta,U Not Like Me, Lifes On The Line. Great album get it now!
B00000K3UR|3.0|I think that by this time in Adam Sandler's career, there are two kinds of fans: ones who either hate him, or love him.  And to be blunt, his roles in most of his movies are not that great.  For instance; playing the title character in \\"Happy Gilmore\\", he was a hockey/golf pro.  In \\"The Waterboy\\" he played a retarted waterboy.  And in \\"Little Nicky\\" he played the Devil's son.  Now, all of these roles are not ones that we can relate to.  But yet we still loved those films, and with good reason.<br />But in \\"Big Daddy\\", Sandler plays Sonny Koufax.  What makes this role so much better is that there's a sense of love from within.  When a young boy (Cole/Dylan Sprouse) is left outside his door, he takes him in and gives him a home.  And for anyone who saw \\"Billy Madison\\" you see the irony here.  Anyway, to make a long story short, it's the most well-rounded character he's every played.  It's a movie that anyone can like, even if they don't like Adam Sandler.  Grant it, he has the starring role, but he's with a great supporting cast.  It includes Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Rob Schneider, along with some Sandler-movie regulars.  Joey is particularly good here.  She provides more seriousness than most of his female co-stars from earlier films.<br />This movie is definetly a comedy--and it' a good one at that.  But it has more than just stupid laughs.  It's cute, it's sad, and it's something you shouldn't be able to hate.  The movie may be around 3.5 stars, it's better than just three.  The only reason it didn't get more is because of the ending.  I didn't think much of the ending, but I guess it was fitting.  Anyway, Adam Sandler does something in this movie that I hope continues for him; that being playing great roles.  So watch this movie, whether you like Adam Sandler or not.  It' a great film.
B000056H25|4.0|Made in the 1950's, where many epic movies were made, \\"The Greatest Story Ever Told\\" is a retelling of the classic story of Jesus Christ. Filmed in Arizona and with a cast of thousands, this film is a homage to the life of Jesus, played here by Max Von Sydow. The director, cast, and crew spend much of their time recreating what happend in Palestine, 2,000 years ago. Though slow at some parts, the Christian family should watch it for Easter or Christmas.<br />The landscape somewhat resembles ancient Israel, and the sets are suberbly done, giving us a desert-like feel. The music is soft and sweeping; a powerful scene in the film would be the resurrections of Lazarus and Christ, in which a Handle \\"Hallelujiah\\" chorus is sung. All those movie-making elements help create a retelling of the life of Jesus, ranging from his birth at Christmas Eve, and continueing from his adulthood, his ministry, and ending with climax at the Easter Resurrection. It includes a cast of thousands, including John Wayne.  Recommended for those who love Biblical epics.
6305807043|3.0|As it will go without saying mid-way through the movie, &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a film of comical distinction; it's a movie that cannot, and should not, be compared to any other motion picture in the business.  Spike Jonze gives us something we're not used to.  Although it's something we'd like to see more of, coming from a guy who'd spent most of his career in the music business.<br />But beside the strange plot, quirky characters and rarely seen 'sick' comedy, in lies a good movie.  John Cusack takes the starring role as Craig Schwartz.  Craig's a sad, almost depressed man who searches through want-ads looking for puppeteering jobs; which is comical in itself.  And sitting beside him there is Lotte, played by &quot;There's Something About Mary&quot; star Cameron Diaz.  She's an upbeat, postive animal-lover with hair that's so frizzy it's almost frightening.  With both characters being introduced, the movie's beginning is a bit slow, and let's us know nothing about anything.  But Craig's big break comes when he comes upon a job looking for 'fast fingers'; a filing job, in fact.  What's funny, is it happens to be on the 7 1/2 floor of a local office building.  Which, when you watch the movie, you'll understand.  So being a professional puppeteer, he nails the interview and gets the job.  Meanwhile, the movie's still moving at a rather slow place.  But then it starts to pick up, Craig puts his eyes upon a woman by the name of Maxine (Catherine Keener), who is a bit of a push-over.  And, being somewhat condescending, she laughs at him.  Anyway, to get to the point, Schwartz eventually stumbles upon a small door behind a filing cabinet.  Of course, being the straight-shooter-pursuer he is, he opens the door.  And while making his way down a tunnel of dirt, he soon finds himself inside the head of a human.  The human is, naturally, John Malkovich (who plays himself).  I'm sure by now you were wondering what the title had to do with the movie.  Well, there you go.  And that's where I'll leave you.  Malkovich's port-hole 'aperture', or whatever you desire, will turn out to be more than just a door, as Craig soon finds out.<br />I gave this movie only 3 stars because it lacks a strong start; something I feel is important in the making of a great film.  But, nevertheless, the movie is definetly worth seeing.  It is, as said before, categorized as comedy; and for the most part that's what it is.  Spike Jonze has made his presence felt in this business.  And if you see this movie, you'll certainly be moved whether it be in a good or bad way.  It has a great cast and features some funny cameo appearances, along with Charlie Sheen (who also plays himself).  Again, I can't compare this movie to anything I've ever seen, which says a lot.  All in all it's a respectable piece of work, and I'm looking forward to seeing Jonze's next film, &quot;Adaptation&quot;.  It stars Nicolas Cage, and is out right now.u go.

B000062XGJ|5.0|What a great action movie! Like a hybrid cross between Rambo and Alien! Non-stop thrills. Probably Arnie's best movie; the last one he made where he could still cut it as a muscleman. I remember seeing this on the big screen when it first came out and was especially blown away by the amazing sound quality. You really feel like you're there, blowin' stuff up and wastin' bad guys. Truly one of the best action movies around.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|you would think after all this time, that maiden would burn out, no way, with bruce and adrian back into the line-up, Iron Maiden delivers a really power house of an album. this album is worth buying. i was unsure about buying this one, but when i saw them on their BRAVE NEW WORLD tour and they played half the album live, i was sold immedietly. it was like a rebirth of their music. i went out the next day and bought it. this is definently one of the best. you would be stupid not to buy it. rock on!!
B00006RIO7|5.0|I adored the movie, and I love the soundtrack just as much.  It really gives you a feel for the 1920s, especially on standout songs such as &quot;All That Jazz,&quot; &quot;Roxie,&quot; and &quot;Razzle Dazzle.&quot;  I was humming several of these songs, like &quot;Razzle Dazzle&quot; and &quot;Mister Cellophane,&quot; as I left the theater, and now I have several of the other tunes in my head most of the time.<BR>   I cannot say enough about the song &quot;Class,&quot; which was probably cut out of the film because of its bad language.  At least that's the only reason that could be even the slightest bit logical.  I just adore the song---everything about it is great, from the superb phrasing to the lyrics and harmonies.  Catherine Zeta-Jones and Queen Latifah are such great singers!<BR>I am a big fan of Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra, and &quot;Class&quot; put me in mind of them (though the period's not quite right).  Buy this film and soundtrack!
B00005B36H|5.0|Arguably Tool's finest album to date, Lateralus is a roller-coaster ride of emotions from the first second to the last.  I have been a dedicated fan of tool since the release of Undertow and have had the opportunity to watch them grow into the musical talent they are today.  This album surpassed all my expectations with songs that explore so many different themes and paths to make one's head explode.  Maynard's vocals are the most clean and melodic of all the albums because of his work with A Perfect Circle on the Mer De Noms album.  Adam Jones continues to add his element of surprise with amazingly creative guitar riffs and effects that incorporate perfectly with the music.  Justin Chancellor's bass has made tool what they are today.  He added his style of bass from his previous band Peach, and it blended perfectly with the tool sound.  Last but not least, Danny Carey's drums are phenomonal.  He might be the greatest drummer in rock today and his percussion work with the Indian Drummer Aloke Dutta is clear on this album.  The amazing thing about these songs is that each instrument perfectly layers over each-other to make one clear, god-like sound.  It calls forth chills through your spine with every note played.  Here is the song list and summary:<br />1. The Grudge - Amazing opening song that shows off Maynard's voice effectively as a more &quot;hard rock&quot; singer.<br />2. Eon Blue Apocalypse <br />3. The Patient - Originally called &quot;red&quot; because it seems to be a natural inclination you see as you listen to this.  The Patient emphasizes Tool's more melodic side.<br />4. Mantra<br />5. Schism - The first single off Lateralus.  Incredible time signatures and bass.<br />6. Parabol - Slower &quot;Introduction&quot; to Parabola.<br />7. Parabola - An emotionally driven song, calls forth the emotions of excitement.<br />8. Ticks &amp; Leeches - The most &quot;hard-rock&quot; and angry version on the album shows that Tool has not completely strayed away from their &quot;Undertow&quot; days.  An excellent song, but caused Maynard to lose his voice for three weeks.  You'll see why.<br />9. Lateralus - Personally my favorite song of all time.  Lateralus is an emotional journey through ups and downs that embraces the beauty of life.  It calls us to feel the power and wonder in everything we do.<br />10. Disposition 11. Reflection 12. Triad - Originally Disposition, Reflection, and Triad were all one song together and they do connect.  Amazing songs that are mostly instrumental.  Reflection inspires all though its passion.  A beautiful &quot;poem&quot;.<br />13. Faaip De Oiad - Deals with an &quot;Area 51&quot; employee who had called into a radio station about &quot;aliens&quot; and all the sudden the sattelite was shut down and the radio feed cut off.  Coincidence?
B000002KFJ|5.0|This is a stunning album. No joke, there's not a single bad song on here, not a one. This is Black Sabbath's &quot;progressive&quot; album, bringing to the forefront some of the elements they had been tinkering with on the previous two albums. But progressive isn't what we get early on; we get metal, nice and heavy. &quot;Hole in the Sky&quot; and &quot;Symptom of the Universe&quot; are *the* two heaviest songs in Sabbath history. Or anyone else's history, for that matter. &quot;Megalomania&quot; and &quot;The Thrill of it All&quot; start to get a litte progressive-sounding: both have a lot of changes and interesting guitar harmonies, and some cool FX. But the heaviness is always there, and that sort of keeps the sound grounded, from descending into art-metal fluff. &quot;Supertzar&quot; is a nice atmospheric piece; think of it as the Russian national anthem according to Tony Iommi. It's also a cool song to put on if you're driving around in the middle of a blizzard. &quot;Am I Going Insane&quot; is sort of an odd song, but just try to get it out of your head once you've heard it. And finally, &quot;The Writ&quot; is another long multi-part thing. It's cool, but I'd rate it maybe a half-notch below everything else on this album. Wait, I just remembered the cool &quot;Sabbath music box&quot; section in the middle. Nevermind that half-notch stuff. And so ends the album, and so ends Black Sabbath's glory days. They would release two more albums with Ozzy, neither great nor terrible, but not especially significant. All in all, an outstanding effort, and a real nice performance by Ozzy in particular. If you don't already have it, get it.
B000088E6M|5.0|I've been waiting for this cd ever since I heard wankster. The album has been extremely hyped and out sold Amazon's previous top seller, \\"The Eminem Show\\", about a month or more before it even came out. So does it live up to it's own reputation?<BR>In one word, YES! The tracks are blazin and you can clearly hear Dre's high production standards fueling the whole thing. Eminem is present on two tracks, which in my opinion is more than enough, as this isn't supposed to be another Eminem cd. There's a very good blend of pre-destined club songs like wankster and in da club (that are currently, and probably will for a while, in rotation on mtv and bet) and some hard-core street songs like back down and heat, which is one of my favorite's on the album. I love the gun clicks as part of the beat. <BR>There's 16 tracks and 3 bonus ones. One of which is a 10 minute version of wankster. The DVD isn't the brightest part of the album, but you can't complain since you didn't pay for it. It's not really a movie but more of a documentary on 50 cent. Shows you where he's from, how he got in the game, and what his future plans are. It's almost like a visual extension to credits book inside the cd case. <BR>Overall this album doesn't let you down. Dre and Eminem's influences are very present but not overwhelming. You get more bang for your buck here than you will with any other album thats currently out.
B000000WA4|4.0|You have to admire the huevos of Billy Corgan, for putting out a huge, sprawling 28-song double album in a time when everyone else was making albums barely 40 minutes long.<br /><br />Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness was hailed as being Corgan's masterwork. While I don't feel it's quite deserving of that title (the absolutely perfect Siamese Dream fits that bill), Mellon Collie... is an ambitious artistic statement that actually managed to be the best-selling double album of all time (beating even the White Album and The Wall).<br /><br />Many have complained about Billy Corgan's voice, saying it is too whiny and thin. I disagree, and find his voice captivating and unique--much in the tradition of alternative vocalists like Black Francis (Pixies) and Ian Curtis (Joy Division), he makes no effort to sound like anybody else and is all the better for it. He's a great guitarist too. James Iha also lends his guitar talents to this album and D'arcy is a good bassist, though Jimmy Chamberlin really steals the show with his virtuoso drumming. His prescence was sorely missed on the followup Adore.<br /><br />The Smashing Pumpkins try everything over the scope of these two discs--progressive rock (Porcelina Of The Vast Oceans, In The Eyes Of Ruby), nihilistic rockers (Zero, Bodies), Sonic Youth-esque waves of feedback and distortion (XYU, Tales Of A Scorched Earth, An Ode To No One), soft ballads (Thirty-Three, In The Arms Of Sleep, Stumbline), new wave (Love, 1979), and straight alternative rock (Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Jellybelly, Muzzle). There's even a humorous ditty (We Only Come Out At Night), a short instrumental (the title track), and a string-driven operatic piece (Tonight Tonight).<br /><br />Amazingly, most of this works, and about half of this album is classic. All of the above mentioned tracks are great. However, there is quite a bit of filler--Cupid De Locke, Lily (My One And Only), and By Starlight are all a bit too sappy to come from the Pumpkins, and the two James Iha-penned songs are snoozers. These tracks keep Mellon Collie... from getting 5 stars, but it's close. When these guys were on fire, few of their contempories could approach them.<br /><br />While I feel that Siamese Dream was their masterpiece and you should definitely buy that too, this is a great introduction to the Smashing Pumpkins because it showcases their amazing diversity and talent. Buy it. Also consider the Mellon Collie... outtakes album, The Aeroplane Flies High.d songs are snoozers. These tracks keep Mellon Collie... from getting 5 stars, but it's close.

B00006F83Y|5.0|Honestly.  This could quite possibly be my favorite rock album, period!  This album explores so many avenues it's groundbreaking.  I can't stop listening to this album.  I honestly feel that I'm spoiled with having the honor to own this album.  This album is priceless!  You'll have to purchase 3 or 4 of these CDs becuase you'll listen to this CD so much you'll scratch the heck out of it.  I'm on my third right now.  I really don't know what else to say.  The transition between the 'The Song for the Dead' and 'The Sky Is Fallin' will have you shivering on the ground.  If you're still breathing after those tracks, track 13, 'A Song for the Deaf', will certainly put you in a comma.  When I die I want to be buried with this album along with Soundgarden's 'Superunknown'.
B000002HAF|5.0|Ah, the Pixies. What can I say about them that hasn't been said before? About 3 years before Kurt Cobain released Nevermind, the Pixies were hard at work perfecting their brand of twisted Beach Boys-meets-Sonic Youth-meets-Lou Reed-meets-Ramones indie rock.<br />Surfer Rosa is their hardest and rawest album--Steve Albini produced this one and it shows. Black Francis is even more psychotic than in Doolittle, ranting and screaming about incest and broken bodies in his bilingual vocals. Bassist Kim Deal contributes some beautiful backup vocals and a Pixies classic, the creepy Gigantic. Joey Santiago continues to prove himself as the most underrated lead guitarist ever, and David Lovering's percussion is...well..kinda there. It all amounts to a catchy, disturbing, and very unique recording that hasn't aged a day.<br />Amazing songs abound. The one-two punch of Bone Machine and Break My Body pretty much set the tone and it just gets better from there. River Euphrates and Where Is My Mind? are both among my personal Top 10 Pixies songs and the latter follows on the heels of the former. It's a slice of heaven. The rest of the album right up to the almost-instrumental closer Brick Is Red holds up to this high standard.<br />You want/need an introduction to the Pixies, and the origins of the modern alternative movement? Buy this and Doolittle right NOW.
B000088E6M|5.0|Now when we talk about the king of street hip hop songs we have to give the crown to my man 50 Cent. Get rich or die tryin is the best album in this year so far. <BR>Eminem and Dr Dre made great job in producing the whole album, Xzibit made special Appearence in The Song \\" Heat \\" Produced by Dr Dre.<BR>in \\" Many Men \\" 5o cent is talking about how Some people want to kill him just because of some hating move.<BR>Well You dont wanna forget the Club banger right now \\" In Da Club \\" Produced my Dr Dre. The Song has a Mad Beat.<BR>\\"If I cant\\" That song i will prefer to be the next single. Dr Dre made a crazy beat plus dang! 50' a.k.a ferrari F 50 can Flow u dont wanna miss that.<BR>\\" Don't Force Me\\" in that song Eminem is flowing, well i aint hating but the kid can drop them verses plus 50 got some nice lines too.<BR>\\"Patiently Waiting \\" is the track Produced my Eminem got some nice beat like Lose yourself.<BR>\\"21 Questions\\" is the track which features Nate Dogg.It Has nice beat.<BR>other songs features his group G-UNIT is just the best Rap album<BR>GO COPY THAT
B000053VAF|5.0|Well, this being the fourth in the Jersey series, but not the fourth KS movie I had seen. It is kind of long in my opinion and I think there are boring times and I love to hate Affleck and Damon as Bartleby and Loki, respectively, but that's another point. I didn't take it as seriously as I would have had some other people if there had not been an disclaimer. Anyways, not much to say about this edition except it has 2 discs, and both discs featire artwork from the movie. Disc 1 is about Mooby Egg-A-Moofin and Disc 2 is about Hosties. Final Verdict: It's very thought-provoking and really talks about sensitive material, so you may want to rent, then buy if u like it, but I would go ahead and buy it.
B000088E6M|5.0|This is the best rap cd of 2003 right now.50 had gone solo and brought us this record. I thought that it was do bomb but I was wrong i bought the cd the day it came out and it pure HOT. DO not miss out on this cd you will regret BELEIVE ME.
B00000IQC8|5.0|First off, I really liked this one, and even though it wasn't a proper intro into the Jersey series, it was good to see how they started. You have to love everytime Dante says, \\"I'm not even supposed to be here today\\"! I think the reason why it took best picture at the Sundance film festival that year, was because it is about something that we have all dealed with and that's bad clerks. Even thought this is about clerks and bad customers, it could still work both ways. I know I've put up with and have seen some mean clerks, so I can relate as can everyone else I'm sure. Also, there is kind of a spark of greatness added by putting the film in B&W. I'm also a sucker for movies that say how good it is on the front. Final Verdict: Buy.
B00005JLSC|5.0|This is probably the most entertaining movie I have seen in a long time. It is fun, funny, and absolutely original. Unlike any musical I've ever seen. <br />Story is very unique, much to my surprise. Not at all what I thought it would be. Screenplay is brilliant, score and dance numbers are excellent, costumes and movie setting and everything that goes with it are perfect. Did I mention incredibly unique story? And the cast of this movie.  I'm not sure that there is a need for me to spend much time describing how good all of them were. Just the fact that all of them received the Golden Globe nominations would speak for itself. But I will say few things anyway. <br />This is Richard Gere's finest 2 hours in my opinion. And that is a pretty big statement considering his tremendous career, which I happened to be a great fan of. He is amazing to watch (along with everyone else). Who knew he had all of this inside him? <br />Catherine Zeta-Jones and Renée Zellweger  - Wow (I don't think I can describe their performances better).<br />Queen Latifah - Mama got it going on. I always thought she was good, but had no idea she was that good. <br />And there is John C. Reilly, man that stole every scene he was in. <br />One actor that needs to be mentioned as well is Christine Baranski as Mary Sunshine. She may not be the biggest \\"movie star\\" so to speak, since she has spent most of her brilliant career in theater, but one thing needs to be said: talent just overflows out of her in everything she does. <br />This is going down as one of the best and most original films of all time, at least on my list. No typical love story attached, no valuable life lessons to learn, just pure entertainment. Academy must get over their hang-ups about musicals and hand over every possible Oscar to this movie, because everyone involved in creating such a perfect movie deserves it. <br />Enjoy the show.
B000088E6M|4.0|there is more hype around 50 cent right now than anyone in the music business in a long time.....possibly not since BIG first came on the scene. He has so many tracks done in the streets and now he has finally put out his long awaited first studio album.( I dont count guess whos back as a studio album, becausethey were tracks recorded for mixtapes, then put together to shop a deal)<br />This album is a great album to bump, but may get very reptitive after a few listens, where you may not want to listen again for a while.<br />THe beats are pretty dope, and his flow is real dope, and they included 2 bonus tracks that were on Guess WHos Back, and are very dope cuts.  They shoul dhave included how to rob, because thats the song that put him in the mouths of other rappers. <br />The DVD shows some great footage.  Him in the studio recording &quot;back down&quot;(Ja Rule Diss) and his life story told by him.<br />so , in closing, if you are a fan of em and dre and want to listen to some good ol gangster stuff, this is a cd for you.  It was a great debut, and hipfully one day 50 will make that classic we were told he could make.  But for now I will settle with this very good album.
B00005B36H|5.0|evolution is the key.  TOOL is the best example to use.  Listen to undertow, then to aenima, then...lateralus.  the evolution of each member is easily noticable.  the guitar parts, percussion, bass, and lyrics are more complicated and work together more perfect with every album.  lateralus is not a mere album, its an experience, a book on cd if you will.  i saw that someone said &quot;sold out&quot; due to the lack of profanity...why do you have to use profane language?  aenima is my favorite tool album but lateralus has more density to every song.  this, is what rock should be.
B000088E6M|5.0|Yo, this album is hot.  Not a bad song on this album.  50 is doing his thing, and will continue to do his thing for many years.  If you are an Eminem, Dr. Dre, or Xzibit fan, then this CD is for you.  Or if you just wanna listen to something new, go cop this album.  The best songs are In da club and the two with Eminem. 2003 is the year of 50 Cent.  Holla back!
B000088E6M|5.0|This album is an instant classic like Nas' Illmatic, I definately recommend purchasing this album, it'll be one of the best records you have heard in a long time.
B00000AFHM|4.0|This album reminds me of those wonderful times as a small child when everything was filled with wonder and enchantment, but not with out a tinge of disappointment and resentment.  The songs on this CD seem to be reflections of people who are filled with hope and love but are ultimately left feeling guilty, sad, or disillusioned.  The songwriting is pretty consistent throughout the disc but there really are only a few standout tracks.  The majority of the tracks lack a clearly defined hook that would bring you back.  I defintely rank it up there with Elliot Smith's<BR>self-titled disc, and Bright Eyes' &quot;Fevers and Mirrors&quot;.
B00006JLX4|5.0|Pavement's seminal debut has been re-released in one of the best moves in Matador Records history. A sixty-page booklet packed with photos, interviews, and great notes from the band is enough to accompany every listen. As for the new material featured here, let it be known that none of bonus tracks are at all throw-aways. Each track is essential listening for anyone who has enjoyed &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; in its original format. The full live concert on the &quot;Watery, Domestic&quot; disc is especialy nice, with surprisingly good sound quality. <br />Listening to &quot;Slanted and Enchanted: Deluxe and Redux&quot; shows a new light on Pavement. More than a decade after its original release, it still sounds fresh and original. The same can not be said of any Sonic Youth or Pixies album.  This album was the blueprint which all art-school noise bands followed for the next decade, but no one can duplicate the intensity, the songwriting, or the overall free-form attitude that Malkmus &amp; Co. laid down. Songs like &quot;Summer Babe&quot; and &quot;No Life Singed Her&quot; show just how intense they could get at times, but never obnoxiously so. &quot;Here&quot;, the album's best track begins quietly and introspectively, but eventually builds into a screeching monument. <br />Since 1992, indie music has changed a great deal, yet &quot;Slanted and Enchanted&quot; remains as important as it was the day of its release. Perhaps Pavement were ahead of their time, but they were so at the perfect moment.
B0000024JN|5.0|This is a classic.  It's a must have if you love hip hop.  The turnaround receiving the product was short.  Highly recommended.
B00005LMBK|5.0|When you ask someone what genre Gorillaz is you will find you get many answers. Some would say it's rock, thanks to songs like,&quot;Punk&quot;, and , &quot;5/4&quot;. Then you would meet people who declare it to be Rap, probably thanks to their smash hit &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot; and the jazzy, &quot;Rock The House&quot;. Lastly, some would call it Techno thanks to such songs as, &quot;Sound Check(Gravity), and,&quot;19-2000&quot;. Strangely, they are all right.<BR>Gorillaz is probably the most unique muscial style I have ever heard, from the excellent spooky, &quot;Sound Check(Gravity), to the Spainsh-flavored, &quot;Latin Simone&quot;.<BR>Gorillaz is best described as being like the human soul, moody, <BR>strange, and magical. Be it sad like, &quot;Tomorrow come today&quot;, or silly like, &quot;5/4&quot;, it's always an amazing experience and always a<BR>solid example of creativity
B000002H33|5.0|Now I know that everyone that has written a review about this album has basically said the same thing and I plan to be no different. Amazon.com has a list of essential albums, and there is a reason why this is #1 on the list of heavy metal essentials. Master of Puppets is the greatest heavy metal album by the greatest heavy metal band. <br />What makes Metallica different from every other heavy metal bands is their musicianship. Metallica first and foremost are musicians. Songs such as \\"Battery, \\"Master Of Puppets\\", and \\"Disposable Heroes\\" are among the most hard rocking yet complex compositions in rock history. These songs as well as others, are played in odd times other than the standard 4/4 time. And what makes Metallica so amazing is that they did not know or care what time the song was in, they played what felt good. Master of Puppets last I checked was in 17/8. The middle section of course, isn't in 17/8 but it picks up again. This took me forever to figure out and that song is amazing. People who think Metallica just plays super fast with no feeling obviously has not listened to the band close enough. Simply put, Metallica were better at their instruments then everyone else and this album proves it. Not only did Metallica play faster than everyone else,(which is NOT an easy thing to do) they were also better. This album forever changed my mind about this band and I have the utmost respect for them. The album is perfect, no filler whatsoever. Even though the \\"Black\\" Album was the commercial breakthrough, this album is truly their best. James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Cliff Burton and Kirk Hammett created an album that will live forever. If you love music and don't have this album you are missing out. I read in a magazine that someone would describe Metallica's sound as classical music played by a heavy metal band. Think about that. Master of Puppets-A Brilliant Album.

B00004YWAG|5.0|I purchased this CD without any information whatsoever after returning from a trip to Spain. I am generally a fan of &quot;early music&quot; (which is basically, according to CD store categorizations, almost everything written before 1600), so I'm used to buying CDs that I know nothing about. Sometimes I'm disappointed, but &quot;Carlos V&quot; is one of the most serendipitous purchases I have ever made. The first track is a haunting, beautiful and forlorn song about life's travails. The string arrangement almost sounds modern and the singing is astounding. It's a song that will stay with you, and you'll want to put it on again and again. The CD also has some festive party music on it that's more upbeat, but the CD and La Capella Reial de Catalunya shine brightest on the slow vocal songs. It's a difficult CD to describe, but if you're at all a fan of classical, early or renaissance music, you're likely to love this CD. My only regret is that I didn't look to see if La Capella Reial de Catalunya was playing anywhere when I was in Spain (Catalonia, to be precise). Maybe next time.<br />Lastly, there is a follow-up to this CD: &quot;Alfons V El Magnamin&quot; - it's a double CD and pricey, but well worth it.
B000070WJE|5.0|I have to confess that apart from Something Stupid with Nicole Kidman, I had not really listened much to Robbie Williams - so I'm not a regular fan of his. I bought this CD on a whim having read a review of it and being seduced by the title and album cover.  It turned out to be a great buy.  I really enjoyed the music, epecially Feel, Love Somebody and Me &amp; My Monkey.  The songs are very much ballady in type and the lyrics are wonderful - it's nice to listen to new songs with a story or meaning, rather than a chain of words with rhythm but no connection.  I cannot compare this CD with his previous work, but if you like Elton John's music or music of that genre, you would enjoy this.
0880381736|5.0|I first read this series back in the late eighties and at that time thought it was simply the best fantasy series I'd ever read.  A re-read of this the first novel, simply reconfirms that opinion for myself.  To think what Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman started here with Chronicles is simply astonishing, considering the number of novels released since this outstanding series started it all!  <br />From what I've read, they and a few others were playing a game of Dungeons and Dragons and came up with the idea for this first of many series.  In doing this, they too must've been amazed at how good their fantasy writing was.  Their style of writing, to say the least, is very fluidic with scene after scene, chapter after chapter flowing into one another beautifully.<br />Back when I'd originally read this and a few of the other early series, for some reason I'd stepped away from the fantasy realm.  I can probably attribute seeing The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Rings to re-instilling a desire to once again delve into this genre.<br />The premise:  MINOR SPOILERS<br />Welcome to the magical world of Krynn where every kind of fantasy and mythical creature is a possibility.  A group of life long companions who, five years prior had chosen to take leave of each other to search in many directions for signs of the ancient true gods.<br />Their time of separation is over and they are reuniting in their home town of Solace.  Upon their arrival, they find false prophets have taken control of their home town and that they are literally at the epicenter of where a new war is beginning.<br />Through chance and fate, they meet with new companions and that that meeting will take them on a whole new quest.  This new quest will bring the group to many strange new places with peril lurking over their shoulders at every turn.<br />What follows from this point for the reader is the first of one of the finest fantasy trilogies written since Tolkien set out to write the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  You will quickly find that every character is extraordinarily well written, with a \\"soul\\" to their words and thoughts.  There are few, if any, dull spots in this story, even as the writers clearly must get the reader from one spot to another, they inject a fair amount of humor and well placed dialogue to do so.<br />If you're a fan of fantasy and have never read this series or, like myself and have read this once before, I highly recommend a first time reading or a reread of this exceptional trilogy!  {ssintrepid}
B00005JL2O|3.0|AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER is intermittently funny and has few good surprises. The title itself is very funny bringing to mind, and being a parody of the title of the James Bond classic GOLDFINGER. The James Bond franchise wanted to have the GOLDMEMBER title removed from the film not knowing that it actually promoted James Bond more than anything else. Anyway, the biggest surprise is the movie within a movie device in which a film is being made on the adventures of Austin Powers. A clip featuring Tom Cruise as Austin, Kevin Spacey as Dr. Evil, Danny Devito as Mini Me and an almost unrecognisable Gwyneth Paltrow as the love interest is probably the best part of the film.  Overall, the film is sporadic either being really funny, or just plain gross (i.e. Goldmember eating his own peeling skin?).  One highpoint of the movie however, is the character Foxxy Cleopatra played by Beyonc&eacute; Knowles. She does a decent sexy comedic performance and is just flat out beautiful. However, there are times when she just stands around reacting (with facial expressions) to Austin Powers' (Mike Myers) toilet humor and his obsession with a mole on the face of a character played by Fred Savage (THE WONDER YEARS).  Overall, a decent film with stop and go humor.  A similar series that had almost the same type of humor, but somehow handled it better, and was far funnier, is the Frank Drebin/NAKED GUN/POLICE SQUAD film and tv series.
0316666343|3.0|While I did find the story engaging, and even charming in places, Ms. Sebold seems to lack the basic understanding of POV in writing. Is this first person or third person omniscent? It was all over the place. The story is told from Susie's perspective from her heaven, but the author takes this as license for Susie to somehow become omniscent. As a writer, I found it jarring for Susie to suddenly know something reminded another character of something that Susie could not possibly have known about. Other writers will know what I'm talking about. <br />Otherwise it is a good, quick read, and the story did keep me interested.
0446343129|4.0|Every author I have read who writes about sugar comes across to me as a little paranoid, but after reading their books they have every reason to be. White sugar is probably much more nefarious then most of us imagine. Whatever it is, I am certainly treading on a different ground when I shop\hunt for food.<br />Some good things about Sugar Blues is there is some quick really simple recipes. There also is a section on how government and industry always seem to work together for their OWN interest and not yours. Caveat emptor.... always!  Never forget that and use your common sense.<br />He also warns that doctors are not your friends.  I believe that to be quite true.  They are on another paradigm and pity the fool that neglects his health by his bad eating habits and ends up in their care.  Read this book and you could avoid being another \\"white stuff\\" casualty.  I mean doctors do wear white coats don't they?<br />In other areas the author pushed it a little too hard in my opinion when he said a lot of \\"unexplainable [car] accidents\\" in which \\"millions of American drivers\\" may be driving under the influence or effect of sugar drowsiness (i.e. hypoglycemia due to hyperinsulin) when driving after a meal, especially after eating restaurant meals which is loaded with sugar. But who knows, it could be true and never has been investigated.  Refined sugar is in nearly everything we eat nowadays. <br />His decrying of sugar is similiar to Nancy Appleton's book, but I wouldn't take both of what they say lightly. The bottom line to me is another \\"white\\" food to avoid. That is; white sugar; white flour; white rice; white salt; and white milk (non-raw).  All of these foods face extreme processing to lengthen their shelf life, but may end up shorting yours.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Nothing sets off a gift for musical mayhen that blesses the former RATM crew like a vocal cutting torch in the form of Mr. Cornell...<br />This is the best disc I have heard in years; Soundgarden with a slightly broader, outward bound persepctive and RATM sans the politicking - which i frankly think did the music no favors some of the time.<br />Unless you should truly dislike Chris C.'s voice [and it is is VERY up front on this VERY up front disc] I sense little possiblity of dissapointment with your purchase.
B0000062GE|5.0|This is in my opinion the best SW album out there. If you want depressing music, this is your album. From the electronic synths on How Can I Hold On? to the fantastic guitar riffs on Waking Up Beside You. This is such a great album that I will write a track by track review for it.<br />1. Darkest Days - Slow Song with music box in the background. A good intro for a great album - 8/10<br />2. Everything I Touch - This song starts out with a slow opening and opens up into the lead singer screaming out \\"EVERYTHING I TOUCH I BREAK\\" - 9.5/10<br />3. How Can I Hold On? - Starts with a great synth line and becomes one of my personal favorites - 9.5/10<br />4. Drugstore - Loud screeching guitar opening and less than stellar vocals make this one of the worst songs on this album, but still not bad -6/10<br />5. You Complete Me - Fast Drum Intro and becomes a slow heavily distorted song and is a pretty sad song - 9.75/10<br />6. Save Yourself - Second Best Song on this album. Very fast song. I'm supprised this doesn't get used in a lot of movies. Makes you want to go out there and kick some butt - 10/10<br />7. Haunting Me - This song does the very thing that it's tile implies. A fairly fast song with good vocals and guitars - 9.75/10<br />8. Torn Apart - As someone else stated, this song doesn't fit. It is still good and the fastest song here. It is also very angry - 8.5/10<br />9. Sometimes it Hurts - Very anthemic feel and probably tied for second with Save Yourself - 10/10<br />10. Drowning - Nice slow song. lots of bass synths. very sad song-9.5/10<br />11. Desperate Now - Another sad song. not as good though - 8.5/10<br />12. Goodbye - This song makes me want to go to sleep. Though not in a bad way. Another sad song about a guy saying goodbye to his friends as he commits suicide - 9.2/10<br />13. When I'm Dead - Quite a shock after Goodbye. Angry song - 8.5/10<br />14. Things I Hate - Nice synth line. another fast, angry song - 9/10<br />15. On Your Way Down - Nice guitar riff. Yet another angry song. also tied for second - 10/10<br />16. Waking Up Beside You -  This is honestly the best song on the album and an astounding ending to this voyage through depression. The song starts out with a nice synth and then the industrial drums come in. There are some astounding vocals and at about 2:10  the awesome guitar riff I spoke of comes in. This part is very fast and after about 47 seconds, the song take a breather and there are more vocals and screaming. Then at 4:14, the guitar riff starts up and then the song fades out to the opening synth. This song is AMAZING!! - °/10<br />If you like industrial or any kind of rock or electronic music, this is for you. And if you are depressed, this can be the music to lift you up or bring you down. I recommend that you buy this CD. <BR>Overall Rating- 9.5/10
B00004TH83|5.0|Lara's voice is beautiful. I don't have this CD but a friend let me record the songs from this album that she had of this CD, on a tape. I have all these songs recorded on a tape! =) I love listening to them. Lara did a great job for her first English album! I hope to see more of her English albums soon. So buy this CD now! Nice job Lara!<br />My favorite songs are: Love by Grace, Adagio, I Will Love Again and Giving Up on You!
B00003CXI1|4.0|Making the movie version of a famous novel is always tricky business.  How do you take something that takes hours to read and reduce it to 2-3 hours of screen time?  Most resort to eliminating subplots, or changing plotlines altogether.  These aren't necessarily bad things, either.  For example, the Two Towers diverges drastically from the Lord of the Rings, but tells a great story, nonetheless, that fans of the series are still satisified with in the cinema (for the most part).<br />Harry Potter's first film is probably the best adaptation I've ever seen.  Nearly everything is true to the book, even though some endearing plotlines have been written out.  However, when you've got an audience of kids who are probably seeing their first film from a novel, there's bound to be some disappointment.  This is a movie that gets a lot right, though.<br />First off, the sets are what they should be.  Hogwarts comes off as a place where aspiring witches and wizards could practice their arts without distraction (well, at least no distraction from muggles).  Likewise the dialogue is crisp and advances the story at a good pace (especially for such a long movie).  Plus, most of the characters are perfectly cast.  Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris), Snape, McGonagall, Ron, Hermoine are all EXACTLY right.  The characterizations are so well formed and believable, readers of the books are sure to be pleased.<br />My only gripe is with Harry.  Daniel Radcliffe certainly looks the part, but gives a very tentative portrayal of the most famous student at Hogwart's.  I know, I know, Harry's supposed to be weak in the beginning, but sometimes it just seems that Radcliffe has forgotten his lines.  To his credit, he's much better in the second movie, but the first still leaves a lesser impression.<br />Still, this is a movie definitely worth watching.  Let's face it, with the box office it did (and the video sales), you've probably already seen it and are either agreeing or wildly disagreeing with what I've said.  Either way, this is a worthy accompaniment to the novels, and a welcomed addition to children's cinema.ng with what I've said.  Either way, this is a worthy accompaniment to the novels, and a welcomed addition to children's cinema.
B000084T18|5.0|This CD is off the hook. All the songs have the potential to be #1 on BET,TRL,Billboards. You should defintly get this cd. Support 50 cause his songs are gangsta and are worth the money.
B00005QCVY|5.0|What do you say about the quintessential Christmas movie that hasn't already been said?  Nothing, so I won't try.  This is movie making at its best.  Great characters, great actors (supporting and main), great story, great direction, and superb messages.  &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; was perhaps at its best when it was still in the public domain and could be watched practically every hour on a different television station.  Thanks to a greedy media industry, we can now only see it once a season, or on DVD.  Okay, enough of this soap box.<br />George Bailey is a man down on his luck.  His dreams always took him far away from Bedford Falls, but his realities kept him firmly secured to this small New York town.  Every time his bags were packed, another emergency forced him to take on another responsibility that would more deeply root him.  Finally, he faces another crisis from circumstances beyond his control that make him consider suicide.  What could keep him from jumping off the bridge?  A well meaning angel named Clarence that knew George would never fail to do the right thing for someone else.  In an answer to George's prayer, Clarence shows him a world without George Bailey.  For a brief time, he sees how his life and love had made a real difference on those around him.<br />The morals of this movie aren't likely to be seen in Hollywood for a long time to come, if ever.  So enjoy this treasure from 1946.  It might not be &quot;realisitic,&quot; but it should be.
B000060P79|5.0|Simple Plan has managed to break out unlike any other punk rock band. Their CD has 12 great songs (newer releases have 14) and there isn't one song I don't like. The CD starts off with their most popular song, \\"I'd Do Anything\\", which features Mark Hoppus from Blink-182. The next two songs, \\"The Worst Day Ever\\" and \\"You Don't Mean Anything\\" are real good ones, and \\"I'm Just A Kid\\", their first single is number four. \\"When I'm With You\\", \\"Meet You There\\", and \\"Addicted\\" (their latest single) are all good mid-tracks, and to finish off the album, \\"My Alien\\", \\"God Must Hate Me\\", \\"I Won't Be There\\", and \\"Perfect\\", all good songs. Those who are lucky enough to get the re-release editions also feature their Scooby-Doo soundtrack song \\"Grow Up\\" and a hidden track \\"My Christmas List\\", which is the same track as \\"Grow Up\\", and starts about 1 minute after the first song ends. My favorite songs are \\"Worst Day Ever\\", \\"God Must Hate Me\\", \\"I Won't Be There\\" and \\"Perfect\\". If you haven't gotten this CD yet, don't spend your time downloading! THE CD IS WELL WORTH THE PRICE! And you can get it pretty cheap anyway, even though it is the BEST CD ON THE PLANET. (Now go see the Warped Tour this summer, they're playing the whole summer).
0553579908|5.0|For those who fear George R. R. Martin may tread the same path as Robert Jordan, oh, perish the thought!<br />Anyway, I strongly believe this won't happen. Here's why:<BR>1) As Song of Ice and Fire is brilliant from the get-go. Two chapters (or less) into A Game of Thrones and you know you're in for some real meat-and-potatoes storytelling. WoT's Eye of the World merely shows flashes of brilliance and glints of (mostly-unrealized) potential and takes forever to get where it's going (wherever and whenever that may be), and this is just the FIRST book.<br />2) Besides basic talent and knowing exactly what story he's telling, Martin has simply, yet ingeniously solved the problem of preventing things (i.e. plot threads and number of characters) from becoming unmanageable by relating each chapter from a single character's POV. I.E. there aren't that many plot threads. That is, chapters aren't split between a slew of plot developments and different character POVs; one can follow the story quite easily. As I said, there aren't that many plot threads to speak of. There are a lot of characters, to be sure, but certainly not a galaxy of them, as in WoT, and I don't have as hard a time keeping track. I think WoT works better as a name generator for fantasy role-playing games than an actual series of novels.<br />3) Martin keeps away from the cheesy superpowers that the characters of WoT seem to exude from their very pores. Not to say there's no supernatural aspect to SoI&F because there most certainly is. But Martin wisely accords it the mystery and fear that keeps it appropriately ominous and non-mundane. After all, you can't be amazed by it if it's in your face every damned day. All the characters are basically human; that is, they have the same frailties and capablities as anybody in our dreary reality. Oh, a few may have some slight precognitive powers and such but there's nothing like \\"wind-weaving\\" or \\"earth-shifting\\" or any fantastical nonsense like that. And I appreciate it because it's that much easier to like (or hate, as the situation warrants) these characters, knowing they're really no different from us. We almost literally feel their injuries and triumphs. In WoT, every other character either seems to be able to either \\"Channel\\" or have some other useful supernormal ability or other. I think I remember such powers being used even for everyday, menial tasks. Reducing such fantastic happening to everyday ho-hummery strikes reduces it to hardly more than a super-hero comic. Not to say that there's anything wrong with super-hero comics, but I don't know, I feel the genre of FANTASY genre works better relating the stories of, say, your Frodo Bagginses and your Arya Starks (to take an example more pertinent to this review) to pass through insurmountable odds and terrible tragedy to accomplish their goals or at the very least survive.<br />4) The way political intrigue is handled is many heads and many shoulders above than what you'll find in WoT. Furthermore, there isn't any of \\"these three characters are in love with this character\\" or \\"this other character wants to boink the queen\\" sort of nonsense thrown into the mix to make things even more complicated to the point where you're left to wonder what is important and what is not. You'll find plenty of this sort of crap in WoT and if the abundance of super-powers makes WoT more like a superhero comic, then this aspect (for example, the love-quadrangle) makes WoT a soap opera about superheroes and supervillains. Meanwhile, everything in the SoI&F books is expertly streamlined and extremely easy to follow. Any relevant or relationships or emotional attachments, romantic or otherwise, are dealt with in relation to whichever character's POV is telling the story. Yes, there is sex, a lot of it, in SoI&F, but any situation dealing with sex is deftly woven into the plot and works to further character development. It doesn't just sit there, taking up space and beating up brain cells.<br/>5) There's detail, but only enough to make the world real and give it a sense of depth. Martin's foremost goal is always to further the plot. No detailing every wooden table down to the last ornate whorl. In WoT, you will get this kind of overbaked and distracting description, as well as how much taller this second-string character is than this third-string character. Or how this nobody inn-keeper is fat and bald and has a flush in his cheeks and likes stories about butterflies.<br />6) George R.R. Martin is not afraid to treat his much beloved characters very, very, badly. There are things that happen in SoI&F that are very, very shocking and heartbreaking. But this only makes me appreciate the series more. You can't expect to live in such a wicked world, especially one set in a medieval-type setting, and expect to get off without a scratch. Yet that is exactly what WoT's main protagonists seem to do, despite living in the same general type of world. Through ten books, not one main character in WoT has seemed to suffer any major setback or life-altering injury. Not one (well, okay, Moiraine and even there, no one's seen the body). When WoT's characters are inconvenienced, their ordeals don't seem to last all that long and in the end, all seems to be made good. If anything, characters seem to acrue more power and good fortune. Maybe this has to do with all the nifty powers they have.<br />In short, everything about SoI&F is just flat out better than Wot. It's more skillfully written and expertly paced. I don't think the two series should even be compared any longer I can't imagine this series every \\"jumping the shark,\\" as it were, as WoT has seemed to do since Book 5; it's just too damned good. Of course, I don't think WoT was ever really that great in the first place.
B000088E6M|5.0|Yeap, I was the first in line to buy this CD!  50 is at it.  This is the best hip hop cd in a decade.  All tracks are hits.
B00007KWHG|5.0|This is the only place to now find all the classic Four Seasons material along with Frankie Valli's solo work on one single disc. Hit after hit is here with no filler. Frankie has become my favorite singer ever. Something about that falsetto just does it for me; totally amazing! <br />To check out a couple examples of some great work, check out Save It For Me &amp; Opus 17 (my all-time favorite!)
B000002U82|5.0|This album incorporates everything an escapist rocker needs, its got wailing guitars coupled with dreamy synthesizer sounding effects. This is the BEST psychedelic record ever! If you are curious as to how psychedelic music sounds just skip all those other records and go to the heart of it all with this masterpiece of rock. This is a classic ingenous album thats beautiful. The lyrics are some of the most intelligent while still maintaining a &quot;crazy&quot; side. Anyways this is Highly Reccomended!
B00006F7S4|4.0|Beck is known somewhat as a chameleon, changing styles as often as he changes shirts.  Over the years, he has developed a few key ingredients in his music: passion and honesty.  While Beck still loves the kind of wordplay and sonic adventurism that he established on albums such as Mellow Gold and the critically acclaimed Odelay, his songwriting has taken more side trips into deeply personal realms.  <BR>Sea Change is one such album, which picks up in a sense where his underrated Mutations left off.  Mutations downplayed Beck's reputation as a musical prankster, and offered songs that were simultaneously adventuresome and poetic.  While Sea Change is somewhat subdued compared to past offerings, schizophrenic genre-bending has been replaced with Beck's tremendous ability to create a mood using basic arrangements and beautiful melodies.  The acoustic guitars and simple drum arrangements glide along smoothly and effortlessly, with a Radiohead-esque noise collage background that is equal parts Beck and producer Nigel Godrich (producer of Radiohead albums such as O.K. Computer and Amnesiac, respectively).  <BR>The songs themselves dwell on loneliness, love, and loss.  A beautiful opener, &quot;The Golden Age&quot; sets the tone as one man considers his situation on the open rode.  &quot;Guess I'm Doin' Fine&quot; is as aching and depressingly wonderful a song as I've ever heard, and &quot;Lost Cause&quot; plays out wonderfully with it's catchy quips toward an ex-lover over a finger-picked guitar line.  Every song segways into the next one almost effortlessly, and the album will have you addicted by the 2nd or 3rd listen.  <BR>Beck seems bent on creating a career of longevity for himself, and this album is a great example of his abilities.  Every album Beck has given us has been uniquely and individually special in some way, which on the whole has provided a great catalogue for Beck.

0064471837|5.0|I first read this book about 7 years ago, when I was quite young.  I loved it then and I have continued to love it the other four or five times I read it.  This is a great book!  If you have time, this is a good way to use it!  I still can't put it down, and I know what happens in the end!
0316666343|5.0|This is not a book to read out in public - that's for sure!  I cried all the way through it.  I couldn't put it down, and my 16 year old daughter read it even more quickly than I did.  A truly great read for sappy moms who love their children and can't imagine what it would be like to have one murdered or die.
0060278269|5.0|This was a great conclusion to the series!  I had been waiting for what seemed like years for this to come out and when I saw it on the shelf...Well, it was just great not to be dissapointed!  Read this book!  It pulls you in; I had to stop doing my homework to read it.  As always, Lirael et al pull through and save the world.  Worthy of your time, even if you DO have work to do!
B000088E6M|5.0|For Years undrground fans have known 50 Cent as one of the best to flow, but now with his release of \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\", Everyone across the world will feel the power of his words.  Almost every track, including all of the bonus tracks, have very nice beats and he delivers lyrics that leave a big impression.  Some may say that \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"Wanksta\\" are too commercial but i beg to differ, b/c 50 Cent is as real as any rapper gets.  When he talks about guns, no lie there, he's been shot 9 times.  This cd is most definitely worth your money, so GO GET IT!
B00005JLEU|5.0|If you liked Princess Mononoke, you will find this to be a rewarding feature to watch as well.  I loved it!<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" follows a young girl, Chihiro, who's family has moved into a new area.  In the process of trying to find their new home, the family arrives at a secretive tunnel hidden away from the main road.  Her adventurous father decides to investigate the tunnel, and leads his family into what he believes to be an abandoned amusement park, where, strangely enough, they find a single restaurant cooking up strange but tasty dishes.  Still Suspicious, Chihiro wanders off while her parents dig in, and finds a hot springs bath house, where she meets a young boy called Haku.  He warns her to leave, and in so doing, finds her Father and Mother turned into pigs by their gluttonous feeding frenzy!  <br />Needless to say, the young girl finds herself trapped in a strange place where 8 million gods come to relax at the hotsprings, where she ends up being employed to stay alive.  <br />Personally, I would rate this film PG-13 due to some graphic situations, but reccomend it for the entire family!  <br />This feature is full of beautiful imagery, timely action and the right touch of romance without being ground into the senses.  <BR>I found myself \\"spirited away\\" by \\"Spirited Away!\\" ^,^  /,,
B00006F7S4|1.0|Sea Change has all the pacing and dynamics of an iceberg or tectonic plate. Beck mumbles through these songs like he has a mouth full of oatmeal.  We went to see the concert and the FLaming Lips saved the whole thing.  Long live the Flaming Lips!<BR>(beck didn't come out for a whole hour after the Lips's set, too)
076781326X|5.0|I thought this movie was wonderful, the character descriptions of the movie were ingenious. The acting was great, and I love the way they changed the Broadway musical and changed it into the movie. You could see the fear in Oliver's eyes when he asked Mr. Bumble for more and it was a fabulous job by Ron Moody the way he played Fagin. If you haven't seen the Broadway musical or the movie you really have to see it. The story's great and the acting is even better. This is one of the greatest movie that was ever created!
B00006CXXU|5.0|I like the tracks:<br />-BEATIFUL-<BR>-DIRRTY-<BR>-I'M OK-<BR>-IMPOSSIBLE-<BR>-FIGHTER-<BR>-SOAR-<BR>-CRUZ-<BR>-UNDERAPPRECIATED-<br />Don't like:<br />-KEEP ON SINGIN' MY SONG-<BR>-GET MINE, GET YOURS-<BR>-STRIPPED PT. 1 (Intro)-<BR>-STRIPPED PT. 2 (Outro)-<br />Excellent album with tons of good qualities, here are 5 things i love about 'Stripped':<br />1. Great songs.<BR>2. More duets and guest artists.<BR>3. More mature singing and lyrics.<BR>(...)
B00003CXCT|5.0|The one and only classic STAR WARS! This is quite possibly the greatest movie ever made. Amazingly well written, good special effects, great acting, great costumes, and basically everything about this movie is perfect! I'm not even a Star Wars nut, and I think that this is the greatest movie ever made. I like it more than Lord of the Rings. I think it is more exciting to fly around in space and save the universe, and the lightsaber fights are always impressive and exciting, because you never know who will win. That is more exciting to me than just simply returning a ring to the place that it was made to destroy it and encounter some unforseen obsticles. This movie also keeps your attention from the very first frame, but Lord of the Rings drags in spots. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Lord of the Rings, but I'm being honest here. If you're thinking about buying this, I suggest you do so immediately! This is the GREATEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME! Buy it today, and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!
B000084T18|5.0|Ill son, 50 has done it again. Get rich or die trying is his first release on Shady/Aftermath. This album is amazing! 50 continues to write illed out lyrics with a style that is more stylish then any style i have ever heard. Dre hooks him up with ill beats as well as many other talented producers. G-unit is on it but for the most part its all 50 and it is a hit! trust me, 50 will be at the top of the billboard charts!! The cd also comes with a limited edition DVD with a short movie about 50 and some 50 cent music videos. You need to buy this!! peace!
6305718954|4.0|The Exorcist as we all know is the scariest movie ever made, so of coarse there was no chance that this lesser film could live up to it. All told, Stigmata is a rather uneven effort, but one with a thought-provoking combination of theology and thrills served up in a thoroughly modern, stylish package. Gabriel Byrne plays Father Kiernan, a young Jesuit priest whose degree in chemistry makes him a sort of priest/detective as he investigates weeping Marys and the like around the world. Meanwhile, Frankie (Patricia Arquette), a rave-generation Pittsburgher, is afflicted with the stigmata--holes that appear in her wrists, resembling the wounds of Christ. The young woman's symptoms filter back to the Vatican and Father Kiernan is assigned to the case. The priest is puzzled by Frankie's atheism; usually the stigmata only appear on the devout (hence the age-old controversy of miracles vs. hysteria). All in all, it's not a complete waste of time, but it's short of scares and atmosphere, but it is alot scarier than Scream of course. 3.5 Stars for this exorcist rip-off.
B000000WCV|3.0|I don't know what it is about this cd; the music is awesome, it's an incredible new sound, but I just can't listen to it. I get so uncomfortable when I listen to songs like &quot;Rock 'N Roll&quot; and &quot;Fresh&quot;, and I don't know why. Maybe I'm just a very casual listener, and this music isn't my type, yet I really like it. If you're a hardcore techno fan this is the cd for you. Frankly, I like any genre of music, but Daft Punk's Homework is one cd that makes me squirm and itch in my seat for times to come.
B000003TAR|4.0|With beats from 'Bleach' like 'School' and 'Love buzz', yet with songs like 'Heart shaped box' (my fav) it has a robust new school attitude like 'Teen Spirit' mixed in. I consider it a newer and older nirvana classic. I think though that nirvana went a lil over robust with some songs and thats my only reason for takin 1 star.<BR>I suggest this C.D. very much but with cuation: Listen to nirvanas classics first then some lesser songs.<BR>There ya go, a simple anaylisis from a simple fan...
B00005JLF5|5.0|It's about time that they bringout The Deep Space Nine series.  I have been waiting for so long.  And now it is out.  We get to watch them all over again. Sisko, Kira, Dax, O'Brian, Bashir, Quark and Odo make their way to the screen once again.  As well as several of the bad guys including Gul DuCaut ad not so evil Garak.

0060955775|5.0|Veronika decides to die, although by our society's standards she has everything she needs to be happy. She is living but she is not alive. She is a 24 year old young woman that hasn't yet discovered the purpose of life. It takes the imminence of death to make her discover that being alive is more than living. She is not content with the regular monoton life that most of us live and needs a greater purpose to be alive. In Vilette, the mental hospital she is commited to, she discovers that she is not the only one with a desire to be \\"an overflowing fountain\\", and that it is quite \\"normal\\" for people to want to be different and live life to the fullest.<BR>This is a magical tale about striving to always discover new emotions, feelings, reasons for living.
B000002UB3|5.0|For the novice Beatle fan, this is a great starting point.  I would rank this in my top 3 favorite Beatle disks of original releases, along with Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's.<br />This is a strong disk from start to finish.<br />&quot;Come Together&quot; has a brilliant intro, with vocal, bass and drums all rolling together.  John Lennon's vocals are excellent and this is rocking and raunchy.<br />George Harrison contributes not one, but two, masterpieces on Abbey Road.  &quot;Something&quot; is one of his most emotional performances, both vocally and on the guitar.  &quot;Something in the way she moves, attracts me like no other lover.&quot;  Also, Paul's bassline is possibly one of his best ever.  &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; is a timeless classic, with beautiful acoustic guitars heralding a spring awakening. Each song builds layer upon layer of sound.<br />&quot;Oh! Darling&quot; is a fine blues-like tune with outstanding, emotional vocals by Paul.<br />&quot;Octopus's Garden&quot; is one of Ringo's best songs ever, a classic children's singalong that remains popular today.<br />&quot;I Want You (she's so heavy)&quot; is anothe raunchy John Lennon tune, with layers of guitars, stop/start timing, terrific dynamics and shifting tempos.  Watch out for the ending.<br />The three-part harmonies had been missing the past few disks, but on &quot;Because&quot; John, Paul and George really shine.  Also listen to the vocal-only version on Anthology III.<br />There's also the famous suite of songs from tracks 9-17.  While most of these songs don't really stand on their own, as a whole they make up a beautiful little story of various characters like &quot;Polythene Pam&quot; and &quot;Mean Mr. Mustard.&quot;  One can definitely see Paul's musical evolution that would lead to &quot;Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey.&quot;  &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; and &quot;Carry That Weight&quot; portend of the events soon to shock the world, and &quot;The End&quot; provides a nice conclusion, complete with John, George and Paul exchaning dueling guitar solos, a drum solo by Ringo and full-circle closure.  Of course, Paul gets the last laugh with the ditty &quot;Her Majesty.&quot;John, George and Paul exchaning dueling guitar solos, a drum solo by Ringo and full-circle closure.  Of course, Paul gets the last laugh with the ditty &quot;Her Majesty.&quot;
B00005QG9J|5.0|This album is quite awesome! It's lyrics have helped me through bad times and the mysic is quite thrilling! Every single song is great.... and that is why Incubus is my favorite band. This album is definatly life changing! Definatly buy it!
B0000542D1|4.0|The new edition of A Hard Day's Night is great fun.  I enjoyed the black and white footage of John, Paul, George and Ringo during their &quot;days in the life&quot; adventures.  Whether being chased by screaming fans, running around a field, or trying to curb the antics of Paul's puckish &quot;grandfather&quot; this film is full of energy.  There's not much of a plot, so to speak, really just the Beatles preparing for a television appearance, but the skits strung together form a cohesive whole.  The camera loves them, and they exude great chemistry together.  There are some individual bits as well, such as John talking with the woman in the hallway, George in the marketing execs office and especially Ringo's camera adventure, that work very effectively.<br />The song performances are slightly different from the released versions, with a live feel, although the track is sometimes not quite in sync with the actors.<br />The opener features the title song, and the Beatles running all around London trying to escape legions of female funs, an echo to the Beatlemania of the day.  The &quot;I Should Have Known Better&quot; performance on the train features a young Patti Boyd, later George's wife.  My favorite is &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; with the Beatles escaping the studio for a romp in a huge open space.  The camera work in this sequence, from the aerial shots to the slow motion/speed up served as the basis for the music video art form that become popular in the 1980s.<br />There's also a making of featurette after than with some interesting background.<br />Great buy.  Watchable film.  Fab Four in action.
B000088E6M|5.0|This cd by 50 cent is amazing with great songs and he teamed up with great rap artists to make it.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|MIB II features Will Smith as Agent J, taking the lead this time to save earth from a Medusa-like alien in the guise of a Victoria's Secret model, or in this case, Lara Flynn Boyle.  Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K had his memory neuralized at the end of episode I, so it's up to J to recover his memory in order to save the day.<br />Smith and Jones don't bring anything new to the show this time.  Jones looks more haggard from boredom than his usual cragginess.  There were some funny moments, such as the zealous sycophants proclaiming J as their leader.  I also liked the worms, with their low-ceilinged flat, SWAT team tactics, and bravery in the face of danger.  I'm kidding about the last one.<br />The bloopers were funny, and I could see where working with Will Smith might be a crackup.
B000002HAF|5.0|It's hard to describe Surfer Rosa. It's just one of those albums that inspires you to want to do something. Whether it be playing your own music or running down the motorway buck naked with a chainsaw. Surfer Rosa is just pure enjoyment to listen to. Every song is just as insanely addictive as the last. Black Francis' lyrics are brilliantly fresh and quirky and sometimes disturbing. The music is deafeningly loud (thanks to the genius of Steve Albini) but still remains very tuneful and ambitious. You can tell the Pixies just had a really good vibe between the members. They gel together in almost perfect unison. The timing, the emotion, the energy were just all natural to them.
0385474547|5.0|Chinua Achebe's &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; works on many levels, a story of Nigerian tribal life before the colonization by whites, and the tale of Okonkwo, a tribal leader.<br />The prose is simple, yet descriptive in immersing the reader within the daily life of a village.  We learn the customs, see the people both struggle and prosper with their farming, and watch as Okonkwo rises to prominence within his group.  Determined not to become like his ne'er do well but well-liked father, Okonkwo is a hard worker, ambitious leader, but cruel to his family.  As the story unfolds, he allows his pride and sense of duty to tradition overcome what in his heart he knows must be wrong.  There is a moving portion involving an adopted son from a rival village where the reader suspects that a tragic outcome awaits.<br />Eventually, an accident, but serious transgression, results in his exile from the village.  Okonkwo remains determined to return and take his place among the tribal leaders, but then the white men arrive with their new religious ideas.<br />This is one of those books that you wonder about as your reading, until you've completed it and then realize you have to read it again to catch all of the ideas between the lines.<br />Okonkwo is a well-drawn character, full of strengths and character flaws that make this novel compelling.<br />It's a thinker.
B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent delivers some tight lyrics and phat beats.  Eminem and him collaborate on a couple songs and they both flow smooth.  I can't wait till 50 Cent comes out with his next cd.  A few of the songs to check out are Many Men, Patiently Waiting, and In Da Club.  There is not one song on here that I do not like.  I can listen to this cd each and every day and it does not get old.  If you do not like 50 Cent then you are not a true rap fan.  It is worth the money so go buy his cd and listen to it!  You will not be disappointed!
B000089CKH|5.0|Apparently, this one dropped in Europe some months ago but who wants to pay twice the price for an import?  I really liked their last album, THE PROXIMITY EFFECT, but this one is more consistent in theme and feel (the songs go together seamlessly).  LET GO flows, in my opinion, like a movie.  To get the full (immensely affecting) vibe and satisfaction of the album, you need to experience it from beginning to end.  Its tracks are great, but the big picture is a beautiful meditation on the blues.
0553274503|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read.  It was amazing the way Daniel Keyes communicated the message that just because you are different doesn't mean its going to be any better when you try to change it.  This book was about a 37 year old man named Charly with a learning disibility.  He is considered to have an operation that will make him smarter. They have only tried it on a mouse. After he gets it done, everything changes.  Some good and some bad.  When Charly realizes that his mentallity is going  to decrease once more, he tries to stop it. If you want to know the details read this book! If you are into tragedie, and/or interested in disibilities you should definatly read this book.  My brother has cerebral palsy and this book taught me to honestly try to understand my brother more.
0140277447|4.0|Based on other reviews, it seems that most readers are strongly for or strongly against Chang's portrayal of the Japanese occupation of Nanking.     I would like to offer the opinion that both views are right and both views are wrong.   There is some anti-Japanese bias, but that should be expected from any writer describing a tragedy involving family members.    Chang's description, however, is valid as references are cited and (graphic) pictures are provided.    <br />Readers wishing another viewpoint should consider The Good Man from Nanking

0140177396|5.0|Of Mice and Men<BR>by: John Steinbeck<BR>reviewed by: S. Akkar<BR>Period 1<BR> Of Mice and Men is a tragic story about two different people. George, a short but mature man and Lennie, an enormous but immature person, have a goal. They have to find a job. After that,           they will settle down in a land of many acres and live happily ever after. Fortunately, George and Lennie find a job. However, George has to hide Lennie's immaturity from the other workers. Later George killed Lennie because he cannot live peacefully with Lennie.<BR> Overall, I liked this book. It was very intersting. One main reason I liked this book was because the part describing the life of George and Lennie amazed me. It showed them go through life's thick and thin. George and Lennie's difference in maturity was interesting in the book. It showed how two very different people can live together. An example of this is a quote in this book:&quot;'I like 'em with ketchup,' Lennie said.'Well, we ain't got any!' George said angrily.<BR> Another reason I liked this book is because of the way John Steinbeck described George and Lennie's goal. In the book, it said that George and Lennie &quot;will live in a small house on a land of many acres&quot; and that Lennie will get to &quot;tend the rabbits&quot; and &quot;feed it with alfalfa.&quot; Suddenly, when George killed the &quot;useless&quot; Lennie, their dreams were all spoiled. I felt bad about George killing Lennie just because in his opinion, Lennie is useless. <BR> From the whole book, my favorite part was when they got the job in the Salinas Ranch because it was a hard thing to find a job for George. That's because Lennie is always around, getting George in trouble. How happy George and Lennie were to finally get the job ! I would recommend this book to teenagers and older people because  the genre of this book is more like young adult fiction. Overall, an entertaining book indeed !
0684833395|3.0|That's about it. Louis-Ferdinand Celine wrote Voyage Au Bout De La Nuit in 1952. Mr Heller Americanised the setting and the dialogue but the entire book, the ideas, the storyline is virtually identical to V.A.B.D.L.N.
1572810408|4.0|I gave this deck to my friend for Christmas, and I really like it.  Some of the human figures seem to be just slightly out of proportion, but overall, I like the colors and the symbolism which is reflective of Rider-Waite-Smith.  The minors are mostly pips, with a tiny scene at the bottom of each card.  It is a really interesting way to illustrate them, which I haven't seen ain any other decks.  The Little White Book that comes with the deck is pretty limited, so if you are a beginner, I would suggest a standard Tarot handbook to go with it, like Tarot, Your Everyday Guide by Janina Renee  or 78 Degrees of Wisdom.
B000002GB2|5.0|In 1975, Styx signed a record contract with A&amp;M records, and this superior album was their first release on their new label.  This disc is loaded with early Styx classics, and the signature song is my personal favorite &quot;Lorelei&quot;.  Dennis DeYoung displays his great vocal range on this timeless song and also on &quot;Suite Madame Blue&quot;, a song he wrote to commerate the U.S. bicentennial celebration.  John Curulewski's &quot;Mother Dear&quot; ranks up with &quot;Lorelei&quot;, and &quot;Born for Adventure&quot; is good as well. The guitars, drums, and keyboards are all excellent, and the insturmentals blend extremely well with the lyrics.  The introduction to &quot;Lorelei&quot;, with Dennis' beautiful keyboards, is first-rate. This was the breakthrough album for Styx.  After this release, the following albums became multi-million sellers and Styx rocketed to super stardom.  Buy this excellent disc and listen to the breakthrough of  a supergroup.
B000088E6M|4.0|\\"Get rich or die Tryin'\\" was a very highly anticipated album. It was so anticipated that the album dropped 5 days early on February 6th instead of the 11th. <BR>50 displays his rap skills well on almost all of the tracks as well as giving many good laughs from his clever disses. Of course the popular \\"In da club\\" is a hot track but tracks like \\"Don't push me\\" with Eminem and Lloyd Banks, \\"Like my style\\" with Tony Yayo and \\"Patiently Waiting\\" with Eminem again, are off the hook as well, just to name a few.<BR>With high expectations, they were fullfilled after listening to this CD. This CD will definitely top the charts and bring 50 into superstardom. Let's just hope though that he doesn't die while he's gettin rich.

B000002GVZ|3.0|This review is for the REMASTERED version of this CD which has appeared in stores recently.  I personally feel that the Remastered label is misleading in this case, yet there it is in black and white on the CD case inlay!<br />If you're like me, and you owned the version of this CD which was originally released in 1990, I caution you regarding this one.  I have recently been replacing a lot of my older discs with newer, remastered versions.  Warner has done an excellent job with artists such as Van Halen and Madonna, but this one's a joke.  It sounds exactly the same as the original!  I wrote a complaint letter to Warner Canada, and the response was that yes, the new disc was remastered, but Carly Simon's music is relatively quiet and there was only so much they could do to improve the sound.  What a load of bull!<br />If you want a budget Carly Simon disc, then by all means pick this one up.  The songs are excellent, and are a wonderful sampling of Carly's work up until 1975.  However, true Carly Simon fans will be better served by Rhino Records 2002 Anthology which has 4 times the music for about 3 times the cost.  And even though I don't own that one yet, I am confident that Rhino has produced yet another set with impressive sound quality and packaging.
B000088E6M|5.0|50 Cent definetly lays it DOOWN with this album. This clearly is the album of the year so far and I doubt if any album can come close to this one. Let me break this album down song by song:<BR>1.Intro<BR>2.What Up Gangsta?  5/5<BR>This song is the perfect song to open up the album. It has high energy, phat beats and rhymes and a tight hook that gets you hyped up and ready fo whatever. WHAT!<br />3.Patiently Waiting feat. Eminem 5/5<BR>50 cent and Eminem murder this track; their lyrics are second to none on this song. 50 cent definetly did his thang on this song, but Eminem was clearly the star of this song with his lyrics. The hook is hot and the beats are phat on this one too. <br />4.Many Men 4.5/5<BR>It's a somber song with a slow tempo, b/c it touches on the fact that others are trying to \\"wish death\\" on him. The hook is pretty good, the beats go good with this song and 50 cent's lyrics are hot on this one as well.<br />5.In da Club 5/5<BR>The SONG of the YEAR!!!! This song needs no description for anyone who listens to hip hop has heard this song at least a 1000 times. IT'S Yo Birthday!!<br />6.High all the time 4.5/5<BR>The hook is hot, the beats are low and gaudy and 50 cent does his usual thang on this song: hot lyrics, disses to others and metaphors<br />7.Heat 5/5<BR>This song is one of the hottest on the cd. The hook is one of the tighest ones on the album. In the background you here gun shots and guns cocking, which greatly complements the beats and the tempo of this song.<br />8.If I can't 5/5<BR>This could be his new single b/c it is definetly a hot song. His rhymes are tight as usual with a hint of attitude. The hook is TIGHT. So far every song has been off the meat racks.<br />9.Blood Hound 4.5/5<BR>The beats and music in the background are phat but they don't fit the song as well as the others. Eventhough, 50 cent takes out some fustration in his rhymes(tight as hell) and he gets a little help from Young Buc. The barking of dogs after his sentencesis purely hotness. <br />10.Back Down 5/5<BR>This is a gaudy song as evidenced by his lyrics and the background beats. The beats are hot; the hook is another of the great hooks on this album. Additionally, for yall Ja Rule haters,this song should appeal to you. 50 cent attacks Ja rule with ferosity on this one.<br />11.P.I.M.P. 4/5<BR>The background music is tropical which does not go well with 50 cent. But 50 cent still does his thang, despite the beats. <br />12.Like My style 4/5<BR>This song has great lyrics by 50, but the hook is not creative. The hook on this song might be the worst on the album. This is probably the worst song on the album, eventhough it is pretty good. They say a team is only as strong as it's weakest player and if this statement can be said about albums, this album is really strong b/c the song is not that bad. This shows how good this album is if this is it's worst song.<br />13.Poor Lil Rich 5/5<BR>This song is tight. The beats are phat, the hook is creative and 50's rhymes are tight as usual.<br />14.21 Questions 4/5 <BR>This is 50's love ballad. Good thing it is the only love ballad on the cd. I'd rather hear his nitty gritty rhymes to gaudy and phat beats. The beats are good for a love song but 50 isn't a love song type of song. Nate Dogg does the hook, but he doesn't put it down like he does on the hooks of other songs. Don't get me wrong this is a good song but not a club banger like 50's other songs.<br />15.Don't Push Me feat Eminem 5/5<BR>The beats are tight as WHAT! The hook is gaudy and he threatens to make you think twice about trying to push him. The lyrics by 50, Eminem and Lloyd Banks are tight. Gun shots are heard in the background but not to the point where you want the gun shots annoy you. This is another song that could be 50's next commercial hit but I doubt it b/c of the gun shots and the graphic contents.<br />16.Gotta Make It To Heaven 4.5/5<BR>This song woulda been a 5 b/c the hook is kinda weak. He just repeats \\"Gotta Make It To Heaven\\" four or five times on the hook. But the beats on this some are one of the best beats on the album. The rhymes are tight and the beats make you bop your head.<br />ALBUM OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<BR>The fast foward botton on your cd player will not be touched or even thought to be touched. But the repeat botton on your player will be used more than once. Enjoy! You gotta get this as soon as possible b/ you don't want to miss out.<br />Music Vibes:10     Lyric Vibes:10      Overall:10
B000002J1H|2.0|I was very disappointed in the re-mastering of this album by George Marino. It was noisy and not up to the professionalism of the recent issued re-mastered Yes albums (of which I now have all). Very disappointing.
B000084T18|5.0|50 is definitely gonna get rich off this album.  This album is off the hook!  This album contains 16 tracks with three bonus tracks which is non-stop head bobbin music. He is definitely a gifted artist who has been around for many years & I'm glad he's finally signed to a record label.
0151008116|5.0|Martel gives us a timely, urgent account of why, after all, religion of both the group and individual type must be allowed to thrive. In a day when fundamentalism among many religions polarizes the planet, Martel's main protagonist restores our faith in the life-saving power of myth. For those who are ambivalent about, or who do not understand humankind's continued allegiance to religion, or those who refute others' differing spirituality, newfound respect and discernment might be found in the heart of this allegory.<br />As may there be a renewed love for art in its infinite expressions.<br />Pi's survival depends on his living a story. His story, whether a literal account of events or not, is his reason for psychological endurance. Nobody can refute the truthfulness of his story, neither his would-be \\"debriefers\\" towards novel's end, nor the reader. For Pi has lived one of the finest qualities of being human: To interpret reality through imagination in a way which ensures not mere survival, but happiness as well.<br />Life of Pi is a beautifully written, detailed fable. It contains an adventure tending towards a great sea epic, with the brutality, at moments, of \\"Jack London on the high seas.\\" Yet, ultimately, the story breathes a refreshment our embattled world yearns for in it's study of a fine-tuned, wordless relationship which develops between a boy and a Bengal tiger. It ends with a superb \\"ah!\\" twist.
B0000640VN|4.0|Transported unwittingly to the 21st century, a 19th century aristocrat (Hugh Jackman) becomes involved in an unlikely romance with a hardened career woman (Meg Ryan).  The result is a light-as-air romantic comedy that bemoans the absence of old-fashioned chivalry in today's fast-paced everyone-for-themselves world.  The cast is what makes this one fly: Hugh Jackman has the perfect combination of looks, elegance, dignity, and comic timing and Meg Ryan can do these self-denying romantic parts in her sleep.  Very enjoyable.
0380817683|5.0|What a wonderful book! I had been wanting to read this book for some time, since it had been recommended by so many people in one of my book groups. I read &quot;Watermelon&quot; by Keyes 3 years ago, and found it a little too light for my taste, but was simply blown away by this book. I could easily see it being made into a movie. If you want the story to be a total surprise, and would rather not hear anything about it ahead of time, then stop reading right here, or just skip the next paragraph - I don't want to ruin the plot for anyone.<br />The book relays the experiences of Rachel, the younger sister of Claire's that was barely mentioned in &quot;Watermelon&quot;. I found the book to be stunningly insightful, not just about addiction, but rather so many basic topics surrounding self-esteem. I really feel that this book has a little something for everyone - that might just be my awed opinion, but if you didn't care so much for Watermelon, don't let it discourage you from reading this book. <br />I was thinking that everything I had heard about &quot;Rachel's Holiday&quot; must be hype, and that I would be disappointed, but I definitely was not. I was actually very impressed with the author's research into this subject matter, and the great readability of the book. Don't miss this one!
B00007KWI9|5.0|Having discovered Yes's music in the second half of 1996, and have been a Yesfan since then, there's no doubt that admist all the other prog-rock bands I've listened to from then until present day, no other seems to quite match the expansiveness and unique style of Yes.<br />Having owned the mid '90s Atlantic remaster for a long time now, and knowing how most of Rhino's remastering makes a lot of these old albums sound fresh again, as well as the bonus tracks (which are nothing new, but still a worthy listening) were my enticements to snatch up this, the first Elektra/Rhino reissue of the Yes catalog.<br />One word can only describe what my ears heard with the opening bass-line of \\"Beyond and Before\\"...WOW!  The remastering really has bought more warmth to the mid range, more depth into the low-end, and more crispness into the high-end EQ's.  My main gripe with the old remaster from Atlantic was that it was way too muddy and there just wasn't that 'warmth' in Jon Anderson's vocals.  Also it seems they've done their best in cleaning up alot of the tape hum / hiss noise that usually is a problem with old albums.  It's still here (to an extent), but what can you expect from a 1969 issuing?  They got around this well.<br />As for the bonus tracks, they are nothing new.  Everyone's heard, by now, these versions of \\"Dear Father', \\"Everydays' and \\"Something's Coming\\".  However, these versions are much, much better sounding than what you hear on the BBC Recordings double-CD set released several times over in 1998-1999.  This is not saying I have anything against that compilation..it still gives one an idea of how Yes performed in a live setting back then, plus those tapes were badly deteriorated.  The first versions of this trio of songs have the same quality as the rest of the original LP this CD contains.  Better yet, these versions are in stereo.<br />The 2nd set of this trio of songs are mono mixes and have slight changes.<br />With the tehnical side through, now for the tracks.<br />There's early signs of Yes's forthcoming sounds that would be matured by the time \\"The Yes Album\\" and \\"Fragile\\" would come around.  For me, the standout tracks here are \\"Survival\\", \\"Every Little Thing\\", \\"Beyond and Before\\" and \\"Harold Land\\".  All of these to me, show the beginnings of what was to come for Yes.  <BR>\\"Yesterday & Today\\" and \\"Sweetness\\" are sappy in lyrical sense, but still worth a listen.  <br />\\"Harold Land\\", (so many songs dealing with war were written back then in those days when war seemed to be on everyone's mind....can't blame Yes for that.  I wasn't around for those years, but hearing songs like this tend to give em an idea just how people thought and felt about war back then...and also present day with all the current events and what-not.) is one of their attempts to tell a story without the spacy, mystical lyricisim Jon would throw into later works (Close to the Edge, Tales from Topographic Oceans, for example)..  <br />There are 2 covers here, the aformentioned \\"Every Little Thing\\" (orig. by The Beatles) and \\"I See You\\" (orig. by The Byrds), which has great jazz-like drumming by Bill Bruford.  \\"Beyond and Before\\" lyrically has leanings of later Yes works, and \\"Survival\\" as well, along with its odd chord changes....this song goes all over the musical scale.<br />Overall, great remastering work by Rhino, and a good look into what Yes would become just a short 2 years later.

B00006RU5B|5.0|Just as I had figured...as soon as Audioslave was released you get the people that say &quot;aw man..that's not Rage.&quot;  I got the big one here......... It wasn't supposed to sound like rage.  It isn't rage and will never be rage.  It is a completely different band.   it may contain 3/4 of rage,  but one of the things that made rage was zach.he's gone. there is no more rage. There is, on the other hand, audioslave though...they're a pretty sweet band...
B00005JKG7|3.0|This is a nice little fright film that features some really great ghosts and an original idea.  Beware of the fog!!  People seem to die whenever it rolls into town.  This is far from a horror classic but is an enjoyable enough movie.  A lot of people seem to dislike it because it is Carpenter's followup to Haloween and falls far short of that classic.  It is far from being a bad film and would make a nice addition to your horror collection if you can find it for a nice cheap price.
6304082428|5.0|Although I have seen other movie versions of P&P, this one is far and away the best. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are wonderful as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth. Also especially noteworthy are Julia Sawalha as Lydia (she is awesome!), Barbara Leigh-Hunt as Lady Catherine de Bourghe, and Anna Chancellor as Caroline Bingley (Mr. Bingley's sister).  She is a formidable presence and does a great job! One of the funniest sequences in this production is a silent scene (played under a voice-over) in which Darcy and both of Bingley's intimidating sisters are talking sternly to Bingley and we see them from Mr. Bingley's POV (they were looking down at the camera). You might have to see the scene to understand what I mean, but trust me, it's fantastic - just like the rest of the production. :)
B00003CXCW|5.0|This truly has some of the best dialogue of any movie ever.  It's hard to make a movie about the movie business but \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is really not about the movies but about age and class and celebrity and life and death.  Small subjects.<br />This is what DVD was made for -- to give those of us too young to experience a classic upon its initial release the chance to see it fresh and clear for the first time now.
B0000797IO|5.0|This movie starts off slow, but it is intended to be that way.  It portrays the small &quot;Hickville&quot; town and gradually develops the characters showing their flaws.  This movie ends up being a very heart-felt one and if you take the time to follow it...it's great.
B000002WPI|5.0|I wasn't really a fan of Wu-Tang until I got to college... I heard this playing, but I didn't know what it was. I stole it and listened to it completely. This is by far one of the top 5 rap CDs EVER made... it's just that good. From beginning to end, Wu-Tang simply amazes you by making songs that you can never get tired of... I love the kung-fu skits, but the lyrics (wow, these lyrics are just sick) and beats are top-notch. I went and bought it, and it hasn't disappointed me yet. PLEASE GO GET THIS!!!!
B00003CXBK|5.0|Yes this is a cartoon, but this cartoon is the best movie I've seen to date. The art work is fantastic, the story involving, and the chracters memorable. I challenge you to step outside the box and at least rent this movie. Though it maybe a cartoon, it is full of imagination, and will captivate you more than most of today's movies, and it will change your life for the better.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|If you like Euro-pop, then you will definitely want to add this CD to your collection.  The first time that I heard \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\", I knew that I wanted to hear more from TATU.  Granted, the group is manufactured and there is a lot of hype out there about the group.  But, the music is the reason you buy the CD and the album is a strong compilation of songs which are pop with an edge.  Overall, a great CD.
B000088E6M|5.0|i had previously heard Get Rich Or Die Tryin thanks to bootleggin and i was very pleased and it was everything i expected.the production on this album is crazy wit eminem and dre on the boards. with all the talent shady/aftermath has now and if they sign mobb deep then the game will bow down.  every track on this cd is bumpable and aint no skippin songs goin on here.  this is one of the most well rounded new artists,rap artist period i have heard in a minute.  yall cant touch 50 no more and no more shootin at my boy. forget the source them and benzino should shut their mouths.  watch out for XXL and shady in the next year.
0060278250|5.0|I first read Garth Nix's _Sabriel_ several years ago. While on a vacation to San Francisco, I happened to see _Lirael_ on a shelf. I was so excited that I purchased it immediately. When I read \\"to be continued\\" I about cried (not really, but for effect we'll say I did). As soon as _Abhorsen_ became available I purchased it. I read the entire book in about seven hours. I simply could not put it down.<br />This book offers a stunning conclusion to _Lirael_ (and even _Sabriel_). It even offers the secret behind the creature Mogget. Of course, its so good that it leaves me hoping that Nix will write even more books in this series. I would purchase them without hesitation.<br />Garth Nix writes in a style perfect for young readers, but not so simple as to lose older readers. (I myself am 21.)  Some parts of the story may be too dark for very young children, but middle school and above should be okay. Though I have never read _Harry Potter_, I would guess that those adults who like Harry Potter would also enjoy these books.<br />So, read _Sabriel_, read _Lirael_ and read _Abhorsen_. You won't be disappointed.
B000002JK2|5.0|Although Pete Townshend remains enormously famous because of his work with the Who and as a solo artist, this is his one project that for some reason many, many people don't seem to know about.  Ronnie Lane, well known to many music fans in the seventies and beyond, is far lesser known.  The two got together in 1977 for this stunningly decent album.  While the two have very different song writing styles--Townshend is more polished, Laine rougher and grittier--they manage to play magnificently off each other all the way to the end of the album, when they combine on the peaceful &quot;Till the Rivers All Run Dry.&quot;<br />One of the joys of this album is the way the two performers manage to keep topping each other.  Normally, Laine would not be considered in Townshend's league as a songwriter, but the excellence of his songs on this album forced Townshend to include some of his finest material ever, songs that one might imagine ending up instead on a Who album.  The result is one great song after another, Townshend's rollicking &quot;My Baby Gives It Away&quot; followed by Laine's lower-keyed &quot;Nowhere to Run.&quot;  Nearly every song on the album is not merely a keeper, but a flat out great song.<br />Any fan of rock needs this album in their collection, especially any fan of the Who, who has most of their work and wants more of the same quality.

B00005B36H|5.0|This is by far Tool's greatest album yet, I've been a Tool fan for six years, so I should know. I've had it for a year and I still play it once a day, and sometimes twice. This is not mainstream music, it takes a lot of time to get used. The first time I heard it I didn't like it, simply because I wasn't used to Tool sounding like this, nor had I ever heard anything like this before. However, in the end I loved it more than any other Tool album. It took me about ten times before I realised its greatness. It happend one day when I was listening to it, I realised something strange was going on when I felt chills running down my spine when Adam played the riffs on the last chorus of the patient. Then while listening to Justin strum his bass on Schism (yes, you heard heard me correctly, he strums his bass, how conventional and difficult is that to pull off and make it sound good.) I had a five second spiritual moment. I felt dizzy, and time seemed to distort around me and I felt a moment of sheer bliss, such is the greatness of Tool (seriously though, I don't try to take it too seriously, they sure as hell don't, although it's kind of hard not to with this album.). Now having said that I'll review the tracks.<br />The Grudge: Great opener, going from heavy (with an awesome riff in the middle) To a dead stop with a beautiful bass melody. Maynard's voice is hypnotic in this song, and Danney goes crazy at the end.<br />Eon Blue Apocolypse: A tribute to one of their chatrooms on their website, which is also called Eon Blue. With beautiful middle eastern inspired guitar and bass melodies which merge into the patient. I always get a sense of wandering lonely through the desert when I listen to this.<br />The Patient: One of the best songs on the album, with awe inspiring guitar melodies during the choruses.<br />Mantra: Odd but appropriate song...err...sounds of Maynard squeezing his cat. (I really shouldn't believe that though, they are liars.)<br />Schism: Beautiful bass melodies and an ethereal segment towards the end. Has an explosive heavy ending with thunderous double bass drums.<br />Parabol: Beautiful, almost spiritual song, great to meditate to.<br />Parabola: Great song, first half is pretty heavy, but then out of no where it slows down to a lighter slower segment.<br />Ticks and Leeches: The worst song on the album, with a riff that sounds like something from sweat. The only reason I ever listen to this song is for Danney's druming, which by far prooves he is one of the greatest drummers of all time, if not the best of all time. I'm sorry but this song sounds kind of out of place with the mood of the rest of the album.<br />Lateralus: Excellent song, and one of the most complex songs ever created. The middle segment is hypnotic, they all play at different speeds, and Danney simulates a heartbeat with his drums.<br />Dispostion: Beautiful song, very soothing and gentle.<br />Reflection: Next to 46 and 2 this is my favourite Tool song, beautiful and soothing, with electronics and odd drumming. The best part are the very melancholy guitar riffs at the end that lead into Triad.<br />Triad: Heavy, almost industrial instrumental peace, not one of the best songs on the album but good.<br />Faaip De Oiad: Extreamly creepy (they should put a warning lable on this one, guaranteed to give you nightmares.), with a distant drum solo, wierd electronics, and a telephone call of a guy talking about area 51 that the band got off Art Bell. This is supposedly real, and during this phone call the satelites mysteriously shut down...... coincidence? I think not.....<br />Tool have created their own genre of music, it is hard to describe, so I don't even try anymore. These days I just refer to it as ethereal metal. Tool can only increase in their greatness, and are getting ever closer to prying open my third eye, and one last thing, remember, to quote Mr. Keenan &quot;just listen&quot;.
B000088E6M|5.0|Any fan of 50 Cent and G-Unit has waited a minute for the major label debut from 50. On \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin',\\" 50 lives up to the Eminem/Dr. Dre induced hype that was laid on him when he signed with Shady Records. Although every song on this LP is unbelievable, my personal favorites are Many Men (Wish Death), Heat, Blood Hound, Back Down, P.I.M.P., Don't Push Me, and Gotta Make It To Heaven. Every song has a chorus that's catchy, including the first two singles Wanksta (one of three bonus cuts) and In Da Club. I gave this cd 5 stars for the simple reason that it's one of the few rap cd's that I can listen to without skipping any tracks. A truly good cd.
B0000024R8|5.0|A fine gritty record for those who can appreciate it, when they can appreciate it: not everyone, not always. <br />Re: &quot;This, of course, begs the question of Dylan's authenticity&quot;:<BR>No, it doesn't. &quot;Begging the question&quot; doesn't mean elicting a question. &quot;Begging the question&quot; is a particular kind of error in thinking. It means assuming the very thing your argument is trying to prove, one way of talking in circles. Logicians call &quot;begging the question&quot; a &quot;material fallacy of presumption&quot; and often refer to it in its Latinate form, &quot;petitio principii&quot;. If you aren't likely to be splitting logical hairs, then avoid the phrase &quot;begging the question&quot; and say simply and directly what you mean. <br />As for Dylan's authenticity, the whole business, not just Dylan's (Zimmerman's) place in it, is rather suspect. The steel-string acoustic guitar, for example, is essentially a pop music instrument invented in the twenties (though there were earlier steel-string experiments) so that dance band players could compete in volume; it is not essentially a &quot;folk&quot; instrument. The system behind the chords Dylan and Pete Seeger and Woody Guthrie strum on the steel-string is an invention of Jean-Philippe Rameau, a French Baroque composer and theorist, hardly a &quot;folk&quot; musician. Oh, well, does it matter? I recommend, by the way, for perspective Joe Klein's excellent biography of Woody Guthrie, also available from this vender.
B000088E6M|5.0|not only i think its by far the best rap/hiprop album of 2003, but i think its the the 2nd best after The Eminem Show of 2002.<BR>Well, most people would think that there would only b a few songs that's good in this album, let me tell you this: all the songs are GREAT!!! good beats and good rhymes that make sense!!! Buy it!!! its worth the money!! and go 50 Cent!!
B00006LPER|5.0|In America , we subconsciously champion a \\"win at all costs\\" lifestyle . .  which is what makes The Piano Teacher such a fascinating movie.  Rarely do we understand or view the dark side of perfection . . . a calculus that those who are at the top of their game in a given pursuit -  are often disturbingly deficient in other facets of their life.<br />Some reviews of The Piano Teacher mysteriously include adjectives of \\"gross\\", \\"despicable\\", etc.   But they are viewing Piano Teacher through the lenses of a different genre and sanitized perspective.  The Piano Teacher is not a family movie.  It does not provide us with solace, conflict resolution,<BR>or a \\"Happy Trails are Here Again\\" ending.<br />The Piano Teacher is, however, an amazing exploration of the human psyche, sexual repression, self-worth, and sado-masochsim . .  all seething in a professional musical environment where perfection is expected.<br />Very entertaining and thought-provoking .
B000002BBY|5.0|This album sold more copies than ANY beatles album, i think that says it all really. Definitely the best album of the 90s, and 1 of the best albums eva! every song on here is a classic. everyone's heard the likes of roll with it, wonderwall, don't look back in anger (my personnal favourite oasis song eva) and champagne supernova etc. Oasis were recently voted the 3rd best british band of all time by virgin radio - the uk's leading rock radio station behind the beatles and the rolling stones (above the likes of the who, black sabbath, queen, led zeppelin, stone roses, the smiths, manics etc). I think that speaks for itself. If you wanna get started on oasis buy either this album or Definitley Maybe, they both rule!
B000088E6M|5.0|This cd is flat out amazing. 50 flows on every track. Every song is a hit. ...This is straight street, from \\"Heat\\" to \\"Many Men\\", \\"Back Down\\", \\"High All the Time\\", \\"Don't Push Me\\". This cd is one that you just sit back and let it play through over and over again.<BR>If you don't own this disc, Buy it.....if you do own it, Turn that [CD] up son!...
0316666343|4.0|Considering some of the garbage that sits on the bestseller lists these days, I had low expectations for this book.  This new author, however, has created a novel worthy of its accolades.  The writing is strong throughout, the characterization is fleshed out very well, and the plot moves well despite a relative dearth of suspenseful crises.<br />Having a dead teenager narrate the story from heaven was a bold and risky decision, but Sebold pulls it off.  It's actually an effective method of combining the intimacy of first person narration with the point of view of a third person omniscient.  Susie tells us what she's doing in heaven and how she feels about the actions those on earth are taking in the aftermath of her death.  She can see inside the heads of living people, so we get a point of view from everyone.  This sounds like it would create a muddled narrative, but somehow it works beautifully.  Give Sebold credit for that.<br />Being a victim herself, I can only assume Sebold's description of the chilling rape scene of the narrator at the beginning of the book accurately reflects the terror of such a situation.  Disturbing.  As we get to see more of the rapist, however, the author paints those shades of gray that are the realistic portrait of a world that lacks black and white lines.  The rapist tried to rehabilitate himself.  He tried desperate means to dispel his urges.  The combination of empathy and loathing is incredible.  The rest of the cast aren't clear-cut goody-goodies either.  Everyone has their blemishes.  It's excellent, realistic characterization.<br />I give this book four stars instead of five because I don't like two of the plot twists at the end.  Other readers might like them, but I was a bit disappointed.  The writing stayed strong, I just had a personal dislike for the method.  And one other thing...why does someone driving from eastern Pennsylvania to San Francisco go through Arizona?  That's nitpicking, though.  This is a fine novel.
B000084T18|5.0|what can u say bout 50cent? Hes the man with the golden mic, and the lyrics to shut down even the famous(Ja Rule). Turn up the bass in your pimped out car, and ride out with these tight beats. This new cd is hot and if u dont got it then u missin out. And dont try to dowload his songs off the internet, its a waste off time, just cop this album, u wont regret it.
B000088E6M|5.0|50's new disc is crazy hot. All the songs are good, from bangers such as In Da Club and Like My Style to an unusual song for 50, a love song with nate dogg (21 Questions). 21 Questions is the weakest track on this disc, but it is also pretty good. The collabos with Em are very good, with Paitently Waiting being the best track on the record and Ems verse is off the hook. There are some old tracks on here too, the bonus tracks, poor lil rich and back down have all been on mixtapes before, but they are still quality 50. Overall, this cd is crazy. go buy it.
B00005JL3A|4.0|Funny thing is, this movie manages to be very entertaining and well made, despite being absolutely nothing like the videogame series it was based on.  Oh sure, you've got some famous monsters from the game.  There are zombies and for a few scenes some lickers, but the suspense and claustrophobia the game was famous for gets thrown away in favor of violent action.  The eerie fixed camera angles from the game are ditched.  The bloody hallways, and creepy silence is lost, and instead we get a futuristic science lab type building.<BR>  But still, I found myself enjoying this movie anyway.  It reminded me an awful lot of Blade and Blade 2, so anybody who is a fan of those two movies should check this one out.  <BR>  All in all, I think I would have enjoyed a movie with the spirit of the game a lot better than this action oriented film, but it is still very fun and worth seeing at least once.  The hard rock soundtrack didn't exactly thrill me either, but it is still a movie horror fans or fans of the game should watch anyway.
0060930187|5.0|This beautifull book written and illustrated by troubled poet/writter, Sylvia Plath, is a work of art. Written beautifully and creativly, full of emotion and triumph, The Bell Jar, will move you.. Funny, sad, and all together beautifull, The Bell Jar is a haunting American classic, almost lost after Sylvia commit suicide on a winter morning. I promise, this book will be one of the best classic's in American history.
0780631684|5.0|Up until the point I saw this movie in the theaters I had my doubts about the dircetion horror was heading in.  Movies like Urban  Legends and I now What You Did Last Summer were simply making horror films pop-culture teen movies by adding in popular actors and actresses and throwing in some terrible humor for good measure.  Whereas the Scream franchise more or less does the same thing, I appreciate it and like it because the humor is poking fun at the movie itself, and other horror movies that came before it.  Wes Craven, a horror veteran, knew what he was talking about, and managed to make the trilogy scary and funny at the same time, something none of the other recent horror films have been able to pull off.<BR>  Final Destination is different altogether.  Given, the actors and actresses are all young and popular, and there is some humor tossed in, the story is radically different than a typical slasher movie.  There isn't really a killer.  Teens are being killed off, one by one, sure, but death itself is tracking them down.  A force, not a human or a monster.  Each death sequence, or for that matter, near death sequence, involves huge setups, and fancy special effects.  There is an awful lot of action for this type of movie.<BR>  Overall, I definitely recommend seeing this, especially to fans of the genre who were losing faith in horror flicks.  This one is good, and I'm looking forward to seeing Final Destination 2, in theaters now.
0060537639|5.0|Inspiring thought and highly conceivable collection of evidences written by ex-British Royal Navy, Gavin Menzies, who proclaimed that it's the Chinese who discovered the America (not Columbus !!) along with many other places on the planet in early fifteen century.  Pretty shocking, right?  But he comes with solid proof and arguments.  <br />Very enjoyable reading.  Definitely one of my favorites for the year.  I have introduced this to many friends in Hong Kong and China already.
B00005RHGK|4.0|What we have here is another good attempt at keeping the horror genre fresh and new.  While this movie shares a lot of similar elements with some typical slasher flicks, this one is a lot more suspenseful, and fairly creepy at moments too, something rarely said about slasher films.  <BR>  Parts of it get carried away, in terms of violence and effects, but overall the flow of the movie is very smooth.  Once things get rolling  it should keep you glued to the screen for an entertaining hour and a half.  That's what horror films should do.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|It is so nice to finally have this exceedingly well restored classic on DVD. The print is so clear and sound so good, it is almost like seeing it for the first time. Joan Crawford is excellent, dispelling the myth that she was a movie star, not an actress. The storyline is constantly surprising and the supporting case, from Eve Arden and Anne Blyth to Jack Carson are all excellent. But it is the extras on this DVD edition that really make it worth buying. First you get TMC's excellent hour and a half documentary, &quot;Joan Crawford: The Ultimate Star&quot;, narrated by Angelica Houston and featuring commentary from many of Crawford's contemporaries, such as Anita Paige (!), Cliff Robertson, Diane Baker, Vincent Sherman, Betsy Palmer, biographer Bob Thomas, playwright Charles Busch and (unfortunately), Christina Crawford. The documentary goes a long way in turning Crawford back into a human after being brought down to the level of monster after the publishing of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;. Also included on the disc are some really great trailers from all of Crawford's Warner Brothers movies, dating from 1945-1952, as well as The Women and Baby Jane. Let's home Turner continues putting out DVDs with such care and thoughtfulness toward fans. I (of course), would love to see other Crawford titles come out in the near future, as well. Definitely well worth the price!
B000088E6M|5.0|Believe The Hype!!!...50 Cent's album is the secret weapon in this \\"Rap War\\", ready to blow every rapper away.  He flows as if it's the easiest thing to him, like he's just telling a story and that has not been seen in hip hop for the longest time. He takes you on a musical journey about his life and street life as well; something many rappers are afraid to rap about because they are afraid to show they have no credibility.  50 Cent not only has the skill but the street credibility, and it show through his lyrics on this album.  Each track has some of the hottest beats and his rhymes add a spice to each track making any of these song's a classic! This album has the club bouncer's like \\"In Da Club\\" and \\"If I Can't\\". The Hard stuff that make street anthem are there too; gritty tracks like \\"What up Gansta\\", bonus track \\"Wanksta\\" and \\"Back Down\\", which puts fakes like Ja Rule to shame.  GET RICH OR DIE TRYIN' also has guests like Eminem and Nate Dogg, two artists that always make tracks blazin'.  50 Cent is ready for the crown and it seems that it is going to be well deserved. \\"I'm Focused Man!!\\" This album is a definite pleaser for true hip hop fans. GGGGGG G-Unit!!!
6304712499|1.0|Well, I actually saw the movie last night, and don't get me wrong, I love action movies but this was just terrible. There really was not a large amount of action to begin with and the action there was was just mediocre. The character Spawn is amazing, incredible, I loved him, but they could have dome so much more with him. Some characters seemed so out of place like the little kid Zach and the old guy who ends up helping him while wearing chain mail, I mean come on! Anyway, I would not waste my time purchasing this at all, the plot is terrible, the casting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the action is terrible.
B0000025T6|4.0|Now this may come as a shock to some of you, but I by and large detest the music of Bruce Springsteen. I had the impression people fought wars to get rid of his dreadful bombast,his overwrought lyrics, and his overbaked tunes. For Pete's sake Born in the U.S.A is a crime!<br />But here's the rub. This album is a complete exception. It may be the first lo-fi album by a major artist, after all new equipment had to be built in order to master the album. <br />Why is it so good? Why do I like this when I find almost everything else he did abhorrent?<br />Because it's stark, it's simple, it is by far and away his best set of lyrics, and in its own little way it's got the punk spirit all over it, a gesture of defiance and solidarity with the working man against the forces of Reagan and co. It matters because it captures the period so very well, almost all you need to know about the effect of Reagan's policies on blue collar America you can learn from this. This is an album seemingly dedicated to the people who didn't survive.<br />If only he'd make another like this.
0767832248|4.0|Undeniably one of the industry's most underrated directors, Penny Marshall attained lofty heights in 1990 with this poignant and true drama about one doctor's (Robin Williams, in a brilliant dramatic performance) awakening his own soul to the risk of love while literally awakening patients in a New York chronic care hospital in the late 1960's. Based on Dr. Oliver W. Sacks' novel of the same time and based on his professional experience, \\"Awakenings\\" is one doctor's triumph in identifying (by accident) the correct chemical balance in the drug L-Dopa to bring sufferers of a sleeping sickness that totally immobilizes them to life. As Leonard, Robert DeNiro is the shiniest of the wonder drug's triumphs, and DeNiro glimmers in one of the most compelling and humane performances of his magnificent career. But the miracle begins to wane all too soon, and both Dr. Sayer and Leonard painfully prepare for the day when Leonard and his fellow sufferers lapse again into their immobilized state. The film's scenes that lead to that devastation are real, honest and painfully moving and don't insult us with phony sentimentality. But in the process, Leonard instills in his and his fellow patients' caregivers a sense of humanity for their suffering, and Dr. Sayer manages to find the courage to risk loving something other than his work. In a supporting role as the object of Leonard's rediscovered love, Penelope Ann Miller is tremendous. It is little wonder the film was a favorite with multiple Oscar nominations, and DeNiro and Williams are at their best here. But it is director Marshall's vision of the fragility of human life and love and the power of that which is the focus of her film, and her vision is powerfully moving and humbling.
B000088E6M|5.0|wow, another great album from 50. Making his debut on a major label 50 comes out blazin. the first song \\"what up gangsta\\" really sets the tone for what this album will sound like. if you like the single \\"In Da Club\\" or \\"Wanksta\\" (a bonus track) then u definatly gotta pick this cd up. ill just give you a low down on a few standout tracks, but be advised that every song kicks ...:<BR>\\"HEAT\\"= my personal favorite on the album, this song really gets you pumped, with production from Dre and the ebat with a gun cocking and bucking in the background, it really is the .... 21 questions is a song with Nate Dogg where 50 asks a women what she'll do to make sure shell stay with him. Even if you've heard \\"Back Down\\" on the Kay Slay tapes, on this version you get a suprise appearence but I wont give it away. my only wish is that we could heard more from G-unit, but with the mixtapes you can buy and 3 appearances on this album, im very satisfied with the album. if u are a fan of 50 and G-unit, or are interested in the phenomenon that is 50, this album is perfect. G-unit!!
B00005QGAZ|1.0|Marketing will work wonders.  Just ask most anybody who was around in 1983 and 1984 and you'll know how massive this album was.  The question is why?  Lots of hype, but little in the way of merit.  There is no reason to fall for this junk all over again and contrary to the belief of some this is NOT the best selling album of all time.  That honor belongs to another overrated artist The Eagles, whose first Greatest Hits set has outsold this by a million or two.
B000088E6M|5.0|This Cd Is Hot Eveyone Should Buy It. Its Worth Every Single Penny. This Cd Has Hot New Hits(In Da Club,Back Down and more.........) All I'm Saying Is Buy This Cd, Its Worth It. Oh And 50 Cent Is Tha Artist Of Tha Year. 50 Cent Is Tha Future. Plus This Rapper Is From NYC Queens So U Betta Buy This Cd.
B000002UAI|5.0|This was the Beatles fourth UK album. It was originally released in December 1964, a banner year for Beatlemania throughout the world.  In the U.S. alone they had six No. 1 singles and a total of nineteen songs in the Top 40--in the same year! But the price of fame was taking its toll and it is reflected in the album cover shot (no cheery moptops here), the jaded album title (an obvious reference to the industry wanting to capitalize on this cash cow) and more importantly the songs themselves.<br />The album starts off with the three most pessimistic songs of their entire career:  &quot;No Reply,&quot; &quot;I'm a Loser&quot; and &quot;Baby's in Black.&quot;  No more &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; for this group, thank you very much.  Sure, the U.S. No. 1 &quot;Eight Days a Week&quot; continued with the merry optimism, but the b-side was the downer &quot;I Don't Want To Spoil the Party,&quot; which stalled at No. 39.<br />Also, released only five months after A HARD DAY'S NIGHT, the Beatles would have to resort to their live act for no fewer than six covers--including their only studio recording of a Buddy Holly song, the lovely &quot;Words of Love.&quot; In hindsight, it's amazing how many albums the Beatles were able to release without a significant drop off in quality.<br />Despite the world-weary aura reflected in much of this recording, it is a turning point in their career and helped pave the way for classic album RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER that would follow.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B000084T18|5.0|everyone i know loves 50 cent.  his flow and the production is amazing and his lyrics are great too.  i really admire him from getting up and still rapping and going out in broad daylight and in the public spotlight after being shot 9 times.<br />Best Tracks:<BR>What Up Gangsta, Patiently Waiting, Many Men, In Da Club, High All The Time, Heat, If I Can't, Blood Hound, Back Down, Pimp, Like My Style, Poor Lil Rich, 21 Questions, Gotta Make It To Heaven, and the bonus tracks (U Not Like Me, Wanksta, Life's On The Line) THATS ALL OF THEM BUY THIS NOW
B00004BZ0N|5.0|What is there to really say about this album other than - amazing.  Without being long winded and philospohical, this album is simply one of the best albums ever made.  I don't think one can pick any single track as being the &quot;best.&quot;  This album can't be topped...
B00006GEXR|5.0|This movie is a great british movie. Its about a selfish, non working man named Will and he wants to meet women so he goes to this club for single mothers and lies the whole time. Thats were he meets a dorky boy named Marcus. They soon become friends but Marcuses mother is depressed and tried to kill her self. Marcus is sad. He helps Will become somthing and helps him find love. This is a great movie that makes you think about others and how friendship between one old and one young is very strong. Go see this movie
B000002KIE|4.0|Although musically this is by no means the exhibition of great talent, it has to be given credit for the impact it has made on the world.  Although &quot;punk rock&quot; is a commonly thrown around, and often misused reference, this album is one of the conerstones of the punk scene.  A music collection is not complete without it.
B000066NW0|5.0|I don't know why people are going on and on about how Avril's not punk in magazines and how she's from Canada, but all of you out there, please be serious. I bought this CD three months ago and I still listen to it! Unlike lots of singers, Lavigne sings with emotion and heart, and believe me, I do not see Briteny Spears or Eminem do that. <BR>The reason I bought it was because, of course, of the song 'Complicated.' All of her other songs are great too, and I especially love the songs 'My World,' 'Tomorrow,' and 'Things I'll never say.' This album is worth every penny!
B00004BZ16|4.0|Variety is the key word here.  Tracks range from the guitar driven to straight-up dub.  According to Strummer, many of the tracks were simply recorded spur of the moment in the studio, which gives it a raw feel at times.  Parts are a bit experiemental, no doubt from their working with Mikey Dread and the influence of Lee Perry.  I think this album is often over-looked and under-rated.  One listen won't bring the genius that is at work here to the surface.  Sandinista will definitey grow on you.
B00006GEXQ|3.0|Hugh Grant is great and the writing is fun.<br />Summary:<BR>Will (Hugh Grant) does nothing.  He has no job because he is living off of the proceeds of a song his father wrote (Super Sleigh Ride or something like that).  He has never had a job.  And, he is a playboy.  He enjoys chasing women.  <br />Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) is a young boy who has a lot of problems.  His mother, Fiona (Toni Collette) is a depressed treehugger (I used that affectionately because I am a treehugger) that is raising him to be different which is resulting in him having no friends.<br />Will, at close to 40, finally hits on the idea of chasing single moms.  He ends up pursuing a friend of Fiona's who is taking care of Marcus one afternoon.  When they take Marcus home after a picnic together, they find Fiona nearly dead from a suicide attempt.  Though Fiona survives, Marcus gets it in his head that what his mother needs is a boyfriend, so he tries to set her up with Will.  It doesn't click, at all, but Marcus eventually becomes friends with Will.  Will tries to help him out by teaching him how to not be quite so different from everyone else and Marcus helps Will realize that he does want and need people in his life.  Will eventually ends up finding a woman he likes and really wants to keep around and Will makes friends.<br />My Comments:<BR>The premise is fun and the movie keeps you very interested, despite Will not 'doing anything'.  Hugh Grant is hilarious.  The movie is very insightful and does a great job of teasing out the bizarre life that Will has created for himself.  Though the other actors are good for the most part (there are some awkward points with Nicholas Hoult where it just doesn't work), Hugh Grant really does steal the show.<br />Ultimately the movie ends up being about friendship and love and needing people to survive in this world (and I guess, in a sense, about growing up).  It is a good message that is a bit overt but not overly so.  The movie is fun, but never really enters into the realm of emotionally compelling (at least it didn't for me).  I would recommend it.  It is a very fun romantic comedy, though the romance is really more between Will and Marcus and their relationship than it is between Will and his love interest.
B000001IQH|5.0|Man,I don't know what to say....do you know why this is the classic Rancid's album?....well just cuz it's the greatest....it's so punk,reggae-ska influenced....but just a little bit,great Matt Freeman's Bass solos,excellent vocals by Lars Fredericksen and awesome grunts and snarls by lint...(Tim Armstrong you poser!)......THIS album it's just great...it tells you sad stories from a bunch of east bay punkers,nice chorus,great music,....maybe this album Put'em directly to the mainstream....but give 'em a breake suckas.....this is one of the punkest gems of all times,....when you're kids become punks...and will listen to Fat Mike's grandsons,this album will be kinda like Nevermind the Bollocks.....A webo.....
B000088E6M|5.0|This CD is off da chain.  If youre lookin fo a street album get this.  Every track is dope on this album but the best songs are Wanksta, In Da Club, Many Men, Patiently Waiting, and Don't Push Me. Guest appearences by Eminem, Nate Dogg, and G-Unit make this album a keeper.
B000068IEU|4.0|sure, this film is relentless, however, i believe it is also very black and very funny.  do any of you out there ever watch movies by john waters or andy warhol or sam peckinpah?  well this film has elements of each of those wonderful directors.  chelsea girls meets straw dogs meets pink flamingos.  let's face it -- life is insane.  and don't go looking for pot from no stranger in a &quot;bad neigborhood&quot;, ok?  especially when your on your way to a rock concert!
0066214122|5.0|I've considered Crichton my favorite author since I was eleven years old.  I've even read his nonfiction.  I don't expect for his books to be any different from the all the rest, and that's why I love him- for his constancy.<br />I was thrilled when Timeline came out, because that's real Crichton to me, and it didn't disappoint.<br />Prey is the same- it is chock full of Crichton characters- the doomsday prophet, a la Ian Malcolm, the 'good of the company' guy, the brilliant scientist, or two, or three, the human sabateur.  They're all here in Prey.  Why should we fault the man for writing another technology-run-amok narrative?  Do we fault Grisham for writing another book about laywers?<br />The bottom line is: Prey might not be shockingly different than Crichton's other books, but if you love Jurassic Park, Andromeda Strain and Sphere, you'll love this one too!  Because everything we love about Crichton is alive and well in Prey. <br />It's so rare that you get just what you expect in a book (whether that be good or bad), but I know that I'll enjoy Crichton's books every time, and that's very comforting to me.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a very interesting book. Lois Lowry does an excellent job in creating an utopian world that takes place in the distant future. However, as Jonas the protagonist learns, this world isn't perfect. The communities are hiding a secret, even from themselves!<br />With an intriguing plot, setting, and characters, I was able to read the book in two sittings, unable to notice the passing of time. When a book is able to do that, we all know it's good.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|True, the beats like that of 'Wandering Star' will not be found here.  A fan of Portishead will still delight in one part of what made Portishead a listen all your friends wondered why was in your collection.  Beth's voice is still as deep, dark and present in all these tracks.  The creepy sonic sound that defined Portishead was not just the sick sultry beats and deck work.  Beth's vocal black magic is present on this album like the overly depressed Bjork we all heard her emotives to be.  The smooth jazzy aspect is still there too.  This album should be acquired for those Portishead fans that have a chillmo side to them.
B000088E6M|5.0|Unlike most of the pencil geeks who write reviews on here I think this album is great. 50 Cent is nowhere as good as 2 pac or Nas but he makes good songs and his humor is hilarious. Check out track 10 50 dont back down. He pretty much disses murder inc which I think is a record label for nothing more then [people] that cant rap or sing for that matter (Ja rule aka cookie monster). If you want to hear some real good new rap try the indie scene. 50 cent started out independent and I feel he has paid his dues to be where he is right now. I see 50 exploding and putting murder inc out of buisness. Who wants to hear ja rule do another ballad? I will stick to eminem and 50 cent. In my opinion these are the top 3 rap albums out right now: Nas- Gods son, 2 pac- better days, and 3 50cent-get rich or die trying. Check out those 3 albums you will be hook on them I pormise. I only wish real rap fans wrote reviews on here.
0385484518|5.0|This is both a great read and a fast read.  The book actually is actually two stories at the same time.  One: That Morrie is a beloved proffessor and he is dying.  Two  Mitch Albom is his student that has reconnected with Morrie when he learns that Morrie is dying.  Albom writes with love about his friend as he undergoes the dying process. Albom  also fills the reader in with details why Morrie is so close to him and yet he still manages to lose touch with him.  Albom does a good job in letting the reader know of his love for Morrie and the dignity in which he dies with.  This book is about reconection and remembering what is important through simple conversations the men had with each other.  After done reading this book, you will be left with the feeling that you will want to track down a friend that has been out of touch.
B000088E6M|5.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST OF 2003 ALOT OF GOOD HARD HITTIN BEATS AND GOOD FOR A CD TO CHILL AND SMOKE TO THERES SOME BONUS TRACKS ON HERE THAT THEY DONT SHOW U ON THE LIST BUT THERE THREE SONGS AND ONE OF THEM IS WANGSTA THE OTHERS U WILL SEE ON THE CD ONCE U BUY IT CAUSE I DONT FEEL LIKE GETTIN UP AND TYPIN WAT THEY ARE THIS CD IS WORTH UR MONEY SO ALL YALL NEED TO GET OFF UR A$$ AND GET THIS ABLUM TODAY
B000088E6M|5.0|da new 50 cent join is da hottest thing out dere. fresh to da mainstream and vital to underground hip hop 50 cent brings a much needed freshness in the hip hop sound. His lyrics are catchy and his beats are nuthin but contagious. 50cent is a guy who has gone through many turmoils to get where he at right now. shady/aftermath hit a gold mine wit 50 cent and he's not crying bout da deal either. including such hits as in da club and wanksta da beat to dese songs are very contagious and da hooks are very contagious u'll be singing dem day in and day out. i guarantee it. Even though there arent that many songs that could be used in dance clubs or wutever da cd all in all deserves its 5 stars that i have given it. this of course is just my opinion....
B000088E6M|5.0|This cd is gunna be huge, the dvd is good too. the cd is full of good songs like &quot;If I can't&quot; and &quot;Blood Hound&quot; Nate Dogg, Eminem, and G-Unit appear on the cd.
B00005OAIE|5.0|First, I don't know why people compare John Mayer with DMB. Both are good and are different from each other. I only bought this album because my wife wanted it. I listened to it and there is not one bad song on this album. I am really getting sick of DMB fans saying everyone is trying to copy them. I like DMB, but there are MUCH better bands out there. I even went to see DMB in concert and was EXTREMELY disappointed. They (DMB) didn't play one song off beyond these crowded streets album. My friend, who I went with, said that you have to go back tomorrow night to hear those songs. DMB plays different songs every night! Oh, so let me pay anther $50 bucks, just so I can hope to hear the songs that I like. DMB is a good band, but John Mayer is good also. John Mayer will probably be worth the $50! I am not trying to bash DMB, but people have to get real. DMB is not that good. His last two albums have been TERRIBLE! I can't wait for the next John Mayer album. All you DMB fanatics lay off!
B00007KWHG|5.0|All of the Four Seasons Top 10 hits, as well as Frankie Valli's solo Top 10's are included on this quick and easy to digest sampler.    Rhino's 1988 1 disc Anthology digs deeper in to the Four Seasons catalog by including 25 songs and only one Valli solo, but by focusing on their big hits this makes for a tight and more useful compilation.  The liner notes are 2003 up-to-date with photos and Billboard chart info for each song. The group was inducted in to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. This is the best place to start your Frankie Valli and Four Season collection.
B000056K04|5.0|While this album may not have boasted a Titanic smash radio single like all of his other albums, this album is the best work DMB has done overall, for several reasons.  First off, it's his first album which isn't a jam session, which is a new twist.  He changed things up, cut the songs down, and made the songs easier to sing along to.<br />I was running through all of his albums before, and this one, &quot;Everyday&quot; possibly has the most songs that are worthy of being on a greatest hits album, should he make one.  My favorites on this album are &quot;What You Are&quot;, &quot;The Space Between&quot;, &quot;If I Had it All&quot;, &quot;Everyday&quot;, and &quot;Angel&quot;.  All top notch songs.  There really is no filler on this album but I really don't care for &quot;I did it&quot; and &quot;Sleep to Dream Her&quot;.  All in all, solid effort.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|The original Blade was an engaging, character-driven action flick, only slightly memorable but a fun ride. Blade 2 brings back the engaging part but leaves out the characterization. Fortunately, it replaces the void with amazing effects/gore and outstanding choreography. This is a DVD review, however, so if you want a more specific plot review, go hit IMDB.<br />This film was made for DVD. The fight scenes, gore and ludicrous script all explode from the tube in glorious filtered color. There is a definite \\"cool\\" variable about Blade 2 that keeps one's attention on the action and away from the glaring plot holes, specifically:<br />- Sound editing. Director Guillermo Del Toro got himself a good man, or (more likely) oversaw himself the razor sound and audio effects cuts. The 2nd nightclub scene and the Bond-esque gadget scene brought a smile to me :)<br />- There are 2 commentaries, and I've only seen the one with Snipes and Del Toro, and it proved forgettable. Wes is as wooden in describing Blade as he is in acting him, 'nuff said. Del Toro just laughed along. There is another commentary with Del Toro and the producer, for those who can't get enough of them.<br />- Deleted scenes are included but unedited, re: videotape quality. They were deleted plot-wise with good reason (Snipes driving around for 3 minutes in his GTO, e.g.), so don't by any means hold this feature as a decision-making on buying the DVD.<br />- \\"Pact in Blood\\" documentaries: probably the best feature on the DVD, if you like \\"behind the scenes/making of\\" whatnot. Actually quite interesting how the clawjaw vampires were created, and the various superjumping and falling was done. Recommended if you go for this stuff. Adds about 30 very engaging minutes to your purchase/rent.<br />- Everything else is strictly taste-wise; the trailers, an art gallery and a music video are all here on a well-presented 2 disc set. The menus and interfaces are all very clean and easy to navigate, incidentley.<br />Overall, it's a safe purchase if you buy new for under [money amount], and enjoy action/horror. It's an excellent buy if you can get it used for under [money amount] as I did.<BR
B000000OE7|5.0|This is one of those albums to play when you are feeling nostalgic and pensive. It is gloomy, not totally, cause the trax from Freddie's solo album(on here) punctuate the melancholy. Made in Heaven(the song) sounds like its name, for it rises to such a spiritually transcendent level, you could almost mistake it for schmaltzy, but I adamantly proclaim it is NOT SUCH!-it may be the grandest they have ever sounded. It is so grand it will knock you off balance when you first hear it.<br /> Too Much Love Will Kill You has wonderful, wayworn lyrics, that fit so well on their swansong album. It is both sparse and elegant, and will touch those who have truly lived.<br /> You Don't Fool Me is Freddie and Brian making love and laughing with their backs against the wall. Freddie is doing what he did best-showing his beauty and determination in a carefree chantuese sort of way, while Brian chimes in with a glittering and glorious solo which seems to be a homage to his singer(like a lot of this cd).<br /> The second Its a Beautiful Day is the band letting out their pent up anguish, and pulling out all stops and letting out a ten on the frenzy/crunching gothic scale that harkens back to their trenchant style. They intertwine the vocals as a sonic device, complementing Brian's howling guitar, while Roger's drums revel like pounding fury. This track is complex, yet tribal and primal, and is another virtuoso piece to this tribute to Freddie. Listen to this song LOUD, you will hear something different every time you play it.<br /> These are just 4 songs, but the whole lp seems so cohesive its amazing, considering the group had to patch it together. It may have helped that they always recorded in bits and pieces at a time, so maybe this hurdle(Freddie gone) was weirdly moot.<br /> If you find yourself reflective, and want to be accompanied by something deep, proudly defiant(as Freddie's spirit radiated), and so subtley mature, this is a beautiful vehicle that will transport your soul like medicine. It is a unique lp, and as great as anything they ever did, and that includes QueenII, SHA, and ANATO. From a fan of 25 years.s a unique lp, and as great as anything they ever did, and that includes QueenII, SHA, and ANATO. From a fan of 25 years.
B0000062GK|5.0|Joe Satriani has, over his musical career and discography, defined the term &quot;evolve&quot; more positively than any other artist I know of. Most artists stray into differing realms of their birth, often better and sometimes for worse. Only Satriani has done this with a defined, efficient purposefulness, changing the sound and approach when it deems fit to do so, rather than because &quot;it sounds cool&quot;. Check out Engines of Creation when you want to hear him hit (briefly) this stage (which is actually a decent listen as it is).<br />Crystal Planet is Joe's magnum opus for this ideal. Every song is crafted, in true Satch tradition, efficiently, with clear melodies and excellent progression. He has bottomed out the sound to create more of a &quot;whole band&quot; persona, and even though his guitar is soaring, the drums, and particularly the bass, come across as never before in a Satriani album. The music is some of Joe's tightest and most polished yet, employing intricate double-kick drums and complex bass lines. You may find yourself playing a couple of the tracks for your speed-metalhead friends just to see the looks on their faces. Standouts include &quot;Ceremony&quot;, &quot;Love Thing&quot;, and the superb title track (which will shatter any notions that Satch reached his pinnacle several years back).<br />I wrote this review back in 2000 for another online consumer review site, and having dug out Crystal Planet back to active use, it still sounds as jaw-dropping as when I first pressed it into my player 6 years ago. If you haven't heard it, run, don't walk, to buy it now!
B00006SFBD|5.0|opeth's sixth, deliverance, is easily one of their best to date. many say that this just doesnt &quot;do it&quot; for them, but i cannot see their logic. the song &quot;deliverance&quot; is easily one of the best they have ever put out in their career, and all others are almost as good. ok, so this album is much more brutal than anything theyre ever done(the opening riff on &quot;master's apprentices&quot; would make any morbid angel fan blush). however, &quot; a fair judgement&quot; is one of opeths best soft song to date, with some of the best vocals mikal has ever done.

B0000640VO|5.0|I loved this movie!  But the only parts I did not like was the ones with all the sex.  That was a little too much for me to handle.  Overall, it's very good.  The colors are vivid, the actors and actresses can communicate really well with one another.
B0000640VO|5.0|This was one of the sweetest, most whimsical movies I've seen in a long time! Audrey Tautou (The Venus Beauty Institue) is absolutely beguiling as Amelie, an extremely shy and eccentric young woman. When Amelie sees the delight she brings to a man after she anonymously returns his long-lost box of childhood treasures, she devotes her life to helping others find this same joy. While Amelie is doing all of these good deeds, she discovers a young man as charmingly eccentric as she is, but can she find the courage to bring herself the same happiness she has brought to so many others?
B000000OQF|4.0|I hadn't really heard much of G N'R's music before I got this CD. Just the major ones like Sweet Child and Nov. Rain, but I have to say this is one of the best albums I have ever heard. Axl Roses genius is apparent, although the question is raised; how on earth does he manage to sing that high? Maybe it's the tight trousers. If anyone has ever heard his normal speaking voice they will know exactly what I mean! Anyway, put that aside. Among the best songs on the album are \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"My Michelle\\". DEFINTELY WORTH YOUR MONEY!!!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden, one of the most influential bands in Metal history, I am sorry to say that I only own two Maiden albums (see my review of Powerslave).  However, both of the albums I own are well written and never have a dull moment.  This album takes another step towards progressive metal for Iron Maiden.  It also sees the return of Bruce and Adrian Smith.  Although some songs are slow there are intense ones to back the slow ones up.  Heres all the tracks at a glance:<br />1. The Wicker Man - One of my favorite Maiden songs of all time.  I found myself singing this song for days after first hearing it (Your Time Will Come, Your Time Will Coooome!)  A great opener. My Favorite on the CD. 5/5<BR>2. Ghost Of The Navigator - Another song that is very catchy and well written.  Starts off slow but then kicks in to high gear.  It seems that Maiden cannot do anything wrong. 5/5<BR>3. Brave New World - The title track of the CD,  very much progressive metal and less power metal.  However I like progressive (Check Out Dream Theatre). 5/5<BR>4. Blood Brothers - Another very progressive song.  The slow tracks show refinement in Maiden, it shows that they arn't one of those bands that only writes fast, intense songs. 5/5<BR>5. The Mercenary - The point the CD begins to pick up again.  Another heavy song, that is similar in style to &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;. 5/5<BR>6. Dream Of Mirrors - Slower, but a very good song lyrically speaking.  Really showcases Bruce's talent as a singer. 5/5<BR>7. The Fallen Angel - Another heavier song, I don't know how Maiden can jump from slow to heavy and vice-versa so fast, but they do very well. It shows true talent. 5/5<BR>8. The Nomad - You know you love this song. ;)  My second favorite on the CD, I listened to nothing but this song for two days straight. 5/5<BR>9. Out Of The Silent Planet - If I have my facts right this is one of the singles off the CD, another very progressive offering from Maiden.  A very good and well thought out song.  Thissong is never too heavy or too soft, it found that perfect balance in sound. 5/5<BR>10. The Thin Line Between Love And Hate - A rather heavy song for a closer,  but hey, I'm not complaining.  I probally would have switched this song with &quot;Blood Brothers,&quot; but still it works as a closer.  A good song no matter where it falls in the album. 5/5<br />Maiden can do no wrong, how they can be around for so long and get so little attention is amazing.  I hadn't really heard of them until about a year ago.  On the other end of the spectrum is the great Metallica who is one of the biggest names in the business.  In case some of you didn't know, Maiden is back in-studio, and is planning a tour, go check out their web-site.
B000088E6M|4.0|First Review.  4 Stars.  Great Album.<br />50 Cent's first Major Label record is very good.  His mushy rap's sound pretty great behind some of Dre's Amazing beats.  The album is solid all the way through.  50 Cent is a great rapper.  He doesnt stray much from what he knows, and thats his gangsta life and how he is more legit than everyone else.  Thats good though, because he IS living the life, he DID get shot, and thats awsome that he can use that to sell records! His voice is what makes his raps so effective, he mushes together so many of his words that it all sounds quite cool.  But, much like Eminem's last album it suffers on the hooks.  Some of the hooks are nice and catchy, but Alot of them are just plain annoying.  The guest apperances on the album are good.  Eminem's 2 verses are memerable.  G-Units contributions are pretty good.  Lloyd Banks is an interesting rapper from what i heard in his verse.  Nate's always a welcome addition to any album looking for a no-lose hook.<BR>Choice Cuts:<BR>In Da Club - A banger for sure, great hook.<BR>Don't Push Me - Em and Lloyd give good verses<BR>21 Questions - Nate sings the hook!<BR>PIMP - better than average hook.<BR>Back Down - Only dis cut, on Murder Inc and Ja Rule, only time we get back to the \\"How To Rob\\" entry<br />So, in conclusion:  Not A classic, but a 4 star for sure, as it will be in XXL and The Source (as long as Benzino keeps things real and doesnt screw him over because he runs with Em)  Best debut of 2003, and quite possibly going to be in the top 5 of 2003, quote me on that!

B000059HAI|5.0|Forget that other movie...<br />TORA! TORA! TORA! is the only authentic, historical recreation of the events of December 7, 1941. There's no need for a silly love triangle or Jon Voight behind a prosthetic mask. Just the facts and a fair account of events from both sides of the Pacific. Imagine that! A film that shows you both sides of the coin. I am continually amazed that this film was ever released in the United States, where we don't like to think of our enemies (or former enemies) as human beings with real concerns and conflicting motives. <br />Be forewarned though. Some of the dialogue in this film is quite awkward due to the need to tell a complex story within the framework of the film. You'll hear two sailors on deck casually talking about carrier movements as if they were reciting a highschool history essay.

0395925037|3.0|Here is more than a sick puppy,this is the devil incarnate,and i resent these other reviewers who comment on his style,or his sentence composition.This is not just another book,this is a book written by a man who was responsible for the systematic annihalation of 6 miillion jews along with about20 million russians and on and on,he was a horrific man,or rather beast,and this book details the foundations of what he wanted... the third reich,the pure Aryan race.Reading \\"Mein Kampf\\"and casually commenting on it as though it were jusy another book,is like reading Karl Marx \\"Das Kapital\\" and calling another book on economics.<br />  Joseph Brauner
B000088E6M|5.0|At first I was skeptical about 50's debut, I had heard \\"Wanksta\\"<BR> and \\"In Da Club\\" and production wise it doesn't get better, however lyrically it seemed like there was little to no substance rather than the usual sex, drugs and guns theme most Rappers have today. That's cool and I'm straight with it, but to spend 19 bucks on a CD, for me atleast it have to be deeper than that. I kept hearing how great it was, so I broke down and copped it. I put it in and the first track was already bumpin (althought the intro was useless), then the CD progressed and Eminem appeared and as it went on he told about his life, his struggles and his time in the hospital after being shot several times. All in all this album is solid and deserves 5 stars, and 5 mics in \\"The Source\\" no less, but Benzino will cheat him out of that. The only downsides were poorly laced vocals by Nate Dogg on \\"21 Questions\\" and the three bonus tracks have already been released for over a year atleast. In my opinion the best songs are \\"Many Men (Death Wish)\\", \\"Back Down\\" and \\"Patiently Waiting\\" featuring Eminem. This is definaley a must have for any Dr. Dre/Eminem production fans, and any hip hop fan for the most part. The first time you hear it, it's hot. <br />Other must haves:<br />Xzibit: Man Vs. Machine<BR>Trick Daddy: Thug Holiday<BR>2Pac: Better Dayz<BR>Jay-Z: Blueprint 2<BR>Busta Rhymes: It Aint Safe No More

0312305060|5.0|Cunningham's construction is so flawless and his writing so exquisite that the Pulitzer seemed like a forgone conclusion. The weaving of past and present, story and mood, desolation and the joy of choosing life are all part of what I think is a masterpiece.  <br />An afterthought - I saw the movie expecting to be disappointed and instead was left speechless with its beauty and depth. Cunningham must be thrilled.
1577311523|5.0|I read a review that said a lot of readers hate this book.  Hate seems a little strong.  Who hates it?  Minds hate the idea of being called a tool.

B000067CPX|5.0|The Chili Peppers are in the prime of their career.  How could they top such a brilliant album as Californication?  With this album.  You can debate all you want about which is the better album, along with \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" but all 3 are essential.  The Chili Peppers have really hit their stride and all the musicians play off eachother so well.  Anthony Kiedis' singing has improved immensely from the earlier Chili Peppers, and the band's revolving door of guitarists has finally stopped with the great and underrated John Frusciante.  Of course you can't leave out Flea, one of the best bassists in rock.  I can't wait to hear what the Peppers come out with next, and everyone should have this album.  Give it a few listens, the songs just grow on you.  This is a fantastic album, one of the best of the year.

Akin to the previous installment, the reader is immediately transported into Martin's eerily realistic world and is captivated until the end (after which you purchase a Storm of Swords).  This book is truly a masterpiece, as it extrapolates on what made A Game of Thrones so good.  A must read for everyone.
6301971558|4.0|Mogambo was essentially a convoluted love story set against the glorious and picturesque backdrop of the African savannah.<br />A somewhat aged looking Clark Gable in his typical macho style played Victor Marswell a safari leader and procurer of wild animals for zoos and circuses based in Kenya.  Arriving at Gable's complex unexpectedly in search of a recently departed maharajah is the raven haired beauty Ava Gardner.  Gardner, a wordly chorus girl from New York and Gable imediately hit it off.  Things are proceeding swimmingly until the arrival of the next safari clients, the Nordleys.  Professor Nordley played by Donald Sinden is an anthropologist interested in gorillas.  His wife the prim, proper and lovely Grace Kelly rues her loveless marriage and is smitten with Gable.  Gable returns her advances and soon we are in the midst of a love quadrangle.<br />The heat is turned up as the group goes on safari to gorilla country and passions percolate.  All the while they are fleeing from hostile natives, chasing a plethora of wild and exotic animals and travelling through some of the most scenic country imaginable.<br />The interplay among the main characters as well as the supporting cast was very amusing.  The settings and cinematography was first rate.  The satisfying conclusion ties up the plot into a neat little package.

0871137380|3.0|I read this book after watching the movie, and discovered how much the movie didn't cover. The most pointed incident was when U.S. gunships killed about 54 Somali leaders (estimates vary) in Operation Michigan several months before the ill-fated raid when they were meeting in what was described by some as a massacre. This episode didn't make it into the movie.<br />Overall, the author did a very good job. He was able to painstakingly obtain viewpoints of many participants, including some from the Somali side. I would have liked to see him expand on the Somali viewpoints, because they were too short and incomplete. The book was long enough for the author to do that.<br />However, the author erred by agreeing with many of the Rangers and Delta operatives that the Clinton Administration did a half assed job by not providing more fire support or returning to finish the job of capturing Aidid. They seemed to forget that before the battle commenced, the Rangers and Delta were so confident of completing their mission within two hours, and without bloodshed (at least on their part), that they didn't bother to pack their night vision goggles or fill up their water canteens. As it turned out, the Rangers and Delta lost decades of experience from their ranks courtesy of their 18-19 KIA.  Moral: even if you're good, and the Rangers and Delta were among the best soldiers in any nation's ranks, don't act cocky and then turn around and blame others for your failures.<br />Mogadishu was no American victory, not even a Pyrrhic one (as claimed by the author). It was an example of what happens when your intended beneficiaries don't see you as the benefactor. Somalia's famine was subsiding, and Aidid wasn't the only one responsible for the starvation and civil war. Moreover, as a result of Operation Michigan, even rival clans showed up to battle the Americans during the raid. That's another thing that didn't make it into the movie.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|This is one of the best movies of 2002 and one of my new all time favorites. I was a Hugh Grant fan after Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, but he is at his funniest (and cutest) in About a Boy. The story centers around the shallow and self centered Will (Grant) who begrudgingly forms a friendship with a teenage outcast named Marcus. Other reviewers have covered the storyline pretty well, so I will just say that this movie is hilarious. It is a must see, funny, smart and endearing with a great ending that wraps everything up neatly. You can't go wrong with this movie.
B00000AFFF|1.0|In a career that outshines all the pretenders our prolific Elvis has had more than his share of clunkers. Before you is the bottom of the barrel. His ability to stretch and defy categories is admirable. Unfortunately too often he's way past his limits! Truly horrible!
0553328255|5.0|I read some of these stories as I wanted to see if Jeremy Brett's interpretation of Holmes was accurately acted. Someone said it wasn't, because he is too insensitive. I think his interpretation is acurately acted. Holmes is an intellect and is only caring if he is really deeply moved - or as a ploy. He is not by nature one to show what a caring person he is; but he is - and sometimes will show that if he thinks it really will make some difference. He is obsessed with thoughts, facts, data, music, and getting inside someone's skin.  The showing of feeling is not big on his list, however the passion for his science is clear. So Brett being insensitive, on most occassions, jive's well with Doyle's Sherlock. Watson was, of course, the more feeling one.<br />I read somewhere that Doyle wrote most of these stories while at the track, betting on horses. It is believable. Most of the stories read like a sketch.
6303012140|4.0|This action-flick is an excellent satire, spoofing such themes as \\"political correctness\\", \\"moral correctness\\", & extremes in philosphy & thought, within the context of a live-action \\"comic-book\\"-type of story.  Of cousre, it also has exciting, well-paced action sequences & fun (because they're so dopey) one-liners.  The producers even manage to pull off obvious plugs for their sponsors in a funny, yet (ironically) plausible way.  (Taco Bell is the ONLY restaurant left in \\"the future!\\"  I also wonder if Armor Hot-Dogs & frozen vegetable & dog-food companies also sponsored, since their jingles are the \\"hit songs\\" in the future.  Well, popular \\"oldies\\" at least, according to Sandra Bullock's character.)<br />Two reasons why I didn't give it 5 Stars:<br />First, Stallone's daughter is mentioned yet that matter is never resolved.  (Why mention something if you won't follow through?)<br />Second, since this is done in a \\"comic-book\\" style, as a personal preference, I would have liked to have seen Snipes' death left somewhat \\"ambiguous\\" (so he can come back & plague Stallone in a sequel!)  That's just a preference, though.<br />Of interest:  The whole \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" frozen-cryogenic plot device used here is almost repeated in exact detail in \\"Austin Powers.\\"<br />Listen for Bullock's reference to Jackie Chan's movies BEFORE he hit it big in the U.S. & is it just me, or does anybody else notice that Wesely Snipes' \\"Simon Phoenix\\" character resembles the Joker?

Hopefully Trevor Horn's brilliant formula in working with these girls produces more innovations such as this album in the future.

The CD sounds hard then it weakens, then gets hard again, and has a weak end.

B00007KQA3|5.0|I have followed the career of John Hurt (one reviewer erroneously credited the lead performance in this film to William Hurt) since his brilliant performance as Quentin Crisp in THE NAKED CIVIL SERVANT.  His turn as Winston Smith in NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR ranks as one of his two all-time best film roles.  As Winston Smith, he fully communicates both the necessity and the futility of maintaining a struggle against a dehumanizing government that spends all of its resources to monitor its subjects in every aspect of their lives.  Truly brilliant work.<br />Richard Burton, in his last screen role, is perfectly cast as O'Brien, a high-ranking Inner Party member.  It is chilling to watch this unaffected performance, which, in my opinion, ranks as one of his all-time best, as well.<br />Now for the story.  Written in 1948 (last two digits of the year transposed for the title) and published the following year, NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR has a disturbingly realistic resonance to it.  There are obvious parallels between INGSOC (the ruling party) and both the German Nazi Party and the Soviet Communists, both of which were fresh in the minds of Europeans in the late 1940s.  Also, the fact that all of the action takes place in the aftermath of atomic war (again, a seemingly very real possibility at the time the book was written) lends a sense of negative prophecy to the whole affair.  In this post-war society, the individual has no value.  In fact, anything that might contribute to one's individuality is criminalized and investigated by the Gestapo-like Thought Police.  This includes private reflection and interpersonal relationships.  And that sets the stage for the rest of the story to unfold.<br />Early on, Winston meets a beautiful young woman named Julia.  Try as he might, he cannot resist her.  After all, he is only human--a fact which will ultimately be his undoing.  Julia, on the other hand, revels in her sexuality and feelings of love.  As time passes, they develop a relationship that seems to be based not only on sex, but genuine love and affection.  It is disturbingly touching when Winston, while holding Julia, asks if there were ever a time when what they were doing seemed ordinary.  <br />Of course, they are eventually caught and arrested.  Winston is taken to the Ministry of Love to be interrogated and tortured by O'Brien.  Richard Burton's portrayal is profoundly unsettling because he plays it without even a hint of irony or emotion of any kind.  In fact, the only evidence of compassion in his character comes when he pats Winston on the shoulder and tells him not to give up hope because \\". . .in the end, we shall shoot you.\\"<br />There is no Hollywood happy ending in this film.  No reason for hope, even.  The final words of dialog (spoken as thought in a voice-over) are truly heartbreaking.<br />As others have mentioned, the set decoration and photography are brilliant and lend to the realism of the film.  And the soundtrack by Eurythmics does not seem at all out of place.  In fact, the song \\"Julia\\", played over the end credits is especially beautiful.<br />I recommend this film very highly.  It is relentlessly depressing, to be sure.  But it is also quite rewarding on many levels.  Give this one a chance.

It is so elaborate that you find something that you missed every time you watch it!  The costumes and the music are fun and make it a film you can watch over and over.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This has to be, in my opinion, one of the best accounts of WWII ever produced. With modern computer technology and filming, this series is like an 8-hour Saving Private Ryan, only better. <br />The video quality is the reason I bought a DVD player. It is so crisp and clean, you'd swear you're right there in the trenches with the 506th. The audio is probably the best 5.1 sound of any DVD I own. They made use of the surrounds constantly throughout the series.  From rain and thunder to gunfire and mortars, they sounded spectacular.<br />The ten episodes are extremely well written and acted. Each episode centers on a specific character and event in the timeline of the war. It follows E (Easy) Company, 506th Infantry, 101st Airborne as they train, parachute into, and fight their way through Europe on the way to their ultimate objective: Nazi Germany.<br />The most compelling episode for me was 'Bastogne'. This episode follows a 506th medic as he scurries around from foxhole to foxhole trying to gather meager supplies, as well as treat the wounded. The episode purposely has a very frantic pace as he goes from man to man, trying to help where he can. The medic expends an immense amount of energy to try and save a life, only to see it snatched away. This symbolism is further demonstrated when the medic goes to a field hospital and meets a young French nurse.  The two of them build a repoire, and the seeds of love seem to be sewn. After spending time on the line, he returns to find that the hospital has been hit by artillery fire, and the nurse is dead. The nurse always wore a cloth over her hair to keep it in place, so the young medic takes it from her, a remembrance of sorts. He makes his way back to the line, only to find a man whose hand is cut badly. The medic, being out of bandages, reluctantly uses the only thing he had to remember the nurse by, the piece of fabric. Another instance of the symbolism used in this episode.<br />I'd have to say that young people today should watch this with an open mind, and understand that this isn't Hollywood. This is fact. History. Everything in the episodes truly happened, and many of the men who did these things are still alive today. I think the younger generation hasn't had the respect for their elders, but maybe a viewing of this series could help to change that.
B000066F6H|5.0|for those of you tired of the blink-182s good charlottes etc. buy this cd right now, 100% pure punk rock. you wanna now how good it is. It took me 3 times of listening to the cd to understaid what howlin' pelle alvquist was saying and once i understood i liked it even more. The strokes, the vines, the white stripes are all good bands but they arn't gonna be the ones to bring garage rock back. LIke nirvana before them I will place my money on the hives.
B00004W50Z|5.0|The conventional wisdom is right:  Pound for pound, \\"Big Pink\\" and \\"The Band\\" are more complete successes for this group, and I love them both. But I love \\"Stage Fright\\" more.  It is the album where this group drops its masks and speaks directly to the audience about themselves and each other.<br />The Band is really two duos:  Helm and Danko, who are usually paired as singers on some of the group's best-loved material, and Robertson and Manuel, who are engaged in a sort of musical and spiritual dialogue that often forms much of the depth, richness and mystery of this group.  That dialogue is the dominant theme of \\"Stage Fright\\" in its many evocations of the theme of self-destructiveness, especially the self-destructiveness of a great artist.<br />My theory is, Richard Manuel was the artistic soul of the The Band. He was their best singer, by far. His \\"feel\\" approach to playing the many instruments he played, especially piano, gave the Band a funky, soulful \\"bottom\\" that contrasted with the highly intellectual approaches of both Robertson and Hudson.  Manuel was responsible, on their first three albums, for some of their very best songs as writer or co-writer:  \\"Tears of Rage,\\" \\"In A Station,\\" \\"Lonesome Suzie,\\" \\"Whispering Pines,\\" \\"Across the Great Divide,\\" and, on this album, \\"Sleeping\\" and \\"The Shape I'm In\\" were at least partly his.  But...Richard Manuel was not a particularly responsible person.  He was, in fact a drunk, and an unmotivated writer.  He was a sadly vulnerable man, for whom, as Robertson writes in \\"Sleeping,\\" \\"the world was too sore to live in.\\"  In some ways, being in the Band destroyed him. At the same time, it created a place for him to hide.<br />Robertson, ever the brilliant control freak, clearly admired and loved Richard Manuel, and was also exasperated with him.  Robertson was basically in charge of the business of The Band, and also the artistic direction of The Band as its most prolific songwriter.  He wanted Manuel to play a bigger role, but eventually saw that he couldn't, or wouldn't.  And so, according to my theory, he wrote songs to reach him when nothing else would work.<br />It is no accident that the leadoff track is \\"Strawberry Wine,\\" a fun but desperate track in which Levon Helm sings (brilliantly) the part of a drunk who wants to be left alone to \\"feel good all the time.\\"  This is followed by the album's first masterpiece, \\"Sleeping,\\" which at first seems to be about life as a musician on the road, but expands into a poem about isolation and hiding.  This song, one of Manuel's most treasured performances, almost seems like a dialogue between the two men, with Robertson acknowledging that perhaps life on the road, in which \\"to be called by noon, is to be called too soon\\" is part of the drill if you're performing before crowds of people \\"searching\\" for something special every night.  Maybe, Robertson seems to suggest, that's why Richard is such a juicer; it's the road's fault.  But then, the song seems to say, that's not why.  He would be living this way on his own, even if he weren't part of The Band.  Maybe the rock and roll lifestyle isn't killing him; maybe it's really keeping him alive.<br />I won't go through every song, but themes of drunkenness, fear, isolation, and hiding take some form in almost every remaining track.  Even the two songs that have the \\"old-timey\\" historic and mythic resonances of their prior albums, \\"Daniel and the Sacred Harp\\" and \\"W.S. Walcott's Medicine Show\\" are tales full of personal symbolism.  Richard Manuel plays the role of the music-mad Daniel who sells his soul to play the sacred harp, but Levon Helm sings the part of the narrator who becomes horrified at Daniel's fate: \\"When he looked to the ground, he noticed no shadow did he cast.\\"  Again, this is Robertson assessing the cost of the music career to himself and his bandmates, especially Manuel.  \\"Walcott\\" reinterprets the rock and roll touring lifestyle as a 19th century medicine show, in which alcohol-laced snake oil and other mind altering substances are purveyed to the dazzled crowds as the keys to health--which, back in '69 is about right.  Manuel just happened to be the guy who kept sampling the stock.<br />After this album, Manuel had many more wonderful performances ahead of him, but he wrote no more songs.  From the Last Waltz and everything one can read about the Band, he appears to have not taken the bootstrap advice of the singer in \\"Stage Fright\\" who \\"when he gets to the end, wants to start all over again.\\"  He went on, and kept singing because that kept him afloat long enough to get the next drink. He began the long, slow retreat that to the people who knew him best and admired his talent was probably an agonizing spectacle to watch.  I see \\"Stage Fright\\" as a collection of songs in which Robbie Robertson alternately rages at, laughs at, cries about, and tries to save, Richard Manuel--and in which Richard Manuel finally escapes Robertson's tender mercies.  And, as great as the first two Band albums might have been, they don't have this kind of intimacy and depth.  This album is hardly the coda or afterthought to a classic period--it may be its culmination.l-laced snake oil and other mind altering substances are purveyed to the dazzled crowds as the keys to health--which, back in '69 is about right.

All i have to say for each of the bullets 50 got hit with you can tell in his rymes that heaint scared to shoot each one back with a bigger gun.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I really love this album, because of the daring lyrics and the interesting dynamic between Julia and Lena. They have different style voices, contrary to popular beleif. Julia has a much higher pitch, while Lena usually does the lower stuff/she has a more breathy voice. <br />All in all, if you like the following:<BR>Soaring, high-pitched tennors<BR>Techno beats<BR>Songs ranging from ballads to techrock<BR>Russian lesbians<br />then this c.d. is for you. (By the way, who the hell cares if they're really going out or not? Does it effect the actual music any?)
B00005YXZH|4.0|If you like Summerteeth you'll probably like this album, if you liked A.M. or Being There then you probably won't be diggin this.  If you like all of Wilco's albums then here you, more Wilco.  I personally wish that Wilco would go back to their Alt-Country roots like in A.M. and Being There but I guess they felt a need to change.
0066214122|3.0|Although it was an interesting concept, the way the book was put together just isn't as successful as classics like &quot;Andromeda Strain,&quot; or &quot;Airframe.&quot;  The characters are real enough, but I'm not sure I totally buy the whole premise scientificall enough to think it possible, and that's probably the biggest flaw.  His other books are ficition that seem to be based in reasonable science (and his research on &quot;Timeline&quot; made that worth overlooking some of the issues presented by time travel).  This one just seemed too far fetched compared to a lot of what he's done.

B000084T18|5.0|great cd. the best cd i have bought in  a while
B000002MG1|5.0|This CD was R.E.M.'s 11th album, released approximately 10 years after the release of their first album in 1982. This album is generally mellow, but contains so much variety and so many messages that one review can cover only a little.<br />The CD kicks off with 'Drive'. The lyrics are surreal. The music surrounding the lyrics uses an accordion sound with violins and heavy backing bass and lots of echo to create a molasses sound that deliberately intends to suck you under. A song that has to be heard to be appreciated.<br />I read the lyrics to 'Try not to Breathe' and my eyes water. This song is a song about suicide. However, the suicide is not for some pointless reason. The singer is dying and wants his loved one to remember him as he was, not how he became at the end. I can't talk about this song; it's sad and beautiful and deals with a difficult subject.<br />'The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight' relieves the tension of the previous song with faster and less mellow music. The song appears shallow in its lyrics, and yet, I suspect that when the song was written there was a deep, hidden meaning. Michael Stipe has never explained the song in any detail that I can find, and there seems to be a lot of explanations as to the meaning.<br />The next song is my favorite from this CD. 'Everybody Hurts' has a great video to go with it. This song is perhaps the best way I've ever heard anyone explain that we all have pains and we all have problems, and because WE all do, we are not alone, even though we think we are. This song is art and beauty, and is one of the reasons that R.E.M. is hailed as such a great, often underappreciated group. When the song kicks over from mellow guitars and violins into guitars and drums, you just feel, something, sympathy, good, not alone, any more.<br />The next track is 'New Orleans Instrumental No. 1'; pretty song; an interlude; simple, mellow. 'Sweetness Follows' comes next. If you get the CD, find the lyrics so you can read along. While this song initially appears to be about burying parents, there is more to it than that.<br />After listening to 'Monty Got a Raw Deal', it's easy to understand why R.E.M. has always been considered a group that treats their music as art.<br />'Ignoreland' is a political song. While I've heard someone else say that this song deals with Republicanism, I think it deals more broadly with government in general. The song says clearly that those in power have come to power by taking advantage of the adversity, whether in foreign affairs or domestic policy. The message I got was that perhaps people who aim to run a country should be focused on how they will build a future versus the issue of the moment.<br />'Star Me Kitten' is a euphemism for the actual lyrics of the song. This song is a very mellow, slow song. A song of love, lust, possession and relationships perhaps not understood; another song with a lot of art in it. 'Man on the Moon' is an excellent tribute to Andy Kaufmann; a simple song, apparently pop, but not really.<br />When you look at a painting that is intended to convey more than just what the picture shows, such as 'The Night Watchman' by Rembrandt, how do we define the art behind the picture? I can not. So too with much of this music. 'Nightswimming' is musical art. I can't explain why, but I know it when I see it. Perhaps it is because of the images painted that have less to do with the words than the impression. The last song on this CD, 'Find the River', caps the artistry of this CD. The beauty of this music and the lyrics are so seldom achieved by any artist. When another group tries to do what R.E.M. has done on this album, they usually fail, or it sounds contrived. Not so here.<br />There are many musical artists that have periodically risen above their music to create beauty and true musical art. Typically it's one song, such as 'Forever Autumn' by Justin Hayward or 'Nights in White Satin' by the Moody Blues. In 'Automatic for the People' R.E.M. managed to create an entire CD where so many of the songs achieve the level of art and beauty that make this CD a work of musical art. Enjoy, not too seriously, but not too lightly either'o create an entire CD where so many of the songs achieve the level of art and beauty that make this CD a work of musical art.

0736041850|5.0|This book is superb for detailing the musculature involved in many of the best muscle building lifts.  The part that sets it apart, and I think is worth ten times the money, is where the author describes the importance of appropriate spinal posture for squats, deadlifts, rows, etc.<br />Pay attention to the discussion on spinal alignment and the hazards of the rounded back, slipped / bulging discs.  I am 44 years old and have been steadily increasing the weight I lift in the above mentioned exercises all without a twinge of back pain.  I use a mirror in front and one to the side to always ensure proper spinal alignment.  My back hasn't felt this good in years.
B000002J09|3.0|Ok,here it is: Zep IV is good, but not great. Now I'm sure there's a group of people who want to hang me for that. <BR> Come on, this is a very over rated album. This is how I see it:<br />~black dog: The lyrics are stupid, nothing brillant about it. 3/5<BR>~rock n roll: dull, not any big deal. I really dislike it. 2/5<BR>~battle of evermore: Well, it's different; but it's not good. I'm not really sure what it's suppose to be about. 2/5<BR>~stairway to heaven: yeah, it's good, but it's Not the best song ever. 4/5<BR>~Misty mountain hop: kinda catchy-boppy, interesting lyrics. I'll assume it was drug influenced. 4/5<BR>~Four sticks: Ah yes, the prime example of why this 8-song album can't be the best ever. This song is terrible. Pretty damn crappy. I give it a generous 1/5 <BR>~Going to California: Very good. It's kinda light but still one of my favorites. 5/5<BR>~When the levee breaks: Probably the best song here. Very good blues song. 5/5<BR> Overall its a good album, with both high's and low's. Still worth buying, but don't exprect an unparalleled masterpiece. I thought Physical graffiti, houses of the holy, & zep II are all superior.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have listened to OK Computer a million times its seems, and every time, it just gets better and better. Every track on the cd is amazing and has it's own special feel to it. Some of the parts to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; blow me away, they are so well thought out and developed. &quot;Let Down&quot; is definately my favorite song on the cd. The lyrics and the way Thom sings it is amazing. The guitars and the bass going on and the change of drums in the middle make the song build, and it is truly wonderful. Buy this cd, it is unlike anything you've ever heard. If you are looking for something different, get it
B000068VHQ|5.0|It was the video to \\"Zombie\\" that first made me notice The Cranberries. At first I didn't care for the song, but as it grew on me, I began to be pulled into the emotion and story behind the song. Finally I paid attention in detail, and I was hooked. While The Cranberries first album was full of love and angst, this album is darker and about violence.<br />The first song, \\"Ode to My Family\\", is very much in the style of the songs from \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\\" As full of angst as the former album, but this time about her feelings about her family. The sentiment is positive, but the tone of the song feels grunge.<br />\\"I Can't Be with You\\" has a faster pace, and harkens back to the angst-filled love and relationship songs of their previous CD. The tone of the song is ironic, because it sounds as though it wants to be happy, but is a song of separation and frustrated love.<br />The next song has simple lyrics, and I am unsure of the subject matter. \\"21\\" may be about turning 21 and being on your own, and being able to do what you want to do. The song is mellow with Dolores' beautiful voice.<br />The outstanding song \\"Zombie\\" follows. Containing grunge elements, this song has a heavy beat that crescendos with the chorus, punctuating the anger regarding the \\"Troubles\\" in Ireland. The mental images and the video are graphic and sobering, visual art successfully marrying musical art. A beautifully performed song that is political and sad and angry and despairing all at once. Stop the violence she sings.<br />The next song is another angst-filled song. \\"Empty\\" could apply to a lot of situations, but given The Cranberries penchant for relationship songs, my guess is that it is about someone who either didn't notice someone who wanted to be noticed, or didn't get the relationship they wanted, leaving the singer \\"Empty\\".<br />\\"Everything I Said\\" is another relationship song. Slow and sad, touching. Trying to reach out to someone who just isn't paying attention.<br />I sometimes find it emotionally difficult to listen to \\"The Icicle Melts\\", because the subject is about the death of a child, and the sadness of the mother. It is difficult for a man or a woman who has not carried a child for nine months to understand the special bond that exists between the child and its mother. It is sad when any child dies, but for the mother it will always be worse. This song is very serious, and incredibly sad. You must be in the right kind of mood for this one.<br />\\"Disappointment\\" is about ending a relationship for a serious error on his part. While these songs seem like one sad song after another, they are so beautiful and mellow that sometimes they just really fit my mood. \\"Ridiculous Thoughts\\" is another song along the same lines. \\"Dreaming My Dreams\\" could have been happy, but the song is about a glass half empty instead of half full, very slow, very mellow, and very full of bass.<br />\\"Yeat's Grave\\" has a little quicker beat. I must admit that the subject matter of this one is beyond me. I suspect that it relates to Irish history or folklore, of which I have only marginal knowledge. It is very pretty though.<br />As you might have suspected, \\"Daffodil Lament\\" is another relationship song, about her thoughts of breaking up and not being able to stay with him. Dolores gets to exercise the full range of her voice on this, punctuating the song sharply in several places.<br />The last song, \\"No Need to Argue\\", is a kind of coda. The reason there's no need to argue is because the relationship is over. The song starts with an organ sound, very very slow. This song would seem to tie all the relationship songs on this CD together to form a vague concept. If you assume that songs like \\"Zombie\\" and \\"Yeat's Grave\\" form a background to the relationship, then perhaps this is a concept album, the story of the trials and tribulations of a relationship that ends with the last song.<br />Musically, lyrically and vocally beautiful, this CD is abit more polished than \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\\" If you like mellow music, especially like Enya or Lorena McKinnitt, you might find this CD to your taste. Just be prepared for the angst.CD is a bit more polished than \\"Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We?\\" If you like mellow music, especially like Enya or Lorena McKinnitt, you might find this CD to your taste.

B00006IU73|5.0|Every now and then, I find it a good idea to buy something I've never heard before. I like being able to listen to an album not knowing exactly what I'm in for, with a minimum of expectations and preconceived notions. With this philosophy in mind, I picked up \\"In Absentia\\" based solely on the raves of some reviewers I respect on this site. And I'm happy to say my decision was vindicated and then some. \\"In Absentia\\" is a towering achievement, displaying stunning levels of creativity, musicianship, and diversity.<br />What hooked me first on listening to this album was the atmosphere Porcupine Tree can create, seemingly with a minimal effort. Every song here, even the instrumentals, is packed with emotion and virtuosity. Steven Wilson is one of the best vocalists in rock right now, not so much because he's gifted with a great voice as because he knows how to use it. His vocals are typically laid back, even trippy, but they also have a dark edge that reminds me a lot of Pink Floyd's Roger Waters. Steven's vocals are a perfect match for the haunting, ethereal tunes that predominate on \\"In Absentia.\\" \\"Blackest Eyes,\\" \\"Trains,\\" \\"Lips of Ashes,\\" and \\"Heartattack in a Layby,\\" among others, are some of the most exquisite songs ever put to disc. With insinuating melodies, lush instrumentation, and the remarkably dexterous drumming of Gavin Harrison, Porcupine Tree craft songs that masterfully blend intricacy, atmosphere, and power.<br />And there's more. A lot more. Although the guitar work on \\"In Absentia\\" is largely acoustic, there are plenty of electric guitars sprinkled throughout as well. And when the band does go electric the result is, well, electrifying. \\"Blackest Eyes,\\" \\"Trains,\\" and \\"The Creator has a Mastertape\\" feature thrashy riffing that would do most metal bands proud. \\"Lips of Ashes\\" deftly mixes electric and acoustic guitars, and the solo in \\"The Sound of Muzak\\" is both understated and thrilling at the same time. \\"Wedding Nails,\\" with its explosive guitar pyrotechnics and thumping rhythm section, is a rarity among instrumentals: it manages to keep me captivated from beginning to end, despite clocking in at more than six minutes.<br />It's the stunning epic \\"Gravity Eyelids,\\" however, that I find to be the album's high point. With liberal use of synth and piano, Steven's mesmerizing vocals, and hair-raising electric guitars, the song is a masterpiece of ambience, easily among last year's best. Another choice cut, \\"Heartattack in a Layby,\\" creates a melancholy mood with little more than acoustic guitar, piano, and vocals. \\"Prodigal,\\" meanwhile, is so utterly awe-inspiring I can't even really describe it here. It's not heavy, or especially complex, but it contains more evocative power in its five and a half minutes than some bands' entire careers. That's what really impresses me about \\"In Absentia,\\" that elusive quality that I'll call evocative power for lack of a better term. There's something about the arrangements, the melodies, and the vocals on here that makes me feel something that no other album has, and this is coming from someone with about four hundred CD's in his collection. The feeling this album gives me is really something that's impossible to put into words, but maybe that's what's so great about it.<br />By the time this album ended with the moving piano ballad \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth,\\" I was a full-fledged convert to Porcupine Tree. And given the fact that I typically gravitate towards much heavier music, that's no small achievement. Really, though, anyone, regardless of taste, should be able to appreciate the brilliance that is \\"In Absentia.\\" It's rare for music as accessible as this to have so much depth and passion, but Porcupine Tree are definitely a rare band, and this is easily one of the best albums of the millenium so far.otechnics and thumping rhythm section, is a rarity among instrumentals: it manages to keep me captivated from beginning to end, despite clocking in at more than six minutes. <br />It's the stunning epic \\"Gravity Eyelids,\\" however, that I find to be the album's high point.

B000065U1N|4.0|In general, I enjoyed this movie. The camera work during battles really made you feel like you took part in the action. Not a super &quot;gore fest&quot; like some war era movies, but didn't sugar coat the realities of armed conflict. The acting was very good and I could believe the internal battle going on in Josh Hartnett's head. <BR>My biggest problem: Except for very few war/military movies, it's so hard to pin a name to a character when every body looks about the same. I think that's why I liked 'Full Metal Jacket' while critics scoffed. In FMJ, you met the actors before they became the Marines 'Killing Machines' and that helped define them as individuals. <br />PS, the stats relayed at the end of the feature in no way represent the true number of Somalian casualities.
0452282152|5.0|Indulging! This a great book for both men and women. It covers the arts, history, and a bit of romance. Chevalier did a brilliant job at really illustrating life in Holland in the 1600's both in a mental and physical sense. Coming from a Dutch heritage, I can vow that she (Chevalier) really did her research. Chevalier's portrayal of Vermeer seems to harmonize with his artwork. Though the book is fiction, I feel that it is not too far fetched about what Vermeer and his family life was like. I won't ruin the suspense for you and spill out all the details, but the &quot;girl&quot; with the pearl earring is also worth getting to know. You will cry for her, sympathize for her, cheer for her, and you will even sometimes be a little annoyed with her. If you want a fun and easy read, this book is an excellent choice. I have read many books and this one really stands out. I also know quite of few people who have also read this book and loved it.

It's unfortunate that \\"wanksta\\" is the first single, because it is probably the worst song on the CD, but it's also probably one of the only tracks that would be aloud on the radio! Peace
0684135051|5.0|I bought this book at a used book store in Oregon 6 yrs. ago for [$].  I thinks it's the original copyright of 1971.  Anyway, I had been knitting off and on for years but could not find the right book for me to explain the basics in just simple terms without a lot of \\"knitters\\" terminology that can be confusing unless you are a little more advanced.  I laughed at and loved the way the author describes the frustrations of knitting.  I didn't feel like I was the only one who ever had to start the same project over 6 times just to get the gauge or ribbing correct.  If you want a book that teaches knitting like you hoped a \\"grandma\\" would if she was sitting by your side - this is the book for you.  Enjoy!

B000069AUI|5.0|I love this band. I love listening to them when it is freezing out, and 6:30 in the morning, and I am in my car... and I loved listening to them when it was an unseasonably hot September day and I was sweating, wind blowing in my face, again in my car. The lyrics are great, and Chris is faboo. No wonder Gwyneth got him.  She's lucky; he is a true poet and rips out your heart when he wishes. How does he do this? By sharing his own feelings, rawly and exquisitely.<br />So why the car imagery? For me, it is the only place I can be alone and have some peace and some control.  When this rare chance to be quiet and alone with my thoughts happens, I choose both Coldplay CDs to keep me company.  And they do a great job of it, too.

The stars are all fabulous; Dick Van Dyke is great as the off-beat single Pa (Caractucus Potts) to two gorgeous kiddies; Sally Ann Howes is the lovely fairytale-pretty female lead, Truly Scrumptious. They cause riots in sweetie factories, spend sunny afternoons on yummy beaches and then they all go on a fantasy adventure to an olde-worlde foreign land with a ruthless Baron and Baroness governing.<BR>This film is all about daydreaming, candies, and all that's pretty and magical in life! Total whimsical escapism....
B0000639IJ|4.0|Why you may ask a movie about ALI?After all,you can still view most of his championship fights on vido.The reason is that it gives WILL SMITH a good part to play.I didn't really appreciate the opening montage and this crosscutting with a SAM COOKE concert.I think that they wanted to show the emergence of black people in the sixties.I especially liked parts of the film like those funny press conferences in which ALI demonstrates his acting ability.If you actually accept what the script wants you to beleive,ALI is basically a womanizer.The religious aspect and the army jinks could not be tossed apart, simply because they really were an important issue at the time.Overall,this film should not mesmerize you to a degry of greatness.Still,WILL SMITH certainly trows knockout acting punches and makes it worth viewing.Honours should also go to JON VOIGHT and the creator of the HOWARD COSSELL facial mask.
B00007E8NX|5.0|I think \\"Steal This Album\\" is their best album.  I do not generally agree with their messages, but Serg's vocals are at their best and the music is just as good as before.  If you like System of a Down, you will like this more.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Hot Damn, its 2 of my favorite bands fused as one. Tom Morello is a guitar god, coupled with Chris Cornell's wailings makes for a great fresh sound for the radiowaves. Cornell, with a range nearly as versatile as Morello's wa-wa pedal, is as solid on vocals as his Soundgarden days. This is a great album. Buy it.
630542845X|3.0|I liked Powder.  It's not a great movie--there are a few too many problems for that accolade.  But it is creative in a number of respects, and certainly worth seeing.  I must admit, however, that having recently seen that creepy interview with Michael Jackson, he might have seen this movie too, and his skin bleachings may well be proof.<br />First, the flaws.  There's a gnawing and out-of-left-field piece of this film that is suggestive that one of the filmmaker's points was to glorify the \\"odd, smart, and sensitive, yet persecuted homosexual\\" stereotype.  Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the scene in which Powder stares at a muscular jock in a boy's locker room.  It was a scene that felt entirely out of place in the movie--an add-on that seemed to be intended as an \\"in your face\\" revelation that Powder represents gays.  The camera also seem to linger a bit too long on the male characters, with the female characters left oddly de-sexualized.  What was irritating about this apparent subtext was that it took away and trivialized what seemed to be a broader message, the message that human beings might well kill someone meant to save them.  In this regard, the more powerful metaphor for Powder seemed to be a Jesus story--with an odd, highly empathic, and powerful \\"savior\\" born under strange circumstances and ultimately persecuted by those he tried to help.  For me, it work on that level.<br />A number of critics pointed out that the story was derivative.  I agree.  But I thought it took various pieces from other stories and movies and wove them together in a compelling new way.  For me, Powder also worked as a kind of comic book tale of how a superhero might come to pass, and what a person with such powers might be like in real life.  (It was more successful in humanizing a superhero than Unbreakable, in my opinion.)<br />The casting could have been better, though.  Jeff Goldblum was awful.  Apart from his role in the Fly, where I thought he was perfect, he hasn't been able to pull together a decent performance.  I hope Igby Goes Down, which I have yet to see, is redemptive for him.  I've never liked Mary Steenbergen, and found nothing admirable in her performance.  I thought the young actor who played Powder was solid in the role.<br />This is a pleasant entertainment with quite a bit to offer the viewer.  It isn't everyone's cup of tea, but I think it merits three stars., he hasn't been able to pull together a decent performance.

B00007BH5C|5.0|I couldn't be happier with this CD.  The music is beautiful and enchanting, and is great for relaxing, doing homework, or taking a car trip.  it's great for anything, actually.<BR>If you loved the music that you heard in the movie, this is a MUST have!
0743435729|5.0|Let me reiterate: I despise science fiction. The authors can make up any dilemma they wish for the characters, and make up any solution, and there's nothing to keep them honest. Also the writing tends to be mediocre at best, full of silly metaphors that mean nothing to you and much wooden prose. And I dislike pastiches, especially when I enjoyed the basis for the imitation. So this is strange. I like Honor Harrington, and the series of books about her, which imitate my old favorite Horatio Hornblower (notice the initials?). <br />In this, the second of Honor's adventures, she's been sent from her home system of Manticore to Grayson, an outlying system inhabited by a society of misogynistic religious fanatics from earth. Their problem is that their neighbors, on the planet of Masada, are even more fanatical than they are, and consider anyone who disagrees with them \\"apostates\\" and think them better off dead. The People's Republic of Haven has decided to take advantage of that, and sent a small fleet of warships to Masada, where they join the Masadan navy and completely upset the balance of power. Both Grayson and Masadan societies were originally very luddite, so their own fleets are nothing compared to what the Havenites and the Manticorans can put into the mix. When the Masadans and their Havenite allies attack, the result is a test for Honor and her ships, as the Havenites fleet is larger than hers, and contains a battlecruiser she can't hope to match at anything like even odds.<br />There are many things for Honor to deal with along the way. She has an uncomfortable dinner with the chief of state of Grayson, winds up badly injured herself, has to deal with a very self-important diplomat, and the like. Hanging over everything is the overtly sexist society she's been ordered to protect.<br />Honor, of course, survives and handles it all with aplomb. The book's plot slides right along, and it's a good afternoon read. I would recommend it.
B00005YXZH|2.0|\\"I'm an American aquarium drinker/I assassin down the avenue\\".Beautiful lines. Not sure about their exact meaning,but  reading them I can't help feeling excited and almost overwhelmed by their greatness. Listening to Jeff Tweedy singing the aformentioned lines in the first track of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot(cool title!)is a different story.His voice sounds so empty,boring and annoying. The music completely kills the mood. The song drags on for 7 minutes or so,and it does nothing but watering down all the excitment and awe you felt before. 7 minutes! I surely didn't wait for that damn song to finish,after the first seconds of butchery I guess I gave it a couple minutes to see if it got better. It didn't.<BR>The other songs,I heard snippets here and there,and never a riff,a melody,a rhythm,a sound grabbed me. I spent an evening or two just navigating through the album trying to find something worthwile without falling asleep. I didn't. I love weird music with an experimental side that maintains melody,but this thing is just boring.It doesn't sound edgy and interesting-just boring.<BR>But the lyrics are so good I can't give it less than two stars. I suggest that the next time maybe Jeff Tweedy should simply print a book and stop \\"experimenting\\" with music.
6302787564|5.0|This movie taps into the core of what's wrong with our &quot;society.&quot; First of all, it shows that we don't actually live in a society, we live in a cesspool. <br />The definition of a society is a &quot;group of people distinguished from others by mutual interests, shared institutions, and a common culture.&quot; And I don't mean consumerism.<br />During the film, however, we don't see things that resemble &quot;mutual interests&quot; and &quot;shared institutions.&quot; What we see is multiculturalism, which is the opposite of culture. We see groups fighting against one another, struggling to survive. We see people stuck in traffic like cattle on the way to slaughter. The only thing people share in common is paying their taxes to the Internal Revenue Service. The government has to milk all of its cows. And when they're done using you, they discard you like a piece of garbage. People are reduced to cogs in a machine. <br />One of the most poignant scenes of the film involves a black man trying to get a loan from the bank, but he's declined because he is not &quot;economically viable,&quot; in other words the bank believes he isn't worth exploiting. The bottom line for the bank is profit. So he gets thrown to the curb. People are treated like numbers and ratios: which amount to dollar signs. Some &quot;community,&quot; eh?<br />Deceit is another theme in Falling Down. People are often misled and taken advantage of in society. The cheeseburger on the menu always looks bigger and tastier than in it does in real life. These subtle acts of lying are common enough in our world that people don't care or notice.<br />I wonder how long will it take before everything bursts at the seams? If this movie is any indication, it'll be sooner rather than later. Thank our &quot;elected&quot; officials for selling out America. As my favorite bumper sticker points out, &quot;we don't have a democracy, we have an auction.&quot;<br />Well, it's time to go watch Jerry Springer.
B00003CXXM|2.0|My first reaction was \\"Is this the right movie\\"?<br />If you've read the book, or even seen the original \\"Bourne\\" movie, this is sure to disappoint! <br />I liked a few elements of this movie,.... The action was okay, but the main character was too young to strike you as the ruthless and capable Jason Bourne. Also, to me, he kept whining all the way through the movie. By the end, I was hoping they'd shoot him!<br />If you've watched the first movie, or if you've read the book... don't bother with this pale reflection...<br />...

B00005V1B1|5.0|That 3 star guy has no idea what he's talking about.  Camel is a criminally underrated band! If you measure a band based on their popularity in the U.S. then go away!!  Labels??  Call them prog, rock, whatever, these guys are too sophisticated for most people (in a Jethro tull sort of way, but less 'English').  That said, I can't believe how great Mirage is (as well as their debut, Camel).  Freefall is incredible and sounds like it could be by a current UK band. Supertwister blows me out of the water. There is not a bad song on here.  Lady Fantasy is a gorgeous epic as is Nimrodel.  The live bonus stuff is amazing as well ie) Arubaluba.  Camel is a musicians band, I prefer them to Yes and Genesis, way less pretentious, more tasteful and better songs by a million miles!! Buy Mirage and check out the debut it's even better!!!!

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Brilliance can only describe Donnie Darko. Every aspect of this film from the direction to the score is unbelievable. I loved it so much, I saw it 5 times at the cinema, in its extremely narrow and short release in Australia. The cinematic experience of Donnie Darko is incomparable, however multiple DVD viewing is essential. I have never seen so many extras pakced onto one disk! I don't usually bother with extras, but the extended and deleted scenes add immensely to this complex fantasy, which I think could have all easily been left in the full feature. I can't wait to see what Richard Kelly follows his amazing debut feature with.
B000066AXC|1.0|This is the bastard child of Fight Club and Good Will Hunting, and it inherited none of the good looks or wit of either. <br />A real shocker of a film, it insulted my own intelligence with it's ham-fisted plot. The only highlight of the film was the surprise half way through (from which point, it loses all direction). <br />What a turkey!
B000062YAZ|5.0|Let's set this straight- this may be one of the best agression metal albums ever, but it's not the heaviest, fastest, or most brutal.  When it was released it was, but a lot of bands have gone past it.  For pure headbanging fun, it can't be beat, but if you're really into heavy, check out Strapping Young Lad's \\"City\\" or anything by Meshuggah.  They're not Death Metal, which is usually so garbled that it loses its edge.  Also get Earth AD by the Misfits.  It's so poorly produced it's laughable, but it's pure agression.  And it was put out years before Reign in Blood, Master of Puppets, or any of the other defining metal albums.

B00005R62K|5.0|It's probobly safe to say that the origional version is more worth getting. Up to 9 tracks, 44:00. The bonus track is just another baladic about 08:00 long and the live one, like on all the albums, is the same thing. But when I got this one, I realy liked the way it sounded(which was nothing like Sin After Sin). The album cover looks very cool and looks like it's got louder and better songs, and I saw all those colorful arrows in the back and I was just very impressed by them.<BR>The best tracks on this album are the first and the last(which has got to be the heaviest track on this album). The re-mastered version gets up to something like 54-55:00, but the origional version is still long enough.
B000066NW0|5.0|Ok. This cd is awesome. The lyrics are great, the rythm and how original she is! Her cd, has a rap song, a song expressing anger, one expressing to be herself, one expressing love, and some telling stories.

B0000028M7|4.0|Probably Alice In Chains' greatest album (although Jar Of Flies comes close), Dirt is a harrowing quasi-concept album that chronicles the life of a drug addict. It is the most emotional and darkest album to come out of the Seattle scene, and possibly one of the most depressing albums ever, right up there with Joy Division's Closer.<br />Like Joy Division's final album, Dirt is almost impossible to listen to at times. Not that it's bad, just the opposite--the lyrics are so insufferably bleak that it'll send some listeners searching for the straight blade. From beginning to end you feel the self-destruction from drug abuse and depression (something that lead singer and guitarist Layne Staley knew all too well). There is no hope, no silver lining to this cloud.<br />As a band, few Seattle acts approached Alice In Chains' musical talent. Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell take turns at vocals and songwriting, and both do a fantastic job of conveying the darkness and gloom central to this album. As guitarists that took their inspiration from Van Halen and Metallica in technical playing, these guys could put the punkish Kurt Cobain to shame (although Kurt was great in his own right). Together Jerry and Layne lay down dark, sludgy riffs that make Black Sabbath seem almost bubblegum by comparison.<br />The album as a whole is dominated by doomy chords, sudden uptempo shifts, and unconventional time signatures. Highlights include the startling Them Bones (which causes the listener to jump on first listen), the hard-hitting Dam That River, the bad trip of Rain When I Die and Down In A Hole, the Vietnam epic Rooster (a ode to Cantrell's veteran father), the pitch-black Junkhead (Staley's arguably most confessional song), the creepy Angry Chair, and the dark closer Would? Dirt is a pummeling, brutal album. At the end, the listener is left without a clear resolution. The only emotion shown at the end by the protagonist of Dirt is surrender to his own demons--very powerful indeed.<br />I can't give this album a five-star rating--filler tracks such as Hate To Feel and the title track prevent me from doing so. Still this ranks as one of the most powerful albums of any era, and is a haunting depiction of Seattle's dark side. Buy it, unless you are a manic-depressive or have any hint of suicidal tendencies. Also buy the acoustic EP Jar Of Flies, which is an essential companion to Dirt and shows a different side to Alice In Chains' sound.<br />----R.I.P.

B00005AR3G|5.0|\\"The Emporer's New Groove\\" is a laugh riot with great voiceover work by David Spade, John Goodman, Eartha Kitt, and Patrick Warbuton, grandly hilarious as \\"Kronk\\".<br />Relying heavily on swift pacing and a marvelously witty script, the film works on many levels.<br />It is cool enough to be appreciated by adults, small kids, and the most critical of all: teens.<br />\\"Yzma's\\" (Kitt) final \\"transformation\\" brings about a major \\"guffaw\\" from those that witness it.
B000069AUI|4.0|I first thought that the guy who sang \\"Clocks\\" and \\"In My Place\\" was Dave Matthews! That's what you get for listening with half and ear to the radio. Now that I've bought this CD, I guess I like Coldplay's catchy melodies. I like that many of their songs are piano-based, and that the tunes are a mix of slow and fast.<br />There's definite passion in the singing and playing. A few somgs remind me of the draggy, haunted style of Mazzy Star. The album ends on a quiet note... I thought track #9, \\"A Whisper,\\" sounded more like an ending, but that's trivial stuff. This is a good collection.<br />What I didn't expect was a political lecture in the liner notes. Coldplay insists that the world is \\"strangled... by ruthless western businesses,\\" which is really quite curious given that Western culture buys the band's music and makes their lives considerably more comfortable than, say, the Third World. Oops, I forgot, we are all crass consumers! Anyway, I just listen to the music and venture no further with the history or politics of this band.<br />I withheld one star for politics.
B000006E17|5.0|The setting:  North Italy during the Nazi occupation of 1944-1945.  Four Italian leaders, the Duke, the President of the Court of Appeals, the Bishop, and the President, conceive a scheme to take nine young men and women, late teens, take them to an exquisite villa, \\"far beyond the reach of any legality\\", and perform their indecent desires on them.  They also marry each other's respective daughters in order to \\"join our destinies.\\"  Thus begins Pasolini's adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's 120 Days Of Sodom.<br />What kind of indecent desires?  Basically, the routine is as follows:  at 6 pm, the captives are to assemble in the 'orgy room', where storytellers would tell a series of stories on a given subject, and where the leaders, inspired by the stories, could engage in any act of lewdness at the expense of the captives.  The President insists on details:  \\"It's solely how we draw from your stories, the type of stimulation that serve us and that we expect from them.\\"<br />The captives are on the receiving end of the inspirations conceived by the four leaders, whether it's acting like dogs, forced to eat a meal of...best not described here, being raped, or being mistreated in general.  They are naked most of the time.<br />The most despicable of the elite four is the President, a thin, wormy-looking man with a permanent sick smile on his face.  He tells stupid jokes, (well, actually one involving a man and his friend 6-times-8 is kinda funny) and is rather fond of being on the receiving end of homosexual sex, which consists the majority of sex in this film.<br />Those who break the rules, such as having sex with another woman or performing the slightest religious act have their name written down in a black book to be given some cruel punishment.<br />It is in the Circle of Blood segment that the captives are tortured in cruel and disturbing ways while each leader takes turns watching the events from upstairs with binoculars.  The radio playing \\"Veris leta facies\\" from Carmina Burana adds to the grimness of the spectacle.<br />There are some interesting quotes, political and psychological.  \\"Nothing's more contagious than evil\\" says the Duke, to which the Court President says, \\"Some can only do evil when their passion drives them to evil.\\"  This ties in with the ambiguous difference between freedom and utter willfulness defined in fascism as described on the video sleeve blurb.  Also, \\"as you well know, killing the same man many times is not enough;  it's advisable instead to kill as many living beings as possible.\\"  And on love:  \\"the limitation of love is that one needs an accomplice.  A libertine$B!G(Bs refinement lies in being at once, executioner and victim.\\"<br /><br />The bearded Paolo Bonacelli plays the Duke, and also came out in The Stendhal Syndrome, in Night On Earth as the monsignor in Roberto Benigni's cab, and Johnny Stecchino, also opposite Benigni.<br />The video sleeve description of \\"Revolting, memorable, and beautiful\\" hits the mark.  It's self-indulgent, excessive, and deserved the X-rating it got, but I found myself fascinated by this sordid mess of a movie.  The movie's sordidness took on a new meaning with Pasolini's own murder--he was bludgeoned to death and run over by his own Alfa Romeo (!!!) by a youth who claimed Pasolini made homosexual advances towards him.<br />Oh, by the way, for those who don't know where Salo is, it's inbetween Milan and Verona, sitting at the west shore of Lake Garda.rom Carmina Burana adds to the grimness of the spectacle.<br />There are some interesting quotes, political and psychological.  \\"Nothing's more contagious than evil\\" says the Duke, to which the Court President says, \\"Some can only do evil when their passion drives them to evil.\\"  This ties in with the ambiguous difference between freedom and utter willfulness defined in fascism as described on the video sleeve blurb.

B000068PQ0|5.0|The Flaming Lips became part of my musical vocabulary with this CD. It also helped that they appeared in a low-key but zany commercial alongside Penn and Teller (what is with the bunny outfits?). The sounds herein can only be described as soothing, spacey, insistent and quirky. It's like an alien mold that takes hold in your skin and grows! Play it on a very good stereo, please! I am reminded of the tech-head quality of Alan Parsons, Todd Rundgren and Pink Floyd. In fact, some of the tunes have a Floydian twist to them. Wayne Coyne's gentle vocals are perfect for lines like \\"those evil robots are programmed to destroy,\\" and \\"do you realize that all the people you know, someday, will die?\\"<br />Much of the music runs in a cycle. Themes are explored and repeated to weave a cosmic swirl of wistful nostalgia, futuristic noodlings, and trance-like grooves. This is music for gawky white guys who don't like rap.<br />Another Amazon reviewer advised that Lips newcomers try other CDs before listening to \\"Yoshimi.\\" I jumped in with both feet, and it's my favorite album from 2002 (and 3000!). Every music lover should have one or two \\"obscure\\" bands in their collection, just to keep things interesting. The Flaming Lips will occupy that space, and grow...
B00006FXB6|5.0|Queens of the Stoneage comes from the time-evolved remnants of Kyuss, if you know anything about that band.  Some time ago there were a lot of people getting together and hanging out in the desert, playing music and of course doing the requisite drugs for such a scene.  Kyuss, Gamma Ray, and Queens of the Stoneage (QOTSA) all evolved from that scene, sharing members and musical styles along the way. The previous QOTSA album, Rated R, borrowed Nick Lucero for drums, and this newest release borrows the extraordinarily talented (and funny) Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters (and, of course, Nirvana).  Dave's drumming is understatedly impressive on this album.  <br />QOTSA has been reportedly involved with the likes of Ween, And You Will Know Us by the Trail of the Dead, Tool, and various other seemingly-irrelevant bands. They are versatile and creative. Buy this album.  Listen to it. It is better than anything. Ever.<br />In addition.... the DVD is great.  You get to see Dave drumming while showing his teeth, and there is also a fascinating scene while Josh Homme and Dave discuss technical details of musicianship using various forms of onomatopoeia. Them's a creative bunch.

Limp Bizkit failed.  It really was a great idea for the guitar player to quit.  He is way to good for that god awful band
0375707972|5.0|'The Reader' is a short book, written in a simple style, which, paradoxically, deals with enormously complicated and nuanced issues.  It's tempting to say that its strengths are also its weaknesses:  brevity and clarity allow key concerns to be put vividly, however they limit a discussion around these concerns to the merely suggestive;  the intelligence of the reader is never insulted, but, then again, too much might also be presumed.<BR>*<BR>The spare style of the prose has numerous effects, not all unequivocally positive.  Certainly it makes for a clear exposition of the plot.  It also gives the narrator a voice that is free of apparent irony, and so makes it initially hard to credit that he is keeping anything from us, or from himself.  Yet this very clarity, with its superficial honesty, starts to feel like it's failing to communicate the complexity and messiness of the thoughts and emotions raised by the subject matter.  Its cool distance can feel like pretence.  Once pretence is suspected, then it's possible to ask whether the narrator is deliberately leaving out much that is pertinent, and whether his clarity actually curtails, rather than encourages, further thought about the difficult issues contained in the book.<BR>*<BR>To look at this another way, it is as if we are allowed access to only one of the voices inhabiting the mind of the narrator.  The events depicted suggest a tremendous internal conflict within th narrator, a conflict that might be expected to generate a number of opposing voices, much like in one of Dostoevsky's protagonists.  Instead, a fairly uniform, and oddly dispassionate, voice is presented to the world.  This voice is very clear, and spare, and readable, but I'm not sure it's the most interesting, or insightful, or truthful way to illuminate the issues at the book's heart.<BR>*<BR>The clarity of the style extends from the word surface to the structure.  This can be beguiling, in that where gaps in information exist, these gaps are readily visible, and we can engage in the imaginative task of filling them in.  Who were Hanna Schmitz's parents?  What were the details of Michael Berg's marriage and his subsequent affairs?  What kind of relationship did he maintain with his child?  These and many other questions might reflect upon the text, but Schlink provides answers which are, at best, suggestive, at worst, non-existent.  Again, this is double-edged.  The reader is shown respect, is not manipulated or told what to think, but perhaps insufficient guidance is provided for further thought to be successfully promoted.  To be more personal - I felt I was being asked to, \\"Think about Germany's relationship with its Nazi past\\", but I was given the means to this only in the most broad and 'suggestive' of strokes.<BR>*<BR>If the key concern of the book is the relationship of one person, or one nation, has with a flawed and shameful past, then overall, 'The Reader' puts the questions squarely and clearly.  It is also well aware that no one 'answer' exists to these questions.  However, its strategy of leaving silence to speak of the complexity is flawed.  The many answers, most incompatible and partial, that might have been offered to the reader are left unsaid.  The undeniable courage of the narrative seems to stop short when more is needed, but that is not to belittle its considerable achievement in arriving at such a vantage.
0375414053|5.0|Honestly, I don't understand the \\"holier-than-thou\\" tone taken by some of the negative reviews.  This book is about ONE FICTIONAL working mother and the characterisations are tongue-in-cheek.  Who'd want to read a book about a working mother whose life is in balance and guilt-free?  Zzzz!!  Working mothers sniping at each other are worse than the \\"muffia\\".  If anything, Kate Reddy should give comfort (in a schadenfreude way) to  real working mothers who are doing the best they can and that is pretty darn good.
B000002KLZ|5.0|For Buckingham fans, this is a must have.  It is his best performance of &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot;.  And his other performances have unmatched passion with his voice still in its prime:  &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, &quot;Never Going Back Again&quot;, &quot;Not That Funny&quot; and &quot;Oh Well&quot; are especially good.  But &quot;I'm So Afraid&quot; alone is worth the price.

B000002BE9|5.0|I actually bought &quot;Tidal&quot; on accident, but its one of the best albums I own.  Fiona's deep, sultry voice is both bluesy and jazzy and perfect for relaxing after a hard day,long drives through the city, romantic evenings at home.  The songs are deeply intense and personal, as well as heartwrenchingly beautiful.  I can't even pick a favorite track because they're all flawless. This is perfect music.

B000003CMB|5.0|I could go on and on about how great this album is, but suffice it to say that everyone I knew played it so much, they wore their records out.  Good thing they invented CD's.  I bought the album when it first came out and I'm still listening, baby.  \\"I said WAKE UP MAMA, turn your lamp down low.... \\"  A get-down rocking blues soul live concert at the Fillmore East by one of the best bands that ever lived.  It doesn't get any better than this!  Buy it.    Five freaking stars and I'd give it more if they'd let me....
B00000IPAX|5.0|There was a time when I wasn' really musically smart.  A time where I listened to Will Smith, Britney Spears, & *NSYNC.  But then came Eminem, Limp Bizkit, & this band.<br />Now, I bought this cd in the summer of 2000 because I was musically bored.  I heard the cd and it was unlike anything I ever heard before.  This cd changed my life.  This was really different, catchy, and just amazing.  This is the funniest cd ever.  I love singing along to it, it's just pure good.<br />After awhile, I wanted to hear more, I bought the other Blink 182 cds.  I became a huge Blink fan, to this day, those guys are my favorite band, I am such a huge fan ...
0316666343|3.0|&quot;The Lovely Bones&quot; reminded me a lot of &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean.&quot;  If you liked one, you will surely like the other.  I look forward to reading Ms. Sebold's next work.<br />For what it is worth, I agree with the reviewer who considered the last part of the story a misstep.  I would go farther and say I thought it was very disappointing.  At the end of the chapter immediately preceding the &quot;misstep&quot;, the reader is led to believe that something important is about to happen.  I guess the &quot;misstep&quot; could be considered a dramatic development, but it cheapens the rest of Susie's story.  Ms. Sebold could have gone in so many different directions.  Why did she have to go in that one?<br />Nonetheless, I recommend this book.
B00005JLSC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie immensely. The music is lively, the dancing is fantastic and all the principal actors are wonderful in their roles.<br />It is difficult to choose a favorite between the two female leads, because they're both so good, but it is Renee Zellweger's performance as murderess Roxie Hart that is the most realistic, though this may simply be because her character is the more fleshed-out of the two. I was also surprised to realize what a beautiful voice she has, a fact that comes wonderfully to light in her performance of \\"Funny Honey\\".<br />Richard Gere (in the role of Roxie's lawyer Billy Flynn) is also very effective as a song-and-dance man. Vocally, he might not have the range of others, but he gamely puts his all into such songs as \\"All I Care About\\" and \\"Razzle Dazzle\\", and it is difficult to pull your attention away from him.<br />Also worthy of note is Queen Latifah, as Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton and John C. Reilly, as Roxie's loyal schlep of a husband. I must also mention an actress (whose name I unfortunately don't remember) who makes the most of her small role as an innocent woman convicted of murder. Without giving too much away, it's an interesting point that it is the good people in Chicago that end up suffering.<br />The one thing I didn't like about the movie was the fact that there is no crises of character, or moment of change, in any of the leads. Roxie is more fully realized than either Billy or Zeta-Jones' Velma, yet all three are grasping, unlikable people, and their characters stay pretty static throughout the film. This is necessitated in some respects, by the plot, yet it would have been refreshing to see at least one of the three learn something from the experience.<br />There are only a few swear words and no nudity in the movie. However, there are some scenes of violence and racy dance numbers. Altogether, a very enjoyable film; you will be humming some of the tunes for days afterward.
B000060P79|1.0|...P>Simple Plan is doing nothing new.  That is not their crime.  Simple Plan simply wrote another Blink 182 CD.  They happen to have the good fortune of MTV needing a band that sounds like blink; looks like blink and tastes like blink to satisfy the thirst for Blink 182 while there is no Blink 182.  MTV will sell kids millions of CD's to a nation of ... kids.<br />Simple Plan is simply Blink 180.
B000071ZZI|4.0|Greek sailors find a man floating in the Med sea, take him in, and their doc finds a couple bullet holes in his back, as well as a laser capsule in his leg with a Swiss bank account number.  The man recovers, but suffers from amnesia.  Thus begins his quest to regain his identity.  Only, when he opens the security box in Switzerland, he discovers passports from half a dozen countries, wads of cash in various currencies, loads of cool spy gear, and a gun.<br />Soon the chase is on, from Zurich to Paris, as our man Bourne enlists the help of the German gypsy Marie (charming Franka Potente) and eludes the operatives sent by his CIA superiors until a stunning conclusion when he returns to Paris.<br />What I liked:<br />Great setting details of Europe, especially Paris.  There were a number of key action sequences, including a car chase involving a Mini taking on French police, and the wildest stairway descent I've ever seen on film.  I also thought Matt Damon and Franka Potente had good screen chemistry.  There was also a moving scene where Bourne confronts one the assassins on his trail, the professor, played by Clive Owen in a small part.<br />What needed work:<br />The hero with amnesia card has been played before, and I would have liked a little more development of Damon's character other than him realizing he had all these drilled in spy skills.  We never do get a sense of his likes and dislikes.  I liked the film ending over the alternate version, but both could have been better.<br />This is a movie I would watch again.
0066214122|5.0|this book and I finished it in 2-3 days! After the stinker &quot;Timeline&quot; I wasn't going to buy anymore of Crichton's books but Prey is a refreshing and riveting change from that.<br />At times the plot is inconsistent but overall Chrichton has written another excellent and spooky thriller. One of the hallmarks of Crichton's writing is taking a complex subject and explaining it in layman's terms and by writing about nanotechnology he takes on a difficult one.<br />He describes nanotechnology as a merging of biotechnology, computer technology, and miniaturization. Machines that are &quot;1000 times smaller than the diameter of a hair&quot; is mind boggling but what the researchers do with them is the subject of a very scary book. And probably a really creepy movie.<br />In 'Jurrasic Park' I found so many interesting passages, I read that book twice but in 'Prey' I found a few notable gems. <br />An example: &quot;we live in an evolutionary everything--evolutionary biology, evolutionary medicine,evolutionary ecology, evolutionary economics... but it is surprising how rarely people think in evolutionary terms.&quot; &quot;It is a human blind spot that we look at our world around us as a snapshot when it is really a movie, constantly changing.&quot;<br />A compelling book, I  stopped reading it and got ready to go to bed; it was late and I was tired. I put it down for 5 minutes, then inexplicaby picked it up again and read into the night!! I only wish it was longer. <br />Cody
B00005B36H|5.0|What could be said about Tool, except they have an incredibly unmeasurable talent for music, song-writing, and everything else that you can find allusive to their music.  This was the first Tool album I've bought, and it is definitely not the last one.<BR>Great band, great music, what is there else to say?
B00005JK8K|3.0|As a kid in the 1960's, before the advent  VCR's, let alone DVD's, I would scour the TV listings for my favorite war films. One such favorite was \\"Battle Cry\\" (1955) staring the late Aldo Ray. In that film there is a cameo shot of a Native American sending a radio message that baffles a Japanese soldier intercepting the message who cannot understand the strange language he is hearing. My step-father, a navy veteran of the Pacific, told me that the Marines utilized \\"indians\\" (he did not specify Navajo) as radio operators because the Japanese could not understand their language (he also did not specify a \\"code\\"). John Woo's \\"Windtalkers\\" finally brings to the silver screen an awareness of the Navajo code talkers who played such a vital role in winning some of the bloodiest campaigns in the Pacific during World War II. I used the word \\"awareness\\" instead of \\"tribute\\" because any tribute to these brave men was buried beneath the dramatic storyline of the movie.  The Navajo code talkers certainly deserve as fitting a tribute that other films depicting the contributions of American servicemen who were then considered racial minorities have bestowed on their subjects. Films such as \\"Go For Broke\\" [1951] (the story of the 442 Regimental Combat Team made up of Japanese-Americans, Neisai) and \\"Tuskegee Airmen\\" [1995] (the first fighter squadron comprised entirely of African-American piots) paid homage to these gallant, but, in 1940s America, socially unaccepted individuals. The Navajo \\"Windtalkers\\" did not get as good a voice as their African-American or Japanese-American comrades in John Woo's film.The plot centers around Sgt. Evers (Nicholas Cage), a tormented, battle fatigued marine who is assigned to protect Yahzee, a \\"Windtalker\\" (Adam Beach) and the code, no matter what. Christian Slater is also given the same assignment. Cage, who had previously gotten a squad of marines killed because he chose to follow orders to the letter, is excellent at portraying a man haunted by ghosts from the past. He is a loner, lives for the moment, avoids getting too close to people, including Beach, and goes berserk in combat, racking up the enemy body-count. Beach also does a fine acting job as Yahzee who must make the inevitable transition from naive patriotism to the horrible realities of war. Slater's character provides a contrast to Cage. He quickly becomes interested in Navajo culture, has plans for the future, and forms an emotional bond with his \\"Windtalker,\\" named Whitehorse. Slater is not at his best in this film. His performance is the weakest among the cast. When Whitehorse is killed by Evers to avoid the code talker's capture, Yahzee's transition is complete as he seeks revenge on the enemy by taking on the evil personae of his protector, Evers. The film contains big battle scenes that are well done except the pyrotechnics are so overdone it becomes annoying. Every explosion, including those from hand grenades produce huge gasoline explosions; their mushroom clouds rising to the heavens. Historically, the main battles take place on the Japanese island of Saipan in June, 1944. Although the film never mentions it, our platoon of Marines probably belonged to the 2nd Marine Division. The 2nd attacked a well dug in Japanese position on high ground fortified with artillery and tanks as accurately shown in the movie. An old modus operandi in war films was to keep the unit being portrayed anonymous as not to offend other units such as the 27th Infantry Division (Army) and 4th Marine Division that also fought bravely on Saipan. Woo resorted back to this old tactic, but managed to insert a superimposed map to show the battle's progress. The computer graphics of American dive-bombers supporting the Marines added great realism.Directors of war films today are faced with the dilemma of drama versus historical depiction. With \\"Windtalker,\\" Woo tried to combine both. Woo fulfilled his purpose but the Navajo code talkers deserve a better forum for theirvaliant efforts. A good movie but a mediocre tribute.valiant efforts. A good movie but a mediocre tribute.
B000001E7T|5.0|I really thought I'd never hear anything original or real again in popular music. It sort of seemed to die about 15, 20 years ago so most of my listening is weird stuff that only a few aficionados and I like. Then I heard this cd.<br />The music is at least as magnificent as the lyrics. This is what electric guitars were invented for. This is what recording studios are meant to do. This is up there with VU's bannana record, Trout Mask Replica, Lumpy Gravy. It is immortal
B000088E6M|3.0|Way too much hype about this album and not without reason, with DRE at the helm the beats were always gonna be on point.<BR>\\"poor lil rich\\" and \\"21 questions\\" are poor though and put me off this album completely, way too much of the usuall guns, women, cars and not enough about 50 cent. Obviously 50 is trying to appeal to a large audience, including many women so his content is simple and the hooks are catchy. Not enough of the clever humour that 50 has produced in the past to make this even as good as \\"Guess who's back?\\". 50 cent had the world waiting to hear what he had to say, i thought he wasted an opportunity to change the game, but i will finish by saying that i don't think this is 50 anywhere near his best, which i beleave is yet to come, not a bad album but somewhat rushed lyrically.
B0000019HU|4.0|The guitar was believed to have originated in ancient Egypt, and its use as a musical instrument is still being developed today.<BR><br />These dudes were quite proficient with the guitar, and what's more, the music sounds very good too. Bleak, moody, and softly dragging like a tugboat manned by lovelorn somnambulists over a violent waterfall; it crashes beautifully. Don't miss it.
B00006RIO7|4.0|Would have got a 5 star but for the final two tracks by Queen Latiffa,L'll Kim, and Macy Gray and Anastasia.On a soundtrack that is from a musical that takes place in the 1920's what were the producers thinking when they put on two  R&amp;B/Hip Hop tracks as the final two tracks. By far the majority of people who enjoy 20's jazz are not likely to be fans of todays R&amp;B/ Hip Hop genres, besides they are totally out of place on this cd. Buy the cd and burn a copy without the final two tracks and save yourself a whole lot of aggravation.That being said this is an excellent cd with amazing sound.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|U-571 is good movie with plenty of action and excitement.  However, as a quasi-historical story it comes up seriously short in the accuracy department.  The movie takes a real event and re-casts it with an American flavor.  <br />The simple fact is that U-571 depicts Americans capturing a German Enigma coding machine to break Nazi communications. The feat was actually accomplished by the British in 1941 -- before the United States entered World War II.<br />Hollywood's revisionist bent is nothing new.  Other recent movies such as Saving Private Ryan and The Patriot have sent historians running for the asprin bottle.  What concerns me most is the showing parts or all of this movie in school classrooms as a substitute for real history.

B00005UW7G|5.0|Mozart's music is divine, here presented by outstanding singers who are also credible actors, beautifully costumed for period and occasion, on a scene that is very much believable, set in castles and countryside of northern Italy.  The opera comes to life for the viewer, even seems to take on a life of its own as the plot unfolds.  A hint of social critique of the time comes through as the Don pursues the peasant girl Zerlina, though not as strongly so as in the Marriage of Figaro. It is hard to point to anything that is not perfect in this rendition, except possibly that the glorious music does not come through as strongly during open-air scenes as when the action is between walls.  I believe that this is not as much a flaw as the natural consequence of a natural setting as opposed to the artifical one in a theater.  This DVD gives you the option to turn subtitles on and off, and they come in several languages.  I look forward to seeing Don Giovanni with Spanish subtitles next - that should be a most pleasant way to practice a language!
B00000J7S8|5.0|Diana's previous collection of very romantic love songs had been so successful that the formula was repeated. However, there is nothing formulaic about the quality of this album, which is every bit as good as Love scenes.<br />Again, the songs were chosen from the Great American songbook. Many of the songs were originally American hits in the twenties and thirties, including Let's face the music and dance (Fred Astaire), Devil may care (Glenn Miller), Let's fall in love (Eddy Duchin), When I look in your eyes (Hunter Rodeheaver and Virginia Asher), I've got you under my skin (Ray Noble), I can't give you anything but love (Cliff Edwards, Ben Selvin and Johnny Hamp all had huge hits with it), I'll string along with you (Ted Fio Rito), East of the sun (Tom Coakley), Pick yourself up (Fred Astaire) and Do it again (Paul Whiteman).<br />Some of these songs, like Let's face the music and dance, were originally more up-tempo, but here they are slowed right down, making them sound fresh and exciting. The original artists are mostly unknown these days - only Glenn Miller and Fred Astaire remain widely recognisable - but Diana and others are doing an excellent job of keeping their music alive and relevant to a modern generation.
B00005JL78|2.0|I watched this movie expecting to see an intelligent, exciting, and enjoyable futuristic sci-fi movie by a talented director. I was not expecting to see scenes that were gross, tasteless, nauseating and purposeless nor was I expecting the film to contain scenes that were downright stupid and illogical. Nevertheless, these are the kinds of scenes I found in \\"Minority Report\\" and they prevented me from enjoying an otherwise good movie.<br />     A drug dealer removes his dark glasses to reveal his empty eye sockets in graphic detail. Another character is introduced blowing a large amount of snot all over his face. While Tom Cruise's eyes are covered with bandages and he can't see, he gets sick trying to eat things that weren't meant to be eaten. What purpose did any of these scenes serve? Clearly there was no purpose except to gross out the audience. The scenes did nothing to advance the story and they most certainly did nothing to enhance my enjoyment of the movie! I was so infuriated by Steven Spielberg's presuming that I would want to pay money to see such things that I could not concentrate on the dialogue for several minutes afterward.<BR> <BR>     In another scene, a bunch of spider-like robotic probes enter the building looking for Tom Cruise and they scan the eyeballs of everyone they find including Cruise's eyeballs which were recently replaced. A police women who is monitoring the probes says, \\"We have an I.D. but it's not him\\" (Cruise). How could she be sure when it was established earlier in the film that anyone can swap eyeballs on the street for a few hundred dollars? Since we have robotic probes at the present time that use small video cameras, I found it astonishing that the futuristic probes in \\"Minority Report\\" did not have video capability as a back-up system. If they did, Cruise would have been recognized.<BR> <BR>     After his surgery, Cruise keeps his old eyeballs and uses them to get past the retinal scans and gain access to the \\"precogs\\". Later his ex-wife does the same thing. I'm sure the police could have adjusted their security system so that it would alert them if Cruise attempted this. Did they forget? Twice?<br />     Some of the fight scenes were unconvincing and I found it odd that so many police officers came across as so ill-trained, incompetent, and easily out-maneuvered.<br />     Finally, I didn't like the look of the film. It was far too cold. I understand the purpose of this but it was overdone. I feel that Spielberg should have been more subtle to achieve that effect, but he is often anything but subtle. <BR> <BR>     The film has many good elements. The story was good, many scenes are compelling, and the ending is satisying. But I found myself haunted and disturbed for days by the unpleasant scenes.<br />     For the unnecessary grossness of \\"Minority Report\\", I take off a star. For the stupidity of not one but at least two scenes, combined with the fact that someone with the talent and experience of Spielberg should have used better judgement, I take off two more stars.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I bought this album out on a whim. I didn't know what to expect and I had only heard the single \\"All The Things She Said\\". I decided since it was only $9.99, I'd check it out. There's lots of rumors about the girls, but don't let that push you away from this album. Gimmick or Real Deal...? These girls, as far as I'm concerned are the real deal. I shall break down each track for you.<BR>1) Not Gonna Get Us - This song is a great song to dance to. It's one of those songs that start out with energy and doesn't stop until the song ends. Pretty good song. Reminds me of those you'd hear inside the dance clubs. (4/5)<BR>2) All The Things She Said - This is the single that drew me to the album. You all have probably heard it before. It is quite different than anything on the radio. Really nice, emotion song. One all can relate to some sort of love. (5/5)<BR>3) Show Me Love - This is an interesting song. It starts out as a ballad but turns into some sort of ballad techno song. If you have ever heard of Eiffel65 (\\"Blue Da Ba Di\\"), this song is quite reminiscent of that sound. Simple lyrics... perhaps too simple, but still a nice song. (4/5)<BR>4) 30 Minutes - One of the best songs on the album. You will instantly fall in love with this song. It is a soft piano driven ballad and the vocals fit the piece outstandingly. Simple lyrics yet touching and powerful due to the emotion the girls carry in their voices. This song alone is worth buying the CD. (5/5)<BR>5) How Soon Is Now - This is mere filler. Nothing too good about this song. It's not a bad song... it's just average. I skip over it. (3/5)<BR>6) Clowns (Can You See Me Now?)- Without a doubt the best song on the album. An instant pop/dance/club classic. The lyrics are great and the vocals are best. A song about finding the truth. I would describe this song as a pop/techo/2-step garage ballad. This along with \\"30 mintues\\" is worth the $9.99... believe me! (5/5)<BR>7) Malchik Gay - The title is Russian. This is an okay song.The lyrics are simple and to the point. Like track five it is average... just slightly above average though. It's worth hearing. (3.5/5)<BR>8) Stars - A great song with good vocals and sound. Perhaps the most unique song on the album. It reminds me of the group Enigma. Has a Russian vibe to it as well as a Russian rap/spoken part. This is a up beat ballad. It is composed really well. Outstanding. (5/5)<BR>9) Ya Shosla s Uma- \\"All The Things She Said\\" in Russian. It's better in English. The language is too rough for this song. (3.5/5)<BR>10) Nas ne Dagoniat- \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" in Russian. Still sounds good surprisingly. (3.5/5)<BR>11) Show Me Love [Extended Version]- Just as good as the original track. Just a little more upbeat and pop-like. (4/5)<BR>12) All The Things She Said Video - This is a multimedia track. The video is great and definitely worth the time to watch. (5/5)<br />     This CD doesn't offer many tracks (8 English tracks, 2 Russian re-dos, 1 re-mix, and 1 Video), but overall it is worth the buy. Atleast it is something different than what is on the radio currently, a breath of fresh air. This is what the pop world needs, a little revamping. Good album, a good buy... It's worth the purchase. Overall I give this album a 4.2.
0385484518|2.0|I'm amazed at how well received this book has become. I'm a curmudgeon at 29 to be sure, but insightful readers of this book would struggle to find meaning or purpose to the ramblings of a ... Instead of sophisticated answers to life's many philosophical conundrums, we're deluged with aphorisms such as \\"When you're in bed, you're dead.\\" This book is perfect fodder for the Chicken Soup crowd, but woe be to the reader who seeks answers to life's tougher questions.
0446310786|5.0|I originally had to read this book for class, but it turned out to become one of the most fantastic books I've ever read. Harper Lee's style of writing is perfect, blending in with her real characters. She bases Scout Finch on herself and Dill on her childhood friend Truman Capote. I loved this book. It's truly a magnificent novel, teaching people some of life's most endearing lessons through the story of a simple 9-year old girl in a sleepy Alabama town.
0345308239|5.0|Barbara Tuchman was probably getting frustrated by the time she wrote March of Folly. Because anyone who studies history learns early on just how much of human history is, well, folly. In this work, Ms. Tuchman focuses on four graphic examples of it. Sometimes the fabulous human follies actually works out (such as the American Revolution which worked out well enough for us if not for the British!) but most times it doesn't, such as Viet Nam. Nowhere will you find such a clear, relatively brief, yet very accurate and readable history of how the U.S. found itself stuck in that debacle than in this fine work. Many will be surprised how far back our involvement went, and that it wasn't all Lyndon Johnson's fault...although our involvement was brought to its inevitable climax (and failure) under his watch. So if you aren't interested in the other three \\"follies\\" Tuchman examines (Troy, The causes of the Protestant Reformation, The \\"loss\\" of America by the British) then, as another reviewer has suggested, read it for the Viet Nam part alone. <br />So how many of you think we're headed into a \\"folly\\" in Iraq? Hmmm - I see the show of hands is just about even. Which also goes to prove (once again) how easy it is to find folly when you have the luxury of hindsight. Nevertheless, Tuchman implores us to continue to try to learn from the past.
B000003TA4|4.0|This is a fine album from a fine band. Though many are quick to attack it because the band is so \\"overrated\\" or because it wouldn't have received half the hype it got had Kurt not committed suicide, this is a CD that any self-proclaimed rock fan should at the very least listen to. <br />Nevermind is certainly not as raw as their previous albums, and nearly every track has a strong melody. Though Nirvana was considered a grunge band, much of their material on Nevermind would make your average pop songwriter green with envy. Virtually anyone worth his or her salt has heard \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", and this is CD is a good way for someone to ease into Nirvana.<br />As my review's title suggests, this CD really is satisfying. From the opening chords of \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" to the quiet and, in my opinion, poignant \\"Something in the Way\\", Nevermind is a solid album.
0790729725|5.0|For those of you bad mouthing the DVD version of this film.. look at the DVD release date...<br />DVD Release Date: August 22, 1997<br />How many of you had even heard of DVD in 1997?  This was an early release title.  Non-Anamorphic and double sided flipper.  That's the only way it could be done at the time. So don't whine about it.  Currently it is still the best way to view the film (next to having your own print).<br />Let's just hope there will be a re-release that does the film justice on DVD and of course eventually in HD.

0679642609|5.0|In the introduction to his translation of the &quot;Meditations&quot; Gregory Hays observes that &quot;[I]t has been a generation since [The Meditations'] last English incarnation.&quot;  Hays further explains that he has attempted to present a readable, modern translation of Marcus' great work which strill captures the &quot;patchwork character of the original.&quot;  I find that Hays's translation succeeds.  He translates Marcus's reflections into a colloquial, frequently earthy, English in unstitled language and idiom that will be familiar to a modern reader.  I think the translation is as well faithful to Marcus's thought.  The reflective, meditative character of the paragraphs come through well, as does the difficulty of the text in many places.  This is a book that will encourage the modern reader to approach Marcus -- an altogether commendable result.<br />Professor Hays has written an excellent introduction to his translation which can be read with benefit by those coming to the &quot;Meditations&quot; for the first time and by those familiar with the work.  There is a brief discussion of Marcus's life, his philosophical studies, and his tenure as emperor of Rome (161-180 A.D.) Hays spends more time on the philosophical background of Marcus's thought emphasizing ancient stoicism and of the philosophy of Heraclitus. He discusses the concept of &quot;logos&quot;, a critical term for Marcus and for later thought, and argues that logos -- or the common reason that pervades man and the universe -- is as much a process as it is a substance.  This is difficult, but insightful.<br />Hays obviously has a great love for Marcus's book and has thought about it well. He is able to offer critical observations which will help the reader focus in studying the Meditations.  (For example, Hays argues that Marcus does not understand or appreciate human joy very well.  He also argues that Marcus's thought takes an overly static view of the nature of society and does not see the possiblity or need for societal change.) Hays discusses briefly the reception of the Meditiations over the centuries.  I enjoyed in particular his references to the essays of Arnold and Brodsky on Marcus Aurelius.  I haven't read these essays, but Hays's discussion makes me want to do so.<br />The Meditations is one of the great book of the West and will repay repeated readings.  When I read it this time, I was struck by Marcus's devotion to his duties in life as the Roman emperor.  I got the distinct impression that Marcus would have rather been at his studies but kept telling himself, in his writings, that he had to persevere and be the person he was meant to be.  It is a focused approach, to say the least, to the duties to which one was called.<br />I was also impressed with the similarities at certain points between Marcus's thought and Buddhism.  Other reviewers have also noted this similarity.  Marcus talks repeatedly about the changing, impermanent character of human life and about the pervasive character of human suffering.  He talks about controlling and ending suffering by understanding its causes and then changing one's life accordingly. There is a need to learn patience and to control anger and desire.  More specifically, Marcus' understanding of perception and how it leads to desire and can be controlled by reason (discussed well in Hays's introduction.) is very Buddhist in tone.  I have become interested in Buddhism and was struck in this reading of the Meditations by the parallels it offers to Buddhist thought.<br />There is a wonderful paragraph in the Meditations where Marcus urges himself to persevere and not to lose hope simply because he did not become a scholar or a hero or the person of his dreams.  What matters is being a good person and living in harmony with one's nature.  This passage spoke clearly and poignantly to me as I reread the Meditations.  Undoubtedly, the reader will find passages in this book that are addressed clearly to him orher.<br />This is a book that should be read and pondered many times.  Hays and the Modern Library have done readers a service with this translation.or her.<br />This is a book that should be read and pondered many times.

B000069HK2|5.0|The Used's CD is great.  I heard them about two years ago and then heard them a few more time over the following 3 months.  Finally I heard that their CD came out...Soo I got it, and its great.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone who likes the bi-polar style of music.  This CD has tons of screaming yet tons of soft stuff.  Overall this is just a great album.  Buy it.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|What can I say . . . this work is one of the most inspired and immersive I've ever seen.  The performances are almost all completely flawless.  The visuals are surreal in the most breathtaking and mind-bending way.  I barely took a breath from the film's beginning to it's rapturous end.<br />In particular, the scenes in the school were most beautifully handled.  No campy, Buffy-esque Romanticism of teenage coolness, or &quot;Heathers&quot;-type pretentious morbidity.  All the relationships are believable.  I can't think of a single thing wrong with this film, except that it was over too soon.  So I started it over.<br />Cinematic perfection.
B00005B36H|4.0|Which leads me to the thought. There are 3 tool albums, and of course by now 3 groups of people and how they view each of tool's albums, 1 being the people who think undertow is there best 2, who think aenima is there best and 3, who think lateralus is there best, of whom I fit. While all three groups have there own reasons for thinking either undertow, aenima or this one for being the best I'll give my reasons why I think this could quite possibly be tool's best album so far. As I have said before, opioins change over time and lateralus have grown to be one of my favorite rock albums. Highly atmosphirc also.<br />Lateralus has alot of better qualitys that well, lacked somewhat on the previeous realses. A. it has diversity, where each song does not sound the same, which was an occuring presence on undertow. B. it's a hell of alot more solid, where if the right musical mood or taste there is NOT a track you would skip a track, except the very last song, or sound bite, which really should not of been on there, where as aenima had a problem with filler, with the exception of 6 or 7 stellar tunes. Lateralus however fills in both those gaps with not only being solid, but mature both liyicly and there musical ability. And of course just to I think clarify these negative reviews, after a 5 year absence, usually people are always sceptical on what will be next and by that instinct to some will come dissapointment. So I shall just get to the music.<br />Lateralus starts off with \\"the grudge\\" with it's hard/soft song structure, while easing into a rather interesting little tune/riff \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\" inwich I have always been intrequed by this being a guitar player myself, full of maturity. While that tune fades into \\"the patient\\" with the typical soft hard bulid up. \\"schism\\" is the first single and most people know this one, interesting video with it aswell. \\"Parabol\\" for some reason give's me the chills, just can't explain it. While you think that it's basicly one mellow song comes in \\"Parabola\\", yet another interesting tune, a hard rocker and at the very end has this very cool little guitar riff. Awile ago I really didn't have much of a intrest in \\"ticks and leeches\\" untill the last few months, love the hard beging with the simplistic strumming in the middle. While the titled tack \\"lateralus\\" is one of my fav's.  And so on.....till \\"disposition\\" shows striking diversity. While the selond half fall into a more atmosphirc vibe, with \\"refelction\\" a little repetitive, but I like it, close your eyes and it takes you on a mental journey. And closeing \\"Triad.\\"<br />Oh and just a few more comments, please just yet don't put Tool in the league of led zeppelin and pink floyd, give em a few more albums and well will see.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|Being a longtime fan of Ry Cooder, I know that any project that he emerges with will be well worth the wait and result in something special. From the beginning project with 1997's Grammy winning \\"Buena Vista Social Club\\" project, the world has come to know the richness of Cuba's almost forgotten music. Each musician has come to record a solo project from these sessions.     <BR>     This new project, \\"Mambo Sinuendo\\" features a small combo sound, a sound that was alive in the late '50's, early '60's. This setting does not showcase the big Buena Vista Social Club brass or vocals. This project is a stripped-down, seductive twangy guitar sound, featuring the guitar work of Manuel Galban up front & center. Manuel Galban is a masterful Cuban guitarist, whose style is like American guitarist Duane Eddy, one of Ry Cooder's influences. <BR>     Ry Cooder plays the harmony guitar parts, weaving dreamlike rhythms and occasional hawaiin steel guitar and organ throughout, adding texture. The drums & percussion are shared by Ry's son Joachim and Jim Keltner, one of the world's best drummers. The bass is played by Cuba's  \\"Cachiato\\" Lopez, and along with a couple songs with congos and background vocals, the set is almost entirely an instrumental affair.<BR>         This is a lovely set of peaceful music, that is great to listen to again and again. Ry Cooder has been on vacation in Cuba, making some of the finest music of his career, and he has taken us all along with him. I enjoyed this project, as the guitars sound so dreamy and seductive. Throughout this set of songs I have felt so relaxed and taken in by this great music. When the last notes drift into silence, it's like realising that vacation is over and it's time to go back to the grind. <BR>     I have my personal faves on this recording. \\"Patricia\\" is a joy. The uptempo beat, duel guitar interplay is great. There are many soothing songs, and a couple of uptempo songs. But of the soothing slower ones, \\"La Luna En Tu Mirada\\", is so hypnotic, that I find myself so envolved that I was almost in Cuba with them, resting on the beach at sunset. When the song ends, and I come to my senses, I relise that it was a only a dream.<BR>     I highly recommend this cd, as it will not only remind you of how great Cuban combo music was in it's heyday, but will let you escape the grind and stress of your modern day. When it's over, as the last note fades into silence, you long for more. Hopefully there will be.... Rob.
0312117337|5.0|The Osho Zen cards and book are not designed as divinatory.  Osho was a guru of great wisdom and humanity. This set was constructed from his teachings.  I know of no higher tool of its kind for spiritual growth, i.e. growth as a human.  Everything about this set is top of the line.  On a scale of one to ten I'd place it at 20.  The art and color are smashing and evocative, the stock is top quality, as is the packaging, which isn't cardboard but a durable box with a flip up lid that fits snugly and lifts easily, providing permanent protection for this lovely and marvelous deck.  What a companion for your life's path!

B000065U1N|5.0|This movie is absolutely great; it is the best war movie I have ever watched. It is based on a true story. The action is great, the actors are doing very well, the suspense is excellent; on top of all that, great values are demonstrated (team spirit, courage etc.). This movie definitely sets a good example.
0446677450|1.0|Poorly written.  A smattering of common-sense advice that a 10 year old could figure out for himself/herself.  This book was really an advertisement for other services he wants you to buy. <BR>Total garbage.   I returned it, it was so bad and poorly written. The worst book I've seen in 20 years.  Useless.  What more can I say?  It's a sad commentary on the inteligence of the American public that this guy has sold more than 100 copies since publication.   I agree with all the bad reviews thus far.
B00003XACV|5.0|Thomas Newman has done it again. With the American Beauty score, Newman created his own genre of music...an instantly identifiable style, that is original (see other reviews for more extensive descriptions of this), beautiful, and weird, all in one. Dead Already, probably the most popular song from the album, is addictive from the moment you hear it. It is delicate, but not gentle...precise, perfect, and catchy. Still Dead, a reprise of Dead Already, is essentially the same song, but has a far more eerie feel to it. Arose and American Beauty (the song, not the album) both are sad piano pieces that you simply want to close your eyes to. <br />It is hard to pick any piece on this album that is less than loveable, and it is for that reason that Thomas Newman has become one of the greatest musical artists of our time.
B000000H6D|5.0|I don't say this without it meaning anything. I was plesantly surprised by this album the tracks CHRISTIAN WOMAN, BLOODY KISSES are two of my favorites, however the entire album is a dark delight. After Sisters of Mercy has been played to death on your stereo, pop this bad boy into the cd player and prepare to be amazed. Great album!
B00005YXZH|5.0|It was on top of many, many critics lists as the best album of 2002, but for some reason most of the western world seems to have overlooked Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.<br />It's their loss. The album is one of the best of our time, from the beautifully dreary &quot;Poor Places&quot; and &quot;Reservations&quot; to the more upbeat and happy &quot;Kamera&quot;. For some reason I grew weary of &quot;Jesus, etc.&quot; quickly, though I can still admit it was an excellent song. Wilco seems to be at the tail end of their progressive stage, and hopefully they will continue creating music like that which is on YHF for a long, long time. Wilco is one of the few bands out there that doesn't have to change much to be perfect. <br />The only problem I have with them is the abnormally long length of their songs...both Reservations and Poor Places, my two favorite songs on the CD, are over 5 minutes in length. In each, 2 minutes could have been easily shaved off with little effect on the overall quality of the song. Then again, it's good to see that they are still experimenting.
B000008DT5|4.0|this is a must for those who like 80s pop a set of twins bros thus bros ,great album sure they where a one album wonder their second album sunk like a rock, but Push was great songs like &quot;when will i be famous and Drop the boy take me back to the club scene in the late 80s buy it its a slice of history almost the bay city rollers of the 80s , might also of been the begining of the boy band craze try it for your selfs
B0000508U6|5.0|Parachutes is a stunning effort from Coldplay. I've always been a fan of pianos being incorporated into music, and Coldplay does it superbly in \\"Trouble\\", which may be the most beautiful song on the album. \\"Don't Panic\\" (which is the second version of the song; it originally appeared on Coldplay's album called The Blue Room and is much more eerie and more sad) begins the album with a catchy guitar part, and it continues onto \\"Shiver\\", a guitar-driven beauty. Then, onto \\"Spies\\", where Chris Martin shows off his vocal ability, sounding almost machine-like at times of the song. The album seems to loose something when the track switches to \\"Sparks\\", but it quickly redeems itself with \\"Yellow\\", a song that is both sad and uplifting (or 'wuss rock', as Time Magazine put it). The rest of the album is great, but the first six songs are without a doubt the best part of Parachutes.<br />All in all, Parachutes is far superior to A Rush Of Blood To The Head (Coldplay's most recent album), and this album will be looked at for generations as the one which began the superstardom of Coldplay.<br />One final tip...keep listening at the end of \\"Everything's Not Lost\\" for a 'hidden' track called \\"Life Is For Living\\".
B00006L7XQ|5.0|This is a great CD by a great artist. If you're new to Johnny Cash I would get all of his American recordings as well as something like \\"Love, God, Murder\\", which has a great deal of his early stuff. He has fans of all ages and much of his music is timeless. If possible watch him on video and you're sure to be hooked!
B00003CXE6|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. The acting was very well performed, and it is a visually stunning film. I think it brings to life the time period better than any other film of its type. It is a great popcorn munching piece of eye-candy. But as an historian I really cringed with one of the premises of the movie. I also know that there are some people whose only information regarding historical events comes from watching Hollywood movies. That is not a good thing. Historical accuracy is not one of Hollywood's best attributes.<br />At the end of the film they would have you believe that the Empire was abolished and the Republic was restored. (Anti-monarchial sentiments?) But in reality that was not the case. The two emperors are historical figures who actually lived in real life. Emperor Marcus Aurelius ruled Rome from 161AD until 180AD, while his son, Commodus, excellently played by Joachin Pheonix, ruled from 180AD until his murder in 192AD. But hopefully most people are aware that there was not a restoration of the Roman Senate after the death of the emperor Commodus. The Empire in the West survived for another 284 years, while the Eastern, or Byzantine, Empire survived until 1453 when emperor Constantine XI was deposed by the Turks.<br />I think films such as this are good for capturing a way of life that can be hard for people to conceptualize, and they can also be an excellent impetus for investigating further into historical information.
B000070IXT|5.0|If u dont think this was a very good movie,\\"Witch i dont know very much people who think it was a bad movie\\", u need to sit and watch it again and again and pay very close attention to alot of the stuff in the movie.  If u notice the story line was beautifully written, the zombies were nicely portrayed, and best of all it has the most devilish, evil, Resident Evil video game look and fell i've ever felt in a movie. Wonerfull watch it again and really pay attention enjoy. P.S especiallly in dark:)
B000088E6M|5.0|There are only two or three songs on this entire cd that I wouldnt give five stars.  Usually on rap albums, there are two or three songs that define the record.  This one has too many to mention.  50 cent uses new beats that remind me somewhat of tupacs era.  He even uses a jamaican drum in one song.  PIMP and In Da Club are the two best songs, but there are about 12 or 13 others that I can't stop listening to.  I have a feeling that this cd with be in my player for months to come.
B00004U2G4|5.0|In the summer of 1968 I was 15 and in my first band when i heard this LP.We had been doing the Yardbirds Shapes of things for 6 months when I heard the version on this album.I couldn't believe that someone could sing with the ease Rod Stewart delivered.I'd tried to copy that delivery into our band for our last two shows but it was impossible.There are so many styles this album started like doing bass drums guitar and vocals and not much else.Listen to Let me love you and tell me its not almost the perfect blues song.Everthing is just right without being too flashy,wonderful from beginning to end.Morning Dew as mentioned in a previous review stands out and nobody sings like Rod.I have read that the whole Led Zep idea came from this band and Jeff Beck was not too happy.This the one that started the blues revival in the late 60's.Buy it and play it loud ,Rod can really belt out a tune or two can't he.
6303824382|4.0|DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is the third installment in the Die Hard series and finds our beloved cop hero, John McClane, at home in New York City. The brother of the lead terrorist that McClane got rid of in the first film, seems to have a personal vendetta to settle with McClane. Simon (Jeremy Irons) has McClane perform all sorts of life-endangering stunts for his amusement. One stunt involves McClane wearing a very racist sign stark naked in Harlem. He is saved there by a local store owner, Zeus (Samuel L. Jackson) who because of his Good Samaritan deed, inadvertently becomes a part of the plot. Actually, Simon is just using his hatred of McClane as a cover for his real plot, to steal the Federal Reserve in NYC.<br /><br />Whereas the original DIE HARD was a guy's romance (lots of action all to save the girl), DIE HARD: WITH A VENGEANCE is a buddy movie. The pairing of Willis and Jackson is genius and the camaraderie and verbal wit between the duo is pure delight.<br /><br />The movie has a great deal of action but doesn't have as tight script as the original DIE HARD. It tries to make up for that with bigger explosions and action scenes. Of course sometimes bigger isn't always better. Some of the early scenes were so realistic that this movie was postponed for a few months because of the Oklahoma City bombing. After 9-11, some may find some of the scenes to be uncomforting, unsettling, and hitting too close to home. But keep in mind, this movie was made when Hollywood kept feeding us the myth--that we all wanted to believe-- that terrorism could never happen to us.<br /><br />Other than the scenes that some may find unsettling and a loose script, the other drawback of the film is that McClane is separated from his beloved wife Holly, which just doesn't fit the DIE HARD formula. The first two films were guy romances which made them enduring. This picture has taken that romantic element out and attempted to replace it with the buddy angle. It works, but it isn't as enduring. Whereas in the first two movies, McClane was saving the world to save his wife, in this movie he's saving the world to save his life.enduring. Whereas in the first two movies, McClane was saving the world to save his wife, in this movie he's saving the world to save his life.

B000001Y5D|5.0|As the radio nowadays is polluted by no talent acts like Avril Lavigne and Michelle Branch, I can only remember the early 90's when the group 4 non blondes exploded on to the music scene with &quot;What's Up.&quot; Who cannot but love this song?  This song is reason enough to buy the album and do you remember when they kept playing &quot;What's Up&quot; during the olympic games in Oslo, Norway?  Yeah this song and 4 nonblondes are all that.  Linda Perry went on to work with such acts as Pink and Christina Aguilera and has written such songs as &quot;Get This Party Started.&quot;  There you have it.  It's a shame these gals were 1 hit wonders because this CD and the song &quot;What's Up&quot; Is great. Also check out the really cool remix. It's hot as well. A+

B000002JEV|5.0|led zeppelin has done a lot of things musically, emotionally, and every other \\"ally\\" in the book for people all over the universe. they've accomplished this through various studio recordings and even more-so with live recordings. \\"BBC Sessions,\\" is a MUST as it can, as cameron crowe reportedly said to his mother, \\"...change your life.\\" led zeppelin can tend to do just that.<br />led zeppelin, however, cannot... <br />excuse me, led zeppelin HAS NEVER or ever will be capable of (for more than the obvious reasons) doing anything LESS than what they did, and that is more than the, \\"best.\\" few musicians have been able to this- jimi hendrix, the thirteenth floor elevators, miles davis, public enemy, etc. etc.<br />as for the \\"shunned-i-wish-i-was-an-elitests' motto:\\" <br />\\"[...]not as good without overdubs,\\" a statement i've heard in so many words more or less- whence spoken by a zeppelin \\"fan\\" completely revokes their opinion and self-proclaimed, \\"competence,\\" that they acredit themselves for having. <br />criticisms, in that manner, from anyone should and/or can ONLY be given when they WRITE/perform/etc. songs contained in the zeppelin catalogue. this means WRITE not be able to play- anybody, including myself, can play these tunes verbatim- as they are standards to mosts guitarists. but,when one of us have written the most \\"requested rock song in history,\\" or debuted an un-heard song from an up and-coming album to a crowd that stared in silent awe after you played it, criticisms on this matter can be given- but never taken seriously. <br />jimmy page is the TWO HARDEST WORKING GUITARISTS IN ROCK N' ROLL HISTORY. his perfomances on the 'BBC sessions' and on 'the song remains the same' are proof of this. listening to live versions of his songs showcases his great improvisational techniques with the blues and other songs- deviating away from pentatonic scales and warm-up's i leanred middle-school band class that can be heard a lot of other places. i would've liked to hear jimmy work around some modal tunes as well- but his speed, great sense of time, and odd progressions are the most musical rock 'n roll compositions ever created. live material from led zeppelin are guitarist/song writer/singer/musician/fan \\"how-to's\\" and \\"you wish you could's\\" that should be appreciated by everyone. <br />john bonham's ability to play under the group- not over shadowing or being too modest with the rhythm, making it more than a percussive element to the song... in some songs maybe even making it just as, if not, more integral than melodic elements. its funny to see friends air-drum the bridge of 'stairway to heaven' that goes into the solo incorrectly (start counting on 'and'), or when 'dazed and confused' is sometimes mistaken for being in 4/4 or 3/3, getting lost on \\"misty mountain hop\\" for a quick count etc. etc... some of the his best drumming on 'bbc...' would have to be on 'since i've been lovin you.' especially after a thorough studying of the recorded version is done. as with jimmy and the rest of the band- listening to a live version is like getting a whole new song- variations on a theme even, and sutdio work is NEVER lacking or missed in these recordings. so for those of you that memorized all of those bonzo solos and confidently pound those dents into your dashboard, get ready for a new learning experience and dents on more places. <br />robert plant's vocals are undescribable- he too, rarely perfomed recorded versions verbatim live. \\"soulfull,\\" stylings is what they could be called... could be. i just call it robert plant.<br />john paul jones' song writing abilites weren't out in the forefront quite yet- at least i don't think, as far as i know- most of the \\"more melodic/less\\" dissonant riffs/progressions are his- as i don't know exacts off hand- i cannot give him the proper credit he deserves, most likely even with the specifics. <br />the best song on the set though would have to be, 'since i've been lovin' you.' displaying the band's entire scope and range- all the way from influences to their signature sound. they succeed in melting the blues influences without sacraficing any oiriginality during the verses and the solo. in the bridge portions and the ending, they drop their trademark, \\"heavy-metal,\\" sound in which all of the band is other-worldly in sync with each other, creating recorded evidence that they in fact did NOT sell their souls- as many of our parents' parent's might have thought. they even play gospel styled changes, like the ending where robert plant can receive no praise that would suffice. when plant sings, \\"do you remember mama, when i knocked up on your door...\\" the song turns into a psychedellic master-piece (along with blues, rock, etc. masterpiece.) <br />the entire album is perfection- for lack of a better term, highlights being, 'whole lotta love,\\" \\"dazed and confused,\\" \\"that's the way,\\" well- i'm not in the mood to type down the entire tracklisting.<br />all in all- the ablum, for those of us who yearn for new material sometimes, is a \\"change of scenery.\\" never growing tired of where led zeppelin took us, but just moving us down the street or out to the park for a day- some fresh air and sunshine, and just like the real world- we eventually

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Rarely are movies which are released today so intricate and so well meshed. Richard Kelly was able to pull off both of these in his first try, with Donnie Darko. Donnie Darko is the tale of a teenager of the title's namesake (Jake Gyllenhaal), who is also a somnabulist. He is from an upperclass family which doesn't have your normal table topics for dinner. Coupled with the fact that Donnie sees a psychiatrist and takes psychiatric medication is fertile territory to make for such a vibrant character. Every character (even the janitor!) in the film springs to life with some kind of nuanced magic of which Richard Kelly is the only practitioner. <br />The intricacy is nothing to be overlooked; as the story touches on philosophy, time travel, the end of the world and subtexts. You see unusual things: hypnosis, detached jet engines, two-bit horror movies, dirty voyeurs and a geriatric woman who can't stay off the road. All the while resonating of the late 80's and all the while seeming completely possible. <br />If you think soundtracks are something more than just an annoyance, then you will love the artists they picked for the as well as well as the original score. The climax of the movie features a song by Gary Jules, called &quot;Mad World&quot;, which really adds to an already amazing movie.<br />The way the film was edited and cut turns the 112 minute runtime into somehting of a blur. You won't notice you've been sitting for that long and you will want to see it again when it's over. The all-star cast is helpful for convincing people to see it, but I'm convinced, with the way Kelly handled less accomplished actors, that he could have just as easily pulled it off with no recognizable faces.
0792845668|3.0|I enjoy watching BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE because it is such a humorous, fun movie that takes a look at time travel in a very light-hearted way. I avoided watching BILL AND TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY for the longest time because I knew it just wouldn't compare to the first and the concept just didn't appeal to me.<br /><br />Well, I'm sorry to say, but the Bogus Journey isn't anywhere near as good as the original film. Bill and Ted have been out of high school for a long time, yet they still act and behave like they're in high school. That's not so bad, but then they get killed by evil robot counterparts from the future and the movie quickly goes downhill from there until the last ten minutes of the film where we learn how Bill and Ted became the great Bill and Ted of the future. The whole journey through Heaven and Hell that the bumbling duo travel is a pain to watch. Also, what's the deal with a Martian in Heaven? That's just wrong. Sure, Station is a fun character, but it just doesn't fit. Also, we know how Bill and Ted came back to life, but how did Station come back from death?<br /><br />Anyway, I'm taking this movie way too seriously, but that's the point. Whereas, the first movie was fun and humorous enough to ignore the plot holes and suspend your disbelief, this one is not. Besides explaining Bill and Ted history, the only other high point of this movie is the scene where Bill and Ted challenge Death; it's a great bit of comedy and makes the drudgery of most of the rest of the movie worth watching.
0553812173|4.0|To use the word \\"complex\\" would be an understatement. I found I had to read much slower than usual to take it all in, and it was well worth it. Just when you think you've figured out who the bad guys are, they do something good. As other reviewers have already stated , there is a fine line here between good and evil.<br />Full of military strategies and coups. There are no young boys growing up to be leaders of their people; Women battle along side of the men(no swooning maidens to be found); and Mr. Erikson has no trouble at all killing off major charcters.<br />As with many fantasy epics there can be so many characters, and I had to keep refering to the glossary of names at the front of book. Because of this there is a lack of characterization(I didn't learn as much about them as I'd have liked). Hopefully, I will learn more about them in the follow up novel \\"Deadhouse Gates\\".
6304626495|4.0|MONTY PYTHON'S LIFE OF BRIAN isn't as funny as MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, but the film is still pretty funny. The movie examines one Brian who was born on the same day as Jesus in a stable just next door. Brian's life parallels Jesus' in a number of ways right up to Brian's undeserving crucifixion. The film contains several hilarious scenes (the stoning, Latin graffiti) and the film's closing song &#34;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&#34; has become a comedy gem.<br /><br />With that said, the movie can be and is found offensive by many people who find it ridiculing Christianity. I am a Christian myself, but found much of the film to be funny. There were a couple of times that the movie bordered on the offensive (e.g. when Brian is preaching the words of Jesus in the streets of Jerusalem), but overall I could see and enjoy the humor without taking it too seriously. Still, it does make one wonder, why Monty Python examined the life of Brian on a concurrent course with Jesus. Why couldn't they have had Brian living at the same time as Muhammed or Buddha or Confucius? I think we all know the answer to that. The answer justifies many people's rejection of this film and even though I found most of the movie funny, I don't blame them for being offended.
B000069HK2|2.0|I would like to say that this album is way overrated. I think its a horrible album. Something about this band, just don't sound right. There is something missing, maybe cathcy melodies. (the only song that is good is the taste of ink)<br />If you are looking to become a punk rock/emo/screamo fan, don't buy this. Buy bands like Taking Back Sunday, Thursday, Fairweather and Unwritten Law.
B000006IUQ|5.0|\\"The Edge\\" is without doubt one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. The flick is outstanding on virtually every level: cinematography, acting, suspense, score, locations, etc. <br />Three men get stranded in the remote Northwest wilderness. The plane crash that causes this predicament has got to be the best such scene ever filmed -- it looked very real. Although nature itself presents some harrowing dangers for these men (especially in the form of a kodiak bear), two of them find out that their biggest danger is HUMAN nature -- in the form of covetousness, adultery, greed and murder.<br />Anthony Hopkins stars as an intellectual billionaire who is insecure about his accumulated wealth of (seemingly useless) knowledge, his money and his beautiful model wife played by Elle MacPherson. He's not sure who he can trust, or who is really his friend just for the sake of such. He's a bit paranoid that people will naturally assume his sexy wife married him just for his money. And he suspects that she's having a fling with her photographer, played by Alec Baldwin.<br />All this is the character backdrop to what is essentially a grand survival adventure. The entire mid-section of the film involves their encounter with the bear that stalks them. This chapter of the story could be called \\"Claws\\" (\\"Jaws\\" with a bear). The men work themselves up into a savage frenzy in determination to kill the bear. The final scene with the bruin has great suspense.<br />After this Hopkins and Baldwin face their greatest natural threat: eachother.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I really dont consider this to be a Matrix clone.  In fact the Matrix has rallyed up a rabid fan base that almost portrays \\"fanboys\\".  These people will label any futuristic action movie a matrix clone.  Equilibrium fell to these raved and raged fanboys. Truth be told  Equilibrium far out shines the Matrix, the action sequences are so awesome it gives me goosebumps.  It doesnt depend heavly on effects to dazzle **cough** Matrix.  Also the plot is so much then i coudl have of thought off.  It wasnt something just throw  toghter in order to blow stuff up, or it didnt leave people high and dry or start you off in the middle of no where. Everything about the plot is explained to the fullest, no gaps.  The actors play there roles greatly.  In fact this movie is as much as a drama as a action movie.  Every aspec is great.  The best movie i ever saw.
0440234743|3.0|Not one of Grisham's best.  However the story is entertaining and the book is a fast pace easy read.  Kinda like People Magazine.  Grisham's book &quot;The Firm&quot; is my favorite, so if a beginner to his work, I'd start there.
B00005JL96|4.0|Every minute of this movie is good. The animation is beautiful, the characters are well designed, and frankly Stitch is the Mouse house's best new addition. He matches the temper of Donald and the comedy antics of Goofy. The film keeps things going at a fast pace and never really drags or gets boring.  The DVD doesn't fare as well. The menus are cool and some of the featurettes are great but the other extras are just stuff you'd find on a regular direct-to-video Disney DVD. But then this leads me to believe that there will be a two-disc special edition coming out soon! But this DVD is still worth buying for the movie alone!
B000002UAC|5.0|Although impressive in spots, their debut disc did have its share of weaknessness.  Now with this, their second effort, the Beatles make a quantium leap in every phase of the game.  Right off the bat with the first song \\"It Won't Be Long,\\" the Beatles show their exhuberance is still there.  It's certainly not the best track on the disc but its just a fun song that you can imagine the boys shaking their heads to.  \\"All I've Got To Do\\" is a bluesier song which shows the increasing maturity of the Lennon/McCartney songwriting partnership.  McCartney's classic \\"All My Loving\\" is next with Harrison really showing vast improvment on guitar from the previous disc during this song.  Speaking of Harrison, his debut songwriting effort is next with \\"Don't Bother Me,\\" unforunately the Bealtes and/or George Martin didn't have enough faith in this solid tune and buried it with almost enough unneccesary percussion to sink it.  It's pessimistic tone on such an upbeat disc is certainly different.  \\"Llttle Child\\" is just a rocker for Lennon to sing, however the harmonica, at this point is getting a little dated.  \\"Till There Was You\\" is the first cover on this disc and handled well by McCartney who would later lean toward this type of soppy music later on in his career.  It has a nice tune and is well suited to Paul's voice.  On the subject of voice, next we have John successfully ripping through \\"Please Mister Postman\\"  The covers on this disc were more wisely chosen than their first to be sure.  Next up is Harrison who annihilates Chuck Berry's version of \\"Roll Over Beethoven.\\"  The Beatles make this the definitive version of the song by propelling the song forward with handclaps!  \\"Hold Me Tight\\" is another Beatle orignial and like \\"It Won't Be Long\\" is more of filler song than outstanding Beatle track.  However the sheer joy coming from the harmonies prevent it from it being even less.  \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\" shows the boys fondness for blues material as they handle Smokey Robinson's song with surprising deftness and with some amazing harmonies.  Ringo tackles \\"I Wanna Be Your Man\\" just as he did his number on the previous disc: With lots of energy and lots of fun.  And like on the first disc it works here as well.  George gets his third song next with \\"Devil in Her Heart\\"  He makes a workman's effort but at times it sounds as if he's straining to hit all the right notes in the song.  \\"Not a Second Time\\" is a fairly pedestian Beatles track lifted by Lennon's peerless vocal which commands attention from the listener.  \\"Money\\" finishes the disc in fine form, although not a raver like \\"Twist and Shout\\" it does the job.  The guitars(both Lennon and Harrison), harmonies and improved songwriting are no doubt the cornerstones of this disc's success.  This is as essential as \\"Sgt Pepper's\\" was to the Beatles mid career and \\"Abbey Road\\" was to their later career.  Its what the Beatles were in the begining: A cover band who could write good songs.Robinson's song with surprising deftness and with some amazing harmonies.

B00005JKCH|4.0|Spider-Man first off, is a great movie. Sure it's not perfect but what is? It's really what a fun movie is all about and it doesn't feel like the 121 minutes it is. The first disc, actually has more of the fun extra-wise with the pop-up webisodes and MAKING OF vignettes along with two commentaries. One that's okay (the sam raimi one) but a really good one (visual FX Crew). The second disc is mostly promotional stuff except for the great documentary about the Spider-Man comic. My main complaint with the DVD is that the menus are a bit frustrating to navigate and that the second disc could've had alot more but this is still worth owning. Go for Widescreen though, Fullscreen crops off alot of the action.
630025111X|5.0|i also watched the remake of this movie being a big tom selleck fan.i was dissapointed.lee marvin and jack palance             had a great chemistry that is rarely seen in most movies past or present.this is truly one of if not the best but unfortunatly one of the most forgotten films about the old west.Iwould not hesitate to recomend this film to anyone,and that everyone should see this film at least once for it is a real treasure and probably one of lee marvins finest roles along with cat ballou,maybe better. also the john barry score had a very familiar sound,similar to dances with wolves which was written many years later by that very composer.this film needs to be restored on to dvd.i would add this to my collection in a heartbeat.maybe some day. just a great film.
0312966199|5.0|This book is GREAT !! I loved from the beginning to the end.<br />It is about a Country vet. named James Herriot. Through out this book you have humor, adventure, everything you would want to find in a book! If you are a vet. , you love animals or you just want to read something good this, this book is for you!!
B00006BTCA|4.0|sleepy magpie, the scandinavian reviewer who recommended the smiths/hatful of hollow, the psychedelic furs s/t, the chameleons/script under the bridge and PIL/1st edition in lieu of interpol/turn on the bright lights, accuses these new york dimsters of graverobbing, and her case is a strong one.  to her list of graves pilfered, i might add echo and the bunnymen's crocodiles and a teardrop explodes' kiliminjaro.  paul banks' voice echoes mark burgess of the chameleons far more often than dear departed ian.  but to focus on his voice, as alluring as it is, is to miss the fact that interpol is one of the first new acts since the late-eighties/early nineties demise of love and rockets, the smiths, the stone roses and other late new wave outfits to understand the proper musical progression of a pop song.  untitled and stela was a diver... are the best examples of interpol's ability to follow a melody to its absolute, often unexpected conclusion, whether epic or hushed.  in fact, the only low point on this album is nyc, a song that would make any indie band proud but that fits awkwardly in the context of the darker, more complex harmonies and arrythmic beats that characterize the rest of turn on the bright lights.  sleepy magpie certainly knows her history, but her cynicism about american newer wave is an unjustified act of europosturing.  its true that one might see interpol wandering the cemetary late at night with shovels in hand, but they are surely the cream of the current crop of graverobbers.  i cannot wait to hear the results of their next round of macabre musical archaeology.
0385334206|5.0|Although I have have only read three Vonnegut novels so far, this is my 2nd favourite out of all three. (Slaughterhouse-five being my favourite.)  It's story tells of Dwayne Hoover, a car salesman who is slowly going insane, and of course Kilgore Trout, the science fiction writer whose on his way to Dwayne's home, Midland city, to an arts festival he's just been invited too.  My favourite part is the ending.  Now I won't spoil it for you, but when I finished the book I felt the ending to be quite dissapointing, but I thought about it for awhile and decided I loved afterwards.  Vonnegut creates a beautiful portrait of insanity and humour in this brilliant piece of fiction!!!
0066214122|4.0|Crichton does a good job laying out the future of nanotechnology and the good and bad it might bring.  This is the second nanotech book I have read (see Chasing the Dime) and Prey offers more insight into what can and might happen.<BR>The story is an interesting suspense novel with science and scientist gone wild.  What is developed as a potential military aid spins out of control and someone has to be brought in to get it under wraps.  Oddly enough, husband and wife are battling each other in good versus evil.  <BR>The story is intriguing until the last few chapters where it ends very predictably.  All in all, it is a fun read if you enjoy exploring what the future can bring us.
0440180295|5.0|This was my first Vonnegut book and is now my very favourite book of all time!  It's humour and uniqueness make it almost impossible to put it down.  When I got to the end of the book, I begged for more.  The characters are so memorable.  I still think of Billy Pilgrim and of course Montana Wildhack!  The story is original and superb.  I love Slaughterhouse-five!!!  It's  brilliant!!!
B000006OBQ|4.0|While Sintra is the star of this terrific music, he has two &quot;co-stars&quot; that equal him in every way:  Quincy Jones, and Count Basie and his Orchestra.  Jones's arrangements are gorgeous, and was there ever a tighter band or a sweeter sound than the Count Basie Orchestra -- conducted by Jones -- on this recording?  They have two instrumental-only tracks, &quot;All of Me&quot; and &quot;Makin' Whoopie&quot; that are terrific.  But behind -- or next to -- the Sinatra vocals, they are even better.  It doesn't get any better than this.<br />And, in this performance, literally it doesn't get any better than the music.  Sinatra's banter is somewhere between (the Rat Pack drinking jokes) skippable and (the Amos 'n Andy voices) offensive.   The music is 5 stars, the banter is 0.  Everything I've read about Sintra talks about him being racially-blind -- for instance, he was the best man at Sammy Davis, Jr.'s wedding with Swedish blonde May Britt, which scandalized many people at a time (1960) when inter-racial marriage was still illegal in many states.  Perhaps -- you can judge for yourself from his performance here.  <br />But it's the music that makes this CD, and it's a brilliant collaboration between a singer, an arranger/conductor, and an orchestra.
B00005RYLE|5.0|The Evil Dead will always remain my favorite horror film.  With a budget of only $300,000-$350,000 Sam Raimi managed to make the most amazing film in the horror genre.  The firts hald-hour is very suspenseful but once the first deadite shows up the pace never slows.  The violence is way over the top, with severed limbs and head, and more blood than any other horror flick aside from Peter Jackson's Dead Alive.  <BR>  The directing is absolutley outstanding.  Even in this, his first theatrical film, Sam Raimi proves that he is one of the most talented directors of all time.  This movie is just so visually pleasing it's incredible.  It is staggering how much the camera angles add to the clautrophobic nature of this movie.  <BR>  And this Book of the Dead edition DVD is amazing.  It is hands down the best packaging for any DVD yet.  The DVD comes tucked in the back of the real Book of the Dead from the film.  It looks and feels as if it is made out of flesh, and every page of the book is inside.  And what's this?  The characters inside the book are actually in fancy English letters that thank all of the fans of this horror trilogy!  Also, there is a seperate insert, a little booklet, tucked into the back of the Book of the Dead near where the DVD itself is that chronicles the making of this landmark film.  The DVD itself is awesome also.  Widecreen, good sound, and neat extras including behind the scenes, bloopers, and a documentary by star Bruce Campbell about star Bruce Campbell.  There is also some commentary tracks in there as well.<BR>  What agreat DVD.  It is a little bit expensive, but it is worth ever dime for fans of this film.
0684833395|5.0|I haven't read much fiction since high school and then I was forced to read. But being an avid reader of non-fiction myself, I wanted to turn things around and give fiction another try. I chose as my debut work Heller's Catch-22. I couldn't be more pleased with my choice.<br />The book is just brilliant and very funny. I found myself laughing out loud so many times. Heller has an amazing talent in describing people. By describing someone's appearance and habits it makes you think you have actually met the person, as with the Colonel who was described as someone who uses words such as apogee and panacea.<br />Reading the first one hundred pages or so I felt a little overwhelmed with so many characters. At that point I thought the book was going to be just that, an endless list of characters, but the best was still to come. All the insanity of war is revealed in an outrageously funny and tragic way. I have a feeling folks in Washington DC should be reading Catch-22 right now.<br />It became sort of a tradition among reviewers of Catch-22 to pick their favorite character. For me it's a hard toss between Milo, Orr, and Yossarian, of course; but I pick Orr.<br />Leonardo Alves - Houghton, Michigan - February 2003
B00003CXCW|5.0|This DVD release is a wonderful re-master of the film.  The menu effects are sophisticated.  The only disappointment was the amount of &quot;Bonus Material&quot;....but that's minor when compared with the overall quality of the DVD.<br />Others can review the story and its elements.  I'll just say this - you gotta have it!  If you are a collector of Hollywood's Golden Era, you gotta have it!
0671646788|5.0|I have read this book once every year.  This book has changed my life with its principles and thoughts.  Schwartz's book is tremendous as it helped transformed me from a shy, insecure person into the person that I am today.  One of the best self help books ever written in my humble opinion.  A must in anyone's success library.
B00005QDW1|1.0|It's official...my favorite &quot;closet&quot; band has gone full-on pop.  This album sounds at times like a Madonna album, and at times like a Siouxie and the Banshees album (but not a very good one).  Musically, the album is really good at times, but Gwen's slow and quiet vocals just don't seem to match up with what the band is trying to do...on two or three tracks.  This could've more appropriately called a Gwen Stefani album, and it looks like that is going to be their ticket to success because all they've got to do is make a couple of videos and the album is going to be a smash...indeed, I'm sure that it already is.<br />Color me disappointed.
B000002MIB|4.0|This is a pretty good live album. But it is not a perfect live album. Despite what one reviewer on here wrote, Sammmy does not do any Michael Jackson impersonation on the song \\"Jump\\". Eddie's guitar work is awesome thoughout the album. He does an awesome solo on \\"3:16\\". Further proof of Eddie's guitar heroic playing. Mike and Alex are also awesome thoughout the album. Mike does an awesome bass solo on \\"Ultra bass\\" and plays \\"Satutrday Evening in the part in it\\"(From Fair Warning). Alex does some cool athletic drumming on \\"Pleasure Dome\\". There may too much echo or reverb on a lot of the songs if not all.
B00005QHPQ|5.0|1. Escape<BR>- The song featured for naming the album, and the reason that I brought this CD. This English version and the Spanish version, number 11, both get 10 out of 10.<BR> <BR>2. Don't Turn Off the Lights<br />3. Love To See You Cry <BR>- Great song, but not one of my favourites. I think if another song was released as a single from this album, there could have been a better choice.<br />4. Hero <BR>- I love this song. I have heard a version of it that is more upbeat and danceable too, but that is not featured on the album.<br />5. I Will Survive<br />6. Love 4 Fun <BR>- This would have made a great single, a good beat and catchy lyrics, a really good pop song but with that special Enrique twist of latin.<br />7. Maybe <BR>- again, another great song. There is really nothing bad to say about this album, only praise.<br />8. One Night Stand <BR>- Brilliant song, a favourite, a good listen<br />9. She Be The One <BR>- &quot;Tick tock bang, thank you mam&quot; Catchy and entertaining<br />10. If the World Crashes Down<br />- One of my favourites. I adore this song. I can listen to every song on the album, which is unusual because normally there is a least a few songs on albums I have to skip past, but this is one I would totally skip too dispite loving all the songs!<br />The last three tracks are spanish versions of other songs, all great, and knowing spanish myself, I prefer these songs to the English versions<BR>11. Escape (Spanish)<BR>12. Don't Turn Off the Lights (Spanish)<BR>13. Hero (Spanish)
B00004Z459|4.0|If you like Limp bisket, then this cd is probably for you. It is cool how they mix rock and rap togther. This is a good thing to listen to if you don't like boybands or Britney, Christina A., etc.
B000002LK1|5.0|Violator was Depeche Mode's best-selling album and is considered one of the best(if not the best) selling electronic albums of all time. But labeling the music &quot;electronic&quot; throws it in a confining category. Martin Gore is truly one of this century's best songwriters. The lyrics are sad, sensual, honest, and very moving. Critics who say electronic music can't bring forth emotions need to listen to this record. Tracks like &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot;, &quot;Blue Dress&quot;, and &quot;World in My Eyes&quot; still give me chills..and I bought this album when it was released over a decade ago. This isn't just a great electronic album, it is one of the best albums of all time. If you are new to Depeche Mode, this is an amazing introduction. It'll become one of your favorites.
6305291446|1.0|Although birdwatching would be more interesting - in fact - doing anything would be more interesting than watching this godforsaken piece of filth.  I would rather inflict bodily harm to loved ones rather than make them watch this movie.  I want to sue whoever is responsible for creating this thing for stealing time from away from me.  I actually went to the theatre to be subjected to this... this...  torture!  I'm sure everyone involved in the movie are horribly ashamed of themselves.  I'll sum it up like so:  It was not scary at all - I couldn't imagine a five year old being even slightly disturbed (wasn't this marketed as a horror movie?) It had a terrible plot.  The acting was pure drivel.  LL Cool J miraculously survives - why???  It seems as though the dialogue was written by a 10 year old boy who has led a sheltered life.  Boring.  The movie was a long bore fest that continually disappointed scene after scene.  I am appalled that there are people who actually gave this movie a high rating.  My only guess is that someone who receives proceeds from the sales of the DVD has been writing &quot;spiked&quot; reviews.  I hope this review gets out so that no one else profits from this utterly worthless movie.
B00004WG2F|5.0|This is truly a gripping movie with beautiful cinematography that will take your breath away. I avoided this movie for a long time, thinking of Brad Pitt as another &quot;pretty boy&quot; flash in the pan actor, but I have really grown to hold a lot of respect for him the past few years, and so I finally rented it. Then I had to buy it. The romantic plot is almost secondary to the story of the three brothers and the father who learn what family and brotherhood is really about. My only criticism is that they should have gotten a better actress for the lead female role.
0060278234|5.0|This is one of the best books i have read. It was quite dissappointing though when you get to the end and find out you have to get the 3rd book \\"Abhorsen.\\" I would deffintley reccomend these books to a person who enjoys adventure and mystery.
0684803356|5.0|My third Hemingway book. I had been intimidated by it for a while (mostly by reputation), tackling his smaller, less dense works instead. Finally I picked it up and never regretted it. It took me a while to get through the middle section, but once I got through that I couldn't put it down. While on vacation in Chicago, I even took it with me and read while at a bar with friends. Every book I've read since pales in comparison.
B00006LI4S|5.0|as always Dave has shown us his talent again. very good piece of work, comprable to his first solo release.Having worked with Floyd from the early 70's thru the wall tour ,i spent many hours listening to shows,sound checks and rehearsals and they are the ultimate professional band.They worked very hard to achieve what they have and Dave is a big part of it.He insists they do it right or dont do it at all.Roger is a literary genius and could easliy have been a writer.However arent we pleased he chose the path he did? will they ever play together again? You can bet on it,although it wont be straight away.Honestly now with Rick on keyboards and Nick on drums,they are thee best there is.How many bands can you name that sound just as good live as in the studio?
B00003CXA6|4.0|&quot;Gettysburg&quot; is the movie adaptation of Michael Sharra's book &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; winner of the Pulitzer Prize.  The film is well acted, especially the roles played by Martin Sheen, Tom Berenger, and Jeff Daniels.  As with most movies, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; cannot possibly capture the essence of the characters and the true emotion that the book so eloquently describes.  Director Ron Maxwell probably knew this going in, but chose to tackle the events, people, and emotions of the battle anyway.  He must be credited for the attempt, as it demonstrates a great courage in filmmaking.  What &quot;Gettysburg&quot; does is tries it's best to to communicate all of these events and emotions, and it comes through more often than not.  I've both read the book and watched the film several times, and I notice that Mr. Maxwell seems to capture more and more every time I watch it.  Particularly fascinating is Robert E. Lee's character (Sheen) and that of General Longstreet (Berenger) as they struggle to grapple with the historic implications of the decision to fight, and the consequences of the horrible losses they suffer.  The most stirring part of the film is the depiction of Col. Chamberlain's (Daniels) Maine troops defending Little Round Top on the second day of the battle.  Only the book, the movie, and actually visiting Little Round Top have put into perspective the savage fighting that took place there.  Kudos to Mr. Maxwell, and a film worth seeing.
B000008COG|3.0|This album is about half good, half bad. The lyrics are by far the worst part of it. While, this album is an improvement over FLY ON THE WALL, they still could have done better. Released in January of 1988, BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO gives AC/DC a polished sound with the traditional guitar work. The album gets off to a great start with the fast \\"Heatseeker\\" and then the catchy \\"That's The Way I Wanna Rock N' Roll.\\" Easily the best songs on the album, it begins to slide a little after that. \\"Meanstreak\\" has a hilarious beat to it, but the guitar riffs in the middle of the song are great. \\"Go Zone\\" is my favorite song on the album, despite the horrid lyrics. \\"Kissin' Dynamite\\" isn't bad, but the second side of the album takes a turn for the worse. \\"Nick of Time\\" is lowsy, and \\"Some Sin For Nuthin'\\" has to be one of their worst songs ever. \\"Ruff Stuff\\" has a typical late-80's melody to it, and isn't bad, but \\"Two's Up\\" is bad, and \\"This Means War\\" is not a good way to close out the album. <br />Brian Johnson's voice sounds as if it synthesized here. This does make the album somewhat unique, but to hear him sing lines such as \\"Gotta have my candy... I'm gonna give you a treat\\" doesn't really show much originality. <BR>AC/DC would get back on track shortly after this album. Drummer Simon Wright would leave, and be replaced by Chris Slade. The band would then hit it big with THE RAZOR'S EDGE.
B00006HBUA|4.0|Die hard fans who grew up on Scooby Doo will be disappointed in the portrayals of Fred, Velma and Daphne.  I think they will be happy with the two start thou. Shaggy is so dead on it's scary and the CGI animators did a great job on Scooby (& the monsters).<br />But,if you don't hum the theme song in your sleep, have an I hate Scrappy web site or know Shaggy's real name then you will probably like the movie.  My four year old loves it and watches it over and over.  Even the spouse has sat through it a few times.  The monsters are scary enough to be menancing but not so much to cause nightmares.  All in all, despite a few short comings, a very good family movie.
0767819462|1.0|Stepmom (Chris Columbus, 1998)<br />It's probably considered at least a venial sin in America to criticize Columbus, who's bookended his directorial career with two of the biggest blockbusters ever to hit a big screen, Home Alone and the Harry Potter franchise. But let's face it. Home Alone was pure unadulterated emotionally manipulative schlock. The guy's made his mark directing the kinds of teen comedies John Hughes wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole (and Hughes even wrote Home Alone. One wonders why he didn't direct...). With Stepmom, Columbus has all the schlock with none of the cuteness of the child actors. Not that said cuteness ever made his films watchable previously.<br />There is only one actress in Hollywood who can make Julia Roberts look like she can act, and that is the detestable Susan Sarandon. While Sarandon has been nausea-inducing in a number of roles, this one goes above and beyond the call of duty. Sarandon's character, Jackie Harrison, is the ex-wife of hapless Luke (Ed Harris, showing once and for all that no matter how good an actor you are, if the script makes you look like an idiot, you will look like an idiot). She can't stand Luke's new girlfriend, Isabel (Roberts), and for that matter can't seem to stand much of anyone, including her own kids. Jackie is as loathsome a creature as the average viewer, and most non-average viewers, will ever want to meet. Were she male, she'd be on the Lifetime Movie network in a wifebeater T-shirt, throwing beer cans at the football game and smacking the kids around, and everyone would hate her. But she's female, and she's in a Chris Columbus movie, and so we're supposed to sympathize. (Oh, and to make sure we do, not far into the film she's diagnosed with cancer. Because that's an excuse to be [a jerk].)<br />Julia Roberts has only managed one decent role in her career, and that (Flatliners) lay in the strength of the rest of the cast. The fact that she can be singled out here because of the weakness of the cast around her says volumes. I could easily go on for another half-hour about the painfully overdramatized script, the shameless attempts at emotional manipulation throughout, the pedestrian camerawork, and the fact that, even though he's working with adults, Chris Columbus is still directing teen feel-good-because-everyone-bonds movies. But there are so many more deserving things to give bad reviews to out there I can't justify spending any more time on this painfully bad piece of dreck. (zero)the cast around her says volumes.

B000003KMM|4.0|No, you're not going to walk away from this movie thinking about how to achieve world peace or end poverty, but you will be walking away with a smile.  MAJOR LEAGUE is a lighthearted, entertaining film that also happens to be hysterically funny.  Throw the great sport of baseball into the mix and MAJOR LEAGUE is a win/win for those who love the game and those who just want to have a good laugh.<br />There's nothing complicated about the plot.  When an aggressive femme fatale (Margaret Whitton) inherits the Cleveland Indians from her late husband, her plan is to put together a team so bad it will lose its fan base and allow her to relocate.  And so a band of misfits is put together:  washed-up players, inexperienced players, headcases.  Of course, predictably, her plan goes awry, but it's still good fun watching the antics of the Indians as they misfire and then come together over a long, long season.<br />Tom Berenger, Charlie Sheen, Rene Russo, Corbin Bernsen, and Wesley Snipes headline a great cast.  Bob Uecker is absolutely hysterical.  My favorite character is manager Lou Brown (James Gammon) who delivers the film's funniest line, but one I dare not repeat here (it would never get past the editors)!  Grab a hot dog and a beer, pull up a chair, and let MAJOR LEAGUE put a wide grin on your face.
B00005UEAR|4.0|a fantastic album about mental illness and inner-turmoil.  a quasi-concept album emcompasing 2 discs of sometimes heavy, sometimes ballad-like, prog-rock music at it's finest.<br />the worst thing i could say about this album is that it doesn't hold a candle to dream theater's previous release &quot;metropolis part 2: scenes from a memory,&quot; but then again, that album is a tough act to follow.  this album is outstanding in it's own right.  with songs about alcoholism, memories of war, depression, and even the debate over stem cell research, it's a dark album.  but sure doesn't lack in musical ability, just like any other dream theater offering.  <br />if you're a fan of dream theater, and you haven't picked up this album yet, why not?!?  it should be a part of your collection.  and if you're not familiar w/ the band, but are just looking for some good prog-rock music, you can't go wrong here.  &quot;six degrees of inner turbulence&quot; is an album that you can't go wrong with, and belongs in any fan of good music's collection.  you won't be dissapointed.
B00005QIPH|5.0|this is the best cd ever<br />every song is amazing
B000021XS0|5.0|pink floyd's &quot;the wall.&quot;  the who's &quot;tommy.&quot;  queensryche's &quot;operation: mindcrime.&quot;  and dream theater's &quot;metropolis part 2: scenes from a memory.&quot;  what do all these albums have in common?  there all outstanding works, by outstanding bands, that tell a story.  but how does this recording differ from the aforementioned?  simple.  each member of this band has more musical talent and ability in their pinky toe than all the other bands have completely.  combined.  is that to say this album is better?  not neccissarily.  it's just that the music is so much more complex, intricate, and well-played.  and it's a darn-good story.<br />i'm not going to get into the story behind the album.  it's much too complicated, conviluted (too a fault) and deep for me to explain in limited space.  suffice it to say, dream theater is one of, if not the best, prog-rock bands of today.  and this album is their best.  i don't think many fans of dream theater would argue with that.  the musicianship is amazing.  it has to be heard to believe.  if you like bands such as rush, pink floyd, queensryche, genesis, and other's of that ilk, look into dream theater.  they may not be &quot;better&quot; bands, but no doubt, they are certainly more talented.  and again, this is just simply a fantastic album.
B000006045|5.0|This cd must be one of the best that I own. It's definitely a must-have for any real trip hop freak out there. The first time I listened to this cd, I fell in love -- with Massive Attack and the Trip Hop genre as a whole. If you havent heard them yet, give em a whirl. Definitely a tasty piece of musical history. You wont be disappointed with the listen.
0812550706|5.0|it's a book about kids (and specifically, one in particular), but the meaning, the truths, the larger ideas, go far beyond that of books written for kids.  this is a novel that adults will enjoy just as much, and maybe more so, than kids will.  because while it focuses on children, the concepts of the book include such \\"adult\\" themes as war, superior intelligence, social interaction, inner-turmoil, and moral confliction.<br />\\"ender's game\\" is the story of ender wiggin, a child genius who, like so many other child geniuses, is raised and trained for one sole purpose: to defeat an alien species who would otherwise destroy earth and all of humanity.<br />without going into too much plot detail (for this is a story that's best \\"discovered\\" as you read, and not to be given away at all), ender is one of thousands of children who are hand-picked as being the brightest children humanity has to offer.  these children, at ages as young as five, are sent to the outer space battle school, where they spend several years training to weed out \\"just the best,\\" so that the \\"best of the best\\" may continue their education to find the one who will someday become the supreme commander in the war against \\"the buggers.\\"  training consists of mock battles in a huge, zero gravity \\"battle room,\\" where armies face off against each other.<br />but this story is SO much more than kids and war games.  ender wiggins is one of the most complex characters a book has been centered on.  and he's a kid, for goodness sake!  what is it about ender that makes him stand above his genius peers?  what does he possess, that many others don't?  and how will he fare when the administrators of the battle school, who see so much in him, put more responsibility on his shoulders than any human being, let alone one who's only a child, should ever have to endure?<br />the writing is fantastic.  the characters are fleshed out extremely well.  multiple plot lines are given their due justice, and woven together in a way that advaces the central plot, and makes sense to the whole of the book.  this is truly one of those books that's hard to put down- it just keeps climaxing and climaxing, and with a stellar, super-surprise ending, leaves you satisfied and wishing for more.<br />\\"ender's game\\" is not just sci-fi.  it's a study of human psychology.  of war.  of love and hate.  of survival.  it's an outstanding read that i can highly reccomend to anyone, regardless of age or reading interests.  the best praise i can give this book is that, i feel i've just wasted 10 minutes of my life trying to review it, because words cannot do it justice... and one more thing: just read it.  it is a fantastic story, and you WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.  this is definately one for the ages.
B00005N9CV|2.0|The producers of this album should be ashamed. They have taken a great vocalist and great jazz pianist and buried both under the London Symphony or worse. Suitable for the elevator but not for a jazz/pop collection. What a waste!
B000021YQV|5.0|It highly irritates me when people bash records or bands just because they have finally gotten some airplay or have become popular. Many of these reader reviews that say Toxicity is such a horrible album say so because songs like \\"Chop Suey!\\" or \\"Aerials\\" have gotten so much airplay. ... This is fantastically written and produced (another no-no to these hardcore fanatics). They are still very political, even in the song \\"Bounce\\". The meaning of \\"Bounce\\" is just a bit hidden. I'm not going to tell you directly of the meaning, but i'll give you some hints. \\"She has so many friends/went through many hands\\". <BR>SO... to these people who bash Toxicity purely for the reason that it has become extremely successful, I say to thee... ...
B000084T18|5.0|This is one of the best cds i have heard in my life. this is one of the few cds i can put in and press play and let it play without skiping tracks. if i could i would give it 20 stars
B00007KWI9|5.0|This version of the debut sounds lot better than the one remastered by Atlantic. Rhino records is a great company to have reissues of you're favorite classic music groups. The music of the debut sounds good but dosen't really sound progressive rock at that time, they would however sound prog rock when &quot;The Yes Album&quot; came out. I recommend this re-issue for a start of a collection.
B0000797IO|3.0|This film about a bored and desparate working wife's descent into hell is done in the style of the Coen brothers. In fact, it reminded me quite a bit of \\"Raising Arizona\\". The supporting cast is tremendous, and Jennifer Aniston performed well above my expectations. The plot is well constructed. The pacing, I think intentionally slow to reflect the miserable sameness of Justine's life, makes it easier for us to understand her plight. Thematically, the film is a bit irritating. Justine is responsible for all sorts of mayhem, but doesn't seem too concerned about the havoc she's wreaking, except in terms of how it's going to affect her. In the end, you would expect her to be behind bars, not living happily ever after.
B00005JLKB|4.0|It's not cable, It's local television. And it is a very intriguing look into the young life of Superman that I think relates to more teens than Do-me Creek or Fa-sleep-with-city. This first season is unbelievably edge pushing and ground breaking with it's cool combonation of special effects and dramatic story telling. I personally think this show has done wonders for the comic book world along with Spiderman and X-men in theaters. It is good to see that the worlds youthful imagination and creativity are growing in order to include hip new versions of their childhood heroes. The only thing I would have to disagree with is the way in which they just throw a bad guy in there in 4 to 5 minutes of the show while the rest is crushed under the sex blanket of Clark and Lana, who by the way is not the sister he ends up with so stop insulting the audiences intellegence.
B000003S5H|5.0|I've owned this album since it's release and have recently begun listening to it again.  I'm essentially writing because I am amazed as how well this music has held up over time; it's just so masterfully done.
B00006RG9K|4.0|This DVD isn't perfect, but true fans of Genesis should enjoy it immensely.  Unfortunately, we have little else in the way of Genesis concert footage to compare to, so we HAVE to like it!It's tough for a band that has as much material as Genesis to decide what they can play in a two hour set.  Obviously the focus is on late 80's and early 90's releases, which means they don't have much time to spend on the old stuff.  Those of us who saw them in the late 70's will want SO much more of Squonk, Dance..., The Lamb, The Musical Box, etc.  These were truly awe inspiring live compositions, and it is a shame they only included them in a medley.  We can only hope for the future!<br />Also slightly disappointing is the sound quality.  For the band that was so creative with deep bass in their early years, this recording is fairly thin.  There is virtually no sub woofer track despite the 5.1 label and the volume in surround sound mode bonces up and down annoyingly.  I even tried two copies, because I figured mine was defective!<br />The good news is that the band is SO tight live.  Their renditions of studio tracks are accurate to the original and yet still different enough so they don't feel canned.  Chester Thompson and Darryl Stuermer are technically solid, and fill out the sound enormously on stage.  Mike Rutherford is a decent enough guitar player, but the hard stuff seems to be left to Stuermer.  Tony Banks never seems ruffled, and sometimes you wonder if he is really enjoying himself, or just going through the motions.  His song writing and keyboard skills are unquestioned, however.<br />Phil is the consumate showman, dancing, telling jokes, and playing drums.  His duet with Chester is definitely a highlight of the DVD.  Phil seems to really enjoy his time behind the drums best, and it's the only time he really gets lost in the music.  The light and video show are pretty good as well.<br />I would highly recommend this DVD to any hard core Genesis fan as well as those who discovered them in the 80's when they became more commercial.  There's good stuff here for all.  And for the old timers - please give us a &quot;Second's Out&quot; DVD!!
B00005YW4H|3.0|She does not have a voice of her own, nor does she have a sound that she can say is uniquely her's.  Check out the self titled<BR>CD 'Once Blue', back from 1995, from when Norah was 14? 15? years old.  <br />I find it ridiculous she such the rage when I've heard her style EIGHT years ago.<br />Once Blue's much better.
6305014140|5.0|This is a Japanese Animation Classic in my town.  Ghost in a Shell and Ninja Scroll rule over dusty stuff like Akira.  Ghost in a Shell is flashy and futuristic and Ninja Scroll is mystic and what you could call a teazer into studying japanese history and culture.<br />Like with all japanese animation you have to realise that you are watching something written by people from another culture.  Ninja Scroll definatly has it's universal apeal, but if you can't handle forighn films, you'll probably have difficulty likeing Ninja Scroll.<br />I rate this movie five stars, I thought it was great.  The wandering ronin/ninja, the mysterious overshadowing evil, the unusual cast of villans all add up to a great movie.  No not for kids but then you knew that allready.  It's deffinatly grittier than your average american cartoon.  It has an edge to it something that might make more sense once you get into japanisma and the whole culture.<br />The bible belt christian set probably won't get this stuff.
0316666343|3.0|I did not like the book at all. I found it very hard to understand in some places. I could not understand the wording the author chose to use. I found myself having to read the same sentences over twice to get the meaning of what the author was saying. I still did not get it every time.<br />A young girl who has been murdered tells the story. She is telling her story from heaven as she watches her family and friends continue their lives after her death. This part I could accept because it was shear fantasy and imagination<BR>.
