B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I LOVE this show! It is a fascinating study of cults and their followers. The show is fast paced and packed with scenes that are edge-of-your-seat suspenseful. The characters are dynamic, the writing is brilliant, the acting is exceptional, and each episode ends with me dying to see what happens next. It is for adults only as it has scenes with graphic violence.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I first played this game on the I-Pad. I am so glad that I found it...I can play this for hours...and I have...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a lot of fun.  I have played several escape games after this one but enjoyed this one the most.
B004HYHANK|2.0|Repetitive, trying too hard; and she goes to great lengths to describe the descent of one of the characters into quite horrible behavior, then goes nowhere with it.  I woon't bother with any more by this author.
B009NY43NY|2.0|It wasn't that great... Not a whole lot happened, not what I expected out of the LAST one. Some of the writing seemed awkward and like the author just didn't care...
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I did not realize that you had to play with others on social network.  That is definately not for me.  What a waste.  It just sits on my kindle waiting to be deleted  mew
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Paul (Unrated & Theatrical Versions) (2011) was extremely funny. I enjoyed the humor & story line & will probably watch again.
B004ZMWUCU|2.0|the ending was completely rushed. It ruined the story for me. I liked the characters and the story line but not the ending.
0765325950|5.0|I really loved the series and was happy to get it when I did. Was really great and would definitely recommend it to fellow readers
B001NLKZUA|5.0|The action and suspense continue in this book about the Shadowhunters. This thoroughly enjoyable tale almost makes you feel a part of the circle of friends that are battling against the odds.
B0015AARJI|5.0|It was pretty reasonably priced. I needed another controller and got it quickly. I was very happy with my purchase.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This continuation of A City of Ashes and The City of Bones is a page turner. I couldn't put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app!  Calculator is HUGE and there is no way you are going to hit the wrong key.  Awesome app to get and a breeze to use on your Kindle when you have to balance your checkbook!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is well written. The plot is well developed and draws one in. As the book progressed I found I couldn't put it down. The character development is also well done. A very enjoyable tale!
0812982622|5.0|I actually listened to the book on audio and loved it.  Later when to a blog of someone who had traveled to North Korea as part of a delegation and found striking similarities.  Chilling reminder of how reality is defined by those in authority, if we allow it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Takes a second to learn but once you do it is a blast.  Already bought the expansion so we can expand our board.
1451695195|5.0|I bought this book because I recently loss my husband and he also was a Doctor. It has really Help me.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Love POTC, came quickly in good condition. Not much else to say other than it is worth it. Not much to say about a cd
0345803485|5.0|I had the 2nd and 3rd book, so all I needed was the first one. It came quickly and I love it. Now I have all 3 to read over and over.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|bit of a tear jerker but interesting subject matter and, more importantly, how the subject of euthanastia was dealt with on a survivor level.
B009WUBERW|5.0|if you like action and fun you will like this flick. It is pretty funny and much of the movie is quite preposterous
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|This is a great documentary that every music fan should watch.<br />Sound City studios really is a legendary that will be part of music history.<br />Stop reading and go watch it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love hidden objects games but this one does not have a clear way to progress in the game. I like the theme
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I can't stop playing. It's so addictive lol... I blame my son. I just wish I can get more disc to play...
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Something different from the usual bond movies. There is plenty of action, but it feels more &#34;western&#34; than a british spy movie.
B008Y6YCB0|1.0|It was a bad choice on my part. I don't care for period pieces. Even Paltrow couldn't make it palatable.
B003U4ZU7Q|4.0|Okay... where do I begin? I watched the entire LOST series from June of this year and just finished the final episode today. In a way the ending was pretty sensible. I enjoyed the show for what it was... a mixture of multiple genres with characters almost anyone can relate to. No one is perfect. No ending is perfect but this one did make sense. The ending leaves me satisfied but if there are any prequel stories in the works as a novel or otherwise I'd definitely like to see this universe explored some more. Heck maybe DHARMA has some more crazy antics somewhere else. ;)
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great fun game & very addicting.  I don't think a day goes by that I don't play for at least an hour.  My husband plays too & we're having great fun.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|When I went to the movies to see the Bourne Legacy, I was totally lost.  However, I'm glad I gave it a second chance because once I really understood what was going on (and admitted to myself that Jason Bourne was NOT the main character) I opened my mind to the story line and totally loved Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross. Great addition to my collection!
B00594XOZU|4.0|On this app its a good, fast texting app. But there is a few issues, like how you cannot use kik cards, or view others. And thats pretty dissapointing. Another is is how you cannot change your name. I tried to change my name and within 5 seconds the app shut down. But other than those 2 issues this app is amazing! Here, text me hcr_luv
B008MM9630|5.0|Fun, handsome, not dependent on neighbors, and very easy to get gems (you can get them by using magic words other users post on the fairy farm facebook page, but be quick! they expire)
B00CF2UORK|4.0|My son is 3 and he loves this and Timmy Time. Glad it is on amazon prime!  The episodes are 30 min each which is good to help limit the time per day he is watching tv.
0062235893|5.0|Perfect gift for a newborn.  Very soft and cuddly - baby will enjoy the book for a very long time.  Great present.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This is a pattern game. You're supposed to figure out the pattern code to pass each level.<br />It's not a difficult game to learn. My daughter enjoyed it more than I did.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|This is a move for the whole family to enjoy.  We have watched it at least 4 times.  I have suggested it to my daughter.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|The script is not new, although it was awesome to see how a new lawyer can really suffer in a courthouse. At the end, think if that should be the only outcome possible. It makes sense, a little bit shocking though, not only in terms of the case, but also in terms of his life choices.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's fun and entertaining. It's a puzzle in every level. It k<br />eeps you on your toes. Definitely worth the download.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My sis likes it I don't but It makes her happy so I keep it for her other wise I would delete it
B002MCYWHG|5.0|The WeeRide Kangaroo Child Bike Seat is awesome!  It was easy to mount on my Giant XL bike and I have had no problems with it and my 19 month old daughter loves riding up-front.  The only problem I experienced was with the hex head bolts. The bolts were to short after mounting the brackets on. Even after removing the bracket inserts. Other than this, it is a great device.
B001223BLU|5.0|Downloaded the Album last week, as they are playing in my area, but wasn't able to get tickets. The Album contained every song that they ever made, more than I expected.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME!!!  I PLAY EVERYDAY!!!  SO VERY ADDICTING!!!  NO WAY YOU CAN KEEP AWAY FROM THIS APP ONCE YOU GET STARTED!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|sometimes I like it and sometimes I don't. If you like to watch a bunch of high powered lawyers stab each other in the back...then you will like it. Oh, and of course they have pretty assistants.....did you think they wouldn't?
B00992CF6W|4.0|It was my first paid app and it was totally worth 6.99. It is really fun I have had my kindle since Christmas I got this in January and played it since but I give it 4 stars only because of the fact, ever since it came to the appstore, many other people try to copy it for .99  and trap people otherwise 5 stars
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I tried buying cheap wires before, and they all sucked.  This one has a tight fit, didn't take long to come in, and works great on my  different devices.
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|This is a solid movie.  Might not necessarily need to be seen on Blu ray.  If you are a stat geek like me, make sure you read Michael Lewis's book first.  This movie is just a more dramatized/Hollywood version of the movie.  Some of the interviews and extras on the Blu ray are worth it though for a true baseball fan.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Not much to say. Bad story, bad action, bad acting.<br /><br />Matrix it is not. The characters are obvious. The plot is a mess. It is so simple, yet so bad.<br /><br />I mean wow.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have had this app thru many updates and my Yahoo email much longer. I like the scrolling and that almost all the regular desktop site functions are available. However, almost half the time I try to use the app it will not do all these functions. I can open my inbox and scroll, if I'm lucky I can open an actual email! I may not load new messages and forget searching or composing a new message. I don't know what the deal is, but the developers really need to work on consistency.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I just uploaded the pic-shop photo editor and pic-shop lite.  Can't figure it out. Is there some way to get directions on how to use it?
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I absolutely love NCIS and season 10 didn't disappoint. It's well worth the five stars! Most show's tend to get boring after a short time but this show seems to just get better and better.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|Another Bruce Willis action packed movie that is high on the special effects and very light on the story line.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is so awesome, but you have to pay money for gems and stuff. I play this game every single day when I have the chance.<br />It's the best game ever!
B0081336FO|4.0|A good series with a fun 21st century twist on this classic. I have no trouble with the liberties in production, but I have gotten lost more than a few times.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok so thanks people who made this happen and to the team that made splash text yay to you btw why is there only one word????anyway thank you
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great product. Very realistic. I love it and horses deal you should've this app<br />You will like it so try this fabulous game what do you say Will you give it a shoot
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Is app is good if you need a good laugh. I really liked it. It is just like getting on line.
B0090XG9T4|5.0|This is it.  The compendium of everything that made MGM the top studio for decades (shame Fox releases much MGM product today but this is a Warners release from the library that Kokorian sold to our neighbor in Gadsden County, Ted Turner in the worst deal in history (for MGM that is).  Warner has done this one up very well as would be expected.  Thank Turner that it wasn't a Fox release.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm completely hooked on this show. The costumes are gorgeous and the actors draw you right in with their superb performances. I had a dinner party last night and teased my guests that I had been tempted to hire a butler and staff because I had been watching too much Downton!
B004IFYMWK|5.0|I recall this story when it occurred some years back but with no details nor background to balance the message against I felt I was missing a key piece to the puzzle. This re-creation and excellent performances provided the needed background along with the hope that while painful, only through honest discourse will we as a society progress forward with our heads held high even after failures....
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Great way to get people started thinking about what their choices have meant for the living of their lives. I would recommend this book as a general way to get started on the path.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The uh... Control issues and codependency were hard to swallow. I went through a similar relationship and it was horrible! I am so glad that Abby and Travis had a happy ending, so many don't!
1449410243|5.0|I can only read a small part at a time because this book is so funny I just break up laughing so hard.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|With the exception of foul language, we loved this movie.  Actors embraced their characters well.  The story was totally engaging.
0385347774|5.0|An excellent read with lots of interesting twists.  The characters are complex.  The plot is unusual.  The ending unexpected. You will enjoy the book.
014312336X|5.0|I thought the book was a page turner....Intrigue and suspense and excellent narrative. Good character building and well done. adele rosen
B006S086AM|2.0|The snl members are barely seen in the movie for how heavily they are promoted.poor representation of the 80's and the soundtrack is a potpourri of forgettable music.go off on an adventure in another land.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I bought this Kindle book to read on vacation. I couldn't put it down.  It's a great piece of literature.
B000SEI230|5.0|I really love the Nicholas Sparks books I can sit down and read them in one day!! But I just wish that they were all prime books.
B00884GR0W|5.0|can Mind Blocks make enemy's and Ally's mob fight echother,any ways the app is great I recomemd it so have.fun playing it:)
076792603X|5.0|This is a very good historical novel. It makes you think of what may be possible. You do need to keep an open mind as you read it.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|It's great, Daniel Day Louis is amazing as Lincoln. If you love Lincoln you will love this movie, it's great to see the movie was well done.
B0054SMID0|4.0|Couldn't sleep and this was my penance. Surprisingly clever and, i have to admit, i like mc.Conaughey acting. I was hoping it would put me to sleep and i stayed awake til the end. Worth the rental!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|amazing it really keeps me busy my. brother loves it. I will say that this app is so five star worthy and its free
0399159347|4.0|At first glance, this book seems to be simply a good beach read.  But, by the end of the book, the reader realizes this novel is a lot more than a summer page turner.  The story gives rise to some very interesting and thoughtful questions and themes.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I saw this movie in the theater and loved it!  I liked it this also.  I recommend that the Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and Hulk movies be watched first.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|The acting and scenery continue to be outstanding, but there were just too many instances of people behaving in ways that were impossible to believe.  And the final plot twist at the end of the last episode really pissed me off -- I felt like I was being messed with by the writer.
B00947N6UG|5.0|I am a 31 year old man that does enjoy the animated films that have humor to be interpreted for any age. The previews and commercials for this film did not do it justice. When I saw them, I wrote them off to yet another holiday-themed kid's film with seemingly no real story-line. Since it came to HBO, I gave it a shot one afternoon. I'll sum it up in three words - \\"I WAS WRONG!\\" This film completely blew me away. The characters and storyline were incredible and well imagined. There is an underlying theme of believe in the good of other people, and the film portrayed that in a very touching way. One of my favorite concepts is that our childhood memories are saved in our teeth. Once the tooth fairy takes them, her fairies keep them and remind us of those memories when we need them most. I don't normally take the time to write reviews for movies, but I felt I needed to for this one. I've since watched it THREE times! I was disappointed that the movie studios have written it off as a failure due to box office results. Again, I blame this on the advertising. My recommendation is to see it, and I guarantee you'll want to watch it again. Hopefully, there will be enough interest in the after-release that the studios may reconsider a sequel.
0783225482|5.0|I love the actors cast in this movie!  They keep you laughing thru out the movie!  I am so glad I made this purchase!  :)
B009RX8MQ0|4.0|This show is so soapy you could wash your hands with it. Then your body.  Then you could put a little in your hair for a nice shampoo.  That being said, it's entertaining into the bargain as long as you accept and anticipate the cheese factor. Which I do. My favorite character is Victoria Grayson. An ice queen, yes, but she's quite lovely even in her advanced years.  As for Emily Thorne, vengeant bunny, well, I guess there wouldn't be much of a plot without her, though I kind of think she should just marry Daniel, who is really a much nicer guy than Brit stud Aiden, who's kind of an arrogant fool in spite of \\"being on the right team\\".  Daniel on the other hand, in addition to having a beautiful mother and a ruthless yet witty father, is really not guilty of any of the crimes of his parents.  I think Emily should finish up her revenge on the parents and then go settle down with Daniel somewhere.  I suppose Jack might be ok as well, but I think Daniel deep down is still more Emily's speed when all is said and done.  Too bad she's wasted so much time on that goofball Aiden. I'm sure she'll start up on Jack in the next season.  Who knew Emily would have so many lovers into the bargain of her revenge.<br /><br />Once in Paris, she and Daniel could get into television and do a \\"Baywatch\\" for the next millenium.  Or Emily could open a karate school.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so awesome! My little brothers love this game! It has age specification to make it suitable for specific ages!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was just so cool I got to have my own horse and everything.I loved how the game just got better and better as I got further in the game!
B004Q7IAQE|5.0|My sister's birthday was a few weeks ago, and since she loves Hello Kitty I decided to order her this. It arrived on time, and it was much bigger than I had expected. She absolutely loved it and sleeps with it every night now! Absolutely perfect!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|This movie is bizarre, raunchy, and downright weird. An absolute classic that will have you doing the Time Warp again...and again. I can't get enough.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I love this game. It is so entertaining! The only thing I'd like to request is to make a version that includes being able to get an order and make the hair look the way the person wants it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Greatest site ever!  This app has a lot of glitches for the kindle fire though. I just scream and restart. I get about 20 minutes of fun then it almost always kicks me out. It can be frustrating.I love it so much though that it is worth screaming and restarting. Give it a try. If you find that you cannot stand the huge glitches just erase. It is free. I love the constant entertainment and information.  Be patient.restarting takes a few seconds.don't let the terrible app ruin the experience.<br />It is worth it!
0984725113|5.0|I like the book very much, so much that I am having a group in my home to read and comment.  The author's present/current or the first side of the chessboard is superb.  His recommendations sadly lacking.
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|My 3 year old granddaughter loves watching this.  She's been a fan of &#34;Sofia the First&#34; since the series first started airing on Cable.  Of course, a couple weeks after I bought this, the same movie came out on Cable for free but that's okay because I got it for her on DVD so she can watch it on car trips.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|The moment the album starts you can tell something has changed in the world of Queens of the Stone Age. Its darker, more mature, and comes from a place much deeper in the musicians and namely from Josh. The opening track Keep Your Eyes Peeled is this dark blues things that packs some amazing dynamics while throughout encompassing a constant blistering rhythm. Then the break down goes to something you might here in a castle in a Zelda game. Its a great \\"I've got shit to take care of\\" kind of song. The second track gives long term fans a taste of the signature QOTSA sound. It picks up the feeling of the album and is great for the flow of the album. The third track The Vampyre of Time and Memory is much darker and slower going. Its subject matter is something that everyone feels in their life but I have never heard it put so eloquently. This is the theme song for questioning your life as you age. The fourth track If I Had a Tail is a strange track that kicks it back up. Its one of the most catchy songs on the album. Its raw and makes me wish I was an animal. Number 5 My God is the Sun was the first radio track. It took some time to grow on me but the diverse rhythms and Dave Grohl playing really does add to this straight up rock song. It does remind you a little of Songs for the Deaf with much more powerful sound. Track 6 Kalopsia is a strange flowy track with a mouthy rebellious chorus with help from Trent Rezner. Track 7 Fariweather has a multitude of musicians including Sir Elton but after listening to it hundreds of times I still don't know what to think of it. Not bad or good just different. Smooth Sailing kicks it back up with a groove with help from a Scissor Sister. It is adolescent and dirty sounding. Lets have a kiki! I Appear Missing takes us back down the path the album started on. Its dark but more upbeat then Vampyre. A kind of final questioning reflecting which is telling of where Josh Homme was when he wrote the album. Great dynamics on this track!. Andfinally ...Like Clockwork ties the whole album together venturing away from anything we have ever heard from QOTSA. Telling the listener that life is different and ever changing, this album is different, and every moment that passes cannot be fully recaptured. If you don't like the slow stuff hold on because there is a great jam in this song.<br /><br />Overall, this is my go to album of Summer 2013 and maybe longer. It is a fantastic journey. If you are a long term fan I suggest you listen. This album is musically and lyrically more inspiring than most other attempts at keeping this genre alive at the current time.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie I like all the actors will watch it again. I love to watch Robert Downey Movie.  i i
140006922X|5.0|This highly readable account of Jesus as a man before he was turned into a god by his followers is not for the faithful. As a former Catholic who came to see the Bible as just another set of myths, I was fascinated by Aslan's pulling away the curtain to reveal the sources behind the making of the myths.  Not having read other histories of Jesus I cannot say if Aslan's ideas are new. It doesn't matter. What matters is that I learned great deal about the times in which Jesus lived and how he fit into those times without the dogma that defies reality.<br /><br />Because Aslan presents his arguments in such an accessible manner he is criticized.  That is a shame. Scholars hate popular histories.  Yes, popular history can simplify complex stories but scholarly history is just as guilty of bias and misrepresenting the facts.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to those who were \\"raised on the good book Jesus but have read between the lines\\" to paraphrase Laura Nyro.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Excellent as are all the Lynne Olson books.  This one may go a bit more slowly than the ones about wartime Britain, but her<br />conclusions and &#34;what ifs&#34; are stunning and somewhat frightening  food for thought.  Did Pearl Harbor really save us?
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is amazing! Easy to understand and navigate. Super fast, very easy for us technology challenged individuals as it give suggestions, reasons and explanations for different actions. Cleaned stuff off my phone that 4 other cleaner apps could not. Very, very pleased &amp; highly recommend! Installed on all family's devices!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This is the first Colleen Hoover book I've read, but it won't be my last!  So many unexpected twists throughout, I can't wait to read the companion book 'Losing Hope'
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book Keeps you intrigued from beginning to end. Easy read with lots . Of twists and turns that makes you want to keep turning the pages.
B008KE3960|4.0|This is a really fun defense game.  It helps to set up paths for the planes to fly.  I had planes flying in loops just picking off tanks.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|I loved this book so I wanted to give the movie a shot. It was great! Very similar to the book too!
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I kind of have mixed feeling about how much I like this movie but I thought it was pretty decent and better than your average move so I gave it 4 stars but I have a feeling had it not been bruce willis I likely wouldn't have liked it so much.  He fits the role perfectly as mclain
B00076RT24|4.0|Okay, people complain about Jar Jar and how young Ainkin is, but aside from that it is entertaining.  If you like Star Wars, and willing to let a few things go and not be overly critical, it can be entertaining.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|This is the same kind of game you find on facebook.  Fun but helps to have friends who play it.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Another legendary opening scene. I get sick and tired of MI6 beating our CIA/SS in cool things to watch. Where is our 007? Where is our supercool car? Where are our women? Where is our Q? Where is our powerhouse old lady running things? In any case, this is one of the best Bond movies, and I have seen them all more than once.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|I am officially a James Wan fan boy. Saw insidious and was blown away. Thought well maybe a one and done but we'll go ahead and see the conjuring. Wow! The hairs ind the back of my neck were standing, goosebumps were at attention, and I was thinking and talking about the movie, well, I still discuss it with a co-worker. Can't wait to see it at home on blu-ray with my surround sound blarring. Absolutely fantastic and frightening. You will enjoy.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I was impressed with this movie. I had low expectations, but this movie is up higher on the stick than the high school musicals that have been released in recent years. Though in the beginning, the main a Capella group of the movie has some blending issues, I stayed tuned in and was satisfied in the end.<br /><br />The voices are good, the music is good, the story is believable and semi-interesting. If you like musicals in general, this movie will not let you down.<br /><br />An unexpected (on my part, anyway) plus was the humor infused into the plot. The previews make it look a little funny, but it's a bit funnier than that, I think. I was laughing out loud a whole lot more often than I expected.<br /><br />I feel like the preview/trailer here on Amazon represents it pretty well. If after watching it, you think you might enjoy this movie, I'd place money on you being surprised with how much you actually do enjoy it.<br /><br />I highly recommend for fans of modern musicals with a bit of comedy included.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Maxed out on Tom Hanks before the movie was over.<br /><br />The movie jumps around constantly crossing time lines between past and present as different people manifest their Karma through different reincarnations.<br /><br />Somewhat interesting, but not enough to recommend to someone or spend my time considering that there are much better movies out there to watch.
B005MJFA2W|4.0|Haven't finished reading it but so far it's been a great read. Daniel is a great communicator with some very interesting insights.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This series shows just enough science to make it interesting, but not so much that it can confuse you.  It has actually changed my preconcieved ideas of what science nerds are really like, mainly two dimensional people who are socially ackward and who dressed funny. The show did started out protraying them that way, but over the years it has been fun to seen them all grow and mature  into three dimensional people, who are like everyone else, striving to get though life, looking for love and acceptance; except for Sheldon who just dreams of being a robot!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This product does exactly what it says it is supposed to do.  We charge phones, iPads and iPods on it.
B003MAS9S0|1.0|This movie stopped playing at 39 min.....we are going to download again.  What do we do to get a refund? Awesome movie, but not when it cuts off partially in..
B00127RAJY|1.0|Tried to work it in the did player but does not work in Europe. It was not expensive prob not worth my whirl returning .. Should have warning that only works in certain areas
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Two words: F****** Hilarious!! By far one of the most well written, funniest books I have ever read, right up there with Tara Sivec's Seduction and Snacks. (I need to read the 2nd & 3rd)<br /><br />Great characters, great story, great ending and never a dull moment!<br /><br />The story is told from Drew's point of view and he is arrogant, confident, rich, a male w**re, truthful and downright hilarious! You will fall in love with him no doubt about it.<br /><br />Tangled starts with a very sick Drew. He thinks he has the Flu. (1% in I am LMAO)<br /><br />Have you ever noticed some of the worst sicknesses in history have a lyrical sound to them? Words like malaria, diarrhea, cholera. Do you think they do that on purpose? To make it a nice way to say you feel like something that dropped out of your dog's a$$?<br /><br />Then we meet The B**ch, who he refers to throughout the book, as his sister Alexandra, she shows up at his apartment to get him out of his funk and his act together!! You see Drew has fallen in love!<br /><br />\\"It finally happened.\\" \\"What happened?\\" \\"What you've been wishing on me all these years,\\" I whisper. \\"I fell in love.\\"<br /><br />Rewind four months earlier and we are told Drew's story. He is a successful investment banker and on his typical Saturday night out, he encounters a very beautiful woman, Kate Roberts. What he doesn't know is that she knows who he is once he mentions where he works and later Drew has found himself in shock because Kate will be working with him as well.<br /><br />This seems to pose a problem for Drew. You see he doesn't fornicate with ANYONE at the office, therefore making this quite possibly the hardest, but most entertaining for all of us, thing he has had to do. Did I mention that Kate is also engaged to Billy.<br /><br />The two of them start their business relationship together and Drew finds himself wanting to throw all his rules out the window.<br /><br />See me there, at my desk, mumbling like a go**amn schizophrenic off his meds?<br /><br />He is pretty much used to getting what he wants and naturally he wants Kate. Then the unthinkable happens and Drew as well as Kate find themselves competing against each other to have the best presentation and win over a particular client.<br /><br />OMG one of the funniest parts in the book is reading and visualizing the lengths that these two go to for their presentation which is for Drew's father to see and decide on which one is best. They literally act like children, but underneath all their nit picking, finger giving, shin kicking, you can see that chemistry and that attraction they both have for one another.<br /><br />As I check my briefcase to leave for my meeting. I realize this attraction-no, that's not a strong enough word-this need that I have for Kate Brooks isn't just going to go away. I can try and fight it, but I'm only a man, for God's sake. Left unresolved, my desire for her could turn my office, the place I love, into a torture chamber of sexual frustration. I can't let that happen.<br /><br />As these two continue to play cat and mouse we are also entertained with the other characters in the book as well. His friends, his sister, The B**ch, her husband Steven, Billy, Kate's fiance, whom you just know isn't the one for Kate, Delores, the chemist and last but not least 4 year old Mackenzie, Alexandra's daughter! I love that little girl! She had me rolling when this convo happened, Alexandra says<br /><br />It's the estrogen. It gives us ESP. If you had a vagina, you'd know too.\\" Mackenzie raises her hand proudly. \\"I have a bagina.\\"<br /><br />So what happens with Billy, Kate and Drew well go get the book and find out!! I really don't want to give much more away because I want you to read and experience this story for yourself, if you haven't yet.<br /><br />I highly recommend it because it is fantastic. I never laughed so hard and highlighted so much!!! It will be worth every penny you spend trust me!! One last quote which pretty much describes me<br /><br />I don't usually do live plants. My thumb's about as green as Morticia Adams's.te which pretty much describes me<br /><br />I don't usually do live plants. My thumb's about as green as Morticia Adams's.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|The Settlers of Catan was my introduction to Euro-gaming, and particularly German-style board games, some 17 years ago not long after it won the prestigious Spiel Des Jahres (Game of the Year) award from the German Critics' Press.  I originally found the game in a wholesale catalog at my friendly local gaming store, and something about it just jumped off the page and hit me.  I requested a special order for a single copy, and although it was more than I spent on any individual board game up to that point, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />The game's setup necessitates a lot of player interaction.  Sooner or later, you're not going to be able to get the resources you need by rolling dice or making trades at the ports.  That's where your fellow players come in.  To that end, even if when it's not your turn, there are still things you can do in an effort to enhance your own position.  This also calls for situational awareness as the board changes, so there is not a lot of downtime waiting for other players to make decisions.<br /><br />All-in-all, for anyone that likes board games, or would like to try their hand at the kind of board games you can't buy off the shelf at Target or Walmart, I recommend The Settlers of Catan as part of the canon of board games that everyone should be familiar with, if not own.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewistown hip hop in a great direction with musical skill, lyrical talent, and an intelligent examination of culture.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game is great, however, take out all the devil worship imagery. Other than that is was fun and easy.
B004GJYROG|5.0|we had a vcr version at home and the tape got ate by the vcr. the look on my grandsons face when that happened was vert sad,  so I ordered it dvd before we went to the beach and my 7 yr old grandson watched it over and over.

B009POHHRG|5.0|I had read several reviews and thought I would give it a try. Probably one of the best Batman stories ever written.

B003VXMMTK|5.0|She is the silver thread that carries you through the heartbreaking journey through the short years. A story that stays with you long after the credits roll.
1476733953|1.0|This review contains minor spoilers.<br /><br />Generally, I adore books with the premise of post-apocalyptic worlds set in a dystopian landscape. I love the bleakness. I don't know why but the endless possibilities for the characters and storyline makes me excited to begin. And the countless five star reviews had me jumping with anticipation. Sadly, I was let down big time.<br /><br />Somehow, the author has managed to take a great idea of a reasonably large population of people living in underground bunkers after the world becomes uninhabitable, struggling to survive and make it incredibly boring and implausible. We begin with Holston, a grieving widower who basically commits suicide to be with his wife by volunteering for Cleaning, a process which involves people venturing up to ground level to clean camera lenses so the population below can have a nice view. After that, another story begins with new characters, and so on and so forth. I barely made it to one hundred pages, and quite frankly, with the knowledge of another four hundred odd pages to go was not encouraging. There just was not enough power to blow me away from the start and not enough happening to keep me entertained and make me keep reading. I felt no connection to the characters (mainly because they kept dying) and the writing was slow.<br /><br />And 'Wool' is a terrible title.
1891252089|5.0|I am a practicing yoga teacher and this book was perfect for me to find many little extras to incorporate in to my classes. Great illustration/photography.<br />Really happy I bought it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I feel this is the best weather App out there. Very informative &amp; accurate. Appreciate that it is a free App.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I enjoy this game quite a bit. Works nicely on  my note 2.  I found myself always plaything it. I do wish it was Faster to the prizes though
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|best rendition of the series I've ever seen ! the enhanced content really put it over the top, I don't even think it looked so good when it was first aired
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Saw Chris Kyle's wife speak at his funeral, very emotional setting. Just wanted to read more about the man and his journey. RIP Chris Kyle
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This Book is a life changer and opens your eyes to your inner truth. Reading this book has showed me that I am Me for a Reason but I can choose to be the Real Me and not the one I was taught to be.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|I truly enjoyed the original story here. It is refreshing not knowing virtually everything that is going to happen. Tom Cruise puts in a good performance but I do think Morgan Freeman was a little under used..
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|is a free fun app  I love the fact that you  haf to upgrade the car's a .  Motersicl and so the game is a  free download and so the game is a free fun app .
B000VRIQ58|4.0|There is such a heavy and serious sound as though three or four organs were at work here. The songs are catchy with a vocal group right out of the church choir. It works well for your gym workout.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I enjoyed reading this story with Jack Teacher. I was interested after hearing about the film with Cruise. Teacher is a great character, no missing with him. I will read the next in the series.
B00AYB12PC|5.0|I've seen this movie several dozen times but I always love it! Now with my big flat screen and high def I saw more this time than I did ever before. Entertaining movie but not really what I would consider scary
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like the game, people try it you will like it, it's a good game for kids to play. It's fun
B00B9366VO|5.0|If you love ROCK AND ROLL.... you must see this.<br />This was a great place/ piece of L.A. history. I was bummed to hear of it's demise. I am so happy a part of it's soul lives...  In the right hands as well. A very well made documentary,  it could have been 4 hours or more and I would have been happy to see every minute.<br />I would love to see the outtakes that 'hit the floor'...<br />\\"Special Edition\\" ?
140006922X|5.0|This is a great book. Everyone should read it to understand the \\"actual\\" Jesus!<br /><br />The book is scholarly and yet readable by layman.<br /><br />Great work by Reza Aslan.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show!! I hope that it will last for many more years! The actors are wonderful with a great story line!
B0010T0OCY|1.0|I remember how much I loved this film when it first came out. I watched it last weekend and was very disappointed. It's really not good. In fact, it's quite bad. Kiefer Sutherland (whom I adore), was awful. His character was more of a caricature of a mad scientist. Very affected performance. The plot was not amazing as I'd remembered, nor were the effects. Skip it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I loved the idea that a man of science had a touching experience with the \\"creative OM\\".  Having a deep belief of all that Dr. Alexander describes in his journey based  on years of self meditation, and end of life experience with family members,along with my own \\"intuitive\\" sense of life after death.  It's often hard to remember just how encased in God's love we really are with all the outer stimulus of this physical life we are experiencing, and the fear that is thrown at us through media and life in general.<br />I would recommend this book to everyone, especially if you think you are a \\"nonbeliver\\".<br />Thanks Dr. Alexander for knowing you needed to share this journey with the world.<br />Lovleemom
B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|This is an excellent book for any level of previous Lightroom knowledge. There are a couple of other good books on Lightroom 5 but what I think sets this one aside is the format. First, it's very easy to find just what you want. Then, the topic is in a very simple step by step format that gets to the point without a lot of reading. Thus it makes a good reference tool as well as a good learning tool.
B00DDZM0GQ|1.0|Way too fast, even the first level.  Speed is everything, not finesse. Gives me a headache.  Frustrating to play.  Wish there was a speed control, or at least beginner levels.
B00138KBTS|5.0|Like GothCrone, I too, grew up with good music from varied genres. I was 10-or-so years old when CONCERT BY THE SEA came into our home. Having yet to see Mr Garner perform, I could feel his fingers run the keys, understood the drama in his emphasis. Until that album, I considered jazz an outlet for elderly musicians & the insane. He widened my path to all music and concepts. Hear it, truly feel it. It's been 20+yrs [my last turntable blew]since I've heard it, so tonight I am excited again...and as GothCrone, I am in tears.<br />If you have $25+ to spend on CDs today, definitely add this to your AMAZON cart. If your budget's a bit thin right now, I recommend TARGET online @ $1 more, and free shipping to its cardholders.
0060574216|4.0|Read it years ago and enjoyed it, it proved helpful as well. This was a purchase for a gift, but I would not have given it if I didn't think it was a good book.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|The CD is so positive, upbeat, charming and well thought out.  Seeing them live is real treat!  But the CD is also good.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Its one of Supernaturals most riveting seasons. The plot is amazing and left me on the edge of my seat. Streaming from Amazon shows it super clear unlike other sites I've used. Must watch!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Hard to believe slaves were treated this badly by our 1800's ancestors.<br />Loved seeing sadistic, self-absorbed, racist white guys getting offed by an empowered slave!<br />Terrific performances by all the main actors.<br /><br />One issue: initial download from Amazon &#34;hung&#34; at 2h 22 minutes !  Had to call Amazon Video support to report it, have it removed from our queue, re-download, and watch the ending he next morning.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Couldn't have been better. Great start to a new series. characters really make you want to see more so on to the next
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows on TV ever. Really enjoy it. Just don't like the time between seasons. Looking forward to season 5
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|This movie was as poor as the 1980's Dune sci fi flick.  I can't blame Tom Cruise for this, he did his usual journeyman job.  The script and plot were very hard to follow.  I'm a sci fi fan and can follow intricate and layered plots well, but this movie left me scratching my head.  Don't bother.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Who doesn't love this series? It was beautifully wrapped up. It was sent immediately as well. This series is definitely under my favorites and I think it is a great way to talk to kids starting from 5th/6th grade to adults about government and  morality.
B00E7PQVHK|4.0|I like this game so much that I own it on several platforms, so the rating of this review doesn't reflect the game itself which is 5 stars in my book. It has an interesting, longer storyline so you get a lot of play time and most of the battles are random enough for it to be replayable.<br />First issue is that it seems to think that it is compatible with the first generation Kindle but it never gets past the loading screen. It works fine on second generation Kindles.<br />Next issue is that you can only randomly skip cut scenes which are rather long.<br />The last issue is that you can't do a side quest if you save right in front of it. You have to save at least one point away or, even though it still looks like you can click on it nothing happens so you can't complete that side quest. That doesn't affect finishing the game but it does take away some levelling.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was hesitant to start reading this book after Stephanie Meyers said that it was one of her favorites, however with the urging of a friend, I picked it up and finished it within a day. It is a quick read with a deep meaning. Perfect for any kind of reader.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This movie came out after I graduated high school.  Our kids had never heard of it so we rented it for our family night and it has become a new favorite!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am adicted to the series.  Watch videos over and over.  Just love all the characters, but do not understand Mathews dying the way he did.
B009ME47H2|5.0|Its a really awesome app and its really easy. Its comes in handy when ever u need it and seems to work great!!!:-):-) :-)
B00992CF6W|4.0|Overall good game for kids. Would give it 5 stars but updates and mods don't work very well.  There are glitches and screen is shakey.
B000FBJHT4|4.0|Heard this book cited by the Canadian Minister of Defense in testimony concerning the reality of UFO and extra-terrestrials. Was quite blown away by the author's account! It changed my mind and persuaded me that a UFO did indeed crash at Roswell and other life forms were indeed \\"captured\\". This book will especially interest engineers as the story of how all kinds of scientific breakthroughs of the postwar era were reverse engineered from the captured alien aircraft (though the origin of the material  carefully hidden) is fascinating. These advances include lasers, night vision goggles, silicon chips to name a few.
B00003CXBK|3.0|Perhaps my expectations were set a little high by the quote on the box stating &#34;the star wars of animated features&#34;  I think the quote should have read, &#34;the Fern Gully of Japan&#34;!  Gave it three stars because I thought the animation was great but did not think the plot was that good.<br /><br />May just be personal preference but I prefer anime with characters who strive to improve themselves and overcome their individual difficulties through hard work and determination. Rather, it seemed to mostly be about saving the forest.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to teenagers and environmentalists.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so awsome. Super duper fun for all ages so if you like horeses than give this game
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I really like sci-fi and action movies, and this was a really entertaining and fast-moving one.  The whole family (youngest is 16) enjoyed it.
B004UPANAI|5.0|They did a great job with his backstory. I completely understand the other X-Men movies better after watching this one.
B006RXPSLK|2.0|My son watched this.  He loves it and has watched it a few times in the past.  So don't take my rating seriously unless your over 60! :-)
B00E8TVHBA|5.0|This movie is a fun musical to sing and dance with your children. So much fun, I love it. Mother of 3, 6 year old, 4 year old, and 15 months.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|We used this charger during a 10 day road trip recently, we charged an iPhone & an Android phone using it, sometimes simultaneously. It worked very well for us. The car charger I bought before this one was a cheapo that caused serious battery drainage problems. We also own a Anker dual port wall charger that works very well too.
B00821OX98|4.0|Maybe as good as X-files when it arrived on television.  The cast seems good. The storyline keeps it interesting enough.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|This  book was recommended by friends -- The main character is a hoot.  I can hardly wait to read the next book!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love this show!! Full of great characters and plot lines..I like how the show is so complex , and the second season is different than the first season...
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|Absolutely love these games...they keep me thinking  and r challenging at times and sometimes they throw some easy ones at you<br />, I think to throw you off
B006TVQU6C|1.0|It wasn't worth sending back. It is shabby and may be made of recycled beer cans. Doors wouldn't open, I think due to frame misalignment stemming from poor handling at factory; however, 'poor handling' takes on new meaning with this rubbish: I put in the power supply, the case slipped and fell lightly on a corner which crumpled and sent noticeable warps through the side door, rear and bottom. Shabby experiment from Antec.
B00ECU34ZM|1.0|Boring, very slow and no character development. Do not recommend.<br />It is a long uninteresting movie, the previews were probably it's best part.
B00422LESO|2.0|I loved the premise. The idea that there is a &#34;camp&#34; where adults can go and live as a lady or gentleman in Austen's England is lovely and fun. The book, unfortunately, is neither lovely or fun. The LL gets all existential and want's things to be real so she can't just sit back, relax, and have some fun. She is ashamed of her slight obsession with Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy and makes way to much of a big deal about watching P&P over and over again. Everything felt forced, like the author was trying to write a &#34;serious novel&#34; instead of a &#34;romantic comedy romp&#34;. I was very disappointed. I have never, ever, ever, said this before, but I hope the movie is better.
B00B81B0HC|4.0|This is a good deal for the album. I bought the cloud version not a disc. I usually only buy  the downloads when the price is  $5 and under.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is a nice game when there is time to be wasted or even when you should not waste time
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I LOVE THIS SCORE THE MUSIC AND SOUNDS ARE SO CLEAR. I RECEIVED THIS WITH MY DVD. I LISTEN TO IT ALOT.<br />HOPE THAT YOU ENJOY IT AS I DID
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I don't understand what adobe does so I should not comment, but thought it would help watching utube but didn't
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Appreciate the thoughtful mini-games included in Despicable Me: Minion Rush.  Upgrades are available without in-app purchasing, but you can also spend your dough to buy one of the specialized costumes that grant you bonuses.  I love having three objectives to strive for.  I do wish there were more than three locations in which to play, but I understand there have to be limits. But I don't have to like it.  ;)
B00B7Y0206|1.0|my kindle will not play much of any thing on utube any more these app didn't seem to help but could be something else
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is nothing like what I'm Accustomed to reading. So glad I purchased it. Now, on to the next one.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I rarely rate games, but this totally floored me. Let's get the stunning graphics,music and ambient sounds out of the way first. You will love the look and feel of this game. Good thing,too, because it will keep you coming back when you think you're stuck.<br /><br />You can't ask for clues whenever you want them; they appear at almost the exact point when you're ready to give up but refuse to. This frustrated me at first, but it wasn't long before I found myself determined to keep looking and thinking outside the box on my own. And it really felt like a triumph to solve a puzzle before the clues began to appear - or even before receiving the final one.<br /><br />Everything rotates in a 3D space, including inventory items - some of which have to be manipulated before you can use them. Most of the time, you're moving through the environment and moving puzzle elements by swiping, but once in awhile you will be tilting your pad or phone to move something along.<br /><br />I generally play hidden object games with more hints and the ability to skip puzzles (flat-out NO skipping in this game!), so initially I feared this was more of a challenge than I could handle. But this game provides just enough help to move you forward without taking anything from your successes.<br /><br />I have to admit, the exact objective of the story line was never quite clear to me. I think that was deliberate, as it didn't impede my progress or befuddle me along the way,but instead kept me focused on the tasks at hand, one step at a time.<br /><br />I played this on a Kindle Fire HD and found that sometimes the screen was not as responsive as other times, but I suspect that was more a function of the Kindle itself and not so much the engineering of the game. Not sure if I'd want to play it on a smartphone due to the depth of detail and fine adjustments, but hey, I'm 61 years old and my eyes aren't what they used to be!<br /><br />All in all,I can't think of a single reason not to highly recommend this game, or not to keep playing in future &quot;Rooms.&quot;ommend this game, or not to keep playing in future &quot;Rooms.&quot;
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I am half way thru this book and hating every minute of it.  Why am I still reading it?  $$$!  I just wasted more than $10!  Too many characters.  Due to changing them in each chapter,  I can't feel any compassion for any one of them.  Everything seems quite superficial.  Too heavy for light reading and too banal for meaningful reading.  I hope the second half of this book gets better.  As of now I wouldn't download it again even if it was free.
1439170916|5.0|Dr Mukherjee has a wonderful and human way of telling the story of cancer treatment through mankind and the last section focused on the latest advances in the technology of cancer treamtent certainly fascinated me, making me understand some of the basic principles of molecular biology, genetics and its applications in a very approchable manner. It was great to also see the life of the disease in patients, the personality of the doctors and scientist involved in finding a cure and the politics of cancer. I love science and technology with little knowledge of the world of medicine or biology:I continue to be impressed by scientists that make science and technology advance. Such ingenuity, imagination, vision and creativity!
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Love the case, don't have to be afraid to take my phone out to the pool side and miss important calls. Just wish instructions were in the case and not online.
B0000549B0|5.0|Jimmy Stewarts' character makes you feel like you can see the rabbit too! Very well made on really enjoy playing it.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|Excellent. Great character development. I enjoyed the entire movie. Especially enjoyed the explicit violence and comedy against the bad guys. Mindy stole the show and really was a 'Kick-Ass'.
B00992CF6W|5.0|wow great game its the best great grafics.i didn\\"t get it very long ago but i\\"v filled of it up compleatlea
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Absolutely love this game.<br />I have played it over and over again.  And I am learning golf terms like eagle and bogie.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I get stuck playing the game...it is not as frustrating as regular solitaire.<br />But sometimes it is hard to put down.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|One listen and you will feel like you've heard a classic by a quality rock band with their original lead vocalist !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome horse game, love it!  Love that you don't have constant ads as well. I would definitely recommend it for any horse lover.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I liked this game. 3d game, with lovely minions. Nice animations. Enjoyed playing this app.<br />Gameloft rules. Well done guys.!!!!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|It gave me a headache! I can't believe two talented and Academy Award winning stars were involved with this stinker.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I was a little hesitant to pick up this book even though I enjoy all of his other work. It was a big mistake to wait as long as I did, this is a great short novel and the way he writes always keeps me interested until the very end. The description doesn't do this book justice at all.<br /><br />As always the way he develops his characters and tells their stories always leaves me wanting more.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes Brandon Sanderson or Fantasy novels.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I told my friend about DS and she downloaded it on her iPhone! She is about 10 levels behind me and had access to a storage, trading portal &amp; spell shop (just to mention a few). Are these only available thru iPhone? I have a kindle can we make them even?
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This is dark storytelling at its absolute best. Such an incredible series. I am mesmerized by the narrative and deeply happy that you never know who will live or die.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. I play for hours. Love all the different levels and like that if I'm running low on coins I can play slots and build them back up. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I catch myself watching it more and more!  The plot has so many different flashbacks!  I even find myself learning a few about science.
B000S9WLBY|4.0|My father was a Japanese prisoner of war. He wouldn't talk much about the Japanese except how much he hated them. I don't know how accurate a picture this paints of the Japanese soldiers, but it's a lot more sympathetic than the picture I grew up with.
B005PK57NU|5.0|Addicted to series! Thought show was more about  snoottie politics. Love the law firm setting and characters. Plenty of personality. Look forward to season 5
B002ECQQZU|2.0|This movie pales in comparison to the original. It isn't scary, suspenseful or intense. Just a story about some tragic happenings at a lake house.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|A little disappointed, not as much an action thriller as I would have hoped.  Pretty good as a rental, but glad I didn't go to the movies to see it.
B0083Z614S|3.0|Not my favorite by a long shot but better than some other fiction I've recently written. One of those writers than surprises you from time to time!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Durable, multiple faces, alarm setting, brightness setting' accurate time keeping and very user friendly volume has nice range, choice of wash or mnsic to wake up or fall asleep to also you can add your ownmusic.  AWESOME ALARM
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Oh my gosh! This movie constantly had me laughing! i loved it! I loved seeing all the different characters that were created and who played them, Great cast!
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|This app is great and it w pop red Sox are not the only one of my favorite part of a few days ago found this is a great way to get a chance to win the game and girls tv shows that is all
B000P407K4|5.0|It's Kubric... what else needs to be said. Another masterpiece, but this masterpiece is of a farcical nature. Every work of his is different, but brilliant. This movie takes a whimsical look at a dark subject. \\"he will see the big board\\"...
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A compelling story with outstanding actors in the lead - both young and old.  Beautifully told story of love and memory loss,
0071592466|2.0|it wasn't as good or as helpful as i thought! i found other better ways to conquer the toefl !
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|How can you go wrong with this exceptional cast of characters.  What a great story about 4 old friends who end up in the same retirement home.  The story, music and acting are all superb.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I've been rewatching season two, and I know it was panned for being too slow. But I love it for the arguments it makes for each character's different approaches to the apocalypse. I found I really got caught up in the characters again, and in the hard choices each one was having to make. I think it is a real dramatic tour de force.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|Extremely fast shipping. It arrived two days earlier than anticipated.  Thanks so much for making this happen.  I couldn't wait to get this movie for myself as I really enjoyed the original theatrical version.<br /><br />Thanks again,<br /><br />Brian
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I found this game utterly entertaining, however time consuming. It must take a while to get items you buy with real money, because I bought 500 gems the days ago, and I still haven't received anything. :/
B0034G4ORC|1.0|They obviously didn't hire anyone who has actually been in the military to consult on this movie. It must be amateur hour in the producer's office. Wow.
B00136Q6D0|5.0|A required aquisition if u want to track Mile's progression from hard bop towards the ground breaking Bitches Brew recordings. Early jazz -rock fusion.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I purchased this to arrive while I was gone to my daughters to help with her double mastectomy.  My husband has enjoyed it.  I can't wait to see it when I get back home.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|There are several types and difficulties, and a variety of optional helps. The only problems I see are: 1) not every puzzle is solvable (#272 is the first unsolvable one I've come across) and 2) there is no confirm if you accidentally hit &quot;solve&quot;. I've accidentally done that several times and it's incredibly frustrating--particularly if you care about the stats: one accidental misclick and your stats are trashed.
B002LAM7PI|4.0|We watched this as a family. Didn't know how well the kids would like it but they all watched it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I'd so funny and easy cool and other stuff .And I don't know what else to say but I love this game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love all of the books the ending was amazing I will read them again and again and again  Love it
B00061QK02|5.0|I wanted to get the full screen instead of the wide screen, and this did it. I also wanted to get the unrated version. This pretty much covered my criteria for this particular movie. The cheap price was just an added bonus.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|It gives me something to do while I'm trying to fall asleep every night. Lots of fun! I recommend it to everyone.
B0041OJ0Y8|5.0|Love em or hate em. Check their performances on youtube and decide for yourself. Edgy and fun lyrics. I love Yolandi...
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|The movie was a big let down from start to finish.  The plot was not well done, and it did play out well.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|A fun and unique tower defense game.  Some twists on types of towers...and an upgrade system.  Elite levels offered after main campaign.  If you like RD games...this is a must have
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Good action and special effects, with a few new twists, but nothing mind blowing. Morgan Freeman's role is, unfortunately, pretty limited, but if you like post-apocalyptic sci-fi, you'll probably like this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My mother in law died of cancer before I knew my husband. To glimpse a fictional possibility of their thoughts and feelings makes me feel as though I better understand the enormity of their hopeful/hopelessness. Thank you, Mr. Green, for sharing your gifts and talents with us.
B00A9C3RNQ|3.0|This movie has big name stars, but not a big plot. This picture for me dragged from time to time although it has a good story line it was not something I would rush to watch again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is my favorite game. It is so much fun and the whole game is so cute it's a wonderful game :D
B00338QENI|5.0|Interesting and thought provoking-how can this be critical with all the to me on the best sellers list. Great story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I had downloaded this book a while ago and couldn't remember what it was all about.  This was one of the rare times that I just started reading without knowing what type of story it would be (chick lit, non-fiction, drama, mystery).  From the first page it grabbed me and didn't let me go until I finished it within the day.  Make no mistake - it is sad and gripping, and very, very real.  The story is about life and death and all the struggles in between from the perspective of teenagers that are facing death way sooner than they should have to face it.  It was beautifully written, funny (laughed out loud several times), poignant, romantic, truthful and sad all wrapped in one wonderful package.  It is a book that you will remember and will think about for a long time to come.  It is one I will always remember because it grips you and makes you THINK, where so many books do not.  If you want a book that will leave its mark on you, this is one that will beautifully touch you.
B003L77FYS|5.0|How can anyone not like Castle is beyond me. Great story lines and the banter between Castle and Beckett is great. Top that off with a superb supporting cast and you have a great show.
0553386794|5.0|I came to A GAME OF THRONES because I read (and write) historical novels set during the Wars of the Roses, so I wanted to see what this writer of epic fantasy would do to the material. I was pleasantly surprised to find that George R. R. Martin (I'll refer to him as GRRM) didn't slavishly follow the historical events, making this a refreshing read.<br /><br />Yes, I got that the Starks stand in for the Yorks (I guess Cateleyn is based on Lady Cecylee Neville, Duchess of York), and that the Lannisters stand in for the Lancasters. But everything has been mixed up, so that Robert Baratheon, who most resembles King Edward IV, is married to his greatest enemy Marguerite of Anjou (the Lancastrian Queen). Or perhaps Cersei Lannister is based upon his actual wife Elisabeth Woodville? Which makes Jaime Lannister what? Sir Anthony Woodville?<br /><br />Anyway, you get the idea. It's not easy to fit the actual history to this story, which gives GRRM a lot more freedom to develop his characters how he pleases.<br /><br />For a book with the requisite plot twists and turns, it was a pleasant surprise to read such wonderfully poetic prose. Here is an example of what I mean. We are in Catelyn Stark's head as she rides with her son and his army to cross the river at Riverrun:<br /><br />\\"They crossed at evenfall as a horned moon floated upon the river. The double column wound its way though the gate of the eastern twin like a great steel snake, slithering across the courtyard into the keep and over the bridge, to issue forth once more from the second castle on the west bank. Catelyn rode at the head of the serpent, with her son and her uncle...\\"<br /><br />Look at all those strong verbs: \\"crossed,\\" \\"floated,\\" \\"wound,\\" \\"slithering,\\" \\"issue forth,\\" \\"rode.\\" And how poetic the language is, with \\"evenfall\\" and \\"horned moon.\\" It is just enough to give a whiff of the Middle Ages without overdoing it. This long book, which I believe is about 700 pages (my iPad doesn't tell me), kept me royally entertained for a week. If you have a boring plane journey ahead of you and this sort of thing grabs your attention, get it for your iPad. Five stars.ally entertained for a week. If you have a boring plane journey ahead of you and this sort of thing grabs your attention, get it for your iPad. Five stars.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Played first time, not like some blu-ray that seem to be trouble just to get them to play.  This was a great movie one of those that you will watch again afew weeks/months later and still enjoy and possibly see something next time you had missed first or second time around, definately a keeper.  Acting top-notch as expected with actors like TC and MF.  Wasn't sure of the ladies but they did a great job will look for more movies with them in later.  Scenery was earily and stark yet surreal and beautiful perfect background for this story.  Sure one could 'pick at' most movies and I wonder how Tech didn't seem to notice flight 52 coming from 49's pilot/repairman's home as the origin of the journey to space HQ? It was 49 who found the downed spacecraft with survivor, but as 52 he made the journey to Tech HQ.  Hmmm guess I will just have to watch again and check that out. Still for his second only movie Kosinsky is a very talented Director with a great team.  Let's have more like this and not the usual shoot'em up disaster types.
B00514HDNW|2.0|This book is ok....When the main character isn't having perverted thoughts about the vampire zombies. I try to keep reading but that usually puts me off. I am not a total prude and this genre is right up my alley, but the way those parts of the story are written just bothers me. It seems unnecessary to the plot of the book! Maybe I will finish it someday...
1490313370|4.0|When James Altucher described the process of taking a little time each day to put ideas to paper, it was like that fastball thrown right down broadway.  There are times for baseball players (I play in a beer league from time to time) when the baseball looks like a beach ball and you just can't seem to miss.  Oh yeah, big fat fastball right into my wheelhouse.  Where Altucher writes ideas down, I just talk to myself... a lot.<br /><br />So when he added to that some thoughts on self-publishing, he then really had me hooked.  I have always loved writing.  I never really knew what kind of opportunities were now available through Amazon and the Kindle, even though I have ended just about every day for the last couple of years with my Kindle at night reading widely.  So right away I set out to outline ideas I have been talking about with others (and myself some) for a while on a different view of conservative politics.<br /><br />But back to Altucher's book.  I didn't agree with everything he said.  For example, I got a good laugh out of his advice not to have opinions.  Now think about that: if he doesn't have any opinions, then what does he have to write about?  Isn't \\"Choose Yourself\\" an opinion of sorts?  But disagreements aside, I like his call to help others.  He made me laugh at a lot of points -- but he could have done that without the occasional four-letter-word.<br /><br />I also got [[ASIN:B00BQJB5QM Kindle Self Publishing Gold - Unlocking the Secrets of How to Make Money Online with Kindle eBooks (Self Publishing Series)]] by R.L. Adams.  I have just about finished the writing part of my first crack at \\"choosing myself\\" by self publishing my own book.  I'll see if I can edit this review once I have it ready to go.<br /><br />So when that happens, all I have to say is it's all James Altucher's fault!<br /><br />And it just happened.  I just released my first shot at indie publishing: [[ASIN:B00EWGWKX8 Community Conservatives and the Future: The Secret to Winning the Hearts and Minds of the Next Conservative Generation]].  I'm 'choosing myself'.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|If I could give it ten stars I would! Queen is simply the best! Who couldn't love what Freddie and the boys did!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game was the most fun I've had in a long time. It really is a good hidden object game. It's challenging but easy enough to relax with
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|To my eye the picture quality on Netflix is a step up from my Vizio blueray version of Netflix AND I love that it's much easier to choose and then \\"project a movie or show to watch from my tablet, phone, desktop or laptop.\\"<br /><br />NOW if Amazon (instant) Video would support it, that would be great.<br /><br />Right now, I might find a movie to rent on Amazon, but then I actually go and rent it from (shudder) Google Play, simply because Google Movie/Play naturally supports Google Chromecast (duh)... Prices and availability seem to match...<br /><br />If the programing (geek) APIs are truly open, should be a snap... for the wizards at Amazon to do and get some of my business back from Google Play!<br /><br />I got mine with the $24 e-voucher for Netflix - I would have bought on Amazon, but they were out by the time I learned about this super little gadget...
B00DS2GBJG|2.0|You either like James LaBrie or you don't. Or so i thought, i use to like his voice with Dream Theater, but they have made SO many albums and never taken a break so it's just became mundane over the years. And all the side projects he's done, along with the other members I guess I just grew out of. The music is pretty good, nothing really special, a mixture of In Flames, meets Soilworks. Also the screaming growls from the drummer just really don't do it for me. I'm really tired of this genre of clean, growls, clean, growls etc. Metalcore as they call it. It's not that he's over zealous about it, but he does it enough to make it unlikable. And it absolutely does NOT fit with LaBries voice. Which btw has just gotten so repetitive and boring. On some of the songs he sounds good, but when he starts the soft whining, and uses a few new falsetto techniques to make him sound \\"modern\\" it makes me want to pull my hair out. And I'm already bald. The songs just IMO are not as catchy as everyone says, I've been a musician all my life, now (at 38) maybe i'm just more critical, but it just doesn't make the hair on the back of my neck stand up or anything else for that matter. Each song flows into the other and just sounds the same, to my ears. Maybe you're listening with different ears, but I think there are probably others who would agree with me. The last album i really enjoyed was \\"Train Of Thought\\" and his voice really fit a lot better with that style of \\"heavy\\" than with this style. The \\"Swedish\\" sound. Also some of the lyrics are quit bad, although he's never been known for great lyric writing ability. Such as in the song \\"I Got You\\", where he proclaims \\"I don't need some magician with a magic wand\\", ummm no. So while it's hard to say it absolutely sucks, I guess i'm making it easy to say the biggest part of it sucks. I gave it two spins and I just can't delve into it. It doesn't take me anywhere, just seems stagnant. Go ahead and lynch me. If you love and album that you think is great, and people think it's horrid they cuss you out, are rude and put you down for it. The same goes for an album you hate that everyone else loves. So do as you will, I'm sticking to my review as is. Later.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book at the beach. It had well built characters and I enjoyed the relationships created. Everyone should read it.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Thanks for having my. Small town in your system. It's nice to have the weather right where I live, nothirty miles away!  Thank you very much
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|very fun game especially if you like Minions and the old game of Trigger.  its fun to pass the different levels and each run is different.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I'm surprised how well this does the job, considering the price. I've been considering upgrading to a more expensive mic but so far haven't been able to justify it!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Compelling which is what I like in a book. Flynn has outstanding character development--I felt like I knew them. She also makes the story believable.
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Another great book by Michael Connelly. Very gripping plot with plenty of twists. Loved it. This book was very hard to put down.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is an awsome game. It's so much fun. If you save your prizes the  game regenerates more coins and faster. Lots of coins to enjoy the game for alot play time. A great way to spend time when waiting for appointments or have time to spare.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a wonderfully challenging game that is really fun! I am amazed its a free game.  More rooms please!
1451695195|5.0|Alexanders explanation is not cluttered with trying to explain how, he simply tells his story of his experience.  There will be those who disagree but that is their choice.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This adapter works fine.  It works as advertised, delivers enough charge for the ipad and nexus 10 to charge off of in the car.  I do have 2 issues with it, but they are nothing i would consider removing a star for.<br /><br />1 - Labeling - one port is a little more powerful than the other, for the iPad.  The words Apple and Android are printed on it, but the writing is so small you'll never be able to read it when it's docked in your car.  It would be much better if they colored around one slot Green (android) and the other Red (apple) (or even put as big a Red and Green dot as possible beside each).<br /><br />2 - It's tall.  I have a slot in my center console for device charging, and this thing sticks up a long ways.  My previous (ipad only) charge was flush to the console (maybe 3mm above the port) but only had 1 slot.  This is easily over an inch out of the slot.  I'm afraid someone is going to snap it off throwing a purse or putting a drink in the drink holder.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It is a very good book. I can't wait for the next book. It will be interesting to see where Martin goes with the sixth and seventh book.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Puzzzles are arranged well to become more difficult as you progress,  seems well put together for a free app.  Would've appreciated more levels,  I'm very unlikely to check back for an update.

B005LAII08|5.0|My Granddaughter has flaming red hair and all the mannerisms of the heroine so I guess I was immediately drawn to this movie. The only questionable scene was the 2 bears fighting fiercely. My Granddaughter who is 11 years old loved the film and watched it several times. The whole family enjoyed the film and we chose it one of our favorites. The 3D effects were great also.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|My Kids love this movie!  No foul language, lots of age appropriate exciement. There is some mild violence as these are action roles.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Helps me relax to release my migraine headaches. Doesn't always work but anything that works here and there for them is priceless.
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|Which his surprising, considering it works on the 2012 model. Needs to be fixed asap! This game looks like a blast!
B0000CABBW|5.0|I loved the story. It is a simple produced movie but the story is really touchy. Leaders are born to lead, no matter who believes in them or not.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Well written and concise - the pain of loss and the price of American freedom.  I felt it, a required read.

0446580848|4.0|Overall, I think The Lion and The Lion's Game were more 'edge of your seat'<br />reading, but, DeMille has a character in Corey that can sell any book.

The characters stay with you long after the story has been finished. I look forward to reading it again. After finishing this book it made me reconsider the whole aspect of time and how I chose to spend it, or waste it.

B003QSOE0U|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever seen in my life based on actual historical events! It is also more leaned on the romance side, but there is history in there too! I have watched this movie 6 times and I never get tired watching it! I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I do!
1936608898|5.0|Awesome book.  The authors don't judge or criticize or have expectations.  They just present information in accordance with helping you make a more informed decision about how food could be affecting our life in more ways than we might have originally thought.  But best of all, I couldn't live without the recipe section at the end of the book!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I would watch it again.  I am not a big Tom Cruise fan, but he did a good job in this film
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This turned out to be a gift for my son which he really liked.  Turned out he was able to make prints of an old friend of his as well as slides for me that I hadn't seen in years.  He said it was easy to use too.  Good purchase.

0231161166|5.0|As a high school biology teacher, this is the book I've been looking to help me update my knowledge of genetics to really understand what I'm either hearing or reading in the media.  Cary does her best to explain complex ideas and principles for people with some science background without being too technical.  Even when she does get too technical, I was able to skip over the technical terminology and still understand the concept.
B0002DB52M|4.0|If you can push yourself to get past the first ten minutes of the movie, where you are wondering why the setting is the way it is, you will be surprised at how good this movie actually is. The story line is intense. This movie is not for children.
B0052REUW0|5.0|This well researched and presented study shows the decline of violence world wide since 1400 and acceleration since WWII.  The author examines theories about why this has happened and comes to some remarkable conclusions.  All fans of the enlightenment will be pleased.  For that matter everyone who wants to live in peace and hopes future generations will live in peace will be pleased.
0307913090|5.0|Can't go wrong with this book in any form. Got this for my hubby -- not a big reader but loves audiobooks. Can't wait til he finishes so we can discuss.
B00656C6KK|4.0|It was of an older time that I found very pleasant. It made for good listening to bring back memories of days gone by..
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|please give us the real game on kindle!!!:( love it on my iphone. but would he so much better using bigger kindle screen. such a good game. I cant believe its not available!
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I enjoyed seeing what had happened in Cranford since the original DVD. Miss Mattie again came across as a caring person with a great dal of strength. The other ladies in the village still entertained. With a cast headed by Dame Judy Dench, how can you lose?  I will watch these DVDs again & again & I know I will enjoy them.
0743277457|4.0|Author is quite accomplished in chess and martial arts.  His point is that he really is interested in LEARNING, not any particular subject.  I'm not sure that is so.  Fascinating personal history. Might leave you with new thought and perspective on yourself.  Worth the price, used.
B00AHHODH2|5.0|I got this to be some some \\"summer reading\\", however I was extremely surprised and delighted with all the twists and turns. And what a great ending! I never saw that one coming!!

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and laughed as hard as our three and five year old kids. Really enjoyable movie for all.  Hope the sequel holds up
B00454U1NS|5.0|not a great fan of Pink, but even a couple of these tracks appeal to my 50-year old brain! in fact, we bought a second copy so we don]'t have to fight with the daughter!~
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|If I could give this app half a star I would,it is a total rip off.for one thing it glitches and has horrible graphics plus it is SO easy. I'm just trying to help u save money.
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|Who doesn't love Finding Nemo?  Seriously!!  Fabulous movie for all ages.  My daughter and I showed it to my 18 month old granddaughter.  She loves it!!  Makes you smile all the way through.  So happy to have it in my dvd collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is fun for adults and children. It is a good exercise for watching and anticipating your next move!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this addition of Game of  Thrones. The author introduced new characters and a great deal more intrigue. He also continued to build on those characters that we know and love. In my opinion, the most memorable scene was when the black Dragon appeared in the fighting pits. This was an overall great read. I hope all of you enjoy reading it as much as I did. FANTASTIC!!!!!!
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Beautifully written and easier to follow than some other classics. A sad and beautiful love story. I can see why it is a classic.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|My 9-year old loves this movie and as parents its engaging enough for us to be entertained and not bored as well.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Second time around and it is still a masterful intrigue. Deeply enjoyed it both times. Baldacci is a very well rounded master of mystery and intrigue, can't find a weak spot in his yarn.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great action with not only the adult actors, but the children that have been cast in the show are wonderful.  Very suspenseful and the plot seems to include the whole planet.  If you like action and believable actors then this is the show for you.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Incredibly useful app. and unbelievably free. Like it so much I am considering buying add free version. Unlike one or two other reviewers, I have had no problems with power drains and incompatibility.Even sends you an alert to remind you to charge it when power is running low.<br />Love it.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I read the book in two sittings. It was an easy read. I was reassured by what I read and it fit in with what friends who also experienced NDEs had remembered. A thorough Appendix gave many other sources to investigate if you were so inclined. I would have liked more about the experience itself. It felt incomplete.
B002W5UVSM|5.0|This book was delightful from beginning to end.  Makes one think of the work that could have been, had the author's life not ended.  The quirky characters are brought to life in this beautifully written book.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This is what was advertised, an excellent new,  good copy of an old Start Trek movie for my collection. Fast shipping was good. Thanks.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|This movie was recommended by a friend as being very funny.  I found it boring and didn't even finish watching it.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Well I tried it and I had fun but, when you get to the last level of world 1, then I got killed by a knight.plz fix
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Discovered them through their song at the end of the recent Wuthering Heights movie. For me, it's like The Indigo Girls meet Neil Young meets Sleeping at Last. Love, love, love it. I can't listen to anything else right now.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Love this game. Just wish there was an option to pay once for the game and then be able to play as long as I want w/o having to choose to pay or wait. I'd pay $10 for a game like that!!  (And give it five stars!)
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Discovered them through their song at the end of the recent Wuthering Heights movie. For me, it's like The Indigo Girls meet Neil Young meets Sleeping at Last. Love, love, love it. I can't listen to anything else right now.
B00422LESO|3.0|The story was a little predictable.  It was a cute but predictable read.  It would make a good story for a preteen.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Enjoyed Gresham after a too long layoff from his books, this was off from his lawyer as main character is young legal genius. Really enjoyed refreshing story, mad me buy and presently reading Litigators.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Always enjoyed doing the puzzles just hated having to clean them up.  Now can still enjoy doing them and don't mind having to clean them up.  It's a fast and efficient way to do tons of puzzles.  The only thing I would change is when done doing the puzzles being able to save them to your amazon kindle hd or whatever device you play it on.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book is very well written, but the idea of kids killing each other leaves me very distressed.  Could something like this ever happen
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|A very good gaming mouse. The adjustable weight and DPI allow for a perfect fit with enough fiddling. The gaming buttons are well done and accessible. The software companion is easy to find as they provide a URL to get it, and it furthers the customization.
B005GQ5IA0|4.0|I'm glad that I read this after watching the film. It's far better, and the character is interesting. When Robert Neville isn't drinking whiskey, he's working studying science and killing vampires. Nice turnaround at the end.
B00000K2W1|5.0|Nice selection of Janis' hit songs. Brings back a lot of memories! I put the download on my computer and keep the CD in the car.
044024367X|5.0|This was my first Reacher book. I was hooked up by the story. Reacher seemed real, and the towns of Hope and Despair also. The two combined plots generated enough suspense. I will move on to other Reacher books now.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Love the history. Well written and insightful....Thirteen more words are required. I am out of words to add. Read the book!
B002T921DE|3.0|The songs brought back a lot of memories but unfortunately there's something off with the sound. Def not blu-ray quality! Bummer

B004KPX4W2|5.0|I Enjoyed the action and the humor was good also. Enjoyed seeing some of the old timers back in action.
B008Y212PI|4.0|fun to play. addicting. a nice part of the gabby soft game listing. please create lots more. revealing the picture as you go would be nice too.
B005K17RU0|1.0|before update it was great. now it takes forever to refresh and constantly freezes/ crashes. what a shame.<br />seems to be a common experience. unless this gets fixed I will have to use a different weather app as my go to information source.
B00AW57L96|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this.  It was written well and it made me want to read each night.  I would recommend this book.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Love the story, costumes, music and scenery. Just awesome. Jonathan portrays Henry how I think the king would really have been. A great series. Need more like it.
0553801473|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the dragon world.  The book was very inciting and left you wondering what next. Very good book.
B000SG6IEI|3.0|I was was familiar with Kidnapped, Treasure Island and of course The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde however I was not aware the latter was only a short novella.  By reading this book I was introduced to a RLS I did not know existed. He was a writer of many short stories included herein, all of a romantic nature, very similar in style to Edgar Alan Poe though not as macabre was Poe, who interestingly enough was born after RLS. Reading this book gave me the idea that perhaps Poe was influenced to some degree be the writings of RLS. I enjoyed this book of short stories and was left wanting more.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I loved the movie's style and humor. It takes a bit of a non-standard approach to the zombie disease, but handles it well.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Awesome film; one of the greatest.  My dad (a local firefighter) is the dude that sprays naked Tim Robbins when he enters the prison.  I'm practically hollywood royalty.

1936608898|5.0|This is easy to understand - they tell you why in &#34;layman's&#34; terms.  I plan to start Sept. 1.  I am already wheat/grain free.  This will give me an eating plan.  Well worth the read!

B004SVM7BW|5.0|There are several softs in my pc and tables could open pdf files, repligo is the one that light and powerful.
B00821OX98|1.0|I would say the acting is abysmal but the show is so poorly written that they never really had a chance
B00992CF6W|5.0|i love minecraft. so this app is amazing. the only &quot;flaw&quot; is that i can't use the crafting table. maybe i'm just stupid and i'm not clicking it right. but it doesn't seem to work.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game s total worth the cost it s also a hard game witch ail test your reflects so this game is worthit and you shoulf get this I played it for 4 days in a tow because ofhow fun it is

B005Q1W10A|5.0|We purchased Downton Abbey as a last resort..  All of our friends were watching and so in love with Downton. After watching season 1 we were hooked!  We couldn't Wait to buy seasons 2&3 and have watched the entire series twice!
B00B3N4CWK|5.0|An excellent adaptation of the novel. Characters are fully drawn and real. A bitter-sweet love story, like so many of Irving's novels.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. It's straight forward, well-made, and truly from the heart. If you're a music lover of any breed you'll appreciate it.<br /><br />It's about a legendary studio that made a jillion hit records, but more importantly it's about MUSIC itself. It offers great explanations for why today's music sucks, and why it seemed so much better \\"back in the day\\". It should be required viewing for ALL young musicians (as well as old cranky ones). Great documentary! You go Dave Grohl!
B0095P31L6|1.0|I watched part of it, skipped through some of it and finally turned it off.  I can't believe even kids would like it.  It was awful.  total waste of time and money.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Great for my phone and tablet. Keeps charge well. Small weight allows you to put in your bag and forget about it.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Only the Warchowskis could have approached such a monumental and transcendent book and made a masterpiece from a masterpiece! Although the film begins with a fractured and diffuse series of flashbacks and flash forwards, it is fascinating from the start. For the first hour, I was thinking, \\"This movie is totally whack!\\". Still, I could not look away. Each scene is enrapturing, disturbing, beautiful, emotional or all things at once.  By mid-film I could see the seemingly disparate elements of the story lines from each characters' lifetimes begin to merge into a story of good and evil, rupture and revolution, greed and kindness and above all, love.<br />The cast is as expansive and impeccable as is the film itself...and oh, the music, the cinematography, the make-up, the special effects! Oscar worthy performances abound. Of particular note are Tom Hanks, Susan Sarandon, Hugh Grant, Jim Broadbent, Bae Doona and Hugo Weaving. Written, directed and produced by Lana and Andy Warchowski and adapted from the novel by David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas tops my A-list for the year! Anyone who loved the Matrix the first time they saw it, is in for a delightful surprise.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|works great with linux on a raspberry pi (as long as you have a good power source). gpsd gets accurate coords fast even indoors testing
1781162646|5.0|What can I say. He is a master story teller! A great yarn about a who done it like the old John D McDonald stories, but with SK's unique style of writing .Please keep em coming Steve!
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I really do use this all the time. I can be in a store and hear a song that I like. You hit the button and boom you know the name of the song.  You can also save the song to download later.  No more guessing and trying to figure out who it is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its awesome! whenever I play I cant wait till I get enough boards to just do whatever! for FREE to! I recommend it for such a low price (no price I mean) and for good quality!!!

B000JMKQX0|5.0|This interesting novel is based on research of human cultures and human traits. It is an important 'must read' for any family, or prepper, who will want to survive the next Zombie Apocalypse.
B00A285OOW|2.0|I am a huge fan of Philippa Gregory's Cousins' War series. The White Queen and The Lady of the Rivers are by far the standouts but sadly, The White Princess, not so much. In addition to the flagrant liberties taken (Henry VII a rapist? Please...) the book is just very repetitive and much tho I am sorry to say it, really boring. (Spoiler alert) Once Elizabeth Woodville's character dies, the rest of the book just drags on and on and by the end I no longer cared what happened to anyone. I would much prefer the elements of magic and destiny that colored the previous books. And am I the only one who wants to know what happened to the gold charm bracelet?!?!
B009POHHPS|5.0|I've never been a huge flash fan.I'd always corralled him with Aquaman. This alternate reality changed all that. John's story is so brilliant, kuberts art so beautiful, the many Easter eggs to the DC universe so wonderful... well I'm saying nothing about the story other than...READ IT
B004EAQNO4|1.0|this is a very very bad movie very stupid too don't rent or buy don't waste your money ok lol
0385486804|5.0|I ordered this book for summer reading and I have to say that it was a very interestingbook and one of the very few that has taught me some part of society that I have always had known but never actually pay attention to it.I learn to appreciate the way I live but also make the best of it. Read very carefully the chapter where the narrator shares one of his personal expiriences when he escalated the mountain. You will love how McCandless made his journey through canyons, desserts, gulfs, and eventually to Alaska.<br />The shipment was the disappointing part XD It took like maybe less than 2 weeks to get it. But it might have just been thedistance what made it take long. I am very pleased with the service of this seller. If you're thinking of buying this book, then you should stop reading my review and go buy it!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I only got this game a couple days ago, and I'm already almost through the first set of puzzles! Super addicting and lots of fun.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|What a wonderful story with many complex characters that is entertaining and not so predictable!  Anxiously looking forward to the next season!!!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I've tried products from Fitbit, Jawbone, and now I spent the past couple days with another step counter in my pocket:The Pulse pairs via Bluetooth; it works with the iPhone 3GS and newer, along with Android 2.3.3 and higher. It charges via Micro-USB, though the exceedingly tiny charging cable the Pulse ships with strikes me as kind of nutty. Fully charged, the Pulse should offer two weeks of battery life.<br />The Withings Pulse packs a lot into such a small body. It's so easy to use, has a great battery life and has the unique features that make it the best fitness tracking device to buy right now.<br />The decision also comes down to whether you prefer to a wristband device or one that clamps onto the waistband of your jeans. The problem I found is that when you change those jeans, it's easy to leave the Pulse behind
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Was exceptional and User friendly app.  Did an upgrade! Now it is impossible to use. frustrating at best!  all information there however need degree in meteorology to find anything. Even FREE not worth your time.  Had an excellent app dont know why they had to fix something that wasn't broken
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Not too bad for a young adult novel. Reminds me of Buffy meets Lost Girl.  I recommend it for those into the supernatural.
B004WDRT1Y|4.0|I bought this because it had a cloud option; it isn't easy like sony movies, and i still haven't set it up yet.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game, will take a long time to complete as you use.health each time u do a puzzle but puzzles aren't too hard
B004EAQNO4|4.0|If you are looking for a good movie with an interesting plot and turns and twists- then this is the one for you. Good luck guessing....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome because it's fun being chased by a policeman -  not that I k ow how that feels!!  It reminds me of temple run, which I really like but I like this better!!
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This show is full of excitement and pure action. I love it!! Cant wait for season four. This show is epic!!
B006QKJQM6|5.0|If you liked Kung Fu Panda then you'll love this one. Same panda with pure optimism, love, and Kung Fu Joy!
140006922X|3.0|Considering all the hoopla surrounding this book - I can only say I am very disappointed.<br /><br />to not even consider the writings (gospels) of the Gnostic, Mary Magdelan, the Dead Sea scrolls, is in my mind, irresponsible of the author.<br /><br />The author jumps around such that a times \\"it\\" makes no sense (i.e.: to speak of Jesus' possible birthplace to writings a century past his death.<br /><br />Te life and times of Jesus. Only somewhat.<br /><br />The notes, although worthwhile, should have been incorporated within the main text. Obviously the author wants his point of view read and believed but the choice in his presentation leaves to be desired.<br /><br />Repetition key to this author's writing ability. That and speculation.<br /><br />The author's words lean toward the justification of violence and terrorism - all in the name of God. tiems haven't changed. Non-acceptance of differences.<br /><br />\\"The idea that Jesus's audience would have needed constant reminding that he was \\"just a man\\" is simply nonsensical.\\" (page138) Nonsensical to the author maybe, but to he people jesus was relating to, saw a man with superhuman powers.<br /><br />the author refers to Jesus as the failed messiah. A Zealot. MLK was also a zealot, Steve Jobs, too. Walt Disney was a zealot. Enterprising.<br /><br />This book reads like a long letter home. The author's justification for believing the fairy tale. Religion is strictly a business and easy to interpret that in this book by stating over and over how many years past the death of Jesus the gospels were written.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|They need not to relay on the gem so much and make coins easier to receive. Other than that it's a great game and extremely realistic. If you fix that problem it will get all 5 stars. :)
B0091REZMW|3.0|I find that the game is fun but it seems to take awhile to move through the levels.  This may be because I do not w as want to spend money just to move faster through the game.
B00CL8DKE2|5.0|Every Pet Shop Boys album is great. Highly recommend this to any fan and also to anyone that likes dance music.
B0063M22QO|1.0|Email saying I had $5.00 in Amazon coins to use to purchase an app for my Kindle.  Chose a .99 game and was charged for it - I would appreciate it if Amazon would be honest!
B005O7PXNS|5.0|Yes, it's formula, and yes, there're almost identical actions and dialogue bits by the four main characters in the precinct scenes.  But Castle is a winner as a surprisingly dark TV crime drama.  The story arc across seasons for all characters, not just Castle and Beckett, is worthwhile.  And the gender role switch between the two main characters is especially nice--Castle cooks, loves his home space, cares for his family, and weeps.  Beckett is a workaholic, shows emotion only reluctantly, is good with a gun, is the youngest to make detective in NY, and isn't good at relationships.  Can't wait for the next season.
B00AFEX83C|5.0|My grandson loves the characters in Monsters, Inc. and requests this movie often. He has Monsters, Inc pajamas and loves anything that is Monsters, Inc. related.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Good story of self destruction and redemption. Her self destruction was extremely frustrating, to the reader, but especially to her. You just had to keep believing and it was worth it.
1934030554|5.0|This is the bible for training with a power meter. It is fairly technical so if you just want some workouts skip to the appendix which has lots. If you want to understand the nuances and science of training read it cover to cover.
B0038P59A0|4.0|Liked the movie. The special affects were good. Loved Robert Downey's comedic responses to the plot. Would recommend this movie to others
B00BZW5W3W|4.0|I enjoy almost every album Maysa puts out and this one is no exception. Blue Velvet Soul is another hit and adds to the growing list of great music produced by Maysa.
B001JNNDDI|5.0|Oh my god, I can't begin to explain how much I love this movie. It's so genuinely funny and has such a great, original story. Each character is so unique and funny in their own hilarious way. There's also a message to it, which  adds to how amazing this movie is. I remember seeing this movie when it was first released and years later it still hasn't gotten old and it never will. Little Miss Sunshine is a classic comedy that has a warm touch to it and I can guarantee you'll fall in love this movie as much as I did. It's a must buy, especially for such a cheap price and all the special features that are included.
B007BDK3SS|5.0|this is one of the best games to play on the kindle fire u would ever play get this game
B009NFHF0Q|1.0|Less than 1 star if possible.  Interesting beginning then just got too strange.  Unless you are a fantasy fan it was truly odd.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game that is not too hard and not too easy.  Can't wait for some more escapes. to come out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game when my little cousin made me play another horse game I thought it would be just like the rest but this app is my favorite.I totaly LOVE this app and I wich you could rate higher than five stars!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I started playing the original bejeweled game on my palm pilot years ago. This one is similar, but very updated.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|What I loved was setting. Loved the home and outdoors.<br />Loved the characters who both had their own unique stories.<br />I liked how Zac handled the sheriff.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|s  This book drug me in from the beginning.  Soooooo hard to put down.  First time Dan Brown reader, but will follow him from here on!I
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its not just one game its a lot on one app you should totally get this app
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game takes UNO as we all know it to a different level! Such amazing fun and love being able to interact with friends! My only complaint, is the constant &#34;timing-out&#34; it experiences, causing me to forfeit my turn due to it freezing.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|This book is not as well written as the first book in the trilogy.  I personally felt that the author seemed to rush thru the prose to cover as much as he could with as few words as possible.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Our kids (7, 4, and 2) absolutely love this game! We have downloaded it onto our Kindle Fire HD. It's lots of entertainment, and easy for them to navigate. My 4 year old son, who is autistic, especially loves Despicable Me. So for him, it's a source of calming. :)
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|I've had this a few days and I'm already hooked!  It took a few minutes to figure out the distance needed from the subject to get it into focus.  I'm using this on my NEX 6 with the 55-210 lens.  I've only had my camera a few months and am in no way a professional, but the results I've seen from this macro have impressed me.  Also, this does not require an additional connector to attach it to the 49mm lens opening.  It comes with the quick connector that you pinch and insert into the end of your lens and it snaps into place.
B008M87GJK|4.0|It's enlightening to get a different perspective on world news. The articles are to the point and easy to read.
B00192M3KI|5.0|I don't have anything fancy or thought provoking to say but I really love this album and I hope pendulum continue to pour their heart into their music.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It's quick and easy to setup and I can't wait for developers to put this great product to use. For the price, can't be beat!
B0040I09RM|5.0|This series is captivating. Even better than Breaking Bad. I highly recommend it. Each season gets better, which is hard to believe.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book from beginning to the end...I have bought this book for others who feel the same way..Amazing...Bravo! Can't wait to read more books by this author
B00181JGI2|5.0|Great performances and so funny. A classic, totally holds up over time, and can be viewed frequently or once every 10 years. But do see it again if you viewed it back in the day....
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|I was more than blown away with this documentary! In true Dave Grohl fashion, it's ALL about the music! I was completely enthrall end from the moment this movie began. To see all of the amazing records that were created in this studio that was never designed to be what it became.....a major piece of music history!<br /><br />I've turned people on to this movie that are not even musicians because of the amazing story it tells. Dave does a great job of bringing everything full circle and keeping the focus on the Neve board and the art behind it.
B000001F7R|5.0|I saw this concert tour in 1980 or '81. They opened for Ozzy with Randy Rhodes. Was a night I'll never forget. We'd never heard of Def Leppard. They were 17-19 year olds, same as me. Rocked us good.
B001NEK2GE|2.0|This was a decent gamepad when it launched 5 years ago, and it's still a decent gamepad, but it really needs an update.<br /><br />The biggest issue for me is the keys they use, they require a ridiculous amount of keytravel, they're mushy keys, and very slow to respond.<br /><br />I wish they updated this device, it's great for what it is, but right now the Razer Orbweaver is miles ahead, their keys are a joy to use, the G13 keys are terrible compared.<br /><br />The logitech software is great, they made great improvements there. But the hardware just isn't competitive anymore.
B00701L5XS|3.0|This app is ok but it needs more knots. And it also does not show what the knots are supposed to look like when it is finished.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|The Good  Wife aws you in like it's real life, brings out emotions, while captivating the audience.  There  is a stark truthfulness and intimacy about the show and the way the characters  portray themselves to you.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This app is helpful to learn about ww2 guns and its fun to use its addicting but very fun I recommend buying full version
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I really liked this book until the ending. The ending was certainly a let down. I feel that the ending could have been spiced up with a more creative ending. This book was ruined for me when I found out the romance between the two main characters is like star wars. This book really had potential and I think the author definitely could of stepped up the action a notch.  I'm hoping the movie will be a lot more dramatic and a better ending than the book.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book has so much detail in it!!! Also this book keeps you at the edge of your seat!!!! This book was so amazing
B005BGBPBG|5.0|This movie is great movie about a romance that should have been. Totally how real-life situations occur. Love this movie. I watch it over and over.
B00499NHLC|5.0|The quality of this work is amazing. I don't have enough great things to say about this show. The bomb!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|When I downloaded SurvivalCraft Demo. You only get 15 minutes to play. When That time was up O had a Idea Uninstall it the Install it again!
B0052UYJDC|4.0|I think I should have read this book before I read Jay's other minimalist book, because it seemed to overlap a bit, where 'the joy of less' was a more detailed instruction. However, I just love reading about minimalism and decluttering, can't get enough of it.
B002ZG99N6|4.0|Good movie. Romance and adventure. Good combo. Ben Affleck played his part really good. I don't like reviewing movies and hate I have to use so many words!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great collection of all of the Alien movies.  Really cool extras and other features that make this Anthology a great addition to any movie collection.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I choose this rating because it was okay but should have had more. I would recommend this book to my sister in college.  I think they should put names in there.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Great collection on bluray for any fan of these movies.  Cool extras as well to go along with each film.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is fun an addictive,  an even better when they added. the ice age stage it is a great game two play all the time
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|Paul Tough's book, &#34;How Children Succeed&#34; reads like a series of long-form magazine articles -- he's a magazine journalist -- clustered around a set of character virtues identified in the opening chapter. These qualities include &#34;persistence, self-control, curiosity, conscientious, grit, and self-confidence.&#34; Tough's thesis -- buttressed by a significant amount of citation from recent research -- is that our culture's excessive and, at times, almost exclusive focus on cognitive skills belies more salient factors for success: developing secure attachments as children in the critical 0-3 years and the development of these strengths.<br /><br />Tough spends a good deal of time with various education reformers, people on the front lines in dealing with distressed populations -- the ACE score is an interesting factoid -- and even a chess teacher. While I found his arguments convincing, I was left feeling there were at least one or two chapters missing which could have been focused on child development experts, psychologists and others who might be able to articulate better how these strengths are and can be developed in children from any socio-economic background. Perhaps that in itself is a different book -- Martin Seligman's &#34;Learned Optimism&#34; is one suggestion by Tough -- but it might have provided another perspective and also more constructive ideas for parents seeking guidance. Overall, an interesting and thought-provoking read.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|It's just amazing, it's more than I was expecting for. i really like it, I am very greatful with you.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|It's hard to summarize what makes this book so important. Dune is a vision of a future so far removed from our present that it's hard at times to understand the culture, a culture that has stagnated for almost 10,000 years and is about to be kicked in the pants! It's also a boy-becomes-hero story, but with dark undertones that play out more fully in the sequels.<br /><br />This is not a book about the usual sciences -- physics, chemistry, biology. This is a book about other sciences: politics, sociology, psychology. Ultimately, it's a book about people in all their complexities, and what happens when one young person with unwanted, extraordinary abilities gets backed into a corner.<br /><br />Finally, this book, and the whole original series by Frank Herbert, is about the Law of Unintended Consequences, and how they play out even upon a galactic stage.
B007XIC1GI|1.0|I have never read such a sad and horrifying book. I thought there might be a light at the end of a dark tunnel but there wasn't.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Once you understand the clues and what you need to do in the beginning of the game it's easy to progress from floor to floor.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|You will truly enjoy understanding the history of the Wicked Witch in this beautiful & magical portrayal of the battle between good and evil. An enjoyable view for girls of all ages.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|This woman is so talented and I've loved hearing her sing ever since she first appeard on the British version of the talent show.
B00BFV1JVM|5.0|Although I had seen the movie and I knew the story line, I found the book kept me completely focused and couldn't put it down.
B005K8QIS0|3.0|I am uncertain as to why this is rated as highly as it is, unless those that gave it five stars have not read Kate Atkinson's books, the source material.  Having recently discovered this author, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Jackson Brodie book, \\"Case Histories\\", and am about 2/3 through the second, \\"One Good Turn\\".<br /><br />This had such great reviews, I almost bought it sight unseen, but was glad to have been able to borrow it from the local library for free.  What a good decision!  As the stories are so well written (four basic lines that are artfully interwoven), I was skeptical about it taking 6 hours to tell, but gave it a try.  First, there are six episodes, an hour +/- each.  The first episode had covered so much of the book, I wondered how it was going to take another five hours to finish.  It didn't.  The second episode was the completion of the first book, and the synopsis for Episode 3 revealed it was the beginning of the second book.  I turned it off and returned the DVD well before the due date.  I did not want to ruin a good book with the \\"Cliff Notes\\" show.<br /><br />What a disappointment.  While all the major characters were in there, and all the story lines were touched upon, this two hour condensation of such a well crafted book was a shame.  I am 'old school' here, if a movie is based on a book, I will always read the book(s) first.  If the author is talented enough to create characters that I can get my head around, and envision, I don't want/need the distraction of the filmakers telling me what they should look or sound like for me.<br /><br />No slur on Jason Isaacs, he is great in everything he does (alas, \\"Awake\\" lasted only one season), and he could have easily carried the role had it been written more closely to the book. I had not envisioned him as Jackson Brodie as I read, but casting him was acceptable--it wasn't as if he was so different than the JB of the page. Having read it first, I honestly cannot say whether folks would be able to follow the storylines, but I found myself mentally filling in a lot of gaps--I knew what was meant because I knew the whole back story.<br /><br />One other comment on read vs. watch.  Atkinson is funny.  You have to pay attention as you  read, and have a passing knowledge of pop culture both of today and JB's youth, but there are times when I will laugh out loud as I read--and it takes a lot to make me do that!  I had no such moments as I watched the DVD.<br /><br />So, if you are interested in this story because of the reviews, do yourself a HUGE favor--read the books first!
B00CO52NLI|5.0|It's fun to play when u are bored or don't want to read. If u love animals then u picked the right game
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great read. The whole book series is the best thing I read since the beautiful creatures series. Can't wait til the movie comes out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok so I played this when I had time in school and its epic I played it non stop. Love it.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|What's really amazing about this movie are some of the stunts Tom Cruise performs-jumping off of 5 story building, climbing the tallest building in the world in Dubai at 100 stories and above. One cannot help to feel a rush of adrenaline just viewing it!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This book is magic - read it and see. You will not be disappointed. I am still thinking about the ending and plan to read the whole book again after it resonates for awhile.
B00A81MV3U|3.0|Not too impressed.  Guess I would agree that it is OK, but not as good as the reviews I have read.
B004AUHWLQ|4.0|Cute movie. A period piece, for sure. Wonderful acting and actors, but movie is a wee bit long. Worth a watch.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Captivating. If you like Gore or violence. This is the book for you. It has a high action content and is very well written
B00138J7ZC|4.0|Became familiar with Devil's Waiting from watching Hell on Wheels.  Very satisfied with most of the album and listen to it a lot.
B006671NPM|5.0|This DVD is an awesome experience as are all the Harry Potter movies  -  second only to reading the books.  I ordered both Part One and Part Two last Christmas and received two copies of Part One.  But you got it right this time, and I am enjoying it immensely.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Amazing to hear someone's first hand experience as they go through such an amazing process.  So much to learn from through her story,  Trying to understand the process she went through and accepting the opportunities we all have to experience life.  A book to read a second or third time.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I wanted this app for a long time but when I downloaded it my Lookout anti virus program immediately said it was malicious so deleted it completely from my KINDLE.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Paul's taste in music is quality and so are his duets.  I really enjoy sharing this with friends as well
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product does what Google said it would do and does it extremely well.  When they announced it I jumped and bought one right away.  It doesn't do a very good job of mirroring my PC screen, so things like Hulu don't work very well.  But for Netflix and Youtube it is awesome.  Well worth the $35 spent.
1250010403|5.0|ENJOYED THE BOOK AS WITH ALL HIS OTHERS AND LOOK FORWARD TO READING THE OTHERS IN SERIES WHEN AVAILABLE TO ME
B00DDXJRJG|4.0|Works great with Pandora or any music on my Kindle. Also great for sound track of rented movies I like to listen to wirh my Bose earphones.
0451232577|5.0|I have not had time to read the book.  I WILL READ THE BOOK WHEN I HAVE TIME.  THIS FALL
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's but it's awesome you get to  throughout gru's lab it's amazing I love despicable me's theme song bad day
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I picked this up on recommendation from NPR as a Summer read.  While it was fine mental popcorn, great writing it isn't.  Every chapter was an outstanding success for the characters, there wasn't much depth to the characters or storyline, most items were set up in an obvious manner and played out exactly like you predicted.  I would have just stopped reading it if I actually allowed myself to do so.  That aside, it was a globe-spanning action packed adventure with many interesting views into different parts of the world.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My husband and I have watched the movie again and again. It is funny and light-hearted. It is a family friendly story too:)
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Transformers allows you to let go and enjoy the &#34;what if&#34; in life and enjoy it.<br /><br />Good family fun. Great for kids and adults.
B009WUBERW|5.0|This was an exciting action movie that included every action star I have liked.  There were one liners that had us holding our sides, we were laughing so hard!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I can't get a clean shave from it  every week or so I have to dig out my20m yr old Norelco and shave off  what the new one missed
B001KT6JPA|1.0|At the same time this movie was worse and better than the book of the same name. Totally unbelievable in any capacity, gross simply for the sake of being gross. Don't get me wrong, I like a little pointless gore but not in this series, it's supposed to have some intellect to it (I thought). The villain is supposed to be super intelligent, so give the character a little credit (and Anthony Hopkins for that matter), and let their creepy abilities shine through. Ha.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I enjoy this game. As the game progresses, the ball paint combination begins to get a little harder and harder. I am stuck on one level right now and I am not going to give up until I successfully complete it.
B001RMYWG8|5.0|Serpico is one of the best movies Al Pacino made!  He is so real and you feel his frustration.  It is timeless!
B00004TEUX|5.0|This disc couples together highly popular and successful recordings from 1957 and originally available on LP records. The CD transfer id not begin to match that sound and was particularly thin and unpleasant in the midsummer music. The symphony, for some reason, was not so bad. The first thing to comment on therefore is the success or not of this latest mastering. The result it must be said is little short of miraculous and as described below.<br /><br />The mastering at 24 bits (dynamic range) and 96 kHz (frequency range) needs to be explained to be understood. Analogue recordings from the 1950's onwards had a wide dynamic and frequency range and certainly up to, and possibly beyond, the two above sets of figures. Early digital recordings were made on digital recorders with only 16 bits and 48 kHz of potential information. These figures clearly show the limitations of the recorded sound when comparing digital with analogue. Furthermore, the CD format was not capable of storing more information, unlike LPs or tape. All this explains why collectors using the top end of playback equipment were so often unhappy with digital sound. In summary this was simply a case of convenience over quality.<br /><br />Nowadays it is possible to digitally record at these higher ranges and for discs, especially SACD, DVD and Blu-ray, to hold all the extra information. This is also why a remastering, such as we have here, from original wide ranging analogue tapes to modern wider ranged digital media, is so successful.<br /><br />The result on this disc is the expected increased 'presence' with added dynamic and frequency response compared to the original CD releases. It is possible that by comparing original LP discs with these new CDs that the LP may still have the advantage, but that is not the real world for most purchasers.<br /><br />The performances are equally outstanding to the point where the competition is almost irrelevant. Maag had a natural feel for this period of music and also for Mozart. The music is light and transparent and truly dances in the most appropriate way for the subject matter. The orchestral playing is spectacularly fine with the LSO woodwind especially shining in moments like the famous scherzo. The brass are also superb with blazing horns at the conclusion of the symphony being memorable. Tempi is consistently perfect and the sense of joy permeates the whole disc.<br /><br />I would therefore suggest that this disc absolutely deserves to be described as legendary and as such deserves the strongest recommendation as a serious purchase option.also for Mozart.

1476735115|5.0|Love this book! I got about half way thru in 1 day, couldn't put it down. Really looking forward to getting to the end, then looking for more from this author!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I saw one episode awhile back but I wanted to catch up with a series everyone is talking about. If you are a soap opera watcher, a drama show watcher, a love story watcher, and a mystery watcher then you will love Downton Abbey.<br />I laughed, I got mad, and most of all I cried. I fell in love with all of the characters ok maybe not Thomas. Really I suggest you start from the beginning you have until January 5th when the 4 th season starts. Hurry watch them, I did it on my new Roku I bought from amazon. On the amazon app on my roku which it had a three seasons. Netflix didnt have it and Hulu had it but it kept losing the connection. But amazon worked great and I enjoyed watching this series.<br />Now go and watch it. Come on NOW!!!<br />;)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I adore the minions and the graphics are hysterical. What a treat for me in my downtime. Thank you for this fabulous game.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Is quite intersting, I like too much the interface of this app. Its can be used in so many ways that maybe will be my favorite app of this kind.
B0079J28NW|3.0|I love the Beatles & I love Yellow Submarine, but I was expecting the deleted scenes to be in this, disappointed that they were not included.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Of recent Clancy thrillers, this moves to the front of the pack.  A great modern day China threat that could happen in the near future.  Lots of action and intrigue.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|This is kind of fun the first time you play it, but you end up doing the same thing each time, just driving a car and mowing down pedestrian zombies, occasionally you might not get close enough to hit one and it will jump on your car then you've got to swipe something with the side of your car so it gets knocked off.  The only variety is when you get to a certain part past the one mile mark you get some sort of lottery thing happen, occasionally this is a gun which appears on your roof, then you can shoot the pedestrian zombies.  The graphics are okay but again you're seeing the same scenery and zombies each time.  While free (I wouldn't pay money for it) you might as well download it, but if you're concerned for space on your Fire, you'll probably put it back to store in your cloud shortly after and maybe download it to your device again in a year or so and play it a few times and repeat the procedure.  It just doesn't have the variety to keep it on your device.  You don't have to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this though, at least it has that.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|This is not working to charge my Kindle fire.  It still does not charge the kindle without holding the connection.
B00514HDNW|4.0|It definitely was a page turner and a very good science fiction novel. Totally different than the movie too. However, I gave the book four stars because even though I am a man, I got a sense of overly misogynistic view points coming from the main character suppose to be married during the 70's.
B00000IO4J|5.0|She is not one for scary movies so it must have been campy.  It was a fun movie for a teen.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved it is good  nice to see the first time in the first time I loved it and the way it  ends so cool.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1250012570|5.0|this book surprised me big time! It gives a whole new meaning &#34;Never judge a book by its cover&#34; meaning the story its self. Wonderful but I am wondering if there is going to be a part 2? that would be nice. I bought this book read it and then my daughter then her best friend and its been traveling since.
B003FSF14O|5.0|Very well done. There is allot of eye opening material along with, some jaw dropping material. More's best film yet. Put all the bankers in jail. Liquidate all there assets back to the state!
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|I rarely watch movies twice. This movie I have been watching over and over for 30+ years. Today I enjoyed it again with my children, who also loved it!
B007UPNA6Y|5.0|Well worth the read. One of the best Jack Reacher stories<br />Don't hesitate get it and enjoy the suspense and intrigue
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read novels.  It's as good as his two previous novels.
B0036FYO12|4.0|Old but goody spy movie!  A good suspense drama with emotions of a man seeing his CIA department eliminated and then trying to save his own live afterwards.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I agree with the reviews here; even better than Jane Austen.  Watched the whole thing in one sitting and was left wishing for more!
B00D2ZF3GQ|5.0|I don't go see a lot of movies these days due to the poor quality of story lines, plots and junk contents. My junior high son, husband and I do enjoy action, adventure, and meaningful content in movies though. Such movies are few and far between for us. My husband and I prefer to view and expose our son to quality messages if at all possible when we go to or view movies. Alas,... rarely happens :(  However I accidentally came upon this one while trying to find the \\"lesser\\" of the \\"evils\\"? of our movie choices one day! One of my adult children wanted to go to a movie with me, but knowing my chosen limitations to what I will go too, asked me to choose. I viewed some content reviews and listed this as one of the few possibilities. I asked her to make the final choice out of those options. Due to Will Smith being....well......Will Smith, After Earth won out. Neither of us expected too much, thinking the movie might fill the time in a bearable fashion. I expected little because of the current action/sci fi/adventure films labeled \\"family friendly\\" that are barely that! She expected little because it was on my list of possibly ok movies lowest in language/ gore/ sex and such! We were both pleasantly impressed!  This movie had adventure, a descent story line, action with out extreme over the top, unnecessary to story line gore, descent acting, and well.....Will Smith, and a good message to boot!  Yay!  oh......all the negative reviews seem to be (to me anyway)just a gauge as to where society's  morals, wisdoms and mindset has now fallen and now resides.
B002QYNIHU|5.0|Awesome quality and great articulation with awesome accessories. Can pretty much be posed in any way imaginable and look amazing doing so. SH Figuarts make great products.
B006RXQ1L6|5.0|It is a good movie. The music is fabulous, but the movie is not for children.  Has a sex scene in the beginning and language through out.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|It is tops for cleaning History, previous searches and unwanted files.  First cleaner I found that I could my Android Tablet with, and well as uninstalling unwanted programs.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I was ok until room 3. to get into the computer(and then get the key) u have to use the colors ....the only colors in the picture are the racing cars. when I adjust the colors of the computer password in the order that the race cars are....it does not work.....<br />can't get past this screen . the order of the race cars' colors are yellow, black, red and then green, (or green, then red--I forget) when I set those colors for the password of the computer, it just doesn't open it.
0470474874|5.0|This book is great. It covers all the parts of Excel that I use and then some. Great tool for creating Macros and for Formulas. Excellent desktop reference.
B008PUF3VS|4.0|This is a very readable book. I all but read it in one sitting. The characters seem real. We, the readers, gets to know them without lengthy introductions, it's a book that uses showing as its foremost descriptive mode, therefore we see the particular time and place through the eyes of the main character Bruno. Any judgements that are made are through the eyes, the persona of 9 year old Bruno. It is a book one thinks of long after reading. It's a book the reader gets involved in, has to do some work on the various clues. It's a well-written and important book.
B0053O89JM|5.0|I own them all. What can I say.  Sometimes I have House marathons when there is nothing  worth watching on TV.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|If you just need a basic or even scientific calculator then this is way more than you need. It's got so many different types of calculations available you probably have to be a math major to ever use them and they would only likely be used in school, lol. Definitely does the job though.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Action packed but yet coupled with comedic lines and twists, I loved this superhero movie. The only thing I didnt like were the silly censorship of  the swastika for some stupid squid logo and the hail Hitlers being done with 2 silly fists in the air. if you are gonna include hitler at least do it accurately and dont bastardize it to please the vocal mothers of the USA
B008M87GJK|3.0|Gives you lots of news from all over. You know the quality of their work and type of stuff they do so if you like the regular broadcasts then you'll like this app.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Having seen this movie a couple of time already I decided to buy it. Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent portrayal of Sherlock Homes. Also the Victorian London scenery is accurate. I was born in London, so I've been many times. This is a highly entertaining movie, with humor, action and some suprises along the way!
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|I love the game even though it's just random chance on whether or not you win. Then why the 1 star? Well even for a free game there are an insane amount of commercials. They show up even when you're just switching from the main menu to the options screen and they aren't just static little pictures either; they are full blown commercials that you have no choice but to sit there and watch. That would almost be bearable, but then they limit the amount of game play you get and try to extort money out of you for extra turns, or you've got to get the free turns that you must access every hour on the hour. I was just looking for a fun little diversion, not a game that hounds my every second reminding I have another free scratcher and then makes me watch crappy commercials while I'm waiting for another chance to play.
B003XDVUEG|4.0|Exactly what I needed to replace my worn out slippers. Comfort and breath ability.  Fantastic. They get dirty...throw them in the wash, perfect.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This thing is a must have. Instead of having to hook the kindle to your laptop you can just go to a 'website' and access all your kindle files there. Then you get a better look of what files are there, what junk is left behind and an easy way to put more files on there. If you're a fan of sanity saving apps then this one is for you :)
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Got this for a 6 year old who loved the movie. The game - not as much. But it;s ok.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app is truly amazing! Other alarm clocks that I've downloaded take forever!! This app takes about minute to download!! The best thing is that there are so many other features than just an alarm like you can chooses different styles of clocks and you and see the weather the date the time and many other things!!!  Setting an alarm is way easier than I thought when I first got this app!
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|GOOD GAME HARD TO CONTROL SOMETIMES BUT STILL FUN AND INTRIGUING, could use more for reaction with the shark  and details are great too , will continue playing till I get better lol
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is wonderful for passing time. It is challenging without being discouraging. Very addictive. I will definitely be watching for updates.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|No wonder its called Masterpiece Theatre.  I don't typically watch English productions.  But this has me now interested in finding out more about these actors.  I will definitely keep my eye out for more Jullian Fellowes material.  I can't imagine any living up to the quality of this one - but maybe I've just been missing something.  Every actor, every direction, every scene, truly masterful.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The only problem I have is once and a while it won't save my last game but that could be my kindle and God forbid I touch a house or what ever then I have pop ups to buy stars to make that house go faster. But all in all a fun game
B008C20TDG|5.0|It's hard to believe, but eating this way really does make you (or well me, I'm not sure about YOU) feel amazing. Give it a try!
B00011CZQU|5.0|This is a good movie. My son loves it. If you liked the 1st one, you will like this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version is easy to navigate gives me hours of fun on my train ride to work simple straightforward game of solitaire. No glitches or freeze ups
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|great movie we really liked it great action fantastic special effects. we would recommend this movie to every one.<br />it is one of the top movies of the year.<br />the first film was great also a must see
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome.. you should try it if you haven't.!!! It is very challenging and keeps you on your toes.!!
B000E1JOSE|5.0|The DVD of this performance is a joy to watch, and the CD of the music is great to listen to too. The best of Roy Orbison accompanied by some of the best musicians. What's not to like?
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book that is well thought out and comprehensive. The interview format worked for me and I think it is a very good story.
B004LROUNG|4.0|This story has the standard John Grisham characters, the old attorneys, the young attorneys, the bad guys, the big bad company. The story is a good read. I thought the ending felt forced and almost an attached afterthought. It's good entertainment without being the best of the best.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This is not a great film. It's just a solid, entertaining, mindflush -- you know what I mean? Not a fine film, but a very enjoyable entertainment -- a great vehicle for popcorn. You do have to suspend your disbelief some of the time. But it's a well-acted and well-directed entertainment.
B000V6738U|4.0|If you like Steely Dan songs this is the music to get. It has all of the great stuff, the good stuff and some of the other stuff. Good music and nice memories.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Movies starts off well, but falters at the end. Was the women a clone on the platform. What happened to her? The alien triangle? Maybe 2.5 stars.
B005L12SB2|5.0|I'm biased because I love Kansas, but All the original albums are here. Whether you like the early Art Rock albums, or the mid period success, or the last three albums focusing on Christian themes. That's right, two of the members converted to Christianity by Audiovisions. And Their last two albums John Elefanti became lead singer, after Walsh left. And they both sound a lot a like making an easy conversion. I like it all! And it is interesting to see how their sound evolved, if I could use that word. Later Kansas would regroup with minimal success. But the albums to get are from this time frame. My favorite is actually Monolith. Check it out for yourself.
0385366752|4.0|Audion version<br />5/5 for plot characterization and writing<br />5/5 perormance<br />2/5 based on my own personal reaction<br /><br />Wow that seems like quite a divide.  Let me start out by saying that Gillian Flynn has written this book masterfully.  The characters were very convincing.  When they spoke they came alive.  She kept me guessing as to who did what and what would happen next.  I really enjoyed the structure of the book.  Nick's character tells the story from the time of Amy's disappearance forward.  Amy's character is telling the story through diary entrys from when they met.<br /><br />The narration was very good.  This book has two narrators one for Nick and one for Amy.  Both narrators performed very well.  Even when the narrators had to speak as another character they made changes to tone or speech pattern that let the listener know they were speaking as someone else.  The production was more a radio play than pure narration and kept me thoroughly engaged.<br /><br />As for my own reaction, life is too short to spend with such unattarctive people. Based on my own subjective opinion I most likely will not be reading more of Gillian's books.  Too depressing for me.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This book is about Sophie, a girl who one day gets cursed with being old and has to deal with it.  A movie of the same name was inspired by this book.  I would recommend this book to children of all ages (and adults too).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book! Lots of detail... couldn't put the book down when I actually had time to read it! Loved it!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Absolutely loved this movie! Had our attention immediately. The fact it's based on a true story makes it even more intriguing. It takes some amazing brave souls to pull this off. These are our unsung heroes. This is truly a MUCH WATCH!!! Will be watching it again today. Ben Affleck.....stellar performance & directing! Impressed!
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Adele's voice is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant world of so-so musician’s.  Like doctor Hook said &#34;singing about truth and love at $25,000 a show&#34;  Adele is worth paying to see and hear
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Very addictive game. Enjoy it alot. It does get hard however. My grandkids and I love playing together to see who completes the levels the best lol
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|If you like AC/DC, Rose Tattoo and other such bands, you'll love this.  Hard rockin', in your face metal at its best.
0061122416|5.0|&#34;Perfect&#34; sums this book up in one word (at least for me). I finished reading it in a few days because I get absorbed in the story. As I was opening the book to the first page, something told me to not mark this book (as a usually do) because I would be reading it again. Having finished reading it I know I was right to listen to my gut because I'll definitely be reading it again.
0399226907|5.0|This smaller board book is great for the smaller hands.  The story line can be used to teach several topics such as science, counting, sequence. My students loved this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It crashed on me once (after months of play).  Uninstalled and reinstalled, and all was fine (but I lost my awesome high score).  I wish it kept your top 10 scores instead of only one, but it's a good version and easy to use.  And, of course, it's free!
0679890475|5.0|I used to read it to my own children, plus my children at school when I taught.  Now, this smaller size board book is ideal for a younger child to handle.  Classic and clever story.
0553062182|3.0|The book was overly dry, pedantic, repetitious, and verbose. I could not see myself gaining any particular insights or practical tips that I could use on a day to day basis from reading this book. Although it was initially a personally relevant and interesting topic for me, I have chosen not to finish this book because of its disengaging style.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|The average age of the world is increasing. Adoption of reading on portable devices and purchasing of titles from Amazon would increase if assistive technology were available for Android. Text to speech is already available on the PC and Kindle device. This is a missed business opportunity for Amazon.
B002ZG98G4|5.0|I love this movie. The storyline is great. Rachel McAdams is incredible. She's not only beautiful, but such a talented actress. Funny, smart, she hits her marks dead on in each scene. Diane Keeton was outstanding too. On the other hand, I really didn't like Harrison Ford's character. He's a fabulous actor, but I just think the over-the-top grumpy attitude was a bit too much. If it weren't for McAdams' performance, Ford's would have ruined the movie for me.<br /><br />I have seen this movie so many times that I finally broke down and bought the Blu-ray. If you enjoy a story about someone who struggles to achieve their goals and then finally lands on top, this is worth buying!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Fun fun fun I really like all the side games and the animation is great. I highly recommend this game
B00BP4X3W2|4.0|I think the movie has a certain appeal to the people who like to watch gruesome deaths and see a lot of violence. But the ending is positive and I think that the movie does contain a few good messages. So yeah, you want to watch one of the worst moments in human history directly followed by one of the brightest stories then this is a good movie.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This is a nice movie version of the book.  The movie is wholesome and suitable for all the members of the family.
0345803485|5.0|This book is fantastic!  At first I didn't know what to think, but the story line is catchy and I can't wait for the next book to arrive.  I hope it does before I finish this one.......which is going to happen VERY soon!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Awesome book told from the dog's point of view about life, love, being there for someone and the pressure illness puts on a family.  Tear jerk for sure.  MUST read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B009CGR0LA|5.0|Angelina is so sexy in this movie, I love the scene where she drives the car with her legs spread eagle.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|My husband and I have been listening to this cd over and over for two weeks. We just love it, especially track 5.  Just awesome.  Rating it a 5 just isn't enough.
B00DIFARQ6|1.0|First two missions are &quot;free&quot;, if I have to put up with the pop up ads before I pay I am not going to continue. Decent SIM but not worth the price.
B00AKKS278|3.0|It is a positive book and does have some good advice, but is absolutely nothing new or innivative.  Other choices are perhaps a better choice.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hated this dictionary so much that I wanted to pull my freaking  hair out this  book is jacked up so hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahahahahhahahahahahahhahahahhahhahahahhahahahahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahhahhahahahhahahhahahhahhahahahhahahhahhaahhahahahhahahhahhahhahahhahahahhahahhahhahahhahahahhahhahhahahhahahhahhahhahahahahahhahahhahhahahhhahahahhahahhahahhahhahahahahahahahahahaahhahahahahahahahhahaahhahahahhahahahhahahahahhahahahahahhahahahhahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahhahahhahahhahahhahahahhahahahahhahhahhahahahahhaahhahah
0691142165|4.0|The wealth of data is impressive.<br />The link between different economic magnitudes is very informative.<br />I guess very useful for researcher, but also useful for normal citizens or investors to detect when the accumulation of debt and the high spirit it gives is excessive and will probably lead to a painful bust.<br /><br />You need to like numbers to go into its reading.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|I've owned this movie for years, but because it was in black and white I never really got around to viewing it.  Well I decided to watch it and  it was totally delighted. I watched it at least 3 times in one week.  One of the best movies in my collection.
B0011Z3334|5.0|I first heard this song while playing Saints Row 2. The soundtrack for this game is the best as far as I am concerned and that includes S.R. IV from what I have read about the tracks for it. This is a fun song and the video is good, too.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|This was my first foray educational food literature and it was a blast. My friends are quite relieved I finally got through the book as I couldn't talk or think about anything else while in progress. Definitely a must read for anyone curious to how the current food world works
B001NHNG64|4.0|I love the Jack Reacher series, very well written and action packed!! The movie did not due these books any justice!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  My Brother in law recommended it to me and I can only say it made me appreciate my dog more.
B003YL4LF2|5.0|I am prepping for an important presentation in two days. This book takes the guess work out and makes the message clear. Build a story and involve your audience. Am excited to make it simple. Thank you Carmine Gallo for this authentic guide to one of the world's greatest presenters.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|One of the first books I ever read, and one that I read again and again when I'm in search of an answer.<br />Sandiago, a sheperd, leaves his sheep to follow his dream, which is to find the Egyptian Pyramids. Only to come back to where he began and... (it'll be a spoiler if I tell you!)<br />Recommended to readers with an interest in thought-provoking stories, fables, philosophy. That sort of thing.
B00A285OOW|5.0|Enthralling and wonderfully written just like her other books in the Cousins War series. Great research brings the characters to life, must read!
B005VMSATA|5.0|I watched the cartoon frist, And the movie had much of the same thing as the cartoon did, I really have to say this movie was very good, Something the hold family can watch.This was one of Ryan Reynolds best films full of fun and laughing on so very good moments through out. I would watch this again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it just wish it was longer. The levels are interesting enough to keep your attention yet not so much that you get annoyed.
B0010VD7EE|1.0|Save your money.  I had read reviews on the Plain Recordings pressing of Figure 8 and still purchased this.  This pressing sounds like an old dirty album right out of the wrapper.  It's that bad.<br /><br />I hope someone represses this soon and does a proper job.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I lost a lot of sleep after I started this book. Amazing how some writers are so capable of weaving an idea into a captivating  story and keeping our attention to the end. Impressive!!!!
1406307629|4.0|I really liked this book because i liked what the author did to it. The author really made this book interesting with all the monsters in it and all the details. It really felt like I was in the book because you can tell that the author really took time to get the readers hooked and interested in what was happening. But i do think that it was a little confusing in the beginning of the book with so many people here and there. It also seemed like things went fast, but if you read over it a couple times it was easier to understand what had happened. But other than that I think that it was a GREAT book!
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|My favorite scary movie of all time. Lily is a good actress. It's really scary though but I enjoyed it. I watch a lot of scary movies but this one actually scared me the most.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We purchased this movie at the request of our 9-10 year old grandsons to view in the car for our long ride to the beach. Even though they had seen it before they were engrossed in it again both on the trip to and from our destination. It is truly an up-lifting story that spans the years of youthful anticipation and elderly disappointment. The characters connect so intimately as the &#34;circle of life&#34; unfolds before you. Although there are bitter sweet moments in the film we all seem to feel a little kinder and a little gentler each time we watch it.
193700788X|3.0|I feel the last several Sookie books have been weak compared to the 1st several. As the culmination, this book left me unsatisfied.
B007G5H2HQ|5.0|Antonio Banderas clearly has such a great sense of humor! We enjoyed every minute of this movie! Must watch for anyone who enjoyed the Shrek movies.
B00AEBB8TM|5.0|What else could you say about a badly drawn cartoon about 4 little boys who cuss all the time.  This isn't &#34;Gone With The Wind&#34;.  Fun to watch, but not for the young just those young at heart.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I definitely couldn't stop reading once I started this book. The plot was so interesting and Ender is so brilliant that its always fascinating to see what else he thinks of and does.
0316056898|5.0|Jaybee Nana<br />I was late to this entertaining autobiography. It's easy to hear Ms. Fay's voice and her<br />sense of humor and sense of &#34;self&#34; in her writing. Highly enjoyable!
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I like it fine but I wish I didn't have to type in my ID and password every time I use it.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I own this movie and have watched it a few times - alone but with all the lights on! Lol. It is really creepy. Enjoy!
B005AUWY90|5.0|I loved knowing whose voices were behind the characters.<br />My grandson LOVES this movie and asks for it over and over.<br />I can hear him saying &#34;Aww dang&#34;  like Mater!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty fun and intriguing! Each level is fun to figure out. There are new elements. Thanks for the time filling entertainment.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Got this app for my Kindle Fire HD.  I love that I can get the current temperature when I start the app. I can easily get the 10-day forcast.  You can also get maps (setting custom ones), and videos are also available.  And the best part, the entire App is Free!  Wow, what more could you ask.  I recommend this to everyone I know.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|An extraordinary movie event...We need more of this type of cinema.... It has a feeling of truth that we so lack and yet the Congress is historically stuck it seems. Great Stuff!
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Peck is one of my favorite all time actors due to his consistent great performances. His style is unique and character credibility as believable as any real life.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is the perfect combination of love and action with such a great story line! My husband even got into the book, which is rare!
B0035YDM4Y|5.0|brings the realities of fighting al queada back to the people at home.  showcases the exceptional courage of US and coalition special forces
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I had never watched this and was never interested at all in the show until one weekend they had all 3 seasons on. I flipped through the channels and just stopped on AMC to watch it and I was there the rest of the day. The only problem was I was confused because it was season 3. So of course I had to buy all 3 seasons then.<br /><br />I love this show and even got my husband addicted to it when he HATES zombie movies! We both really enjoy watching this and right now are waiting impatiently for season 3 to be shipped and October for season 4 to start!<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this show. Awesome!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|A very well crafted story.  It was difficult to ever put the books down.  I was always eager to discover the next twist in the plot, which never once dulled from beginning to end of all three books in the trilogy.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I never ever thought I'd be watching this show but I love it! I've never really like scary shows or movies but now this is my favorite show by far.<br /><br />I love this show and season 2 is also awesome as the first season just thankfully longer! Daryl Dixon has to be my favorite character and I guess Rick would be second. I love everything about this show except for one thing.....SHANE!  That man really gets on my nerves!<br /><br />I've got my husband addicted to this show too so we're waiting for season 3 to be delivered and season 4 to start. Hurry up October!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Have always loved this game, now can play it and not have the cards all over the place, lol ~ ty Amazon!!!!!
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I have nothing more to add to the great reviews<br />it has already gotten. Just wanted to add my five stars.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I just got this hd kindle and noticed that black print on white background is blurry. So maybe it is not the e books fault
B005LAIIQC|1.0|Why oh, why do Hollywood magnates spend millions on writing, actors, etc. and pennies for a cheap hand-held camera. Why? I could see this stupid movie because the cheap hand-held camera did not allow to concentrate on the action taking place. Not that the action or plot was any good. I wish they would let me know when they are using a cheap hand-held camera in a movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book started off great, but half way through there were too many plot changes. The could possibly be because half way through you've figured out the big mystery.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Well written and researched masterpiece.  The major players were complicated characters with virtues and vices.<br />It is reassuring that the Congress of pre-war America makes the current Congress resemble the First Continental Congress.  A must read!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The game itself I guess is ok, my son liked it. I like a new technology dummy didn't read the full description of the game and my son, honestly not meaning too spent $87 with purchased right through the game. I hate games like that and I want my child to be able to just play a game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun!! I love minions !!&lt;3 it's action packed and has all the fun of other games I'm used to playing.. thumbs up all the way !
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very easy to pick up on how to play the game and very fun to play it gets addicting fast . Overall I think it's really great game to be in to.
B004OC07GM|5.0|Brilliant analytical approach. The logical progression of competition on functionality, reliability, ease of use and price in a hierarchy of user needs. Recommended for top management of companies providing products or services to have the disruptive technologies in their wings rather than overthrown by them. Also useful at the lower end of the spectrum on how to challenge the big players. Very good theoretical approach with practical use.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|i wouldn't recommend it to anyone. it doesn't allow me to view anything.it spins on loading for so long i don't get to watch anything. i tried removing it from my kindle but it wont come off. i regret getting it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|needs to go faster. more people can play at a time. other than that I love this game I play every day. nothing can make me uninstall on kindle fire. I Love UNO!
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Needs to learn sentence structure. Needs some editorial checking. Needs to review basic English writing skills. Story is cute sand predictable.
1451627289|5.0|I absolutely love this book...it goes back to a time in which I was a little girl.  Could this ever happen?  It really doesn't matter.  The book is written so well that I hate to put it down.  It is VERY long but I wish it were much longer.  One of my best reads of the summer.
B00E25KVLW|5.0|This is book for beginners. Great, funny and easy to read.<br />In first chapters you will red something about Ruby so you don't need Ruby know how before this book.<br />I like examples, everything in this book is described on examples.

B003O86FMW|5.0|After seeing the movie, I got book 2 and 3 on my Kindle and read both over a rainy weekend. Time well spent with both books that you can not put down until the last page...Cant wait for the sequel movie!!!
074401493X|5.0|Very good ,I don't read but I like it very much.There is a defact in it,soon after opening the book becomes wrinkled.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's a very very good game of u want to play minecraft on the go. It is very similar to minecraft on the pc or mac. The game gets upgrades that make it even better. Very good game I recommend it. And the multiplayer has gotten better.
B0001IMC8Y|5.0|Stellar film action-packed about family, friends and life's ups and downs. Everyone should see this movie, see it with friends and with your family.
B005D4YHA2|5.0|They fit well and they are very comfortable. Very well built and I expect I will be wearing them for a long time.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is my favorite game. I already have the mark 2 of war machine. I'm really good at it. My high score is in the four hundred thousands. I'm still only on Crimson Dynamo for the second time.<br /><br />This is the best game ever!

B00CH87HF4|4.0|Great Game...I never give anything a 5 star rating, but it was pretty close. I'd recommend it to other gamers. :)
B000083E79|5.0|I love all music of Sonny and Cher. I saw Cher in Vegas and she's great!!  This is a great cd to add to your collection!!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|My son's doctor told me about this book. I am thankful he did. It was great! I will definately recommend.
B006PHD0RW|4.0|I've had this game for over a year, have beaten it three times, and can honestly say it is a lot of fun, but new levels are never added other than multiplayer (aka Seedy's Booty) and it won't connect to Facebook. Otherwise, I recommend this game to everyone.
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|A different kind of role for Matthew McConaughey. A bit of shoot 'em up toward the end of the movie. Worth a watch.
B005DC68NI|5.0|i do not think i can add anything  to these other excellent reviews. i found edit most interesting. i was amazed the first time i even read any of the reviews (an obviously self published one) that the early reviews were scathing. he had a number of errors. and they were listing EVERY one of them. i felt the compulsion to mention that i had also noted these errors but had tried to read the story, not the lapses in grammar uso and i had found the storyline interesting and overall writing excellent. even greater was my amazement when the author responded to the critics rather then my nice comments. he assured them that his errors had now been corrected. i guess we were the beta readers. interestingly, many readers will be so distracted by my failure to capitalize the first word in each sentence that they will not be able to read what i am saying. anyway. good job.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|THE MOVIE WAS VERY WELL DONE.BOTH PLOTS TIED IN WELL.THE ACTING BY ALL WAS SUPERB-ED.I HAVE NEVER A KNOWN A FILM ,WHERE ALL PARTICIPANTS DID AN EXCELLENT ACTING JOB.THE DIRECTION WAS EXCELLENT AS WAS TO BE EXPECTED.
074356619X|5.0|This audio CD is a must 'listen-to'! It really captures the essence of how to be successful in this world.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|I WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT JUST LIKE THE ORIGINAL ALIEN MOVIE.I MUST ADMIT I HAD TO VIEW IT TRICE, BEFORE I COULD MAKE ALL THE CONNECTIONS.SPECIAL EFFECTS WERE USED JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THE FILM UP TO DATE.THE CAST OF CHARACTERS WERE WELL CHOSEN.THE FILM ARRIVED ON THE DAY EXPECTED.COST WAS VERY REASONABLE.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked how Peeta actuely expressed his feelings for Katness. But I kind of hated how Katness was playing him. But everything else kept me going and It's an amazing book! Can't wait to read the second!! :D
B00007KWHG|5.0|Loved the CD.<br />Loved, the songs.<br />Like the group.<br />Like being able to play the songs on my Kindle Fire<br />It is great.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|The movie was delivered to me 2 days ahead of schedule, it was a Christmas gift so that took the worry off wondering if it was gonna make it in time. It was exactly as described, and the package was unopened and damage free!
B00E25KVLW|4.0|But so far so good. Most technical books don't keep my attention for this long if that says anything to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game I love it. It reminds me of subway surfers just it's another great game you aren't only on one little scene that repeats there is a few great scenes and boss fights love this game.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very easy to use and really helps you learn the game.  I recommend it.  Really a great program to help with chess.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good at work because I can stop anytime to answer questions without losing anything. It would be nice if it saved in the middle of a level.
0689861141|5.0|I started reading this book to my son when he was about 6 months old. Now, just shy of 2, we still read this book a handful of times a week at bedtime. As he got older, he started counting the stars on the cover, identifying the animals, pointing out objects (moon, boat, bathtub, etc) and even mimicking brushing his teeth while the characters do the same.<br /><br />It's short and simple, perfect for babies and toddlers with short attention spans. Highly recommend.
B003GAMOIW|1.0|Had already seen it but wanted to watch it with someone who hadn't. Never occurred to me to check it out before the date of no return.  I think that there are different DVD formats for different parts of the world. I think they sent me one for the Middle East 'cause it has sub-title options for Arabic. Useless. Thanks for nothing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 didn't disappoint!  I didn't know if they could keep up with the great story line, but they did!!
1781162646|1.0|Being a Stephen King fan for so many years....I was dumbfounded by this story.<br />When I got to the middle of the book, I thought, 'okay, it's gonna get good now'....But it never did.<br /><br />Lame story. Boring.  Absolutely NOTHING exciting about it.<br />I am SO disappointed.  Wish I could return this book and get my money back!!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Captivating and well deserved of the high ratings.  Very likable characters and great interactions between them.  Great show and worth watching
B00AZQTYJW|5.0|Our daughter loves LEGO Friends. She first saw them at a friends house and was instantly obsessed with them. We purchased the \\"Olivia's Tree House\\" Set for her for Christmas and it was a big hit. Since then, we have purchased several additional sets for her collection.<br /><br />The LEGO Friends Downtown Bakery Play Set comes with 253 pieces. It includes two characters (Mia and Danielle). It comes a bakery store front with a sign and awning.  The back side is open so that you can play on the inside of the store.  It has a free-standing oven and baked goods display case.  It also comes with a lot of little accessories and features that offers a lot of playability.  It has lots of baked goods (cakes, pretzel, cookies, croissant, bread) along with cooking utensils, a cash register, display stands and even a fire hydrant on the outside to add a little touch of detail.  It is a really fun set with a lot of pieces to let your child's imagination run wild. The instructions are very detailed and easy to follow and the recommended age is 6-12, but a 5 year old will only need minimal help with it.<br /><br />One point of caution, the MSRP on the LEGO web site for this set is $29.99. If a set isn't Retired, you shouldn't have to pay much more than the MSRP. That is the going rate from WalMart/Target/LEGO and usually when Amazon is the seller. Some secondary Amazon retailers sell the Friends sets for much more so be careful if the seller isn't Amazon, especially around the holidays when Amazon sometimes sells out. Make sure to shop around.<br /><br />Long story short, this is a fun set that will be a great addition to your LEGO Friends collection. It can be incorporated with other storefront sets that your child may already have in their LEGO Friends collection and it has a lot of unique food related pieces that are great to have. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />=========================<br /><br />Please Note, there is a non-import version available here: [[ASIN:B00CNBGUHG LEGO Friends Downtown Bakery]]O Friends Downtown Bakery]]

B008AK8FHM|1.0|Considering a doctor wrote this, the logical fallacies found in it are absolutely absurd.  This doctor has absolutely no shame in this anecdotal account.  He attempts to appeal to the reader by using an appeal to authority fallacy.  He did not bother to acquire evidence.  He simply blathers on about being a doctor and such, attempting to establish credibility of his experience because of his profession.<br /><br />He makes claims in his book that he has absolutely no evidence of.  He claims numerous times that everything occurred while he was brain dead.  However, there is no evidence that was the point in time where his experience occurred.  He has no evidence on which to base that premise, yet he states it over and over as if he knows it for a fact.  High alpha activity can and does occur in coma patients.  As a doctor, he should have been well aware of this.  As such, it seems like the writer is intentionally lying to his audience to try to strengthen his case, which inadvertently does the opposite to anyone who actually looks into these things.<br /><br />His book goes against everything that anyone in the fields of science are taught; the scientific method.  He could have attempted to prove his experience through gathering information from other individual's experiences, conducting studies in hospitals (like Dr. Sam Parnia has and others are preparing to), and other verifiable, reproducible studies.  But instead, he sought to appeal to the ignorant and uneducated with just another anecdotal account that is easily dismissed by science.<br /><br />Maybe NDEs are a glimpse into an afterlife.  However, they might also be the body's coping mechanism, an experience caused by many chemicals being released in the brain at once, the electric jolt that scientists have recently discovered occurs (the findings came from a recently published study done on rats), and other explanations are also out there.  At this point, we really can't be sure.  One thing that is for sure though, you will not find the answers to the questions about the validity of NDEs in this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is great that the Bible is getting a new surge in distribution.  The kindle version makes available all the time.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This app is ok. Little slow on kindle fire. Has been a little quirky and freezes occasionally. Only played a little and game asked me to rate it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the game I have played it for years.  I can play all day everyday.  My 95 year old mother-in-law loves it too
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A wonderful read. I got used to the back and forth method of presenting the story and unfamiliar names and just enveloped myself in the story.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Glad I grabbed this as AOD. My wife and I are both completely addicted. Our tablet gets passed back and forth at night to play. A little easier on larger tablet screen than phone.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is very entertaining.  Grand kids even got into the game, helped with the clues and simple puzzles.  Scenes and photos are clear and engaging.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The wife and I loved it, but she wanted to give it 10 stars<br /><br />All well, Matthew McConahay is now showing his versatility and maturity with his last two offerings.<br /><br />He's always been a great talent, but the combination of the cinematography, the kids, MMc, snagged-toothed and raw,  Gives the director an incredible pallet with which to paint this insightful and entertaining flick on our eyebonz.<br /><br />ch

B00338QENI|5.0|Author Rebecca Skloot wrote a very personalized and easy to read story on the woman behind the cell samples that revolutionized modern medicine. While the rest of science only knew them as HeLa cells, a 31 year-old black woman who had led an extremely difficult life in the segregated south, Henrietta Lacks was never viewed as a human being. The author humanizes the woman behind the story and her family who suffered once her identity was revealed. I actually read the book twice through because there is so much historical information, you can't absorb it all in the first pass.<br /><br />I deeply appreciated the author's efforts to find the very real woman and the human story of pain and suffering from which virtually every American today has benefitted.
B007N3GZ9C|5.0|This is a great book on many levels.  It is a biography of a woman that had a hemorragic stroke, was able to save herself, and her recovery.  The first half of the book explains what she felt and went through.  The second half is more on the biology of the brain and how the left side and right side communicate with each other.  She does an excellent job of explaining the physiology in a way that is easy to understand and should be great fro both medical professionals and lay people alike.  I had it in soft back and ordered it in hard back as this is for my library.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|An excellent production for those who can follow the English and Scottish dialects. This is an eight part series so it will take some watching but worth the effort.
B005DF2QMC|2.0|I worked several days ,following the instruction manual, but trouble figuring out how to get it to transfer to Mp3. Once I did, I could'nt find way to transfer to MP3 device( walkman).

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such a fun and great game! I think that a lot of kids would like this. I know that my little cousin is addicted!
0062255657|2.0|I think that an unusual premise and a little fantasy introduced into the real world are enough to keep a reader's attention for a few pages.  But at some point you simply have to become invested in the characters to continue.  Therein lies the failure of this fine, very short and yet seemingly never-ending, work of fiction from Neil Gaiman.  The characters are no more fleshed-out than Hansel and Gretel or Narcissus or the Trix rabbit for that matter.<br /><br />Imagine dragging Goldilocks and the Three Bears out for a hundred seventy-five pages, filling it with a strange concatenation of faux-folksy talk and vague theological references, and you will not be far from this work.<br /><br />In the end you will probably believe that you have been told something--about the nature of God or gods, or reality, or life, or death, or anything.  But I defy you to pin it down, because in the end meaning from this will prove as elusive as those floating things in your eye.

B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This app is really fun and easy to play. I think that the only down part of the app is how much everything costs coin wise

B006LSZECO|5.0|A couple of young lovers from the big city head to a small town to find paradise. Or do they? Upon arrival in the backwaters of Missouri two people who knew each other so well discover they may not have guessed the deep inner secrets each holds. And one of them suddenly is gone. From here winds a tale that keeps the reader always finding the &#34;right&#34; clue, only to lose it again. I have to say I was ready for a chic book, but Ms. Flynn's tale is a great read for the guys looking for that mystery that is not based on a sad sports hero. I confess as well, I never guessed the end. A can't put down read.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Game is repetitive and the coin accumulation via game play is very slow. Cost to purchase coins and escalating cost of upgrades sucks.

B00C8RDSWK|5.0|Despicable Me is an awesome movie.  The movie is very clean and kid friendly.  There was only mild bathroom humor.  Kids obviously love the movie, but adults can enjoy this movie just as much.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|it reminds me of doctor who, except more adultish.  i love love love John Noble.  the cast is great and the story line is pretty clever.  I am sad that this show only lasted 5 seasons.
B008M721MS|3.0|UPDATE - DECEMBER 2013: Please fix the new updated version of Skype. The update has only been on my kindle about a week, and it's already closed on its own several times on a daily basis. Throw in the occasional status \\"switching\\" from \\"available\\" to \\"unavailable\\" or \\"invisible\\" and it's getting extremely annoying to constantly have to sign back in.<br /><br />The other issue is that I now can't hear my fiancé when I Skype with him using my Kindle Fire HD, so I no longer have the ease of moving around at my leisure. When using the connected Bluetooth keyboard my Kindle's case came with, the \\"Enter\\" no longer sends the chat messages; it simply presses \\"Enter\\" on the message. So now I can't use my Bluetooth keyboard with Skype at all, and have to use the touchscreen even when we video chat.<br /><br />The one upside is that I haven't yet had to enter my password to sign back in. But the random closing? No. Not good. Please fix it!! :(<br /><br />-<br /><br />Being a military significant other, I LOVE this app for the convenience of being able to talk to and see my Sailor when we're spending the majority of the year apart.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give a 4 or 5 is because of the signing out in general; if I didn't have that constantly, I would DEFINITELY have given it 5 stars.<br /><br />Thank you to whoever invented not only Skype for the computer, but Skype for the Kindle and iPhone: the constant separation from my Sailor due to his job in the Navy is that much more manageable!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We just love this movie!  All the characters and voices are perfect!  The story and music is heartwarming and entertaining.  We will watch this movie many times, especially when we need to feel good about life, etc...

B00CBRH4YU|5.0|First off, for purposes of technically aspects, I'll say that the digital download I purchased on Amazon looks fantastic.  No issue there.  Now a review of the film.<br /><br />It's easy to see why people, even fans of THE TREE OF LIFE, would be turned off by Malick's latest effort; the cryptic editing and wandering shots are on full display, with very little attention to a through-line.  I delayed my viewing of the film until recently based on initial reactions, despite my absolute admiration for Terrence Malick, but I regret that immensely; this film not only serves as a brilliant companion piece to THE TREE OF LIFE, it goes to far darker territory and is very confrontational about the hypocrisies of life and the struggle to live up to expectations.  What most opinions on the film seem to gloss over is the incredibly powerful sequences involving Javier Bardem as Father Quintana, especially the scenes of him walking around town and visiting local residents, who are obviously played by non-actors.  These sequences are so beautiful yet so raw, daring in how down to earth they are.  Malick's films are pretty much dramatic nature documentaries, but this is the closest to an actual documentary that he's made, and it's spellbinding.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|This game is very annoying..constantly freezes..and I purchased coins once and never have received them....always freezes when I purchase 2nd chance shadow card and I loose all my chips.
B005544V6A|5.0|What can I say? Harvey and Mike are formidable. Jessica, Rachel and Donna are my sheroes. Even smarmy Louis is a wonderfully annoying character. This show is an example of writing excellence. I love this show.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Really addictive. It has the just one more shot factor. You realise you've been playing for hours. Get it NOW.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I'm thoroughly enjoying the game but the items can be very small. I feel silly but I just discovered you can zoom into the pictures by pinching. This should be included in the tutorial. Also the block game seems to start off too hard and I had to play another app (unblocked me) in order to understand the play.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is an awesome it's just that the costumes cost to much and the tokens are very hard to get

B005544V6A|5.0|I loved watching the excitement, and different cases. The characters are wonderful. The show is very classy, but yet funny at the same time. I looked at season 2 in one day. I can't wait for the next season. Everyone on the show is very competitive. Stay tune to see what happens.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  It is something all of us born well after WWII should see.  Our WWII vets are quickly slipping away.  Our grandfathers and those of that generation truly were our country's greatest generation.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|Excellent, I slept with the lights on for two nights. Great surprise ending. bokeem Woodbine was great. Elevator makes it more suspensful

B008JFUO36|4.0|Oblivion is an interesting and refreshing entry in the Sci-Fi genre.  Lately the Sci-Fi films that have come out are mainly style over substance.  The Transformers films are ones that quickly come to mind.  I am a big fan of science fiction!  Oblivion and the new Star Trek movie are the two movies that I wanted to see most this summer.  I was not disappointed with this film!  Oblivion is a film that makes you think.  When I watched this film in the theater I did not fully understand what was going on.  When I thought about it more on the way home I began to piece everything together.  I like science fiction films that can do that.  This film reminded me of films like Blade Runner and 2001: A Space Odyssey in terms of the atmosphere and tone.  It also reminded me of films like Wall-e and I Am Legend.<br /><br />The special effects of this movie are fantastic.  This film is able to create a beautiful looking world, and immersing the audience in it.  The action scenes, when there are action scenes, are very well done.<br /><br />The character of Jack, played by Tom Cruise, I found to be likable and interesting and wanted to know more about.  Morgan Freeman's character is also likable.  The other characters though are pretty bland.<br /><br />Oblivion is also quite slow and has a slow build especially at the beginning.  There is not much action in this movie either.  The common movie viewer might not like this film, because there is not a ton of action in it.  The trailer built the movie up as an action-packed Sci-Fi film with Tom Cruise, but that is not what this is.  However, I find Oblivion a very refreshing and enjoyable Sci-Fi film.
B00CZF87TY|2.0|Ok sure it has some of the songs you would expect but I think 4 is it. The rest is the actual score (background music)<br /><br />Totally not what we expected. My 3 year old was rather disappointed.
B00C7JGDBW|4.0|Oz the Great and Powerful, in my opinion, is a fun and entertaining film, for the most part, and a worthy entry in the Oz series.  The world and characters of this film are fun and colorful, with some exceptions.  This film, however, has some flaws which bring the movie down for me.<br /><br />The main cast is colorful and fun to have an adventure with.  Oz starts out a jerk, but I still liked him, because you can tell he has a good side.  By the end of the film he becomes a very likable character.  The side characters are also fun.  My favorite character of the film would be the little china girl.<br /><br />However, the villains, I thought, were bland and non-engaging.  Mila Kunis, in my opinion, did a bad job as the wicked witch of the west.  She did not have the presence or the charisma that the original wicked witch had.  The other witch was fairly boring also.<br /><br />The production values for this film are great.  This movie does a good job at creating a beautiful looking world immersing the audience in that world.  The design of the residents of Oz looked great too.<br /><br />People are divided over this film.  Some like, while others do not.  This is most likely because people compare this to the original film, the Wizard of Oz.  I do agree somewhat.  While this film is a good, film, and in some ways superior to the original, this film I do not find as memorable as the original.  I still, however, find this to be a very competent and enjoyable film.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Amazing extension of the laptop version and a happy user. Overall a great way to organize notes from the books I read.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Old format was better. Would have given it a 5 star. New one is not as easy to read, so the new one gets 2 stars.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Most gameloft games take up a lot of space but this one didn't. Best tap and wait game on the here and a cool story
0399255370|4.0|I really liked the story, but often times found it hard to read as the colors were so faint.  The concept was refreshing and very interesting.  For future releases you may want to darken the print a little, so that people in my age group who are beginning to have difficulty seeing without a lot of light, will have an easier time reading it to the grandchildren.  My 4 year old grandchild was very patient and really seemed to enjoy the story too.  I think this book would work best for children in prekindergarten or older, as a younger child would lose interest quickly.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|opening your eyes to the world that Jesus was born and lived in gives you a much better understanding on the person he was and why. Understanding that at the time he was only one of many who preached and that the myth of Jesus was really started by those who came after him.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|...written from the perspective of the main character, Christopher, who is an autistic teen.  Interesting insight into how an autistic person moves through the world.  Enlightening and at times comical.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like Spider, gee whiz why did I do this.  Silly very silly.  I won't do this again for sure
0446699616|3.0|I can't add much that hasn't already stated in the other 1,900+ reviews of this novel.  I've read every other novel by Nelson DeMille and in my humble opinion the CIA must have kidnapped him and then had some Company hack write \\"The Panther\\"; perhaps to avenge Ted Nash?<br /><br />Initially, I was excited to see John Corey and Paul Brenner working together.  I really like the Corey series and I love, love, loved the Brenner character in \\"Up Country\\".  Man, that was a really awesome read.  Sadly, however, Paul Brenner in this novel is a flat and doesn't rise to more than being Corey's second fiddle, and an uninteresting one at that.<br /><br />I'm a loyal DeMille fan and enjoyed the book but it could have been much better.  If this was your first DeMille novel, please try \\"Up Country\\", \\"Cathedral\\" or \\"The Charm School\\" to see what he's truly capable of.
B0047WJ12K|2.0|The fake science is so confusing that the story is completely lost. The only reason that I could follow the story at all is that I saw the preview which sort of explained that the main character was breaking into people's dreams and stealing their secrets. This was never shown in the actual movie. A large part of the film is a dream within a dream within a dream, That was unnecessary. A single dream would have been sufficient for the story and would have made it much easier to follow.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Much like the original myst, this game will keep you having a great time. Wish it was longer! Great game though.
B009NXV2RK|4.0|While the good guys typically win the day, the core events depicted in the book provide a sobering look at the realms of what may be possible in our world of diminishing resources, and provide for an entertaining read.  You may think twice about buying that next 'made in China' household necessity though.
B004UID2LC|5.0|There are so many videos I have wanted to share off of youtube and I was never able to due to a lack of wifi.  However now I don't need wifi.  I can play them right off my phones memory.  This allows me to show what I want, when I want.  Yes.  1000 times yes.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|As a fan and player of the card game for almost 20 years. I am very happy with this installment of the game for the tablet.
0805047905|5.0|it's a classic, had the paperback for my oldest, 5 years later it was ripped so prefer the board book so my younger child can learn.. she loves being able to &#34;read&#34; a book on her own, it's perfect for 1-3 year olds
B00CF34B2I|4.0|Great game a good way to waste time I have a really good time playing its also very addictive so had to buy full version
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Really awesome! I love this show.  The characters and storyline are so interesting and well developed.  I can't wait to start on season three!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really fun and interactive. I enjoyed deciphering the puzzles and watching the story unfold. I just wished it would last longer.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|My little brother loved it.  the multiple clips give him a distinct advantage when in the situation of being flanked by his older brothers.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|A short collection of  beautifully written poetry. They are sensual and erotic and tastefully done and I enjoyed reading several a few times.<br />There were some favorites that I related with and to be put into such exquisite words, what lucky women.<br />I liked how I was reminded to breath occasionally and while reading this great book of poetry look for Her Flow, Midnight, and Forbidden Dance just to name a few. Don't forget at the very end Pose For Me. Loved It!
0060168366|5.0|I strongly recommend this book, I have read all of Paul Johnson books, this one is especially very well write and the historical analytical framework is very intelligent and erudite. I wish there were more advocates like this on Latin America history.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|Finding her feet is a great story that I think many will relate with.<br />Amanda's family becomes dysfunctional after her twin drowns in a terrible accident. The secret she keeps in her life leads her down a path of self-destruction with drugs, alcohol and other bad choices.<br />It is easy to empathize with the characters in this book. If it hasn't happened in your family chances are you may have known someone in similar circumstances.<br />A very well written and relatable novel, it did leave a lump in my throat and a pain in my heart.<br />Just the same, I would suggest this beautifully written story.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I WANT CANDY CRUSH. Not this. I really thought that was what this would be. Granted, it is helpful, but I want the actual game.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I like it. Its a lot better than the mobile version. Everything is right in front of you on ur tablet just like if you was sitting home at your computer.
B0041VT6HW|2.0|Didn't make it through. Flat and boring development. All of the best scenes were apparently reserved for the trailer. Best to watch this one when it is offered for free.
B000083E79|1.0|Have enjoyed watching Cher's Farewell video and the excited and joy in her voice.  The CD is not fun to listen to.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|The story line is enjoyable, but it's the shots that make this movie shine. So many moments that are filmed beautifully, capturing the essence of the scene. This is a movie that is visual, almost like a lengthy music video, and while there is a good plot and several characters they never feel fully developed. Some interesting twists and I highly recommend watching it a second time after the first once you know the ending so you can look for clues in the movie you may have missed the first time through. Overall I enjoy this and own it now so I can re-watch it - missing some of the depth I'd like to see from a 5-star movie but again the fact it is enjoyable, has great action sequences but overall just a pleasure to watch warrants 4 stars for sure.
B00AW8UK0K|4.0|Easy read, full of interesting information.  A mate is doing this diet and has reduced is weight from 82kgs to 76kgs.  I'm into it 3 weeks now and have dropped 2kgs.  There is something in the diet and the guidance and insight provided by this book is invaluable.
B004HYDL1K|5.0|Knowing how this is supposed to play out it delivered exactly as promised. Definitely a campy, quirky, fun adventure that makes fun of the old flicks but delivers plenty of action and fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wonderful book from start to finish an abundance of plot twists engaging readers but leaves me asking what else after reading the final chapter
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Was really what I was hoping for considering the cast and crew. Some great action sequences, a quirky and fun plot line, plenty of funny moments.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|When I log in I'm unable to access my content. The interface is nice but that bug needs to be fixed
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|This was a well waited toy to get for my daughter, she loves this toy so much. It its a great edition to get collection.
B00005Q45W|5.0|As Leonard Cohen has aged, his voice has descended to a breathy whisper that is still recognizable as the shadow of the voice of the earlier albums.  He always was a bit of a minimalist (forget the flirtation with Phil Spector!), and here things are even more stripped down.  The instruments are soft and back in the aural mix, and Leonard's whispered lyrics are echoed by the voice of the singer/songwriter Sharon Robinson (who should perhaps have been credited with equal billing here) in a way that creates a kind of aural halo behind Cohen's voice.  In his mid-60's when this album was produced, Cohen is now meditating -- talking to himself, almost -- on the difficulties of sustaining love and truth (including truth about oneself) and on the old romantic theme of the imagination's power to mock us by presenting us with ideal visions of ourselves that we can't attain.  So, if one had to sum it up, \\"necessary failures\\" would be the sober theme of this album, and the mature acceptance of failure and loss would characterize its mood.  There are some strong songs here -- In My Secret Life\\" and \\"A Thousand Kisses Deep\\" are about the way the imagination can both console us for and tease us with our limitations.  Even better is \\"That Don't Make It Junk\\" -- an assertion of the value of a flawed life, and the albums nearest thing to a witty song.  The discomforts of the consciousness that one's life has external comforts is the theme of \\"The Land of Plenty.\\"  There is one indubitably great song on the album -- \\"Alexandra Leaving,\\" a reworking of a poem by Cafavy and, in Cohen's version, focused on the need not to deceive oneself about what one is losing, but also a celebration of what is lost and its value.  That's what the lines about honor are getting at and that's why self-deception is denounced as a \\"strategy\\" that one shouldn't stoop to.  It is as beautiful and moving a song as Cohen ever wrote.  If you don't want to buy the whole album (quite inexpensive by now) download that one to your mp3.hat one to your mp3.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|Wait! I'm old. I'm smart. I'm educated. I like serious stuff. Well, this is a seriously fun and seriously important bio-pic. If you forgot what it is like to be young, watch this movie. If you want to re-ignite a little in yourself, watch this movie.
B0095P31L6|5.0|Everything is beautiful in this movie, the music, the scenery, the voice-overs and of course all the ugly looking desert animals and insects!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Interesting perspective of a sled dog's life. The harshness of nature is revealed. A good book for people who like Alaska.
B0093Q8W0C|4.0|Looks great in HD on my new LG GA7900. Looks great from my ROKU on my older LG 42 inch LCD also.
B005M0PJ8Q|1.0|The DVD case cracked within 20 minutes of opening. The DVD wouldn't play because it said playback wasn't allowed in my area.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun to play, challenging for hours. Really enjoyed playing it. I look forward to the next exciting installment of this game. Keep up the good work.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I'm in awe with this book. It was rough. It was that kind of book that no matter how much you want to go to sleep, you can't put it down. That \\"just one more page\\" turns into \\"one more chapter\\" and when you least expect it, you're way deep into the acknowledgements, wishing to read Losing Hope straight away to get more insight to this story from Holder's perspective.<br /><br />Sky and Holder were amazing characters. The chemistry between them was electrifying, but most importantly, they had this thing to find humor, despite the circumstances. It was impressive their ability to crack a smile when everything was wrong, and I deeply admired them for it.<br /><br />I also loved the way Holder took his time to think every word he was going to say. Always looking for the perfect words, and when there were none, silence was beyond perfect. And, Sky's way to react to judgments is something I wish I had in me, to not let anyone step over me and to not care about what people think.<br /><br />Tough issues are dealt here, ones that go deeper than the ones we face day by day. Ones that we wish would never happen, the ones that make the sky and stars fall around us, leaving you in pitch darkness. Alone. Hopeless.<br /><br />Read this book, you will swoon and love it just like I did. Trust me.<br /><br />* You can also find this review at Book Travels Book Blog. *
B00280LYIC|4.0|Awesome! It was thrilling and fun Mr.Riordan finds ways to make even the most stressing parts of the book funny
B00992CF6W|5.0|I bought this game and the second I started I couldn't stop! It might not be as good as the full version but it's still amazing! YOU ROCK NOTCH!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. They have specials about going t9 different countries and everything. It is way more fun and a lot less linear than temple run
B000FC10QG|5.0|Although the material is ancient history, it is relayed in such dramatic narrative that it creates a real story.  Really couldn't put is down even though I knew how it was eventually going to work out.
B0030B621W|5.0|Loved it great read.  The piece is good and funny and was exactly what i thought it would be. Great
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Fantastic story with almost too much detail, but I loved all of it!  Thanks!!  I can't wait to read the next one.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the third of Hosseini's novels that I have read. I have enjoyed them all,<br />but I think that his writing keeps getting even better. I fully recommend it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It's lived up to all it's hype from the show and it's absolutely worth buying. It belongs in any book  collection and a must read.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|If you are a fan of punk or interested in obscure bands, this documentary about a small group of brothers that was able to catch the zeitgeist, unfortunately for them and for us, 5 years to early.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|Loved this movie in the theatre so I had to buy it on blu ray dvd!  Matt Damon is fantastic!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|great nice can see all of what is happening with the battery charging system in one spot with no problems
1909313033|5.0|Gemma Correll certainly knows pugs. Every rule of etiquette perfectly matches my pug's quirky habits. If you are a pug owner be prepared for a humorous read.
B0047E9TRA|4.0|I liked it because I actually wanted to see this movie in the first place and &#34;yes&#34; I was surprised to see the actor John Travotla in the movie.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|Like parts of app but can't figure out how to upload to face book, do you know where I can go to get help? Will return if can't upload to face book.
B008BQ8VOC|1.0|I was really let down as this season kept adding not only foul language but more sex shots.  Why can't they write the great stories without all the trash?  I won't be buying anymore seasons.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|It was interesting and amusing.  The actors acted their roles well.  The environment captured interesting scenes<br />In England, including the lavish castle-like mansion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good game to play and a lot of fun.  I play it while watching the television.  You should download this game today.  You will like it
B0071R43MG|5.0|This is the first 3D concert I thought would be worthwhile.  It was so real in 3D!  I hope to see more like this one!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's very fun my daughter's are so easily entertained when they play this! They are attached to it! It's fun, kid friendly,entertaining,addictive, and cool!
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is very fun and addicting if you like puzzles. The only downfall is the pieces are the same no matter what the puzzle.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I use games as time-fillers for my breaks at work or while waiting for an appointment. This one has tiles with colorful icons stacked in interesting shapes and I enjoy clearing the board. One of my favorite free apps.
B00BEIYH6U|5.0|Being a hardcore fan of the first Kick-Ass, I will admit that I was skeptical about the second movie. Why? A different director and the comic was not amazing...I see now that I had judged too soon! Kick-Ass 2 does exactly what it sets out to do- it gives you an enjoyable, cool experience. I found myself feeling various emotions throughout. I found myself near tears due to laughing, I found myself sad when certain characters were killed off, and I felt pumped for the climax. Chloe Moretz, Jim Carrey and Christopher Mintz-Plasse stole the show with their great performances. Plus, the Mother****er provided many of the laughs.<br /><br />Don't listen to the critics; this is a sequel that lives up to the original (Maybe better?!) and you should check it out!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|in the beginning I was a lil confused as to what to do. but once I got it I was hooked. this game will have you thinking.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This book was a real nail biter.  Never knew what would happen next.  Very well written.  Archer continues to make you want the book never to end.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very fun game. It's different from other game apps in a good way! I suggest u try it and I am confident you will not be disappointed!
0679805273|3.0|I was under the impression, evidently wrongly, the book would be included. Nope! It's not a complete gift without the book.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Even though I,'ve never played Dragon vale my friends say it's the best chance in the world that's all they ever talk about.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|As a very busy career woman, wife and mother of 3 boys in college, I have virtually no free time to enjoy a good book. A Discovery of Witches, and it's sequel, Shadow of Night, were recommended to me while I was on a rare trip home to New England to see family. I picked up a copy of A Discovery of Witches at my sister's house and began reading. As the title of my review relays, I couldn't put it down. I devoured both books within 5 days. Deborah Harkness has created a story that draws you in to a magical adventure of family, love, and history. In the story, Harkness has woven together fictional and non-fictional characters alike. While absorbed in the books, I found myself Googling character names to learn more. In the second book, the author took me back in time to Elizabethan London, revealing the politics of the time, living conditions of both the aristocracy and commoners, all the while keeping my interest piqued on how the story unfolds. It's one of the story's that leaves you wanting more. I'm anxiously waiting for the final book of the trilogy to be published. Loved it.
B0067R0APK|1.0|I really like the AccuWeather folks for their open and honest forecasts! The free app for Android works well except for the adds. The paid app from Amazon quit working fully after a week. The maps would not load. Just a blank page. I went back to the free app from Google Play and everything works!
B0070YDOT8|1.0|don't know is it good or not. . i did not pay with it. it said free but is not really free . keep asking to by cone
B001EBV0OY|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! It is a great story and the two main characters do a fantastic job.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I love it. Its a great game. Im a gta fan and it is just like it. Kind  lol. Great game to pass time
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I consistently found myself becoming emotionally attached to the characters. It is a must read
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Your game is awesome but there is just one problem I have too press my card three times but other than that your game is great
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This is the Black Sabbath fans dream come true. Except for the absence of Bill Ward the band is back and sounds much like where they left off before Never Say Die.<br /><br />A must have for the collection.
0399101284|5.0|Of course, it was required reading in High School, when  it first came out ... but you have to read it again to appreciate.
B000002H4C|5.0|A blast from the past. Loved the movie and missed the music. It is a great compilation of songs from a movie that disappeared for a while. If you grew up in the 80s and enjoyed this movie and music then I think it is a must own.
1603427244|5.0|very informative.  easy to use.  wanted to learn different methods to cast on and cast off.  will use it alot
B006M4F67A|4.0|This game can be played classically or with a twist. It's visually stimulating and has everything it needs to capture your attention while passing the time.
B00BB8Q13A|5.0|This is a funny yet poignant story loosely based on Shakespeare's &#34;Romeo and Juliet.&#34; Well-known lines from this and other plays get woven in beautifully to create comic or romantic effects. The actors and the acting are first rate. One really associates with and likes (or hates) the characters. The scenery and the music truly enhance the story. I would definitely recommend it and would watch it again.
B003B02O7I|5.0|I thought this book provided a lot of insight about a man fighting his own demons and finding God through a missionary he only met once. I loved the ending, it was a total surprise.  John Grisham never fails to surprise me with his masterful story telling.
B003UAKE9Y|1.0|I bought it because I was a fan of Tim Burton and loved Nighmare Before Chrstmas. This DVD was one of the worst I've ever watched - in fact I got rid of it for 50 cents within a few days of buying it - so yeah I threw away $5 on this junk. Story was horrible too....stupid, lame, you pick an adjective for &#34;it sucks&#34;.<br /><br />Don't waste your money like I did.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't want to read this after seeing the pathetic movie.  But after a friend told me the books were better, I thought I would try them out. I am glad I did.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie when it came out, and when I watched it again on one of the movie channels, so I had to add it to my DVD collection. Used copy works fine and packaging was in good shape, - I'm satsified.
B008393Q2O|3.0|The idea is good, but for what I need - an easy way to keep track of things - it's a little complicated.  I don't use it much, but I did keep it.
B0097AQEOK|4.0|Great 10 album collection on CD and has all of her best albums - Ladies of the canyon, Hissing of summer lawns. Blue, Court and Spark (to name just a few).  Only reason I deducted one star is that the indivual CD's are packed in cardboard containers made to look like the original albums - they do and they &#34;look&#34; great. BUT because it's a shrunken down copy of the album the text is not legible and is useless to try to read (even with a high powered magnifying glass light). I would have expected a book to be included with all the words, liner notes, musicians, etc. especially for the $45 price.
B008LH4YYC|4.0|I'd give it 4 stars, but haven't quite figured it all out.  I use it mostly for cleaning out the cache on my android to I have room, but it has many, many features.  Good App!
B0042EJD5I|5.0|Not a cheap purchase but this was a classic album by King Crimson and my old copy was missing from my album collection so I had to get it.  This is made with 200 gram vinyl and it is HEAVY!  Good quality packaging too.
B00CA3C1N4|1.0|The game is confusing and difficult. Maybe it is just me, but I didn't see the point of it and deleted it from my android.
B0047BBWFK|4.0|Sade is one of my favorite female vocalists and I enjoy her music on vinyl - in fact the first time my son (a musician who also happens to like Sade) heard me play her Diamond Life album on vinyl he was left speechless. He had only heard the CD and digital download versions and was stunned at the huge difference in sound/music quality that he heard from vinyl.  We also did an A-B comparison of the CD vs vinyl of many of her older albums and in every case he preferred the vinyl version for the sonic quality.<br /><br />Anyway...I give this album only 4 stars because it was not as quiet a recording as I expected. One of the tracks had more vinyl noise then it should have, but I was too lazy and didn't want to send it back and, after I bought the album, I was told it was on backorder.<br /><br />I will skip the track by track review - a few other reviews have that covered (check out some of the 5 star review for that). I'll only add that if Sade releases an album I will buy it.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This is a very good mouse, works nicely so far. I've been using a Logitech 500 mouse for a few years and this mouse appears to be even a little more customizable than that mouse brand. And it fits in my hand like a glove, very comfortable. Only slight gripe I have is that I wish it came with heavier weights, I just prefer my mouse to be a little heavier. But that is a pretty minor gripe. Overall, very pleased with this mouse.
0071762345|5.0|When I read Likeable Social Media, I had only spent about a year in the social media world of Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube. I now have navigated the digital world for two years, and reading Kerpen's book has made a big difference in how I approach social media as well as the success that I have had with it. My primary goals when using social media have been to advocate for, coach,and become part of a community for indie musicians. I didn't know if the examples that Dave Kerpen gave would be relevant for me, since he primarily refers to the corporate culture. But Kerpen's demonstration of the importance of courtesy, respect, and responsiveness has made a world of difference in my use of social media as well as in my personal life. His argument for how crucial a recommendation is from friends who have \\"liked\\" my Facebook fan page is also something that I always keep in mind. Kerpen also gives clear instructions for the technical use of social media, as well as providing useful examples of approaches to campaigns that have helped make companies and organizations more accessible and successful. I have recommended this book to a number of people, and am grateful to the person who recommended it to me.
0810989956|1.0|When I bought it, I was told that book  is new, when I received it , it  was  used. I paid $ 8.99 including shipping and book, now I am returning this book because my son refused to use it  and when I went to the store it just cost $7.99 only. Now, I am returning this book and that is going to cost me another $ 3.00. so, here is the math, I am spending  11.99 , I will be receiving $5 as a refund, that means I am going to lose $ 6.99 for no reason.
B00BVYU2P2|5.0|Didn't want to stop watching it very funny.  Fun for the whole Family.  Wretched all of season1 back to back.
B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Reminds me of 1984. This is a classic with a twist. You won't be disappointed!<br />Considering the good mix of action and plot, it truly is a good balance
B008AK8FHM|5.0|To see this experience through the eyes of a pre emminent, well known and respected neuro surgeon, who survived a life threatening disease against astronomical odds, which gave him the opportunity to elevate the debate of the conscious, spirtual world and it's relationship to objective, hard science was unique, educational, uplifting, and encouraging. The gap is closing and our horizon is broadening.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I really enjoy this game. Easy to get the hang of but I do wish the credit (papers) were easier to come by..
B004L3AR0K|5.0|Purchased as a gift for a friend who enjoys romantic movies. She enjoyed it and is a big fan of Jake Gyllenhaal.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|So far it's fun.  I'm through the tutorial and slaughtering things left and right. Hope it stays this fun for a while.
B00BC5I6Q2|1.0|This would have to be the most boring series l have ever seen and l have seen some bad one's. I would advice people not to wast their money because their are a lot better shows to watch example BOSS.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|This book was delivered quickly. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone. Its a very easy ready and can be confusing, but if you get lost you can always google certain parts.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Terrific historical and interpretive writing.  I was glued to the entire book with the exception of the ending.  The resource references was exceptional.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a great book. Reading it now then will begin to apply the lessons. Bought because Wayne Dyer recommended.
B004UNX1LS|3.0|Most, if not all, videos are posted on YouTube. Why do I need this app, while I can just search on YouTube?<br />Like every other video app, music stops if I turn off screen or switch to other app.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Fun, casual gameplay. Great fun. Is can be somewhat repetative after a while, but is fun, creative, and innovative nonetheless.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Levels are fun, but there's only 10 levels. I'm expecting 80+ levels.<br />It's a little bit hard to navigate. Where you tap is a bit tricky.<br />Sometimes I have to refer to YouTube walkthrough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a really great escape game they need to put more rooms on it though and some of the solutions are so simple you'll smack yourself in the face for not getting it right away.
159463176X|5.0|Difficult to read, as each of his books has been, but so enlightening.  It introduces you to the culture behind the headlines and replaces ink with real human beings to be heard.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|They did a great job on everything I was highly satisfied with it I give it 5 stars everyone should read it(:
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Fun run game along the lines of Temple Run but on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 it is far less responsive than other similar games.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I enjoyed the whimsical costumes and received great incite to her life. I’ve always enjoyed seeing her on Ellen so I wanted to know more about her. I have a granddaughter her age so her music reaches not only all walks of life, but all ages!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, the interview perspective is new and interesting.  I totally enjoyed the read.  I will look for more by Max Brooks.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Though a documentary this movie kept you interested from start to finish. I'm glad I took the time to watch it and now I want the soundtrack.  Hey wasn't that Lili Hadyn playing violin towards the end on one of the current recordings?  She's amazing!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this Australian take on a good murder mystery and the consequences of those actions that effect so many. Cleverly plotted, with great characterizations, it gives you a good example of middle-class lives in Australia.  The end has a twist you don't see coming and can't predict. I really liked it.
B001EBYMB2|4.0|What can I even say about this movie?  If you haven't seen it, you need to.  Be prepared for some amazingly inventive, profuse, and offensive language, but be aware that it really HAS to be there.  It's not gratuitous, it's the reality of the times.
1439156816|5.0|This book is the best I have ever read for giving an aspiring writer practical, pertinent instruction on the craft. From the use of adverbs and adjectives, to construction and content, King covers it all. He also gives you some real insight into his own writing process and even delves into his the demons he has fought ( alcohol, drugs) in order to create. I recommend it for anyone trying to write, or anyone just interested in Stephen King.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Visually stunning with a captivating story which lures you in and grabs your heart!
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|I recently rented This IS 40. The trailer looked really smart and funny, but to my surprise the only smart and funny parts were shown during the trailer. It is a story of the so-called modern married couple, but if being miserable, whiny, and only focusing on my sex life with my spouse and how unhappy I am with it, I am more then happy to be old fashioned. It was depressing to watch how depressing this couple was and honestly I didn't laugh once in the first 10 mins of the movie. At one point I could actually feel this involuntary, uncomfortable scrunched up look I must have had on my face. It was just painful to watch this couple's horrible miserable marriage. At the 15 min mark, I finally told my husband, ok, I'm done, I can't deal with her whining at her husband anymore over stupid trivial stuff. His response... Thank goodness. If it were possible to give this movie less then 1 star that's what I would give it, as I feel I just wasted 15 mins of my life. Just awful, thank goodness I didn't dish out the cash to go see this in theaters! Actually I wish I could get my money back. To bad movies don't come with a money back guarantee.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I have been a big fan of NCIS for years.  I find the characters to be very interesting and well-drawn, so that you care about them.  There is always lots of action, but not a lot of blood and gore, and that's a good thing!  I hope they stay on the air for years to come!
B006LSZECO|5.0|So amazing. I could not put Gone Girl down. A psychological thriller for sure. Very inventive and creative, like nothing before I've read. Go Gillian Flynn!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|keep getting knocked off especially in the middle of the game.also sometimes does not accept my e-mail or password frustrating
B00004RFFI|5.0|i chose this 5 star rating, because it always has been my all time favorite tornado movie.  this tornado movie has a story plot to it, which it came from the book twister :).  that did happen for real when aunt megs house got hit bi a tornado in wakita, which is now called wahita something like that.  it's very flat there. they had no warning,  and the siren went off right when the tornado ripped through the area in wakita.  the f 5 tornado was for real to when it hit north east of oklahoma, in the middle of nowhere, and was on it's way to the area, where the peoples house and there farm was going to be damaged.  that was for real to with the persons house which there very lucky that they had a very strong storm shelter with very strong steel doors so that it doesn't suck the person up in the tornado.  they are very lucky that they survived.  there house got lucky that it didn't get sucked up in the tornado, which that it did happen in real life.  oklahoma changed so much now, with there names of places, since they got hit bi tornadoes.  i recommend this movie to anyone, that sees everything in real life in this movie :).  the tornadoes are real in this movie.
B00BQH9SY0|3.0|There are some really good songs on this album, but there are also a lot that start to blend together and don't stand out.  I bought it on a whim, so I didn't know many of their songs going into it.  I imagine in a year from now I won't listen to this one very much.
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I love Terry Pratchett so this was a natural extension of that genre for me to test out. It had some great lines, the story is both intellectually challenging if you are in the mood to think about what you are reading and outright funny with a few laugh out loud moments. I kept it to four stars because it was not my absolute favourite, but that may change next time I read it...
B00908DDZM|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums I have ever listened to.  There is only one song on the cd that is just ok in my opinion (Gold).  Every other song is either really good or flat out amazing.  If you are considering getting this cd even a little bit... just buy it.  Also, the cd is explicit.  I guess some people had issues getting clean versions, but mine was not.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was a random buy and I absolutely loved it! I found the story compelling on multiple levels and having had someone close to me pass away from cancer, I could relate even though the main characters were not my age group at all. Simple, profound, touching, inspiring - it probably is not for everyone but I enjoyed every minute.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Good action, decent sequel, a little corny as expected with the one liners. Strong cast of characters from action movies we all adore. Worth a look.
1439192812|5.0|bought for my granddaughter, 6 years old, she loves it, she is a gifted child..  maybe a young scientist some day!
B003O86FMW|5.0|My grandson read this book on his Kindle Fire. He is 11 and loved it, he can't wait for the movie to come out.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Excellent beginning to the Jack Reacher series.  Establishes Reacher's background and leaves the reader looking forward to his further development and adventures.
B00008BXJ6|5.0|New CD in proper packaging, smooth transaction! Thirteen more words required. AC/DC is excellent and this CD is worth owning.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Always enjoy Rankin's writing. He can keep me engaged until the very last page. So pleased to have Rebus back.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book has always been one of my favorites.  It deals with so many different issues such as war, sibling rivalry, love, parental sacrifices, hard choices, etc.<br /><br />Good reading for all!  Be prepared to cry!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Couldn't put the book down!! Now on to book number 2!!! I know its just going to get better and better!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I like Spider Solitaire!  I always like the challenge and when I master one level then there are two more to challenge me.  I don't get bored with this game.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|DIRE STRAITS is one legendary cool ROCK band.....BROTHERS IN ARMS is one of the BEST albums ever!!!!! While i like most all the stuff DIRE STRAITS created, this is their collection of huge HITS, one after one....MONEY FOR NOTHING, WALK OF LIFE, SO FAR AWAY and the title track are ROCK gens....Man, all the songs rules here!!!!! TOTAL CLASSIC!!!! ABSOLUTELY RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!WELL DONE, DIRE STRAITS!!!MASTERPIECE!
B00EE3HVMO|1.0|I certainly would like to see this episode, but after complaining more than a week ago, I'm *still* not able to download it to my TiVo!
B007Y6OZE0|2.0|Ok, the straight pure HARDCORE OFFSPRING is on the past....What we got now is a veteran band doing some POP ROCK with a bit of HARDCORE....Some songs like CRUISIN CALIFORNIA and ALL I GOT LEFT IS YOU are not even ROCK songs, one sounding like black eyed peas and the other like U2(way mellow)...Well, i understand that these guys are older, but it feels like OFFSPRING TOTALLY lost their way since CONSPIRACY OF ONE(2000)...I´m really not expecting another IGNITION or another SMASH, but i´m really sure that offspring TOTALLY forgot their PUNK roots and older fans, because what they are doing on DAYS GO BY is not remotely close to PUNK...There´s some fast guitars but all the stuff is way mellow and their inspiration is gone....it´s sad because i grow in the early 90´s and OFFSPRING was a respected HARDCORE band....Now, they are almost a joke because they become what they were oppose in the past....There´s 1 or 2 good songs on DAYS GO BY, but i think offspring is really on the past....Try IGNITION, IXNAY ON THE HOMBRE and their raw debut.....
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Nice DVD packaging.  Awesome tv show. Really enjoying watching it, lived up to the hype. What more can I say?
B001UGB1X8|4.0|This is another in a long line of films from a great actor. Although it seems a bit more of a B grade movie it is entertaining and has a very good plot. Much better than I expected! Give it a try!
B00CH87HF4|1.0|It would be a great game except I'm trapped. I can't go forward, and I have no skills.  I hoped the update would fix the problems, but it didn't. So now I scrap everything and start over or I trash the game. Decisions, decisions.
B00004UEDQ|1.0|I was terribly disappointed in this movie. I thought Sandra Bullock did a great job portraying an alcoholic, but the movie grossly failed at portraying a rehab program with any authenticity. The movie is downright silly at times, and I think grossly missed the seriousness, and tragedy of the ravages of alcoholism. Two thumbs down.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|The Ebay app is a big help--I especially like the option of saving the details of a specific item search.  I use the app on my Kindle Fire and have found it a problem not to have the forward arrow function.  More than a few times I've accidentally exited out of the app and, instead of being able to &#34;forward arrow&#34; to jump directly back to my last view, I must enter the app and start fresh--not fun when it happens before I can save my search criteria--forced to re-enter all the search filters.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Amazing short story.  Really transports you into another world - will be getting more from this author. Well worth the time.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|I'm on the second season and its still a good show.  Some of this season has been predictable for me but I'm still watching.  Can't wait for the next . . .
B0000AMRJC|2.0|I'm just watching the beginning of this movie, and I have to say that it seems silly and extremely outdated.<br /><br />It is funny though to see the actor who played the part of a Mexican cartel drug lord in the vastly superior Breaking Bad  present here as a young man.<br /><br />I don't what it is with Brian DePalma. I always get the feeling he must have had a terrible childhood or some kind of a trauma to end up making some of these voyeuristicly violent films.<br /><br />But these one dimensional characters are really so uninteresting.<br /><br />Also reminds me of the musical Grease for some reason........LOL<br /><br />Al Pacino's 'accent' and way of talking are so funny....overdone and obvious...yeah, the 'tough guy', right???'<br /><br />And then the usual objectification of woman....I wonder if anyone ever psychoanylized DePalma.....<br /><br />I did like 'Carrie', but it was certainly exploitive and had the 'ick' factor which I associate with many of De Palma's works. Something twisted there.<br /><br />Where did they get these some of these actors?????? I suppose this was 'cool' back in the day. Talk about stereotypes....
193700788X|2.0|It's not the ending that bothered me, because why create such a character without using him? I saw that one coming forever ago and it preserved the integrity of what we already knew about Eric, and her vampires in general.<br /><br />What I HATED about this book is that she sped through it. We had a huge sex scene and it wasnt even hot. There so many useless details about everything else. There should have been more time to make ______ sexy, and more time to let them fall in love.<br /><br />Also, did the whole premise of the book drive anybody else nuts? A one-time wish from a hugely powerful source for... another one time wish from a hugely powerful source? Why?
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I absolutely love this ap. it never fails that I can never find a calculator when I am at my  desk. However, I ALWAYS know where my kindle is.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game.  Has different helps.  Also has 2 different hidden object games.  Game keeps you thinking and on your toes.  I would recommend it to every one.  Also has many safe stop pints without losing progress.  Seems to be good for all ages
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|The graphics are good, although someone ought to tell the designers that only MALE lions have manes .(evidently they adopted their cubs), but the game is all over the place .One can rescue animals, but then there are dinosaurs too, and mythological animals as well.Make up your mind GAMELOFT!In this updated version one rescues and breeds and releases each kind of animal 3 to 6 times which makes for VERY slow game play -also some animals are only available to buy with &quot;peanuts&quot; which are earned too slowly to pay for the animals in question (although one can BUY peanuts with real money,surprise,surprise) It's disappointing to not be able to get a giraffe or panda, for example, but have to get rabbits and horses instead.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I had listened to the book on tape some time ago and heard the movie was wonderful.  The book had been so good;  I decided to give the movie a try and I was thrilled with it.  It even filled in some of the blanks from the book for me--the image of the Tiger leaping into the life boat--I had trouble imagining how that could happen--but there it was right before my eyes.  I still wondered after seeing the movie, did these animals represent human behaviors or what happened?  How did this come about?  It was most intriguing.
B00BMUVW5O|5.0|There is no doubt, the cat is still the hero, but shows what is possible when we allow ourselves to love and be responsible for another's well being - enjoyable reading
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I was thrilled to see Maggie.  Her name caught my attention--that and BBC.  This is a wonderful story that felt real.  All the characters were so real that I found myself laughing and crying with them.

B000002NAK|3.0|I was a little disappointed in that this was the entire musical on CD.  I saw the stage production recently and was reminded of the earlier movie with Madonna.  She was superb.  I mainly wanted to hear her again and not the full [production.  But it was still worthwhile.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game has been very exiting and i really love it its a fun game to play i play it all the time and i recommend other people play this to
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|I love a good fantasy, but when I have to suspend my believe so much that the law of physics no longer apply, I get really antsy. Giants: cool. Giant beanstalk: awesome. Surviving a fall from such great heights on the beanstalk falling quickly from the sky, and surviving without a scratch: that is a bit much for me. And the insta-beanstalk that grows in the belly of a giant... its like the stories my folks would tell me when I swallowed apple or watermelon seeds; you'll grow a tree in your belly. Rubbish!<br /><br />Way too much in the film was coincidence. Too much was aligned too well for this to be enjoyable. \\"It looks like doom for him, but whats this!? Random even is working just so specifically, its as if it was placed there on purpose!\\" Way to ruin the fantasy and remind me there is a film maker out there.<br /><br />I also hated how the strong female was not-so-strong once there was a male around. Biggest issue with fantasy films: they have a case of the chronic weak women.<br /><br />This had the potential of being really cool. Taking a traditional story and throwing in a modern set of beliefs... way to disappoint.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|I love this CD. All tracks are great. What's more, it comes with a DVD as well. Worth a buy, definitely!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome, but scary! Please read it BEFORE you watch the movie though... :) It is truly a great book!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Never got a chance to compare a saved image with the original .... it just won't save anything. Uninstalling as soon as can.<br />*  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *  *<br />I uninstalled the product as noted above.  I then installed the lite version which worked perfectly, but was limited in function.  Not sure what prompted me to do so, but I uninstalled the lite, and re-installed the full version.  To my surprise it worked perfectly, allowing saving of edited photos.  I did not take note of whether the second installation carried a different version number ..... I never saw an update notice from Amazon, so I don't think it was an upgraded release.  Chalking it up to a fluke with the first one.  Have revised my rating from one star.
0525953728|5.0|A great book from an honest man and a great warrior. The reader will get to know the psychology, the motives, the worries and the problems that Navy SEALs faced during the decade of the long war against Islamic terrorism. The mission to kill Bin Laden is, of course, the central theme and the climax of the story but there are many things that make this book an excellent choice for the fans of military adventures. I especially enjoyed the few pages where the author describes his meticulous attention to detail when he gets dressed and equipped for the Bin Laden mission, as well as the impressive professionalism of these elite soldiers who have become really legendary. What a pity that this book has been carefully sanitized to eliminate any sensitive or secret operational and actual details. If the things that are mentioned are only the not so secret ones, I can imagine what an astonishing story this man would have told if he was free from any restrictions.
B00A2H9P98|3.0|This is the second time we have seen the White House under siege this year on screen, the first being \\"Olympus Has Fallen.\\" Here comes the other one with a more straightforward title. \\"White House Down\\" is directed by none other than Roland Emmerich, someone best known for sci-fi action \\"Independence Day.\\" Like all of his action films in the past, \\"White House Down\\" is entertaining in its own way, with a fair amount of CGI-enhanced action, but ends up with something turgid and overblown, even for the genre.<br /><br />This is a traditional template of action movies. Channing Tatum's hero John Cale, a capitol policeman who happens to be inside the White House with his daughter Emily (Joey King) for job interview, saves the President Sawyer played by Jamie Foxx, when it is attacked and taken over by a group of terrorists. The situation seems pretty incredible, but still serviceable enough as the premise for yet another \\"Die Hard\\"-inspired action movie.<br /><br />Sadly Roland Emmerich just cannot stop adding things unnecessary to the already bloated storyline. International politics, YouTube images, John Cale's past marriage, etc. Everything slows down the movie, sometimes forgetting Channing Tatum's hero, who should be at the center of the story.<br /><br />To his credit, Mr. Emmerich did a decent job in creating action sequences, even though they tend to be overlong and repetitious (script by James Vanderbilt of \\"Zodiac\\" fame). I know I shouldn't take the film too seriously and I confess I enjoyed watching the film pretty much, but also couldn't help think that his latest film was a typical case of less is better than more.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|UPDATE:  1 month after buying this bag, I was carrying it by the top handle and it tore off while I was walking on a pier, dropping my bag with $5k of gear, almost into the ocean!  Upon inspection, I saw that the other side was beginning to tear also and that the handle itself was not up to the quality of the rest of the bag.  So BEWARE!<br /><br />ORIGINAL:<br />I have sling packs that cost twice this much, but this bag is even a bit nicer, bigger, more comfortable and better quality.
B0049VZ222|4.0|I had heard a lot about this series and decided to try it. It was fine but don't think I want to pay $2 per episode, so I gave it a 4.
B0071AKB38|5.0|I have only used this speaker 2-3 times since I've had it, but so far it works great. I like that I can change the song from either my phone or from the speaker. Great purchase especially for the size!

B001TH7GT6|5.0|These cables work well as expected. For the most part Cables are Cables, but some I will avoid because I think they are cheaply made. These did not feel like cheapo cables. I would not hesitate to buy the amazon basic av cables.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Denzel put in his usual strong performance but this flick got lost on the runway. Wacky story. Wacky characters and absurd plot twists that left me circling.
B000L53D4O|4.0|This is a great infant toy.  laying flat there are a lot of things for kids to play with.  Upright, our kids fight over pushing this walker back and forth across the room.  It probably isn't the most stable walker on the market, on occasion the kids do push it into and obstacle and tumble over, but they don't ever get hurt.  The kids have a tough time getting over the edge going from carpet to the top of those foam puzzle squares, but it can be done.  One of my kids is already walking and still enjoys pushing this around.<br /><br />The stickers are already coming off the pinwheels on the left so if you don't think you need em, just leave em off.  Once they start to peel, the kids try to eat them.
B004SKHJF2|3.0|I love it because of what it does.  I hate it because I think there should be a quick return to listen button somewhere on the pages of songs you tagged or other section of shazam.  I have lost several songs because there is no quick return button, and by the time I get to the page (by trial and error) the song is over.

B009AMALLM|3.0|The characters are pretty likable and the plot is kind of predictable but I still really like it. This is one of my favorite horror film series and I wasn't disappointed. If you didn't like the last ones you won't like this one, but if you like jumpy horror films and enjoy the &#34;found footage&#34; style of movie you should really enjoy it.

B004LM72ZY|5.0|Bought this for my 2 1/2 year old daughter as she has recently been interested in jets, rocket ships, space, etc.  Awesome little quality toy for a great price!  She has had it for a few days and LOVES it.  She very quickly figured out how to twist the 2 parts of the ship to open and close it. She still needs a bit of help getting the astronaut to 'click' into his spot to keep him in place.  Even if she can't get him clicked in, she likes to have him in there and shake him around as he flies through space.  I think her age is very appropriate for the toy and am not sure how a 1 1/2 year old (as stated on box) would do with it. Older daughter (age 5) discovered that the astronaut is interchangeable with the pilot for a little toy playmobil airplane that I bought 5 years ago for her (as I think most figures in this 1,2,3 Playmobil line would be).  Fun discovery!  I really like this 1,2,3 line of Playmobil for younger kids. This rocket ship promotes imaginative, pretend play.  We have several Playmobil toys and they are all of high quality and encourage creative, imaginative play without batteries, lights, noise, etc.  Though some of the sets can be a bit pricey (this rocket ship is a great toy for the price), they are well worth it in quality and in interest level for children.

B0012HEB32|5.0|It's hard to accept new characters in a spin-off series, especially when the new characters don't project similarities to original character's persona. However, This show had great actors in my opinion, and did a great job of continuing the personalities of the original cast. Highly enjoyed the main actors roles and looked forward to every next episode.<br />The story lines were also great, and awesome effects, so props on the writers and special effects guys on this TV series. There were a few creative liberties as with any spin-off, but they meshed well into the story.<br /><br />Didn't like the character selected for &#34;Kyle Reese&#34;, looked more like a dolled-up boy than a rough around the edges soldier. Too bad the at-time President of Fox TV, Kevin Reilly supported cancelling the show.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What a great mini series.  I love it.  The actors are superb and the story line is so well written.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Like many other's stated in their reviews, I also stopped watching mid-movie.<br />If you're familiar with the GI Joe stories and a fan, you will be greatly disappointed.<br />Writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick should be sat in a Hollywood Dunce Chair after this epic fail. Why?<br /><br />Spoiler alerts follow:<br />The iconic main character that generations grew up with, \\"Duke\\" and almost entire squad was killed off right away.<br />Snake-eyes wardrobe makes him look like a cyborg rather than the more typical ninja-like character. (Ugh.)<br />Snake-eyes is awesome character with unique talents, and suddenly Lady Jaye also fights with similar talents alongside him??? (Great job of de-glorifying a character writers.)<br />Some of the acting was not so great, and felt too forced by some characters.<br /><br />It felt like the writers stripped away all the joy we grew up with, and scrambled to make another typical military sci-fi movie, i.e, destroyed the nostalgia and gave back a movie that no longer reaches its audience. Moreover, felt like they destroyed the storyline just to give new cast member Dwayne Johnson the leading role. Don't get me wrong, I like some of his movies, but this is overkill.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show. I'm not one to write reviews for tv shows, but I love this show. I am not that eloquent so I won't go on, but you get wrapped up in this show.
B000NTPDSW|4.0|Love all three movies but the video quality is substandard.  Who ever was in charge of quality control was only spot checking instead of making sure customers received the best quality product that they could produce.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|and not for young ones either.<br /><br />This story is just not believable, I am very disappointed in the good reviews here. Our young hero basically stumbles into heroic situations (about every two pages) which he gets rewarded in implausible extends (mostly to his and the readers disbelief).<br /><br />This reads about like this:<br /><br />[Spoiler]<br />-Hero gets rejected from Kings's army recruiters [day 1]<br />-Hero has vision of King's druid and kills rare and superstrong beast with magic powers<br />-Hero obtains permission to join army and has two of King's son plus the most famed knight vouch for him [day 2]<br />-Hero saves most famed knight from vicious attack with magic powers [day 2]<br />-King declares hero to be part of his family and King's daughter develops crush on him [day 2]<br />-Hero fights big spider monster on harmless mission [day 3 ?]<br />-King awards him with audience and falcon [day 3, hero is conventienly unconcios on the way back]<br />-Hero finds the cub of a white Tiger, and saves King's son from assassin [day 4]<br />-Hero is in love with princess [day 5]<br /><br />.....and it goes on and on like this, seemingly with no feeling for time or distance, as if there is only a day or two difference between each major event
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting I cant stop playing. its so good u should get it right now. I love the world tour.my highscore is like over 2000000
B00005ATQD|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a little mystery and drama in their movie  loved the movie
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It's hard to put into words the appreciation I have for both SLAMMED and POINT OF RETREAT. I've owned SLAMMED awhile now and kept getting sidetracked with other books. Then I read it and wondered why I waited so long to read it. I then read POINT OF RETREAT immediately afterwards. They both are amazing books. When you buy these books you will do yourself a BIG favor by reading them ASAP!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|This series makes me get HBO every year when the season starts! I bought the disk because it is one that I like to watch over and over!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Excellent show.  Clever dialogue.  Enjoy the play between the main characters.  Do not care for the English take over - boring.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|It's obvious from the beginning of the book that Nate isn't completely normal.  He has these life like dreams which he refers to as \\"outviews\\" that are really views into his past lives.  There is a hint of romance that is just enough, plenty of action, and twists and turns that will keep you turning the pages.  This book is unlike anything I've ever read.  It was so realistic, like everything in the book could really happen. I loved all of the characters, and I can't wait to read more and continue on this journey with them to find out how it will all end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love solving puzzles and this game is challenging enough to keep you trying but easy enough to keep you from putting it down!! Can't wait for more levels!
B00AEBEQW8|5.0|I am a senior citizen but I had to have this book after reading a review about the author and the illustrator.  I use crayons with the embroidery patterns by Meg Hawkey.  A wonderful book for both children and the young at heart.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|The quality was great! I'm glad I watched it on here! This was the first time I streamed a movie online and couldn't tell the difference between it and watching a DVD. Good stuff!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Amazing read- could not put it down! Hosseini beautifully intertwined the stories of each memorable character. Highly recommend if you enjoyed his other books.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|So,a very fun game,though it was downloading the updates,and now it won't let me get to the game.it says it's still on my Kindle but can never get to play now. Could anybody help me out???Please :) thank you
B005HEPN06|5.0|This episode reaks of originality. Complemented by an exceptional cast and an equally well thought out story line, this is one of the top Next Generation episodes ever made.
B00CATSONE|5.0|its always great to read about great men in history and to read about their inventions that helped to get where we are today
B00DDZM0GQ|3.0|I love this game and it would be something I would play regularly if it didn't crash and become responsive all the time. Beware, every 3 or 4 games u will lose ur progress and have to reboot the game :(
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third book of this series was probably my favorite one.  I loved it because you learn so much about the characters and they really evolve in this book. You definitely need to read the first two books to understand what is going on but overall one of my all time favorite books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is one of the best out there!  It has the period costumes correct, great actors and all of the suspense and drama that will keep you fully engaged.<br /><br />My only negative is that we have to wait so long for the next Season to arrive!
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Delightful, delightful movie.  Well acted and engaging.  I am a fan of Jane Austen novels and the movies based on them.  However, some of the movies are more stylized with a Hollywood flare but this one was subtle and not over the top romantic.  Well done.
B0063M22QO|5.0|this is my favorite game to pass the time when I have to sit and wait.  and there are so many levels that you can play and play.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have the kindle HD 7&#34; and has been reliable. There have been instances I had to call customer service. Turns out, it was owner-operator fault.  Customer service has been excellent.
B00CP4RZIO|5.0|Okay, I'll make this short and sweet.  This record CRUSHES from top to bottom relative to the rest of their catalog.  I first noticed possible apathy in the group on The Infection - a good record but very inconsistent.  This record truly is killer;  there's not a bad song and it's very cohesive.  Also, it's one of the very few records I can think of where I wish there were more songs on it and I<br /> want to replay it when it's over..  I wish to hell I had contributed so I'd have the bonus tracks, goddamnit!  I highly recommend this record.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|I really love this game and even bought the full version but the game has rest on me a half dozen times making me start over. I even was at levels over 100 three times and it reset....very frustrating since I like it.....probably would have not bought if I knew this would happen @
0792844890|5.0|This movie came out when my son was 4.  Now my grandchildren love to watch it, great family film, funny.  God movie night pick.  I recommend this movie!
B000005ILF|5.0|I had been borrowing this cd from my local library for about three years when I decided that it  just had to be part of my Sting library! I am so glad to have my own copy.
B000ID37T0|5.0|I have four ladies at home, my wife, two daughters 29 and 19, and a 10 year old granddaughter.  They all loved &#34;Scent of a Woman&#34;.  I rented it for them.  I had already seen it.
B009369Z8A|4.0|very good movie loved the action. Loved it that it was perhaps a true story if not it should have been. Good story line and good actors.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|I bought a used one, and was pleased with the quality.  Jacket and CD were in great condition.  Will try buying used again to save a little...
0307266303|4.0|Mr. McDougall has painted an excellent picture of the ultra-marathon runner and the trials and tribulations they go through during their various long distance runs. His writting sets a good, logical pace.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Just a nice little movie about a subject that is probably more common, and hit's home with more of us, than we care to admit! Nicely portrayed...
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Like this app.  Very helpful. It's nice to be able to plan my week and have an idea what the weather is going to be.
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|its so awesome u have to get it. remember to add me my id is rbmju. I love this game. like me please
B009O07NMA|5.0|This CD is awesome and I really appreciate the great deal if the CD thank you for offering it  I
B00CS74W0C|5.0|This is books i will reread several time sizzling love story. very well written and i cant wait until the rest of the series comes out ill will be in line
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The saga of Downton Abbey continues in this second season with a wonderful balance of the lives of both the upstairs and downstairs inhabitants.  All of your favorite characters are back and giving wonderful performances.  If you've never seen Downton Abbey and you are a fan of period pieces, this is a must see!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is the best thing on the television really, really in a long time. I can't wait for season 4.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Refreshing to watch such clever dialogue and sophistication. The show oozes with class and culture. Also, the acting is superb.
B008NW67E0|5.0|am glad I purchased the cd, it received many accolades, some deserved. it is great to hear another British group have a variety of types of music.  will use the seller again , thank you
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love all the twists and turns!  It kept me guessing and engaged until the very end.  So glad I read this!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story is so exciting and interesting.<br />I cannot wait to see the next one and the movie of the first series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love it. more levels please, cant get enough of this game. very good game to keep your mind active and work your memory sharp
B00004YTIQ|5.0|I do like the product very much; however the picture is very misleading.  The cover is a translusent blue and looks nothing like the picture.  So far it does work very well for the pool my daughter has.  We only keep the pool up for a few days at a time, but it works great at keeping bugs and debris out when it's not being used.    August 15, 2014   I am updating my review a year later now.  This product has been working wonderful for the 120\\"x70\\" pool my daughter has.  I continue to be very pleased with the product and changed my rating today to a 5. (previous rating was 4 because the picture differed a bit)  We recently had a pretty strong thunderstorm with some strong winds and the cover stayed on the pool.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Maybe not high literature but very, very compelling reading and an engaging story. I'm glad I read it all before seeing the movie.
0143034545|5.0|Funny that it just took me such a long time to getting around to writing this review ... perhaps I am a hopeless case - but maybe you feel this way too ... perhaps the book will help you ... and what do you have to lose?
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I have been on the diet for 7 weeks and lost 9 pounds. I could not lose weight and this diet works! It has taught me to eat when I am really hungry. I now know the difference when I am hungry and when I am emotional eating. This is a great way to diet and I am well experienced diet plans.
B00005MP58|5.0|Excellent actors, acting, excellent how close to the book this Pride and Prejudice is.  LOVED IT ALL!!!  :):) Please see for yourself.
B005LAII4E|4.0|First of all yes these movies are silly, but they at least the scripts actually make some sort of sense. Cobra pulls the ole imposter president trick to very fun effect. The guy who plays the president is really having fun. All of the bad guys are awesome and really do steal this movie from the heroes. This is what I wish the transformer movies were...fun but in the end the script makes decent sense. Cobra has a great evil plan and actually does pull 90% of it off. Time for a Weather Dominator!!! In GIJOE 3.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Book was very hard to understand for me. I liked the movie better. It was a complicated story line, maybe that's why.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Wow this is the Best Superman ever...The Donner films were good, but had some major flaws; such as Lex Luthor being a moron the original film(allowing Miss Tessmacher to be alone with Superman after he threatens to kill a city with her mother there--Hackensack,NJ).<br /><br />In Man of Steel unlike any other Superman film we finally see the internal struggle of Clark Kent to reconcile his super powers with his humanity and his loneliness without making him into a creep(like in Superman Returns). The action is amazing, the story telling is excellent with only a small amount of forgivable flaws...I can't wait till BATMAN and SUPERMAN team up in Man of Steel 2!!!!!! YIPEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Also Amy Adams surprisingly makes an excellent Lois Lane. She actually fills the shoes of Lois nicely and at times helps superman and the plot move...and doesn't just scream for superman to help her.
B008QYT7DI|5.0|It touched my heart. I felt the story come true and the little princess being carried in my harms. I felt his vanishing as if I were to loose somebody very next to myself. Besides the touching story, there is a very profound truth on the anecdotal  comprehension and behavior of mankind.
B00932A2MC|5.0|Loved the movie! One of the best action film I saw this summer? Would recommend to to any one to watch or buy and put in their collection
B0002VFXFE|5.0|i folowed U tube derections and I put in. and the picture looks bran new. sharp cristal clear 100%. I LOVE IT.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best episodic shows I have ever watched. Every episode is worth watching, the characters are awesome and there is always new turns and twists, never boring.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Real nice. When i can't get to a computer to play minecraft i can get my tablet and i can jump onto minecraft Pocket. :D
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book even though it was a tear jerker. The character studies were amazing and the depth of emotion was amazing.  Whether you are a parent, child, spouse, sibling or significant other it has to touch you
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Hay guys it's us fingerprint were bring a new update that gives you an airplane and air vehicles. Give us a five star rating.
0061689246|5.0|The movie adaptation of this book is one of my favorite movies. I didn't realize it was a book for the longest time. There are a fair number of differences as the book is a little darker than the movie. It was still a good book and I would highly recommend fans of the movie to read it and vice versa!
B003Y5RLR8|3.0|Too much conversation and goofing off with Elvis's staff and fans.  Wanted more straight footage of Elvis singing.  Please recommend a better DVD.
B0089XH38M|4.0|GREAT PRODUCT.  WORKS IN THE BACK-GROUND AND I PRETTY MUCH FORGET IT IS THERE.  NO KNOWN VIRUS'S OR MALWARE AT THIS TIME.  LOTS OF GREAT SECURITY FEATURES.
B000FCKC4C|2.0|Had been looking forward to reading this book for ages and was extremely disappointed. Fully of trite wisdom offered by means of a boring story. Did nothing for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|WHAT A PRODUCT.  AN AMAZING AMOUNT OF VERSIONS ALL IN MY LITTLE PHONE.  I ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE VERSE OF THE DAY.  THERE ARE A LOT OF EXTRAS THAT I HAVEN'T REALLY INVESTIGATED YET.  TRY IT, YOU'LL LIKE IT.
B004TJ1H2I|3.0|This is the best western ever made, but this blu-ray transfer has added an additional 20 minutes that I dont want to see.All I want is the original movie on blu-ray.The transfer on the collectors edition box set(regular dvd)is as good as the blu-ray version and has all the extras.....support your favorite artists.
B000Q9IR0A|5.0|The authhors offer some extremely valuable tips and areplicable framework for creating an execution culture in your company. As one who values the abilitity &#34;to get things done&#34; this book is a great reference
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am glad this app is available and free.  I use it often.  The large numbers are helpful. Thank you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|super fun and look so real!! I just love having my in horses and taking care of them. the Competions are so awesome!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Yes, Clancy has help these days but the story, the tempo and the pace has Clancy's fingerprints all over it.  Great read and I thoroughly enjoyed the story.  The Chinese have perfected cyber warfare and it portends a very scary scenario.  Jack Ryan Jr. and his gang are fighting a mirror image, off the books Chicom organization.  Very interesting and a great page turner.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|After her brother Matt's death, Megan is ready to make a fresh start in his new town.  He had been her caregiver  in life, and now as it turns out, in death also.  She is amazed to learn of the fortune he has amassed and left to her.  She is fascinated with the business project he ha  left for her to establish.  Most of all, the partner and friend who comes with the business will be a partner for life for her.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Exactly my type of genre couldn't ever set it down. Every minute of my spare time was spent on this book! Can't wait to read the whole series!
B002HFP0QU|5.0|This 2-CD set has a great selection of the BeeGees hits.  Really has a good sound to it too compared to my other CD's.  Not sure why, but it sounds awesome!
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|Nice to &#34;complete&#34; the story, but I can honestly say that the sequels weren't as good as the first.  This one starts to reach real hard it felt like.
B0041D843M|5.0|Finally, a discussion about nutrition that actually makes sense!  A lot of science in an easily digestible read, and while a little repetitive, reinforcing ideas may not be such a bad idea.... Would have liked to see more samples of &#34;whole-plant&#34; meals and how to prepare things to derive the most benefit--perhaps a short Appendix in a later release of the book!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Beautiful and inspiring!  I recommend this film to anyone with a sense of wonder about the universe and why we are here.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|the English know how to make great movies about odd people in weird places. After watching the movie I am sure that my wife a and I will not be traveling to India this year.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's better than better. And there's little cute minions. It's based on the best movie ever. It's like sub way surfers.
B001LNOOG6|5.0|I love the way he writes. He always includes characters that try and take the hero down. they are usually cunning and devious and you just can't wait to see how the main character will turn the tables. Great story teller.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Fantastic lyrics sung with the highest professional skill.  Mavis is the real jewel.  Keep making these types of products for an appreciative audience.  5 Stars all the way.
B000VSAEYI|3.0|I thought it would be great for my 3-year and 4-year old.  My 3-year old has mild CP and I wanted something with low sides so she could easily get in and out, which in this respect it worked great.  She loves the pool.  The slide is not great, she's too tall for it at 37&#34;.  She sits up top and her feet practically reach the bottom of the slide.  The size is good if you have a lot of kids at your house. But not so much fun to empty, clean and refill.  It gets so dirty from the kids jumping in and out, you would need to empty it at the end of every use.  We may try to empty it, let it dry and then put a tarp over it to keep the inside clean for next use, unless you have a garage you can store it in while it's still inflated.  I think next year we'll go for the hard plastic.  I think it would be easier to maintain.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a really great book. Once  I started reading I couldn't put it down. I really enjoyed this book.
0007270968|3.0|Veers between easy reading and some confusing and dull passages for an American non-chef who is unfamiliar with nearly all of the persons mentioned in the book, ie, chefs in the UK, businessmen, etc., and also the slang used. For example, he describes his wife's kitchen as an \\"MFI job.\\"  What is that? Much of the book is devoted to his deal-making success, jumping from name to name without clarity.  The book deals mainly in great leaps with his evolution as a business giant and not as a chef.<br /><br />I would have liked to know more about how he went from  \\"commis\\" cook (whatever that is) to his spectacular reputation as \\"Superchef\\".  How did his \\"passion\\" develop, what were his early failures like, what are his favorite dishes, what does he cook at home, etc.?<br /><br />On the positive side, I did enjoy this mostly fast-paced book and find him an interesting, volatile, energetic personality.  He is brutally honest about himself and his family. While the flow of the book can be a litte jagged, to his credit it rings true and without the polished-apple feel of a ghostwriter. His \\"Kitchen Nightmares\\" series is the only one of his shows I watch and I've developed a jaundiced eye towards all restaurants after watching the series.  I would love to have the pleasure of dining in one of his restaurants knowing his impeccable standards.<br /><br />Followup:  I downgraded my rating to 3 stars as I found out one of the key stories in the book was a lie which was exposed after the book was published (the \\"stolen\\" reservations book).
B000N6TX1I|3.0|It was an OK movie, not really what I thought that it was going to be.  I can see why I got it for so cheap though.  It just leaves you hanging.  And there were parts in it, where I was like WHAT?  Like when they kill the dudes wife out of no where....just didnt make much sense.  Thought that maybe this movie could have been done better.
B000VTNLBU|4.0|Ghost in the Shell, is one classic anime movie for all anime fans to watch.<br /><br />For non-anime fans, this is an awesome sci-fi flick. It has some great philosophical questions, and a fast paced action packed 90 minutes.
B0090SI4LU|5.0|I have read the book and they do leave out some really good parts in the movie, but overall I think they did a really good job and all the charcters are just as I pictured them when I read the book.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|For the most part I enjoy Cruises movies. The MI series and even Jack Reacher were fun and full of action. This film was a big DUH! Whats going on?
1451695195|4.0|Following the loss of my husband I feel an insatiable need to KNOW that he is free of the horrendous pain that destroyed his life. I was skeptical when hearing about Dr. Alexander's experience, but ordered his book after it was recommended to me.  It is enlightening and has given me hope that my love is indeed with the God he believed in.  I would suggest this for anyone who is grieving the loss of a loved one, or someone who may be facing death due to terminal illness.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|Ole Matthew should have stayed out of this one. Very weak character and plot development. This had the potential of being another Stand by Me or Summer of 42 both of which were unforgettable in their characters coming of age. don't waste your time or money on this one
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is so easy to use. So far I have not had one issue. The app cleans the system among other things. I'm so glad that I downloaded.
B000I8G5GW|5.0|I remember fondly watching this with my father, a WWII veteran, many years ago.  Once you hear the music, it stays with you for life.
B0085YOD1A|3.0|my kindle already has this type feature so there is nothing exceptional about it. just uninstalled it after a few days
1741794609|4.0|This is a great guide to take for an upcoming trip to India.<br />It doesn't give a lot of history about the place, but you can get it from other guide books.<br />The pratical information is very useful to plan your trip. It's not the most update info but you can certainly know what to expect when travelling through the cities.<br /><br />I reccommend it and is a light book, so it's ok to carry it along on the trip.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book makes a person want to study more literature on NDE's and the possibility of an afterlife. I have read many reviews from customers who say this book gives proof or is solely disappointing? I just say, it makes me want to delve into this topic and see what other writer's, professor's, scientist's, and patient's who experienced NDE's have to say. This is probably a question we can never truly solve until we breathe our last breath.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Very fun game to play. This game is what I go to most at home. Hope there is more frontline commandos to come! And better physics and first person!
B001QJUX24|5.0|I loved the vistas of the west in Texas.  Texas is a huge state; I don't know if this was filmed in Texas.  But the drier part of west Texas does look like this in places.  The conflict within families and within individual settlers is well demonstrated.  The isolation is well demonstrated.  Greed, horror, and redemption are shown.  Heros are flawed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wish the ending was different, but it still left me thinking.  Very clever story.  I neglected all responsibilities to just read!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like her style of writing although you may know what is going to end up happening it is how she gets it there!
B000HC2LI0|3.0|The box set has some problems.  Glitches on a few DVDs.  Some wouldn't play on my DVD player at all, but worked fine on my media player on my laptopr.
0525953728|5.0|Very well written and easy to read.  Great description not only of the events but of the training involved leading up to those events.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Even though I'm upset the cast & crew couldn't put their drama aside for great tv, I still can't waot for the nxt season!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|Love this app, use it all the time. I'm always coming across people I want more information about and this is the perfect app for those questions and answers.
